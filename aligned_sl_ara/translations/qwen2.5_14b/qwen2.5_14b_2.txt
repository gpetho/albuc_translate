The author of this book, having completed for you, my sons, this book which is a part of the whole knowledge in medicine and reached its limit in clarity and explanation, thought it fitting to complete it with this discourse which is a part of the practice by hand.
Because the practice by hand in our country and in our time is completely non-existent, to the point that the science of it is nearly extinct and its trace has disappeared. And what remains of it are merely a few drawings in the books of the ancients, which hands have corrupted and errors and confusion have struck, to the point that its meanings have become obscure and its benefits distant.
Therefore, I decided to revive it and compose this discourse in a way of explanation, clarification, and abbreviation. I will also provide illustrations of cautery instruments and other surgical tools, as this is an addition to clarity and aids what is needed.
And the reason there is no skilled craftsman in our time who can do this with his hands is because the practice of medicine is extensive, and its practitioner should first engage in the study of anatomy, which Galen has described. Until he understands the benefits, forms, and temperaments of the organs, their connections and separations, and the knowledge of bones, nerves, muscles, their numbers, outlets, arteries, veins, and the locations of their outlets.
Therefore, Hippocrates said that there are many doctors in name but few in reality, especially in the practice of the hand. We have mentioned some of this in the introduction of this book.
Because one who is not knowledgeable about what we have mentioned regarding anatomy may fall into errors that can kill people, as I have often witnessed with those who claim expertise in this field without knowledge or understanding.
This is because I saw an ignorant doctor make an incision on a pig tumor in a woman's neck, thereby cutting some of the neck arteries and causing the woman to bleed to death before him.
I also saw another doctor who attempted to remove a stone from a man who was suffering from difficulty in urination. The stone was large, and in his haste, he removed it along with a piece of the bladder wall. The man died about three days later, and I was called upon to remove the stone. Upon examination, I saw that the condition of the patient's state and the nature of the hard stone made it what it was.
I saw another doctor who earned his living from some pimps in our city by practicing medicine.
A young black boy who was with him suffered a fracture in his leg near the heel, along with a wound. In his ignorance, the doctor hurriedly applied bandages and casts tightly over the break and the wound without allowing any room for the injury to breathe.
Then he let the boy go and indulge in his desires, leaving him for days without instructing him to loosen the bandage. As a result, his leg and foot swelled up, and he was on the brink of death.
I was called to attend to him, and I quickly loosened the bandage. He found relief from his pain, but the damage had already set in, and I could not reverse it.
The corruption continued to spread in the limb until he died.
I saw another doctor who cauterized a malignant tumor, and after several days, it became ulcerated, worsening the patient's condition. This is because when a cancerous growth is purely black and foul, it should never be treated with iron at all.
except that it may be in a part that can be entirely excised.
Therefore, my son, you should know that work done with the hand is divided into two kinds: work that is accompanied by safety, and work that is usually accompanied by damage in most cases.
I have warned in every place in this book where there is risk and danger; therefore, you should avoid and reject it.
So that the ignorant do not find a way to speak and criticize, take caution and protect yourselves, and for your patients take kindness and certainty.
Use the best method leading to safety and a commendable outcome, and avoid dangerous and difficult-to-cure diseases.
Keep yourselves away from what you fear might introduce doubt into your religion and worldly affairs, for it is safer for your reputation and higher in both this world and the next for your destinies.
Galen said in some of his advice: "Do not treat a disease badly, or you will be considered a bad doctor.
I have divided this article into three sections.
The First Chapter.
On cauterization with fire and sharp drugs, categorized and arranged from the head to the foot, including illustrations of tools and instruments used for cauterization and everything needed in manual work.
The Second Chapter.
On incision, stitching, bloodletting, cupping, surgeries, extracting arrows, and similar procedures, all categorized and arranged with illustrations of tools.
The third chapter.
On reduction and setting of dislocations, treating fractures, and similar topics, categorized and arranged from the arm to the foot, with illustrations of instruments.
The first chapter.
On cauterization.
And before mentioning how to use it, it is necessary to mention its benefits and harms and in which temperament it should be used.
I say that the discourse on the manner of the benefit and harm of cauterization is long, a subtle science, and a hidden secret, and many sages have spoken about it.
They differed on this topic, and I have briefly summarized their discourse to avoid lengthiness.
I say that cauterization is generally beneficial for every bad temperament that exists with a substance and without a substance, except for two temperaments: the hot temperament without a substance and the dry temperament without a substance.
As for the dry temperament with a substance, they differed on it. Some say that cauterization is beneficial in this case, while others argue the opposite, stating that cauterization is not suitable for a disease caused by heat and dryness because fire has the nature of heat and dryness.
It is impossible to be cured from a hot and dry disease with a hot and dry treatment. And the one who argues the opposite says that cauterization with fire may be beneficial for a hot and dry disease that occurs in people's bodies. Because when you add the body of a human and its moisture to the temperament of fire, you cause the human body to become cold.
And I say with him because experience has revealed this to me many times, but it should not be imagined by anyone except those who have extensively trained and are proficient in the art of cauterization. And he observed the differences in the temperaments of people and the conditions of diseases in themselves, their causes, their symptoms, and the duration of their course.
As for the other temperaments, there is no fear from them, especially cold and wet diseases, as all physicians agree on their benefit from cauterization and do not differ in its effectiveness.
Know, my children, that the essence of treatment by cauterization with fire and its superiority over medication-induced cauterization is because fire is a pure element whose effect does not extend beyond the part it cauterizes; it does not harm another connected part except for slight damage.
Cauterization with a burning medicine may extend its effect to parts beyond and might cause illness in the organ that is difficult to treat, or even death. Fire, due to its nobility and the purity of its essence, does not do this except when it is excessive.
This has become clear to us through experience, gained from long service and attention to the craft, and by observing the realities of the matter.
For this reason, I have spared myself the lengthy discourse. However, if it were fitting for my book, I would have presented to you a secret and obscure principle about fire, its manner of action on bodies, and how it cures diseases with philosophical and demonstrative arguments that are beyond your comprehension.
Know, my sons, that they have differed concerning the time suitable for cauterization, and they regard the season of spring as the most favorable time.
I say that cauterization may be suitable at any time, because the harm resulting from the time is outweighed by the benefit gained from cauterization. Especially if the cauterization is for urgent and severe pains that cannot be postponed, because what is feared from delaying it may result in a greater harm than the minor damage caused by the time.
And do not consider what the common people and ignorant physicians imagine, that cauterization which cures a certain disease will never return and they regard it as a permanent flaw.
It is not as they imagine, for cauterization is like a medicine that alters the temperament and dries up the humors which are the cause of pains.
However, cauterization is preferred over medication due to the speed of its success, the strength of its action, and the severity of its power.
It is possible for the disease to recur at some time depending on the patient's temperament, the persistence and strength of the disease, and the accumulation of excess in his body due to neglect in acquiring proper nutrition and similar causes.
Except when the disease for which cauterization is used is a mild one in an organ with little excess and moisture. Like cauterizing a tooth for pain or similar conditions, the pain may not recur in such cases, and this is rare.
And as for the general belief that cauterization is the last resort in medicine, this view is correct, though not for the reason they themselves believe, because they think there is no cure beneficial from either medication or other means after cauterization occurs, whereas the matter is otherwise.
The meaning of "cauterization being the last resort in medicine" is that whenever we use various methods of treatment for a disease and those medications are ineffective, then we use cauterization as the final method, which often proves effective. Therefore, it is said that cauterization is the last resort in medicine. Not in the sense that the general public and many ignorant physicians have understood it.
I mentioned earlier that cauterization with gold is better than cauterization with iron, because of the moderation and nobility of gold's nature. They said it does not become ulcerated at the site of cauterization, but this is not always the case.
Because I have experimented with this and found that it only happens in some bodies but not others. Cauterization with gold is indeed better than with iron, as they said, except that when you heat the cautery from gold in the fire, you cannot determine when it has reached the desired temperature by its redness.
And because it cools quickly; if you increase its heat in fever, it melts in the fire and spills, causing the operator to be distracted by this. For this reason, cauterization with iron has become quicker and easier to handle accurately for us, God willing.
I have organized this chapter on cauterization into sections that I have arranged from the head to the foot, to make it easy for the student to understand what is needed, God willing.
Chapter One.
Cut the head with one incision.
This incision is beneficial for excess moisture and coldness in the brain, which are causes of headache, frequent discharges from the head to the area around the eyes and ears, excessive sleep, toothache, and throat pain. In general, it is useful for all diseases caused by coldness such as paralysis, epilepsy, syncope, and similar conditions.
The procedure for this incision is to first order the patient to induce vomiting with a purgative and brain-clearing medicine for three nights or four, depending on the patient's strength, age, and habit.
Then order him to shave his head with a razor, and then seat him in front of you in a squatting position with his hands on his chest.
Then place the base of your hand on the base of his nose, between his eyes, and where your middle finger ends, mark that spot with ink.
Then heat the olive oil cautery, which has this appearance.
Expose the bone to the size of a chickpea or the head of a needle, then raise your hand; otherwise, repeat with the same instrument or another if it has cooled. Continue until you see the bone as described. Then take some salt, dissolve it in water, soak a cotton pad in it, and place it on the spot. Leave it for three days.
Then apply cotton soaked in fat to it and leave it there until the burning sensation subsides, then treat it with the quadruple ointment until it heals, if God wills.
They say that a wound, the longer it remains open, the more it discharges pus, and thus it is better and more beneficial.
Some mention that the skin should be cauterized down to the bone, and the cautery tool should be held until part of the thickness of the bone is burned; then what has been burned from the bone is removed afterward, and it is treated.
Others say that cauterization should be excessive until it strongly affects the bone, causing small pieces to fall off like grains or small shells, and they claim that this allows the vapors of the head to escape and that the wound should remain open for a long time.
Then it should be treated until it heals. I do not see these two types of cauterization at all except in some people, and taking them is risky; leaving them alone is better for me. Peace be upon you if it is so, for the head weakens when its natural connection is severed as we have seen with other organs.
Especially when the patient's head is naturally weak, the first type of cauterization is safer and better for me, and I use it. Use it to ensure safety if God wills.
The Second Chapter.
On Cauterizing the Head as Well.
If a chronic pain occurs in the head and persists for a long time with no relief from using various treatments such as inhalations, powders, steam baths, ointments, and dressings, especially if a single cauterization described has been used without any benefit, then observe. If the patient's head is strong by nature and not weak, and if he feels intense cold, place another cautery slightly above that one. Then apply the cautery to each horn of his head until the thickness of the skin is reduced and the amount of bone described becomes visible. Apply a cautery at the back of his head in the place known as the axe, and be gentle with your hand here; do not expose the bone, for the patient will feel intense pain from this, unlike the pain from all other head cauterizations. I will mention this cautery in its proper place.
The cautery instrument used for the horns of the head and its back should be gentler than the one used for the center of the head. This is its appearance.
Chapter Three.
On cauterizing an acute headache.
If pain and headache occur on one side of the head and the pain extends to the eye, induce vomiting with purgative medicines for the head and use all other treatments mentioned for various diseases. If this does not help, cauterization should be performed in two ways. Either cauterization with a sharp, burning medicine, or with an iron instrument.
As for cauterization with a burning medicine, take one clove of garlic, peel it, and trim its ends on both sides. Then cut an incision in the affected area of the temple with a broad scalpel until there is enough space under the skin to accommodate the garlic.
Insert it under the skin until it disappears, then pull it tightly with a bandage securely and leave it for fifteen hours. Then release it and remove the garlic. Leave the wound for two or three days, then treat it.
Apply a cotton pad soaked in fat until the area becomes pus-filled, then treat it with ointment until it heals, if God wills. If you prefer, you can do this with some cauterizing drugs that I mentioned in Article Eighteen on cauterizing drugs.
As for cauterizing with an iron, it is done in this manner: Heat the cautery iron which has this shape:.
It is called the nail-shaped cautery because its head resembles a nail, with some indentations and a small protrusion in the middle.
Then place it on the affected area and hold it while slowly rotating the iron. The depth of the cauterization should be about half the thickness of the skin. Lift your hand to avoid burning the artery below, which would cause bleeding. Then soak a cotton pad in salt water and place it on the area, leaving it for three days. Then soak the cotton pad in fat and treat it with ointment until it heals, if God wills.
If you prefer, cauterize this abscess with the blade-like end of the cautery, and be careful not to cut the artery in this non-chronic abscess especially.
Chapter Four.
Treatment of chronic migraine.
If the migraine is not treated effectively with the mentioned treatments and divisions of diseases, and you find that the condition requires something beyond what has been previously described regarding cauterization with medicine or cauterization with fire. You should heat the cautery knife until it turns white. Place it along the line marking the location of the pain, about half a finger's width or so. Hold it once and as you hold, cut through the artery until you reach near the bone.
However, you must be cautious of the joint of the jaw that moves during chewing. Do not burn the muscle or nerve that controls it, as this can cause spasm.
Be careful and cautious about the bleeding from the artery you have cut, as there is risk involved in cutting it. Especially for one who is ignorant of what to do and has not followed a proven method; it would be better to refrain from working.
Details on how to manage bleeding from an artery will be discussed in its appropriate place within the book, if God wills. If you find that the condition requires something beyond this cautery, then:
And if you see that the patient's body can withstand it, apply cautery in the middle of the head as described, and treat the wound until it heals, if God wills.
If you wish, you may use the cautery method mentioned in the section on severing the artery with a double-bladed cautery, as it is a better and more effective form of cautery than this one.
Chapter Five.
Concerning the pains of the ears.
If pain occurs in the ear due to cold and is treated with laxatives and other treatments mentioned in the classification, but the pain does not subside, then heat the instrument called "al-nakht," which has this shape.
Then, after heating it, apply it in a circular motion around the entire ear or around both ears if the pain is in both. Then, after applying a salve to mark the spot, apply cauterization slightly from the base of the ear. The cauterization should be about ten points in each ear or thereabouts. Then treat the spots until it heals, if God wills.
Chapter Six.
Concerning the treatment of weakness.
The weakness that is treated with cauterization is of the type that occurs due to phlegm, as mentioned in the classifications of diseases.
Cauterization should be avoided for the type that occurs due to dryness and nerve spasms.
If you have treated this type of weakness with emetics, purgatives, and gargles but your treatment has not been effective, then the patient should be cauterized with three applications. One at the base of the ear, the second a little below his temple, and the third where the lips meet.
Make the cauterization on the opposite side of the affected area because the relaxation occurs on the side that appears healthy.
The figure of cauterization is that it should be cauterized near the upper ear tip, under the horn of the head slightly, and another in the cheekbone, and its length should be as long as the width of the thumb.
Lower the cauterization until it burns half the thickness of the skin, and this is the figure of the cautery tool, which is a type of knife-like instrument as previously described, but slightly gentler as you can see. And it should be that the knife has a little more thickness, then treat the area as previously mentioned until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Seven.
On the cauterization of chronic wounds.
If the wound becomes chronic and you treat it as mentioned, but your treatment is not effective and there is no fever in the patient, cauterize it with four applications. One cauterization on each horn of the head, one in the center of the head as mentioned, and one cauterization at the back of the head as previously described.
The cautery should be applied as described, and it may also be cauterized at the mouth of the stomach for better effect, then treat it as previously mentioned.
Chapter Eight.
On the cauterization of forgetfulness.
Those who suffer from phlegm should first be given large doses of expectorants and purgatives for the brain.
Then he should shave his entire head, and apply a mustard poultice, as described in the section on plasters; it should be applied repeatedly, for it is a form of cauterization.
Do this in the same order as mentioned there, for if he recovers, it is enough; otherwise cauterize him three times at the back of his head, the spots being arranged from the top of the head to below the neck.
And leave the width of a finger between each cauterization spot. Then treat the cauterizations as described earlier. If you wish to increase the treatment and the patient can tolerate it, perform an additional cauterization at the middle spot.
If you wish to increase the treatment, cauterize him at the temples, then treat him until he recovers. The cautery instrument should be olive-shaped as previously described.
Chapter Nine.
On cauterization for hemiplegia and general relaxation of the body.
It is advisable to begin with purifying the head using iyargates and what has been mentioned, then shave the patient's head. Cauterize one spot in the center of the head, one on each temple, and one at the back of the head.
And three spots on the vertebrae of the neck. If needed for treating general body relaxation, and if the patient can tolerate it and the disease is severe and persistent, cauterize four spots on the vertebrae of his back. Carry out the cauterization thoroughly until most of the skin is burned, then lift your hand and treat him as previously described until he recovers, if God wills it. The cautery instrument should be olive-shaped.
Chapter Ten.
About epilepsy.
For one who suffers from epilepsy due to phlegm, it is necessary first to cleanse their skull with large scarifications and with all the treatments mentioned in the division if the patient is large and can tolerate taking medications.
But if the patient is a child who cannot tolerate medications, then use gargles and cleansing powders for the brain several days before, along with improving their diet.
Then shave his head, and apply one cautery in the center of the head as described previously, and another cautery at the back of his head. And on each temporal region of his head, apply a cautery. If the patient is strong and can tolerate it, apply the cauterizations mentioned for one suffering from epilepsy, along with relaxing the body at the neck vertebrae and back vertebrae. The cautery should be olive-colored as described previously.
If the patient is a child, then make the cautery gentle as described in this manner.
Chapter Eleven.
About cauterizing mania.
If the cause of mania is corrupt humidity and thick phlegm, apply the cauterizations mentioned for one suffering from epilepsy.
If the cause of mania is excess leaning towards black bile and the patient's body is humid, give them what cleanses the brain as mentioned in the division.
Then shave the patient's head, then make a tight doughnut-shaped bandage of linen, then place it in the middle of his head while the patient is sitting with his legs crossed holding it from all sides, then take one pound of old lamb fat.
Then heat it gently over the fire to a moderate warmth that can be tolerated by the finger when inserted, then pour it into the center of his head in the circle and leave it until it cools. Do this for the patient once every week along with other proper care until he is cured, if God wills.
And if you wish, cauterize it with many small dots without holding the cautery in your hand, but rather let it be just a fumigation; for this kind of cauterization moistens the brain moderately.
Then apply a piece of cotton soaked in fat or chicken fat to it.
The Twelfth Chapter.
On Cauterizing the Water Flowing into the Eye.
If the beginning of the water flowing into the eye becomes apparent by the signs mentioned in the division, then hasten to purify the patient's head and warm it from all humidities, and sweat him in the bath on an empty stomach for several days.
Then have him shave his head and cauterize it with one cautery in the middle of the head, and cauterize two on the cheeks if the water is flowing into both eyes or from one side if it is from one eye.
Then cauterize with a cautery all the veins and arteries beneath the skin; let the burns be as long and wide as the temples, and take care to avoid excessive bleeding.
If you see something that requires treatment, then treat it as appropriate. We will come to the wisdom in ligating arteries and cutting them while being cautious about bleeding.
And cauterize in the occiput under the two bones with significant cauteries.
Chapter Thirteen.
On Cauterizing Chronic Tears of the Eyes.
If the tears of the eye are chronic and constant, coming from veins and arteries on the surface of the head outside the skull, and you ascertain that this is due to excessive cold phlegmatic matter, then cauterize with the cautery described at the beginning of the tear's flow. Cauterize one point in the middle of the head, two points on the temples, and two points at the back of the head under the bones. If more is needed, cauterize one point on each side near the end of the eye, at the edge of the eyebrow, with a small cautery.
Chapter Fourteen.
On Cauterizing Foul Nasal Conditions.
If the treatment mentioned in the division proves ineffective, then begin by applying a plaster to the patient's occiput for three nights, then shave his head and cauterize the central point with an olive-oil cautery. Then apply the cautery with the spiral cautery twice above the eyebrows, under the hair slightly, and be careful not to cut the artery; this is a picture of the spiral cautery.
Chapter Fifteen.
On cauterizing the relaxation of the eyelid.
If the eyelid relaxes due to disease or moisture, cauterize the eyelid once with this crescent-shaped cautery.
If you prefer, cauterize it twice just above the eyebrows slightly, keeping away from the temples, and each cautery should be as long as the eyebrow.
Do not overdo it with the cautery; rather, burn only one-third of the skin, and the shape of the cautery should be as follows.
Chapter Sixteen.
On cauterizing the eyelid of the eye.
If her eyelashes turn inward, then expose the eye and cauterize it in two types. Cauterization can be done either with fire or with a burning medicine. As for cauterizing with fire, instruct the patient to stop plucking their eyelashes if they do so, until they grow long and even.
If they grow inward at the base, bind his eyes with a bandage so that they do not move until they grow. When they have grown and are even, place the patient's head in your lap, then mark on the eyelid with ink in the shape of an oak leaf.
The mark begins near the eyelashes, then place cotton saturated in egg white or squirting cucumber juice under the eyelid. Then heat an iron, this is its image.
Then heat and apply the iron in the shape that was taught, little by little over many times until the surface of the skin, which resembles the shape of a laurel leaf, is completely burned. The sign of success is seeing the eyelid raised and the hair lifted away from the eye socket.
Raise your hand at that moment and leave it for three days, then apply a bandage with fat until the scab falls off, then treat it with ointment until it heals, if God wills. If hair returns after some time and the eyelid relaxes.
Repeat the cauterization on that spot as you did initially. If the hair is in the lower eyelid, burn it until it returns to its natural position without piercing the eye with the hair. As for cauterizing with a burning agent, instruct the patient to leave the eyelashes until they grow long and straight.
Then make a paper in the shape of a laurel leaf. Take one dirham or so from ordinary soap and unslaked lime from each, then crush them together finely. Do this quickly to prevent it from drying out. Then spread it on the paper you made in the shape of a laurel leaf and place it on one or both eyelids. Put cotton soaked in egg white under the eye, and have the patient's head in your lap.
Place your index finger on the medicine and squeeze it slightly, stirring it as the patient feels the sting of the medicine because he will feel a burning sensation like fire. As long as he feels the sting, leave the medicine and stir it with your finger. When the burning subsides, remove the medicine and wash the eye with water.
And observe; if you see the eyelid rise as it does when it blisters with heat or cutting, and if not, then reapply the medicine to the area where the medicine had no effect and did not darken until you have completed your work and caused the eye to blister. Then apply cotton soaked in oil until the burn scab falls off.
Then treat it with a cream such as the one made from palm or another suitable ointment until it heals. It is essential to be extremely cautious during the procedure that no part of the medicine falls into the eye. If after days the eyelid becomes lax and you fear any hair might enter the eye.
Reapply the medicine to that part of the eyelid which has become lax, as you did initially, and then treat it until it heals. This is a picture of the oak leaf.
Know that people's eyes differ in size, so adjust your treatment accordingly. The way to proceed correctly is not hidden from those who have experience in this craft.
Chapter Seventeen.
On the treatment of the cyst that appears in the tear duct.
If the treatment of the cyst, as mentioned in the sections on diseases, does not succeed, then it should be treated by cauterization as follows.
Instruct the patient to place his head in your lap, and have a servant hold the patient’s head firmly so that it does not move or shake.
Then place cotton soaked in egg white or in the spittle of a cat on his eyes, then heat the iron which has this shape.
It should be hollow, shaped like a tube or the feather of an eagle at one end where it will cauterize. If you wish, it can be perforated at the other end, or it can be solid like a rod. However, this hollow type is better for your work, if God wills.
Then squeeze the fistula if it is open and remove the pus, then dry it. If it is not open, cut it open and remove its pus. Then apply the hot iron to it; hold it with your hand until it reaches the bone.
Keep your hand a little farther away when cauterizing, from the eye towards the nose, so that you do not miss or disturb the patient and cause the iron to fall into the eyelid and damage it. If you reach the bone on the first cauterization, if not, reapply the iron once more if necessary.
Leave it for three days, then apply a cotton ball with fat and treat it with the dried ointment until he is healed. If after forty days he has not recovered, apply a sharp medicine that will expose the bone, and proceed as will be mentioned in its section, if God wills.
Another approach to cauterizing a fistula, mentioned by some early practitioners, is to deliberately cut open the site of the fistula and then place a thin tube in the same incision; this is its shape.
Pour into it the amount of one dirham in weight of melted lead, and hold your hand on the compress firmly, tightly, and do not let the patient move at all so that the melted lead does not flow to his eye. And you should place a cotton ball soaked in egg white or in water on the patient's eye.
For the lead burns the site of the nasal polyp and cures it miraculously. If the polyp is cured by what we have mentioned about cauterization and treatment, otherwise it is necessary to use nasal drilling and return the polyp to its proper nasal passage as will be detailed in its specific section.
Chapter Eighteen.
On Cauterizing Cleft Lip.
A cleft in the lip, called a thread, often occurs, especially in the lips of children. It is common for this cleft to occur. If you treat this cleft as mentioned in the division and the treatment does not succeed, heat a small knife-shaped iron like this figure.
Make the inside as thin as a blade, then place it while hot quickly into the cleft until the cauterization reaches the depth of the cleft. Then treat it with a cautery until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Nineteen.
On Cauterizing Newly Occurred Nasal Polyps in the Mouth.
If a swelling occurs at the base of the palate or in the uvula or at the roots of the teeth, it becomes inflamed and bursts, forming a polyp from the flowing pus. If you treat this polyp and the treatment is not effective, then heat an iron to fit the size of the polyp.
Then insert a hot instrument into the fistula hole and hold it until the heated tool reaches its depth and end. Do this once or twice, then treat it with the remedies mentioned until it heals, if God wills.
If the substance is interrupted and it heals, otherwise, it is necessary to examine the place and remove the diseased bone as will be mentioned in its section, if God wills.
Chapter Twenty.
On fixing loose teeth and gums.
If the gums become loose due to moisture and the teeth move, and treating them with medicines is ineffective, then place the patient's head in your lap. Then heat the cautery, which will be illustrated after this, while placing the tube on the tooth.
Insert the hot cautery quickly into it and hold it for a moment until the patient feels the heat of the fire reach the root of the tooth. Then lift your hand, then repeat inserting the cautery as many times as necessary. Finally, have the patient fill their mouth with salt water.
Hold it for an hour and then spit it out. Loose teeth will stabilize, loose gums will firm up, and harmful moisture will dry out.
Chapter Twenty-One.
On treating toothache.
If the toothache is due to cold or there are worms in the tooth and medication does not help, then treating it by cautery can be done in two ways: either by using fat or by using fire.
As for cauterization with tallow, take the ox's tallow and boil it in an iron ladle or a shell. Then take cotton and wrap it on the tip of the cautery instrument, dip it in the boiling tallow, place it quickly on the painful tooth, and hold it until it cools.
Then repeat this several times until the heat reaches the root of the tooth. If you wish, dip a piece of wool or cotton in cold tallow and place it on the painful tooth, then put the heated metal instrument over it until the heat reaches the bottom of the tooth.
As for cauterizing with fire, take a copper or iron tube that is slightly thick so that the heat of the fire does not reach the patient's mouth. Then heat the cautery instrument which will have its shape shown to you and place it directly on the tooth and hold it until the instrument cools down. Repeat this several times.
The pain will disappear either that very day or the next day. After this cauterization, the patient should fill their mouth with good tallow and hold it for an hour before spitting it out. This is the shape of the cautery instrument.
Cauterize with whichever part you wish, as much as possible. This is the shape of the tube.
Chapter Twenty-Two.
On Cauterizing Pigs.
If the pigs are afflicted with phlegm and cold dampness, and do not respond to treatment with medicines for maturation, and you desire a quick maturation, then heat the hollow cautery instrument which has this shape, with both ends open.
To remove smoke during cauterization, place it [the cautery] protected on the same tumor once and twice if necessary until it reaches the depth of the tumor. If the tumor is small, make the cautery the size of the tumor.
Then leave it for three days and apply a cotton pad soaked in fat until what was burned by the fire is gone, then treat it with ointment and bandages until it heals, if God wills.
Chapter Twenty-Three.
On cauterization for hoarseness of voice and difficulty in breathing.
If the moist humors predominate in the windpipe, especially if this is accompanied by a cold temperament, it is necessary to first induce vomiting with laxative medicines, then cauterize him with cautery at a point on the hollow of the throat at the base of the larynx.
Be careful not to reach the cauterization to the larynx, and do not burn more than half a fingertip of skin. Then cauterize him again at the neck joint at the end of its knot, and the cautery should be needle-shaped as previously described.
Then treat him with what was mentioned above until he is healed, if God wills.
Chapter Twenty-Four.
On cauterizing diseases of the lung and cough.
If the cough and lung disease are due to cold moist humors, and there is no fever or consumption in the patient, and the illness is chronic, then cauterize him with two cauteries above the collarbones in the low, soft, empty areas, and another cautery in the center of the chest between the breasts.
The iron should be shaped like a nail as shown in the previous illustration. If you prefer, it can also be used for puncturing with an instrument called "al-nukat," which has been illustrated previously in the context of treating earache pain. The punctures should range from thirty to about that number.
Then treat it as previously mentioned until it heals. You can also make an iron with three prongs as shown in this illustration, and use it quickly for cauterization because you can cauterize three areas at once with it. This is the illustration of the iron.
Chapter Twenty-Five.
On Cauterizing the Armpit.
If the head of the humerus dislocates due to slippery rheumatics or does not stabilize when it is reduced, so that it becomes habitual and dislocates with even minor movement, as we have observed, then the shoulder should be reduced first. Then the patient should lie on his back or on the healthy side. Then raise the skin inside the armpit upwards with your left fingers if the joint has dislocated inwardly.
Then heat the iron with two edges, as shown in this illustration.
Then cauterize the skin with it until it penetrates to the other side, forming four cauterizations. It can also be done with an iron that has three edges, in which case six cauterizations will form, and the edges should be on the thin part of the tissue.
This is the illustration of the iron with three edges.
And one may add to this number one, so that the cauterizations become eight. Then carry out the cautery with finely ground pumice stone mixed with salt; then instruct the patient to rest and do not move the part for a time until it becomes strong. If the dislocation is upward, which rarely happens.
Cauterize above the shoulder with one good nail-shaped cautery or many dot-shaped cauterizations, for the joint will become stronger and moisture will be removed, and the patient will recover.
Chapter Twenty-Six.
On Cauterizing the Stomach.
If cold and excessive moisture occur in the stomach, causing it to deviate from its normal condition and leading to increased discharges, and various treatments have been ineffective, then the patient should lie on his back with arms and legs extended. Cauterize him three times. Cauterize with a nail-shaped iron below the chest spoon by the width of a finger, and two cauteries below each side of the single cauterization until the shape of the cauterizations forms a triangle, keeping them apart so that they do not meet if they become inflamed. The depth of the cauterization should be one-third the thickness of the skin, and this is the shape of the cauterizations.
In this manner and to this extent, without excess.
If you prefer, cauterize him with one large cautery in the center of the stomach in this manner.
And the iron used for this single cauterization should be circular in this manner.
And the stomach is cauterized by punctures for those who are afraid of this cauterization, which is done by applying dots on the stomach with ink to the extent desired, then cauterizing them with a pointed cautery, and then treating it with the treatment mentioned until he recovers.
Chapter Twenty-Seven.
On Cauterizing the Cold Liver.
If pain arises from the liver due to coldness and humidity or due to a noxious vapor such that it deviates excessively from its natural temperament, and the patient is treated with what we mentioned in the classification but it does not improve. Then the patient should lie on his back, and three cauteries should be marked with ink in this shape and exact measure on the liver, below the ribs where a person's arm ends.
And there should be about the width of a finger between each cauterization, and the cauterization should be straight along the length of the body. Do not press the cautery against the skin too tightly.
And the amount of skin tissue burned should be half its thickness, not more. The patient should stand on his feet; if he cannot stand, he should lie down with his legs outstretched and arms raised. This is a picture of the cautery.
You may cauterize these points with a knife-shaped cautery if you are skillful and careful in the practice to avoid burning the entire thickness of the skin, which could burn the abdomen and reach the intestines, as the skin there is thin. Be aware of this.
Chapter Twenty-Eight.
في علاج ورم肝脏的治疗使用烧烙法。注意，这里的内容更准确的翻译应该是关于“用烧烙法治疗肝肿块或肿瘤”的意思，但严格遵照指示不添加任何注释或解释的前提下，字面翻译为：“在用烧烙法治疗肝脏的肿瘤”。为了避免进一步的修改或解释，保持核心信息直接翻译。
إذا ظهر في肝脏脓肿，并且你想知道这个肿块是发生在肝实质中还是在腹膜上，那么如果是发生在肝实质中，病人会感到沉重和疼痛，但没有剧烈的痛感。
而如果是发生在肝脏的腹膜上，疼痛会非常剧烈，并且你会发现这很难治疗。病人应该仰卧，然后在肿胀的地方敷上药膏。
然后将烙铁在火中加热，这种烙铁类似于铲子，这是它的样子。 用它进行一次烧烙，直到烧穿皮肤，并且要烧到腹膜，以排出所有脓液，然后按照治疗脓肿的方法继续治疗，直到痊愈。
这种烧烙方法只有那些长期从事医学工作、并通过多次实践经验处理过此类疾病的医生才能使用。在这种情况下，如果不够资格，则最好不要进行这样的操作。
Chapter Twenty-Nine.
关于烧烙胆囊的方法。
在早期，使用长而干燥的泽兰根进行冷胆囊烧烙的方法是：取一根最长且粗细如手指的干泽兰根，将其浸入油中，然后在火上加热。 Then cauterize once between the joint of the collarbone and the neck, two small cauterizations slightly tilted towards the side under the beard, and two large cauterizations above the breasts between the third and fourth ribs.
Also two cauterizations between the fifth and sixth ribs, slightly tilted towards the back, one cauterization in the center of the chest, another above the stomach, and three cauterizations from behind, one between the shoulders, and two on either side of the spine below the cauterization that is made between the shoulders.
You should not penetrate deeply with the cauterization but rather do it on the surface of the skin for ventilation. Some early practitioners mentioned that there were people who used an iron cautery resembling a needle, heating it and inserting it between the ribs until it reached the actual tumor.
The period of treatment should be as mentioned for a liver tumor. Cauterizing in this manner is highly risky; either the patient may die immediately, or an incurable fistula may develop at the site.
Chapter Thirty.
On Cauterizing the Spleen.
If treatment of the spleen disease with the methods mentioned in the division does not succeed, then cauterize it on three aspects, all of which are correct. One method is to cauterize it with three or four cauterizations arranged along the length of the spleen.
In the form of cauterizations similar to those of the liver, as previously described. The distance between each cauterization should be the width of a finger or slightly more. The shape of the cautery should be as mentioned for cauterizing the liver, and you should not penetrate deeply with the cauterization. The patient is positioned lying on their back.
The other side at the elbow and raise the skin opposite the liver where the left elbow ends, and you should lift the skin across the width of the body so that the cauterizations fall along the length of the body.
Then insert the cautery rods very carefully until they pass through the skin from the other side, then remove the cautery, and there will be four cauterizations; if you wish to use the other cautery with three rods, do so.
Then treat the cauterized area after leaving it for many days to discharge pus, as this is more effective than other treatments mentioned previously.
Chapter Thirty-One.
On Cauterizing Dropsy.
Cauterization is beneficial specifically for dropsy caused by retention of fluid. If you treat a person with dropsy using various methods we have mentioned in the classification and your treatment does not succeed, then you should cauterize them with four cauteroses around the navel and one cauteros on the abdomen.
Another cauteros on the liver, one on the spleen, and two behind him between the ribs, one opposite his chest and another opposite his stomach. The depth of the cauterization should be close to the thickness of the skin, then leave the cauterization open for a long time to discharge pus.
Do not neglect the patient's treatment after cauterization with what is necessary to ensure both meanings are addressed, thus hastening recovery. The shape of the cautery used for the back should be nail-shaped as previously described, and the one used for the abdomen should be olive-shaped.
Chapter Thirty-Two.
Regarding the treatment of foot and leg injuries.
If they become swollen in edema and fill with yellow fluid, it is necessary to cauterize the back of the foot at the indentation between the little toe and the next one.
And hold your hand with the cautery and do not tilt it, then raise your hand and do not repeat it at all, for the yellow fluid will drain. The cautery should be in this form.
Then cauterize the legs with four cauteries, two on each leg. The cautery should be done with the sharp end of the cautery and should follow the length of the leg, one above the knee and another below it towards the middle of the thigh. On each thigh, perform two cauteries.
Leave the cauterization open without treatment for a long time until fluid drains from it, then treat it with all that has been mentioned.
Chapter Thirty-Three.
Regarding the treatment of diarrhea with cautery.
If the diarrhea is caused by cold and humidity, weakening the forces that hold and digest in the stomach and intestines, and it has been treated with various methods but there is no improvement, and if you see the patient as capable of enduring cautery and having abundant strength, cauterize him with a large cautery on his abdomen. As previously described for cauterizing the abdomen with a circular cautery and four gentle cauteries around the navel using a fine spiral-shaped cautery, and one large cautery or two on the upper part of the buttocks over the rectum.
If you find the humors abundant and the patient capable of bearing it, cauterize him with a cautery on the pubis and a cautery on each flank; and perhaps you may add two small cauteries near the stomach close to the larger ones. This is a successful treatment whose benefit God willing will not be mistaken.
Chapter Thirty-Four.
On Cauterizing Hemorrhoids of the Rectum.
If there are chronic hemorrhoids in the rectum, whether numerous or single, and they consist of thick, cold humors or corrupted moisture, and if treatment as described in the classification has not been effective, then cauterize the patient with three cauteries at the lower part of the lumbar region below the table (a reference to a specific anatomical landmark), forming a triangle.
Apply a cautery under the navel, about two fingers below it. If you determine that his stomach has become cold and his food is not digesting, and if you see his face swollen, then cauterize him on the stomach with a large cautery as previously described, and apply a cautery to his liver. Apply another cautery to his spleen with a spiral-shaped cautery. Leave the cauterization open for some time, then treat him until he is cured, God willing.
Chapter Thirty-Five.
On Cauterizing Warts.
After cutting it, if the wart has been cut, then heat the cautery that resembles a needle and insert it while hot into the cut wart. Proceed until the cautery reaches the mouth of the sweat gland from which blood flows. Do this once or twice.
If there are many warts, make a cauterization for each as described, then treat them with ointments appropriate to them until they heal. If you apply a large cautery on cotton, it will be more effective.
Chapter Thirty-Six.
On cauterizing the fistula that is in the buttocks and its surroundings.
If the patient does not respond to the incision and treatment described in its place and is reluctant to undergo it, he may heal through cauterization. If a fistula discharges pus and corrupted moisture over time, the first thing you should do is measure it with a thin probe.
Then determine the depth of the fistula with the probe. Heat the cauterizing iron that resembles a mill and insert it into the fistula while hot, along the depth and direction where the probe was inserted. Repeat the cauterization until all the corrupted substances are burned, once or twice or three times as needed.
Be careful not to burn any nerve if there is one, or a major vein. If the fistula leads to the bladder or intestines, be especially cautious.
Be careful of all these areas. You should do this only if the fistula is in a fleshy part and you determine that it does not penetrate deeply. Then treat the area until it heals. If the affected area closes off, no longer discharges any matter, and remains like this for some time, then know that it has healed completely.
If the fistula continues to discharge matter, know that it penetrates deeply or that there is a corrupted bone within it, or something similar which will be mentioned later in its place.
Chapter Thirty-Seven.
On the Diagnosis of Renal Calculi.
If pain occurs in the kidneys due to cold or strong wind, and as a result, the patient's condition worsens, it is necessary to cauterize the affected area on the back over each kidney using the spiral cautery previously mentioned. This may need to be done three times at the same session; thus, three cauterizations are placed in succession, which is more effective for healing.
Chapter Thirty-Eight.
On the Cauterization of the Bladder.
If weakness and relaxation occur in the bladder due to cold and humidity, causing the patient to be unable to control urination, cauterize once below the navel over the bladder where the pubic hair begins, and twice on either side of the navel.
The cauterization should be at a distance from the navel on each side equal to the width of a thumb joint. Additionally, cauterize once at the base of the spine or twice if necessary, and use the spiral cautery as previously described.
Chapter Thirty-Nine.
On the Cauterization of the Uterus.
If a substance forms in the uterus due to cold and humidity, causing infertility or difficulty in conceiving, or if pain occurs during conception, it is necessary to cauterize three times around the navel as described for the cauterization of the bladder. Apply cautery to the cotton below the back, either one or two applications, and the iron should be needle-shaped.
Chapter Forty.
On how to dislocate the hip.
Moisture may cause the hip to become dislocated, and its sign is that one leg becomes longer than the other when compared. You will find a hollow where the dislocation has occurred, and it is necessary to cauterize the affected area with a semi-circular cautery near the hip itself.
After applying the ink around the area as it rotates so that the exact spot of the hip is at the center of the circle, if you have the cautery previously described for cauterizing the stomach, use it. If this cautery is not available, apply three cauterizations with a large olive-shaped cautery.
Make the cautery have a depth according to the thickness of the entire skin, then treat it until it heals, if God wills.
Chapter Forty-One.
On cauterizing the sciatic nerve.
If pain occurs in the hip due to cold and moisture, and treating the patient with the methods mentioned in the division does not prove effective after some time, it is necessary to ease the patient's condition using foul-smelling seeds or prickly seeds and similar substances.
Then cauterize it, and the cautery should be done in two ways: either with caustic drugs or with fire. Cauterization with fire can be done in many ways; one of them is to apply three triangular cauterizations directly on the hip itself as shown in this figure.
It should have a suitable depth, and the distance between each burn mark should be equal to the thickness of a finger. The iron should be olive-shaped. Sometimes one burn mark is made in the middle on top of the hip itself, so there are four burn marks in total. If you wish, you can use the circular method mentioned earlier for dislocating the hip with a single burn mark.
The circle should enclose the entire hip and burn through the entire thickness of the skin. This is the method of cauterization for sciatica if the pain is confined to the hip itself and does not extend to the thigh or leg.
If the pain extends to the thigh and leg, cauterize it with two burn marks on the thigh at the place where the patient indicates the pain. One burn mark above the calf bone by four fingers towards the outer side slightly. The iron should be knife-shaped, and the depth of the burn mark should only be equal to the thickness of the skin.
If he indicates that the pain extends towards his toes, cauterize it where he points with a dot iron three or four times, or more if necessary. If he indicates the pain below the knee towards the leg, cauterize it there with one knife-shaped burn mark.
Be careful in all your cauterizations that you do not burn a nerve or a major artery, as this could cause a severe or long-lasting affliction to the patient.
I have seen one or two cases where cauterization above the calf bone was excessive, leading to severe swelling in the leg that extended to the foot. The entire leg became perforated and spoiled, followed by diarrhea and death. If the pain is on both sides, I would cauterize them both in this exact manner.
Some scholars among the philosophers mentioned a method of hip cautery, and this is its description: Make a cup from iron that resembles a cauldron with a diameter of half a handbreadth, and at its mouth it should be as thick as a date stone or slightly less. Inside that cup, there is another cup, and yet another inside it.
The distance between each of the cups should be about the width of a thumb joint, and the cups should be open on both sides. Their height should be around one or two joints, and they should have a handle made of iron that is securely attached to the cups, and this is its appearance.
Then heat it in the fire until it turns red and throw off the sparks, then place it on the affected hip while the patient lies on their healthy side. Apply three circular cauterizations at once, then leave it for three days and dress it with fat, leaving the wound open for several days.
Treat it frequently with an ointment until he recovers. The author of this book says: This type of cautery is rarely used by us due to its severity and terrifying appearance, but it is one of the good cauteries for those who can endure it and if applied to the proper location.
As for cautery with burning medicines, it involves making two cups resembling the sockets into which door hinges are inserted, made of copper or iron.
There should be a height of about two joints or so around the edges, and the distance between them should be as thick as a finger. They should be open at both the bottom and top, and some part of them should be fastened together in this manner.
Then place it on the correct side of the hip, and the patient lies on his healthy side. Grip your hand gently, then pour a little of hot water that has been warmed by fire between the two circles. Hold it for about one hour's time, and the patient must endure its burning sensation and pain, for he will feel a burning like fire.
Until the burning subsides, then raise your hand with the tool and wipe all the hot water off the hip with fresh water. Then leave it for three days and apply fat to it until the blackness of the burn disappears. Leave it for several days for pus to flow out, as this is more beneficial.
Then treat it with ointments until he heals. If the pain spreads to the thigh or leg, make a mold for him that keeps water in as you did for the hip, similarly. This is the description of hot water and I have established it in the article on preparing medicines.
Take one part each of frying salt and non-extinguished lime, crush them, and put them in a new pot that has been pierced with a small hole at the bottom, according to what the water can pass through. Place another glazed pot under the bottom of the pot.
Pour fresh water over the salt and lime to cover them by one finger, after squeezing them well with your hand. Leave the pot until hot water drips into the bottom glazed pot. Then collect all this water and pour it over a new layer of lime and salt that are also renewed.
It will then be very sharp and effective for many medical tasks and for cauterizing other organs, as it acts like fire itself. There are also medicines that can be used to cauterize the hip, such as thapsia, bladder honey, and lime with soap, which are boiled.
Galen reports a story about an ancient man who had a remedy for hip pain and sciatica, and he highly praises it, claiming that no other treatment is needed and that it cures with just one application.
In fact, he might even enter the bathhouse while being carried and leave it cured. The remedy is to take green chickpea flour; if green is not available, dry and fresh one can be used. Crush it with some fat and apply it to the affected area of the hip, thigh, or leg.
It should be tightly applied for about three hours or until the patient feels that the burning sensation has subsided. Then, take him to the bathhouse; when his body is sweating, put him in the tub. The pain will subside and he will be cured, God willing. If he is not cured, repeat the bandaging after ten days.
He will be cured, if God wills it. And know that one should not use cauterization with these medicines until the body is purged. Dioscorides mentioned that burning a patient with goat sweat is beneficial for sciatica.
Cauterization should be performed in this manner: Take wool, soak it in old oil, and place it on the deep point located between the thumb and the metacarpal bone, closer to the metacarpal bone. Then take dry goat sweat.
Light it with fire until it becomes a coal, then place it on the wool and leave it until it extinguishes. Then take another one; continue doing this until the sensation reaches the middle of the arm to the hip. The pain will subside, God willing. This type of cauterization is called goat sweat cauterization.
Chapter Forty-Two.
Regarding the pain in the back.
Back pain may arise from many causes, such as a fall, a blow, excessive vomiting, and similar conditions. It is due to the effusion of cold and moist matter, and cautery is applied specifically to this type alone.
When the pain is due to an effusion of cold matter, it is appropriate, after inducing vomiting with unpalatable substances such as bitter herbs and the like, to cauterize on the patient's back where the pain is located in three rows at the width of the table itself. Mark the area with a marker, then apply five or more cauterizations per row, depending on the patient’s tolerance and strength.
Cauterization should be done with a puncture iron. If you prefer, you can perform three or four cauterizations with an intermediate-sized nail iron in this manner.
Chapter Fifty-Three.
Regarding the cauterization for the initial stage of kyphosis.
This condition often affects young children. The initial sign in a child is difficulty breathing when standing or moving, and you will find at the end of the vertebrae a protrusion that stands out from the other vertebrae.
If you observe this and wish to prevent its progression, cauterize it with a circular cautery iron as shown in the illustration. Apply the cauterization evenly on all sides of the vertebra. If you prefer, you can perform cauterizations around the vertebra with a puncture iron in two or three rows, with the points close to each other. Then treat the area until it heals as mentioned.
Be cautious about using cauterization in a hump caused by nerve spasms.
Chapter Forty-four.
On cauterization of gout and joint pains.
If the joint pains are due to cold humidity that settles in any part of the body, and if these pains occur in the legs, it is customary for physicians to call this condition gout specifically.
If cold gout is treated with various treatments mentioned in the classification and the pains do not subside, then cauterization can alleviate them. This involves cauterizing around the knee joints after vomiting, using many cauteries. The cautery should be olive-brown and of medium size, as shown in this figure.
If it is necessary to cauterize the surface of the leg, do so with a puncture cautery. If the pains rise to the knees or other joints, which often happens, cauterize each knee with three or four cauteries from each side using this olive-colored cautery.
If more cauterization is needed, proceed with caution and do not go deep; it should be no deeper than the thickness of the skin. If the pains rise to the hips or back, use the cauterization methods described in that section.
If the pains are only in the hands, puncture around the wrists in two rows. If the pains remain in the fingers, puncture each joint once and the heel of the hand. If the pains rise to the elbows or shoulders after days, follow the same procedure for those areas.
Treat them from all sides, and do not leave the patient without proper management and medication. For if he improves his diet and expels phlegm, then he will be cured with this cauterization, God willing.
Chapter Forty-five.
On Cauterizing Hernias.
If a hernia appears in the groin and part of the intestines and fat descends to the testicle, and this is recent and slight, you should order the patient to abstain from food for a day and use laxatives to evacuate the bowels.
Then have him lie down in front of you on his back and order him to hold himself so that the fat or intestines protrude, then push them back with your finger. Then mark with ink under the hernia on the pubic bone a sign resembling a semicircle, its tips pointing upwards towards the body.
Then heat the cautery, which has this shape.
Heat it until it becomes white and free from sparks, then push the intestines or fat back into the abdomen. Then have a servant place his hand on the area to prevent the intestines from protruding again. Spread the patient's legs apart and place a cushion under him, and another servant to secure his legs.
And another servant on his chest to restrain his hands. Then place the cautery on the same mark and press it firmly with the cautery standing upright, holding it until it reaches the bone or returning it once if it does not reach the bone on the first attempt.
Save your effort from the protrusion of the flesh while cauterizing, lest you burn it, which may cause either death or a great calamity for the patient. Know that if you do not reach the bone with the cauterization, your work will not be successful, and the cautery should be fine for children according to their measure and for adults according to their measure.
Then treat the site of the cauterization after three days with ghee until the redness from the fire subsides, then treat it with other ointments until it heals. Let the patient lie on his back for forty days until the wound is fully healed.
You should make his diet during the treatment consist of foods that soften his stomach to prevent the protrusion of the intestines when straining or defecating. Then, if he wishes to stand up after forty days, use a firm bandage and keep him bound for another forty days, while reducing his exertion, overeating, drinking excessively, and shouting loudly.
If this treatment is followed as described, he will be completely cured, God willing. I will mention the treatment of hernias by incision in its appropriate section, God willing. As for a hernia that occurs elsewhere in the abdomen and is recent, if you wish to prevent it from worsening, apply a round cauterization over it according to its size. Let what you burn from the skin be one-third of its thickness, then treat it as mentioned, and it will not worsen, God willing. Some early practitioners have mentioned that a hernia should be cauterized with a triangular cautery in this manner.
After treating the hernia with a poultice, draw a line horizontally at the top of the hernia and another line downwards. Then, insert your hand in the middle with one nail-shaped cauterization. The first method is easier and better, God willing.
Chapter Forty-Six.
In the Preparation of Purge.
If pain occurs in any organ due to a fall or blow, and the pain persists for a long time without being relieved by medication, it is necessary to cauterize with a cautery. Each organ should be treated according to its size, whether large or small, and according to its strength or weakness.
If the pain persists and does not respond to the initial cauterization, repeat the process because it is characteristic for such pains to move to nearby organs. Therefore, follow them with cauterization until the patient recovers.
Chapter Forty-Seven.
On Cauterizing Leprosy.
Those suffering from leprosy can benefit greatly from cauterization, especially those with a type of leprosy that results from the putrefaction of phlegm and black bile.
If you wish to cauterize them, examine the case. If the leprosy is in its initial stage and has not improved with the treatments mentioned in the classification, and if you fear that corruption may spread throughout their constitution, then cauterize the head with five applications. The first one in the middle of the head, as is known. The second one below it near the forehead at the end of the hair. Two on the temples, and one at the back on the nape of the neck. Apply the cauterization slightly deeper so that it affects the bone to a slight degree.
And the scabs are removed to facilitate the passage of thick vapors, and it is cauterized as previously described on the same spleen area. As for when leprosy persists in the patient and becomes clearly visible, it should be cauterized with the cauteries we mentioned for the head. A cautery on the tip of the nose, two cauteries on each cheek, two on the vertebrae of the neck, six on the vertebrae of the back, one large one at the coccyx near the tailbone, and another above it in the same area, and two on each hip, one on each. Two on each knee, one on each knee, two on each shoulder, two on each elbow, two on the ribs of the chest, and cauterize at every joint of his fingers and toes with a cautery, and on each heel of his feet and the wrists of his hands.
Be careful of the nerve at the back of the heels so as not to burn them, and it may be cauterized on the pubic bone, another on the mouth of the stomach, and another on the liver. Know that the more cauteries you apply, they become more beneficial and effective.
And know that the patient does not feel pain from cauterization as a healthy person would because his body is numb, and it is necessary for the cauteries to be of large and small sizes according to the organs and joints as previously described in the characteristics of the instruments.
Then treat the cauterization with flour of lupine mixed with honey and continue all other treatments until he is healed, if God wills.
Chapter Forty-Eight.
When a part of the body becomes numb and does not improve with medications, ointments, or dressings, then the affected part should be cauterized according to the size of the bone it contains, whether large or small. The cauterization should penetrate slightly into the thickness of the skin.
Then treat it with ointment until it heals. For some numbness in the hand or foot, cauterization may be applied to the vertebrae from which the nerve that moves that part of the body originates, and this will remove the numbness.
This should only be done by one who is knowledgeable about the anatomy of the organs and the origins of the nerves that move the body.
Chapter Forty-Nine.
On Cauterizing Leukoderma.
If leukoderma persists and no medical treatment is effective, cauterize it with a slight depth according to the thickness of the skin until the whiteness disappears and its color changes.
Then treat it with flour of lentils mixed with rose oil, rue leaves, and the blood of a dove or sparrow; take an equal part of each, mix them together, apply them to a cloth, and place it on the affected area until it heals.
Chapter Fifty.
On Cauterizing Cancer.
If cancer is in its initial stage and you wish to stop its progression, cauterize it with a round iron around the perimeter. Some wise men have suggested applying a deep cauterization in the center, but I do not recommend this because I anticipate that it may cause ulceration, as I have observed this happening on several occasions.
The correct procedure is to cauterize around it in a circle as we have said, or with many small cauterizations.
Chapter Fifty-One.
On Cauterizing the Appendix.
If it happens that someone has an appendix that is slow to mature, whether due to the quality that promotes its development or due to the age of the patient if they are elderly with little blood, or due to time, and you wish to hasten the maturation of the appendix, then cauterize around it with many small cauterizations, like dots.
Then leave it, as it will mature more quickly. If you wish to cauterize it thoroughly, heat the cautery instrument which has this shape.
Insert it into the middle of the appendix until it penetrates the skin. Let the cauterization be from below to facilitate the flow of pus, then treat it as necessary until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-Two.
On Cauterizing Ulcers.
An ulcer is a corruption that advances in the organ, consuming it as fire consumes dry wood. If you see an ulcer in a place where cauterization with fire is possible, heat many cautery instruments of various sizes, both large and small, according to what is suitable for the location of the ulcer.
Then cauterize it from all sides until the entire corruption is completely removed and nothing remains. Then leave it for three days, and apply crushed sulfur mixed with oil to the cauterized areas until all scabs and decay are thoroughly removed.
Then treat it with salves that promote flesh growth. If after three days you see that the flesh grows properly without any corruption, do not repeat cauterization. However, if there is still corruption in some places, reapply cauterization to those areas, and treat the ulcer with a sharp remedy.
For it acts as fire more quickly and effectively. I have mentioned its treatment with a sharp remedy in the division, so take it from there when you need it.
Chapter Fifty-Three.
On Cauterizing Reverse and Non-Reverse Nails.
This condition often occurs on the soles of the feet; it is rough and causes pain. Cauterization for it can be done in two ways: either by fire or by sharp water.
As for cauterization by fire, it is done by heating a concave iron tool resembling an eagle's feather, which is made of iron and fits around the nail from all sides with a thin edge. Then place the hot tool on the nail and rotate your hand around the nail with the tool until it reaches the depth of the nail.
Leave it for three days until pus forms, then dress it with crushed wild flaxseed mixed with salt and leave the dressing on overnight. The nail will come off from its root. Then treat the wound site with a flesh-promoting salve until it heals. If the nails are not reversed.
This condition often occurs on the surface of the body, especially in the hands and feet. You should take a tube made of copper or iron or an eagle's feather and place it over the nail or growth, then pour some sharp water into the tube.
Hold your hand and turn it slightly, so that the edge of the tube affects the base of the nail, and allow the sharp water to find its way to sink to the base of the nail. The patient should endure the stinging of the sharp water for a moment.
Then leave it, for the nail will come off with its root. Do this one by one until you have dealt with all of them in the body, then treat the areas after they are removed using ointments that promote flesh growth.
Chapter Forty-Four.
On Scalding Burns.
If a person suffers from a numbness due to cold in the nerve or from fever quartan or other causes, it is necessary to scorch them four or five times on the vertebrae, a cauterization between each vertebra, and one cauterization on their chest. And scorch their abdomen with an oil-heated cautery, for the numbness will subside and the cold disease will quickly mature.
Chapter Forty-Five.
On Cauterizing Sudden Pustules in the Body.
Pustules may suddenly appear in the body due to thick, corrupted cold substances. At their first appearance, it is necessary to cauterize each pustule gently with a burning tip of an elderberry stick or the root of a long reed or with a lens-shaped cautery.
Veins may also be cauterized at the onset of their appearance in this manner, so that it does not worsen and the causative agent causing them dissipates, leading to the patient's recovery. However, this should be done after letting blood from the patient by phlebotomy.
Chapter Fifty-Six.
في كيّ النزف الحادث عند قطع الشريان.
كثيرًا ما يحدث نزف الدم من شريان قد انقطع عند جرح يظهر من الخارج أو عند شق ورم أو كي عضو ونحو ذلك، فيعسر إيقافه.
فإذا حدث لأحد ذلك فاسرع بيدك إلى فم الشريان فضع عليه إصبعك السبابة وشدّه نعمة حتى يحصر الدم تحت إصبعك ولا يخرج منه شيء ثم تضع في النار مكاوى زيتونية صغيرة وكبيرة عدة وتنفح عليها حتى تصير حامية جدًا.
ثم تأخذ منها واحدة إما صغيرة وإما كبيرة على حسب الجرح والموضع الذي انفتق فيه الشريان وتنزل المكواة على نفس العرق بعد أن تنزع إصبعك بالعجلة وتمسك المكواة حتى ينقطع الدم.
فإن اندفع عند رفعك الإصبع من فم الشريان وطفأت المكواة فخذ مكواة أخرى بالعجلة من المكاوى التي في النار المعدة ولا تزال تفعل ذلك بواحدة بعد أخرى حتى ينقطع الدم.
وتحفظ لا تحرق عصبا يكون هناك فتحدث على العليل بلية أخرى، واعلم أن الشريان إذا نزف منه الدم فإنّه لا يستطاع قطعه ولا سيما إذا كان الشريان عظيما إلا بأحد أربعة أوجه إما بالكي كما قلنا وإما ببتره إذا لم يكن قد انبتر. For when it is amputated, its ends contract and the blood stops; either it is tied tightly with threads, or medicines that stop the bleeding are applied and bandages are firmly applied.
As for those who try to stop it by tying it up or compressing it with bandages or applying burning substances and the like, it will not stop bleeding in this way at all, except rarely. If any of these things happen to someone and there is no doctor or medicine available, he should immediately place his index finger on the mouth of the wound as described.
It should be compressed very tightly until the blood congeals and stops flowing, and the finger should not be removed by cold water continuously until the bleeding stops completely. During this time, observe what may be needed for cauterization or medication.
The Second Chapter.
On Incisions, Treatments, Bloodletting, and Wounds and the Like.
Khalaf said: We have mentioned in the first chapter every disease that is suitable for cauterization with fire and burning medicines, along with their causes, reasons, tools, and shapes of cauteries, dividing them into sections from the heel to the head.
And I will follow the same approach in this chapter to make it easy for the student to understand what is required.
Before I begin, you should know, my sons, that this chapter contains more valuable information than what is in the first chapter regarding cauterization.
For this reason, it is essential to be more cautious because the work in this chapter involves frequent bloodletting, which is vital for life when opening a vein, making an incision on a tumor, draining an abscess, treating a wound, removing an arrow, or making an incision on a stone and similar procedures, all of which carry great risks and often lead to death.
I advise you to avoid doubt. Various kinds of people may come to you in this craft with different ailments; some are weary of their illness and find death easy.
Due to the severity of his illness and the long duration of his suffering, there are signs of death from his disease. Others may offer you money for their health, but their disease is incurable; therefore, it should not be permissible for you to assist those who come to you with this nature at all.
Let your caution be greater than your desire and eagerness, and do not proceed with anything unless you are certain of the knowledge regarding the desirable outcome. Use the acquisition of knowledge and warning about what leads to safety in all treatments for your patients.
Indeed, in that you will have assistance in acquiring praise and glory, fame and commendation. May God grant you, my children, guidance; may He not deprive you of correctness and success, for that is in His power alone; there is no god but He.
I have organized this chapter into sections from the heel to the head, as was mentioned in the chapter on cauterization, to make it easier for you to find what you need, if God wills.
The First Section.
On the Treatment of Water That Accumulates in the Heads of Children.
This illness often occurs in children at birth if the midwife presses the child's head too roughly. It may also arise from an unknown condition.
I have not seen this condition in anyone except children, and all those I have seen with it died quickly. Therefore, I saw fit to refrain from treating it. Indeed, I once saw a child whose head was filled with water, and the swelling of his head increased every day. Until the child could no longer hold back his excretions due to the size of his head, and the moisture continued to increase until he died.
This moisture may either collect between the skin and the bone, or it may accumulate under the bone on the membrane. If the moisture is between the skin and the bone and the swelling is small, one should make a single incision in the middle of the head horizontally, about two fingers long, to allow the moisture to drain. This is what the scalpel looks like.
If the moisture is greater and the swelling is larger, then make two intersecting incisions as shown in this figure.
If the moisture is under the bone, its sign is that you will see the sutures of the skull open on all sides, and when you squeeze it with your hand, the water flows inward. You should therefore make three incisions in the middle of the head as shown in this figure.
After the incision, all the moisture should be removed. Then, the incisions should be bandaged and dressed. From the fourth day onwards, cover it with infusions and oil. On the fifth day, remove the bandages and treat the wound with bandaging and ointments. Do not overly compress the head and feed the patient dry food with little moisture.
Until the affected area strengthens and heals. Another method for incision is to observe where the bone of the swelling and accumulation of water appear, as it may be more in the back of the head, or in the front, or on the right, or on the left.
Make the incision where the tumor or swelling with fluid is apparent, and cut as much as you can, being careful not to cut an artery, for this would cause bleeding that could lead to the patient's death due to blood loss, while expelling the moisture.
ال capítulo segundo.
Cut the two arteries behind the known ears called the temporal arteries.
When a person suffers from a severe attack affecting the eyes or the chest, and medication has been ineffective, then the most effective treatment is to cut these two arteries.
If you wish to cut them, shave the patient's head with a razor, then rub the area with a rough cloth to make the artery visible. Then tie the patient’s neck with the edge of their garment. Observe where the pulse beats; it is located in the two depressions behind the ears, which are rarely hidden except in some people.
Then mark them with ink, and cut them with a sharp scalpel down to the bone; the width of the cut should be about as wide as the head. If you prefer, insert the scalpel underneath the artery and cut upwards, and the length of the incision should be approximately two clenched fingers.
When the artery is cut, blood will flow out in a pulsating manner, advancing forward with each pulse. If the artery does not become visible to the touch, you should measure about three finger breadths from the ear, then mark it with ink and cut down to the bone. What should be noted is that.
The bleeding should continue for six watches (approximately six hours) on average, though it may last longer or shorter depending on the patient's strength and the fullness of their arteries. Then examine the wound; if any part of the peritoneum remains attached to the bone, cut it away.
To prevent inflammation, bind the wound with a strip of linen bandage and treat it with ointments until it heals.
Chapter Three.
Cut the two arteries in the temples.
If a person suffers from chronic migraine or acute attacks caused by harmful humidity and heat in the temple muscles, or severe chronic headache and similar conditions, and if treatment with various medical methods fails, we have found that cutting or cauterizing the arteries in the temples, as described, can be effective for these diseases.
The procedure for cutting them is to shave the hair from the temples of the patient, and then locate the visible artery in the temple, as it will be apparent due to its pulsation; rarely does it remain hidden except in a few individuals.
Or, if the weather is very cold and it is difficult for you to locate the artery, have the patient tie his neck with a part of his garment, then rub the area with a cloth or apply hot water to the area until the artery becomes clearly visible. Then take the scalpel whose image is shown here. Then, gently cut the skin with it until you reach the artery, then insert a needle into it and pull it upwards until it is removed from the skin and free from the fascia beneath it on all sides. If the artery is thin, bend it with the tip of the needle. Then cut a portion of it according to the distance between its ends, ensuring that it constricts without causing bleeding. If it is not severed completely and does not stop, the blood will not clot properly. Then let out six to three qawats (a unit of measurement) of blood.
If the artery is large, it should be tied at two points with a strong doubled thread, and let the thread be either silk or horsehair so that decay does not reach it before the wound heals, thus causing hemorrhage.
Then cut away the excess between the ligatures; you may do this at that time or after some interval, and if you wish you may cauterize it with a knife-heated cautery to the bone until its extremities are severed, which will accomplish this work as we have said or even better.
Except if the patient has fever or a hot temperamental constitution, for cauterization helps to destroy moisture and is more effective in bringing benefit. After tying the arteries, fill the place with old lint and apply clean bandages; after untying them, treat with drying medicines and with fomentations until he recovers, if God wills.
If bleeding occurs from the artery during your work, proceed to cut it either by cauterization or fill the place with a compress and press firmly until the blood stops. If neither of these is available to you, apply your finger until the blood clots.
Cool the area with very cold water until the intensity subsides and then secure it as necessary. A less severe and easier method than tying the artery is to cauterize the vein with this double-edged cautery after applying medicine to the areas.
Apply the cautery very intensely until it reaches the bone and the vein is severed at two points so that there is some distance between its ends, for they will not heal with this cauterization at all. This is a picture of the cautery.
It should be as sharp as two small spoons, but much less sharp than a knife, for if it were as sharp as a knife, the cold would reach them quickly and the flesh would not tear quickly; therefore, they should have some thickness so that the heat of the fire may hold them.
It cuts the flesh quickly. This work is better than all other works, lighter and easier, and let there be between the two knives a thickness equal to that of a finger.
Chapter Four.
On the treatment of continuous hot tears flowing to the eyes.
If the tears are continuous and their flow is from the veins on the skull's outer surface, and no benefit has been derived from medical treatment with drugs, and you notice that the patient's face has turned red. He feels a crawling sensation on his forehead like the movement of ants, and his eyes are sunken and moist with their lashes wasted away due to the intensity of the tears. The initial treatment for this condition involves shaving the hair from his forehead, which is called treatment by the sword.
Then, three parallel incisions are made in the forehead along its length. Each incision is about two fingers long: one in the middle of the forehead, parallel to the length of the nose; the second a little away from the muscle movement near the temple; and the third on the opposite side.
Be careful not to cut the two arteries on the sides, and keep your hand away from where the jaws connect. There should be a distance of about three clenched fingers between each incision. Have pieces of sponge prepared or use dry cloths to stop the bleeding.
Then insert the sharp two-ended scalpel whose picture is shown here. From the incision near the cheek to the middle incision, peel off all the skin between them along with the serosa on the bone. Then do the same from the middle incision to the third incision, then remove this scalpel. And insert another instrument called a sharp knife, which is sharp on one side and smooth on the other into the first incision. This is its picture:.
And position the sharp side upwards toward the flesh attached to the skin and the smooth side towards the bone, then push it until it reaches the middle incision, cutting all vessels descending from the head to the eyes without reaching the outer surface of the skin.
Then do the same with the middle incision to the other one. After a moderate amount of blood flows, squeeze out the congealed blood from the cuts. Then in each incision, place a wick made of white cotton and put on it a dressing soaked in syrup, oil, or vinegar and oil.
To prevent a hot swelling, and on the third day loosen the bandage and use much lint with warm water. Then treat it with a paste of basilicon with rose oil and other treatments used for wounds until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Five.
On the Treatment of Tears and Discharges to the Eyes from Inside the Head.
When someone experiences frequent, severe, hot discharges to the eyes continuously, and you see the eyes becoming emaciated and small, with weakened vision, the eyelids inflamed, and the eyelashes falling out. There will be a sharp, painful ache in the depth of the head and continuous sneezing. Know from these symptoms that those substances and discharges come from many deep veins. The best treatment for this is to order the patient to have their forehead shaved, then make one incision in the middle of the forehead.
There will be a sharp, painful ache in the depth of the head and continuous sneezing. Know from these symptoms that those substances and discharges come from many deep veins. The best treatment for this is to order the patient to have their forehead shaved, then make one incision in the middle of the forehead. Or go a little wider and start the incision from the left temple to the right temple, cutting to the bone. Keep your hand away from the chewing muscles of the temples that move during chewing until the bone is exposed and all the blood is wiped clean with a sponge.
Then separate the edges of the incision with old cotton or a strip of linen, and bind it from above with bandages soaked in drink and oil to prevent a hot swelling. When you remove them and see that the hot swelling has subsided, you should scratch the bone so that flesh begins to grow in it.
Then treat it with a drying regimen that promotes flesh growth, such as taking two parts of wheat flour and four parts of colocynth, preparing an ointment from them, and using it to promote flesh growth in wounds like these.
Chapter Six.
On the Treatment of Objects That Fall Into the Ear.
Anything that falls into the ear is one of four types: either a metallic stone or something like a stone such as iron or glass; or a seed-like object such as a chickpea, nut, and the like; or a liquid substance like water, vinegar, and the like.
And if there is an animal [stone], then when it falls into the ear, a stone or something like a stone that does not exceed in the ear, face the ear towards the sun. If you see the stone, drop some of violet oil or olive oil on it, then try to remove it by moving your head or sneezing with a container. Plug the nostrils when sneezing after placing a bandage or wool around the ear and extend the ear upwards. Often, it is removed by this treatment; if not, then try to remove it with soft cerumen, which is shown in this picture.
If it comes out with the cerumen, otherwise try to remove it with a delicate hook with little curvature. If not, make a tube of copper and insert one end of the tube into the ear hole.
Plug the area around the tube with softened wax to ensure that air has no other way but through the tube. Then pull it strongly with your breath; often, this will work. If not, take some Nabataean gum or prepared bird glue in small quantity and place it at the tip of the probe.
After wrapping it tightly with cotton, then gently insert it into the ear hole after drying the ear of moisture. If it does not come out despite all the methods described, proceed to incision before a hot swelling or spasm occurs.
The method of incision is to bleed the patient initially in a controlled manner according to their strength, then seat the patient between your hands and turn their ear upwards. Make a small incision at the base of the ear near its lower cartilage.
The incision should be in the shape of a crescent until it reaches the stone, then remove it with whatever tools are available to you. Then sew up the incision as quickly as possible and treat it until it heals.
And if the object that has fallen into the ear is one of those seeds that swell and become inflamed, try to remove it using the methods mentioned. If this does not work, then take a thin, delicate scalpel in the shape shown.
Try using it to cut that type of seed fallen into the ear. Do this only if you are certain that the seed has been softened by the moisture in the ear, making it break into many small pieces, which can then be removed with a probe, a thin thread, or by suction.
As mentioned, it becomes easier to remove them. As for water entering the ear, the patient should first attempt to sneeze with cundu or if that does not work, lie down on the side of the affected ear while plugging it with a bit of old cotton; if this helps, the water will exit.
If that does not work, take many thin smooth pebbles and warm them slightly over the fire. The patient should then insert one of these stones into his ear hole while hopping on one leg, and strike another stone against the one in the ear.
He should continue doing this with each stone until all the water is removed. Alternatively, take a piece of cotton or a feather, insert one end into the ear, and hold the other end over the fire until it burns up most of it, then repeat with another feather.
Do this repeatedly until all the water comes out, or use a tube as described for removing a stone. As for extracting an animal that has entered it, if it is small like a flea or similar, treat it as mentioned in the division and so on.
If its body is large and visible to the senses, try to remove it with oil and feather spoons; this procedure is easier than anything that may occur in the ear. As for extracting worms that are generated in the ear if you have treated it as mentioned in the division regarding the article on discharges and your treatment has not been effective,
You should look at the ear in sunlight; if you see any worms, remove them with oil or soft feather spoons. If you do not see anything, take this tube whose image is shown.
It is narrow at the bottom and wide at the top. Insert the thin end into the ear as much as the patient can tolerate, then suck strongly with it; do this repeatedly until all the worms are removed. If they do not come out in response, seal around the tube with wax as I mentioned for removing a stone.
If they do not come out with the methods mentioned, use the preparations I have described, which the early practitioners used to kill worms. You will find this in the article on discharges. Your pouring of oils and medicines into the ear can be done using this apparatus; here is its image:
As you can see, it is made of silver or copper, narrow at the bottom with a small hole and wide at the top. If you wish, the tube inside the apparatus can be made of tightly crafted copper. Alternatively, you may take a rod and wind cotton firmly around one end.
Then place the oil or juice or any of these medicines in the tube while it is in the ear, then insert a wick with cotton from above and squeeze your hand moderately until the oil flows into the cavity of hearing and is felt.
Have the patient enter, and let what you pour into the ear be warmed slightly in fire. Beware that what is dripped into it should not be too cold or too hot, for the ear cannot tolerate that.
Chapter Seven.
On the Treatment of Obstructive Conditions of the Ear.
Some children may be born with their ear canals not perforated.
It may also happen to some people that there is an obstruction in the ear canal due to a wound or tissue growth, and this obstruction may be deep within the ear canal, beyond the reach of sight.
It may also appear slightly outside the ear canal and be visible. That which appears deep within the ear and is not visible is usually difficult to remove. That which is visible should have the patient's ear exposed to the sun. Observe it; if you see the obstruction clearly, then open it with a delicate scalpel. This is how it should appear:.
Its tip should be slightly broad and limited, while the rest of the scalpel is smooth on both sides so as not to harm the ear. If the obstruction is due to tissue that has grown in the ear canal, grasp it gently with a fine forceps and cut it very carefully until all the tissue is removed.
If the obstruction is deep in the ear, take a thin, smooth probe and warm it slightly over fire, then insert it into the ear canal. If you feel the obstruction and the patient feels heaviness in hearing, gently push on it.
Be cautious not to injure the nerve of the ear, then insert a wick into the ear according to the size of the opening, coating it with Egyptian ointment; do this for days until you are sure the wound has healed or take a wick, moisten it with water, and sprinkle it with powdered antimony.
Use it; if you see that the ear has become swollen with a hot swelling, then remove the wick and replace it with another wick coated in cyroti made with rose oil until the hot swelling subsides, then treat it until it heals.
If bleeding occurs, soak a sponge or cloth in cold water and place it on the ear, and use other treatments that stop the mentioned bleeding as described in the article on hemostasis.
Chapter Eight.
On the Treatment of Warts That Appear on the Eyelids.
These warts that appear on the eyelids may be moist or dry; they should be held with tweezers or a clamp and cut at their roots with scissors, then apply powdered antimony to the area.
If bleeding occurs from them, treat it with a small round iron; cauterizing after cutting is better. Often they return if any of the roots remain, but if cauterized with fire, those roots are burned away and will not return.
Chapter Nine.
On the Treatment of Temporary Catarrh in the Eyes.
It often happens that something resembling severe and hard catarrh appears in the eyes.
And thus it is called catarrh, which is the accumulation of thick moisture in the upper and lower eyelids. The procedure here is to observe; if the catarrh appears prominently on the surface of the eyelid and can move in all directions, then it is easy to manage. You should split it open by its breadth.
Then gently peel it away from all sides until it is removed, then tie it with a thread and cut it off. If you cannot cut it immediately without piercing the eyelid, it will not harm the patient. If the incision is large, stitch it up and treat it until it heals.
If the incision is small, there is no need to worry about it; the ointment will heal and seal it. If the catarrh is inclined towards the inner surface of the eyelid, turn the eyelid over and tie the catarrh with a thread without needing an incision, then trim it from all sides.
If you pierce the eyelid in the process of cutting, it will not harm. Then wash the eye with salty water after removing the catarrh and treat the area to heal it until the patient recovers.
Chapter Ten.
On the Treatment of Styes that Occur in the Eyelid.
A stye is a small, hard lump that forms in the layers of the upper eyelid. This condition occurs more frequently in children; it burdens their eyes and they often suffer from nighttime ailments, unable to look at the light of the sun. In order that the tears may run to them.
Therefore, you will often see them leaning on their faces and sleeping in that position; their eyelids are always moist, with a puffiness of the canthi visible to the eye. When you press the area with your fingers, you can feel the puffiness between the lids, and the treatment should be for the patient to place his head in your lap.
Then take a piece of linen and prepare a wick from it, and make a circle with that wick around the puffiness on all sides. Then place it over the area and press it down with your fingers on all sides to gather the puffiness within the center of the circle.
Then make a transverse incision in the middle of that moist area with a sharp scalpel, and the incision should not be larger than what is made for phlebotomy. As for its depth, you should cut through the entire skin until you reach the puffiness.
In most cases, the puffiness will protrude from the incision in the form of a white fat piece. You should pull it out with a bandage you have rolled between your fingers outward while turning your hand right and left until it is removed. Be careful not to increase the incision so that the scalpel does not injure the eye.
If the puffiness does not appear at the beginning of the incision, you should gently extend the incision a little until the puffiness appears. Then pull it out as we said earlier. After that, dip a bandage in vinegar and water, place it on the area, and secure it with a soft padding. Some people crush salt for this purpose.
He places it in the cavity of the incision to dissolve any remaining moisture, then treats it until it heals. If a hot swelling occurs in the area, he treats it with soothing dressings until it heals.
Chapter Eleven.
On Methods of Eyebrow Grooming.
If extra eyelashes grow outside the natural course beneath the normal eyelashes and remain for a long time, they harm the eye and cause various diseases such as constant tearing, drooping of the eyelids, opacity, and thickening, to the point where this can lead to blindness.
Eyebrow grooming is done in four ways: either by cauterization with fire, or with a sharp medicine as previously described in the section on cauterization, or it can be done by cutting and sewing, or using reeds, as I will mention.
You should place the patient's head in your lap, then flip the eyelid with your left hand. If it does not turn over, insert a needle with a thread at the bottom of the eyelid and pass the needle through with the thread near the hairline, pulling the thread up with the eyelid.
Flip it with a probe, then make an incision inside the eyelid below the extra hair from the larger vein to the smaller vein, then pull out the thread and place a small piece of cotton or cloth under the eyelid. Then secure the eyelid with adhesive.
Like the shape of a leaf, but it should be proportional to how much you want to raise the eyelid, as people may differ in this regard. Some may need to cut a suitable amount from the eyelid according to how much it has drooped.
And there are those who need to have less removed, all of this according to the laxity of the eyelid, then incise with the scalpel along the two lines that I taught, starting from the greater commissure to the lesser commissure, and each incision should be close to the natural hairline by about the thickness of a thread.
Then insert the forceps into one of the corners of the skin, then peel it all off, then gather the two lips with a needle and thin thread, clean the blood, and attach any remaining threads to the eyebrows with some adhesive.
If you wish to do so, otherwise it does not matter; then leave the stitching and threads for about three or four days, then treat it. If you prefer, you can leave the wound without stitches and treat it with something that dries and contracts, as the eyelid rises when the wound heals together. Stitching is better.
This is one aspect of the procedure that the earlier authors have mentioned, except that it places a burden on the patient, yet it is good work and there is no danger in it. Another aspect of the procedure is to shape the eyelid like the form of an oak leaf as described. Then raise the eyelid with three forceps, which may be separate or joined in this manner:.
Then cut any excess of the eyelid with a small scissors in this manner with moderation:.
If you cannot hold the forceps and they do not work for you, take a needle with thread and insert it in the center of the shape, and insert another thread near the greater commissure and a third thread near the lesser commissure. Then gather the threads between your fingers with moderation and raise them moderately.
Raise the entire prepared skin as we have described, then bring together the edges of the wound with sutures and treat it until it heals. If a hot swelling appears when you cut or incise, alleviate this swelling with ceroty and similar soothing ointments.
The lower eyelid may also turn inward, causing the lashes to irritate the eye. It is appropriate to use the methods mentioned for cutting, suturing, and scarring with heat or sharp medicine. Scarring with heat or sharp medicine is more effective and less burdensome on the patient than cutting and suturing, which are the most skilled methods.
Scarification with reeds is done in this manner: Turn the eyelid inside out and make an incision as described from the inner part. Then, prepare two thin pieces of reed or wood, their length equal to that of the eyelid and their width less than that of the scalpel blade.
Make small incisions at the ends on both sides where the stitches will be attached. Then gently bring together the remaining parts of the eyelid. Tighten the reeds on both sides firmly and leave it for several days. The stretched skin will die, darken, and decompose.
Until it falls off on its own; if it takes longer, cut it with scissors and treat it until it heals. When it heals, the eyelid will return to its normal position and the lashes will no longer irritate the eye. This is an image of the reeds made in this shape and size:
Chapter Twelve.
On Removing Irritating Eyelashes with a Needle.
If there is one or two hairs, the procedure is to take a thin needle and insert a fine smooth silk thread into it, then bring together its ends and tie them with a very slight knot, and let the length of the thread be about an inch.
Then, place another thin thread underneath it, shorter than the first one, and tie its ends if you wish. Then, have the patient rest their head in your lap, preferably near a source of sunlight so that the work is clearly visible, for it is delicate work. Then insert the needle with the thread into the root of the excess hair.
Then quickly pass the needle through the eyelid until it emerges above the natural hair. Then pull the thread up over the knot and insert that hair into the knot if there is one, two, or three hairs at most.
Then pull with your hand until the hair comes out along with the knot from the eyelid with the natural hair. If you pull the knot and the hair does not come out with it, pull the knot down with the thread that you placed in it until the knot comes out of the upper hole.
Then return the hair to its place and pull it out again; repeat this until you can see it at the upper hole. At that point, remove the knot and thread and pull them out, then tighten the eye and leave it tightened for two or three days so that the hair settles in place and flesh grows around it.
If the hair is short, either add a longer hair from the natural hair to lift it up with, or leave it until it grows longer over time and then raise it.

فإنك إن فعلت ذلك رجعت الشرطة بأشد مما كانت، بل استعمل فيها الأشياء التي ترخى مثل الحلبة والتنطيل بماء قد طبخ فيه خطمي وبزر الكتان ومرهم الدياخيلون قد ذوب مع شيء من الأدهان ولطخت به الفتيلة وعالجت بها.
وملاك علاجها أن تروم بكل حيلة أن لا تلتحم على الهيئة التي كانت عليها أولًا، وهذا العمل الذي ذكرنا إنما هو بعض إصلاح الشرطة لا أن ترجع هيئة المكان على حسب ما كانت تمامًا،.
Chapter Fourteen.
في علاج الشرطة التي تكون في الجفن السفلي.
هذه الشرطة التي تكون من أسفل هي التي تسمى حقيقة شرطا، وتكون طبيعية وتكون عرضية. فالعربية تكون من جرح أو شق أو كيٍ أو نحو ذلك.
The method is to take a needle with doubled thread and insert it into the flesh, passing it from the left jugular vein to the right until the thread is at both ends of the flesh. Then stretch the flesh upwards with the needle and cut it with a broad scalpel.
If the eyelid returns to its proper shape, that is sufficient; otherwise, take a probe and place it on the site of the incision, turn the eyelid with it, and make two incisions in the inner side of the eyelid, whose ends should be at the corners of the cut you made so that they meet to form a corner. Until it comes together and takes on a shape like this:
It is the Greek letter lambda, then remove that flesh so that its sharp edge is below near the eyelid. Then gather the scattered parts with two stitches using wool thread and treat it with the mentioned relaxing medicines and bandaging until it heals.
And if the band is wide from an incision or suture or cauterization, it is necessary to make a simple incision without hair of the eyelashes as mentioned earlier, then separate between the two edges with bandaging as described.
In summary, the treatment of a band whether it is from above or below should be done according to what appears to you in the appearance of the band, as it may vary greatly in form. The skilled craftsman devises a way by whatever means possible.
Until the shape is restored to its natural form or approximates it, and the disease itself will guide you to what treatment and instrument are suitable in most cases.
Chapter Fifteen.
Regarding the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or cornea.
This adhesion occurs in many people, where the upper eyelid sticks to the white of the eye, preventing its easy movement and hindering its natural functions. It is necessary to insert the tip of a probe under the eyelid.
Lift it up or stretch it with a tensioner, then cut the adhesion with a delicate scalpel that is not as sharp as usual cutting instruments but slightly blunt to avoid alarming the patient during the procedure and to prevent injury to the eye from its sharpness. Your cutting should be like peeling off that adhesion.
Wait until the eyelid returns to its natural state and the adhesion is completely removed. Then pour salty water into the eye to wash it or drip a solution of zangari medicine diluted in water into it. Finally, separate the eyelid from the eye with a cotton swab.
Place a piece of wool soaked in egg white on top of the eye. After the third day, use ointments until it heals.
Chapter Sixteen.
Regarding the excision of fingernails and the removal of excess flesh from the finger joints.
The fingernail condition can be of two types: either it is neural, resembling a hard, thin swelling; or it is non-neural, resembling solidified white moisture that breaks when touched by iron or stretched with a tensioner.
And no hook is used in either type, and you start from the larger lacrimal passage until it gradually reaches the point where it covers the pupil and prevents light and eye movement. The procedure involves having the patient place their head in your lap.
Then he opens his eyes, and you lift the eyelid with your hand. Then grasp the fingernail with a slightly curved hook and raise it up. Then take a needle and thread a strong hair from horse or ox into it, bend the tip of the needle slightly, and insert it into the center of the fingernail.
Pass it through with the needle and tie the fingernail securely with the thread, then lift it up. Separate the part of the fingernail next to the pupil using the hair as if you are spreading it out until the end, then cut off the rest at the root of the lacrimal passage with a delicate scalpel or small scissors, and leave the natural tissue of the lacrimal passage intact.
To avoid permanent tearing due to cutting it, you can lift the fingernail with the hook alone or with thread as we said, then separate its end with a smooth scalpel, whose shape is as follows:.
Be careful that the scalpel does not touch the corneal membrane to avoid causing a perforation and enlarging the pupil. After the cut, instill some powdered salt or zanjani salve into the eye and leave it for another day, then treat it as necessary until it heals.
If the fingernail is not sensitive and you cannot insert a needle or secure a hook in it, this type of fingernail is often treated with medication and heals as described in the classification. If you wish to cut it, open the patient's eye.
Take a fine, smooth, and weak-edged scalpel in this form:. Smooth the nail with it from above gently; if you find that it is becoming loose and cracking, and there is only an effect of smoothing, then drop a few drops from your container into the eye of Zangari or red sheaf or powdered salt and tighten the eye for another day.
Then repeat the procedure until it is all gone, unless a hot swelling appears in the eye, in which case leave it and treat the hot swelling until it heals. Then resume the smoothing process until it heals. As for the flesh tags of the conjunctiva:
If the tag severely irritates the eye, attach that tag with a snare and cut some of it, but do not overcut to avoid causing tearing. Then drop into the conjunctival sac red sheaf or Zangari until it heals,.
Chapter Seventeen.
On cutting warts and the excess flesh that grows in the eye.
Flesh may grow in some people's eyes, red and layered, to the point of covering the pupil or coming close to it or overflowing onto the eyelids. The eyelids may even turn outward, resembling the rose of jasmine.
The procedure involves the patient placing their head in your lap, then opening their eyes, and you lift that entire red flesh with appropriate forceps.
Or hold it with tweezers or a needle, then cut the flesh bit by bit until all of it is removed, being careful not to harm the eye during the procedure. You may cut it either with the scalpel we described for cutting nails or with a small scissors. As you will see its illustration in the following chapter.
When the cutting is complete and all the bleeding has stopped, fill the eye with powdered salt or sprinkle it with red powder and similar medicinal powders. Apply a pad of cotton held in place by egg white externally to prevent inflammation.
If some bleeding continues and blood overwhelms, fearing inflammation, leave the eye and treat it with what calms the inflammation. Then return to work on it until it heals. Do the same for excess flesh that appears in the eye of this type.
However, you should avoid treating any weak eye by nature or appearance with ironwork, and do not proceed with any of these treatments until you are sure that the organ can withstand such work.
Chapter Eighteen.
On Removing Foreign Bodies from the Eye.
Foreign bodies are red veins that form on the eye, obstructing vision and weakening the eye over time. You should first examine if the eye containing the foreign body is strong and does not have any other illness besides the foreign body.
Then, to remove them, instruct the patient to place their head in your lap. Grasp those veins with one or two forceps according to your skill. The forceps should have fine curved tips as shown in this illustration:.
Or they may be double-forceps in one body as shown in this illustration:.
Then, with a fine pair of scissors, carefully extract those veins and wipe the blood from time to time until you see that those veins have been removed and the blood has become clear. Be cautious not to harm the eye with the tips of the scissors, and let your work be done in half a day facing the sun.
And be very diligent in your work so that you do not cut anything other than those veins. When you finish, instill green or red myrrh into the eye to clear what remains of the passages; if you are unable to extract everything at that time, then dress the eye with something that alleviates its pain.
And leave it for days until the pain subsides and you are safe from inflammation. Then repeat this procedure in the same manner until the pain is completely alleviated by this method of the scissors.
And leave it [with the patient's head in the lap of the student and another wiping away the tears and observing the front and back of the eye closely] while you, as the instructor, should open the eye with retractors that are fixed or triangular which the assistant holds.
Gentleman, with the patient's head in the lap of the student and another wiping away the tears and observing the front and back of the eye closely, you have the option to start the extraction from the top of the eye or from the bottom. It is preferable to secure two clamps at the top, one at the end of the eyelid and the other at its beginning.
And hold them between the middle and index fingers, then attach clamps below them. Hold them between the little finger and the ring finger, lifting your hand slightly until you see that all the passages have risen. Cut from the lesser wing if you use scissors, or with a fine scalpel if preferred.
And the catheter is inserted into the needles, and all paths are cleared until it rises above the clitoris, but do not cut off the secretion because the tears and blood will soften for you.
Then cut with scissors what exceeds the crown, both above and below, until nothing remains embedded except in the cornea. If possible, raise it from the cornea using a catheter; this is better. It may be appropriate for some people.
And when you cut it, its place will be inflamed for days, the pain subsides, and then the hot swelling improves. Then repeat the procedure on it.
Chapter Nineteen.
On Replacing the Septum of the Nose.
The physicians call the septum "naṣūra." If you treat it with cauterization or with a sharp, burning medicine as previously described and it does not heal, then the only remedy is to incise the abscess when it is ripe and remove all the moisture inside or the pus.
Until the bone is exposed. When the bone is exposed and you see decay or blackening in it, then remove it with a tool whose shape is as follows:.
It is called the coarse-headed instrument, made of Indian iron, with its head rounded like a button, engraved with fine engravings similar to those on scissors. Place it on the site of the decay in the bone and rotate it between your fingers while slightly tightening your hand until you know that the decay has been removed.
Do this repeatedly, then secure the area with drying and astringent medicines. If the area heals, flesh grows in it, and no discharge occurs over time, and it remains for forty days without recurring or any incident happening.
Know that he is cured, otherwise there is no remedy but to return the nasal fistula to the nostril in this manner: by reopening the bone either with an instrument or a sharp medicine. When the bone is exposed again, take a bifurcated probe of this form:.
Make the tip of the probe triangular, and its body conical, tapering to the end as you see. Then place it on the bone itself, near the throat, but keep your hand a little away from the eye. Then move your hand with the probe until it passes through the bone and the patient feels it.
When he finds that air comes out when he pinches his nose. At this moment, treat the area with astringent and drying medicines as I have taught you. Once the flesh has grown back and the place has hardened, the material that was protruding externally will return to the inside of the nose, which will be easier for the patient, God willing.
Chapter Twenty.
On the Treatment of Eye Protrusions.
If the eye protrudes without affecting vision or causing any deficiency, it is advisable to ease the patient and then administer a purgative. Then place a cupping vessel on the back of the head without any specific condition and perform gentle suction.
Then apply a poultice to the eye made of acacia, sage, frankincense, and asarum. Then secure the eye from above with many bandages. The method for preparing the bandages is to take soft linen strips and fold each one four times to make many bandages.
Then place one on top of the other as much as the eye needs, then tie a firm cloth tightly around it and repeat the bleeding process without restriction. Then remove the bloodletting instrument and leave the eye tied for a day and night.
If the bandage becomes loose during this time, it should be retightened. Remove the bandage after a day and night as we said. If you see that the eye has improved, otherwise, repeat the dressing, medication, tightening, and bloodletting until it improves.
Chapter Twenty-One.
On Cutting the Urethra.
If a hernia appears in the urethral layer, then it protrudes and emerges outside the eyelids like a grape, disfiguring the person's appearance, and you wish to cut it, the procedure should be as I describe.
The procedure is to insert a needle into the base of the hernia from bottom to top, then insert another needle with a doubled thread from the side of the neck and pass it through, leaving the first needle in place.
Then cut where the thread is doubled and use it to tie part of the hernia around the needle, tightening it well. Then remove the needle and place wet wool soaked in egg white over the eye. Leave it until the threads fall off with the hernia, then treat the eye with what strengthens it.
Until the wound heals. The hernia can be tightened from all sides with a circular bandage to strengthen the eye well, then it is dressed with a thin scalpel that reaches the bottom of the eye to drain the white moisture and lower the eye until it shrinks in place, then tighten it until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Two.
في علاج الكمينة.
هذه العلة التي تسمى الكمنة إنما هي مدة تجتمع في العين تشبه الماء النازل وليس به، ووجه العمل في ذلك أن تقعد المريض على كرسي منتصبا ثم تأخذ رأسه بيديك من الجهتين.
وتحركه حتى ترى المدة تصير إلى أسفل بعينك ثم تثبت ولا تزول وينطلق النور ويري العليل الأشياء كما كان يراها، وإن لم تنزل إلى أسفل علمنا أنّه الماء، فإن لم يتهيأ نزول المدة بما ذكرنا.
وإلا فأجلس المريض بين يديك ثم خذ مبضعا رقيقا وشق به فوق الغشاء القorneal قليلا عند اتصال الملتحم بالغشاء القorneal في الإكليل حتى تخرج المادة.
When it comes out, sprinkle hot water on the eye in which honey has been mixed or water in which fenugreek and honey have been boiled, then treat with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Three.
We have mentioned the types of water in the division and which is suitable for distillation with detailed explanation, so take it from there for correctness. At that time, you should seat the patient cross-legged facing a source of light near the sun.
Bind his healthy eye and tighten it well, then lift the eyelid of his affected eye with your left hand if it is his left eye or with your right hand if it is his right eye.
Then place the tip of the syringe near the cornea, about the thickness of a strand of hair in the white part of the eye towards the inner corner, then push the syringe with force while rotating it with your hand until it penetrates the white of the eye and you feel that the syringe has reached an empty space.
It is important that the depth to which the syringe goes should be equal to the distance from a child's forehead to the back of their head, which is the cornea. Since the copper can be seen clearly through the transparency of the corneal membrane, then move the syringe upwards to the area where the water is.
Then push it downward repeatedly. If the water comes out immediately, the patient will see whatever has come into view for them at that moment with the syringe still in their eye, and then rest for a while. If the water rises again, let it out a second time without removing the syringe.
And when it settles and does not rise, then remove the syringe gently while you twist it slightly with your hand little by little; then dissolve a small amount of refined Andiran salt in water and wash the eye with it from inside, then place over the entire outer surface of the eye a wet cloth or wool.
Apply rose ointment and egg white, and bandage the healthy eye with it. As for us and our contemporaries, we apply ground cumin mixed with egg white. If the syringe does not enter the eye due to its hardness, because some people have eyes that are extremely hard. It is appropriate to take the scalpel called al-birad, which has this shape:.
Puncture only the conjunctiva with it and do not make a deep incision; simply tap gently to create an entry point for the syringe, then insert the syringe as previously described. When your work is complete, prepare for the patient a secure lying position where he can sleep on his back in a dark room.
He must abstain from all movements and from coughing, and his food should be what softens his nature. He must not move his head left or right at all. The bandage remains in place until the third day, after which it is removed in that dark room, and his sight is tested.
Show him objects, then replace the bandage until the seventh day. It should not be done at treatment time or immediately after puncturing; rather, it is advisable to avoid this before as water rises quickly due to intense staring.
If a hot swelling occurs, you should remove the bandage before the seventh day and treat it with something that calms the swelling. Once the swelling subsides, then release his sight and place a veil over his face through which he can see from underneath for several days while in that dark room.
He is taken out of the house gradually and adapts to its causes, and know that the practitioner cannot do without observation many times, so he proceeds to work. I have heard from some Iraqis that they make in Iraq a funnel-like device that absorbs water.
I have not seen anyone in our country make this, nor have I read about it in any of the ancient books. It may be a recent invention. This is an image of various types of funnels for those who are unfamiliar with them:.
It is made of copper specifically, and its tip should be this thin, triangular and sharp,.
Chapter Twenty-Four.
On the Treatment of Excess Tissue in the Nose.
Various types of excess tissue may grow in the nose, some resembling long-legged scorpions, others being hard and cancerous-looking, pale in color, and there is also soft tissue that is not pale in color.
For the soft tissues that are not harmful or cancerous, you should have the patient sit in front of you facing the sun, then open their nostril and insert a hook into those tissues. Then pull them out and cut what you can reach with a fine, sharp scalpel from one side.
Continue until you are sure that all the tissue has been removed. If there is any part left that you cannot cut, remove it gently with one of the fine instruments so that nothing remains. If bleeding becomes overwhelming or a hot swelling occurs,
Oppose it as necessary or if it is among malignant tumors, then proceed to remove them until the bleeding stops and all the flesh is gone. Then after cutting, pour vinegar and water or a drink into the nose, for if the nose opens, the moisture will pass through to the throat.
Know that he has recovered, but if the moisture does not pass as necessary, know that there is new flesh growing inside at the top of the porous bones, which the instrument did not reach. In this case, you should take a linen thread of some thickness.
Make many knots in it, with a space of the length of a finger or less between each knot. The patient should then insert one end of the thread into his nose using a pledget or whatever means he can, after making it like a button, and pull it until it reaches the nostril.
And pull it out through his throat; often children do something like this in school, and it is easy for whoever wishes to do it. Then gather the ends of the thread: one end that came out of the mouth and the other that remained in the nose.
Then use the knots in the thread to cut the flesh, doing this until you know that the flesh has been severed by the knots in the thread. Then remove the thread and place a candle wick soaked in Egyptian ointment in the nose after cleaning the blood; do this for three days or longer.
Until the ointment eats away all that remains of the flesh. Then place a lead tube in the nose for days until it heals. If it needs treatment to dry out the area, use that.
This is a picture of the instrument used to extract fats and medicines from the nose:.
It is made of silver or copper, resembling a small lamp with an open fat container and its channel designed similarly.
And if you prefer, you can make the tube closed like a trachea and the fat container of the instrument flat.
It has a handle at the end as you can see, which is held when the fat or any desired juices or liquid substances are heated inside it.
Chapter Twenty-Five.
On warts growing at the tip of the nose.
Often, a wart grows at the tip of the nose, it enlarges and increases over time until it becomes unsightly.
Therefore, it is necessary to cut it at the first sign of its appearance and remove it completely, then treat the area either by cauterization or with a burning medicine that serves as an alternative to cauterization. If you miss cutting it until it grows large, examine it; if it is hard and solid like blackened flesh, with little sensation.
Do not treat it with iron, for it is a cancerous tumor. I have often seen those who cut this tumor suffer great harm as a result. If the swelling is soft and non-blackened in appearance, I have found that cutting it entirely is possible. Induce the patient to vomit and cut it without hesitation, and treat the area with substances that dry and contract until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Six.
On Suturing the Nose, Lip, and Ear. If its connection is severed by a wound or something similar, know that if a separation occurs in any of these cartilages, there is little chance that treatment will be effective except for some individuals.
When any of these occur, if the wound is fresh and bleeding, you should suture the edges of the wound together and then treat it until it heals. If the connection has already separated and each side is healthy, you should incise each side to a depth equal to the thickness of the outer skin until there is bleeding.
Then, suture the two sides together and secure them. Apply powdered mastic and frankincense to it, and place a poultice of Aleppo ointment or another adhesive ointment on top. Leave it tightly bound for two or three days, then remove the binding.
Change the dressing and leave it until the sutures come out on their own, then treat it with ointment until it heals. The method of suturing is to bring together the separated parts either with needles as described in the suturing of the abdomen or with thread as I have explained there.
Chapter Twenty-Seven.
On Removing Knots That Occur in the Lips.
Many people may develop small, hard tumors inside their lips, some resembling millet seeds and others varying in size. You should turn the lip inside out and incise each knot with forceps.
And it is cut from every direction, then the place is filled after cutting with powdered aconite until the bleeding stops, then rinse with vinegar and salt, and treat the places with something that causes contraction until the wounds heal.
Chapter Twenty-Eight.
On Cutting Excess Tissue in the Gums.
Excess tissue often grows on the gums, which Apollonius called "abulus." It is necessary to attach it with a fishhook or hold it with tweezers and cut it at its base. Allow time for any bleeding to stop, then apply powdered aconite to the area.
Or apply one of the dried astringents. If the tissue returns after treatment, it often recurs, so cut it again and cauterize it; then it will not return after cauterization.
Chapter Twenty-Nine.
On Cleaning Teeth with Iron.
Crude and ugly scales may accumulate on the surfaces of teeth, both inside and outside, and between the gums. These can cause discoloration, turning black, yellow, or green, leading to deterioration of the gums and making the teeth unattractive as a result.
It is necessary to seat the patient between your hands, with their head in your lap. Then clean the tooth and the part where the scales and something like sand appear until nothing remains. Do the same for black, green, yellow, and other discolorations until they are completely cleaned.
Then remove what is in it from the first scraping, and if not, repeat the scraping on another day and a second and third until you reach your desired goal. And know that the tooth requires scrapings of different forms and many shapes according to what is prepared for your work.
For the scraper used to scrape the inside of the tooth is different from the one used to scrape the outside, and the one used between the teeth is of another form. Here are several forms of scrapers that you should have all prepared:.
Chapter Thirty.
On Extracting Teeth.
It is advisable to treat the tooth for its pain with every possible method and hesitate before extracting it, for there is no substitute once it is pulled out, as it is a precious substance. Even if extraction becomes inevitable.
If the patient decides to extract it, you should be cautious and ensure that the tooth is indeed the cause of the pain. Often, the patient is misled by the pain and assumes it is in a healthy tooth, so they extract it, but the pain does not subside until the diseased tooth is removed. We have seen this happen repeatedly due to the actions of barbers.
If you are certain that the pain is specifically in the tooth, then you should outline around the tooth with a sharp scalpel to loosen the gum from all sides. Then gently rock it back and forth with your fingers or with delicate forceps little by little until it becomes loose.
Then firmly grasp it with the large forceps, and position the patient's head between your knees to stabilize it. Pull the tooth straight to avoid breaking it. If it does not come out, take one of those tools and gently but firmly insert it under the tooth from all sides as you did initially.
And if the tooth is perforated or decayed, you should fill that hole with a piece of cloth and seal it properly with a thin end of cotton so that it does not disintegrate when you tighten it with forceps. And you should examine around the gums on all sides carefully. Amen.
Be careful with your effort so that you do not break it, leaving some of it behind, which would cause greater harm to the patient than their initial pain. Beware of acting like the foolish practitioners who, without using the methods we have described, attempt to extract teeth without caution.
They often cause people great harm, the least of which is that the tooth breaks and its entire root or part of it remains. Or it may happen that part of the jawbone is pulled out along with the tooth, as we have witnessed many times. After extracting the tooth, rinse your mouth with a beverage or vinegar and salt. If bleeding occurs from the site, which often happens, crush some aloeswood and apply it to the area.
Otherwise, if the aloeswood does not help you, here are images of delicate forceps used to move the tooth; initially they should have long prongs, short handles, and be sturdy so that they do not bend when you grip the tooth with them. Here are also images of larger forceps:
They should have thick handles so that when you grip them, they do not give way or bend. The prongs should be short and made of Indian iron or tempered steel, with teeth at the end that interlock to provide a firm and secure grasp.
And the limbs can be made like the cooling instrument and will also be strong and precise.
Chapter Thirty-One.
On Extracting the Roots of Molars and Removing Broken Jawbones.
If the root remains after extracting the tooth and it has broken, you should place a piece of cotton soaked in fat on the area for one or two days until it relaxes. Then insert the probe or forceps into it. Which resembles the beak of a bird called the bulbul, and this is an image of the forceps:.
It should be made like a cooling instrument on the inside or like a small lever. If it is not possible to remove it with these forceps, you should dig around the root and completely expose the flesh with a scalpel, then insert the tool that resembles a small lever, which has this image:.
Short at the end, slightly thick, and not too flexible so that it does not break. If the root is removed with this, otherwise use these other tools which have this image, the first one having a triangular tip with some thickness:.
An image of another delicate triangular tool:.
We may also use this two-pronged instrument which also has this image:.
And other tools and instruments mentioned earlier for examining teeth. We may also use this tool that resembles a large fishing hook, which has this image:.
Triangular at the end, slightly curved and thick so that it does not break, and should not be too flexible. Know that there are many tools for teeth, and similarly other instruments are numerous and cannot be counted; a skilled craftsman may invent his own tools according to what he is guided by in his work and the diseases themselves.
For there are diseases for which the ancients have not mentioned instruments due to the variety of their types; therefore, if a bone in the jaw or one of the bones in the mouth is broken or becomes necrotic, examine it at its place with an instrument suitable for this purpose and with clamps as mentioned in the extraction of roots.
And we use this substance whose picture is as follows:
It should have some thickness to control the bone so that it does not slip until the bone is removed, and we treat the area with appropriate medicines. If the bone has slight decay or blackening, remove it completely until it is clean, then treat it until it heals.
Chapter Thirty-Two.
On the Eruption of Teeth Growing Misaligned.
If the teeth erupt out of their natural course, they become disfigured by this appearance, especially if it happens in women and slaves. It should be examined; if the tooth has erupted behind another tooth, then appropriate action should be taken.
If it is not possible to spread it out or to return it to its proper place, then remove it. If it is attached to another tooth, cut it with this instrument whose picture is as follows:.
It resembles a small beak and should be made of sharp Indian iron. The cutting should be done over several days due to the hardness of the tooth and to avoid disturbing other teeth. As for its straightening, use a spatula made of Indian material whose picture is as follows:.
It should be made entirely of Indian material, with a thin and delicate blade similar to that used for making needles. Use it to straighten the tooth little by little over many days gently so as not to dislodge the tooth and cause it to fall out. Finally, smooth it and clean it with some polishing tools.
And if a tooth has broken and is causing irritation to the tongue when speaking, it should also be smoothed until the roughness of the break disappears, becomes even, and smooth, so that it does not irritate the tongue or impair speech.
Chapter Thirty-Three.
On joining loose teeth with silver or gold threads.
If the front teeth become loose or shift due to a blow or fall, and the patient is unable to bite on anything for fear of them falling out, and treatment with binding medications has not been effective.
The solution is to secure them with a gold or silver thread, and gold is better because silver can tarnish and decay after days, while gold remains unchanged forever. The thread should be of moderate thickness, suitable for the space between the teeth.
The method of joining is to take the thread and insert its ends between the healthy teeth, then weave the ends of the thread between the loose tooth or teeth until it reaches the other healthy tooth on the opposite side.
Then repeat the weaving back to the side where you started, and pull gently and wisely so that it does not move at all. Tighten the thread at the base of the teeth so that it does not come loose. Then cut off the excess ends of the thread with scissors, tuck them together, and secure them between the healthy tooth and the loose tooth.
So that the tongue is not irritated, then leave it tied like this until it remains so. If it unravels or breaks, tie it again with a new thread, and in this way, it can be enjoyed for all of life. This is an illustration of the teeth and the method of joining between two healthy teeth and two loose teeth as you see:.
A single tooth or two may be replaced in their place and intertwined as described, and they will remain. This is done by a craftsman skilled in this task, and sometimes bone from the bones of an ox is carved to make it resemble a tooth and placed where the tooth was lost. It is secured as we have said, and it remains, and one enjoys its use.
Chapter Thirty-Four.
On cutting the ligament that appears under the tongue and prevents speech.
This ligament that appears under the tongue may be either natural, with which a person is born, or it may be accidental, resulting from a wound that has healed.
The procedure involves opening the patient's mouth and placing their head in your lap, then raising their tongue and cutting that nerve ligament horizontally until the tongue is freed from its restriction. If there is some stiffness or complexity, such as when it results from a healed wound, use a scalpel to cut it horizontally until the ligament is severed and untangled.
Be careful not to cut too deeply into the flesh and sever an artery, which could cause bleeding. After the incision, rinse the area with rose water or vinegar diluted with cold water. Then place a linen thread under the tongue, which the patient should hold each night.
To prevent it from rejoining, if bleeding occurs, apply powdered zinc to the area. If the bleeding is excessive, treat the area with a convex iron to stop the bleeding. Then treat him with all forms of treatment until he recovers.
Chapter Thirty-Five.
On the Removal of a Toad Developed Under the Tongue.
A swelling that resembles a small toad may occur under the tongue, preventing it from functioning normally; it might grow so large as to fill the mouth. The procedure involves opening the patient's mouth towards the sun and examining the swelling.
If you see that it is pale or black and hard, and the patient feels no sensation in it, do not attempt to treat it as it is likely cancer. However, if it tends towards white with moisture, cut it open with a fine scalpel and carefully remove it from all sides.
If bleeding overwhelms you during the procedure, apply powdered charcoal to stop the bleeding, then continue your work until it is completely removed. Finally, rinse with vinegar and salt.
Then treat him with all appropriate forms of treatment until he recovers.
Chapter Thirty-Six.
On the Treatment of Tumors of the Tonsils.
Any tumors that grow in the throat, including glands inside the throat that resemble those outside and are called tonsils, may require treatment as described in the classification. If they do not heal with this treatment,
Examine it: if the tumor is hard, pale, and has little sensation, do not treat it with a knife. If it is red in color and its base is thick, also do not treat it with a knife to avoid excessive bleeding; instead, leave it until it matures, either peeling off on its own or bursting spontaneously.
And if it is white in color, round, and its base is thin, then this is what should be cut. The procedure is that you observe before acting whether the hot inflammation has subsided completely or has diminished somewhat.
Then seat the patient facing the sun and place his head in your lap. Open his mouth and have a servant stand before you to press down his tongue with an instrument, which is depicted as follows:.
Make an instrument from silver or copper, thin like a knife. When you press the patient's tongue with this instrument and see the swelling clearly, take a hook and insert it into the lymph node, pulling it out as far as possible without also pulling out any of the intestines.
Then cut it with an instrument whose shape resembles scissors, but with its ends curved so that each end is very sharp. This should be made from Indian iron or Damascus steel:.
If this instrument is not available, then cut it with a scalpel, which has the following shape:.
Sharp on one side and not sharp on the other. After cutting one lymph node, cut the other in exactly this manner. Then after the cuts, gargle the patient with cold water or vinegar and water.
If bleeding occurs, gargle with water in which the peel of pomegranate or elm leaves have been boiled, or something similar that helps to stop the bleeding until it ceases. Then treat him until he recovers. Other tumors may also grow in the throat besides the lymph nodes, and you should cut them as I have described for cutting the lymph nodes, similarly.
I treated a woman who had a tumor that had grown inside her throat, extending to the esophagus with little sensation, which almost blocked the throat. The woman was breathing through a narrow passage and could not eat or drink water.
She was on the verge of death if she had waited another day or two, as branches from the tumor had extended and emerged through her nostrils. I acted quickly and inserted a hook into one of them, then pulled it out, extracting a suitable piece.
Then I cut it where I could grasp it from the nostril. Then I did the same with what protruded from the other nostril. After that, I opened her mouth and pressed her tongue, then inserted the hook directly into the tumor and removed some of it without much bleeding.
Her throat was immediately cleared, and she began to drink water and eat food. We continued to cut from the tumor repeatedly over a long period of time, as the tumor kept regenerating what was removed. This went on for quite some time.
I devised a strategy and treated the tumor inside her throat, which then stopped growing. She later left my care, and I do not know what became of her after that.
Chapter Thirty-Seven.
On Cutting a Tumor in the Throat.
It is called a grape if it descends into the throat and becomes inflamed; if it is white and elongated, it is called a pillar, but if it is thick and round at the bottom, it is called a grape. If the treatment mentioned in the classification fails to be effective.
I saw that the hot tumor had subsided in her, and she was thin; therefore, it should be cut. But if it is collected into a round mass and has no length, and its color is like flesh or black or lacks sensation, then cutting should be avoided.
There are subtleties regarding the patient; therefore, when you see it in the manner described with its whiteness and length, sit the patient facing the sun and press his tongue with the tool that was previously described, then pierce the tumor with the needle.
Pull it downward and cut it with one of the two tools that I mentioned for cutting the tonsils. You should not cut more than what exceeds the natural condition, as doing so would harm the voice and speech.
After cutting, use what was described for the treatment of tonsils and treat it until it heals. If the patient is reluctant to have it cut, then you should employ a cautery method without fear or hesitation. The purpose of cauterization in this case is with a sharp medicine, placing the patient's head in your lap.
Then press his tongue with the tool that was mentioned, and take the sharp water that was described in the section on cauterization. Mix it into a paste that is neither too thick nor too thin, and fill this indentation of the tool. This is its image:.
The tip of the tool where you place the medicine should be indented like a spoon for honey. Place the tool with the medicine on the palate itself while the patient lies on their side, so that saliva flows out from inside his throat without anything dripping into his windpipe, which could harm him.
Then grasp the medicine with your hand and squeeze it onto the tongue for about half an hour until you see that it has turned black and the sting of the medicine has subsided, or if you wish, take a piece of cotton, wrap it around the tip of a rod, and moisten the cotton in the medicine.
Insert the rod with the cotton into a tube from above until the cotton adheres to the tongue. Repeat this several times until you reach the desired amount for treating the swelling. Then leave it; it will wilt and fall off after three or four days. If you need to reapply the medicine, do so.
After cauterization, wipe around the swelling with cotton soaked in fat and dry off any medicine surrounding it. Then rinse with cold water and treat externally with poultices and internally with gargles until healed. This type of treatment is safer than cutting and removes more fear.
The tongue can also be treated with something gentler than cauterization and cutting, such as using frankincense in the following manner: Take fumigants like fuzanj (cascara), zuofa (likely a plant name), saussurea, cedar oil, wormwood, chamomile, and cyperus or similar herbs. Gather all of them or some of them in a pot and soak them in vinegar.
Boil it with the pot covered in clay from the hilm (a type of clay), and make a hole in the middle of the lid. Attach an empty tube to this hole, which is made of silver or brass:
Insert the end with the bulge into the patient's mouth so that the steam rises to the tongue through the tube, causing it to swell pleasantly. Then repeat this several times until it wilts. Beware of making this treatment at the beginning of the swelling's occurrence.
For often the swelling increases, and you should do this when her hot swelling has subsided. If you do not have this instrument at hand, take a reed and attach to one end of it a piece of eggshell so that the patient's mouth is not burned.
Because the eggshell prevents the hot vapor from burning the mouth, and this is part of good treatment that is safe.
Chapter Thirty-Eight.
On removing splinters and other objects that embed in the throat.
Often a bone or fish spine or something similar gets stuck in the throat, so you should remove what is visible after pressing down the tongue with an instrument under light.
So that you can see what is in the throat. For what is hidden and buried deep inside, you should induce vomiting before the food digests in the stomach; perhaps the object will come out with the vomit, or the patient may swallow a piece of linen or onion skin.
Or the patient may swallow a piece of dry bread, or you can take a soft piece of sponge, tie it to a thread, and have the patient swallow it. When the sponge reaches the spot where the spine is lodged, quickly pull on the thread; do this several times.
Often the spine or bone gets stuck in it and can be removed. If it does not come out with the methods mentioned, use an instrument made of lead as shown in this figure.
It should be slightly thicker than a probe and have a curved end that the patient gently inserts into their throat while raising their head upwards, being careful not to touch the larynx to avoid causing coughing. The doctor may also insert it with his hand to push out the bone or spine.
And inserting the patient is better for his knowledge of the position of the embedded object, and he pushes it down or pulls his hand up with the instrument until it is removed.
Chapter Thirty-Nine.
On Removing Hooks Embedded in the Throat.
If the hook is not removed by the treatments mentioned in the division of medicinal treatment, then at that time look into the patient's throat when the sun is bright after pressing down his tongue with the instrument described to you.
If your gaze falls upon the hook, then pull it out with a small fishhook or a fine, firm splint. If you are unable to do so, then take a hollow tube and insert it into the patient's throat near the hook, then insert an iron probe heated by fire into the tube.
Do this repeatedly, and the patient should abstain from water for the entire day. Then take a container filled with cold water, open the patient's mouth over it, and rinse with it without swallowing any of it. Move the water around occasionally with his hand.
For the hook will fall onto its place if it senses the water. If it does not come out as described, then fumigate the throat with urine and hartshorn using the instrument described for treating the mouth. Do this repeatedly; it will cause the hook to fall out.
The purpose of the fumigation is to take a container with hot coals from the fire, and the container is covered with a lid that has a hole in it. Attach one end of the instrument to this hole, then add the fumigating material. The patient places his mouth on the other end of the tube and closes his mouth so that the smoke does not escape until he knows that the smoke has reached his throat.
For the leech will fall upon the seat, and if it does not fall, then the incense is repeated several times. The patient should endure thirst, eat salted food and garlic, but drink no water; for by this management it must come forth. And this is a picture of an instrument to attract the leech from the throat when it comes into view.
It resembles the pincers as you see, except that it has this curvature which enters the throat, and its ends resemble the beak of a bird with the roughness of a scalpel; if it is applied to anything, it does not let go:.
Another instrument is used to press the tongue, which is a wide ring made of iron, large enough to fit over the mouth above the tongue. It is inserted into the mouth on its edge so that the mouth remains open without the patient's will, and they are unable to remove it at all until it is taken off:.
The description of the instrument used to open the mouth in exactly this manner.
Chapter Forty.
It deals with the discussion of blunting tumors and incising them.
Tumors have many diverse types, which will be mentioned one by one in this book. They differ in blunting and incising them based on two aspects, one of which is the nature of the tumor itself and what moisture it contains.
The second type is based on the body parts where they occur, because a tumor occurring in the head is different from one occurring in the thigh, and a tumor occurring in muscular tissue is different from one occurring in a joint. Each has its own ruling for treatment.
There are tumors that should not be incised until the pus within them has matured and fully developed, and there are others that should be incised even when the pus is still immature and has not yet completely developed, such as tumors that are close to joints.
Because when a tumor occurs near a joint and persists until it corrupts the surrounding area, it may damage the ligaments or nerves of that joint, leading to chronic disability of that limb, or the tumor may be near a principal organ.
Because if you delay incising it until it matures, you will harm that principal organ. Or the tumor may be near the buttocks; therefore, you should incise it while it is immature. It is necessary to incise a tumor that is not fully matured and is near the buttocks so that it does not become gangrenous and penetrate into the interior of the buttocks, thus becoming a fistula.
It may result in a condition that does not heal completely. You should know the time to incise tumors that have fully matured, which is when the pain in the tumor subsides, the fever disappears, the redness and inflammation decrease, the head of the tumor becomes soft, and all other signs indicate it is appropriate.
You should make the incision at the lowest part of the tumor if possible, so that the pus can drain more easily downward, or in the thinnest and most prominent part of the tumor. If the tumors are near the hands or feet, the incision should be made along the length of the body.
Make the incision in areas away from muscles, tendons, nerves, and arteries, generally in flat areas with no bends. If there are bends, the incision should be made accordingly. However, if the tumor is in fleshy areas, it is best to leave it unincised.
Until it is fully ripe as we have said, for if you open it before that, the discharge of pus will be prolonged, and there will be much dirtiness and filth; and his lip and nostril may become adherent. Some tumors may be lanced on the surface of the body in emergencies or according to what the part requires.
You should use a single incision for small tumors and a wide incision or many cuts for large tumors, as needed. There are also tumors where it may be necessary to cut and excise the skin if it has become like cloth.
And it has become to some extent dead, as is often seen in many abscesses and recesses. Some of them should be incised with a triangular cut, and some should be excised in the shape of a reed leaf, such as an arbie tumor.
Some should be treated with a circular incision or a crescent-shaped cut, and similar cuts. If there is no head to the tumor, such as smooth flat tumors, only a simple incision should be made. And if the tumor is large and has collected pus for a long time, do not rush to evacuate all of it at once when you make an incision.
Rather, remove some of it and then compress the tumor until another day, then remove more pus. Do this repeatedly in stages until all of it is removed.
Especially if the patient is weak, or a pregnant woman, or a small child, or an old man, for often with the sudden evacuation of pus, the vital spirit may dissolve, and the patient might die without you noticing. Beware of this greatly.
After you have excised these tumors, you should clean the wound and examine it. If the tumor incision is small or if there is a single simple cut, use lint from linen or old cotton. If the tumor is large and there are many cuts in the excision, do the following.
You should insert a wick into each cut until they touch each other. If part of the skin has been cut away or indented when removing the tumor, you should fill it with old cotton or flax lint without moisture and keep it compressed for three days.
Then remove it and treat it with the appropriate ointments until it heals. If bleeding occurs during the procedure, use cold water and vinegar after soaking a piece of linen in them and apply it to the bleeding area repeatedly.
If the bleeding persists, you should employ treatments and remedies as described in many places in this book and from the division. If it is winter and the area of the tumor has many nerves, you should moisten dressings with hot syrup and oil.
Place them on the affected area. If it is summer and the areas are hot, you should apply dressings soaked in cold water and oil or syrup and oil, all of which should be cool. As we said on the third day, you should then unwrap the dressing and clean the wound.
Use treatments similar to these until it heals. This is what you need to know about the general treatment of tumors. As for detailed methods, I have described each tumor and its treatment in detail, categorized and summarized.
Chapter Forty-One.
في الشق على الأورام التي تظهر في جلد الرأس.
تظهر في جلد الرأس أورام صغيرة وهي من أنواع السلائل التي تحتوي صفيقًا لها ظروف كأنها حوصلة الدجاجة، وأنواعها كثيرة: منها ما هو شحمي ومنها ما يحوي رطوبة تشبه الحمأة.
ومنها ما تحوي رطوبة تشبه الدشيش والحساء ونحو ذلك، ومنها ما هي متحجرة صلبة. وكلها لا خطر في شقها وإخراجها ما لم يعترضك عند شقها شريان.
والعمل في شقها أن تسبرها أولاً بالآلة التي تأتي صورتها بعد هذا والتي تسمى المدس حتى تعلم ما تحوي. فإن كان الذي تحوي رطوبة فشقها شقاً على الطول شقاً بسيطاً على هذه الصورة:.
وابدأ بالشق من خط ~ب~ إلى خط ~ج~. فإذا تفرغت الرطوبة، اسلخ الكيس الذي كان يحوي تلك الرطوبة وأقطعه جميعاً ولا تترك منه شيئاً البتة، فكثيرا ما يعود إذا بقى منه شيء.
ثم اغمس قطنة في المرهم الصرى إذا حضر، وإلا في ماء الملح واملأ به الجرح واتركه إلى يوم آخر فإنما يأكل ما بقى من الكيس، ثم أعد عليه القطنة بالمرهم الصرى ثانية وثالثة إن احتجت إليه ذلك.
Until you are certain that nothing remains of the sac, then treat the wound with ointments until it heals. If the swelling contains a fatty tumor, cut it open in this manner:.
Make a firm incision and insert the probes into the edges of the wound and peel it from all sides, exerting your effort to remove the omentum that contains it. If an artery is encountered, do as described for you afterward. Do the same for the swelling if it is calcified from the incision.
The treatment is exactly as I have mentioned, and the incision on a calcified swelling is easier because it has little blood and moisture. Some of these head tumors in certain people have no moisture at all; indeed, when I made an incision into a tumor, ...
on the head of an old woman, and I found the tumor as hard as a stone, rough and white, so much so that it could not be broken even if thrown by someone; it would only bruise. None of the other tumors that occur on the heads, such as those that appear in the heads of children, are like this one.
At the base of the ears, make a simple incision and ensure that the bottom is open so that the discharge can flow downward easily, then treat it with appropriate remedies.
Chapter Forty-Two.
On Incising Tumors That Appear in the Neck. These tumors often appear in the neck, under the armpits, and in the armpit regions, although they may also occur throughout the body. Those that appear in the neck are usually single, but can be multiple and some develop from others.
And every maggot from among them is inside a special pouch as in the cases of abscesses and tumors of the head as we have described, and the kinds of these maggots are many; some are calcified, others contain moisture, and there are those that are noxious and do not respond to treatment.
And I have not seen any of them in good condition to the touch; its appearance was close to the color of the skin, moving in all directions without adhering to the nerve of the neck or to muscles or arteries, and it was not sunken. It is necessary to cut it with a simple incision from top to bottom of the body in this shape, from line ~ج~ to line ~ب~:.
And peel it from all sides and stretch the edges of the skin with a single clamp or two clamps or many clamps if necessary, as we mentioned in cases of tumors of the head. Remove it little by little and be careful not to cut any vein or nerve. Let the scalpel not be too sharp.
So that your hand does not overcut or disturb the patient by cutting what is not necessary to cut. If you cut a vein or artery and it hinders your work, place in the wound powdered zinc or some of the substances that stop bleeding.
And compress the wound and leave it until the inflammation subsides and the wound relaxes, indicating that it is about to begin healing. At this point, bleeding will stop, so return to your work until you are done. Then, examine with your index finger if any smaller maggots remain and remove them.
If there is a large vein at the base of the hernia, it should not be cut from its origin. Rather, it should be tied tightly with a double thread so that it falls off by itself without harm. Then stuff the wound with old cotton that has been soaked in Egyptian ointment and treat it accordingly.
If you cut the entire hernia, it is necessary to bring together the edges of the wound and suture it immediately after ensuring that no part remains. If you see that a part of the bone of the hernia remains.
It is necessary to aim for cutting at its origin and base, and use suturing as we have mentioned. For hernias that contain moisture, apply a simple pad where you see the area has matured, and make the pad from what is below as we said.
Then use linen strips soaked in Egyptian ointment or similar to absorb any remaining corruption. When you see that the wound has cleansed, treat it with ointments that promote flesh growth until it heals.
Chapter Forty-Three.
On incising the throat for a tumor that occurs inside the throat.
The earlier scholars mentioned this incision in the throat, but I have not seen anyone in our country perform it. This is their sequence of discourse. As for those with acute conditions, they should avoid incising the throat as it does not benefit them.
Because all the veins and the lung are diseased, and for those with a hot tumor in the mouth, throat, or tonsils, if there is no issue with the windpipe, it is necessary to use an incision in the throat to avoid the harm that comes from choking.
It is appropriate, if we wish to do so, to make an incision in the throat below three circles of the trachea or four, a small one transversely between two circles, as much as the incision in the mesentery should be, not in the cartilage; and this place corresponds to the incision.
Because it has little flesh and the blood vessels are far from it; if the surgeon is timid, he should stretch the throat skin with a retractor, then cut the skin until he reaches the trachea, and avoid the blood vessels if he sees any of them.
Then he should incise the mesentery as described, and determine the incision of the trachea from the phlegm that comes out with it when it is perforated, and from the cessation of voice. The wound should be left open for a time; once the period during which choking was feared has passed, the edges of the wound in the skin should be approximated.
And he incises it alone, without the cartilage, then uses the medications that promote flesh growth until it heals. The author of this book states that the explanation of this statement which we have related is when they see the patient's throat obstructed by one of these tumors which they mentioned.
And when the patient is approaching death and his life is in danger, they resort to incising the throat so that the patient can breathe at the site of the incision for some time and be saved from death. They are instructed to leave the wound open until the course of the illness runs its course, and it lasts for three days or so.
At that time, they were instructed to suture the wound and treat it until it heals. What I myself witnessed was a servant who took a knife and made an incision on her throat, cutting part of the trachea. She was brought to me for treatment, and she was fainting as if slaughtered. Upon examination, I uncovered the wound.
I found the blood that came out of the wound to be slight, so I was certain that she had not cut an artery or a vein. The breath was coming from the wound, so I quickly stitched the wound and treated it until it healed, and nothing happened to the servant except for hoarseness in her voice, no more.
She returned to her best condition after a few days. From this, we say that cutting the throat is not dangerous.
Chapter Forty-Four.
On incising the tumor that appears on the throat from the outside and is called the elephant of the throat.
This tumor called the elephant of the throat is a large swelling in the color of the body, and it is common in women. It is of two types.
It may be either natural or accidental. As for the natural one, there is no remedy for it, but as for the accidental one, it is of two types: one resembles fatty tumors, and the other resembles a tumor that results from arterial obstruction, and there is danger in incising it. It should not be exposed to the blade at all, except for what is small. If you examine and probe it with your finger and find that it resembles a fatty tumor and is not attached to any veins, then incise it as you would a fatty tumor. Remove it along with the capsule if it is enclosed in one, or otherwise carefully excise all of it and then treat the area as necessary.
Chapter Forty-Five.
On incising for various abscesses.
There are many types of abscesses, and I have mentioned all their kinds in the classification. Here, it is important to explain the difference between an abscess and a boil, as this can be confusing. I say that a boil comes with heat, fever, and frightening pains until the inflammation subsides. And the pus matures, at which point the fever and intensity subside. An abscess does not come with heat, fever, or pain; it is contained in a special membranous sac that matches the color of the body. It begins like a lentil and grows to resemble an egg, becoming larger or smaller.
It is of two types: either fatty or containing moisture, and the colors of the moisture are numerous as mentioned in the classification. When you proceed to treat an abscess, you should first probe it and examine it with a tool called a medus, as its illustration will appear in the section that follows this one.
Assess the size of the swelling, then remove the medus and observe what comes out after it. If watery discharge of any color comes out, make a simple incision as described for other swellings. If no moisture comes out after using the medus, know that it is a fatty abscess.
Make a firm incision on it in the manner I have shown you, and hang it with clamps. Gently peel the skin away from all sides, and if possible, preserve the sac intact along with the abscess.
If the sac bursts during the procedure and you cannot remove it intact, this often happens, so remove it piece by piece until nothing remains. For if any part of it remains, whether little or much, the condition will most likely return.
If the condition persists and only a small amount remains, cauterize the wound with sharp cauterizing agents when you finish, tighten the wound, place something on it to reduce inflammation, and treat it with all other methods until it heals. If the condition is large, outline its edges and treat it in a way that promotes healing.
If a troublesome or non-troublesome vein is encountered and bleeding occurs, immediately cauterize the area with powdered cautery agents and keep it tightly bound for two or three days until the wound begins to heal and the bleeding subsides. Then return to cutting away what remains of the condition.
Chapter Forty-Six.
On the Forms of Instruments.
Those that are used for incision and dilation include the forms of dilators, which are of three types: large, medium, and small.
Image of a Large Dilator:
Image of a Medium Dilator:
Image of a Small Dilator:
They are made of steel with square ends that are sturdy to facilitate entry into tumors. These are the forms of probes, also known as cold instruments, which are likewise in three types: large, medium, and small. Image of a Large Probe:
Image of a probe in the center:.
Image of a small probe:.
It is suitable for examining tumors, surgical incisions, fistulas, and cavities to determine what is inside them, such as bones and other matters. It is made round, polished, and smooth like a cone, from Chinese brass or espadrille metal, or from brass, iron, or silver, with the best being made from espadrille metal.
Probes can also be made from black lead, which are suitable for examining fistulas where there is a curve at the bottom, as they can bend with that curvature. They are also of three types: long, medium, and short.
The size of each probe should be appropriate for the depth of each fistula, and its thickness should match the width and narrowness of the fistula. Image of a large lead probe:.
Image of a medium lead probe:.
Image of a small lead probe:.
Images of forceps, which are many types because there are simple ones, meaning those with one hook, and they are three types: large, medium, and small. There are also blind forceps, which are three types. And there are forceps with two hooks, which are three types. Additionally, there are curved forceps with two hooks. They are also three types, and there are forceps with three hooks, which are three types. All of these types are needed in their respective places. Image of a simple large forceps:. Image of a simple retractor in the center:. Image of a small simple retractor:.
Image of a large blind retractor:. Image of a medium-sized blind retractor:.
Image of a small blind retractor:.
Image of a large retractor with two hooks:. Image of a medium-sized retractor with two hooks:. Image of a small retractor with two hooks:.
Image of a large retractor with three clamps:.
Image of a medium-sized retractor with three clamps:. Image of a small retractor with three clamps:.
This is an image of a large scalpel used for cutting and peeling tumors and excrescences; there are three types: large, medium, and small:.
Image of a medium scalpel:.
Image of a small scalpel:.
The cutting edges used for incision are limited, while the other ends are not restricted. This design is intended to be helpful in peeling tumors when there is a risk of cutting a nerve or tendon, and it provides some comfort to the patient by reducing the pain slightly during the tumor removal.
These are the images of the operating stools; they are three types, for there are large ones, medium-sized ones, and small ones. Image of a large operating stool:.
It is made of brass-like copper that is used for inlaying. On one end, there is a wide spoon-like part consisting of two layers, at the tip of which is hidden the blade of a scalpel, resembling the tongue of a bird, which can be extended and retracted as you wish, as you can see,.
Images of the scalpels that are concealed between the fingers when incising tumors so that the patient does not feel them; they are three types, for there are large ones, medium-sized ones, and small ones. Image of a large scalpel:.
Images of the lancets used to cut off bleeding; they are three types, for there are large ones, medium-sized ones, and small ones. Image of a large lancet:.
It is made of brass or porcelain, slightly elongated as you can see, and very thin. These types of lancets should be available in large and small sizes to quickly draw blood when necessary and when medicine is not at hand.
However, do not use it for bloodletting in every part of the body; rather, use it in fleshy parts such as the muscles of the thigh and calf, the arm and breast, the belly, the armpit, and similar moist fleshly organs.
And from them, other small instruments can be made that resemble pistachio shells, as shown in this figure:.
It is used to stop bleeding if it occurs from the bloodletting site or when cutting a vein or artery. It can also be made round, as shown in this figure:.
Chapter Forty-Seven.
On the Treatment of Men's Breasts.
Some people's breasts may swell during puberty to resemble women's breasts, remaining swollen and unattractive. If someone dislikes this, it should be treated by making a crescent-shaped incision in the breast as shown in this figure.
From line ~b~ to line ~c~:. Then remove all the fat, fill the wound with healing flesh-forming medicine, and sew the edges of the incision together. Treat it until it heals. If the breast sags downward and becomes lax on its supporting structure as often happens in women.
It is advisable to make two incisions in the upper sides of the breast, resembling a crescent shape, connecting at their ends so that the larger line encircles the smaller one as shown in this figure:. From line ~b~ to line ~c~, then remove the skin between the two incisions, extract the fat, and use the sewing and dressings as mentioned, along with any other necessary treatment until it heals.
If you are unable to excise what should be excised due to the patient's anxiety or excessive bleeding, you should pack the wound with cotton soaked in corrosive ointment until it eats away the remaining fat, then treat it until it heals.
Chapter Forty-Eight.
On the treatment of tumors that appear under the armpit.
These tumors that appear under the armpit are of a pig-like type, solid and contained within a sac. Some of them contain moisture; those that do should be incised in a crescent shape as follows.
From line ~b~ to line ~c~. Once all that is inside the tumor has been evacuated over time, pack it with old cotton and leave it for another day, then remove the cotton.
Treat it with the appropriate ointment until it heals. If the tumor is of the type of pig's nodules, incise it as described in the incision for pigs. If the wound persists and pus extends, use cauterization as mentioned previously.
Chapter Forty-Nine.
On incising a tumor that appears near an artery or vein, and it is called aneurysm.
If an artery is cut and the skin above it heals, a tumor often appears. The same can also happen to a vein, where it may swell and become a tumor.
The signs that indicate whether a tumor and swelling are from an artery or a vein: If the tumor is from an artery, it will be elongated and concentrated deep within the body. When you press the tumor with your finger, you can feel a grating sensation.
That which is near the vein will cause the swelling to be circular on the surface of the body, and cutting into these tumors is dangerous, especially those in the armpit, elbow, neck, and many other parts of the body, and they are very large; therefore, it should be avoided to treat them with iron.
And those that are in the limbs or in the head should also be avoided; if it is an expansion at the mouth of the artery, cut along its length in the skin, then open the incision with forceps, then peel away the artery and free it from the fasciae.
Until it is exposed, then insert a needle under it and pass it to the other side, and tie off the artery with a double thread at two places as I have described for you in ligating the arteries in the temples, then cut between the ligatures until all the blood has come out.
And the swelling will subside, then use treatments that promote pus formation until the ligatures fall off, then treat it with ointments suitable for this condition until it heals.
If the swelling is from cutting into a vein, then grasp as much of the swelling with the skin as possible with your hand, then insert a needle below where you are grasping and pass it through with a double thread until it comes out on the other side. Then tie the swelling tightly as I have described to you in tying a grape from both sides with the ends of the thread. If you fear that the threads will slip, insert another needle with another thread under the entire swelling at the intersection of the first needle.
Tighten your threads in four places, then cut open the tumor in the middle until what is inside comes out; then cut off the excess skin but leave what was sutured, and place on it a dressing soaked in syrup and oil. Then use the treatment that involves bandages and ointments until it heals.
Chapter Fifty.
On the tumor that arises from nerve strain.
Just as a tumor can occur in an artery or vein, so too can a tumor occur in a nerve if it is struck or due to excessive fatigue or similar causes, and this is more common at the wrists and heels.
In every joint where movement occurs, a tumor appears that has the same color as the rest of the body and is usually painless. If pressed firmly, the patient feels a tingling sensation, and the tumor does not gather deep within the flesh.
It is actually under the skin and moves in all directions but does not go forward or backward. If it occurs in a joint, it should not be treated with iron, as it may cause damage. If it occurs on the head or forehead,
Cut the skin with a scalpel. If the tumor is small, grasp it with forceps and cut it from the root. If it is large, suspend it with pincers, peel it off, then remove it and sew up the wound, treating it until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-One.
On cutting warts that appear on the abdomen.
Many people develop warts on their abdomens and other parts of their bodies, which are called fungal warts due to their resemblance to mushrooms. Their base is thin, but their head is thick; they can have projections like lips, and there are smaller ones among them as well as those that become very large.
I once saw a man with two warts on his abdomen that most resembled mushrooms, both white and thin at the base, with projections and cracks, and moisture constantly flowing from them. I cut them out, and they weighed approximately eighteen ounces each, and the other one weighed about six ounces.
To operate on cutting them, examine the patient. If the patient is moist and the wart is white, moist, and has a thin base, cut it with a broad scalpel. Have irons ready in the fire because often, when cutting such warts, a lot of blood may flow.
If the blood overwhelms you, quickly cauterize it. If you find that the patient is timid and afraid of cutting with iron, take a sturdy lead wire, tie it around the wart with this description, and leave it for two days. Then increase the tension of the lead wire; keep tightening the lead wire.
Tighten it until it affects the wart, causing it to fall off on its own without further effort. If the base of the wart is thick, there may be some fear and risk in cutting it, especially those found on the abdomen. However, it can sometimes be cut in half or partially.
Then cauterize it to prevent its return, and treat the wound until it heals. Beware of cutting a wart that is dark in color, insensitive to touch, and unattractive in appearance, as it may be a cancerous growth. We will discuss cancer after this.
Chapter Fifty-Two.
On the Treatment of Umbilical Hernia.
Umbilical hernia has many causes: it may be due to a rupture in the abdominal fascia through which the intestines or other contents protrude, as is common with other types of hernias. It may also result from blood that oozes out from a vein or artery, as previously described, or from gas that accumulates within it.
If it is due to a rupture in the abdominal fascia with the protrusion of the intestines, then the color of the hernia will resemble the color of the body, it will be soft and without pain, and its appearance will vary in position. If it is due to the protrusion of the intestines, its position will differ even more as described. When you press it with your fingers, it disappears and then returns. There may also be gurgling sounds, and it often becomes larger when entering a bath or during severe exertion. If it is due to moisture, it will be soft.
It will not retract if you press it with your hand, nor will it increase or decrease. If it is due to blood, the swelling will appear dark along with these signs. If it is due to newly grown flesh, the swelling will be hard and will remain at a constant size.
If it is due to gas, its touch will be soft. The approach in such cases is to observe: if the umbilical hernia is caused by blood from an artery or vein, or by gas, one should avoid treating it, as there is a risk and potential harm involved, as I have informed you in the chapter that deals with tumors arising from arteries and veins.
If the nodule of the umbilicus is from the side of the abdomen or the flank, then you should order the patient to hold himself in check and stand erect, then mark with ink around the entire umbilicus. Then order him to lie down before you on his back, then make a wide incision around the umbilicus at the place marked with ink. Then elevate the center of the swelling with a large forceps, then tie off the site of the incision tightly with strong thread or silk.
The knot of the ligature should be loose, then open the center of the constricted swelling above the ligature and insert your index finger to find the intestine. If you find that the intestine has been taken by the ligature, loosen the knot and push the intestine back into the abdomen. If you find a clot, elevate it with forceps.
Cut away the excess, and if an artery or vein obstructs you, tie it off carefully and return to your work. Take two needles and thread them with strong threads, then insert the needles into the incision made around the swelling, crossing them, and then secure the swelling in four places with the needles.
If you wish, remove the needles and leave the site so that the constricted flesh may decay and fall off by itself, or cut it when it has become soft and decayed, then treat it with appropriate ointments until it heals. If the nodule of the umbilicus is composed of protruding flesh.
Or if it is due to moisture, you should lance the swelling as described and remove the blood or moisture that you find there, then treat it with remedies that promote healing.
Chapter Fifty-Three.
In the Treatment of Cancer.
In the classification, we have mentioned the types of cancer and how to approach their treatment with medications, warning against treating them with iron as it may cause ulceration. We also discussed cancer originating in the uterus and warned about its treatment.
The early authorities mentioned that when cancer is in a place where it can be completely removed, such as cancer in the breast or thigh and similar organs where it can be extracted entirely, especially if it is small and recent. However, if it is advanced and large, it should not be approached closely.
For I have never succeeded in curing anyone of it, nor have I seen anyone before me achieve that. If it is firmly seated as we said, one should first administer repeated doses of the black hellebore to ease the condition, then if it is obstructing the vessels, attempt to clear them if there is obvious obstruction.
Then place the patient in a position where they can be effectively treated, and apply suitable cautery to the cancer from all sides along with the skin, thoroughly excising it until none of its roots remain, allowing the blood to flow but not cutting it too quickly.
Rather, squeeze the areas and let all thick blood drain by hand or with whatever instruments you have. If excessive bleeding occurs during treatment from cutting an artery or vein, apply a tourniquet until the bleeding stops, then continue treating it with other methods until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-Four.
In the treatment of hernia.
In the classification, we have been informed about the types of ascites, how water accumulates in each type, their symptoms, and their treatment with medicines. However, only the zaki (strangulated) type is treated with iron; the tabbi (peritoneal) type and the lahami (fatty) type are never approached with iron at all.
If that is the case, it is fatal. If you have treated this zaki (strangulated) type of hernia with medicines and your treatment has not been effective, then observe whether the patient has become excessively weak or if he suffers from another illness besides the hernia, such as.
cough or diarrhea and the like, then beware of treating him with iron, for it is dangerous. If you see that the patient is strong, suffering from no illness other than the hernia alone, and neither a child nor an elderly person, then the approach to treatment should be to have the patient stand before you. And have a servant stand behind him to press his abdomen with his hands and push the fluid downward towards the groin. Then take a surgical needle on this manner:.
Limited on both sides, long with a defined tip like a scalpel, except that it has a slight curvature so as not to penetrate too far during the procedure and damage the intestines. Then observe if the hernia has developed from the intestine side.
You should make an incision three fingerbreadths below the navel, above the groin. If the hernia has developed due to a liver disorder, your incision should be three fingerbreadths to the left of the navel. If it has developed due to a spleen disorder, your incision should be three fingerbreadths to the right side.
It is also not advisable for the incision to be on the side on which the patient wishes to lie, so that the excess does not flow to that weak area. Then pierce the skin with the instrument completely, then insert the instrument into that incision and raise your hand.
With the scalpel, between the skin and the subcutaneous tissue, as if you were peeling it, and the amount you peel should be the size of a fingernail or so. Then puncture the subcutaneous tissue until the scalpel reaches an empty space, which is where the fluid is, then remove it and insert into the hole the instrument whose image is shown here.
It is like a tube made from a thin reed, made of silver or copper or smooth polished spadroy, with a small hole at the bottom and three holes on its sides, two on one side and one on another as you can see.
He may place one end of it, sharpened like the tip of a pen, as in this image.
At the top end, there is a ring. When the instrument reaches the fluid, it will immediately flow onto the instrument, so an average amount of fluid should be released at a time. If you release more than necessary in one go, the patient may die due to the dissolution of their vital spirit.
Or he may fall into a faint that is close to death. However, release from him according to his strength and what the patient's condition indicates, such as the strength of his pulse and the improvement in his color. Then remove the instrument and stop the fluid release; it will immediately stop.
Because of the skin that holds the hole in the subcutaneous tissue which you were instructed to cover as described, then reintroduce the instrument another day if you see the patient capable of enduring it.
Also, a small amount of water is removed; you do this for several days while holding the neck and being careful not to make a mistake until only a small amount of water remains. If you are afraid for the patient and leave a large amount of water, then treat it by burying it in hot sand.
Excessive sweating in the bath and sun, keeping him thirsty, and treating him with dried medicines until he recovers, and cauterizing the stomach, liver, and spleen after removing the water as described above.
Chapter Fifty-Five.
On the treatment of children who are born with the urethral opening not pierced, or if it is narrow or in an improper location.
Some boys may be born with their urethra not pierced, so it is necessary to pierce it as soon as they are born.
With a very thin scalpel, as shown in this figure:.
Then place a thin nail made of lead in the hole, secure it, and keep it in place for three or four days. When urination is desired, move it aside, clean it, then replace it. If you do not use lead, it may be that the urine passing through the area does not allow it to close up.
As for the one whose urethral opening is narrow, it should be treated with lead as we said for many days until it widens. And those whose urethra is in an improper position: some are born with the opening at the end of the genital, so they cannot urinate forward.
Until he raises the urethra with his hand upwards, and it should not be exposed beforehand because semen cannot reach the uterus straight, which is a very ugly reason. The purpose of this action is that the patient lies on his back.
Then extend his penis with your left hand as strongly as possible, and shave the tip of the urethra with a sharp blade or scalpel, like the shape of a pen cap, or as if you are carving something to make its center protrude, resembling a ball so that the hole is in the middle as it should be.
Be careful during the procedure to avoid bleeding, as this often happens. Counter it with something that stops the blood and treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-Six.
Regarding the abscess that occurs in the bladder, testicles, black area, corruption, and adhesion of the bladder to the testicles.
This abscess often occurs in the urethra; it is a fleshy, pale swelling and can be either benign or malignant. The benign one should be attached with a fine fishhook.
Cut it until you clean it completely, then apply cotton soaked in Egyptian ointment, and afterward treat it with palm ointment until it heals. However, if the abscess is malignant and pale in color, cauterization should be used after cutting and exposing it.
If the abscess is in a foreskin of an uncircumcised person and part of the abscess is inside the foreskin while another part is outside, you should remove the part of the abscess that is inside first until it heals, then treat the external part.
For if you treat them together, you cannot ensure that the bladder will not rupture. Additionally, in the testicles and in the bladder, there may be blackening and corruption; therefore, it is necessary to cauterize all that has blackened and is about to corrupt or has already corrupted.
Then apply honey mixed with ground and sieved rind of pomegranate and crumena, then treat it with all other treatments until it heals. If bleeding occurs, use cautery with a crescent-shaped iron as shown in this figure:.
For cautery is beneficial for both conditions, namely bleeding and a corrupted wound. If the bladder atrophies and disappears at some point, it is necessary to insert a lead tube into the urethra so that the patient can urinate through it. As for the adhesion of the bladder to the bladder (Note: This appears to be an error in the original text, likely meant "the adhesion of the bladder to the urethra" or another anatomical part),
This adhesion occurs in those whose foreskin was intact and who did not undergo circumcision. It may also occur due to a wound or swelling; therefore, it is necessary to peel it with a thin scalpel until the ligament loosens and the glans is freed from all sides.
If it is difficult to distinguish it upon examination, then peel some of the glans and foreskin. The foreskin is thin, so it may quickly rupture due to its thinness. Then separate the foreskin from the glans with a thin linen cloth soaked in cold water to prevent them from adhering as well.
Then treat it with a constriction syrup until it heals.

في تطهير الصبيان وعلاج ما يعرض لهم من الخطأ.
الختان ليس هو بشيء غير تفرق الإتصال كسائر الجراحات إلا أنه لما كان من فعلنا بإرادتنا واستعماله في الصبيان خاصة وجب أن نرسم فيه العمل الأفضل.
وال طريق الأسهل المؤدى إلى السلامة، فأقول إنّ الأوائل لم تذكر الختان في شيء من كتبها لأنّه لم يكن يستعمل في شرائعهم وإنما هو ما اكتسبناه.
بالتجربة وذلك أنّي وجدت الجمهور من الصناع والحجامين يستعملون التطهير بالموسى وبالمقص ويستعملون الفلكة والربط بالخيط والقطع بالظفر وقد جرّبت جميع هذه الوجوه.
فلم أجد أفضل من التطهير بالمقص والربط بالخيط لأن التطهير بالموسى كثيرا ما تلوذ له الجلدة لأن جلدة الغلفة طبقتان فربما قطعت الجلدة العليا وبقيت الطبقة السفلى.
فيضطر إلى قطع آخر وألم مستأنف والتطهير بالفلكة لا يؤمن معها قطع طرف الإحليل لأنّه ربّما دخل في ثقبها، وأمّا التطهير بالظفر فربّما فلت الجلدة وفسد عملك أو كانت جلدة الصبي قصيرة بالطبع..
فكثيرا ما يولدون كذلك لا يحتاجون إلى تطهير وقد رأيت ذلك، وأمّا التطهير بالمقص والربط بالخيط فالتجربة كشفت لي فضله لأن المقص متناسب القطع من أجل أن الشفرة التي من فوق كالشفرة التي من أسفل.
When you press your hand with the proper alignment of the blades, you will cut uniformly in one measure and at one time. The suture line will then fit seamlessly around the bladder's skin from all sides without any error whatsoever, and initially, you should demonstrate this to the boy.
Especially if he is one who understands a little that you are only tying the thread in his bladder and leaving it for another day, then cheer him up and please him in any way you can, and whatever he accepts with his reason, then have him stand before you upright.
He must not sit, and hide the scissors in your sleeve or under your foot so that the boy's eye does not fall on them at all, nor on any of the instruments. Then insert your hand into his bladder and blow up the skin and lift it up until the tip of the bladder comes out.
Then clean it from what accumulates in it of dirt. Then tie the marked place with a folded thread, then tie another knot slightly below it. Then grasp with your thumb and index finger the lower part of the second knot firmly and cut between the two knots. Then lift the skin quickly and pull out the tip of the bladder, then let the blood flow a little as it is better and causes less swelling of the bladder. Then dry it with a wet cloth, then sprinkle it with dried and burned pumpkin ash, which is the best I have tried, or fine barley flour, which is also excellent.
Then lift the skin quickly and pull out the tip of the bladder, then let the blood flow a little as it is better and causes less swelling of the bladder. Then dry it with a wet cloth, then sprinkle it with dried and burned pumpkin ash, which is the best I have tried, or fine barley flour, which is also excellent. Then carry him to the bed above and place a strip of cooked egg yolk in rose water mixed with fresh, fragrant rose oil on him, and leave it there for another day. Then treat him with all other remedies until he is healed.
This is a picture of the scissors suitable for cleansing:.
They should be straight, sharp scissors with curved blades suitable for cleaning. The length of the two blades should be equal to the length of the two handles respectively. As for the mistake that may occur during cleansing, it might turn the entire inner skin or part of it inside out when cutting; therefore, you should immediately pull it back with your fingernail before the area swells.
Cut it smoothly. If you cannot hold it with your fingernail, pull it with a needle and cut it. If three days have passed and the area below the urethral opening remains swollen and red, leave it until the inflammation subsides and then gently peel it off.
Cut it as seems appropriate to you, but be careful around the urethral opening. If you accidentally cut any part of the urethral opening, it is not harmful; treat it with substances that promote wound healing as described in the section on poultices.
If you cut more than the required amount of skin and it retracts upwards, this also does not cause much harm. Treat it as we have described until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-Eight.
On the Treatment of Retained Urine in the Bladder.
Retained urine in the bladder is due to its obstruction by a stone, clotted blood, pus, or excessive tissue growth. If you treat this with the various methods of treatment described in the classification.
And if urine does not flow, and I see that its retention is due to a stone damaging the neck of the bladder, then the patient should sit on his knees with his buttocks raised, and another person should straddle him and press his back. The patient should hold himself steady as much as possible.
At that moment, the neck of the bladder will push the stone backward, and urine will flow. If it does not flow as mentioned and the patient's condition worsens, then a device called a catheter should be used, which has this design:.
It is made of silver and should be thin, smooth, and hollow like a bird's feather quill, about one and a half handbreadths in length, with a gentle cone at the end. To draw out urine, take a folded thread and securely fasten wool or cotton to one end.
Insert the thread end into the bottom of the catheter and trim any excess wool so that it fits inside the tube like a plug. Then lubricate the catheter with oil, butter, or egg white, and have the patient sit on a chair.
Moisten the bladder and urethra with wet lubricants, oil, or warm water. Then gently insert the catheter into the urethra until it reaches the base of the urethra, then bend the urethra upwards towards the navel, and push the catheter further inside.
Once the urethra is bent properly, push the catheter inside until it reaches near the buttocks. Then tilt the penis downwards while the catheter is inside and push it further until it reaches the bladder. The patient will feel that it has reached an empty space.
And it is done in this order because the passage through which urine flows is curved. Then stretch the thread coated with wool tightly, for the urine will follow the wool. Then remove it and pour out the urine, and repeat with the catheters.
And continue doing this until the bladder is empty and the patient feels relief.
Chapter Fifty-Nine.
How to Inject the Bladder with a Syringe.
And the instruments suitable for this are made of silver or hollowed ivory, with a long tube as thin as pus. If you want to drip water and medicine into it, it should be done with an instrument called a syringe, and this is its shape:.
It is made of silver or hollowed ivory, with a long tube as thin as silk, completely hollow except for the end, which is solid and has three holes: two on one side and one on the other side as you can see.
And the hollow part where the syringe is placed should be just enough to fit it without excess. When you pull with it, it will attract moisture, and when you push with it, it will propel liquid a distance, as is done with a device used to throw oil during sea battles.
If you want to extract moisture from the bladder, insert the end of the syringe into the moisture and pull with the plunger upwards. The moisture will be drawn into the hollow of the syringe. Then insert its end into the urethra as described for catheters. Then push the plunger to expel the moisture.
For that moisture reaches the bladder in stages until the patient becomes aware of it, and this is a picture of another fine syringe used to inject the bladder.
It is made of silver or spathode, with its upper end resembling a small funnel, below which there is a groove where the ligature sits. Then you take a camel's bladder and place in it the moisture that you want to inject into the bladder, then tie it tightly between the two grooves with folded thread.
Warm that moisture slightly over the fire, then insert the tip of the syringe into the urethra. Then press your hand firmly on the bladder with the moisture until the patient feels that this moisture has reached the bladder.
If you do not have a bladder, take a piece of parchment and make a circle from it, then pierce it all around. Then insert a tight thread through those holes as they are pierced, then gather the circle as you would gather a napkin after placing in it what moisture, oils, or water you desire.
Then tie it to the apparatus and use it as you did with the bladder by pressing your hand until the moisture reaches the bladder.
Chapter Sixty.
On the Removal of Stones.
We have mentioned in the division the types of stones and their treatment with drugs, and I have described the difference between stones formed in the kidney and those formed in the bladder, along with all the signs. I also discussed the stones that require manual intervention and incision.
It is the stone that forms in the bladder specifically and which occurs in the urethra. I will describe this with clear explanation and conciseness.
I say that the stone that forms in the bladder most often affects children, and among its signs is that urine exits the bladder resembling water in thinness.
Sand appears in it, and it irritates the penis, and moves about; often it drops down and then spreads out, and the buttocks protrude in many cases. It is easy for boys to expel it until they reach fourteen years of age, but it is difficult for old men, while young people are somewhere in between.
The one whose stone is larger will find its treatment easier, and the opposite is true for smaller stones. When we turn to treatment, it is first necessary to enema the patient with an injection that expels all the fecal matter in his intestines, as it may prevent the detection of the stone during examination.
Then, take the patient by his legs and shake him gently downward to make the stone descend to the neck of the bladder, or have him jump from a raised position several times. Then sit him upright in front of you with his hands under your thighs so that the entire bladder tilts downward, then examine it.
Examine him externally; if you feel the stone in the space, proceed immediately to make an incision on it. If it does not come under your touch at all, then rub the index finger with oil from your left hand if the patient is a child, or the middle finger.
If the patient is a fully grown boy, insert your finger into his rectum and search for the stone until it comes under your finger. Then move it little by little to the neck of the bladder, then press on it with your finger and push it out towards the place you intend to make an incision.
Order a servant to squeeze the bladder with his hand, and order another servant to extend his right hand above the armpit and with his other hand to pull the skin below the armpit away from the place where the incision will be made. Then take the scalpel, which has this shape:.
Make the incision between the buttocks and the armpit, not in the middle but towards the left flank. The cut should be over the stone itself, with your finger in the buttock as you press it outward gently so that the external part of the cut is wide and the internal part narrow enough to facilitate the passage of the stone.
Do not make the incision too large, for you might press the stone with your finger in the buttock when making the cut, causing it to come out without difficulty. Be aware that there are stones with sharp edges and corners which may make their removal more difficult because of this.
There are also smooth stones that resemble acorns and rounded ones, which are easy to remove. However, if the stone has sharp edges and corners, you should slightly increase the size of the incision. If it does not come out this way, you must devise a method to grasp it firmly with a tightly folded cloth whose tip is like a spatula.
Ensure that you grasp the stone firmly so it does not slip from your hand. Alternatively, insert a delicate tool with a curved tip underneath it. If you are unable to do this, widen the incision slightly. If excessive bleeding occurs, stop it with a cautery.
If there is more than one stone, first push the larger one towards the bladder opening and make an incision for it. Then push the smaller stones after that. Do the same if there are more than two stones. If they are very large, it is unwise to make a large incision because it exposes the patient to one of two dangers.
Either he will die, or continuous urination will occur because the area will not heal at all; however, try to push it out so that it comes out whole, or use clamps to break it up so that it comes out in pieces.
When you have finished your work, wash the wound with bran decoction and vinegar, then bandage it tightly. Place a cloth soaked in oil and water or ointment made of rose oil and cold water over it to cool the hot swelling. Then let the patient lie on his back, and do not loosen the bandage until the third day.
When it has softened, wash the area with plenty of water and oil, then treat it with the palm ointment and parsley ointment until it heals. If there is an excessive hot swelling, ulceration, or something similar such as blood clotting in the bladder preventing urination, which can be identified by the presence of blood coming out with urine.
Insert your finger into the wound and remove that blood, for if it remains, it will lead to the corruption and putrefaction of the bladder. Then wash the wound with vinegar and water mixed with salt, and treat each type of issue with a suitable treatment until it heals.
Throughout the entire treatment period, it is advisable to bind the thighs and bring them together to stabilize the medicines applied to the area. If the stone is small and becomes lodged in the urethra, causing obstruction of urine flow, treat it with what I am about to describe before resorting to incision.
Often this treatment has spared the need for incision, as I have experienced. This involves using a tool made of steel, which looks like this: .
A sharp triangle is fixed on a stick, then take a thread and tie it to the stick below the stone so that it does not return to the bladder, then insert a forked iron gently into the urethra until the fork reaches the same stone.
Rotate the fork with your hand around the stone little by little, aiming to pierce it until it passes through the other side; then urine will immediately flow. Then squeeze what remains of the stone from outside the stick, and it will break apart and exit with the urine, and the patient will be cured.
If this treatment is not available to you due to obstacles, then tie a thread below the stone and another thread above the stone, then make an incision on the stone in the same stick between the ties, then remove it.
Then untie the ligatures and clean out the clotted blood that has formed in the wound. The reason for tying a thread below the stone is to prevent it from returning to the bladder, and the other tie above so that after removing the stone and untying the threads, the skin returns to its place and covers the wound.
Therefore, when you tie the upper thread, it is necessary for you to lift the skin up so that it returns to its place when you finish and covers the wound as we said.
Chapter Sixty-One.
On Removing Stones from Women.
Stones rarely form in women. If a woman does develop a stone, treatment is difficult for many reasons. One reason is that the woman may be unmarried, and another is that you cannot find a woman who would permit herself to be examined by a doctor.
If she is chaste or one of those related to her by blood, and the third case is that you do not find a woman who is skilled in this craft, especially manual work, and the fourth is that the position of the incision for the calculus is far from the calculus in women, so you need a deep incision.
There is danger in that. If necessity calls for it, you should seek a skilled female physician, but they are rare. If you cannot find one, then look for an honest and gentle male physician or bring in a midwife who is knowledgeable about women's matters or a woman who can offer some guidance in this craft.
Bring her and order her to do all that you instruct her to, such as examining the calculus first. If the woman is a virgin, she should insert her finger into the woman's rectum and examine the calculus; if she finds it, she should press it under her finger.
At that time, order her to make an incision on it. If she is not a virgin but a married woman, instruct the midwife to insert her finger into the patient's genital area and examine the calculus after placing her left hand on the bladder and pressing it well.
If she finds it, she should push the calculus from the mouth of the bladder downward to the extent of her ability until she reaches the base of the thigh. Then she should make an incision opposite half the genital opening at the base of the thigh, wherever it is most appropriate for her and where she feels the calculus.
Her finger should not leave the calculus, pressing it down. The initial incision should be small at first; then insert a probe into that small incision. If she feels the calculus, increase the size of the incision as much as needed for the calculus to be removed. Know that there are many types of calculi.
Of them there are small and large, smooth and rough, long and rounded and with grooves. Know their kinds so that you may find what you seek. If blood overcomes you, sprinkle in the place powdered astringent herbs and hold it for an hour until the bleeding stops, then return to your work.
Until the stone is removed. Prepare with yourself the instruments mentioned for removing stones from men, to assist you in your work. If blood overflows and you feel by the pulse that it is from a severed artery, place the cautery on the spot.
Secure it with bandages tightly and leave it without retouching. Do not remove the stone, for it may kill the patient. Then treat the wound. If after days the intensity of the bleeding subsides and the area becomes infected, return to your work until you remove the stone.
Chapter Sixty-two.
On Incising for Hydatid Cyst.
A hydatid cyst is the accumulation of moisture in the serous membrane, which is under the skin covering the testicle and is called scrotum. It may also occur in a special membrane prepared by nature on one side of the testicle.
It may be such that it seems like another testicle, and it lies between the skin of the testicle and the serous membrane we have mentioned. This occurs rarely, and this cyst is generated from a weakness affecting the seminal glands, causing this substance to accumulate there. It may also result from a blow to the genital area.
This moisture comes in many colors; it may be yellowish, or a reddish hue like blood, or a blackish green color, or a white watery appearance, which is the most common. The signs by which it is recognized.
Where water accumulates, if it is in the white serosa that we have mentioned, the swelling will be somewhat elongated, like the shape of an egg, and the testicle will not appear because the moisture surrounds it from all sides.
If the moisture is in a special membrane for it, then the swelling will be rounded on one side of the egg shape.
For this reason, a person may think it is another egg. If the moisture is between the skin of the testicle and the white serosa, it will be felt beneath the surface. And if you want to know the color of the moisture, pierce the swelling with the square probe whose image was described earlier; whatever comes out in the wake of the probe indicates what lies inside.
When it comes to treatment with iron, you should order the patient to have phlebotomy if it is possible for him and you see his body as full. Then he should lie on his back on something slightly elevated, place many cloths under him, and then you should sit to his left.
Order a servant to sit on his right side and extend the penis towards one side of the skin of the testicle and near the groin area. Then take a broad scalpel and make an incision along the middle length of the skin of the testicle, close to the groin.
Make the incision straight, parallel to the line that divides the skin of the testicle into two halves, until it reaches the white serosa containing it. Carefully peel this membrane without cutting it, and focus on peeling from the side closest to the egg-shaped structure as much as possible.
Then fill the bladder with water and tightly tie it, then remove all the water. Then separate the edges of the incision with forceps and stretch the bladder upwards without touching the skin covering the testicles. Cut the bladder as much as you can, either in one piece or in pieces.
In particular, be thorough with its thin side, for if you do not cut it completely, you cannot ensure that the water will not return. If the testicle protrudes outside its skin during your work, after finishing cutting the bladder, push it back and then sew together the edges of the skin of the scrotum.
Then treat it as you would any other wound until he recovers. If the testicle has become diseased due to another illness, you must tie off the vessels in the spermatic cord to prevent bleeding, then cut the testicle from the cord and remove it. Then treat him as previously mentioned.
If the water has collected on both sides, know that they are hydroceles. Incise the other side as you did the first, equally if need be; and if it is better for the work to be done in one sitting, do so. Then wipe away the blood.
Insert wool that has been soaked in oil or rose fat into the incisions. Then cover it with another layer of wool that has been soaked in a mixture of syrup and oil, spreading it over the testicles and the groins. Place a folded cloth on top, which is called a bandage. And secure it from above with a six-ended ligature in this manner:
Then take two pieces of cloth, sew them and stuff them with loose wool as in this example. Make the ends that will be tied together from wet cotton or wool. Gather them by pulling into a belt at the waist, and one end should go under the buttocks to the back.
The second method is to take it towards the groin and the extremities on the thighs from below, and the remaining extremities on the calves, and gather all the tension into the belt of the trousers. This dressing may also be made by cauterization instead of cutting with iron.
Take a fine, blade-like iron and cut with it the skin over the testicle while it is hot, as described, until the white serous cavity containing the fluid becomes visible. Then take another iron in this manner:.
It resembles the Greek eye, then press it on that serous cavity while it is hot until all the moisture is removed. Then stretch the serous cavity with clamps and peel off the layer containing it with an iron as much as possible until it is completely excised, being careful not to touch the testicle with fire.
Know that this method is safer, involves less bleeding, and is better than cutting. If you encounter any issues during the incision or cauterization such as a hot swelling, bleeding, or anything else, you should treat each issue appropriately as previously described.
If the patient is timid and cannot endure this procedure due to its severity, then let him use a poultice as I will describe, provided that it is appropriate based on the evidence we have presented.
The dressing is to be used for a fluid-filled swelling. You should seat the patient on a high chair, then press the swelling at its base with a broad scalpel. Apply a poultice along the length of the body, making the opening wide enough for all the fluid to drain out completely. Then place cotton over the area and secure it.
Leave it to heal the remaining fluid, then treat it until the wound heals. If it is difficult for the fluid to come out immediately, plug it up, as this may be due to the white membrane blocking at the mouth of the wound, preventing the fluid from coming out.
At this point, you should insert a goose feather into the wound or the tool used to extract honey, which was previously described, or slightly increase the opening of the wound.
Know that the fluid may return and accumulate after six months or so. If it accumulates, plug it up in the same manner and protect the patient during these days.
Chapter Sixty-Three.
On incising flesh tumors and their treatment.
Know that incising these tumors is one of the risks often leading to death in most cases. Therefore, we prefer to leave them untreated for safety and I will now describe how to deal with them and their types.
I say that many tumors can occur in the parts that make up the groin, and this happens due to various reasons, either from excess fluid that settles in the groin or from a blow. The color of the tumor is the same as the skin, and it does not contain fluid.
The tumor may be soft, or it might be hard like a stone, with no sensation. It can result from the complexity and swelling of arteries, as previously mentioned, or from the swelling of veins. If it is due to the swelling of arteries, this can be recognized by the dispersal of the tumor.
If you press it with your fingers, and it should not be exposed at all. As for the one that is from the swelling of the veins, nothing disperses from it when pressed by the fingers, and this type may be difficult to deal with and affects all other meats.
It involves cutting the skin of the scrotum, then lifting the testicle up and removing it from the white serous membrane. Free the spermatic cord from the vessels, tie off the vessels, and cut the spermatic cord after freeing it from all sides around the testicle. If the testicle has adhered to that growing flesh.
You should remove the testicle and cut it. If the adherence is with any part of the serous membranes or between the vessels, you should free all of that adherence and cut it in a circular manner.
If the growth of flesh is in the attachment area at the back, you should cut all of it and remove the testicle as we said. Once your work is complete, clean the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and liquid, then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Chapter Sixty-Four.
On the Treatment of Urinary Conditions with Daliah.
Daliah is a twisted swelling, some of the twisting resembling a bunch of grapes, with relaxation of the urethra and difficulty for the patient in movement, exercise, and walking. The treatment of this condition is closely related to what has been previously mentioned.
However, it is necessary to describe the procedure as the early practitioners did. So I say that you should seat the patient on a high chair, then push the spermatic cord downward, and then grasp the skin of the scrotum with your fingers along with the vessels that are close to the penis.
A servant other than you should hold it and stretch it very tightly, then cut it with a wide sharp scalpel along the vessels until the vessels are exposed, then peel it off from all sides as I mentioned to you in the peeling of the arteries in the sinews, then pierce it with a needle containing doubled thread.
And tie it at the beginning of the places where the drainage has spread, and also tie it at the end, then cut it in the middle with a vertical incision along the length of the body and remove what has gathered inside of the turbid and corrupted humors.
Then treat the wound as you would any other wounds where you want to allow a period for the vessels that nourish one of the ovaries to retract, which is acceptable. If the drainage affects all the vessels, it is necessary to remove one of the ovaries along with the vessels so that the egg does not lack nourishment. Before cutting the vessels, they wilt and cannot be used.
Chapter Sixty-Five.
On the Treatment of Intestinal Fistulas.
The occurrence of this fistula results from a tear in the membrane extending over the abdomen near the iliac regions of the abdominal walls, causing the intestine to protrude through that hernia towards one of the ovaries.
This hernia can either result from a tear in the membrane or its extension, and these two types occur due to many reasons such as a blow, a fall, a shout, lifting heavy objects, and so on. If it is caused by an extension of the membrane, it develops gradually over a long period of time.
It does not occur suddenly, and the swelling is even in depth because the omentum presses on the intestine; its sign is that if it comes from a perforation of the omentum, severe pain occurs suddenly at first, and the swelling appears different under the skin nearby.
This occurs with the protrusion of the intestine and its exit to the outside through the omentum, and sometimes fat tissue comes out with it; this is called an intestinal and fatty hernia, and it may occur with gas. Fecal matter can also flow into the intestine and be trapped there, leading to the death of the patient.
Because it causes severe pain and rumbling, especially if compressed. Treating these types of conditions with iron is dangerous, so you should be cautious about using it. The procedure involves instructing the patient to push the intestine back inside their body with their hand if it can be returned.
Then, have him lie on his back between your hands and raise his legs. Stretch the skin near the thigh upwards, then cut through all of the scrotal skin lengthwise. Then insert forceps into the edges of the incision to widen it as needed.
The incision should be large enough to allow the testicle to come out. Then peel back the omentum layers beneath the scrotal skin until the white, firm omentum is exposed on all sides. At this point, insert your index finger near the testicle.
Between the white omentum under the testicle's skin and the second layer, release any adhesions behind the testicle. With your right hand, fold it inward toward the scrotal skin, while with your left hand, lift the white omentum upward and raise the testicle along with the omentum towards the incision.
Order the servant to raise the egg above and release completely the adhesion that is behind. Examine with your finger to ensure there is nothing of the twisted intestine in the hard white serous membrane. If you find anything, push it into the abdomen below.
Then take a needle with a thick thread that is twisted from ten threads and insert it at the end of the serous membrane below the skin of the testicle, then cut the ends of the thread's twists so that there are four threads. Then arrange some of it over each other in a stiff manner and bind the serous membrane that we said is below the skin of the testicle tightly from two sides. Then wrap the ends of the threads as well and tie them very tightly so that nothing from the vessels that nourish it can reach it. So that inflammation does not occur, also make a second binding outside the first one, at a distance of less than two fingers' width from it. After these two bindings, leave a portion of the serous membrane below the skin of the testicle, measuring the width of a finger bone.
So that inflammation does not occur, also make a second binding outside the first one, at a distance of less than two fingers' width from it. After these two bindings, leave a portion of the serous membrane below the skin of the testicle, measuring the width of a finger bone. Cut the rest of it all in a circular manner and remove the egg with it, then make an incision at the bottom of the testicle's skin from which blood and pus will flow as we have described previously. Then use wool soaked in oil and place it in the wound, and apply the binding as described.
The white serous membrane can be cauterized after cutting it as a precaution against bleeding, as this often occurs. Leave the binding until it falls off on its own; if it delays in falling off, it should be soaked in hot water and then wrapped with something to sweat it until it falls off.
Then treat the wound with all treatments for wounds until it heals.
Chapter Sixty-Six.
In this arterial aneurysm, I have not seen anyone dare to treat it with iron. Earlier, I mentioned that it should be treated as described for the aneurysm associated with a vein, which involves gently ligating the vessels below after incising them.
Then incise it in the middle and treat the swelling with what opens it until the vessels fall out, and then treat the wound as described until it heals.
Chapter Sixty-Seven.
On the hernia that occurs in the groin.
A hernia may occur in the groin as we said; it contains the area, and little of the intestine descends into it. Even if something does descend, it is minimal and returns at all times.
However, if time passes and the condition persists, the peritoneum tear increases, causing the intestine and bladder to descend into the scrotum, as we mentioned this can happen due to the extension of the peritoneal lining in the groin area. This happens because the peritoneum extends, then relaxes, and the area becomes lax and protrudes. Its treatment is by cauterization as I have previously described.
It can also be treated with iron in this manner: the patient lies on their back, and you incise the swollen protruding area horizontally to a width of three fingers. Then suture the peritoneal layers under the skin.
Until the white mesentery is exposed, then take a patch and place it on the protruding part of the mesentery, press it into the depth of the abdomen, then suture the two protruding parts of the mesentery at the edge of the patch together with stitching.
Then pull the edge of the patch without cutting the mesentery at all, and do not touch the ovary or anything else as I informed you in the treatment of intestinal anastomosis. Then treat it with surgical treatments.
When the stitches come loose, clean them and repair the wound until it heals, for the mesentery will contract and the bulge will not increase.
Cauterization is better in this case because it is closer to safety.
Chapter Sixty-Eight.
On the relaxation of the scrotal skin.
The skin of the scrotum often becomes lax in some people, even though the underlying tissues do not become loose, making it unappealing in appearance. Those who wish to treat this should have the patient lie down on their back and sleep.
Cut away all the loose skin on the thick skin, then bring the edges together. If you prefer to stitch first, sew the excess relaxed skin with three or four stitches and secure them well, then cut between the stitches.
Then treat it as you would other wounds until it heals and the stitches fall out.
Chapter Sixty-Nine.
On Circumcision.
Circumcision is prohibited in our Shariah (Islamic law).
For this reason, it would be better for me not to mention it in this book. However, I have mentioned it for two reasons: one, so that the physician knows what to do if asked about it and how to treat those affected by it; the other reason is that we often need to castrate some animals for our benefit.
Such as lambs, goats, cats, and other animals. I say that castration is of two types: either by crushing or by cutting. The method involving crushing works as follows: the animal is seated in hot water until its scrotum relaxes, becomes soft, and hangs down.
Then you crush it with your hand until it loosens and cannot be felt upon touch. As for castration by cutting, you should hold the animal and squeeze the skin over its testicles with your left hand, then tie off the vessels and make a single incision on each testicle.
Until the testicles emerge, then cut them after peeling them, leaving only the thin layer of mesentery that covers the vessels. This type of castration is better than the one done by crushing.
Because crushing may leave some of the scrotal tissue, causing the animal to desire mating. Then treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter Seventy.
On the Treatment of Hermaphrodites.
The hermaphrodite in men is of two kinds; one of which is that there appears behind the space, or in the skin of the testicles between the scrotum, a shape like the vagina of a woman with hair, and urine may flow from what is in the skin of the testicles.
As for women, there is one kind and it appears above the vagina on the pubic region like those of men, though very small, with one appearing outward as if it were a man's penis, while the other two are like female genitalia. The treatment of the three types.
The two kinds in men and the one kind in women should have the excess flesh removed until its trace is eliminated, then treat them as with other wounds until they heal. As for the second kind of men from whom urine flows from what is in the skin of the testicles, there is no treatment for it at all, nor will it heal completely.
Chapter Seventy-One.
On the Cutting of the Clitoris and the Flesh Protruding from the Vaginas of Women.
The clitoris may increase in size beyond the natural measure, to the point that it becomes prominent and unattractive, and it may grow so large in some women that it spreads like it does in men, leading to intercourse.
It is necessary to grasp the excess of the clitoris with your hand or with pincers and cut it, but do not overdo the cutting, especially near the base, to avoid excessive bleeding.
Then treat it as you would treat other wounds until it heals. As for the protruding flesh, it is flesh that grows in the mouth of the uterus, filling it up.
And it may come out to the outside like a hernia. Therefore, some of the early physicians called it the tail disease; you should cut it as you would cut the clitoris and treat it until it heals.
Chapter Seventy-Two.
On the Treatment of Hernias.
Hernia is when a woman's genital area is not pierced or the hole is small, and it can be either natural from birth or acquired. The acquired type may result from a condition that has been mentioned previously and can be due to excess growth of flesh.
Or it may be a thin or thick membrane, and it can occur either deep in the uterus, on its sides, at the top, or at the bottom. It prevents intercourse, pregnancy, and childbirth, and may also prevent menstruation. The diagnosis is made by the midwife through examination.
If the obstruction is visible and close, then if it is not visible, examine it with her fingers or a probe. If the obstruction is from a thin membrane and is near the labia, proceed to puncture it by placing something resembling a needle on the labia, then apply your thumbs together.
The woman should lie on her back with her legs spread wide, then pull the labia apart forcefully to puncture the thin membrane and open the obstruction. Then take wool soaked in oil and apply it to the area. Have intercourse with the woman every day to prevent the area from closing again.
If the membrane is thick and dense, it should be cut with a broad scalpel resembling an aspen leaf. If the obstruction is from excess flesh, suspend it with forceps and cut it. Have medications to stop bleeding without causing pain, such as cumin, cinnamon, and frankincense mixed with egg white.
Then use a wide lead tube so that the wound does not heal too quickly, and keep it in place for several days. Use a dry linen wick, then treat with all treatments for suppuration until it heals. It may happen that new flesh grows in the uterus, so it should be cut in this manner.
Unless it is a cancerous tumor, do not treat a cancerous tumor in the uterus with iron at all.
Chapter Thirty-Seven.
On the treatment of hemorrhoids, warts, and red pimples that occur in the female genital area.
As for hemorrhoids, they are dilations of the veins until they bleed profusely and continuously. When hemorrhoids become advanced, they turn into warts. I have mentioned their types and signs in the classification, and we will mention them here.
What can be treated and what cannot be treated is as follows: I say that hemorrhoids and warts, if they are deep in the uterus and not apparent to the senses, cannot be treated with iron. Those that appear in the mouth of the uterus and are felt by the senses are treatable.
It is necessary to have the woman enter a cool room, then gently extend the warts with a spatula or rough cloth and cut them from their roots. Then apply one of the bleeding-stopping powders when the blood flows, without chewing.
Like qaqiya, shyan, laban, and similar substances. Then raise her legs to the wall for an hour, then let them dangle in cold water. If bleeding persists, sit her in a decoction of sumac peels, pomegranate rinds, flax, and similar ingredients. Then take ground barley flour, mix it with honey and vinegar.
Apply it to her back. If the bleeding stops, do so without restriction, and then take some wool and dip it in the juice of rue or the juice of the afterbirth or the juice of the willow branches with syrup, and keep it on the wound.
When the swelling subsides, treat the area with an ointment until it heals. As for the red pustule, it resembles the heads of intestinal parasites in appearance; it should be cut as described for warts, and treated until it heals.
Chapter Forty-Seven.
On the pus formation that occurs in the uterus.
Various types of tumors can occur in the uterus, such as cancer, calcified tumors, ulcers, fibroids, eating sores, hemorrhoids, fistulas, fissures, warts, and hot tumors. I have mentioned all these diseases, their types, and their signs in the classification.
It is necessary to discuss in this article the hot tumor that occurs in the uterus, if it is among the tumors that accumulate over time. It should be noted that if the pain of the tumor at its onset is sharp with throbbing, inflammation, and fever.
If you see it red and it reacts to touch, do not rush to incise it; treat it with what aids maturity until these symptoms subside. Then the woman should sit on a chair with two seats and lean back.
She should draw her legs toward the lower part of her abdomen, spread her thighs apart, place her arms under her knees, and tie them with a suitable strap.
Therefore, the midwife sits on the right side and uses the instrument for opening the mouth of the uterus, which will be shown later in its image. If you want to use this instrument, you must estimate the depth of the woman's uterus so that what enters through the instrument does not exceed the depth of the uterus.
If the instrument exceeds the depth, it is necessary to place guards on the lip of the cervix to prevent the entire instrument from entering the depth of the uterus. It is also advisable that the tube running through the instrument should be inserted from the upper side.
While you hold the instrument, the servant should rotate the tube until the cervix is opened. When the abscess becomes visible and can be touched with a hand, if it feels soft and thin, you must cut it at its base with a broad scalpel once all of the pus has been evacuated.
It is necessary to place a soft candlewick soaked in rose oil or green oil that contains some astringent within the wound, with the candlewick exiting from the opening in the cervix. Clean wool dipped in water that has been boiled with herbs should be applied externally on the uterus and on the pubic area.
Then treat it with an ointment suitable for this condition after two days until it heals.
The uterus and the wound can be washed by injecting water and honey, followed by water that has been boiled with the root of sarsaparilla or long spurge. Then return to using the ointment. If the abscess is hidden inside the uterus.
It is necessary to refrain from treating it with iron and instead treat it as mentioned in the classification.
Chapter Fifty-Seven.
Regarding the instruction on how midwives should treat living fetuses if they emerge in an abnormal position.
The midwife should first know the form of normal delivery; one of its signs is when you see the woman straining downward, wanting to breathe, and finding some relief from her labor pains.
The fetus will be born quickly; know that this delivery is normal, and the fetus will emerge head first, with the placenta following or hanging from its navel. If you see these signs, you should massage her abdomen to help the fetus come out more quickly.
If it descends head first, the placenta will come out with it, and you should clean any remnants thoroughly. Any delivery other than this is abnormal and undesirable, as the fetus may emerge feet first or even with its hands coming out before its head and feet.
It may present with one hand or one foot first, or the head and one hand, or it may emerge folded, or even flip over onto its back. Such forms are undesirable. The midwife should be skilled and careful in dealing with all these situations and beware of mistakes and errors.
I will explain each form and how to handle it so that you can understand and act accordingly. If the fetus emerges head first but the delivery is difficult for the woman, and you see her strength weakening, sit her on a chair and have other women assist in supporting her.
Wrap her uterus with cooked fenugreek and wet oils, then the midwife should insert a small probe between her fingers to cut the umbilical cord or use her nail to sever it until the moisture inside flows out, and massage the woman's abdomen to help deliver the fetus.
If it does not come out, it is necessary to administer enema to the woman with lupine saliva mixed with sesame oil; then after the administration of the enema, order her to sneeze with the condys and hold her mouth and nose, for the fetus will come out immediately. If the baby's hand comes out first, it should be gently pushed back little by little.
If entry does not become possible, place the woman on a platform and raise her legs upwards, then shake the platform on the ground while the woman holds on to prevent falling. If the hands do not enter and the fetus dies, cut them off and pull out the rest of the fetus.
Or tie his hands with a cloth and pull them gently; he will come out. The emergence of the fetus on its feet, if the fetus emerges on its feet, it is necessary to push them upwards, then gradually turn the fetus little by little until it is aligned, then take one of its legs and extend it little by little.
When they come out to the thighs, order her to sneeze with condys; it will come out. If it does not come out as described, then gently push the fetus back little by little until it is in the natural position; then it will emerge smoothly at that time. If it resists despite all of the above methods.
Take the saliva of the lupine, sesame oil, and dissolved gum; mix all well in a mortar. Then apply it to the woman's genitals and lower abdomen, then have her sit in warm water until it reaches her buttocks.
When you see that her lower part has softened, prepare a suppository of myrrh for her to bear. When she holds the suppository for an hour, have her sit on the chair and make her sneeze while holding her mouth and nose closed, then gently press her lower abdomen; the fetus will come out immediately, coming out on its knees and hands.
If it comes out in this manner, then he should gradually insert his hands little by little. Then the woman should lie on her back and let her heels hang down while she is lying on the bed, and she should clasp her hands together. Then he should squeeze over her abdomen little by little. Then remove the cushions from under her feet so that she is raised up. If the fetus does not come out, take both of her feet and move them vigorously. Then squeeze gently over the pubis little by little until the fetus rises up. Then the midwife should insert her hand and adjust the fetus little by little.
Instruct the woman to bear down until the fetus comes out. If the fetus is coming out obliquely with one hand hanging down, try to push back its hand. If you cannot push it back, then have the woman stand and walk. If she cannot walk, then have her lie down.
Have her lie on her bed and shake her legs vigorously. Then use the method described with saliva applications. If she experiences contractions, have her sit on a chair and work on pushing back the hand and adjusting the fetus to its natural position. Then make her sneeze and instruct her to bear down until it comes out.
If the fetus comes out on its back with its hands stretched out and its face towards its mother's back, the midwife should grasp the fetus's hand and turn it little by little gently. Once it is in position, apply the ointment and saliva applications as described.
Then instruct her to move little by little. Once she does that, have her sit on the chair and lean to the right side. Then instruct her to bear down and make her sneeze with the kundus; it will come out if the fetus is positioned on its side upright.
When it descends to the mouth of the uterus in this manner with the placenta, cut the placenta with your nail until you remove the moisture. If it adheres to the face and neck of the fetus, cut it from the navel so that it does not suffocate and die; then push the fetus inside until it is as it should be.
Instruct the woman to squat several times, for it will come out easily, like twins or many fetuses. Know that twins often are born and sometimes three or four may be born and live, but this is rare. As for five, it is beyond nature and they do not live at all.
They are enclosed by one placenta, even if there are many of them, and they separate by a membrane barrier attached to the navel of each. They may be born normally and easily as a single fetus would, or they may be born in a manner that is undesirable, as described.
If some of them are difficult to deliver and become abnormal in shape, treat them as described. The midwife should be gentle, act with care and deliberation, and devise ways to handle each form with the skill needed to ensure safety.
Describe what can be conceived in the uterus and then abort, there may be one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, or more than ten. It has been verified by me that a woman aborted seven and another fifteen, all of them conceived together.
By the decree of the Almighty, all of this should be known by the midwife, for she may one day encounter such a situation and must handle it as appropriate.
Chapter Sixty-Seven.
In the Removal of a Dead Fetus.
If you have treated the dead fetus with the methods mentioned in the division of treatment and it has not been expelled, and you are compelled to intervene manually, then you should examine her. If the woman is strong and there are no symptoms that might be feared for causing harm, she should lie down on a bed on her back.
Her head should be tilted downwards, and her legs raised. A helper should hold her from both sides or secure her to the bed so that her body does not pull back when the fetus is being extended.
Then, moisten the mouth of her womb with damp fat mixed with camel milk, fenugreek, and flax seeds. The midwife should then lubricate her hand with this mixture and gently insert it into the uterus to locate a suitable place to grasp the fetus, in areas appropriate for that purpose.
Examine if the fetus is positioned to descend head first. Then grasp it by its eyes, back of the head, mouth, palate, under the chin, temples, near the ribs, or under the throat.
If the fetus is positioned to descend feet first, then grasp it in the groin or in the middle ribs. You should hold the instrument with your right hand and place it between the fingers of your left hand, gently inserting it and grasping the fetus in one of the mentioned areas.
Continue until you reach an empty space, then insert another instrument opposite it or a third one if needed to ensure even traction and prevent tilting in any direction. Then pull gently but evenly, not just straight but moving it in all directions.
To facilitate its expulsion as is done with a tooth when it is extracted. It is advisable in this case to loosen the ligatures; if one part of it is obstructed, some of the midwife’s fingers should be anointed with oil and inserted to turn what is obstructed. If part of the fetus emerges, the straps should be moved to other positions.
It is slightly higher; do this until the entire fetus is delivered. If a hand emerges before anything else and cannot be returned due to compression, wrap it with a cloth and pull it out until everything has emerged, then cut the cloth.
Whether it is at the wrist joint or the elbow, do the same for the other hand and both legs. If the baby’s head is large and faces difficulty in emerging due to compression, or if there is fluid accumulation in its head, a spinal needle should be inserted between the fingers.
Use it to make an incision in the head to let out the fluid, or use a tool called a mukhadhakh, which is illustrated along with other tools in the section that follows.
Do the same if the fetus has an inherently large head; you should either cut the skull or crush it with the mukhadhakh as previously stated, then remove the bones with pincers. If the head emerges and becomes stuck at the clavicle, make an incision to allow the fluids in the chest to drain.
The chest will then close up. If the chest does not close and delivery is not possible, cut as much as you can. If there is swelling below the abdomen or if it is hardened, peel it back to allow the fluids to drain.
If the fetus is positioned on its feet, then pulling it out is easy and leveling it to the mouth of the womb is simple. If it is compressed against the abdomen or chest, you should pull it out with a cloth wrapped around your hand and cut open the abdomen or chest until what is inside flows out.
If you remove all the other organs and the head is retracted and obstructed, the midwife should insert her left hand. If the mouth of the womb is open, she should insert her hand into the cervix and search for the head with it, then pull it by the fingers to the mouth of the womb, then insert a cannula or two and pull it out with them.
If the mouth of the womb has closed due to a hot swelling, you should not force it but instead use applications of moist and fatty substances, apply poultices, and sit in water that relaxes and moisturizes.
And if the fetus is on its side, then if it can be aligned, use what we have mentioned for a living fetus. If that cannot be done, cut it piece by piece and remove it. It is essential not to leave any part of the placenta inside at all. Once you are finished with your treatment, apply what we have mentioned for treating hot swellings that occur in the womb.
If bleeding occurs, then she should sit in contracting baths and use all other treatments. I have seen a woman who was pregnant, the fetus died inside her, and then she became pregnant with it again.
Then the second fetus also died, and after a long time, a swelling appeared in her lower abdomen, which became inflamed until it burst and began to discharge pus. She was called for treatment, and I treated her for a long time, but the wound did not heal, so I applied some strong ointments that draw out the infection.
A bone then came out of the area, and after several days another bone came out. I was amazed by this because there are no bones in the abdomen, so I supposed that they were from the bones of the dead fetus. I examined the wound and removed many bones from the skull of the fetus.
I continued this until I removed many bones, and the woman was in the best of health. She lived like this for a time, with pus coming from the area, and that is why I mention this rare case here.
Because it contains knowledge and assistance for what the skilled physician attempts to achieve with his hands in treatment,.
Chapter Seventy-Seven.
It contains images of the instruments needed for removing the fetus.
An image of a dilator used to open the mouth of the uterus:.
This clamp is used to even out books; there are dilators at the ends of the two pieces of wood. However, this dilator should be finer than the clamp and should be made either of ivory or boxwood, with each piece of wood having a thickness of about two fingers.
And their width is about one finger, and their length is one and a half handbreadths. In the middle of the two pieces of wood are rods made of the same type of wood, securely fastened to them; these rods are about half a handbreadth long or slightly more, with a width of about two fingers or slightly more.
These are the ones that are inserted into the mouth of the uterus to open it when you rotate the dilators. An image of another instrument similar to this, finer and lighter:.
It is made of ivory or boxwood in the shape of pincers, but it has two prongs at its end as you see; each prong is about a handbreadth long and two fingers wide. When you want to open the uterus with it.
Seat the woman on a bed with her legs dangling and spread apart. Then insert these two prongs into the mouth of the uterus simultaneously, holding the end of the instrument between your thighs below. Then open your hand with the instrument as you would with pincers, to whatever degree you wish to open the uterus. Until the midwife accomplishes what is desired, here is an image of another speculum mentioned by earlier authors:.
Image of the instrument used to expel the fetus:.
Image of the instrument used to dilate the baby's head:.
It resembles scissors, with teeth at the end as you can see. It may also be made rectangular like pincers, as in this image, with teeth like those of a saw to cut tendons:.

All these instruments, the more varied they are and the better prepared they are by the craftsman, the faster he can work and the higher he will be regarded for his skill. Do not underestimate any of them as being unnecessary, for you may need each one of them.

In the Removal of the Afterbirth.
If the afterbirth is retained after childbirth, it is necessary to instruct the patient to hold her breath, then make her sneeze with cyperus and press your hand over her mouth and nostrils. If it comes out by this method, otherwise take a quantity [of another substance].
And make a hole in the cover, place herbs that open the mouth of the uterus inside it, such as fenugreek, savory, fennel, chamomile, wormwood, saussurea, and squill, either all of these or some of them. Cover them with water and put them on the fire. Then place a silver tube on the hole in the pot cover, and the other end in the mouth of the uterus.
And hold it until the steam reaches the bottom of the uterus, then make her sneeze as we said. The afterbirth will come out quickly. If it remains after this treatment and does not come out, instruct the midwife to dip her left hand in schiraz oil or the spittle of a snail.
Then she should insert it into the vagina and search for the afterbirth with it. When she finds it, she should grasp it and pull it out little by little. If it is adhered deep in the uterus, insert the hand as described until you find the afterbirth, then pull it out little by little with care.
To avoid the uterus falling out due to excessive pulling, it is necessary to gently move it side to side, right and left, then gradually increase the amount of traction. It will respond at this point and detach from its adhesion. If the mouth of the uterus is closed, we have described the treatment with sneezing and the treatment of the pot and herbs.
If it does not come out as we have described, beware of using force in attempting to draw it out again. However, you should tie what has emerged to the mouth of the uterus to the woman's thigh, then administer the quadruple ointment, for it will preserve it after several days.
It will dissolve and come out, except that if it putrefies, a foul smell will rise to the stomach and head, which will distress the patient. Therefore, it is necessary to use appropriate smoking treatment.
Therefore, some early practitioners tried smoking with charcoal and dry figs. Here is the image of the apparatus used to fumigate women in cases of retained menstrual blood, placenta, and similar conditions:.
It is made of lead and resembles a funnel, or it can be made of copper. The narrow end is placed in the patient's vagina while the wide end is over the fire. Place the incense on the ember and hold it until the incense is gone, then repeat with more incense.

On the Treatment of an Unruptured Anencephalic Infant. Note: The term "مقعدة" (muqaddah) traditionally refers to a stillborn or deformed infant, often in historical medical texts discussing conditions where intervention was necessary due to incomplete development or death in utero. However, context is crucial as the precise translation might vary based on the exact medical practice being described. Given the instruction not to add explanations, the direct translation provided should suffice.
Many boys are born with their fontanelles not perforated, which may be closed by a thin membrane. The midwife should puncture this membrane with her finger; if she cannot do so, she should incise it carefully with a sharp instrument, being cautious not to touch the muscle.
Then place a wool pad soaked in the decoction and oil on it, and treat it with ointments until it heals. If you fear that it may close up again, insert a lead tube into the opening for several days; remove it when the child is ready to defecate.
And the rectum may also be obstructed by the suppuration of a wound or a tumor; it is necessary to incise that suppuration and then treat it as we have mentioned in treatment and dressing.
Chapter Eighty.
On the Treatment of Hemorrhoids Occurring Below.
Hemorrhoids occurring below are complications and thickening that occur near the rectum externally or in the space from one side, and they can be one or more.
If that complication persists, it will open and discharge watery white moisture or thin pus. Some of these hemorrhoids may penetrate to the anus and intestines, while others do not. The penetrating ones can be identified by what is discharged with the stool and flatulence when the patient defecates.
It is also possible for worms to come out of them. Some may be hemorrhoids that, if they are in the space and penetrate to the bladder and urethra or to the hip joint and the buttock cleft, can be identified by their differences from those that do not penetrate to the rectum.
Insert your index finger into the rectum and insert a thin probe into the hemorrhoid, made of copper or iron. If there is no curvature in the hemorrhoid, use a thin lead probe or a fine hair from a horse's tail if it does curve.
Until you feel the probe or hair in your finger. If you do not feel it at all and nothing comes out of the opening, such as stool, flatulence, or worms as we said, then know that it is not penetrating, so proceed with treatment immediately.
And if the fistula communicates with the bladder or the urethra, its sign is the passage of urine through it and the inability of the affected area to heal with medications; as for when it communicates with the hip joint or the sacral region, its sign is the probe reaching there.
If it does not communicate with the bone and if pain occurs in a particular area, and pus is always discharged from it, and if no treatment is effective and it does not heal with ointments, then such fistulas will never be cured.
Treatment for it is futile and troublesome for those ignorant physicians who attempt it. As for the fistula that is not communicating and is not chronic, recovery can be hoped for with iron, as I will describe and what I have tried; this involves laying the patient down in front of you on his back.
He should lift his legs up, with his thighs tilted toward his abdomen. Then insert a copper or lead probe into the fistula if it has a bend, until you know where the probe ends. If the patient feels it near the buttocks, then you should insert your index finger into the buttocks.
If you feel the probe has passed by itself clearly without feeling any membrane or flesh between your finger and it, then be certain that it is communicating. Do not waste effort on it, as it will not heal as we have said.
Some have said that it may heal in some people rarely. Among the treatments hoped for benefit from is heating a thin iron according to the width of the fistula as previously mentioned, and inserting it while hot into the fistula until it reaches near the buttocks, then repeating this two or three times.
Until you know that all the excess fatty tissues that resemble a bird's quill have been burned, then treat it with a bandage soaked in fat until the burned flesh is removed, then apply salves. If it heals.
Otherwise, it will never heal without other treatment. If you insert an probe and it does not reach the finger in the buttock, and there is a thick layer of flesh or fat between them, and you see the fistula beneath the skin surface, then cut the skin from the beginning of the fistula at that time. As you proceed with the incision using the probe within the fistula until you reach where the tip of the probe ends, then remove the probe and it will fall out. Then clean those fatty tissues that resemble a bird's quill tube and do not leave any of them behind.
Then treat it with unguents until it heals. If blood overpowers you and prevents you from cutting those tissues, the best thing to do and the quickest benefit is to cauterize it with fire or a sharp medicine because cauterizing with fire combines two good outcomes: burning the excess flesh.
And to stop the bleeding and dry the moisture, then treat it with bandages soaked in fat or powdered sulfur in oil until the area suppurates and the burned flesh comes out with the pus. Then treat the wound with unguents that promote the growth of solid flesh.
These are medicines that have astringent and drying properties; if the wound has healed, then it is cured. Do not stuff the fistula. If the fistula extends deep into the buttock and is far from the body surface, insert your finger into the buttock and examine it.
If you feel with the probe and there is a membrane or flesh between it and the abscess, and it is close to drainage, then the treatment is only by hope and expectation. This means that one of three approaches should be used: either cauterize it as we have said.
Or you may incise it until you reach the bottom, so that you can insert a wick and treat it directly. Do not extend the incision too far to avoid cutting the muscle surrounding the thigh, which could cause involuntary bowel movements. Then treat him as we have mentioned; he may recover as we said.
Or you may penetrate that membrane and puncture it after incising it near the thigh as we said, either with a probe or another sharp instrument. Then thoroughly clean all the inflamed tissue in the incision as much as possible.
Then suture the entire wound along with the incision and the upper opening until it is sealed, leaving the fistula open inside the thigh, which will be less burdensome for the patient. The fistula may heal in this manner.
And if you insert the probe into the fistula and it is on the side of the thigh near the surface of the body with the skin and circumference of the thigh, then take a probe with a perforated tip like a shoemaker's needle as shown in this illustration:.
And insert a twisted thread made of five or so threads into it, then insert the probe with the thread into the fistula until it reaches the bottom. If it is draining near the inner edge of the thigh.
Then remove the thread from that hole by inserting your finger into the thigh and pulling out one end of the thread, gather both ends together and tie them tightly. Leave it for a day or two; every time the thread is cut by the flesh, tie it securely until the inflamed tissue between the threads falls off. Then treat the wound until it heals and the patient recovers.
If the mouth of the fistula is not patent, then open it as much as you can, except if it is very deep, in which case you should not do so to avoid cutting the muscle. Then proceed as described until it heals.
The scalpel used to incise fistulas should have one sharp edge for the cutting and the other side should be blunt so as not to cut unnecessary tissue, as you can see:.
Chapter Eighty-One.
On puncturing hemorrhoids that bleed, their excision, and the treatment of fissures.
Hemorrhoids can be of two types: they may be inside the rectum, resembling small red grapes or clusters of grapes, with some being larger and others smaller, and blood constantly oozing from them.
They can occur singly or in multiples and may be outside the rectum at its edges. However, those that are outside the rectum are usually less moist, with yellow fluid or a small amount of blood oozing from them constantly, and they match the color of the skin.
The treatment for hemorrhoids inside the rectum is to instruct the patient to defecate and strain until the rectum protrudes, then quickly grasp the hemorrhoids with hemostats or hold them with your nail and cut them at their roots. If the hemostats do not hold due to their moisture and laxity,
then trim them with a rough cloth or a piece of salted bread, or pull them out with your fingers and cut them. Then sprinkle some sharp powder on the area after cutting to serve as a cauterization alternative, or treat them as previously described in the section on cauterization.
Then treat it with all treatments until he is cured. If the rectum does not respond to evacuation, then administer an enema containing a little stinging agent to wash out what is in the rectum and facilitate quick evacuation when the patient strains. As for warts that protrude from the rectum, their treatment is easy and straightforward.
You should take it with your fingernail or attach it to a hook and cut it, then treat it as mentioned until it heals. For those who dislike cutting with metal, you should use this method: take twisted thread and insert it into a needle.
Then pull the wart upwards and pierce it with a needle from the opposite side at its base. Tie the ends of the thread under the needle, which is perpendicular to it, and tighten the wart firmly. Then tie off the thread and remove the needle. Do this for all warts except one that you should leave untreated.
To allow the impurities of blood to flow out, then place a pad soaked in rose ointment or cyroti on the rectum and instruct the patient to remain still. Leave it until the warts fall off, then treat them with salves and other treatments until they heal.
As for the treatment of fissures, they often occur due to dry feces and constipation. If it persists and medicines are ineffective, you should expose it with a scalpel blade or your fingernail until it becomes moist and remove the upper layer that prevents healing.
Then treat it until it heals properly. If it does not heal, repeat the exposure more thoroughly than before until it bleeds and the skin is removed, then treat it again; it will eventually heal.
Chapter Eighty-Second.
Regarding the treatment of reversed and non-reversed nails, corns, and warts.
A nail is a circular knot that matches the color of the body, resembling the head of a nail. It appears throughout the body but especially on the soles of the feet and the toes, causing pain when walking.
It is necessary to cut around the nail and grasp it with a small pincers or forceps, then remove it from its root. Then treat it, or if you wish, cauterize it as previously described in that section. As for dry corns, each one is a small rough, wrinkled, circular growth on the surface of the body.
They often appear on children's hands. Treatment involves stretching the corn and cutting it out or piercing it with silk thread or a hair until it falls off. Alternatively, you can cauterize it with fire or a sharp medicament as previously described.
Reversed and non-reversed corns can be removed with the instrument I describe in the treatment of warts. A wart is also a small, wrinkled, thick growth on the surface of the body that penetrates deeply. If it is affected by cold, one feels a sensation similar to an ant bite.
It can appear throughout the body, but most often in the hands. Treatment involves taking a tube from an eagle feather or a strong bird's feather and placing it over the wart until the tube encircles it completely. Then rotate your hand around the tube to cut around the wart.
And you make it to the depth of the flesh and remove the worm from its root, and if you wish, do this with a copper or iron tube in this manner:.
The top of the tube should be smooth and twisted to make it easy for the fingers to grip and twist, and if you wish, you can cauterize the worm as previously described in the section on cauterizing warts.
Chapter Eighty-Three.
On the forms of instruments used for injecting into diseases of the rectum, diarrhea, and colonic conditions.
The enema can be made of silver, porcelain, or hammered copper, and these instruments can be made in various sizes according to their intended use. Those used for treating small boys should be smaller, and for those whose rectums are narrow or painful, their enemas should be very gentle. Image of a large enema: .
The upper part where the tube is attached should be wide, as shown. There is a barrier where the tube is secured, as you can see. The lower end that enters the rectum should be smooth and straight. On one side, there are two holes, and on the other side, there is one hole.
The size of the hole should be as thick as a finger or slightly thicker. The tube in which the medicine is placed can be made from an animal bladder or lamb skin, shaped like a small dish, with a diameter of about one inch.
It should be perforated with many holes, each about a finger's width apart. Then, a thin thread made of ten or so strands is threaded through these holes to secure the tube like a small dish. When the medicine is placed in it, tie the nozzle tightly between the stones and then use it for enema. This is a circular image of the syringe and the hole:.
The method of using it for enema is to fill the membrane or bladder with medicine that is warm to the patient's tolerance; beware that it should not be too hot or too cold. Then, the patient lies on their back and lifts their legs up.
Place a cushion or blanket under him, then grease the nozzle with oil, egg white, chickpea saliva, or something similar. Then gently insert it into the rectum, and the attendant should hold the syringe with both hands and squeeze it vigorously until all of its contents are emptied into the intestine.
Then remove the syringe and have the patient lift his legs up to the wall. If the medicine prompts movement to be expelled, let it take its course as much as possible; if he sleeps through the night, it is more beneficial for recovery. If an enema is given due to diarrhea and there is a hurry for its expulsion, then administer another enema until he recovers.
If there are hemorrhoids or painful tumors in the rectum, then use a very gentle and smooth syringe, like those used for children, and this is an image of a delicate syringe with its leather tied on:.
Chapter Eighty-Four.
On the Treatment of Wounds.
I have mentioned in the division the treatment of what is similar to cauterizations, and here I will describe their treatment by hand and with drugs in full detail. I say that wounds differ according to the cause of the wound and according to the location where the injury occurs.
The causes of wounds are many, such as a stone cut, a sword or knife cut, a spear, stick, arrow, or similar things.
As for wounds according to their locations on the body, they may occur on the head, neck, chest, abdomen, liver, or similar organs.
I describe the treatment of some wounds as a model for other wounds. I begin with simple head wounds in particular, because complex ones will be mentioned at the beginning of the third chapter of this book.
I say that when a simple wound occurs on the head without a bone fracture, I examine it. If it is from a stone cut or similar and only the skin has been pierced, and if the wound is large and I fear that inflammation might occur, then I immediately proceed to treat it by incision at the site. Do not delay this, and let blood from him according to his strength if there is no contraindication for it, especially if the blood coming out of the wound is minimal. Let the bleeding be from the opposite side of the wounded area.
Warn the patient against overeating and consuming heavy foods. If there is a contraindication for letting blood, then reduce his food intake and avoid meat and rich drinks. If inflammation occurs in the wound, apply cotton dipped in rose oil or with a decoction that has astringent properties.
If there is no fear of inflammation, then if the wound is fresh and has not been altered by exposure to air, apply his own blood as a dressing. If it has been exposed to air, then apply some ointment.
Until the pus matures, then treat it until he recovers. If the wound is large and has been caused by a sword or something similar, and its edges do not come together with bandages, join them with sutures as I will describe in the section on suturing abdominal wounds.
If the skin is exposed and adheres only slightly to a small depression in the bone, cut it off and then treat the wound with medicines that will form tough flesh instead of skin. Instruct the patient to eat foods that are strengthening, such as heads (of animals), testicles, and similar foods.
If the skin becomes gangrenous and does not adhere to the bone, cut away all of the affected tissue and discard it, then treat the wound. If there is an artery or vein in these wounds that continues to bleed and the bleeding cannot be stopped with medications, search for the source of the bleeding.
If you reach it but amputation is not necessary, cut it with a scalpel and ligate it. If circumstances demand it and what has been mentioned does not suffice, cauterize it until the bleeding stops. If these wounds are small and simple, their treatment is easy; they can be managed by applying this powder dressing while still bleeding.
Before the air changes it, the recipe for the powder is as follows: take one part of loban (frankincense), two parts of shiyan (likely a plant-based ingredient), and three parts of lime (either slaked or unslaked). Grind all ingredients together, sift them, and pack the wound with this powder tightly so that it adheres well.
It will clot with blood, then bind it from above with bandages and leave it undisturbed as long as it does not become inflamed, for the medicine will not be detached until he recovers. This can also be done with lime alone if you do not have access to frankincense and shiyan.
This action can also be performed with his eyes in many major surgeries if he skillfully applies it and tightens it, and the wounds are fresh with blood, unless they have been altered by the air; as for when they have changed somewhat due to the air, especially in summer.
There is no special meaning in applying this poultice; treat it as we have mentioned, by placing some mature ointment on it, or make a paste of barley flour prepared with water and honey until the pus spreads, then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
However, if a fracture occurs in the bone with the wound and it is minor, pull it with plaster. I have mentioned the treatment of skull fractures in what will be discussed later, in neck surgery. If the wound occurs in the neck, there is no difference in treatment between a neck wound and a head wound if they are simple.
If a nerve or artery has been severed from the neck, then if it is a nerve, there is no remedy other than to avoid treating it with substances that cause strong constriction such as zincar and zaj and the like, because they harm the nerve and constrict it.
Do not apply anything cold to the wound at all, because the nature of the nerve is cold and it is connected to the brain, which is the noblest organ. What you should use in treatment are soft medicines like washed rue with fresh water several times moistened with oil or rose fat and myrtle fat.
If it is also washed with fresh water and other metallic stones in this manner and moist ointments, and if the wound is large, use suturing or close its edges with bandages, then treat it until it heals.
If the wound is deep and there is a pocket at its base where pus has accumulated, plug it in the lowest part of that pocket. If an artery is cut in the wound and blood is flowing, then either tie it off or cauterize it if the situation demands it.
If the wound has cut some of the tracheal rings or all of them, but the veins are intact, then bring together the edges of the skin around the trachea with sutures without touching the trachea. Instead, smooth it out and return it to its natural shape, then secure it tightly and leave it for several days.
Then treat it with ointments that have a constricting and drying effect until it heals. If the wound has affected the bone, probe it; if there are bone fragments in it, remove them all or as much as possible. Leave what cannot be removed until the wound is fully healed and it becomes easier to extract them.
If the wound is fresh, sprinkle on the powder we have described. If the bone in the wound becomes septic and forms a fistula, treat it with the methods described in its section, which is about chest surgery and the area between the shoulders.
If the wound is from a spear or knife and you see that it goes deep, observe if air comes out when the patient breathes. If so, know that it is a fatal wound. If it does not go deep and is fresh with blood, do not apply powder immediately or tighten it, lest the blood be trapped in its depth.
It can lead to the heart and kill the patient, but apply an adhesive ointment and change it twice a day. If you do not have ointment, place a used cotton plug in the wound opening to absorb any moisture that comes out, and ensure the patient sleeps with the wounded area elevated.
Do not bandage it tightly, even if three or more days have passed since the injury, and you see no convulsions, bad thumping, or shortness of breath in the patient, and all other conditions are good; then know that the wound is sound, so treat it with bandaging and other treatments until it heals.
If it is difficult to see and the pus continues to flow constantly, then know that it has become an abscess; treat it from its opening. The patient with the wound should be positioned so that it drains freely. If the wound is on the chest or back, treat it as previously described for suturing.
If it is large, treat it accordingly; if small, treat it as such. If it has affected the bone and pieces of the bone have been broken off, examine the wound and promptly remove those pieces if they are healthy. If they are not healthy, leave them for the time being.
If the wound becomes gangrenous, it will be easier to remove them. As for other wounds occurring in various organs, their treatment rules are as we have mentioned.
Chapter Eighty-Five.
On wounds of the abdomen and the protrusion of the intestines and their suturing.
A wound that affects the abdomen may be large, small, or medium. A large wound may protrude an intestine or several intestines, making their replacement and suturing more difficult and challenging.
A small wound can also be challenging from another perspective, making its replacement more difficult. The intestine, if not promptly returned to its place, will inflate and thicken, making it harder to reinsert. Therefore, the medium-sized wound is considered the best type because it does not make replacing the intestines as difficult as it would be with these two types.
Know that suturing the abdomen has four aspects; two of them are general and suitable for suturing the abdomen as well as other parts of the body, while the other two are specific but more particularly applicable to suturing the abdomen.
I will describe it to you one by one with explanation. So I say that if the wound is small and part of the intestine comes out and it is difficult to return it, this is for one of two reasons: either because the wound is small as we said, or because the intestine has become distended due to exposure to cold air.
If this is the case, it is necessary to warm it by dipping a sponge or damp cloth in lukewarm water alone or boiled with Eichhornia crassipes (edkhra'), Ziziphus spina-chiniae (saidi), and barley ears (sanabil), then apply it to the intestine until the distension subsides.
It can also be done with a drink that has a contracting effect, which is better than water alone for relieving distension. When you see that the distension has subsided, wet the intestine with water boiled with hawthorn (khatmi) or sumac (khbabzi), as this will facilitate its repositioning with less effort.
If it is difficult to return the intestine even after this treatment, make a small incision in the wound with the instrument used for treating hemorrhoids. The initial treatment, if successful, is better than making an incision. An incision should only be resorted to as a last measure when other methods have failed and there is no alternative. This is the image of the instrument:
One side of the instrument should be curved and limited, while the other side is unlimited. The fine tip should not be as sharp as a scalpel but slightly thicker. This tool resembles a small trocar, as you can see. If the wound has widened and the intestine has entered, it should be returned to its natural position.
His special place if you can achieve it is best; as for if the incision is wide and is in the lower abdomen, then the patient should lie on his back with his legs raised higher than his head; and if it is in the upper abdomen, he should have his head and chest raised higher than his lower body.
And if the incision is on one side of the abdomen, always make the side with the surgery higher than the other side; this should be used for major surgeries and moderate surgeries.
As for small surgeries, place the patient as you are able; then have a helper at your side who will hold the incision with both hands and bring its edges together, then gradually expose parts of it to the one performing the suturing.
This is the description of a single common stitch, which involves taking one or several needles according to the width of the incision, then leaving an amount equal to the thickness of the thumb at one end of the incision without threading it, and piercing a needle through both edges of the skin. along both edges of the subcutaneous tissue from inside until it exits from that side, after bringing together the edges of the skin and the subcutaneous tissue, making four layers. Then tie a doubled thread around the needle several times from both sides altogether until the edges of the incision come together tightly.
Then leave an amount equal to the thickness of a finger again and pierce another needle, then tie it with the thread as you did with the first needle. Continue doing this with however many needles are needed until the entire incision is stitched, and let the needles be of medium thickness, neither too thick nor too thin.
For the very thin needles quickly cut the flesh, and thick ones are also difficult to enter the skin. Therefore, it should be medium in thickness and thinness, and the needle should not be inserted into the edge of the skin too close together.
To prevent the flesh from separating too quickly and the wound from opening before healing, nor should it be sewn too far apart to prevent the wound from closing. Then cut the ends of the needles so they do not injure the patient while sleeping, and make bandages from pieces of linen on all sides to hold the ends of the needles.
Leave it until you know that the wound has healed. This type of suturing with needles is most appropriate for small wounds because they can often be sutured with just one or two needles or so.
As for the method of suturing for a general wound, it involves gathering all four edges, namely the two edges of the skin and the two edges of the fascia at once with a needle that has twisted but moderate thread in terms of thickness and thinness. Then, when this needle passes through these four edges, return the needle from the side where you started.
So that the thread interlocks from the top of the wound, making the suturing resemble the stitching used to tie up bundles with a small finger's width between each stitch. This type of suture is known by all people.
With this type of suture, a surgical wound on a man's abdomen was stitched. He had been injured by a knife, and the incision in the surgery was more than an inch wide. About two inches of the middle intestine had protruded from his abdomen, and the wound was located in the center of his stomach.
I left it after placing dressings outside the wound for twenty-four hours, and the wound healed in about fifteen days. I treated him until he recovered, and he lived many years afterward, able to manage all aspects of his life. The physicians had previously ruled that he would never recover at all.
And it is remarkable that I did not treat him with an ointment because I was in a place where there was nothing available from medicines. So, I used old cotton twice a day on the wound and washed it with honey water until he healed.
As for one of the two types of specialized suturing, I will mention it according to Galen's own words, which are: Begin the stitching from the skin and insert the needle from outside to inside. Once you have passed the needle through the skin and into the muscle running straight along the entire length of the abdomen.
I left the edge of the mesentery on the side from which I inserted the needle and passed it through its opposite edge from inside to outside on the other side of the mesentery. Once you have done this, pass the needle again into this same edge of the mesentery from outside to inside.
Leave the edge of the mesentery on this side and pass the needle through its opposite edge from inside to outside. As you do so, extend it into the mesentery until you completely penetrate the edge of the mesentery on that side.
Then start again from this same side, stitching along the edge of the mesentery on the opposite side. Remove the needle from the nearby skin and then reinsert it into that skin, stitching along the edge of the mesentery on the opposite side with this edge of the mesentery.
Remove it from the skin on that side, and do that again, and do it repeatedly until you suture the entire surgery in this manner. The general description of this suturing is to stitch the flesh like stitching fur.
Suture the serosa once from one side with the edge of the skin and leave it once from the other side until it is empty. As for the second type of specialized suturing mentioned by Galen, this is his exact statement.
It is that you suture it as others do in treatment by bringing each part to its counterpart, naturally joining the edge of the serosa to the other side's edge and the edge of the sinus to the other side's edge, and this will be as I describe to you.
You should pierce the edge of the sinus that is closer to you from the outside and pass it through to the inside by itself, then leave the edges of the serosa. Then withdraw the needle and pass it from the outside to the inside through both edges of the serosa, then withdraw it again.
Pass it from inside to outside on the other edge of the sinus on the opposite side. This type of suturing is better than the common and easy general suturing which was mentioned earlier. This is Galen's exact statement. Some have said that the suturing of the abdomen can be done with two needles. This is done by threading a single thread through both needles, starting by passing the needle from your side to the other side and then passing the other needle from the opposite side back to you, following the pattern of suturing the diaphragm equally.
Know that if the wound is in the middle of the abdomen, then sewing it up is more difficult than in other parts of the abdomen. As for treating the wound, its treatment is like that of other wounds; and when you encounter a fresh wound still bleeding before the air changes it, return the intestines, suture it, and secure it, then apply the prepared powder.
If the wound has been changed by the air, then apply some ointment that you have prepared until it becomes pus-filled and the stitches fall out and the serosa and membranes adhere, then treat it as you would other wounds until it heals.
If no medications are available, then from the moment it begins to form pus, use old cotton to dress it twice a day as I have taught you until it heals. In most cases, you will not need further treatment if the wounds are minor. However, if you fear that the wound may involve the major organs in pain,
you should soak soft wool in moderately heated oil or rose fat and place it around the areas between the armpit and the ribcage. If he feels pain or rot in his intestines, this often occurs; therefore, administer a cool astringent black decoction to him.
especially if the rot has reached the intestines and become a perforating wound leading to the abdominal cavity. Know that what is thick in the intestines heals more easily, whereas what is thin in them heals with greater difficulty.
As for the intestine known as the jejunum, it does not accept healing from a wound that occurs in it at all. This is due to the abundance and size of the veins within it, its thinness, and its proximity to the nature of the nerve. If what protrudes from the wound is fat and you encounter it fresh, return it as you would with the intestines, alike.
If a period has passed and it has turned green or black, it is necessary to tie it with a thread above the place where it has turned black so that bleeding does not occur, for there are veins and arteries in the ulcer. Then cut what is below the ligature.
You should attach the ends of the thread from below the surgery, outside of it, to make it easy for you to pull and remove it when the ulcer or the wound infection occurs. He mentioned the wound that occurs in the intestine, so if there is a small hole in the intestine,
it may heal in some people, for I saw a man who had been pierced in his abdomen by a spear, and the wound was on the right side of the stomach. The wound became chronic and turned into a fistula from which feces and gas were expelled. I treated him, but I did not hope for his recovery. I continued to treat him gently until he healed and the area became closed. When I saw that the area had sealed, I feared that something bad might happen inside his body, but nothing of the sort occurred, and he remained in the best condition. He was healthy, eating and drinking, engaging in intercourse, and entering the bath to serve him. Some experienced people have mentioned that if a wound appears in the intestine and is small, it should be sutured in this manner.
This involves taking large-headed ants, then bringing the edges of the wound together, and placing an ant on the edges of the wound with its mouth open. When it grasps the wound and closes its mouth, it severs its head, which adheres and does not loosen. Then place another ant near the first one.
Continue doing this with several ants according to the size of the wound, then replace it and sew up the wound. Those heads will remain attached in the intestine until the intestine heals and gets well, without causing any harm to the patient at all. The intestine can also be sutured with fine thread.
What is done to take thread from the animal glue after it has been inserted into a needle is to take one end of this thread from the glue and then take fine twisted linen thread and tie it to that end, then insert that thread into the needle. And use the glue thread to suture the intestine, then return it to the abdominal cavity. This type of suturing with ants and glue is done out of hope and expectation.
As for if the wound is large and wide, especially if it is in one of the thin intestines, there is no solution for it, and it will not heal completely.
Chapter Eighty-Six.
On the Treatment of Cold and Fissures.
Know that every wound or swelling, if it becomes chronic and delayed, turns into an ulcer that does not heal and continuously discharges pus without stopping; this is generally called a fistula in any part. We call it a cold abscess, or simply a fistula.
In reality, it is a hardened, white, painless swelling with a cavity like the hollow of a bird's feather.
That is why some call it a feather. It can be moist at times, continuously discharging pus; sometimes the moisture may temporarily cease. This moisture can vary, being abundant or scarce, thick or thin.
And in the division when mentioning the ulcers, I stated that every ulcer which does not heal and in which flesh does not grow is due to one of nine reasons. The first reason is either a lack of blood in the body or poor quality of blood, or there is hard flesh inside it and on its edges that prevents the growth of good flesh. Or it is due to excessive dirt and filth, or the ulcer itself is putrid and the substance that nourishes it is of poor quality, or the medicine used for treatment is not appropriate, or there is corruption in the town akin to an epidemic, or there is a particular condition in the town.
Or it is due to excessive dirt and filth, or the ulcer itself is putrid and the substance that nourishes it is of poor quality, or the medicine used for treatment is not appropriate, or there is corruption in the town akin to an epidemic, or there is a particular condition in the town. As was observed in the city of Saragossa, where the maturation of diseases is difficult and the healing of tumors is naturally slow. Or it may be due to a single bone or multiple bones. I have explained all these causes, their signs, and treatments with medicines in the division.
Here, I should inform you about the treatment of fistulas and nasal conditions that are treated by manual methods. Know that fistulas can occur in all parts of the body; some lead to major veins or arteries, or to nerves.
or to a sac, or to an intestine, or to a bladder, or to one of the ribs, or to a vertebra of the spine, or to a complex joint such as that of the hand or foot, and there are those that lead close to a major organ and similar cases.
Those fistulas that have this characteristic are among the difficult-to-heal diseases that do not accept treatment and dealing with them is in vain and out of ignorance. If there are fistulas that do not reach these places mentioned and you hope for their treatment, then:
And if you want to find out about that, take a probe of copper or iron; if the fistula runs straight, examine it with it. But if there is a bend in the fistula, examine it with a probe of thin lead, for lead will conform to its shape.
It will flow smoothly upon entry and turn towards the bend. If the fistula has many mouths that you cannot detect with a probe, then inject one of its openings with moisture; the moisture injected will travel toward the other mouths and flow out.
Then thoroughly investigate in any way possible to know if there is a bone or nerve, or if the fistula's bottom is far or near, or if it is one fistula with many mouths. Determine all this to the best of your ability through careful examination and the presence of pain when you press on the area.
And similarly, consider the signs and causes that lead to the tumor. Once you have a clear understanding of all these factors, then proceed with confidence to treatment by examining whether it is.
If the fistula is visible and close, or in a safe place far from a joint, nerve, artery, vein, or any of the locations mentioned to you, then incise the fistula as described and remove what is inside, including clotted material, rotten flesh, and excess tissue.
And whatever grows in its mouth of flesh or polypus and the like, treat it until he is cured. If the fistula's bottom is deep and runs straight, then incise it as deeply as possible and clean out all the rotten tissue.
Then use the soaked lint in sharp medicines and insert it into the bottom of the fistula that you can reach with iron; do this repeatedly until the sharp medicine consumes all the remaining corruption at the bottom of the fistula.
Then apply ointments that promote the growth of healthy flesh until he is healed. If he does not heal by this, treat him as previously described. If the cause of the fistula is a bone and you are certain about it, then explore and incise it as I have informed you, unless something prevents you from doing so.
If it involves a nerve, vein, or principal organ as we said, and if the bone is exposed to you and there is some corruption and blackening in it, then strip it until the corruption is gone, then treat it with what will heal it until he is cured. If he does not heal and the pus continues as it was doing.
Know that you have not reached complete removal of the corruption. Examine it thoroughly again and strip and purify it with all your effort, then treat it. If he heals, otherwise know that this corruption is in a deep recess of decay. Examine everything about it again.
Thoroughly strip and purify it with your greatest effort. If the corrupted bone is a small bone and you can remove it, pull it out with fine forceps suitable for that purpose.
If there are many bones, remove them all thoroughly and do not leave any of them with your effort. If ligaments or muscles obstruct you and cutting them does not pose a risk, then cut those ligaments and muscles if they are present and free the bones.
If it is not possible for you to remove the bones at your convenience, then apply something to the wound that will cause putrefaction and leave it for several days until the flesh and tendons around those bones become putrid. Preserve the wound so that the incision you made does not heal together during this work.
Rather, if you fear this, place a piece of cotton soaked in powdered sulfur with oil or a piece of cotton soaked in Egyptian ointment or one of the green ointments on it. When these tendons become putrid and the bones decay, it will be easy to extract them and pull them out.
If it is a single large bone like the bone of the leg or thigh, and only its surface has become corrupted, then thoroughly scrape away that blackened and decayed part until it is clean, then suture the wound. However, if a significant portion has rotted and the corruption has reached the bone marrow, then it is necessary to excise it.
Cut it entirely where the corruption ends; then treat it until it heals. I will tell you about a condition that occurred in a young man's leg to serve as an example and aid in your treatment. This young man was of tender age.
Around thirty years old, he experienced pain in his leg due to movement from inside the body, causing materials to connect to the leg and a large swelling to form; there was no external cause. Over time, with errors by physicians, the swelling eventually burst open.
A great deal of material flowed from it, and he was poorly treated until the leg became ulcerated with many openings that all discharged pus and bodily fluids. He was treated by a group of physicians for about two years, but none of them were skilled in surgical techniques.
Until he came to me, and I saw his leg, with substances flowing from those mouths in a great stream, and the man had emaciated and his complexion turned yellow. Then I inserted the probe into one of those mouths, and the probe reached the bone, then I examined all the mouths.
I found them connected to each other from all sides of the leg, so I decided to incise one of those mouths until I exposed part of the bone. I found it rotten, having decayed and turned black, and perforated until the hole reached the brain. Then I excised what was exposed to me.
I removed the diseased bone, and I thought that there was no other corruption in the bone besides what I had excised. I believed that I had completely eradicated it. Then I treated the wound with healing medicines for a longer period, but it did not heal. So I returned to examine the bone again above the previous exposure.
I found the corruption connected to the bone, so I excised what appeared to me of that corruption as well. I tried to heal it, but it did not heal or close. Then I reopened it again. I continued to cut away parts of the bone and attempted to heal it, but it would not heal until I had removed about an inch of the bone.
I removed part of his brain and then healed it with medicines, which quickly adhered and he recovered. This repetition in his treatment and reopening was necessary due to the patient's weakness, inability to tolerate further intervention, and my fear for his life, as severe fainting spells would occur at any time from excessive vomiting. He fully recovered.
Flesh hardened in the place of the bone and its condition improved in his body, its strength receded, and it adjusted to his circumstances without any affliction during walking that would harm it at all. If a protruding bone in some part of the body has broken.
You should spread it in this manner: Take a bandage and secure it to the protruding bone, then have someone pull it upwards. Take another bandage made of coarser wool than the first one.
Then secure it to the flesh below the bone and pull its end so that the flesh is drawn downward. You should expose the area you wish to spread to prevent the saw from injuring the flesh, and place a piece of wood or a board under the bone from below firmly.
Because if you do that, the saw will not be prevented from cutting through the diseased bone. It is advisable to make the cut slightly above the area of decay so that there is no corruption inside the bone cavity, which would not be apparent on the surface and thus require a second cutting.
If the bone is diseased but not protruding, and its parts are connected to each other with the decay in the middle or in part of it, then expose the flesh from all sides. Place a piece of wood underneath, then cut from the first side where the corruption is located.
When you finish cutting from one side, cut from the other side as well. The cutting should be slightly away from the decay as we mentioned. If the corruption is in a joint, remove the diseased part of the joint and then cut the bone where it connects from the other side.
If the corruption is in the connection of two joints, there is no remedy other than excision. If the corruption is in the wrist of the hand or foot, its treatment is very difficult; however, you should peel off the corruption as it appears to you and excise and cleanse it as much as possible.
And by what means can you proceed when an artery or nerve does not obstruct you? Know that there are many saws and cutting instruments for breaking these bones, according to the position of the bones, their height, thickness, thinness, size, smallness, hardness, and brittleness. Therefore, it is necessary to prepare an instrument suitable for each type of work.
And know that the tasks themselves may guide you to the type of instrument you need if you have long experience and knowledge of the arts of this craft, for skill in the profession and familiarity with various diseases will show you the way. He may deduce for himself instruments suitable for each disease, and I will depict for you various instruments at the end of this section.
Make them examples to follow and standards to measure others by, if God wills. Image of a saw:

Chapter Seventy-Eight.
On Cutting Limbs and Spreading Bones.
The limbs may become gangrenous either due to an external cause or an internal one. If you treat this corruption with medicine and the treatment is ineffective, and you see that the corruption is spreading in the limb and nothing can stop it.
Then you should amputate that limb up to where the corruption has spread, so that the patient may be saved from death or from a greater affliction than losing the limb. A sign that this situation has occurred is that the limb turns black as if it were burned by fire.
Or it putrefies after blackening until that putrefaction spreads to the adjacent part and then affects the whole body, so cut it off promptly. Similarly, if the cause of corruption is due to the bite of some creatures such as a sea scorpion or snake or centipede or the like.
If the corruption or bite is in the tip of a finger, cut off the finger and do not wait for the corruption to spread to the hand. Similarly, if it spreads to the hand, cut it off at the wrist joint and do not wait for the corruption to spread further up to the elbow.
Similarly, if it spreads to the arm, cut off the arm at the elbow joint itself. If corruption is permissible and you see it spreading towards the shoulder, do not cut off the shoulder by any means as this may lead to the death of the patient; instead, use other treatments to the best of your ability.
Similarly, do the same for the leg if corruption begins in a toe, cut off the toe at one of the phalanges. If it spreads to the foot, amputate the entire foot. If it ascends to the knee, cut off the leg at the knee joint.
If the corruption has reached above the knee, there is no recourse but to leave it and submit the patient to their fate of death. The method of amputating a limb or spreading infection involves tying a ligature below the point where you intend to cut and another one above that point.
Tie one attendant to the lower ligature and another to the upper ligature. Using a broad scalpel, expose all the flesh between the two ligatures until it is completely revealed, then proceed with cutting or spreading. It is advisable to place pieces of linen cloth around all sides.
To avoid the saw reaching the correct position, causing excessive pain and hot swelling for the patient, if bleeding occurs during your work, quickly apply pressure to the area or use some astringent agents to stop the bleeding, then return to your treatment until you are finished.
Then bind the injured limb with a suitable bandage and treat it until it heals. I will tell you about an example of a man who had this exact condition in his leg, where there was discoloration and burning pain resembling fire.
This corruption first began in his toe and then spread to the entire limb. When the man saw the condition worsening and felt severe pain and burning, he decided to amputate at the joint and subsequently healed.
After a long time, the same corruption appeared in his thumb. He came to me, and I applied various medicines to the hand after cleaning his body, but the condition did not improve and began spreading to another finger.
The corruption spread to his entire hand. He then asked me to amputate it, but I refused, hoping to cure the condition and also because I feared he might die from the amputation due to his weak constitution. When he lost hope in my treatment, he returned to his home.
I heard that he decided to amputate his entire hand and he recovered. I have recounted this story to help in dealing with similar diseases, as an example to follow.
Chapter Eighty-Eight.
On the treatment of abscesses and how to inject them with medicines.
If a swelling occurs in some fleshy organs and the duration of the swelling is such that it gathers pus, and then bursts or discharges all that was inside, leaving the place empty as if it were a vessel.
And the skin on which it occurs is like a piece of cloth that has thinned but has not decayed to the point of affecting the bone, nerve, or ligament; and from this it deserves to be called an abscess rather than a fistula unless its duration leads the decay to affect any of these parts.
Then it is called a fistula or a sinus, and its treatment is to cut away that skin entirely as it surrounds, especially if it has thinned and become like a piece of cloth, and you are certain that it will not adhere to the place due to its decay.
If you hope that the skin will adhere and it has not decayed to that extent, but there is a thickness of flesh in the skin, treat it with injection. This involves examining the abscess; if it is large and the pus emitted from it has an offensive smell, inject it with Egyptian medicine.
It is vinegar, oil, honey, and resin in equal parts mixed in a vessel and cooked over fire until the medicine thickens to the consistency of honey. Then take what you need from it, dilute it with water and honey, and inject it into the abscess. Secure its opening and leave the medicine inside for about two hours.
Then remove it by squeezing; do this for days until the abscess is cleansed and the foul smell goes away. It may also be injected with lye water if you do not have this medicine, which involves taking the ashes of vine wood or oak wood and pouring water over them.
Then straighten him and inject until you are certain that the cavity has been cleansed. If the patient cannot tolerate Egyptian medicine or ash water, then inject with water mixed with honey and a little of crushed cubebs.
Or inject with honey and a decoction mixed together, for honey cleanses and washes, and the decoction adheres to the cavity, especially if the decoction has a binding and drying effect. Once you have done this repeatedly and are certain that the corruption of the cavity has been removed, then inject something that promotes flesh growth.
For example, take some soft bread ointment and dissolve it in rose oil and a binding decoction. Or inject with some other drugs or ointments whose properties we have described in the chapter on ointments. If the opening of the cavity is narrow and does not accommodate the tube of the syringe,
then widen it with iron slightly, or place a thread dipped in Egyptian ointment or sparrow ointment inside until it becomes wider. Similarly, if the opening is also wide, sew together its edges so that there is enough space for the syringe to enter without excess.
And if the opening from which pus flows is elevated upwards, make an incision at its lowest point so that the pus can flow downwards. This is because if pus accumulates in the depths of the cavity, it prevents flesh from growing there.
If you cannot make an incision towards the lower part of the cavity as desired, then position the organ in a way that allows pus to flow out easily according to what seems best to you. Also ensure that no pus is retained within it at all.
As for the ointments that are applied externally to the wound and how they should be placed is that you take one of the suitable unguents and apply it to a piece of linen, and let the bandage be large enough to cover the entire wound. Then cut with scissors a hole over the mouth of the wound, wider than the mouth of the wound slightly. Then apply the soft ointment on another piece of cloth according to the size of the hole and place it on top of it away from the mouth of the wound so that pus can easily come out, and do not remove the large bandage until instructed otherwise.
For several days, and as for the one over the mouth of the wound, it should be removed at every time to allow the pus that has accumulated to come out and to know what flows from it of pus whether it is much or little or mature or not mature.
And with this, also examine the site of the wound itself to see if the patient feels pain there or not, and whether there is swelling or not. If you proceed with treatment like this and notice that the matter coming out from the mouth of the wound is minimal,
know that the wound has adhered or is about to adhere. At that time, remove it tomorrow or on the third day. When you remove the dressing, replace it with a new one and renew the ointment. If thin pus comes out of the wound after a long period of time, do not lose hope that it may still adhere.
He will recover soon because there are people whose flesh grows slowly in their wounds, and others for whom it is the opposite. If after many days pus that is not mature comes out from the wound, then know that the wound has not adhered. If the adherence of the wound is delayed,
And if the condition persists, increase the drying of the medicines; let them be such that they are moist in consistency but dry in strength, like the palm plaster when more of the quargh (a type of medicinal ingredient) has been added to it. And among the most effective treatments is to use the palm plaster.
It is treated with rose oil, and then the old well-balanced drink is sprinkled on it, after which it is kneaded and used. If the palm plaster is not available to you, you can boil honey until it thickens and use it, or take myrrh, liquorice, and spikenard, grind them all together, and sprinkle them on the honey while it is on the fire. Then apply it to a piece of cloth and bind it to the affected area, or apply it with the honey you have boiled until thickened, sprinkle the medicines on it, place the cloth on it, and secure it.
It may also be used in such cases with long turpentine, the root of asphodel, flour of barley, and colocynth separately or together, grind them, sieve them, sprinkle them on the honey described, and use it. If the condition persists at the affected area without healing through this treatment, know that there is a deeper corruption within.
If it has affected the bones or any other hard nerves or ligaments, treat it as you would a nasal abscess, as previously described.
Chapter Eighty-Nine.
On the Treatment of Ingrown Toenails, Bruised Nails, Removal of Supernumerary Fingers, and Separation of Joined Fingers.
Al-Dahis is a large growth of flesh that grows under the thumbnail of the big toe or hand, and it may also grow on other fingers. If it is neglected and left untreated for a long time, it becomes a hot swelling.
Or it may rot and become putrid until it eats away the nail's root, and it may corrupt the entire thing, and sometimes the corruption reaches the bone, giving off a foul odor, making the finger tip thickened and its color like pitch. If you treat it as we mentioned in the division and your treatment does not succeed.
It is necessary to cut with iron all the excess that grows from the nail, then cauterize the wound afterward, as cauterization is very beneficial in this case. However, if the bone is healthy and the nail is also healthy.
And if the corner of the nail has folded the flesh inward, causing irritation and injury, it is necessary to place a thin padding under the nail's corner that irritates the flesh and raise it up, then carefully cut away that flesh.
Apply burning and consuming medicines to the remaining flesh until it is all gone, then treat it with ointments until it heals. However, if the corruption has affected the bone, it is necessary to cut out that bone and remove it, for it will not heal as long as there is a corrupted bone in it at all.
If you see the corruption and decay spreading in the finger, then cut it at one of the joints as previously mentioned, then treat it until it heals. If the nail is struck or injured and severe pain occurs, it is necessary to first let blood from the patient.
Then you should cut the nail with a sharp knife in an oblique incision from top to bottom, and be careful not to reach the flesh beneath the nail, for that would cause severe pain to the patient and could lead to excessive tissue growth in the area. Then treat the area with something to relieve pain.
As for the extra finger that sometimes develops in some people, it may be entirely fleshy, or it may have bone in part of it, and it may even have a nail. It often grows at the base of one of the finger joints.
Or it may grow on one of the phalanges, and those that grow on a phalanx do not move, whereas those that grow at the finger joint sometimes do move. Cutting fleshy growths is easier; you should cut them at their base with a broad knife.
As for those that grow at the base of the joint, their treatment is difficult, so you should avoid cutting them. As for those that grow on a phalanx, you should first cut around the flesh to the bone in a circular manner, then use one of those appropriate saws to remove the bone.
Then treat it until it heals. As for the webbing that occurs between fingers, this often happens and can be something with which a person is born, or it may occur after a wound has healed or from burns or similar causes. It should be split open.
Until the fingers return to their natural shape, then place a piece of cloth or a suture soaked in rose oil between them so that they do not reattach too quickly. Keep them apart or place a thin sheet of lead between them until the area heals properly.
And if the fusion of some fingers on the hand occurs, then that fusion should be cut according to what appears suitable and beneficial for the shape of the limb.
Chapter Ninety.
On the Cutting of Syndactyly.
Syndactyly are tortuous, thick veins filled with excessive black bile and occur most frequently in various parts of the body, particularly in the legs, especially in the shins, ankles, and thighs. Initially, it is necessary to use strong dry cupping several times to remove black bile from the body.
Then bleed the patient with a basilisk (a type of bloodletting instrument). As for treatment with iron, it is done in two ways: one involves cutting and removing black blood, while the other involves extracting the vein completely. For the former method, initially warm the leg with hot water mixed with some herbs.
Until the thick, turbid blood becomes liquefied, then bind the patient's leg from above the thigh to just below the knee with a turban. Then make one wide incision or two or three in specific locations along the vein.
Then extract the black blood with your hand from the bottom of the leg to the top and then from the top to the bottom until you release what you consider sufficient or what the patient's strength can tolerate. Then bind the area and instruct the patient to avoid foods that produce black bile. Repeat the purging and bleeding as needed.
When the veins are full and this harms the patient, extracting it should be done as follows: If there is a lot of hair on the patient's leg, shave it off. Then take the patient to the bathhouse and warm his leg with hot water until it turns red and starts sweating, or have him exercise vigorously.
If a bath is not available to warm the member, then make an incision along the vein either at its end near the knee or at its lower part near the heel. Then open the skin with forceps and strip the vein from all sides until it becomes apparent to the touch.
When it appears, you will see it as a bright red vein. Once it is freed from the skin, it will also appear like a tendon. Then insert your finger underneath it and lift it up until it protrudes beyond the skin. Attach it with a smooth blunt needle, then make another incision nearby, about three fingers' width away.
Then strip the skin from around the vein until it is visible, then lift it with your finger as you did before and attach it with another smooth blunt needle as you did initially. Then make another incision or several more if necessary.
Then pull it out and cut it at the end of the incision near the heel. Then pull it through until it comes out of the second incision, then pull it to the incision above it. Repeat this process until you pull it out from the highest incision among all. Once it is completely pulled out, then cut it.
If it does not respond to pulling, then insert a strong threaded needle and tie it. Pull on the thread and insert your finger under it, twisting your hand in all directions until it comes out, being careful that it does not break. If it breaks, it will be very difficult for you to pull it out.
It may cause harm to the patient if not done carefully. Once you have pulled it out completely, place wool soaked in syrup and rose oil or oil on the sites of the incisions, and treat them until they heal. If the vein is contracted with wrinkles and twists in various directions,
And it was not in a straight position, as we said, so you should cut along every part of its twists and bends, then hang it on the hooks until you stretch it entirely. Be careful when cutting along it not to cut or injure the vein, for it will be difficult for you to stretch it if you do; therefore, be cautious with your effort.
An image of the tool used to cut the hernia:
Image of the blind hook:
It should not have a bend like other hooks, nor should its end be sharp so as not to injure the vein. It should be thick and smooth because if it is thin, it will cut the vein due to its thinness. Rather, it should have an appropriate thickness as we mentioned.
Chapter Ninety-One.
On Stretching the Sigmoid Vein.
This vein develops in the legs in hot countries like Hijaz and the lands of Arabia, and in hot, arid, fertile regions. It may also develop in other parts of the body besides the legs due to a kind of corruption that occurs beneath the skin.
It also occurs inside living creatures as snakes, worms, and gourd-like swellings, as well as worms that develop between the skin and flesh. The sign of the beginning of this vein's appearance is a severe inflammation in the leg, then the area becomes swollen, and then the vein begins to emerge from that swollen spot.
It appears as if it were the root of a plant or animal. When one end of it becomes visible, it should be wrapped around a small piece of lead weighing from a quarter to half a dirham, then secured, leaving the lead hanging from the leg.
Whenever something comes out to the outside, wrap it in lead and secure it. If it is very long, cut some of it and wrap the rest; do not cut it from its root before it all comes out, for if you cut it, it will contract and enter the flesh, causing a tumor, corruption in the place, and a bad ulcer.
Therefore, it should be managed and extracted little by little until it is completely out and nothing remains in the body. In some people, what comes out from this vein can be as long as five fingers and ten.
I have heard that it reached twenty spans in length for a man. If it breaks during your treatment, insert a probe into its opening and pack it tightly with a plug along the body until everything inside is evacuated, and try to cleanse the area with medications for several days.
Then treat it as you would treat tumors. This vein may have many branches, especially if it appears in a joint of the leg or in the leg itself, causing many openings from which branches emerge. Treat them as previously described in the division and treatment methods.
Chapter Ninety-Two.
On Incising the Worms Generated Under the Hide and Called "Bovine Affliction.
This disease is called "Bovine Affliction" in some of our countries because it often occurs in cattle. It is a small worm that develops between the skin and flesh and spreads throughout the body, moving up and down.
Its presence is noticeable to the senses as it moves from one part of the body to another until it breaks through the skin where it emerges. It forms due to the corruption of some substances within the body, similar to how worms and snakes form, or like the seeds of pumpkins in the abdomen.
And it is expected that her harm will be such that if she enters the body and rises to the head and reaches the eye, then perhaps she will open in it and come out, thus ruining the eye, and this happens often. If you wish to treat her and remove her, then that should be done when she moves within the body and becomes apparent to the senses.
It is necessary to tie what is above and below it tightly with a ligature, then cut over it and remove her. If she sinks into the flesh and you cannot find her, then apply cautery to the area with fire until you burn her. The greatest harm that can come from her ruining the eye is as we have said.
If you see that she has become near the eye in the head, then tie below it on the forehead tightly, then cut over it and remove her. It is necessary to treat the patient by purifying his body with medicines that ease the putrid and bad temperaments and be cautious of foods that produce putrefaction.
Chapter Thirty-Nine.
On Incising the Disease Known as Nafir.
This disease, which is called nafir in our country, is a pain that appears in some organs and then moves from one organ to another. I have seen it as I will describe to you.
I was called to see a sick woman in one of the villages. When I uncovered her arm, I saw a slight swelling in the tendon of the biceps. After waiting for a short while, I observed that this swelling moved along with the tendon toward the elbow, as if it were crawling like a worm, ascending quickly to her shoulder as fast as mercury could flow.
If it flows from one place to another, the pain leaves that place and remains in the shoulder, then after sitting for a while it runs through the entire body until it reaches the other arm, then she told me that her whole body moves as she has witnessed.
I was amazed at the speed with which it moved from one member to another, and I had not before seen this disease in such a manner, although I have seen many people experience pain moving from one part of the body to another. I have never witnessed it as clearly as I did in this woman.
I did not consider this to be possible except because the woman was from the countryside, with a dry body and visible veins, hence it appeared to the senses as moving air. It must not appear in this way on those who lead a life of ease, with moist bodies and hidden veins.
If you wish to treat it and the patient feels pain, then if it appears as we have described, bind it tightly above and below with speed and incise it until that congested air is released and clean the area.
If you do not see it with your own eyes, treat it by stimulating the body and using remedies that expel air and relieve gas, such as rotten seeds and senna, and similar medicines.
Chapter Forty-Nine.
On the Removal of Arrows.
Arrows may differ according to their types and according to the places where they penetrate in the body. As for their difference according to their types, there are large and small ones, hollow glass arrows and solid glass arrows, as well as those with three corners and four corners.
And some of them have tongues, and some have fragments. As for those that occur according to the organs in which they are located, they are of two kinds: either the organs are principal hollow organs such as the brain, heart, liver, lung, kidneys, intestines, bladder, and similar ones. When an arrow strikes one of these organs and signs of death, which I will describe to you later, become apparent, it is advisable to avoid extracting that arrow, for in most cases, death will befall the victim. And when these bad signs do not appear and the arrow has not penetrated deep into the organ, remove it and treat the wound. Among the signs of the brain if an arrow strikes it, pierces the bone, and injures the membrane covering the brain are severe headache, nausea, and dizziness.
And when these bad signs do not appear and the arrow has not penetrated deep into the organ, remove it and treat the wound. Among the signs of the brain if an arrow strikes it, pierces the bone, and injures the membrane covering the brain are severe headache, nausea, and dizziness. Redness in the eyes, redness of the tongue, spasms, confusion, vomiting, and it may occur that blood comes out of the nostrils or ears. Speech may be interrupted, voice lost, and from the wound site a white moisture similar to porridge may come out, along with a watery discharge like raw flesh.
If these signs appear, refrain from treating the patient and extracting the arrow if it has not already come out. As for the signs of an arrow when it strikes the heart and is near the left breast and feels as though it has embedded in something solid rather than empty.
It may also exhibit movement similar to the pulse, and blood from the wound may be black, followed by coldness in the limbs, cold sweat, and fainting. Know that death is inevitable. A sign of an arrow when it wounds the lung is the discharge of frothy blood from the wound.
The vessels near the neck become swollen, the patient's color changes, and he breathes heavily; he seeks to inhale cold air. If the arrow affects the membrane in the chest, it is close to the small ribs, and breathing becomes very difficult with severe pain.
He sighs and moves all the muscles of his shoulders. If the arrow hits the liver, it is followed by severe pain, and blood similar in redness to the liver comes out of the wound. If the arrow hits the stomach, something undigested from food may come out of the wound.
The situation is clear. If the arrow penetrates the abdomen and something comes out of the wound, whether it be feces, pus, or a perforated intestine, there is no hope for treatment or removing the arrow. If the arrow strikes the bladder and urine comes out.
And if something protrudes from the wound and the pain becomes severe for the patient, know that he is doomed. As for other parts of the body such as the face, eyes, throat, shoulder, upper arm, spine, elbow, thigh, leg, and similar organs, they generally fare better under most circumstances.
If the arrow does not hit an artery or nerve and is not poisoned, I will inform you about some of what I have witnessed concerning these arrows so that you may use it to guide your treatment. One such case was when an arrow struck a man in the bridge of his nose at its base.
I removed it for him from the other side, below the ear flap, and he recovered without any harm coming to his eye. I also removed an arrow for a Jew who had been struck in the eyelid, below the lower eyelash; the arrow had sunk in, and all I could grasp was its small tip that was sticking out of the wood.
It was a large composite arrow of smooth square iron, without ears. The Jew recovered and no harm came to his eye. Another arrow was removed from the throat of a Christian, and this arrow was Arabian.
It was one that had ears. I split it for him between the jugular veins as it had embedded in his throat, and I handled it gently until I removed it. The Christian was safe and healed. I also removed another arrow from a man who had been struck by it in his abdomen, and we estimated that he would die from it.
After thirty days or so had passed and there was no change in his condition, I split the area around the arrow and devised ways to remove it, and he healed without any harm befalling him. I also saw a man struck by an arrow in his back, and the wound became enclosed around the arrow.
After seven years, the arrow emerged at the root of his thigh. I also saw a woman who had an arrow embedded in her abdomen; the wound had healed around it, and the arrow remained without any change in her condition, nor did she feel any harm from it regarding her natural functions.
I also saw another man who had an arrow strike his face, and the wound healed around it, leaving him with little pain. There are many similar cases. I removed an arrow from a military officer who had been struck by it in the middle of his nose, which was slightly inclined to the right side.
The arrow had completely penetrated. I was called to treat him three days after the incident, and I found that the wound from the arrow was very narrow. I examined it with a thin probe but could not feel the arrow. He felt a sharp pain and discomfort under his right ear due to the wound.
I hoped that the wound was from the tip of an arrow and dressed the area with a bandage that had pulling power, hoping that it would swell and reveal the mark of the arrow. I then incised it but nothing happened to indicate that the arrow had reached the site.
I continued to dress it for many days, but nothing happened. The patient then sealed the wound himself and became resigned to not removing the arrow for a period of time. One day, he felt the arrow inside his nose and informed me. I applied a sharp and corrosive medicine to the wound for many days.
Until it opened and I probed it, feeling the thin tip of the arrow that sticks to the wood. Then I increased the opening of the wound with that sharp medicine until the tip of the arrow became visible to us. It took me about four months for this to happen.
When the wound widened and I was able to insert forceps into it, I pulled on it and moved it but it did not respond to coming out. So I continued to handle it gently and devised various tools until one day I grasped it with forceps firmly, as shown in the illustration at the end of this chapter.
The doctors had ruled that his nasal cartilage could not be repaired, but I repaired it anyway. The wound healed and the patient recovered completely without any harm at all. I am telling you about extracting some arrows so that you may use this as a model and reference for what has not been mentioned.
For the parts of this craft and its details cannot be grasped by description, nor can a book encompass them all; rather, the skilled craftsman measures the little against the much and what is present against what is absent, and he infers new work and new tools in strange emergencies.
If you ask about this craft, I say that arrows are removed from the parts in which they are embedded in two ways: either by pulling them out from the place where they entered, or from the opposite side, and those that come out from where they entered.
Either the arrow is protruding in a fleshy area and can be pulled out. If it does not come out easily at the time of entry, you should leave it for days until the flesh around it rots, making it easier to pull out. The same applies if it embeds in bone.
If it does not come out easily, leave it for days and try to pull and move it every day; it will eventually come out. If it still does not come out after days, you should drill around the arrow in the bone from all sides with a small drill until there is enough space for the arrow, then pull it out.
If the embedded arrow is in the bone of the head and has penetrated one of the cavities of the brain, and some of those symptoms you were mentioned have appeared in the patient, then refrain from pulling out the arrow and leave it until the condition becomes clearer after days.
Deal with the extraction of an arrow and its removal. If it is deeply embedded and does not yield to pulling, use drills around the arrow as I have described to you, then treat the area until it heals. As for when the arrow has become hidden in a part of the body. And if it escapes the senses, probe for it with a probe; if you detect it, pull it out with one of the instruments suitable for this task. If you cannot do so due to the narrowness of the wound and the depth at which the arrow is embedded, and there is no bone, nerve, or vessel in the vicinity.
Make an incision on it until the wound widens and you can access the arrow to remove it. If it has two wings, detach the flesh embedded in them from all sides by any means possible; if you cannot free the flesh, break off the wings and pull them apart until they are separated.
And when you attempt to remove an arrow from any part, use your fingers with pincers in all directions until you free it; handle it with the utmost care so that the arrow does not break, making it difficult for you to pull and extract it. If you are unable to do so within your available time.
Leave it for days until the flesh around it begins to decay, then return to it, as it will be easier at that time. If bleeding occurs, apply the treatments mentioned in its section; be cautious not to cut a vessel, nerve, or tendon, and use ingenuity.
Use any means you can to free the arrow, doing so with care, patience, and steadiness as described to you. It is advisable that when pulling out the arrow, you position the patient as they were when the arrow struck them, which is more appropriate.
If you cannot do that, use what is available to you among the shapes. As for the arrow that comes out from the opposite side, either something has protruded from it outwardly, or you will find the tip of the arrow by touch near the top of the skin and see it protruding.
Make an incision for it, and let the incision be as large as what can accommodate the forceps. Then pull it out, as it will come out easily. If it sticks to a bone, twist your hand in a circular motion until the arrow affects the bone and widens its own space, then pull it out.
Otherwise, leave it for days and then try again until it comes out. If the arrow shaft is still in place, push it with something appropriate. If the shaft has fallen off and you want to use a pushing method, insert a hollow instrument so that its cavity fits into the base of the arrow, then push it with that instrument.
If the arrow is hollow, push it with an instrument that fits into its cavity; this will make it easier for the arrow to come out. If the arrow is poisoned, you should excise all the flesh that has been affected by the poison if possible, then treat it appropriately.
If the arrow is in the chest, abdomen, bladder, or flank and is close to what can be probed with a probe, and if you can make an incision for it, do so while being careful not to cut a vein or nerve, then remove it.
Then outline the wound if it needs stitching, and treat it until it heals. Image of the forceps used to extract arrows:
Its ends are like a bird's beak, and when made, they act like pliers; if they grasp an arrow or anything else, they do not let go. They can also be made in various sizes: large, small, and medium-sized, all according to the size of the arrow and the width of the wound.
Image of the hollow cannon:
Image of the solid muzzleloader:
This is smooth at the tip like a rod to easily enter the hollow arrow and push it.
Chapter Fifty-Nine.
On the Incision of Veins.
There are thirty veins in the body that are commonly incised, sixteen of which are in the head: the two pulsating veins behind the ears known as the temporal veins, the two veins visible in the temples, and the two veins at the corners of the eyes known as the lacrimal veins.
The upright vein in the center of the forehead, the vein at the tip of the nose, the two veins on the neck known as the jugular veins, the two veins in the upper lip, the two veins in the lower lip known as the philtrum veins, and the two veins under the tongue.
As for the veins that are incised in the arm and hand, there are five veins. One is called the cephalic vein, which is on the lateral side, and it is known to the general public as the head vein. The median cubital vein, which is the middle vein, composed of a branch from the basilic vein and a branch from the cephalic vein, and it is known to the general public as the body vein.
The basaliq, which is located on the inner side and is also called the axillary vein; it is commonly known as the abdominal vein or the arm cord. The zand cord, which adheres to it, and it appears prominently above the thumb; the assilm.
It is the vein between the little finger and the ring finger, which has two branches. In the leg and foot, there are three veins: one beneath the knee's inner side, another called the safin at the heel's inner side, and the third is the nasah vein located on the outer side of the heel.
In the other leg, there are also three veins like it. As for the two veins behind the ears, they are beneficial to cut for chronic catarrhs, migraines, shingles, and chronic poor-quality head ulcers, and the method of cutting them is as I describe.
It involves shaving the patient's head and vigorously rubbing the area behind the ears where the veins are located with a rough cloth. Then, the patient's neck is tightly wrapped with a turban to make the veins appear. The veins are located in the lower areas behind both ears on the head. You then feel them with your finger, and when you sense their pulse beneath your fingertip, that is where you mark them with ink.
Then take a surgical knife, known as nashl, and insert it under the vein through the skin until the knife reaches the bone. Then lift your hand with the vein and skin upwards and cut the vein along with the skin in one clean cut. The length of the cut should be about two clenched fingers.
Or something similar, and let out the amount of blood you desire, then secure them with bandages until they heal. It was previously mentioned at the beginning of the book how to cut and cauterize them. As for the two arteries in the temples, cutting them is beneficial for chronic migraines, severe headaches, persistent eye inflammation, and acute purulent discharges flowing to the eyes.
And how to expose them as I describe to you: The patient should pull his neck with a turban so that the veins become clearly visible, and their pulsation can be felt under your fingers. Then mark them with ink, then lift the skin above the vein from its base upwards with your index finger.
Insert the sharp scalpel from below, lift the vein upwards, and cut it as you did with the other two veins. Let out as much blood as needed, then release the patient's constriction, and place your finger on the vein for a moment.
Then place a cotton pad and bandage on it, tie it tightly from above, and leave it until he recovers. I have previously mentioned its description, cutting, and letting in the earlier part of the book. As for bleeding the forehead vein, its benefit comes after bleeding the occipital vein for chronic facial ailments such as shafafa (a kind of skin disease), ulcers, and persistent redness.
And how to bleed it as I describe to you: The patient should pull his neck with a turban so that the vein becomes visible, then take the instrument called the axe; this is its appearance:
Place the prong at the head of the axe on the same vein and strike from above with a comb or something similar. Let the blood flow to the desired amount, then release the patient's constriction and secure it until he recovers.
It can also be opened with a wide scalpel, except that the scalpel should not have a sharp tip like other scalpels but rather a slightly broad tip. Bleed it by tilting because the bone is close, and the scalpel might break if it were thin.
As for the two veins located at the corners of the eyes, their benefit is for eye ailments such as scabies, redness, ulcers, and facial diseases. As for how to ligate them, it is that the patient should tie his neck with a turban, then you should ligate them while standing behind his head; let the ligation be slightly oblique toward the length using a small but somewhat wide blade.
If the area has no flesh, then the blade may break if its tip is thin. Then let the blood flow as much as you need and place a piece of cotton on them and bandage them for one night and then release them. As for ligating the vein of the nose, it is beneficial for severe fever.
Severe headache and facial diseases such as the chronic red swelling that appears in the nose, especially if it is chronic. The method of ligation is to have the patient tie his neck, then hold his nose with your left hand, and take a thin, long blade.
Insert it in the middle of the nasal septum itself, between the partitions of the nose, straight ahead because the vein does not appear to the touch there; blood will immediately flow. You should press slightly with the blade and let out as much blood as needed, then bind it for one night because it heals quickly.
As for the two veins called "udajan," their ligation is beneficial for shortness of breath, the onset of leprosy, and pigmented skin diseases that appear on the surface of the skin such as black vitiligo, psoriasis, poor ulcers, and tumors. The method of ligating them is to tie the patient under them at his neck with a strap, and the surgeon should stand behind the patient's head.
The patient sits on a chair, then let the blood flow from the vein widely but slightly, then take an adequate amount of blood or according to what you see as necessary, then do the same for the other vein, then loosen the tourniquet.
Tie the veins moderately so that the patient does not suffocate, and leave it until tomorrow, for then the wound will heal. As for the veins of the cheeks, benefit from letting them bleed after bleeding the temporal vein, as it benefits from mouth ulcers, gum disease, poor-quality sores, clefts in the lips, and poor-quality ulcers.
Those that are in the nose and around it, and the way to let them bleed is to have the patient sit in front of you and tie his neck with a turban, then pull his lips apart and look at the two veins, one on the right side of the lip and the other on the left, and distinguish them by their darkness.
This is also because around them are thin black veins, so cut them off completely. If you are unsure and do not know which ones they are, aim to cut the larger and more prominent ones. Do the same for the two veins in the lower lip.
As for the two veins under the tongue, there is benefit in letting them bleed after bleeding the temporal vein for lumps that occur in the throat due to hiccups and mouth diseases. The way to let them bleed is to have the patient sit in front of you facing the sun, raise his tongue, and look underneath it on one side for a vein and on the other side for another vein, both having a dark color.
Let them bleed but be cautious and do not focus on cutting them extensively, as there are arteries underneath, and it may lead to excessive bleeding from those arteries. As for the three veins that are bled in the elbow, they are the ones commonly bled in people generally, and their bleeding has two aspects.
Either by embedding with a broad rose or olive scalpel to the thickness, or by cutting with a knife-like scalpel, which is called nashl. [And this is its image], the image of the broad rose scalpel:.
It is broad as you can see, suitable for opening hollow veins that are full, prominent, visible, thick, and contain thick, turbid blood. This is the image of the olive scalpel:.
This scalpel is narrower and has a thinner tip, suitable for bleeding fine veins that contain thin, yellowish blood. This is the image of the nashl scalpel:.
This nashl, which is suitable for cutting, comes in broad and thin types depending on the width and narrowness of the veins as well. It can also be used for other purposes, and it is well-known among craftsmen.
As for the basilic vein, which is one of these three veins, its benefit in bleeding is that it draws blood from ailments located under the throat and neck, near the chest and abdomen. The phlebotomist should be cautious when bleeding and approach with trepidation, as there is an artery below this vein; if he errs and presses too deeply with the scalpel, he may sever that artery.
This would result in a hemorrhage, so it should not be bled with an embedding scalpel but rather by cutting with the nashl. If the basilic vein does not appear clearly, it is best to avoid it and turn to another vein or seek one of its branches.
Or you can bleed the arm vein, which is clearly visible, by cutting it with the nashl scalpel as we have said. If you want to bleed it specifically, before stretching the arm, you should palpate the area until you locate the pulse and then mark its location with ink.
Then tie the arm and make an oblique incision with the scalpel as we have said, and be careful to strike away from the location of the artery. And when you tighten the ligature and see inflation in the place marked with ink, that inflation is the swelling of the artery, so avoid it.
If you see the blood during phlebotomy jumping as a child's urine does, and the blood is thin and red, then know that it is from the artery. At this moment, quickly place your finger on it for a long while, then remove your finger. If the bleeding stops, it often will stop; then secure the arm.
Leave it as it is and warn the patient not to neglect it. Let him keep his arm immobile on his neck for days until he recovers. If the bleeding does not stop and overwhelms you, and no remedy is available at hand, then cut the artery if it appears to you, as its ends will contract and the bleeding will stop.
Or take the shell of a pistachio, split it, and take one half. Secure it tightly around the location of the vein with ligatures and bandages for another day. If the bleeding stops, otherwise treat it as previously mentioned using cautery to stop bleeding. Cutting off the blood is not difficult in most cases.
Because of the small size of the incision and the tightness of the ligature on the arm, be aware of this. As for the blue vein, the benefit of puncturing it is that it draws blood from the top of the head to the bottom of the body, as it is composed of a branch from the basilic vein and a branch from the cephalic vein, as we have said.
It is advisable for the surgeon to make an incision on the neck of the person being operated on, as below it lies a nerve. If he increases the stitches of the scalpel and injures the nerve, numbness will occur which may not be apparent and might never heal completely. This nerve is often perceptible.
If it is hidden in some people and is thin, not easily discernible, then you should make your incision with a scalpel and try to avoid the nerve as much as possible. If the vein lies between two nerves, cut the vein longitudinally. As for the temporal vein, the benefit of cutting it is that it draws blood from the head.
It is beneficial for eye diseases, and in this particular vein, if you wish to make an incision, do so with the olive-shaped scalpel or the broad rose-shaped scalpel because it is safer than other veins since there is no artery or nerve beneath it.
However, when making an incision, you should avoid cutting only the muscle's head with the scalpel and instead aim for softer areas. It does no harm if it is not hit correctly on the first attempt and needs to be reattempted, except that in some people, it may swell if not cut properly on the first strike.
However, this swelling does him no harm. As for the method of venesection and its consequences, and what should be done to correct it, first you should know that venesection is sometimes used solely for preserving health.
Or it is used for treating diseases. The venesection used for preserving health and preventing disease should be performed on one of the three veins in the elbow, namely the cephalic, basilic, or median vein, and should be done at the beginning of spring when signs of fullness appear.
Bloodletting should be done on Sunday or Tuesday after three hours of daylight, and bloodletting used for treating diseases has no fixed time but should be done whenever necessity and urgency call for it, whether day or night.
At every hour and at any time, it should not be done to bleed children until they are fourteen years old, nor should the elderly who have passed sixty years of age be bled. If anyone intends to undergo bloodletting for any reason.
It is necessary to cleanse the intestines with a mild enema before bloodletting if there is much accumulated feces, so that during bloodletting, no foul matter from the intestines is drawn into the veins and harms the principal organs. Do not bleed someone who is nauseated, intoxicated, or drunk until these conditions have passed.
One should also avoid bloodletting immediately after fasting, vomiting, defecation, excessive sexual activity, fatigue, exercise, staying awake at night, and fasting, as all these can weaken the body. Then, check to see if the humors need to be thinned beforehand if the blood is thick.
Use foods, drinks, and medicines if possible to achieve this. Then, he should go to the bathhouse if nothing prevents him or engage in some exercise to thin the blood. He should aim to have his bloodletting in the early part of the day as we said, and he should try to keep free from all mental disturbances on that day.
Such as worries, anger, fear, and all bodily exertions like excessive labor and sexual activity. Have ready for him the things that people usually use in such circumstances, like various perfumes, flowers, amusements, and so on, to whatever extent each person is able.
Then the operator sits on a cushion that is higher than the cushion on which the patient sits. Then he extends his arm, and the operator rubs it twice or three times with his hand, then tightens the ligature with pliers and twists it twice or three times, and the tightening should be moderate.
Because if the tightening is not moderate, either by excessive tightening which prevents the flow of blood or by being too loose which also prevents the flow of blood. After the tightening, it is necessary for the operator to rub both hands of the patient together with pressure.
Until the veins become swollen and visible. Then the operator wipes the scalpel with a little old oil, then places his index finger of the left hand on the same vein slightly below the desired location to avoid missing the vein and guide the cut. Because there are veins that you find like a tendon which retreats when punctured, and there are those filled with air; when the scalpel is placed on them, they sink under it and deceive the operator so that the scalpel does not open the vein. Even if it does open it, the opening will be narrow.
Therefore, it is necessary for the operator to be cautious and deliberate in all these matters. Then he should lower the scalpel; if the vein opens on that attempt, well and good, or else he should repeat it once again slightly below or above that location quickly, unless the area has become swollen.
If it becomes swollen or the patient is in distress, leave it for a day or two and do not tighten the ligature, as it might cause inflammation. Do not enter the bathhouse either. Then repeat the procedure if desired, if the scalpel has penetrated but the opening was small and the flow of blood was slight.
I fear that the amount of blood you want may not come out, so prepare the scalpel in the same hole and enlarge it slightly in a straight line. Do this quickly before the area swells, for in many people the area may swell with even a small incision.
If you see that it has swollen, do not attempt it again at all, for it will be of no use. Place something from thick oil on it, for it facilitates the flow of blood and is better in this place than the oil itself or any other fat.
Use thick oil in all your bleeding of veins when the blood flow is difficult. The theriac Faragius and Schiziania can also be used if placed on the area, as they make thick blood thin and runny.
If a large swelling occurs at the site of bleeding, which often happens, especially for someone who has been bled only that once or had a small vein opening, then immediately apply an sponge soaked in warm salt water and press it on the swelling for a short while, as this will help it to subside.
You should do this after the blood has completely flowed out from the vein itself or another vein. If a few days later there remains some discoloration in the area, it does no harm. If you wish, apply something made of figs and honey dissolved together to it.
Or something made from the juice of fumitory or similar substances. Often, swelling and a bad bruise occur when bleeding basilic veins. Place your hand on it; if you find that it feels soft when pressed, then it is a serious bruise, so be careful not to apply anything mentioned above to it.
For it may happen that blood will gush from an artery, but bind it with something that causes contraction to stiffen the area; then treat it with all other treatments until he recovers. And it is best to let out of every person's blood according to his strength and what appears of the prevailing color in the blood.
For if the blood is black, let it flow until it turns red; and likewise, if you see it thick, let it flow until it becomes thin; and likewise, if it is sharp [in nature], let it flow until its sharpness subsides. It is appropriate for one who is full and strong and needs to have bloodletting done at once.
Expand the lancet for letting blood and let the blade be wide; but for one who is weak, do the opposite of that. It is best to take out blood in several sessions, and the puncture should be narrow. The best thing to use for bleeding is a slanted, curved incision rather than stitches.
This type of bloodletting is free from excessive bleeding and from cutting a nerve, and it is better and safer than bloodletting with a wide or long incision. For one who usually experiences fainting during bloodletting, you should feed him before the procedure something made from bread soaked in pomegranate water or scallion water.
If he is constitutionally hot and blood is drawn from him in three or four sessions, if his temperament is cold, then let him take before the bleeding bread soaked in syrup of dill or in sweetened honey scented with flowers or in fragrant rose water.
If fainting occurs during bloodletting and the cause is excessive loss of blood, he should be given meat broth and light fragrant syrup, and aromatic remedies should be used to revive him by applying them to his chest. He should also use all the methods mentioned in the section on treating fainting.
That which is done for vomiting, and as for one who wishes to relieve his arm and release his blood again, it is necessary for him whose aim is to expel much by vomiting and whose strength is weak that the blood be released little by little according to his strength over consecutive days.
And as for one who wishes to relieve his arm and release his blood again, and whose body is strong, let him do so seven or nine hours after his first farding. And as for one who wishes to draw the blood from his body towards the opposite side to which it inclined, it is necessary to relieve him on the second or third day.
And as for one who has much blood in his body that has become hot and intense, causing fever, it is necessary to draw the blood out all at once and extract a large quantity, expanding the incision until fainting occurs after having been vigilant about all the conditions of phlebotomy. And place your hand on his pulse as the blood flows to prevent death instead of fainting, for this often happens if the phlebotomist is ignorant and careless. And it should not be done if you wish to relieve the arm and release the blood again.
And if the mouth of the vein has closed and the blood is difficult to extract, do not press it strongly or twist it forcefully, for that is very bad. Rather, either leave it until you can bleed it again, or use a scalpel to remove any clotted blood from the mouth of the vein.
Or apply some dissolved salt or some of the elixir called theriac or zenchunia to it and press it gently until the blood comes out. If the vein has become swollen, leave it.
Do not touch it until the swelling subsides. If necessity calls for bloodletting a second time, then either bleed above that site or bleed in the other arm or in another vein.
As for bleeding the vein of the arm, it should be done as a substitute for akhul and balsam if they are not available or are scarce, because this vein is composed of them. The method of bleeding is that the patient should immerse his hand in hot water until the wrist turns red and the vein becomes clearly visible, then tie a bandage slightly above it with moderate pressure.
Then bleed the vein slightly at an angle, neither too wide nor too long, and make the incision fairly wide. Bleed above the wrist joint a little. If the blood does not flow freely, immerse the hand again in hot water and let the blood run into the water.
Until you meet your need. If it is summer days, you may not need to immerse the hand again in hot water; more often, this is done during winter. Bleeding this vein is safer than all other veins. Because there is no harmful vein or nerve beneath it. As for bleeding the asyllum from the right hand, it is beneficial for liver ailments. The method of bleeding is to tie the wrist with a bandage or with your hand after immersing it in hot water until the vein becomes swollen.
Because there is no harmful vein or nerve beneath it. As for bleeding the asyllum from the right hand, it is beneficial for liver ailments. The method of bleeding is to tie the wrist with a bandage or with your hand after immersing it in hot water until the vein becomes swollen. It becomes very clear to the touch. Then bleed it slightly at an angle; even if you cut it completely, it will not harm it. Be careful and do not press too deeply with the lancet, as there is a nerve under it, and the area has little flesh. Then immerse the hand back in hot water.
Let it flow in it, for if you do not rinse it with hot water, the blood will freeze in the mouth of the vein and will cease to flow. When you have extracted as much blood as is necessary, apply oil and salt to the vein so that it does not heal too quickly.
And you should do the same for every narrow branch. As for the benefit of blocking it with the left hand, it is beneficial for diseases of the spleen; and you should do this in its sectioning as you did in the second one, equally. And as for venesection in the safn (a specific vein), its benefit is for diseases in the lower body, such as diseases of the uterus.
And for the retention of menses, kidney diseases, chronic ulcers on the thighs and legs, and similar ailments, the method of venesection is to immerse his foot in hot water and massage it until the veins dilate. Then press above the knee joint with a tourniquet; the vein's location is at the ankle on the outer side near the thumb.
And from it, many branches spread out on the leg. Section it in the widest branch of it or at the ankle where it converges; this is better and safer. If you section it on the front of the leg, be careful of the nerves that lie beneath it on the surface of the leg.
Make your venesection with a twist, as if you intend to amputate it, and use a cutting instrument. If the blood does not come out, immerse his foot in hot water and let the blood flow freely until it stops. If the surgeon misses the vein on the first attempt.
Let him try again by venesection a little higher up, for the place is safe and no danger need be feared if you are careful of the nerve as we said. And do the same with the safn vein on the other leg equally. As for the sciatic vein, its location is as we said at the heel from the medial side.
And the benefit of opening it for pain in the hip if that is due to hot blood and how to open it: The patient should go to the bathhouse and hurry, and tie his leg from the hip down to four fingers above the heel with a thin long turban; otherwise it will not be apparent.
When it appears, open it as you wish to treat it, either by incising it, which is better, or amputating it completely, or splitting it open, if the place is safe; in most people, this area is very hidden indeed. If you do not find it.
And if it does not appear at all to the senses, then open some of its branches, which are those that appear on the back of the foot near the little toe and the ring finger, and be careful of the nerves, and let out as much blood as you wish.
Then loosen the binding and place a piece of cotton on the site of the incision, and bind the area; it will quickly heal.
Chapter Sixty-Six.
On Cupping and How to Use It.
Cupping instruments may be made of horns, wood, brass, or glass. Cupping is done in two ways: one by making an incision and drawing blood, the other without any incision.
This cupping without any incision is done in two ways.
The pterygoid plates and the two sides of the neck, the chin below the lower jaw from the mouth, the shoulders, the coccyx at the end of the tailbone, the middle parts of the arms, the thighs, the calves, and the popliteal pits.
Cupping therapy draws blood from the thin veins dispersed in the flesh, and for this reason it does not deplete strength as much as bloodletting does. It should not be used with heat or without heat in any diseases caused by excess until the body is completely purged.
If there is a need for cupping due to a disease or as a habit, we use it at any time, at the beginning of the month, at its end, in the middle, and at any time.
This is because there are people who, when their blood becomes excessive and they need to have it removed by cupping, feel heaviness and headaches in their head. Some of them experience swelling and redness in their face, head, and neck. Others may feel itching on their face and temples, see dark spots or floaters in their eyes, and itch at the sites where cupping is applied.
Some of them laugh frequently, some taste blood in their mouth, have bleeding gums, and spit blood. Others sleep excessively, and see blood, redness, dead people, wounds, and similar things in their dreams. When we notice any of these signs,
Especially if it is in the middle third of the month, we then order cupping after two or three hours have passed since noon. As for the benefit of puncture cupping, it helps with heaviness in the head and water that accumulates in the eyes.
However, it should be done after purging the body. And this cupping can be a substitute for phlebotomy of the temporal vein. It is warned that it should not be used by someone with cold blood or who has an illness, for it would greatly harm him.
Therefore, it should not be used by the elderly or those who have cold diseases in their heads, and those who are accustomed to it may develop forgetfulness.
Therefore, it is necessary to order the cupper to lower his hand slightly downward with the lancet, fearing the development of forgetfulness. As for cupping the shoulder blade, it is a substitute for phlebotomy of the occipital vein and the basilic vein.
It is beneficial for asthma, shortness of breath, constriction of the respiratory organs, coughing, and fullness. And it should be raised slightly when performing cupping on the shoulder blade because if it is directed downward, it would cause weakness in the heart and stomach.
As for cupping the temples, it is beneficial for sudden headaches, conjunctivitis, migraines, choking, and pain at the roots of the teeth. It is a substitute for phlebotomy of the basilic vein. And you should order the cupper not to deepen his hand with the lancet so as not to cut an artery causing excessive bleeding.
As for cupping under the chin, it is beneficial for abscesses in the mouth, gum disease, and other diseases of the mouth. It can also serve as a substitute for phlebotomy of the jugular veins on the lips. As for cupping the shoulders, it is beneficial for palpitations caused by fullness and heat.
And as for abdominal cupping on the sides of the thighs, it is beneficial in drawing off blood from the three veins: the basilic, the ocularis internus (eyebrow vein), and the vaginal, because it attracts blood from all those thin veins in the flesh and draws those thin veins from other thicker veins until the suction reaches the three thick veins.
It is advisable to order the cupper not to be excessive in the suction, as the area is thin and has nerves and arteries beneath it. As for a single cupping on the coccyx, it is beneficial for hemorrhoids of the buttocks and sores of the lower part.
It is advisable to order the cupper to use a large cup made of copper because the area requires strong suction, and glass cups may break or require excessive suction. As for the cupping on the legs, it clearly reduces swelling.
Because it attracts blood from the entire body and is beneficial for chronic pains in the kidneys, uterus, and bladder; it induces menstruation and is helpful for boils and varicose veins. It serves as an alternative to cupping the ankles and popliteal fossa, although it exhausts the body greatly and causes fainting in most people. Cupping on the popliteal fossa has benefits similar to cupping on the legs.
The method of placing the cups is to place them first empty and then draw moderate suction. Do not keep the cups in one place for too long, but place them quickly and remove them quickly so that the humors flow evenly to the area. Continue repeating this until you see the area has reddened and opened up.
When the redness of blood appears, then incise and gradually repeat the cauterization. Then observe the condition of the body; for those who have thin flesh with loose pores, it should be incised once only, lest the place ulcerate.
Order the cupper to widen the incision and deepen it slightly, and adjust the cauterization gently with slight movement. If there is thick blood, it should be incised twice: in the first time, let him open a path for the thin blood and its liquidity, and in the second time, for the thorough removal of the thick blood.
If the blood is very turbid, repeat the incision a third time to reach the goal. In general, if we wish to remove a small amount of blood, one incision is sufficient; if we wish to remove a large amount of blood, make more incisions, especially if the blood is thick.
It is necessary to make a deep incision, and the moderate limit of the incision is only the depth of the skin. What should be used among ointments when applying cupping instruments and water, and what the patient should beware of; as for those whose skin is thick, hard, and dry with narrow pores.
The areas where the cupping instruments will be applied should be ointed with substances that are clarifying, softening, and resolving. If it is summer time, such as with kerri oil or violet oil or sweet almond oil or cucumber seed oil.
If it is winter, such as narcissus oil or lily oil or chamomile oil or daffodil oil and the like. If the residue is thick and cold, then use oil such as marzangish oil or plum kernel oil or benzoin oil or cypress oil and the like.
If the person to be bled has large pores and loose flesh, then it is advisable to avoid using oil; these people should wash their bleeding sites after phlebotomy with rose water or cold water or wolf grape water or pumpkin water or coltsfoot water or similar. As for those whose blood is very moist,
He should wash his bleeding sites with vinegar or wormwood and sumac water or similar. As for those whose superfluous flesh is hard, they should wash their bleeding sites with old wine or murtjanash water or spinach broth or chamomile and similar. And it is advisable to avoid bleeding in a bathhouse or immediately after bathing.
Rather, it is advisable to perform bleeding one hour or two hours after leaving the bathhouse. One should not sleep immediately after phlebotomy. Here are instructions for the person to be bled and their attendant before and after phlebotomy.
First, one must consider that if the person to be bled or cupped has jaundice and their blood tends towards sharpness and inflammation, then they should take cooling remedies such as pomegranate, chicory with vinegar, lettuce, sorrel, radish, and similar. Their diet should consist of farinaceous foods, mutton stew, herbs, and similar.
And if the person's temperament is cold, then they should be given honey syrup, mubyah syrup, or aromatic radish seed syrup and moderate fragrant wine that lies between old and new. They should be instructed to eat less and their diet should consist of farinaceous foods, millet porridge, birds, and pigeon stew. It is advisable for the drink on the day of phlebotomy and cupping to be more than the food.
It is appropriate at times to give some people the dual remedy or musk medicine or siltha before cupping and bloodletting, or after it, to strengthen the principal organs and thin the blood; it should not be given to infants.
As for the cupping that is done without conditions, it is the cupping placed on the liver, spleen, breasts, abdomen, navel, and kidney areas as well as the inner thigh because these organs cannot tolerate being conditioned upon. The purpose of this is either to draw blood from one part to another.
Like placing the cups on the breasts in cases of nosebleed, or using them to expel cold wind that has lodged in a part such as placing them on the abdomen and navel, for they stir up the organ, warm it, and relieve pain by releasing that wind.
They may be placed on the kidneys if there is obstruction or stones, for the force of their suction might open up obstructions or dislodge stones from their place. Similarly, they do this when applied to the liver and spleen in cases of wind that causes discomfort in these organs. These cups may also be used empty by suction only.
They may be used with fire, and they may also be used filled with warm water in cases of swellings. This is done by filling the cup with hot water alone or with water that has been boiled with certain herbs suitable for this purpose.
Then it is placed on the affected area while filled and held in place, removed, and reapplied as needed. This is an image of the cup used with fire: .
The width of its mouth is two open fingers, as we have depicted, and its depth is half a finger. There should be a small hole near the middle of it, about the size an needle can enter; it should be made of Chinese copper or yellow brass with thick edges.
Smooth, even, and polished so as not to injure the part when applied; in the middle of it there is a small piece of copper or iron where the candle is placed for heating. This leechglass may be made larger than described or smaller according to the diseases.
And use it appropriately, for the leech glasses for children and thin people are not the same as those for adult men with robust bodies. As for how to place this leechglass over the part using fire, light a wick made of flax or a small candle made of bitumen with fire and place it in the middle of the hardened core that is in the center of the leechglass.
So that the fire rises upwards towards the bottom of the leechglass to avoid burning the patient's body. Then place it on the part, and cover the hole we mentioned with a finger until you hold the leechglass as needed, then remove your finger.
Steam will then come out of that hole, and the leechglass will loosen in place. Then light the wick as described and repeat if necessary. As for the leechglass used to treat sores with water, it does not have a hardened core or a hole.
It is used by filling it with water and placing it on the part only. This is its image:.
The larger this leechglass is, the more water it can hold and thus the better it is.
Chapter Seventy-Nine.
On the Application of Leeches.
Leeches are primarily used in most cases on body parts where cupping is not possible, either due to their small size, such as the lip and gum, or because the part lacks sufficient flesh, such as the finger and nose.
To use them, select leeches from fresh, clean water, free from contamination. Then leave them in freshwater for a day and night until they are hungry and empty inside. Then initially bleed the body either by venesection or cupping, and then cleanse the affected part.
Until it becomes red, then place the leeches on it. When they are full, they will fall off. If possible, sucking the area with a cupping instrument is more effective. Otherwise, wash the area with vinegar and then with plenty of water, massage it, and squeeze it. If bleeding continues after the leeches have fallen off, wet a piece of linen in cold water.
Place it on top until the bleeding stops. If there is excessive blood, sprinkle powdered frankincense, myrtle leaves, or similar astringents until the bleeding stops, or apply sliced and peeled onions to the area.
Leave it until the onion sticks to the area, as this will stop the bleeding. If leeches need to be reapplied, do not use the same ones if possible; instead, apply fresh blood to the area to encourage new leeches to attach.
Or insert a needle into the area until it draws some blood, then leave it. If it feels something from the blood, it will stick in place. When you want to remove it, sprinkle some vinegar or salt or ash on it, and it will fall out of place.
The Third Chapter.
On Bone Setting.
This chapter is also part of the methods needed in the practice of medicine, specifically for setting fractures and resetting dislocated bones.
Know, my sons, that this chapter is falsely claimed by ignorant physicians and common people who have never perused any book of the ancients or read a single word from it.
For this reason, this field of knowledge is nonexistent in our country, and I have never encountered anyone who excels in it at all. And I have acquired what I know from this field through extensive reading of the books of the earlier scholars and a keen desire to understand them, from which I extracted the knowledge, then I devoted myself to practice and experience throughout my life.
And I have illustrated for you in this chapter all that is within my knowledge on the subject. My experience has tested it, and I have presented it to you in a concise form, free from unnecessary details, clearly explained, and illustrated with many images of the instruments used in this practice.
It is for the sake of clearer explanation, as I did in the preceding chapters. There is no power but with God, the Most High, the Almighty.
Chapter One.
It is best to present general points and sections before we begin to describe individually the broken and dislocated parts. It is necessary to mention some statements and chapters at the beginning of this chapter. It first compels you and those who are eager to learn this noble craft, other than yourselves, to understand it and grasp its true nature.
I say that when anyone suffers a fracture, dislocation, contusion, or fall, you must first hurry to purge them or induce vomiting, or both. Unless there is a reason to prevent it, such as weakness of strength or the person affected being a child, an elderly person, or unless the time is extremely hot or cold.
Then, in his diet, he should limit himself to legumes, cold foods, bird meat, and broth, while avoiding drinks, tough meats, overeating, and any food that fills the veins with blood until there is no fear of swelling and no risk of fluid accumulation at the site.
At that time, the patient should return to his usual regimen. When the broken bone begins to heal, the patient should be fed rich and thick foods with viscosity, such as liver, rice, heads, feet, and cow stomachs. Eggs, soft fish, thick drinks, and similar foods should also be consumed. With this regimen, the union of the fracture will be faster and better. Note that if bones are broken in strong men or elderly people, they cannot naturally reconnect and heal as they once were.
Their bones are porous and strong, but what was extremely soft among the bones joins together as though it were the bones of very young children. However, nature generates on all sides of the broken bone something like glue that thickens and adheres to it, binding it until its parts adhere to one another.
It binds to each other until it becomes as strong and secure as it was initially, so nothing hinders its function.
For this reason, it is necessary to give the patient foods that are nutritious, sticky, and thick, as we have said. Know that fractures differ in types according to the difference in body parts; a fracture of the leg bone differs from a skull fracture, and a rib fracture differs from a spine fracture.
Similarly, all other body parts differ from one another. We will come to describe each type of fracture in detail and separately in its chapter. Also, the type of bone fracture may vary within itself.
Because it may be a longitudinal fracture without any shards, or it may be a fracture along the length of the bone with shards that are either clean or dirty. A fracture can also occur with a wound or tear in the skin, and it may be a slight crack.
Each type has a specific method for setting it, as will be mentioned in detail in its place. What identifies a bone fracture is its curvature, irregularity, visibility to the senses, and brittleness when you touch it with your hand.
When there is no obvious curvature, brittleness, or disturbance felt when examining the bone, and if the patient does not experience much pain, then there is no fracture. It may be a bruise or a slight crack, so it should not be moved by pulling or pressing at all.
But apply the medicines that will be mentioned later, which are suitable for the condition, then bind it gently. And know that if a bone breaks into two pieces without producing splinters, each piece moves away from its partner.
You should immediately proceed to realign and straighten it before a hot swelling occurs. If a hot swelling does occur, leave it for several days until the swelling subsides, then align it as gently and skillfully as possible.
Know that realigning and straightening a bone without splinters is easier than one with splinters. Then bind it as will be mentioned later. If the bone has splinters, it is necessary to extend the broken limb from both sides, whether hand or foot.
Use your hands if the limb is small, or use two ropes, or combine a rope with your hand. Place the limb on a flat surface in its natural shape so that when each part of the broken bone extends, then gently and skillfully return those parts to their proper places.
Strive to avoid causing pain or discomfort to the patient with your actions. Strive to join one bone with its partner in the best possible manner. At this time, touch and feel them with your hand; if you notice anything amiss, correct it as well as you can.
Be cautious of excessive stretching and strong pulling, as many unskilled people often do. Such actions frequently lead to hot swelling or deformity in the limb, as I have repeatedly observed from their practices.
Then he must ensure that after leveling, perfection, and securing that member, it remains still and relaxed. He warns the patient not to move it during his waking hours and sleep, when changing positions, during agitation, while evacuating waste, and in all movements as far as possible, and that he should be careful that the posture of the part is such that it ensures freedom from pain.
This is because when he feels pain or discomfort in the position of the part, he should move it to a different position where he does not feel any pain, and at the same time ensure that this new position is level and straight.
To prevent the part from becoming crooked when it is set, and as for how to secure a broken part, it is as I will describe to you. Know that broken parts vary in size, such as small ones like the arm, finger, and shinbone and the like.
For smaller parts, such as the arm, finger, and shinbone, the bandages should be soft and fine. For larger and tougher parts like the thigh, back, and chest, the bandages should be broad and firm because a wide ligament is necessary for large parts and it evenly secures them from all sides without any flaws.
Then after completing the leveling, you should apply the appropriate plaster. Apply a flexible and soft bandage to the site of the fracture, then start wrapping the ligature directly over the site of the fracture for three or four layers as needed by the part. Tighten the ligature slightly with your hand, then move it upwards from the site of the fracture.
Apply pressure less intensely than you would to the broken area, then move away from the site of the fracture slightly and gradually release the tension little by little until you secure a proper portion, then take another bandage and wrap it around the broken area as well.
Wrap the area, then move the wrapping to the lower part of the fracture. The tension and looseness of the wrap should be as we mentioned for the first upper wrapping. Then place between the layers of bandages soft splints or cloth to straighten the crookedness of the fracture.
If there is any crookedness, then place something to correct it; otherwise, do not add anything. Then wrap another bandage over it. Finally, apply secure splints from your supplies to these wrappings if there is no swelling or hot inflammation in the limb.
If there is swelling or hot inflammation, apply something to reduce the swelling and dispel the puffiness. Leave it for several days, then secure the splints over it at that time. The splints should be made from half sections of large, carefully carved bamboo or can be made from riddle wood.
These are made from pine resin, date palm strips, hemp, straw, or similar materials that are available. The width of each splint should be as described and in this particular shape.
Except that the splint placed directly on the fracture itself should be slightly thicker and wider than the other splints. As for the length of the splint, it should be made according to the size of the broken limb, whether large or small. The shape of the splint:
Then secure the plaster with another bandage as tightly as you did initially, and then bind it from above with strong threads according to what we mentioned about the tightness, which should be tighter at the site of the fracture. And the tighter the binding should decrease as it moves farther from the site of the fracture.
The threads should be of medium thickness and softness; they should preferably be made from moist linen, especially because if the threads are thick, as you have seen foolish people do by making them from twisted linen strips, it is a great mistake.
For with such thick threads, the tension becomes excessive and immoderate, and very thin threads are also unsuitable because you cannot achieve the desired tightness with them. It should not be less than a finger's width between one bandage and another.
If the patient is harmed by the edges of the bandages after they are properly tightened, place soft linen or fluffed wool underneath to prevent any harm. As for when there is a fracture with a wound and a break in the skin occurs, we will discuss that separately.
Know that not every broken limb should be bandaged on the first day. If the limb is large, it should not be bandaged until after five or seven days, or even longer, depending on your assurance of preventing a hot swelling.
This is the description of the dressings used by early practitioners to treat fractures, dislocations, and wounds. It is a general, concise bandage that can stabilize a fracture and is suitable for most constitutions, especially for children and women because it neither causes heat nor cold.
And you take from the dust of the millstone, which is the bran that sticks to the walls of the millstone during its operation. You knead it as it is without sifting it with egg whites and make your dough neither too thick nor too thin, then spread it.
The description of another dressing to set fractures, dislocations, and contusions: Take of mastic, ladanum, aquae cyri, rue, safflower, and sage ten dirhams each; of myrtle and Syrian or Roman clay twenty dirhams each. Grind all ingredients and mix them with water of wormwood or with egg whites if the patient's temperament is hot. Then use this dressing, for it is well composed; it sets broken bones quickly and suits most people due to its moderation.
The description of another dressing that is also beneficial for fractures and contusions: Take mastic, frankincense, and white linseed ten dirhams each; myrtle and Syrian rue five dirhams each; aquae cyri six dirhams; Armenian clay twenty dirhams. Grind all finely, sift it, mix with water or egg whites, and use it.
A dressing for joints and bones that have moved from their places, to relieve the pain associated with them, and for bone concussion and fractures: Take clean wool and dip it in vinegar and cooked oil, then place it on the affected area. This dressing does not have the strength to set the bones.
However, it is excellent for relieving hot swelling and dispelling pain in particular. The description of another dressing to set a broken bone: Take the leaves of the black fig tree and wild opium poppy, grind them together, and apply them wet. The description of another brief dressing used when the bone has begun to heal.
And when you want to analyze the rest of the tumor, take from the root of the henna and chamomile and blue larkspur and fine cornmeal, one part each. Crush all of them and knead with glue if the organ is not inflamed; if it is inflamed, then knead with water cress juice or with water and use it.
A description of a stronger dressing for analysis than the first one is used when a hard tumor occurs after the bone has healed. Take from the root of the henna, flax seeds, fenugreek, rosemary, and blue larkspur and chamomile, one part each of each.
Crush all of them and knead with vinegar water or fresh water or glue, whichever is appropriate according to the heat of the organ and its calmness. As for Hippocrates, he did not mention in his book to apply anything on the broken part when setting it.
Except for the kerutioti made of wax and oil, nothing else. He described it as being medium between thickness and thinness. As for Galen, he thought that when setting a broken part, things with dryness should be applied along with some heat, such as aloeswood, helleborus, frankincense, and similar items mentioned.
A description of a dressing that is beneficial for weakness and pain: Take mastic, fenugreek, human cut hair or bird feathers, henna, and an equal part of salt. Crush them all, sift them, knead them, and apply the dressing with it. As for how much the bandage should remain.
Then it should be left intact, meaning you should observe. If the patient does not experience pain or itching, and the broken bone does not move from its place, then do not loosen it for many days. If severe itching occurs in the area, or if there is disturbing pain or swelling, however.
Act quickly and remove it at the right time, do not delay in doing so; move the bandage away. Then take a soft piece of cloth or a sponge soaked in fresh water and dip it in warm water to wash the area until the itching stops and the pain subsides. Then let the part rest for an hour.
Then apply wool that has been soaked in vinegar and oil or rose fat, and bind it on him for a night until you are safe from the hot swelling and the distension of the part subsides and its pain goes away. Then return to gentle compression and minimal bandaging; do not tighten it as you did initially.
Treat him gently until he recovers. If you see that the swelling, redness, pain, distension, and all symptoms have subsided completely and there is a need for bandaging and compression, then prepare it as you did initially without exception. If nothing from what was mentioned occurs in the part.
Do not remove it until after three days or four or five or seven, and sometimes leave it for twenty days; all of this depends on what appears to you regarding the condition of the part as we said. Wait until the bone is set and the flesh has begun to heal around it.
At that time, also increase the compression more than you did initially. Also, increase the thickness of the patient's diet as previously mentioned. If you see that the area around the fracture has dried and wasted more than what is appropriate, then know that nutrition is not reaching it.
Wash it with warm water each time you remove the bandage, and do this every three days. Also slightly reduce the compression. By doing so, nutrition will flow to the part more quickly, and it will heal rapidly. As for what ignorant bone setters do, which is to break the part again.
If it is not first set aright as it should be, and if it is then set crookedly, this is an error in their doing and a great deception. Even if it were correct, the early scholars would have mentioned it in their books and practiced it, but I have seen absolutely no trace of it from any of them. And the correct approach is not to work with it,
The second chapter.
On contused fractures in the head.
The types of contused fractures in the head are numerous, and their shapes differ; their causes are varied. There are some fractures that result from a sword blow and may involve the bone being completely severed to reach the layer beneath the bone. As when carving wood.
Therefore, this type of fracture is called a carving-type fracture. Alternatively, the sword may cut part of the bone but only its surface, without penetrating through completely; this type of fracture is called an avulsion. The wound resulting from these fractures may be either large or small.
There are also fractures that are comminuted or contused, caused by a blow from a stone or falling onto a stone or something similar. This type of fracture may either penetrate nearly to the layer beneath the bone or remain on the surface of the bone.
The wound resulting from these fractures may also be either large or small. There are also hidden fractures in the bone, in its thinness like a hairline, which is a slight displacement.
Therefore, this type of fracture is called a poetic one, and from it comes a fracture that occurs due to a fall or being hit by a stone or the like, where the surface of the bone enters inward, and the place becomes indented as if a bronze vessel were struck and part of it entered inward.
This most often occurs in the soft skull bones, such as those of infants. There may be splinters present or absent in all these types of fractures, and we will come to discuss the treatment of all this in its proper place, and we will identify all these types of fractures by examining them.
Examine it with probes and remove any rotten flesh from it. As for the poetic type of fracture, it is identified by exposing the bone, wiping it clean, and smearing it with ink; then the fracture will appear black. As for the treatment of fractures, first observe the symptoms of the patient.
If you observe from the symptoms clear indications of fear, such as vomiting bile, dilation, loss of consciousness, cessation of voice, fainting, severe fever, protrusion and redness of the eyes, and similar symptoms, then do not approach the patient or treat him, for with these symptoms death is inevitable in most cases.
If you see symptoms that do not alarm you and you hope for the patient's safety, then proceed with his treatment. This is because if a wounded person comes to you at the beginning of their injury, especially during the winter days.
It is essential to strive to remove the bone before the fourteenth day, in all cases. If it is during summer days, it is necessary to hasten and remove the bone before the seventh day to prevent the membrane beneath the bone from rotting, thus avoiding those symptoms we have described.
If the bone fracture has reached the membrane covering the brain and is accompanied by a crush injury or contusion, it is necessary to cut the crushed and bruised part as I will describe to you, which is to shave the head of the injured patient.
And expose the bone from any angle that suits you, depending on the shape of the wound and what is most comfortable for the patient. If bleeding or a hot swelling occurs when exposing the bone, deal with it as appropriate.
This involves stuffing the area with a bandage soaked in syrup, orpiment, and fat until the swelling subsides and bleeding is controlled, then proceed to shape and extract the bone, which can be done in one of two ways.
One way is to cut the bone with a fine, narrow blade, and this is its illustration:.
Then use another blade slightly wider than this one, and this is its illustration:.
Then use another blade that is even wider than the second one. It is essential to have several different blades, some wider than others and some shorter, with their edges being extremely sharp. They should be made of Indian iron or good steel.
Use caution when striking the blade to avoid shaking the head and causing harm. If the bone is strong and hard, it is necessary to drill around it before using the blades, with drills that are not deep, which they called non-penetrating drills.
Because they do not exceed the thickness of the skull bone and go beyond it. The drill has a circular flange below its sharp head, resembling a ring or small circle, which prevents it from penetrating deeper than the thickness of the bone.
You should have a variety of these drills, each suitable for the thickness of that bone, so that you have a drill with a sharp point in various lengths and sizes according to the thickness of each skull. And this is an image of three types. Of the drills, there is a large, medium, and small one:.
As for drilling around a broken bone, place the drill on the bone and rotate it with your fingers until you know that the bone has been penetrated, then move the drill to another position. Leave a distance between each hole equal to the thickness of a wire or something similar.
Then, cut between each two holes using the cutter with as much gentleness as you can manage, as we said, until you remove the bone either by hand or with another tool from among those you have prepared for this purpose.
Such as soft clamps and cautery, and you must be extremely careful that the drill or cutter does not touch any delicate tissue. When you remove the bone and it is free from adhering tissues if they were attached to it, then it should be cleaned thoroughly.
Smooth out the roughness that remains in the bone with another tool similar to the cutter, but it should be thinner and more delicate than other cutters. If any small pieces of bone or fragments remain, remove them gently using the tools you have.
Then, treat the wound afterwards with bandages and ointments that will be mentioned. As for the other approach to this work, it is extremely simple and free from risks; Galen mentioned it and praised it highly, as he said. You should first start by exposing the part of the bone in the place where the fracture is most severe and prominent. Once you have exposed that part, place beneath it this concave segment, and here is its shape:.
The concave part of it should be smooth and not cutting anything, while the sharp edges on its sides, as you see, should rest against the abdominal wall and the surface of the bone. Then strike the segment from one side.
Using a small hammer until you gently cut through all the bone as it rotates, while you are safe from harming the membrane in any terrifying way. Even if the surgeon is the least knowledgeable and most cowardly person, or even asleep.
If any part of the membrane remains attached to the bone in some places, scrape it off with the edge of the concave segment itself and gently remove it. It will come off without causing any harm or fear.
If the bone fracture has not penetrated the membrane and the broken surface of the bone is rough with small fragments, you should remove that roughness and extract those fragments using fine probes. Prepare a variety of sizes for these instruments so that in each case, you can use the one most appropriate for the situation as dictated by your work.
And the same goes for the broken bone and its shape. You should use initially the widest of these probes to clean the bone, then use one that is finer than the previous one, and continue in this manner until you reach the finest and thinnest probe available.
As for the smaller hairline cracks and minor fractures, you should treat each case according to what leads to its proper healing. This is something that is not hidden from anyone who has even a basic familiarity with this craft and has studied what we have written and explained about larger fractures.
If the membrane remains exposed when you extract the bone, you should take a piece of linen bandage the size of the wound, dip it in rose oil, and place it over the mouth of the wound; then take another folded or triangular bandage. Dip it in syrup and rose oil, and place it on the first bandage; do this as lightly as possible so as not to burden the peritoneum. Then use a wide bandage above, but tighten it only enough to hold the wound securely.
Leave it with this treatment for a day or two until you are safe from the hot swelling. Then loosen it and use thereafter medicines that have a drying effect, such as the roots of safflower, fenugreek flour, crocus powder, saunders, and similar ones. Make a poultice from these medicines.
Apply it to the wound as a dry poultice. In general, use a medicine that cleanses without irritating. Strive to keep the treatment clean, with no grease from oil or dirt, and do not allow pus to accumulate in it at all.
Because if pus accumulates on the membrane of the brain, it will corrupt and rot it, causing great harm to the patient. This can occur in the peritoneum when the bone is exposed, especially if care is neglected in its treatment.
If there is blackness on its surface, observe if the patient exhibits the symptoms we mentioned. If so, know that he is certainly doomed. Even if the blackness occurred due to a medicine applied and had the power to cause such discoloration.
You should take one part honey and three parts rose oil, mix them well, then apply it to a piece of cloth and place it on the abdomen. Then treat it with various treatments until it heals.
Chapter Three.
On the repair of the nose if it is broken.
Know that the upper part of the nose breaks completely or partially on one side because it consists of two bones. The lower part, however, is cartilaginous and does not break; instead, it may suffer contusion, deformation, or perforation.
If one of the sides breaks, you should insert your little finger into the nostril and align the break from inside using your index finger and thumb from outside until the nose returns to its natural shape. Do this gently and be careful not to cause pain to the patient by your actions.
If the break is at the top of the nose and your finger cannot reach it, it should be aligned with a slightly thickened probe. If the break is on both sides, do the same. It is best to set it on the first day of the fracture.
If possible, otherwise after the seventh or tenth day when the hot swelling subsides, then insert a thread of linen cloth into one nostril if the break is on one side, or two threads if the break is on both sides.
The threads should be thick enough to fill the nostril. Some early surgeons mentioned soaking the threads in ghee and changing them daily, but I do not recommend this. Instead, it is better to soak the threads in egg white mixed with flour dust.
Then leave the bandages until the bone is set and the cartilage stiffens, and you may insert into the nose for the bandaging goose feather tubes wrapped in soft cloth to make it more secure for a broken nose and so that the patient does not refrain from breathing.
This is not essential; if you wish, you may do it, or you may use bandages. If a hot swelling occurs in the nose during your work, apply a dressing with vinegar and rose oil or some ointment like diachylon.
If no hot swelling occurs, it is advisable to dress it externally with semolina and fenugreek flour mixed with egg white, then place a soft bandage on it but do not bind the nose at all. If the bones of the nose are fractured slightly,
or if they are crushed, you should incise them and remove them with the appropriate instrument, then suture the incision and treat it with ointments that promote healing. If a wound occurs inside the nose, you should dress it with bandages and use lead tubes. Until it heals.
Chapter Four.
On the reduction of the lower jaw when it is fractured.
If the lower jaw is fractured but there is no wound associated with it, observe carefully. If the fracture is only on the outside and does not break into two pieces and does not deform inward, then identifying it will be easier.
If the fracture is on the right side, insert your middle finger of the left hand into the patient's mouth. If the fracture is on the left side, insert your middle finger of the right hand and gently raise the hump of the fracture from inside to outside.
Use your other hand from outside the bone to adjust and smooth it. If the jaw fracture has split into two, it should be pulled straight from both sides until it is properly aligned. If there has been a growth in the teeth,
or if they are loose, secure them with gold or silver thread or wire. Then place a quilted pad on the broken jaw, and put a folded cloth over it. Place a large, tight bandage or a piece of sole leather equal in length to the jaw over the cloth. Then tie it from above as you see fit, ensuring it is secure and does not come loose. Instruct the patient to rest quietly and give them soft, easily digestible food. If you suspect any change in appearance, address it on the third day.
Then tie it from above as you see fit, ensuring it is secure and does not come loose. Instruct the patient to rest quietly and give them soft, easily digestible food. If you suspect any change in appearance, address it on the third day. Then prepare the dressing with flour sieve dust mixed with egg white or semolina, after removing the quilted pad. Place a soft piece of cloth over the bandage. As long as the bandage sticks to it and there is no change in the condition of the bone, leave it as it is.
Do not remove it until it is healed and the fracture has become solid, as this often takes about three weeks. If a hot swelling appears during that time, use what we have mentioned repeatedly to relieve it until the swelling subsides.
If the fracture is accompanied by a wound, examine it. If there are bone fragments in the wound, carefully remove them using an appropriate tool. If the opening of the wound is narrow, widen it with scissors as needed.
Then, when you have removed those fragments and nothing remains of them, trace the mouth of the wound if it is wide, otherwise apply one of the ointments suitable for that. And let the wound heal until it is healed.
Chapter Five.
On the healing of the collarbone if it is broken.
The collarbone is most often broken from the front at the end of the shoulder, and its break can occur in one of three ways: either it breaks and splits into two parts without producing fragments, which is easiest to heal.
Or it can produce fragments, which is more difficult to heal. Or the break can occur with a wound. If the break does not involve a wound, two assistants should be present: one to steady the arm adjacent to the broken collarbone, and the other to extend the neck towards the opposite side.
Then, straighten the break with your fingers until its shape is as it should be, without any protrusions or misalignments. If more extension is needed, place a ball of cloth or wool under the armpit of the injured person.
Make the ball the size needed, extend and raise the collarbone, and press on the ball with your hand until the break is properly aligned. If you cannot pull the end of the collarbone outward because it has become deep within, the injured person should lie face down.
Place a cushion of moderate thickness under his armpit, and have the assistant press his shoulder downward so that the deeply situated collarbone rises upward. Then, correct and align the break with your fingers.
If you feel that a fragment of the collarbone has broken and is moving, it is necessary to cut and gently remove that fragment. If the fragment is embedded in the bone, devise a way to cut it using one of the tools prepared for such purposes. After placing under the collarbone the instrument that protects the intestines, which is made of wood or iron, and this is its image:.
It resembles a spoon without a handle, and its width depends on the size of the bone, whether large or small. As for its length, it should be according to what is suitable for work. It should have two ends, one end wider and the other narrower, as you can see.
If the wound you have opened to remove a bone fragment is wide and there is no fear of inflammation, then stitch the edges of the wound together. If the wound is small or if you are afraid of inflammation, extend the wound and cover it with a dressing, the size of which should be according to the extent of the incision.
If there is inflammation, apply the wound with rose oil and vinegar or drink, and manage it accordingly. As for setting a bone without a wound or incision, wrap the bone with a dressing made from flour dust mixed with egg whites. Place a soft pad on it, then place a ball under his armpit if needed. Take a long headcloth, about an inch wide or so, and wrap a folded dressing around the pad and bandage. Then take a splint made from a thin piece of wood. Its width should be three fingers, and it should also be of similar length. Then wrap it in a piece of cloth, then wrap that cloth along with the splint into the headcloth at the place where the fracture is located. Then tie the headcloth around the fracture tightly as you go around. Place it around his neck and under both armpits, the healthy one and the sick one, and pull it several times on every side. And see how tightly the bandage controls the fracture, which is something that is not hidden from you.
And the goal is that the splint should not move from the broken bone. Therefore, it is necessary to check on the patient every day. Whenever the bandage becomes loose and you see that the splint has moved, fix this and tighten the bandage. Then make the patient sleep on their back and place a small pillow under their armpit when they sleep at night.
To raise his shoulder off the side so that the fracture of the collarbone rises with the shoulder, or tie his arm to his neck. Do not loosen the bandage unless an event such as itching or swelling occurs in the area after twelve days.
Then renew the bandage if you see a need for it. And pull in the tension and leave it until the fracture of the collarbone heals and becomes more complex, and it strengthens and becomes firmer after twenty-eight days. It may also occur in some people in less than that.
Chapter Six.
On the Healing of a Broken Shoulder. The shoulder rarely breaks in its broad part but rather in its corners. When it breaks at one of these corners or in the middle, this is known by touch. Treatment should be based on the shape of the fracture.
Smooth it and restore it to its natural shape by whatever means you can, then apply dust from a millstone mixed with egg white and soft lint to the area, cover it with folded cloth, and finally place a wide splint made of wood on top.
Make it as thin as the shoulder or slightly wider than the shoulder. If there is a depression under the splint in any part of the shoulder, smooth out that depression with soft lint so that the splint lies flat, then secure it from above with a long headcloth.
Apply a firm binding and ensure the splint does not move from its place. Check the bandage every day, and whenever it loosens, tighten it and adjust the splint if it has moved from its position. Let the patient lie on their healthy side, and the shoulder will heal in twenty days.
After one day or twenty-five days, when this period is complete, loosen the bandage with confidence, for this is a bone that does not fear being shattered or fractured. If a fragment of bone protrudes and is pressing under the skin, make an incision to remove it. And follow what was mentioned for a fracture of the collarbone in treating any hot swelling if such a thing occurs.
Chapter Seven.
On the healing of rib fractures.
The chest may break in the middle, but this is rare. Its sides are more likely to break and fragment. If the middle of the chest breaks, it will tilt downward, causing severe pain, difficulty breathing, and coughing.
And perhaps there is bleeding, and the indentation in the broken bone becomes apparent to the senses. Its treatment involves the patient lying on his back with a cushion placed under his shoulders, then pressing his armpits and gathering the ribs from both sides with the hands, carefully aligning them as much as possible.
Until the shape of the bone returns as it should, then apply bandages and straps, and place a splint made from a light piece of lime wood or willow or something similar in lightness after wrapping it in cloth. Then be careful in securing it to the broken bone so that it does not shift, pass the bandage around its circumference to the back several times and tighten it firmly, then check the bandage at all times, and whenever it loosens, tighten it again.
And if the necessity arises to remove it when eating occurs in the area or pain or swelling appears, then quickly remove it and take off the bandage, and treat whatever has occurred appropriately, then replace the bandage if you deem it necessary. And apply it firmly until he is healed.
Chapter Eight.
On the treatment of broken ribs. Know that fractures in the ribs occur mainly in the thick parts near the back, and at their ends from the front they are subject to bruising because they are cartilaginous; this is apparent to the senses when examined with the fingers.
To treat them, align the fracture with the fingers in the best possible manner until the shape is correct, then bandage and secure the broken rib with a splint if necessary. If the ribs are fractured and inclined inward, it often causes severe pain to the patient.
And we probe as in the case of a bursectomy, because the bone may perforate the membrane, and also causes difficulty in breathing, coughing, and spitting out much blood; this is difficult to treat. The early practitioners resorted to many ingenious methods for it.
Some say that the patient's diet should be such as to generate gas and flatulence, causing the abdomen to swell and expand, thus forcing the hernia outward. We dislike this approach for fear that it might confirm the development of a hot swelling; if one has not yet occurred, it may induce its formation, and if it already exists, it will exacerbate and solidify it.
Some say that a leech should be applied to the affected area and then suckled vigorously, which seems more reasonable by measure; however, there is fear that the weak condition of the area might cause the leech to draw in impurities. Others say that the area should be covered with wool soaked in hot oil.
It becomes necessary to pad the area between the ribs until it is full, so that when the bandage is wrapped around, it lies flat. Then, the patient should be treated for bursectomy with diet and medication; if the treatment is severe, the patient may find it difficult to endure. And when the bone perforates the membrane in a harmful way, and we are concerned for the patient, it is necessary to incise the area and expose the broken rib, then place under it the instrument that preserves the intestines as previously described, and carefully cut and remove the bone.
Then, if the wound is large, we suture its edges and treat it with ointments until it heals. If a hot swelling occurs during this period, immediately apply bandages soaked in rose oil to the area and also treat the patient internally with remedies that reduce the swelling.
He should lie on the side where sleep is less uncomfortable until he recovers.
Chapter Nine.
On the Repair of Spinal and Neck Pearls.
As for the bones of the neck, if they are fractured, which is rare, but more often they suffer contusion; likewise, the vertebrae of the spine. If such an injury occurs and you wish to determine whether recovery is possible or not. Examine them; if you notice that his hands are relaxed, numb, and lifeless, unable to move, extend, or grasp anything, and if pricking them with a needle causes no sensation or pain, then know that recovery is unlikely in most cases, and he is doomed.
However, if he can move them and feels the prick or needle test, then know that the spinal cord is safe and the patient will recover with treatment. If a similar injury affects the vertebrae of the spine and you wish to determine whether recovery is also possible.
Examine his legs; if you see that they are relaxed and have experienced the same condition as the hands, and when he lies on his back, gas and feces are expelled involuntarily, and when he lies on his stomach, urine is expelled involuntarily. And if he lies on his back and is unable to urinate when he wishes to, then know that he is doomed; do not waste your efforts on treating him. If none of this occurs, the situation is less severe. The treatment for such conditions involves attempting to soothe the hot swelling.
Place rose oil alone or with baked slices of egg yolks on the injured vertebra. Do this three times a day until the hot swelling subsides, then apply one of the strengthening and drying dressings to the area, secure it with a bandage, and instruct the patient to rest and remain still.
He must not sleep on the side where he feels pain until he is healed; if a fragment of bone or something else has become dislodged due to the injury, you should cut the skin and remove that piece of bone. Then, if the wound is large, sew together the edges of the wound and treat it with healing ointments until it heals. If the last bone of the coccyx (tailbone) is fractured, you should insert your left thumb into the coccyx.
Align the broken bone with the other hand as best you can, then apply a bandage or cast if necessary and secure it.
If you feel a fragment of broken bone, cut through it and remove the fragment, then treat the wound as previously described until it heals.
Chapter Ten.
On the Treatment of a Fractured Hip.
Hip bones rarely break, but if they do, the fracture will involve fragmentation at the ends, longitudinal splitting, and tilting inward. This results in pain at the site of the injury, limping, and numbness in the affected leg.
He should be treated by your hand passing over him until you locate the fracture and understand its shape. If the fracture is only at the ends, then smooth that fracture as best you can so that it resembles its natural shape.
If the fracture is longitudinal or has shifted inward, lay the patient on their stomach so you can set the fracture. Once it is smoothed out, wrap it with a bandage and then apply a splint made of wood or leather, securing it tightly.
Do not fear the displacement of the fracture or the loosening of the splint. Even out the hollows with padding so that the pressure is even, and instruct the patient to sleep on their back or on their healthy side. If a hot swelling occurs,
Stop extending and setting it until the hot swelling subsides, then apply what is necessary to reduce the swelling as previously described. Then return to setting and securing it appropriately. If there are fragments or small pieces broken off at the ends of the bone, they should not be removed.
Do not disturb it; instead, smooth it from the outside as we have said and leave it undisturbed until it heals.
Chapter Eleven.
On the Treatment of Fractures of the Humerus.
The humerus is what lies between the elbow and the top of the shoulder. If it fractures, treat it in one of two ways. The first way is to take a curved, smooth stick of moderate thickness as shown in this illustration:.
It is tied at both ends with straps, then it is hung from a high place, and the patient sits on a chair. Then his broken arm is placed on the splint until his armpit is attached in the middle of the curve of the splint, then something heavy is suspended above him.
Or a servant extends him downward, then the doctor sets the fracture with his hands until the fracture is properly aligned. The other method is for the patient to lie face down and his hand is suspended from his neck with a strap.
Then order two servants to hold the part above the fracture with their hands, and the other to hold below it. Each one should pull in his direction. If you want the pulling to be stronger, tie a strap under the fracture and another above it, and each servant should pull in his direction.
If the fracture is near the shoulder end, it is necessary for the middle of the strap to be under the armpit and the other part under the fracture towards the elbow. Similarly, if the fracture is close to the elbow, it should be positioned on that place and on the elbow itself.
Then align the fracture gently without violence until the fracture is properly aligned and well united. If there is no inflammation, then it should be secured; if there is inflammation, leave securing it until the seventh day. Place a soft woolen pad soaked in vinegar and rose oil on it.
When the inflammation subsides, then secure it. The method of securing it is to apply a bandage on the fracture, then wrap a new cloth strip over the bandage, and gather the arm at its own joint, placing his hand open on his shoulder.
The wound and bandage should be applied to the shoulder and arm so that the arm serves as a splint if nothing prevents you from doing so, and if there is no change in the broken bone. If you fear that something may change, then use splints.
You should place a splint directly over the break that is wider and stronger than other splints, and there should be the width of a finger between each splint. The length of the splints should be according to the break, with an additional three fingers' width on each side.
Then apply the binding method mentioned at the beginning of the chapter to the splints.
It should be that your binding over the site of the fracture is tighter.
The binding should be less tight as it moves away from the fracture. If you see that placing the splints and binding them as described should be done immediately when setting the bone, then do so.
If you fear the onset of a hot swelling, leave the binding and splints until the seventh day as we said. Then check the ligature every three days to ensure there is no itching, swelling, or obstruction of nutrition reaching the limb due to excessive tightness, and adjust it as described.
If you are certain that none of these issues will occur, do not loosen the ligature except after many days. The patient should lie on their back with their hand on their stomach, and under the armpit, place a cushion filled with wool and adjusted properly.
Check at all times, whether day or night, to ensure that the shape of the broken limb does not become distorted or that the ligature does not loosen. Correct any issues as needed. Ensure the patient's diet is moderate as previously mentioned; initially, it should be light so that when the bone begins to heal and strengthen, the diet can be adjusted accordingly.
He should have a thick diet. It is customary for the arm and leg to become firm in forty days, so at that time it should be opened up, he should use the bath, and be treated with ointments suitable for this purpose. If the fracture is severe and shattered,
Do not remove the bandage from him for fifty days or even two months.
The twelfth chapter.
On the Healing of a Fractured Arm.
The arm is composed of two bones, known as the ulna and the radius. One is small and lies next to the thumb, while the other is larger and is situated below the smaller one at the bottom. It may happen that only the larger bone (ulna) breaks, or only the smaller one (radius) breaks, or both break simultaneously.
When the upper smaller bone (radius) breaks, setting it is easy and healing occurs more quickly. When the lower bone breaks, the fracture is poor and healing is difficult. The worst case is when both bones break simultaneously. If it is the bone where the upper smaller bone has broken,
The physician should, when setting it, make the extension slight and gently until it is even. If the larger bone (ulna) is broken, a stronger extension should be made. If both bones are broken, an extremely strong extension should be made.
And when setting and extending the arm, the hand should be placed in a position as if it were resting on a cushion with the thumb raised higher than all the other fingers, and the little finger lower than the rest. The patient should sit comfortably with legs crossed.
Let the cushion be at his level in height so that the patient does not strain himself.
Then a servant extends the arm from below, either with his hand or with a strap, and another servant extends it from above in the same manner. Then the doctor aligns the bone until he returns it to the best possible form; if there are fragments in the broken bone, they are removed.
Place each fragment in its place to the best of your ability. If a free-floating shard appears and is pressing against the skin, with no hope of setting it, then cut around it and remove it as described previously. If the fracture is accompanied by a wound, I have dedicated a section to it separately.
You can find the treatment for this in that section. If a hot swelling appears at the beginning of setting the fracture, apply a bandage made of qirwati fabric worked with rose oil and white wax; it should be moderate between thickness and thinness, and tighten the bandage gently until the swelling subsides.
Remove the qirwati and apply the prepared bandage made of flour dust mixed with egg white. Then place the splints, and let the splint that is placed directly on the fracture be slightly wider and stronger. Know that in most cases, the number of splints for an arm is six.
Whether the fracture is in one ulna or both, make your bandaging tighter and stronger at the site of the fracture. Whenever you wrap around above or below, make the wrapping looser as mentioned earlier at the beginning of the chapter.
Let the bandage that wraps around the fracture be soft and moist, not too hard. Let the thread used to secure it be of linen, moderate between thinness and thickness as described. Examine the limb and ligaments after a few days.
If something needs to be corrected, such as itching that occurs in the organ, it is necessary to immerse the organ in warm water until the itching subsides and then leave the organ unstrained for a night so that it can rest, and then resume the straining.
If the straining has loosened and the bone has shifted or something similar, repair all of this to the best of your ability. Also check if the nourishment is unable to reach the organ due to excessive straining; in such a case, you should loosen it slightly and leave it for days until the nourishment reaches it, then tighten it again.
If none of the issues we have mentioned occur to the patient, it is not appropriate to release him until after twenty days or so. Then, attach the patient's hand to his neck and keep his arm level, guard against erratic movements with his effort, and make sure his sleep is on his back.
Know that this fracture of the arm is set in thirty days, or in thirty-two, and it may be set in twenty-eight days, all depending on the conditions of temperaments and strength.
Chapter Thirteen.
On the Setting of Fractures of the Hand and Fingers.
Fractures of the metacarpus and phalanges are rarely encountered, whereas contusions are common. When a fracture or contusion occurs to the hand.
The patient should sit cross-legged with an even chair in front of him.
Then he places his hand on it stretched out, then the servant extends the broken bones and the physician aligns them until they fit well together. At that point, the bandage and splint should be applied if no hot swelling has occurred, then a splint is placed from above according to the position needed.
I have wrapped it in a soft piece of cloth. If the fracture is toward the palm, make something like a ball out of cloth and instruct the patient to grasp it with their injured hand, then secure it with a long bandage.
Let the splint be made of leather that is flexible so that the skin conforms to the curvature of the entire hand, and secure it as appropriate. If the fracture is towards the outside, then place one splint from above and another from below on the hand so that the hand remains open and upright.
Then apply the bandage as the hand is wrapped and tie between the fingers with a ligature. If the fracture occurs at one of the phalanges, especially if it is the thumb, align it properly and then secure it with the hand. If you prefer, you may make a small separate splint to keep the fracture in place.
Do not move it. If the fracture is in any of the other fingers such as the middle finger, ring finger, or little finger, align them and secure them with the adjacent healthy finger or secure all of them together, which is better, or place a small separate splint on them.
As we said for the thumb, check during and after setting it for any hot swelling. Address it appropriately as described previously if anything occurs.
Chapter Fourteen.
In the repair of a fractured thigh.
The thigh bone is often fractured and can be easily detected because it moves forward and backward. Its reduction is done by tying a bandage above the fracture and another below it, with the patient lying face up.
Then each bandage is stretched by an assistant on either side with moderation. This is done if the fracture is in the middle of the bone, but if it is near the base of the thigh, a soft bandage, such as wool or something similar, should be applied.
Near the base of the thigh towards the groin so that the extension goes upwards, and the other bandage below the fracture. Similarly, if the fracture is near the knee, the bandage should be near the knee so that the extension goes downwards. Then, the physician should straighten the bone with both hands until it returns to its natural form.
The bone will heal well; therefore, it is necessary to maintain the bandages and compression unless a hot swelling occurs in the limb. If such a swelling does occur, leave it for several days until the swelling subsides, then return to treating it.
As for the compression, a wide and solid bandage should be wound around the fracture two or three times, leaving some excess. Then wind the leg so that the heel is at the top of the calf. Pass a long thread between the thigh and the leg near the knee from below, with both ends of the thread coming out above.
Then wind the remaining bandage around the leg and thigh. Place splints on the thigh at the location of the fracture, and one splint on the bone of the leg. Then stuff the space between the thigh and leg with soft cloths to ensure even compression.
Then start with a strong binding from the middle at the site of the fracture, three or four turns, and as you move the bandage away from the site of the fracture, make your binding less tight and softer.
Then take the ends of the thread that you inserted between the thigh and the leg, and tie it to the splints above it. Then pass the ends of the thread downward until you reach the heel of the foot, and also tie them to the splints on the other side.
To prevent the bandage from shifting from its place, leave it tied as long as there is no discoloration, swelling, or puffiness in the limb. If any of these occur, promptly loosen it and repair everything that has happened as we have mentioned repeatedly.
If there is a sharp fragment of bone causing irritation, it should be smoothed if possible; otherwise, make an incision and remove it, then treat the wound as previously described until it heals. This fracture may also be bound from the thigh without adding the leg with splints.
As we mentioned for the forearm and arm, binding it this way does not cause the patient to limp. However, if you bind it alone without adding the leg, the patient will inevitably limp forever.
Know that the thigh takes fifty days to heal, or a little more or less, depending on differences in temperament and other conditions.
Chapter Fifteen.
On the Fracture of the Patella.
The knee joint is rarely fractured, but contusion occurs frequently. If a fracture does occur, it may be either a split or fragmentation of its parts, and this can happen with or without a wound.
You can determine all of this by touch. To treat it, align the separated parts with your fingers until they come together properly and fit well, then apply bandages and a circular splint if necessary.
Secure it from above at the appropriate tension, then care for all conditions as described for other fractures, such as applying a warm poultice and similar treatments. Address each symptom appropriately until healing is complete.
Chapter Sixteen.
On the Treatment of a Fractured Leg.
The leg has two bones: one is thick and is called the thigh bone, and the other is slender and is called the tibia. Both can suffer fractures similar to those that affect the bones of the arm. Therefore, treating it is like treating the arm, and the method is the same. If both bones are broken, the leg will be displaced in all directions. If only the thinner bone is broken, the leg will be displaced forward. If only the thicker bone is broken, especially from below, this should be evident to you.
Use traction and alignment, and bind the splints accordingly. However, if the fracture of the leg is severe with many fragments, the traction should be gentler, and you must handle it with care in setting the bones.
In the leg, there is something additional to do compared to the arm. When you have finished all your work and set the splints, take two handfuls of pine wood shavings that are used for smoothing floors between board cracks or can be made from date palm leaves or similar material.
Choose pieces that are slightly thick and not too thin, and let their length be from the knee to the bottom of the leg. Then wrap two layers of cloth along each piece, one on the side of the leg and the other on the opposite side.
From the knee to the bottom of the foot, then tie the two handfuls in three places at both ends and in the middle. This will prevent the leg from tilting sideways and will help it heal properly. A funnel made of wood can also be used along the length of the leg.
It should be placed to keep it from moving, especially when there is a wound with the fracture. Then check the leg every day and take extreme care to monitor for swelling or any other issues. If any of those symptoms occur, counter them appropriately until they heal. The bone in the leg takes about thirty days or so to heal.
Chapter Seventeen.
On Fractures of the Leg Bones and Fingers.
As for the heel, it never breaks. As for the leg bones, they can break, but fingers rarely break; in most cases, they suffer contusions.
If a man's bones are fractured and you see that the bones are protruding against each other, let the patient stand on his foot upright as if he were walking, then place your foot on what has risen of those bones and press them down and smooth them.
Until they return to their proper places, then take the bandage and splint; place a small piece with flat ends underneath the sole of the foot, then bind the foot tightly after wrapping it with cloth and all other necessary materials.
After three or four days, loosen the ligature; you will find the bones level whether they were broken or disjointed. The treatment is as described. As for a finger that is fractured, set it and smooth it as I have described for setting fingers of the hand.
Then make a splint for the broken finger that runs along its length, and let it be slightly wider than the finger. Place the piece of wood under the foot as described and bind it securely. If two, three, or more bones are fractured.
Make a splint for each finger, wrapped in soft cloth. Secure the piece of wood at the bottom of the foot so that each end of the wood extends slightly beyond the arch of the foot to hold it firmly in place.
You should not forget to attend to all the points we have mentioned regarding other fractures and their symptoms, and treat each symptom as appropriate.
Chapter Eighteen.
On the fracture of a woman's pubic bone and the man's pubis.
When a woman's vagina is broken, seat her in a squatting position, then gradually bend her towards her back little by little. Then hold her from behind. The midwife should stuff her vagina with cotton until it is full and becomes like a ball inside her vagina.
Then shake the woman and gradually raise her hips little by little. The cotton will come out until it is at the entrance of the vagina, like a ball. This will help heal the broken bone. Then place a pad on her back. When she needs to urinate, gently remove the cotton so that she can urinate.
Replace the cotton as you initially inserted it, then return to her original pad. Do this for seven days or so, and the injury will heal. If you wish, you can take a sheep's bladder, secure an air tube to its mouth, and insert the entire bladder into her vagina.
Then blow into the tube with force until the bladder inflates inside the vagina, as this will help reset the fracture. Then stuff it with cotton and keep her on this treatment for several days until she heals. As for when the pubic bone of a man or woman is fractured, use these methods to set it.
And smoothing it out is as described for the hip bone. The correct approach for these rare fractures, which seldom occur, will not be hidden from you, especially if you have some experience and understand this book well. Indeed, the fracture itself often guides you in most cases.
Follow the correct method for setting and securing it, so understand well. As for a man when his penis is fractured, insert the neck of a goose into it, then wrap it with a bandage and secure it. Leave it like this for three days or so until it heals.
Chapter Nineteen.
In the treatment of bone fractures when there is an accompanying wound.
It is advisable for one who encounters a fracture accompanied by a wound, especially if the bone is large such as the femur or humerus or similar, to proceed promptly and extract it if the conditions for extraction assist you, as we have previously mentioned.
If the wound is bleeding, it is advisable to proceed by applying a powdered styptic agent if nothing else is available. Then, proceed with setting the fracture on that same day and do not delay it.
If no hot swelling occurs, then if a hot swelling does occur, wait until the ninth day to set it after the hot swelling subsides. Do not approach it on the third and fourth days at all, for doing so would expose you to不良翻译部分请忽略，只需提供：“若未出现热肿，则待至第九日，使热肿消退后再行处理。切勿在第三、四天靠近它，否则会引发不良后果。”
If the broken bone is protruding on the skin and exposed, it is advisable to gently attempt to push it back and smooth it with your hands in a mild manner. If you are unable to do so with your hands, use an instrument made of iron that is about seven or eight finger lengths long to push it back. And adjust its size according to the wound.
Therefore, it is advisable for the physician to prepare three or four of these instruments, depending on what is needed for treatment in each type of fracture. They should be rounded with a slight thickness so that they do not bend when pressure is applied during work.
It should be sharp at the end with a curve at its tip, and it should be thicker at the top and much thinner from the middle to the bottom. This is its shape:.
It is called in Greek "perne," meaning a small lever. Its sharp curved end should fit onto the head of the fractured bone, and it should be used to push the bone back into place gradually until the bone realigns somewhat, after which the edges of the fracture are smoothed out against each other.
If the broken end of the bone is thin and cannot be adequately grasped by the instrument, it should be cut so that the instrument can grasp it properly. If you are unable to realign the bone as described at all, then cut it accordingly with one of the methods mentioned.
Or smooth it with a file as much as possible, then scrape away any roughness or thin layers from the bone. When you have realigned the bone and if the patient experiences severe painful discomfort after realignment, know that the bone has not returned to its natural position.
If you are able to realign it to its natural position, do so, for you will greatly benefit the patient. When you have completed setting the bone, dip a cloth in a constricting black lotion, especially if it is summer, and do not apply any dressings containing oil to the wound.
To prevent it from becoming rotten and corrupt, then apply splints after you have set the bone, and leave the wound exposed by cutting a hole in the bandages with scissors to the size of the wound.
Beware above all of tightening the wound with the fracture, for ignorant surgeons often do this and thereby cause either death or consumption or catarrh to their patients. Let your bandaging be loose and slack, contrary to how you would bind other fractures.
If the wound is poor or it is a large wound and you fear some of the bad symptoms we have described, and if he feels distressing pain in the area, then you should not apply splints. Instead, make firm bandages from cloth where the splints would be placed and secure them tightly.
If after one or two days you see that the wound has begun to generate pus, then remove the bandage that was placed on it by soaking it. Then use dressings and ointments that we typically use to treat wounds, such as the quadruple ointment and similar remedies, and you should loosen the binding.
Examine the wound every morning and evening until it heals and becomes healthy. It is advisable to elevate the limb so that the pus can easily drain downward. If many days have passed and the wound has not healed nor has the discharge stopped, then know that there are small bone fragments present.
You should examine the wound with a probe. If any of those fragments are loose, remove and extract them. If they are not loose and cause irritation and pain to the limb, cut and remove them in whatever way is possible.
If the wound develops catarrh, consumption, or any other kind of corruption and putrefaction, then you should treat each condition with the appropriate remedy as described earlier in its respective section.
And among the things you should note and keep in mind when a large bone is broken and you are on the limb, such as the thigh bone or the upper arm bone and similar large limbs, do not attempt to pull it out or extract it. Often, that leads to death; therefore, leave it as is until it becomes gangrenous, for it may fall off on its own after twenty or thirty days.
Then treat the wound if you see room for treatment; otherwise, leave it alone.
Chapter Twenty.
On the Treatment of Complications That May Occur After Some Fractures.
This complication often occurs after the fracture has healed, especially near the joints, disfiguring the appearance of the limb and sometimes preventing it from performing its natural function.
If you examine the complication and find it soft, use astringent medicines such as wormwood, frankincense, rue, costus root, and other similar substances. Take some or all of these and mix them with an astringent decoction, egg white, or vinegar.
Apply it to the complication with effort and bind it tightly, leaving it bound for many days without loosening it. Then loosen it and repeat with another treatment until the complication subsides, God willing; or you can bind a sheet of lead tightly over it.
Lead has the property of removing everything that festers in the limbs. If the complication has hardened and become severe, and it is necessary to remove it, make an incision at its upper part and cut away the protruding parts or strip them off with some sharp instrument until they are removed, then treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-One.
في علاج الكسر إذا أُنجبِر وبقى العضو بعد ذلك رقيقًا على غير طبعته الأولى.
إذا أُنجبِر كسر العظام وبقى العضو بعد ذلك رقيقًا ضعيفًا، فإنه يكون ذلك لأسباب كثيرة. أحدها إما لكثرة حل الرباطات وربطها على غير ما ينبغى، وإما لإفراط شد الرباطات حتى امتنع الغذاء أن يسري إلى العضو، وإما لكثرة التنطيل المفرط، وإما لحركات مفرطة في غير وقتها، وإما لقلة الدم في جسد العليل وضعفه.
وعلاج ذلك تغذية المريض وتخصيب بدنه حتى يكثر الدم فيه واستعمال الحمام وإدخال السرور عليه والفرح ونحو ذلك، ثم تحمل الزفت على العضو ليجذب الزفت عليه غذاء كثيرا أو يدام تنطيله بالماء الفاتر. حتى يجري الغذاء فيه ويعود إلى شكله الطبيعي.
Chapter Twenty-Two.
في علاج العظام المكسورة إذا أُنجبِرت متعوجة ومنعت فعْلها على ما ينبغي.
فمتى عرض لعضو قد جُبِر بعد بريه إعوجاج أو نتوء للعظم المكسور أو تعقد وقبحت لذلك صورة العضو. Except that the organ has not ceased to perform its natural function, it is not appropriate to accept the claim that the organ should be broken from the root; and many ignorant doctors and bone setters used to do this in our country.
This action is highly reprehensible and leads to great risks, even causing damage easily. However, if the deformity and constriction are soft, it should be treated with water in which relaxing herbs have been boiled, such as fenugreek leaves and roots, chamomile, and similar substances.
It should be dressed with relaxing poultices such as well-made diachylon, or take the saliva of the fenugreek plant and mix it with chicken fat and butter, then dress with it. Alternatively, take fatty figs and pound them with pigeon droppings and similar medications that are called ulcer-breaking remedies.
The constriction should be loosened by constant gentle massage with the hands, and the movement of the limb in all directions at all times should be employed. If the deformity has become severe and hardened, and there is a necessity to treat it with iron.
It is necessary to incise it from above, release the connection of the bone, and cut any excess constriction or bone with fine scissors, using caution and effort. Then treat the wound as previously described until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Three.
Dislocation is the displacement of a joint from its normal position, which impedes movement, deforms the appearance of the limb, and causes severe pain to the patient. When it occurs in anyone, it is necessary to immediately proceed with reducing it back into place.
Do not delay it at all, for if delayed, the swelling in the area becomes severe and makes it difficult to reset the jaw. Therefore, it should not be delayed or moved when swollen, as this often causes cramping and painful spasms in the patient.
However, if this occurs, one should immediately lance the patient and then wait until the swelling subsides somewhat. Then, the affected part should be bathed with hot water and oil, and gently reset. Each part should be treated according to what is mentioned in its appropriate place.
I have also arranged the sections on the jaw in the same order as mentioned earlier for fractures, from top to bottom of the body.
Chapter Twenty-Four.
On the Treatment of the Lower Jaw.
Dislocation of the jaws is rare, and when it occurs, it happens in one of two ways: either they move slightly from their positions, resulting in some laxity, or they become completely dislocated, leading to significant laxity. Toward the chest, causing saliva to flow which the patient cannot control, and unable to close his jaws or articulate speech properly. If the dislocation is slight, it often returns on its own with minimal intervention in most cases.
If the dislocation is complete, it should be promptly reduced without delay. This involves one assistant holding the patient's head while the physician inserts their thumb into the base of the jaw inside the mouth if the dislocation is on one side.
He inserts all his fingers if both sides of the jaw are involved, and with the rest of his fingers from outside, he aligns them and instructs the patient to relax his jaw and move it to every side, while the doctor aligns the jaw and pushes it until it returns to its place.
If it is difficult to return it, especially if both jaws are involved, use hot compresses and ointment until they can be easily returned, do not delay their return at all as we said. When they have been returned and are aligned, and the patient's mouth closes without relaxing, then apply bandages made of cloths soaked in wax and ointment.
Then bind it gently with a loose bandage, and the patient should sleep on his back with his head elevated between two pillows so that he does not move left or right. He should not exert himself by chewing anything but should take soft liquid food.
Until the pain subsides and the jaw heals, he should eat whatever he wishes but do so gently. He must not strain to open his mouth when eating, drinking, or yawning until the jaw is fully healed and he has recovered.
If the jaws are difficult to return when they dislocate and do not move back to their proper positions, it often results in fevers, persistent headaches, and sometimes the patient's abdomen may become distended, or they may repeatedly vomit. If you see these symptoms, know that serious damage has occurred.
And many times, one may die from this condition within ten days.
Chapter Twenty-Five.
On separating the collarbone and the end of the shoulder.
As for the collarbone, it does not separate from the inside due to its connection to the chest, but it can separate outward and this can be perceived by touch. Its reduction is done by having the patient lie on his back and extend his arms.
Then press the area firmly with your hand; it will return to its place. Then apply bandages and splints and secure them. As for its end near the shoulder, which is connected to it, it rarely dislocates. If it does dislocate at some point, it should be reduced and aligned as mentioned and as you find appropriate.
Then apply bandages, splints, and secure them tightly. Instruct the patient to remain still and calm until they are healed. With this same treatment, you also reduce the end of the shoulder if it has moved from its place.
Chapter Twenty-Six.
On reducing the shoulder joint.
Know that the shoulder dislocates in three ways: one, it dislocates towards the armpit downwards; two, it dislocates toward the chest; and three, it may dislocate above the shoulder, which is rare.
It does not dislocate to the back due to the position of the shoulder blade, nor does it dislocate to the front due to the presence of a nerve. It most commonly dislocates and moves downward toward the armpit, especially in those with little flesh, as it can exit quickly and be reduced quickly in such cases.
As for those whose flesh is abundant, it is different; I mean that it comes out with difficulty and goes in with difficulty. And sometimes some people receive a blow or fall, causing the shoulder to swell and become hot, so they think it has dislocated. It should be examined to determine its condition.
At that time, proceed with its treatment. You will recognize the dislocated jaw if it is pointing downwards towards the armpit; when you align the dislocated shoulder with the healthy one, you will find a noticeable difference between them. You will feel the head of the shoulder as being hollowed out, and under the armpit upon touch, the head of the shoulder feels like an egg.
The patient is unable to raise his hand to his ear or to move it in all directions. Similarly, if it dislocates towards the chest or upwards, you will find this apparent upon touch and not hidden.
This dislocated shoulder can be easily reduced if the flesh is soft or if the patient is a child. To reduce it, have an assistant raise their hand upwards, then place your thumbs under the armpit and lift the joint forcefully upwards to its proper position, while the assistant raises their arm above.
Then let it drop downwards, and it will quickly return. If it does not return as mentioned above and the dislocation has been there for many days, the patient should bathe in hot water and use relaxing treatments that soften and loosen, such as cooking the base of a pig's small intestine, fenugreek, and lavender in water to apply.
Then the patient should lie on their back, and place a ball of wool under the armpit that is moderate between softness and firmness. The physician then places the heel of the patient's hand on the ball and holds the arm with his own hand, extending it downwards.
He pushes the ball with his foot, and he returns to his position. And if you wish, return him in this manner: have a man taller than the patient stand by his side, and place his shoulder under the armpit of the patient and lift his armpit upwards until the patient is suspended in the air. Another servant pulls the patient's hand down to his abdomen. If the patient is light, it is necessary to hang something on him to make him heavier; then the jaw will immediately return. It may also be returned in another manner.
It is done by fixing a long piece of wood in the ground, with its top rounded like the head of a mortar, neither too thick nor too thin. Then place it under the patient's armpit after putting a soft cloth on top of the wooden piece. The patient stands along the length of the wood.
Then extend his hand downward from the other side and also stretch his body strongly from that side; the joint will quickly return to its place. If it is difficult to return it with all the methods mentioned, use this treatment: take a piece of wood about two cubits long. Its width is about four fingers, and its thickness is about two fingers. It should have a rounded head to make it easy to insert into the armpit's depth as shown in this illustration:.
Then wrap a soft cloth around the rounded head to prevent the wood from harming the patient. Place it under the armpit, extend the entire hand and arm down along the wood, and secure the wood to the shoulder, forearm, and hand tip.
Then place the arm on a crossbeam. Lean on the beam and extend the hand downward while leaving the rest of the body suspended from the other side; the joint will enter immediately. Once it has entered in whatever manner possible, it is necessary to place under the armpit a moderate-sized ball of wool.
Then the prepared bandage, made from dust of the millstone mixed with mastic and egg white, is applied all over the shoulder as it rotates from above. Then the ball is tightly bound under the armpit and secured with a strap over the bandage from above, and his hand is tied to his neck.
He should not move his hand for seven days, and it is advisable to give the patient a small amount of food until the part becomes stronger, as this will speed up its healing. Then after seven or five days, release him and train him with movements; if he stabilizes and does not become weak, then he has healed.
If the joint frequently dislocates due to moisture exposure or another condition, it is advisable to use cauterization with three sulfur applications as previously described in the section on cauterization. If you have done all of this and released the bandage after seven days but the joint remains unstable.
And if you reapply the bandage and binding repeatedly but it remains unstable, and it falls loose and cannot be raised above, then know that the nerve in the shoulder joint has been severed or stretched or weakened. At this point, understand that the joint will never remain stable in its place.
As for the jaw that is towards the chest and breast and to the back, its correction is by pushing and pulling with the hands until it returns to place, and all binding and treatment should be used until it heals. If after healing there is stiffness in the part and slowness in movement.
Let the patient use the bath frequently until that stiffness softens and returns to its original nature.
Chapter Twenty-Seven.
On the Treatment of Dislocated Elbow.
The elbow joint dislocates with difficulty, and it also returns with difficulty. It can dislocate in all directions, but especially forward or backward. Its reduction is not hidden from you because its condition is visible to the eye and palpable, showing how it has become dislocated.
If you compare the dislocated elbow with the healthy one, it becomes clearly apparent by the deformity of the joint. It is unable to bend and cannot be touched by the shoulder. You should act promptly and reduce the dislocation immediately before inflammation sets in.
If inflammation sets in, it becomes difficult to reduce the dislocation, and it may never heal properly. Especially if the elbow is dislocated backward, it is the worst of all types of dislocations, causing severe pain and often leading to death.
If the dislocation can be reduced, have a helper extend both his arms with his hands outstretched. The physician should place his hands above and below the elbow, using his thumbs or the base of his hand to push the joint back into its proper position.
If the dislocation is forward, it may be reduced by bending the hand once and striking the base of the palm against the shoulder. If this does not work, use a very strong extension method where two helpers extend the arm.
The patient should also be held by two helpers to prevent movement during the extension. Then, after wrapping a folded cloth or a wide piece of fabric around the arm, if the physician handles the joint with his hands, he should smear it with oil to facilitate easy manipulation of the joint.
Then push the joint forcefully until it returns, and after its return, it is necessary to bind it with a bandage that contains constricting and drying ingredients along with egg white, and tighten it firmly; suspend the arm from the patient's neck and leave it for several days.
Then release it; if the joint remains in its place, release the ligature and leave it. If you see that the joint has not become firm, reapply the bandage and ligature and leave it for several days until it becomes firm, then release it. If hardness occurs after the return of the joint and its release.
If movement is difficult, then use moisturizing in the bath, gentle massage, and tapping until it becomes soft; or place a thick bladder of a fat ram on the joint, then bind it and leave it for a day and night, then remove it and have him enter the bath. When he sweats, gently rub the joint.
Then repeat the bladder application once, twice, and three times with entry into the bath until it becomes soft. If you wish to place moistened oxhair mixed with fat on it and bind it tightly, do this repeatedly; it will soften and return to its original condition.
Chapter Twenty-Eight.
On the Treatment of the Wrist Joint.
The wrist often becomes dislocated, and reducing its joint is easier than other joints, except that it is necessary to reduce the joint immediately when it becomes dislocated before it settles in place or inflammation with heat occurs.
Place the patient's wrist on a board, and have a servant extend his hand. The doctor places his hand on the protruding joint and pushes it until it returns, but it is necessary to check if the jaw has moved towards the palm of the hand.
Let the patient place the back of his hand on the board during the pulling and pushing. If the jaw protrudes towards the back of the hand, let him place the palm of his hand on the board so that the doctor's hand falls on the same joint protrusion. If it returns immediately, otherwise bind it with a bandage to reduce swelling.
Leave it alone and do not attempt to treat it again, for it cannot tolerate further intervention. You will not be able to return it after a few days unless the joint remains in its place without causing harm to the patient, except if the hand relaxes and is unable to grasp anything.
At that moment, you will know that the nerve has been severed or damaged, for there is no remedy except to treat it with cauterization; perhaps this may help, but it often provides no benefit. Once the wrist has been returned, apply the bandage as described and secure it. Leave it for five days.
Then remove the bandage and train the hand. If its movement is difficult and stiffness appears, soften it with warm water and massage repeatedly until it becomes supple.
Chapter Twenty-Nine.
On the Treatment of Finger Joints.
Fingers may dislocate in any direction. When a finger dislocates towards the back of the hand or its palm, extend the finger and push the joint with your thumb until it returns, then secure the tip of the finger and suspend it towards the direction it dislocated.
Leave it for two days, then loosen it and extend it until it stands straight on its third day. At night, bind it in the same manner again. Continue to release it during the day and train it with movement, while binding it at night. Repeat this process for several days until it becomes strong.
And do the same if it becomes detached towards the palm of the hand; bind it towards the same direction and proceed as you did initially until it heals. Do this similarly whenever it becomes detached in any other directions.
Chapter Thirty.
On the Treatment of Dislocated Spinal Vertebrae.
When a complete dislocation occurs in one of the vertebrae of the spine or neck, or when many vertebrae are displaced from their positions, there is no treatment for it because death quickly befalls the patient.
The sign of this is that the patient's excrement comes out without control, and they are unable to hold it. Often, some of their limbs become weak, either their legs or arms, or one of them. And if a single vertebra is displaced from its position, it often leads to further displacement.
It can dislocate in four directions; if it moves backward, it is called a hump. As for its treatment, one must observe: If the hump occurred during childhood, there is no cure and it will never heal. However, if it resulted from a fall or blow or similar causes, that is different.
They have mentioned various treatments for it at length, but most of them do not yield much benefit. I have summarized what is essential from those treatments, keeping in mind the essence and explanation of these methods. I have also illustrated the instrument differently from how they described and explained it.
I say that the hunchback which occurs from the front in the chest has no remedy and cannot be cured. The same applies to those on both sides. However, the one that occurs in the back is treated specifically as I will describe, which is that the patient is laid face down.
Place the patient on a level desk near a wall, and spread a moist towel underneath him to prevent his chest from being hurt. Then place a vertical piece of wood embedded in a hole in the ground at one end of the desk near his head, and another vertical piece of wood at the other end near his feet.
A servant holds the wood, and it should not be securely fixed in the hole. Another servant holds the other piece of wood in place. Then wrap a soft but tight cloth around the patient's chest and under his armpits, and extend one end of the cloth to the piece of wood near his head and secure it there.
Then tie another cloth above his hips, above his knees, and at his ankles. Gather all the ties together and secure them to the other piece of wood near his feet. Then each servant pulls on the rope in their direction, ensuring that the pieces of wood remain fixed in their positions.
However, they are not securely fixed as we said. The doctor places his hands firmly on the knot until it returns or puts a board on it and leans on the board with his feet until it returns. If it does not return with this treatment, take a board that is about three cubits long.
And dig into the wall near the patient a place where the end of the board can be inserted. Then place the middle of the board on the hunchback, and have the doctor put his feet on the other end of the board and pull it tightly until the knot is pressed firmly.
And return to its place, and if you wish to make it with a spiral which is twisted by hand, then you should drive into the ground at the head of the patient near the end of the bed two pieces of wood whose length is an arm's length, and similarly two pieces of wood at his feet near the end of the bed.
And let there be one span between each piece of wood, and make a hole in each piece of wood through which the spiral will pass. Secure all the pieces of wood firmly in the ground so that they do not move at all, then insert a round stick, which is the spiral, into the holes of the two pieces of wood to twist the band around them.
And at one end, there is a hole in which a stick of one span in length is secured for twisting, and the same is done with the other two pieces of wood. Then tighten the band that was tightened around the patient's chest onto the spiral near his head, and the bands that were tightened around his legs onto the spiral near his feet.
Then a servant should stand by each spiral and twist it with his hand using the twisting tool, while the doctor adjusts the hump as previously described. This is an image of the spiral, the bed, and the patient:.
Then, after the vertebrae return to their place and the position is even, it is necessary to apply a bandage that has been dried with egg white, then cover it with a splint made of wood. The width of this splint should be three fingers or so, and its length should be as much as the space occupied by the hump.
And then place some correct small seeds, and bind it with the appropriate bandage. The patient should use gentle food until he recovers. If some hardness remains in the area after recovery, it is necessary to use medicines that soften and relax, along with using the described splint for a long time.
And a sheet of lead may be used for this purpose. And a lump may appear at the end of the vertebrae, and it is thought to be dislocation, but it could be an extra bone that has grown, so do not treat it with this method, or death may occur.
Chapter Thirty-One.
On the Treatment of Dislocated Hip.
Know that the hip joint and the shoulder joint are only subject to dislocation, and not to the slight displacement or subluxation that other joints may suffer. The hip joint can become dislocated in four ways.
This is because it can dislocate inward, outward, forward, and backward. It most commonly dislocates inward, while dislocation forward or backward is less common. The sign of dislocation inward is that when you align the healthy leg with the affected one, the affected leg appears longer.
The knee of the affected leg will protrude more than the healthy one, and the patient cannot bend their leg at the groin. The area near the groin will be swollen and visibly so, as the head of the femur has moved there.
And the sign of dislocation outward is the opposite of these symptoms. The sign of dislocation forward is that he can fully extend his leg, but he cannot bend it without pain. If he attempts to walk, he cannot do so forward.
He will also be unable to urinate, his groin will be tense, and when walking, he will walk on his heel. The sign of dislocation backward is that he cannot straighten his knee and must bend his hip before bending the knee. His leg will also be shorter than the other.
The armpit is relaxed, and the head of the thigh should be visible at the position of the side. As for dealing with various types of dislocation, observe: if the joint has been old and accustomed to its state by the patient and no attempt was made to reduce it, then there is no cure whatsoever.
It should not be exposed, and as for a recent dislocation of any type from the four aspects of dislocation, proceed to twist the joint and extend it inward and outward, move it right and left; perhaps.
It returns without needing any other treatment. If it does not return in this manner, then you should prepare a strong servant who can extend his leg from below, either with his hands or with a bandage tied above the knee, and another servant to assist him from above.
By inserting his hands under the patient's armpits, then securing a flexible bandage at the base of the thigh. Another servant holds the end of the bandage and extends it either from the front, from the armpit area to the collarbone area, or from behind to the back area.
They should all be extended at once until the patient lifts his body from the ground and remains suspended. This type of extension is common to the four types. If the joint returns as we said, otherwise, each type requires specific treatment that I mention.
As for its specific reduction if the joint is dislocated inward, the patient should lie on his healthy side, then place a bandage at the base of the thigh between the head of the femur and the position under the armpit.
Then extend the ligature upward from the armpit to the highest part of the body towards the collarbone. Then another strong servant, aided by his arms, should embrace the thick part of the affected thigh and pull it out very strongly, for it will return to its place.
This type is easier than other types of treatment for returning this organ to its place. If it becomes difficult for you and the patient absolutely refuses to undergo this type of treatment, then you should tie both legs of the patient with a strong but flexible bandage around the heels and knees.
Each should be about four finger breadths apart, and the affected leg should be extended more than the other by about two fingers' width. Then, suspend the patient from the top of his head to a beam in the house, with the distance between him and the ground being about two arm lengths.
Then order a strong servant to embrace the head of the thigh, and another servant should hold onto the patient. The other servant embracing the thigh should push with strength; then the joint will quickly return to its place. As for its specific reduction when it is displaced outward.
The patient should lie on the board as described for the case of kyphosis. Bind a bandage specifically around his affected leg and across his chest. Then place two boards, one at his feet and the other at his head. Finally, add an extra board in the middle of the bench, secured very tightly.
Wrap it with a wet cloth to prevent it from hurting the patient. Place the board between his thighs so that he does not pull downward when stretching. Then each servant pulls in his direction, and the doctor adjusts the hip with his hands; if it responds and returns.
And if not, place the board on it and press it as mentioned for the hunchback, except that the patient should lie on his healthy side. And if the dislocation is forward, then the patient's leg should be stretched once while he is in this description on the bench.
The doctor places the palm of his right hand on the diseased elbow, then presses it with the other hand, and at the same time makes the pressure extended downward toward the knee. If the dislocation is backward, it is not appropriate for the patient to be extended downward.
It should be elevated from the ground; it is necessary for it to be placed on a solid object, just as it should also be positioned from his nose and hip outward, according to how he lies face down on the bench with the straps tightened.
As we said before, and it is also necessary to use the board pressing on the place where the joint has come out. When the hip joint returns as it should, its return will not be hidden from you, and that is when you can extend the patient's leg.
When you see them level and the patient can draw up and extend the leg without difficulty, then know that the member has returned as it should. At that time, bring together the thighs and apply bandages, securing them tightly so that the hip does not move in any direction.
The patient must remain still for three or four days, then loosen the straps and bandages and measure the leg against the other. If you find them equal in length, know that the dislocation has stabilized; release the patient to walk. If you notice any slackness, [...]
Return and dress it, bind it as you did at first, and leave it for three days also. Then unbind it and walk on it slowly for several days until it strengthens, if God wills.
Chapter Twenty-Three.
On the Treatment of Dislocated Knees.
The knee dislocates in three directions: inward, outward, and downward, which means to the rear. It does not dislocate forward at all. The sign of its dislocation is that you instruct the patient to draw his leg up toward his thigh.
If it does not adhere to the thigh, then know that the knee is dislocated. To reduce all directions of its dislocation, have the patient sit with his legs extended if he can manage it, and place a servant behind him to grasp his waist and gently turn him backward slightly. Then sit on his thighs yourself.
Lean your back against his face and place his leg between yours. Then grasp his knee with your hands, interlocking your fingers around it, and press the sides of his knee firmly with your hands. Another servant should extend his leg until the knee returns to its proper position.
The sign of its return is that the leg will adhere to the thigh gently without being forced. Then dress it, bind the leg to the thigh, and wrap them both with a bandage for three or four days, then release them. He should not use it except for minimal walking for several days until it strengthens.
If it is difficult for you to return it as described, then use strong traction with the straps that I have previously described for treating the hip until it returns.
Chapter Thirty-Three.
On the Treatment of Dislocated Heels.
The heel may dislocate slightly or completely. Its dislocation can be either inward or outward, and the sign of its dislocation is that you will see the heel swollen and prominent in the direction it has dislocated towards.
As for the treatment of its slight displacement, it is easy to return it by gently stretching and aligning it until it returns to place. However, if it dislocates completely, it is advisable to have the patient sit down, and a strong servant should hold him firmly from behind at his waist.
Then, grasp his foot with your right hand above and with your left hand below at the heel. Then, pull the foot towards you with your right hand twice, then stretch it with your left hand while gently pushing the top of the foot toward the leg with your right hand without violence.
Do this twice as described, then in the third attempt, push the top of the foot towards the leg while pulling at the heel. If it returns after one or two attempts in this manner and you see that the foot is aligned, otherwise repeat the procedure, for it will return.
If it does not return as described, then have the patient lie down on his back on the ground. Drive a pole into the ground securely between his thighs and wrap cloth around it to prevent injury to the patient. Then, a servant should secure the patient's thigh.
Then, another servant should extend the leg either with his hands or by using a rope tied around the patient's neck. Both servants should pull in opposite directions while the pole remains between the patient’s thighs to prevent the body from being pulled downward during the extension. Finally, the physician will align the dislocation with his hands.
Another servant holds the healthy leg below, then the jaw will quickly return. When the jaw returns and you see that it has returned correctly, take the bandages and bind them tightly with cords, and secure the foot below with a cord. You should be cautious of the nerve that is above the heel from behind.
To avoid the bandage being too tight and causing him harm, leave it for two or three days. If the bandage loosens, retighten it, then release it on the third or fourth day. The patient must abstain from walking for forty days.
If he attempts to walk before this period, you cannot be sure that the jaw will not dislocate and become irreparable, and the treatment will no longer work. If a hot swelling occurs, you should use what we have previously described in other parts of the treatment and poultices until it subsides.
Chapter Thirty-Four.
On the Treatment of Dislocated Toes.
It is necessary to realign what has dislocated with a slight stretch without violence, as this is not difficult but rather easy. If the dislocation is in one of the joints on the back of the foot, the patient should place his foot on a flat surface of the ground.
Or on a board while he is standing as if walking, then place your foot on the dislocated joint and step down forcefully with your foot until it returns to its proper position and you see that it has aligned without any protrusions.
Then place a board under the sole of his foot that covers the entire foot and has two ends, then bind it tightly for three days. Then release it but keep him from walking for many days until it strengthens and you are assured there is no return to the dislocation, God willing.
Chapter Thirty-Six.
Concerning the types of suturing for wounds or fractures or both.
When any of these occur and one attempts to treat and repair them, it often leads to death.
Therefore, one should not attempt to treat such conditions except with great skill and long experience, being gentle, compassionate, cautious, neither rash nor bold. At the outset, only medicines that alleviate hot swellings should be used, and the patient should be left undisturbed.
With God's measure, except for what you hope will be safe from harm with a light illness and where some hope appears to you; then attempt to treat it immediately at the onset before the hot swelling occurs.
If the part returns as you intended, use methods to alleviate hot swellings and treat the wound with appropriate drying ointments. If the suturing is accompanied by a fracture and pieces of bone become dislodged, then proceed with removing them. And follow in this what we have mentioned regarding simple illnesses as described in their respective places.
Strive to your utmost and purify yourself from entering the path of risk, as I have previously advised you. This will preserve your reputation and safeguard your honor, if God wills.
