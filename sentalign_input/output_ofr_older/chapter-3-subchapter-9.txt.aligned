Sometimes fractures occur to the bones of the neck, and it rarely happens that they bend; and also to the spine. And when this happens to someone, and you want to know if they will be healed or not, watch if you see their hands softened and swollen and lifeless, and they cannot move or extend them, and when you prick them with a needle, they do not feel it. Know that this is mortal in many cases, and if they can move and feel well when squeezed and pricked, know that the joint of the bone is safe, and the patient can be cured if treated.	When a fracture occurs in the bones of the neck, which is rare, as mostly they suffer contusion, as do the spinal vertebraeâ€”when it happens to anyone and you want to know whether it will heal or not, then look and if you see both his hands relaxed and numb and dead and he has no power to move or stretch or close them, and when you pinch them or prick them with a needle he does not notice it or feel any pain in them, you may know, as a general rule, that it will not mend, for he is doomed. But if he moves them both and feels in them the pinching and pricking, you may know that the spinal medulla is still intact and that under treatment the patient will recover.	0.87395865
And if similar things happen to the spine, and you want to know if they will be healed or not, watch if the feet are softened, and if the same symptoms appear as in the hands, and if on the back there is wind and involuntary egestion; and when turned on their stomach, there is involuntary egestion. And when turned on their back and they try to sit up, they cannot. Know that this is mortal: do not work on their treatment.	If anything of this nature happens to the vertebrae of the back and you wish to know if he will recover or not, then pay attention to his feet. If you see them relaxed and in the situation we described in the case of the hands, and when he lies on his back he passes flatus and faeces involuntarily, and lying prone he passes water involuntarily and lying on his back he cannot pass water if he wishes, then you may know his case is hopeless, so do not concern yourself with his treatment.	0.7860719
And if these symptoms do not occur, the situation is lighter.	But if nothing of this kind occur then the case is easier.	0.6705421
And the treatment is that you observe if there is a hot abscess, then place rose oil or egg yolk oil on the spine until it is soothed; then apply one of the comforting and drying poultices, and bind it with a bandage, and instruct the patient to rest; and not to sleep on the side where they feel the pain, until they are healed. And if any bones are disjointed, then you need to cut above the heart; and remove the bone, then join the two lips of the wound if it is large, with a suture, then treat it with flesh-generating ointment, until it is healed; and if the head of the bone is broken, which is called the "head of the tail," then place your thumb of the left hand on it, and set it evenly with the other hand as much as you can, then apply the poultice and the splint if needed; then tighten it, and if there is a dislocated bone, cut above it, and remove it, and treat the wound until it is healed.	The way to treat this latter kind of case is to try to reduce the swelling by applying over the injured vertebra oil of roses, alone, or with roasted yolks of egg; apply three times a day until the swelling has gone down. Then apply to the place one of the strengthening and absorbent plasters and bind it on; bid him keep quiet and still and sleep only in the attitude in which he has no pain, until he is well. If the injury is accompanied by fragmentation or a separation of part of the bone, you must cut down on it and remove the bone; then bring together the edges of the opening, by suture if it be wide; then treat with granulating ointments until it heals. If the last bone of the coccyx, which is the sacrum of the tail, breaks, introduce the thumb of your left hand into his anus and reset the bone with the other hand in whatever way is possible and affords the best setting; then apply over it a plaster, and a splint if necessary, and bind it up.	0.8795656
