On the removal of Sebel from the eye.
Chapter 18.
Sebel are red veins that cover the eye and obstruct its vision: and they weaken the eye over time.
It is therefore necessary for you, first of all, to consider if the eye in which the Sebel is present is strong and has no other illness besides the Sebel: then remove its Sebel.
And instruct the patient to place his head in your lap.
Then raise those veins with one hook, or two, according to your judgment: and let the hook be fine and double-pointed, in this form, or let there be two hooks arranged on one body, in this form.
Then gather those veins delicately with fine scissors, and wipe away the blood from time to time, until you see those veins are removed from the eye, and they dissolve: and beware not to harm the eye with the tips of the spatumili.
Let your operation be at midday in the presence of sunlight, and be very steady in your work: so that you do not cut anything except those veins.
And when you are finished, then sprinkle the eye with green powder, or red, so that its sharpness may corrode what remains of the sebel.
If it is not possible for you to remove all of it in that time, then apply a plaster to the eye with something that soothes its pain: and leave it for several days, until its pain subsides and it is protected from a hot swelling: then repeat the procedure in the same way until it is healed.
And this is the form of the scissors.
