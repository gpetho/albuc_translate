Chapter Thirty-One
On the extraction of teeth and the removal of fractured jaw bones.
When after the extraction of a tooth that is broken some part remains, you must place cotton with alum on the site for a day or two until the site is softened; then introduce a tool or forceps whose ends are shaped like the beak of a bird called a stork or crane, the shape of the forceps:
Their ends should be made like a file or rasp inside.
And if it does not yield to you easily with these forceps or tongs, then you must dig around the root and uncover all the flesh and introduce the instrument called "atali," which is a small lever, the shape of which is this:
And it should have a short, thick end and not be soaked so that it does not break.
So if by this the root is extracted, it is good; if not, help yourself with these other instruments, the shapes of which are: the first instrument's shape is of a triangular end with some thickness:
The shape of the second instrument is that it should be triangular and with a finer end.
And already aided by this instrument having two prongs, of which this is the shape close to the following:
and with other instruments which are predecessors in the shaving of teeth; because aid is made with this instrument which is shaped like a large hook, and this is the shape:
of a triangular end bent or short, which has some thickness, and should not be soaked so it does not break.
And further know that the instruments for teeth are many and similarly the other instruments.
But the wise and subtle craftsman in the art finds for himself according to what the operation and the various diseases signify to him; because there are ailments for which the ancients did not speak nor placed proper instruments, due to their diverse shapes.
But if the jawbone or other bones of the mouth are broken or decayed, then care should be taken on that spot with the appropriate instruments and forceps we have mentioned in the extraction of the tooth roots, and help yourself with a tool of which this is the shape:
And it should have some thickness, little by little, and should be tightened or held with the mouth so it does not escape or flee until the entire bone is extracted; and then restore the site with appropriate medicines for that.
But if there is a small decay in the bone, then scrape that decay and its blackness, and treat it until it is healed.
