On the treatment of menâ€™s breasts which resemble those of women.	On the treatment of the male breast when it resembles the female.	0.84385324
Sometimes the breasts of some men swell due to the growth of hair as they begin to become hairy, and the breasts swell, resembling those of women, and remain abscessed, distant.	The breasts of some males may swell on attaining puberty so as to resemble the female breast, and they remain permanently swollen and ugly.	0.74020255
And for those who have this, it is necessary to cut them with a lunar incision in this form, from line .B. to line .G., then scrape all the thickness, then fill the wound with healing medication, then join the two lips of the wound with stitches, and treat it until it is healed.	If this is abhorrent, a semicircular incision should be made on the breast, like this figure, from b to g. Then dissect away all the fatty tissue and pack the wound with a cicatrizing compound and sew the lips together and dress until healed.	0.67230004
But if the breast sags downward and is softened due to its size, like that of women, then it should be split in two upper parts, with two cuts resembling a lunar shape, each containing the other at the end, so that the larger line contains the smaller one in this form from line .B. to line .G. Then scrape the skin between the two lips of the wound, remove the fat, and apply what we said about stitching and powders necessary for the healing until it is cured.	But if the breast is pendulous and flabby on account of its size, as happens with women, you should make two semicircular incisions on the upper side, the ends joining one another, in such wise that the longer incision encircles the other like this, from b to g. Then dissect away the skin between the two incisions and remove the fat and sew up as we have described; and apply styptic powder and the necessary dressings until healed.	0.860814
And if you cannot complete the incision because of the patient's restlessness and the blood flow, then fill the wound with cotton soaked in corrosive ointment and leave it there until it corrodes the remaining fat, and then treat it until it is healed.	But if you cannot make the incision as full and perfect as it ought to have been, because the patient is restless, or because haemorrhage arises, you should pack the wound with cotton wool soaked in corrosive ointment and leave till it eats away the remainder of the fat; then dress until healed.	0.8379953
