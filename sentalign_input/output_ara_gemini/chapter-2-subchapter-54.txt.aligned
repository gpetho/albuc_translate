Chapter fifty-four on the treatment of acne.	CHAPTER FIFTY-FOUR. On the treatment of dropsy.	0.7991332
We have already explained in the section on classification the types of ascites, how water accumulates, the signs of each type, and its treatment with medications.	We have mentioned in the section the kinds of hydrops, and the manner in which the fluid collects; the signs of each kind; and the medical treatment of them.	0.76232624
And the one that is treated with iron is only the ascitic type,	The only kind which is to be treated by operation is the one called 'ascites'.	0.59915304
and the drum-like type and the fleshy type should not be approached with iron at all, because that is deadly.	But neither the kind called 'tympanites' nor general anasarca are to be treated by operation at all, for that would be fatal.	0.55434
If you have treated this type of ascitic swelling with medications and your treatment has not been successful, then consider: if the patient is extremely weak, or has another disease besides the swelling, such as a cough or diarrhea, and so on, then beware of treating him with iron, because it is dangerous.	When you have been trying medical treatment for this kind, for ascites, and your treatment is ineffectual, then consider; and if the patient be in a low state or suffer from other disease beside the ascites, such as cough or diarrhoea or some such, then beware of attempting operative treatment since it will be of uncertain outcome.	0.83093965
If you see that the patient is strong, has no disease other than the swelling alone, and is neither a child nor an old man, then the way to proceed is to have the patient stand before you and have a servant behind him squeeze his abdomen with his hands and push the water down towards the pubic area,	But if you see that the patient has plenty of strength and suffers under no other complaint beside the dropsy, and is of neither tender nor advanced age, then the operative procedure in this case is for you to place the patient, standing, before you, with an assistant behind him to apply manual pressure to his abdomen and push the fluid down into the pelvis.	0.81075597
then take a pointed scalpel like this: Long, limited on both sides, with a defined tip like a scalpel, except that it has a slight bluntness so that it does not pass through to the intestine during the procedure and harm it.	Then take a pointed scalpel of this shape, sharp along both sides, long, and very sharp at the end like a scalpel, but slightly stubby so that in operating you do not reach the intestines and damage them.	0.7819526
Then look, if the hernia originates from the intestines, it is appropriate to distance the incision from the navel by three fingers downwards, along it, above the pubis.	Then consider; and if the dropsy arises from the region of the intestines then you should make an incision three fingers' breadth directly below the umbilicus, above the pubes.	0.84581995
If the hernia originates from liver disease, let your incision be three fingers to the left of the navel.	If the dropsy arises from disease of the liver, let your incision be three fingers to the left of the umbilicus.	0.87950575
If it originates from spleen disease, let the incision be on the right side, about three fingers.	If it arises from disease of the spleen, let the incision be three fingers to the right.	0.9259176
It is also not appropriate for the incision to be on the side on which the patient wants to lie down, so that excess fluids do not flow to that weak spot.	Moreover, the incision must not be on the side which the patient wishes to lie on, so that the superfluities may not flow to the damaged part.	0.87283814
Then pierce the entire skin with the instrument. Then insert the instrument into that incision and lift your hand with the scalpel between the skin and the peritoneum as if you are skinning it, and the amount you skin should be the size of a fingernail or so.	Then pierce the skin with the instrument, introduce the instrument into that incision, and bring the scalpel up between the skin and the membrane, as if excoriating, over an area about the size of a fingernail.	0.84010565
Then pierce the peritoneum until the scalpel reaches an empty space, which is the location of the fluid. Then remove it and insert into the hole the instrument, of which this is an image: It is similar to a tube of thin reed, made of silver or copper or polished smooth steel, having in its bottom a small hole, and on its sides three holes, two from one side and one from another, as you see.	Then pierce through the membrane till the scalpel reaches a cavity, which will be where the water is; then withdraw the scalpel and put into the opening the instrument shaped like this; it resembles a fine section of reed, made of silver, bronze or white copper; smooth and well polished, with a small opening at the lower end and three at the sides, two on one side and one on the other, as you see.	0.86349905
Its end may be sharpened like the point of a pen, in this form: At its upper end is a ring.	Its extremity may be cut to the shape of a writing reed like this; the upper end of it is supplied with a ring.	0.8168353
For when the instrument reaches the water, it will descend from its reservoir onto the instrument, and it will discharge a moderate amount of water at that time.	When the instrument reaches the fluid, the fluid will at once pass down into it.	0.68372005
Because if you discharge from it more than is necessary at the time, the patient may die from the dissolution of his animal spirit, or he may experience fainting close to death.	Evacuate at one time only a moderate amount of fluid; for if you evacuate more than you should at a time, the patient may die through a dissolution of his animal spirits, or he will undergo a fainting that is next door to death.	0.79583776
But discharge from it according to his strength and what the patient's condition indicates to you, from the strength of his pulse and the goodness of his color.	But let out such quantity of fluid as is proportionate to his strength and as is indicated to you by the patient's condition: the strength of his pulse and the goodness of his colour.	0.84132123
Then remove the instrument and stop the water.	Then withdraw the instrument and keep (the rest of) the fluid in.	0.7208972
This is because it stops from its reservoir due to the leather that covers the hole on the peritoneum, which I told you to pad in that manner.	For it will be immediately held back by the skin that closes the opening in the peritoneum, which, as I have told you, must be perforated in that manner.	0.7760457
Then return the instrument another day if you see the patient can tolerate it, and also extract a small amount of water.	Then repeat the use of the instrument another day if you see that the patient can tolerate it, and withdraw again a small quantity of fluid.	0.91882265
Do this for several days, while being cautious and guarding against error, until only a small amount of water remains.	And do this daily, watchful and on guard against error, until there is only a trace of fluid left.	0.7393538
If you fear for the patient and have left a large amount of water, treat him by burying him in hot sand, and with profuse sweating in the bath and sun, and make him endure thirst, and treat him with drying medications until he recovers.	But if you are afraid for the patient and leave a large amount of fluids treat him by burying him in hot sand, and by heavy sweating in the bath and in the sun, and letting him go thirsty; while you treat him with drying medicines, till he is well.	0.91812444
And cauterize him on the stomach, liver, and spleen after extracting the water as I described previously.	He should also be cauterized on the abdomen and on the liver and spleen after the paracentesis, as I have previously described.	0.7440978
