About tears
When tears from the eyes descend from the veins on the top of the head outward, and medical treatments do not help, and you see the patient's face redden, and he feels a throbbing in the forehead as if from chills; and his eyes are thin and moist so that the hairs of the eyelids fall out, and the eyelids are heated and scraped by the burning of the tears, then there is need for this treatment.
And the ancients called it "contused treatment," and it involves having the patient with this disease pull back any hair on their forehead, then make three incisions on the forehead evenly along the length of the forehead; one of the incisions should be like two fingers in the middle of the forehead, running down to the nose, and the other two at the sides above the eyelids, and be careful of the incision of the arteries that are at the two sides above the eyelids; and keep your hand away from the junction of the two jawbones, and each wound should be three fingers wide across joined together;
and have ready a piece of sponge and many dry cloths to wipe away the blood, then place the sharp two-edged spatula, which is of this form:
from the incision that is towards the temple to the second incision; and scrape all the flesh that is between the two cuts along with the tissue that is on the bone, then do the same from the middle incision to the other second, and then remove this spatula.
then place in the first cut the instrument that is called "knife-like," and it is very sharp on one side, and on the other side it is smooth, not sharp, and this is the form:
And place the cutting side towards the flesh up to the tissue, and the smooth side towards the bone, and place it until it reaches the middle cut. And cut all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes until the incision is continuous to what appears from the tissue, and then do the same from the middle cut to the other outside; and then extract the blood evenly, and press the area for the clotted blood; then place in each cut a tent of old cotton, and place cloths soaked in wine and oil and vinegar, and ensure that no hot abscess forms; and on the third day, untie the bandage, and administer a large amount of warm water, then treat it with basilicon ointment with rose oil, and other treatments used for wounds, until it is healed.
