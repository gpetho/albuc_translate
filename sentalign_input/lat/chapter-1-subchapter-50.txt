On the method of cauterizing for cancer.
Chapter 52.
When cancer is beginning, and you want to halt it, then cauterize around it with a circular cautery, following its circumference.
The wise have said that it should be cauterized with a final cautery in the center.
However, this does not seem advisable to me, as I fear it may ulcerate, and I have seen this happen several times.
It is better to cauterize around it with a circular cautery as we mentioned, or with multiple cauteries.
