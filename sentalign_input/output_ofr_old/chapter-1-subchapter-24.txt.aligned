of the cough When cough and lung disease are caused by cold moisture, and the patient has no fever or dryness, and the disease is old, make two cauteries on the chest in empty places; and one cautery in the middle of the chest between the two breasts; and let the cautery be called "clavile" according to the shape mentioned earlier.	When the cough and pulmonary disease arise from cold humidities and the patient suffers from no fever or wasting but the disease is chronic, sear him with two cauterizations over the two clavicles, in the soft depressions ; and with another cauterization in the mid-line of the chest between the breasts. Let the cautery be claviform as described above.	0.8427586
And if you want, make a cautery by pricking with the cautery called "poins" whose shape is mentioned earlier in the disease of the ears; and make up to thirty pricks, or around that number. Afterward treat the area as mentioned earlier, and let the cauteries be in three rows according to this shape:	And if you prefer, make punctate cauterizations with the cautery called 'punctate'; its shape has already been described under pricking for earache. The punctures should number upwards of thirty. Then treat as aforesaid until healed.	0.79266274
And for this reason, the cauteries are lighter, because you make three at once.	Sometimes also a trident cautery is prepared, in this manner, with which you can burn more speedily; for with this you can apply three cauterizations at once.	0.59530747
