of the fracture of the shoulder blade/collarbone
The shoulder blade/collarbone is that which is between the neck and the head of the shoulder, and if it is fractured, it should be restored according to one of two methods: one of which is that you take a moderately thick piece of wood, in this shape:
And tie two cords to the two ends, and hang them up high, and have the patient sit on a seat; then place their broken arm over the wood, until it reaches the armpit, and in the middle have a curved piece of wood, then hang some heavy object or have an assistant pull it downwards; then the physician sets the fracture with his hands together, until the fracture returns to how it should be. 
And the other method is that the patient is put on their back, and their hand is tied to their neck, then two assistants are instructed, one to hold above the fracture with their hands, and the other to hold below with a cord, and each pulls on their side.
And if you wish the pulling to be stronger, tighten a cord below the fracture, and above the fracture, and each assistant pulls on their side.
And if the fracture is near the head of the shoulder, you must place a cord moderately tight under the armpit, and another towards the neck, below the fracture; and also if the fracture is towards the neck, a cord must be placed there lightly, without straining, until the fracture is even on top of the area, and on the neck; then set the fracture evenly, as is necessary, and bind it, if hot swelling/inflammation does not arise. 
And if hot swelling/inflammation arises, do not bind it for up to seven days, and apply wool moistened in vinegar and rose oil, until the hot swelling/inflammation subsides; then bind it, and the way to bind it is to put the plaster on the fracture, then bring the arm against the shoulder, and place your hand on the shoulder or on the chest; and place the cloth, and bind it over the shoulder, and over the arm, so that the arm is in the shape of a star, unless something prevents it, or if the bone is not displaced.
And if you suspect that the bone might move, use splints, and place on the fracture a splint wider and stronger than the others, and have a finger's width of space between each splint, and each splint should be so large that it extends past the fracture by three fingers' widths on each side; then bind over the splints, as I said at the beginning of the chapter on fractures, tighter and less often changing the bandages.
And if you observe the placement of the splints and the bandaging, as we have said, at the time you set the broken limb, and you are concerned about hot swelling/inflammation, leave it unbound until the seventh day, as we have said; then check the bandaging every three days, that itching or swelling does not occur there, or that nourishment cannot reach the limb because it is too tight.
Then adjust it, as we have said.
And if no such problem arises, do not unbind it until after three days or more, and let the patient sleep on his back, with his hands on his stomach; and place a cushion filled evenly with wool under the shoulder, and check every hour of the day or night that the shape of the broken limb does not change, or that the bandaging is not loosened; adjust it skillfully with medical expertise, and give him the food that we have previously mentioned, in such a way that the food is initially light; and when he begins to recover, it should be richer.
And it is customary that the shoulder and the leg should be completely healed in forty days; and then one should unbind it and administer baths and medicinal ointments to restore the area.
And if the injury is severe and swollen, wait to unbind it for fifty days or two months.
