Chapter fifty-six on cauterizing bleeding occurring when an artery is severed.	CHAPTER FIFTY-SIX. On cauterization in haemorrhage arising from a cut artery.	0.80685556
Bleeding often occurs from an artery that has been severed during an external wound, or when incising a tumor, or cauterizing an organ, and so on, making it difficult to stop.	Very often there occurs bleeding from an artery which has been cut either by an external wound or in opening an abscess or in cauterizing a part of the body and so on, and it is difficult to stem.	0.886515
So if this happens to someone, quickly place your index finger over the opening of the artery and press firmly until the blood is trapped beneath your finger and nothing comes out.	When this happens to anyone, quickly apply your hand to the mouth of the artery, putting your forefinger to it and closing it properly till the bleeding ceases under your fingers and nothing comes out.	0.8886392
Then place several small and large olive-shaped cauteries in the fire and blow on them until they become very hot.	Then put in the fire several olivary cauteries, small and large, and blow on them to make them very hot.	0.9246787
Then take one of them, either small or large depending on the wound and the place where the artery ruptured, and apply the cautery to the vessel itself after quickly removing your finger, holding the cautery until the bleeding stops.	Then take one, small or large according to the size of the wound and the site of the opening of the artery, and bring the cautery down right on the artery itself, after promptly removing your finger, and hold the cautery upon it till the blood ceases.	0.90876126
If the blood gushes out when you lift your finger from the opening of the artery and the cautery is extinguished, quickly take another cautery from those prepared in the fire, and continue doing this one after another until the bleeding stops, taking care not to burn a nerve that might be there, thus causing the patient further harm.	But if it bursts out after you have removed your finger from the mouth of the artery, and the cautery has cooled, promptly take another of the cauteries which you have ready in the fire. Continue doing this, with one after another, till the haemorrhage is stanched. Mind you do not burn any nerve which may be there, so that another calamity afflicts the patient.	0.8465662
Know that if an artery bleeds, it cannot be stopped, especially if it is a large artery, except by one of four methods: either by cauterization as we have said, or by severing it if it has not already been severed, for if it is severed, its ends will contract and the bleeding will stop, or by tying it tightly with threads, or by applying medications that stop bleeding and applying tight bandages.	You should know that when there is arterial haemorrhage it is impossible to stop it, especially when the vessel is big, except in one of four ways, to wit: by the cautery as we have said; or by division of the vessel when it is not completely divided, for when it is cut through the ends of it contract and the bleeding is stopped; or by a strong thread ligature; or by the application of styptics with tight bandaging.	0.90289354
As for those who try to stop it with a bandage, or by tightening it with rags, or by applying burning substances, and so on, it will not stop at all by that, except rarely.	But those who try to stop bleeding with ligatures or cloths, or by the application of caustics and the like, never stanch it by these means, or at least very rarely.	0.7299189
If this happens to someone and there is no doctor or medicine present, he should immediately place his index finger over the opening of the wound itself, as we have described, and press very firmly until the blood is contained and comes out from above the wound, and he should continually apply very cold water to the artery and finger, without removing it, until the blood clots, thickens, and stops flowing.	And if this happen to anyone and there are available neither doctor nor remedies, let him at once apply his forefinger to the mouth of the vessel as we have bidden and close it firmly till the blood is stanched; and pour over the wound and over the artery, without removing the finger, water as cold as possible till the blood thickens and congeals and ceases to flow.	0.8742887
Meanwhile, consider what cauterization or medication he needs.	And meanwhile one should be considering what kind of cautery or medicine is indicated.	0.83455133
