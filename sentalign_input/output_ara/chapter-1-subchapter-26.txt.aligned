If there occurs in the stomach coldness and much moisture, so that it puts it out of its temperament, and the discharges to it increase, and it is treated with various kinds of treatment but it does not succeed, then the patient should lie on his back and extend his legs and arms, then you should cauterize him with three cauterizations. One cauterization below the xiphoid process the width of a finger with a nail-shaped cautery, and two cauterizations below, on the sides of the single cauterization, so that the shape of the cauterizations is like a triangle, and further apart so that they do not join when they suppurate, and the depth of the cautery should be two-thirds of the thickness of the skin, and the shape of the cauterizations should be...	When cold and many humidities get into the stomach, so that its constitution is disturbed and much fluxion has come to it, and a variety of treatment has been tried to no effect, the patient must be put on his back with legs and arms outstretched; then give him a threefold cauterization: one a finger's breadth below the hollow of the chest with the claviform cautery; and two below and to the sides of the first cauterization, so that it has a triangular appearance; but there should be some distance between each lest they run together when suppuration sets in. Let the depth of the burning be two-thirds of the depth of the skin.	0.86193293
like this image, and this size, no more.	Let the shape of the cauterizations be thus and of no more than this size.	0.52852964
And if you wish, cauterize it with one large cauterization in the middle of the stomach like this image.	If you wish, make a single large cauterization in the middle of the stomach, thus.	0.7587488
And the cautery iron with which you cauterize this single cauterization should be in the shape of a circle like this image.	The cautery for this single cauterization is circular, thus.	0.48316872
And the stomach may be cauterized by spotting, for one who shrinks from this cauterization, which is that you mark points on the stomach to the extent that you desire with ink, then cauterize it with a spotting cautery, then treat it with the aforementioned treatment until it heals.	The stomach may be cauterized with punctures in the case of a person who fears this operation. You will have marked the points with ink on the stomach, as many as you wish; then sear with a punctate cautery. Then treat as previously described until he be healed.	0.7929395
