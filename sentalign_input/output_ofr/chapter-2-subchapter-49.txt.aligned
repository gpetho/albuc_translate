of the rupture of the artery When the artery is ruptured, and the skin above it is closed, an abscess often forms, and the same happens with a swollen and abscessed vein; and it is recognized as being from the artery if the abscess is long and deep; and when you feel it with your fingers, you feel a tightening; and when it is from the vein, redness from the outside is apparent; and it is foolish to cut this abscess, especially when it is under the armpits, and in the groin, and in the neck, and in many other places, and is very large.	On opening a tumour arising from a bloodvessel, called an aneurysm. When an artery is injured and the overlying skin scars, a tumour very often arises from this; the same thing happens to a vein: a swelling and a tumour. And these are the signs by which you may diagnose whether the swelling and tumour arise from an artery or a vein: if it be from an artery the tumour will be a deep and elongated mass; and when you press upon it with your finger there will be a feeling of pulsation. But if it arises from a vein the swelling will be circular and superficial.	0.81241107
