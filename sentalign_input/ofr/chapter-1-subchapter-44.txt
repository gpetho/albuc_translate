of the pain of the joints
When joint pains are from humors that are spread to each limb of the body, and when the pain comes in the feet, which doctors properly call "gout," and when it is from a cold cause and treatments with medicines cannot cure it, it is treated by cauteries in this way:
Make many cauteries around the joint of the foot, and let the cautery be olive-shaped according to this form:
And if it is necessary that you prick on the surface of the foot, make a cautery with the entire cautery that is called "point".
And if the pains come up to the knees and to the other joints, and this happens many times, make three or four cauteries on each knee, on each side, with the olive-shaped cautery;
and if you need more, make more, but do not hold your hand there longer than it takes to burn the thickness of leather.
And if the pains descend to the knee and to the back, administer the cautery that we have described in its chapter.
And if the pains are in the hands, make punctures around the wrist in two lines;
and if any pain remains in the fingers, make punctures on each joint and on the back of the hand;
And if the pains reach the elbows or up to the shoulders, cauterize each part, and ensure the patient has good care and takes medicines.
For if you provide good care and purge phlegm, he will be healed with God's help.
