of the spleen
When the spleen is cold and moist, and yet does not prevent conception, and the menses are corrupted and their periods delayed;
and when they come, she feels great pain:
then it is necessary to make three cauteries around the navel, as we have described in the cautery of the bladder, and two cauteries outside the back;
and the cautery should be key-shaped, as we have described.
