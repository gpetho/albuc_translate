If weakness and relaxation occur in the bladder due to cold and humidity, so that the patient cannot hold urine, cauterize him with a cautery below the navel, over the bladder where the pubic hair begins, and a cautery to the right of the navel, and another to its left.	When there occurs in the urinary bladder a weakness and relaxation due to chill and humidities, so that the patient cannot retain his water, sear him once below his navel, on the bladder, where the pubic hair begins; burn him once also on the right side and once on the left side of the navel; and let the distance of the burn from either side be the length of the joint of the thumb.	0.847876
And the distance after cauterization from each side should be about the width of a thumb joint. Cauterize him with a cautery at the bottom of the back, or two cauteries if needed, and the cautery iron should be nail-shaped, as mentioned before.	Cauterize him also once on the lower part of the back, or twice if you need. The cautery should be claviform, as described.	0.6340587
