Chapter eighty-four on the treatment of wounds/injuries/surgeries.	CHAPTER EIGHTY-FOUR. On the cure of wounds.	0.7464801
I have mentioned in the division of the treatment of what resembles cauterizations, and I mention here their treatment by hand and with medicines to perfection, so I say that wounds vary according to the thing that causes the wound and according to the place where the wound occurs, so the things that cause wounds are many, such as a blow from a stone or a cut from a sword or a knife, or a stab from a spear, a stick, or an arrow, and so on from many things.	I have already mentioned in the appropriate section the treatment of such wounds as are suitable for cauterization. Here I shall describe the operative and medical treatment in full. So I begin by saying that wounds differ according to that which causes them and according to the site. Those things that cause wounds are many: a knock from a stone, a cut from a sword or a knife, a blow by a spear, stick, or arrow; and many such things.	0.87559474
As for the wounds according to the places of the body, they are like the wound that occurs on the head, neck, chest, abdomen, liver, and other organs.	To consider wounds according to their site on the body, they are such as a wound occurring in the head, or neck, or chest, or belly, or liver, and so on.	0.8649378
And I am describing the treatment of some wounds to make them a measurement and a law for all other wounds, and I begin with simple head wounds, especially because the complex ones will be mentioned at the beginning of the third chapter of this book.	Now I am going to describe the treatment of certain wounds, so that you may take them as a standard and a guide for other wounds. I shall begin particularly with the simple wounds of the head; for mention of the compound wounds will be made at the beginning of the third book.	0.8724122
If there is an impediment to bleeding him, let him reduce his food, and not approach meat or drinks.	But if from any cause venesection is prevented, he should be on a light diet and avoid meat and wines.	0.66428155
And apply to the wound, if a hot swelling occurs in it, cotton dipped in rose oil alone or with the drink that has astringency.	And apply to the wound, if there be any inflammation, cotton wool soaked in oil of roses, either alone or with a somewhat astringent wine.	0.8964221
And if you are safe from the hot swelling, apply to the wound, if it is fresh with its blood and the air has not changed it, the powder that I will describe to you shortly.	And if you are sure there is no inflammatory swelling, then apply directly to the wound, if its blood is fresh and it is unaltered by the air, the powder that I shall describe to you a little later.	0.892971
But if the air has changed it, apply some ointments to it until it draws pus, then treat it until it heals.	But if the air has already changed the wound, apply to it one of the ointments to cause it to discharge the pus; then dress until healed.	0.85221255
If the wound is large and is from a sword cut or the like, and its edges do not meet with the bandages, then join it with sutures as I describe in suturing abdominal wounds.	Now if it be a great wound, being caused by a sword-cut or the like, and dressings will not bring the edges of the wound together, you should suture them together in the manner I shall describe in dealing with the suture of abdominal wounds.	0.8266448
If the skin has exposed the bone and is hanging, and its hold is only in a small attachment, cut it off, then treat the wound with medicines that repair solid flesh in it instead of the skin, and order the patient to eat foods that have firmness, such as heads, porridges, and the like.	But if the skin has actually disclosed the bone, and is attached by a small strip only, then cut it away and dress the wound with medicaments that will produce firm flesh to replace the skin, and bid the patient go on a diet of solid food such as brawn and gruels and the like.	0.800784
If putrefaction occurs in the skin and it does not stick to the bone, cut off all the putrefied part and discard it, then treat it.	And if decomposition arise in the skin and it will not adhere to the bone, then excise all the diseased part and discard it and then dress.	0.77741563
If in these wounds there is an artery or a vein bleeding from it, and the blood has not stopped with the medicines, then search for the artery, and if you find it and it is not severed, then sever it with the scalpel and tie it, and if necessary, if what we mentioned does not help, cauterize it until the blood stops, and if these wounds are small and simple, then their matter is easy and simple, it is sufficient to treat them by sprinkling this powder on them while they are still bleeding before the air changes them.	If in these wounds there be an artery or vein shedding blood, and medicinal applications do not stanch it, then examine the artery, and if you find it not quite severed then cut it through with a scalpel and ligature it; and if you are compelled, our directions being unavailing, then cauterize until the haemorrhage stops. If these be small and simple wounds their treatment will be a light and easy matter; it is sufficient to sprinkle some of this powder on while they are still bleeding, before the atmosphere causes a change.	0.89686453
The recipe for the powder is that one part of frankincense is taken, two parts of mastic, and three parts of slaked or unslaked lime, all are crushed and sifted, and the wound is packed with it, and it is tied tightly until it adheres to it well and clots with the blood, then you tie it from above with bandages and leave it, do not loosen it as long as it does not swell, for the medicine will not come off it until it heals.	Description of the powder: let one part of olibanum and two parts of dragon's blood be taken, and three parts of quick or slaked lime, all beaten up together and passed through the sieve; and let the wound be packed with this and bound up tightly so that the powder sticks in position and coagulates with the blood. Then bind pads above and let it be, not undoing it so long as it remains without swelling; for the dressing will not come away of itself until it is healed.	0.79687434
And that lime alone may do it if you do not have frankincense and mastic, and it may also do this action by itself in many large wounds if its placement on it and its tightening are mastered, and the wounds are fresh with their blood as long as the air has not changed them.	Lime alone can do this if you have no olibanum and dragon's blood at hand. It has exactly the same effect too on most large wounds, when the application and bandaging are properly done, and when the haemorrhage is recent, so long as the air has not changed them.	0.7099706
But if the air has changed it somewhat, especially if it is in the summer time, then there is no meaning in putting this powder, so treat it as we mentioned, by applying some ripening ointments to it, or applying a porridge of barley flour made with water and honey until it draws pus, then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.	If, however, the air has brought about some change, especially if it be in the summer season, then there is no point in the application of this powder. Treat it then as we have said, by applying one or other of the suppurative ointments; or by applying a gruel of barleymeal with water and honey, so that the pus flows; then treat by all the usual methods until cured.	0.88516873
But if a bone fracture occurs with the wound, and it is slight, then pull it with the forceps.	If, with the wound, there be also fracture of a bone, if it be slight, you should extract it with forceps.	0.77731204
I have mentioned the treatment of head fractures in what is to be resumed.	I mention the treatment of fractures of the head later on.	0.77740926
In neck surgery,	On wounds in the neck:	0.6001872
But if the wound is large, use sutures or join its edges with bandages, then treat it until it heals.	If the wound be large, use stitches or draw the edges of the wound together with pads; then dress until cured.	0.8485079
If the wound has depth and a pocket has occurred in its bottom where pus has collected, then drain it in the lowest place in it.	But if there be depth to the wound and a sinus appears at the bottom of it, in which pus has collected, then make an opening at the site of greatest depth.	0.8071183
If an artery has been cut in the wound and you find its blood bleeding, then sever it or tie it or cauterize it if necessary.	Now if an artery has been cut in the wound and you are in time to find it still bleeding, divide it or ligature it; or cauterize it if you are compelled to.	0.8643113
If the wound has cut some or all of the cartilage of the larynx, and the jugular veins are safe, then join the edges of the skin with sutures over the trachea, and do not touch the larynx, but straighten it and return it to its natural shape, then tighten it tightly and leave it for days, then treat it with ointments that have astringency and drying until it heals.	If it be such a wound that some of the cartilages of the trachea are laid open, or the whole trachea, the jugular veins being safe and sound, then join the skin edges together with a suture over the windpipe, and do not touch the windpipe, but straighten it and restore to its natural form; then tie firmly and leave for some days; then treat with salves having some styptic and astringent quality, until healed.	0.8873507
If the wound has affected the bone, then examine it, and if there are bone fragments in it, then extract them all or what is possible of them, and what you cannot, leave it until the wound putrefies and heals and its removal becomes easy.	If the wound has affected bone, examine it, and if there be fragments of bone in it get them all out, or all you can. Those you cannot get hold of, leave until the wound suppurates and heals, and it will be easy to extract them.	0.93724227
If the wound is fresh, then sprinkle on it the powder that we described, and if bone putrefies in the wound and becomes a fistula, then treat it as will be mentioned in its chapter.	If it be a fresh wound, sprinkle on the powder I have described ; and if any bone corrupt in the wound and it becomes a fistula, treat it by those means we shall mention in their place.	0.8498074

And if three days or more have passed for the wound, and the patient has not experienced any convulsions, bad palpitations, or shortness of breath, and you see that all his other conditions are good, then know that the wound is safe, so treat it with bandaging and the rest of the treatment until it heals.	And if three or four days pass by after the wound, and the patient have no spasm or harmful palpitation of the heart nor obstruction to drawing breath, and you see that in other respects he is doing well, you may know that the wound is not dangerous; so treat it with pads and the usual dressings until it heals.	0.87122005
If its healing is difficult and it constantly suppurates, then know that it has become a fistula, so treat it according to its chapter.	But if it will not heal and it permanently discharges pus, you may know that it has become a fistula; look for the treatment of this in the proper place.	0.6917447
And if time has passed for the wound of the chest or back, treat it with what has been mentioned of suturing if it is large, or with the powder if it is small.	If the wound be from a cut with a sword or knife, a straightforward surface wound in the breast or back, then treat it as described before; that is, by suture if it be a great wound or by powder if it be a small one.	0.7106484
If it has affected the bone and cut off fragments from it, then examine the wound and hasten to remove those fragments if they are free, and if they are not free, then leave them until the wound putrefies, for it will make their removal easier.	But if there has also been injury to the bone, cutting out fragments from it, you should explore the wound and hasten to draw out the fragments if they are detached from the bone; but if they are not detached then let be until the wound suppurates, when the removal of the fragments will be easy.	0.81197083
As for the rest of the wounds occurring in the rest of the organs, their rule in treatment is the rule of what we have mentioned.	Then with regard to other wounds occurring in other parts of the body, the same class of treatment should be used for them as for those already mentioned.	0.6382432
