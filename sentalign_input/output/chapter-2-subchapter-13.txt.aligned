And the way to work on it is that you split this seam/adhesion, and separate the lips/edges of it, and put inside tents of linen, and bind it until it is healed; and you should not use in its treatment things that dry and constrict.	The idea of the operation is to excise the scar, separate the edges of the wound, pack linen between them, and bandage up till healed. In the treatment of it you should not use anything styptic or drying, for if you do the inversion will return worse than ever before.	0.7122306
For if you do that, the illness returns worse than the first; but work with softening things, such as fenugreek; and bathe it with water in which althea and linseed are cooked, and ointments of melted diachylon in some oil, and wrap a tent in it, and treat it with that.	Employ relaxing substances such as fenugreek; and fomentation with water in which mallows and linseed have been boiled; and diachylon plaster which has been previously softened with one of the oils and spread on the packs; and treat it with this. The main thing in the treatment is to use every device to prevent the healing up of the place as it was before.	0.74062157

The main thing in the treatment is to use every device to prevent the healing up of the place as it was before. This operation which we have described is but some correction of the inversion, not that the appearance of the place will necessarily revert to what it was.	0.7128368
