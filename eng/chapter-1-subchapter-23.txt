 CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE.
On cauterization for hoarseness and for constriction of the breath.
 When humidities prevail over the windpipe, and especially when there is a frigid temperament, the patient should first have his bowels opened with a laxative.
Then cauterize him once in the hollow of the jugular fossa at the root of the throat in the hollow part.
Take care that the cautery does not pierce through to the gullet, and burn no more than half of the thickness of the skin.
Then cauterize him once more, strongly, at the junction of the neck with its last vertebra, the cautery being claviform as described above.
Then treat as prescribed before till healed.
