Chapter Thirty-Three
On Splinting Loose Teeth with Silver or Gold Wires.
If the front teeth become loose and shaky from a blow or a fall, and the patient cannot bite on anything that is eaten for fear that they will fall out, and you have treated them with astringent medicines but the treatment has not been successful.
The remedy is to tie them with a gold or silver wire, and gold is better because silver tarnishes and corrodes after a few days, while gold remains in its original state forever and is not affected by this. The wire should be of medium thinness and thickness, as much as fits between the teeth.
The method of splinting is to take the wire and insert its bend between the two sound teeth, then weave the ends of the wire between the loose teeth, whether one or more, until you reach the sound tooth on the other side with the weaving.
Then you return the weave to the side you started from and pull gently and skillfully so that they do not move at all, and your tightening of the wire should be at the roots of the teeth so that it does not slip, then you cut the excess ends of the wire with scissors and gather them and twist them with pliers and hide them between the sound tooth and the loose tooth.
So that it does not hurt the tongue, then you leave it tightened like this as long as it remains. If it becomes loose or breaks, you tighten it with another wire, so they enjoy it like this for a lifetime. And this is a picture of the teeth and the form of splinting in two sound teeth and two loose teeth, as you see:.
And a single tooth or two may be returned to its place after falling out, and it is splinted as we described, and it remains. But this is done by a skilled and delicate craftsman. And he may carve a bone from the bones of cattle and make it like a tooth and place it in the place from which the tooth has gone.
And he tightens it as we said, and it remains, and he benefits from that.
