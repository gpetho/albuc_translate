of coldness of the head
It is necessary that the head be cleansed with herbs and with what we have said before; afterward shave the head of the patient, then make a cautery in the middle of the head and on each temple, and one behind and three on the spine of the neck; and if you need more, and the body is moist and the patient is tolerant, and the illness is severe, make four cauteries on the spine of the back; and leave them until the core is mostly burned, and lift your hand; afterward treat it until he is healed, and let the cautery be the one called "olive-shaped" which we have mentioned before.
