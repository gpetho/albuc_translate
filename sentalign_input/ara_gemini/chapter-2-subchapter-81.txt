Chapter eighty-one on the perforation of hemorrhoids from which blood flows, their excision, and the treatment of fissures.
Hemorrhoids are of two types: either they are inside the anus, resembling red blisters, or like grapes, and they are small and large, and blood flows from them constantly, and they are single and multiple, and they are outside the anus and on its edges, except that those that are outside the anus are mostly dry, with yellow water or a little blood flowing constantly from them, and they are the color of the skin.
And the treatment of what is inside the anus is that you order the patient to defecate and strain until the anus comes out and the warts appear to you, then you quickly hook them with hooks or hold them with your fingernail, then cut them at their roots.
If the hooks do not hold in them because of their moisture and looseness, then scrape them with a rough cloth or a piece of rough bread or pull them with your fingers, then cut them, then sprinkle on them after cutting some sharp powders so that it takes the place of cauterization or cauterize them as mentioned in the chapter on cauterization, then treat them with the rest of the treatment until they heal.
If the anus does not respond to coming out, then inject the patient with an enema that has a little sting to wash what is in the anus and it will come out quickly when the patient strains.
As for the warts outside the anus, their matter is easy and simple, which is that you take them with your fingernail or hook them with a hook and cut them, then treat them with what we mentioned until they heal.
And whoever dislikes cutting with iron, it is appropriate to use piercing them in this way: take a twisted thread and insert it into a needle, then pull the wart up and pierce it with the needle at its root from the other side, and wrap the ends of the thread under the needle while it is crossed, and tighten the wart tightly, then tie the thread and remove the needle.
Do this with all the warts and leave one of them unpierced so that the excess blood flows from it.
Then put on the anus a cloth dipped in rose oil or cerotti and put it on the anus and order the patient to rest, then leave it until they fall, and if the warts fall, treat them with ointments and the rest of the treatment until they heal.
As for the treatment of fissures, it often occurs from dryness of the stool and constipation, so if it becomes chronic and no medicine works on it, it is appropriate to scrape it with a scalpel blade or your fingernail until it becomes moist and the upper crust that prevents it from healing is removed, then treat it until it heals as it should.
If it does not heal, then repeat scraping it more severely than the first time until it bleeds well and peels, then treat it, and it will heal.
