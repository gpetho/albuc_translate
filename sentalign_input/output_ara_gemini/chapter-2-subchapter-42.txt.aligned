The forty-second chapter on the incision on the scrofulas that appear in the neck.	CHAPTER FORTY-TWO. On the incision of scrofulous glands in the neck.	0.70443016
These tumors frequently occur in the neck, under the armpits, and in the groins, and they may occur throughout the body.	Tumours of this kind often occur in the neck and in the axilla and in the groin; and sometimes in other parts of the body.	0.7587216
Those that occur in the neck can be single or multiple. And some of them arise from others. And each scrofulous tumor (khanazira) is within its own membrane, as is the case with hernias and head tumors, as we have described.	Those occurring in the neck are sometimes single and sometimes multiple, one arising from another; and each scrofula is contained in a capsule of its own, like the cysts and tumours of the head that we have described.	0.8624128
And the types of these scrofulous tumors are many: some are hardened, some contain fluids, and some are malignant and do not respond to treatment.	There are many kinds of these glands; some are stony, some contain humidities, some are malignant and do not respond to treatment.	0.75880384
So, if I find one of them that feels good to the touch, and its appearance is close to the color of the skin, and it moves in every direction, and it is not attached to a nerve of the neck, nor to a vein, nor to an artery, and it is not deep, then it should be incised with a simple incision from top to bottom of the growth in this manner, from line C to line B.	But those that you find by touch to be benign and are of a colour not greatly differing from the skin, freely movable in any direction, not adherent to the nerves of the neck nor to a jugular vein, nor to an artery, and are not deep-lying; these should be incised with a simple incision from above downwards, from line g to line b	0.7550483
And skin it from every side, and stretch the lips of the skin with a hook or with two hooks, or with many hooks, if you need that, as we said regarding head tumors, and extract it little by little, and be careful not to cut a vein or a nerve.	and dissect away all round and draw the edges of the skin apart with one or two hooks or with several if necessary, as we said on the subject of tumours of the head, and draw them out very slowly. Be most careful not to cut a blood-vessel or nerve.	0.86955297
And let the scalpel not be very sharp, lest your hand cuts more, or the patient moves, so you cut what you don't need to cut.	The scalpel should not be over sharp lest you make the incision too big, or the patient flinches and so you cut open that which does not need cutting.	0.82506734
If you cut a vein or an artery and it hinders you from working, then put in the wound crushed vitriol or some of the powders that stop the blood, and tighten the wound and leave it until the intensity of the tumor subsides, the wound relaxes and starts to suppurate, then the blood will stop then, so return to your work until you are finished.	If you cut a vein or artery and be thus hindered in your operating, apply powdered vitriol or some styptic powder to the wound, and bandage the wound and let be till the worst of the swelling has subsided and the opening is relaxed and threatens to turn purulent; for then the bleeding will stop. Then return to your operation and finish it.	0.8852361
Then search with your index finger, if other small tumors remained, then cut them and clean them.	Then feel with your forefinger to see if there are any small glands left, in which case dissect and clean them away.	0.8399714
If there is a large vein at the base of the tumor, then it is appropriate not to cut that tumor from its base, but it is appropriate to tie it with a doubled tight thread and leave it until it falls by itself without harm, then fill the wound with worn cotton having dipped it in the Egyptian ointment, then treat it.	If there is a large blood-vessel at the root of the gland, then you should not cut that gland at its root but should ligature it with a strong double ligature and leave it till it sloughs away of its own accord without harm. Then pack the wound with cotton wool previously soaked in Egyptian ointment; then continue dressing.	0.8758899
And if you cut the whole tumor, then it is appropriate to bring together the lips of the wound and sew it immediately after you know that no excess remains at all, but if you see that some excess remains due to the size of the tumor, then you should aim to cut it to its origin and base, and use stitching and what we mentioned.	If you excise the whole gland, you should at once draw together the two edges of the wound and suture them, when you are absolutely certain there is nothing of it left. But if you see that, on account of the size of the scrofula, there is still some superfluity left behind, you should carry the incision to the root and base of it, and employ suturing and the rest of the remedies mentioned.	0.8183596
And for tumors that contain fluids, poultice them with a simple poultice where their ripeness appears to you, and make the poultice from the lower part, as we said, then after the poultice, use the wick with the Egyptian ointment and the like to eat away what remains of the corruption, until you see the wound has become clean, then treat it with ointments that promote flesh growth until it heals.	The glands that contain humidities you should open with a single perforation where they seem to have matured; make your perforation from below, as we have said. Then after opening use swabs soaked in Egyptian and similar ointments to do away with the unhealthy remains, till you see that the wound is clean; then dress with nourishing ointments until healed.	0.75302327
