Chapter Thirty on the Treatment of Dislocation of the Vertebrae of the Back	CHAPTER THIRTY. On the treatment of dislocation of the spinal vertebrae.	0.8150803
When a vertebra of the back or neck is completely dislocated, or many vertebrae are displaced from their positions, there is no treatment for it because death comes quickly to the patient,	When any of the vertebrae of the back or the neck are completely dislocated or a number of vertebrae are displaced, there is no treatment in this case for death is hastening toward the patient.	0.89856654
And a sign of this is that the patient's stool comes out involuntarily, he cannot hold it, and often some of his limbs become relaxed, either his legs or his arms, or one of them.	The sign of this is that the injured man passes a motion involuntarily, being unable to hold it back; often too some of his limbs go limp, either both legs or both arms or one of them.	0.84007293
But if one vertebra is displaced from its position, it often shifts, and its shifting can be in four directions, and the one that shifts backward is called a hump.	If, as often happens, a single vertebra is displaced, the displacement may be in any of four directions. When there is a displacement backwards it is called 'curvature of the spine'.	0.7582848
And as for its treatment, you should observe: if the hump occurred from childhood, there is no treatment for it, nor any cure at all.	As to its treatment: examine it; if the curvature dates from childhood then there is no treatment or cure at all for it.	0.8287873
But as for the one that occurred from a fall or a blow and the like, the ancients mentioned it with various kinds of treatment in lengthy discourse, most of which is not beneficial, and I have summarized from that what little suffices for much of what they brought, from my approaching the meaning and my explanation of it, and I have depicted the instrument differently from what they explained and illustrated.	As for the sort that occurs from a fall or a blow or the like, the Ancients indulged in lengthy dissertations thereon, giving many kinds of treatment, the greater part of which is of no use. But I have abbreviated from it, making a little which will serve in place of their much, consisting in my clarification and exposition of the sense. I have also depicted the instrument differently from their account and their explanation.	0.88926786
So I say that the hump that occurs from the front in the chest, there is no remedy for it, nor any cure from it, and likewise the one that is to the two sides also, but only the one that occurs in the back is treated, especially with what I am describing.	I say then, that in a curvature occurring forward there is no technique or cure for it. And likewise in a curvature laterally. The only curvature that can be treated is that of the dorsal spine exclusively, by the means I now describe.	0.7426025
If it does not return with this treatment, then you take a board whose length is about three cubits and dig in the wall that we said should be near the patient a place into which the end of the board is inserted, then you place the middle of the board on the hump, and the physician places his feet on the other end and pulls well until he presses the vertebra and it returns to its place.	But if it does not go back under this treatment then let a board be taken, about three cubits long, and let a place be hollowed out in the wall, which, as we said, should be near the patient, into which you put the end of the board; then place the mid-point of the board upon the hump, and he—the doctor—should place both his feet on the other end and strongly thrust upon the spine until it is forced back into position.	0.89545166
Then you tighten the bandage that you tightened on the patient's chest in the screw that is at his head, and the bandages that you tightened on his legs in the screw that is at his feet.	Then bind the wrapper that you have bound round his chest to the shaft at the patient's head, and those bound round his legs to the shaft at his feet.	0.9117632
Then an assistant stands at each screw, turning his hand with the turner with which the screw is twisted, and the physician straightens the hump as we have described.	Then have an assistant standing at each shaft to turn with his hand the handle by which the shaft is revolved, while the doctor straightens out the curvature in the way we have described.	0.9072511
And this is a picture of the screw, the bench, and the patient:	This is the figure of the winch, the bench and the patient.	0.72443783
Then, after the vertebra returns and the place becomes level, it is necessary to apply the dried dressing with egg white. Then the scarification. Then you place over the dressing a splint from a board whose width is three fingers or so, and its length is as much as it takes up the place of the hump and on some of the correct vertebrae.	After the spine has been restored and the place has been straightened it will be necessary for you to apply an absorbent plaster with egg-white, then packing, then over the plaster apply a flat splint about three fingers wide and long enough to cover the site of the curvature and several sound vertebrae on either side.	0.773636
Then it is tied with the appropriate bandage, and the patient uses light food until he recovers.	Then let it be bandaged as is needful and let the patient follow a mild diet until he is cured.	0.82185966
If some protrusion remains in the place at the end of the healing, it is necessary to use the medicines that relax and soften, along with the use of the board that we described for a long time. And a sheet of lead may be used for that.	If after he is healed there still remains some prominence at the site, it will be necessary to employ remedies to relax and soften the parts, together with the use for a long time of the flat splint we described; in this case a leaden plate may be employed.	0.8228054
And a protrusion may appear at the end of the vertebrae of the back, and it is thought to be a dislocation, and it is an extra bone that has protruded, so do not treat it with this treatment, for death may occur.	Sometimes there occurs a prominence at the end of the dorsal vertebrae, from which one may form the opinion that there is a dislocation, whereas it will be a superfluous bone that has become prominent; do not interfere with it by this treatment, for death may result.	0.77355933
