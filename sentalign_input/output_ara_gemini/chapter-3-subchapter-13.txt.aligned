The metacarpus and phalanges of the fingers rarely suffer fractures, but they are frequently subject to contusions.	Fractures of the metacarpus and of the small bones of the fingers very rarely occur; the only frequent occurrence is contusion.	0.81372523
When a fracture or contusion occurs in the hand, the patient should sit cross-legged with a chair of equal height in front of him, then place his outstretched hand on it. Then, an assistant should extend the broken bones, and the physician should align them until they are well-joined. At that point, a bandage and a splint should be applied if there is no hot swelling.	When a fracture or crushing of the palm of the hand occurs the patient should sit cross-legged with a chair of the right height in front of him, on which he should put his outstretched hand. Then an assistant is to extend the broken bones while the doctor straightens them so as to achieve a proper union.	0.89552534
Then a splint, the size of the affected area, should be applied on top, having been inserted into a soft cloth.	Then a plaster and a dressing should be applied, if an effusion do not occur; then a splint over that, measured to the site and wrapped in a soft cloth.	0.63433707
If the fracture is downwards towards the palm of the hand, make something like a ball from a piece of cloth and instruct the patient to grasp it with his fractured hand.  Then, tie it with a long cloth, and let the splint be made of supple leather so that the leather conforms to the flexion of the entire hand, and tighten it as needed.	If the fracture be lower down, near the inner part of the palm of the hand, make a ball of cloth, bid the patient grip on it with the fractured palm of his hand, and then bind it up with a long bandage. The splint should be of leather that is somewhat soft, so as to fit into all the folds of the palm; and bandage it on suitably.	0.8735634
If the fracture is outwards, you should apply a splint from above and another splint from below in the hand so that the hand remains open and straight. Then apply the bandaging as the hand turns and connect between the fingers with the bandage.	But if the fracture be on the outside you will have to put one splint above and another beneath the palm of the hand, to keep the hand opened and straight; then put on the bandage, carrying it round the hand and in and out between the fingers.	0.85657954
