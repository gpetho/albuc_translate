Oh, sons, I have now completed this book, which is the latest of the science of medicine, for the completion of which I have placed my trust in you, and for your exposure, and for your affirmations, it is to me that I must explain that I have composed this treatise for you, which is part of my art, that is, surgery.
For our time and region, surgery is a perilous art, so that its science is almost lost; and its vestiges are only a few short descriptions in the books of the Ancients, which change everything and remove the greatest part of the errors and hesitation that were previously in them, since they clarify the understanding of the art and extend its force and power
And it is evident to me that I have composed this treatise in such a way as to follow the order of the exposition and the declaration, and to abbreviate; and in order that it should follow the forms of the instruments of cautery and other instruments of the work as well as for the addition of the declaration, and for the preparation of the matter which is necessary.
The greatest cause why no wise man in our time can perform a perfect operation with his hand in this our age, is that the art of medicine is long, and that it covers a wide range of actors, since it includes the exercise of the science of anatomy, in which Gualius excelled, knowing how to manage the limbs and their forms, and how to join and separate them; and to have knowledge of bones, nerves, and vessels, and their number, and their extraction; and of the pulse veins and the location of their insertions.
And as Hippocrates said, “I have no name,” for in small works I have no name, and in the art of the hand I have no name.
Indeed, as it has already been said at the beginning of this book, whoever is not learned in anatomy will fall into error, and will cause the death of men, for I have seen many of these, since they are formed in this science and depart from this science and these experiments
For I have seen a foolish doctor who, being unskilled, has incised an abscess of the scrotum in the groin of a woman, and has cut some veins of the groin so that the woman died between her legs.
And I have seen another doctor who thought that he could extract a stone from a man’s bladder which had been present in his belly, and the stone was large, and he brought it to him and cut that stone out with a piece of the vein, so that the man died three days later
And I have already mentioned this, and I saw that because of the greatness of the stone and the condition of the patient I knew that he would die
And I have seen another doctor who took money from a duke from our land for surgery, and he was indebted to a black slave who was his servant, and he fractured the thigh of the slave, and in his ignorance prepared the doctor to cut the fracture, above the wound, with sponges and bandages with great tension, and he did not allow the wound to breathe air
And thus I forbade him according to his desires, and I rebuked him, and I left him for several days and commanded that he be taken away; and thus the thigh was left without any dressing, and the patient died of sepsis
And I went to appeal to him, and I found that he had taken off the bandage, and there was peace and quiet and an end to his pain.
But indeed corruption had already begun in the limb, for I was unable to restrain it, and I did not cease to circulate corruption in the limb until the patient was in danger of death
And I have seen another doctor who performed an operation on a cancerous abscess, and caused ulcers immediately in several days, so that the malice of the disease increased with the master of the disease.
The cause of this is that black bile is pure melancholy humor, and it does not suffice to overcome it with all your might, but that you must take care of the limb in which the disease is to be treated so that it is a host to all things
And therefore, son, it is necessary for you that the art of the hand be divided into two divisions: that is, in the art which is associated with health, and in the art which is perilous in the greatest precautions
And I have already spoken of this in all places of this book concerning the art in which there is error and fear; for it is necessary for you to guard against these things and to leave them behind, so that the fools do not find fault with you or reproach you
Therefore take up the sacred arms in request for God's help, and the sacred sick in your care with charity and compassion.
Use the best way possible for God's grace to save and praise, lay aside the terrible diseases of difficult healing, and take up the sacred arms of those things that you fear, so that your salvation may rest in your faith and in your name, for it is your duty to return to your glory, and more so in heaven and on earth among the saints.</end_of_turn>
Indeed we have already spoken in several places about this matter: “There is no medicine for a bad disease, for so the learned doctors will not be called liars”.
And I have already had to write this book according to three chapters.</end_of_turn>
Begin the division of the book, and first of all the first part.</end_of_turn> The first chapter ordered from the head downwards, concerning the forms of instruments and the preparations of cautery, and of what is necessary for the operation.</end_of_turn
The division of the second part.</end_of_turn The second chapter, concerning swelling and perforation, and windings, and plagues, and the extraction of arrows, and similar matters, all categorized and ordered according to the forms of instruments.</end_of_turn
The third chapter, concerning restoration and dislocation, and treatment of twists and similar matters; ordered from the head downwards, and concerning the forms of instruments.</end_of_turn
Since I have said what is the quality of the judgment of that cautery and its documents, and in what case it is prohibited to cauterize.</end_of_turn
Therefore I say that the sermon on the quality of the judgment of the cautery and its documents is a long and profound one, subtle for science, and a secret hidden; and already many learned men have spoken of it, and they disagree with each other, and to me it seems that a little of their sermons is enough, fearing an extension.</end_of_turn
Therefore I say that cautery conforms to all universal completion except for two completions, which are caudal completions of its matter.</end_of_turn
In the caudal and dry completion of the matter there will be disagreement; for some say that cautery is useful in that, and others say the opposite, that cautery is not convenient in the disease because of its quality and dryness, for the nature of fire is quality and dryness, and it is inconvenient that the disease be dry and cold with that which is cauterized and dry, because it is healed.</end_of_turn
And I say that those who say the opposite, that for cautery is useful in every cold and dry disease that occurs in the bodies of men, because when you compare the body of a man with the humidity of his members to the completion of fire, you find the body of a man cold.
And I say concerning this sermon that I have already experienced this several times.</end_of_turn
But I do not say that everything that has been said about cautery in this chapter should be abandoned and forgotten, because it has been exercised and practiced in many other chapters, and because you must know the diversity of the qualities of men and the disposition of diseases in their own places, and the causes of these, and their accidents, and the space of time of these.</end_of_turn
But in other completions it is not about you to fear, and especially in cold and humid diseases, for already all doctors agree on that, and they do not disagree in the usefulness of cautery in those.</end_of_turn
And know, children, that the secret of the treatment of cautery with fire and the goodness of it, is about cautery with acute medicine, for the fire is simple, the action of which does not reach beyond the member which is cauterized, and does not notice the other member adjacent to it except for a small document.</end_of_turn
For the action of acute medicine reaches only that part of the member where it is applied, and does not cause any great change in the member that is being healed, which is of great benefit in the member that has a difficult healing.</end_of_turn
For the fire, by its smallness and its goodness, does nothing else except superfluous. And it is known to us by experiment and by the length of our service in the art concerning the truth of the causes; and for this reason I am excused for the length of this sermon, for it is not fitting for me to reveal this secret of yours concerning fire to anyone, and the quality of its operation in the bodies and the expulsion of its seed, which is philosophical and has been demonstrated, is sufficient in the former parts of this book.</end_of_turn
Wise son, children, that they disagree in the time when it is convenient to make incisions and pause the best time of spring.
And I say that incisions are convenient at all times, so that it does not harm at the time of an accident when it is immersed in the benefit of that which makes the incision, more so if the incision is for pain or necessary pain, strong and painful, which do not suffer from delay so that it is feared from those who come with malice, which is greater than a small entering for the time.</end_of_turn>
And I say that we will not stay in other matters, or children, that it does not please but the vulgar people and foolish doctors, so that at that disease that is cured by incision is not ridiculous at all times, and to pause that consequence.</end_of_turn>
And the cause is not less that they say, for incision is nothing but in place of medicine which alters the composition and dries the humors which are the cause of these pains.</end_of_turn
More indeed incision exceeds medicine by request for the value and virtue of its operation and greatness of the Lord's mercy.</end_of_turn>
And it is possible that your disease will return at some time of the day, according to the composition of the disease and the location of the disease, and the virtue of them, and what is prepared in the body from the collection of superfluities in it, and what is obtained in it from the acquisition in food and the like of those causes; but if the disease in which the incision is administered is a subtle disease of a few superfluities and humors, as for example an incision for pain, and the like of that, it is possible that in it that pain will not return, even though it is done in small doses.</end_of_turn
And it may be said vulgarly that incision is the last remedy of medicine, and it is a treacherous saying, not to which I agree, for I believe that it is not a cure that improves upon medicine or any other cause except incision itself.</end_of_turn
And the cause is on the contrary of this; and the understanding that incision is the last remedy of medicine is true only when they administer the methods of treatment in certain diseases, and those medicines do not confer, and in the end of the cause they administer manes of incision, and they take advantage of that.</end_of_turn And indeed it is sixteen hours since I said that incision is the last remedy of medicine, not according to the understanding which the vulgar people and fools of the doctors have.</end_of_turn
I say to them the ancients that incision with gold is better than incision with iron, and I do not say this except for the equality of gold and the fineness of its substance.</end_of_turn
I say that the place of incision does not make a madman, as it is not absolutely true, for I have already seen that it does not make much difference whether it is done with gold or with iron, since in both cases the other parts suffer in the same way; however, incision with gold is better than incision with iron, as they say; but indeed when you make an incision with fire with gold, it is not your will that determines the degree of the fire, for it is ignited according to the quantity you wish for the brilliance of the gold, and you must prepare to receive the heat; and if you adjust over it with fire, the gold is consumed by the fire, and in the fire some scales are left behind because the artificer cuts for the occupation of that.</end_of_turn
And for this reason incision with iron must be performed more gently and cautiously in relation to the rectification of the operation.
And I have already ordered this chapter on incision according to chapters, and I have ordered those from the head downwards, so that I may satisfy those who demand from me what they wish.</end_of_turn>
The first chapter.</end_of_turn>
This cauterization confers to cold and humidity the accidental service of the things from which these two causes arise, so it is the cause of soda and multiple flow of nervous humor, swelling of the belly, of the head to the feet and of the armpits fluid, and multiple sleep, and toothache and headache, and universally of any disease that comes from cold, even as paralysis, tetanus and apoplexy, and it is similar in these diseases.</end_of_turn
The way of this cauterization is this, that first of all it commands the patient to be evacuated with medical laxatives the head moderately modified, for three or four nights, according as you exceed the virtue of the disease and the age and custom of it.</end_of_turn
And I command him to shave the hair of the head with a razor, and I make him do that between your thighs on a fallen bench and that you place your hand over your feet.</end_of_turn
And immediately stop the progression of your palm towards the root of your nose between your eyebrows. However, when the pain in the limb is severe, the doctor must touch the affected area with the cautery to make an incision. This is the form of the olive oil that the physician must use for this purpose:
And immediately stop that above the joint that is being tormented, in such a way that it descends, so that your hand is slightly constricted, and you rotate that
Then gently lift your hand slightly and support the limb, and if you see already some quantity of blood escaping, as much as the quantity of barley grains, then elevate your hand, and if you do not turn your hand towards that area, towards the other side, if it is cold, stay there until it has dried out as much as I have said to you.
And take a little salt and dissolve it on the limb and leave it on for three days.
And immediately stop over the knee bent in the border and leave it on until the burn of the fire is destroyed And take care of the limb until it is healed with four medicines.
And I have already said that when the plague remains open, take two measures: for it is better and more useful
And I say to you that the bone must be cauterized until the bone itself, and that it must be held until no part of the substance of the bone is left.
And immediately put on that which is close to the bone, and immediately cure it.
And I say that it must be cauterized towards the heel, so that when it is burned in the bone it will break, rather than that the bone breaks from the heat of the cautery. This is the form of small alphecation: And they estimate that from that limb the vapor of the head escapes.
And if the plague remains open for a long time, and immediately cure it when it is solidified
I do not see these two methods of cautery in all my life, except in fools for fear; and leave that, you must know, is better for health than to burn, because the head is developed by the solution of continuity of the limbs as we have testified in other members, and more especially when the head of the disease is of cold nature.
The first method of cautery is better and more useful for you; and from that I have seen and from this work I know that it is healthier.

Of the cautery of the head.
When in all the head there occurs chronic and long-lasting pain and that which is in the disease is prolonged, and you use cloths and cushions and caps and plasters and mustard and vinegar and garlic and barley and alum and others, and especially if it has already been cauterized with a cautery that accounts for it and does not profit from it for any of those causes, then consider that if the head of the disease is of strong constitution in its nature; and it is not cold or otherwise finds little heat, then you should cauterize with another cautery leaving a little space. And immediately cauterize that on the heel of the foot with the cautery until the bone is split Cut the bone and uncover from the bone the quantity that we have recounted and cauterize that with a cautery in the posterior part of the head in the area where it is affected by wind, — and that is the area where the wind is stopped. And take your hand away in support, and do not uncover the bone, for the disease because of that will find great pain different from the pain of all the other cauteries of the head
I say this cautery in this place, because it covers that with which I cauterize the toes and the occiput is more subtle than that with which I cauterize the middle part of the head; and this is its form
End of document
Of the cautery of ancient emigration.
When inside the head there is soft pain, or widespread pain within the heel, evacuate immediately with medicines the head with its monifications, and administer the other treatment which I have mentioned in the preceding sections of diseases; and all this without profit, for the cautery in this case is done in two ways: either with acute medications that burn, or with the cautery
Better is the cautery with medications that burn than to take a dose of alum, to scald it and remove the extremities of both heads And then prick the area of pain in the temple with a lancet as far as it goes without showing the cord, until it is hidden.
And then keep pressure on it for a while to relieve the pain, and leave it for three hours; then remove the dressing and take off the bandage, and leave the wound covered for two or three days, and keep your hand over it until the pain subsides.
And then take care of it until it is healed
And if you wish, know that there are many medicines that can combat these, which I have written about in the treatise on medicinal treatments
May the cautery be carried out according to this manner: fire for cautery of this kind: ...
... and the handle of the cautery is shaped like a nail, with a head like a nail in which there is a small prominence in the middle part
Then place your hand over the area of pain, and hold your hand — so that the cautery does not burn the skin — and move the iron slowly back and forth.
And if the amount of blood that is burned by the cord is great, as much as half, elevate your hand so that the artery is not burned, so that there is no obstruction of blood flow
Then immerse the wound in salt water and place it over the area, and leave it for three days; then remove the dressing and cover the wound with a bandage, and take care of it until it is healed
And if you wish, cauterize at the tip of the toe according to the cautery, and keep the incision of the artery in this way without prejudice to its antiquity.

Of cautery of ancient embolism.</start_of_turn>
When you have cured the embolism as we have said in the preceding treatment, and as we have said in the divisions of the diseases, and you do not avail yourself of the treatment, and sometimes because of the disease that does not reach that which we have said of the first cautery with medicine or the cautery with fire, then cover the cautery of the toe until it is whitened, because it signifies over the area of pain along the line of length of which is the majority of the finger, or whatever; and withdraw your hand for a moment and hold it down when you are incising the artery so that you do not reach the bone.</start_of_turn>
But it is necessary that you take care of the continuity of the mandible, which is harmful for chewing, and that the nerve is not burned and that no spasm occurs.
And if it is about the custody and care of the flow of blood of the abseced artery, which is dangerous, and more so to that one who ignores what it does and is not careful; leave the operation in it from the beginning.</start_of_turn
And I remind you of the regimen for the flow of blood concerning the incision according to the custom of this book.</start_of_turn
And if you see this disease that does not benefit from this cautery and you see the body of the patient tolerable, cauterize that in the middle part of the head as we have recounted, and care for the wound until it is healed.</start_of_turn
And if you wish, administer the cautery which we have said in the chapter on the stretching of the artery with two hooks, and this is a better cautery and safer.</start_of_turn
Chapter five.</start_of_turn
Of cautery of the pains of the heel.</start_of_turn
When in the heel there is pain from cold and is cured by means of lacative causes and by the other treatment which I have mentioned in the division, and the pain is not relieved, then ignite the cautery, which is called puncture, of which this is the form: ...
And then prick around the area with the ignition, and be careful around the entire heel as if it were rotating, or in the area of some nerve if the pain is in some area.</start_of_turn Slowly move the cautery along the edge of the heel without causing excessive pain.</start_of_turn
And if the cautery has pierced the heel in ten points, and what is that, and then care for the wounds until they are healed.</start_of_turn

Burn with cautery.
When the burn is complete, and the cautery is not to be repeated, except for the species which cause swelling, as we have said in the division of diseases.
Avoid burning the area which must remain dry or which is affected by a spasm of the nerves
When you have cured that kind of swelling from its root and from its head, and from its belly, and you have confirmed your cure, then cover the painful area with three cauteries: one at the root of the nail, the second at a little distance from the middle, and the third at the junction of the two lips.
And leave the cautery on the painful area for the opposite of the diseased part, so that the burn does not extend further than the area that has healed.
The method of cautery is that you burn with a pointed cautery at the root of the nail somewhat above the nail head, and in the middle another, the length of which should be according to the length of the finger, and withdraw your hand from the burn until the amount of the burn of the species of the code is consumed
And this is the way of cautery, and it is the species of the surgeon, the shape of which is like a knife with a flat blade More gentle, however, is to make a few small incisions; and cover that more than with excessive thickness of dressing
And take care of the area around the burn until it has healed.
End of treatment.
Of ancient cautery for apoplexy.
When the apoplexy is ancient and the patient has not had a fever, then burn with four cauteries: on all four nail heads; on the inside and outside of the head around the ear, as we have said; and on the eyebrow The way of performing the cautery is sufficient as we have said
The burn has already been done on the mouth of the stomach; more is not necessary; and take care of the patient until recovery takes place
End of treatment of ancient apoplexy
Of cautery for sudden pain caused by inflammation
Cover the patient with a warm blanket at the beginning and give her medicinal pills to prevent chills.
And quickly cover the whole head of the patient and withdraw your hand from the area around the burn as described in the treatise on plasters
And withdraw from any other cautery, as this is the way to burn And do this as we have already said
Therefore if these are well; and if not, then burn three times on the back of the nail of the head, which are the most elevated parts of the head towards the back of the head And withdraw between each burn the thickness of the finger, and take care of the burn until it has healed
If you are addicted and the patient can tolerate it, burn in the middle of the head; if you wish to increase the addiction, burn over the two nails.
Take care of the area until it has healed; and the burn should be done with olive oil according to the shape which has been said.
End of treatment of sudden pain caused by inflammation
Of cautery of boils and mollification of all the body
Cover the head of the patient with a blanket and with water as we have said; then quickly cover the head of the patient, and burn on the middle of the head, on all the nails of the head, on the back of the head, and on three places on the vertebrae of the spine
If necessary in the disease of mollification of the body of the tropics, that is when the patient is tolerant and the disease is violent, then burn four times on the vertebrae of the pelvis, and then withdraw your hand until the burn is consumed by the code, and hold the hand away from the area Take care of the area until it has healed, and do the burn with olive oil

It is not cauterized except that which is for flexibility.
Therefore modify the head of the limb from the beginning towards the end and towards the other treatment which we have dictated in the division when the illness is great and it tolerates the exclusion of medicines.
And if it is a child who does not suffer from the medicines, then give safeguards and masticators to serve him, giving him this for several days, for the benefit of the food
Then remove the head of the illness, and then cauterize that which is like a pointed cautery in the middle of the head according to the manner mentioned above, and on every corner of the head you shall cauterize And if the illness is strong and it tolerates, then cauterize that which we have said, having paralyzed and softening the body over the vertebrae of the thigh and the vertebrae of the buttocks

Then remove the head of the illness, and then make a descending twist about the circle, and then stop that in the middle of the head.</end_of_turn

And give him to drink every day for a week a little while, with the other regulation of the body until he is healed; or if you wish, cauterize that which makes little points according to the best of him, but keep your hand over his head in such order: this is a kind of cautery which moistens the head equally.</end_of_turn>

Incisions must be made over all the veins and arteries which are left by the coccyx; and let the cauteries be made in that length in the latitude of the temples.</end_of_turn

Chapter XIII.
When tears of the humors are ancient, they are retained in the veins and arteries which are manifested on the surface of the head, and it is confirmed that these are superfluous fiery phlegmas. Therefore, when we have recounted in the chapter on the commencement of water the cautery which we must perform on the head, as well as in the middle of the head and on both sides of the head, we must make two cauteries on the temples and two cauteries on the nape of the neck. And if you wish to add more, the cautery is made on the whole breadth of the heel towards the outer edge of the nail with a small cautery.
Chapter XIV
Of the cautery of the stench of the nose
When your physician has said enough and has not benefited from your medicine, you must appear and give the patient to drink for three nights; then raise his head, and cauterize the middle of the nose with olive oil And cauterize the claw with two cauteries on the two nails, leaving a little space between them.
Beware of the thread that you do not burn that.
This is how you must cauterize the claw.<end_turn>
Chapter XV
Of the cautery of the softening of the eyelids of the humors.
When the eyelid of the humor is softened by disease or humidity, then cauterize that eyelid with a lunar cautery; this is the way to do it:
And if you like, cauterize over the two eyebrows a little with two cauteries throughout, and let them extend from the temples. Let the length of each cautery be according to the quantity of the eyebrow
And do not press too much your hand on the cautery, but according to the quantity that the third part of the eyelid is adhered
Chapter XVI
Of the cautery of the eyelid of the humor when it has become converted to the parts of the pupil and pressing it down
When the pupils of the humor are converted to the parts of the pupil and pressing down, cauterize in two ways, either by burning or by medicinal means that consume.
If you cauterize with fire, command the patient to drink until the pupils dilate as much as those which are seen to dilate from the wind; and if you press down, put a bandage over their eyes so that it does not burn them until the pupils are born anew
Therefore, when they are born anew and equal, then stop the head of the patient in the belly and bring your hand over the eyelids of the humors of the patient with a tremor, in the manner of a dead fern leaf, and let the sign begin at the pupils
And finally rest for a moment in the warmth of blood or in mucus on the humors.
This is the way to perform the cautery
And cauterize over the figure which you have signed, little by little, in mossy veils, until the surface of the code is as much like a dead fern leaf as possible, throughout.
The sign of completion of your work is that you see the pupil of the humor already contracting and the pupils of the humors being elevated beyond the puncture of the humor
Therefore elevate your hand and leave it there for three days, and then rest over it with a border until the scar is healed And take care of it until it is healed
However, if it returns for any reason, then press down again and the pupil is softened, then perform the cautery once more over the whole thing as you did at first
However, if the pupils are in the eyelid, then cauterize that only when it has been raised to its natural height and is equal, and that the pupils do not press down on the humor
However, this is done with medicinal means, for which you command the patient to drink until the pupils dilate as much as those which are seen to dilate from the wind, and you should apply a piece of sponge in the shape of a dead fern leaf
And take from the patient's throat some saliva with a spoon, and mix with a little vinegar. And take from the patient's throat some saliva with a spoon, and mix with a little vinegar. Or take from that what is there and mix them well together, and do so with fasting, so that it does not become cold; and expand with this over the paper which is to be made like a leaf of ivy, and place that over the one or both; and place your hand over the head of the patient so that the head does not move around in the vomit.
And place your hand over the medicine and do not move it until the patient feels the bitterness of the medicine, for the bitterness is in them just like fire
And when you perceive that the other bitterness has ceased, then read the medicine and do not touch it until I tell you to do so; and when the bitterness has ceased, then remain the medicine and wash the hand over the wound with vinegar; and then consider whether sometimes the eyelid has already been raised just like it is washed away by the constriction of fire or incision, for this is good; and if it does not return from the medicine on the place where it was not pressed, and it does not yield until the operation is completed and the hand is healed.
And remain over the hand at the border until the redness of the swelling has passed away, and care for that until it is completely healed or until it is healthy
And it is necessary for you, after your operation, to keep an eye with diligence that the medicine does not fall from the head, and if the eyelid is somewhat softened in these days or if there is any cause for the hand to swell, then repeat your medicine on that place where the eyelid is softened, just as you did at the beginning, and continue until it is healed
This is the form of ivy leaf.
You know that the humors of men are diverse according to their magnitude and their smallness, and therefore according to what is useful for your contraction.
And do not be ashamed of the way things are done in this art.<end_turn>

Of cautery for fistula that is in the tear duct of the eye.</start_turn
When you are treating a fistula with that which we have said in the divisions of the diseases and you do not confer your care, then you must know that you must cauterize that according to this manner: command the patient to keep their head still, and keep their head of their body between their thighs in such a way that it is neither moved nor agitated on the head cap.<end_turn
And then keep the hand covered in vinegar or in mucus over the eye.
And then take the cautery which is of this shape:
which is hooked, like a hook or a penknife, from one extremity to the other of that which is to be cauterized.<end_turn
And if you will, penetrate through to the other extremity.<end_turn And if you wish, do the same as with a hook.</start_turn
Better is the cautery that is hooked to the side.
And then press the fistula if it is open, and bring healing to it and dry that out.</start_turn And if it is not open, then open that and extract the pus from it.</start_turn
And then keep the cautery away from the eye which is well ignited, and touch the eye with a little of the cautery from the side of the nose, so that you do not move your hand or that the patient becomes frightened, and then keep the cautery over the eyeball and remove that.</start_turn
And therefore if at the beginning of the treatment the cautery penetrates the bone, it is not good; and if so, repeat the cautery once or twice if necessary; and leave that for three days, and then keep the hand over that border and keep the eye dry until it is healed.</start_turn
If it has been more than twenty days and it is not healed, then leave over the acute corrosive medicine until the bone is exposed and is scraped as it is convenient in the chapter above.</start_turn
And another manner of cautery for fistula which we will say at the beginning: enter the place of the fistula and make that, and then keep your hand over that split of the bone which is the shape of it: and put in that the quantity of one or two drops of lead melted; and keep your hand well pressed against the good retention, and do not be frightened by the patient because of the lead which is not to reach the eye; and cover that the eye of the patient is covered with vinegar or water, because the lead adheres to the place of the fistula and heals that in a miraculous way.</start_turn>
If the fistula has healed with the cautery and dressing described above, it is not necessary; otherwise, it is necessary to administer medicine through the nose and reduce the fistula to the root of the nose as appropriate.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
The fistula has healed with the cautery.
Blisters appear on the lips, and more frequently in children's lips
Therefore, when you have cured those fissures with the medicine that we have mentioned in the instructions, and you have not benefited from your treatment, it is necessary to make a small incision as follows:
And make the incision following the curvature of the nail
Then stop that bleeding immediately in those fissures until the cautery reaches the root of the fissures
And take care of that until it heals properly.

Treatment of fistula in the mouth
When there is swelling of the uvula or palate or teeth, and the swelling breaks, becomes old, and pus comes out, and there is a fistula, and you have treated it but without benefit, then it is necessary to cauterize the fistula according to the quantity of pus received in the fistula. Then put the cautery into the nose of the fistula and keep your hand over it until the fire reaches the root of the fistula. And after that, do whatever is necessary to make an opening or two. And take care of that until it heals properly
And therefore if the swelling is abscesses and is healed, it is not necessary; otherwise, it is necessary to uncover the root and remove the corrupted bone as appropriate

Treatment of teeth and softening of veins
When veins are softened by humidity and teeth are blackened, and you have treated them with medicines without benefit, then it is necessary to place the tip of the instrument in the groin and make an incision of the shape you deem appropriate. While you are doing this, hold the hand over the tooth until the fire of the cautery reaches the root of the tooth.
And take your hand away, and make the incision several times as you wish
And keep the patient's mouth filled with salt water and leave it there for an hour, and then remove it, because the blackened tooth is stopped and the softened gum is strengthened and the corrupted humidity is dried up

Treatment of toothache
When the toothache is due to cold, or if it is cold or hot, or if the treatment with medicine does not help, it is necessary to cauterize in two ways: either with a cold cautery or with a burning cautery
The cold cautery is that you take the edge of a cow's hoof and make a hole in the bottom of a metal spoon, and then put your thumb over the end of the handle, and plunge that into the tooth that aches without delay
And make several incisions until the heat of the fire reaches the root of the tooth
Or if you wish, immerse a sponge or cloth in the broth that you have mentioned, and place that over the painful tooth, and keep the fire ignited until the fire reaches the curvature of the tooth
But the burning cautery must be used with caution, and you must take care that the fire does not reach the patient's mouth or cause them any damage.
And make the incision of the shape you deem appropriate, and keep your hand over the tooth until the cautery is cooled; and make several incisions so that the pain may disappear or at least diminish on that day or the next day
And take care that after the cautery the patient fills their mouth with good blood and leave it for an hour and then remove it; this is the way to cauterize
And cauterize where you wish most, as you are able.
This is the way of the needle: ...

Of the cautery of external swellings
When swellings are caused by inflammation and cold humors and do not yield to medicines, then you should burn them away with a cautery. The way in which you should do this is as follows: place two extremities under the swelling so that the smoke from the cautery will not reach the other extremity. Keep the flame away from the area surrounding the swelling with a gauze, and do not remove the dressing until the swelling has disappeared.
And if the swelling is small, then keep the cautery away from it according to the size of the swelling. Keep it covered for three days and do not remove the dressing until the swelling has subsided and all that the fire has consumed has disappeared
And take care of the wound, the bandaging and the cloth until it is healed

Of the cautery of the root of the tongue and the constriction of the throat
When humidity is over the root of the tongue, and especially when it is of cold composition, then you must evacuate the patient with laxatives at the beginning and then cauterize the area under the tonsil in the groove below it
And take care that you do not reach the tonsil with the cautery or that you do not burn the edge of the tongue but only a little bit
And cauterize the area beyond the cautery of the joint of the jaw with the last vertebra of the neck. The cautery of the jaw should be carried out in the same way as before

Of the cautery of the pulmonary disease and cough
When cough and pulmonary disease are caused by cold humors and the patient has neither fever nor inflammation and is an old disease, then you must make two cauteries on the furcula in the depressed areas under the tonsils; and another cautery in the middle of the foot between two nipples; and the cautery should be carried out as before
And if you wish, make the puncture of the cautery as is usually done for the puncture of heel pain. The way in which it is done is as described in the puncture of ankle pain
And take care of the surrounding area as has been said before until it is healed
And indeed, the cautery should not be made more than three times according to this fashion: make three cauteries in this way.

Of the cautery of the nipples which is the head of the assistant
When the head of the assistant is dislocated due to greasy humors and does not yield at the time of sleep, you must reduce the dislocation before it returns on its own, and in order to do this you must perform a slight movement so that it slips out; as we have learned from experience, you must first reduce the dislocation, and then bring the patient back to the position in which they were before, either sitting or lying down; and finally lift the chin so that the part which is at the bottom of the nipple is at the level of the parts above it on the left side, if the dislocation is at the bottom.
And take care that the cautery does not burn two nipples; and this is the way to do it
And cauterize the chin until it pierces the other side; and the figure of the cautery will be that of four nipples
And every bandage is adjusted according to this count and because there are eight cauteries
And take care that the cautery does not burn the skin with soot, and keep the patient calm, and do not move the limb for any time until it is comfortable
If dislocation has occurred in the joints above and below, and if it is caused by this, then cauterize over the Achilles muscle or the plantar muscle with a pointed cautery, so that the joint is confirmed and the humidity is dispersed and the pain is healed.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
The treatment involves cauterization of the stomach.
When there is cold and moist matter in the stomach that comes from the excess of its composition and multiplies the humors to it, and if you continue your methods of care without confirming it, then know that the pain must be above the navel, extend your hands and feet, and then cauterize with three cauteries: one on the sole of the foot for the amount of one finger above the Achilles muscle, and two on the sides of the cautery, until the triangular figure of the cautery appears; and stretch out the rest that are not adjusted, which will make the wound less painful.
And if the depth of the wound is equal to two-thirds of the breadth of the navel.
And the figure of the cautery should be as follows: [...] And if you wish, cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this figure; and this is a circular cautery according to this figure: [...]
And cauterize the stomach where it is sensitive to the cautery: and that you mark on the stomach the place where you wish to make the cautery, and then cauterize that point; and then care for that area with the care that precedes until it is healed

On cauterization of the fatty foot
When there is pain in the foot due to cold, moisture, or excessive wind, that normal fat from the belly is expelled by excessive evacuation, and the pain is cured as we have said without confirming it, then know that the pain must be above the navel, and mark with your finger three cauteries according to this figure and this quantity and apply them to the foot below the hipbones, holding the heel of the foot.
And the space between each cautery should be as wide as the thickness of a finger, and the cauteries should be as long as the breadth of the limb.
Do not tighten over the cauteries too much
And if the amount of liquid that is poured out is equal to the amount of the major part of the species of the navel, and it is not more adjusted; and if the pain is standing on the feet, then hold still, because you have already extended your cushions, and lift up the knees
And you can also cauterize these cauteries with a pointed cautery, when it is at your discretion and prudence in the art
And keep in mind that you must not process too much in the cautery, and that the species of the whole navel must be cauterized so that the whole limb is cauterized and reaches the intestines, because the navel here is subtle; and be careful.

On the perforation of the abscess of the foot with a cautery
When there is an abscess or swelling in the foot and you want to know if that abscess is in the flesh of the foot or in the membrane of it, then if it is in the flesh of the foot, the pain is severe and the swelling is acute
And if it is in the membrane of the foot, with great pain which often makes the doctors despair of its cure
Therefore know that the pain must be raised above the navel; and mark the place of the abscess with your finger; and then burn the cautery that is assembled like felt, as its shape is described in the other page And cauterize until all the limb is covered, until it reaches the hip bone, until it is completely healed
And take care of the other abscesses until they are healed.</start_of_turn>
And do not use this method of cautery except for those who have studied it in the art of medicine and who know many other methods; for in these cases some experiments have been made which show that it is useful in this operation, but nevertheless read what you must about it, for it is more prudent

From cautery of the foot.
Say the old physicians of the ancient times cauterized the foot according to this manner: take a dry splinter of aristeology of a length equal to that of the thumb and as thick as the great toe.
And immerse that in oil and burn that at the fire, and cauterize with a pointed cautery in that place which is between the continuation of the collarbone and the ribs; and with two small cauteries let two guides go, one slightly declining towards the part that is beyond the beard, and two cauteries in that which is declining between the fifth rib and the twelfth, slightly declining towards the back; and another cautery in the middle of the foot; and another on the stomach; and three cauteries on the back; and a fourth cautery in that place which is between the two buttocks, and two cauteries on the two sides of the foot, leaving the cautery which is between two buttocks.
And do not cover your hand with the cautery, but rather on the appearance of the wound on duty.
And indeed the old men say that these are the men who use cautery like a ray of iron and fire, and put that in that place which is between the ribs, until we reach that apostema and it is cured, just as we have said in the apostema of the foot.
Moreover in this perforation with the cautery let there be no fear, because much has happened in that fistula which has not been cured.
The king has ordered that this case be heard in the tribunal of the great physicians.
Of the cautery of the heel.
When you have cured the disease of the heel as we have said in the division, and you do not refer your care, then the cautery in it is done in three ways, which are all safe, namely that you make three or four incisions according to the length of the heel according to the figure of the cauteries of the foot, the figure of which has preceded.
And between each cautery let the thickness of a thumb or a little more, and the manner of the cautery should be the manner which we have said in the cautery of the foot equally.
And do not cover your hand with the cautery; and the patient should be even over the seat of two.
And another manner of cauterizing is that you ignite the cautery having two assistants, which cause we have said in the chapter of dislocation of the muscle, and elevate the limb which is at the end of the heel towards the belly of the patient without causing the patient pain on the left side.
And let your elevation be such as to elevate the limb according to the length of the limb, so that both cauteries are made according to the width of the body
And immediately insert the two assistants, ignite more, in that place where we have pierced the limb of the other part.
And immediately remove the cautery; and thus there are four cauteries in total
And if you wish, cauterize with three assistants
And let your care be longer than usual for a few days, because it is different from the other preceding causes in the care
The king has ordered that this case be heard in the tribunal of the great physicians
Of the cautery of hydropic swelling
The cautery does not suffice in hydropic swelling but in alcinte properly
When you have cured the hydropic swelling as we have said in the division, and you do not refer your care, then the hour covers that four cauteries are made in the circumference of the belly and one on the stomach, and another on the foot, and another on the heel, and two between the vertebrae of the two, and one in the groin, and another on the stomach. And the quantity of the depth of the cautery should be proportionate to the thickness of the limb
And immediately put the cautery inside so that it gets stuck for a long time
And do not evacuate the disease from care along with the cautery because it is added to them two understandings, and if it is not held back it will be cured by the helper.
The instrument which is to cauterize the belly should be shaped like a claw, according to the shape of that which has gone before, and that which has the two olives following its shape.

About the cautery of the feet and the bowels.
When the feet are swollen with hydrosis and are filled with sour water, cover that you cauterize the feet over the two metatarsals without harming that which is between the heel and the little toe; and raise your hand over the cautery and do not twist it; and elevate your hand, and do not return it until the sour water has subsided.
It is like this: Place two cautery instruments over the two joints, and in any place where it is necessary to cauterize, do so at the tip of the cautery. And the cautery should be of the length of the joint: leave the nails and the other below the middle of the joint; and over each joint place two cautery instruments.
And leave the wound open for a long time so that any water that remains may come out.
And take care of the things which we have mentioned.

About the cautery of the body of the belly.
When the body of the belly is full of cold and humidity and the humors are within, so is the digestive and retaining virtue, which is in the stomach and in the intestines. And it is cured by the methods of treatment and does not cause harm; sometimes the patient suffers from excessive application of the virtue, for when the great cautery is made on the great stomach according to what has been said previously concerning the stomach, at the circle and with four cautery instruments around the subumbilical embolus, at the claw-shaped cautery; and over the navel with great care, or with two cautery instruments.
And sometimes when the external humors are excessive and the patient cannot tolerate it, then cauterize over the fifth space and over the intestines, and firmly adjust two cautery instruments over the stomach and below the flanks, which is perfect treatment for the evacuation of which there is no error.

And if you think that the stomach of the patient is congested and the food is not digested, and the face is sometimes pale, then cauterize that area over the great stomach according to what has been said previously; and one cautery instrument over the flank and another cautery instrument over the belly with a claw-shaped cautery, and leave the cautery in place for a while, and then take care of it so that it is healed.

When the heel abscesses, then cauterize with an instrument that is like a ray. And bring that fire close to the heel abscess and finish by placing your hand over that part until the cautery reaches the opening of the vein from which the blood escapes.
And make a mark or two, because if you achieve too many, then cauterize each one according to what has been said, and take care of them with that which has been said to prevent them from coming out until they are healed
And if you cauterize with great cautery over something, it is more painful in evacuation

About the cautery of fistulas that are naturally formed in the parts of the body
When nature does not obey the work that we have recommended in its place, and the patient is tormented by it, whether he is healthy or cauterized

Aprop igneys le cauteri que es semblant a ray. And apply the cautery lit with fire to the fistula, according to the degree of its tension
Repeat the process until the corrupt parts are consumed, a good bit or two or three, according to the degree of your need
Beware that you do not burn nerves or blood vessels; or if the fistula is in the bladder or the abdomen, take care of all the surrounding parts. Do not proceed until the fistula is in solid tissue and you suspect that it is not penetrating
Then care for the area until it is healed
If the area is sealed, and the material has been removed from it, and it is left undisturbed for a long time, then know that it has already healed entirely
If the material has not been removed from it, know that it is penetrating or in the root of it, or that it is corrupted, because these things will remind you of it in the area

And the manner of the cautery in this case is in two manners: either with cautery applied with medicines that combat, or with cautery applied with fire.
And according to two known methods, of which one is to cauterize that over the breadth of the limb with three triangular cauteries in this fashion; and do so with good depth.</end_of_turn> And concerning the space between each cautery and the quantity of thickness of the limb, let it be that of the breadth of the finger, and if the cautery is olive or great.</end_of_turn
And several physicians say that the cautery should be placed on the middle part of the limb over the head of the bone, for there are four cauteries.</end_of_turn>
And if you will, cauterize around the circumference which precedes the form of dislocation of the ankle, and which is a continuous circle and burns away the spiciness of the entire heel.</end_of_turn
And this is the manner of cautery in this case when the pain is adherent to the ankle and is not extended to the cavity.</end_of_turn>
And if it is extended to the cavity, then do cauterize that with two cauteries on the cavity over the area to which you send the patient which is the pain; and one cautery on the heel for four fingers a little beyond the wrist.</end_of_turn
And if the cautery burns, and the depth of the cautery is according to the quantity of spiciness of the heel.</end_of_turn
And if the patient sends that the pain is extended to the area beyond the toes, then do cauterize that here where you send with a cautery for three points or four or more if you deem it necessary.</end_of_turn
And if the patient sends that the pain is leaving the cavity, then do cauterize that here with a pointed cautery.</end_of_turn
And keep in mind in all cauterization that you do not reach the nerves or great arteries, and that for this reason you must be careful over the patient, lest you do them more harm than good.</end_of_turn
And I have already seen two of these who, having cauterized on the heel, ultimately finished with the limb swollen within that the tumor achieved the foot, and the limb perforated and corrupted all the way through.</end_of_turn And take a strong solution of vinegar, and also that you must be prepared for death.</end_of_turn
And if the pain is in two parts together, then cauterize each according to this manner.</end_of_turn
And the learned men say concerning the cautery of the ankle that the cautery should be like a circle of iron whose circumference is the measure of a palm; and its depth should be as deep as the seed of an olive or less.</end_of_turn
And draw that circle a third time; and let the space between them be the quantity of the nail of the thumb; and make those circles wide enough for two fingers, and let the length of those nails be a nail or two, and make in those grooves of iron adequately placed on the circles; and this is the form of them.</end_of_turn
Then let the fire be ignited in the firebox until it turns black and sparks appear, and let it be placed over the part of the ankle, the patient lying on his side.</end_of_turn And thus cauterize that with three cauteries surrounding in one go.</end>
And thus leave that for three days; then apply a plaster to that around the border and leave the wound open for several days; and take care of that until it is healed.</end>
The physicians say: or, children, of this kind of cautery we have used little because of the fear of its repercussions, and because few have found that which are beneficial for it.</end
And among the best cauteries for them is that which is applied to the place of the pain.</end
Better are the cauteries with medicines than those that remain, for you must make two circles having a pierced hole in which to insert the nail of the hoof; and let the length of the nail in the heel be two nails or as many as those.</end
And let the space between them be the quantity of the thickness of the finger; and make them wide enough from each other, and that they should contain each other according to this form.</end
Then rest on the part of the ankle the patient lying on his side, and compress your hand on the part of the ankle; and take cold water from two circles and put it between the two circles, and the quality of that water should be little by little, and keep that for the quantity of an hour, and suffer the patient the biting and the pain of the ankle — for that other biting is like that of fire — until the biting stops.</end

And take care of him until he is healed.</end_of_turn>
And if the pain extends into the groin or the thigh, make him sit in a position that contains water as much as is appropriate for the ankle swelling.</end_of_turn
This is the way of warm water, and I have already written about it in the treatise on the rectification of medicines.</end_of_turn> Recipe of alkali and caustic powder, neither of which is extinct, take one part of each, grind them and suspend them in a new liquid from which one part is perforated with a small hole according to the quantity that enters.</end_of_turn
And let the liquid of the other wave go out, and pour over that alkali and caustic powder alive with warm water which you take by a finger, and when you have grasped them with your thumb for a good compression, and let the remainder that comes from the acute water go out to the other wave.</end_of_turn
And adjust all that water, and take another caustic powder alive and another alkali renewed, so that the heat that remains will not be strong acute, which is administered in surgical operations of medicine and in cauterization of the other members, because this operation is of fire.</end_of_turn
And so of many medicines that are cauterized widely, some are done quickly and badly and others slowly and carefully; and caus with sulfur are added that they are mixed together.</end_of_turn
And here is the record of an old man from among the ancients who underwent an operation and treatment for pain in the ankle and sciatica, and praised its benefit so much that he said that no other treatment was necessary, and that he was healed by simply resting as recommended, for he found that that treatment was sufficient to heal that entanglement in the bath and indeed that it had already passed from that.</end_of_turn
And it is present in certain herbs, and if it is not found in the herbs, take recent fig, and do not grind it with too many grains, but leave it bound to the ankle in which the pain is, or in the groin or the thigh, and bind it.</end_of_turn
And leave it for the amount of three hours or for the amount that the patient can bear of the bruise.</end>
And so put that in the bath and when the body of the patient is tanned, take it out of the sun, for the pain ceases and he is healed.</end>
Remember that no one should use these medicines without the evacuation of the body.</end
Yes indeed, when there is a wound of a goat, the stretic vein is cauterized, and for this purpose it is taken wool and soaked in oil, and is placed between the tarsals of the foot and between the bones.</end
And take dry wound of a goat, burn it with fire until it is black; and then place it on the wool and let it rest until it is stretched out.</end And repeat this process, and do not stop until the sensation of the bite reaches the ankle and relieves the pain.</end

Therefore, take care, in the evacuation of the patient with pills that are fixed and similar to them, that they are useful over the two in which the pain is three lines according to the breadth of them, because it has to do with the attempt in any line or cauterize or otherwise, according to the quantity that comes from the patient’s tolerance and the virtue of them.</end

When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.</start_of_turn
And therefore when gout is caused by cold with skillful treatment and no remaining pain, the pain will remain cauterized.</start_of_turn
And that you burn around the evacuation near the joint of the foot with the previous cautery.</start_of_turn
And let the burn be like olive oil in this way:</start_of_turn
And if it is necessary to make points on the surface of the foot, then do so with a pointed cautery.</start_of_turn And if the pain rises within the bones or to the other joints, and when the swelling subsides, then burn over every pain with three or four cauteries of this olive oil throughout.</start_of_turn
And if more than these cauteries are necessary, then burn only as much as is necessary without damaging the skin too much, sending only the smoke away from the tip of the cautery.</start_of_turn
And if the pain persists in the bone and the two together, then administer the cautery mentioned in the previous chapter.</start_of_turn
And if the pain is only in the joints and is acute, then puncture in the circle of the nails just as if you were rotating, puncture in those two lines.</start_of_turn
And if the pain remains in these places, then puncture in the circle of the nails over each bone and over the head of the hand.</start_of_turn
And if the pain comes close to the muscles or the bones, then burn the whole circumference of the joints.</start_of_turn
Do not evacuate the disease well-regulated and with the reception of medicines, for if it is well-regulated and the inflammation subsides, it is evacuated with this cautery only, God helps.</start_of_turn

Of cautery of fractures.</start_of_turn
When there is a fracture in the bones and saying the bones break towards the knee, and when it is beginning to approach, then order the patient to lie down and use gentle means so that the wound comes away from the belly.</start_of_turn
And follow the patient between your two hands on the two sides, and command them to keep the limb away from the ground until the bone is set or the bruise or swelling disappears.</start_of_turn
And then return the previous with the hands, and sign the fracture on the fifth bone with a sign similar to the thumb of the circle to the upper parts of the body.</start_of_turn
And let the burn be like this:
Until it is soft and there are sparks.</start_of_turn Then return the intestine or hernia to its cavity, and place your hand over the area to prevent the intestine from coming out.
You have already opened the space between the patient's thighs, placed a cushion under them, another servant on their legs, and another on their chest, holding their hands.
And if it is necessary to make points on the surface of the foot, then do so with a pointed cautery. And when you have made holes as many as necessary to enter the bone marrow with the cautery, repeat the process until you have reached the center of the bone in the first attempt.
And observe diligently the color of the intestine during the process of cautery, that you do not burn the intestine so that no great harm or death results from it
And remember that when you burn [the] bone you must not neglect the bones, do not confer your operation
And care must be taken that the burnings of the children be subtle according to their age and measure.
And then care for the area of the burn for three days with a border around it until the burn mark of the fire is healed
And care for those who are otherwise suffering from their burns until they are healed
And the patient should rest on the bed for two days before he is allowed to walk until the wound and the burn are sealed
And care must be taken to suspend their food according to the length of time of their treatment, which will make the patient's belly less sore, and that the intestine does not come out due to the effort of recovery
And when it is time to take them away after approximately twenty days, the time to administer proper nourishment must be administered faithfully, and keep this up for other twenty days.
And may you be remembered from this work of healing and replenishment of food and drink, and from your harsh words, for when you use this regimen of treatment the entire patient will be healed
And I say the treatment of the ruptures in the other parts of the belly, and so at the beginning, and you must not neglect, when you burn [the] hole around the cautery according to the quantity of them, and that which is extruded from the cavity just as much as the third part of them; and care must be taken of that which has been said, and it is not adjusted
And I have already said above that the first breaks must be cauterized with a triangular cautery in this fashion, because it is a sign with tentacles:
and the line is stopped that which is along the breadth of the wound and another line below; and put your hand over the cautery with a claw cautery, because the first cautery is more acute and better
Chapter 46.</end_of_turn>
Of the cautery of the bone.</end_of_turn>
When in limbs for some ailment or for percussion pain persists and does not subside with medicines, then it is necessary to burn with a pointed cautery.</end_of_turn
And the burning of the whole limb must be according to the magnitude and the thinness of it, and its force and extent, and the location of the fracture and the pain of it.</end_of_turn
Therefore if it is well cured by the first burn, it is not good; and if not, repeat over it until the pain has disappeared; for it is often the case that these pains are due to the puncture of a limb towards that limb, so that you must consider that the burning must be done until the patient is healed.</end_of_turn
Chapter 47.</end_of_turn
Of the cautery of leprosy.</end_of_turn
Many books speak of burning with a cautery for great benefit, but manage if the kind of leprosy which is useful for the putrefaction of flesh and melancholy.
Therefore when you wish to burn it, consider if the leprosy is common or if it is cured by that which we have said in the division and not in vain, and fear lest by the corruption the whole body of the patient and all his perfection should be consumed, for the hours you burn it over the head with two cauteries: one in the middle of the head, and one at the back of the head, and over two nails; and one behind, over the nape or the shoulder.
And finally put your hand over the cautery for a little while until it has made a small imprint in the bone, and when the scales are loosened by it, so that the emission of thick vapor is relieved from it; and burn over the face according to what is necessary.</end_of_turn>
If leprosy has already spread over the patient and is clearly visible, then you must cauterize that area and those areas which we mentioned earlier; and cauterize on the tip of the nose, and two cauterizations on the two great toes, and two on two vertebrae of the collarbone, and six on the vertebrae of the chest, and one large one on the vertebrae close to the breastbone, one on the nipple, and two on the ankles, and one on each ankle, and two on the knee, and two on the muscles, and two on the testicles; cauterize that area over all the joints of the fingers and toes, and over each nail of the feet, and over the follicles of the breasts.
And take care of the nerves that are over the heel so that you do not burn them.
And every vein is cauterized with one cautery on the bone of the heel and another on the mouth of the stomach, and another on the heel bone
And you must know that when you adjust more cauteries, so much the more healing and comfortable it is; and you must know that the patient does not feel pain during the cautery, just as before, so that the body is already stupefaied.
And you must know that the cauteries must be large or small according to the members and the joints according to the species of the instruments
And take care of the cautery with flour of barley or honey and with another care that it is healthy
Chapter XLVIII.</end_of_turn>
Of the cautery of stupor.</end_of_turn>
When any limb is stiff or asleep and is treated with medicines, oils and plasters, and is not healed, then you must cauterize that stiff limb with cauteries according to the greatness of the limb or the smallness of it.</end_of_turn>
And let the scrotum be cauterized entering the spicitude of the codena a little.</end_of_turn And take care of that which is inside until it is healed.</end_of_turn
And some veins are cauterized each stupor which has to do with the fingers and toes, and with the vertebrae of the chest and you must see the loosening of the nerves which are causing that member, and it is remapped the stupor.</end_of_turn
Do not presume more than that which is known in the anatomy of the limb and in the exit of the nerves throughout the body moving.</end_of_turn
Chapter XLV.</end_of_turn
Of the cautery of the ulcer which is eating away.</end_of_turn
When the ulcer is old and does not benefit from the application of medicines, then you must cauterize over that where you previously cauterized a little according to the quantity of the spicitude of the codena until it is remapped the paleness and the color of it, and the color of it is changed.</end_of_turn
And take care of that with flour of barley and lentils with olive oil and with rue leaves, and with columb's ash or with yarrow's ash, give each a part and mix them all together, and apply it to the area and hold it in place until it is healed.</end_of_turn

Of the cautery of cancer.</end_of_turn
When cancer is beginning and appears in that area, then you must cauterize that area with a circular cautery around its circumference as it is revolting.</end_of_turn
And say the learned ones that it should be cauterized with the last cautery in the middle of the area; I do not know of this, for I believe that it is ulcerated, and I have already seen this in many veins.</end_of_turn
It is more prudent to cauterize in the circumference of it as we have said, or with multiple cauteries.</end_of_turn
Chapter LI.</end_of_turn
Of the cautery of tumors.</end_of_turn
When some tumors are delayed in maturity, and this is because of excess fat or because of the state of the patient, who is old in decrepitude, or for little strength, or for the time, and you want to expedite the maturity of the tumors; then you must cauterize in the circumference of them with multiple small punctures; and immediately apply that which will make it accelerate in maturity.</end_of_turn
May be if you wish to perforate them with the cautery, then ignite the cautery of which this is the form: suspend that in the middle of the wound until it penetrates the bone.
And if you burn it in that place where there is more, so that the limb is relieved; and then take care of that until it is healed.</end_of_turn>
Chapter 52.</end_of_turn>
Of the cautery of a tumor.</end_of_turn>
A tumor is a wandering corruption in a limb, which consumes that just as fire consumes dry wood.</end_of_turn
Therefore, if sometimes that tumor is in the place where you suffer pain from the cautery, then ignite the cautery needles few at a time, as is convenient in the place where it is a tumor.</end_of_turn
And take care of cauterizing that from all parts until you have eradicated all the corruption and there remains no cause of it.</end_of_turn
And rest for three days, and keep your hands off the cauterized places until three days have passed since you have applied olive oil mixed with sulfur on them until the wounds have healed and all the corruption has gone.</end_of_turn
And take care of that which is engendered by the wound.</end_of_turn
For indeed, if three times within three days the wound heals without corruption, it is not; but if so, then repeat the cautery over that which is remaining in the corrupted places.</end_of_turn
And a tumor is treated in various ways with acute medicine, which is half as effective as the cautery.</end_of_turn For indeed, the cautery with fire is of more use than medicine.</end_of_turn>
And I have already said the treatment with acute medicine in the division, so take that as well when you have occasion.</end_of_turn
Chapter 53.</end_of_turn
Of the cautery of abscesses and other similar lesions.</end_of_turn
Many veins flow downwards towards the feet of the sick who are called abscesses, and this is a great cause, made by a swelling, which lies in the foot; and the cautery is done in two ways, that is, with fire and with cold water.</end_of_turn
For indeed, the cautery with fire is that you ignite the cautery with a flame similar to that of a burn, which is made of iron according to the quantity of the abscess from all parts, and of fine stripes.</end_of_turn
And take care of extinguishing that flame over the abscess, and then with your hand hold the cautery over the abscess until the cautery has reached the depth of the abscess.</end_of_turn And rest for three days until the limb begins to heal.</end_of_turn And take care of covering that with fresh cloth soaked in salt, and rest the dressing over that for a night, for that will eradicate the root of the matter.</end_of_turn
And take care of the place where the abscess has been cauterized until it is healed.</end_of_turn
And if it does not heal, and many veins flow out onto the surface of the limb, mostly in the legs and feet, then you must administer in those cauteries with cold water, that is, take a small vessel or iron or burn, and place that over the abscess; and pour a little cold water over the vessel; keep your hand over it, and press that with your hand all around, and press the margin of the vessel against the root of the abscess, and keep the cold water flowing through the opening of the root; and wait for the patient an hour for the pain of the cold water to pass away. And do that until the abscess is eradicated from its roots.</end_of_turn>
And indeed, so do I say of all these things that have been said before until we have overcome all of them.</end_of_turn
And take care of those pus that remain after the roots of the abscesses have been eradicated by the cold of the water that engenders the pain of the wound.</end_of_turn
Chapter 54.</end_of_turn
Of the cautery of tremor.</end_of_turn
When there is a tremor due to cold in the nerves or from fever or from another cause similar, then you must cauterize that with four cauteries or five over the vertebrae of the two, between each two vertebrae with a cautery; and over the feet of the limb, and over the stomach of the limb, with olive oil.</end_of_turn
The tremor of the patient relaxes and confirms the freedom of the acute pain.
When the tremor of the patient subsides, the acute pain is confirmed to be freed.</end_of_turn>
From an accidental burn of the body.</end_of_turn
When there is spreading of bile in the body, and pus-filled boils appear which are caused by corrupt thick matter; therefore cover immediately when the boils appear, that it be cauterized over all around the head of the fistula as deeply as possible, or at the root of a long fistula; or with a gradual incision.</end_of_turn
And some other girls are cauterized at the beginning of their discharge in this manner; and they are not to be creased, and the excess is to be broken down by these means, and they will be healed of these.</end_of_turn
Moreover cover that it is done at the same time as the evacuation with flebotomy.</end_of_turn
End of session.</end_of_turn>
From accidental burn of the flux of blood by incision of the artery.</end_of_turn
Many girls bleed from the artery which is cut under the plague which must be removed, or from the incision of apostemas or cautery of the limb, and in such a case, it is difficult to stop it.</end_of_turn
Therefore when such an accident happens, quickly take hold of your hand over the wound of the artery and stop for a moment over that place where the thread is cut so that no blood escapes until the bleeding of the artery has stopped and that it does not flow out again.</end_of_turn
And immediately stop the burning of olive oil a few and many, by name a few, and blow over them until they are not ignited.</end_of_turn
And immediately take from those a little or a great one according to the place and the plague in which the artery is broken, over that vein urgently holding back the bleeding until it has stopped bleeding and restraining that blood.</end_of_turn
And if the blood is expelled from the wound of the artery when you have remained over the wound and squeezed out the cautery, then take another cautery immediately and hold it firmly against the cauteries which are in the fire, so that no further bleeding occurs until the blood has clotted.</end_of_turn
And take care that you do not burn the nerves that are here, and that you come to the patient with another illness.</end_of_turn
And you know that when blood flows from the artery, it is not possible to stop the bleeding in these cases, especially when the artery is large, unless one of four methods is used: or by cautery as we have said, or by extraction when not extracted, or when extracted, when the limbs are burned and the blood is clotted, or when it is bound with thread or ligament for strong support, or when it is supported with medicines which have the property of restricting the bleeding; and it is strengthened by dusting with powder or constriction downwards.</end_of_turn
Moreover, whoever administers downward restriction of the thread and tightening of the bandage or by position of causes which burn and prevent recurrence, does not comfort but rather harms.</end_of_turn
Moreover, if this happens to someone and the doctor is not present or the medicine is not available, then immediately order the thumb to be held over the wound of that vein as we have said, and understand the great constriction of the limb until the blood is finally separated from the plague; and that the bleeding from the artery is not allowed; and that the artery be moistened with cold water until the blood has clotted and become thick; and more than this, order cautery or medicine as necessary.</end_of_turn
Of incision and perforation and winds and of bleeding and of plagues and of their appearances.</end_of_turn
We have already said in the first chapter that cautery with fire is convenient and necessary in many diseases, and the occasions and causes of these, and the instruments necessary for these with the forms of the cauteries; and we have ordered the chapters of the subordinate part of the head to the feet.</end_of_turn
And I will proceed in this chapter in that way, so that what is required is alleviated, concerning what has been demanded.</end_of_turn
And since I am about to begin, I tell you that in this chapter terror is more dreadful than in the first chapter of cautery.</end_of_turn
And for this reason great caution must be exercised, for in this operation the evacuation of the contents of the appendix, excision of a stone, opening of the abscess or draining of purulent discharge, or extraction of a splinter or incision of the bone must be accomplished. And all these things are accompanied by fear and tremor, and in most of them death is at stake.
I also warn you that you must not attempt anything beyond your capacity, for some matters require the skill of a man who has learned to deal with many illnesses and diseases.</end_of_turn> And among these things there is some that will go well with your illness, and some that will be burdensome for you. The cause of this is the violent nature of your disease, its duration, and the fear of death that accompanies it.</end_of_turn>
And among these things that I have mentioned, fear and superstition are often added, and hope for salvation is placed in that sanctuary, while the true disease becomes pernicious.</end_of_turn>
Therefore do not consent to anything that anyone advises you concerning this matter, for your caution should be greater than your desire, and your presumption about the cause of your ailment should not precede knowledge that is certain and reliable.
Use instead for the treatment of all these ailments the prognostic signs and indications that are useful for the restoration of health, for in this lies the greatest aid to acquiring fame and glory, to the solace of life and the prolongation of days.</end_of_turn>
Oh, children of God, may God enlighten you and guide you, for He is in your hand.</end_of_turn>
And I have arranged this chapter differently from the preceding ones, concerning the care of the head down to the feet, so that you may find in this chapter what you require concerning these things and what you need.</end_of_turn
First Chapter.</end_of_turn>
Concerning the care of the water contained in the head of children.</end_of_turn>
You must know that this disease often originates in children and that when the nurse washes the head of the child, the child’s life is in danger.</end_of_turn
And many times the cause of this is unknown.</end_of_turn
I have not seen this disease except in children, and in all those whom I have seen it, death approaches. And for this reason I consider it my duty to leave this work concerning these matters.</end_of_turn
I have seen a child whose head was filled with water, and the head of the child was so swollen that the child could not rest upon it even with the greatest effort, and that the humidity increased until the child died.</end_of_turn
This humidity is either added between the cartilage and the bone, or is added outside the bone over the cartilage.</end_of_turn
For if the humidity is between the cartilage and the bone and the appendix is little, then you must make a hole in the middle of the head with a fissure two fingers wide, until the humidity runs out. This is the way to remove the swelling.</end_of_turn
And if the humidity is greater and the appendix is large, then you must make two holes according to this method:</end_of_turn
If the humidity is outside the bone, it is a sign that you have eaten too much food and drunk too much wine, and the water is squeezed out when you press your hand against the parts downwards and it is not in your belly.</end_of_turn Therefore make three holes in the middle of the head according to this method:</end_of_turn
And return all the humidity from the incision; then strengthen the holes with strips and cushions; and give him to drink plenty of wine and oil for five days; and then remove the ligament and treat the wound with compresses and unguents, and strengthen the head by equalizing it; and feed the patient with dry food of little humidity until the limb is healed and healthy.</end_of_turn
And another method of incision is to consider the size of the appendix and the collection of water, for sometimes the swelling is greater in the occiput or in the front or in the right or in the left; and therefore take care of the incision where the appendix is and the evacuation of the water, and do it as you deem most appropriate.</end_of_turn
And note that you must not cut the artery, and indeed you must allow the blood to flow freely of itself from the wound and remain with the patient until the bleeding stops from the evacuation of the humidity.</end_of_turn
Second chapter
When swelling occurs from boils or abscesses on the heel or foot, and this has already been recognized, and one does not trust in the cure of medicines, then the true cure in this case is the incision of those two arteries.
Therefore cover when you wish to make the incision so that the patient does not feel pain, and quickly pinch the area around the arteries to prevent them from bleeding, and strengthen the hand of the patient under the chest; and consider where the vein is placed; and the places where any of these are close to the ankles should be depressed so that nothing escapes from them.
And then make another incision above the artery, and make an incision of each part of the acute angle at the incision to reach the bone, and do this for the width of the head
And if you wish, remove the surrounding fat from around the artery and tie it to the incisions of the parts below
And the length of the incision should be two fingers adjusted, so that when any vein is incised the blood is ejected with a pulsatile stream, which escapes through frequent jumps.
Moreover if the artery does not appear in the incision, cover that you measure the ankle three fingers wide, and tighten and make an incision to the bone
And what you get from the blood is the quantity of one unc. and if you do not get much from it more or less, it is according to the quantity that appears from the virulence of the patient and the filling of the artery of them
And consider the wound, and therefore if anything remains on the bone of any cause of swelling, the hour to make an incision is so that no abscess remains
And strengthen the wound with sponges and silk threads of silk, and take care of that which is inside until it is healed.
Chapter III
On the extraction of the arteries which are in the temples
When ancient or acute boils or abscesses occur, due to agricultural humidity and for the quality of the lacerations of the temples, or even ancient violence that resembles these, and when these are not treated with medical methods, then we must resort to the extraction of the arteries in the temples or to the cauterization of these in the same way as we have shown
And the manner of the operation and extraction of these is that the patient is placed in the temples for which they are; and understand that the visible artery in the temple is the one that you have shown by the mark, and that the rest is hidden except in a few people for its intensity.
And if it is hidden, then strengthen the hand of the patient with some support; and quickly pinch the area with a rough sponge or evaporate the area with warm water until the visible artery appears. And take the sponge of which this is the shape: And quickly draw the thread towards that which facilitates that the vein reaches the artery; and take away what is above and extract that which is below until you have extracted that from the tendon and revealed that from the tunicas which are left behind from that, from all parts
Moreover if the artery is subtle, then cover that with the end of the nail, and make an incision of that part according to the quantity for which the ends of these are elongated and contracted, and do not bring out the blood, for if it is not incised it will not cure the blood of anything
And evacuate from the blood one unc. three times
And if the artery is great, then cover that in two places with firm double support of leather or with strong threads, and do not touch it until the decay is over and the wound is consolidated, without bringing out the blood
And close the excess which is between two ligaments; and do this in that hour or do it at another time.
And if you wish, cauterize that which is cut within the bone which is cut by the cautery until the ends of these are incised, and stay in place of that useless work
E is better that the patient have fever or is suffering from scaly heat; for the cause of such affections helps the drying humors, and therefore is better in treatment.
E covers almost the extraction of the arteries which are seen on the ankle, and if they are left unbandaged, dust falls down upon them adequately. And therefore do either cure with dry medicines or make them appear with calamine and plaster until they are healed.</end_of_turn>
And if while working you see blood flowing from the artery, at that moment you must restrain that blood, or cauterize it, or close the ankle, and press your hand over that area until the bleeding stops.</end_of_turn And if no other cause appears to you, then stop the bleeding from the artery until the blood has clotted, and bathe the area with cold water until the pain subsides, and strengthen as much as you can.</end_of_turn>
And what is more curious in the extraction of an artery is that you cauterize the vein with two clips having seen both places with a needle, and having stopped any bleeding, until they reach the bone and split the vein into two places, so that what is between the extremities is elongated, which are not consolidated by this cautery.</end_of_turn
And this is the form of the cautery:
And the acute of the two clips should be equal.</end_of_turn Better is if there is less acute than two clips, for if there is too great an acute of two clips near to any bone, it will cause the flesh to be scorched too quickly.</end_of_turn
Therefore when there is any thickness, keep the fire hot in those parts and the flesh will be cleanly separated.</end_of_turn
This work is better in all works and more lightweight.</end_of_turn>
And let the space between two clips be the quantity of the thickness of the finger.</end_of_turn
Chapter four.</end_of_turn>
Of the care of the limbs affected by acute and sour ulcers of the bones.</end_of_turn
When there are sour ulcers, and it is the limb of those veins which are above the head of the tibia, and it is not interfered with by any cause of medical treatment, and sometimes the face of the patient already swells up and sits in front of walking like a walk of ants, and the bones of that limb are extended, humify them again as they were previously known, and the nails are scaly from the acute of the tears, which were previously good for treating these ulcers, and now that treatment is useless.</end>
And command the patient to scrape away the nails for which are in front, and then make three incisions equidistant from each other according to the length of the front.</end And if the length of the incision is two fingers: one incision is equidistant from the length of the nose in the middle of the front, and the second according to the length of the tear ducts, and the third from the other part.</end
And keep your hand from the continuation of both mandibles.</end> And if the space of any incision is the quantity of three fingers adjusted.</end
And if you have a sponge pad or dry cloth moisten it with these which you will dry with the hand.</end
And between them insert two sharp extremities, of which this is the form of the incision of them:</start that is from the edge of the temples to the second incision.</start Excise at that whole the bone which is between two incisions over the bone, and do so that the incision may move from one incision to the second.</start And do the same with this pad and put in the first incision another instrument which is called cautery, blunt from one side and sharp on the other side.</start
And stop the bleeding of that sharp side against the soft tissue that is beside the bone, and the edges of the bone that are outside, and fill that up until it reaches the moving incision, and cut away everything that goes from the head to the bones.</start
And continue the incision up to that where the bone ends, and do so that do so in the moving incision.</start
And as soon as the sacred quantity has gone, express the wounds of the patient's feet with vinegar.
And immediately stop on every old wound, and stop over those dusts that are covered in fat, in vinegar and oil and vinegar strong, and do not leave it until the wound has closed.</end_of_turn>
And on the third day remove the ligament and administer great effusion of warm water or tepid, and do give oil rubbed with bay leaves and other herbs that the wounds may heal.</end_of_turn>
End of document.</end_of_turn>
From the care of the limbs for fractures and to the heels descend from the parts that are below the head.</end_of_turn>
When at some time a fracture is acute and continues, and sometimes the heels of the patient extend slightly, and already the sight of them is deserving of pity, and the ulcers of the eyelids and their socket are for them, and in the front of the head is sharp pain leading to excessive stretching, therefore for these accidents that the substances and bones do not fracture but from veins that come from the lower parts.</end_of_turn
And the best cure for these is that you command the patient to raise his face, and immediately make an incision in the middle of the face, a little for the width (and begin with the incision on the left temporal bone to the right temporal bone; and let the incision be from the outside inwards; and lengthen your hand from the lacerations of the temples which are injured by chewing), until the bone is exposed.</end_of_turn
Dry all the sacred with sponges or dry wool and immediately fill between the two lips of the incision with cotton or strips of cloth.</end_of_turn And do give oil rubbed with bay leaves and other herbs that the wound does not stick.</end_of_turn
And when you have drained away the wound and you see that the swelling has already diminished, the hour is to stop closing the bones until it begins to naturally knit, and do give care of that which regulates the drying which makes the flesh knit, as if you were taking wheat flour two parts and barley four parts and mixing or, make plaster of them and administer it to these wounds of the newly born flesh.</end_of_turn
End of document.</end_of_turn
On the care of what happens in the ankles.</end_of_turn
All the causes that happen in the ankles are of four kinds, which are either mineral stone or causes similar to stone, such as iron and lead, or of plant origin such as chaff or beans, or is due to a fluid cause such as vinegar and strong vinegar and the like.</end_of_turn
And therefore when stone is in the ankle or another cause similar to these that does not adjust or grow in the ankle, and the ankle is swollen, and sometimes the stone, do distill out in that case of olive oil or vinegar, and immediately administer the extraction of it, and make it vomit with condiment, and bandage the wound following the event of vomiting.</end_of_turn And do stop the circuit of the ankle with some pieces of wool or bandage, and stretch the ankle to the surrounding parts, because swelling caused by these causes is forceless.</end_of_turn
And if it is not useless, do administer the extraction of it with the instruments called epicaricial instruments which are of this form:
And if it is forceless with the hand, it is good; otherwise, do administer the extraction of it with an incision of little duplication.</end_of_turn
And therefore if it is not forceless by vinegar, do make a needle of gut and insert the extremity of the needle into the hole of the ankle and close around the needle with wax and oiled for so that it is not torn except for the needle.</end_of_turn And do extract with the gut thread with strong traction, because it brings swelling like vinegar that we have mentioned.</end_of_turn
Even if it is not forceless in this way, do take a piece of alum or of vinegar that appears pale with the ankle, and take as many as are desired, and put it on the extremity of the ray, and immediately wrap over it adequately.</end> And immediately insert it into the hole of the ankle with facility, and immediately dry the ankle of humidity.</end_of_turn
And therefore if it is not forceless from all the causes that we have mentioned, do suspect that it is due to excessive heat or spasm.</end_of_turn
And thus at the beginning of the treatment, you must cleanse the patient's saphenous vein and extract the stone following the manner of its virtue. Then do that which will break the clot between your fingers and convert the yellow bile into its parts, and make a small incision in the root of the thumb to let out its gray matter before it causes further damage. And if the opening of the wound is like a crescent, once the stone has passed, use appropriate instruments for that purpose. Then close the wound quickly and carefully, taking care that it is healed properly.</end_of_turn>
If the cause of the swelling lies in fatty substances that grow and infiltrate, then administer the cure and extraction of these. Even if you do not heed my advice, know that I will give you a subtle sign in this way: And administer the incision of that fat which is causing the swelling in the heel.</end_of_turn>
Do not be astonished when you find that the fat is already moist due to the vapor of the bile, and stop it in soft layers. Or extract it with pins or with a subtle incision as I have said, for the extraction is alleviated.</end_of_turn>
But in the water which enters the heel, which causes the patient to cough at the beginning, fill the heel with some old rags, and put your hand over that heel in which the water is, and if it is forced out, do not be afraid; otherwise take hold of your thumbs and index fingers according to the length of the finger, and clench them in the heel a little, and the patient should insert one of those rags into the hole of the heel and jump over the one side of that part and strike the other side against the side which is causing the heel pain.</end_of_turn> So do not stop until all the water is forced out.</end_of_turn>
So do not stop until all the water is forced out.</end_of_turn> And when the water is finally forced out, take hold of paper or sponges, etc.</end_of_turn And put one extremity in the heel and extend the other extremity with the heel over the flame until the pain is gone.</end_of_turn
And put another sponge there and do so until all the water is forced out, and then extract the stone with a needle as is commonly known.</end_of_turn>
But in the extraction of any beast that is within that heel, if it is small, leave it in peace and do as we have said in the division; but if it is of great size which causes fear at once, then administer the extraction with pin and nail, and the cause of the pain will be less severe than all the other causes which cause swelling in the heel.</end_of_turn
But in the extraction of worms that are engendered in the heel, when you have cured that which we have said in the division and in the treatise on distillations, and do not neglect your cure, then cover that the heel is exposed to the sun.</end_of_turn
And if any cause of worms appears, then extract that with pin or needle, subtle. And if no cause appears, take a needle and grasp the worm from the head and stretch it out so that its form is like that.</end_of_turn And insert the sensitive part of the hand into the heel according to the quantity that the patient suffers because of the pain; and then use pressure with that to squeeze out the worms, doing so until all the worms are expelled.</end_of_turn
And if you do not heed my advice, I will bind you and close the hole of the needle as we have said; then administer distillations which have already been proven useful in the treatment of worms, and find them in the treatise on distillations.</end_of_turn
And your ointment with which you anoint the heel with these medicinal oils in the heel with this instrument, which is its form.</end_of_turn And make a hole of silver or lead, leaving a small hole in it.
And thus it is done in the curvature of the retaining canula here where it is necessary.</end_of_turn And if you wish, take the sponge and wrap it around the hand adequately, and pour oil into the hollow of the thumb, or the juice of any herb, or whatever you wish of these medicines into the canula – which is in the heel – and then insert the sponge with the hand and press with your hand that which will compress gently from within until the oil is expelled from the hollow of the thumb and the pain is relieved.

The air is thick with large moisture in the eyelids and on the eyelashes.
Therefore the operation for them is to consider if the greatness is derived from them from the eyelids and is widespread; and the cause of it is slight.
Therefore make over that fissure for the width, and then drain away that from all parts easily as you can, and then suspend that which is once and cut that
And if the figure is great, then adjust that with sutures; and care for that until it is healed
And if it is slight, do not be excessive with that because the language of it restores that and nourishes it
And if the greatness is descending towards the parts towards the root of the eyelid, you must scrape the surface of the root, for otherwise the eyelid will be elongated and will not be noticed in any way.
And finally, after the incision, wash the wound with salt water; and care for the area until it is healed.
The treatment is complete.</start_of_turn>
The care after the treatment for the dry moisture of the eyelashes is from the external application of oil.
The ointment which is generated in the tunics of the eyelids behind is gray, and especially in children, it makes their hair dull and causes their nails to become brittle; and it does not allow the brilliance of the sun to penetrate because the tears are retained by them.</start_of_turn>
Therefore you sometimes see them wiped over their faces all the time, and over their faces at night; and so over the eyelids of their eyes they put wet eyebrows, which already cover the inflammation, and the imminent danger of swelling is in the eye; and when you press on the area with your thumb, the swelling immediately subsides within them.</start_of_turn
Every method of treatment is in that which the patient suspends his head over the thigh, and he rests his hands and feet on the ground, and makes a circle according to the amount that contains all the nourishment, and he suspends that over that and presses on the thumb of the hand that is over the thigh so that there is gathered an arc in the middle of the circle, and when he comes to the middle of that moisture which is incident upon the fissure for the width, the fissure is not greater than the fissure that is made in flabby tissue.</start_of_turn
More in the preparation when you have to make the whole circumference until you reach the nourishment, for in the most part processes the nourishment by fissure following the shape of white ointment.</start_of_turn
Therefore extract that which you have enveloped between the thighs which you hold between the thumbs of the hands.</start_of_turn
And keep in mind that you do not stretch the fissure for this so that the moisture does not reach the hair and remove that.</start_of_turn
More if it does not appear to you in the beginning of the fissure, more adjust the fissure a little to facilitate the nourishment; and then extract that which we have said; and then moisten the area with oil and vinegar and place your hand over the area and tighten those which are like dust.</start_of_turn
And thus when they are dry, stop that in the concavity of the fissure so that what remains of that moisture.</start_of_turn
And care for that until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
More if an accident happens in the area afterwards, care for that which is softened with poultices until it is healed.</start_of_turn
The treatment is complete.</start_of_turn
Methods of treatment for the moisture of the eyelashes.</start_of_turn
When the eyelashes naturally touch each other and are accustomed, when tears are excessive and there is a rubbing of the eyelids and cloth within them so that the moisture is the cause of the destruction of the hair that is called to touch the hair, care for it in four ways: or by cutting with a cautery; or by acute medicine as it is said in the chapter of cautery; or it is made by sticking with an incision and suture; or by cannas as I will say.</start_of_turn
Therefore keep the patient’s head over the thigh; convert the lower eyelid with your left hand, and if it is converted, do not; and if not, make an incision in the part where it is firm from the outside of the eyelid, and make the needle penetrate from the inside, and when it is in place — from the margin of the eyelid where the lashes arise — from the lashes, and pull the thread towards the outside of the eyelid, and convert that which is like the ray.</start_of_turn
E aprop fen in the part of the inner canthus leaves them perpendiculosam ad spatum incidentarum del lacrimal major intra al lacrimal minor; et aprop extratz le fiel et pause dejos la canthus polvilhs parvulum de cotes vel de marpes, et aprop senare sur la canthus ad tenta, et sia ita sicut figura folii mirtae.
Then put the lower eyelid down so that it is parallel to the edge of the eye; and extract the foreign body and leave the canthus covered with small particles of lead or bismuth, and then put a patch on the canthus like a leaf of ivy.
And thus put the patch on over the two lines that you have marked, starting from the larger lacrimal gland into the smaller one. And if the wound approaches the natural parts as much as the greatness of the king.
And thus put on the bandage on one of the two angles of the codena, and scrape away the whole thing, and adjust with the suture the two lips with gut or fine thread, and stop bleeding, and make adhere whatever excess of blood remains over two eyebrows with some cause, if you wish to do so, or leave it alone.</end_of_turn>
And thus leave the suture of the wounds within three days or four, and take care of it.</end_of_turn>
And if you wish, leave the bandage unsutured, and care for it so that it dries and contracts, because the eyelid is raised because of the swelling of the wound and the accumulation of pus; and better leave it unsutured like this, rather than to risk infection.</end_of_turn>
However, in this case ask about the patient, and do what is right, and do not be afraid.</end_of_turn>
And another way of treating it is to mark on the eyelid the figure like a leaf of ivy, and to raise the eyelid with three nails separated and pressed together like this:</start_turn><end_turn>
If this is not possible, take nails, and if they are not equal in size, take one needle with thread and put that in the middle of the figure, and put the other thread next to the greater lacrimal gland, and the thread next to the smaller gland, and adjust between the nails of the two threads with equality, and then put your hand over the area that you have marked like this.</start_turn><end_turn
And thus adjust the two lips of the wound with sutures, and care for it until it is healed.</start_turn><end_turn
However, if after this the wound should happen to swell, you must leave the swelling alone, and keep it covered, and do not touch it.</start_turn><end_turn
And in all these diseases that happen to the eyelid that cause the hairs to fall out, you must take care of them in the way that we have already said about the wound; for in this case the suture is more artificial.</start_turn><end_turn
To suture in this way: And you must convert the eyelid and split the figure that is inside as I have recounted; and then take two needles or two fine threads of the length of the eyelid and the width of which should be less than the width of the area.</start_turn><end_turn And you have already pierced at the extremities of each part where you have the threads.</start_turn><end_turn
Then gather some slight substance over the excess of the eyelid that comes out, and tighten the threads of each part with great stricture, and leave that for several days, for the swelling of the wound will diminish and will be softened and will disappear by itself when the days pass.</start_turn><end_turn
And if it is late, leave the sutures for a while, and care for the wound until it is healed.</start_turn><end_turn
And when it is solidified, the eyelid is elevated and the hair does not fall out.</start_turn><end_turn
This is the way of doing two needles in this way:</start_turn><end_turn And take the quantity of length and width neither more nor less.</start_turn><end_turn
End of document.
For the elevation of hair loss in the eye with a needle when the hair is hard.</start_turn><end_turn
When the hair is unnatural, hard and rough, and you pierce the hair, the operation in this case is that you take a fine needle and pause on that thread of silk and cotton, and that you adjust the extremities of it and keep them in such a way as to avoid any tremor. The length of the fingers should be equal to the quantity of a palm.
Then take two fingers and join them closely, and touch the tips of those which you wish to measure
Then place the patient's head on the belly, and let the light of the sun be seen so that your work is declared, which is a subtle and minor operation.
Then insert the needle at the root of the hair adjusted which has needed to be made, and make that penetrate into the eyelashes fiercely until you extract that which has become loose from the natural hair
Then pull out the hair and put it into an ointment, and stain them with one or two or three and no more
Then pull out your hand with that which the hair has come out with ointment in the eyelashes with the natural hair.
Do not put ointment on the hair if it has not come out, but if it has come out put ointment on the parts beyond the finger which you have pressed with that, until ointment has come out from the wound itself.
And thus with the vision of the smell, which the hours of your instruments have smelled, and groan what must be groaned, and leave it closed for two days or three, until the hair adheres to the skin and grows over that good flesh
And if the hair is shorter, then adjust a hair long from the natural hair, and lift it up with that, or that you leave it until it is even with some space, and when you have elevated that
Chapter XIII.
Of the care of that which appears in the eyelashes that comes out.
When you see in the eye something that causes irritation, and the contraction of the eyelid when it is contracted in its entirety, or to the right or to the left side, because of bad consolidation of pus or of ulcer or of burn, and this is called leporine, and this is either natural or accidental, and is useful for consolidating pus or ulcers or burns, or for preventing them from becoming worse
May the manner of the operation in this case be such that you make that consolidation and separate the lips of that eye, and keep it in that which is between those two a little piece of sponge, and tie those up until they are healed
And do not neglect to take care of the causes of these irritations, restrictions; for if you do this, you will find that the pus will not return to irritate more than at any other time
Use in this case that which softens like this cumin, and embroil with water in which are boiled lentil seeds or in vinegar, which is liquefied with some oil, and immerse in that the piece, and care for that
And the treasure of your care is that you perform with all skill that is not consolidated in the way that we began
And this operation that we have said, is nothing but the rectification of that which has irritated and has not restored the shape of the eye as it was before
Chapter XIV
Of the care of that which is useful in the eyelash of the eye
This irritation which is useful in the eyelash of the eye, which is called leporine really, is either natural or accidental
The accidental one is useful for pus or for ulcer or for burn or for other similar things
And the way of the operation of this is that you take a needle in which you make double thread, and fix that in the flesh, and pass the thread from the tear duct of the left to the tear duct of the right, until the thread reaches the two ends of the flesh
And then stretch the flesh to the sides of the needle and hold that with the needle, and pierce with that in a wide space And therefore if you return the figure of the eyelid according to what we have covered, it is not good; and if so, take the thread and suspend that in the fissured figure, and at that convert the eyelid, and make the two wounds at the sides of the outer eyelid
And the ends of the two wounds be at two angles of the incision, which has been useful until they converge, and that be useful when they converge so that they make a useful figure of them
And this figure is the Greek letter: lambda
And thus hold the flesh that amount to the width of the eye, so that you do not damage the eyelid.
Then adjust the separated parts and bind them together like threads of yarn; and take care of those with the medicines that we mentioned before and the bandages that should be used until the patient is healed.
And if it is necessary to suture or cauterize a wound, then cover that the wound is flat on the edge of the eyelid according to what has been said before.</end_of_turn> Then separate the nail between two lips as we have mentioned before.</end_of_turn
In the sum of the speech of the care of the alxacrati when it is detached or left, that it runs in its operation, according to how it is prepared in the form of alxacrati, and that is in the form of diverse motas.</end_of_turn>
And the skilled artists always prepare an engine in whatever way is possible for them so that they can restore the figure to its natural shape, or in any other way, and that the patient according to what is convenient for them from the operation and the instruments that are at their disposal.</end_of_turn
Chapter 15.</end_of_turn>
Of the adherence of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or to the cornea.</end_of_turn
When these adhesion occur with many men, it is necessary to solidify the eyelid further from the edge of the eye, and to prevent the ease of movement and its natural works, therefore cover that you withdraw the iris from the pupil, and elevate it in such a way, or stretch that with the eyelash.</end_of_turn
And then incisions the adhesion with a blunt spatula, which is not of the sharpness of the incisions, having made a slight perforation so that the patient is not disturbed by the operation, and remain that the spatula does not slip from the eye.</end_of_turn
And that your incision be such as to remove that adhesion with ease until the eyelid is returned to its natural shape and that the adhesion is completely healed.</end_of_turn
And put in the eye salt water in which you wash; or distill in it of vinegar dissolved in water.</end_of_turn
And then separate between the eyelid and the eye with a piece of gauze, and put over the eye a thread of yarn soaked in fat, and on the third day use astringents until the patient is healed.</end_of_turn
Chapter 16.</end_of_turn
Of the incision of the nail and the emergence of the tear ducts.</end_of_turn
Know that the nail is according to two methods, which either is nervous and is similar to a hard, soft spatula; or is non-nervous, resembling white moisture that is frozen, which when you touch it, or force it to take hold with an eyelash, is separated and the eyelash does not adhere to it.</end_of_turn
And both species do not begin until from the greater lacrimal duct until it gradually covers the eye and hinders vision and the movement of the eye.</end_of_turn
More the manner of working in the incision of the eye is that the patient rests his head on his chest, and you hold the eyelids open with your hand, and elevate the eyelid with your hand, and collect the nail with an eyelash of little duplication and stretch that to the surrounding area.</end_of_turn And then take a needle and enter into that a hair of horse or ox or calf, or something similar, or thread, or fold the extremity of the needle little by little and leave that in the middle of the nail, and penetrate that with the needle, and tie with thread the nail; and stretch that to the surrounding area, and remove from the skin the part of the nail that surrounds the pupil.</end_of_turn And thus you will keep that behind the eye.</end_of_turn
And then leave the incision in the root of the lacrimal with a blunt spatula or with small forceps, and wash the natural tear duct so that from the incision of that no liquid tears should flow continuously.</end>
And sometimes the nail is left with the natural nail extended or with thread, as we have said, and then it is to be discharged with a lion's tongue from which this is the form of it:
And keep in mind that in the spatula do not touch the corneal membrane and that you avoid breaking it, and that the pupil is perforated.</end_of_turn>
And put in the eye a little salt or a little bit of ointment made from sulfur, and wash that in the other day; and take care of that with water until it is healed.</end_of_turn
If the nail is not sensitive and cannot tolerate the needle, nor is it pierced in that area, then in such a case the kind of nail is cured by medicines, and is healed just as well as if I had mentioned it and recommended it in the division.
If you wish to cut it out, then you must open the patient and take out the acute pain with a sharp lancet in this fashion: with caution. And if sometimes that is rare and is hidden and comes in that way, then distill from your urine in the scent of the head to make a salve or ointment or salt wash, and apply the scent within the other day.
Then repeat the operation until everything that is of it is removed, except that which is left in the wound, for the hour has learned that, and heal the wound at the beginning when it is healed
And repeat your operation on that for this reason until it is healed
The discharge from the tear duct, if you notice it in the wound for a long time, suspend it with oil; and prick that from that part, and do not finish the incision so that it does not burst tears.
And distill in the tear duct head or make an ointment to make it heal when it is healed
Chapter XVII.</start_of_turn>
Of the incision of the nails and of what is born from an adjusted bone in the wound.</start_of_turn>
Some nails grow crooked in the heel, and when it covers the pupil or approaches or extends over the eyelashes and compresses the eyelashes against the margins and is gathered like a row of pyramids.</start_of_turn
More than that, if the patient has a great deal of pain in the groin, place your hand over the heel and collect all that bone together with nails convenient to that, and take it out with a forceps or a vessel; and prick the bone at the beginning until everything is finished with the needle, and keep your hand away from the wound so that you do not damage that which you are going to do.</start_of_turn
And the incision should be made as we have recommended in the incision of the nail, or with small forceps as those which are collected together as it will be in this chapter.
Therefore when the incision is finished and all that bone is removed, then fill the wound with coarse salt or sprinkle it with powdered charcoal and keep it covered with a piece of cloth until the wound is cauterized
And if there remains any cause of nails and it is well-nigh healed, and fears a new cauterization, then read the wound and cure that cauterization with water, and repeat the operation on that until it is healed, and in the meantime keep the adjusted bone which caused the wound of this kind.</start_of_turn
But beware that you do not alienate all the care of the wound by natural or accidental means, or by iron, and do not put your hand on any of these operations until you see that that limb is suffering from that operation.</start_of_turn
Chapter XVIII.</start_of_turn
Of the collection of hair in the wound.</start_of_turn
Hairy veins which are seen over the wound and which prevent the dressing from being put on, must be left alone for a certain number of days.</start_of_turn
Therefore at the beginning you must consider if the hair in which there is hair is strong and if there is no other disease which causes hair, then you must collect that hair.</start_of_turn
And you command the patient to place his hand over the groin, and with one or two nails as you deem fit; and that nail should be doubled in this fashion:
or two nails gradually in a cross as in this fashion:</start_of_turn
And collect those veins with fine forceps, with caution, and withdraw them hour by hour until all those veins are cauterized and relaxed.</start_of_turn
And keep in mind that you do not touch the edge of the wound; and if the operation is in the morning before sunrise, do not prick anything except those veins.</start_of_turn
And when you are finished, the hour distills in the wound head or pour it out so that the acidity corrodes what is left of the hair.</start_of_turn
May it be so that if this is not possible at this time, then you place all your attention on what causes the pain, and keep it under observation for a few days until the pain has subsided and the cause has been identified.
And repeat the process as the mistress commands until the patient is healed.</end_of_turn>
And this is the way of the forceps.</end_of_turn>
Chapter xix.</end_of_turn>
Of the reduction of hernias to the navel.</end_of_turn
When you cure hernias with cautery or acute medicine, do not be ashamed of following the narrative and not doing so when it is not beneficial. In such a case, do not do anything other than to make an incision in the apostema and extract all the moisture that is in it until the bone is exposed.</end_of_turn
And therefore when the bone is exposed and sometimes corrupted or black, then you should grasp it with a forceps of this kind:</end_of_turn
And it is called rough grasp, and is made without delay, and the head is rounded thus as if pierced with a needle (as it is in the following form).</end_of_turn
And place that over the corrupted part of the bone, and rotate that between the thighs mentioned, and press your small hand little by little until you believe that that corruption is gone.</end_of_turn
And if there are any herbs, do the same with exsiccatives and stiptic substances.</end_of_turn
Therefore if the part is consolidated and is born well, and if the flesh is separated from the bone and remains for forty days, and is not renewed or apostematized and does not cause any accident, then you shall know that it is healed.</end_of_turn
And if not, then you must repeat the incision to the form of the navel, and according to this manner: if you uncover the bone with cautery or acute medicine, and when you have discovered the bone, then grasp it with the forceps as follows:</end_of_turn
The handle of the forceps is triangular, and the head is first extended into the limb thus as sometimes before.</end_of_turn
And place that over the bone, and hold that of the lacrimal; and extend your hand a little further, and rotate your hand towards the inside until you have pierced all the bone, and you will feel the pain disappear as soon as you remove your hand.</end_of_turn
Therefore restore the part with styptic and exsiccant medicines thus as you would remove a tumor.</end_of_turn
Therefore when the flesh and the part are hardened, the matter which flowed out of the wound returns to the navel, so therefore it is more likely to learn about the pain.</end_of_turn

Of the reduction of the prominence of the heel.</end_of_turn
When the heel protrudes completely and does not cause any discomfort at night or diminish, then you must loosen the pain, and keep following it, and make gentle breezes in the neck during the sacrifice; and place on the heel a liniment which is made of acacia and aloe and beeswax and plaster, and press firmly on the bandage over the heel with powdered herbs.</end_of_turn
And the way of the herbs is that you take lion's mane cloths with four pleats each; and make use of those herbs.</end_of_turn
And place those one over the other according to the quantity of which the heel has need.</end_of_turn And press firmly on those with strong and strict hands; and repeat the breezes during the sacrifice; and stop the breezes and keep the heel straight day and night.</end_of_turn
And if the ligament is softened during treatment, keep it straight.</end_of_turn
And keep the ligament firm both day and night as we have said.</end_of_turn
And if sometimes the heel has already been reduced, that is good, and if not, then repeat the bandage with the herbs and the press and the breezes until it is healed.</end_of_turn

Of the incision of the prominence of the tunica uvula.</end_of_turn
When there is a disruption in the yellow tunic [gallbladder], and it is imminent and the process is expelled beyond the eyelashes like a barley grain, and it is shaped like a man in this way, and you wish to prick it, then the operation is like this: enter the needle at the root of the yellow tunic from the left side to the right side, and then insert the needle again at the place where the double fold is, and make that penetrate and read the first needle according to its position; and then prick the place of the double fold and carry away that part of the yellow tunic in the circle of the needle, and tighten that knot.
And then extract the needle and rest over the yellow substance infused in blood and read until the thread comes out of the wound.
And then care for the yellow substance as much as you can so that when the wound is healed.
And there are some who gather all around the whole part within the circle of the wound so that the imminent great swelling appears, and they perforate it with the blunt needle that comes from the belly of the wound, and run the fatty moisture, and lower the wound and put it inside quickly.
And so tighten up until it is healed

Of the care of gout.</start_of_turn>
This disease which is called gout is nothing but a swelling that is adjusted in the yellow resembling water descending and not that.</start_of_turn
The more the work of the hand is violent in it, the more the disease makes the pain appear on the heel and go away, and if you see the healing coming to the left side, do not dry it, do not let it descend, and keep your hand over it, the disease will see its causes just as it used to.</start_of_turn
And if it does not descend downwards, you know that it is water.</start_of_turn
And if it is not prepared the descent of the healing with water as we have said, when the pain is between your toes, take a blunt needle and cauterize that over the nail until you see a little piece of the yellow substance left over the conjunctiva and the cornea in the crown (within the eye socket), until the healing is expelled from the wound.</start_of_turn
Therefore when it is expelled, then you distill in the yellow liquid cold water in which you have mixed honey or water in which you have already boiled barley and honey.</start_of_turn
And so be treated for the other causes until it is healed.</start_of_turn
Chapter XXXII.</start_of_turn
Of the care of the descending water from the yellow.</start_of_turn
We have already said the species of the water in the division and what is appropriate to perforate when declared, when according to the healing.</start_of_turn
Therefore you must make the pain lie between your toes over a scab and keep the yellow liquid still.</start_of_turn
And so rest your left hand over the left eyelid, if the yellow liquid is in the left eye; or with your right hand if the yellow liquid is in the right eye.</start_of_turn
And so take with your right hand vinegar, if the yellow liquid is left; or with your left hand if the yellow liquid is right.</start_of_turn
And so rest the extremity of vinegar from the crown for the thickness of the ray in the yellow part of the tear duct, and then gently wipe vinegar with your hand over that.</start_of_turn
And so penetrate into the yellow substance and sit that vinegar has already reached its purpose by reason of its heat.</start_of_turn
And so measure the distance of the heel of the vinegar to the pupil is the measure of the space from the pupil to the end of the black, which is the crown of the eye; so that you may see through that pupil with the vision of the eye for the clarity of the cornea.</start_of_turn
And so rest vinegar in the place where the water is, and put your hand over it a little while, and therefore if the water descends quickly, the pain will go away as soon as it has covered its sight, and vinegar in the yellow substance.</start_of_turn
And so rest a moment; therefore if the water has descended, then you take back that other piece that vinegar has not been able to remove.</start_of_turn
And so when it is dry and does not descend, then you easily extract vinegar, and gently move your hand back and forth, and in that dissolve in the water a little clear gem salt and in that wash the eye thoroughly; and then remove the eye from the socket or stop or bandage and put it in olive oil and blood and water and hold it over the yellow liquid.</start_of_turn
May we note that these are of our time, who pause over that same food which is served with broth of honey.
And if you do not obey your medicine at the entrance of the heel for its hardness – for some men of whom the heel is hard like iron – then we must take the sponge which is named alberid of which this is the form:
Therefore perforate at that joint, and do not withdraw your hand from the wound, nor should you desist from giving the medicine until the wound has subsided.
And then apply the medicine as we have said
And you must praise your work, whether you prepare the patient for sleep by making them lie down in the bed in which they sleep on the seat of two in a dark room, and you must prohibit all movement.
And rest in the nature of things so that it may be softened, and do not move the seat at all from the place where it was placed neither to the right nor to the left
And keep the dressing according to its custom until the third day.
And then remove that from that bed and expose the cold air, and make them see some causes, and then return the dressing within seven days.
And do not make them drink anything at the time of the treatments or whenever the infusion is given. There must be enough wine for them so that the water does not irritate excessively because of its great and violent nature
If after this accident the limb should become stiff, we must remove the scab on the seventh day, and rectify that which was done with the wine which caused the scab to form
Then remove the bandage from their eyes and rest over their face for which reason you must regulate their food for several days, because they exist in the dark room.
And gradually remove from that bed and converse with them about their causes.
And know that in the absence of a teacher of vision, it is not excused to leave some vegetables, and when you are sure about the operation
And so we have reached some of those whom we mentioned before, and some have said that it is done with a sponge which is dipped in honey-flavored broth.
However, I have not seen in our land anything like that which has been reported to us, and I do not know whether it is true in the case of some of the free men of antiquity; and it is possible that it is new
These are the forms of medical treatments so that it is about those about whom he who knows them not:
And they are useful for wounds of every kind, or of fire or of iron, and the extraction of their matter with this triangular substance, the acute limb just as well as the other.

Of the care of wounds there is nothing in the nose
When there are wounds of various kinds in the nose, which are adjusted to each other, each of whose causes is like a scorpion's teeth or like a polypoid foot; and this disease is called polypoid which is like that foot represented.</start_of_turn> And it is a gangrenous wound, ulcerated, of yellowish color; and it is like a lion's wound not of yellowish color.</start_of_turn
Therefore, in the case of these lion wounds which are neither fraudulent nor gangrenous, we must make the patient lie down between our thighs and expose him to the sun, and wash the wound, and prick the tissue in those wounds.</start_of_turn And then extract that to the outside, and then cauterize what you have comprehended of those with the pointed cautery until you know that all the wound has been removed; for if there remains any cause of the abcess being possible, then you must retreat that which is left with one of the subtle instruments until no cause remains.</start_of_turn However, if the lord rejoins with blood or if an abscess should occur from the cautery, then you must stop that; or in the case of malignant abscesses, you must cover and cauterize that until it is abcessed and all the cavities are removed.</start_of_turn
And so keep the nose wet with vinegar or wine or water.</start_of_turn However, if the nose is open and moisture proceeds from it into the palate, then you must know that it is already healed.</start_of_turn
If moisture does not penetrate as deeply as it should, you must know that what appears on the surface of the bones of the limbs is not due to an absence of disease.
Therefore you must diligently inquire about the cause of the swelling, and do not neglect any potential cause, and stop after each touch the amount of liquid or matter which may cause discomfort or harm.
And when it has been established that the swelling has occurred, then draw out the foul odor before it reaches the canals of the nerves, and when it is excreted on the surface of the foot, it is like the children do at school when they are flogged, and this is a light cause of this.
Then withdraw both limbs of the body, one that goes over the nose and the other that remains in the nose, and immediately apply warm compresses to the knees of the body, and do this until you believe that the warmth has already reached the knees of the body
Then extract the limb, and leave the opening closed with a bandage, and do this for three days or more until the wound has healed completely.<end_turn>
And finally, when the cause has passed, insert a lead cannula into the nose for a few days until it is healed.<end_turn>
Even if you are diligent in your care, use this as well.
This is the form of the instrument for capturing vapor made with which oils and medicines are distilled in the limbs.
It is made of silver or gold, which is like a small lamp with a wick, just like a wick for a candle, and the meat is similar in shape.<end_turn>
And if you wish, make a closed cannula like a tube, and insert the cannula of the vapor capturing instrument and make it flat, uncovered; to which you must hold that which you will extract from the oil or water that you wish from the juices and from the causes that are subject to it.
End of text.
From that time until now in the limbs of the nose.
The swelling that is seen in the limbs of the nose is not normal; it is remarkable and worthy of attention until the cause has been eliminated.
And for this reason you must immediately institute treatment as soon as the appearance of the swelling, and eradicate all of it.</start_turn> And immediately stop over the area or cauterize or apply a burning medicine that is in the place of it.</start_turn
Even if the treatment is delayed until it is remarkable, consider if it is liquid, thick, of a muddy color and with little sensation, for in that case do not touch that which is the cause of the apostemas; for the swelling caused by this is very harmful to that on which it falls
If the apostema is of a yellow color, touch it gently and not of a dark color, and sometimes when the treatment is possible in all of them, evacuate the patient and apply treatment to that area until it is healed.</start_turn

Of suture of the nose and of the lips and of the ear when the continuity is dissolved by plague or by putrefaction.</start_turn
You must know that when an accident of continuity occurs in one of these cartilages, little confidence is had in that operation except in the case of the wisest men.</start_turn
Therefore, when it is necessary for some cause of these, consider if it is fresh plague on the surface of the wound, and immediately suture the two lips of the wound with sutures, and take care of that until it is healed.</start_turn
And if the lips of the continuity have already separated and some part is still sound, you must immediately remove some part of the apparent cord until it is healed.</start_turn And immediately suture the two lips with sutures and strengthen them, and over them sprinkle pure salt and sesquipedalian plaster, and place over the plaster a piece of fine gauze, or some other consolidating plaster, and leave it in place for two days or three, and then remove that plaster and renew it until the wound has healed.
Mays the manner of the suture is that you add the solution of continuity or with needles just as we have recommended in the suture of the belly, or add the solution of continuity with fidelity just as well as you and make known.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.</start_of_turn>
And if it is necessary to make points on the surface of the foot, then do so with a pointed cautery.</start_of_turn
Then return the intestine or hernia to its cavity, and place your hand over the area to prevent the intestine from coming out.</start_of_turn
You have already opened the space between the patient's thighs, placed a cushion under them, another servant on their legs, and another on their chest, holding their hands.</start_of_turn
Mays the manner of the suture is that you add the solution of continuity or with needles just as we have recommended in the suture of the belly, or add the solution of continuity with fidelity just as well as you and make known.</start_of_turn
When the wound has been adjusted in the groin.
Great care must be taken over the wound that has been adjusted in the groin, because it is prone to suppuration, so that you must suspend it with thread or by means of forceps and make an incision of sufficient length, and let the wound run or drain.</start_of_turn
And if necessary, place over the wound a sterile dressing or other absorbent materials or excisions.</start_of_turn
And if the wound returns, then immediately cut it open again, and cauterize it, so that the wound will not return.</start_of_turn
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.</start_of_turn
Because of the density of bone.
When on the surface of the teeth of the groin and of the heel and between the gums there are adjusted scales, leaves, and some veins are black and are useful for citrosis or vomiting because the gum appears to be corrupted and the teeth are loose.</start_of_turn
Therefore you must remove the cause of the ailment between your thighs and stop the bleeding from its root in the belly, and grind the teeth in which these scales appear to be like sand so that no cause remains that can cause decay, and that the blackening and vomiting cease.</start_of_turn
Therefore if this is the last time you are doing this, do not do it; but if not, then repeat the remedy tomorrow and the day after and the day after until the matter settles down in what you desire.</start_of_turn
And remember that the teeth have required various forms of root movement and various figures according to how you prepare your operation.</start_of_turn And therefore the instruments with which the tooth is grasped from the groin are different from the instruments with which it is grasped between the teeth according to other forms, and these forms of grasp must be prepared by you, which you will see both in this work and in others.</start_of_turn
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.</start_of_turn
Extraction of teeth.</start_of_turn
You must cure the tooth of its pain with all your skill and later in total eradication of it, because there is no cause that can replace the loss of it when it is eradicated, which is a sublimation that is excused in the eradication of it.</start_of_turn
Moreover, when the ailment is urgent that the tooth be eradicated, you must firmly declare that the painful tooth is the one that must be eradicated, because many veins are deceived by the pain and believe that the pain has passed away, and you must demonstrate that it is still painful in the healthy tooth, and you must eradicate that tooth and only then will the pain cease, as we have already seen in the operation of the barbers.</start_of_turn
Therefore you must be certified that the painful tooth is the one that must be eradicated, and that you know well, when you have scarred around the tooth with the spatula in which there is any virtue, until the tooth is dissolved from the gum of the whole part, and you must use either forceps or fine pliers from the beginning gradually until it is complete.</start_of_turn
And with greater force you must hold the great ones for good speech or great stupidity, and stop the bleeding from the root of the pain between the teeth that you must keep from injuring, and gently remove the tooth following the rule so that neither the pain increases nor the major pain is caused.</start_of_turn
Therefore, if it is not forgotten, take one of those instruments and put it on all parts easily and forcefully so that the evacuation is made as quickly as possible.
If the tooth is cracked or broken, take care that you cover your hand with a bandage and hold it firmly at the root with your thumb so that it does not split at the time of your constriction on that part and hold it there.</end_of_turn>
Cover the surrounding area with excessive care and sacrifice in the circuit of the whole gum and keep your hand firm so that you do not break that part and leave it loose, and return to the patient more attentively than the first pain of the part.</end_of_turn>
And keep in mind that you should not do what ignorant barbers often do in their frenzy and daring to eradicate them, since they do not administer what we have recommended; for many sick people have reported that these doctors have caused their ailments to become more severe than before, or that they have left them with some of their roots remaining, or that they have extracted the diseased bone from the jaw just as many have reported.</end_of_turn
And for the eradication of these things, wash the mouth with warm wine or vinegar with salt.</end_of_turn>
And if it is necessary to use holy water to help, just as many have reported, then take some of the holy water and sprinkle it over the wound, and if you do not confirm the holy water, cauterize.</end_of_turn
The shape of the forceps and pliers that are usually used to grasp the tooth at the beginning is long handled with a wide thumb so that they do not bend when working.</end_of_turn
And they are just as well when the thumb is wide as when you first begin to use them, so that they are not bent when working.</end_of_turn
And they are useful of Indian steel descending useful of mercury extramitted, and in the extraction of these there are teeth that enter one another and break for constriction descending strong, and some of them are in the shape of the beak of a heron which has been named ciconia, so it is wide, and strong constriction.</end_of_turn

About the eradication of teeth and the extraction of the bones of the jaws that are fractured.</end_of_turn
When you must eradicate a tooth that is fractured, keep your hand still over the area around the tooth for a day or two until the swelling subsides; and in the meantime apply an ointment or liniment to the extraction area which has the shape of the heron’s beak called ciconia or guinea fowl, of strong constriction.</start_of_turn
The extractions are useful with lime or aloe.</start_of_turn
And if you do not obey my orders with these forceps or pliers, keep your hand on the root and remove all the pulp and insert the instrument which is called atali, which is a small lever whose shape is like this:
And be of short handle large a little, and do not be deceived so that it is not fractured.</start_of_turn
Therefore, if for this the root is forgotten, no; but if so, help me with other instruments of which these are the forms: the first instrument has a triangular handle in which there is some thickness.</start_of_turn
The second instrument has a triangular shape and a more slender handle.</start_of_turn
And already with this instrument you will have two slopes of which this is the form to follow:</start_of_turn And with other instruments which I will precede in the scraping of teeth; for with this instrument which is like a great onion, this is the form.</start_of_turn
Of the triangular handle either wide or narrow, which is of some thickness, and do not be deceived so that it is not fractured.</start_of_turn
And so it is with other instruments for teeth, which are similar to the others.</start_of_turn
And the wise and skillful artists in this art, according to what they mean for the operation and the various diseases; for these are the diseases for which the ancients did not say or prescribe any specific instrument, for the shapes of various species.</start_of_turn
And if the jawbone or other bones of the mouth are fractured, or if you are in doubt, keep your hand firmly on that in its place with the instruments and forceps that we have mentioned in the extraction of the roots of the teeth, and help me with the one that has this shape:</start_of_turn
And let it be small at first and gradually increase in size, and let it be tightly bound or held at the mouth so that it does not escape or flee until the bone is completely healed; and then restore the area with suitable medicines.
If the bone is small, reduce the swelling; however, let the reduction of the swelling and its blackness be gradual, and care for it until it is healed.

On the care of prominent teeth compared to others.</start_of_turn>
When teeth are prominent in relation to their natural shape, and especially when this is due to the females, and more so to the venerated toes; therefore you must consider: if the tooth is not properly aligned with another tooth, and if it is not possible to file or splint it, then its root must be extracted; although it is not annexed to another tooth, you must nevertheless insert your instrument into this area with this tooth; and it is similar to the biting of a pig, and is made of Indian iron of extracted spicery sharp.</start_of_turn
And let your incision be on the side where you insert the tooth, for several days because of the hardness of the tooth, and do not be like others concerning the teeth.</start_of_turn
And if the prominent tooth is exposed to filing, let that be done with a file made of Indian iron of the same shape:
And let it be of Indian iron, and the margin be well rounded; and be of little points like the file which is used for needles, so that the tooth is gradually filed over several days without damaging another tooth.</start_of_turn And return the tooth to its place, and reduce the swelling of the wound.</start_of_turn
And if there is a fragment of tooth that has been fractured and is lying on the tongue, let it be covered so that the expectation of that fragment is lost and it is evened out, and be filled so that the tongue does not burn or the word does not corrupt.</start_of_turn
Chapter XXXIII.</start_of_turn
On the restoration of decayed teeth with gold or silver.</start_of_turn
When teeth decay before concussion and loosening due to percussion or extraction, and the patient does not suffer from pain, and you have cared for that with medicinal treatments, and it has not been of any use, then so that they do not fall out again, gold must be used for those that are strong, and not silver, because silver turns green and soon becomes poor over several days, although gold never changes.</start_of_turn
And let the gold be of such fineness and size as to be able to enter between the teeth; and the shape of the restoration is that you take hold of the gold and double it between two healthy teeth, and that you make it grow between two divergent fissures of the gold between two decayed teeth, or if one or two, until it reaches the intact tooth of the other side.</start_of_turn And gradually tighten the thread from the beginning of the procedure, and strengthen your hand for ease and wisdom until it is not decayed.</start_of_turn
And let your diligence be such that you do not escape the roots of the teeth.</start_of_turn
And insert the surplus of the gold into the forceps or tweezers, and add them to each place in the mouth, and convert them so that they are hidden between the healthy tooth and the decayed tooth, so that it does not harm the tongue.</start_of_turn And thus let it rest like this until it is healed.</start_of_turn
And if it is slippery or soft, strengthen that or those with another gold in such a way that it is always strong.</start_of_turn
And this is the form of the teeth and the figure of the restoration of two healthy teeth and two decayed teeth, as well as when these are linked:
And when a tooth or two are returned in this way near any other teeth, and they are reduced as we have recommended, and that they remain fixed.</start_of_turn
And do nothing but make good artifices and be wise.</start_of_turn
And many herbs are suitable for various causes of bone loss in cows, and it is useful to them as a means of preventing tooth decay, and is placed in the place where the tooth is lacking, and is strengthened as we have said, and remains and serves for a long time.</start_of_turn

The ligament which is seen on the tongue forbids what is being said or is natural to it, or is accidental and caused by a wound which has already healed.</end_of_turn>
As for the operation, we burn the mouth of the wound, and if there is any tissue remaining in the belly; we elevate the tongue and then cut through the ligament along the width until the tongue is freed from its retraction.</end_of_turn>
If there is any hardness or swelling, and that which has remained from the wound; then when you have cut through the ligament along the width, until the swelling has disappeared.</end_of_turn
And take care that there is no tear in the skin of the heel and that you cut through the vessel and let blood flow freely.</end_of_turn>
Then wash the remnants of the incision with oil or vinegar or with cold water; and place the tongue loose; so that the one which has the patient has left the tongue in any way for that it should not be solidified again.</end_of_turn
If there is bleeding, place pressure over the wound for a while; if the bleeding does not stop, then cauterize the area around the wound which is similar to hair. And then treat the other causes which remain until the patient is healed.</end_of_turn>

Extraction of the ranula leaves the tongue.
Some wounds which occur leave the tongue swollen resembling a small tongue which hinders the natural operation of the tongue; and when it is greatly swollen it is impossible to open the mouth.</end_of_turn
As for the operation, we burn the mouth of the wound sitting in front of the sun and consider the swelling.</end_of_turn
And if sometimes you see a yellow or black, hard one, which the patient does not feel, do not touch that which is brittle.</end_of_turn
And if it turns white, in which there is moisture, then put on the thumb of your hand, and cut through with a sharp knife, and cut it off completely; and if blood flows at the time of your operation, then stop the bleeding by pressing the wound for a while, until the bleeding stops.</end_of_turn
And then return to your work until you have finished treating them, until they have been washed with oil or vinegar and salt; and care for the other treatment which remains until the patient is healed.</end_of_turn>

Extraction of the wisdom tooth and that which is nothing in the jaw and of the other wisdom teeth.</end_of_turn
When the wisdom tooth is impacted, so are the salivary glands which are gathered together, and which are inflamed and are two wisdom teeth, which when you treat them with water as we have said in the division and it is not healed, then you consider if the wisdom tooth is hard, yellow in color, without feeling, do not touch that which is iron.</end_of_turn
And if it is of black color and the root is large, do not touch that which is iron for the flow of blood; take away that which is inside either by force, or you will break that, or it will break by itself.</end_of_turn
And if it is white in color, soft, and the root is thin, then that is what must be cut.</end_of_turn
And the operation is that you consider, before you start your operation, if the wisdom tooth has already rested for some time naturally or has decreased somewhat; and when you touch the mouth of the patient, and the head of the tooth is in the belly, and you burn the mouth, and the servant takes hold of the tongue of the patient between their hands as instructed by the instrument which is like this:
And it is done of silver or of gold, and is thin like a coat.</end_of_turn
So when you touch the tongue and you have shown the wisdom tooth to your patient, and you have grasped that which is in the belly, then take hold of the thumb and leave that in the wound, and pull that out to the outside as much as you can.</end_of_turn And another one which you must pull out is any cause of the membranes, and then cut that with this instrument which is like this
And another one which you must pull out is any cause of the membranes, and then cut that with this instrument which is like this And it is assembled like forceps, however the handles of them are curved, so that the orifice of each one is in the inside of the other, not pointed, which is iron indeed without a handle.</end_of_turn
May it be known that this instrument is not at your disposal, for the hour indicates that from this spur it must be known: that it is acute at one end, not acute at the other.
And since you have indicated one side, indicate the other according to this manner of handling, and then the patient will regain from the cold water that is being poured
Or if there is a flow of urine, guard the water of decoction of urine of millet or of marigold and remain as close as possible to the causes that cause it, until the flow of urine is restricted, and then care for that which remains that is healthy
And every vegetable grows in the ground others afterwards when two carbuncles are made, and indicate those according to how you did and said at the incision of two abscesses engulfing.
And I already treated a a woman with an abscess that was born in her groin, which abscess tended towards a dark color, with little sensation, which abscess had already closed her groin, and the woman breathed with difficulty, and I had already prohibited her from eating and drinking water, and she was already on the verge of death if more water had not been given for a day or two.
And the abscess had already burst that two measures of barley could fit inside where it burst out for two fingers wide
Therefore I closed it fistulistically and remained on one of them, and I pulled out the other, and I threw out a large portion of it, and I immediately indicated that which was not included from the other side, and I opened the mouth of it, and I compressed its tongue, and I remained on the abscess with the thumb
And I immediately excised a large part of it, and there ran out only a little urine. Therefore it is absolutely the groin of that woman, and she immediately began to drink water, and I forbade her from eating, therefore I did not cease to indicate that abscess until many days passed, and it happened that another abscess formed in place of that one, which I indicated as long as that one was prolonged
Therefore I went quickly and cauterized the groin of that woman, so as to prevent any further infection; and I went away and did not see her again until death took her from this life.

Instruction for incision when it is urgent.
When catarr descends to the heel, and it is swollen and long, the hour it is not named perpendicular; and if it is in the outer part large and round, and the hour it is called bubble
May it be known that when it is cured with the water that we have said in the division, and you do not take care of your incision, and sometimes the abscess bursts already when it is small and soft, the hour you must know that that which is added round about is already included; and if it is in that length, and it is bloody, of a yellowish or blackish color, and is not at a distance of a finger's breadth, the hour you must fear the incision of it, for there is fear of the patient.
And when you have done that according to the manner that I have said of its whiteness and length, that you will see that the patient is relieved and will praise your tongue with the instrument with which you proceed; and you will put that away and indicate that with two instruments which I have named at the incision of two abscesses
And you must know that you must not indicate that except when it is adjusted according to the natural measure of infection, for if you indicate it more, you will make it worse
And concerning the incision, use the water which we have recommended at the incision of two abscesses, and care for that which remains that is healthy.
May it be known that if the patient’s pain is scattered by the incision of the abscess, cover that you use an instrument in the cauterization of the abscess that your fear is not great, and the manner of handling the instrument is only with sharp water, and that you grasp the patient’s head firmly so that he does not move, and immediately take hold of the tongue with the instrument which we have mentioned, and immediately take some water that we have recommended in the chapter of cauterization, and comfort that living cause, and pause that which does not spread or soften, and from that fill the hollow of the instrument that has this shape:
Whether the limb of the curvature in which the medicine is placed is like the curvature of a ray’s heel, and pause the instrument with the medicine over the nail, the patient will lick over the lips with his tongue so that saliva or mucus from the mouth of that medicine will not remain on the groin of the abscess and that it will be expelled from that.
And immediately put your hand on the medicine and press that over the uvula for about a quarter of an hour until it is softened and subdued by the bite of the medicine
If you wish, take a sponge and wet the extremity of the ray, and immerse the sponge in the medicine, and apply the ray to the sponge in a canula larger than the sponge itself, and do so until you achieve what you desire from the cauterization of the bladder, and then remove the sponge when it becomes dry and falls off in approximately three or four days.
If you do not agree with the effect of the medicine, repeat it, and when the cauterization has finished, remove the medicine from the bladder through the urethra, and mix a little of the medicine with cold water, and let it cool, and apply a bandage, and keep it bandaged until it is healed.</end_of_turn>
This method of treatment is more secure and less laborious than the initial method and is less likely to cause fear.
Some herbs are cured by that which is more subtle than cautery and initial fear, which is cured by fumigation in this manner: take calamine, soap, origanum, rue, saffron, Arabic acacia seeds, chamomile, and barley in equal quantities, and mix them with wine vinegar, and boil; then let the vinegar cool and put a little piece of charcoal on the bottom of the vessel, over which place an instrument with an iron hook according to this manner; make a burn of silver or iron.</end_of_turn>
And immerse the extremity in the mouth of the patient until the vapor makes the bladder rise above the navel, until the bladder is not opaque.</end_of_turn>
And repeat the procedure until the swelling has gone down, and take care that you do not perform this treatment at the beginning of an attack of stones, because it would be too strong for the stone, and would not help but aggravate the pain, but you must declare the presence of stones after performing this treatment.</end_of_turn>
Or if you do not have this instrument, take a tube and put a plug of wax in the extremity of the limb, so that the mouth of the bladder is covered, because the plug of wax prevents the vapor from burning the mouth.</end_of_turn>

From the extraction of stones and of that which adheres in the bladder and of the other causes.</end_of_turn
Swelling caused by stones adheres in the bladder or heel bone or any other cause.</end_of_turn
Then you must say that you have seen that there is something apparent in the bladder, for you must touch the tongue with the instrument to see clearly what it is.
And that which is not apparent and is hidden in the bladder, you must say that you have vomited the bladder before the food is digested in the stomach, for this is the cause which makes the bladder sore if it is not vomited; or that you have swallowed the bladder with a spoonful of broth or a bit of lettuce or a piece of bread; or that you have put a spoonful of sponge marine soaked in oil in the mouth and held it firmly in place, and when you have pulled it out you will find that the stones have been expelled. Or take a hook and drink with faith bound, and hold it firmly in place; or take a cup and drink the medicine and drink the broth.
If these causes have not been expelled, you may use an instrument of lead according to this manner:
And make it larger than a ray and put a cavity in the extremity of the limb which you will enter into its cavity easily.</end_of_turn>
And keep the heel bone elevated above your head, and take care that you do not touch the bladder with your hands or with anything else, or that the physician puts his hand on it.</end_of_turn
However, when the bladder has entered, it is more painful, for its science of the location of the cause and its removal, and pulls its hand from the instrument in its place, all as much as it is prepared for it until it is expelled.</end_of_turn
End of treatise.</end_of_turn>
On the extraction of the blood clot attached to the bladder.</end_of_turn
When blood clots are treated with medicine as mentioned in the division of the treatment with medicines and not confirmed, consider the time of the bladder of the patient at sunrise, for you have compressed the tongue with the instrument which you have recommended.</end_of_turn
Therefore if you sometimes see blood clots, extract them in small pieces or with gentle movements appropriately.</end_of_turn
If it is not possible to draw out the stone with your hands, then take a curved needle and insert it into the bladder of the patient, and then place on the curve of the needle a burning iron, and do so until (the stone) is so softened that it is unable to remain in the bladder.
Then prepare a sponge filled with cold water, and open the mouth of the patient with this, and wash the mouth with this; and do not swallow from this any cause and for a while move the water an hour later with your hand, because the stone has cooled down as much as the water catzed.</end_of_turn>
If it has not been extracted from the water that we have recommended, then fumigate the patient with vinegar or by suffocating them with the instruments that we have recommended in the fumigation of the uvula.
Do so, so that it will fall.
This is another method of operation in the fumigation of this, that you take a bowl in which there are burning charcoal and cover the bowl with a lid in the middle of which is a hole, and put at the bottom of that hole the extremity of the instrument; and then withdraw the fumigation; and place the patient's mouth over the hole of the needle, and close their mouth so that the fumigation is not lost until you know that the fumigation has reached the stone, because the stone has fallen down.</end_of_turn>
And if it does not fall, then repeat the fumigation many times; and abstain the patient from drinking, and eat bland foods and others, and do not drink water, and if necessary keep this regimen outside.
And this is the form of the instrument with which the stone is extracted from the bladder when it is seen; and it is similar to tweezers in this way as well as in others, but it has in it some curve: which is placed against the bladder, and the extremity of it is similar to the beak of a heron, which is hooked, in which is grasped from lime, so that when it compresses any cause, it does not yield.</end_of_turn>

In which is the sum of the words in the opening of apices and in the section of them.</start>
The apostemas are various species, of various methods, as it is remembered from their description in this book.</start><end_turn>
And they are diverse in perforation and section for two methods, of which one is for the species of apostemas themselves when they are in the middle; and for what they compress of humidity.</start><end_turn
And the second method is for the places in which the diseases of the body occur, for example the apostema that happens in the head is different from the apostema that happens in the heel; and the apostema that happens in the fleshy parts is different from the apostema that happens in the joints; and each one of them is treated according to their operation.</start><end_turn>
And sometimes apostemas are such that they should not be perforated except at the proper maturity of the patient in those or alongside them.</start><end_turn
So other apostemas are such that they must be grasped when they are crossed, and are not mature according to their complement, just as apostemas that are proximate to the joints, for an apostem that is proximate to a joint is prolonged until it is weak in that area, and it corrupts the ligaments or nerves of that joint, because it is a harmful cause of contraction of that limb; or it is an apostem of a major limb, and if you delay the perforation of it when it is mature it does not benefit the major limb; or it is proximate to the heel, so perforate it only when it is not mature; and do not perforate it cruelly, except for non-compliance of digestion, but only for that which is proximate to the heel, so that you do not weaken the heel and that it is elongated to the parts of the heel, and that there is a fistula, or that it is beneficial in the end that it is not healthy.</start><end_turn But you must know the time of perforation of the apostema, and that is when it is mature.</start><end_turn
And you must know that it is mature when there is the cessation of pain and fever, and alongside the diminution of swelling and pulse, and the clarity of the head of the apostem, and the other signs.</start><end_turn
And you must know that you must perforate in the place furthest from the apostem and furthest from the navel.</start><end_turn
And the perforation should always be made along the length of the bone or limb, if the apostemas are in the parts of the feet or hands, and in the place of the lacercies, of the cords of the nerves, of the arteries; and finally, in all those places where there is no reflection; for in those where there is reflection, use perforation according to that limb.</start><end_turn
More than when the afterbirth is in the flesh, then it is necessary to read the puncture of the bowels until confirmed the digestion of them according to custom, as we have said; for if you puncture the preceding one of these, you prolong the course of the poor of them and cause much discomfort, and you make the lips of them scorched and the depth of them.
More than when the afterbirth is in the flesh, then it is necessary to read the puncture of the bowels according to the breadth of the bone or the body as is necessary, or according to what the member digests.
And so you must administer a small puncture, in great afterbirths a great puncture and wide or many sections according to the diversity of the size of the afterbirths
And others are of the afterbirths in which you must make the cordena concave and inflamed, when it is necessary because it is in place that it already lies, as with those that happen in dropsy and swellings.
And of those that are incised with section having three angles; and of those it is incised as with the shape of a laurel leaf, as with the afterbirths of the spleen
And of those there are those in which round section and lunar section are administered, and they resemble the others
More than those to whom it does not seem like external leons, you must not puncture that with a superficial puncture, or plane simply.
And when the afterbirth is great and has collected much dirty matter, you must puncture that and do not be afraid that you will extract all of it in that hour; having extracted a part of it, and when you have put the afterbirth back into the other day, and having extracted another part greater, and having made it so that there are many soft ones according to degrees until it is forgotten
And more especially if the illness is of cold origin, or woman with premenstrual pain, or a small child, or an old woman in decrepitude, for the animal spirit of matters resolves itself with the discharge of the dirt, and it is very well that the illness is cured, and you perform the operation for it
Keep this chapter with great caution, and when you puncture these afterbirths, cover that you extract the humors and consider therefore whether the humors of the afterbirth are few or are flat sections, when you administer the former or mixed with coto of antic; and if the afterbirth is great, and the rents of the puncture are much, cover that you stay still in any place until they recover together.
And if in the afterbirth a part of the cord is torn or has been concaved in the circuit, cover that you complex it with coto old or with thread made of silk, as when you carry bread or cheese, with moisture; and strengthen that within the third day; and when you have finished that, care for that and cure the one who has suffered within that until it is healed.
More than if blood flows out in the hour of your operation, cover that you administer cold water and vinegar in which a thread of silk is soaked, and pause that over the place of the flow of blood soft ones.
More than if the flow of blood persists, cover that you administer regulation and care and powders that I have recommended in many places of this our book and division
More than if it is in winter, and the place of the afterbirth is a place of many nerves, cover that you cover the places with vinegar and oil caut, and pause those on the places.
And if it is in summer, and the places are fleshy, cover that you pause powders with eggshells with water and oil or with wine and oil, and all that is cold until the third day, as we have said, and cover that you remove the afterbirth and extract that and administer in the care of it what is appropriate until it is healed
And thus it is necessary for the knowledge of the care of afterbirths universally, more especially according to the way of distinction that we have already said of every afterbirth in what manner it is to be cared for by chapters individually.
Chapter 61.</end_turn>
Of the section of afterbirths which occur in the cord of the head.
In the small cord of the head small afterbirths, and they are of various knots which contain tunics that are their making; and the various ones are soft.
And of those there are soft ones, and those which contain moisture resembling lime. And of those which contain moisture resembling sponges, and resembling them; and of those which are like pebbles, hard
And in the section of all this, and in the extraction of those [intestines], there is no fear, as you must know the extension of those does not cause harm to the arteries.
And the operation in section of those is that you should extract them with an instrument of the kind you see, which is called between them, until you know that it contains.</end_of_turn>
For if what contains is moisture, then split that at the section according to its length by superficial section in this way:</end_of_turn>
And begin at the section of the line of B to the line of G. Since when the moisture is evacuated, then you will extract that for which that moisture contains, and do not leave any cause of this, for if there remains from any cause, it will return again.</end_of_turn>
And then immerse the wound in Egyptian unguents, if present, or in water and salt; and fill that with that the wound and leave that until tomorrow, for that which is corroded will remain from that wound.</end_of_turn
And do that again over the wound with Egyptian unguents according to the state of the wound, until you are confident that there is no remaining cause of that wound; for the wound will be cured with the unguents until it is healed.</end_of_turn
And if after that there remains nodes of fat, then you will make an incision according to this manner:</end_of_turn with a section having the shape of a cross, and grasp the nails between two lips of the section and remove that from all around, and exert your virtue in the extraction of the membrane which contains that.</end_of_turn
May it be that your artery is causing harm, but know that I will tell you that first.
And thus do that in the lacation of the section and its care as we have told you; and the section over the lacation is lighter, because it is of little wound and little moisture.</end_of_turn
And many of these wounds are of such a nature that they are in the head of such men as those with whom there is no moisture; for the cause of this is that I do not know of any wound in the head of an old woman which does not swell up like a deaf, ashen, white woman, which cannot be softened, and if there be any of those in this place, plague that.</end_of_turn
But in other wounds that happen in the head, another is not like this, as for example the wounds that happen at the heads of children and you must take the reason for the earlobes, for indeed the section of these is superficial.</end_of_turn
And stop the perforation of those from the lower part of them so that the body of the pain is relieved in the lower parts.</end_of_turn
And thus take care of those with what agrees with the care of that cure.</end_of_turn>
Chapter LXII.</end_of_turn>
Of the section of scrofulas which happen in the groin.</end_of_turn
These wounds are covered with fat in the groin and in the buttocks and in the armpits; and some are found in other parts of the body.</end_of_turn
And so those which happen in the groin, and those fat which is generated between them, and all scrofula of those is dispersed from its own membrane, and just as in the nodes and the wound of the head, as we have recommended.</end_of_turn
And the species of these scrofulas are fat, for some of those are soft, and some which contain moisture, and some are malignant which do not obey treatment.</end_of_turn
So when you have good fortune in the Touchment, of which the color of the liquid which manifests is proper to the color of the codena, and is bad throughout, and is not annexed to the nerves of the groin, nor to the veins, nor to the artery, and is not a swelling, because you must incision that which is on the surface of the part from the part beyond the body of the line of G between the line of B, and scrape that from all around, and stretch two lips of the codena on one inch, or on two fingers if you need them, as we have said in the wounds of the head, and extract that little by little.</end_of_turn
And be more cautious that you do not cut the vein or nerve.</end_of_turn
And let the sponge not be rough, that you do not put your hand on the wound, or that you ask the patient, and that you only incision what is necessary; for if you cut the vein or artery and you prevent your work, then pause in the violent bleeding or other blood clots which remain flowing from the wound, and open the wound, and leave that until the pain has subsided from the wound and the wound has become softened and has become fluid.</end_of_turn When the patient is unconscious.
Therefore return to your operation until you have completed it.
And inquire about the belly, saying whether there is any other small swelling, so that you may decide to lance them and drain them.
And if it is in the root of the large vein, cover the hour that you do not lance that swelling from its root. Then cover that with a firm fold and keep it until it falls down by itself spontaneously.
And then fill the wound with old cloth which you have already soaked in Egyptian balsam, and care for that
And if you lance the whole swelling, cover that you adjust the two lips of the wound and cause so much pus that no liquid remains superfluous
May be sometimes there remains some surplus of liquid because of the greatness of the swelling, cover that you understand the root of that, extract that and administer suture and that which is said.
And that which contains humidity of the swelling, perforate that with a superficial perforation here where you see the maturation of them, and stop perforating until such time as you see pus coming from the bottom of the body, as we have said
And then administer perforation, cover with ointment and keep it until these are gone, so that it consumes that which is remaining from the corruption And when the wound has already healed, care for it with ointment of generative herbs until it is healed
Chapter XLVIII.
Of excision of the spur of the heel in an accident where it causes him to limp.
I say that this excision in the heel is done by the ancients, and no one in our land has ever seen it done otherwise
This is the inscription of the sermon of these people.
May be in women there has not been any squinting, cover that the extraction of the heel be avoided, as it is not of any use for healing these things rather it may cause that all the veins and the greater part of the patient to suffer here
May be in those who have spurs of the heel which are caused in the mouth or limping or two on the ankle, when the disease is not in the bone, cover the use of the excision of the heel to escape the loss which is useful for perforation
Therefore cover that when we want to perform it, that we excise the heel leaving three circles of the circles of the heel, or four at most for the quantity, that the excision is in cartilage, not in cartilage, and this place is suitable for excision because it is private of bone and the vessels of the soul are loosened from it
And if the doctor is inexperienced, cover that he extends the tendon of the heel with oil, and then open the tendon until it reaches the canal, but avoid the vessels of the soul if you see any cause of that.
And then excise it according to what we have recommended; and it is significant about the excision of the canal for the inflammation which is of that origin with that which is of the fracture and for the loosening of the voice
And leave the wound open for some time.
Therefore when the hour has passed in which perforation is feared, add two lips to the edge of the wound, and sew only that which is cartilage
And then administer medicines that make the bone grow until it is healed
And thus Albucasis says that the sum of the sermon which we have recommended, exposure is nothing but to see that already from these spurs of the heel the limb of the disease has been loosened, and the disease is overcome within death, and the soul from it is separated, and these go to infect the epiglottis so that the soul can breathe the disease over the place of the wound for any breath, and be saved from death.
And thus I command you to leave the wound open until the malice of the disease has passed; and the malice of it is for three days; and therefore I command you to close the wound when it has passed, and care for it until it is healed
And what I have seen for my part is that a servant brought a bowl and poured it into the heel and pierced with that a part of the bone of the lung, and I was called to care for it, and I covered the blood just as it is emitted from a dead man, and I uncovered the wound and covered the soul which was sitting on the wound little.
Therefore I confess that no swelling or redness had occurred, and that the pain was caused by the plague, which cured as soon as the wound healed.
And do not command the servant if she does not understand, and when she has recovered she will return to her duties with greater zeal
And now I say that there is no fear in the section of the heel

And it is according to two methods, either it is natural or accidental.</end_turn
And in the natural one it is not necessary to cure it.</end_turn
And the accidental one is according to two methods, one of which is like grass knots, and the other method is like an abscess which is caused by the bursting of an artery, and in that case there is fear.</end_turn And do not assume it is a fever until it is great.</end_turn And you must know that if you find it like grass knots and you do not suspect any of the veins, then you must consider that there is an abscess there and extract it from the skin and the fat; and if not, it must be treated in its entirety until it is healed.
Chapter XLV.</end_turn
Of the section concerning the different kinds of nodes.</end_turn
Of the nodes there are many kinds and I have already mentioned all the kinds in the division.</end_turn
And you must know that I recommend distinguishing between a node and an extrusion in order to avoid doubt.</end_turn
Therefore I say that an extrusion is a quality of fever, pain and violent heat until the swelling of the fluid is calmed; and it is completed by putrefaction when the fever, the pain and the heat cease.</end_turn
But a node is not a quality of fever, pain or heat, but rather that which is like a stone or a sac filled with urine.</end_turn
And it is according to the color of the body, and it begins like a cobblestone and is like wax, both large or small, and they are of two kinds, one of which is greasy and contains moisture, and the colors of the moisture are many, as I have already said in the division.</end_turn
Therefore, when you reach the treatment of the node, you must expel that and inquire about the beginning of its suffering, according to the form that will come in the chapter that is next to this one.</end_turn
And this is the method of inquiring about abscesses and all kinds of nodes, that you take this suffering and bring that which is in the center of the abscess to the most humid place that you find in the abscess, and you will remove the strings that you say until you know that the suffering has already penetrated the skin.</end_turn
And finally put your hand according to the measure of the size of the abscess, and extract the abscesses and consider what remains of them.</end_turn
And if the current moisture of any color has been expelled, then you must consider the superficial section according to what I have said concerning other abscesses.</end_turn
And if there is no moisture remaining from the center, then you know that it is fat.</end_turn
And dry it over which has the shape of a cross according to this shape:</end_turn like this, and suspend that which is blunt, and remove the skin from all around easily, and keep the skin or sac, if possible, over that and extract the pus from the node.</end_turn
But if it breaks in the operation, it is not possible to extract that pus, and many veins are filled with blood, and you must extract it piecemeal until no cause remains.</end_turn
For if there remains any cause, little or much, the node will return as before.</end_turn
And if sometimes some small part remains, then complete the wound with some sharp corrosive powders and stretch the wound, and place a caut over that which is not an abscess, and care for the other wound until it is healed.</end_turn
If it is a great swelling, then touch the two lips of the patient and care for that which is nearest to the area affected.
Even if the pulse is on the opposite side, or is not pulsating, touch the area and fill the cavity with lead that is old and rough; keep it there for two days or three until the swelling subsides and the inflammation subsides. Then remove what is superfluous from the node.</end_of_turn>

The middle expert's form is like this:</start_of_turn
The small expert's form is like this:</start_of_turn

Medium-sized scapel shape:</end_of_turn
Small-sized scapel shape.</end_of_turn>
The extremities of those which are cut are sharp, and the others are not sharp, and they are not stopped in this manner, but rather because it is necessary to help in the excision of the nodes, in order to avoid injuring blood vessels or nerves, and for those who are skilled in surgery to restore order and tranquility through the application of which they find relief from the pain of the excision of the apposition.</end_of_turn>

They are useful for blood, round with some length, and are subtle.</end_of_turn
And that these three kinds of winds are useful because they interrupt the flow of blood with speed when necessary, and when they are not necessary, they are not medicine.</end_of_turn
But do not use them to interrupt blood in any part of the body, and do not use them except in cartilaginous places, just like in the lacerations of the veins and arteries, and in the lacerations of the bones, and of the nipples, and the belly and the armpits, and it is similar to their lacerations of the cartilaginous humors.</end_of_turn
And many other herbs are useful for those instruments and other small things that resemble bags of seeds according to this shape; for which blood is interrupted when it is necessary for phlebotomy, or due to the incision of a vein or artery.</end_of_turn

Or if the breast hangs downwards towards the lower parts and is softened by its size just like women, when it is necessary to divide it into two, cut it with two lunar incisions like a figure, of which each one contains the other at the end of each one, until the major line contains the minor line according to this shape of the line of B and the line of G. And remove the cord that is between two edges of the wound, and keep the swelling down, and administer what has been said of the suture and the powder that is necessary for the care until it is healed.</end_of_turn

And those that contain humidity; and those that contain humidity cover that they be incised at the new moon according to this figure: from the line of G to the line of B. And when everything is evacuated from the abscess of the thigh, then you complete the wound and read it into the other day.
And return the wound either at the end or at the beginning as convenient at that time, until it is healed
And if the abscess is of the species of nodes, and of the scrophulas, then you split over that vein as we have said in the section about the scrophulas equally
May if the disease is widespread in this way that it will not suffice to reduce it, then administer in it cautery as we have said before
Capital xlix.</start_of_turn>
Of the excision of abscesses that happen by incision or by vein
When the incision is ruptured, and the cord is consolidated which is over that, then move away the vessels that accompany the abscess. It is known that inflammation and abscess are for the artery or vein: for when the abscess is for incision it is long aggregated in the precordial region; and that when you enter the abscess with the fingers, sitting in it where there is a stridor.
And that which is for the vein is returned to the manifestation of the body
And the excision about this abscess is an error, especially in those who leave the veins, and in the groin, and in the heel, and in many places of the body; and it is not great, therefore cover that its cure by iron should be avoided, and that which is in the limbs, or at the head, should be avoided.
Moreover concerning that which is of its kind for the inflammation of the orifice of the incision, split the cord section in the long; and immediately put on the incision with needles and cover the incision with a dressing until it is uncovered.</start_of_turn>
And immediately put over that needle and make that penetrate into the other side, and tighten the incision with a thread in two places, — which causes you to see two arteries broken in extraction.</start_of_turn
And immediately put on the place that is between two ligaments with a sponge until you see the whole thing that is in it, and dissolve the abscess.</start_of_turn
And immediately administer care in which is engendered poverty until the ligaments fall; and immediately care that is convenient at that time until it is healed.</start_of_turn
And if the abscess is for the excision of a vein, then cover that you must have at your hand what is at your disposal of the abscess at the cord, and immediately insert the needle except the place where you had your hand, and make that penetrate; and be in that fold double until you extract that from the other side, and immediately ligate the abscess with a good thread as I have said above concerning the tying of two parts of the thread of two limbs.</start_of_turn
Moreover if you fear that you will extract the thread, then immediately put on the thread with that needle until all the abscess is beyond the incision of the first needle, and strengthen the threads firmly in four places.</start_of_turn
And immediately dry the abscess in the middle of it until when it is finished there, then you incision the surplus of the cord, and leave that which is attached to it.</start_of_turn
And immediately stop over the powder which you have soaked in wine and oil, and immediately administer the care which is useful with cloths and by means of ointments until it is healed.</start_of_turn
Capital l of the abscess which happens for the twist of nerves.</start_of_turn
Just as it happens with an abscess in incision and in a vein, and in the same way that an abscess happens with nerves when it happens to them in their percussion or happens for excessive work, and for resemblance.</start_of_turn
And it is useful more of them in the places of the assistants or of the thigh, or in any place in which there are many joints.</start_of_turn
And the abscess is difficult, and is assembled like that of the other body, and is in the greatest of them when it is stretched violently, sitting in the midst of the disease resembling stupor.</start_of_turn
E no es apostema agreguat in the preon of the body, and for so is left the codena, and the same is maugut throughout and does not go to the preceding or following parts.
Therefore, that which is in the joints does not cover that it should be enclosed with iron, for that would strengthen too much.
May he who is in the head or in the front of the head burn the codena with a sponge. May he who is a little abscess, that you may then burn that which is of reason and separate that from the root
And if it is great, that you suspend it with one hand, and excoriate that, and then support that; and close the wound with sutures, and care for that until it is healed

In cutting an abscess that has happened from the heel that has happened to the belly
They are seen in the bellies of these men and in the other parts of the body of those who are afflicted with fungi, for they are similar to those that are in the fungi, from which the root is subtle and the head is great; and already the lips of these are spoken of, and it is of those that are little, and it is of those that are not magnificent.
And I have already seen one, and in the belly of it were two patients who were more like fungi resembling, and there was no difference between those that were white, of slight root
And already the lips of those were swollen and burst, and moisture ran from it all the time.
Therefore I infiltrated those and bathed one in the foot that was painful and the other that was painful in the foot
And the operation in the incision of them is that you consider if the disease is humid, and if the color of the ailment is white, humid, of subtle root; then you must burn with a sponge soaked in oil, and remain in your presence cautery in the fire, for the bubbles that are generated by the incision must be expelled without wound; and if you see that it is wound, burn that.
And if sometimes the disease is slight and fearful, guard you from the incision with iron; however, the hour takes faith in recent fat, and strengthen that ailment, which is that which we have mentioned; and read that for two days
And then adjust in the stricture of the thread of fat; therefore, do not stop strengthening the fat greatly until it is abscised and falls off by itself
However, if it is of great root, the hour in the incision of it is some cause of fear and fear, especially in that which is in the belly
Possibly you will need to cut off the greater part of it, and then burn that so that it does not return
And then care for that until the wound is healed
And remember that you must not presume to cut that which is of yellow color, of little sensation, of little regard, for that which is abscess is rotten flesh.
And I remember that this is recalled to me nearby

On the care of the umbilical cord.
The umbilical cord is useful for many causes; or for fissures of the sac that is over the belly, and these must be covered with the cloth or bubble as in other ruptures; or for healing which flows from a vein or artery as is said above, or for wind that is obstructed in it
However, if it is for a fissure of the sac and for the swelling of the cloth, the hour the color of the abscess is similar to the color of the flesh; and it is lion because of the pain, and it appears in various positions And if it is for the emission of the bubble, the hour its situation is that which we have recounted, of much greater diversity, and as you promised that which is said to be hidden inside, and return it; and it is strong in it so, and it is magnificent without causing great damage or violent work
However, if for moisture, the hour is lion and is not hidden when you put your hand on it, nor is it constricted, nor is it twisted
And if it is for healing, the hour at this sign appears the abscess turning black.
However, if it is for nothing, the hour is a difficult abscess, great and hard, and is fixed according to a quantity
May it be for madness, but the time has come to touch them.
And the operation in this case is that you must consider the time if the imminent danger of the navel is for the sake of surgery, or of a vein, or for madness; for in that case you must be prohibited from the treatment of it, because of fear and anxiety just as I have taught you in the chapter where I mentioned the apostemas for surgery and for vein.
And if the imminent danger of the navel is for the intestine or for the hernia, you must command the patient to lie still, and to be extended; and then I will attempt to draw out the intestines from the navel around the entire circumference; and command him to be placed between your hands over his genitals, and I will surround the area around the navel with a large swab; and extend the edge of the incision to the margins above a great extent; and tie firmly or loosely with sutures or ligatures of silk or linen.
And I will bring together the edge of the incision extended over the ligament and introduce the thumb of my hand into that place and I will push out the intestine; and if you have not grasped or retained it for the ligament, I will extract it with forceps and push out the intestine to the parts below the abdomen
And if you have found the hernia, I will take hold of it with one hand; and I will cut away the surplus of it.
May it be contrary to your surgery or vein, I will circle around that area, and then return to your operation; take two needles and pierce through those two holes firmly and enter two needles into the circumference which you have made around the incision in the manner of a cross, which will pierce through; and then strengthen the incision in four parts over the needles.
And if you wish, leave the needles in and let the extended skin fall down by itself; or cut away that when it is subtle and falls down, and I will care for that which covers the intestines until it is healed
And if the imminent danger of the navel is from nothing in it or for moisture, you must close the incision just as we have said and evacuate the moisture which you find in it, and care for that which covers and consolidates the area

Of the care of wounds.</start_of_turn>
We have already said, in the division, of the different types of wounds and how to treat them with medicines; and it is foolish to treat them with iron so that they are not ulcerated; and we have said that wounds are generated in the spring and the caution in the treatment of them
And I say that many wounds that are seen in the groin are in places where it is impossible to eradicate them, just as well as wounds that are in the breasts or in the buttocks and to whom it is appropriate to allocate all those that are away from the limbs to extract all of them, and more especially when they are starting small
When it is old and is thick, do not think that you will be able to heal it; for I have never seen that it is healed by any plaster or other thing, nor that it is healed by any other means.
And the operation in this case is when it is allocated as we have said, that you precede and remove the patient and purge with black bile some herbs, and I will sprinkle that, if it is found, and replace it openly
And I will prepare the patient with the preparation in which he is located in the operation, and I will order in the incision a number of pins which will cover that; and I will compress from all parts with the codena so good pressure that no cause of the causes of the wound remains. And leave run the wound, and do not close it hastily, and press the edges, and dry the wound thoroughly with your hand or with an instrument that is at your disposal of instruments
May it be contrary to your will of great surgery or of vein, I will cauterize that as soon as the flow of the wound is stopped, and I will care for that which remains of the other treatment until it is healed

Of the care of hydropic tumors.</start_of_turn
We have already recommended, in the division, the species of hydropic tumors of water, and their signs, and how to treat them with medicines
And that which is cured with iron is only the species of althites alone, and it is not approached with iron to the species of tympanists or to the species of yposarcha, which is deadly
When you have already treated this kind of tympanitic hydropath by medicine and have not relieved the pain, then know that if the patient has already achieved convalescence or another disease is present, just as in them or in the chest and resembling these, then do not administer iron, for fear of that.
If the patient sometimes suffers from excessive vomiting, and it is not another disease but merely hydropath, neither young nor old, then know that the method of operating for this is to elevate the patient's belly with your hand, express the contents of the belly into the pan, fill the cavity with water up to the level of the fifth rib, and then take sponges as follows:
... of two sharp points long, like sponges; however, make them somewhat smaller in each part, so that in the process of operation nothing enters the intestine, and that you avoid that.
And consider if the generation of hydropath is from the bowels, for in this case you must make an incision from the navel to the extent of three fingers below the ribs, on the side towards the fifth rib.
If the generation of hydropath is from kidney disease, then make the incision to the left of the navel for three fingers
If the generation is from the spleen, then make the incision in the flank
And do not make the incision over the ribs where the patient is vomiting, for fear of damaging the surrounding organs
And pierce with all the instruments. Enter into the incision and elevate your hand with the sponges between the cord and the liver, and extract it; if there is the quantity of a nail or more.
And pierce the liver until the sponges reach the cavity of the water And remove it and insert an instrument that has this shape: ... it is like a silver needle with a small hole at the lower end, and three holes on the sides: two on one side and one on the other; and the extremity is blunt like a pen, as sometimes happens
And at the end of the extremity there is an arm, which when the instrument comes into the water, immediately releases so much water that if you evacuate less than that in an hour, it is more harmful to the patient for the resolution of the spirit animal, or for injuries to the fifth pair of ribs, which is very close to death
Evacuate in this way according to the quantity of the vomit and according to what your experience tells you about the patient's vomit and the extent of his illness.
And remove the instrument. Keep the water that causes this because it is retained by the cord that retains the hole that is on the liver, and recommend that you perform this in the same way
And repeat the process the next day if sometimes the patient tolerates it, and extract only a small quantity of water, and do this for several days out of fear, and keep watch that there remains no water left except a little.
If you fear about the patient, and see a great quantity of water, then care for that which is buried in fine sand, moisten his clothes in bath, and wait in the sun for a long time; and care for that which has dry medicines until it is healed
And cauterize the stomach, the liver and the spleen during the evacuation of the water, as I have recounted in what precedes.
The treatment ends here.</start_of_turn>
Concerning the care of children who have not yet opened their bladders.</start_of_turn>
Some of the children excrete through the belly of their mother and the head of their urine is not perforated (or is slightly torn or is not in its place).</start_of_turn
Therefore it is necessary to cut as little as possible and as gently as possible, according to this method:</start_of_turn
And immediately stop the bleeding with a plum nail and ligate it, and keep it for three days or for three quarters of a day.</start_of_turn
When he wants to urinate, he will be able to urinate; and immediately return that.</start_of_turn
And if you do not stop the nail, it is possible that the urine that has gone over the place will not leave this opening.</start_of_turn
The suffering from which he complains is severe, both from the physician's point of view and from that of the layman. It is customary for us to call it "gout" when the pain arises from cold humors which penetrate all parts of the body, and when it affects the feet. If it is necessary to make incisions on the surface of the foot, let this be done with a pointed cautery. Reduce the swelling or tumor to its concavity, and keep your hand over the place to prevent the tumor from coming out. You have already opened the space between the patient's thighs, placed a cushion under them, another servant on their legs, and another on their chest, holding their hands. The cause of this patient's suffering is that the stone which is causing the pain is straight and requires treatment with a plum stone, as we have already said, for in a few days it will be amplified.
The stone which is causing the pain is not in its proper place, that is to say, the cause of this is that the stone, which is natural, cannot pass through the urinary tract because of the swelling of the bladder, until it is elevated by the hand to the parts below; and this is not due to its origin, for so the sperm cannot reach its height following the rule, and this is an illness of the bladder itself.
And the manner of performing the operation is that the patient should be placed on his side, and extend the head of the bladder with your left hand with violent extraction, and puncture the head of the bladder at the place of the periformis with a pointed instrument, as with a needle, or that you make no incision, for so that the membrane of the bladder returns to its normal position and the stone falls into the proper place as it should.
And remember that in your surgery of flux of urine, that no other matter happens; and pause for a while until the urine has stopped flowing, and care for the wound until it has healed.
Chapter 65.
Of the swelling which occurs in the prepuce in the head of the bladder and of the corruption and blackness and adhesion of the prepuce to the head of the bladder.
These matters are observed to cause this swelling in the bladder and is an ailment of the bladder itself
And of those two, one is malignant and the other is not malignant
Not malignant, because you suspend it with one finger and drain it when it is soft; and you pause over that area submerged in Egyptian unguent; and do the same with the other, care for it until it is healed
And if the swelling is malignant, of dark color, then you must administer cautery nearby the incision and in proportion to the severity of the ailment
Moreover, if the swelling is in the prepuce of the head of the bladder and is not circumcised, and one part of the swelling is inside the prepuce and the other part is outside, then you must know that the swelling which is inside must be treated before it is solidified; and as for the other, care for that which is outside, for when you care for that which is inside, you are not sure that the prepuce is not torn
And already there are seen to occur swellings in the genitals and in the prepuce, blackness and corruption, where you must conquer all that is already decayed and which is about to corrupt or which is already corrupted; and for this you must apply pressure over that area with a mixture of lead and flour of a thousand grains and of coarse chaff and millet.
And care for the other with the other care until it is healed
Moreover, if there is a flow of urine, then administer lunar cautery in this way:
Because the healing cautery is at two positions together, that is to say, for the flow of urine and for the wound when it is corrupted
And if the head of the bladder is corroded and is destroyed in an hour, then you must introduce into the body of the prepuce a a plum catheter so that the patient can urinate through that
In the adhesion of the prepuce to the head of the bladder (and this adhesion does not occur except in that of which the prepuce is soft, and over which circumcision is not required; and when it occurs from ulcer or from swelling) you must scrape with a blunt instrument until the ligament is dissolved and the head of the bladder is freed in its entirety
And if it is difficult to remove them, you must scrape with a blunt instrument over the whole of the head of the bladder and the prepuce, and thus when the prepuce is soft, strong as it is, it is perforated by its softness.
And keep the prepuce separate from the head of the bladder with a thread of silk, which already lies wet in the running water so that it does not adhere to anything else
And care for it with vinegar until it is solidified<end_turn>

Of the circumcision of children and the care of what occurs in those who have undergone circumcision.<end_turn
Circumcision is not merely a solution for continuity in this way as with other plagues: more importantly, as with our operation and our will, it is necessary that we assign in this better operation and way more weight lest we lose health.
Therefore I say that the ancients did not say circumcision in any of their leisure times, for they did not use it in their laws, and it is only because we have learned through experience that it causes more harm than good that they now resort to circumcision and mutilation for boys; and they do so with thread that is strong and with an incision at the nail.</end_of_turn>
And I myself have tried all these methods, and I do not approve of any mutilation with forceps, thread that is strong, or with an incision at the nail; for these methods often cause the codeon to flee further, since the codeon of the prepuce is split into two tunics, and the tension is left behind, and it is very strong. And as for the digital mutilation which is useful for alphbetism, and which is practiced by barbers, it is not followed by the incision of the extremity of the viril member, for it is very painful there.</end_of_turn>
More in the operation with the nail, one must observe great care and corrupt your operation.</end_of_turn> And the codeon of the child is short by nature, and often these veins are not harmed in this way that necessitates mutilation, and I have seen this myself.</end_of_turn>
More of the mutilation that is done with forceps and strong thread, experience teaches me that the pain, when it is excessive, both that which comes from the incision and that which remains after, is just as great as before; and therefore when you promise your hand so that they are provided in two equal parts, and you make the incision according to a comparison at a certain time, it is useful to compress the thread with a figure that contains the codeon of the radix of the whole part, so that there is no error in this.</end_of_turn
The first way of operating is that you must keep the child quiet if he is young, and do not do anything but tightly bind the thread to his radix only, and that you watch over him until the next day.</end_of_turn>
And thus you will please that in every way that is possible to you that he receives his intelligence.</end_of_turn> And thus you will please that your hands should be poised prepared, and do not be absent-minded; and conceal the forceps in your hand or hold them in your palm, so that the child does not see them or any other instruments.</end_of_turn
And thus place your hand on the radix of the member and blow into the codeon, and pull out that which is added to it by habit. And thus mutilate that which is added to it by habit.</end_of_turn
The way of the forceps for mutilation, this is the way:
The outer handles should not be too wide and the inner handles should be as wide as the thumb and index finger together.
More of an error in mutilation is that it causes the intrinsic codeon to flee completely, or parts of it must be excised from the incision.</end_of_turn>
Therefore you must extend that of your hour with your nail before the apostemaction of the place and that you make the incision according to equality.</end_of_turn
And if you cannot hold it with your nail, the hours extract that with a forceps and make the incision.</end_of_turn>
More if three days have passed and the swelling of the radix remains left after the removal of the caut, the hours read that it is conceded that the swelling has gone away, and remove that which is necessary, and make the incision as you are prepared.</end_of_turn
And take care of the head of the radix, so that it does not suffer from it.</end_of_turn
Therefore treat that which combines with the swelling of the boils which we have recommended in the treatise on boils.
If it is indicated on measurement, and you obey the parts mentioned, then do not neglect them.</end_of_turn>
And stay away from that which we have already said is healthy.</end_of_turn>

On the treatment of retained urine in the bladder.</end_of_turn
Retained urine in the bladder is caused by excessive fullness from stones or sand, or by weakness or spasm, or by poverty or meat, and it is to be treated in the same way as those which we have mentioned in the division.</end_of_turn
And if it is not dissolved as we have said, and the cause of the pain is not known, then you must administer extraction with an instrument called a siringua, which is made like this: of silver or gold, with a tube like a needle with a long handle like a palm, to which is attached a balloon-like bag at the tip.</end_of_turn
And the manner of extracting the urine is as follows: grasp the loop of the cord doubled and bind it at the base of the bladder with a good knot; insert the loops of the cord through the opening of the catheter, and pierce the edges if there is any cause of swelling, but do not insert the needle into the bladder with force. And then increase the catheter with a border and an egg-shaped bag.</end_of_turn
And make the patient sit on the edge of the bed, and bandage the bladder and the surrounding area with oil and olive oil, and oil of olive and vinegar.</end_of_turn
And then insert the catheter easily until it reaches the root of the bladder; then bend the bladder downwards to the part below the navel; and then grasp the catheter with your fingers; and grasp the catheter again when it reaches the bladder, and that will cause the patient to urinate; and this is not good in this order, but it is good in the part where the pain comes from.</end_of_turn
And gradually pull out the cord with the thread, so that the urine fills the bladder.</end_of_turn
And extract that and treat the urine, and use a catheter, do not stop until the bladder is empty and the pain is relieved.</end_of_turn
Chapter 59.</end_of_turn
Of the quality of the bladder wash with a clamp and the instruments which are suitable for it.</end_of_turn
When there is an ulcer or abscess in the bladder, or if it is constipated by urine, or if there is a coarseness of the bladder wall, and if you wish to drain urine and medicines, then it is necessary to use a clamp. This is how it is made:
Except that in the extraction it is deaf, so it is closed.</end_of_turn And there are three parts to it: two of the one side, thus twice.</end_of_turn
At the beginning it is liquid, in which is the thing which is enclosed, and as much as it fills that, so it is added, until when any cause is overcome by that which is drawn out of the humidity, that is thrown away, and when it is expelled, that is thrown away, and when it is expelled long, according to how much the clamp has held naptha in the battles of the sea.</end_of_turn
Therefore when you wish to remove humidity from the bladder, insert the extremity of the clamp into the humidity, and draw out that urine which is enclosed in the parts above, because the humidity is expelled in the concavity of the clamp.</end_of_turn
And then insert the extremity of the clamp into the bladder according to what we have recommended in the catheter; and then grasp the humidity with that urine which grasps, because that humidity goes to the bladder as much as possible, and the pain is relieved thereby.</end_of_turn
Form of the crystalline substance which is crystallized in the bladder, and that is the form:
And that is either silver or lead, of which the head is neither more nor less like a small feather, and leave it hanging limp.
And immediately take the bladder from its motion, and stop when the humidity you want to crystallize in the bladder is at hand, and then bind that between two strong ligatures made of strong thread, and scald that humidity over the fire
And immediately put the extremity of the crystal into the vinegar.
And immediately put your hand over the bladder with the humidity as it is stretched out so that the patient does not feel that the humidity has already reached the bladder
Even if the bladder is not present, when you take a piece of barley and make a circle of it; and pierce that through all its roundness; and immediately insert strong thread firmly into those holes, even though they may be twisted; and immediately gather the circle as if it were gathered to the bath, because you have placed your hand over that water which you want to expel from the humidity, and smell and water
And immediately tie that on the instrument and do as you did with the bladder, and express with your hand until the humidity has reached the bladder.

From the extraction of the stone.
We have already said in the division the species of stones and their cure with medicines, and the difference between the stone engendered in the phlegm and the stone engendered in the bladder, and we will tell you of that.
And we have said the stone in which catz operation is made with the hand, and section
And the stone engendered in the bladder itself is that which is fixed in the bladder.
And thus we have narrated this exposure and summary
Therefore I say that the stone most commonly seen in children; and of its signs is that the urine which comes out of the bladder is similar to water in its thinness, and appears in that sand; and the patient has frequent pain in his belly, and large and soft masses appear, and it is dressed; and in that water lies the root of the stone among those masses.
And it is strange the healing of children from that until they have reached the age of thirteen; and it is difficult to cure them in the old ones For in the young it is easier because it is among those things.
And concerning that from which the stone is greater and the cure is easier; and if it is little, it is contrary to that
Therefore when we come to the cure of that, cover at the beginning of that which modifies the patient's pain by means of the crystallization which extracts all the wound which is in the marrow; for that wound many soft masses prevent the poisoning of the stone because of the inquiry of those things
And immediately make the patient sit with both feet on the ground and with both hands raised up so that the stone may descend to the bottom of the bladder, or that it may jump out of its place by some soft masses.
And immediately do that which will break between your thighs prepared, and the greater part of them leave the cushions of their thighs, so that the whole bladder will be made to lie down declining to the parts behind
And immediately request that and all that is around it
Therefore if you feel the stone in the space, then immediately cover both hands over it with a section.
And if you do not feel it at all, leave it touching only with your thumb, if the patient is a child, or say half if it is an adult, and put that on the buttock And request the stone until it is left touching your thumb And convert that little by little into the mouth of the bladder
And immediately put your hand over that which you touch, and expel that to the outside of the body where you saw the section
Command the minister to hold the bladder with his hand; and command another minister with his right hand to extend the thighs to the sides, and with his left hand to hold the fold which is left by the thighs, at the part where the section was made
And immediately insert the sponge be incidental of which this is the form: And split it open in that place where it is between the hip and the groin, not in the middle of the thigh, toward the outer side of the left thigh; and let the incision be over that bone and the testicle which is said to be in the hip, and make a transverse incision, for the incision outside must be wide enough and not too narrow according to the amount that comes out of the bone, and not more, than which would firmly compress the testicle which is in the hip where the bone was cut.
And know that from the bone there is some angle and margin, for that its essence is difficult to cut for that reason.
And from that which is like a claw, it is round, and it is difficult to cut because of its smoothness
Therefore if that which has angles and margins fits into the fracture
And if it is not thus firmly held, that you must keep your hand over that, or that you must tightly bind that with your hand which is over the bone, and do not neglect that; or that you must put inside the instruments that curve the extremity.
Or if you cannot do that, then you must slightly enlarge the wound, and if you see flow of pus, cut away that which is yellow and slimy
Or if the bone is more than one, then at the beginning you must place your hand at the mouth of the bladder, and then you must cut over that; and then you must place a little sponge there; and in the same way do if there are two bones more
And if the bone is great, it is known that you must not make a great incision, because that would cause harm to the patient by causing two evils: either that it would remain or that it would cause continuous discharge of urine, because the limb is not completely consolidated
And administer the expulsion from within that it is evacuated, or engineer in the fracture of the bone with the forceps until you extract that in pieces.
Therefore when you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with aloe leaves and dragon's blood, and bind that tightly And keep over that bandage soaked in oil and vinegar, or in oiled rose oil and fresh water, so that the afterburn is softened.
And let the patient rest on the seat of the couch, and do not remove the bandage until the third day.
And when that has been removed, bathe the limb with water and oil, and then care for that with ointment of diafinicon and diabezicon until it is healed
Or if in the wound there is afterburn, adhere and corrode, and that which resembles that as if the urine is frozen in the bladder, and for that the urine is prohibited (and that is known as the evacuation of the urine along with the semen), therefore remove the testicle which is in the wound and extract that semen, because if it remains it will cause the bladder to become corrupted and putrefy
And finally wash the wound with wine vinegar, water and salt, and against all spices, against all that may impede its healing until it is healed
And keep in the hours of all the care that you lie both thighs together and adjust the medicines that are placed over the limb.
And if the bone is small and is in the marrow, and is fixed there, and the discharge of urine is prohibited, then know that you must cure that as it is recommended above that for this care, because those who do not take care of this will be accused of cutting; and indeed I have seen that for this reason they bring a needle of iron to the point.
Of triangular shape, extracted from the gut, fixed in the flesh
And take care that the gut does not slip back, and keep that part of the marrow outside the bladder so that it does not return to the bladder again.
And finally remove the iron from the marrow, perforating easily until the perforator comes to that bone. And rotate the perforator with your hand over that small bone, and you will pierce the perforation of it until you have pierced that of the other side so that the urine can flow freely
And put your hand over that which remains of the bone from the part of the marrow, which is broken, and is filled with urine, and the patient is healed
Or if this care is not pleasing to you for any cause that prohibits it, then know that you must tie a thread around the bone and another thread outside the bone. And then ignite over the stone in that furrow between two bands. And then extract that.</start_of_turn> And then remove the ligament and support the wound with a bandage, which is useful in the plague.</start_of_turn
And it is not necessary to ligate the tendon, but rather because it does not return to the bladder, and the other tendon must be detached, for when the tendon is detached near the expulsion of the stone, the codena returns to its place and heals the plague.</start_of_turn
And for this reason when you detach the tendon, that you elevate the codena towards its source, or that it returns backwards towards the belly, and heal the plague in this way.</start_of_turn

On the extraction of a stone from the thighs.</start_of_turn
A stone in the thighs is rarely generated.</start_of_turn
However, if it is seen that there is a stone in any of these, the healing of which is difficult, and is prohibited by rough methods.</start_of_turn
One of them is that the strong thigh is verges.</start_of_turn
And the other is that you do not find the thigh to be sound if you thrust your finger into it when it is cold, or if it is the thigh having marrow.</start_of_turn
The third is that you do not find the thigh to be aware of this art, mainly the operation with the hand.</start_of_turn
The fourth is that the location of the incision concerning the stone in the thighs is far from the location of the stone, for it is dangerous to make an incision in vain, and in that there is fear.</start_of_turn
However, if it is necessary to provoke this, the hour cover that you grasp a large thigh that is sound, and little is found.</start_of_turn
If you lack these, near the matrix cast or present a matron thigh that is softened in the field, or a thigh that in this art has become detached from the bone.</start_of_turn
Therefore do that which is presented, and command her to do everything that you order her, from the inquiry about the stone from the beginning; for it regards whether the thigh is verges, the hour cover that you put all that you said at the end of her and wants the stone.</start_of_turn
Therefore if you find that, cover that and the hour command her to make an incision over that.</start_of_turn
If it is not verges, the hour commands the matron to interpose all that you said in the belly of the patient and grasp over the stone, since it pauses her left hand over the bladder, and press that with good pressure.</start_of_turn
Therefore if you find that, the hour cover that gradually move that from the orifice of the bladder towards the lower parts until it reaches the level of the cushion.</start_of_turn
And then make an incision over that support of the belly that is at the level of the cushion of whatever part it may be that is stopped and center the stone in that part, and do not move the hand of the patient with the stone together with her.</start_of_turn
And the incision is little at the beginning; and then interpose the sponge over that incision, and if you feel the stone, the hour adjusts in the incision according to the quantity that you know that the stone will be ejected from that.</start_of_turn
And you know that the species of stones are diverse: because some are little and great, and lion and rough, and long and round, and have ramps.</start_of_turn
Therefore you know how many species there are of them for which you sign concerning what you want.</start_of_turn
And if you see flow of blood, adjust in the old wound three fingers and stay there for an hour until the blood is clotted, and then return to your operation until the stone is ejected.</start_of_turn
And make that you have ready all the instruments that are said in the extraction of stones in women, so that you are helped with them in your operation.</start_of_turn
And if you see flow of blood, and you know that the expulsion of the blood is from the vein that is cut, the hour you suspend powder over the area and open that with powder and stricture descending, and do not do anything further; and leave the stone and do not extract it, for it may cause the death of the patient.</start_of_turn And promptly treat the wound.
So when the acute pain has subsided a little, the limb should be returned to its normal position, and the doctor returns to his work before the stone has been expelled.</end_of_turn>

Of the incision concerning an hernia.</end_of_turn
A hernia is simply an accumulation of moisture in the white sac which contains the intestines, and is called a hernia.</end_of_turn
And every woman has in her own belly what nature has prepared for her in the part of the intestines, except that which has already gone; and this is the codena of the genetius between the white sac which we have already mentioned, and it is not simply water.</end_of_turn
And the generation of this hernia is because of excessive pressure which happens to the genetius, because of which this matter is infiltrated there; and sometimes it happens by a violent blow inflicted on the genetius.</end_of_turn
And this moisture has various colors, for its color may be yellow or greenish or bloody, or even black fetid, or white liquid, and this is the best.</end_of_turn
And the signs by which this accumulation of water is recognized are these: for if it is in the white sac which we have mentioned, when it is expelled it appears redon declining a little in length like a figure of water, and the genetius appears, for the moisture contains all around.</end_of_turn
And if the moisture is in the belly, when it is expelled it appears redon towards the part of the intestines and thus we believe that it is another hernia.</end_of_turn
And if the moisture is between the genetius and the white sac, then leave it alone.</end_of_turn
And when you wish to know the color of the moisture, then express the color of the moisture from the expulsion along with the drops that precede it; and according to what comes out with the drops, judge of what is its origin.</end_of_turn
Therefore when we come to the treatment of this we must command the patient to be flexible if possible, and sometimes to lie down.</end_of_turn
And immediately put two cushions under the hips on any occasion, and hold still for a while.</end_of_turn
And immediately place your hand on the left side of the patient, and command the assistant to follow on the right side of the patient, who will extend his hand from the hip bone to the groin and to the part below the navel.</end_of_turn
And immediately take hold of the patient's hand and make an incision from the hip bone to the middle of the foot along the length of the thigh.</end_of_turn
And the incision should be made according to the rule at an equal distance from the line which should join the skin of the genetius, until it reaches the white sac including.</end_of_turn
And drain away that, and observe, and take care so that you do not break that; and your incision should be made with such care that it be suspended with the greater vessels and be written smoothly along the incision according to your ability.</end>
And immediately pierce the full belly with a wide perforation, and extract all the water.</end_of_turn
And immediately separate between two layers of the incision with scissors, and stretch the sac downwards; and do not touch the genetius bone including, and pierce the sac in such a manner as you are able.</end_of_turn And pierce it entirely or in pieces, and more especially the flanks which if you do not carefully scrutinize the incision of these, it will not be safe that the water does not return.</end_of_turn
More than if the water comes out from its belly in the hour of your operation, when you have completed the incision of the sac, return that which has come out, and immediately suture the two layers of the genetius skin with sutures, and take care of this as well as the others.</end_of_turn
And if you find the water corrupted by another disease, then cover that you close the blood vessels which are sore the hangers, and extract the water, and take care of this as we have said.</end_of_turn
More than if the water is accumulated in two parts, it is known that these are hernias; therefore pierce that part as you have done with the other equally; and if it is your opinion that this is an operation, then do it.</end_of_turn
E aprop tu abstergiys le sanc, e entramet en las seccions lana submersa in olio o in olio rozat; e pausa deforo autra lana la qual tu as submersa in vi e olio, e expandeys aquela sobre dos genetius et li mirac del ventre; e pausa desobre draps doblatz et pulvils, et lia aquels desobre am liament le qual es segon ista forma:
Then withdraw the bladder or hernia back into its cavity, and place your hand over the area to prevent the bladder from bursting. And take two sheets and fold them with the coarse side inwards, and put the extremities over the parts which are painful or swollen with fat or moisture. And join the edges together with a suture in such a way:
And every wound of this hernia is treated artificially with cautery in place of incision with a knife; and that you take cautery of the pointed kind and insert it into that place where the cord of the thumbs is, and ignite it as we have recommended until the white sac containing the urine is discovered, and then you take the cautery in this way: and is assembled in Greek letters.
And then pierce that sac with that, and ignite it until all the moisture is driven out.
And then stretch out the sac with nails, and scrape with nails, and scrape with pointed cautery; and make an incision according to what is convenient until you have repaired everything; and keep your hand away from the fire.
And know that this operation is more saving and more lasting than an incision with a knife.
May it be contrary to your expectations that the after-effects of cautery should be delayed in the case of incision or at the time of cautery, or of flux of urine; however, you must know that you must care for whatever discomfort arises from this, with the care that is appropriate for it according to what is said.
May it be that the patient is poor, and does not expect a second operation because of its horror; however, you must administer perforation as we have recommended when it is certified that this is necessary; and it is confirmed that this is indeed the case, as we have said concerning the significance, that this hernia is harmless.
You must know that you must fasten the patient on any elevated surface, and perforate the after-effect in the lower part of it towards the heel, and stop the perforation according to the length of the body.
And the opening should be wide enough to allow all the urine to drain out
And then place your hand over the area around the hip and join it to that, so that no urine remains there And take care of it until the wound is healed
May it be that at the discharge of the urine in that hour you perforate that; and that which is not useful except that the white fluid in the opening of the wound makes it uncomfortable and prevents the passage of urine, you must know that you must put in the wound a little or an instrument with which the urine is extracted from the testicles, in the way that is preceded; or adjust in the oppression of the wound a small.
And know that the urine returns, and is restored about six months or in the spring of those; and when it is restored, the perforation should be made according to that same manner, so that the patient may pass the days without suffering

Of incision concerning carbuncular hernia and its treatment.</end_of_turn>
You must know that in the incision concerning this hernia there is great fear of loss of sensation in the major parts; for I have seen its dismissal and its being saved in that way.</end_of_turn
And I remember the operation concerning this and the species of after-effects.</end_of_turn
Therefore I say that the after-effects arise in the bodies of those in whom the thumbs are composed and are useful for many causes: or for sudden excess of liquid which is spread over the thumbs, or for percussion.</end_of_turn
The color of the after-effect is according to the color of the body, and it is not found in pain, and is a difficult after-effect.</end_of_turn
And it is known that the after-effect is bloody, of which the color is dark, and is not harmful to it.</end_of_turn
And some say that it is useful for the swelling of the arteries, and for the inflammation of those which have already been perceived, or for the inflammation of veins.</end_of_turn
The swelling of the joints is known as gout when it is caused by the discharge of purulent matter from the bladder when it is compressed in the abdomen. It should not be touched.
That which is caused by the swelling of the veins is not known to be dispersed in any way by the compression of these things.</end_of_turn>
And it is possible that the cutting of this kind will be useful on the other flesh; and that you should insert the codpiece into the genitals, and hold out the hair from the parts below, and extract that from the white sac, and discharge the lymph from the veins, and close them, and cut off the lymph that you discharge from all parts of the hair.</end_of_turn
Therefore if the blood is already clotted in those veins, then you must extract the blood and insert the codpiece.</end_of_turn>
And if there is adherence between any cause of the sac, or between those that are between the veins, then you must discharge all that adherence and insert that by incision around.</end_of_turn
And if it is born from flesh at the place of the adherence which is behind, then you must insert all that is of it, and extract the blood as we have said.</end_of_turn
Therefore when your operation is complete, then fill the wound with soft wool soaked in olive oil and vinegar; and take care of the other care of it until it is healed.</end_of_turn>

The wit is purulent enclosed by any covering resembling a sprout with mollification of the testicles, and it is difficult for the patient to exercise and walk about on the patient.</end_of_turn
And in the care of this disease it is to be feared from what precedes the memory.</end_of_turn
However we must say the operation in which the first things are fierce.</end_of_turn
I say that you must make the patient lie on a high cushion; and hold out the lymph from the testicles to the lower parts; and insert the codpiece into the genitals with the veins which are proven to the groin; and have those other attendants whom you please, and extend those with violent extension.</end_of_turn
And insert with a blunt knife quickly through an incision across the vessels until they are discovered.</end_of_turn
And extract from all parts as we have said previously in the extraction of the bladder which are in the temples.</end_of_turn
And leave in those one a needle which is faithful to the double, and tie one at the first place in the places where the wit happened, and tie the other thread at the back of them.</end_of_turn And insert those in the middle of the body for a transverse incision according to the length of the body, and extract what is added of the foul and corrupt humors.</end_of_turn
And take care of the wound with the care of the other wounds in which you wish to generate so that the veins which would otherwise be injured by two testicles do not suffer.</end_of_turn
However if the wit has happened to all the veins, then you must extract the testicles or that the testicles because of the veins will be emptied of all nourishment, and will be solidified, or that they will be so that they are not useful to those things.</end_of_turn

Of the care of intestinal hernia.</end_of_turn
The occurrence of this hernia is by section that extends over the abdomen from the flanks of the belly button, so that the intestines of that break are given to some of the intestines.</end_of_turn
And this rupture is either of the sac or of excess of it, and it happens for various causes: or for percussion, or for vomiting, or for crying, or for elevation of any serious cause, or for some other reason.</end_of_turn
And the sign of this, when it is for the extension of the sac, is that it happens gradually over a long time, and does not happen suddenly, and is purulent within the belly so that the sac compresses the intestine.</end_of_turn
And the sign of this is when it is for the section of the sac, that at the beginning it causes violent pain suddenly; and it is purulent outside the codpiece which is apparent, and that is for the bursting of the intestine, and the body of the hernia to the edges of the sac.</end_of_turn
Every wound outside the belly is forgotten about with the hernia of the intestines.
Every wound is forgotten with the swelling of the intestines, for some wounds go into the belly through an opening, and here it is retained, and this is great discomfort for the patient, and some wounds cause great pain, more when they are moved.
And in the treatment of this disease, fear is present, for it is believed that the infection may escape from the treatment in this way.
And the manner of performing the operation for this is that you command the patient to reduce the belly to their hand to the parts between the toes of their cavity if they obey your order, and then be covered over with a cloth between your hands, and elevate their legs.
And then clamp the cord which joins the testicles to the parts below, and cut the cord of the testicles throughout; and then quickly close the wound in two layers as you would to open the wound with these things
And if it is possible for you according to the quantity that you are able to do that from that will be forgotten
And then remove the clots which remain from cutting the cord of the testicles, until the white hard clot of some part is discovered.
Then you will enter the belly as it has been said concerning the testicles, that is between the white clots, which is left from the cord of the blood, and between the clots following, and remove that adhesion which is in the back of the blood
And then make the cord of the testicles limp by the hand, and with the left hand extend the white clot towards the hand, and elevate the blood towards the part of the wound; and command the minister to extend the blood outwards and you will dissolve the adhesion that is behind with the solution completed
And inquire of the patient that they do not suffer from any cause of the belly being covered with a white hard clot Maybe if you find any cause, then you will leave it in the belly
And then cut in the back of the cord of the testicles for the cutting of which has been recommended as we have said before.<end_turn>
And then administer lard submerged in oil, and leave it on the wound; and administer the thread which we have recommended (and some wounds the white clot is cauterized, which we have said above concerning the fear of the flow of blood, for many wounds happen in this way).
And if the case is delayed, the cold water should be bound, and leave it on that until it falls as we have said.
And then care for the wound with the other care of wounds until it is healed.

Of intestinal hernia.
In this hernia nothing is seen that has been done regarding its treatment with fear.
The first say that it is useful just as we have recommended in the hernia that is in the belly; that is that you tie the blood vessels near the incision in order to facilitate them; and then dry in the middle space around the feces so that the infection does not occur in that area until the blood vessels fall.
Care for the wound as we have said until it is healed
Chapter 67
Of the disruption that is useful in the groin
Some veins have burst in the groin area just as we have mentioned, and examine the area.
Do not suspect any cause of the swelling at the knee; and if you suspect anything, it is little; and return it to its place in a short time
Maybe if it is prolonged, the swelling will adjust within the thigh, and the swelling will disappear within the thigh; and this is what happens because the thigh is extended just as we have mentioned, which causes the thigh to be stretched, and therefore the swelling is softened and the area is relaxed and examined
The treatment is with a pointed cautery just as it precedes the narration.
Some veins are treated with iron according to this manner: the patient sits on a cushion between your thighs, and then dry the area of the burst veins by cutting around the circumference as much as three fingers wide
And then tighten the white thigh that is under the groin until it is revealed.
And then take the forceps and hold that above the prominent part of the thigh, and press that over the navel
And then compress the two prominent areas above the extremity of the thigh, and suture one to the other
And then extract the extremity of the thigh, and do not insert any part of the thigh, nor extend the limb, nor any other cause like I told you in the treatment of intestinal hernia
And then care for the wound as for wound care, and when you have inserted them, soften that and restore the wound until it is consolidated; for the thigh is contracted and the swelling is not adjusted
It is better to leave it closed in this area, for it is more likely to heal well

On the softening of the groin of the testicles.
Many veins in the groin of the testicles in old men are softened by this so that the tissues between them are softened, and it is feared for them
When it is necessary to treat this it must be done by seating the patient between the thighs and cutting through the entire groin which is softened, and then suture the two lips together
Or if you wish, you can also ligate the excessive swelling of the softened groin with three or four stitches and with a firm suture
And then insert between the sutures; and then care for the wound until it is healed and the wound comes away.
End of Document
Of castration
It is known that castration is forbidden in our law, however, I recall it from this book; and it is not necessary to recall it except for two cases, of which the first is when the physician is questioned about it, for he should know how to treat it, and the second case is when we must castrate other animals for our own young for those, as well as mares, dogs, pigs, and the like.
Therefore I say that castration is useful in two ways: either by traction or by incision to the root
As for traction, the way to perform the operation is to immerse the beast in cold water until the testicles are softened and limp and hanging down And then take hold of those with your hand until they are resolved and do not appear to touch anything
As for castration by incision and section, you must hold the beast and grasp the testicles with your left hand
And then ligate the surgeon, and make an incision over every vein with a cut that goes through two veins
And then cut through the rest of the cord that remains outside. Do not leave the wound open to any cause, but rather the soft swelling that is over the veins
This method of castration is better than traction, for traction often leaves any cause of the testicles causing the beast to desire to mate
And then care for the wound until it is healed

Hermaphroditism in men is in two ways: one is when it appears that there is space between the testicles, in which case there is a bulge like a female between the testicles.
And sometimes the urine is seen in the codena of the testicles
More commonly in women: for there is a kind of woman in whom the breast bone is like two testicles of a man, and a little smaller at the bottom than at the top like a man
And the treatment is of three kinds: two of the males and one of the females So that you put your hand over those which are pressed so that you may expel the mark of that, and do as you please in the treatment of the other ailments.
And in the second kind of males from which there is urine in the codena of the testicles, there is neither treatment nor operation for it
Chapter xxi.
Of laziness and of prominent flesh due to female causes.
Excess of laziness is adjusted for natural causes, which makes it legitimate and is recommended; and sometimes it is seen in many women that it is exaggerated as much as in men and even more during coitus
Therefore put your hand over the superfluous laziness or do it with a sponge.
Do not proceed rashly, mainly in the area of the genitals, so that you do not cause the flow of semen to cease
And do as you please in the treatment of the ailments that are healed
More flesh is born in the horror of the mother than in the abundance of the maiden, and excessive laziness is seen in the departure from the norm (and for this reason it is called the “disease of excess”). Therefore we must proceed in this way as we proceed with laziness, and we must cure that which is healed
Chapter lxxii
Of the treatment of carbuncle.
Carbuncle is that which does not pierce the flesh, or that has a small opening It is either natural or accidental
Accidental is for the disease which has preceded it, and that which is caused by no adjustment of the flesh or by fat or by a hard or soft swelling
It is found in the groin or in the breast, on the sides or on the belly or on the buttocks, and prevents any sexual intercourse, coitus or conception, and excessive laziness hinders the menses
And the knowledge of that is legitimate for the purpose of the examination, if the swelling is apparent, it is sufficient; even if it is not apparent, the hour you search for that which is in the belly or in the flanks is enough
Even if the swelling is for fat, and is at the two lips, the hour you touch and break that is enough
And put your hand over the two lips, and touch the flanks and the belly indicates that there are pus pockets in those places
And the woman should be placed over the two knees, the thighs stretched out, and then stretch out the two lips with force until that fatty swelling is broken and the swelling is opened
And take oil and pour it over the area and place your hand over it, and hold it for a moment so that the area does not harden
And if the swelling is large and soft, the hour you must put something soft over it, such as fat or a piece of myrtle leaf
And if the swelling is for meat, the hour you must do it with a sponge, and then puncture it
And with all the medicines which stop the flow of semen in general, such as acacia, and bloodroot, and henbane, adjusted with an egg white
And give a large needle of plum so that the wound does not become permanently solidified
Keep it for several days and give it lime juice
And so it should be treated with another care of consolidation until it is healed.
And thus various wounds arise at the greatest birth of other flesh, and it is necessary to cover them according to this manner.</end_of_turn> May be also for swelling of the head, but for swelling of the head which is in the greatest part not to be treated contrary to iron in any manner.</end_of_turn

Hemorrhoids are recognized from the orifices of blood vessels rather than from those which flow without interruption; and when they are ancient hemorrhoids and are made firm they heal themselves.</end_of_turn
And I have already said in the division the species of those and their signs, and I say that those which receive treatment and those which do not receive treatment.</end_of_turn
Therefore I say that hemorrhoids and tail when they are in the groin of the greatest and do not appear to the feeling, it is not necessary to treat them with iron.</end_of_turn
But those which are in the orifice of the greatest about which they feel sensation, those are to be treated.</end_of_turn
And so you must put the woman in great heat and then extend your thumb with the forceps, or with rough silk, and prick them with the roots.</end_of_turn
And so you must powder over those with the flow of blood from one of the veins incisions, thus as in the case of the wound and resembling those.</end_of_turn
And so keep the feet covered for an hour, and then stop that in cold water.</start_of_turn
And if the flow of blood persists, then make decoction of sumat and of the scales of millet and of gum and of appearance.</end_of_turn
And so take oatmeal and comfort it with honey and vinegar and make ointment with water over two of them.</start_of_turn
And if the blood is clotted, it is good; but if not, make adherence with two sponges, and to the nipples their scarification.</start_of_turn
And so take linen and soak it in the juice of colocynth or in the juice of arnica or in the juice of gentian with white wine and apply it to the place; and care for the place with ointment until it is healed.</start_of_turn

Of the perforation of an abscess that has happened in the groin.</start_of_turn
There are various species of abscesses that occur in the groin, such as carbuncle and abscess lapident, ulcerous and abcess of hubblets, ergot of mercury and fistula hemorrhoidal, ragus and tile and other abscesses.</start_of_turn And I have already said these diseases and their species and their signs, and their treatment in the division.</start_of_turn
And so I say in this treatise of the abscess which comes in the groin when it is of the abscesses which accompany healing, and if you wish to know how it is made with iron.</start_of_turn
Therefore you must consider if the pain of the abscess in the thigh at the beginning is acute with percussion and spasm and fever, and sometimes when it covers over that which gives sensation, that is to say, when it does not cause pain, do not hesitate with the perforation, but care for that which helps with the maturation until the acute of the accident has ceased.</start_of_turn
And so you must put the foot over a cushion which has two cushions; recline on the thigh two fingers and adjust the feet of the patient to the part below the belly, and the thighs wide, and hold the heels down, and tie whatever is convenient to it.</start_of_turn
And so the midwife follows behind the bladder and administer the instrument with which the orifice of the groin is opened, the shape of which will come in those causes which will make it necessary.</start_of_turn
E cove quan vols ministrar aquest instrument que tu fiques am lo ray le preon de la mayre de la femna, e aquo que del instrument es intrat en la mayre no sia mays que·l preon de la mayre e leda le malaute.

Cover the thread that runs along the instrument from its side and remove it from the instrument while holding it and rotate the thread until the hole of the thumb is opened
When the discharge appears, which is touched with the hand and is yellow and thick, then cover the top of it with a spatula of fat.
When the feces are evacuated, cover the wound with a soaked sponge in olive oil or in green oil in which there is any itching; and cover the heel in the hole of the thumb
Place the thumb and over the wound cover the area with a clean bandage soaked in water in which there are boiled mallows
And so treat for two days until today, when you should give it water until it is healed
Wash all the vegetables thoroughly and the thumb and the wound with water and vinegar, and then with water in which lilies or long-bodied herbs have been boiled, and finally return to the treatment.
If the wound is deep in the thumb, prohibit the healing of it with iron, and treat it with that which has been said in the division

To teach the midwives how these things should be practiced when using unnatural figures.
A necessary cause is that the midwife should know at the beginning the figure of natural childbirth well in order to recognize it from its signs, for when a woman gives birth and wants to smell the air and over this is done with violence, she disgusts the part with this, and it happens that for this reason the part is unnatural, and the sign of it is that it is above the navel, and the second is that it is related to that which is hanging or suspended from the navel.
Therefore, when you see these signs, cover the belly so that the embryo will slightly descend when it is about to come out on the navel, and that is enough to break down these superabundances with good monitoring
If another part is unnatural and useless, for when the embryo comes out on its feet and the body of the fetus comes out in front of the head and the feet of the fetus, and the hand or the heel of the fetus or is located on the head or the hand of the fetus, or at the belly of the fetus, and is greatly converted over the navel, and resembles the unnatural figures
A necessary cause is that the midwife is wise and skillful in all these matters, and that she avoids error and deception
And thus we have shown all the figures of these things, and what is their meaning in these things so that it is significant for what is done and what has been done
When the fetus comes out naturally on the navel and that is violent upon the woman, and that part is difficult, and sometimes the virtue of the woman is already exhausted, then do that which the women have, and vaporize the moisture from her with cinnamon and sweet oils.
And so mix the midwife between the thighs as little as possible and make an incision at that point, or cut that which is at the tip of her nails until it comes out what is in it of moisture Press the belly of the woman until it gives birth to the fetus.
If it does not come out, cover that the woman should be moistened with mucus of peas and mucus of cinnamon with rosemary.
And so command her, command her to be pressed, that she is compressed and that she should vomit; and cover her mouth and nose for an hour, for the fetus will be forgotten so much the better
And if the two most important parts of the fetus are forgotten at the beginning, then reduce them gradually. If it does not obey the treatment, then place the woman on a cushion and lift her legs up, and then press the cushion down on the earth; and the woman should be held so that she does not fall from the pressing
If the pulse is not restored and the foot is dead, then it is necessary to pierce that and extract the marrow from the bone or bind the limb to the hand of the patient and extract that as well, for in that way the hand and foot will be freed from their suffering.
When the foot swells over the ankles, then cover that with your thumb and index finger, and then make the foot smaller, and bring close the other fingers, and grasp a piece of it and gently stretch the little bones outwards.</end_of_turn>
When they are like this inside the thighs, then command them to express themselves, and make them vomit whatever is in their condition, for if God wills it they will be freed from their suffering.</end_of_turn>
And if it is not freed from this at all, then return the little foot gradually until you have reached the second natural figure, for in that way the hand and foot will be freed from their suffering.</end_of_turn>
And if all this has been forbidden, then take high musellage and dissolved gum, and pierce throughout the bone for good percussion, and press firmly with your hand on the area of the woman, the fluid from her belly.</end_of_turn Then do that in warm water, until you achieve calmness.
And when the parts have become soft, then apply fumigation with myrrh and stop that for them.</end_of_turn> And when an hour of fumigation has passed, then command them to sit on a cushion, and then make them vomit and open their mouth wide, take away that, and press on the lower part of their belly with slight pressure, for the foot will be freed from its suffering.</end_of_turn
From this moment on concerning the lateral swelling of the foot while one of their fingers remains bent.</end_of_turn Command them to lower their hand, even if you are unable to do so, and elevate the heel and let it go down.</end_of_turn
If it is not possible to lower it, command them to lie on their thighs, and with your hands bind the patient's limbs with violent pressure, and give them ligatures which you will recommend and medicines.</end_of_turn
And if it is urgent, command them to sit on a cushion, and then study the reduction of the hand, and gently make the foot according to its natural figure, and make them vomit and command them to press themselves until it is freed from its suffering.</end_of_turn
From this moment on concerning the swelling of the foot over the ankle, expand their fingers and the foot is at two o'clock of its greatest extent.</end_of_turn That the midwife has the hand of the foot and gradually rotates that little by little, and that will facilitate.</end_of_turn
And when it is equal, and when the hand has been placed over the area as we have recommended of oil and medicines, pause over the area of the patient's palm.</end_of_turn
And command them to gently move their hand little by little, and when you see that it has moved, command them to sit on a cushion and tilt their foot towards the outside, and command them to press; and make them vomit what is in their condition.</end> The fetus is prepared to come out through the wide opening.</end_turn>
When they are horrified of the great woman in this manner, consider, and when you see that the second finger has passed through the moisture, extract it from the humidity.</end_turn
If the patient's face and neck are swollen, then you should prick the embolus immediately, so that it is not retained and remains.
Then quickly pull out the swelling from the wound until you stop, and command the woman to compress her breasts with some compresses, and let the man forget for a moment about his pain, if God or no.</end_of_turn>

And concerning those who multiply, even if they are twins, a second one, and are separated by the navel, distinguish those within the ligament in the navel of each one of them. And every woman forgets those immediately as soon as she has conceived naturally, and so they remain unfruitful immediately as soon as we have recommended.</end_turn
And if they are difficult to bear, you must encourage them and persevere until we have mentioned the unnatural figures. Then you take care of them as we have recommended.</end_turn
And if the mistress is subtle and makes what is necessary easier and more subtle, and is patient, and is ingenious according to the figure as she is prepared for the threatening disease.
Remember that it is formed in the womb from embryos and is aborted.</end_turn
Some physicians verify that a woman should not conceive more than six times, and another ten times in total, for this causes pain in the measure of the learned doctors.</end_of_turn>
And all this is covered by the knowledge of the mistress that it is strong like that child, and therefore she should be nursed as she should be covered.</end_turn
Chapter 166.</end_turn>
Of the extraction of the fetus when it is dead.</end_turn
When you cure the dead fetus as we have said in the division of medicine and it is not outside, and you must certainly use an operation with care, since you must consider if the woman is of sound virtue and is not one of the accidents for which she is feared to lose her life.</end_turn
Then you must cover the woman over her belly with two sheets, and her head should be tilted towards the chest and her legs should be raised up.</end_turn
And the minister has two hands or is bound in the sheet so that the body does not extend beyond the extraction of the fetus.</end_turn
Then you should moisten the mouth of the woman with oil of olive and mucus of alum and fennel and coriander seeds.
And then the mistress should take her hand with those oils and mucus, and should intervene with her hand in the belly, and should hold her hand where the nails are in the fetus.</end_turn
And look well where you are: if you consider that the fetus is ready to come out head first, and when you hold the nails of the fetus in the heel, or in the head, or in the mouth, or in the palate, or leave the beard, or in the armpits of the fetus, or in the proper places of the ribs, or leave the hip bones.</end_turn
Or if the delivery is on the feet, then in the fifth or in the middle of the back.</end_turn
And that you have a nail in your left hand, and that you suspend the curvature of the limb in that place which is between the knuckles of your left hand, and intervene with your hand to facilitate and keep the nail in one of those places that we have mentioned, until you reach the cause of the pain.</end_turn
And then pause and stay in the position of the limb another nail, or the third if necessary, so that the attraction is equal, and is not only extension according to its rectitude.</end_turn
Thus be careful with all parts, so that the suffering of the limb is alleviated as soon as possible, just as it is done in the case of the extirpation of the fetus.</end_turn
And cover them with something that softens the extent; and if any part of them is retained, the hour covers that the midwife should apply an ointment of oil and mix with those that are expected and rotate with those that are retained.
If any part of the foot is extruded, the hour cuts through it so that it is exchanged between the one that is more forward; and do so until all the foot is extruded
If the limb is drawn outwards by the other, and it is not possible to reduce it by the force of the body, the hour covers that it should be bound up above that; and then extract that until all is extruded, and insert it into the wrist or the elbow.
And thus cover the other hand and both feet
If the head of the foot is large, or if there is a bruise on its covering, or if there is a tight water-bag, the hour covers that it should mix between these spines and open the head and extract the water, or that it should drain it with an instrument called “alundat”, which is like the other instruments in this chapter
And do the same if the foot is of great size by nature: and the hour covers that it should insert that sponge or that it should cover that sponge as we have said; and then extract the bones with forceps
And if the head is extruded and is closed, break the heel; the hour is that the humidity which is in the feet should be evacuated.
And if it is not complicated, or if it does not obey this order, the hour inserts the head as much as possible according to your skill.
And if there is swelling of the belly or if there is fluid in it, the hour covers that you should perforate that until the humidity which is in it is expelled
And if the foot is above the knees, the hour easily attracts it and directs it to the mouth of the hand is easy
And if it is closed, you must grasp the foot and the heel, the hour covers that you should extract that sponge which is bound up on your hand, and that you must open the belly and the heel until the water which is in them runs out.
And if the other limbs are relaxed and the head is returned, the hour mixes the left hand; but if the mouth of the hand is open, the hour inserts the hand into the armpit, and grasps the head, and pulls that which is said to the mouth of the hand, and then mix it with them one or two nails and pull them towards them
And if the mouth of the hand is closed by swelling caused by an ulcer, the hour covers that it should not be pressed over it; and the hour covers that it should administer an ointment of oily humors. And administer plasters; and follow the patient in warm waters that soften and moisten.<end_turn>
And if the foot is above the hip, the hour if possible is, to make an incision: and to administer what has been said about the foot alive.<end_turn
And if that is not possible, the hour must be pierced in small pieces, and must be extracted.<end_turn>
And cover that you do not leave any cause of pain from the second time<end_turn>
And when you have completed all your operation, the hour administers what has been said about the care in the ulcers which occur from the hand.<end_turn
And if there is discharge of pus, the hour departs in astringent waters and administers the other care.
And indeed I have seen a woman in the belly of whom there was a dead fetus, and upon that another fetus was taken away, and the other fetus was dead. It happens to me or to long time after delivery in the belly; and it inflates until it is broken by water, and begins to groan.<end_turn>
And I was called to take care of them, and I medicated them for a long time, and the plague was not consolidated.<end_turn
Then I left them for some strong plaster, and I extracted one bone, and I passed a day or two, and I extracted another bone; and I was amazed that in the belly there was no bone.
And then I thought that they were the bones of the dead fetus.<end_turn
Therefore I seize the plague, and extract from it the marrow of bones, the woman exists in the thousand milhs at our disposal, and I have seen in this way for a long time, corrected by it a little of bravery.
And I do not hesitate to say that in this case there is knowledge and aid for the physician to make an artifice with the hand for the administration of treatment
Concerning the forms of the instruments that are necessary to extract it
Form of seeing in which the greater part is opened:
This is the form of strength in which the guts are grasped, to which two vertiges are attached at the two extremities of two feet May, however, this vertige cover that it is more subtle of a strictor, and is made or of fat or of boys' testicles
And the width of each fist is as two fingers and the breadth of each thumb as one finger, and the length of each is one palm and a half; and in the middle place of two fists are two adjustments of that middle fist which have already been fixed, of which the length is half a palm and a little, and the width of each is like two fingers, or a little more
And these two additions are introduced into the mouth of the greater part so that it is opened with those two prescribed vertiges.
Another form similar to that which is more subtle and more light
Made from fat or testicles of boys according to the form of forceps But in the extremity of them are two additions like those sometimes, and the length of those additions is like a palm, and the width of each is two fingers
And when you want to open the greater part, then you make the woman lie down on the side of the thighs, open what is between the thighs of her. And bring your hand close to the instrument like a pair of forceps according to the quantity you wish of the opening of the mouth of the greater part until the metronome makes so that you can do it
The form of vertige which they say the ancients:
Form of pressing with which the bone is pressed:
Form of pressure with which the great head is contained
And it is assembled like forceps to which teeth are added at the extremity, like sometimes, and some veins are made like forceps according to this form, like sometimes, to which teeth are added like teeth of a saw to which incision is made and contained. Form of little pressure
Form of a single horn with a spine
Form of a single horn with two spines
Form of spatula having two extremities to which the head is severed
Form of two broad spatulas
All these instruments are exercises, and when they are multiplied with the species of that, and when they are prepared, you must order the artificer, because it is more curious about his operation and more must you order the men for their quantity.
And do not work with those instruments, whether you are going to or must do it, because the necessity of those is not excusable.
Of the extraction of the marrow.<end_turn>
When the marrow is retained you must support it, and order the patient to retain the heel, and bring that stone to vomit up with condiment, and strengthen your hand over the mouth and over the nails of her, and if by chance it escapes, well and good
Or, take hold of an instrument and pierce through the covering a hole and put on that herb which opens the mouth of the greater part, like camomile and rue and mint and saffron and chamomile and Arabic gum and mastic and rue de la cruz. All these herbs or some of them are submerged in water in the bowl, and keep that over the fire.
And bring close a catheter of gutta in the mouth of the greater part, and keep that inside until the vapor comes out to the cavity of the greater part
And thus do we make her vomit as we have said, and the second time she will be forced out with speed.
If it remains close to this treatment and is not expelled, then command the matron to submerge your left hand in olive oil or in milky almond, and mix some of that in the palm of your hand and over that in the groin, and when you have found the pain, then take hold of that and stretch it out slowly. If it is attached to the greater trochanter, then mix your hand as we have recommended, and when you have found the other, extract that little by little according to the rule so that the greater does not suffer excessive traction.</end_of_turn> Henceforward let the right and left thighs be interchanged with ease.</end_of_turn>
And if the mouth of the greater is closed, as we have already recommended, we will have said the treatment with vomiting and medication of oil with herbs.</end_of_turn
If it is not expelled by all the means we have recommended, then know that you must not be discouraged by the repetition of the extraction, for whatever comes out of it at the mouth of the greater lies in the cavity of the thigh, and mix that with unguent and tetrazepam; for that will cause it to soften and be expelled.</end_of_turn
When it is exhausted, it is of little use to raise foul odors to the head and stomach, for that brings on the illness; and therefore we must administer sub-fumiguous remedies and convenient means with oil.</end_of_turn
Indeed, among the Ancients, there is often a sub-fumigation of rue and dried figs.</end_of_turn
Such is the instrument with which the thigh is sub-fumigated because of the retention of menses and the second:
Either with a needle or an iron.</end_of_turn>
And let the limb be supported on the palm of the hand and the limb be placed on the heel, and let the sub-fumigation be performed over the sleeves of the fire.</end_of_turn
And keep doing that until the sub-fumigation has been consumed and is repeated again.</end_of_turn
As for the treatment of the buttocks of the unperforated child...</end_of_turn
The child cries and their buttocks are not perforated, which already irritate the limb and obstruct it.</end_of_turn Therefore command the matron to perforate as I have said; and if not, perforate with a sharp needle, and take care not to touch the nerve.</end_of_turn
Then place over that wound oil and vinegar; and take care that the wound enters until it is settled.</end_of_turn
If you fear that it is obstructed, then pause for a while in the wound a needle to expel for a few days, and keep it until the child is well.</end_of_turn
And indeed the obstruction of the buttocks may be for consolidation of pus or of haematoma; therefore let that consolidation be interrupted, and let it be cured with the remedies and methods that we have mentioned.</end_of_turn
On the treatment of fistulas that arise from the buttocks.</end_of_turn
The fistulas that arise in the lower part of the buttocks are nodular and large, which arise from the greater trochanter or in the space of the buttock.</end_of_turn
Whether it is a fistula or a collection of matter.</end_of_turn
When that nodule is old and softened by excessive humidity white or yellow pus, and some herbs penetrate these fistulas.</end_of_turn
And those penetrate are known for that which comes out of them by evacuation and by wind; and some physicians use the bad evacuation of the bowels, and more does it come out of them violently.</end_of_turn
And some of those penetrate enter the bladder, and enter the meat of the heel; and some penetrate into the joint of the thigh and enter the neck of the femur.</end_of_turn
And it is known that a penetrating fistula that enters the buttocks and not penetrating is that you must indicate to the patient that it is in the buttocks, and enter with an iron or needle into the fistula when it is soft and not painful.</end_of_turn
May it be known that when swelling occurs in that area due to a wound of plum or hair of a horse, and you feel the swelling or hair in the belly, that is a sign of the disease.
And if you do not perceive any wound or cause of discharge, fever, or wind, as we have said, then it is to be known that the swelling is not penetrating, and therefore you must take care of it.</end_of_turn>
When the fistula is penetrating, it enters the bladder or the meat of the heel. In this case, the meaning is that there is urine from that fistula, and prohibition of its discharge, so that the area may be solidified with medicine.</end_of_turn>
May it be known that when it penetrates the joint or bone and causes pain in the circuit, the sign of it is that the swelling has penetrated here if not because of a wound in the bone, and pain in the circuit of the limb; and that from this it is reduced in all its parts; and that it is of no use in this medicine, neither is it solidified at this time.</end_of_turn
In all such penetrating fistulas there is no cure for all, but the cure for these is the work and diligence of the physicians who must be held responsible for it.</end_of_turn>
But in that which is not penetrating and does not grow old, recovery is expected as I will tell you when I have learned and recommended it, and what I have already practiced.</end_of_turn
And that the patient lies between your thighs and raises the legs up to their shoulders, the thighs are inclined towards the belly of the patient, and you must enter with a plum, or hair if there is swelling in the fistula, until you feel the swelling has disappeared.</end_of_turn
And if the patient groans around the belly, then you must enter with the thumb of your hand at the belly.</end_of_turn>
And if the thumb has already penetrated without your perceiving it, or if you perceive between the thumb and the heel or the hip, it is certainly known that the swelling is penetrating; and in this case you must not work in this, for there is no cure in this, as we have said.</end_of_turn
However I say that in many cases it is well with some people.</end_of_turn>
And the medicine for which healing is expected from it is that you burn the pointed cautery subtly according to the extent of the fistula, as it has been said before, and introduce that fire into the fistula until it has disappeared from the belly; and then repeat that two or three times until you believe that all the swollen tissues which resemble plumes of owls have been softened.</end_of_turn
And then care for those which are wrapped in cloth until all the swollen parts have healed, and care for those medicines which generate and consolidate the flesh, and if it is healed, it is good; but if not, it is known that it will not be healed by any other treatment.</end_of_turn
And if the thumb enters but does not penetrate into the thumb which is at the heel, and between that and the thumb which is very sensitive to flesh or bone, and sometimes the fistula reaches the surface of the heel, it is known that the heel of the fistula must be cauterized from the beginning of the fistula, and that you must see the thumb dry, and that both the thumb and the fistula are freed from their attachments.</end_of_turn
And finally make smooth those swollen tissues which resemble feathers of owls and do not remain from any cause.</end_of_turn
However if there is flux of pus sometimes that comes between you and your operation when you have finished cauterizing those tissues, then it is better to burn with fire or acute medicine, because the burning with fire fits well in these good days: it is the closing of those swollen tissues and the excision of the excessive moisture.</end_of_turn
And care for those which are wrapped in cloth or in causes of distress until the limb gets better, and care that the hours care for the wound when the flesh is hard and durable that it generates and consolidates.</end_of_turn
And these medicines in which there is styptic action and excision; when the hour is restored it is already healed and you do not fear repetition.</end_of_turn
However if the fistula has already penetrated into the groin and is elongated from its surface of the body, then you must enter with the thumb into the groin and inquire about that.</end_of_turn
Therefore if you seize the thumb and between you and it is very sensitive to bone or flesh, and it seems likely to penetrate, it is not an operation in this case but according to a way of trust and hope.</end_of_turn
Which is to administer in this case one of three ways: either that you burn it as we have said; or that you drain it so that you can achieve the curvature of the foot so that you can easily enter with your fingers and the treatment will be more effective; and do not proceed with the incision unless you wish to cause damage to the surrounding skin, and take care of the patient immediately regarding the presence of the infection; or that you lengthen the swelling and remove that pus which you drained from the bottom of the heel, as we have said, or with another instrument of sharp extremity, and make smooth those swollen tissues which remain after the excision; and finally strive to restore the whole wound by means of the incision, and if the pus has not solidified in the meantime, and the fistula remains open in the heel, and if there is still pus in the wound, then there is still infection. The fistula is finished when you enter the needle into the fistula, at the base of the buttocks surrounding the area around the hip and the edge of the buttocks. Then take hold of the needle and perforate the extremity, as if you were preparing the area according to this method.
and you enter into that thick covering of fat or around those; and then enter the needle with the tip in the fistula until you achieve the concavity of the area.
Maybe if it is perforated in the margin of the buttocks, then you extract the thread from that hole as soon as you insert the needle there; and you extract the extremity of the thread and join the two extremities together, and then bind each one, and keep it so for a day or two, and when it has healed, open that again until those parts that are between the two extremities of the thread and that are causing the pain have healed.
And take care of the wound until it is consolidated and healed.
Maybe if the opening of the fistula is not perforated, then it is necessary to perforate it in some way, even if you have prepared it, for it is not your business to leave it unclosed, because that would cause damage; and then do so until it has healed
The shape of the spatum spine concerning which the fistula is made: the curvature of which is not acute and the other part is not blunt, so that you do not cause any damage which is not necessary, even as it is sometimes.
From suture of emorrhoids in which runs clean at the incision of those.
Emorrhoids are of two kinds, either those that remain between the buttocks like those of cartilage, or those that are like the seeds of grass And those are small and large, and that heal from those to these, and is one, and not many, and are outside the buttocks, and in the extremities of the buttocks.
However, those that are outside the buttocks are according to the months of little humidity, of which run citrine water or a little of salt with continuous application, and according to the color of the buttocks.
And the care of those that are inside the buttocks is that you command the patient to sit down and express until the swelling has gone down and the hemorrhoids appear to you Then you take hold of me and suspend me with one hand or that you have them with your nail, and then apply those with your nails.
Maybe if their nails are not kept in those for the humidity of their nails and their softening, then take hold of those with a rough or coarse or slippery hand, and extract those with the tip of the needle, and then insert those into the buttock, and sprinkle over them some fine powder nearby the incision, so that it adheres to those instead of causing them to fall out; or cauterize those as it is foreseen in the chapter on cautery And take care of those with the other care until they are healed.
And if the buttocks do not obey to defecation, then you bite the patient on the cheek with a slight bite, and wash with that water which is in the buttock and which obediently obeys defecation when the patient defecates.
However, if the hemorrhoids are outside the buttocks, the cause of them is slight, and it is that you take hold of those with your nail, or that you take hold of those with a hook, and insert those, and then take care of those with water as has been said until they are healed
And whoever has the incision, cover that you administer suture to him according to this method: take a thread bundle and enter that with a needle and then extract the hemorrhoids to the upper parts, and make that penetrate with the needle at the root of the other part, and encircle the two extremities of the thread at the back of the needle, and so horizontally; and close the hemorrhoid with a strong structure, and then do not tie the thread and extract the needle.
And do all this, and leave them one and do not close them, so that the excess of the healing runs from that.
And leave it resting on the buttock immersed in olive oil or in cerate; and leave that on the buttock and command the patient to rest. And leave it until the swelling has gone down; and when it is gone, take care of those with grease or another care until they are healed
And thus, as in ancient times, it is not valid in this medicine, for you must know that when these humors are hot and moist, and when they are caused by the thick pus which issues from them, they impede their consolidation; therefore you must cure them before they are consolidated.
Then you must keep these humors in such a ratio as before until they are completely healed; and you must cure them before they are healed.</end_of_turn>
You must know that to blanch, is the key; and it is not without notice that the color of the body resembles that of the armpit, and that it is useful throughout the body, especially in the lower parts of the limbs, and because of these pains you must apply an emollient.</end_turn
And thus it is necessary to circumscribe that which is in the circuit of the key, and to hold it with forceps or one hand, and to extirpate it from its root; and you must cure that.</end_turn
And if you wish, cauterize according to what is said above in the head.</end_turn>
More commonly seen is a small, rough, round swelling on the surface of the body, and streaks of pus are seen in the majority of children.</end_turn
And the treatment for these is to stretch and puncture them, or to open them with a knife or needle until the pus has drained.</end_turn And if you wish, cauterize as we have said, with fire or acute medicine.</end_turn
More commonly seen is a small, foul-smelling swelling or large swelling on the surface of the body, which when it is cold finds itself in it as if it were a mortification of a flea, and is useful throughout the body.</end_turn
And the treatment for these is that you take a needle of awl or of trocar, and that it be strong, and place it on the flea until it fills the circle of the needle in the limbs; and then you will rotate your hand over the needle until you have punctured the flea from its root.
And if you wish, do the same with a needle of iron or steel in this way:</end_turn
The part behind the needle should be grasped with dexterity, deaf (so as not to perforate), enveloped so that the bite of the limb is softened and the rotation of that.</end_turn
And if you wish, cauterize the flea as we have said in the section on cautery of the cautery needle.</end_turn
In this way as the instruments that are administered to give comfort.</end_turn
Some ointments are useful for comfort of silver or lead or wax softened or malleated; and some ointments are useful for those instruments which are administered to the little ones because those which are administered in the treatment of young children are small; and for those in which the buttocks are rough or painful, the ointments of these are small.</end_turn
The way to give comfort to the great and the few.</end_turn
The head of the needle of the limb on which the bag is tied is wide according to this manner; and that there be distinction between the place where the bag is tied thus as sometimes.</end_turn
And the limb below the elbow, which is included in the buttocks, is deaf (so as not to burst) except for a lion, behind which there are two veins, on one side and one vein on the other side, and the breadth of the vein is according to the size of the rays and the greater the size, the smaller the vein.</end_turn
And the bag in which the medicines of bladder of beast or of sheepskin are placed, and the root of it is a palm.</end_turn
And it is pierced by four veins thus as it is rotated; and if the space between the veins is the thickness of a finger.</end_turn
And thus enter into those veins firmly with twelve threads, or more; and adjust with that the bag; and when it is placed in it the bag is stretched in the head of the comfort between two marks with strong constriction, and you must comfort with each of these: More importantly you must fill the bag with medicine, which must be scalded according to the degree of the patient's tolerance; and take care that it is neither too cold nor too hot.</end_turn
And thus the patient is placed supine on the two hips, and the legs are elevated above the chest; and a cushion is placed under the buttocks or a bandage; and oil or albumin of herbs or mucilage of fenugreek or similar is applied to the surface of the wound; and it is introduced into the fistula with ease, and the minister grasps the bulge and expresses it until it is evacuated from the wound throughout; and then the fistula is extracted and the patient lifts their legs to the side.
If the treatment forces one to remain lying down, have as much rest as possible; and if you sleep for the whole night, it is better in the morning.
Better if you delay the evacuation of the belly and the lying down of the patient until he is healed.
And if pus or blood clots are seen in the fistula, then let the fistula be wide and round, as is the custom with the fistula of children.
Take care of the wounds.
I have already said in the division of the care of wounds that it is proper for the free, and I say the same concerning the care of those with me and with medicines according to the compliment
Therefore I say that wounds are diverse according to the cause of the wounds and the place where the wound occurs
And the causes by which the wounds are caused are various, such as the bite of a stone, or incision of space or rib, or percussion with the hand, or with a fist, or with a needle, or like those of other causes.</end_turn>
Better are the wounds that are on the parts of the body like the head, or the heel, or the foot, or the belly, or the groin, or like those of the limbs.
I recommend the care of some wounds so that you stop reasoning and regulate concerning the others wounds
And I will begin with the simple head wounds, because the memory of the compound ones will come at the beginning of the third chapter
Therefore I say that when an accident happens in the head with a simple wound and it is not a fracture, consider: if it is due to the bite of a stone or something similar, and if it has already bled profusely alone and is a great wound and you fear that there may be pus coming out, then cover the head immediately with a dressing and evacuate the head as soon as possible; extract it according to the amount of the virtue of the dressing if there is no other prohibiting cause of evacuation, especially if the wound that has been evacuated is little.</end_turn>
And let the evacuation be counter to the side of the wounded part; and keep the patient from eating and drinking and eating coarse food.</end_turn>
Better if from the beginning it prohibits any cause, then let the food be diminished and do not approach meat or drink.</end_turn
And stop the wound, if pus comes out from the wound, cover it with ointment of olive oil or in wine in which it is stopped.</end_turn
Better if you are sure of the pus coming out, then stop over the wound, if it is recent at the hip joint and the air has not moved that dust which I recommend to remove with a little brush.</end_turn
And if the air has already moved that, stop over the wound until it is healed.</end_turn
Better if the wound is great or is for incision of space and something similar, and the edges are not adjusted for pupils, then adjust them with sutures as I recommend for their sutures.</end_turn
Better if the wound has already been uncovered from the bone and the pulp, and it is not a retention but a little swelling, then prick it and apply medicine to the wound and restore the limb nearby in place of bleeding, and command the patient not to eat foods that are coarse: heads and brains and things like that, until it is healed.</end_turn
And if you find in the wound putrefying and does not adhere to the bone, then prick everything that can be pricked and remove what can be removed, and apply treatment to it.</end_turn
Better if in these wounds there is an artery or vein from which blood flows profusely, and which is not stopped by medicines, then inquire about the artery, and if you find that it is not injured, then prick it with a needle, or ligate it; and if necessary you must cause that which we have said is not to be done, then cauterize it until the blood is stopped.</end_turn
If these plaguas are simple and small, the cause of them is slight; thus you should powder over them that which consolidates when it is dry, for it alters those.
The manner of applying the powder is as follows: take one part of olive oil, two parts of st. John's wort, and three parts of unrefined rosin; mix them together and grind them, and let the plague be filled with it, and let it be tightly closed so that it may adhere to that, and let it be solidified with st. John's wort.</end_of_turn>
Then strengthen the area with powder and read it, and do not remove it until it has dried, for it is not banished by medicine until it has healed.</end_of_turn>
And every time it is done alone, when it is not at your disposal olive oil and st. John's wort.
And thus this same operation is done in great plagues when it is necessary to pause over them and restrain them, and only in recent plagues where their sanctum has not been altered.</end_of_turn>
And if they have been altered, and especially when it is in summer, it is not understood that the position of this powder is good; thus you should suspend over them soft substances such as unguents, or suspend over them barley flour mixed with water and honey until it has become reduced; and take care of them with the other treatment until they are healed.</end_of_turn>
Or if it happens in the plague that a fracture occurs in a limb, and it is small, then you extract from it with your hand.</end_of_turn
And I say concerning the treatment of fractures of the head that it is venomous.</end_of_turn>
Of the plagues of the groin.</end_of_turn>
Or if the plague happens in the groin, there is no difference in treatment between it and the plague of the head when it is simple.</end_of_turn
Or if the nerves of the groin are cut or an artery, if it is a nerve, it is not in their engineering but it should be avoided treatment of them with that which makes violent stitching, even as with zinc and sage, which is ancient and seems to be useful for them because it does not touch the nerves and opposes that.</end_of_turn And do not suspend over the plague any cause of great cold, for the substance of the nerves is cold and the continuation of it is at the brain, which is the most important of all members.</end_of_turn
And if it must be treated with medicines that are slight, as is the cause of a washed wound with soft water, any vegetable juice mixed with olive oil or not-oiled, and throw it out when it has been washed with soft water and the other small stones, as is said above, and rub it dry.</end_of_turn
Or if the plague is great, then administer sutures, or bandage its edges, and take care of it with powders until it is healed.</end_of_turn
Or if the plague has depth or has happened at the lower part of the body, then perforate it in the place where it is most depressed.</end_of_turn
Or if in the plague an artery has already been cut and blood flow has been achieved, then separate or dry that, or tie that, or cauterize that if necessary to cause it to bleed.</end_of_turn
Or if the spinal column of the groin or all of them have already been cut, and the veins of the groin have been saved, then you adjust the edges of the thigh over the hip bone with sutures without touching that; keep that equal and reduce that to its natural figure, and strengthen that by stretching it properly, and read it for a few days; and take care of that until the bleeding stops.</end_of_turn
Or if the plague has already caused pain in the bone, then pierce that; and if there are fragments of bone in it, extract them all; and what is not broken, read it until the plague has disappeared, and be separate and relieve the discharge of it.</end_of_turn
And if the plague is recent, then powder over that the powder that has been recommended to you.</end_of_turn Or if there is a fistula in the plague, then care for that with water of which the memory will come later in the chest.</end_of_turn
If it is percussion of the groin or navel, and sometimes of its depth, consider more if there is any wind than the patient has; for the plague is mortal.</end_of_turn
If in them there is no depth and the disease is recent, then you should wait in them for the first hour before powdering them, and do not stretch that until it is not retained in the depth of them and returns to the heart and increases the disease, but wait in them gently, and remove that dose of medicine which you gave yesterday.
If the tongue is not there, then you should wait in the orifice of the disease for a while because of the humors; and make the disease sleep over the disease so that it runs what is in it adjusted.
But if already of the disease three days have passed or more and it has not happened that the patient has spasmodic pain or bad tremor of the heart or stricture of the belly, and sometimes other good symptoms of the disease, then you know that the disease is saved; and then care for that as for calouses and for the other care that is necessary until it is healed.
But if the healing of the disease is excused, and it has already opened, then you know that the fistula is already formed; care for that for its head
And if the disease is for incision of space or of bone, and is simple on the surface of the foot or of the thigh, then you care for that as for what precedes suture, if it is great, or as for powdering, if it is small.
But if already there has been made price in the bone, and so only of it has been pierced, then you twist the disease and cover to extract those pieces, if they are separated But if they are not separated, then you read the whole until the disease is relaxed, because the extraction of them is alleviated
And for the other diseases that happen in the other members, the help in their care is the help of what has been said.
Of the diseases of the belly.
The discomfort that occurs in the belly is or great, or little, or medium
And a small disruption is difficult for another way, and even if the reduction of them is more difficult, if you do not take care of the introduction of them to the head so that it does not open and is thickened because the contents are difficult to extract
And therefore the best disruption is medium, because in that one the reduction of the belly is not difficult, even as it is difficult in the two preceding ones
And you know that the suture of the belly is done in four ways, but two sutures are common that they are customary in the sutures of the other diseases of the body
And two other sutures are proper of the other diseases, but indeed they are more proper in the suture of the belly
And I recommend to you to speak of every exposure and declaration
Therefore I say that when the disease is small and there is any cause of the belly for that, and it is difficult to reduce that, the hour is in one of two ways: or for the smallness of the disruption as we have said, or when the belly is affected by inflammation due to the coldness of the air.
Therefore when it is like that, the hour is that you cover that immediately that you immerse a sponge soaked in warm water alone, or that you compress with water squinants, and chamomile, and pepper, and cloves in that belly until the inflammation is resolved.
Many medicines make that which has stopped bleeding, and it is better than only water in resolving the inflammation.
And when the inflammation is resolved, the hour is that you moisten the belly with water in which it is immersed at a high temperature and mallow, because by that the contents are alleviated with little cause
But if the contents are excused by this care, the hour is to cut the disruption with a small instrument with which only the incisions are wounded.
The first care is better, when it is proper that it is not dry, and that it is not an occupation to force unnecessarily and to starve.
Of the instrument, its shape:
One part is acute, and the other part not acute, and the extremity should be blunt, and not at all like the bluntness of a sponge, bending a little forward
Therefore, when the plague becomes more intense and the intestine comes out, it is necessary that its reduction be performed in the natural way, in the appropriate place, if possible over the area which is better.
When the disruption is widespread, and is in the lower part of the belly, it is necessary to place the patient over the two buttocks and suspend the lower limbs above the navel; and if it is in the upper part of the belly, it is necessary to suspend the head and the upper limbs above the chest.</end_of_turn>
Similarly, if the disruption is in one of the two halves of the belly, then you must suspend your understanding and consideration for a moment in order that the affected part may be higher than the other.</end_of_turn>
And thus it is necessary to administer cold in the great plagues and in the intermediate plagues.</end_of_turn>
And in the small plagues, suspend cold that is ready to hand, and immediately provide that it be administered between your greatest pains, which has the disruption throughout with its hand and adjusts the lips, and immediately uncover from that to that in which any suture may cause you to stop.</end_of_turn
This is the common suture technique: that you grasp the needle, or the handle of the needle according to the extent of the swelling; and immediately lay aside the extremity of the disruption from the little finger; and tighten the needle once, or twice as much as you do not want to tear the two ends of the cord, at the two extremities which are left by the cord from the parts which are descending, until you have pierced through that part; and you have already added two extremities of the cord and two extremities of the phalanx, so that there are four orders in total.</end_of_turn>
And immediately tighten once more at the circle of the needle, and several threads of two parts together, and immediately add the two lips and the swelling by addition; and immediately withdraw the thickness of the finger and fix another needle in that place, and immediately bind that as firmly as the first needle; and do not cease doing this until you have completed the entire contraction of the swelling.</end_of_turn
And if the needles are small between fat and leanness, because the fine needles do not pierce the flesh willingly; and the large ones are difficult to handle in the cord, therefore it is necessary that they be done in leanness and fatness.</end_of_turn
And it is not necessary that the needle be fixed at two extremities of the cord too much, so that the flesh is not pierced too willingly and that the swelling opens before its consolidation.</end_of_turn
And do not prolong the suture too much so that the swelling is not prohibited from consolidation.</end_of_turn>
And immediately pierce the extremities of the needles so that they do not disturb the patient who is sleeping; and will stop over the suture loose threads from all around, which have the extremities of the needles; and withdraw those as soon as you know that the swelling is already consolidated.</end_of_turn
These methods of suture with needles in cold weather are more convenient in the small plagues, because they require only one or two needles or around those.</end_of_turn
But the second suture is common: that you administer with the suture the four extremities, of the cord and two extremities of the phalanx, at once, with a needle in which be firmly enclosed cloth in leanness and fatness.</end_of_turn
And immediately when the needle has pierced these four extremities, reduce the needle of that middle part from which you began, so that the thread is drawn back box of the soft parts that rise up to the swelling, so that the suture is as much like a normal suture as possible.</end_of_turn
And pause between each suture the quantity of the thickness of the middle finger.</end_of_turn
This suture is harmful to women.</end_turn
And in such a suture I saw that the swelling which had been caused to a man in his belly which had been affected by a boil, which was the greatest swelling of a palm, and which was expelled from the intestines around two palms of the heel and was the disruption in the middle of the limb; and when I had reduced that, after the swelling had been outside the plague for forty-eight hours.</end_of_turn
And the plague was consolidated in about fifteen days or around, and it healed that and it is healthy; and it is said that it is the custom in these matters.</end_of_turn
And other doctors had given up that it would not be healed; and by a miracle, behold, it healed without any remedy, for in that place there was neither any other remedy nor any medicine, but I stayed over the plague constantly for two days and gave it constant attention with honey water until it healed.</end_of_turn
May I say two kinds of sutures which are proper according to the narration of Paraula.
And it is that you commence with the suture of the tendon, and enter the needle from the part of the tendon towards the part of the tendon.
And thus when the needle pierces the tendon and in that middle lacerate straight and along the whole body, and leave the end of the gut which you have inserted the needle into; and make penetrate in the other end the needle from the part of the tendon towards the part of the tendon in the other end of the body
And thus when you have finished making that penetrate, then make another incision in that middle part of the body from the part of the tendon towards the part of the tendon; and leave the gut which is in that place, and make penetrate the needle in the other end from the part of the tendon towards the part of the tendon
And thus make penetrate also that the other incision which you made in the gut which is in the part of the body which is under all those which penetrate
And thus begin from this middle side and as that which is at the end of the gut in the other side, and extract the needle from the tendon which penetrates, and then reduce that in that tendon and close the gut which is in the other side of this body; and extract that from the tendon which is from the part of the body
And make two incisions and another, and make another incision near another incision until you close all that which is from before according to that example.
And the sum of this manner of stitching is that you close with a suture of skin with which you close the skin, except that you leave an opening at the part of the end of the tendon, and that you leave that other opening until it is complete.
Moreover the second kind of proper suture which I say is called Gualia, and this is thus recommended for them, is that you close according to the custom which certain medicants close that, except that you add all the parts to their proper parts to them convenient in nature; and apply the other part of them to the other part of them, and that is done according to what I have recommended to you
Because you have left the needle in the part of the body at your will from the part of the tendon, and you make that penetrate to the part of the tendon in that hole, and leave two gut ends; and then you reverse the needle and make that penetrate from the part of the tendon towards the part of the tendon in two gut ends.
And thus reverse those pieces, and make penetrate any which are from the part of the tendon towards the part of the tendon in two gut ends which are in the other side.
And this manner of stitching is better than the common suture of the lighter kind, and is a suture of which there is precedent.
This is the term of Gualia.
And I will tell you something, the suture of the belly is rectified with two needles, so that you enter with these into each gut a thread, and begin with the introduction of the needle from that which is towards you, and make that penetrate into the other side according to the suture of those which close the body parts together
And you know that when the disruption is in the middle of the belly, the hour of stitching it is more difficult than in the other parts of the belly.
Moreover the saying of the physicians is that the judgement of the plague is like that of the other plagues.
Which cause is that when you become aware of the recent plague at the place of health that the air alters that, and reduces the gut and close that and put that away diligently, the hour you stop over that dusty powder
And if the air has already altered the plague, the hour you stop over that dust at that moment until it makes a hard stone and holds the guts, and consolidates gut and body; and take care of that as well as is the care of the other plagues until it is healthy
Moreover if you are not present the medicines, the hour you stop over that much, because it begins to vomit bile, cough violently, and change two gut juices which you give, as you have been taught, until it is healthy, because you do not digest another medicine in large quantities when the plagues are simple
Moreover if you fear that the plague communicates by wound to the principal members, the hour you cover that with lion fat in quality olive oil, or in sweet oil, and stop that in the circle of the places which are between the armpits and leave the armpits free.
If pain or decay is felt in the thighs, where fat has gathered, and swellings appear, it is said that the cause is an accumulation of black bile which has become infected, and is more so when the infection has penetrated the fat and has spread inwards.
It is known that the large intestine is pus-filled and easily heals, while that of the small intestine is of a finer consistency
It is difficult to heal because the belly which is called "gegunu" does not accept the application of a salve that would otherwise suffice in other cases; for there are many veins in it and because of their great number and their proximity to nerves
If it is a wound that has come from the plague, and if you are able to make it recent, reduce it as much as you can according to your instructions for healing swellings
If it has already passed beyond the space and has become green or black, however, when you strengthen your hand firmly over the area that is painful, in order to prevent the flow of blood, for in the wound there are veins and arteries.
And so it is necessary to cut through what is another ligament, and suspend the two extremities of the hand from the part where the plague has spread, so that there is relief of the traction of the tissues and the emission of the plague from the wound
Remember the plagues when they happen in the belly
When there is disruption in the belly and it is slight, it is possible that it will be contained within the abdomen, in order to help that which was affected by the plague in the lower belly through percussion of the hand, which was the plague of the lower part of the stomach, and the plague was old and the fistula was formed, and the evacuation of its contents and exhalation of air
And so we must continue the care of the wound even if we are not confident in the healing of the wound, but we must diligently apply that which will restore the integrity of the limb when the wound has healed and the area is consolidated.
And we must also consider the general condition of the patient who has suffered this accident in the lower belly; and do not neglect any other cause of the illness that remains in his body, such as hunger and thirst, and to drink and eat, and to put him in a warm bath and exercise as he is able
I have also heard from experienced people that when the plague is slight in the belly, it should be treated in this way: take large doses of caps; and when you bring the two lips of the plague close together and open your mouth over them, the head of the plague will stick to the lips and will not be dissolved
And so we must give another dose immediately, and do not cease giving them until we have given as many doses as there are in the whole plague
And so we must reduce the swelling and the pain of the plague; and keep those caps attached to the belly until the belly is healed; and do not neglect the patient's general condition during this time
It is possible that the belly is attached with a fine thread which is the cause of the beastly belly; for it is more like a needle; and if you grasp the extremity of this thread and do not tear it, and you tie the extremity of it to the faithful limb, encircling it, and pass the thread through needles and sew up that part of the belly, and reduce that which is in the disruption
This way of stitching with doses of caps is nothing but a way of hoping and trusting in God<end_turn>
If the plague is great and wide, more so if it is in one of the small intestines, then it is not sufficient to give only a small dose; and it is not the cure for all of it
Treatment of worms and fistula<end_turn>
It is known that all plagues and swellings when they grow old and become rotten become ulcers, and are not consolidated and always get their arm broken and are not separated, the hour in any member, is universally called fistula and is named after those worms<end_turn>
And fistula according to the truth is a foul, hard, white ulcer with which there is no pain and which is concave just as much as a wound from sorrow; and for this reason it is called a wound of sorrow or penalty<end_turn
It is in the moist belly which gets its arm broken; and when the moisture is expelled, it is separated in a few hours<end_turn> Some of these worms expel this moisture which is moist, little, great, and subtle<end_turn
Indeed, all those causes have already been shown, as well as the symptoms and the treatment of them, in the division.
And so I shall tell you about the cure for fistula, which is effective by means of an operation with my hand.
You know that fistula can occur in all parts of the body; for some are fistulas which arise from great veins and arteries, or nerves, or the brain, or the intestines, or the bladder, or the kidneys, or any of the vertebrae, or the joints which are composed of bones in such a way as the hand and foot; and of these those which are closest to the main limb and which resemble them.
Therefore, that fistula which is treated in this manner is among the diseases of difficult healing, and does not respond to treatment, and requires work and ignorance.
And if it is a fistula of any depth which does not reach these areas which I have mentioned, and you hope and trust in the treatment of it, and you wish to achieve cognition of it, when you attempt to remove or cauterize it, and if the fistula goes according to rule, then inquire about it from me.</start_of_turn>
Perhaps if the fistula is tortuous, then inquire about the attempt to place the hand under the root of the limb, because the lifting of the body of the limb is alleviated and curved against the tortuousness.</start_of_turn>
And if the fistula is not accompanied by horrifying symptoms, it is not within your power to know about it by attempting to inquire about it.</start_of_turn
Therefore glorify the Lord for his wonders, for the moisture which comes from his hands overcomes the others and runs from them.</start_of_turn
And inquire cautiously, according to what manner you are able, whether here is bone or nerve, and whether the curvature of the fistula is long or short, or whether it is a fistula to which some or all of these orifices are joined and this is beyond the sum of all your strength, your wisdom, your knowledge of diseases, and your invention of the pain which comes from your compression with your hand over the area, and resemblance to the symptoms and the accidental causes of apostema.</start_of_turn
And when you have stood over all these causes and have confirmed them, then you shall see the treatment with confidence: that is, when you consider that if it is a fistula which is close to the surface or in the limb, long from the joint, or of a nerve, or of an artery, or a vein, or of any of the places which I have mentioned to you, I say.</start_of_turn
Therefore dry the fistula as I have said above in the narration, and remain over that which is in the filtering and putrefaction, and that which is born in the orifice of the flesh, or in the blood vessels, or in resemblance, and cure that which comes when it is healed.</start_of_turn
However if the fistula is of great depth and is according to rule, then I advise you to inscribe that in the preparation as much as you can, and to moderate that of all your corrupted flesh; and to administer warm compresses covered with medicines which are acute, and to introduce them into the curvature of the fistula which you have comprehended with the hand.</start_of_turn
And do this with any herbs which are within you that the acute medicine may corrode all that remains in the curvature of the fistula of the corruption.</start_of_turn
And finally restore that which engenders healthy flesh until it is healed.</start_of_turn
However if it is not healed by this, then cauterize it as I have recommended.</start_of_turn
However if the cause of the fistula is bone and is due to you, then inquire about it and dry it according to what I have recommended, if you do not prohibit any cause of vein or nerve or main limb as I have said.</start_of_turn
However if it is discovered to you that it is in them any corruption and blackness, then remove that which is corrupted throughout; and care for that which remains until it is healed.</start_of_turn
If it is not healthy and the patient has a swollen wrist, it is clear that you have not reached the complete eradication of the corruption; and now you discover it on them subsequently and excellently perform the reason for them and the transformation of them with the posterior reinforcement of your power, and then restore the latter.
Therefore, if he is healthy, it is well; but if not, it is clear that that corruption is in the profound depths of the body, which you have not been able to overcome, and consequently you must lay aside that which does not work
And if the corruption is slight, or you are able to drive it out, then at that time you drive it out with fine forceps which are suitable for this purpose.
And if bones are moved, then excellently perform the extraction of all those, and of those do not leave any cause with your strength.
Perhaps there is some cause from the humors, and at the beginning there is no fear or error, but then it is necessary to cut those ligaments or tissues if they are here, and deliver the bones
Perhaps if you are not prepared to extract the bones at your time, then pause over the wound so that the wound does not worsen, and leave that until the bones of flesh and ligaments are in the vicinity, and keep the wound from solidifying, and constrict the incision that you have made in your operation
Having said that, if you fear it, pause over the wound covered in soft tissue with oil, or over the wound covered in Egyptian unguent, or in some of the above-mentioned unguents, because when they touch those ligaments, and the bones are separated from their socket, the wound will be relieved
Perhaps if it is a great bone, such as the bone of the limb or the bone of the thigh or something like those, and what is corrupted of it is only the surface, then at that time you should burn that only behind until that black spot and corruption have been consumed, and then restore the wound
Perhaps if what is corrupted is a great part, and the corruption has already reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to close that and everything that has been incised in order to reach the corruption, and to cure that which has solidified.
And I recommend to you that you should ask a man in his bed to stay with you so that he can watch and assist you in your operation.
For a boy of about xxx years of age, who has suffered pain in his side, and from whose parts the greatest part of the matter has gone into the body until the matter has reached the side, and is a matter of great swelling, and not of external cause.
And consequently the time is prolonged in that for the error of the doctors until the swelling has subsided, and we must remove from it the morbid matters, and the care of it is to stop when the limb is stitched, and to do what is useful in those morbid matters that all the poisons and humors of the body are eliminated.
And thus there are many physicians who have treated him for two years, and I do not know anything about it, except that I have been called
I saw the limb of that man and the matter that flowed from those wounds from great wounds; and already the body of that man was quite stable and the color was lemon yellow.
And then I introduced the hook into one of those wounds and reached the bone.
And I saw that they had all disappeared from all parts of the limb.
And then I covered myself and incisions were made on one of those wounds until I had scraped away a piece of the bone, and I saw that that which was corrupted was already dry and rotten and putrefied; and already a part of the limb was corrupted before I had pierced into the marrow
And so I completed what was necessary and prepared from the bone that I had discovered
I said that it was not in the bone except for that corruption which had fled and I had cured, and I had already extracted it.</start_of_turn>
And at that time I stopped the restoration of the wound with consolidated medicine for a long time, and it was not consolidated.</start_of_turn>
And I repeated and discovered again on the bone according to the first discovery, and I saw that there was continuing corruption of the bone.</start_of_turn
And I saw that it appeared to me from that corruption, and at that time I had to make an opening to make the care and restoration, and it was not restored.</start_of_turn>

And the end of it is triangular and acute-tipped.
It is made of Indian steel, and resembles all the causes that we have mentioned of razors, of scissors and of saws.</start_of_turn>
From the incision of the extremities to the closing of the bones.</start_of_turn
The extremities are sometimes supported by an intrinsic cause or an extrinsic cause, or as you have treated that corruption for the care of those medicines and the care does not interfere, or sometimes the corruption goes away from the limb without you having inflicted any cause, when in that case you must suture that limb as soon as possible in order to prevent the disease from spreading due to death or malice that is more harmful to the limb.</start_of_turn
And the sign of that is that the limb is black inside before it is healed, or that it becomes pale almost black before the black has disappeared from that part of the limb which surrounds it and fills it up; and therefore you must know that you must suture that limb immediately.</start_of_turn
And in the same way, if the cause of the corruption is a blow of some venomous causes such as a scorpion of the sea, or a viper, or a bite of a spider.
If the corruption or the blow is in the extremity of the finger, then you must suture the finger and do not leave space for the corruption to enter your hand.</start_of_turn>
And in the same way, if you reach the hand, then you must suture from the root of the hair, and do not leave space for the corruption to enter until you have closed the wound in the hair of the arm.</start_of_turn
And if you touch it, then you must suture the arm inside the groove at the joint.</start_of_turn
And if this happens again, the disease is mortal; and to administer another cause along with the treatment is useless.</start_of_turn
And in the same way, if the corruption affects the toe, then you must suture that within one of the nails.</start_of_turn
If you prick the sole of the foot, then you will cut through the whole foot. If you pierce within the nail, then you will cut through the nail itself at the joint of the nail.</end_of_turn>
And if the corruption has already spread over the nail, then it is not sufficient to do anything but to dismiss it, and let the patient die.</end_of_turn>
The manner of piercing the limb or cutting it is that you grasp the ligament behind which you wish to pierce, and grasp another ligament over the bone; extend the minister one ligament to the sides, and extend the minister another ligament on the other side; and you separate the flesh which is between two ligaments without damage until the whole flesh is uncovered; and then pierce or cut.</end_of_turn
And take care that the blood from all sides is absorbed so that it does not touch the bone, and that the patient suffers adjusted injury and afterwards apply cautery.</end_of_turn
If blood flows excessively when working, then you cauterize the area superficially, or stop them until the blood vessels are narrowed; and then return to your medication until completion.</end_of_turn
And then bind the affected limb with a ligament as desired, and care for him until he is healed.</end_of_turn>
I urge you that in such an emergency you summon a man skilled in this matter, this man whom I recommended to you, who knows how to handle such an accident without causing greater damage than was originally present.</end_of_turn>
And that corruption is first of all in the toe until it extends throughout the foot.</end_of_turn>
And then that man prepares himself for this and when he comes he will care for the limb with great diligence, so that the pain and suffering of the limb will vanish, and he will pierce the foot at the joint, and restore health.</end_of_turn
For a long time that medicine has known this corruption in the thumb of the hand.</end_of_turn
And then I saw that it was necessary for me to perform this procedure in order to stop the proliferation of this superfluousness which was placed upon the hand of the physicians, to prevent the corruption of the body; and it does not cause the proliferation, but it begins to abate from the thumb inwards as soon as it starts from the hand.</end>
And I was ordered to pierce the hand, and I did not fear the result of that superfluousness, for I thought that it would be safer to leave the hand dead than to risk the benefit of the patient.</end_of_turn
And when he awoke from his sleep, he returned to his home and I learned that that man had prepared and pierced his hand throughout, and he was healed.</end_of_turn
I have not told this story except to show what happens in this ailment, and what is its significance, and for what purpose it is useful.</end_of_turn
Take care without negligence and with the quality of your treatment like a doctor.</end_of_turn>
When an abscess occurs in a fleshy limb, the space of the abscess is prolonged until collection of pus is complete, and then it is broken and pierced, and the pus is expelled from it, and the limb is left as it was before, as if it were a vessel, and the bone that is under it is slightly bent, and there is no further corruption, and no damage is done to the bone or nerves or ligaments, it is called a wound, and it is not named an abscess.</end_of_turn
But if the space is prolonged until the corruption spreads to some limb, then it is called an abscess and not a wound.</end_of_turn
The treatment of this is that you should pierce that bone throughout as if it were revolted, and more so when it is slightly bent and is useful like a mark, and comfort yourself that it does not adhere to the bone due to its corruption.</end_of_turn
But if you hope that the bone will adhere and that the corruption will not cause further damage, and if the bone has already become loose, then you should care for the wound.</end_of_turn
And you must consider the patient, and if he is great, and if the limb that you are examining has a foul odor, then you should cauterize that limb with Egyptian medicine which is of olive oil and vinegar and vinegar of roses, and you should apply it in a vessel and cover it over fire until the medicine is complete and has reached its due point of specification.</end_of_turn
And then take from it what is necessary and dissolve it in water and honey; cauterize the limb with that, strengthen its orifices, and leave the medicine on it for two hours.</end_of_turn
And thus extract that which is spread around; and do so until the pain has disappeared and the swelling has subsided.
The liquid is to be treated with ashes from the vinegar, when not being used for this remedy; and that you take vinegar and put it on them; and thus join that with the vinegar until you feel that the pain has passed away.</end_of_turn>
If the patient does not tolerate the Egyptian medicine or the vinegar with ashes, then do this: clusterize the vinegar and honey together and add some powdered zinc, and clusterize the vinegar and honey together, because the property of honey is to soften and cleanse, and the vinegar makes the swelling adhere to the bone, and more so when there is an excess of stiffness and dryness.</end_of_turn>
And when you have done this to the liquid several times and you feel that the pain has subsided, then clusterize the liquid that makes the flesh swell.</end_of_turn
And take a dose of diaphoretic medicine and dissolve that oil of rosemary in vinegar; or clusterize that liquid with any other medicines that have the properties which I have already written in the treatise on medicines.</end_of_turn>
And if the opening of the bone is narrow in which the catheter of the cluster is not received, then enlarge that space little by little, and place in it gauze soaked in Egyptian or basilic ointment until it is enlarged.</end_of_turn
Similarly, if the opening is wide, then suture the edges of it and leave them as much as is necessary for the amount of liquid that will remain inside the cluster.</end_of_turn
And if the limb from which the pain originates is elevated to the upper parts, then dry that area around the bone that is below in order that the limb may be drawn inwards, because when the limb is contracted in the bend of the bone, the flesh is pressed against it.</end_of_turn
And if it is not possible to dry the bone within the cavity of the limb as you wish, then you must perforate that you prepare the limb with the preparation for which the limb is voluntarily drawn outwards as you are accustomed, and that no obstacle be retained in the limb.</end_of_turn>
May the one who is over the opening of the bone, which you must leave for an hour in order that it should heal, keep that which is adjusted in it from the limb.</end_of_turn> And so that you may know if that which comes out of the limb is thick or thin, or is digested or undigested.</end_of_turn
And concerning the location of that bone, if in it the patient feels pain or not, and if it is swelling.</end_of_turn
And when your medicine is prolonged in this manner, and you see that the matter that is gathered over the opening of the bone has already adhered, or has proper adherence, then you must remove it or perform a third day, and when you remove the dressing, change the bandage and renew the ointment.</end_of_turn
May there not be any subtle virus nearby the bone, for you must not be discouraged by the adherence of the dressing, because the healing of the limb is proper, because some people take a long time to generate flesh in the wounds, and in those in which it is useful to the contrary.</end_of_turn
And if the limb has remained unmoving for several days, the bone will not adhere; and if the adherence of the bone is delayed and is the cause of the prolongation, then you must adjust with the evacuation of the medicines, and if the medicines are humified in their substance and in their power, they are as dry as vinegar, when adjusted with an excessive addition of salt.</end_of_turn
And the thing that must not be omitted which is cured, is that you take a dose of diaphoretic medicine and dissolve it in oil of rosemary, and pour it on that, and mix that with vinegar of an equal amount in its substance, and do so to that.
And thus make it similar in that action, when not to the limb, take diaphoretic medicine, honey when it is cold until it is absorbed, and use it; or take myrrh and aloes and incense, grind them all up and powder them over the honey when it is lukewarm, and pour that over the wound and bind that over the bone; and pour that over the honey that has already been absorbed until it is absorbed, and powder that over the wound and bind that.</end_of_turn
Every herb is administered along with long-standing aristology and the reason of the celestial lily (and it is the celestial lily) and barley flour and centaury, and use of these simples or adjusted, crush them and sprinkle over honey which I have recommended; and drink of it.
If the pain persists for a long time, and it is not suitable for this treatment, it is understood that the corruption is in the bowels, and already makes inquiry among the bones or in other firm members or ligaments; then treat it with fistular care, as it is said above.
Treatment of swelling and inflammation of nails added with incision of the finger and section
Swelling is a swelling that does not leave the nail of the finger or toe, and it extends to other fingers, and when it is prolonged and its treatment is less valuable, or it is a swelling of a swelling, or it is corrupted, and it emits a stench until it corrodes the root of the nail, and it corrupts the whole, and it is harmful to the limb when it is at the odor, and its color is harmful yellow.
And therefore when you have that which we have said in the division and you do not comply with your treatment, it is understood that you must instill with all your might the whole abundance that is removed from the nail and then cauterize the ulcer nearby as much as necessary, because the cautery will not be useful in this case.</end_of_turn>
More if the bone is soft and the nail is sound, and the surrounding parts of the nail have already begun to decay, and to puncture them and remove them, when you cover the edge of the nail that you are cutting with the finger of your hand, and you push it forward and cut it with the knife, and leave over what remains of the flesh of the remedies that burn away the corrosive ones until it is all gone; and treat that which remains until it is healed.</end_of_turn>
More if the corruption has already taken hold in the bone, it is understood that you must instill it and extract it, for no time is it healthy that the bone is corrupted.</end_of_turn>
And if sometimes the corruption and the decay go down to the finger, it is understood that you must cut it out at one of the nails as soon as you remember it, and treat that which remains until it is healed.</end_of_turn
More if the nail has percussion or injury, and if there is violent pain, it is understood that you must at the beginning apply cold compresses to the patient, and then dry the nail with a fine sponge or a sharp knife, and take care that the incision does not penetrate the flesh that is left under the nail, because you will cause the violent pain, and if you do this you will cause the adjusted flesh to be superfluous in the place; and treat that area with that which relieves pain.</end_of_turn
More said adjusted, which is born in the most of households, is very fleshy all around, and is only in the bones, or is in the nail.</end_of_turn>
And the swellings of them are born in the root of the joint, or is the birth of them in the bones of the fingers.</end_of_turn More the one that is born in the bones of the finger does not hurt, and the one that is born in the joints is painful.</end_of_turn
And of those that are fleshy, the incision is slight, and it is that you must instill that which must remove its root with a blunt spatula.</end_of_turn
More of that which is born in the root of the joint, the treatment is difficult; and therefore take care of the excision of it.</end_of_turn
More if it is born in the finger you must at the beginning cover the flesh with the incision round about the bone, and then grasp with one of those sharp knives convenient to that, and treat that which remains until it is healed.</end_of_turn
More consolidation that happens to the fingers between their joints due to the vegetation of herbs or for the birth of the fetus that does not depart, or for consolidation of pus or for burning of fire, or for remaining, it is understood that you must remove that consolidation until the fingers return to their natural shape.</end_of_turn
And also stop between their cloths with olive oil so that they do not become permanently consolidated, and separate between them, or put between them a layer of soft lead until it is consolidated as much as necessary.</end_of_turn
Similarly if consolidation happens in the bones of the hand with the palm, it is understood that you must dry that consolidation as it is prepared and agree to the figure of the limb.</end_of_turn
From the incision of vices, so are varicose veins.</end_of_turn
Vices are varicose veins, and they are veins that are wrapped around and are full of thick, black bile-like fluids that circulate in the limbs of the body, and their greatest advancement is in the veins of the travelers and the laborers and the porters.</end_of_turn
Adonc cove que tu administres purguacio del cors de colera negra alcunas veguadas am expulcio fort, e aprop sangna le pacient de la vena basilica.
May the care of them be by two methods: one is that it be without sense and that the black bile be driven out, and the other method is that the vein be raised and all of it be extracted.
The incision is performed in this manner: grasp the beginning of the limb with lukewarm water until the thick bile is resolved, which is beneficial for the limb, and then stretch the limb of the patient to the upper part of the thigh, to the outside of the hip joint, with a bandage, and then dry the vein in one place, or in two, or in three in a wide incision, and then raise the black bile to the lower part of the thigh towards the genitals, and let it go in juice, until the amount that you wish and which you often see in the vomit is discharged, and which will tolerate the virtue of the patient.
And do the same with the other, and command them to abstain from foods that generate black bile.
And repeat the cure for vomiting when the veins are full and until the patient notices it
May the elevation of them be performed in this manner: you elevate the limb of the patient, if there is movement in it, and then put it in water and grasp the limb of the patient with lukewarm water until it swells and the veins are relaxed; or that it be exercised with great exercise, if water is not at your disposal, until the limb is blistered
And at the end of the vein cut the cord in the groin or at the back of the limb must be given the denticle, or in the lower part of the limb you must do the same
And cover the wound with a bandage and scour the vein throughout until it appears, and when the appearance of it is such that it sometimes asks to be black.
And therefore when you avoid it and the cord sometimes turns white, it is cord
And at the same time put your hand under it so that it is elevated and held away from the cord, and suspend it with an onion or sponge
And make another incision nearby that one for three fingers, and then scour the cord from the part below the vein until it appears
And elevate it and incision that must be given at the rear must be given the talus, and at the same time extract that and elevate it until it is discharged through the second incision, and at the same time extract that from the first incision
And do the same until you extract that from the highest part or from all the incisions, until all is discharged; and when the incisions are made
And if you do not obey to order to extract and elevate, then put in a strong double needle and tie that, or put your hand under it and rotate your hand throughout until it is bled dry And keep in mind that it must not be injured; for if it is broken, it is useful for you to be unable to elevate that and it is harmful to the patient for that night.
And when that is all outside, the doctor should rest on the place of the wound with a soft cloth soaked in wine and olive oil, and care for that until it is healed.
And if the vein is contracted has not suffered any discomfort of which it is surrounded, and is not according to the rule that we have said, then the doctor must cover that he makes the incisions throughout the parts of the discomfort of them and the places of their covering, and at the same time suspend that with an onion until he elevates that whole thing.
And keep in mind your incision must not be made on the vein and that you do not touch that, because if you do it will be difficult for you to elevate that; and use your prudence in that
Form of the incident in which the vein is dried:
It is not like sponges or acute extremities so that it does not touch the vein; and it has great flexibility like a lion, because if it were soft, it would break the vein by its softness; having it in this way is enough for its great size as we have said
Extraction of the thigh vein.
This vein is engendered in the limbs in the lower parts just like the al-Ategi in the Arabian lands and in the arid lands of India with little humidity and in the ones where there is neither grass nor trees.
The pain is also often engendered in other parts of the body by other wounds.
The cause of such disease is the corruption of the blood, which brings about the swelling of the body like serpents and worms, and causes the appearance of boils and worms between the flesh and bone.</end_of_turn>
The sign of the impending arrival of this disease is that the veins which lie under the swelling become inflamed; and their vessels are seen; and they begin to swell from the point where the swelling first appeared, as if they were rooted to the ground.</end_of_turn>
And when the limb appears, then cover that part with a plum whose weight is equal to two drachmas. Enter two drachmas, and notice that and leave the plum suspended from the limb.</end_of_turn>
And so many times as you see these things in other parts of the body, cover them with lead and notice that.)</end_of_turn And if it is not prolonged, then remove a part of the swelling and cover the rest; do not remove that which is outside and has gone dry, for if you remove that which is still raw and enters the bone, it will cause further swelling and ulcers.)</end_of_turn
For it must be treated gently and gradually, until it is finally expelled from behind the bone and does not leave any remaining cause in the body.)</end_of_turn
And from this vein is exuded in lumps which are about five palms and a thumb long, and I have already known of one that was twenty palms long.)</end_of_turn
And if it is discovered at the time of treatment, then introduce the needle into the marrow of the bone and pierce it along the length of the bone until all that is in the cavity is evacuated, and administer putrefying agents to the wound for several days with medicines; and finally care for the wound for the healing of ulcers.)</end_of_turn
And this vein often causes swelling, especially when it appears at the ankle or foot, and causes great pain, and is engendered of some ulcer or wound.)</end_of_turn
And therefore care for it as we have said above in the division and as regards what has been said.)</end_of_turn
It is called bovine gout when worms are generated under the skin and appear on the surface.)</end_of_turn
This disease is called bovine gout in every land and is called by us bovine disease because it does not appear among the common people, but is found between the flesh and bone, and spreads throughout the body, causing swelling of the limbs and deforming the bones, and is recognized by the sensation of swelling in the limbs until the bone is fractured and the marrow is expelled.)</end_of_turn
And the cause of this disease is the corruption of some humors as well as the appearance of worms and serpents and worms and scorpions in the belly.)</end_of_turn
And it is feared because of its malice, for when it enters the body and is elevated to the head, it causes great pain, and when it arrives it breaks the head and destroys the brain, and that is what causes the swelling.)</end_of_turn
Therefore when you want to cure it and extract it, you must not do so without having previously recognized its limb and its appearance, and when you see that it has become soft and flabby and has caused great swelling, and that there is strong stiffness and swelling around it, and that it is necessary to dry it up and extract it.)</end_of_turn
And if it is prolonged in the bone and you do not remove it, then you must place a cautery over the area until it stops, and the greatest cause of fear is the corruption of the bone as we have said.)</end_of_turn
May in such cases as these the patient be treated with great care and given stricture of diet, and dry up the area with a cautery, and extract the stone; and that the disease use its natural means of eliminating harmful humors, and take care of nourishment that does not generate putrefying matter.)</end_of_turn
From section over the gout.
This disease is called in our land nafir, and it is a pain that is seen in various limbs, and is usually transferred from limb to limb.)</end_of_turn
And I have already told you what I recommend concerning this.)</end_of_turn> I was called to a woman who was suffering from a disease at a village, and I saw that her arm was swollen and that there was a small swelling in the funis vein of the arm, and when I left an hour later, I saw that the swelling had disappeared just as quickly as it had appeared, as if it had never been there.)</end_of_turn
And then I put on the area of the pain and fixed it to the muscle, and then I stay here for an hour.
And then I proceed to the other side until I reach the other arm.</start_of_turn>
And then I recommend that you rotate the body as much as you see fit; and do not marvel at the movement of the limbs and the speed of the members.</start_of_turn I have already seen that in these matters according to that manner, however I have seen many who experience pain when the limbs are shifted from limb to limb.</start_of_turn They do not see that in the thighs like in the palm of the hand.</start_of_turn
And I do not think that this is anything other than that the thigh was old, where there are many bones and veins exposed, and in this there appears that sensation of violent movement.</start_of_turn
It is necessary that it does not appear according to this retrograde movement in those who are delicate and have humors full of veins obscured.</start_of_turn
And as you desire the care of them, and the patient has that pain, then do not be afraid of its appearance as we have said, but rather strengthen your hand over that area and leave it hanging and dry over that until the violent movement is calmed, and cauterize the area.</start_of_turn
If you do not see it in the thighs, when you care for it, know that it is the exudesion of the body and that which expels violence, and praise those who take those purulent pills and those of serapi and similar.</start_of_turn
From the extraction of arrows.</start_of_turn
Arrows are diversified according to the species, and according to the locations of the body in which they are cast, because their diversity is that some have great heads, and small, and concave, and blunt; so are solid; and those that have three angles, and those that have tongues; and those that have bars.</start_of_turn
And from the symptoms of the servant is when you catch the arrow in them, and it breaks their bones, that it is sitting on the cyst that is over the brain, because it causes them to be swollen with swelling, and spitting, and dizziness, and redness in the limbs, and inflammation and redness of the tongue, and spasms and confusion of understanding and vomiting of bile, and great strength is lost from the voice, and is destroyed from the place of the wound white moisture resembling slime, and becomes like the consistency of blood.</start_of_turn
And therefore if these symptoms appear to you, then you must abstain from the care and extraction of the arrow, if not outside.</start_of_turn
And the symptoms of the arrow when it catches in the heart, so that it is close to the left breast, and that it is fixed in a solid cause, and is not a frivolous cause; and that the movement of the arrow is similar to the movement of blood, and runs like black plague, and if it reaches that degree of coldness of the limbs, and excessive sweating, and fainting; and therefore you must know that death approaches immediately.</start_of_turn
And the symptoms when the arrow has pierced the lung are that it is almost filled with blood and that the veins that are under the chest are closed, and the color of the sickness is changed, and great breath is exhaled, and asks for fresh air.</start_of_turn
And if the arrow catches in the membrane that is in the heel, and the pain is that of the small vertebrae, and it causes great swelling with great pain and swelling, and does not move any of the muscles.</start_of_turn
And if the arrow catches in the stomach, then great strength is lost from the wound going on with any digestion.</start_of_turn
And if the arrow catches in the belly and is fixed there, no hope is left for the cure of the extraction of the arrow.</start_of_turn
If the arrow hits the bladder, and the urine is forced outside of it, and the cause of this is known to be outside, and there is great pain in the abdomen, it is clear that this is a mortal wound.
The other members also suffer in the same way as the face, the ear, the throat, the spleen, the testicles, the ribs, the breastbone, the shoulder, the arm, and the leg. They are saved only when the arrow does not hit a vein or artery and is not venomous.</end_of_turn>
I would recommend that you learn about the nature of these arrows, for it is a sign of your care for your health.</end_of_turn>
The cause of this is that in a healthy person an arrow was shot into the eye socket of the nose at the root of the nose, and I extracted it from the other side. I left the pupil of the eye untouched, and he is healthy and has not suffered any damage to his eye.</end_of_turn
And I extracted another arrow from a boy who had shot it into the gray of his eye socket. I left the eyelid untouched, and the arrow was already hidden, and we did not manage to remove it until a small piece of it adhered to the bone of the eyebrow. It was a great arrow of the sharp arrows of the Turks, with a lion’s head on it, without any pupil.</end_of_turn>
And thus the boy was healed, and has not suffered any damage to his eye.</end_of_turn
And I extracted another arrow from a Christian who had been shot in the throat. It was an Arabian arrow, and there were pupils in it. And when I inquired about it between two guides, I found that it had already sunk into the throat of the Christian. And I took it out cautiously, and the Christian was healed.</end_of_turn
And I extracted another arrow from a man who had been shot in the belly. I thought he would surely die from it. And when three days had passed and there was no improvement in his condition, I inquired about the arrow and found it. The man was healed, and he did not suffer any further damage.</end_of_turn
And there was another man in whom an arrow was shot into both legs, and the plague was confirmed on him. And when I approached to see him after seven days, I found the arrow at the root of the thigh.</end_of_turn
And there was a woman who had been shot with an arrow in the belly, and the plague was confirmed on her. And she has not improved in her condition even after remaining in bed for a long time, and she does not suffer from any natural ailments.</end_of_turn
And there was another man who had been shot with an arrow in the face, and the plague was confirmed on him. The arrow was removed, but no pain was felt, and his condition did not worsen.</end_of_turn
And I extracted the arrow from the princeps of the king who had been shot in the middle of his nose. The arrow had already begun to decline on the right side, and it was completely hidden.</end_of_turn
And I was called to attend to his care within three days of the arrow entering.</end_of_turn
And when I arrived I found the plague of the arrow not very severe; and when I asked about the cause of this, he did not feel any pain. However, he still felt a slight puncture mark at the root of the arrow, and I hoped that this was simply the mark of the arrow.</end_of_turn
I applied to him an ointment composed of an astringent and digestive virtue, confident that the wound would disappear as a result of my application, because I saw the tip of the arrow protruding from the wound.</end_of_turn
The wound did not suffer any significant damage from the arrow. I continued to apply the ointment to him for several days, and there was no further accident. The plague gradually disappeared, and the patient was cured of the pain caused by the arrow within a few days.
And when I had finished with the acute corrosive medicine, I waited for a while, and when I had finished with that I took hold of the tip of the arrow and pulled it out.</start_of_turn
I adjusted the dressing for the plague for that medicine, and when I saw the tip of the arrow clearly, I left it for a while.
When the plague had become more pronounced, I thought of removing the arrows myself with forceps. I delayed this, however, and continued to handle it with care for several days, until one day I managed to remove the arrow without causing further damage.
And some doctors judge that the cartilage of the nose is not restored, and when that is restored, the plague is solidified, and the patient is completely healed, and it does not return in him in any way.
And I recommend to you the quality of extraction of some needles so that you can pause what is customary and significant about what I have not said, because the parts of this art and the definitions of that are not comprehended by this narration or are not included in it.</end_of_turn>
And the learned artists compare little with the poor; and in what is present they are absent in what is lacking; and they find a new operation and a new instrument that must be descended from the external causes of the art when it occurs.</end_of_turn
Therefore I say that needles are not expelled from the members in which they are placed, but in two ways: either by attraction of the tissue in which they are entangled; or on the contrary of the other part.</end_of_turn
And that which is expelled from the tissue where it is introduced, or is a needle proceeding from a fleshy place, is thrown out and expelled.</end_of_turn
And if you do not obey this time of the day when the cat is castrated, the hour is over that you must leave it for a few days until the flesh that is around it is softened, and the attraction of it and its egress is relieved.</end_of_turn
Similarly, if it is pierced in bone and you do not obey this time, leave it for a few days and repeat that until the attraction and movement in each day is over, and it is expelled.</end_of_turn
And if you do not obey this time for almost a whole day, the hour covers that you perforate in the circuit of the needle in that bone of the whole part with a soft touch until the tissue is enlarged by the needle, and then extract that.</end_of_turn>
Maybe if the needle is already hidden in the body, and is hidden from the feeling, the hour inquires about that and if you sit down, the hour pulls that which is convenient for the attraction of it.</end_of_turn
And if you cannot do it because of the constriction of the plague and the length of the period, and here it is neither bone nor nerve nor vein, the hour finishes concerning the plague until it is amplified and the needle can be extracted.</end_of_turn
And if you have something to do with those which are tenacious, the hour delivers the flesh in which it is pierced throughout the whole part with all the skill you can; and think about it, if you cannot do about the escape of the flesh in the fracture of the nails and in twisting those until you obey.</end_of_turn
And when you administer the extraction of the needle in any place, the hour uses with all its might both its hand and forceps until it makes that obey; and suggest that with great care that the needle is not broken and that it is effectively pulled out by your difficult attraction and extraction.</end_of_turn
And if you cannot do that of your hour, the hour leaves for a few days until the parts that are in the circuit of it are softened, and then repeat that until the hour is relieved.</end_of_turn Maybe if your work contradicts the flow of salvation, the hour administers what we have said of care in the head.</end_of_turn
And keep your prudence from the knowledge of veins or nerves or strings, and administer skill in every way possible to facilitate the escape of the needle; and do that with facility and tranquility and tardiness and calmness as I and you have recommended.</end_of_turn
Therefore you must counteract the needle so that the illness is according to the figure according to which you must treat the case of the needle in it, for that is more beneficial.</end_of_turn May it be so, if it is not possible for you, then administer whatever is possible for the figures.
But if the arrows that are outside are opposed by the other side, or that already from these has proceeded any side to the sides outside, or makes the limb stiff; then you should cut off the limb below the knee and sometimes above; and do so according to the quantity in which the forceps take hold; and then draw out that which is fayta with the cautery.</end_of_turn>
But if it is retained in the bone, then you should twist the limb according to the hardness of the bone until the arrow breaks against the bone, and expand it to the middle, and then extract that.</end_of_turn
And if not, leave it there for a few days, and then repeat it until it comes out.</end_of_turn>
And if the blood of the arrow is in that, then you must prick that with your finger.</end_of_turn
But if the blood is clotted and you wish to administer an impulse, then you must insert the finger and that, if it is blind, touch the cavity so that between the cavity of the limb and the base of the arrow, and then prick that with your finger.</end_of_turn
But if the arrow is concave, then you must prick that with your finger inwards, because the arrow is relieved by that.</end_of_turn
And if the arrow is poisonous, then you must cover all the flesh in which it is seen, if it is possible with water, and then care for that with water that you consider convenient.</end_of_turn
And if the arrow catches in the foot, or in the belly, or in the bladder, or in the side, and is close to so that you can touch it with your finger, and it is possible to cut off above that, then cut off above that and keep yourself away from veins or nerves, and extract that, and then compress it if necessary, and care for that until it is healed.</end_of_turn
Form of forceps with which the arrows are drawn:
Their ends are like the beak of a sparrow that are faytas like a saw when they take hold of the arrow so that it does not slip.</end_of_turn
And these are of various sizes, large, small and medium, according to the quantity of the greatness of the arrow and the scarcity of the wound, and the breadth of the wound, and the constriction of it.</end_of_turn
like a ray so that the inner part of the arrow in the concave one is relieved and is pushed inwards.</start_of_turn
Of venipuncture.</start_of_turn
The veins from which it is usually bled are those of the forearm or the leg.</start_of_turn of which there are sixteen in the head.</start_of_turn so there are two pulse veins that are close to the wrists, which are called albas; two herbs that are in the two temples that appear; and two veins in two tear ducts of two holes that are called aspicient; and the vein prepared in the middle of the face, and the vein that is in the extremity of the nose; and two guide veins that are at the collarbone; and two veins that are in the lips above; and two veins that are in the lips below; and these are the veins that are called algelic; and there are two veins that are below the tongue.</start_of_turn But the veins that are bled in the arms are worth five.</start_of_turn because there is a cephalic one, which is the most lateral one; and the people call “the head vein”, and it is blind, and is a medium vein, and is composed of a branch of the basilica, and of another branch of the cephalic; and they call that “the vein of all the body”, and basilica is a vein that is formed in the domestic belly, and is called “citillar”, and they call that “the belly vein” among the vulgar; and the funis of the arm, and is formed over the elbow, and that is the one that is bled, and is that which appears over the elbow for appearance.</start_of_turn
And in the foot and the ankle there are three veins; one of which is that which is below the curvature of the little toe of the lateral side; and the second is soft, and its place is below the ankle of the domestic side; and the sciatic vein, and its place is below the ankle of the lateral side; and in the ankle there are other veins similar to those.</start_of_turn
The support of the veins that are close to the ankles is due to catarrh of the ancient times, emigration, suppuration and ulcers of the head from ancient times.
And as for the quality of the bleeding in these cases, I recommend that you do this: let the patient raise their head above the level of the illness, and let the head of the patient be slightly lower than the ankles at the level of the veins that are close to the ankles; then tighten the patient's clothing around them with a bandage that will cover the two areas where the veins are wide open; and if you want to know whether this is enough, ask the patient if they feel the pain diminishing.
Then take the pointed lancet, and that which is most penetrating, and put your finger into that vein in the groin where the phlebitis comes out to the bone. And raise your hand over the vein and the groin to the sides and puncture the vein at the start of the incision And the length of the incision is the quantity of two fingers adjusted or around that; do as much as you like of the blessing.</start_of_turn>
And tighten around it with powder and leave that which is inside so that it is healed.</start_of_turn>
And indeed, before doing anything else, make the incision of these and cauterize them.</start_of_turn>
More than the two veins that are at the temples which help with phlebitis is an ancient emigration of bad blood and congestion of the veins and tumors of excess fluid in the heels.</start_of_turn
And as for the quality of phlebitis in these cases, I recommend that you do this: tighten the patient's clothing around them with a bandage that will cover the two veins when they are clearly visible and feel the pain diminish; and if you ask them if they feel the pain diminishing, they will tell you.</start_of_turn
And raise the groin over the vein to the sides as I have told you, and make the phlebitis incision from the outside inwards, and raise the vein up; and puncture it as you have done with the other two veins; and do as much of the blessing as you need.</start_of_turn
And remove the covering of the patient, and leave your hand over the vein for an hour, and then place your hand over that cover and powder and tighten that around them strongly, and leave that which is inside so that it is healed.</start_of_turn
And indeed, the memory of these things has already passed, and the incision and the attraction in the beginning of the freedom.</start_of_turn
And therefore the support of the phlebitis of the vein of the forehead is close to the phlebitis of the cephalic vein to the ancient maladies of the face and to emigration, swelling and ulcers of pus.</start_of_turn
And as for the quality of the phlebitis in these cases, I recommend that you do this: let the patient tighten their clothing around them with a bandage that will make the vein visible; and take the instrument called forceps of which this is the shape.</start_of_turn
Pause the puncture at the peak which is at the head of the forceps over that vein and pierce it either forwards or backwards in the manner of doing so, and let the blood run out as much as you wish; and then remove the perforation of the patient and tighten that which is inside so that it is healed.</start_of_turn
Every vein which is opened with phlebitis is usually opened with a broad incision, but it does not mean that the phlebitis is of acute extremity as well as the others; for it may be of remote extremity, and phlebitis which is according to the traverse, because the bone is very close and strong in it when it is slight.</start_of_turn
More support is given by the two veins that are at the tears of two heels for scabby discharge of the heel for swelling and pus in the heel, and to the maladies of the face.</start_of_turn
And the quality of the phlebitis is that the patient tightens their clothing around them with a bandage, and you remain standing over their head.</start_of_turn
And the phlebitis is successful according to the traverse from a little distance to a little distance, for in the place it is not solid; and if the phlebitis is slight, the limb is fractured.</start_of_turn
And do as much of the blessing as you need, and leave your hand over that area for a night, and tighten those tightly again, and remove those.</start_of_turn
More the phlebitis of the vein of the nose is with acute fever and violent sweating, and to the maladies of the face and emigration and swelling that happen in the face, and especially when it is ancient.</start_of_turn
The quality of the flebotomy of the patient is that the patient groans with pain and places his hand on my left hand, and I take a subtle flebotomy that lasts a long time and remains in the middle of the nose according to the rule, so that the vein does not appear to the sense here, and that the blood begins to flow immediately.
Since you have finished with the flebotomy little by little, make the blood flow according to your need; and keep that up for a night, for that is restored with delight.</end_of_turn>
More useful is the flebotomy of the two veins to constrict urine and the commencement of leprosy and spots of illness, and itch and harmful ulcers corrosive just as if it were herpes.</end_of_turn>
And the quality of the flebotomy of these is that the patient groans with pain and leaves something in his bowels along with the ligament; and stay the artisans over the head of the patient, and the patient sits on a stool.</end_of_turn
And do the flebotomy of the vein along with the wide flebotomy little by little; and extract blood according to a temperate quantity or according to how many times it is necessary that is at the same time; and make it similar to the other vein.</end_of_turn
And then remove the ligament and tighten the two veins somewhat more so that the patient is not provoked, and leave it inside until the swelling is healed.</end_of_turn>
And the benefit of the flebotomy of the veins is to relieve small boils and pimples of the mouth and corruption of the gums and bad ulcers and fissures, and to bad ulcers that are in the nose and in the throat.</end_of_turn
And the quality of the flebotomy of these is that you will make the patient groan in front of you, and tighten his bowels with a bandage, and then rotate his lips and close two veins of which one is from the right lip and the other from the left; and the demonstration of each one is for the blackness of each of both, and more so when in the circuit of these two veins there are many small black veins; and where it incides is as it incides.</end_of_turn>
If you doubt about something, leave it to me, and do not know which of these to choose, when you understand the incision of the greater of these, and the pus manifests of these.</end_of_turn
And make it similar to the two veins that are in the lips outside.</end_of_turn
More useful are two veins than the left ones is the flebotomy of the cephalic vein to prevent affections that are in the gullet, to the illness of the uvula, and to the illness of the mouth.</end_of_turn
And the quality of bleeding these is that it follows the patient between his teeth before he spits out the blood, and raises the tongue, and leave the tongue from one side of the vein and from the other side of the vein, and the color of each one is declining towards black.</end_of_turn
And then bleed each one; and take care that you do not touch the vein with your hand, because it is an artery.</end_of_turn
And the veins which are bled in this wound are those which usually run in all men, and the flebotomy of them is useful in two ways, or one can make a superficial incision or by cutting at a moderate distance; or by cutting deeply, and if there is anything in the wound, and this is the way to do it.</end_of_turn
Both sides of the vein are like this when it is necessary, and you must open the apparent large veins that contain thick blood.</end_of_turn
This flebotomy is of less breadth and of deeper extent, and you must bleed small veins that contain thin blood.</end_of_turn
More useful is the flebotomy of the basilica vein which is one of the three veins: which extracts the blood from the affections that are left in the gullet and the belly, and from what is left of the feet and the belly.</end_of_turn
And you must order the phlebotomist, when he does that, that he should take care of that and be more temperate in that, because if he does not he will pierce the artery and will cause the blood to flow, so that you must not phlebotomize that way, but rather by cutting as before.</end_of_turn
If the swelling does not appear visibly, then lay aside that limb and move to the other, or seek some other limb; or that you may find the swelling at the end of the arm, which is also evident; then cut away that part which is swollen just as we have said.
If you wish to perform a lithotomy of the limb, then first loosen the bandage that is touching the area inside the limb, and then place a bandage over it firmly; and then tie the limb and cut the vein where it is swollen just as we have said; and keep pressure on the area until the bleeding stops.</end_of_turn>
And when you see, as you have stretched the ligament, swelling in the place that you have marked with a bandage, then that swelling is swelling of the artery, and therefore avoid that.</end_of_turn>
And if sometimes during the lithotomy you see urine flowing like that of a child, then the urine is yellow, which is a sign that it is the urine of the artery; and therefore you must stop and pause the bleeding for a long time; and then take hold of the bleeding again, and if the bleeding is stopped, which means that the clot has been separated, then strengthen the limb and leave it alone.</end_of_turn>
And take care of the patient's urine, and be over-cautious with it, and do not leave it for a long time until it is healed.</end_of_turn>
If the bleeding has not been stopped, and sometimes even when you do not find a doctor there, then you must ligate the artery if you see it; for the limb is contracted, and the clot is separated; or that you take a short forceps, grasp that, and press that over the area of the vein where there is a constriction of the ligament and the powder within until the next day.</end_of_turn
If the clot is separated, it is well; otherwise, care for that which precedes the recollection of the place of the separated clots until the flow of urine returns to normal.</end_of_turn
The separation of the artery is difficult in many situations because of the small size of the wound and the possibility of injury to the limb's ligament.</end_of_turn>
More importantly, the lithotomy is useful in extracting the stone from the upper part of the bladder and from the lower part of the body; for it is composed of the branches of the basilica and the branches of the cephalic artery, as we have said.</end_of_turn
Take care of the lithotomist who is over-cautious during the lithotomy, for there is a nerve there; and if you prick the lithotomy and damage the nerve, you will cause him to lose sensation, and it will be difficult to heal him, and often it is not possible to heal him completely.  This nerve is often hidden from view by fat and is almost invisible; and if it is covered by someone who is not skilled and is subtle and does not show, then you must stop the lithotomy at the point where you see the bleeding, and avoid the nerve with your strength.</end_of_turn
If the vein is between two nerves, then you must cut the vein lengthwise.</end_of_turn
The advantage of lithotomy of the cephalic vein is that it extracts the stone from the head and relieves the suffering of the heels.</end_of_turn
And in this way, if you wish, the lithotomy can be performed through the flank or through the groin; for this is the safest way of all, for neither the artery nor the nerve is left injured.</end_of_turn
It is often forgotten in some people, when it is not found at the first percussion, but it is not neglected in the present case.</end_of_turn
The first of these is that lithotomy is not administered except in the preservation of health and in hope of its success and caution against the occurrence of diseases, and that it is useful lithotomy in one of the veins that is in the groin, that is: cephalic, femoral or basilica; and that it is useful lithotomy at the beginning of spring, after sunrise in the morning and in autumn in the evening, and in winter when there are signs of repletion.</end_of_turn
And it is useful to lithotomize every third day or the first after sunrise, for three hours have passed by.</end_of_turn
May the flebotomy be administered promptly, for it is more effective when it causes convenience and necessity at any time of the day or night.
And let it be known that it should not be performed too soon after the fourteenth year, and that in women it should not be performed before the seventh month after delivery, and in the old it should not be performed at all.</end_of_turn>
And when someone wishes to be bled for any reason whatsoever, let them modify their veins beforehand with a lion's clisteer, if there is any retained wound, so that the veins do not pull out the superfluous humors during the bleeding of the veins, which are pressed, and do not harm the principal members.</end_of_turn>
And let them not be bled when they are suffering from sacred fever or cramps, or from an evil disease or from dropsy, until such time as the cause of their suffering has disappeared, neither from fever nor from excessive vomiting, or from excessive drinking or from a multitude of journeys or works or from excessive fasting or from any other cause that dissolves virtue, or be it bodily or spiritual.</end_of_turn
And consider carefully the temperament of humors before bleeding, if the patient is robust with food and drink, and with medicines if possible.</end_of_turn
And let them go into the bath if any cause does not prohibit it, or be exercised by any exercise so that the patient be benefited.</end_of_turn
And stop the bleeding at the third hour of the day, as we have said.</end_of_turn>
And know that the limb should be guarded on that day from all animal accidents, as from fear, wrath, fear, and from all bodily accidents, from work and excessive drinking and journeys and from every other cause.</end_of_turn
And as for the scent, let the cause be present with the patient in accordance with the habits of men, with aromatic substances and perfumes and balms and scents according to the extent of the possibility.</end_of_turn
And follow the blederer with a cushion that is softer than the cushion of that which must be bled.</end_of_turn
And pull out their arms, and anoint the bleeding area with their hand two or three times; and then tie the dressing with a cord and cover the area with two or three layers.</end_of_turn
And let the restriction be temperate, neither too tight nor too loose, for the restriction when it is excessive prohibits the flow of blood; or when it is too loose, the patient will suffer pain.
And when the restriction is applied, let the patient rub their hands together between them until the veins become swollen, and declare it when feeling comfortable.</end_of_turn
And let the bleeder anoint the bleeding limb with a little oil beforehand; and let them pause the hand indicating the vein from which the bleeding will be performed, so that the vein flees a little, and the percussion is dry so that there is no air in the vein which is being bled from, which is what causes swelling when the bleeding is stopped; and if the bleeding opens the vein, that is stretched.</end_of_turn
Therefore, in order that the bleeding be stopped and be cured in all these things.</end_of_turn>
And let them stop the bleeding immediately even if the vein is torn in a moment; for if not, you must repeat the procedure leaving that place a little while, or perform festination if the place is not clotted.</end_of_turn
And if the place is clotted, or the disease spreads, let you leave it alone for a day or two, and do not tighten the dressing, for it will cause fresh bruising, or do not enter the bath.</end_of_turn
And repeat the bleeding if necessary.</end_of_turn
And if the opening is small and the blood stops well, and you fear that it will not suffice, let you repeat the bleeding in that place according to custom and adjust the opening a little, and do what is necessary so that the place is clotted, for the place is clotted in many people in the event of a small opening.</end_of_turn
More often, however, if that has already clotted, do not repeat over it, for that will not be of any use; and pause over the remainder of the wound with oil, which will relieve the pain of the patient.</end_of_turn It is better in this place than outside and than the other places.
Therefore, apply ointment of oil throughout the wound and tie the veins that are beyond the limit of the cure, for it makes the tyriaca softer and safer when one of them is taken away from the place, because the cure is subtle and is reversed when it is large.</end_of_turn>
And if there is great swelling in the wound, which causes blood clots to adhere, especially in the one that has not bled, or in the opening of the small vein, then you should cover it, and place over the place a sponge soaked in water and salt, a little scorched, and hold it there for an hour, because it is dissolved.</end_of_turn
And cover that with the surrounding skin of the vein along with it or another vein.</end_of_turn>
And if you remain in the place for several days, there will be some blackness or greenness; do not notice that. If you wish, place over the cause of the pain some dissolvent of aloes or marigold, or some cause of the juice of chamomile or buttercup or something like that.</end_of_turn>
Blood clots adhere to swelling caused by wound healing of the basilica.</end_of_turn>
Therefore place your hand over that, and if you find pain, tighten your compression over that; for that swelling is harmful and bad. And so keep that you put over that any cause of that which we have said, for it will flow strongly from the sacred artery.</end_of_turn
And apply ointment with oil that is astringent, so that the place is hardened, and take care of the other care along with this until it is healed.</end_of_turn
And cover that you extract from the sacred at all times according to the quantity of its virtue and according to the color of the wound over the sacred according as it appears.</end_of_turn
For if the sacred is black, then you must leave it still until it is cured; and in the same way if you see it large, then you must leave it still until it is subtle; and in the same way if it is acute, until its intensity is gone.</end_of_turn
And cover whoever is full and strong and has need of extracting the sacred in a wound, that the wound of the vein be widened and that it bleed laterally.</end_of_turn
And in the one who is pale, do the opposite of that, and cover that you extract it in small numbers, and that he take it directly.</end_of_turn
It is better to administer in the wound of the vein that it is the transverse section, not the puncture.</end_of_turn
This method of wound healing is saved from the flow of blood and the injury of nerves, and is more laudable and more safe than the wound healing according to breadth and length.</end_of_turn
And to which it is customary to succeed without fainting, you must do the wound healing with a little piece of bread infused in wine of a thousand grains or of simple alum. Extract it three or four times.</end_of_turn
And if it is a cold wound, then before doing the wound healing, prepare with eyewater of marigold or with eyewater of honey flavored with spices such as cinnamon, ginger and the like, or with scented and fragrant eyewater.</end_of_turn
And if fainting occurs, do the wound healing, for it is a cause of that lack of blood. Therefore cover that you give him lukewarm wine and fragrant eyewater; and use aromatic substances with some kind of food, and keep the feet of the patient at that level.</end_of_turn
And use the other causes that we have said in the division of fainting for evacuation.</end_of_turn
And whoever wants to see the result of the wound healing and dissolve the sacred according to the number, cover that from which the wound healing is for the evacuation of blood, and the virtue of it is cold, which evacuates the blood little by little, as much as the quantity of the virtue in the continuous days.</end_of_turn
May whoever wants to see the result of the wound healing and dissolve the sacred according to age, and the patient's body is strong, then make the first wound healing approximately seven or eight hours after the first wound healing.</end_of_turn
May whoever wants to extract the blood from the body contrary to the departure that it declines, cover that it happens on the second or third day.</end_of_turn
May whoever in the body where there is no blood left is acute and causes fever, cover that you extract the blood from it once and extract a great amount of it, and amplify the opening until fainting occurs, for in this way you will have preserved all the conditions of wound healing; and that you place your hand over the area over which you must extract the blood, because if you do not do this, death may occur in place of fainting, for there are many who are ignorant and negligent when they are wound healers.</end_of_turn
And do not be hasty when you wish to draw out the arm and discharge the urine, for the orifice of the vein is already closed, and it is difficult to expel the urine, because you must anticipate that great pain lies ahead, and that the extension of the urine is prolonged, which is too bad.
Hence the patient lies prone, because of the swelling according to the acute; or remain there with the sharpness of the swelling which is the coagulation of the urine in the orifice of the vein; or suspend treatment on that of mercury or saffron, and apply that which is lighter within until the urine comes out and settles.
And if the vein is congested, then leave it alone and do not touch it until the congestion has subsided.</end_of_turn>
And if it is necessary for you to evacuate the urine according to the need, and it is not excused, then place your hand on that part or in the other arm in another vein.</end_of_turn>
And the vein which is called the “funis of the arm” is swollen in the place of the flesh or the bone, when it is not grasped or hidden, because it is composed of those.</end_of_turn
The quality of the swelling of these is that the patient introduces his hand into cold water until the heat has receded, and the vein becomes clearly visible.</end_of_turn
Then strengthen that ligament and that stricture slightly; and swell the swelling according to the small transverse, not longitudinally or along the length.</end_of_turn
And let the opening be wide and your swelling be such that you can swell that over the wrist joint a little.</end_of_turn
And if the flow of the urine is prohibited, then repeat the hand in cold water and let the urine run in the water until you have achieved your need.</end_of_turn
More so if you are in the summer days, for in that case you are excused from the repetition of the hand in cold water, and the more so is the maintenance of the body of the urine in cold water in winter.</end_of_turn>
And the swelling of this vein is more useful than all the others, for it has neither a pulsating vein nor nerves.</end_of_turn
And the swelling of the wrist is related to the diseases of the fetus.</end_of_turn
The quality of the swelling of these is that you strengthen the hand with the ligament or with your hand, because you have put it in cold water, until the vein is swollen and is clearly visible at the same time; and swell that which is transverse; and if you do this to the whole it will not do any harm.</end_of_turn
And take care not to touch your hand to the swelling, for you leave its nerves naked of flesh.</end_of_turn
And repeat the hand in cold water and let the urine run in that, for if you do not repeat it in cold water, the urine will coagulate in the orifice of the vein, and it is prohibited to flow.</end_of_turn
And when the urine is extracted according to the quantity of need, then you pause over the vein oil and salt, so that it is not solidified too firmly; and keep pressing that you make a circle around all around.</end_of_turn
More useful is the swelling of the left hand, for it is related to the diseases of the belly.</end_of_turn
And do the same with the swelling of this vein as you have done with the other.</end_of_turn
The benefit of the ascending vein from the swelling is for the diseases which are in the lower part of the body, as well as diseases of the mother, and retention of menstruation, and the diseases of the veins and ulcers of the buttocks and old ulcers, and for their similar diseases.</end_of_turn
The quality of the swelling of these is that the patient puts all his foot in cold water and makes over that friction until the veins become apparent; and he ties over the wrist joint with a bandage; and the part of the vein that appears must be grasped by the thumb and the four fingers.</end_of_turn
Therefore swell it up more widely or leave the bandage over the thumb and the four fingers; for this is better and more salt.</end_of_turn
And if you swell that in the face of the foot, then you must guard the nerves that are left over that on the face of the foot, and suspend your swelling with that which you swell by the transverse, as if you were inciting it.</end_of_turn
The wound is severe.
Maybe if it is forbidden to immerse the limb in the cold water, you may bathe the foot in warm water and let the medicine run out through the opening that has been made
If the surgeon has made an error in the first attempt, then repeat the process a little further from the wound, where the tissue is solid; and do not fear the infection, but take care of the nerves as we have said
And in the same way do the same thing to the other foot as well
And concerning the sciatic nerve, as we have said, you must cut off the supply of the hairy part of the limb.
The support of the wound is to make an opening when it is for the healing of the burn.
The quality of the wound is that the patient should be bathed, and that the limb should be bound tight from the groin downwards to the ankle with a long strip of silk, which should not be seen except for the part that is inside the wound
And thus when it appears, repeat the process as often as necessary according to the situation and the direction, and it is better; or if you wish, you can make an incision or excision, because the tissue is solid
And it is in most homes not so bad; and if you find it like this, and it does not appear to be painful, then repeat the process with any limb, and that is the one that appears in the two feet beyond the thumb and the little finger
Take care of the nerves, and let the medicine run out as much as you wish
Then remove the tension and place your hand over the area of the wound to strengthen the limb, because the patient is cured.
From the instructions and qualities of the physicians.
The physicians are of corn, or of barley, or of ivy
The treatment is done in two ways: one is by scarification and extraction of matter, and the other is by means of a scraping
And this scraping that is called scarification is done in two ways, either with fire or without fire
And the wounds that are treated by scarification and extraction of matter are fourteen parts of the body, of which the first is the nail, which is at the end of the thumb; and the second part is the heel of the foot; and the third part is the area between the chin and the jaw; and the fourth part is the area from the eyebrows to the nose; and the fifth part is the area from the armpits to the navel; and the sixth part is the area from the nipples to the groin; and the seventh part is the area from the buttocks to the knees; and the eighth part is the area from the ankles to the toes; and the ninth part is the area from the wrist to the elbow; and the tenth part is the area from the elbow to the shoulder; and the eleventh part is the area from the knee to the thigh; and the twelfth part is the area from the hip to the buttocks; and the thirteenth part is the area from the ankle to the calf; and the fourteenth part is the area from the thigh to the hip
Do not extract matter from the great veins that are spread throughout the flesh, because this does not have the power to heal these wounds; neither should the scraping be done with fire in any disease that requires evacuation of the entire body.
If necessary, repeat the scraping at the beginning and at the end of the month, and in the middle of the month and at any other time.
And therefore, whenever in any of these cases, and especially if it is in the third or middle of the month, when it has passed two or three hours since the scraping was performed, it is ordered to repeat the scraping
The support of the scraping of the nape is that when it is exposed to gravity in the head and to the liquid that is falling from the limbs; however, do not evacuate the entire body
This scraping is for the wound of the scalp.
He is not worthy to handle them who is suffering from complete frigidity or catarrh, for he gives rise to that great document.
Therefore it is not permissible for them to use those old women, and in the heads of whom there are diseases of the cold kind.</end_of_turn>
More deserving of him are those who are continuing with him on his journey; therefore command the attendant to place his hand with a little pressure on the windward side of his heels, fearing the generation of oblivion.
Better is the blowing of the aleckhel than the phlebotomy of the veins of the groin and the bladder: and for this reason we give praise to asthma, and to constriction of the belly and scissura of the spasm of the belly, and cough, and distension.</end_of_turn>
And we must command the blowing of the aleckhel to be slight, for if it is stopped, it generates weakness in the body and in the stomach.</end_of_turn>
And the blowing of the ambergdahan gives praise to headaches and ophthalmia, and diarrhea, and pain in the roots of the teeth; and it is better than phlebotomy of the spleen.</end_of_turn>
And command the attendant not to put his hand too deep in scarification, for he will cause the artery to bleed and blood to flow freely.</end_of_turn
And the blowing of the heels will cause discomfort in the mouth, and corruption of the gums, and a likeness to their diseases that are in the mouth, and is better than phlebotomy of the alimentary canal that is in the two lips.</end_of_turn
Better is the blowing which is made on the two spatulas for catching, which is useful for filling with warmth.</end_of_turn>
And the blowing of the two heels from under the ribs gives joint help with the phlebotomy of three veins, that is of the bladder, groin and head, for those which follow will give blood to all the veins more numerous than those which are in the belly, and those smaller veins which are among the greater ones until the attraction reaches the three veins.</end_of_turn
And command the attendant not to proceed too far in scarification, for his location is denuded of flesh, and leaves him nerves and arteries.</end_of_turn
And this is a blowing which is made over the cushions and gives praise to the hemorrhoids of the buttocks and to the ulcers below the heels.</end_of_turn
And we must command the attendant to make a great blowing, and that it be from afar, for his location does not digest a strong section; and strong blows are to be taken with slight scarification.</end_of_turn
Better are the blows of the palms than a superficial manifestation, for they take away the blood of the whole body, and give praise to the old pains of the tonsils and the great vein, and the bladder; and cause the menstruation, and give praise to vomiting and diarrhea; and are better than phlebotomy of two superficial veins, and swelling, and two cavernous veins.</end_of_turn
However, do not neglect all the body and make them faint in many men.</end_of_turn>
And the blowing of vomiting is of great help with the blowing of the two palms.
The quality of the position of the blows is that you pause the starting blow and subsequent blows until a temperate succus has taken place, and do not prolong the position of the blows, but rather pause them leisurely, and resume them cautiously, and that the humors reach the place immediately for advancement.</end_of_turn> And do not cease until you see the place already swell and expand and that the color of the blood appears.</end_of_turn
And when you have finished your scarification, repeat the succus little by little, and consider in the condition of the body.</end_of_turn
For that man who has tender flesh of rare pores, command that you make him a single scar and do not do it again, for his location is not to be ulcerated.</end_of_turn
And command the attendant to enlarge the scarification and make a little wound, and hold the succus easily.</end_of_turn
And if there is thickness in the blood, then command that you make two incisions, for in the first incision the passage of the subtiliation to the blood and the moisture of it is opened.</end_of_turn And in the second one the acquisition of the extraction of the thick blood.</end_of_turn>
And if the blood is not thick, then command that you make a third incision so that you can achieve the fourth degree.</end_of_turn
And finally, when we want to extract the stone piece by piece or a small one, we should make an incision.
And finally, when we want to extract the stone piece by piece or a small one, we should make an incision. And if we know that the stone is large, we should make a larger incision.</end_of_turn>
And the extent of the incision is only as deep as the depth of the wound.</end_of_turn>
And if the wound is large, hard, tough, and has severe itching, cover the edges of the wound with soft substances; in summer, thus with aloe oil or violet oil, or almond oil, or poppyseed oil; and in winter, thus with olive oil, or lily oil, or chamomile oil, or mastic oil.</end_of_turn
And if there is a large, fleshy swelling, put on olive oil either bitter, or balsamite oil, or aloe oil, or pennyroyal oil, and so on.</end_of_turn
Moreover, if the patient has wide-ranging tender swelling, it is forbidden to apply oil, but rather to wash the area of the swelling with vinegar or cold water, or with rose water, or with chamomile water, or with wormwood water, and so on.</end_of_turn
And if the stone is moist, wash the wound with vinegar or water of mint, sumac, and the like.</end_of_turn
And if the swelling is large, wash the wound with strong vinegar or water of fennel, which is greater, or of elderberry, or of chamomile, and so on.</end_of_turn
And keep the wound covered until the bath; because it must be administered immediately after the bath for an hour or two, and keep the wound covered.</end_of_turn
What should be done to return the blood from the phlebotomy before the incision?
Consider at the outset: if the patient is bilious and has acute pain and inflammation of the stone, it is necessary to prevent cold causes, such as vinegar and urine, and fat, lead, radish, and chamomile, and the like.</end_of_turn
And suspend their food thus as poultry, lean meats, boiled vegetables with vinegar, and other bitter foods.</end_of_turn
And if the patient is feverish, it is necessary to prevent the ingestion of vinegar, almond milk, or buttermilk of poppyseed, and fragrant herbs between meals; and it is recommended that they should drink little and eat sparingly, and abstain from poultry, meat, fish, eggs, and legumes.</end>
And the drink should be greater than the food on the day of the incision and the phlebotomy.</end>
And it is necessary to remain in bed for several hours after breakfast, either with laxatives such as rhubarb or medicinal powders such as musk or alum, before or during the incision or phlebotomy, so that the main limbs are comforted and the stone is softened; and do not take enemas.</end_turn>
And the incisions that are made must be in the parts where the pain is, on the abdomen and ankle, on the navel, and in the groin, because these parts do not suffer from the incision.</end_turn
And it is not desired for these except for the attraction of the stone from the limb, as when the wound opens up on a swelling of the limb caused by the flow of the stone from the stone of the nerves; and use this to dissolve the cold freeness of the limb, as when it opens up on the abdomen and the navel; because that will make the limb limp and cause the pain to disappear that resolves the freeness.</end_turn
And it is already mentioned when the stone comes out in its operation or by force, because by its attraction it brings together the soft parts of the wound and expels the pus from its place.</end_turn
Similarly, when it is mentioned above with regard to the abdomen and ankle, the freeness of the wound must be treated in those enclosed areas.</end_turn
These incisions are administered without any other support, except for some herbs that are administered with fire.</end_turn><end_turn>
And some herbs are administered filled with cold water in the abdominal diseases.</end_turn
And this is because the incision should be full and large, so it is only cold water or water in which the appropriate herbs have been boiled.</end_turn
Form of wind administered with fire: the breadth of the orifice of two fingers, as we have formed it; and the quantity of resin is half of a palm; and be at the sides of it, in the area that is in the circumference, half of it, the thread be small according to the quantity that enters it a needle.
Whether of egg yolk or lemon, of orange marges, lion, walnuts and almonds for so that it does not damage the limb its position over it.
And let the middle of it be a transverse scar of egg or iron, where a candle is held over the fire
And already this wind is greater than the one we recommended; and the little more of that according to the ailments and the state of that one who uses it
And the winds of the ancients are extended so that others are more than the winds of the young and of great stature.
And the quality of making this wind with fire over the limb is that you extend the flame with fire of wood conveniently giving a little candle of wax, and you place that over the middle of the transverse scar in the middle of the wind, so that the fire is kindled around the outside so that it does not burn the body of the patient.</start_of_turn>
And so let it be paused over the limb of the patient, and the thumb be said about the thread that we have said, until when we have the winds and we do not indicate that they should stop and that it escapes the vapor over that thread, the hour the wind will be so much dissolved.</start_of_turn
And thus ignite the flame according to its manner, and repeat that if you indicate that you have finished with that.</start_of_turn>
More in the wind that is administered in the disease of gout, with water, in which there is no transverse scar or thread, and is not administered but is filled with water, and is placed over the limb only.</start_of_turn
And this is its form: The greater this wind is, the better, because it receives a great quantity of water.</start_of_turn
End of text.
Blood does not administer in many members but in the limbs in which it is not possible to position winds, because of the smallness of those, thus as well as the thumb and little finger and similar; or in limb denuded of flesh, thus as well as the nose and lip and during similar.</start_of_turn
And the quality of using those that if you have found blood that is in the deep parts of the body.</start_of_turn
And so let them be left lying down and at night in deep water until they are faint; and that no cause remain in the belly of those; and let the body be evacuated at the beginning with a forceps and with winds; and let the limb of the patient be cooled down until it turns red; and let them be paused over it.</start_of_turn
And when they are full and the case is over.</start_of_turn
And if it is possible to drain the cavity with the wind, it is better later in treatment.</start_of_turn
And if not, the hour lava the cavity with warm water and let some more water; and let it be wet and squeezed out.</start_of_turn
And if the course of the disease is prolonged along with the bleeding, and what remains is that, the hour you put in a sponge of lead in cold water, and pause that one from above until the secretion is opened.</start_of_turn
And if the disease is multiplied, the hour you sprinkle over it powdered vitriol, or urine and similar to their pestilential causes, until the disease is evacuated; or that you pause over the area the greater masses of scraped honey, and that you leave them until the honey sticks to the area, and that is the disease evacuated.</start_of_turn
And if necessary, repeat the bleeding, when it is possible to change those.</start_of_turn
And if the bleedings are prohibited of suspension, the hour let the area be wet with recent disease or leave a needle in the places until the disease goes away; and so let them be paused, because those when they feel any disease will be so much better.</start_of_turn
And when you want them to stop, sprinkle over those a little of ground aloe, or salt, or ash, and cover them all.</start_of_turn
Thus ends the third part: restoration.</start_of_turn This chapter is very useful necessary in the art of medicine; and is the restoration of fracture and dislocation of the bones.</start_of_turn
O, son, understand that doctors, vulgarians and those who at some time do not heed the elders or read those things, will scoff at this chapter.
And for this reason it is fitting that this madness of the learned in our land is private; and I have never forgotten it at any time in all my life; and I have not omitted it from this work, except for the length of reading the works of the elders and studying their understanding of them, until I had extracted the science from them.</end_of_turn>
And I add to this experiments and studies throughout my life.</end_of_turn>
And I have already described in this chapter all that concerns my science and my experiments; for I have abridged this for you others and spared you the burden of lengthy explanations; and I have opened this matter in the end for brevity; and I have shown you in the end the way in which these symptoms are administered, as it is stated in addition to the declaration, just as I have done in the two preceding chapters.</end_of_turn
First Chapter.</end_of_turn>
Summary and collection of these fractures of bones, from which the previous preface is necessary before we begin the remembrance of fractured limbs and various other things about them.</end_of_turn Therefore let us speak in this chapter of the sum total of the matter; and the chapters which follow are necessary for an understanding of the works of those artifices who are forced to stay close to the truth of these matters; for you and those who are commanded to know or learn this noble art from you.</end_of_turn
Therefore I say that when an accident of fracture or dislocation or twist or similar case occurs, the hour immediately following calls for cold compresses or the application of oil, or whatever remedy you deem appropriate, even if it is the cause of the accident itself, or if it is an infant, or an old man, or a time of great heat, or great cold.</end_of_turn
And we recommend in food both fresh herbs and boiled meats and crabs; and we forbid fatty meats and all foods that obstruct the veins of health, except when you are certain that the cautery will follow, and if you do not fear the effusion of matter from the limb.</end_of_turn
And the hour returns the patient to their first position as is customary for them.</end_of_turn
And when the fractured bone begins to be restored, the hour covers that the patient should not be given nourishing foods of great size and difficulty in which there is viscosity, such as broths made from barley with vinegar, broth of fish, brains, heads, feet, and calves, and fat from oxen, and eggs, and peas fresh, and large vegetables resembling those, and in this regimen is sufficient coagulation of the fracture more pleasantly and gently.</end_of_turn
And you must know that bones break in those who are in their first infirmity and in the decrepit, it is not possible for them to be continued and consolidated according to their nature by the drying out of the limbs.</end_of_turn
Moreover nature is accustomed to adjust and forgets the fractured bone in every way that is similar to a knot in which the thickness that adheres and strengthens that which is together until it is joined together again, until the end of formation and rest, just as fire at the beginning, until any cause does not prevent it from doing its work.</end_of_turn
And for this reason it is necessary to abstain from food for the patient, foods in which there is gravity and viscosity and bigness, as we have said.</end_of_turn
And you must know that the species of fracture are diverse according to the diversity of the limb, for the fracture of the thigh bone is different from the fracture of the skull bone; and the fracture of the forearm bone is different from the fracture of the leg bone; and in the same way all the others are diverse among them.</end_of_turn
And I will speak in each chapter of the memory of all the species of fracture, explained in a distinct chapter from the others.</end_of_turn
Many different fractures in general.</end_of_turn And the species of fracture of the bone in their entirety are diversified; for it is a useful fracture of the curved kind rather than that which occurs in the stars; and some fractures are useful according to the length of the bone: and these are the fractures of the heel and ankle and wrist, which are caused both by violent blows and by natural causes, just as it is said in the proverb when one is preparing to write, and it is a fracture with plaque and disruption in the head, and it is a slight fracture.
And in every case it is an evil or torment proper in restoring them according as will be remembered later on concerning the different things remembered in those same places.
Sign of fracture of the bone.</start_of_turn> And for this is known as a fracture of the bone: it is a twisting of the limb, and from that prominence and protrusion of the limb to the feeling, and only from this when I press on it with my hand.</start_of_turn
And therefore when there is no apparent twisting of the limb or if it is not suspected, you must touch the bone and if the patient does not feel great pain, then there is no fracture.</start_of_turn
There is also possible that it is a slight twisting or small fracture, in which case you must not touch that part with your hand or compress it; there must be a pause concerning the medicines from which you will remember later on at the appropriate moment; and then hold it strictly tight.</start_of_turn
And you must know that the limb when it is bent and is not split into two or something else that does not happen to it during life, when it is recovered in its entirety from the cause, the hour that covers that from the time you begin to rectify it has passed.</start_of_turn
And if it happens again after the cautery, leave it for a few days until the pain has ceased; and then support it as you can by any means that you can manage to lift and hold up.</start_of_turn
And you must know that the restoration of the limb and its elevation is lighter than that of the bone in which the pain occurs during life.</start_of_turn
And so remember what will come later.</start_of_turn
May be in the bone there are fractures, however, it is necessary to extend this limb broken in two parts, whether it is the hand or the foot; or with your hand if the limb is small; or with two strings or with one string and the hand.</start_of_turn
And keep your position so that the limb is held in its natural position, while the broken parts are extended from the limb; thus you will find it easier to return those after the cautery and in any way you can in their places.</start_of_turn
And take care that you do not cause further pain to the patient by your operation of the limb or injury; and perform it with the greatest care and skill that you can manage in order to join one bone to the other in a companionable way in many ways.</start_of_turn
And take advantage at that moment of your touch with your hand, and if sometimes there is some other cause of this, rectify that and support that for the amount of your virtue.</start_of_turn
And avoid excessive extension and compression, just as foolish doctors often do who perform the cautery for their operation, or who cause contraction in the limb just as we have seen in the performance of their operations.</start_of_turn
And the quality of the stricture of the limb is that which I recommend; for you must know that broken limbs are diverse in their size and greatness and in their shape.</start_of_turn
And as for those that are small such as the arm and the finger and the toe, the hour that covers them must be of soft material.</start_of_turn
And as for those that are large such as the thigh or the chest, cover them with tough material that is firm, so that the strong ligament that connects the great part with the strong part is held firmly in place, without any damage.</start_of_turn
And so begin, perform your evacuation of equipment, tie the convenient ligament in such a way as to reach the place of that fracture with three covers or four as the limb deserves; and hold the hand a little over the ligament.</start_of_turn
And so look at the most elevated part of the place of the fracture, and hold it more strongly than the stricture with which you have strengthened the place of the fracture.</start_of_turn Then draw out a little of the swelling around the fracture site, and gradually soften the stiffness, until you can grasp a large part of the limb.
Then take another bandage and wrap it around the wound surrounding the fracture, and also wrap the bandages further down from the fracture site. The operation should be performed on the stiffness of the bandage and in the softening of that which we said before about the first bandage.</end_of_turn>
Then rest between the folds of the loin or abdomen where there is the bending of the fracture, if there is bending of the fracture; but if not, do not rest in it for any reason.</end_of_turn>
Then rest on the other bandage, and tightly bind over these bandages as much as necessary, if there is no swelling or pus in the limb; and if there is swelling or pus, leave that for a while; and when the swelling has subsided, strengthen the bandage.</end_of_turn>
And let the layers of the bandage be of such size as to reach the knee; and be formed skillfully; or of felt or palm leaves; or of any other suitable material. And let the width of each layer be according to this form and figure.</end_of_turn
However, the layer that is placed over the fracture should be thicker and wider than the other layers. And the length of the layer should be such as is suitable for the limb in magnitude and proportion; and strengthen over the layers with another bandage according to your first stricture; and tie securely as before according to what has been said of stricture, for it is the stricture of the fracture itself that is most important, and as much as the fracture is prolonged, the stricter the stricture should be.</end_of_turn>
And let the threads be finer in thickness and flexibility, and be of silk. If the threads are thick, thus have I seen in the operation of many fools who have bound them during the fracture, and that is a great error, when they loosen the stricture before the fracture is equal.</end_of_turn
And subtle threads are not convenient, for you will not achieve stricture with them as with those that you wish. And do not allow that there be less than a finger's width between the layers.</end_of_turn
And if the patient is such that the edges of the fracture are near the stricture in those places, then rest them until no further damage is done.</end_of_turn
Some wounds of fracture are like a wound with pus, and an accident of disruption in the bone, and I recall in that book according to singularity.</end_of_turn
And know that a broken limb is not immediately straightened with the bandages on the first day; the reason for this is that when the limb is great, it does not suffice to rest it on the bandages for a few days or even a few weeks, according to your security of the risk of pus.</end_of_turn
This is the way in which the ancients restored the plaster with which they bound fractures, dislocations and twists.</end_of_turn
A plastering manner like that of healing a fracture, convenient for many complex and majorly for women and men, for which it is of those about which no heat or cold falls: and take powder of chaff, which is the pith of wheat that is left over from threshing.</end_of_turn
And be cautious lest it be as thick as an egg white, and do not make it too fine; and use this cautiously.</end_of_turn
Another method of dressing for fractures, dislocations and sprains: recipe of asphalt, lapdanum, acacia, enula and marigold, which is ground from a thousand grains of mastic gum, five grains of mirra and aloes, and two grains of aloes. Mix these together with water or with egg white if the patient's wound is raw; and use this dressing, which is of good composition and restores the broken bones pleasantly, and confirms to the majority of men.</end_of_turn
Another method of dressing for fractures and sprains: recipe of marigold and white alum, five grains of mirra and aloes, six grains of acacia and two grains of chamomile.</end_of_turn
All things are ground together in a mortar with a rough stone, and they are pounded, and they are consumed with water or with vinegar and oil, and it is administered.
Method of plastering joints and bones separated from each other at these locations, and when pain occurs in these and in fissures and fractures: take soft lanolin and submerge it in strong wine and oil cooked and put it on the area
May this plaster not be for restoration, but for the expulsion of pain properly
Another method of plastering that restores the fracture: take ashes of figs and ashes of poppy seed; mix them together and make plaster of them.
Method of plastering abbreviated for the restoration of bone fractures and when you want resolution of the remaining swelling: take root of violet, chamomile and violets, barley flour, all of which go together; They are all ground together and consumed with wine, if the limb is not scorched
If it is scorched, then consume it with lukewarm water of columb or with water and oil from it
Another method of plastering more solid in resolution than the first, when the swelling is hard, must be restored for the limb: take root of violet and linseed, barley, beeswax, marjoram, violets, chamomile, all of which go together; all of them are ground together and consumed with vinegar or water or wine, as desired according to the quality of the limb and the degree of its swelling
Hippocrates does not say that it should be left free that it is placed over the fractured limb until its restoration is completed, but rather that some kind of fat and oil should be added; and I recommend that you rather keep it between thickness and thinness
I do not know what Gualia is, but it is seen that it is placed over the fractured limb until its restoration is completed, and the causes in which it is excessive cold or heat are like those that we have recommended
Method of plastering that relieves injury and pain: take millet, celery, bruised bones of the house unscathed or poppy seeds, violets, salt, pounded together; they are ground together and pounded and consumed, and make plaster.
The quantity according to which it should be covered should remain so that the ligature is not too tight, for if it is too tight there is pain neither swelling nor is the bone fractured it is not good for its location. The hour you do not remove it for a few days. And if pain occurs violently or swelling or inflammation, the hour you should cover it up or remove it in that hour, and leave the plaster on it
And take sponge of linen and marine sponge soaked in warm water, and immerse that in lukewarm water, and with that wash the limb until the swelling and pain are gone; and then put on clean linen and cover the limb with lanolin soaked in strong wine and oil or olive oil, and bind over it for a night until you are sure that the swelling has gone down, and that the limb is relaxed, and that the pain has disappeared.
And repeat that tightening slightly and small plaster and do not tighten it excessively for your first constriction, and lower it when that is done until it is healed.
And if sometimes the swelling and the redness and the pain and the inflammation and all these things have already gone away, and digestion of plaster and of constriction is required, the hour you repeat that just as you have begun to make it whole again
And if no other cause has occurred to the limb of which we have spoken, the hour you should not remove it until three or four or five or seven days have passed and some people keep it for xx days as they please for the loosening of the limb, as we have said, until the fracture has healed, and when the coagulacion of the marrow over that has occurred.
And adjust in the tightening more than in your first tightening throughout, and adjust in the nourishment of the patient's food, as it is preceded by the recollection of that.
More often the limb of the fracture has dried out and become extended more than when it is covered, however you must know that food is prohibited to go to that; and therefore take that with lukewarm water that you must drink every day; and do it for three days; and loosen the tightening a little, and for this operation restore nourishment to the limb, and it will heal pleasantly.
When more than the fools of the doctors restore a fractured limb that has not been restored from the beginning, following the custom, and it is restored carelessly, it is an error according to their operation, and fear is great, and if they were more skilled, they would make the Ancients greater when they are free and would cause them no further harm in doing so.
And I have never seen any of them who do this, for it is more reasonable that they do not do it.</end_of_turn>
Chapter: On fractures when they occur in the head.</end_of_turn>
The species of fractures are multiple, and the figures are diverse, and the causes are diverse, for some fractures are caused by the percussion of space, and the percussion hinders all the bone within the cavity, which is left behind with the fracture itself, just as it happens in the wrist; and for this reason this species is called buckle fracture; or the space penetrates each part of the bone, and penetrates the marrow but does not pass through the back of the bone; and this species of fracture is called complete fracture.</end_of_turn
And the swelling of these two fractures is great or little, and of a fracture that is contracted or retracted; and the cause of this is the percussion with blunt or sharp objects, and it persists.</end_of_turn
And this fracture is penetrating, which already approaches the nerve that is left behind the bone; or it is in the face of the bone, and the swelling of these two fractures is great or little.</end_of_turn
And the fracture is that which is hidden in the bone, in the substance of the small vessel, and for this reason this species of fracture is called capillary fracture.</end_of_turn
And the fracture is caused by blunt or sharp objects or percussion of stone, and it persists, which makes any layer of the bone penetrate the parts surrounding it, and it is fatal in the hollow part just as it happens in the bones of the forearm when it is percussioned and a part of it is introduced into the surrounding parts.</end_of_turn
And more commonly it is caused by the bones of humid substances, as well as their heads.</end_of_turn
And thus with all these species of fractures that we have mentioned, they are like pieces of glass separated.</end_of_turn And I find it remarkable about all this.
And I know all these species of fractures by detection on them and by inquiry into their attempts and in the presence of corrupted bone that is over them.</end_of_turn
The capillary fracture is known by this that it is discovered on the bone, and it is excised, and is limited by an attempt, for the fracture appears black.</end_of_turn
Moreover, in the treatment of fractures, attention should be paid at the beginning to the signs of the disease, and when sometimes for the signs that indicate severity, such as vomiting of bile, extension, loss of consciousness, loss of voice, syncope, and acute fever, and if any of these symptoms persist, it is not healthy.</end_of_turn>
And when sometimes accidental occurrences do not happen, you hope for health, and when you begin the treatment of them.</end_of_turn
The cause of which is that if it is provoked at the beginning like the plague and what is in the winter days, it is necessary that you study in the bone marrow on the fourteenth day according to all custom.</end_of_turn
And if it is in the summer days, it is necessary that you cover the bone marrow for seven days, having observed that what is left behind the bone is corrupted by the nerve, and that these symptoms have occurred.
And if the fracture has already reached the nerve covering the cerebellum, and is divided into small pieces and retracted, it is necessary that you insert the divided part with an instrument, as I recommend to you.</end_of_turn
And that you take the head of the disease that is plagued, and discover on the bone according to custom and manage as you can according to the figure of the plague, and that you are curious about the disease.</end_of_turn
And if it happens to you, you must oppose the detection of the bone, flux of blood of cautery, for what you can, and that you cover it with oil and vinegar cloths, and make the plague rest until the swelling subsides; and be sure to drain the blood; and begin to circle the bone and to ablate it.</end_of_turn
And this is according to two methods of operation.</end_of_turn
E la una manieyra es que tu inscribes le os am inscisori de streyt tal, e aquesta es la forma de lu: E aprop administra un autre inscissori aquest, un pauc pus lat que aquel; e aquesta es la forma de lu:
And thus you inscribe the bones with a straight cut, and this is the way to do it: And then you administer another incision, a little wider than the former; and this is the way to do it.
And know that you must name several incisions, some of which are wider than others; and some of them are longer than others and lie at the back of the parts, and they are of iron or steel.
And use them with ease in percussion over the incisions so that you do not break the head and leave that one behind.
And if the bone is strong and hard, then you must pierce in the circumference of it giving that you administer the incisions at the edges, which are called superficial incisions
And they are not called thus except when those do not stop the end of the bone at the place where it should stop, for the superficial incision is a rounded end or margin over that which remains the head of the bone like a margin or a small circle, which prevents it from being submerged and passing the spiciness of the bone.
And it is convenient that you take a great number of these superficial incisions, which are convenient for the spiciness of each bone, as much as in all tests of the cervical part of the limb which is acute, the quantity in length and breadth being according to the quantity of spiciness of this test
And this is the form of three species of incisions: The quality of perforating in the circumference of the fractured bone is that you stop the incision on the bone and rotate that with the thumbs until you see that the bone has already been pierced; and then change the incision to another place, and stop when there is between all the amount of the thickness of the ray or around it
And thus you inscribe with the incisions that which is between each hole of the bone, and make that one more subtle than you could over that in the end of levitating, as we have said, until you eradicate the bone, or with your hand, or with any other cause for some disturbance which occurs to it, as nails and fine forceps
And know that you must take great care that the incision does not touch any cause of infection.
And therefore when you have pierced the bone around the infection, and if it is continued with it, extract it, for you must scrape and burn away that which is in the roughness of it like an incision, more especially since the other incisions are more taut and subtle.
And if there remain any small parts of the bones and fragments, then take those away with ease with that which is due to you from the disturbances; and thus care for the wound with liniment and ointment as we have said
And another manner of operating is light, long, which says dissect Gaul and split for a great wound; and this is the saying of it: It is necessary for you at the beginning to begin to uncover the part of the bone in the place where the fracture is most vehement and most apparent, until when you have uncovered that part and you have stopped leaving that limb of that incision slowly and calmly as we have said.
And that the blunt part is round and does not touch any cause, and the acute part is of it in two broad parts forward and backward, as sometimes; that the blunt part be adjusted to the infection with the face of the acute incision on the bone.
And thus you pierce over the incisions with a little hammer until you have pierced all the bone with ease as if it were rotated, and you must be sure of the safety that it does not happen by chance in any manner, and if the physician was the most learned of all men and the most ignorant of them; certainly, and if he was asleep
And if there remains any accessory cause attached to the bone in any place of the bone, pierce that one with the extremity of the incision that is blunt, and deliver that one with ease, for it is delivered from it spontaneously and without pain.
And if the fracture of the bone does not penetrate into the cavity, and that which is broken off or remains of the bone is the face of it, and remains in the roughness and subtleties, then know that you must scrape that roughness and extirpate those subtleties cautiously with reasons worthy of it for the number of which you have prepared, of various quantities so that you can manage to administer them in all places with the greatest convenience and the greatest safety according to what you have lost in your operation that broken bone and its shape
And know that you must administer with your reason at the beginning of those reasons the most obtuse of those reasons, and thus use a little of the former and do not cease until you have reached the greatest tenacity and the greatest subtlety of all those.
May in any of the other minor fractures or superficial fracture, cover that you administer care according to what you have lost in order to rectify them.
It is because it is not known about all of those things that have been studied in that art And this is what we have shown in great fractures
And if the swelling is rectangular when you extract the bone, then cover that you take hold of it according to the quantity of the wound, and immerse it in olive oil, and place it over the orifice of the wound; and then take another bandage doubled or tripled and immerse it in wine and olive oil and place it over the first bandage, and do to the pus that it comes out willingly from that place, that it does not cause him to suffer; and then administer over that ligament fat, and do not tighten that except for the quantity that has the wound alone.
And leave that like this for a day or two until you are sure that the wound has healed; and then remove that and administer medicines that are useful for drying up, such as rue seeds and oatmeal, and powdered alum and herbs, and like those.
And it is that you grind these medicines into powder that is scattered over the wound; and in general, administer all medicines of proper action that you deem to be astringent and not corrosive.</start_of_turn>
And be careful in your art that the wound in your care is neither too dry nor too wet; neither let it become contaminated with any other thing; for when it is adjusted over the bone of the head, it corrupts that and weakens it, and causes the patient to suffer greatly.</start_of_turn>
And take care in the suffering of the patient, as when it is modified the bone and more when the care of it is diminished, and is black on the surface; and therefore consider that when it comes to the patient the accidents that we have said, knowing that it is pernicious for him to do so in every way.</start_of_turn
And if no blackening appears except for the medicine that is left out, and it is in virtue of that medicine that makes that blackening, then cover that you take a little more of the medicine and a little olive oil three times. and with those stripes a bandage, and place that over the suffering; and then care for that according to the species of treatment that you deem to be appropriate until it is healed.</start_of_turn>

Of the restoration of the nose when it is fractured.</start_of_turn
Know that the nose is not fractured but rather that two parts have become displaced, or one of those has been somewhat softened, so that in it you have two bones, for the displaced part is cartilaginous and is not fractured and does not suffer except for swelling and pain and sleeplessness.</start_of_turn
When one of the two parts is fractured, then cover that you insert little by little in the ditch of the nose, and that you unite that fracture with the tie that indicates it, and with the poultice, until the nose returns to its natural shape.</start_of_turn And be useful for you in this, and keep that you do not cause excessive pain for the patient during that operation.</start_of_turn
And if the fracture is in the upper part of the nose, and you say that it is not for this, then cover that it be equal at the end of the ray in which it is small.</start_of_turn
And if the fracture is in two parts, then do like that.</start_of_turn
Cover that you restore it on the first day of the fracture if possible; and if not, then leave it for a while or two until you deem it to be healed.</start_of_turn
And put into the extremity of the nose a wick of lint if the fracture is in one part, or two cushions if the fracture is in two parts, and be of such size that it fills the hole of the nose.</start_of_turn
And tell the old restorers that the cushions should be bound around the edges, and should be changed throughout the day, although it is not seen by me; for I have covered that the wick should be immersed in albumin with oil of poppy seed; and like that keep the wound closed until the bone is firm and the cartilage is solidified.</start_of_turn
And some put sponges into the nose instead of a cushion, because it is better for increasing the pus that is enveloped in lint; and that the fracture of the nose is more violent and that the patient is not prohibited from inspiration.</start_of_turn
This cause is not urgent; if you wish, make an incision, or if you wish, make a calamus.
If another wound appears after the cautery, apply pressure to the area with the thumb or with the heel immersed in vinegar and olive oil, or with diachronicum.</end_of_turn>
If the wound does not reappear, however, cover it with flour of the size of barley and fine powder of hen feathers with egg white; and place your hand over it to stop the bleeding, and do not touch it for any reason.</end_of_turn>
If the bones of the limb are fractured slightly or broken, cover the wound and extract the fragments with instruments suitable for each; then close the wound, and care for the area where the fracture occurred and consolidate it, and apply appropriate dressings.</end_of_turn
If there is a wound of the flesh in the limb, cover the wound with a calamus and administer lead needles until it is completely healed.</end_of_turn>

Treatment for a fractured jawbone.</start_of_turn>
When the jawbone is fractured and the fracture is not associated with a wound, it is necessary to assess if the fracture is displaced only, and not fractured into two and bent outwards. In this case, the patient's pain is usually slight.</start_of_turn
Therefore, if the fracture is on the right side, insert the index finger of the left hand into the patient's mouth; and similarly if the fracture is on the left side, insert the index finger of the right hand; and hold the fracture with your other hand on the opposite side of the limb from the affected area, so that the bone is supported equally on both sides.</start_of_turn
If the jawbone is already fractured into two, administer extension of the two parts according to the rectitude until it is possible to achieve balance.</start_of_turn
If teeth are loosened due to the fracture, strengthen those that you hope will remain intact with gold or silver or ivory; and place your hand over the fractured jaw and hold the duplicate tissue, and place your hand over the great nerve appropriately, or a pad equal in length to the jaw; and tie the dressing according to what is appropriate for the patient and convenient for the application.</start_of_turn
Command the patient to rest and remain calm, and refrain from eating any sour foods.</start_of_turn
If you observe that the shape has already been altered in some way, cover the area and remove it on the third day; and then correct what has already been altered and cover the area with powder of mallow, egg white or barley flour, as it has already been said, and keep your hand over the dressing.</start_of_turn
And when the limb is fixed and the adjustment of the bone is complete, leave it as it is, without removing the dressing, until the fracture is healed; for if you remove the dressing too soon, the fracture will become stretched in three parts.</start_of_turn
If another wound appears after the cautery, administer what has been said about the care of the wound until it is healed, and remove the wound.</start_of_turn
If the fracture is associated with a wound, consider whether it is a detached piece of the bone or a displacement, and in the latter case, you are advised to remove the displacement along with the pain.</start_of_turn
If the wound opening is wide, enlarge the opening with the flebotome according to the amount of the necessary expansion.</start_of_turn
When you have finished removing the displacement, and of those you do not remove, close the wound if it is wide; otherwise, keep your hand over the wound until it is healed.</start_of_turn
End of treatise.</start_of_turn
Treatment for a fractured collarbone.</start_of_turn
A fracture of the collarbone usually occurs from the front side of the bone, below the muscle, and this fracture can be classified into three types.</start_of_turn
Whether the fracture is complete or incomplete, or whether there is a displacement without associated fracture; the recovery of the fracture is desired; or if there is displacement of the fragments, restoration is difficult; or if the fracture is associated with a wound.</start_of_turn
In such a case, when the fracture is associated with a wound, two assistants are necessary, one to hold the fractured area and the other to extend the collarbone on the opposite side.</start_of_turn
And thus embrace the fracture at the thighs until it is formed in the right way, and do not leave it protruding too little or too much.
If you extend it more than necessary, then stop and let the patient feel the pain, and let the size of the wound be according to the quantity of your need; and extend and elevate the fracture and cover the wound with your hand until you have embraced the fracture as it should be embraced.</end_of_turn>
If you are unable to draw out the limb from the socket, so that it is protruded, then stop and let the patient rest their chin on their chest, and place a cushion under their muscle of the limb.</end_of_turn>
And the assistants support the limb under the muscle of the limb until the bone of the fracture is elevated above the socket, and when you have rectified the fracture, embrace that which is at the thighs.</end_of_turn>
Even if you feel stiffness of the fracture and pain, stop and put your hand over that and extract those stiffness with ease.</end_of_turn>
And if it is retained in the bone, stop and make an incision of the limb with one of the instruments which you have prepared for this purpose, because you had paused leaving the fracture without support; and this is the form of the wound:
Like a wound of the kind which has this concavity; and let the width of it be according to what you need of it, according to the greatness of the bone or the scarcity of it.</end_of_turn
And the length of it should be as much as is possible for the operation; that there be two limbs like this at times, one limb wide and the other narrow.</end_of_turn
And if the disruption of the membrane which you have incised when you have extracted the stiffness from the bone is wide, and you are sure of the apposition of the cautery, then you adjust the two edges of the wound with sutures.</end_of_turn
And if the disruption is small, or you fear the apposition of the cautery, then you close the wound with gauze and powder according to the quantity of the wound.</end_of_turn
And if there is an apposition of the cautery, stop and put on oil of rosemary and wine, and cover it.</end_of_turn
And finally, do not neglect to see the patient every day, because when the ligament is softened or when the splint has become softened, then you must rectify this and strengthen the bandage.</end_of_turn
And keep the patient from moving around too much, and let them sleep with their limb slightly elevated; so that at this height the attendants are at ease, and the fracture of the thigh is elevated to the height of the muscle; or that the arm is bound to the limb at the height of this.</end_of_turn
And do not remove the bandage if there is no sign of progress or if there is an apostema, up to twelve days.</end_of_turn>
And renew the plaster if you have seen the surface of the limb to that, and restore it in the rigidity and restore it when the fracture of the thigh is restored and the blood clotting has taken place.</end_of_turn
And is strong and comfortable according to the month in xxviii days, and some walks in a house is useful in the month of that.</end_of_turn
The treatment is finished.</end_of_turn>
Restoration of the fracture of the thigh.</end_of_turn>
The spatula is broken at the lateral edge of the limb and is not fractured in the middle of it.</end_of_turn
And therefore when it is fractured in the middle of the limb — and it is fractured in the middle of the limb — and is not recognized except by touch, then according as the shape of the fracture forces you to prepare it and reduce it according to the natural figure in every way that is possible for you.</end_of_turn
And so they stop the powder of mallow with an egg white; and they stop the powder of alum with a double spatula; and they stop over the surface with a sponge as much as the spatula whole or a little more.
If the sponge remains concave in some parts of the area, then you should overlap that concave area with the egg white, and then place the sponge equally.
Then remove the bowels with a long instrument with a tight constriction downwards and with a firm grip of the sponge so that it does not slip from the place.</start_of_turn>
Consider the ligament in each day; and whenever it is softened, tie another bandage and hold it firm so that the sponge does not slip from the place.</start_of_turn
And I hold the patient over the latrine seat.</start_of_turn>
And the sponge is restored in xx days or in .xxv.</start_of_turn
And thus when the number is completed, then you dissolve the ligament, and you know with certainty that what was from the bones from which you began is not to be feared or dissolved.</start_of_turn
And if you proceed from the foot bone and leave the tendo, then you should split over it, and keep it, and do as we have said in the fracture of the scapula of the heel after the cautery if it happens here.</start_of_turn
Chapter VII.</start_of_turn>
Of the restoration of the fracture of the foot.</start_of_turn
The bones of the foot which are fractured in the middle of the limb and those which are at the end must be broken off; but the extremities of the limb must be kept firm that they may cicatrize and diminish.</start_of_turn
And as for the accidents of the limb when the middle is fractured, it is that it inclines to the adjacent parts and causes great pain, difficulty in walking, and vomiting; and all these things are declared in the cavity of the fractured bone and are not hidden from the sense.</start_of_turn
And the restoration of the limb is that you rest the patient on the two buttocks, and place between the buttocks of the limb a cushion; and you press on the muscles of the limb, and adjust the ribs of the limb to the greatest of two ribs, and hold them in the operation of the limb and in the equilibrium according to all the manner that is possible and that is convenient, until you restore the shape of the bone as it was before.</start_of_turn
And so you stop over the plaster and stop and stop over the dressing of the sponge or bandage of gauze or linen and keep them suspended in the air; and you cover that with a dressing; and you bind that over the fractured bone so that it is not painful; and you stretch that according to the swelling of each bruise, and hold that tightly; and consider the dressing at all times, and when it is softened stretch that.</start_of_turn
And if necessary you cause to drain of that you must correct the swelling or bruising, or pain, or swelling that occurs in the limb, then you should uncover and remove that and remove the plaster and correct what has happened in the way of care; and so reduce the plaster, sometimes up to the face; and adjust the stretch so that it is healthy.</start_of_turn
Chapter VIII.</start_of_turn
Of the restoration of the ribs when they are fractured.</start_of_turn
You must know that the fracture of the ribs does not take place but in the thick parts that follow two; and as for the extremities of the parts from the front they do not cause anything except for what is cartilaginous.</start_of_turn And you must know that it is not hidden from the sense; you must inquire about it from the patient.</start_of_turn
And the restoration must be such that it embraces the fracture as we have said according to the possibility, except that it be embraced as it is enough; and so you plaster and strengthen the fractured bone with a sponge, if you think it is necessary of that.</start_of_turn
And if the fracture of the ribs is declining to the adjacent parts, then it causes the patient severe pain and puncture, just as if it were a puncture that happens to the one that has pleuracy; and for that the bone puts on the membrane; and it causes difficulty in swallowing, and vomiting and almost no cure; and this is difficult to cure.</start_of_turn
And already the Ancients were ingenious in that manner.</start_of_turn
And thus they say: cover that you take away the food of the patient which produces swelling and wind, so that the belly be flat and extended, and the fracture be fixed to the parts outside.</start_of_turn
Mays nos avoreyssem aquo per so que no sia causa leugiera a generar apostema caut, si no accideys; e si ja accideys, lahoras ja ajuda ad aquo.
And say some of them that it should be stopped from the wind and that it should be covered; and it is like reasoning, but indeed it is feared that the wind will tear the excess from the area because of the weakness.
And say some of them: cover the area with wool that is already immersed in burnt oil, and put powder between the ribs until it is full, that the ligature be firm when I encircle it around that according to custom; and indeed let it be treated with care with food and medicine
And if it causes violent constriction of the patient who does not suffer from it, and if you give it a violent puncture with a pointed needle, remember about the patient, for when you cover the area, uncover the fractured rib, and indeed place your hand over that instrument that maintains the guts, the memory of which precedes it, and that it is necessary to loosen them, and extract what is inside.
And indeed let us adjust the two lips of the plague, if it is great, with boiling, and care for that with plaster until it is healed
And if an accident of bleeding occurs, then your cushion and soak up powder in burnt oil and place over the area, and care for the patient with that which covers the bleeding.
And rest on the side on which you sleep, until it is healed.

Restoration of fracture of the vertebra of the thigh and of the pelvis.
Some veins can be bled from the bones of the pelvis, and their cautery must be applied, and it is similar to the vertebra of the thigh. And when it happens to some of them and you wish to know if it is healed or not, consider that sometimes the veins are already softened and stupefied and dead, and you cannot make them swell or extend or straighten them out without causing them to bleed, and when you tighten them with your fingers or prick them with a needle and they do not cause pain, you must know that it is not healed, and in these circumstances it is deadly.
And if you do that and feel in that tightening with your fingers or puncture them, you must know that the bone marrow is saved and that the patient will recover with care
And if you see the vertebrae of the pelvis like this and you wish to know if it is healed or not, consider the weight of them
Sometimes when they are softened, accidents happen in the most violent, and indeed when you touch them about the two thighs, there is windiness and vomiting is its will, and many veins are supinated over the two thighs and cannot urinate, and you must know that it is deadly, and do not work in the care of them.
If it does not happen that any cause of these is found, the cause is better and less severe
The care for them is that you perforate the sensation of the bleeding with the pointed cautery which is placed over the fractured vertebra covered with burnt oil, or with balls of wool soaked in vinegar; place over that anything that any veins give within that the bleeding stops.
And indeed let us remove one of the comforting and existing plasters, and tighten over that which is ligature; and command the patient to rest and be tranquil and not to sleep on the side where he experiences pain until he is healed
And if an accident occurs that requires the removal of the sacrum or any cause that is already separated from it, then cover that area and hold that bone; and indeed adjust the two lips of the plague, with suture if it is great; and indeed care for that which is at the root of the disease, until it is healed
And if the heel bone is fractured, and it is the end of the limb, then cover that area and place your left hand on the heel and grasp the fractured bone with your right hand as much as possible; and indeed place over that bandage and plaster, if you wish, and indeed tighten that.
And if you feel the sacrum fractured in it, then take your foot off that area and hold that, and care for the plague with the care that precedes until it is healed

Restoration of the limb.
The bones of the limb have been fractured, and if they break, the fracture of them is only a communication in the extremities of these and is inscribed in the length and declines to the inward; and it happens that the patient feels pain in the area and punctures, and the limb is stunned when it is fractured
The restoration of the limb is that you extend your hand over that which is over the fracture that is the figure of the limb.
If the fracture is at the extremity of the limb alone, then you embrace that part as much as is appropriate according to the equation until it is assembled to its natural figure.</end_of_turn>
May be if the fracture is in the bone or that it has already declined to the lower parts, then you make the patient lie on his belly until it is prepared for you to restore that fracture.</end_of_turn> And therefore when you have embraced that, pause over the bandage, and then pause over that splinter of bone or marrow, and strengthen by stricture over which you do not fear puncture of the fracture or removal of the splinter.</end_of_turn
Embrace the concavity with that which is over that which that supports the stricture according to equality, and command the patient to lie down on his side or to rest on his side with his chest out.</end_of_turn
May be if after this cautery occurs, then you cease the extension of the limb and its restoration until the cautery has subsided, and pause over it until that which is preceding is completed; and then return to the restoration of the limb, and strengthen that thus.</end_of_turn
And if it happens in the heel bone or they are comminuted, then you treat them.</end_of_turn
The treatise ends here.</end_of_turn>
Restoration of the fracture of the adjunct.</end_of_turn
The adjunct is that which is between the groin to the head of the femur.</end_of_turn>
And if it is fractured, the restoration of it is in two ways, of which one is that you grasp the fractured bone with a handle of coarse sand according to this fashion:
And join to it in two extremities two ligaments, and then suspend it from the elevated place.</end_of_turn
And follow the patient on a chair; and then put the fractured limb outside over the bone until it reaches the middle part from which the curvature of the bone is annexed.</end_of_turn
And if there is any other serious cause, or the limb extends to the lower parts; and then the physician should hold the fracture firmly in the upper parts until the fracture returns as it should.</end_of_turn
And the other way is that the patient be supine on the cervical spine and suspend the limb of the collarbone with a ligament; and command two assistants one to hold what is below the fracture on his hands; and the other to hold the lower parts of it; and each one extend to his part.</end_of_turn
And if you want the extension to be stronger, then you strengthen over the fracture with the ligament and over that with the other ligament, and each one of the assistants extend two of their parts.</end_of_turn
And therefore if the fracture is close to the extremity of the muscle, then cover that half of the ligament over the trochanter and the other half leave the fracture outside the groin.</end>
Similarly if the fracture is near the groin, then cover that ligament over that place and over that groin.</end_of_turn
Embrace that which facilitates and makes it easier, and when it is embraced as it should be according to that which covers and is applied well, then strengthen that which if not after cautery.</end_of_turn
May be if after this cautery occurs, then leave the stricture for seven days, and pause over it like a bandage of wool and oil until the cautery has subsided, and then strengthen that again.</end_of_turn
And the way to strengthen that is to pause the bandage over the fracture, and then pause the wrapping of coarse cloth over the bandage; and then adjust the arm over that adjunct, and put your hand open over the muscle.</end_of_turn
And pause the muscle and strengthen over the adjunct the arms so that the arm is in place without hindering anything that may cause the fractured bone.</end_of_turn
And use crutches.</end_of_turn
And that which pauses over the fracture that staff is more rigid and more strong than the others; and pause between each staff the width of a finger, and the length of the staff according to the fracture along with three fingers from the whole part.</end_of_turn
And strengthen over the staff at the stricture which I mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.</end_of_turn
The stricture around the fracture site should be as tight as possible. When the fracture is longer, the stricture should be smaller
Therefore, if sometimes the position of the bones and the stricture are as we have said at the time when you restore the limb to its normal position, then you will do well
And if you fear swelling from the cautery, then leave the stricture and the bones inside for seven days as we have said before
And consider the ligament in all parts for three days so that it does not become inflamed in the place of the fracture; or it is prohibited to eat to prevent the limb from suffering from excessive stricture; and therefore rectify all this as we have said before.
May it be that you are confident that no harmful cause will occur, however, do not remove the ligature until at least three days have passed
And let the patient rest quietly on the bed, and their limbs above their stomach
And pause about the attendants who are carrying the cooked food, and consider at every hour of the night or day that it should not be swollen or dissolved the figure of the fractured limb, or that the ligament should not be softened, therefore rectify all this with your skill.
And abstain from eating for the patient according to the order that we have given before, even if the food is soft at the beginning until it has been chewed; and cover that the patient does not vomit
As for the custom of the attendants and the change of position, it is that they should be strengthened for forty days; and cover that they are unfastened and that baths are administered and that medicine is given with which these things rectify that.
And if the fracture is delayed, then do not remove the ligature from that limb until a day or two months have passed.
Chapter XII
Of the restoration of the fracture of the arm.
The arm is composed of two bones which are called two heads; of which one is small, and that is the one which is called the shoulder, and the other is great and that is the one which is supported from behind the little finger, from the part below the shoulder
And it is strong that only the great head is fractured, or only the small, or that both are fractured together
And when the little head is fractured, the restoration of the limb is lighter, and the healing is easier
And when the great head is fractured behind the shoulder the fracture is bad, and the healing is difficult
And the worse of all is when both bones are fractured together
Therefore, if the bone that is fractured is the little head displaced, it is convenient for the doctor to suspend the restoration of the limb, that is, to leave it in slight extension until it is healed
But if the great head is fractured, then cover that you suspend extension even more violently
And if both bones are fractured together, then cover that you suspend the extraction even more strongly
And cover that you support the limb so that the restoration of the limb and the extension of the limb is extended over a cushion, and that the palm of the hand is below the other fingers, more than all the others say, and that the thumb is lower than the others, and the patient is sitting on a cushion.
And let there be a cushion under the limb in front or behind, so that the patient does not strain himself
And let the ministers extend the limb from the part below the shoulder towards the shoulder with the sleeve of the arm or with the ligament, and another minister extend the same in a similar way
And the doctor must heal the bone until it returns to its normal position according to the best figure that can be made
And if there is a displacement of the bone, then you must reduce the whole limb in its place with your skill
And if there appears a separate displacement that you do not hope to restore, then you must leave it as it is according to our teaching from the beginning
And if the fracture is in the palm, and I have already said enough about this matter, then take care of that
And if swelling from the cautery should happen at the beginning of your restoration, then you line up a sponge with some rose oil and white wax, and put half between moisture and dryness, and strengthen the sponge over that which is under tension until the swelling subsides; and you remain the sponge and pause the plaster prepared from powdered millet with clay from the heel, and hold the bones; and make the bone which is fractured more rigid and strong.
The stars of the arm are seen in great abundance, or a fracture in one or two bones together.
Then tighten the bandage firmly over the fracture site and when more is required, loosen the bandage from the parts above the fracture or from the parts below, tighten the bandage a little less as a reminder of what was done at the beginning of the chapter
The cloths that cover the fracture are soft and moist, not rough or dry, and the thread with which it is bound should be neither too fine nor too coarse, as we have recommended.</start_of_turn>
Consider the limb and its ligament for a few days. And if any cause occurs for which rectification is necessary, do the same as if it had happened to the limb, and until the pain has gone away.
Keep the limb still until it has recovered, and then tighten the bandage again.</start_of_turn>
If the swelling has already subsided and the bone is already healed and appears as before, then rectify everything with your skill.</start_of_turn>
Consider also if the nourishment is forbidden from reaching the limb because of excessive tightening, because you should soften that a little and leave it for a few days until the pain has gone away, and then strengthen it.</start_of_turn
If no other cause of these has occurred to the patient, do not remove the bandage for about xx days or so.</start_of_turn
And suspend the patient's hand for its violent movement, and make them sleep on two cushions.</start_of_turn
You know that this fracture is healed in xxx days or in xxxii days, or the bone is healed in xxviii days, and all this according to the complexity of the case and the skill of the practitioner.</start_of_turn
Chapter XIII.</start_of_turn>
On the restoration of the fracture of the thumb and the fingers.</start_of_turn
You know that at the thumb and the tips of the fingers there is a fracture, and that it does not occur except with soft tissue tears.</start_of_turn
And when the hand is fractured or there is a tear, you must make the patient continue to fall and bend it lightly as before, and place your hand over that which is extended.</start_of_turn
Then the minister extends the broken bones and the doctor unites them until they are congruent with good union.</start_of_turn
And you must keep the plaster still and quiet, if not, you will cause further damage; and tighten the bandage according to the amount of the area, and you have already covered that with wool.</start_of_turn
If the fracture is at the base of the palm, you must support the palm of the hand, and command the patient to strengthen that which has been fractured; strengthen it both with the palm and with the long bone.</start_of_turn
And the bone which is floating on the wool should be applied to the palm; and strengthen that as much as you can.</start_of_turn
If the fracture is at the outside of the hand, you must remove the bandage from the outside of the hand and from the inside of the palm, so that the hand can be opened and closed; and tighten the bandage, as if the hand were rotated between the fingers with the ligaments.</start_of_turn
If there is a fracture in one of the fingers, if it is said to be delicate, it must be united as it is convenient and strengthen it with the palm and if you wish, place a small support to elevate the fracture and prevent it from being crushed.</start_of_turn
If the fracture is in the other fingers, just as in the middle finger, or in the index, or in the ring, or in the little finger, you must unite them as a whole and bind them with the finger that is next to the one which has the fracture; or you can bind them all together as a continuous line, which is better; or you can place a small support over that finger, as we said before.</start_of_turn
Consider in your restoration, and do so, the custom of postoperative treatment and the contrary — with the surgical operation — with what is done when any cause of these has occurred, as is repeated in the narration.</start_of_turn
Chapter XIV.
De restauracio de fractura del os de la coyssa.
The thigh bone is violently fractured and is said to be converted into gangrene and yellow pus.
The restoration is done by stretching the ligament over the fracture and another ligament is left to support the fracture. The patient is placed prone on the abdomen and on the face
And then the minister extends all the ligament according to the quality, when the fracture is in the middle of the bone
Even if it is close to the hip, then the ligament is properly stretched at the fifth space, so that the extension is done without risk, and the other ligament leaves the fracture
Similarly, if the fracture is close to the hip, then do the same with the ligament at the hip, and make the extension outwards
And then the doctor grasps the bone from both sides and reduces that which is necessary according to the natural conformation; the bone is joined by a good connection. The hand must be covered with a dressing and a bandage must be applied without delay to the limb that has been injured And if there is an accident in the limb, then leave it for a few days until the swelling subsides, and then return to your care.
The bandage should be placed as follows: cover the fracture with a hard bandage, bend the limb two or three times, and remove the excess; and then cover the wound so that it reaches the knee and the hip
And keep long thread firmly between the hip and the limb towards the toes, and pass the ends of the thread from the upper part of the wound to the lower parts, and then twist over the wound and the hip as much as the excess of the bandage
And then rest on the hip in the place of that fracture, and put a bandage on the limb of the bone of the wound.
And then fill the space between the limb and the thigh with soft cloths, so that the bleeding is stopped
And then make a firm bandage from the middle over the place of the fracture with three or four covers, and when you have advanced from the middle of the fracture, your bandage will be less tight and lighter and softer
And extend the two ends of the thread to the toes until it reaches the ankle, and tighten both ends of the threads at the other side so that the ligament is not strained in the middle
And keep the bandage on for a while, until there is no longer any risk of swelling or bruising or discomfort; and if any of these should happen, take it off immediately and correct what has happened as soon as possible, as we have said above concerning the wounds that have been mentioned.
And if the bone is very painful in the bone to which the bandage is applied, then cover that immediately; otherwise remove it and leave that, and care for the cause of the pain from which this originates until it is healed
Every bandage should be stretched so that this fracture of the thigh is well adjusted to the bones, as we have said in the instructions and in the manuals.
However, in the restoration of the limb in this way it does not cause pain to the patient; and if it is restored alone, or if another bandage is applied to the other limb, it is necessary to keep the limb that is being treated immobile
And you must know that the thigh is stretched for 40 days or a few months or a few weeks, according to the diversity of conditions and the other equipment.

You must know that the fracture of the thigh bone is very painful, but it is not caused by the wounds.
And if there should happen to be a fracture, it is not anything more than a tear or fracture in the tissues, and this is either pain or swelling, and about this you must be aware
The restoration of the limb is in such a way that it is supported and held together by the tissues that are left intact, without causing any further damage or discomfort
And then cover the wound and put a bandage over the round cushion, if you wish; and tighten the bandage as much as is convenient.
Consider all the precautions that have been recommended in other fractures, thus as in the case of apostema caut, which is similar to those that are opposed to all accidents that may occur except in cases where it is convenient to do so.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.</start_of_turn>
And if it is necessary to make points on the surface of the foot, then do so with a pointed cautery.</start_of_turn
Then return the intestine or hernia to its cavity, and place your hand over the area to prevent the intestine from coming out.</start_of_turn
You have already opened the space between the patient's thighs, placed a cushion under them, another servant on their legs, and another on their chest, holding their hands.</start_of_turn
Consider all the precautions that have been recommended in other fractures, thus as in the case of apostema caut, which is similar to those that are opposed to all accidents that may occur except in cases where it is convenient to do so.</start_of_turn
When the bones of the forearm are fractured together, the limb becomes converted into every part.</start_of_turn
When the large bone is fractured, the limb should be suspended, for this is one of the causes that brings no harm.</start_of_turn
And give extension, equalization, and ligature of the bands according to the healing.</start_of_turn
However, if the fracture of the limb is slight and there are no soft tissues involved, the extension should be milder and lighter, and relieve with your ability.</start_of_turn
And in the limb there is any cause of operation on the forearm, and that is when you have healed the breaks and when you have completed all the work of the operation, then you will take away the dressings from the causes that were kept in place only, and you will make use of white of palm; mix these with those that have little thickness, and do not be afraid of the hands, and make the length of these according to the length of the limb, and of the distance from the bone inwards.</start_of_turn
And cover over any wound with two covers according to their length, and place one over the part of the limb from one side and the other from the other side, and keep the distance from the bone inwards.</start_of_turn
And tie the two bandages in three places at the two extremities and at the middle, so that this structure prevents the limb from leaning to the right and left, and remains in a good position.</start_of_turn
And a bandage of cloth has been administered according to the length of the limb; and keep the limb fixed in it so that it conserves that movement.</start_of_turn
And more than anything else, cover what is fractured so that when it is like that it is properly healed.</start_of_turn
And consider in every day the limb and study it in order to discover behind study, and you will keep it from gout and from inflammation or from other causes similar; and when any cause of these occurs, the hours you will take away from it until it is healed.</start_of_turn

The treatise continues with a discussion of fractures of the ankle and foot bones.</start_of_turn
The ankle does not often fracture; however, the bones of the foot do sometimes fracture; and the toes hardly ever fracture, and they do not fracture except in exceptional circumstances.</start_of_turn
And if the bones of the foot must fracture, and sometimes these bones must be elevated between them, the hours you should put the foot down on the prepared earth as if you were going.</start_of_turn
And put one foot on what is elevated from those bones, and put on boots, and press, and heal those until they are reunited in the places.</start_of_turn
And put on a plaster and stop the swelling, and put a little stool under the belly of the foot so that two heads of paste can be placed on it.</start_of_turn
And strengthen that which is stretched down, because you have wrapped that up with cloth and with other causes of which you do not approve.</start_of_turn
And when three days or four have passed, the hours you will remove the bandage, because you will find the bones healed, or that they are fractured or dislocated, and the operation in these is thus with care.</start_of_turn
And if some of the toes are fractured, the hours you will restore those, and heal those as well as you did the thumb and recommend to you the restoration of the toes of the hand.</start_of_turn And thus stop the nail truncated to the length of the toe; and place a little pressure on it; and then leave the foot on this table which is recommended to you, and strengthen that stricture downwards.
May be if the nail is truncated from the bone it will be two or three or more, then you stop over each toe the amount of flesh enveloped in soft marrow, and strengthen the table at the base of the foot, and stand on one of the ends of the table near the sole of the foot so that it has good retention
And it is convenient for you to remember that you do not take into consideration all the causes which we have mentioned in other fractures of the accidents which we have mentioned; and be attentive to every accident with that which covers us.

Of fracture of the bone of the thigh and of the patella and of the cuboid bone of the foot.</end_of_turn>
When the bone of the thigh is truncated, then cease in the socket the descending fragment which has fallen down, and incline that towards the side of the two by a little, and keep it extended from behind.</end_of_turn
And thus fill the matrix with cotton, and make a point in the bone of the thigh as expected; and elevate the two little bones gradually, until everything that is outside is forgotten until the fragment of the bone is as expected and the truncated bone returns.</end_of_turn
And thus powder over the two little bones, and when you wish to urinate stay away from the cushion so that it is easier and then urinate, and reduce and return that as you began, and return the cushion first.</end_of_turn
And do thus for seven days or until he is restored.</end_of_turn
And if you wish, take once of belladonna and strengthen over the fracture of the bone a tube of sponge; and empty all the bladder into the bone of the thigh, and then cover with sponge in the tube until the bladder is inflamed so that the fracture returns.</end_of_turn
And thus keep it filled with cotton and stay until it is healed as we have recommended, until he is sound.</end_of_turn>
And when the patella or the cuboid bone of the foot or the bone of the thigh is truncated, then administer in the restoration and agility of these the things which we have recommended in the hip bone.</end_of_turn
And what is fractured is not hidden in these primary fractures and that little damage, mainly to him who is the master of study and use of this book; for that fracture signifies to you in the greatest possibilities of recovery in the restoration and tightening of these.</end_of_turn
But when the cuboid bone of the foot is truncated, take an ointment of vinegar, and put the bone in that; and pause over the covering of wax, and cover, and let it rest for three days or until it is healed.
Chapter XIX.</end_of_turn>
Of the restoration of fractures of the bones when it is inflamed.</end_of_turn
It is convenient in that in which the fracture has happened with inflammation, and especially if the bone is great as is the bone of the buttock or of the adductor, or like that, that you take care of these and apply poultices to them as much as possible even if the conditions of phlebitis are to you or your testifiers as we have said.</end_of_turn
And if the inflammation subsides healed, then cover that you take care of the retention of them in the same way as you powdered over them when they were crushed, if for another reason it does not exist.</end_of_turn
And thus begin to restore the fracture on that same day, and do not prolong it, if it does not happen afterwards.</end_of_turn
But if afterwards it happens that there is swelling, then leave the restoration of them until the swelling has subsided, and do not approach it on the third day or the fourth of all, for you will make things worse.</end_of_turn
But if the fractured bone is prominent over the navel, then cover that you perforate to reduce that and equalize that with your hands as much as possible and with little extension.</end_of_turn
But if the extension is not prepared for you and the equilibrium of them with the thighs is tight, then reduce that with your hands as much as possible and this discomfort which is caused by the iron, the length of which is of seven fingers or eight and the breadth is according to the quantity of the inflammation; and for this the doctor must take into consideration these three or four things according to the quantity that he indicates in the care of all kinds of fractures.</end_of_turn

If the plague persists for several days, and is neither consolidated nor excised from the body, it is understood that here are saturations of the little bodies so that they cover the plague with their attempts. And from those saturations which are separated remain and are extruded, those which are not separated remain and cause pain in the limb, perforate you to make an incision according as your ability allows
And if the plague causes swelling or swelling, it is stasis, or another kind of corruption and putrefaction, the hour covers that you stop when one of these appears from the care that precedes the narration in the previous chapter
And when the thing that I have said must be done and you are present with your foot: when it is great, consider over the limb just as much as the attendants and like those of the great limbs, and do not presume to draw or extract what may be attracted or extracted except for what is absolutely necessary; having left that which must depart, for that which is strong will fall down by itself within a few days or three months; and the hour cures the plague if you see it, and if not, leave that.
Chapter 20.</end_turn>
Of the treatment of swelling which happens in the aftermath of any fracture.
These swelling appear in the aftermath of healing of fracture, and more when they are close to the joints, and are often caused by it the figure of the limb; and the strong limb hinders its natural operation
Then consider if the swelling is recent and administer in this medicine which has stopped so much bleeding, and see, and heartburn, and itching, and swelling, and like those; if you take any of these or all of them, and mix them with vinegar or vinegar of almonds or vinegar of olive oil and apply that over the swelling and compress them tightly.
And leave the extraction that you do not extract for several days; and when you extract that, repeat it until the swelling has gone down; or strengthen over that lamina of lead descent, which has the property of healing all that is swollen in the limbs.
If the swelling has already become stone-like and is stretched, and it is necessary to extract it cautiously, the hour cuts that for the greater part of its circumference, and incisions the surplus, or pulls that which is under the skin until it is healed; and cure that which remains until it is healed
Chapter 21.
Of the restoration of the fracture when it is restored and when almost all of the limb is still stiff and does not act according to its nature.
When a bone fracture has been restored, and when almost all of the limb is still stiff, the hour is of no use except for some causes: of which one is the multitude of solution of the ligament and of the fracture of the limb which does not follow that it covers; or for excessive stricture of the ligaments until the nourishment is prohibited from reaching the limb; or for a multitude of unnecessary embrocation; or for excessive movement at an inappropriate time; or for weakness in the body of the patient and for its weakness.
And the treatment of this is to feed the patient and make him drink until the healing is multiplied in him; and administer bath; and enter with oil and tell him about it.
And leave the foot off the limb, so that the foot does not obstruct the limb from receiving nourishment, or continue to embrocate it with cold water until the nourishment returns to its natural figure
Chapter 22.
Of the treatment of fractured bones when they are restored crookedly and prevents their operation from that which covers them
When the limb has already been restored, and when the healing of the fracture is crooked and prominent at the fractured bone and swelling, and it is for this that the limb is supported in a way that prevents its natural operation, even though the limb is not prohibited from its natural operation, the hour does not cover that you should take away the word of that limb which still exists in this way.
Moreover already many fools of doctors and restorers have done this which has brought about this; and this operation is not to be repeated with great fear of the sign which is mortal.
Moreover if the swelling and the swelling are recent, the hour covers that they are covered with cold water in which there are many cooling herbs, such as fennel seeds and rue seeds, and meadowsweet, and it is like those; or that it is applied with plaster and plaster of Paris like anyone who knows how to do it well; or that it is taken with fennel seeds and is bound with lead or olive oil, and is plastered with that; or that it is taken with fatty figures and is bound with hemp fibers and is like those of the medicines which are not harmful after consolidation
Every day, when there is a persistent and gentle friction of the limbs, which is more agreeable in the hottest weather and administered with movements of the limb throughout the day, it is dissolved.
Even if stiffness has already departed going downwards and is strong, and has become solidified and is caused by necessity for its care, when it is treated with iron, the hour that the pus becomes loosened and the continuity of the bone is dissolved, and it is said that what has overflowed from the swelling of that part which has been infiltrated by the subtle humors of that member is facilitated in that way that it is requested and studied.</end_of_turn>
Chapter XXVIII.</end_of_turn>
Of the term dislocation.</end_of_turn
Dislocation is the displacement of any joint of the limb, because it is prohibited from movement, and is accompanied by the figure of the limb, and causes great pain and lesions.</end_of_turn>
Therefore, when an accident of dislocation occurs, it is necessary to perforate as soon as possible so that it can be reduced, and do not delay, for if it is delayed, the limb becomes swollen and strong, which makes it difficult to reduce the dislocation.</end_of_turn
And to help, do not hold your breath or stretch during the reduction, because these movements cause spasms and pain.</end_of_turn
When an accident occurs, the hour that you must support the patient's fainting, and immediately place it within, and embrace the limb with lukewarm water and oil, and reduce it with ease.</end_of_turn
And all limbs must be treated with the water from which the memory will remain in their limb.</end_of_turn
And I have already ordered the chapters of dislocation according to their order; from the head of the limb up to the foot.</end_of_turn>
Chapter XXVIII.</end_of_turn>
Of the treatment of dislocation of the lower jaw.</end_of_turn
So displaced are the two mandibles if they are not promptly treated; and the dislocation of both is considered to be complete in two ways: that they are slightly displaced from their positions due to little displacement, or that they are completely displaced and complicated, until they are softened at the junction until saliva from the patient's mouth flows and that it does not cause him to close his mouth or to bite, and that his tongue is enveloped in his words.</end_of_turn
When the dislocation is slight, the hour in which it is most convenient returns by itself without causing further damage.</end_of_turn
When the dislocation is complete and complicated, the hour must urgently administer the reduction, and must not be delayed at all.</end_of_turn
And the minister has the head of the patient, and the doctor puts a finger of his hand on the root of the dislocation of the jaw between the teeth of the patient, if the dislocation is of one part; or that he puts two fingers together at the base of the two jaws, if the dislocation is of two parts, and that the other fingers of the patient are far from these and swallow; and commands the patient to stop his jaws and withdraw those that are not necessary; and the doctor swallows the jaw and closes the jaw until it returns to its proper place.</end_of_turn
And if the reduction is difficult, and especially if both jaws are simultaneously displaced, the hour administers evaporation with lukewarm water and oil, until it is finally successful in reducing both of them and does not delay the reduction of both at the same time, as we have said.</end_of_turn
And when they return and are softened, and the patient's mouth is closed and not softened, the hour pauses over those little grains of sand in the corners, and is made with wax and oil rubbed; and it is facilitated with a bandage.</end_of_turn
And let the patient sleep on his two sides, with his head resting between two cushions, so that neither the right side nor the left side is strained; and do not force him to bite anything; have the patient's tongue loosened, until when the pains are gone and the jaws are relaxed, the hour may order that he eat.</end_of_turn
And this is administered with ease, and do not work on the opening of the patient's mouth during eating and drinking and talking, until the jaw is relaxed and healed.</end_of_turn
And if the reduction of two jaws is difficult when they are displaced at any hour and is not converted to the proper positions at that time, the hour must urgently administer fever and strong and constant sweating, and is alerted the patient's belly, and he vomits pure bile.</end_of_turn
When you see it often, you understand that it is harmful; and those who have seen it for a few days know that it will happen to the one to whom it happened in those days.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.</start_of_turn>
And if it is necessary to make points on the surface of the foot, then do so with a pointed cautery.</start_of_turn
The intestine or hernia is returned to its cavity, and the hand is placed over the area to prevent it from coming out.</start_of_turn
You have already opened the space between the patient's thighs, placed a cushion under them, another servant on their legs, and another on their chest, holding their hands.</start_of_turn And nearby close the wound with your palm with a strong closure, so that it returns.</start_of_turn
And nearby place over that plaster and powder and strengthen that.</start_of_turn
May the limb of that one who sits here be preserved and continue like this, not being dislocated in any days; for it has been said that it should be reduced and plastered as has been said and as is appropriate.</start_of_turn
And nearby place over that plaster, powder, and extract, and command the patient to adhere to tranquility and rest until he is healed.</start_of_turn
And in this medicine treatment the limb of the muscle is reduced when it is separated from the thigh bone.</start_of_turn
End of text.</start_of_turn
Of the reduction of the dislocation of the muscle.</start_of_turn
You understand that the muscle is not dislocated except in three ways, of which one is that it is dislocated from the heel to the toes.</start_of_turn
And the second is that it is dislocated from below the muscle, and that is harmful; it is not dislocated to the back for the shoulder; and it is not dislocated to the front for the nerves.</start_of_turn
And most of all it is dislocated outwards beyond the heel towards the toes, especially in those in which there is little flesh, it is easily dislocated; but in those in which there is much flesh, it is difficult to dislocate.</start_of_turn
And often times this happens to people by percussion or by falling, and the muscle of the limb is separated from its attachment by a cautery, and is cured in the way that it has already been dislocated.</start_of_turn
Therefore you must stay until you are satisfied that it is completely cured, and then proceed with the treatment of the limb.</start_of_turn
And it is known that the dislocation of the limb is when it is beyond the heel towards the toes; so that you must distinguish between the dislocated muscle and the sound muscle, for you will find among those differences various signs; and you will find in the head of the muscle a concavity towards the heel as if there were a hole, and the limb is placed against the touch of the head of the muscle as if it were a fist, and the patient is not able to reduce his hand to the groin or to touch that part for any movement.</start_of_turn
If it is dislocated from the heel or from below, and you find it manifested by touch, and it is not hidden.</start_of_turn
And in this dislocation it is beneficial to perform the reduction when it is fresh and the patient is young.</start_of_turn
And the reduction of the limb is that the minister raises the hand of the limb above the heel; and nearby place the toes below the heel of the limb, and raise the joint with strength at its joint, and the minister raises the hand and extends it; and nearby pause that so it returns willingly.</start_of_turn
May it be that what we have said does not return, and so from the beginning of the dislocation, even if it has been a few days, the patient should be bathed in warm water and should be administered embrocation that softens and lubricates just as if it were a coat of oil, and vinegar, and melilot in water, and should be administered.</start_of_turn
And nearby the patient should be rested on the two thighs and should be supported below the heel of the limb while waiting for the swelling to go down between elevation and tension, and nearby the physician should place his hand on the hip and raise the head of the muscle with force, and pull the hand of the patient so that it is not bruised below, and another minister should hold the head of the patient, so that it is not bruised below, for that both will return to the joint.</start_of_turn
If you wish, reduce it in this manner: and let there be a man present who is taller than the patient, and that he stand on that side, and that you insert the thumb of your left hand between the thumb and the great toe of the patient and elevate the great toe to the parts below until the patient's pain is suspended in air, and another attendant shall pull the patient's hand away from the parts below the thumb. Even if the patient is proud, let it be known that we must exclude other causes, for thus will the great one be cured, since the dislocation will return immediately.
And it is reduced in this way: let there be placed on the ground a long stick whose head is rounded like a nutmeg, neither fat nor lean, and let it be placed under the patient; for since the head of the stick covers the head of the patient, the patient will be standing according to the length of the stick, and let the hand of the patient be extended to the parts below the other side; and let the body of the patient be stretched out on the other side with force, for the joint will return to its place with speed.
And if it is difficult to reduce it by all the causes that we have said, then use this remedy: take a stick whose length is equal to two barleycorns and whose width is that of four fingers, and whose thickness is lessened at the tip like this: ...
And place over the rounded head some lead plates to prevent the stick from injuring the patient.</start_of_turn>
And let the thumb of the patient be placed under the stick, and let the hand or arms be extended over the stick until the parts below are reached, and let the stick be bound over the attendants and the arms and the limb of the hand.</start_of_turn
And let the arms be placed on a stool of the height of the patient, and let the hand be extended to the parts below, and the other side be suspended from the other part, so that the joint is reduced immediately.</start_of_turn
And when the reduction is complete according to any method that you deem suitable, and when the thumb has been placed with care at a distance from the bone of the great toe; and let there be applied a compress prepared from powdered chaff and alum on the entire muscle, even though it is rotated downwards, and let there be stretching of the thumb with tension downwards; and let the ligament be rotated over the compress, and let the hand be fixed to the limb, and let it be kept quiet for seven days.
And let the patient abstain from food little, until the limb is comfortable, for this is more conducive to the healing of the limb.
And let the food be given more often, every seven or eight days, and let some exercise be performed; and thus if it is stopped and is not mollified, the hour is already healed.</start_of_turn>
However, if the joint is dislocated by moisture that has happened to it or by another cause, the hour must be cauterized with three incisions, as is said in the chapter of cautery.</start_of_turn
And if all this has been done and seven days have passed, and the ligament has been dislocated and the joint has not been arrested, and the compress and the tension have been reduced over them as much as possible, and it is not arrested and does not recover and cannot elevate the limb to the parts below, the hour knows that the nerves of the limb, which are at the head of the muscle, are either insensible, extended or softened, and knows that the joint will never be fixed in place again.</start_of_turn
As for the dislocation of that which is caused by the foot or the ankle or the heel, the reduction is useful with impulse and extension of the most, until it returns.</start_of_turn
And let it be administered in this other way, and take care that it is healed.</start_of_turn
And if it happens that the healing of the gravity in the limb is delayed and the movement of the limb is delayed, the hour recommends using cold compresses until that gravity is relieved and returns to its former state.</start_of_turn
Chapter XXVII.</start_of_turn>
Of treatment for dislocation of the ankle.</start_of_turn
You know that the ankle joint is dislocated with difficulty and returns with difficulty; and that which is dislocated in all parts, and more especially on the outer side towards the inner side, and the dislocation of the ankle is not hidden from you because it is known beyond that it is present whenever the ankle is adjusted, and when the ankle is adjusted it is known that the joint is depressed and the limb cannot be bent, nor can the hand touch the same muscle.
And cover the testicles, and reduce the dislocation as much as possible before applying the cautery, for if you see the cautery applied directly, the reduction will be difficult, and may not be successful; and this is especially true when it occurs in the groin, for in this case the pain is greater and the testicles are often seen to be swollen to the point of death.
The restoration of them, when it is possible to reduce it, is that the patient's hand be extended towards the toes, their arms be spread out, and the physician's thumbs be placed over the groin and leave them there, and the patient grasps the joint with their teeth, or at the root of their palm within which the pain has occurred
Moreover, if the dislocation is in the front, then return it as soon as possible by bending the knee with your hand, until you have pierced the groin at the root of the palm
And if the dislocation does not obey the reduction, then administer violent extension and great force.
And that two assistants extend the arms, and hold that support of two assistants so that it is not left behind the extension
And immediately rotate the arms all around, since it is enveloped firmly long over the hand, or ligament
And when the physician touches the joint with his hand, anoint it with some oil so that those things which help to lubricate the joint may be facilitated; and immediately compress the joint with force until it returns
And immediately after the reduction cover that it is stopped on that plaster in which there is styptic action and exudation with the help of glue, and extend it with stricture descending, and suspend the arm from the collar, and leave it thus for a few days.
And so if the joint is formed in the knee joint, then immediately you unfasten the ligament of it and leave it thus
And if the joint is not strengthened, then immediately repeat the plaster and the ligament, and leave it thus for a few days until it is removed; and then unfasten that
Moreover, if by chance the gravity tends towards the reduction of the joint, and the situation of the limb is in movement, then administer moisture in oil and gentle friction, and compression, until it is relieved; or rest on the joint relaxed, so that there is no greasy movement; and bind it, and leave it so for the day and night. And so on, put that in oil; and when the swelling subsides, the physician must gently massage the joint with temperate friction, and immediately repeat over that relaxed, so is round of movement, a little swelling, and the second, and the third, etcetera Corruption has already spread throughout the bones within the bath, until it has become limp.</end_of_turn>
And if you wish, rest upon that wound of the wet and scaly cow, around the border and over that; and make some swellings, because that is wet and reduces the swelling to its situation
Chapter XXVIII.
On the care of dislocation of the elbow, that is between the arm and the hand.
The swelling of the hand many times is displaced, and the reduction of the dislocation is easy, and the opposite is true of the other joints, however it is necessary to have speed in the reduction of it in the hour in which it is displaced, before the limb is apostematized or that the cautery is applied to it
And the reduction of the dislocation of the limb is that you rest the wrist of the patient on a table and extend the limb, and the physician places his hand or palm on the area of the joint, and compresses that until it returns to its normal position
However, it must be considered if the palm is already bent inward of the hand, then the patient must be supported with two hands on a table during the extension and reduction; and if the dislocation is previous, you must support the limb with two hands, so that the physician's hand grasps that area of the joint
And so if it returns completely, well and good; and if not, the physician must strengthen that with plaster leaving the apostema; and do not repeat that until some days have passed
However, the joint must remain flexible according to its nature; and do not notice to the patient any cause, but that the hand is softened and cannot strengthen any cause; the physician should know that the nerves are cut or twisted, and that it is not due to the joint itself but is strengthened by the cautery which is applied to it and the force that is given to it.
Therefore when the illness has subsided, pause over them the plaster which we have recommended, and leave it on for five days; and then remove it and leave it off, and exercise their hand.
Even if their movement is painful and difficult, leave them in a warm and humid environment, until the pain subsides

On the treatment of dislocation of the joints
Some joints are dislocated throughout their entirety.
And when any finger of those which are at the base or at the belly is dislocated, then stop and impede the dislocation by placing a thumb against it until it returns
And support the head of the finger, suspend the part that is dislocated, and keep that limb for two days
And suspend it and extend it until it is healed in that limb on the following day
And when night comes, bind it as before according to that narration, and do not cease to loosen it in the day and exercise it, and bind it at night; and do this for several days until it is healed
And do the same with the thumb, if it is dislocated at the base of the hand, and bind it to that part and do the first operation as before until it is healed
And do the same with the rest of the joints that are dislocated

On the treatment of dislocation of the vertebrae of the spine.
When an accident occurs to any of the vertebrae of the spine or the head is dislocated completely, and some vertebrae move from their places, in such a case there is no cure, for death is hidden in the disease
And a sign of this is that the evacuation of the disease is outside of one's will, and one cannot hold it back; and some veins are softened in some parts of the limb or two veins of the limb or two bones of the limb, or one of these; or one vertebra is displaced from its place, which if some veins are displaced and some are softened, the evacuation of these is four parts.
Therefore that which has already been displaced to the back is called gelliosis
Moreover, the treatment for this is that you consider if the gelliosis is from puberty, for in this case neither cure nor healing of all is possible
Moreover, in those cases where we perceive the case either by observation or by percussion or by experience, the Ancients themselves have declared long methods of treatment, of which the most useful returns to profit; however, I have already said that I abbreviate this from that which is more lengthy, because of my proximity to the understanding of this, which I have learned from experience and from various instruments which I have seen and used.
And that which is not cured except that which originates in the two vertebrae themselves as I have recommended
And that the disease be extended over its face over the chest and be held from below so that it does not touch the foot of the limb
And put a tube which has been torn through to the root near the head of the limb, and another tube in the belly of the limb in the other foot
And the minister has the tube, and do not hold it in a fossa; and another minister has the other in that form
And put a cover over the head of the disease and leave the limbs limp; and extend the limb to the tube which is at the head of the limb, and bind that; and strengthen the other limb over the hips of the limb which is below them, and bind the limbs; and adjust all the bands and bind them to the other tube which is at the foot of the limb
And the minister orders to extend the limb to the part of the tube, and do not displace the two tubes and the bands of the remaining vertebrae in the places where they are placed, however do not stop them as we have said.
And the doctor rests his palms on the vertebra with strength until it returns, or rest them on a board, and adjust on the board the two feet until it returns
If he does not return in this way, take a table whose breadth or length is three cubits, and pierce it through the wall at the place where we said that for this ailment a mark has been made. And place the palm of the table on the spine, the doctor places his feet on the other side, and open the belly until the spine is contracted and returns to its place.</end_of_turn>
And if you wish, open the one that is twisted with your hand; and since you are on the ground, place the head of the patient behind the heel of the two thumbs, the length of which is one cubit, and place the head of them behind the heel of the thumb at a distance of two cubits; and let the length be between each thumb a palm, and there is already made in each thumb through which the return has been made, and every one that is not fixed to the ground must be held down so that it is not injured.</end_of_turn>
And there must be a round fist through which the return has been made, and it must be twisted in the two grooves of the two thumbs.</end_of_turn>
And at the end of these there is a groove in which the fist is formed, the length of which is a palm beyond that which is twisted; and in the two other thumbs it is similar to that.</end_of_turn
And tighten the ligaments that you have stretched in the feet of the patient at the point where you placed the head of them, and the ligaments that you have stretched in the thighs of them at the point where you placed their feet.</end_of_turn
And you must also hold every return and have a minister who will hold the return with his hand, and the doctor will bind the spine as we have said.</end_of_turn>
And when the spine is returned and the place is bound, the hour covers that it should be kept pressed with an ointment of oil, and then stop; and place over the ointment the table whose breadth is three fingers or about that, and the length of it as much as covers the area of the swelling, and over the part of the spine that is.
And do as we have said concerning the ligament, and use the patient sparingly of food until they are healed.</end_of_turn>
And if any swelling remains in the place at the end of the healing, the hour covers that medicines which soften and soothe must be administered with the administration of the table for a long time, which we have recommended; and they are already administered in that place like molten lead.</end_of_turn>
And every vein that is close to the back of the two spines, is cured for that dislocation; and that is the bone which has already mentioned that it must not be made faulty by this medicine, for it will cause you to do great harm.</end_of_turn

On the treatment of a dislocated ankle.</end_of_turn
You must know that the joint of the ankle and the joint of the muscle must not be dislocated alone, but that it must accompany the dislocation of the other joints of the foot away from the concavity.
The ankle joint is dislocated in four ways, that is, towards the inside, or towards the outside, or towards the front, or towards the back.</end_of_turn
Most frequently it is dislocated towards the inside, and less frequently towards the front or towards the back.</end_of_turn
The sign of the dislocation towards the inside is that, when you adjust the limb of the healthy ankle with the limb of the sick ankle, the heel is more prominent than the healthy one, the ankle cannot bend the foot downwards without causing pain, and the area around the ankle is already swollen from the previous burn of the cautery.</end_of_turn
The sign of the dislocation towards the outside is that the accident occurs in the opposite way to this one.</end_of_turn
The sign of the dislocation towards the front is that the limb is expanded according to custom, but it does not bend downwards because of the pain, and if you force it to do so, it cannot move forward; the urine is retained and the swelling is considerable, and you must walk on the ankle.</end_of_turn
The sign of the dislocation towards the back is that it does not expand the heel, nor does it permit bending downwards that which bends the ankle, and the limb is shorter than the other, the swelling is softened, and the head of the ankle is placed on that place.</end_of_turn
May reduction of this dislocation is that you consider, for if the dislocation is old and ancient, that it has already passed its prime in that it has not responded to previous treatments; therefore, in such a case, it is not necessary to perform any further reduction.
If the dislocation is recent and belongs to the four principal types, then you must promptly restore the joint and extend it towards the inner and outer parts, and also towards the right and left, until firm stability returns and no further treatment is required
If it does not return in this manner, then you must prepare to administer force and extend the limb beyond its normal position, or towards the chest, or towards the thighs which are bound together; and another attendant should grasp the limb beyond its nails and support its tips with his thumbs; and press firmly with the thumb on the root of the limb, and have another attendant hold the extremities of the limb.
And the extension of the limb or of the inner part towards the ankle or of the outer part towards the heel or from the back towards the groin.
And the extension of all of these until the patient's body is elevated to the height of the ground and remains suspended
And this kind of extension is common to all four types
Therefore, if the dislocation returns as we have said, then it is well done; but if not, then it is necessary in all four types to make the cure as we have said
In the reduction of the dislocation itself, when it is displaced, and the dislocation is at the ankle, cover that the patient is resting supine on the buttocks; and press the ligaments over the root of the limb in the place where it enters between the head of the malleolus and the place that is beyond the ankle; and extend the limb from the ankle to the knee bone.
And another attendant must firmly grasp the patient's toes and gently pull the large part of the painful limb outwards for violent extension, until it returns to its place
This type of treatment is less severe than the others for which this limb is reduced
If it is excused about you and you do not obey the order in this type of treatment, then you must tightly bind the two feet of the patient together with strong thread, with tension, over both the ankle bones and both the nails
And the length of each part should be equal to the quantity of four fingers, and the painful limb should be extended more than the other by the quantity of two fingers
And the patient should be suspended about the waist, and that is in the middle; and the length from the ground to the top should be equal to the quantity of two fists
And command a a strong youth to press down on the head of the malleolus, and that the patient is suspended by the other youth, and the other youth will push the limb downwards with force, until the joint returns to its place quickly
And in the proper reduction of the dislocation, when it is displaced at the outer part, cover that the patient grasps his heel according to what we have recommended when we applied the gel; and tighten the ligament over the painful limb properly and over the toes of the limb
And two cushions should be placed, one under the patient's feet, and the other under the head; and cushions of the same size should be placed around the waist of the limb which is covered with a wet cloth, so that the patient is not dampened because the cushion is between the patient's thighs, because you must extend the limb outwards without causing tension.
And each attendant should extend their hand, and the doctor with his hand grasps the reduction according to the art
And when the dislocation is at the ankle, then it must be grasped with greater tension; and as is said in this book about the thigh; and the doctor must place the palm of his right hand on the painful ankle, and with the other hand grasp that which is at the other ankle, and with that grasp pause that which is extended towards the toes from the ankle bone.
And if the dislocation is at the back, it is not necessary to extend the limb towards the toes, but to elevate it above the ground; having covered that it must be supported with a firm support, just as it is with the dislocation of the limb towards the outer part, as we have said of its support on two fingers; and is on its face and the ligaments are extended, as we have said, without any discomfort
The joint is to be covered with a compress made of wool on the area where the pain is located.
Therefore, when the reduction is complete as mentioned above, the sign of the reduction is not hidden from you; extend two fingers from the patient's abdomen, and when you once again grasp them and the patient pulls their hand away and expands their wound, then you will know that the limb is returned as it should be—and you will adjust two cushions and stop pressing and pull away the bandage so that the width is not damaged in any part; and adhere the patient to rest for three days or four.
Then remove the ligature and the dressing, and compare one limb with the other.
When you see them swell up in the wound, then you know that the dislocation has stopped, and then leave the patient alone.
And if you see any cause of discomfort, return it and plaster that, and remove that according to your first order, and leave that for three days.
Then remove that, and make that walk slowly for a few days, until they are comfortable

Treatment for dislocation of the thumb.</start_of_turn>
The thumb is dislocated in three ways, that is, dislocation to the outer parts, dislocation to the inner parts, and dislocation to the upper parts from the lower parts; and it is not dislocated to the lower parts.
The sign of dislocation is that the patient points to the area with their hand; when you know that the thumb is dislocated
And the restoration of all these positions is that you make the patient draw their hand back, even if they extend their limb again; put two cushions under their leg and put their foot between the thighs; and in addition make them adhere the thumb to their palms and hold that part between the thumb and the other fingers with strength, and another servant will extend the limb until the thumb returns to its place
The sign of healing is that their limb adheres to the cushion without pain.
Then plaster that and make them adhere the limb to the cushion, and tie those together with a bandage for three days or four, and then remove those.
Do not let the patient walk for a few days, until they are healthy and comfortable
If the reduction is made by you is excused, then administer strong extension to the ligaments that have preceded the narration in the treatment of the swelling.

Treatment for dislocation of the ankle.</start_of_turn
The ankle joint is sometimes sprained for slight displacement, and sometimes dislocated in compliance, and the dislocation can be either upwards or downwards
The sign of dislocation is that sometimes the ankle swells up proceeding from the part where it is dislocated
The treatment for displacement is gentle reduction, that is, to extend it easily with the most, and to swell up until it returns
But in the treatment of dislocation in compliance, cover that the patient draw their hand back, and keep that part in the middle of the limb in two fingers of that hand
And put your right hand on the upper part of the foot and your left hand on the lower part of the foot at the ankle joint
And pull the foot towards your right hand, and towards your left for two fingers, and extend your left; and support the ankle of the foot with your right hand at the back of the limb
Do it as we have said above.</start_of_turn>
And support the foot at the ankle joint for the third time, and you are at the ankle joint.</start_of_turn>
So if it returns once or twice by following this method, and if sometimes the foot swells up, it is good; otherwise, repeat the operation until it returns.</start_of_turn
But if you are forbidden to reduce it in this way, make the patient lie on their side on the ground, and stretch a cushion on the ground, and put a cushion between their thighs, and you have already bound them around the limb like this for so that the patient does not move.
The minister of the patient holds their thighs, and another minister grasps the foot towards their toes or the ligament that lies over the heel; and another minister extends each of the hands against the extension of the knee, and the paymaster remains between the patient's thighs to prevent their limbs from being stretched too far from their natural position.
Then the doctor embraces the dislocation at the knee and another minister holds the sound limb at the thighs, so that the dislocation returns easily
And thus when the dislocation has returned and you have declared the reduction to be complete, then remove the plaster and stretch the ligament firmly, and bind the foot to the limb.
Beware that you fear or guard the nerves that lie behind the heel, for the ligament over that must not be strained too much and must not be led too tightly
And thus keep it for two days or three; and if the ligament is softened, remove it
And thus remove it on the fourth day or the fifth, and prohibit the patient from bending their knee for forty days. Even if it is forced to walk before that space has healed, it is not harmful security that the dislocation has not dissolved and become corrupted, and that it will not receive healing treatment
And if after this the patient has a relapse of the pain, cover that you administer in the cessation of the aforementioned narrative in another place of care and support, until it is healed.
Chapter 134.</start_of_turn>
On the treatment of dislocation of the toes of the feet.
When it has been dislocated, it must be embraced with little extension of the limb; and what is not difficult, be cautious
If the dislocation is on the ankle bone of the two toes of the foot, then cover that you must keep the patient’s foot still on the ground or on a table, and remain in this position as if walking were taking place
And thus keep your feet still, and hold the foot over what has been mentioned concerning the joints, and raise that which is over the foot until it has healed, and that you see that it has healed and does not reappear in the immediate vicinity
And thus place under the belly of the foot of the patient a board that supports the entire foot, which has two caps, and strengthen that which is stretched downwards and closed for three days; and then remove it and let them walk again for a month, until it is healed and the recovery is ensured

Of the kinds of dislocations that are caused by swelling or fracture or any other injury
When any of these causes occurs, and you take care of the treatment and restoration of that, without seeing these things, misfortune often follows death
And thus do not presume that because of the treatment you will succeed, but rather that one who is skilled in the art, of long practice, merciful and humble, tardy, not proud or presumptuous; and that you should use in the beginning of medicines that bring relief rather than those that only cause harm, and listen to the patient’s complaints, not to your own expectations, for in this way will appear any hope of recovery, both for the alleviation of the disease and for the restoration of health. And thus do your utmost to effect the reduction in the beginning of the cause, before any relapse occurs
And thus if the limb returns as we wish, then administer an antidote that will cause the swelling to subside and care for the wound as is appropriate in these cases of dehydration
And if the dislocation is on a fractured bone of the heel bone, and the bone is fractured in two places, then you must break the ligament between them, and do as has been said in the simple diseases of these bones.
Observe and abstain from doing what you are afraid of, following my prediction; for what is better for you than the Creator Himself, and may your permanence be for His glory, and may your prayer be accepted at the right time Thus ends the discourse of Albucasim perfectly, for which God be praised. Amen.</start_of_turn>
