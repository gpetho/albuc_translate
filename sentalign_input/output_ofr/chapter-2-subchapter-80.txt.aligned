of the fistula of the anus/rectum Fistulas that occur below the anus are swellings, and growths that appear near the anus outside, or in the space between the two buttocks, where there is one fistula or several; and when this swelling is old, it opens, and releases a whitish watery fluid or thin pus, and sometimes these fistulas are perforated; and they are recognized because there is a discharge or gas when the patient defecates, and perhaps a worm comes out.	Fistulae in the lower parts are a knotting and thickening of the tissues occurring externally near the anus or in the perineum to one side. A fistula may be single or multiple. When a thickening of this kind has become chronic it opens and there flows out a white watery humidity or thin pus. These fistulae may be perforating into the rectum or bowel, or non-perforating.	0.8326249
And there are fistulas that penetrate to the bladder, and to the middle of the penis; and reach the hip joint, and even to the base of the spine.	Sometimes also there are fistulae occurring in the perineum which penetrate to the urinary bladder and to the urethra; and some also penetrate to the hip-joint and to the coccyx.	0.7423489
And thus one recognizes the penetrating fistula in the anus, and the non-penetrating one: you insert your index finger into the anus, and insert a thin needle of brass or iron into the fistula when there is no tortuosity/winding path.	A fistula penetrating to the anus may also be distinguished from one not so penetrating by introducing the finger into the anus and a fine probe into the fistula, made of either bronze or iron, if there be no bend in the course of the fistula.	0.76023364
And if there is a winding path, insert a thin lead probe, or a horsehair, until you feel the probe or the hair with your finger; and if you don't feel it, and no excrement, gas, or worm comes out of the opening, as we have said: know that it is not perforated; so hurry to treat it.	But if the course of the fistula be tortuous, then introduce a thin leaden probe or a horse-hair, until you feel the probe or horse-hair come on to your finger. But if you do not feel it at all and if no faeces nor flatus nor worm come out of the opening, as we said, you may know it is not perforating; so hurry on with treatment.	0.8670286
And when the fistula penetrates to the bladder or to the urethra, urine comes out of it, and it cannot be healed by medicines.	When the fistula penetrates to the bladder or the urinary passages it is signified by the passage of urine and by the fact that medical remedies cannot cure it.	0.81111866
If it is perforated to the hip joint, the probe will reach the place; if there is no winding path, and the origin of the pain is around it, then pus constantly comes out of it, and neither medicine nor healing by ointment is effective; and in these penetrating fistulas there is no cure other than work, and the vanity of foolish physicians who meddle with them.	But if it penetrate to the hip-joint or coccyx, this will be signified by the probe's passing right through to there if it be a straight passage to the bone; and by the pain felt in that part; and by the chronic purulent discharge; and the fact that medical treatment does no good and ointment does not heal it. There is in these perforating sinuses no cure whatever; and their treatment is labour in vain for all the ignorant doctors who pretend that they understand them.	0.7922162
In one that is not perforated and not old, there is hope of healing by iron, as I have experienced, and the patient should lie on their back between your hands; and lift their legs up to their thighs, with their thighs bent towards their stomach; then insert a brass probe, or lead if there is a winding path, until you know where the probe reaches.	But there is hope in operative treatment for those that are not perforating and chronic, as I know from experience and shall now describe. Thus: have the patient lying on his back before you and let both his legs be raised with the thighs flexed back upon his belly; then introduce a probe of bronze, or of lead if the course be tortuous, until you determine where the probe reaches.	0.8308317
If the patient feels it around the anus, then you should insert your index finger, and feel if the probe has pierced through; and if it is exposed where you feel the tissue or flesh between your finger, then know that it is perforated; so do not work on it because it cannot be healed.	Then, if the patient feel the probe somewhere in the region of the anus, put your forefinger into the anus. If you feel the probe itself with your finger, coming through bare, and you do not feel anything interposing between your finger and the probe, either membrane or flesh, then you may know for certain that it is a perforating fistula; do not spend your energy over it, for, as we have said, there is no cure.	0.86655575
It is said however that some can be healed, but this happens rarely; and the help that one gives, is to heat a thin cautery according to the width of the fistula, as mentioned before; and insert it hot into the fistula, until it comes close to the anus; and do this two or three times, until you know that the diseased flesh is burned, which resembles a bird's feather; and then treat it with tents soaked in butter, until this flesh comes out, then treat it with ointment that generates flesh and heals.	Yet some have said that it may be cured in certain cases, but rarely. The treatment from which some relief may be hoped is to heat a fine cautery corresponding to the width of the fistula, as we have said before, and pass this, hot, through the fistula to the anus; then repeat this two or three times until you know that all those compact tags of superfluous flesh, which resemble quills, are burnt away. Then dress with a pad soaked in oil until the burnt tissue comes away.	0.8900862
If it is thus healed, that is good.	Then treat with healing ointments and, if it heals, well and good.	0.5565312
If it cannot be healed otherwise; and if the probe enters, but does not pierce through to the finger which is in the anus, and there is a thick covering of flesh or tissue between your finger and the probe, and you see the fistula at what covers the opening; then cut it from the beginning of the fistula, and insert the probe further, and then the cautery after it, until it reaches the end of the probe; and the probe will be released, and will fall out; then clean the diseased flesh that resembles a bird's feather, and leave nothing remaining.	If not, it will never heal with any other treatment. If you introduce the probe and it does not come through to your finger in the anus, and there be between your finger and the probe something firm interposing, either tissue or lining, and you see the fistula to be close under the skin, then cut open the skin at the origin of the fistula and continue your incision, with the probe in the fistula, until you come to the place where the tip of the probe has reached and the probe is freed and falls out. Then clean out all the solid quill-like pieces of tissue and let none remain.	0.8992003
And if the blood overcomes you, and flows between you and the work, then cauterize it with fire or a sharp medicine.	If the haemorrhage be too much for you and interferes with your operating when cutting away the tissues, then the best and most speedily efficacious thing you can do is to cauterize, either with fire or with caustics.	0.6064999
For the fire cautery combines two good things: that is, the burning of the diseased flesh, and the stopping of blood and the drying of moisture; then treat it with tents soaked in butter or in mashed things, until the place oozes pus, and the burned flesh comes out in the pus; then treat the wound with healing ointments generating hard flesh, and these are dry medicines.	For cauterizing with fire unites two good characteristics, the burning away of those superfluous tissues, and the stanching of the bleeding, as well as the drying-up of humidity. Then treat with a dressing soaked in butter, or sulphur pounded with oil, until the place putrefies and the burnt tissue comes away in the pus. Then treat the wound with salves to encourage healing and the growth of firm flesh, these remedies having also a styptic and drying quality.	0.8428198
For when it is restored, it is healed and does not return.	Then when the wound is healed over it is cured for good and there is no fear of a recurrence.	0.52148736
And if a fistula goes deep into the anus, and is far from the opening, then put your finger in the anus, and investigate it.	If the fistula reaches deep into the anus and is far from the surface of the body, then put your finger into the anus and palpate.	0.78096867
And sometimes fistulas are like this: that is when you put the tent in the fistula, and it is on the side of the anus next to the skin above, so take a tent pierced at the end in this way: And put a twisted thread in two, and push the tent with the thread into the fistula until it reaches the end.	Sometimes also a fistula is cut out in this way: namely, you pass a probe into the fistula; it should be near the circle of the junction of the outer skin with the anal mucosa; then take a probe with an eyed point like a shoemaker's needle; put into it a thread twisted of about five threads, and insert into the fistula until it reaches the end.	0.7629394
If it is piercing the edge of the anus inside, then pull the thread from that hole, so that you put your finger in the anus; and pull the end of the thread, and bring the two ends together, and tie one to the other, and leave it for a day or two; and tighten it sometimes, until the thread cuts the flesh that is between them, and it falls off; then treat the wound until it is closed and healed.	If it has perforated through at the anal margin within, nearby, draw the thread out of that perforation by introducing your finger into the anus. Draw out the end of the thread and tie the two ends together and leave for one or two days. As the thread cuts into the tissues, tighten it up well until those tissues enclosed in the thread are cut through and fall away. Then dress the wound until it be healed and sound.	0.8827537
If the fistula does not pierce, make it pierce by all means that you can, unless it is too deep. For it is not appropriate to make the thread cut so deep, and then treat it, as we have said, until it is healed.	If the mouth of the fistula is not perforated, perforate it as best you can, unless the depth is too great; in which case you must not do so lest you cut the muscle. Then treat as we have said until it heals.	0.90673864
The shape of the pointed scalpel with which one cuts the fistula is very sharp on one side and cutting; and not on the other, so that one does not cut what one should not cut, as you see here:	Figure of the sharp-pointed scalpel for cutting open fistulae; the curved edge should be exceedingly sharp and the other blunt, lest you cut what should not be cut, as you see.	0.81595147
