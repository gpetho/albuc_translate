Regarding fistula wherever it may be
Know that every wound or abscess, when it becomes old, is universally called "fistula",
and especially when it is deep and discharges pus.
And fistula is according to its nature a hardened and white scar tissue, where no pain is felt,
and it is as deep as a bird's feather;
and sometimes clear pus comes out, and other times thick;
sometimes little, and other times a lot;
and I have already spoken of it in the division of wounds, that any wound that is not healed, and there is no flesh,
it is only because of one of the eight causes:
that is, due to the small amount of blood in the body;
or because of its malignancy;
or because there is hard flesh inside, and on the edges, that does not allow flesh to grow;
or there is too much pus;
or the place is decayed, and the material is of poor quality;
or the medicine is not good in the treatment;
or because the corruption is of a pestilential nature;
or because in that region digestion is slow, and health is slow, and it swells by nature;
or there are veins or bones:
and I have already shown all these causes, and the signs, and the cures of medicines in the division.
Now I must tell you about the cure of fistula done by manual work.
Know that fistula occurs in all parts of the body;
because there are fistulas that come to the large veins, and to the arteries, and to the nerves,
or to the membrane, or to the intestine, or to the bladder, or to some of the ribs,
or to the spine, or to any joint of the hands or feet;
and some that come to the principal part of the member, and to similar places.
And all fistulas of this kind are difficult to heal, and there is nothing but labor, and ignorance;
and if there is a fistula that does not reach the place I mentioned, and you have confidence in the cure,
and you want to know it, then take a bronze or iron probe, if the fistula is straight, search it;
and if the fistula is twisted, search it with a fine lead probe,
because lead bends well around the twists;
and if the fistula has many openings and you cannot search it well with probes,
then give it an enema through one of the openings,
because the moisture runs from one opening to another, and cleans it;
then search it carefully as best you can, to know if there is bone or nerve, and it is deep,
and ask the patient well about the pain he feels when you press with your hand, and where he feels it;
and when you truly know where it is, and if it is far from a joint, or nerve, or artery or vein,
or in any of the places I mentioned, then cut it as I told you,
and remove the scar tissue and the decayed flesh inside;
and then treat it until it is healed,
and if the fistula is very deep in the right place, it is necessary to cut it deeply, as much as you can,
then put tents soaked in medicine, and insert them to the end of the fistula,
so that the medicine corrodes the excess remaining at the bottom;
then apply ointments that generate healthy flesh, until it is healed;
and if it is not healed by this, then cauterize it as we have said,
and if the bone is corrupted by the fistula, cut it.
If vein or nerve does not hinder you or principal members, as we have said;
and if the bone is exposed, and there is corruption and blackness, scrape it until all the corruption is removed,
then treat it with things that generate flesh until it is healed;
and if it is not healed, and discharges pus as before,
know that you have not gone to the bottom:
so uncover and search until you reach the bottom,
and remove all the corruption, then restore the place;
and if it is healed this way, it is good.
If not, know that the corruption is too deep for you to reach;
there is no other means but to leave it to nature;
and if there is a small corrupted bone, and you can pull it with forceps,
pull it with an appropriate instrument,
and if there are many bones, pull them all, do not leave even one;
and if the moisture is against you, and there is no error or fear,
then cut both the moisture and flesh, and free the bones.
And if you cannot remove them in one hour, then apply to the wound something that generates decay,
and leave it until the place is decayed around the bones,
and then the bones will be easier to extract;
and if it is a large bone, like from the leg or thigh,
scrape only the corruption until all the blackness is removed,
then restore the wound;
and if there is a large part of the corrupted, and it reaches the marrow of the bone;
it is necessary to saw and cut until the corruption, and then treat it until it is healed;
and I will tell you about a fistula that occurred to a man on his leg,
so that you may take example and help in your work.
He was a young man around 30 years old, who had pain in his leg from a cause that came from inside the body,
until the substances came to the leg, and it was swollen with a large abscess, and there was no external cause to open;
but the doctors by their folly opened the abscess,
and much matter flowed out, and it became a fistula, and many openings discharged pus and moisture from the body;
and many doctors treated it for about two years, and there was no one skilled in the art of hands,
until I was called, and I saw his leg and the medicines used to treat him,
and what flowed through the openings with great force;
and the young man's body was becoming red, and he had a yellowish color.
I placed a probe in one of these openings, and then searched all the openings,
and I found that one came against the other from all parts of the leg.
I then hastened, and cut in one of the openings until I uncovered a part of the bone,
and I found it corrupted and perforated, and the corruption reached the bone inside;
I sawed what appeared to be the corrupted bone, and thought there was no other corruption, except what I removed;
and I began to restore the wound with healing medicines for a long time, and it could not heal;
and then I started again, and uncovered the bone as before,
and found the corruption continued in the bone, and I sawed it, and then removed it, and tried to heal the place;
but I could not until I cut around a palm of the bone, and pulled it out with its marrow,
then restored it with medicines; and it healed and sealed quickly,
and did not need to restart the work except for the weakness of the patient, who could not endure,
and for the fear of death that I had for him.
Because due to the evacuation he often cried, but he was completely healed,
and a hard flesh grew in place of the bone, and it was of good disposition and had no harm or contradiction at all, neither in walking nor in coming.
And if the bone is broken in any place in the body, it is necessary to saw it in this manner:
take a strap, and tie it to the end of the exposed bone,
and command someone to stretch it up;
and place another woolen strap thicker than the first strap, and tie it over the flesh that is over the bone,
and stretch the end, so that you pull the corrupted flesh below,
and uncover the flesh over the place where you want to saw, so that the saw does not hurt the flesh;
and place a splint or a board under the bone to cut the corrupted flesh;
and it is necessary to saw as long as one can see and feel the corruption, and saw again another time.
And if the bone is corrupted, and not visible, and the corruption is in the middle or in one part,
then uncover all the flesh; then place a splint under,
and then saw from one part to the other the corruption, and let the sawing be a little longer than the corruption, as we have said;
and if the corruption is in the joint, cut the corrupted joint, and saw the bone where it connects on the other side;
and if the corruption is in the connection of the two joints, there is no other way but to cut;
and if the corruption is in the wrist of the hand, or the ankle of the foot, it is very difficult,
but nevertheless it is necessary to inquire about the corrosion, how it appears;
and clean it in all the ways you can, but make sure the veins or nerves do not contradict you;
and know that the cutting instruments and saws for cutting these bones are many, according to the setting of the bones and the appearance of the bones,
and their thickness and delicacy, and their size and smallness, and their hardness;
and therefore it is necessary to prepare the appropriate instrument for each kind of work;
and know that the work will show you the instrument you need, according to the knowledge of this art,
and the testimony of the kinds of diseases;
so consider the instrument you need according to what is required.
