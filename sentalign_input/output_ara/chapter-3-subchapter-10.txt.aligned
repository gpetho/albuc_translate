On the reduction of hip fracture.	On setting a fractured hip.	0.6898624
Hip bones rarely break. If they do break, the break is usually a fragmentation at the ends and a longitudinal split, and it tilts inward. The patient experiences pain in the area, throbbing, and numbness in the leg on the side of the fracture.	It is rare indeed that hip-bones are fractured, and if they are fractured the fracture consists of a comminution of the extremities of them and a longitudinal splitting and a bending inward; and the patient feels a pain and a piercing at the site, and the leg on the fractured side is benumbed.	0.8949082
Its reduction is by passing your hand over it until you determine the shape of the fracture. If the fracture is only at the ends, then reduce that fracture as best you can until its shape resembles its natural shape.	To set it, you pass your hand over it and ascertain what the shape of the fracture is. If it is a fracture of the extremity only, set that fracture in whatever manner is convenient for you until it answers to its proper shape.	0.7828859
If the fracture is longitudinal or if it has tilted inward, then lay the patient on his stomach so that you can reduce that fracture. Once you have reduced it, apply the dressing, then place a splint of wood or leather on it and bandage it tightly.	But if it be a longitudinal fracture or it has bent inwards, have the patient lie on his stomach so as to make it convenient for setting the fracture; and when you have set it apply over it a plaster and over that a splint of wood or leather, and bandage it in such wise that you have no fear that the fracture may extend or the splint slip.	0.82076985
Do not fear displacement of the fracture or loosening of the splint. Level the hollows at the flanks with whatever fills them so that the bandaging is even. Instruct the patient to lie on his back or on his healthy side. If a hot swelling appears...	Level out the cavity of the lumbar region with some filling so that it may take the bandage evenly, and bid the patient sleep on his back or on his sound side.	0.607762
stop extending it and reducing it until the hot swelling subsides. Apply what will soothe it as described previously, then return to its reduction and bandage it as appropriate.  If fragments appear in the bone, or something crumbles from its ends, it should not be removed.	If there occur an effusion, then refrain from bandaging or setting it until the effusion subsides; and apply to it something to allay it as before said; then return to setting it and bandaging it as it should be.	0.8020685
It should not be touched, but leveled from the outside, as we have said, and the bandaging should be left until it heals.	If there be any splinters in the bone or anything crumbles away from the extremities, it must not be pulled out or touched, but set externally as we have said, and the bandaging should be left until it heals.	0.6900853
