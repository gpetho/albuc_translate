On Cutting the Lingual Frenulum that Limits Speech.
Chapter 34.
Occasionally, the lingual frenulum (the tissue under the tongue) may either be a congenital condition with which a person is born or arise from a wound that has healed improperly.
The procedure involves opening the patientâ€™s mouth with their head resting against your chest, lifting the tongue, and then cutting across the fibrous frenulum until the tongue is freed from its restriction.
If there is a hardening or nodule caused by scar tissue, insert a small hook and cut across it until the frenulum is divided and the nodule released.
Be careful not to cut too deeply into the tissue to avoid severing an artery, which would result in heavy bleeding.
Rinse the incision site with rose water, vinegar, or cold water.
Place a small piece of linen under the tongue, which the patient should hold there each night to prevent reattachment.
If bleeding occurs, apply powdered *zegi* (a hemostatic agent) to the site.
If the bleeding persists, cauterize the area with a suitable gentle cautery. Then treat the wound with appropriate care until it heals.
