It is necessary to begin by purifying the head with irises and what we have mentioned, then shave the patient's head. Then cauterize him with a cauterization in the middle of the head, a cauterization on each "horn" of the head, and a cauterization on the back of the head.	Purgation of the head should come first, with electuaries and the other things we have mentioned. Then shave the patient's head; and then burn him with one cauterization in the middle of the head and one on either frontal prominence and one on the occiput, and three on the vertebrae of the neck.	0.7330594
And three on the vertebrae of the neck.  If you need, in the case of general bodily weakness, more than that, and the patient can tolerate it, and the illness is severe and persistent, cauterize him with four cauterizations on the vertebrae of his back. Cauterize deeply so that you burn most of the skin, then lift your hand. Treat him according to what was mentioned previously until he recovers, God willing.  And the cautery iron should be olive-shaped.	And if the malady of flaccidity of the body require still more and the patient be fit to bear it, and his disease be severe and have a strong hold on him, burn him with four more cauterizations on his dorsal vertebrae and carry the cautery to burn almost through the thickness of the skin; then remove your hand and treat him in the aforesaid manner till he is healed. Let the cautery be olivary.	0.8347832
