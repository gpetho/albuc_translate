O dearest sons, I have completed for you this book which is the last of the science of medicine together with its fulfillment, and have made its end through its expositions and its declarations.
And it came to me in a vision that I should complete it for you with this treatise, which is part of the work of hands, that is to say "surgery."
And because the work of hands is withdrawn in our region and is completely foreign, thus the science is perished and cut off, and nothing remains of it except the small descriptions in books of the ancients that hands have changed.
And from this has come error and vanity, and intentions are closed and science is distanced.
Now it seems to me that I want to revive it together with the ordering of this treatise according to the way of exposition and declaration and abbreviation; and I will come with the forms of iron cautery tools, and other instruments of the work with the addition of its declaration and preparation, as is necessary.
And because no good masters of hands are found in our time, the art of medicine is distant.
And it behooves one who undertakes it to excel in the science of anatomy, as Galen says, so much that he knows the arrangement of the limbs, and their forms and connections and separations, and has knowledge of bones and nerves and arms and their number, and the movement and of moving veins and resting ones, and of the place of their exit.
And therefore Hippocrates says that the name with the name is much, and with the work is little; especially in the art of hands.
We tell you at the beginning of this book that whoever is not knowledgeable of the aforementioned things should beware lest he fall into error and kill people; thus I have seen many times several of those who undertake this science and abandon themselves without knowledge and without experience.
For I saw a foolish physician who cut an abscess of scrofula in a woman's neck, and cut the arteries of the neck; wherefore so much blood came out that the woman fell dead in his hands.
And I saw another physician who extracted a stone from a man of age, and the stone was large; thus he took with it a piece of the bladder, and the man was dead within 3 days.
And I had already been called there to extract it, and saw the disposition of the patient and the size of the stone, and knew well that if one cut him he would die.
And I saw another physician who took into care a duke of our land who had a broken leg, and with the break had a wound; and the physician full of ignorance bound the break over the wound with splints by strong binding, and did not leave any opening for the wound, and left it thus for a time; and commanded him not to unbind it; and remained thus until the leg was all swollen and the foot and came to perdition.
I was called to come to him, and hastened to come unbind the leg; and when I had unbound it, it was at peace and felt no pain.
But nevertheless the corruption was already confirmed in the member, and I could not heal it; and the corruption did not cease to go through the member until the member was completely lost.
And I saw another physician who opened a cancerous abscess, and then inflamed it through the malice of his lordship.
For cancer, when it is pure of melancholic humor, should not be touched with iron if it is not in such a place that one can completely remove what is corrupted.
And therefore, dearest sons, it is necessary for you to know that work of hands is divided into two divisions: that is to say, work where there is peril in several dispositions; and I will show in each place of this book where there is fear and peril.
Therefore it is necessary that you take care, so that foolish doctors cannot speak ill of you. Take your instruments with concern, and treat your patients gently and firmly, and use the best method so that by God's grace you achieve success and are praised; and leave aside frightening diseases of difficult healing; and keep your instruments away from what makes you doubt, and have faith in yourself so that you may pass from this world to the next in glory.
Galen says in some of his admonitions: "Do not take on treatment of a bad disease, lest you be called a foolish doctor."
I have divided this treatise according to three chapters.
The first chapter is about cauterization by fire and cauterization by strong medicine, and the chapter is ordered from head to feet; and about the forms of instruments, and cauterizing tools, and everything that is necessary in the work.
The second chapter is about cutting and piercing, and cupping glasses and wounds, and the extraction of arrows, and similar things; and the chapter is ordered and includes the forms of instruments.
The third chapter is about restoring dislocations and sprains, and similar things; and is ordered from head to feet, and about the forms of instruments.
Before we recall the work, it is necessary that I speak about the quality of help and harm for each complexion.
I say that the quality of help and harm is the longest discourse and subtle science and hidden secrets; and many of the wise spoke of this, and agreed on this; and their words suffice me little, for I fear lengthiness.
I say that cauterization helps universally for every complexion where there is matter, except for two complexions: namely hot complexion without matter, and dry complexion without matter.
In hot and dry complexion together with matter, some made distinctions and said that cauterization is of great help; and others said the opposite: that cauterization is not valuable for illness that comes from heat and dryness.
For the nature of fire is hot, and hot illness should not be treated by heat, nor by dryness; and he who said the opposite claims that cauterization provides great help for hot and dry illness that comes in men's bodies.
For when you compare the body of man and its moisture to the complexion of fire, you find the body cold.
And I agree with this statement.
For I have found it sometimes through experiment.
And yet, let none undertake it except those who have tested it, and who know through long usage the chapter on cauterizations, and the diversity of men's complexions, and the dispositions and causes of their illnesses, and the occurrences and the span of time; of other complexions we have no fear, especially in cold and moist illnesses.
And all doctors assembled and agreed on cauterization.
And know, son, that cauterization with fire is among the secrets of cures, and of greater goodness than cauterization with burning medicine.
For fire is simple, and only reaches the member that is cooked, and hardly harms other members.
Burning medicines travel from member to member at a distance, and bring to the member illnesses of difficult healing; and by chance kill the patient. Fire, because of its nobility and the goodness of its substance, does not do this, unless there is excess.
And this I have found through experiment and through the length of service and study that I have put into the art, and stood upon the truth of things; and therefore I excuse myself from the length of discourse, for it does not please me that I should hide from you the secret that is hidden in fire, and the quality of the work, how it drives away illnesses from bodies, as the philosopher says in demonstration; now receive it in your thoughts.
And know, son, that they agreed on what time cauterizations should be made, and chose spring.
And I say that cautery is suitable at all times, because the arising harm is subdued by the help of cautery; and especially if cautery is necessary for severe and urgent pains that cannot wait for fear that greater harm might come to the limb.
And never think, dear son, as do foolish physicians; for an illness that is healed by cautery does not return; and they say it thus; but it is not as they believe, because cautery is nothing but a medicine that changes the constitution, and dries the humors that are the cause of pain, and works better than medicine due to the swiftness of its value, and due to the virtue of its work and its authority.
And it is possible that the illness sometimes comes according to the constitution of the patient and the location of the illness and its strength; and superfluities are gathered in it through the acquisition of foods and similar things, unless cautery is administered in a place where there are few superfluities and moisture, such as dental cautery for pain, and similar things, and such pain does not return; but this happens rarely.
And many people do not understand why cautery is called the last resort of medicine, and this is true; but they do not believe that cautery works after medicine, but their understanding is false, and cautery is the last resort of medicine because when we administer types of cures for some illness and they do not work, then we administer cautery, and it works.
Thus it appears clear that cautery is the last resort of medicine, not according to the understanding of foolish physicians.
The ancients said that cautery with a gold instrument is better than with iron, and they said this only because of the quality of gold and the nobility of its substance; and they said that the cauterized area does not produce rot, but this is not true for I have tested it, and have found that this is true in some men; and gold cautery works better than iron, as they said.
And yet when you heat a gold instrument, you cannot tell when it is hot by the color of the gold, and it cools quickly; and if one heats it too much, it melts in the fire; and thus there are many impediments.
And therefore we use iron cautery because we have it better prepared for our work.
Now I have ordered this chapter from head to foot, so that the path might be easier to find.
On the olive-shaped cautery
This cautery is effective for moisture and cold in the brain, and there are two that are done because of an illness called "soda," and because of many humors that descend from the head to the eyes, and to the ears, and for multiple dreams and tooth pain and throat pain, and especially for all illnesses that come from cold such as paralysis and deafness and apoplexy and similar illnesses.
The procedure for this cautery is that the patient should be purged by purgative medicine cleansing the head for 3 or 4 nights, according to what the strength and age and constitution of the patient can bear; and then have the patient's head shaved.
And then have him sit cross-legged between your hands, and put his hands on his chest; after put the base of your palm on the root of his nose between his two eyes; and where your middle finger falls, mark it with ink then heat the cautery which is called "olivare," of which here is the form:
And put it on the spot marked with ink, and proceed downward while tightening your hand little by little while turning; then lift your hand quickly, and look at the spot to see if you can see the bone a little bit; and if you don't see it, repeat the cautery until you see the bone as I have told you; after take a little salt, and put it in water and wet cotton in it, and put it on the spot, and leave it for 3 days; after put cotton soaked in butter on it; and leave it until the burn is removed; after treat the wound with the ointment that is called "tetrapharmacon," until it is healed.
And the ancients said that the longer the wound remains open, the more it purges; and therefore it helps better.
And some of these said that one should leave the cautery until part of the bone is burned, and then scrape what is burned from the bone, and it should be treated.
And others say that one should leave the cautery on, and push so hard that one removes from the bone something as wide as a whorl that women put on their spindles so that the humors exit better; and one should leave the wound open for a long time; afterward one should treat it and close it.
And these two methods of cautery don't seem to me to be completely good, except in some men where there is cause for fear; and it seems better to me that I should leave it; because the head is weakened by the continuous solutions of nature, as we witness in other members; and especially when the patient's head is weak by nature, and the first appearance of cautery is safer and better for me, and I use it then together with safety.
On ancient head pain
When chronic pain comes to the whole head, and lasts a long time, the patient should use iris and pills that are called "cochie," and purging of the head and oils and plasters; and if one does the cautery that we mentioned before, and it doesn't work.
Take note if the patient's head is of strong nature, and that it isn't too cold; then cauterize below that cautery a little that we mentioned above.
After make a cautery on each corner of the head down to the bone, as we said before, and make a cautery in the place that is called "vessels"; and it is a place where one puts cupping glasses; and lighten your hand so that you don't go down to the bone: the patient feels much more pain in this cautery than in the others, and I will speak of it elsewhere; and it is necessary that the cauteries of the corners be more subtle than those with which one cauterizes the middle of the head, and this is the form:
About cauterization of the head
When sudden pain comes to a part of the head, and the illness extends to the eye, and the head has been purged by cleansing medicines, and one has done the other treatments that I mentioned in the section on illnesses, and all this does not help: then make cauterizations according to two methods, that is to say with caustic medicine and with iron.
The cauterization with caustic medicine is that you take a clove of garlic, and remove the skin and cut it a little at both ends, and then split the temple where the pain is in such a way that you can hide the clove of garlic under the skin; and when it is hidden, bind it and tighten it well and leave it thus for 12 hours; and then unbind it and pull out the clove of garlic, and leave the wound thus for 2 or 3 days; then put on cotton soaked in butter until pus comes out.
Afterwards treat it with ointment until it is healed; and if you wish, do this with some of the burning medicines that I have written about in the twelfth treatise on burning medicines.
The cauterization with iron is according to this method.
Heat the cautery of which here is the form:
And it is called "nail" because the head is made in the form of a nail where there is a bit of curve, and in the middle has a small protrusion; and put it on the painful place, and hold your hand and turn the iron a little lightly, until half the thickness of the skin is burned; and lift your hand so that the artery, which is outside, does not burn, and abundant blood flows.
Afterwards put cotton in salt water, and put it on the place for 3 days; then put cotton soaked in butter, and then treat the place with ointment until it is healed; and if you wish to cauterize this migraine with the cautery which is called "knife-like," with all the point, and be careful not to cut the artery in this migraine which is not old.
About migraine
When you treat migraine as we have said before in the section on illnesses, and it does not help, and you see that the aforementioned cautery of medicine and iron is not sufficient, then it is necessary that you heat the cautery which is called "knife-like" until it is white; and first mark on the painful place a line half a finger long, and remove your hand once, and tighten it so you do not cut the artery and that you do not come to the bone; and beware of the mandible that moves when one eats, and the nerve that moves it and that spasm does not come to the patient, and beware of blood flow from the artery when it will be cut, or cutting has great fear and especially to one who does not know it, and who is not studied and experienced; and leave the work halfway; but I will tell you how to stanch blood when the artery is cut, and I will show you the place where it belongs in this book.
And if you see that this cautery is not sufficient for the illness, and the patient is suffering, cauterize the middle of the head as we have said, and treat the wound until it is healed; and if you wish, administer the cautery that we have mentioned in the chapter on the extraction of the artery, with the cautery that has two blades; and this cautery is better than that one and more helpful.
About ear pain from cold
When pain comes to the ear from cold, and one has worked with dissolving medicines and the other treatments that we have mentioned in the section, and the pain does not move, then heat this cautery which is called "points," of which here is the form:
Afterwards make points all around the sick ear, or around both if the pain is in both, and keep a little distance from the root of the ear after you have marked the place with ink; and have 10 points around each ear; afterwards treat the place until it is healed.
of the distortion of the mouth
Distortion that must be treated by cautery is only of those that arise from phlegm, as we have said in the division of diseases; and do not apply cautery to conditions that come from dryness and spasm of nerves.
When you treat this type of distortion that comes from phlegm of hydras and purgations of the head and gargling, and this does not work, then you must cauterize the patient with 3 cauteries: one at the root of the ear, another a little outside the temple, and the third at the junction of the two lips; and put the cautery on the part that appears healthy, and make a cautery right at the head of the ear above a bit below the horn of the head, and another in the temple as long as a thumb; and leave the cautery on until half of the core is burned; and this is the form of the cautery:
And it is the appearance of the knife-like instrument that we have shown before, but it is a bit more subtle and the blade should be a bit thicker; afterwards treat the area as I have said before, until it is healed.
When apoplexy is old and you treat it as we have said, and it does not help, and the patient has no fever, then make 4 cauteries: 2 on the two horns of the head, and 1 in the middle of the head, and 1 in the place called "vessels" as we have said before, and the last cautery on the mouth of the stomach; and let it be treated as we have said before.
of lethargy
For this illness one must give the patient large pills purifying the brain; afterwards shave the patient's head completely, and put on the occiput the mustard plaster that is written in the treatise on plasters; and this is the manner of the cautery: do it as I have said.
If he is healed thus, good; and if he is not, make him 3 cauteries from the middle of the head descending to the neck, and have a space between each cautery of 1 finger's width; and treat it like the others, and if you want to add more, and the patient can bear it, make him 1 cautery in the middle; and if necessary, 2 others on the two horns, and treat until healed; and let the cautery be what is called "olive-shaped", as I have said before.
of the coldness of the head
It is necessary that the head be purified with pills and with what we have said before; afterwards shave the patient's head, then make a cautery in the middle of the head and on each horn, and 1 behind and 3 on the spine of the neck; and if you need more, and the body is moist and the patient can bear it, and the illness is strong, make him 4 cauteries on the spine of the back; and leave them until most of the core is burned, and lift your hand; afterwards treat until healed, and let the cautery be what is called "olive-shaped" that we have mentioned before.
of epilepsy
The epileptic should not use cautery except for that which is phlegmatic, and it is necessary first to purify the brain with pills and other treatments that we have mentioned in the division when the patient is grown and able to take medicine.
And if it is a child who cannot bear it, make him gargle and chew things purifying the brain often with good foods; afterwards shave his head in the middle, and make 1 cautery according to what we have said before, and 1 cautery on the vessel, and on each horn; and if the patient is strong and can bear it, make him cauteries as I have said to the one who has paralysis and softening of the body, on the spine of the back and neck, and let the cautery be olive-shaped according to the manner I have said.
If the patient is a child, make him 1 subtle cautery according to this manner:
When due to melancholy the superfluities or humors are corrupted and phlegm is thick, then cauterize with such cauteries as we have described for those who have paralysis.
And if due to melancholy the superfluities are declining to melancholy, and the body of the patient is moist, then give him to drink something by which the brain shall be purified, according to what was stated before in the division.
After shave the patient's head; after make a well-made ring of linen, like a circle, and place it in the middle of the head; and have the patient sit cross-legged, and be well held from all sides; after apply the liniment, and aged sheep's butter works better; and heat it on fire moderately, so that fingers if inserted can bear it; after empty the circle from within the middle of the head, and let it cool; and do this to the patient once every week with other good treatment, until he is healed.
Or if you wish, cauterize him by making several points with all the cautery.
This manner of cautery moistens the brain equally; and then put cotton soaked in butter and chicken fat on top.
On water in the eyes
When water first comes to the eyes by the signs that I have described in the division, then begin and give the patient something to drink that purifies the head, and guard him from all moisture, and make him sweat in the bath several times while fasting.
After command him to shave his head, and make a cautery in the middle of the head, and make two cauteries above the two temples if the descent of water is in both eyes together, or in one if the descent is in one; and cut with all the cautery all the veins and arteries that are below the skin, and let the cauteries be long according to the width of the temple; and guard yourself from blood flow, and if you see too much blood coming out, then stanch it with such power as you have.
And I will teach you in the extraction of arteries and in the incision the caution how you will stanch it; and sometimes one makes cautery in the nape below the two back bones.
On the flow of tears
When the tears of the eyes are old and habitual and are above the veins, or beside the arteries that are in the outer appearance of the head; and one sees that it is from cold phlegmatic superfluities, then make the cautery that I have mentioned at the beginning of the water descending to the eyes: one cautery in the middle of the head, and two cauteries above the two temples, and two cauteries in the nape below the two bones; and if there is need for more, then cauterize wisely above the eyebrow with a small cautery.
On the flow of tears inside the eyes
When you treat it according to what we have said in the division, and it does not profit at all, then give to drink to the patient for three nights at bedtime; after shave his head, and make a cautery in the middle with the olive-shaped cautery; and make two cauteries with the cautery that is called "clavilis" above the two eyebrows, a little below the hair; and guard yourself from cutting the artery.
And this is the form of the cautery that is called "clavilis":
When the eyelid of the eye is softened by illness and moisture, then cauterize it with this cautery that is called "olivare."
Of which here is the form:
And if you wish then make two cauteries above the two eyebrows as long as the eyebrows are; and do not leave the hand there except until the third part of the eyelid is burned, according to the manner that I have described.
about the hair that pricks the eye
Sometimes it happens that the eyelashes turn inward and prick the eye, and one applies cautery in two ways: namely by fire, or by burning medicine.
For cautery by fire, command the patient to let the hairs grow until they are long and even; and if they prick at their root, hold their eyes so they don't move until they grow.
When they grow and are even, then place the patient in your lap; afterward mark on the eyelid a shape that is like a myrtle leaf, and let the beginning of the mark be beside the hairs; then put cotton soaked in egg white and parsley mucilage on the eye, then heat the cautery which has this form:
After, cauterize over the shape that you have marked little by little many times, so that the flesh is burned there; and the sign of the success of the procedure is that you see the eyelid retracted, and the hairs raised from pricking the eye; then lift your hand, and leave it thus for 3 days, then put cotton soaked in butter until the burn is removed; afterward treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And if after this the hairs come back, and the eyelid is softened then begin the cautery again on that same place, just as you did at first; and if the hairs are outside, cauterize until the eyelid is raised to its natural place, and is even, and the hairs do not prick the eye.
The cautery with burning medicine is that you command the patient to let the hairs grow until they are long and even, then make from parchment the shape of a myrtle leaf; then take French soap and quicklime, one dram of each, and grind together well; and do it hastily, so it doesn't cool, then spread it over the shape that you have made like the myrtle leaf, and put it on the eyelid; and if the malady affects only one eye, one should work on one, and if on both likewise; and put under the eye cotton soaked in egg white; and let the patient's head be in your lap and put your index finger on the medicine, and press a little and move it every time the patient feels burning from the medicine, for they feel burning as if from fire.
When you have done this for a long time, remove the medicine with your finger.
And when the burning has passed, wash the place with water, and look if you see the eyelid raised as if it were raised by the constraint of fire or by incision; and if it is so, it is good.
If not, put more of the medicine on the place where the medicine hasn't worked, until your work is even, and your eyes are set right; then put on cotton soaked in butter until the burned flesh has fallen off, afterward treat the place with the ointment that is called "dyafenis" and others, until it is healed.
And it is necessary that you guard well your work with great care that none of the medicine falls into the eyes.
And if the eyelid becomes soft afterward, and the hairs prick the eye, begin the medicine again on that place of the eyelid that has softened, just as you did before; afterward treat it until it is healed; and this is the shape of the myrtle leaf:
And know that men's eyes are different in size and smallness, and according to this should be your constraints; and let not the right way be hidden from him who studies this art.
On the treatment of fistula by cautery
When you treat fistula as we have described in the division of diseases, and your treatments are not effective, then it is necessary that you perform cautery in this manner.
Command the patient to put his head in your lap; and have the assistant hold his head between your hands in such a way that he cannot move or shake his head; then put cotton soaked in egg white or in parsley juice over the eye; then heat the cautery which is like this: and is fitted at the end like the shape of a bird's feather, together with which is the cautery; if you wish, it can be pointed from one end to the other, and if you wish, it can be like a tent [surgical dressing]; but nevertheless, the one that is fitted is better for your work.
Then press the fistula if it is open, and draw out the pus, and dry it; and if it is closed, then open it, and draw out the matter; then apply the very hot cautery, and hold your hand on the cautery on the side of the nerve away from the eye, so that your hand does not make a mistake; and put the cautery in the fat of the eye, and destroy it.
If you reach the bone at the beginning of the cauterization, that would be good.
If not, then repeat the cautery once more, and again if you need to, and leave it for 3 days; afterward put cotton soaked in butter on it, and treat it with drying ointment until it is healed, and if 40 days pass without it being healed, then apply sharp corrosive medicine until the bone is exposed; and scrape it according to what will come in its chapter.
And there is a type of cautery for fistula that some of the ancients described.
Pay attention to the fistula, and split the area; then put in the split a fine rod of which this is the shape:
and they make it to the quantity of a dram of lead; and hold your hand firmly on the rod, and the patient must not move at all, so that the melted lead does not run into his eye; and it is necessary to put on the patient's eye cotton soaked in egg whites or in water: the lead burns the site of the fistula, and heals it with marvelous healing.
And if the fistula is healed by the cautery that we have described, that is good.
If not, then it is necessary to make a hole at the nerve, and bring the fistula to the body of the nerve according to what is required in its proper place.
On cracks in the lips
Very often cracks occur in lips that are called "hair," and especially in children's lips.
When you treat these cracks with what we have described in divisions, and the treatment is not effective, then heat a small knife-like cautery of this shape:
And put it quickly in these cracks until it reaches the bottom; afterward treat the area with wax until it is healed.
On abscess of the mouth
When an abscess comes in the root of the mouth or in the uvula, or in the palate, or at the roots of the teeth, then makes pus and breaks and becomes old and turns into a fistula; and you treat it as we have described in divisions, and it is not effective: then it is necessary that you have a cautery according to the size of the fistula; then push it into the hole of the fistula, and hold your hand until the hot iron reaches its bottom and final place; and do this once or twice, then treat it with what we have described in treatments, until it is healed; and if it is cured thus, that is good; and if not, then it is necessary to expose the area and remove the corrupted bone, according to what you will find in its chapter.
On loose teeth
When the gums are softened by moisture and the teeth are loose, and you treat it with medicines and this does not work, then put the patient's head in your lap; then heat the cautery whose shape will come hereafter in such a way that you put a reed on the tooth; and put inside it the hot cautery quickly, and hold your hand until the patient feels the heat coming to the root of the tooth; then lift your hand and repeat the cautery according to your judgment; afterward have the patient fill his mouth with salt water, and hold it for an hour and spit it out.
And in this way the tooth that was loose is strengthened, and the softened gum tightened, and the corrupted moisture dried.
On tooth pain
When tooth pain comes from cold, or there is cold or truly, and medical cures are ineffective, then there is need for cautery in two ways: butter cautery and fire cautery.
Butter cautery is such that you take cow's butter, and boil it in an iron or brass spoon; then take cotton and wrap it around the point of a probe, and soak it in boiled butter, and put it on the aching tooth quickly and hold until it cools; and do this often until its power reaches the root of the tooth, and if you wish, soak wool and cotton in cold butter, and put it on the aching tooth, and put a hot iron on it until the heat reaches the end of the tooth.
The fire cautery is such that you take an iron or brass tube, and let it be thick so that the fire does not reach the patient's mouth; then heat the cautery, whose form will come hereafter, and put it on the tooth and hold your hand until the cautery cools; do this often, for the pain will be removed that same day or the next.
And it is necessary that the patient fill their mouth with good butter during the application of this cautery, and then spit it out; and this is the form of the cautery:
And make the cautery from whichever end you wish, and according to what you are able; and this is the form of the tube:
On scrofula
When scrofulas are from phlegm and cold moistures, and are not responsive to digestion by medicines, then heat the hollow cautery whose form comes hereafter, and let it have two openings for the fumes to exit the cautery on the other side; and put the hot cautery on the abscess once, or twice if necessary, until it reaches the bottom of the abscess; and if the abscess is small then apply cautery according to the size of the abscess, and leave it thus for three days; and put cotton soaked in butter until the burn is removed; afterwards treat the place with ointments and probes until it is healed.
The form of the tube:
When moistures overcome the channels of the lung, and especially when this comes from cold complexion, then it is necessary that the patient be first emptied by purgative medicines; afterwards make a cautery at the root of the throat, and take care that you do not come up to the throat, and burn the flesh only a little.
Afterwards make another cautery at the joint of the neck at the head of the spine, and let it be the cautery which is called "clavicle" whose form we have before; and treat the place as we have said before until it is healed.
On cough
When cough and lung disease are from cold moistures, and the patient has neither fever nor dryness, and the disease is old, make two cauteries on the hollow of the chest in empty places; and another cautery in the middle of the chest between the two breasts; and let it be the cautery which is called "clavicle" according to the form which is said before.
And if you wish, make puncture cautery with the cautery which is called "points" whose form is given before in the disease of the ears; and let the points be up to thirty, or thereabouts.
Afterwards treat the place according to what is said before, and let the cautery have three prongs according to this form:
And for this the cauteries are easier, because you make three at once.
On the dislocation of the humerus (de la dislocation de l'ajutoire)
When the head of the humerus is dislocated due to moisture, and one puts it back in place, and it cannot stay but rather keeps coming out with small movements that occur, as we have observed, then it is necessary that you first reduce the dislocation.
Afterwards, let the patient lie on his back and on his side; then lift the flesh that is within the armpit with the fingers of your left hand; and if the joint is dislocated inward, heat the cautery that has 2 prongs, of which here is the form:
and cauterize the flesh until it pierces through to the side, and the pattern of the cautery will come together as 4 cauteries; and for this reason the cautery is made with the cautery that has 3 prongs, so that the pattern of cauterization makes six cauteries; and the prongs are according to the thinness of a probe and this is the form of the cautery that has 3 prongs:
And sometimes one prong is added to this so that there are 8 cauteries.
Afterwards, put crushed leeks with salt on the cautery; then let the patient rest, and the limb should not be moved for a long time until it is well strengthened.
And if it is dislocated above, which happens rarely, then make a cautery on the thickness with the nail-shaped cautery, or many cauteries by pricking.
For the joint is closed again, and the moisture is removed and the patient is healed.
When coldness and much moisture come to the stomach so much that they draw it to their condition, and catarrhs multiply in it, and in the customary ways of treatment it does not benefit, then it is necessary that the patient lie on his back, and extend his legs and his hands.
After this, make him 3 cauteries: 1 below the breast bone by the measure of one finger, with the nail-shaped cautery, and 2 cauteries outside the two sides so that the pattern of the cauteries forms a triangle, and let there be such space between one and the other that they are not joined together when they will discharge pus; and let the cauteries be so deep that they take up two parts of the flesh, and let the pattern of the cauteries be according to this form without addition:
And if you wish, cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this form; and for one who will be afraid of this cautery, cauterize by pricking and mark on the stomach a point according to the quantity that you wish in ink; then cauterize it with the cautery that is called "points."
Afterwards, treat it with the treatment that we have had before, until it is healed.
When pain comes to the liver from cold and moisture and thick windiness, so much that it is put out of its natural condition by the superfluities; and the patient is treated for what we have said in divisions, and it does not benefit him, then it is necessary that the patient lie on his nape; and mark in ink 3 cauteries according to this form and this figure and this quantity on the liver, outside the hypochondria, there where the elbow of the man comes; and let there be space between each cautery the thickness of a finger; and let the cauteries be along the length of the body, and do not press your hand too much with the cautery; and let only half of the flesh be burned, and let the patient be upright on his feet; and if he cannot, let him lie down, and extend his legs, and raise his arms; and this is the form:
And if it is your wish, then cauterize these cauteries with the knife-shaped one, if you are subtle and wise in the art, and take care that you do not burn all the flesh, for you would make the whole body dry up; and that it does not come up to the bowel, for the flesh is very thin there, and know this for truth.
When there is an abscess in the liver, and you want to know if it is in the flesh of the liver or in the membrane: if it is in the flesh, the patient feels pain that is not too strong; and if it is in the membrane, they feel mad pain.
And when this cure defeats the physicians, it is necessary that the patient lie on their back; and then mark with ink the place where the abscess is, and then heat the cautery that resembles a ray, of which here is the form:
And cauterize with a cautery until the skin is burned, and reach until the peritoneum, until all the pus is out; afterwards treat according to the treatment of discharges until it is healed; and none should use this cautery except those who have studied for a long time in the art of medicine, and through whose hands these diseases have sometimes run.
Thus he can work boldly, and nevertheless it seems to me that it is better to leave it.
On the cautery for pleurisy
The ancients said that one should make cauteries for pleurisy from roots of aristolochia, and in this manner: take a root of long aristolochia, the largest you can find, and let it be dry, and be as thick and as long as your finger; and moisten it in oil, and light it with fire, and cauterize one cautery between the clavicle and the neck, and two small cauteries descending a bit in the part that is below the beard; and two cauteries between the fifth rib and the sixth, declining a bit behind; and one cautery in the middle of the chest, and another on the stomach, and one between the shoulders, and two on the sides of the chest outside the cautery that is between the shoulders; and do not press your hand, but do it openly as if smelling.
And some ancients said that some men use an iron cautery resembling a razor, and heat it and put it between the ribs, until it comes to this abscess; and the pain jumps out, as we have said in the liver abscess.
But in this work there is fear where the patient dies immediately, or a fistula comes that cannot be healed.
On the spleen
When you treat the disease of the spleen with what we have said in the divisions of cures, and it does not profit, then three types of cautery are appropriate which are all good.
Of which one manner is that you make three cauteries, or four, in a line according to the length of the spleen, according to the figure of the liver cautery that we mentioned before; and do not press your hand with all the cautery, and let the patient be lying on their back; and another manner of cautery is that you heat the cautery which has two branches, as we have shown in the dislocation of the shoulder; and lift the skin that is right on the spleen, where the patient's elbow comes toward the left, and let the elevation with which you lift the skin be according to the skin, according to the length of the body, and let the cauteries be according to the width of the body.
Afterwards push in the two inflamed branches until the skin is pierced on the other side, and then pull out the cautery, and thus there will be four. And if you want, cauterize with the cautery with three branches.
Afterwards treat it when it has discharged pus for a long time, and this is better than the other cures mentioned before.
On dropsy
Cautery is not useful for dropsy, except for the type that is called "ascites."
When you treat it according to the ways that we have said in divisions, and your treatment does not profit, then it is necessary that you make four cauteries around the navel, and one on the stomach, and one on the liver, and one on the spleen, and two behind the back on the spine, and one opposite the chest; and let the cautery be very close to the thickness of the skin.
Afterwards leave the cautery open to discharge pus for a long time, and do not abandon the treatment of the patient after the cautery; and healing will hasten, and the two intentions will be together with God's help.
The form of the cautery for the belly should be the nail that we have shown before; and that for the back should be olive-shaped, according to what is put here before.
on the swelling of feet
When the feet are swollen in one who has dropsy, and are full of yellow water, it is necessary that you cauterize on the top of the foot between the little toe and the ring toe; and lift your hand with the cautery without turning.
And do not enter too deeply, thus the yellow water will flow out, and let the cautery be according to this form:
Afterwards make on the two legs two cauteries on each leg at the point of the knife; and let the cautery be lengthwise, one below the knee in front and the other outside, in the middle of the leg; and leave the cauteries open for a long time without treating, so that the water comes out; afterwards treat it with the other treatments that we have mentioned.
on diarrhea
When looseness of the belly comes from cold and moisture, such that the retentive and digestive virtue which is in the stomach and in the intestine is weakened, and cannot be cured by manner of treatments; and you see the patient well-bearing and of strong virtue, then make a large cautery on the stomach according to what has been spoken of before in the cautery of the stomach, with the circular cautery; and four cauteries around the navel subtle with a subtle nail-like cautery, and two cauteries on the hips.
And if you see abundant moisture and the patient bearing it, then make a cautery on the groin, and a cautery on each flank, and two small cauteries on the stomach beside the large one, for the treatment is profitable when there is good help.
on the treatment of hemorrhoids
When hemorrhoids are in the fundament, either one or several, and are old and are of thick cold and moist corrupted humors, and are treated as we have said in divisions, and it does not profit, then make cauteries: three on the spine of the back, that which is all outside below almecdate little by little in triangulating, and one cautery below the navel two fingers; and if you think that his stomach is cooled, and the food does not digest, and one sees the face swelling, then make him a large cautery on the stomach, as it is said before, and another on the liver, and another on the spleen with the nail-like cautery; and leave the cautery open for a long time.
Afterwards treat the place until it is healed.
on the fleshiness which is called "thelul"
When you cut althelul, heat the cautery which resembles a razor, and then put it all glowing on this cut althelul; and leave your hand there until the cautery comes to the birth of the vein, from which the blood flows; do this once or twice, and if there is much althelul, then cauterize each as we have said; afterwards treat them with profitable ointments until they are healed; and if you cauterize with a large cautery on alchatim, there will be greater help.
on poorly healed wound
When the patient cannot suffer cutting or opening, which we will recount in its place, such illness comes that cannot be healed except by cautery.
When someone gets a fistula, and it is old and discharges pus and corrupted moisture, you should probe it with a subtle probe, and take care that you know with the probe how deep it is.
Afterwards heat the cautery which resembles a razor, and push it into the fistula according to the quantity that the probe entered, and restart the cautery until these rotten and corrupted bodies are burnt, once, or twice or thrice, according to the quantity of its need; and guard yourself from burning the nerves which are there, and the great veins.
If the fistula goes to the body of the bladder and to the intestine, then guard yourself from these places, and do not do this except in fleshy places, and think that it is not piercing; afterwards treat the place until it is healed, and if the place is sealed, and the matters are removed for a long time, then know that the place is healed entirely; and if the matters are not removed, know that the place is pierced, and the bone is corrupted at the bottom; and thus as one of these that we will speak of in its place.
on kidney disease
When pain from cold comes to the kidneys, and from thick windiness, and one loses desire for women, then it is necessary that you make a cautery on the kidneys on both sides with the nail-shaped cautery that we mentioned before; and if we cauterize in the middle, there will be 3 cauteries in a line, and they will provide greater help.
on the bladder
When the bladder is soft and weak from cold and moisture, such that the patient retains urine, then make a cautery on the outer part above the bladder, where the pubic hair begins, and one on the right and one on the left, and let each cautery be as long as a thumb's knuckle; and make one cautery on the outside of the back, or two if you need them; and let the cautery be nail-shaped according to the form described before.
on the womb
When the womb is cold and moist, and this prevents conception, and the menses are corrupted and their timing delayed; and when they come, there is great pain: then it is necessary to make 3 cauteries around the navel, as we said for the bladder cautery, and 2 cauteries on the outside of the back; and let the cautery be nail-shaped, as we have said.
on the hip
When viscous moisture descends to the hip socket, and because of this it moves from its place, and the sign is that the thigh is longer than the other when measured together; and the place of separation is found empty, it is necessary that you cauterize the patient above the hip socket with a cautery resembling a circle, and mark beforehand the place around the socket as it turns, so that the socket is within the circle; and let the cautery be like the one used to cauterize the stomach.
And if this cautery is not available to you, make 3 large olive-shaped cauteries, and let the cautery be as deep as all the leather; and treat it until it is healed.
on hip pain
When pain comes to the hip socket, and it is from cold and moisture, and the patient is treated with what we have mentioned in the division and the treatment does not work, and the illness is old: then it is necessary that you purge the patient of thick humors with fetid pills, or other good similar pills.
Afterwards make a cautery; and the manner of cautery is according to two ways: that is to say together with burning medicines, and cautery of fire.
Cautery of fire is according to many ways, of which one is such: that you cauterize above the hip socket with 3 triangular cauteries according to this form, and make good and great depth, and let there be between each cautery a space of a finger's width, and let the cautery be olive-shaped; sometimes one makes a cautery in the middle above the head of the hip, which makes 4 according to this form:
And if you wish, cauterize it with the circular cautery that we mentioned before for hip dislocation; but do it in such a way that the circle contains the whole hip, and all the thickness of the leather is burned.
And this is the manner done in sciatica, when the pain holds in the hip, and does not reach to the thigh or to the leg.
And if it comes to the thigh and leg, make 2 cauteries where the patient says the pain holds, and 1 cautery above the ankle 4 fingers' width, on the left side a little; and let the cautery be knife-shaped, and let the thickness of the leather be burned; and if the patient feels that the pain extends to the toes or near there, cauterize where he feels the pain with 3 or 4 points with the cautery that is called "points."
And if needed, make more of them; and if he knows that the pain is below the knee toward the thigh, make a cautery with the knife-shaped or circular cautery, and take good care in all your cauteries that you do not leave the cautery so long that you burn the nerves and the large arteries, and that you do not cause the patient greater harm and contraction.
And I myself have seen many who have made cautery on the ankle of the foot, and left it until the leg was all swollen, and the foot as well, and the whole foot was pierced and corrupted.
After a solution of the belly from which he had death.
And if the pain is in two parts together, make cautery in one and the other, according to this manner.
And the wise men said about the cautery of the hip, of which here is the manner: make such an iron and let it be at the head as thick as a date stone, or a little less, and let it be with cross-pieces and from one cross-piece to the other let there be the space of a thumb joint; and let the cross-pieces be open on two sides, and be like knots, and let there be a well-made iron handle; and this is the form:
And let it be heated until it is all red and throws sparks, and then let it be put on the socket of the sick hip, and let it be turned to the healthy side; and cauterize it once with a round cautery and leave it three days; and then make a plaster of butter, and leave the wound open for a long time; after treat with ointment until it is healed.
Albucasis says that we use this cautery little because of the fear of its appearance, and we see few who use it; and yet this is one of the good cauteries, for those who can bear it, and where it is appropriate.
The cautery of burning medicine is that you make an instrument with cross-pieces in which descends the margin of the opening, and let it be of brass or iron with a long wall, and in the height let there be two knots, and let there be between each the quantity of the thickness of a finger; and let them be open outside and above, and join together according to this form:
After put it on the hip socket of the patient lying on their healthy side, and press your hand much on the hip socket; after pour between the two circles hot water which should be heated at the fire a little, and leave it for an hour of time, and let the patient suffer the heat and burning of it.
For he finds biting there as if from fire; and when the biting has passed, lift your hand with the instrument and wash the hip with sweet water, and leave it thus three days, and put butter on it until what is black from the scalding is removed; and leave it three days that pus will come out; and this will be the last aid after the treatment with ointments until it is healed.
And if the pain has extended to the thigh or to the leg, make him an instrument that holds water according to what you have done for the hip equally; and this is the manner of hot water, and I have written about it in the treatise on the rectification of medicine.
Take alkali and quicklime, as much of one as of the other, and grind them together, and put them in a new pot.
Where there should be a small hole outside so that the point of a razor can enter; and put over this pot another well-leaded pot, and put on alkali and lime and sweet water above, so much that there is a finger above the powders when you will have well pressed it with your hand; and leave it thus until sharp water descends and falls in the leaded pot, then take all this water, and pour it on lime and on alkali as before.
And then it will be very sharp and is administered in many medical works and in cauteries of other members. For it does the same work as fire, and there are other medicines with which one cauterizes the hip well such as teazel and anacardium honey and lime with soap, all these things mixed together.
And Galen tells us of a cure by which a man was cured of the pain of the hip and of the sciatic vein, and praises it much, and says that no other cure was made there, and that he was healed in a single time when this cure had been done, and he had bathed as he teaches here after.
And he says in such manner that you take fresh green litharge and dry it, and grind it much with a little grease, and put it on the hip and on the thigh and on the leg where the pain holds, and bind it; and leave it three hours and for the quantity that the patient no longer feels the burning.
And then make them enter the bath until their body is a little wet, and make them go to bed, and the pain will go away completely and they will be healed.
And know that no one should use cautery of such medicines, unless it is after the evacuation of the body.
And Dioscorides says that when the sciatic vein is cauterized with goat dung, it helps much; and the cautery should be done in this manner.
Take wool and soak it in old oil, and put it on the small hollow that is between the thumb of the foot and the other that is called the ankle bone.
After take dry goat dung, and set it on fire until it becomes charcoal, and put it on the wool, and leave it until it is extinguished; and do this again, and do not cease doing this until you think by reason that it reaches to the hip, and that the pain has ceased; and this manner of cautery is called "goat cautery."
Of the pain of the back
When pain comes to the back, either by falling or from a blow or by too great evacuation, or by signs of cold matter spread, none of these symptoms warrant cautery, except for that which comes from the infusion of cold matter.
It is necessary that after the patient is emptied of fetid pills or other similar things, that one makes on their back, there where the pain holds, three lines marked with ink, and in each line 5 cauteries or more according to the strength and quantity that the patient can suffer; and let the cautery be made according to the cautery that is called "points"; and if you wish, make 3 or 4 cauteries with the medium nail cautery according to this form:
Many times this illness comes to small children, and the sign of its beginning is that they have short breath when they rise, and fear; and you find in the last spine of the back and in knots the appearance that comes on the other spines.
When you see this and you want to cure it, cauterize it with the circle cautery according to this form.
So that the cautery encompasses each part of the spine equally.
And if you wish, cauterize around the spine with the pointed cautery 2 or 3 lines, and let the points be close to one another.
After treat the place until it is healed according to what we have said, and be careful not to administer cautery on a hump that is in nerve spasm.
Of the pain of the joints
When joint pains are from moistures that are spread to each member of the body, and when pain comes to feet, which doctors call "podagra" properly, and when it is from cold cause and cures of medicines cannot cure it, it is cured by cauteries in this manner: make many cauteries around the joint of the foot, and let the cautery be olive-shaped according to this form:
And if there is need that you point on the face of the foot, make cautery with all the cautery that is called "point."
And if the pains come up to knees and to other joints, and this happens many times, make cautery on each knee 3 or 4 cauteries on each part, with the olive-shaped cautery; and if you need more, make more, but do not hold your hand there except until the thickness of the leather is burned.
And if the pains descend to knee and to back, administer the cautery that we have mentioned in its chapter.
And if the pains are in the hands, make points around the wrist in 2 lines; and if any pain remains in the fingers, make points on each joint and on the palm of the hand; and if the pains come up to the elbows or up to the shoulders, cauterize each part, and give good governance to the patient and take medicines.
For if you give them good governance and you purge phlegm, they will be healed with God's help.
On the rupture of the abdomen
When a rupture occurs in the groin, and the bowels descend to the testicles and this is recent, it is necessary that when you want to cure it, he should not eat that day; and he should use things that loosen the belly, so that the waste descends from his belly; after, make him sit on his back between your hands, and command him to hold his breath until the bowels have returned, and guide them back with your fingers, and mark with ink below the rupture on the pubic bone, and make a sign that resembles half a circle above the body; then heat the cautery of which here is the form:
until it is white and throws sparks.
Then return the bowels to their place; and the assistant should keep his hand on them so they don't return backward; and spread well the thighs of the patient, and put under him a cushion and an assistant on the thighs, and another on the chest who holds his hands; then put the cautery on the mark with your hand, and hold it straight and hold it until you reach the bone, and if you don't reach it the first time, start again another time until you come to the bone; and guard carefully that the bowels don't protrude when you use the cautery; that you don't burn them; and that through this the patient doesn't die, or other evils.
And know that when you don't reach the bone with the cautery, your work is worth nothing.
And it is necessary that the cautery for children be subtle according to their measure, and for grown people also large according to their measure; after 3 days treat the cauterized place with butter until the burn is removed; after treat it with other ointments until it is healed, and the patient should lie 40 days on his back until the wound is well sealed; and it is necessary that his nourishment be laxative for a long time, so that the bowels don't protrude when he tries to go to the chambers.
And after 40 days, when he wants to get up, provide him with a well-made bandage, and wear it another 40 days; and have good rest, that he works little and guards against too much repletion from drinking and eating, and from shouting too loud; and when he follows this instruction he is healed entirely.
And I will tell hereafter the cure of cutting in its chapter.
On the rupture of the belly
When ruptures come in other bellies and are known, and you want that they don't grow more, make him a cautery with the round cautery according to its quantity, and let a third of the core be burned; after treat it according to what we have said; and some of the ancients have said that one should cauterize with the three-angled cautery according to this form:
but first mark the place with ink and make a line across the width above the rupture, and another outside, and guide your hand in the middle with the nail-shaped cautery.
But the first cautery is easier and better.
On ancient pain in any member
When pain comes in any member, either from falling or from striking, and this pain lasts a long time, and the cure of medicine is not effective, then it is necessary that it be cauterized with the cautery that is called "points," and let the cautery be according to the length of the member and its smallness and its weakness and its strength and its location of twists and its pain.
if he is healed from the first cautery, that is good; if not, begin another cautery above that one, for such is the custom that it should move to the member that is nearby, for which reason it is necessary that you make the cauteries until the patient is healed.
On leprosy
Lepers are sometimes helped greatly by cauterization, especially the disease that comes from the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy.
When you want to cauterize it, observe if the disease is at the beginning, and if it has been treated as we have said in the division, and does not descend nor remain, and you fear that the corruption might overtake the whole patient, then make 5 cauterizations on the head: 1 in the middle of the head at the crown, and another towards the forehead at the hairline; and 2 on the two corners, and 1 behind on the nape; and leave your hand there until the cauterization reaches the bone, and until the crusts come out so that the vapors of thick humors can escape; and cauterize on the spleen as mentioned before.
And if the leprosy is spread everywhere and is manifestly visible, it is necessary that you cauterize with these cauterizations that we mentioned on the head, and 1 cauterization on the tip of the nose, and 2 cauterizations on the spine of the neck, and 6 cauterizations on the spine of the back, and 1 large one on the croup and another beside it, and 2 on the two shoulders; and 2 on the elbows, and 2 on the cartilages of the chest, and 1 on each joint of the hands and feet, and on the hollows of the hands; and beware of the nerves that are on the back of the heel, that you do not burn them; and sometimes one makes a cauterization on the wrist bone, and another on the breastbone, and another on the liver.
And know that the more cauterizations you make, the more help you provide, and the better it benefits; and know that the patient does not feel pain from the cauterization as healthy people do, because the body is already completely corrupted.
And the cauterizations must be large and small according to the limbs and joints, according to what you will find in the types of irons.
Afterward, treat the area with vetch flour with honey and other treatments until it is healed.
When swelling comes in any limb and is treated with medicines and oils and plasters, and it is not healed, then make cauterizations on the limb according to the size and smallness of the limb; and let the cauterization be slightly entering into the thickness of the skin; then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
And sometimes one makes cauterization on the hand and on the foot and on the back, at the exit of the nerve that moves the limb, and thus the swelling is removed; and nevertheless no one should undertake this if they are not knowledgeable about the limbs and the exits of the nerves moving the body.
on vitiligo
When the disease that is called "albaras" is old, and the devices of medicine are worth nothing, then cauterize it with a cauterization slightly deep, according to the quantity of the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness is removed, and its color is changed; then treat it with vetch flour and lentils with rose oil and plantain leaves, and pigeon blood and swallow blood, one part of each; and let it all be mixed together, and be bound with a cloth, and be attached to the place until it is healed.
the treatment of cancer by cauterization
When cancer comes at the beginning, and you want to stop it, cauterize it with a cautery that resembles a circle, all around the cancer.
And nevertheless the wise said that one should make cauterization also in the middle of the cancer; and nevertheless this does not seem good to me, for I fear that it might become ulcerated and corrupted, and I have already seen it happen sometimes; and it is more right that it be cauterized around, with the cautery that is called "circular", as we have said in many cauterizations.
of the swelling that cannot mature
When someone has a disease that is called "adubelati", and it is slow to mature either because of the superfluity it makes or because of the age of the patient when he is decrepit (that is to say very old) and he has little blood, or because of the weather; and you want to hasten its maturation: then cauterize around it with many small cauterizations by pricking; afterward leave it thus.
For it will hasten to mature.
"And if you want to pierce it with the cautery, then heat the cautery of which here is the form:
And put your hand in the middle of this illness which is called 'adubelati' until the cautery has pierced the heart, and let the cautery be such that the patient feels it from outside in such a way that the flow of pus is relieved.
After that, treat it until it is completely healed.
The treatment of fire by iron
There is another kind of illness which is called 'corrodens', and it is nothing other than an itching of the limb, for it eats away at the limbs just as fire does dry wood.
If you see this illness in a place that can endure cautery with fire, then heat the small and large nail-shaped cauteries, according to what is suitable for the place where the illness is; then cauterize it from all sides until you remove all the corruption, and nothing remains of it, so that all that is corrupted is removed.
And then leave it for three days, and put on the cauterized places ground sulfur with oil until the burns from the fire are removed, and all the corruption.
After that, treat it with ointments that generate flesh.
And if you see after three days that healthy flesh does not grow, that is good; and if not, then restart the cautery on what remains of the corrupted places.
And this itching has sometimes been cured with sharp medicine instead of cautery by fire; but nevertheless cautery by fire is of greater help, and I have already spoken of the treatment with sharp medicine in the division: take it when you need it.
About warts that come to the feet
Very often it happens that on the feet externally grows an illness which is called 'clos' according to our understanding, and it is a thick felted thing that hurts the foot.
And the cautery for this illness is of two types.
That is to say cautery by fire, and cautery by hot water.
Cautery by fire is when you heat a hollow cautery like a vulture's feather, and it should be made of good iron to the measure that it can encompass the nail from all sides, and that it has subtle edges; then put it hot on the nail, and turn your hand all around the nail until it reaches the bottom of the nail; and leave it thus for three days until it begins to discharge pus; then make a plaster of wild mallows crushed with salt, and leave the plaster on all night, and the nail will fall and will be uprooted from its roots.
Then treat the place with flesh-generating ointment until it is healed.
And if they are converted to the outside of the body, and many times it happens both on hands and feet, then it is necessary that you administer cautery of hot water; and it is in this way: take a tube of brass or iron, or a vulture's feather, and put it on the nail and the althelul, that is to say warts; and put the tube on so that it encompasses all around, then put a little hot water in it, and hold your hand steady, and press your hand while turning so that the edge of the tube comes to the root of the nail, and the hot water can find a deep path to the root; and let the patient endure a bit the burning of the hot water for an hour; then leave it thus, and it will uproot itself completely with all its roots.
Do this one after another, until you remove all those that are on the body, then treat them with ointments that generate flesh.
The treatment of trembling
When someone trembles from coldness of nerves, or from quartan fever or another, it is necessary that you make four cauteries or four on the spine of the back, one cautery between each vertebra; and one cautery on the chest, and one on the stomach with the olive-shaped cautery; thus it will stop the trembling, and the healing of the cold illness will be hastened."
Of foul pustules
Sometimes there appear on the outside of the body boils, or foul pustules, which come from thick corrupted matter.
At first when they appear, it is necessary to cauterize each head of the pustule: a subtle cautery of myrtle wood, whose point is lit by fire, or of long aristolochia root, or with a lenticular cautery.
And sometimes one cauterizes them at the beginning when they appear, according to this method, and they cannot grow from then on, but the excess from which they come is broken down, and they are healed; but this must be done after blood evacuation.
When the artery is cut
Many times there occurs great bleeding from the artery which is cut in the wound that comes from the outside, or from the incision of the abscess, or from cauterizing the limb, and similar things; and it is a very difficult thing to stanch.
And whenever this happens to someone, hasten to put your index finger on the wound of the vein, and press hard until the blood is calmed beneath your finger, and no drop comes out anymore; then put several small and large olive-shaped cauteries in the fire until they are all red; then take one, either large or small according to the wound and the place where the artery is broken, and put the cautery on the vein where you hold your finger, and hold the cautery there until the blood is stanched.
And if it jumps out when you lift your finger from the vein, and the cautery goes out, quickly take another of the cauteries that are in the fire.
And do not cease doing this one after another until the blood is stanched; and be careful not to burn the nerve that is nearby, and that no other harm comes to the patient; and know that when blood flows from the artery, one cannot well stanch it, especially when the artery is large, except by one of the four methods that we have mentioned: either by cautery, or by extraction when it is not drawn out, or by strong binding with thread, or by medicines placed on top that have the power to stanch blood; and it should be bound and tightened properly.
Whoever will administer staunching by tight binding with cloths or by putting burning things on top, or other similar things, it will profit little if at all.
And if this happens to someone and they have neither physician nor medicine present, they should put their index finger on the wound of the vein as we have said, and press well until it is stanched above the wound and above the vein; and do not remove the finger, but moisten it often with very cold water until the blood is congealed and thickened and stanched; and from then on do what is needed with cauteries and medicines.
Here begins the second book of surgical treatments
We have told you in the first chapter every illness in which cautery of fire is needed, or of burning medicine, and the occasions and the causes and the instruments and the forms of cauteries; and I have put that chapter from head to foot, and I will go in this chapter by the same way so that one finds more easily what one wants.
And before I begin this, it is necessary, dear son, that you learn that in this chapter there is more peril and fear than in the first about cauteries, and therefore greater caution is needed.
For in the work of this chapter, many times there occurs evacuation of blood in opening the vein, and in the incision above abscess, and in the treatment of wounds, and in the extraction of arrows, and in the incision above the stone, and similar things; where there is doubt and fear, and death comes to many.
And I warn you not to undertake foolishness.
For many kinds of people come for treatments.
Thus come those who become so angry with their illness that they die easily because of the madness they find from their illness, and from the greatness of their malady; and of these one should be afraid.
And of these there are those who give you their sense, and say: "wait, I am cured"; and the illness is contemptuous.
"You should not agree with those who come to you with this manner, but place greater concern on your honor than on your greed, and do not work foolishly but wisely with that of which you are certain, and from which you can have reward and praise; and use prognosis and indication in cures of your patients for whom health should be restored; and this will help you acquire good renown, and glory, and memory of praise."
"Dearest son, May Our Lord give you good understanding and righteousness, and may He inspire you with the holy inspiration of His hand, amen."
"Now I have arranged this chapter by dividing it into chapters, according to what is before in the chapter on cauterizations, which I have detailed for you from head to foot, so that you may more easily find what you will need."
"of the head full of water"
"Know that this illness comes very often to children at birth, and when the midwife squeezes too hard on the child's head; and sometimes this comes from a hidden cause that one does not know."
"And I never saw this illness except in children, and in all those that I have seen death hastened; and because of this it seems to me better to leave off working in such cures."
"And I saw a child whose head was full of water, and the head grew larger each day until he could not support it; and the moisture grew so much that he died, and this moisture is gathered beneath the bone above the syphac, between the membrane and the bone; and the procedure is such that if the moisture is between the membrane and the bone, and the swelling is small, you should make in the middle of the head a wide incision; and it should be as long as two knuckles, until the moisture runs out; and here is the form of the spatula:"
"If the moisture has increased more, and the swelling is larger, make two incisions in the manner of a cross, according to this form:"
"And if the moisture is beneath the bone, and the signs that you see are the sutures of the head open on each part, and the water jumps out when you press it with your hand from within, and this is not hidden from you: it is necessary that you make three incisions in the middle of the head according to this manner:"
"And after the incision draw all the moisture out."
"Afterward bind the incisions with cloths and powders, and put wine and oil there, and leave thus until the fifth day; then unbind it, and treat the wound with tents and ointments, and let the head be bound evenly, and give the patient dry food with little moisture until the member is strengthened and healed."
"And another manner of incision is that you look where the size of the swelling appears, and the gathering of water; for sometimes it is in front; sometimes behind; sometimes on the right; and sometimes on the left."
"Cut therefore there where the swelling appears, and the filling of water, and split it according to what you have the power to do; and be careful that you do not cut the artery; and blood flow comes, such that the patient dies from the running of blood and the evacuation of moisture."
About rheum (de reume):
"When someone gets a disease called 'catarrh' in the eyes or chest, and the illness is old, and medical treatment doesn't help, then the last treatment is cauterization along with cutting the two arteries."
"Therefore, when you want to cut them, the patient must shave his head; afterward rub the area with a rough cloth until the arteries appear, then the patient should tighten his neck with a cloth; then look where the vein pulses, and the locations of both are behind the ears, and they are slightly hidden; then mark the spots with ink, then cut both with a spatula sharp on both sides, until the cut reaches the bone, and this should be done across the width of the head."
"And if you want, push the spatula under the artery and cut it above, cutting across about two fingers' width."
"And when the vein is cut, the blood jumps up continuously outward."
"And if the artery isn't apparent to touch, you must measure the space of three fingers, then mark with ink and cut to the bone; and what needs to be let out of blood is 6 ounces, and perhaps a little more or less, according to what the patient can bear, and the fullness of the artery; then examine the wound: if any membrane remains on the bone, cut it so that hot abscesses don't form there, then compress the wound and bind it, and treat with ointment until it is healed."
About migraine (de emigrainne):
"When old migraine comes, and acute catarrh, because of moisture from tears and heat in temples and old mad headache and similar things, and it is treated by various medical cures and none of this helps, we extract the arteries of the temples and cauterize them, as we have described."
"And the manner of extracting them is that the patient must shave the hair from his temples, and attend to the artery that appears in the temple, for it appears well by its beating, and is slightly hidden except in some men who are too cold; and if it is hidden, the patient should tighten his neck with some cloths, then rub the area with some rough cloth, and sprinkle the area with hot water until the artery appears clearly; then take the spatula of which here is the form:"
"then carefully skin the hide until you reach the artery, then pull it up with pincers, and separate it well from the membranes that are below it on each side; and if the artery is thin, turn it with the point of the hook, then cut it from that part according to the size of the two ends."
"For if it isn't cut, the blood doesn't flow out completely."
"And draw blood from 6 ounces down to 3; and if the artery is large, you must tie it in two places with a strong double thread of silk, so that rot doesn't come before the healing of the wound, and blood flow occurs; then cut the excess that is between the two ties in that same hour, and then, if you want, cauterize it with the knife-like cautery to the bone until the ends are cut; and this is the best procedure, if the patient doesn't have fever and is of hot complexion."
"For the cautery helps to finish the moistures: therefore it is of greater help for moistures."
"When it is necessary for the extraction of arteries, one should fill the area with old cotton and place well-made tents on top; and when they are untied, treat it with dry medicines that promote flesh growth, and with tents, until it is healed; and if blood flows from the artery while you are working, hasten to cut it with a cautery, or fill the area with vitriol and press with your hand until the blood is stanched; and if you don't have this at hand, place your finger on the spot until the blood congeals, and sprinkle the area with cold water until the bleeding stops, and let it be constrained as needed; and what is better and easier in the extraction of the artery is that you cauterize the vein with this cutting cautery on both sides, but the cutting edges should be quite thick to retain their heat longer."
"For when the instrument is too thin, it retains less heat."
"And there should be one finger's width of space between the two blades, and then when you have marked with ink the two spots, and you place the hot iron on it until it reaches the bone, and cut the vein in two places; and the two ends should be kept apart because it is not entirely sealed by this cautery; and this is the form of the cautery:"
"On tears
When tears from the eyes are descending from the veins that are on the outside of the skull, and no medical treatment helps, and you see the patient's face becoming red, and they feel in the forehead a movement like ants; and their eyes are thin and moist so that the eyelash hairs have fallen out, and the eyelids are heated and scraped by the burning of tears, then this treatment is needed."
"And the ancients called it 'contused treatment', and it is that you should have the patient who has this illness shave the hair they have on their forehead, then make three incisions on the forehead evenly along the length of the forehead; and one of the incisions should be like two fingers right in the middle of the forehead going down to the nose, and the other two on the two sides above the eyelids, and be careful of cutting the arteries that are on the two sides above the eyelids; and keep your hand away from the junction of the two mandibles, and each wound should be the width of three fingers placed together; and have ready a piece of sponge and many dry cloths to wipe away the blood, then insert the sharp spatula pointed on both sides of which this is the form:"
"from the incision that is toward the temple to the second incision; and scrape away all the skin that is between the two incisions along with the membrane that is on the bone, then do the same from the middle incision to the other second one, and then pull out this spatula."
"then insert into the first incision the instrument that is called 'cultellaire', and is very sharp on one side, and on the other side is smooth, not cutting, and this is its form:"
"And place the cutting side toward the flesh attached to the skin, and the smooth side toward the bone, and push it until it reaches the middle incision."
"And cut all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes until the incision is continuous up to what appears of the skin, and then do the same in the middle incision to the outer one; and then draw out the blood evenly, and press the area for the collected blood; then place in each incision a tent of old cotton, and place on top cloths moistened in wine and oil and vinegar, and ensure that no hot swelling develops; and on the third day undo the binding, and apply a large amount of lukewarm water, then treat it with basilicon ointment with rose oil, and with other treatments used to treat wounds, until it is healed."
"On eye discharge/rheum"
When someone gets acute catarrh regularly, and you see the eyes thin and small, and vision weakening, and the eyelids burned; and the hair falls out, and deep in the head there is acute pain, and the patient sneezes; then know by these symptoms that these materials and this catarrh only come from many veins, and the best cure for it is this.
And it is that you command the patient to shave their forehead, then make a large incision in the middle of the forehead, and another one the width of a thumb.
And begin from the cut at the left temple to the right temple, and let the incision go down to the bone; and keep your hand away from the temple nerves that move during eating; and when the bone is exposed, wipe away all the blood with a sponge, and then separate between the two lips of the cut and put old cotton there, and linen tents; then bind above cloths moistened in wine and oil, and guard against hot swelling; when it is removed, you should rub the bone until flesh begins to grow there, then treat it with drying substances that make flesh generate.
In this manner: take two parts of wheat flour, and four parts of colophony, and make a plaster; and apply it to these wounds to generate flesh throughout.
"On blockage of the ears"
Everything that falls in the ears is one of four things: either grains, or beasts, or mine stones or similar things like iron; or seeds, such as vetches, beans, peas; or flowing things such as water and vinegar and similar things.
When a stone falls in the ear or another kind of thing that doesn't stick to the ear, nor grows in the ear, put the ear in the sun.
If you see the stone, drip a little violet oil or sesame oil, then administer extraction; and make them sneeze with condisi, and plug their nostrils when the sneeze comes, and put pieces of cloth or wool around the ear; and stretch the ear upward.
Many times it comes out through this cure; and if it doesn't come out, then administer extraction with subtle pincers, of which here is the form:
If it jumps out with the pincers, that's good; if not, then administer extraction with a subtle hook of small doubling; and if it doesn't jump out through this, then make a brass tube and push the head of the tube into the ear hole firmly, and plug what is around the tube with soft wax so that air cannot enter with the tube; then pull it out strongly, for many times it comes out as we have said; and if it doesn't come out in this way, then take glue with which birds are caught, and put it on the end of some instrument that is suitable for this purpose, and put a little cotton around it; then press the glue on the stone or whatever it may be, and pull out.
And if it doesn't jump out from all these things that we have said, then hasten to split the ear before hot swelling comes, and spasm; and the manner of the splitting is that you first make the patient bleed from the cephalic vein, and draw blood according to the measure of their strength, then make the patient sit between your hands and turn their ear upward, and make a small split in the root of the ear at the fat in the dependent place; and let the split be like a moon, until you come to the stone, then remove it according to your power, and suck it out hastily with your mouth; and treat until they are healed.
And if it is grains that are inside and they swell, then administer extraction; and if it cannot come out, then administer a thin subtle spatula according to this form:
and administer incision of that grain.
But do not do this when you think that the grains are moist from the moisture of the ear, until you have made many pieces of it; then extract it with subtle pincers and by sucking, as we have said, so that the extraction is eased.
In water therefore that falls in the ear, it is necessary that the patient first use sneezing with condisi, and fill the ear with old cotton.
And let them lie on the same ear where the water is.
If it jumps out by this means, that is good.
If not, then take several stones the length of your finger, thin and light, and heat them a little in the fire; and let the patient put one in the opening of their ear, and jump on one of their feet on the other side, and strike another stone against the stone that is in the ear; and do not cease doing this from stone to stone until all the water comes out, and thus it all comes out; and if you wish, take a reed, and put one of the ends in the ear, and set the other end on fire until most of the reed is burnt; then do the same with other reeds until all the water comes out, as we have said with the stone.
For extracting a creature, if it is small in body, like a flea or similar thing, treat it as we have said in the division; but if it is large enough that one can feel it, then administer extraction with pincers; and this is the easiest thing to remove from the ear.
For extracting worms bred in the ears, when you treat it as we have said in the division and in the treatise on distillations, and the treatment does not help, then you must look at the ear in the sunlight: if any worms appear, extract them with fine pincers, and if they don't appear, take the tube of which here is the form:
And let it be narrow below and wide above.
And put the thinner end in the ear according to what the patient can tolerate, then suck strongly with the tube; do this often until all the worms come out.
And if they refuse to come out, then plug around the tube with cotton as I said for the stone; and if they don't jump out as we have said, then administer distillations that the ancients have proven effective in killing worms, and you will find them in the treatise on distillations; and distill your oils and your medicines in the ear with this instrument, of which here is the form as you see:
And let it be of silver or brass, narrow below with a small hole, and open above for distilling; and to press the distillation inside use a well-made brass instrument for this, and if you wish take a razor and wrap cotton suitably around the point; then pour your oil or your juice, and whatever you want of your medicines into the tube, and let the tube be in the ear; then push the razor with the cotton inside, and press your hand moderately until the oil is distilled to the depth of the ear; and let the patient feel it inside, and let the distillations be heated a little in the fire before they are distilled in the ear; and ensure it is not too cold, for the medicine would not be as effective.
On blocked ears
Some children are born who have no hole in their ears; and this same thing happens to men through blockage from wounds, or from flesh grown inside the ear, and this blockage sometimes comes deep in the ear, so that one cannot see it; and sometimes it happens a little outside the hole, and one can see it well.
Therefore that which comes deep, so that one cannot see it, is difficult to heal in many conditions, and in that which one can see it is necessary that you put the patient's ear in the sunlight; and look inside: if you see the blockage apparent, then open it with this spatula of which here is the form:
And let it be sharp and cutting in front and flat behind, so that it does not hurt the ear; if the blockage is from flesh grown in the body of the ear, then hold it with fine pincers, and cut it gently, until all that flesh is removed.
And if the blockage is deep in the ear, then take a fine light razor and heat it a little in the fire, then put it in the body of the ear.
If you feel the blockage where the patient feels difficulty in hearing, pierce gently, and be careful not to damage the nerves of the ear; then put in the ear a tent according to the width of the hole, and moisten it in Egyptian ointment.
Do this for some days until the wound is healed, or take a tent and moisten it in rose water, and powder it with ground vitriol; and if you see the ear swollen, then you should remove the tent and replace it with another tent moistened in a cerote made of rose oil and wax, until the swelling is removed; then treat it until it is healed.
And if bleeding occurs, then plunge a sponge and cloths in cold water, and put it on the ear, and use other treatments that stop bleeding which are in the treatise on distillations.
On the flesh of the eyelids
These growths that come on the eyelids of the eyes when they are moist and are dry, it is necessary that you stretch them with forceps and pincers, and cut them from their roots with a spatula; then put ground vitriol on the spot.
And if blood flows from it, then cauterize it with a subtle lenticular cautery, and cauterizing after the incision works better; and many times they return, when something remains of their roots; and when they are cauterized by fire, these roots are burned and do not return.
On hail (chalazion)
Many times there come in the eyelids of the eyes things that resemble hail in their form and hardness, and for this reason this illness is called "grandine," and it is an accumulation of thick moisture in the upper and lower eyelid; the procedure is thus: observe if the hailstone moves from one side to the other, and this is easy to know; then cut it widely, then peel it carefully from each part, then take it with pincers, and cut it.
If you cannot cut it without piercing the eyelid a little, it does no harm to the patient; and if the cut is large, then close it with a suture, and treat it until it is healed; and if it is small, do not force it, for the ointment will restore it soon and generate flesh.
And if the hailstone is descending to the inside of the eye towards the upper part, then turn the eyelid over, and stretch the hailstone with pincers, and cut it and press from one side and the other; and if the eyelid is separated by the incision, this does no harm; and when the hailstone is cut, then wash the eye with salt water, and treat the area with what generates flesh until the patient is healed.
On the fat of the eyes
Exinach is a fat that is generated in the membranes of the upper eyelids, and this happens more to children than to any other people, and greatly troubles their eyes, and catarrhes come to them in the mornings, and they cannot look at the sunlight because tears rush to their eyes; and for this reason they lie on their faces constantly, and sleep thus, and their eyelids below their eyebrows are moist because the swelling and the appearance have covered the exinach that appears in the eye.
And when you press the spot with your fingers and feel the exinach between them.
And the manner of the procedure is that the patient put his head in your lap; and then take a linen cloth, and prepare a tent in the manner of a circle according to the quantity that contains exinach from each part, then put it on him; and press with your fingers from one side and the other, so that the exinach is gathered in the middle of the circle; then cut in the middle of the moisture with a sharp spatula a cut of the width, and let it not be larger than the wound that one makes when bleeding a vein; and cut the skin deeply until you come to the exinach; and in several dispositions exinach comes from the cut, in the form of a piece of white fat.
Extract it then with a piece of lint cloth between your fingers on the outside, and turn your hand right and left until it is spread out; and take care not to probe into the incision, that you don't go all the way with the spatula to the eye, lest you wound it.
And if the exirnach does not appear at the beginning of the incision, then slightly increase the incision gently until it appears; then extract it as we have said, then moisten cloths in vinegar and water, and put them on the area, and bind with bandages.
And there are some men who grind salt and put it on to dissolve the moisture that remains.
Then treat it until it is healed.
And if a hot abscess comes to the area, treat it with soothing plasters until it is healed.
Of the hairs of the eyelids
When additional hairs grow on the eyelids besides the natural ones, and they have grown old, they harm the eyes, and cause types of diseases such as chronic tears and softening of the eyelids and white spots, such that it is a cause of destruction of the eyes; and the treatment is according to four methods: either by cautery with fire, or by sharp medicine as stated before in the chapter on cautery, and is done either by incision and suture or by chains, as I will describe.
It is necessary that you place the patient's head in your lap, then turn the eyelid of the eye with your left hand; if it is turned over, that is good; if not, then insert a needle with a thread above; and let this be beside the margin of the eyelid where the hair grows next to these hairs, and pull a thread above along with the eyelid, and turn it to the razor; then make an incision in the lower part of the eyelid, below the additional hairs, with the cutting spatula, from the large tear duct to the small one; then pull out the thread, and put under the eyelid a small tent of cotton and cloth, then mark on the eyelid a figure with ink, like a myrtle leaf, and always the figure must be according to the quantity that you wish to lift the eyelid which is divided for all.
And there are some who need a large quantity of the eyelid to be cut according to how softened the eyelid is; then make an incision with the spatula above the two lines that you have marked, and begin from the large tear duct to the small one; and let one of the incisions be near the natural hairs in the thickness of a ray, then insert the hook in one of the two angles of the heart, then skin it all; then join the two lips with a suture of a needle with a fine wool thread, and dry the blood, and make the excess of the threads stick above the two eyebrows with some sticky substances, if you wish to do this; and if not, then don't worry about it, then leave the suture and the threads for three or four days; then treat the wound without suture with drying and constricting things, for the eyelid rises with the healing of the wound and its joining, but the suture is better (as the ancients said), and this is work without fear; and there is another method: and it is that you mark the eyelid with a figure that is like the myrtle leaf, as we have told, with three separate hooks according to the form which is here:
then cut what protrudes with small scissors evenly according to the form which is here:
And if you cannot hold the forceps, and the thing is not even, then take a needle with a thread, and push it through the middle of the figure; and push another thread next to the large tear duct, and the second thread next to the small one, and gather the threads evenly between your fingers; then lift your hand evenly, and lift all the skin on which you have marked, as we have told, then join the two edges of the wound by suture, and treat it until it is healed; and if swelling comes to your incision, then soothe it with wax and similar soothing ointments; and sometimes it happens that the eyelid hairs are turned: so you must use what we have said about the incision; but the suture in both cases is more skillful.
The treatment of the reeds is according to this form: and it is that you turn the eyelid and split it inside according to what I said, and then make two reeds by art, and two subtle ties as long as the eyelid and the width of the spatula is; and cut at the two ends of two parts where you hold the threads; then join one and the other subtly above what protrudes from the eyelid of the eye, and tighten the two reeds of the two parts strongly; and leave it thus for some days, and the skin that was tightened will die and blacken and rot, until it falls by itself.
If it delays, then cut it with scissors, then treat it until it is healed; and when the wound will be sealed, and the eyelid will be raised, and the hairs will no longer prick; and this is the form of the two reeds that you will make according to this figure, and according to this quantity of length and width:
The work is such that you take a subtle needle, and push through it a soft and subtle silk thread; then gather the ends and tie one and the other subtly, and let the length of the threads be one palm long; then arrange in the case another subtle silk thread briefly, and tie the ends of the thread; then put the patient's head in your lap; and let it be near the sun so that the work is illuminated, for this is subtle and minute work, then push the needle with the case into the root of the joined hair, and make it pierce the eyelid hastily until you draw it above the natural hair; then pull the hair up to the case, and push into the case that hair, if there is one or two or three or more; then pull your hand until the hair comes out with the case in the eyelid with the natural hair.
And if the case is pulled and the hair does not come out with it, then you will pull the case below with the thread that you have arranged there, until the case comes out of the hole above and that you see it by the vision of the eye; then you will pull the case and the thread, and close the eye and leave it closed for 2 or 3 days, until the hair adheres in its place and flesh grows over it; and if the hair is small, then accompany it with a long hair from the natural hairs, and let it be raised with that one where you leave it, until it is lengthened and then lift it.
about the rotting of the eye
When this disease which is called "aleacrati" or the rotting comes in the eye, there are two kinds of it: one natural, and the other unnatural.
And it happens by sudden wound, or by cutting or by cautery, and by similar things.
And the manner of working on it is that you split that seal, and separate its edges, and put linen tents inside, and bind it until it is healed; and you must not use in its treatment things that dry and constrain.
For if you do this, the disease comes back worse than the first; but work with softening things, such as fenugreek; and sprinkle it with water where marshmallow and linseed are cooked, and diachilon ointments melted in some of the oils, and wrap a tent in it, and treat it with this.
And the treasure of your treatment is that you take care that it does not seal according to the form it was before; and this work that we have said is nothing but a correction of this disease, that it does not return according to the form it was before.
On flesh that grows in the eye
This disease which is below that is truly called "axacrati," and is both natural and accidental.
The accidental type comes from wounds and cuts and cauterization and similar things; and the way to operate on it is that you take a needle with a double thread, and stick it in the flesh, and pierce it from the left tear duct all the way to the right, so that the thread comes out in two ends from the flesh; then stretch the flesh upward with the needle, and cut it with a wide spatula.
And if the shape of the eyelid returns as it should, that is good; if not, then take a razor and put it in the cut, and turn the eyelid, and make two cuts on the inside edge of the eyelid; and let the ends of the two cuts be at the two angles of the incision that you have cut, and let an angle be made so that when they are joined together, the shape is like that of a letter which is called "Greek I"; then remove that flesh, according to the quantity that its edge is sharp below, from what follows the eyelid, then join the two separated parts, and sew them with a wool thread; then treat it with what we have mentioned of softening medicines, and with dressings, until it is healed.
And if the disease comes from a cut or from suturing or from cauterization, it is necessary that you make a full cut below the hairs of the eyelids, and according to what was mentioned before; then separate between the two lips with a dressing, as I have said; and one must do the operation according to the form of the disease, for it is very diverse in form, and the wise master prepares his skill with all his power to make the shape return to its natural form; and the patient himself, according to what work and instruments are needed in various situations.
On the fusion of the eyelid
When this fusion happens to many men in such a way that the upper eyelid is fused with the white of the eye, and cannot move or perform its natural functions, it is therefore necessary that you push the point of a razor under the eyelid, and lift it up; and stretch it with pincers, until you cut what is attached with a fine spatula, which should not be too sharp or too cutting, so that the patient can bear it without the too-sharp spatula wounding the eye; and let your incision, with which you separate that joining, be gentle, so that the eyelid returns to its natural form; and all that joining is healed, and sometimes they pour salt water in the eye, and wash it with fresh water, and with eye drops; then put between the eyelid and the eye a linen dressing, and put on the eye wool soaked in egg white; and after the third day use eye drops and healing substances until it is healed.
of the eye's ungula [pterygium]
Know that the ungula comes in 2 types: one is sinewy and resembling a hard membrane, and another that is not sinewy, but resembles congealed white moisture, which when touched with iron and one tries to grasp it with forceps, one cannot; and both types begin near the large tear duct, and grow little by little until they cover all vision and all light and the movement of the eye.
And the method of incision is that the patient puts his head in your lap, then open his eyes; and lift the eyelid with your hand, then catch the ungula with small double forceps, and stretch it upward; then take a needle, and put in it a horse hair, or cow hair, or ox hair, and a strong thread; and bend the needle point a little and stick it in the middle of the ungula, and pierce it with the needle, and tie the ungula with a thread and stretch it upward, and scrape with the hair the side of the ungula that follows the pupil and its silk to the hair up to the head, then cut the remainder at the root of the tear duct with the subtle spatula and with small scissors, and leave the natural flesh in the tear duct, so that through the incision the flow of tears does not come habitually; and sometimes the ungula extends to the hook only, and to the thread, as we have said; then one scrapes it with the gentle spatula of which here is the form:
And ensure that the spatula does not touch and break the fleshy membrane, and that the pupil is not pierced; and after the incision cast in the eye a little ground salt, and the collyrium made of litharge, and leave it until the next day; then treat it with what is needed until it is healed.
And if the ungula is not sinewy, and you cannot insert the needle, and the hook cannot enter, many times this type of ungula is cured by medicines; and they grow as I have told in the division, and if you want to cut it, open the patient's eye, and take the light spatula slightly sharpened according to this form:
And shave the ungula above subtly, and if you see that it diminishes at all and the shaving takes effect, then drip from your mouth into the eye collyrium made of litharge and red collyrium and ground salt, and close the eye until the next day; then restart the other work according to this same procedure, until it is all removed.
If something is adverse in the eye, such as hot abscess, then leave it, and first treat the hot abscess until it is healed, then restart the work as before, until it is healed.
And if the appearance of flesh from the tear duct harms the eye significantly, suspend it with the hook, and cut a part of it but not all, so that tear flow does not occur there; then drip red collyrium made of litharge into the eye.
of the flesh that grows on the pupil
In some men's eyes sometimes grows red flesh, and it covers the pupil and constrains upon the eyelids and turns them outward, and looks like a pomegranate flower; and the procedure is that the patient puts his head in your lap, then open his eyes, and gather all that flesh with hooks suitable for this, and hold it firmly; then cut the first flesh, and keep cutting with the razor until the end, and be careful not to wound the eye during the procedure; and let the incision be with the spatula that we mentioned in the incision of the nail and with small forceps with which one removes the sebel, as the illustration after this chapter shows; and when the incision is complete and all the flesh removed, then fill the eye with ground salt or apply red collyrium and similar corrosive medicines, and put cotton with egg white on the outside of the eye, so that it is protected from hot inflammation; and if anything remains, and hot blood overwhelms you, and you fear hot inflammation, then leave the eye and treat the inflammation with things that calm hot inflammation; then return to your procedure until it is healed, and do likewise when flesh has accumulated in the eye in this manner.
However, it is necessary that you ease the treatment of each weak eye by the natural way; and by the accidental way, in work with iron; and do not put your hand to any of these procedures until you see that this member can bear that procedure.
of the veins of the eyes
Sebel are red veins that are covered over the eye, and they hinder the sight's function and weaken the eye continuously.
It is necessary then first that you look if the eye, in which sebel is, is strong, and has no other illness except the sebel; then gather it in this manner: command the patient to put his head in your lap, then suspend those veins with all the hook according to your wisdom, and let the hook be subtle double according to this form:
And let there be two hooks by degrees in one body according to this form:
then gather those veins subtly with forceps, and wipe the blood hour after hour, until you see those veins remove from the eye; and be careful not to wound the eye with the points of the spatulas, and do this procedure at noon before the sun, and be very fervent in your procedure so that you cut nothing but those veins; and when you have done this, then drip green and red collyrium in the eye to corrupt what remains of the sebel.
And if you don't have the power to gather all this in that hour, then make a plaster on the eye of things that calm the pain of eyes, and leave it some days until the pain is calmed and is secured from hot inflammation, then begin again according to this manner which is before until it is healed; and this is the form of the forceps:
On the eye fistula
The physicians call "arissati" fistula: when you treat it by cautery and by sharp burning medicine as I have said before, and it is not healed, here is a technique where you make an incision above the abscess, there where it should ripen, and draw out all the moisture that is there, until the bone is exposed.
And when the bone is exposed, and you see the corruption and the blackness, then scrape it with the instrument of which here is the form; and it is called "rough head", and should be made of Indian iron with a round head, and should be pointed like a file as it is in the present form:
And put it on the place of the corrupted bone, then turn it between your fingers, and press your hand a little until you know that this corruption is scraped; and do this several times, then restore the place with drying medicines.
If the place is sealed, and flesh grows there, and the body of the wound is sealed, and remains so for 40 days, and it does not renew and is not swollen, and no bad accidents come, know that it is healed; if not, there is no other technique than to bring the fistula to the hole of the nerve according to this form: which is that you expose the bone a second time by iron, and by sharp medicines, and when it is exposed then take a drill according to this form, and let the head be of iron with 3 angles, and the shaft be thinned to the head as you see here:
Then put it on the bone beside the tear duct, and distance your hand from the eye a little, then turn with the drill until it pierces the bone and the patient feels it because the wind comes out if he holds his hand over his nose; and then restore the place with dry medicines, as I have taught you, and when the flesh grows and the place hardens, then the matter goes to the nerve; so it is an easier thing for the patient.
On the protrusion of the eye
When the eye appears completely outside, and there comes no disturbance to the nerve, nor diminishment, then you must bind the patient; then bleed him, then put cupping glasses on the nape without cutting to suction, then put on the eye a bandage made of acacia and aloe and incense and sarcocolla, and then compress the eye, and plaster it over with bands and cloths; and the manner of the cloths is that you take cloths quite soft, and fold each in 4, and then put one on top of the other according to the quantity that the eye needs; then compress it from above with a hard band strongly, and restart the cupping glasses to suction without cutting; then remove the cupping glasses and leave the eye compressed day and night, and if the bandage loosens, then you must compress it much; then remove the bandage after the day and night, and if you see the eye return, that is good; if not; then restart the plaster and the cloths and the bandage and the cupping glasses until it is healed.
On the rupture of the uveal membrane
When rupture comes in the uveal membrane, then appears, and comes out of the eyelids like a grape seed, and is frightful to see; then if you want to cut it, the procedure is such that you push a needle into the root from the lower part to the upper part, then push another needle which has a double thread from the part of the tear duct; and make it pierce through, and leave the first needle according to the disposition; then cut the place of the double thread and tie one part of the uvea around, and tighten it well, then remove the needle and put on the eye wool moistened in egg white; and leave it until the thread falls with the uvea, then treat the eye with comforting things until the wound is healed; and sometimes the wound is restrained by the uvea each part with a circle of cloth, until it is healed.
And if the eye gives great appearance, then pierce it with a subtle spatula which comes deep into the eye, and let the albuminous moisture run and let the eye descend, and enter in immediately; then remove it until it is healed.
"pus of the eye"
This disease which is called "alcunnati" is nothing but pus that has gathered in the eye, appearing like descending water, but it is not water; and the manner of performing the operation is that you make the patient sit on a prepared and upright seat, then take their head between your hands on both sides, and move it until you see the pus come to the top before your eyes; then it should be fixed there, and should not descend and the light should be cleared, and the patient should see things as they used to; and if it doesn't descend below, know that it is water, and if the descent of the pus is not arranged as we have said.
Then make the patient sit between your hands, then take the fine spatula and make an incision on the corneal membrane a little at the junction of the conjunctiva with the corneal membrane and the corona, until the pus comes out; and when it has come out, then drip into the eye hot water mixed with honey, or water in which fenugreek has been boiled and honey, then treat it with other treatment until it is healed.
"waters of the eye"
We have already [discussed] the appearances of the waters in the division, and what is needed for piercing; so operate according to health.
It is necessary that you make the patient sit between your crossed hands, away from the sunlight, and bind their healthy eye very tightly; then put the eyelid of the eye in your left hand if the eye is left, or in your right hand if the eye is right; then take in your right hand, if the eye is left, the instrument which is called "almagda," or in your left hand, if the eye is right; then place the point of the instrument beside the corona by the thickness of a ray in that whiteness of the eye at the part of the lesser tear duct, then push the instrument called "almagda" forcefully, and turn your hand until it pierces into the whiteness of the eye, and feel that almagda comes to the empty thing; and the measure of the almagda's path should be to the depth of the measure of the space which is from the pupil up to the end of the blackness; and this is the corona of the eye; thus you will see the bone in that eyelid through the clarity of the corneal membrane, and you can put the instrument up to where the water is, then press it down one path after another.
If the water descends immediately, then the patient sees before them and the instrument in their eye.
Afterward rest a little, and if the water rises again the second time, put it out with the instrument, and when it is fixed in there and does not rise, then draw out almagda gently while turning your hand little by little; and then put back in the water a little rock salt, and wash the eye inside with this.
Then put outside the eye tow or wool moistened in rose oil and egg white, and bind it with the healthy eye.
We, and those of our time, put on ground cumin with egg white.
And if almagda cannot enter the eye due to its hardness, for there are such men who have very hard eyes, then it is necessary that you take the instrument which is called "alberit," of which here is the form:
And then pierce only the conjunctiva, and do not go too deep, but make a fine opening, then insert almagda, as we have said; and at the completion of the work prepare for the patient a suitable bed, in which they should sleep on their back in a dark place; and they should be forbidden from all movements, and take light foods, and not move their head neither to right nor to left, and should be bound according to their condition until the third day; then unbind them in that same dark house, and test their sight, and make them see some things, and then put the binding back until the seventh day; and you should not do this at the time of the treatment or immediately after the incision, but you should delay this, because the water rises hastily.
If hot swelling comes, you should unbind the eye before the seventh day, and treat it with that which soothes swelling; and when it is calmed, then unbind the sight and put on their face a small pillow to cover for some days, and they should remain always in that dark house.
And then leave the house little by little, and return to your affairs; and know that no disciple should intervene in this case.
And one came to us who was from Iraq, who told us that in his country they made perforated almagda, with which they suck water, but nevertheless I never saw any in our land, nor did I ever read of it in books of the ancients; and perhaps it is a new thing.
And these are the appearances of the forms of almagda, so that those who do not know them may see them; and they should properly be made of brass:
And their heads should be of the same subtlety, and the back end in three sharp angles.
of the flesh on the nose
Sometimes diverse flesh growths appear on the nose, of which some resemble scorpions with many feet; and there are some where there is cancerous flesh of dark color, and there is soft flesh of good color.
For those flesh growths that are soft, and not cancerous, you should have the patient sit between your hands facing the sun; and open his nostrils, and insert the hook into those flesh growths, and pull them out; then cut what you can hold with the subtle spatula sharp on one side, until you know that all that flesh is removed.
And if something remains that cannot be cut, then work it with one of the subtle instruments gently, so that nothing remains; and if blood overwhelms you, or hot swelling, then treat it as needed; and if it is a malignant swelling, then hurry and cauterize it until the blood is stanched and all flesh is removed, then put vinegar and water or wine in the nose.
If the nose opens, and moisture comes down to the palate, know that it is healed; and if moisture does not penetrate as it should, know that there is flesh grown on the bone above, which the instrument cannot reach to cut: then you must insert a somewhat thick linen thread, and it should be tied with several knots, and have between each knot a finger's width or less; and have the patient put the end of the thread in his nose as far as he can, and pull while breathing in until it comes through the nose into the mouth; and many times children do this in schools, and it is an easy thing for one who wants to do it; then hold the end that comes through the nose with one hand, and the other end that comes through the mouth with the other hand, and pull one after the other while sawing with the knots that are on the thread.
Do this until you know that the knots have corrupted that flesh, then pull out the thread, wipe the blood, and moisten the thread in Egyptian ointment, and put it back in the nose as before; do this for three days or more, until the ointment corrodes all that remains of flesh; and then put a lead tube in the nose for some days until it is healed, and if it needs drying medicines, use them; and this is the form of the instrument for purging the head, with which oils and medicines are distilled in the nose:
And it should be of silver or brass, resembling an open lamp, like a tube, and the conduit also; and if you want, make a closed tube, and let the instrument be full for purging the head; and have a handle at the end to hold it when heating the oil or any liquid.
of the flesh on the nose
Many times there grows at the tip of the nose a disease that is called "telul", and it grows and becomes ever larger, until it is an ugly thing to look at; and therefore you should cut it at the beginning, and remove it all out, then put on the place the cautery or the burning medicine; and if one delays cutting it until it is large, then observe if it is hard, of dark color, of poor sense: do not touch it with iron for it is a cancerous growth, for when one cuts it sometimes, great harm comes to the patient; and if the growth is soft to touch, not of dark color, and you see that it can all be cut away, then prepare the patient and cut it without fear, and treat the place with drying and astringent things.
when the nose is cut and sewn
Know that when a solution of continuity comes in one of these cartilaginous works, it profits little, except in some men.
So when this happens to someone, look if the wound is fresh with all its blood; and then join the two lips with a suture, then treat it until it heals; and if the lips are already separated on one side and the other, you must scrape all parts of their core until they bleed, then join the two lips with a suture, and tighten it, and powder with dragon's blood powder, and ground incense; and put on the powders a piece of strong plaster or other binding plaster, and leave it until it falls off by itself, then treat it with ointment until it heals.
The manner of suturing is that you join the solution: either with needles, as we have said in the suturing of the belly; or with thread, as I have made known to you.
of the apostemes of the lips
In many men there occurs inside the lips a hard aposteme, resembling grains of vetch, both smaller and larger; then you must turn the lips, and cut above each node, and take it with tweezers and cut it in each part; then fill the place after the incision with ground vitriol, until the blood is stanched; and then wash it with vinegar, and treat the place with dry things until it heals.
of the flesh of the gums
Many times grows on the gums added flesh, which the ancients call "albulus"; so you must hold it with tongs, and cut it at its root, and let the pus or blood flow; then put on the place ground vitriol, or other astringent and desiccative powders; and if that flesh returns after the incision, which often happens, cut it a second time, and cauterize it: it will not return after the cautery; and these are the forms of instruments for cutting.
of the filth
Sometimes there are gathered at the head of the teeth, inside the mouth between the gums, shells that are ugly and rough; and sometimes the teeth are black and citrine and green, so much that the corruption comes to the gum, and the teeth are foul; so you must have the patient sit between your hands, and his head should be in your lap, and scrape the teeth where the shells appear, until nothing remains; and do the same with the blackness and the greenness, and the yellowness and other stains, until they are cleaned; and if what is there is removed at the first scraping, that is good; if not, then begin scraping again the second day and the third, until you have scraped everything; and know that the teeth need different forms of instruments for scraping, according to what the work demonstrates, because the scrapers used outside the teeth have other forms than those used between the teeth; and these forms and others should be prepared with you.
It is necessary when you treat the tooth for its pain that you delay pulling it as long as you can, for this must not be done; for it is a very noble substance until there is no excuse for scraping.
Then when the patient is constrained to pull it, you must be certain of the aching tooth.
Many times the pain deceives the patient, and he thinks it is in the healthy tooth, and has the good tooth pulled; and yet the pain does not depart because of this, until the bad one is extracted, for we have already seen this happen to these lords; and when you are quite certain of the aching tooth, you must scrape around the tooth with a strong spatula to protect the gum on all sides; then move it with your fingers or with subtle tongs at first little by little, until it is well loosened, then firmly fix the tongs; and let the patient's head be in your lap between your knees, and hold him well so that he does not move.
After, extract the tooth straight without breaking it, and if it doesn't come out, then take one of these instruments and gently insert it on each side, and move it as you did at first.
And if the tooth is pierced and eaten away, you should fill it with small cloths where the holes are; and grip it carefully with pincers, so that it doesn't break when gripping; and you must work very carefully around the gum to loosen the tooth.
And be very careful not to break it, with a part remaining, and greater pain than the first returning to the patient due to the malice of the root.
And beware not to do as the ignorant healers do, who through their haste and boldness sometimes break the jaw, and don't administer what we have described; but sometimes cause great illness through this occasion due to the roots that remain, or due to the jaw they break, as we have often seen; and when the tooth is extracted, wash the area with wine or vinegar and salt; and if bleeding occurs, which often happens, fill the area with ground vitriol; and if that doesn't work, cauterize it.
The forms of the instruments, with which one first moves the teeth, should have long points and thick handles, so they don't bend when you pull the tooth; and these are the forms:
And they should have thick members so they don't bend when pulling, and should be made of well-crafted Indian iron, and should be toothed for better grip.
concerning the roots of teeth
When the root remains after extraction, you should place cotton soaked in butter on the area for one or two days,
until the area is softened, then insert the pincers called "algefri," whose head resembles a swan's beak; and they should be made inside like a file and this is the form:
And if the roots won't come out with these pincers, you must uncover the flesh all around the root, and insert the instrument called "althali," that is to say a lever, of which here is the form:
And it should be strong and thick so it doesn't break, and if the root comes out by this, that's good; if not, then help yourself with all the instruments, of which the forms come hereafter:
And one can also use this instrument which has two prongs, of which here is the form:
And other iron tools which are used in front for scraping teeth, and this instrument which resembles large forceps, of which here is the form:
And this instrument should be strong so it cannot break, and know that there are many dental instruments; and also other instruments, which are not counted; and the wise subtle master finds his own instrument by himself, according to what his work and the disease shows him, for there are such diseases where the ancients did not teach any instrument due to their diversity; and if any part of the jaw or other bones breaks, or it rots, then search for the instruments that are needed, which I have told you about, and help yourself with the tools, of which here is the form:
And they should be thick and grip well to hold the bone, so it doesn't escape, but can be held and removed; and then restore the place with medicines suitable for this, and if there is rot in the bone, and it is small, then scrape it with this instrument:
When teeth appear not according to natural form, and the shape is ugly, especially in young women, it is necessary that you know if the tooth grew after another tooth, and is not in the right place, and cannot be sawed or filed: then scrape it; and if it is attached to another tooth, take this instrument of which here is the form, and it resembles a small beak, and should be made of sharp Indian iron at the tip:
And cut it little by little over several days due to the hardness of the tooth, and so that you don't move the others, and if it appears that it can be filed, then file it with such a file as shown here:
And it is like the file used to make needles; and file the tooth little by little over several days gently, so that it doesn't move until it falls; then smooth it at the end with some rasp, and if the tooth is too sharp and hurts the tongue, it's necessary to file the roughness until it's even, so that it neither hurts the tongue nor impairs speech.
When teeth are loose
When front teeth are loose, either from a blow or from falling, and the patient cannot press on what they eat without them falling, and you have treated them with astringent medicines, and this doesn't work; then they must be secured with a gold wire, for silver wire turns green and rots, but gold never changes; and the wire should be medium, neither too thick nor too thin, according to the size of the space between the teeth; and if you want to straighten the teeth, take the wire and push it double between two healthy teeth, then put the ends between the loose teeth, if there are one or more, until you carefully reach the healthy tooth on the other side; then begin the covering again until the part where you started, and tighten your hand subtly and carefully, so that it doesn't move at all; and your binding should be at the root of the tooth so it cannot escape.
Then cut the ends of the wire with pliers, and join them, and hide them between the healthy teeth, and put it so that it doesn't hurt the tongue; and then leave it tight as long as it can stay, and if it comes undone, or the wire breaks, tighten it with another wire; it will stay and serve thus all its time, and this is the form of the teeth and the figure of the straightening of the two healthy teeth, and the two loose ones, as you see:
And when a tooth falls out, put it back in its place, fresh to fresh, as we have said; and let no one undertake this who is not wise and patient, and sometimes one makes the form of a tooth from cow bone, and puts it in the place where there is a gap, and tightens it as we have said, and it stays and serves thus for a long time.
On cutting the tongue-tie
Sometimes this tie that comes under the tongue is either natural, that one is born with it; or by accident from a healed wound; and the procedure is such that you open the mouth of the patient, and hold their head in your lap, and lift the tongue; then cut the nervous tie widthwise, until the tongue is freed from its restraint, and if there is hardness or knot, and this is from wound healing, then insert the hook and cut that tie widthwise; and be careful that the cut is not too deep, because of the artery that is below; and when you have done this, wash the area with rose water and vinegar, or with cold water, then put a linen tent under the tongue; and the patient should hold it each night, so that the area cannot heal shut.
And if bleeding occurs, put ground vitriol on the area; and if the blood overcomes you, cauterize it with the lentil-shaped cautery, which is good for this; then treat it with other treatment until it is healed,
and if you see it is of dark color or black or hard, such that the patient cannot feel it, do not touch it at all, for it is cancer; and if it is tending toward whiteness, and there is moisture, insert the hook, and cut it with a thin spatula, and free it from one side to the other; and if the blood overcomes you in your work, put ground vitriol on it until it is stanched, then return to your work until you draw everything out; then wash the area with vinegar and salt, and treat it with other treatments until it is healed.
On abscesses of the throat
Sometimes swellings come inside the throat which are called "godath," and they are properly called the two tonsils, and when you treat them, as we have said in the division, and they are not healed, then take note: if it is a hard abscess with little sensation and of dark color, do not touch it with iron.
And if it is red and the root is thick, do not touch it with iron, also because of bleeding; but leave it until it is ripe, and then you will split it, or it will break by itself; and if it is of white color, round, and the root is thin, then have the instrument for cutting ready, but first look to see if the hot abscess has settled and is calmed.
Then have the patient sit before the sun, and their head should be in your lap, and open their mouth and let the assistant take it between his hands, and press the tongue down with the instrument, of which here is the form; and it should be of silver or of fine brass like a knife:
When you press the tongue with this instrument, and you see the abscess, take the hook and fix it in the tonsil, and draw it out upward as much as you can; and draw some of the membranes with it, then cut it with the instrument, of which here is the form, that resembles scissors; and always the heads are curved, and one toward the other, and are very sharp, and is made of Indian iron or steel:
And if you do not have this instrument present, then cut it with pincers, of which here is the form:
And let it be sharp on one side, and not on the other; and when you have cut one of the tonsils, cut the other in the same manner, and after the incision have the patient gargle with hot water, and water and vinegar, and if bleeding occurs, have the patient gargle with water in which pomegranate peels or myrtle leaves have been boiled, and similar things, until the blood is stanched; then treat until healed; and sometimes other swellings grow in the throat besides the two tonsils, so cut them just as you would cut the two tonsils equally.
And I treated a woman for a swelling that had grown inside her throat, that is to say a swelling of little sense; and it had nearly closed the entire throat, so that the woman could not breathe through the passage which was blocked, and could neither eat nor drink, and would have died if she had remained so for a day or two.
And the swelling had already grown so much that it had pushed out two branches through the two nostrils.
I therefore hastened at once, and inserted a hook into one, then pulled it out, and drew out a large portion of pus; then I did the same in the other nostril, and opened her mouth and pressed her tongue; after I inserted the hook in these swellings, and cut away a part, and only a little blood came out; and thus the passage of the woman's throat was unblocked, and she immediately began to drink water and then wine, and I did not cease cutting away at this swelling for a long time; and the swelling would always grow back, and fill the space that I had emptied, until it became very large again; then I devised a way and cauterized it inside the throat: thus it remained without growing; and I departed from these parts, and knew not what God did with her after me.
of the uvula
When rheum descends to the uvula, and it is swollen and long, it is called "perpendicular"; and if it is thick and round at the bottom, it is called "uvula."
When it is treated as we have said in the division, and the treatment does not help, and you see that the hot swelling has subsided, and it is thin, then you must cut it; and that which is round and gathered and not long; and if it is bloody or of dark color or black, you must avoid cutting it.
For there is great peril for the patient.
It is necessary therefore, when you see it, according to the manner I have described, of its whiteness and its length, that you have the patient sit before the sun, and press the tongue with the instrument of which we have made mention above; then insert the hook in the uvula, and pull it down, and cut it with one of the two instruments that I mentioned in the cutting of the two tonsils.
And you must not cut away more than the excess that is beyond the natural limit; for if you cut more, you harm the voice and speech; and after the incision, use what we have mentioned in the cutting of the two tonsils, and treat until it is healed.
And if the patient is afraid of cutting, then you must use skill in cauterizing it without fear.
And the manner of cautery is with a sharp needle.
And it is that the patient puts his head in your lap, and then press the tongue with the instrument that we mentioned in the chapter on cautery, and mix with quicklime, so that it is neither too thick nor too clear; and fill the hollow of this instrument, of which here is the form:
And have at the head a hollow where one puts the medicine, like the hollow of a spoon, and put the instrument with all the medicine on the uvula; and the patient should lie on his side, so that the saliva and mucilage flows from his mouth from the medicine within, so that it does not descend to the throat and hurt him; then hold your hand with all the medicine and press it on the uvula for half an hour, until you see it blacken and the burning of the medicine is calmed; and if you wish, take cotton and wrap it on some instrument, and wet the cotton in the medicine, and push the instrument with the cotton in the tube above, until the cotton adheres to the uvula; and do this often, until the cautery is perfect, then let it dry, and it falls after 4 or 5 days. And if you need to restart the cautery with the medicine, then restart it, and after the cautery wipe around the uvula with cotton soaked in butter, and clean what is around from the medicine; and let it be sprinkled with cold water, and be treated with gargles until it is healed.
This cure is safer than incision or cautery; if it is treated with fumigation according to this manner, take calamint and hyssop and oregano and rue and chamomile and southernwood and similar herbs, and gather them all or some of them in a pot, and put vinegar in it, and make it boil; and the pot should be well sealed with strong earth, and in the middle of the pot have a hollow instrument according to this manner:
And let it be of silver or brass, and let one of the ends be put in the patient's mouth so that the vapor rises to the uvula through the tube, until the uvula is mortified; after that restart often, until the uvula dries, and be careful not to do this at the beginning of the arrival of hot swelling, because many things can happen; and do not do this except at the decline of hot swelling.
And if this instrument is not present, then take a tube and put inside the head an eggshell, so that the patient's mouth does not get too hot; for the eggshell does not let the vapor harm the mouth, and this is a good cure together with safety.
Many times a bone or fish spine, or some thing sticks to the throat; so it is necessary that you pull out what you can see, and press the tongue in the sunlight with the instrument, so that you see the thing better; and what does not appear to you and is hidden in the throat, it is necessary that you make the patient vomit before the food is digested in the stomach; perhaps the stuck thing will come out through vomiting; or let the patient swallow a piece of sponge, or a piece of turnip, or a lettuce root, or a piece of dry bread; and tie a thread to the sponge, and then let him swallow it; and when it comes to the place, it will stick, and then you will pull it out; and if it does not come out from what we have said, then take a lead instrument according to this form:
And let the instrument be curved at the head so that it can more easily enter the throat, and have the head raised high; and be careful not to touch the epiglottis, lest coughing come to him, nor push the bone inward; and it is better that the patient puts in the instrument himself, because he better knows where the thing is stuck; so push it down, or pull it out with the instrument evenly, until it is out.
On the leech in the throat
Sometimes the leech is treated, as I said in the section, through the treatment of medicines; and when this does not help, then look in the patient's throat in sunlight, after you press their tongue with the instrument I told you about.
And if you see the leech, pull it out with a small hook, or with fine forceps that are suitable for this.
And if this doesn't work, take a hollow reed, and put it in the patient's throat, then put a hot iron in the hollow of the reed, and do this often.
And let the patient abstain from water all day.
Then take a glass full of cold water, and open the mouth, and pour it in without swallowing, and move it with their hand often; and as soon as the leech feels the water, it falls.
And if it doesn't fall as we have said, fumigate the patient with asafoetida, using the instrument that I mentioned for the fumigation of the uvula; do this many times, for it will fall without delay.
And the manner of fumigation is that you take a pot containing live coals, and let the pot be covered with a lid pierced in the middle, and in that hole should be the head of the instrument; then add your fumigation, and the patient should put the head of the reed in their mouth, and close the mouth, so that the smoke doesn't escape, but reaches the leech; and the leech will fall immediately, and if it doesn't fall, repeat the fumigation many times; and let the patient suffer thirst, and eat salty things and garlic, and drink no water; and then it will be necessary that it comes out through this treatment.
And the form of the instrument with which one pulls out the leech, when one can see it, is similar to curved forceps to better enter the throat; and it should resemble a swan's beak, and have roughness like a file, so that what it grips, it cannot release; and here is its form:
The chapter on abscesses
There are many types of abscesses, according to what is remembered here after one and another in this book, and they are different in perforation and in cutting; and this is in two ways, one of which is in its very appearance, and in what moisture it contains.
And the second way is according to the places where they are on the body.
For the abscess of the head is different from that of the fundament, and the abscess of the fleshy place is different from that which comes in joints, and each has its judgment in the work.
And there are abscesses that one must not pierce until the pus is mature according to its completion; and there are some that must be pierced when they have grown, and do not mature according to their completion, like abscesses that are near joints.
For when an abscess comes near joints, and one leaves it until it is rotted around, by chance the ligaments and nerves of the joint are corrupted, which is the cause of contraction in that limb.
Or the abscess is near the principal member, and if you delay the perforation until it is mature, it will harm the principal member; or it is near the fundament, so one pierces it before it is mature; and one must not pierce a grown abscess without complete digestion, except for that which is near the fundament, lest it rot deeply, and be prolonged inside, and a fistula come there; and it cannot heal for a long time.
And you must know the time of perforation of the abscess which is mature according to completion, and this is when the pain is calmed, and the departure of the fever, and the lessening of the pain and of the redness, and of the throbbing and of the sharpness of the head of the abscess, and the other signs; and you must make the perforation at the most dependent place of the abscess, and where it appears best; and let the perforation be lengthwise of the body, and if the abscess is on the hands or feet, or in joints and on nerves and arteries, and in all equal places where there is no folding.
In those that bend, according to that member.
When an abscess is in a fleshy area, it is better that you leave the perforation until complete digestion is confirmed, as we have said.
For if you pierce it before that, the course of its venom will be prolonged, and it is full of much filth; and perhaps the lips and its depths will harden.
And there are some abscesses that are pierced according to the width of the body, according to what the limb needs.
And it is necessary that you make small holes for small abscesses; and for large abscesses, large holes, and many incisions according to the appearance of the size of the abscess; and there are such abscesses where it is necessary to hollow out the core, and cut; when it has already become like a cloth, and is deadened, it is necessary to do as one does with pustules: and there are some that are cut in three angles, and there are some where one cuts like the leaf of a myrtle, as with abscesses in the corners; and there are some where one makes a round cut, and other cuts and similar incisions.
Those that have no head, like a superficial soft abscess, it is necessary that you pierce them plainly; and it is necessary when the abscess is large, and it has collected much pus, and you pierce it, do not draw out all the pus at that hour, but draw out a part; then plug the abscess until the next day, then draw out some again; do this many times gradually, until all the pus comes out; especially if the patient is of weak constitution, or a pregnant woman, or small child, or decrepit old man.
For the spirit sometimes escapes with the exit of the pus, so that by chance the patient dies, and you do not perceive it.
Avoid therefore this chapter with great caution, and when you have pierced your abscess, dry the wound, and look if the wound of the abscess is small; and if it is a plain cut, administer tents of linen or old cotton; and if it is a large abscess, and there are many holes, it is necessary that you put in each one a tent so that they come one against the other; and if you have cut a part of the skin in the abscess, and you have hollowed it around, it is necessary that you fill it with old cotton or with scraping of linen cloths without moisture, and bind it until the third day; then remove it, and treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And if bleeding occurs in your operation, administer cold water and vinegar, and wet a cloth, and put it on the bleeding place many times.
And if the bleeding persists, administer treatment and cure, and the powders that I have mentioned in many places in this book, and if it is in winter time, and the place where the abscess is is very sinewy, it is necessary that you put on tents and cloths moistened in wine and in hot oil; and if it is in summer, and the place is fleshy, it is necessary that you put on cloths moistened in water and oil, or in wine and cold oil, until the third day, as we have said; and then unbind the abscess and dry it and treat it, as is necessary, until it is healed.
And this must be known universally in cures of abscesses: now I have told you how one must proceed with cures of abscesses, and here is the chapter.
About tumors
In the flesh of the head come small swellings, and they are types of nodes that are in membranes, like a hen's crop, and there are many varieties of them.
Some are fatty and some contain moisture like pus; and there are some that are hard and stone-like when cut, and there is no doubt unless the artery poses a problem.
And the procedure of cutting is that you examine with an instrument called an "probe," whose form comes hereafter, what it contains.
For if it contains moisture, split it lengthwise from above.
And when the moisture is emptied, peel off without leaving anything the skin that contains this moisture, for it always returns when something is left; then soak cotton in Egyptian ointment, if it is available; if not, in water and salt, and fill the wound with it, and leave it until the next day; and this will corrupt what remains of the nest.
And then restart with the cotton, as before, the second day, and the third, until you know well that none of the nest remains; then treat the wound with a suitable ointment until it is healed.
And if the swelling contains a fatty node, cut it according to this form, lengthwise; and insert your hooks, and peel it from all sides, and put all your effort into drawing out the sac in which it lies; and if the artery poses a problem, do what I told you after.
And do the same for the swelling if it is stone-like, both in cutting and treating as I told you.
And the cut above the stone-like swelling and the moist one is easier, for they contain little blood.
And there are some of these swellings in the head where there is no moisture, and of these was a swelling that I cut from an old woman's head; and I found the swelling like a deaf stone, rough and white, and could not break; and if one had struck someone with it, it would have made a wound just like a stone.
In other swellings coming to the head, except those that come to children's heads and at the roots of the ears, the opening should always be at the lowest point, to better drain the pus; and treat them as appropriate.
About scrofulas
Many times these swellings come to the neck, and under the armpits, and in the groins, and sometimes come elsewhere in the body, and are numerous, and are engendered one with another.
And each scrofula is properly within its sac, like the nodes and swellings of the head, as we have said; and the appearances of these scrofulas are many.
There are some that contain moisture, and there are malignant ones that will not yield to health.
Therefore in those that you see of good disposition to the touch, and are similar to the color of the body, and move from each side and are not attached to the nerves of the neck nor to the artery nor to the passage, and are not deep; it is appropriate that you cut it from above, and peel it from each part, and spread the two lips of the flesh with hooks, if you need them, as we have said in swellings of the head; and draw it little by little, and be sure that you do not cut the nerve or the vein, and let not the spatula be sharp or cutting, lest the hand slip, and do not go too far forward, lest you cut what you should not.
And if you cut the vein or the artery, and this prevents you from working, put ground vitriol in the wound, or some powders that stop blood, and bind the wound; and leave it until the swelling has calmed, and the wound has softened, and begins to rot.
And when the blood is stopped, return to your work, until you complete it; then search with your index finger if any small scrofulas remain, and cut them and clean them out.
And if there is a large vein in the root of the scrofula, you should not cut this scrofula at its root, but tie it with a strong double thread, and let it fall off by itself, without harm; then fill the wound with old cotton soaked in Egyptian ointment, then treat it.
And if you cut out the entire scrofula, it is necessary that you bring together the two lips of the wound, and sew them immediately, since no superfluity has remained due to the size of the scrofula.
It is necessary that you focus on cutting its root, and pulling it out, and sew it as we have said.
Those scrofulas that contain superfluity, pierce there where it appears ripe; and pierce it like the aforementioned one, downward, then apply tents with ointment and similar things, so that it corrupts what remains of the corruption; and when the wound is well cleaned, treat it with flesh-generating ointment until it is healed.
On quinsy
The ancients spoke and talked about cutting the throat; but I never saw anyone in our land who did it, and this is the writing of their words.
For those who have quinsy, it is necessary that the split of the throat which is called "epiglottis" be avoided; and that no aid be given through this, because all the veins and the lung of the sick person are like those who have hot aposteme in the mouth, or in the throat or in both tonsils.
When the illness is in the windpipe, it is necessary to cut the epiglottis to avoid the destruction that comes from strangulation.
It is necessary therefore, when we want to split the epiglottis, that we split it below three or four rings with a small crosswise split, between the two rings or by the quantity of the split of the membrane, not in the cartilage; and this place is suitable for the section of the epiglottis as there is no flesh there, and the vessels are far from there.
And if the master is fearful, it is necessary that he stretch the skin of the throat with a hook, then split the skin until he reaches the windpipe; and avoid the blood vessels, if you see any, and then cut the membrane, as we have said; and it is shown by the section of the phlegm of the windpipe which jumps out through the place that is broken, and by the loss of voice; and leave the wound open for a while.
And when the hour has passed during which one fears strangulation, bring together the two lips of the skin wound, and sew it alone without the cartilage; then administer medicines that make flesh grow, until it is healed.
Albucasis says that one should not do this until the throat is completely blocked, and the patient is judged to be dying, and breath fails him.
Then one cuts the epiglottis because the patient cannot breathe, and he breathes through the wound, and thus is saved from death; and for this reason the ancients commanded to leave the wound open until the malice of the illness has passed, and it passes in three or four days. And then they commanded to sew the wound and treat it, until it was healed; and I will tell you what I saw.
I saw that a young lady took a knife, and stuck it in her throat, and cut part of the windpipes; and I was called to treat her, and found her as if dead.
I uncovered the wound, and found the blood that had come out of it, and knew well that she had not cut any vein or passage except the throat, and the wind came out through the wound.
I hurried, and sewed the wound, and treated it until it was healed; and nothing happened to the young lady except that she became hoarse of voice, and returned afterward to her disposition; therefore I say that in the cutting of the epiglottis there should be no fear.
About the thick throat
This abscess is called "throat hernia," and is a large abscess the color of a pea, and is common in women; and it is of two types: natural and accidental; for the natural one there is no remedy.
And the accidental one is of two types, of which one resembles fatty nodes, and the other type resembles an abscess that comes from arterial nodes; and there is danger, and one should not operate with iron except on those that are small, and test and examine it with the probe: if you find it like a fatty node, and it's not attached to any vein, then cut it, as one cuts nodes, and remove it with its membrane, if there is any; and examine everything well, and treat it as needed, until it is perfectly healed.
About nodes
There are many types of nodes, of which I will describe all appearances; and now I must tell all the difference between node and discharge.
I say that discharge has heat and persistent fever, until the inflammation has passed, and the suppuration is complete; then the fever and heat subside.
With the node there is neither heat nor fever nor pain, and it contains a membrane, which is its proper sac and is the color of the body, and begins like a pea, and becomes large; and they are of two types, either fatty or moist, and many colors exist as I have said in the classification.
It is necessary, when you come to treat the node, that you test and examine it first with the instrument called "probe," according to the form that will come in the chapter that follows.
And the manner of examining node abscesses is that you take the most moist place that you find in the abscess, and turn your fingers little by little, until you know that the instrument has pierced the core, then let it be according to the size of the abscess; then withdraw the probe, and pay attention to what comes out.
If flowing moisture flows out, whatever color it has, cut it as I have said about other abscesses; and if after the probe no moisture comes, know that it is fatty, so cut it in a cross shape, and take it with pincers, and carefully skin it from each side and preserve the covering in which it lies so that you remove it intact with the node; and if you cannot remove it intact, then remove it in pieces so that nothing remains.
For if anything remains, the node returns many times; and if a little remains, and the blood troubles you, then fill the wound with some sharp corrosive powders, and tighten the wound, and put on things that calm hot abscesses, and treat it with other treatments until it is healed; and if the node is large, then sew the two lips of the wound, and treat it with that which generates flesh.
And if the beating vein opposes you or another then hurry and fill the place with ground vitriol, and leave it bound for two or three days, until the wound suppurates, and the blood's ebullition subsides; then return to cutting what remained of the node.
Here are the forms of probe instruments, and they are of three types: large and medium and small; and there are three square ones which are called "albaret," and one which is called "breb," and there are three types: large, medium, and small, for examining fistula abscesses; and they are like the needles with which one sews eyebrows, and they are of yellow brass, or iron, or silver, and those that are yellow are worth more, and black lead ones are more tested for examining the curves of fistulas; and they are of three types: large, medium, and small, according to the quantity of the width of the holes.
The shapes of hooks are of many kinds, as you see here: large, medium, and small; and there are hooks that have 2 curves of 3 types also; and there are hooks that have 3 curves, and are also of 3 types; and there are hooks that have 2 curves, and hooks with only one curve, and they are of 3 types; and all of these are necessary in their place.
The heads of these with which one cuts are sharp, and some of them only cut on one side, with which one scrapes the nodes, so as not to cut the vein or nerve; and of these implements the blades are hidden in handles, so that the patients do not notice them when opening abscesses; and they are of 3 types: large, small, and medium, as you see; and they are only used in fleshy places, such as legs, and arms, and breasts, and in corners, and in similar places; and sometimes one makes another small instrument, similar to pistachio shells, according to this form, with which one stanches blood:
and sometimes one puts it in the place that bleeds from cutting of veins, and arteries, and sometimes round according to this large form:
Sometimes the breasts of some men swell when they begin to be corrupted, so much that they resemble women's breasts; and they remain ugly and swollen, and if one wants to cure them, it is necessary to cut according to this form from this line .b. to .g.:
then scrape away the fat, and fill the wound with flesh-generating medicine, then join the two lips of the wound with sutures, and treat it until it is healed; and if the breast hangs down, and is softened by its size as happens to women, cut it on two sides above, with two similar incisions; of which one should be connected to the other at the end of one and the other, so that the larger line contains the smaller according to this form, from this line .b. to line .g.; then scrape the skin that is between the two lips, and remove the fat, and administer what we have said about sutures and powders, and what is necessary in the treatment, until it is healed; and if it is not healed, or the incision is not completely made, because the patient does not want to rest, or because of blood flow, it is necessary that you fill the wound with cotton soaked in corrosive ointment; and leave it until it eats away the remainder and the fat, then treat it until it is healed.
about armpit abscesses
These abscesses that come under the armpits are types of hard scrofulas where there are coverings, and there are some that contain moisture.
Those therefore that contain moisture should be cut according to this form, from line .b. to line .g.:
And when all the pus that is in the abscess is emptied, fill the wound with old cotton, and leave it until the next day, then remove all the cotton, and treat with suitable ointment until it is healed.
And if the abscess is of the type of scrofulas, cut it as we have said in cutting of scrofulas, and if the wound produces pus, apply cautery as we have said before.
Title: "Of the rupture of the artery"
"When the artery is broken, and the skin above it is healed, it often results in abscesses, and the same happens with swollen veins and abscesses; and one recognizes it thus when it's from the artery, the abscess is long and deep; and when you feel it with your fingers, you feel a constriction; and when it's from the vein, it is round and visible from outside; and it is foolish to cut this abscess, especially when it is under the armpits and in the corners and on the neck and in many other places, and is very large."
"It is therefore necessary to avoid treatment with iron, and that which is at the head must also be avoided, and in that which is from swelling of the artery, cut lengthwise above the skin; then open the cut with hooks, and gently separate the artery from the membranes, until it is exposed; then push a needle underneath it, and make it pierce through to the other side, and tighten the artery with a double thread in two places, according to what I have taught you in the extraction of the two arteries which are in the temples; then pierce the place between the two ties with a probe until the blood that is there comes out, and the abscess is relieved; then administer the treatment that generates pus, until the ties fall off; then treat it with suitable ointment until it is healed; and if the abscess is from the cut of the vein, you must hold in your hand what you can of the abscess with all the skin, then push the needle under the place that you hold in your hand, and make it pierce through, and have a double thread, so that you pull it from the other side; then tie the abscess, as I told you, with the tie of one of two parts at the two ends of the thread; and if you fear that the threads might come out, push another needle with a thread under all the abscess at the incision of the first needle, and tighten the threads in four places; then cut the abscess so that the excess comes out, then cut the excess of the skin and leave what is tied; then put on it a cloth moistened in wine and oil, then administer treatments of tents and ointments until it is healed."
Title: "Of the abscesses of the nerves"
"Just as abscesses come in the artery and in the vein, abscesses come to the nerves when they are struck, or through too much work, and similar things."
"And this happens more often to the upper arms and fingers and in all places where there are joints, and it is a serious abscess, and its color resembles the color of the body, and is in several conditions without pain; and when one presses it firmly, the patient feels pain, and it is not deep in the body, but under the skin; and it moves well from all sides, and goes neither forward nor backward, nor below nor above, and that which is in joints must not be cut by iron: by chance contraction would come; and that which is on the head or on the forehead, cut the skin with the spatula."
"If the abscess is small, hold it with pincers, and cut it at its root; and if it is large, suspend it with the hook, and flay it, then remove it and join the wound with suture, and treat it until it is healed."
of hanging large lumps
Sometimes thelul occurs in bellies and nowhere else, and it is a disease called "fungus" due to its resemblance to them, and its root is thin, and the head large; and there are small and very large ones; and I saw a man who had two in his belly that resembled fungi more than anything else, and there was no difference, and they were white, and had thin roots, and were already split, and moisture constantly ran from them.
I cut them and found in one eighteen ounces by weight, and in the other six ounces, and the procedure for the incision is that you observe if the patient is moist, and the color of the thelul is white and moist and has a thin root; then cut it with a wide spatula, and have the cautery irons in the fire ready in your presence.
For when cutting there often comes too great a flow of blood, and if the blood overcomes you, then hasten to cauterize; and if you see the patient frightened and fearful of the iron's incision, take a well-made lead thread, and tie the thelul as we have said, and leave it for two days; and then tighten it, and do not cease tightening the lead thread until it cuts the thelul, and it falls by itself without effort; and if the roots are thick, there is fear in cutting especially because of the belly, but you can well cut half of it, then cauterize it so it doesn't return; then treat the wound, and be careful not to cut the thelul which is dark in color and of poor sense and ugly appearance.
For this is a cancerous aposteme, and I will come to the treatment of cancer hereafter.
when the bowel comes out
If the appearance of the bowel comes through cautery of a wound or splitting of the syfac, and is on the belly and some of the bowels come out, as happens in other ruptures, or from blood that runs from veins or arteries according to what is before, or from windiness; and if it is through the rupture of the syfac and through the exit of the bowel, then the color of the aposteme resembles the color of the body, and is an easy thing without pain, and appears from diverse exit.
And if it is due to the exit of the intestine, then it is more diverse, and when one presses it with one's fingers it hides itself, and then returns, and by chance it is compressed, and grows much upon entering the bath and through strong work.
And if it is due to moisture, it is an easy thing, and appears well when you press it with your hand, and does not constrict; and if it is due to blood, the aposteme appears by these signs large and hard, and is fixed according to a quantity; and if it is due to windiness, it is soft to touch, and the procedure is that you observe if the appearance is due to blood from the artery, or from the vein, or windiness.
Then you must abandon the treatment.
For there is doubt and fear about it, as I told you in the chapter on apostemes, because of the artery and the vein.
And if the appearance is for the intestine or the bowel, you should command the patient to hold their breath, and be stretched out straight, then mark with ink all around the bulge; then command them to lie supine between your hands, then go around the place that you have marked with the spatula, then stretch half of the abscess above with the large hook; then tie it around with a strong thread, or with a cord of strong silk firmly, and let the knot of the binding be loose; then open half of the abscess stretched above the binding, and put your index finger in it, and search for the intestine; if you find it caught in the binding, untie it, and push the intestine to the outside of the belly; and if you find the bowel, take it with the hook, and cut off the excess; and if the artery gives you trouble, or the vein, go gently around it, then return to your work and take 2 needles, and put in 2 strong threads, and put the 2 needles around what you have made in a cross that you made pierce; then tighten the abscess in 4 places above the needles, and if you wish, remove the needles, and leave the place until it rots, and the dead flesh falls off by itself; or you cut it when it has become thin and rotten, then treat it with what is necessary, and dig out the abscess as we have said; and draw out the blood or moisture that you find, then treat the place with what is necessary, and seal the place.
About cancer
We have spoken in the division about the appearances of cancer, and how one should work with medicines, and how one should avoid treatment with iron; and we speak of cancer engendered in the womb, and great caution is needed in the treatment, and the ancients said that when cancer is in a place where one can scrape it as cancer that is in breasts, and in the thigh, and in similar places, one should remove it all when it is in the beginning; and when it is large and old, you should not approach it, for I could never heal any; nor did anyone heal any before me.
And the procedure, when it is in a place where one can remove it, as we have said, is that you purge sometimes the patient of black bile; then make them bleed if they have manifest repletion, then prepare the patient a good place to do the procedure; then throw your hooks in the cancer, and dig it out from all sides, and remove it from all sides without leaving anything; and let all the blood run out, and squeeze the place well with your hand or with something, and if the running of blood gives you trouble from the incision of the artery or the vein, then cauterize it until the blood is stanched; then treat it with other treatment until it is healed.
About dropsy
We have already spoken in the division about the appearances of dropsy, and in what manner the gathering of water is made, and the signs of each appearance, and the treatment that is made by medicines, and that which is treated by iron: it is only ascites; and one should not touch with iron in these 2 appearances: that is to say, tympanites and hyposarca, for it is a deadly thing; therefore when you treat this appearance of dropsy which is called "ascites" with medicines, and the treatment does not profit, then look if the patient is weak, or if they have another illness than dropsy, such as cough and looseness of belly and similar things; then do not touch with iron, for there is doubt; and if you see the patient of strong virtue, and they have no other illness than dropsy only, and they are not too young nor too old, then you should work thus: raise the patient straight up with your hands, and let the assistants press the belly pushing the water to the lowest part of the chest, then take the spiny spatula according to this form:
And let it be sharp on both sides.
With a point, and yet not so penetrating that it might reach the intestine when inserted, and cannot wound it; then see if the dropsy is generated near the intestines: in which case you must make an incision three fingers away from the navel straight below towards the groin; and if the dropsy is due to liver disease, make your incision three fingers to the left of the navel; and if it's due to the spleen, let it be on the right, and the patient should not lie on the incision so that the excess fluids do not run to this weak spot; then pierce all the skin with the instrument, and push it in, and lift your hand with the spatula between the skin and the peritoneum as if skinning to the length of a fingernail or thereabouts; then pierce the peritoneum until the spatula reaches the empty space, which is where the water is, then pull it out, and insert this instrument of which here is the form:
And it resembles a thin silver tube, and is made of brass or light silver, and has at the bottom part a small hole; and on one side, three holes; and two on another side, and one on another; and the head is cut like a quill pen, and this is the form of the incision that the scribe makes to cut the pen:
At the upper end is the blade, so that when the instrument reaches the water, it immediately descends onto the instrument; then empty half or a third part, for if you empty more than is necessary at that time, perhaps the patient might die from the dissolution of his spirit of the soul, or he might faint, or approach death; but empty according to the quantity of his strength, and according to what the conditions of the patient's strength indicate, and his pulse; then withdraw the instrument and retain the water, and it is immediately retained by the flesh that blocks the hole that is above the peritoneum, of which I have spoken, that you pierce in this manner; then reinsert the instrument the next day, if you see the patient bearing this, and draw out a small quantity of water; do this for some days, and be careful not to err until there remains only a little water.
And if you have doubts about the patient, and you leave much water, then treat him with burial in hot sand, and by much sweating in the bath and in the sun, and let him abstain from drinking; and treat him with drying medicines until he is healed, and cauterize over the stomach and over the liver and over the spleen after the extraction of the water, as I have said before.
On the blockage of the penis
Sometimes children are born who have no hole in the penis, or the hole is small, or it is not in its proper place.
So it must be pierced as soon as it is born with a very fine spatula according to this form:
Then put in the hole a thin lead nail, and tie it and keep it thus for three or four days and when he needs to urinate, remove the nail, and let him urinate, and then put it back; and perhaps none is needed, for the urine that comes out will not let it close.
Those whose hole is small are treated with the lead nail, as we have said, so it will enlarge.
Those who do not have the hole in its place are injured, for some are born who have the hole at the head of the penis, because of which they cannot urinate forward unless they lift their penis up; and they cannot procreate because the material cannot reach the womb, and this is a bad disease.
And the manner of the operation is that the patient lies supine on his back, then extend the head of the penis and cut it like the cut of a quill pen, so that the hole falls in the middle, as it should be; and beware of blood flow which often comes, and if it happens, then stanch it with that which stanches blood, and treat the wound until he is healed.
Title: On pustules of the penis
Many times these albathes (pustules) come on the penis, and it is an appearance of ugly flesh; and there are malignant and non-malignant ones; thus it is necessary that you take them with a fine hook, and cut and clean them all, then put cotton soaked in Egyptian ointment on it; then treat it with diafinicon ointment until it is healed.
And if the albathe is malignant, of foul color and stinking, it is necessary that you apply cautery.
When you have cut it, and if the albathe is on the tip of the penis, and has part inside the skin and part outside, it is necessary that you remove the albathe that is inside first; and when it is healed, then treat the outside.
For when you treat them together, the head of the penis is not secured from being pierced, and blackness and corruption come to the tip of the penis and to the testicle; thus it is necessary to remove all that is black and corrupted, then bind on it a plaster of honey and flour that is made of pomegranate peel and vetches, then treat it with other treatments until it is healed.
And if bleeding occurs, then administer the lunar cautery according to this form:
The cautery thus helps with two conditions together: that is to say, the bleeding, and the corruption; and if the head of the penis is corrupted and withdrawn, it is necessary that you insert into the urethral canal a lead tube, and the patient urinates through it; and when the skin is stuck to the head of the penis which happens to those who have not been circumcised, or it happens because of a wound or an abscess, it is thus necessary that you separate it with a hollowed instrument, until the binding is undone, and the head of the penis is freed on all sides; and if this is difficult to separate, it is necessary that you separate with a spatula some of the head of the penis and the skin; then gently separate between the two, and put there a fine linen cloth soaked in cold water, so that it doesn't stick again.
On circumcision
Circumcision is not a separation of continuity like other wounds; however when we do this work of our own will, and properly on children, it is necessary that we do the best work, and the easiest for health.
I say that the ancients did not speak of the circumcision of their children, for they do not use it in their law, and we have only what we have acquired through experiment.
For I have seen the greater part of the masters and elders who performed circumcision around with a thimble, and with scissors, and with a razor; so the heart fled for there are two membranes, and by chance one cuts the upper one and the lower one remains.
Now it must be cut again, and the pain is double, and with the cleaning that is done with the thimble the point of the member is not secured; and with the cleaning of the nail perhaps the iron escapes, and corrupts the work, and many times they are born such that they have no need of cleaning and I have seen it.
Of the cleaning that is done with scissors with all the binding of thread I have found the goodness of experiment, for the scissors cut justly as well above as below.
For when you press your hand, cut evenly in one single motion; but make sure the thread is very tight around the skin; and the manner of the first operation is that you make the child think, if he understands, that you are doing nothing but tying the thread around the penis only, and then make him rejoice in all the ways that you can; then make him stand straight between your hands, and hide the scissors between your hands or under your feet so that the child does not see them, nor any of the instruments; then push your hand to the penis and blow on the foreskin, and pull it up until the head of the penis is inside; then clean it well of the dirt that has gathered there, then tie the marked place with a double thread, then tie it a little below with another tie; and hold it with two fingers by the second tie with the thumb and index finger, and cut between the two ties, then quickly lift the foreskin above and pull the head of the penis; then let the blood run little by little, for that is best; and put powder on it and on the powder put a cloth glued with an egg yolk cooked in rose water, mixed with good fresh rose oil, and leave it on until the next day, and treat it with other treatment until it heals.
The form of the scissors for the cleaning is this: the two ends should be thin and sharp, and the ends should be as large as the handles equally:
The error of cleaning is when the inner foreskin flees at the incision; then you must stretch it with your nail, before the place forms an abscess; and cut it evenly, and if you cannot hold it with your nail, hold it with tongs, and then cut it.
And if three days pass, and what is below the penis is swollen, leave it until the hot abscess has calmed, and skin it lightly; cut it as best you can, and be careful of the part of the penis, it will not harm it at all.
Therefore treat the place with things that heal wounds with powder, which we have mentioned in the treatise on powders, and if one cuts the foreskin beyond measure, and it goes above, it will not harm; treat it therefore, as we have said, until it heals.
On the retention of urine
The retention of urine is from blockage by stone, or by congealed blood, or by pus, or by grown flesh, or by similar things, which we have mentioned in the division; and if the urine is not released, and you see the retention is because of the stone that is already in the neck of the bladder, it is necessary that the patient be bent over his knees; and his feet should be put on his back, and stretch his belly from the part above the back, and the patient should hold his breath as long as he can; and then the neck of the bladder is constrained to expel the stone upward, whereby the urine is released; and if it does not come, as we have said, and the patient feels great pain, it is necessary that you administer extraction with the instrument that is called "syringe", of which here is the form: and it should be of subtle light silver, hollow like a bird's feather; and the shaft should be a palm and a half long, and be subtle at the end.
And the manner of the release of urine is that you take a double thread, and tie at the end a little wool or cotton, and push the end of the thread inside the syringe; and cut the excess of the wool and push it to the end of the syringe, then anoint the syringe with oil or butter and egg white, and make the patient sit on a seat, and moisten his bladder and penis with moist oil and olive oil and warm water; then gently put the syringe in the penis, until it comes to the root of the penis, then double the penis above toward the navel; then push the syringe forward until the bladder, and let the patient feel it come to the empty thing, and this is not done according to this order except because the channel where it goes is twisted; then extend the thread with the wool little by little, and the urine follows the wool, then pull it out, and let the urine flow; and restart the syringe until the bladder is empty, and the patient is relieved.
On diseases of the bladder
When there are abrasions or blood in the bladder, or pus has collected there, and you want to distill waters and medicines into it, do so with the instrument called "clepsydra," and this is its form:
It is closed, and has 3 holes: 2 on one side, and 1 on the other, as you can see; and the hollow place through which the medicine flows should be such that it blocks the penis well without addition, so that one can draw out the moisture and push when needed; and when you want to inject your medicines into the bladder, put the head of the container in the moisture, and pull on the plunger that is inside; you will draw the moisture into the container, and then push the plunger back in forcefully; the moisture will enter and will come to the bladder immediately, so that the patient will feel it; and this is the form of the subtle clyster with which one administers an enema to the bladder: it is here:
And it is made of silver or brass, and the head is higher; and below there is a notch where the binding falls; then take a sheep's bladder and put in it the moisture with which you want to give an enema to the bladder, then tie it strongly between the two notches with a good double thread, and heat this moisture a little over the fire; then push the head of the clyster into the penis, then press your hand on the bladder with all the moisture appropriately, until the patient feels that this moisture has already reached the bladder; and if you don't have the bladder, take a piece of parchment, and make a circle of it, and pierce it round about; then put a strong thread in these holes, then assemble the circle as one assembles a thimble, and put inside what you want of oil and moisture and water, and tie it to the instrument; and do as you did with the bladder, pressing with your hand until the moisture comes to the bladder.
On the stone
We have already spoken in the division about the types of stone, and extraction together with medicines; and I have spoken of the difference between stone generated in the kidneys, and all the signs, and in which stone one must operate by cutting; and in the bladder, and in the penis; and I will tell you openly and briefly.
I say that the stone which is generated in the bladder happens more often to children, and this is a sign that the water jumps from the bladder resembling water in its subtlety; and sand appears, and the patient scratches his penis, and it hangs many times, and then becomes rigid; and in many of these the fundament protrudes; and the healing is easy in children until they are 4 years old, and is very difficult in old men, and is moderate in young men, in those who are between youth and old age; and the cure is easier for those who have large stones than for those who have small ones.
And when we come to the cure, it is necessary first to cleanse the patient by clyster, to draw out all the waste that is in the intestines.
For it sometimes hinders the search for the stone.
Then take the patient by the feet, and push him and move him downward, so that the stone descends to the bottom of the bladder, and sometimes jumps from the high place; then make him sit prepared between your hands, and his hands should be under his thighs, so that the bladder is all declining downward; then search for it and touch inside; if you feel the stone in the space, then hasten immediately to cut upon the stone.
And if it does not fall completely to the touch, then wet your index finger with oil of your left hand, if the patient is a child, or your middle finger, if the patient is a complete youth; and push it into his fundament, and search for the stone, and when you feel it with your finger, bring it to the neck of the bladder; then press upon it with your finger, and push it outward there where you want to cut.
And command the assistant to press the bladder with his hand, and command him to extend with his right hand the testicles upward, and with his left hand remove the skin that is below the testicles in the part where one makes the cut; then push in the cutting spatula, of which this is the form:
And he cuts between what is between the testicles and the fundament, not in the middle but on the left side of the buttock; and it should be straight above the stone, and your finger should always be in the fundament, and the cut should be crosswise so that it is wide on the outside, and narrow inside, according to the size of the stone, not too large; perhaps the pressure of the finger that is in the fundament will make it jump out without effort; and know that there are stones that have angles and margins: these are difficult to remove; and there are those that are smooth, similar to an acorn, and round, whose removal is easy.
For those that have angles and margins, make the cut larger; and if it doesn't jump out, you must grip it with forceps that are like a file at the tip, to better grip the stone so it doesn't escape; or push underneath it a subtle instrument curved at the tip; and if you cannot manage it thus, enlarge the opening a little, and if blood flows, compress it with vitriol; and if there is more than one stone, push the largest one first to the neck of the bladder, then cut above it, then pull it out, and the small ones after if there are several.
And if it is very large, it must be sawed, and make a larger wound.
For two things happen to the patient: either he dies, or the urine always comes through there because the place cannot heal; but still strive to extract it, or to break it with forceps, until you extract it in pieces; and when you have completed your work, fill the wound with incense and aloe and dragon's blood, and compress it, and put above it a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or in oil and rose water and cold water, to calm the hot aposteme; then lay the patient back on his neck, and do not untie the bandage until the third day.
And when you untie it, water the area well with oil and water, then treat it with dyafinicon ointment and basilicon ointment, until it is healed.
And if hot apostemes come in the wound and corrosions, and blood clotting in the bladder, and through this the urine is retained, which is known in such a way that blood comes out with the urine: then put your finger in the wound, and extract this blood, for if it remains there, it will corrupt the bladder, and rot it; then wash the wound with water and vinegar and salt, and help it in all the ways that you know, until it is healed; and it is necessary that every time you treat it, you bind his two thighs, and gather the medicines on the spot.
And if the stone is small, and it is in the conduit of the rod [penis], and stuck inside, and the urine cannot come out; treat it with what I said before, that you cut it many times, one is excused from the cut by this treatment.
I have already proven this thus.
Take an iron drill according to this form and let it be with three angles fixed in a handle:
then take a thread and tie it around the rod below the stone, so that it cannot go back into the bladder; then push the drill into the rod gently, until it comes to the stone; and turn the drill with your hand in the stone little by little, until you can pierce the stone from the other side; the urine will come immediately, then press your hand on what remains of the stone that is inside the rod.
It is immediately broken, and jumps out with the urine, and the patient is healed; and if you cannot do this because of something that prevents it, tie a thread below the stone and another above, then split the rod right at the stone between the two ties, then extract it out, and untie the tie, and clean the clotted blood that is in the wound; and treat it until it is healed.
On women's stones (bladder stones)
It rarely happens that stones are formed in women, and if it happens sometimes, the cure is difficult, and is forbidden for three things: one is that perhaps the woman is a virgin; and the second is that one cannot find a knowledgeable woman who will reveal herself to physicians, especially when she is chaste.
And the third manner is that perhaps one cannot find a woman well-versed in this manual art; and the fourth manner is that the stone in the woman is deeper than the stone in the man, therefore it requires making a deeper cut, and there is great fear. And if necessity compels this, you must take a well-knowing female physician, and she is hardly found, and if you don't find one, then seek a chaste clever physician; and present to him a midwife well-versed in women's lives, or a woman who knows part of the art, and command her to do what you command regarding the investigation of the stone; and look very carefully if the woman is a virgin: then she must insert her finger in the fundament and search for the stone; and if she finds it, she should constrain it under her finger, and recommend that she insert her finger in the patient's vagina, and search and press her left hand firmly on the bladder.
If she finds it, she must move it gradually from the entrance of the bladder downward, until it comes to the root of the thigh; then cut above the stone at the root of the thigh against the middle of the vagina, there where it is most apparent, and feel the stone in that part; and do not move her finger above or below the stone, and let the cut be small at first; then insert the probe in the cut, if you feel the stone then increase the wound until the stone can come out, and know that there are many kinds of stones: that is to say, small and large and rough and smooth, long and round, and which have branches.
Thus know their appearances to know the outcome.
And if blood overcomes you, put ground vitriol on the place, and hold it for an hour until the blood is stanched; then return to your work, until the stone is out, and have the instruments that I told you about in the extraction of stones in men to help you in your work; and if blood overcomes you, and it's from the artery that is cut, then put the powder on the place and pack it with tents and bandages, and do not start this again, and leave the stone and do not draw it out, for perhaps the patient would die; then treat the wound.
And when the heat of the blood is calmed, and the place suppurates, then return to your work, until the stone is out.
On fleshy hernia
Watery hernia is nothing other than a collection of moisture in the white syphac, which is below the covering of the testicles, which contains the egg; and it is called "syphac," and sometimes it is properly in the membrane of the egg, so that one thinks it is another egg; and this is the skin of the testicle between the white syphac that we have mentioned; and this happens only rarely.
And the generation of this hernia is from weakness that comes to the testicles, and this matter is spread out.
And sometimes it comes from a blow to the testicles, and this moisture has many colors: either it is a color declining to yellow, or it is red blood, or black, or watery white, and this happens more often; and these are the signs to recognize this collection, for if it is in the white syphac that we have mentioned, then the swelling is round, a little long like the shape of an egg, and the testicle does not appear, for it has moisture all around.
And if there is moisture in the proper membrane, then the swelling is round with a part of the egg, and because of this one thinks that it is another egg; and if the moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the white syphac, then one feels it well; therefore when you want to know the color of the moisture, test it with the square probe, whose form is shown before this.
Therefore judge what is inside according to what comes after the probe.
And when we treat it with iron, it is necessary that the patient be bled according to his strength and the fullness of his body; then lay him on his back, on something slightly elevated, and put many cloths beneath him; then sit on his left side, and command the assistant to sit on the right, and extend the rod to one of the two sides of the heart of the testicles; then take the broad spatula, and cut the skin of the testicles in the middle lengthwise up to near the groin, and let your incision be completely straight while separating the skin of the testicles until the white membrane, and peel it carefully according to your ability; then pierce the membrane full of water with a wide hole, and draw out all the water, and then put your hooks, and extend the membrane upward; and do not touch the heart of the testicles, but only the membrane; cut all or in pieces especially its subtle side, for if you do not cut it wisely, the water will return; and if the egg comes out during your work, return it to its place when you have completed the work on the membrane; then join the two lips of the heart of the testicles with a suture, then treat it like other wounds, until it is healed.
And if you find the egg corrupted by another illness, it is necessary that you tie the vessels that are suspensory, fearing the flow of blood; then cut the testicle with all the suspensory, and extract the egg, and treat it as we have said.
And if water is gathered in two parts together, know that these are two hernias; so cut the other part as you did the first equally, then dry the blood, and put in the wound wool soaked in rose oil; and put outside other wool soaked in wine and oil, and put it on the two testicles, and put doubled cloths above, and tie it up with the bandage that is according to this form:
Then take two cloths, and fill them with carded wool according to this appearance and let them be joined by sewing in the throat of the breeches, and one of the ends should reach from the fundament to the back, and the other to the part of the groin; and the other two ends on the two angles, and let all the constraint be assembled in the buckle of the truss; and sometimes this hernia is treated with cautery instead of cutting with iron, and it is that you take a subtle knife-like cautery, and cut the skin of the testicles, and let it be heated as we have said, so that the white membrane that contains the water is uncovered; so take the cautery according to this form, and pierce that membrane with the hooks, and peel it with this subtle hot cautery:
And cut it in all the ways that you can, until you extract everything; and ensure that the fire does not touch the egg; and know that this work is safer; and better guarding against blood flow, and better than the work of cutting; and if anything opposes you, whether hot abscess or blood flow or something else, so treat what opposes you, according to what was said before.
And if the patient is fearful, and does not want to endure this work for its horribleness, so administer perforation, as I tell you, and it is that when you are quite certain by the signs that we have mentioned that it is a watery hernia there, so make the patient sit on a raised seat; then pierce the abscess in the lower part with the broad spatula, and make the perforation lengthwise of the body; and let the hole be wide, so that all the water runs out; then put cotton on the place, and bind it, and leave for the remainder of the water to run, then treat it until the wound is healed; and if the white cloth does not let the water out at the mouth of the wound, it is necessary that you push in a quill or the instrument with which one draws the water from dropsy patients, of which the form is shown before; and widen the wound a little, and know that the water returns, and is gathered after six months or thereabouts, and when it is gathered as before, and thus will the patient pass his days.
of the abscess of the testicles
Know that in the cutting of this hernia there is fear in several conditions, which is why it seems to me better to leave it; and I will tell you the procedure and the appearances of the abscess.
I say therefore that many abscesses come to the body, and especially to the testicles; and this happens due to many cases.
That is to say by sour and sharp superfluity, which is spread to the testicles, or from percussion; and the color of the abscess is according to the color of the body; and finds no pain, and is a serious abscess; and perchance it is a serious, fearsome and purulent abscess, of dark color, and sometimes comes from an arterial knot, or from swelling of a vein.
When it is from an arterial knot, it is known by the disposition of hot abscess, when you press it with your fingers; and you should not touch it.
That which is made from swelling of a vein is known by its disposition upon pressing with the fingers, and one can well make the cut on this appearance, and on the other flesh; and it is that you cut the heart of the testicles, then extend the egg upward, and pull it out of the white membrane, and free the suspensory from all parts of the egg.
If the egg is already soldered with these born flesh, then you must pull the egg, and cut it; and if it adheres to the membrane, or in that which is within the vessels, then you must free all that thin part, and cut it roundly.
And if the birth of the flesh is in the back place, then you must cut it all, and extract the egg, as we have said.
And when your work is accomplished, fill the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and wine, then treat it with other treatments until it is healed.
of the abscess of the testicles
This is an abscess wrapped in a wrapping similar to a bud, with the softening of the testicles, and the patient moves with difficulty when he walks; and the cure of this disease is nearly as fearsome as the one before, and nevertheless we will tell you the procedure for it, according to what the ancients did.
It is necessary that you make the patient sit on a raised seat, then push down the suspensory of the testicles with your fingers, with all the vessels that are close to the rod, and the master should hold them, and extend them strongly; then cut with the wide cutting spatula across near the vessels, until they are uncovered, and then skin from each part, as we have said in the extraction of arteries that are in temples; then stick a needle there with a double thread, and tie it at the first place where the living tissue has come, and tie it again at the other end; then cut them in the middle straight, according to the length of the body, and draw out the corrupted moisture; then treat the wound as others where pus is generated, so that some vessels fall that nourish one of the testicles; for by this no harm comes, and if to all the vessels comes living tissue, then it is necessary to draw the testicles with all the vessels; so that the egg does not lose its nourishment through the incision of the vessels, and they dry up and cannot help themselves.
