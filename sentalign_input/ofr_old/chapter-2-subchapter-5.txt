About the rheum of the eyes
When someone frequently has acute catarrh, and you see the eyes thin and small, and the vision weakening, and the eyelids burnt; and the hairs fall out, and there is deep acute pain in the head, and the patient sneezes; then know by these symptoms that these materials and this catarrh come only from many veins, and the best treatment for this is as follows.
And it is that you command the patient to pull back his forehead, then make a large incision in the middle of the forehead, and another one crosswise. And start from the incision of the left temple to the right temple, and let the incision be to the bone; and keep your hand away from the nerves of the temples that move to the jaw; and when the bone is uncovered, wipe all the blood with a sponge, and then separate between the two lips of the incision and place old cotton and linen tents; then bind above with cloths soaked in wine and oil, and guard against hot abscess; when it is removed, you must rub the bone until flesh starts to grow there, then treat it with drying substances that make flesh grow.
In this manner: take two parts of wheat flower and four parts of colophony, and make a plaster; and apply it to these wounds to grow flesh everywhere.
