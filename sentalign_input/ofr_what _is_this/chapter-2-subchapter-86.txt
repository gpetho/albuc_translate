of a fistula wherever it may be
Know that any wound or abscess, when it festers, is universally called a "fistula," and especially when it becomes hollow and forms a cavity.
And a fistula, according to the truth, is a faulty, hard, and white node, where one feels no pain, and is as hollow as a bird's feather; and sometimes clear fluid comes out of it, and sometimes thick; sometimes little, and sometimes a lot; and I have already spoken of it in the division of wounds, that any wound that is not healed, and where there is no flesh, is only due to one of nine causes: that is to say, due to the lack of blood or body; or because of its malignancy; or because there is hard flesh inside, and on the edges, which prevents flesh from growing; or there is too much fluid; or the place is rotten, and the matter is of poor quality; or the medicine is not good for the cure; or because the corruption is a kind of pestilence; or because of the property of the region, the digestion is slow, and the healing is slow, and swells naturally; or there are veins or bones: and I have already shown all these causes, and the signs, and the cures of medicines in the division.
Now I must inform you about the treatment of a fistula that is made by manual work.
Know that fistulas occur in all parts of the body; for there are fistulas that come to the large veins, and to the arteries, and to the nerves, or to the peritoneum, or to the intestine, or to the bladder, or to some of the ribs, or to the spine of the back, or to any joint of the hands or feet; and there are some that occur within the principal member itself, and in similar places.
And all fistulas of this kind are difficult to heal, and there is nothing but work and ignorance; and if there is a fistula that does not reach the place I mentioned, and you have confidence in the cure, and you want to examine it, take a probe of brass or iron, if the fistula is straight, then probe it; and if the fistula is crooked, then search it with a thin lead probe, because lead bends easily around the crookedness; and if the fistula has many openings and you cannot probe it well, then inject it through one of the openings, for the moisture will flow from one opening to another, and cleanse it; then examine it carefully as best you can, so that you know if there is bone or nerve, and if it is hollow and deep, and ask the patient carefully about the pain he feels when you press with your hand, and where he feels it; and when you truly know where it is, and whether it is far from a joint, or a nerve, or an artery or vein, or in any of the places I have mentioned, cut it as I have told you, and remove the infected matter and the corrupted flesh that are inside; and then treat it until it is healed, and if the fistula is very deep in a straight line, you must cut deeply, as much as you can, then put in tents soaked in a sharp medicine, and push them to the head of the fistula, so that the medicine corrodes the excess that remains at the bottom; and then put in ointments that generate healthy flesh, until it is healed; and if it is not healed by this, then cauterize it as we have said, and if the bone is corrupted by the fistula, cut it.
If a vein or nerve does not hinder you in the principal members, as we have said; and if the bone is exposed, and there is corruption and blackness, scrape it until all the corruption is removed, then treat it with things that generate flesh until it is healed; and if it is not healed, and releases fluid as before, know that you have not gone deep enough: so uncover and search until you are at the bottom, and remove all the corruption, then restore the area; and if it is thus healed, that is good.
If not, know that the corruption is too deep, that you cannot reach it; so there is no other solution than to leave it to nature; and if there is a small corrupted bone, and you can pull it with forceps, extract it with a suitable instrument, and if there are many bones, pull them all out, do not leave a single one; and if the moisture hinders you, and there is no error or fear, cut both the moisture and the flesh, and free the bones.
And if you cannot remove them at once, put something on the wound that generates decay, and leave it until the area around the bones is decayed, and then the bones will be easier to remove; and if it is a large bone, such as from the leg or thigh, just scrape the corruption until all the blackness is removed, then restore the wound; and if a large part of it is corrupted, and it reaches the marrow of the bone, it must be scraped and cut all the way to the corruption, and then treated until it is joined; and I will tell you about a fistula that happened to a man in his leg, so that you may take example and help in your work. 
There was a young man of about thirty years, who had a pain in his leg from a cause that came from within the body, so much so that the matter went to the leg, and it was swollen with a large abscess, and there was no need to open it with fire; but the physicians, in their folly, worked on it so much that the abscess opened, and much matter flowed from it, and it became a fistula, and many openings appeared, all of which discharged fluid and moisture from the body; and many physicians treated it for about two years, and there was no one wise in the art among them, until I was called, and I saw his leg and the medicines with which he was being treated, and what flowed from the openings in large quantity; and the young man's body became red, and had a yellowish color.
I placed a tent in one of these openings, and then examined all the openings, and found that they all connected with each other from all parts of the leg.
I hurried then, and cut into one of the openings until I uncovered a part of the bone, and found it corrupted and perforated, and the corruption went down to the bone inside; I scraped what appeared to me of the corrupted bone, and thought that there was no other corruption, except what I removed; and I began to restore the wound with healing medicines for a long time, and it could not heal; and then I started again, and uncovered the bone as before, and found the corruption continuing in the bone, and I scraped it, and then removed it, and tried to heal the place; but I could not until I cut around a handbreadth of the bone, and pulled it out with all its marrow, then restored it with medicines; and it was healed and joined quickly, and there was no need to restart the work except for the weakness of the patient, who could not endure it, and for the fear of death that I had for him.
For because of the bloodletting he often sobbed, but he was completely healed, and hard flesh grew in place of the bone, and it was of good quality and had no harm or adverse effects at all, neither coming nor going.
And if the bone is broken in any part of the body, it should be scraped in this manner: take a linen cloth, and tighten it at the end of the bone that appears, and order someone to pull it upwards; and put another woolen cloth, thicker than the first cloth, and tie it over the flesh that is above the bone, and stretch the end, so that you pull the corrupted flesh below, and uncover the flesh over the place where you want to scrape, so that the scraping does not injure the flesh; and put a firebrand or a board under the bone to better cut the corrupted flesh; and it is necessary to scrape as much as one can see and feel the corruption, and scrape again another time.
And if the bone is corrupted, and does not appear, and the corruption is in the middle or in one part, then uncover all the flesh; then put a firebrand underneath, and then scrape the corruption from one side to the other, and let the scraping be a little along the length of the corruption, as we have said; and if the corruption is in the joint, then cut the corrupted joint, and scrape the bone where it connects on the other side; and if the corruption is in the continuation of the two joints, there is no other solution than to cut; and if the corruption is in the wrist of the hand, or in the ankle of the foot, that is a very difficult thing, but nevertheless you must examine this corrosion, how it appears to you; and clean it in all the ways you can, but so that the veins or the nerves do not cause you difficulty; and know that the incisors and scrapers for cutting these bones are many, according to the position of the bones and their appearance, and their thickness and their thinness, and their size and their smallness, and their hardness; and therefore it is necessary to prepare for each type of work its instrument; and know that the work will show you the instrument you will need, according to the knowledge of this art, and the characteristics of the diseases; so consider the instrument you need according to what is required.
