of leprosy
Lepers are sometimes helped greatly by cautery, and especially the illness that comes from the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy.
When you see it fit to cauterize, take note if the illness is at the beginning, and if it has been treated according to what we have said in the division, and it neither descends nor remains, and you fear that the corruption will take hold of the whole patient, then make five cauterizations on the head: one in the middle of the head at nine, and the other towards the forehead at the hairline; and two on the two temples, and one behind on the occiput; and leave your hand there so long that the cautery reaches the bone, and so that the scabs come out so that the vapors of the thick humors can escape; and cauterize on the back according to what is written above.
And if the leprosy is spread everywhere and it appears manifestly, you must cauterize it with these cauterizations that we have mentioned on the head, and one cauterization on top of the nose, and two cauterizations on the spine of the neck, and six cauterizations on the spine of the back, and one large one on the rump and another next to it, and two on the two shoulders; and two on the elbows, and two on the tendons of the breast, and one on each joint of the hands and feet, and on the palms of the hands; and beware of the nerves that are on the heel, that you do not burn them; and sometimes one makes a cauterization on the pubic bone, and another on the breastbone, and another on the liver.
And know that the more cauterizations you make, the more help you give, and the more it benefits the patient; and know that the sick person does not feel pain from the cautery like healthy people feel it, because the body is already corrupted.
And the cauterizations must be large and small according to the limbs and joints, as you will find it in the forms of the irons.
Afterwards, treat the area with vetch flour with honey and other treatments until it is healed.
