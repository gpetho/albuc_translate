 CHAPTER NINE.
On the treatment of stones occurring in the eyelids.
 There often occurs in the eyelids a thing resembling a hailstone in its strength and hardness, and therefore called 'hail'.
It is actually a collection of thick humours in the upper or lower lid.
The operative treatment for it is thus: examine; and if the stone is external on the outer aspect of the lid, and mobile in all directions, dealing with it is simple.
You make above it a transverse incision; then scrape gently around it till it is free; then catch it up with a hook and cut it away.
If it is in such a position that you cannot excise it without cutting through the lid, that will not harm the patient at all.
If the incision be big, gather it up with a suture and dress it till it heals.
If it be small, it will be no trouble, for ointment will restore it and heal it.
If the stone is rather toward the inner aspect of the eyelid, then invert the lid and catch up the stone with a hook—you will not need to incise the lid—and cut it all round.
If the lid is pierced in the cutting, it will do no harm at all.
Then, after cutting away the stone, wash the eye with salt water; then treat with cicatrizing medicines till healed.
