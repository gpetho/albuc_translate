There is another type of disease which is called "corrodens", and it is nothing other than a consumption of the limb, for it consumes the limbs as fire does dry wood.	Gangrene is a creeping corruption of a limb, consuming it as fire consumes dry wood.	0.4719589
If you see this disease in a place that can tolerate cautery with fire, then heat the cauteries, both small and large nails, according to what is suitable for the place where the disease is;	If you see gangrene in a part which can tolerate the actual cautery, heat a number of claviform cauteries, small or large to suit the site of the gangrene.	0.6219368
afterwards cauterize it on all sides until you eradicate all the corruption, and none of it remains, so that everything that is corrupted is removed.	Then cauterize it all over till the whole corruption is eradicated and none remains.	0.79650724
And then leave it for three days, and apply on the cauterized areas crushed sulfur with oil until the burns from the fire are gone, and all the corruption.	Then let be for three days, applying to the cauterized site sulphur beaten up with oil, until the whole eschar comes away, and all the corruption.	0.8916632
Afterwards treat it with ointments that generate flesh.	Then treat with stimulating ointments.	0.7295399
And if you see after three days that healthy flesh is not growing, it is good;	If after three days you see the flesh growing healthily and no corruption in it, good.	0.81920576
and if not, then repeat the cauterization on what remains of the corrupted areas.	Otherwise repeat the cauterization over whatever corrupt parts are left.	0.77909
And this affliction was sometimes treated with sharp medicine instead of fire cautery;	Gangrene is also sometimes cured with caustic, for that takes the place of fire; but the actual cautery acts more speedily.	0.53712094
but nevertheless fire cautery is of greater benefit, and I have already described the treatment with sharp medicine in the section: take it when you have need of it.	I have already spoken of the treatment of it by caustic in its section, so take it from there when you have need of it.	0.6261483
