Praefatio.	 Preface.
Postquam compleui uobis o Filii, librum hunc, qui est postremus scientiae in medicina cum complemento ipsius, et consecutus sum finem in eo, ex expositionibus eius, et ipsius declarationibus, uisum est mihi, ut compleam ipsum uobis cum hoc Tractatu qui est pars operationis, id est, chirurgiae cum manu.	 After I have completed this book for you, O Sons, which is the last one concerning knowledge in medicine with its complement, and having reached the end of it by expositions and explanations, it appeared to me to be fitting that I complete it for you with this Treatise, which forms part of operation, i.e., surgery with hand.
Quoniam operatio cum manu prostrata est in regione nostra, et tempore nostro priuata omnino: donec fortasse periit scientia eius, et abscissum est uestigium eius: et non remanserunt ex ea, nisi descriptiones paruae in libris antiquorum, quas mutauerunt manus: et accidit eis error et haesitatio, donec clausae sunt intentiones eius, et elongata est uis ipsius: Visum est mihi, ut uiuificem eam cum ordinatione huius Tractatus in ea secundum uiam ex positionis, et declarationis, et abbreuiationis: et ut ueniam cum formis ferramentorum Cauterii, et reliquorum instrumentorum operis: cum fit ex declarationis additione, et ex properatione eius quod est necesse.	 Since operation with hand is laid low in our region and during our time entirely removed: perhaps the knowledge of it has perished, and its trace vanished; and only small descriptions of it remain in old books, which have been altered by hands; and error and hesitation have arisen until the intention is closed and the force waned: It seemed to me fitting that I bring it to life again with the organization of this Treatise according to the way of exposition, explanation, and abbreviation; and that I come with forms of iron tools of Cautery, and other instruments of work, when it is made by addition of declarations, and by the proper use of what is necessary.
Caussa autem propter quam non inuenitur bonus artifex eius cum manu sua in hoc nostro tempore, est: quia ars medicinae est longa, et oportet auctorem eius exercitari ante illud in scientia anatomiae, quam narrauit Galenus, donec sciat iuuamenta membrorum, et ipsorum formas, et eorum coniunctionem, et separationem, et habeat cognitionem ossium, et neruorum, et lacertorum, et numerum ipsorum, et eorum egressionem, et uenarum pulsatilium, et quietarum, et locorum exitus earum.	 The reason why a good craftsman with his hand is not found in this time is because the art of medicine is long, and its author must exercise himself before that in the knowledge of anatomy as Galen narrated, until he knows the aid of members, their forms, their connection, separation, and the knowledge of bones, nerves, muscles, their number, their departure, veins pulsating and quiet, and their outlets.
Et propter illud dixit Hippocrates, quod nomen cum nomine est multum, et cum opere est paucum, et praecipue in arte manus.	 And for that reason, Hippocrates said that much is the name with a name, and little is the work, especially in the art of hand.
Nos uero iam diximus de illo in introitu huius libri.	 We have already spoken about it at the beginning of this book.
Quoniam qui non est sciens, quod diximus de anatomia, non euacuatur, quin iam cadat in errorem, quo interficiuntur homines: sicut ego uidi multos ex illis, qui formantur de hac scientia, et iactant se de ea absque scientia, et sine experimento.	Whoever is not knowing what we said about anatomy, will immediately fall into error, in which people are killed: as I have seen many of those who are formed from this science, boasting about it without knowledge and without experience.
Quod est, quia uidi medicum stolidum secuisse apostema scrophulosum in collo mulieris, et incidit quasdam arterias in collo: quare fluxit sanguis mulieris, donec cecidit mortua inter manus eius.	 I have seen a stupid physician cut an aposteme (boil) on a woman's neck and accidentally cut some arteries in the neck: therefore, blood flowed from the woman until she fell dead at his hands.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui praesumpsit ut extraheret lapidem uiro, qui processerat in aetate, et lapis erat magnus.	 I have seen another physician who dared to remove a stone from an old man who had grown it, and the stone was large.
Peruenit ergo ad eum, et extraxit ipsum cum frusto uesicae.	 So he came to him, and removed it along with part of his bladder.
Quare mortuus est uir in tertio die.	 Therefore, the man died on the third day.
Et ego quidem iam uocatus fueram ad extrahendum ipsum: et uidi ex magnitudine lapidis, et dispositione infirmi, quod moriretur.	 I had already been called to remove it; and I saw from the size of the stone and the condition of the patient that he would die.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui accipiebat stipem apud quendam Ducum terrae nostrae propter medicinam: et accidit eunucho nigro, qui erat apud ipsum, fractura in crure eius prope calcaneum: et properauit medicus cum ignorantia sua, et strinxit fracturam super uulnus cum puluinaribus, et astellis strictura forti, et non dimisit uulneri expirationem.	 I have seen another physician who received a staff at some Duke's land for medicine, and it happened to him a eunuch black, who was with him, suffered a fracture near his heel: and the physician, in his ignorance, bound up the fracture over a wound with splints, strong bandages, and needles, and did not let the wound breathe.
Deinde absoluit eum secundum desyderia sua.	 Then he cured him according to his own devices.
Postea dimisit eum diebus aliquot, et praecepit ei, ne solueret ligamentum: et stetit sic donec apostematum est crus eius, et ipsius pes, et peruenit ad perditionem.	 Then he released him after some days, and ordered him not to undo the binding: and it stood thus until a boil came on his leg, and on his foot, and it led to his destruction.
Vocatus sum ergo ad eum: et properaui ad soluendum ligamentum: et consecuta est tranquillitas, et euasit a doloribus suis.	 I was then called to him: and I hastened to undo the binding: and peace came upon him, and he was freed from his pains.
Verumtamen corruptio iam confirmata erat in membro: et non potui refraenare ipsam.	 However, the corruption had already been confirmed in the member: and I could not stop it.
Pon ergo cessauit corruptio perambulare in membro, donec periit.	 Stop then the corruption to walk in the member, until it perishes.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui perforauit apostema cancerosum: et ulceratum est post dies, donec magnificata est malicia eius cum domino ipsius.	 And I saw another physician who pierced a malignant ulcer (apostema), and it became worse over days until the wickedness of it was manifested with its master (lord).
Quod est, quia quando est cancer purus ex humore melancholico, tunc non oportet ut perueniatur ad eum cum ferro omnino, nisi sit in membro quod toleret, ut abscindatur totum eius.	 Because when a cancer is pure from the melancholic humor, then it is not appropriate to approach it with iron at all, unless it is in a member that can endure, so that the whole of it is cut off.
Et propter illud o Filii, necesse est uobis, ut sciatis, quod operatio cum manu diuiditur in duas diuisiones: scilicet, operationem cui associatur salus: et operationem, cum qua est periculum in pluribus dispositionibus.	 And because of this (saying) O Sons (of the Prophet), it is necessary for you to know that an operation is divided into two divisions, namely, an operation which is associated with safety: and an operation with which there is danger in many dispositions.
Et ego iam excitaui in omni loco huius libri, in quo uenit operatio, in qua est terror et timor.	 And I have already awakened throughout this entire book, where the operation comes which has fear and dread.
Quare necesse est uobis, ut caueatis illud, et dimitatis ipsum: ut non inueniant stolidi uiam ad loquendum, et dehonestandum.	 Therefore it is necessary for you to beware of that (matter) and separate it from itself: so that fools do not find a way to speak about it and shame it.
Accipite ergo mensuram cum sollicitudine et protectione, et infirmos uestros cum facilitate et firmitudine, et utimini uia meliore perducente gratia Dei ad salutem et successionem laudabilem: et dimittite aegritudines terribiles difficilis sanationis: et tollite animas uestras ab eo quod facit uos timere, ut ingrediatur super uos haesitatio in fide uestra et commodo uestro.	 Take then the measure with care and protection, and your sick ones with ease and firmness, and use a better way leading by the grace of God to health and praiseworthy success: and let go of terrible illnesses difficult to heal; and free your souls from what causes you fear, so that hesitation in faith and comfort may not enter upon you.
Est enim magis remanens ad gloriam uestram, et sublimius in mundo isto, et postremo ad quantitates uestras.	 For it remains more to your glory, and it is higher in this world, and finally to your wealth.
Galenus enim iam dixit in quibusdam suis admonitionibus.	 Galenus indeed said so in some of his advisories.
Non medicetis aegritudinem malam: ne nominemini medici mali.	 Do not heal the evil sickness, lest you be called an evil physician.
Iam autem diuisi hunc Tractatum secundum tria Capitula. ¶	 Now however, I have divided this Treatise according to three Chapters.¶
Capitulum primum.	 Chapter One.
De Cauterio cum igne, et Cauterio cum medicina acuta, capitulatum, et ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum, et ferramentis Cauterii: et omni quod necessarium est in operatione. ¶	 On Cautery with fire, and Cautery with sharp medicine, is discussed, and ordered from head to feet, and the forms of instruments and tools for Cautery, and all that is necessary in the procedure.
Capitulum secundum.	 Chapter second.
De sectione et perforatione, phlebotomia et uentosis, et uulneribus: et extractione sagittarum, et similibus illius: et totum capitulatum, ordinatum formis instrumentorum. ¶	 On sectioning and perforating, phlebotomy and wounding, as well as arrow extractions and similar matters; and the entire chapter ordered in forms of instruments.
Capitulum tertium.	 Chapter third.
De restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus illius: capitulatum, ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum.	 On restoration, dislocation, treatment of twisting, and similar matters; discussed and ordered from head to feet, and the forms of instruments.
Soli Deo Gloria.	 To God alone be glory.
Liber Chirurgici Albucasis.	 The Surgical Book of Albucasis.
Pars I.	 Part One.
¶ De Iuuamento, et Nocumento Cauterii: et quibus complexionibus conueniat, et quo tempore: et si cum ferro, uel auro.	 Chapter on the benefit and harm of cautery, when it is suitable, at what time, and whether with iron or gold.
Caput I.	 Chapter one.
Sed Ante Quidem Quam rememorer operationis cum eo, oportet ut dicam qualitatem Iuuamentorum eius, et Nocumentorum ipsius: et in qua complexione exhibeatur.	 Before I remember the operation with him, it is necessary that I say the qualities of his remedies and his harms, and in which compound they are displayed.
Dico ergo, quod sermo de qualitate iuuamenti Cauterii, et nocumenti eius, est sermo prolixus, et subtilis, scientia, et secretum occultum.	 I say therefore that the discourse on the quality of the cautery and its harm is a long, subtle, learned discourse, a secret hidden thing.
Etiam locuta fuit in eo multitudo sapientum, et dissenserunt in eo: et mihi quidem sufficit parum ex sermonibus eorum, timens prolongationem.	 Also, there was a multitude of wise ones in it, and they disagreed among themselves; and for me, it is enough with little from their discourses, fearing prolongation.
Dico ergo, quod Cauterium confert uniuersaliter omni complexioni, quae est cum materia, et absque materia: excaeptis duabus complexionibus, quae sunt complexio calida absque materia, et complexio sicca absque materia.	 I say therefore that the cautery applies generally to every compound, which is with matter, and without matter; except for two compounds, which are a hot compound without matter, and a dry compound without matter.
In complexione autem calida et sicca cum materia dissenserunt.	 But in the hot and dry compound with matter they disagreed.
Quidam enim dixerunt, quod Cauterium iuuatiuum est in ea.	 For some, it was said that the cautery is beneficial in it.
Et dixerunt alii contrarium illius, scilicet quod Cauterium non est conueniens in aegritudine, quae est ex caliditate et siccitate: quoniam natura ignis est caliditas: et inconueniens est, ut sanetur ex agritudine calida et sicca, cum calido et sicco.	 And others said the contrary to that one, namely that the cautery is not suitable in a disease which is from heat and dryness; because the nature of fire is heat, and it is inconvenient to be healed from a hot and dry disease with heat and dryness.
Et dixit ille qui dicit contrarium illius: quod per Cauterium fit iuuamentum in omni aegritudine calida et sicca, quae accidit in corporibus hominum: quoniam quando tu comparas corpus hominis, et humiditates eius, ad complexionem ignis, inuenis corpus hominis frigidum.	 And he who says the contrary to that one said: by the cautery, it is a remedy for every hot and dry disease which happens in the bodies of men; because when you compare the body of man and his humidity, to the compound of fire, you find the body of man cold.
Et ego quidem dico per sermonem eius: quia ex perimentum iam detexit mihi illud aliquotiens.	 And I certainly say through his discourse: because from experience he has already revealed that to me several times.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut ueniat super illud, nisi qui iam probatus est, et exercitatus in capitulo Cauterii exercitio ultimo, et cognouit diuersitatem complexionum hominum, et dispositionem aegritudinum in se ipsis, et caussas earum, et accidentia ipsarum, et spacium temporis earum.	 Nevertheless, it is not necessary for him to come to that, unless he who has already been proven and exercised in the last chapter of cautery, and knows the diversity of human complexions, and the constitution of diseases within himself, and the causes of them, and their symptoms, and the space of time of them.
Ex reliquis autem complexionibus non est super uos timor: et praecipue in aegritudinibus frigidis et humidis.	 From the remaining temperaments, there is no fear for you: and particularly in cold and moist diseases.
Iam enim conuenerunt omnes medici super eas: et non dissenserunt in iuuamento cum Cauterio in eis.	 Indeed, all physicians agree on them: and they have not disagreed in their treatment with Cautery in them.
Et scitote filii, quod ex secreto curationis per Cauterium cum igne, et bonitate eius super Cauterium cum medicina comburente est: quoniam ignis est simplex, cuius actio non peruenit, nisi ad membrum quod cauterisatur: et non nocet membro alio coniuncto cum eo, nisi nocumento paruo.	 And know, sons, that from the secret of healing by Cautery with fire and its goodness upon the Cautery with a medicine burning, because fire is simple, whose action does not penetrate except to the member being cauterized: and it does not harm another adjacent member unless with minor damage.
Medicinae uero comburentis actio peruenit ad illud quod elongatur ex membris: et fortasse facit accidere in membro aegritudinem difficilis sanationis, et fortasse interficit.	 The action of burning medicine reaches to that which is distant from the members: and perhaps it causes difficulty in healing in the member, and perhaps it kills.
Ignis autem propter subtilitatem suam et bonitatem substantiae suae, non facit illud, nisi superfluat.	 But fire, because of its subtlety and goodness of substance, does not do that unless it is excessive.
Iam uero innotuit nobis illud per experimentum, propter longitudinem seruitutis et studii cum arte, et stationem super ueritatem rerum: et propter illud excusor a longitudine sermonis.	 Indeed, we have come to know that through experience, due to the length of service and devotion to art, and steadiness concerning the truth of things: and because of this I excuse myself from the length of speech.
Et si non esset, quia non licet huic libro meo, afferrem uobis secretum occultum in igne, et qualitatem operationis eius in corporibus expulsionis suae, qua expellit aegritudines sermone philosophico demonstratiuo, qui acueretur a mentibus uestris.	 And if it were not that it is not allowed for this book of mine, I would bring to you the secret hidden in fire and the quality of its operation in bodies, by which it expels diseases demonstrated by philosophical discourse, which would be clear to your minds.
Et scitote filii, quod ipsi dissentiunt in tempore, in quo conuenit fieri cauterium, et ponunt melius tempus ueris.	 And know, sons, that they themselves disagree in time, when it is fitting to make a cautery, and they put the better time according to truth.
Et ego dico, quod cauterium conuenit in omni tempore: propterea, quod nocumentum accidens propter tempus submergitur in iuuamento, quod attrahitur cum cauterio.	 And I say that a cautery is fitting at all times: therefore, because damage occurring by time is immersed in the benefit which is drawn with the cautery.
Et praecipue si cauterium est propter dolores ex doloribus necessariis, fortibus, festinis, qui non tolerant tarditatem: propterea quod timetur ex eis, quod accidat malicia quae est maior, quam paruum nocumentum intrans propter tempus.	 And particularly if a cautery is for pains arising from necessary, strong, urgent pains that cannot tolerate delay: therefore because it is feared that evil which is greater than small damage due to time may occur.
Et non cadat in mentibus uestris o filii illud, quod non extimant, nisi uulgus et stolidi medici, scilicet quod illi aegritudini quae sanatur per cauterium, non est reditio semper: et ponunt illud consequens, et res non est sicut putant: propterea quod cauterium non est, nisi loco medicinae, quae alterat complexionem, et exiccat humiditates quae sunt caussae, quare accidunt dolores.	 And that saying does not enter your minds, O sons, except for the common people and foolish physicians, namely that they do not always return to health by cauterization: and they place this as a consequence, but matters are not as they think: therefore because cauterization is not, except in place of medicine, which alters the temperament, and drives out humors that are the causes, wherefore pains occur.
Verumtamen cauterium superfluit super medicinam per uelocitatem ualetudinis suae, et uirtutem suae operationis, et uehementiam dominii sui: et possibile est, ut redeat aegritudo hora aliqua temporis secundum complexionem infirmi, et locationem aegritudinis suae, et uirtutem eius: et quod praeparatur in corpore eius ex aggregatione superfluitatum in eo: et quod peruenit ad ipsum in acquisitione sua ex cibis, et similibus illis ex caussis, nisi fit aegritudo, in qua administratur cauterium.	 However, cauterization is superfluous over medicine because of the swiftness of its health, and the power of its operation, and the vehemence of its dominion: and it is possible that illness may return at some hour of time according to the temperament of the sick person, and the location of his illness, and the power of his illness: and what is prepared in his body from the aggregation of superfluities in him: and what reaches him for acquisition through food and similar things from those causes, unless illness occurs, where cauterization is administered.
Aegritudo subtilis in membro paucarum superfluitatum, et humiditatum, sicut cauterium dentis, propter dolorem, et similia illi, possibile est enim, ut non redeat in eo ille dolor.	 A subtle illness in a member of small superfluities and humors, such as cauterization of the tooth, due to pain and similar things, it is possible that this pain will not return in him.
Sed illud fit in paucis.	 But this happens rarely.
At uero sermo uulgi iterum, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, est sermo rectus: non ad illud quod ipsi intendunt in illo: quoniam ipsi credunt, quod non est curatio quae conferat cum medicina, neque cum alio post occasum cauterii.	 However, the speech of the common people is again correct that cauterization is the last medicine: not with regard to what they intend in this matter, since they believe that there is no healing that comes with medicine, nor with anything after the end of cauterization.
Res autem est econtrario illius, et intentio, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, non est, nisi quod quando nos administramus modos curationis in aliqua aegritudinum, et non conferunt illae medicinae: deinde administramus in fine rei cauterium, et confert: tunc inde cadit, quod cauterium est postremum mediciuae, non secundum intentionem quam intelligunt uulgus et multistolidorum medicorum.	 But the matter is the opposite of that speech and intention, namely that cauterization is the last medicine, is not except when we administer modes of healing for some illnesses, and they do not come from medicine: then at the end of the matter, we apply cauterization, and it heals: thus it happens that cauterization is the last medicine, not according to the intention that the common people and many foolish physicians understand.
Antiqui autem dixerunt, quod cauterium cum auro est melius, quam cauterium cum ferro: et non dixerunt illud, nisi propter aequalitatem auri, et sublimitatem substantiae suae: et dixerunt, quod non facit pus locus cauterii.	 The ancients said that cautionery with gold is better than cautionery with iron; and they did not say this unless on account of the equality of gold, and the nobility of its substance; and they said, that it does not cause a place of cauterization to produce pus.
Verum non est illud absolute: quoniam ego iam probaui illud, et inueni, quod ipsum non facit illud in quibusdam corporibus absque aliis.	 It is not this absolutely: because I have already proven it, and I found that it does not do this in certain bodies without others.
Et cauterium cum ipso est bonum, et melius quam cum ferro, sicut dixerunt.	 And cautionery with it (gold) is good, and better than with iron, as they said.
Verumtamen quando tu ignis cauterium in igne ex auro, non declaratur tibi, quando ignitur secundum quantitatem quam uis, propter rubedinem auri: et quando properat ad ipsum frigus, et si addis super ipsum ignitionem, liquescit in igne, et uertitur in laminas.	 However, when you make the cautionery in fire from gold, it is not made clear to you when it burns according to the quantity that you want, due to the redness of gold; and when it runs towards it (the fire), and if you add more ignition on top of it, it liquefies in the fire, and turns into layers.
Quare cadit artifex ex illo in occupationem: et propter illud fit Cauterium cum ferro apud nos uelocius et propinquius, ex rectitudine ad operationem.	 Therefore the craftsman falls into this task (of making cautionery with iron); and because of this, cautionery with iron is more swift and near for us in terms of rightness for the operation.
Et ego quidem iam ordinaui hoc Capitulum in Cauterio, secundum capitula: et ordinaui ea a capite usque ad pedes: ut alleuient quaerenti illud quod uult ex eo.	 And I myself have already organized this Chapter on Cauterization, according to chapters; and I have ordered it from the beginning to the end, so that it will be easy for the one seeking what he wants from it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Caput in commissura coronali.	 Chapter on the manner of Cauterizing at the corner of the skull.
Caput II.	 Chapter II.
Confert hic cauterizatio ad dominium humiditatis et frigiditatis super cerebrum: quae duae sunt caussae sodae, et multitudinis fluxus humorum ex capite ad partes oculorum et aurium, et multitudinis somni, et doloris dentium, et doloris gutturis: et uniuersaliter omnis aegritudinis, quae accidit ex frigiditate, sicut paralisis, et sodae, epilepsiae, et apoplexiae, et similia illis ex aegritudinibus.	 Here Cauterization is against the dominion of humidity and coldness on the brain; which are two causes of swelling, and abundance of flow of fluids from the head to the eyes and ears, and abundance of sleep, and pain in teeth, and pain in throat; and universally all illness that comes from coldness, such as paralysis, sodae (a type of seizure), epilepsy, apoplexy, and similar ones from these illnesses.
Modus cauterizationis est, ut praecipias infirmo: ut euacuetur in primis cum medicina solutiua mundificante caput tribus noctibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod exigit uirtus infirmi, et eius aetas, et consuetudo eius.	 The method of cauterization is to instruct the sick person: that it should be evacuated first with a solution of medicine cleansing the head for three or four nights, according to the strength of the sick person, and his age, and his custom.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radi faciat caput suum cum nouacula.	 Then instruct him to make radii on his head with a cupping glass.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas quadratum, ita quod iam posuit manus suas super pectus suum.	 Then have him sit between your hands square, so that he has placed his hands upon his chest.
Deinde pone radicem palmae tuae super radicem nasi sui inter oculos suos.	 Then place the root of your palm over the root of his nose between his eyes.
Vbicumque ergo peruenerit digitus tuus medius, signa locum illum cum incausto.	 Wherever your middle finger comes, mark that spot with an unburnt (or uncauterized) mark.
Deinde igni Cauterium Oliuare: cuius haec est forma.	 Then heat the cautery in oil: whose form is as follows.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum signatum cum incausto, descensione, qua constringatur manus tua paulatim, et tu reuolues ipsum.	 Then place it on the marked spot with the unburnt (or uncauterized) part, descending gradually as your hand is tightened, and you turn it.
Deinde leua manum tuam uelociter, et aspicias locum.	 Then release your hand quickly, and look at the spot.
Quod si uides iam detegi ex osse quantitatem capitis alkiel, aut quantitatem zeuherbi, tunc eleua manum tuam.	 If you see that a quantity of bone or pus has emerged from the skull, then release your hand.
Et si non, itera manum tuam ferro ipso, aut cum alio ab ipso si infrigidatur: donec uideantur ossa, quae dixi tibi.	 And if not, press your hand again with the iron itself, or with another tool if it becomes cold: until you see the bones which I have told you.
Deinde sume aliquid ex sale, et solue illud in aqua, et imbibe in ipso cotum, et pone super locum: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	 Then take something from salt, and dissolve it in water, and immerse the cup in it, and place it on the spot: and leave it for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, et dimitte illum super locum, donec destruatur eschara ignis.	 Then put the immersed cup over the spot, and leave it until the scab of the fire is destroyed.
Deinde cura illud cum unguento tetrapharmacon, usquequo sanetur.	 Then treat it with the ointment tetrapharmacon until it is healed.
Iam dixerunt, quod quanto uulnus plus remanet apertum, emittit pus: quare est melius et magis iuuatiuum.	 They have said that the more an ulcer remains open, the more it discharges pus: wherefore it is better and more helpful.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum, ut cauterizetur cutis usque ad os: et teneatur Cauterium, donec aduratur quiddam spissitudinis ossis.	They said that some should be cauterized down to the bone: and the cautery must be held until something of thickness of the bone is heated.
Deinde radatur post illud quod adustum est ex osse, deinde curetur.	 Then it is scraped after what has been burned from the bone, then it is cured.
Et dicunt alii, quod oportet ut cum cauterio perueniatur ad ultimum, donec imprimat in os impressionem for tem, ita quod cadat os, quod fit sicut forma kirate: aut instrumentum quod mulieres ponunt infuso alphabeti parui: et extimant, quod exspirantur ex hoc loco uapores capitis, et dimittatur uulnus apertum tempore longo.	 And others say that when the cautery reaches the bone, an impression should be made on it for as long as the bone falls out, so that it becomes like the shape of a knife: or an instrument that women place in a small amount of infused alphabet: and they believe that the vapors of the head will expire from this place and the open wound should be left open for a long time.
Deinde curetur, donec consolidetur.	 Then it is cured until it consolidates.
Mihi autem non uidentur hae duae species Cauterii omnino nisi in quibusdam hominibus secundum uiam timoris.	 But I do not see these two types of cautery at all, except in certain people according to the way of fear.
Et dimittere ipsum, apud me est melius cum salute ipsius.	 And let it be left alone, in my opinion it is better for its own health.
Debilitatur enim caput ex solutione continuitatis ipsius naturalis: sicut testificati sumus in reliquis membris: et praecipue quando caput infirmi debile est natura: et species quidem Cauterii prima est magis salua et melior apud me, et ea utor: operare ergo cum ea in salute.	 For the head becomes weak from the dissolution of its own natural continuity; as we have testified in other members: and above all when the head of a sick person is naturally weak: and the first species of cautery is safer and better in my opinion, and I use it: therefore operate with it for safety.
¶ De modo cauterizandi capitis in dolore totius capitis.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing the head in pain of the whole head.
Caput III.	 Chapter III.
Quando in toto Capite accidit dolor chronicus: et prolongatur illud in infirmo, et utitur hyeris, et cochiis, et caputpurgiis, et oleis, et empleumatis.	 When a chronic pain occurs throughout the head and it persists in an ill person and he uses herbs, chickens, leeches, bloodletting, oils and plasters.
Et praecipue si iam cauterizatum est cauterio uno, quod narrauimus, et non confert ei aliquid ex illis: tunc considera.	 And particularly if the head has already been cauterized with a single cautery as we have mentioned and it does not improve with any of these: then consider.
Nam si caput infirmi est fortis creationis natura, et non est debile, et inuenit frigus uehemens: tunc cauteriza cum cauterio alio sub illo parum.	 If the head of the sick person is strong by nature and not weak, and it finds excessive coldness: then cauterize with another cautery slightly.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio, do nec pertranseat cutis, et discooperiatur ex osse quantitas, quam narrauimus.	 Then cauterize it over the entire horn of his head with a cautery, so that the skin is not pierced through and a quantity of bone is exposed as we have mentioned.
Et cauteriza ipsum cauterio uno in occipitio capitis sui, in loco qui nominatur uas: et est locus in quo ponitur uentosa: et eleua matum tuam in hoc, et non discooperias os.	 Cauterize it with a single cautery on the occiput of his head, in the place called "vas": it is the place where wind is placed: and pour your oil in this, and do not expose bone.
Infirmus enim inuenit propter illud dolorem uehementem, et diuersum a dolore reliquorum cauteriorum capitis omnium.	 For the sick person finds, on account of that violent pain, it is different from the pain of all other cauteries of the head.
Et ego dicam hoc Cauterium in loco suo: et oportet quod sit cauterium, quo cauterizantur cornua capitis, et occiput eius subtilius cauterio, quo cauterizatur medium capitis.	 And I shall say that this cautery is in its place: and it must be a cautery with which horns of the head are cauterized, and the occiput more delicately with the cautery with which the middle of the head is cauterized.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in hemicrania, tam cum medicina adustiua, quam cum ferro.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing for hemicania, both with burnt medicine and with iron.
Caput IIII.	 Chapter IV.
Quando accidit in parte capitis dolor et soda, aut extenditur dolor usque ad oculum, et euacuatur cum medicinis mundificantibus caput, et administratur reliqua curatio, quam dixi in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert illud totum: tunc cauterizatio in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterizatio cum medicina acuta comburente: aut cum ferro.	 When pain and swelling occur in part of the head or the pain extends to the eye, and the head is treated with cleansing medicines and other treatment as I have said in the division of diseases, and it does not improve completely: then cauterization in this case is according to two methods: either cauterization with a burning medicine, or with iron.
Cauterium autem cum medicina acuta comburente, est, ut accipias dentem unum allii, et excortices ipsum, et abscindas extremitates eius ex duobus lateribus.	 The cautery with the burning medicine, is to take one clove of garlic, peel it and cut off its ends from both sides.
Deinde scinde locum doloris in tempore cum phlebotomo lato, donec fiat in eo locus sub cute, in quo dens capitur.	 Then divide the place of pain at the time with a wide leech, until there is a place beneath the skin where a tooth can be captured.
Intromitte ergo eum in ipso sub cute, donec occultetur: deinde stringe super ipsum cum puluillo constrictione decenti, et dimitte ipsum quantitate quindecim horarum deinde solue eum, et extrahe allium, et dimitteuulnus duobus diebus, aut tribus: postea pone super ipsum cotum submersum in butyro, donec locus efficiat pus: deinde cura ipsum cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	 Insert it (the tooth) beneath the skin there and let it be concealed; then bind above it with a suitable ligature and leave it for fifteen hours and afterwards dissolve it; then extract the garlic clove and wait two or three days; subsequently place the hot iron (cautery) submerged in butter upon it until a pus forms; then treat the place with ointment until it is healed.
Et si uis fac illud cum quibusdam medicinis comburentibus, quas ego scripsi in tractatu duodecimo, de Medieinis adurentibus.	 And if you wish to perform this (procedure) with certain burning medications which I wrote about in the twelfth treatise, on the Middle Ages.
Cauterizatio uero eius cum ferro, est secundum hunc modum.	 However, cauterization of this kind is as follows:
Igni Cauterium, cuius forma haec est.	 Hot Iron Cautery, whose shape is this.
Et nominatur Clauilis: quoniam forma capitis eius est sicut forma claui, in quo est quiddam curuitatis, et in medio eius est quaedam eminentia parua.	 It is called a Clavilis because the head of it resembles a nail, and there is something curved on it, and in the middle, there is a small projection.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum, et retine manum tuam: et tu reuolue ferrum paulatim cum uelocitate: et sit quantitas quae aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, sicut medietas eius.	 Then place it on the location and hold your hand; and you turn the iron slowly with speed: and the amount to be burned should be of the thickness of the skin, as its middle part.
Et eleua manum tuam, ut non aduratur arteria, quae est inferius, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 And lift your hand so that an artery below is not burned and blood flow occurs.
Deinde imbibe cotum in aqua salis, et pone super locum, et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus: deinde pone cotum cum butyro: postea cura cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	 Then immerse the cotton in brine water, and place it on the location and leave it for three days; then immerse the cotton with butter; afterwards care with an ointment until it heals.
Et si uis, cauteriza hanc hemicraniam cum extremitate cultellari secunda Cauterii.	 And if you wish, cauterize this half-skull fracture with the second part of the Cautery.
Et caue ab incisione arteriae in hac hemicrania, non antiqua proprie.	 Be careful not to cut an artery in this half-skull fracture, not old ones specifically.
¶ De modo cauteriezandi in hemicrania antiqua.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing in an old half-skull fracture.
Caput V.	 Chapter V.
Quando curas hemicraniam, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione praecedente, et quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio: et uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei quod diximus ex cauterio primo cum medicina, aut cum cauterio cum igne, tunc oportet ut ignias Cauterium cultellare, donec albificetur postquam signas super locum doloris cum linea, cuius longitudo sit medietas digiti, aut quasi illud: et depone manum tuam uice una, et stringe eam donec incidas arteriam, et peruenias usque ad os.	 When you treat a half-skull fracture as we have said in the previous cure, and what we have said in the divisions of diseases, and the treatment does not help; and you see from the disease that what we have said with the first cautery with medicine or with cautery with fire does not suffice, then it is necessary that you burn the Cautery knife, until it whitens after you mark the location of pain with a line, whose length should be half the finger or similar to that; and place your hand aside for a moment, and press it until you cut an artery, and reach the bone.
Verumtamen necesse est tibi, ut caueas a continuatione mandibulae, quae mouetur apud masticationem, ne aduratur latus, aut neruus qui mouet ipsam, unde accidat spasmus.	 However, it is necessary that you be careful not to burn the jawbone which moves during chewing, so as not to burn the side or the nerve that moves it, thus causing a spasm.
Et esto super custotiam, et cautelam de fluxu sanguinis arteriae, quae abscisa est.	 And this is about the care and caution concerning the flow of blood from a severed artery.
In abscisione enim eius est timor, et praecipue ei qui ignorat illud quod facit, et non est studiosus, nec expertus: et dimittit operationem cum eo in primis.	 When it is cut (the artery), there is fear; especially of him who does not know what he is doing and is not skilled or experienced. Therefore, the operation is abandoned with it first.
Et ego ueniam cum rememoratione regiminis fluxus sanguinis accidentis ex arteria secundum modum suum, et in loco suo huius libri.	 And I will come again with a reminder of the regulation for controlling the flow of blood from an artery according to its own method, and in its place in this book.
Quod si uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei hoc Cauterium, et uides corpus infirmi tolerans cauterium in medio capitis, sicut narrauimus, cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	 If you see that this Cautery does not suffice for him because of his sickness, and you see the body of the weak person bearing a cautery in the middle of the head, as we have said, care for the wound until it is healed.
Et si uis, administra Cauterium, quod diximus in capitulo extractionis arteriae cum Cauterio habente duos cultellos.	 And if you wish to administer a cautery, do so as we have said in the chapter on the extraction of an artery with a cautery having two blades.
Est enim cauterizatio melior hac et magis conferens.	 For cautionery is better this way and more effective.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Aurium.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing an earache.
Caput VI.	 Chapter VI.
Quando accidit in Aure dolor a frigore, et curatur cum solutiuis, et reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione, et non remouetur dolor, tunc igni Cauterium: et est illud quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma est haec.	 When pain occurs in the ear due to coldness and is treated with solvents, and the rest of the treatment as we have said in the division, and yet the pain does not subside, then cauterization by fire: and this is what is called Punctum, whose form is as follows.
Deinde puncta cum eo post eius ignitionem in circumitu auris totius, sicut reuoluitur: aut in circumitu utriusque, si simul dolor est in utrisque.	 Then, after the cauterization, make small incisions around the entire ear, as one revolves it: or around both ears if pain is present on both sides.
Et elonga te cum Cauterio a radice auris parumper, postquam signaueris loca cum encaustro: et sit cauterii quantitas decem punctorum in omni aure, et quasi illa.	 Then, with the cauterizer, extend slightly from the root of the ear after marking the spots with pitch: and let the amount of cauterization be ten punctures on the entire ear, approximately like that.
Deinde cura loca, donec sanentur.	 Then, care for the marked spots until they heal.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tortura.	 Chapter: Method of Cauterization in Strangulation.
Caput VII.	 Chapter 7.
Tortura quae curatur cum cauterizatione, non est nisi ex speciebus, quae accidunt ex phlegmate, secundum quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum.	 Strangulation which is treated with cauterization, is not except when it occurs from phlegmatic conditions, as we have said in the division of diseases.
Et deuita cauterizationem speciei, quae accidit ex exiccatione, et spasmo nerui.	 And avoid cauterization for conditions arising from exhaustion or spasm of a nerve.
Quando curas hanc speciem torturae cum hyeris, et caputpurgiis, et gargarismis, et non confert curatio tua, tunc oportet ut cauterizes infirmum tribus Cauteriis: uno apud radicem auris, et secundo parum inferius a timpore suo, et tertio apud coniunctionem duorum labiorum.	 If treatment of this type of strangulation with herbs, cleansing, gargles does not work, then it is necessary to cauterize the weakened person with three cauterizations: one at the root of the ear, and second slightly below the earlobe, and third at the junction of the two lips.
Et pone Cauterium tuum ex contrario partis infirmae.	 Place your cauterizer on the weakened side.
Quoniam mollificatio non accidit, nisi in parte quae apparet sana.	 Since softening does not occur unless in the healthy portion.
Et forma cauterizationis est, ut cauterizes ipsum Cauterio in directo extremitatis auris superioris sub cornu capitis parum: et alio in timpore: cuius longitudo sit secundum longitudinem pollicis.	 The form of cauterization is to cauterize the spot with the cauterizer directly on the end of the upper part of the ear, just below the tip of the skull a little: and another at the earlobe; whose length should be the same as the length of a thumb.
Et depone manum tuam cum cauterio, donec comburatur quantitas medietatis spissitudinis cutis.	 Place your hand with the cautery until it is burned to the depth of half the thickness of the skin.
Et haec est forma Cauterii, et est species ex cultellari, cuius forma praemissa est: uerumtamen non est subtilior ea parum, sicut uides: et oportet ut sit cultellus in eo superfluae grossitudinis parum.	 This is the form of Cautery, and it is a species from the knife, whose shape is given below: however, it should not be too fine as you can see; and it must have a knife in it that is not excessively thick.
Deinde cura loca, cum eo quod praecessit: donec sanetur.	 Then take care of the place with it (the cautery) until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Apoplexia antiqua.	 Chapter on the Method of Cauterizing in Ancient Aphasia.
Caput VIII.	 Chapter VIII.
QUando antiquatur Apoplexia, et curas eam cum eo quod diximus, et non confert medicatio tua, et infirmus non habet febrem, tunc cauteriza eum quatuor cauteriis super omne cornu capitis sui, et cauterio in medio capitis, sicut diximus, et cauterio in occipitio capitis, secundum quod praecessit: et modus cauterii sit secundum quod praecessit.	 When apoplexy occurs and your care with what we have said does not help, and the patient does not have a fever, then cauterize him four times with the cautery on all the corners of his head, and with the cautery in the middle of the head, as previously described, and with the cautery on the back of the head, according to what has been said; and the method of cauterizing should be as previously described.
Etiam cauterizatur cum Cauterio super os stomachi: et est magis ultimum.	 Also, it is cauterized with the Cautery on the mouth of the stomach; and this is the final remedy.
Deinde curetur, cum eo quod praecessit.	 Then take care of it with what has been said before.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Obliuione.	 Chapter on the Method of Cauterizing in Oblivion.
Caput IX.	 Chapter IX.
Oportet ut in potu dentur in primis infirmo hyerae magnae, et pillulae mundificantes cerebrum.	 It is necessary that in drink there are first of all large amounts of hyssop, and cleansing pills for the brain.
Deinde rade caput infirmi totum, et pone super occipitium eius emplastrum de synapi descriptum in tractatu emplastrorum: et pone ipsum aliquotiens.	 Then shave completely the head of the sick person, and place on his occiput ointment made from sinapis (mustard) described in the treatise of ointments; place it on him frequently.
Ipsum namque est modus Cauterii: et fac illud secundum ordinem eundem, quem dixi illic.	 For this is the method of cautery; and make it according to the order as I said there.
Si ergo sanatur per illud, bonum est.	 If therefore he is healed by that, it is good.
Si non: tunc fac ei cauteria tria in posteriori parte capitis sui, quae sint descendentia a superiori parte capitis usque ad inferiorem partem oculi: et pone inter omne cauterium grossitudinem digiti.	 If not: then make for him three cauterizations on the back part of his head, which are descending from the upper part of the head down to the lower part of the eye; and place between every cauterization a thickness of a finger.
Deinde cura Cauterium, cum eo quod praecessit.	 Then care for the cautery, with that which preceded.
Si autem uis additionem, et infirmus est tolerans illud: tunc fac ei Cauterium in medio.	 If however you wish an additional treatment, and the sick person can endure it; then make a cauterization in the middle.
Quod si uis additionem: tunc cauteriza ipsum super duo cornua.	 And if you wish an additional treatment: then cauterize him over two horns (i.e., temples).
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: sitque Cauterium oliuare secundum formam, quae praemissa est.	 Then care for it until he is healed; and let the cautery be anointed according to the shape that was given before.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Paralisi, et mollificatione.	 Chapter on method of cauterizing in Paralysis, and softening (i.e., treatment for paralysis).
Caput X.	 Chapter X.
Oportet ut procedas in mundificatione capitis cum hyeeris, et cum eo quod diximus.	 It is necessary to proceed with the cleaning of the head with hyssop and as I said before.
Deinde rade caput infirmi: postea cauteriza ipsum cauterio in medio capitis, et cauterio super omne cornu capitis, et cauterio super posterius ipsius, et tribus super spondiles colli.	 Then shave completely the head of the sick person; afterwards cauterize him with a cautery in the middle of the head, and with a cautery over all the horn of the head, and over the back part of it, and over three on the neck.
Si autem indiges in aegritudine mollificatione corporis pluribus illis, et infirmus est tolerans, et aegritudo est fortis: tunc cauteriza ipsum quatuor cauteriis super spondiles dorsi, et ultima cum cauterio, donec comburatur ex cute plurimum eius, et eleua manum tuam.	 If in sickness there is a need for softening of the body by more than these, and the sick person can endure it, and the sickness is strong: then cauterize him with four cauterizations on the vertebrae, and the last one with a cautery until he burns most from his skin, and loosen your hand.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: et sic cauterium Oliuare.	 Then take care of [the patient], until he is cured: and so cauterize with oil.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Epilepsia.	 On the method of cauterization for epilepsy.
Caput XI.	 Chapter XI.
Non Cauterizatur epilepticus, nisi ille cuius epilepsia est ex phlegmate.	 An epileptic is not cauterized unless his epilepsy is due to phlegm.
Oportet ergo ut mundifices cerebrum eius in primis cum hyeris, et cum reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione: quando infirmus est magnus, aut est tolerans in accaeptione medicinarum.	 Therefore, it is necessary to cleanse the brain of the patient first, with the herbs mentioned earlier, and with the remainder of the treatment as we have described in the division. When the patient is seriously ill or is intolerant of the application of drugs.
Si autem est puer, qui non tolerat medicinas, tunc administratur gargarisma, et masticationes mundificantes cerebrum, ante illud diebus multis cum bonificatione ciborum.	 If the patient is a child who cannot tolerate medicine, then administer gargarisma, and cleansing mastication, before that, for many days with good food.
Deinde rade caput eius, postea cauteriza ipsum Cauterio uno in medio capitis, secundum quod praecessit in modo: et cauterio alio in occipitio eius, et super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio.	 Then shave the patient's head, then cauterize him with a single cautery in the middle of the skull, according to what was described earlier: and with another cautery on his occiput, and over all the horn of his skull.
Quod si infirmus fuerit fortis, et fuerit tolerans, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauteriis, quae dixi in habente paralisim, et mollificationem corporis super spondiles colli, et spondiles dorsi: et sit Cauterium oliuare secundum modum qui praecessit.	 If the patient is strong and tolerant, then cauterize him with the cauteries mentioned in treating paralysis, and soften the body on the spondylus of the neck, and the spine: and let the cautery be olive oil as described earlier.
Si autem infirmus est puer, tunc pone cauterium subtile, secundum hunc modum.	 If the patient is a child, then place a subtle cautery, according to this method.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Melancholia.	 On the method of cauterization for melancholy.
Caput XII.	 Chapter XII.
Quando caussa melancholiae sunt humiditates corruptae, et phlegma grossum, tunc cauteriza ipsum Cauteriis, quae diximus in habente paralisim.	 When the causes of melancholy are corrupted humors and thick phlegm, then cauterize it with the cauteries, which we mentioned in the presence of paralysis.
Et si caussa melancholiae est superfluitas decliuis ad melancholiam, et est corpus infirmi humectum, tunc da ei in potu quod mundificet cerebrum eius, secundum quod praecessit in diuisione: deinde rade caput infirmi, et fac postea tortellam decenter factam ex lino, sicut circulum.	 And if the cause of melancholy is an excess of declivities leading to melancholy and the body is damp, then give him a drink that purifies his brain, according to what was said earlier in division: then shave the head of the sick man, and make afterwards a well-made tourniquet from linen, like a circle.
Deinde pone ipsam in medio capitis: et infirmus sedens quadratus teneatur ab omni parte.	 Then place it in the middle of the head: and let the sick man sitting square be held from all sides.
Deinde praesenta linimentum.	 Then apply a liniment.
Et est dignius ex butyro ouium antiquo.	 And it is more suitable with old olive oil butter.
Et calefac ipsum super ignem calefactione temperata mensura, quam toleret digitus, quando intromittitur in ipsum.	 And heat it over a gentle fire, using a measured temperature that the finger can bear when it is inserted into it.
Deinde euacua ipsum in medio capitis eius in circulo, et dimitte ipsum donec infrigidetur.	 Then evacuate it in the middle of his head in a circle, and let it be until it cools down.
Fac illud infirmo omni hebdomada semel, cum reliquo regimine eius bono, donec sanetur.	 Do this to the sick man every week once, with the rest of his good regimen, until he is cured.
Aut si uis, cauteriza ipsum faciendo puncta parua plurimum eius, praeter quod teneas manum cum cauterio: imo sit odorando.	 Or if you wish, cauterize him by making small holes in many places of his body, apart from holding the cautery in your hand: it should smell good.
Haec enim species cauterii humectat cerebrum cum qualitate.	 For this type of cautery dampens the brain with its quality.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, aut adipe gallinae.	 Then place on him a cloth soaked in butter or chicken fat.

Caput XIII.	 Chapter XIII.
Quando declaratur tibi principium aquae in oculo per signa, quae dixi in diuisione, tunc incipe et pota infirmum, cum eo quod mundificet caput eius.	 When you are informed of the origin of water in the eye through the signs that were said earlier in division, then begin and give the sick man a drink, with what purifies his head.
Et custodi ipsum ab omnibus humiditatibus, et fac eum sedere in balneo, in ieiunio diebus aliquot.	 And keep him away from all moisture, and make him sit in a bath for some days of fasting.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radat caput suum, et cauteriza ipsum in medio capitis sui.	 Then order him to shave his head, and cauterize it in the middle of his own head.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super duo timpora duobus cauteriis, si est incaeptio descensus aquae in duobus oculis simul: aut ex latere uno, si est incaeptio aquae in oculo uno: et abscinde cum cauterio omnes uenas et arterias quae sunt sub cute: et sint cauteria in ea longa in latitudine timporum: et caue a fluxu sanguinis.	 Then cauterize it over two temples with two cauteries, if there is no opening for the descent of water in both eyes at once: or from one side, if there is an opening for water in one eye: and cut off with the cautery all veins and arteries that are under the skin: and let the cauteries be long in width like the temples: and avoid bleeding.
Quod si uides aliquid ex eo, tunc abscinde eum statim cum quacumque medicina est possibile: et ego ueniam cum sapientia, quae est in extractione arteriarum, et abscisione earum, et cautela a fluxu sanguinis.	 If you see something from it (the affected area), then cut it off immediately with whatever medicine is possible: and I will come with wisdom, which is in the extraction of arteries, and their cutting off, and caution against bleeding.
Et quandoque cauterizatur in ceruice, sub duobus ossibus, duobus cauteriis ultime productis.	 And sometimes it (the affected area) is cauterized on the neck, under two bones, with two cauteries brought to the extreme.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Lachrymis antiquis.	 Chapter on the method of cauterization in the eyes (anciently).

Quando lachrymae oculorum sunt antiquae, assiduae: et sunt super uenas, et arterias quae sunt in manifesto capitis exterius, uerificatur quod illud est ex superfluitatibus frigidis, phlegmaticis: tunc cauteriza cauterio eodem quod narraui in incaeptione aquae descendentis, cauterio in medio capitis, et duobus cauteriis super duo timpora, et duobus cauteriis in ceruice sub duobus ossibus.	 When the tears of the eyes are ancient and continuous: and they are over veins and arteries that are manifest on the outside of the head, it is verified that this is from an excess of cold, phlegmatic humors: then cauterize with the same cautery as was narrated in the opening of water descent, cauterize in the middle of the head, and with two cauteries over two temples, and with two cauteries on the neck under two bones.
Et si indiges additione, tunc cauteriza ipsum in omni latere caute oculi, super extremitatem supercilii cum cauterio paruo.	 And if additional help is needed, then cauterize it (the affected area) on all sides carefully around the eye, over the outer edge of the eyebrow with a small cautery.

Quando tu medicaris illud, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert medicatio: tunc propera, et da in potu infirmocochias tribus noctibus: deinde rade caput eius, et cauteriza ipsum cauterio medio, cum cauterio oliuari.	 When you are treating it, as we said in division, and the medication does not help: then hurry, and give infirmocochias for three nights in drink; afterwards shave his head, and cauterize it with a medium cautery, with the oil-filled cautery.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio clauili duobus cauteriis, super duo supercilia sub capillis parum.	 Then cauterize it with two cauteries and a clawed cautery, over the two eyebrows under the hair slightly.
Et custodite ab arteria, ne incidas eam.	 And beware of the artery, lest you cut it.
Et haec est forma cauterii Clauilis.	 And this is the form of the clawed cautery.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in mollificatione Palpebrae.	 Chapter on the method of cauterization in softening the eyelid.
Caput XVI.	 Chapter XVI.
Quando mollificatur Palpebra oculi ab aegritudine, aut humiditate: tunc cauteriza Palpebram cauterio uno, cum hoc cauterio lunari.	 When the eyelid of the eye is softened by illness or moisture, then cauterize the eyelid with one cautery, using this lunar cautery.
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum supra duo supercilia parum duobus cauteriis in omni parte: et elongentur a duobus timporibus: et sit longitudo omnis cauterii, secundum longitudines supercilii: et non ultimes manum tuam cum cauterio, imo secundum quantitatem quod aduritur tertia palpebrae.	 And if you wish, cauterize it over the two eyebrows slightly in every part; and they will extend from both temples; and let the entire length of the cautery be according to the length of the eyebrow; and do not place your hand with the cautery at the very end, but rather according to the amount that is burnt by the third eyelash.
Et haec est forma cauterii secundum hunc modum cauterii lunaris.	 And this is the form of the cautery according to this method of the lunar cautery.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Palpebram cum pili inuersantur pungentes oculum.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing the eyelid when the hairs turn inward, pricking the eye.
Caput XVII.	 Chapter XVII.
Cauterium in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum igne: aut cauterium cum medicina comburente.	 The cautery is in this way according to two methods: either a cautery with fire, or a cautery with a burning medicine.
In cauterio autem cum igne, praecipe infirmo ante illud, ut dimittat pilos suos, si est ex illis qui mundant eos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	 In the cautery with fire, command the sick person to release his hairs beforehand, if he is among those who clean them, until they are long and even.
Si autem pungunt eum apud ortum suum: tunc constringe oculos eius cum uitta, ut non moueantur, donec nascantur.	 If the hairs prick him at their origin: then bind his eyes with a plaster, so that they do not move, until they grow out.
Cum ergo nascuntur et aequantur, tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo: deinde signa super Palpebram oculorum eius cum encaustro, signo quod sit secundum figuram folii myrti: et sit principium signi prope pilos.	 When they are born and equalized, then place the head of the weak in your lap; afterwards mark on the eyelids of his eyes with wax, mark it like the shape of a myrtle leaf; let the beginning of the mark be near the hairs.
Deinde pone cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum.	 Then pour boiled wool into goat's milk or psyllium mucilage over the eye.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	 Then heat the cautery, whose shape is as follows: (There are no further details provided on the shape of the cautery.)
Deinde cauteriza super figuram, quam signasti paulatim in uicibus multis, donec comburatur superficies cutis, quae est sicut figura folii myrti, totam apparentem proprie.	 Then cauterize slowly in several places according to the mark you made, until the surface of the skin burns and appears like the shape of a myrtle leaf entirely.
Et signum sanitatis operis tui est: ut si uideas Palpebram oculi iam contrahi, et pilos eleuari apud puncturam oculi.	 And the sign of your health is that if you see the eyelid of the eye already contracting and hairs rising at the point of the eye.
Eleua ergo manum tuam tunc: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	 Then raise your hand then, and let him go for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur eschara.	 Then place the wool over it with butter until the eschar is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of him with an ointment until he is healed.
Quod si redeat aliquod ex pilis post horam, et mollificetur palpebra: tunc itera Cauterium super illum locum, sicut fecisti in primis.	 If any hair returns after an hour and the eyelid becomes soft: then cauterize that place again, just as you did before.
Si autem pili sunt in inferiori: tunc cauteriza ipsam, donec eleuetur ad locum suum naturalem: et aequetur ut non pungant pili oculum.	 If there are hairs below it: then cauterize it until the hair grows back to its natural place and is equalized so that it does not poke the eye.
¶ De modo cauterizandi cum medicina comburente in eodem casu.	 Chapter on Cauterization with a burning medicine in the same case.
Caput XVIII.	 Chapter XVIII: (The eighteenth chapter of this textbook
Est ut praecipias infirmo, ut dimittat pilos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	 You must instruct the weak person to pluck out his hairs until they grow long and are equalized.
Fac ex charta de panno formam folii myrti.	 Make a shape of a myrtle leaf from parchment.
Deinde accipe ex sapone cognito, et ex calce non imbibita ex unoquoque pondus uncia I aut quasi illud: deinde tere ea simul contritione bona, et fac illud cum festinatione, ut non infrigidetur.	 Then take from known soap and from unslaked lime each a pound or about that amount; then grind them together with good pressure, and make it quickly so it does not become cold.
Deinde ex pande ex eo super chartam quam fecisti sicut formam folii myrti, et pone ipsum super palpebram oculi unius, aut duorum.	 Then spread it out on a piece of parchment that you have made in the shape of a myrtle leaf, and place it over one or both eyelids.
Et pone sub oculo cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: et caput infirmi sit in sinu tuo.	 Place a cup containing soaked cotton wool in the albumen of an egg, and have the head of the sick person be in your lap.
Et pone digitum tuum indicem super medicinam, et preme ipsum parumper.	 Place your index finger on the medicine and press it slightly.
Et tu moueas ipsum quotiens sentit infirmus mordicationem medicinae: quoniam inuenit eius mordicatio sicut ignis.	 You move it whenever the sick person feels the bite of the medicine, for its bite is like fire.
Dum ergo perseuerat hoc quod ipse inuenit mordicatio, tunc dimitte medicinam, et moue ipsam cum digito tuo.	 While it continues to feel this bite that it senses from the medicine, then release the medicine and move it with your finger.
Cum ergo quiescit mordicatio, tunc remoue medicinam, et ablue oculum cum aqua.	 When the bite ceases, then remove the medicine, and wash the eye with water.
Et considera tunc, si uides palpebram eleuari, sicut eleuatur apud contractionem cum igne, aut cum incisione, est bene: et si non, tunc itera super ipsam ex medicina super locum, in quo non imprimit medicina, et non denigrat, donec aequetur operatio tua, et contrahatur oculus.	 Then look to see if the eyelid is rising, as it rises when heated by fire or cut, this is good: and if not, then repeat the application of medicine on the place where the medicine does not press or discolor, until your operation is even and the eye contracts.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur cutis adustionis.	 Then put the cotton wool over it with butter until the burnt skin is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento diaphinicon, aut alio, donec sanetur.	 Then treat him with diaphine ointment or another one until he is cured.
Et necesse est tibi apud operationem, ut custodias ultima custodia, ne in oculum cadat aliquid ex medicina.	 It is necessary for you to keep the last protection during the operation so that nothing from the medicine falls into the eye.
Quod si mollificatur palpebra post dies, et pugnat ex capillis aliquid in oculo, tunc itera medicinam super illum locum, qui mollificatur ex palpebra proprie, sicut fecisti in primis.	 If the eyelid becomes softened after days and some hair falls into the eye from it, then repeat the medicine on that place which has become soft from the eyelid, as you did at first.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of him until he is cured.
Et haec est forma folii myrti.	 And this is the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Et scias, quod oculi hominum diuersificantur in magnitudine, et paruitate.	 And know that the eyes of men differ in size and smallness.
Ergo secundum illud sit consideratio tua: et non occultatur uia rectitudinis illi, cui est studium de hac arte.	 Therefore your consideration should be such that the path of righteousness is not concealed from him who is devoted to this art.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Fistula lachrymali.	 On the method of cauterization for a lacrimal fistula.
Caput XIX.	 Head XIX.
Quando curas Fistulam, cum eo quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc, oportet ut cauterizes ipsam secundum hunc modum.	 When treating a fistula, as mentioned earlier in the classification of diseases, and your treatment does not help: then it is necessary to cauterize it in this manner.
Praecipe infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo, et teneat caput eius minister inter manus suas taliter, ut non moueatur, neque agitetur cum capite suo.	 Command the sick man to place his head in your lap, and let one of his attendants hold his head thus between his hands so that it is not moved or shaken with his head.
Deinde pone Cotum infusum in albugine oui, aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum eius: deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	 Then place a cotton soaked in oil or in the mucilage of psyllium on his eye: then hold a cautery iron over it whose shape is this.
Sit concauum, sicut forma cannae pennae uulturis ab extremitate una, cum qua fit Cauterium: et si uis sit penetrans usque ad extremitatem aliam, et si uis sit sursum sic tenta.	 Let it be concave like the form of a swan's feather from one end, with which the cautery iron is made: and if you wish it to penetrate to the other end as well, or if you wish it to be raised up in this manner.
Verumtamen hoc concauum est melius ad opus tuum.	 However, this concave shape is better for your use.
Deinde exprime fistulam, si est aperta, et extrahe ex ea saniem, et exicca ipsam: et si non est aperta, tunc aperi eam, et extrahe pus eius.	 Then press the fistula open if it is open and drain the pus from it, and excise it: but if it is not open, then you should open it and drain the pus out of it.
Deinde pone tunc super eam Cauterium, quod fit ignitum ualde.	 Then place the cautery iron on it when it has been heated very strongly.
Et tene cum eo manum tuam parumper apud Cauterium ab oculo, ad partem nasi, ut non erret manus tua, aut inquietetur infirmus: et ponas Cauterium in adipe oculi, et corrumpas ipsum.	 And hold your hand near the cautery iron from the eye towards the nose, so that your hand does not wander or shake the sick man: and place the cautery iron on the eyelid fat, and destroy it.
Si ergo peruenis in principio Cauterii tui usque ad os, erit bene.	 If you therefore reach the beginning of your cautery to the bone, it will be good.
Et si non: tunc itera Cauterium semel, aut bis, si indiges illo: et dimitte illud tribus diebus.	 But if not: then repeat the cautery once or twice, as needed; and let it lie for three days.
Deinde pone Cotum cum butyro, et cura ipsum cum unguento exiccatiuo, donec sanetur.	 Then place cotton with butter on it, and treat it with an ointment for ulcers until it heals.
Quod si praeterierint ei quadraginta dies, et non sanatur: tunc pone super ipsum medicinam acutam corrosiuam, donec detegatur os: et rade ipsum secundum quod uenit in capitulo suo.	 If it exceeds forty days and is not cured: then place sharp corrosive medicine upon it until the bone appears; and shave it according to its own chapter.
Et est modus alius Cauterii fistulae, quem quidam primi dixerunt.	 And here is another method of cauterizing a fistula, which some early authors have described.
Intende ad locum fistulae, et finde ipsum: deinde pone in ipsam fissuram camahan subtile, id est, Cannulam subtilem, cuius forma haec est.	 Direct yourself to the location of the fistula and find it; then place a thin cannula (camahan) in the fissure itself, namely, a fine tube whose form is as follows.
Et funde in ipsum quantitatem drachmae ex plumbo liquefacto, et tene manum tuam cum Canna retentione bona, et non moueatur infirmus omnino, ut non currat, uel perueniat plumbum liquefactum ad oculum eius.	 Pour into it an amount of drachmas made from melted lead, and hold the cannula firmly with a good retainer, so that the weak one does not move at all, lest the molten lead runs to his eye.
Et oportet ut ponas super oculum infirmi cotum infusum in albumine oui, aut in aqua.	 It is necessary that you place a warm poultice on the weak one's eye, either in egg white or in water.
Plumbum enim comburit locum fistulae, et sanat ipsam sanatione mirabili.	 For lead burns the location of the fistula and heals it with a marvelous healing.
Quod si sanatur fistula, cum eo quod diximus ex Cauterio, et curatione, est bonum.	 If the fistula is healed, as we have said by cauterization and treatment, that is good.
Et si non, tunc necesse est administrare foramen nasi, et reducere fistulam ad cursum nasi, secundum quod ueniet in loco suo sibi proprio.	 If not, then it is necessary to make a nasal opening and redirect the fistula to the course of the nose, according to its own place.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fissuris Labiorum.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing in facial fissures.
Caput XX.	 Chapter XX. (Chapter twenty)
Multotiens accidunt in Labio fissurae, quae nominantur Pili, et praecipue in labiis puerorum.	 Many times, fissures occur on the lip, which are called Pilae, and especially in children's lips.
Cum ergo tu curas has fissuras, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio, tunc igni cauterium paruum cultellare, secundum hanc formam.	 When you treat these fissures, as we have said in the division of diseases, and treatment does not help, then use small hot cautery (cauterium) with a knife, according to this shape.
Et sit concauitas eius secundum subtilitatem cultelli.	 And let its indentation be according to the sharpness of the knife.
Deinde pone ipsum ignitum festinanter in ipsis fissuris, donec perueniat cauterium ad profundum fissurarum.	 Then place it hastily into the fissures while the hot cautery reaches the depth of the fissure.
Deinde cura ipsum cum caeroto, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of him with pitch, until he is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fistula Oris.	 On the method of cauterization for a mouth fistula.
Caput XXI.	 Chapter XXI.
Quando accidit apostema in radice gingiuae, aut in palato, aut in radicibus dentium: deinde facit pus, et rumpitur: postea antiquatur, et currit pus, et fit fistula: deinde curas ipsam, et non confert in ea curatio, tunc oportet ut ignias cauterium secundum quantitatem, quod capiat in fistula.	 When an abscess occurs at the root of the gums, or in the palate, or at the roots of the teeth: then it produces pus and breaks, later it becomes old and pus runs, and a fistula is formed: then take care of the fistula itself and do not apply treatment to it, then it is necessary that fire cauterization be done according to the quantity that can enter the fistula.
Deinde intromitte ipsum ignitum in foramine fistulae, et tene manum tuam, donec perueniat ferrum ignitum ad profundum eius, et ultimum eius: fac illud semel, aut duabus uicibus.	 Then introduce the fire into the hole of the fistula, and hold your hand until the iron heated reaches its depth and end: do this once or twice.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud, cum eo quod diximus de curatione usquequo curetur.	 Then take care of it afterwards, as I said regarding treatment, until it is cured.
Si ergo abscinditur sanies, et sanatur, erit bonum.	 If therefore the pus separates and heals, it will be good.
Et si non, tunc necesse est detegere locum, et auferre os corrupum secundum quod ueniet in capite suo.	 And if not, then it is necessary to expose the place and remove the rotten bone according to what comes in its head.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Gingiuis, et Dentibus mollificatis.	 On the method of cauterization on softened gums and teeth.
Caput XXII.	 Chapter XXII.
Quando mollificatur gingiua propter humiditates, et mouentur dentes, et curas eam cum medicinis, et non confert: tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	 When the gum becomes soft due to moisture, and the teeth move, and treating it with medicine does not help; then put the head of the sick person in your lap.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma ueniet post haec, ita ut ponas Cannulam super dentem: et intromitte in ea Cauterium ignitum festinanter: et tene manum tuam parumper, donec sentiat infirmus calorem ignis iam peruenisse ad radicem dentis.	 Then take a cautery, whose shape will come later, so that you place the Cannula on the tooth; and insert the heated Cauterium quickly into it: and hold your hand for a short while, until the sick person feels the heat of the fire has reached the root of the tooth.
Et eleua manum tuam: deinde itera Cauterium aliquotiens, secundum quod uis.	 And clean your hand; then repeat the cautery as often as you wish.
Deinde impleat infirmus os suum aqua salis, et teneat ipsam hora una: et exspuat ipsam.	 Then let the sick person rinse his mouth with water and salt, and hold it for an hour; and then spit it out.
Dens enim motus firmatur, et gingiua mollificata stringitur, et siccatur humiditas corrupta.	 The tooth moves to become firm, and the softened gum contracts, and the corruption of moisture dries up.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Dentium.	 Method of cauterizing for tooth pain.
Caput XXIII.	 Chapter XXIII.
Quando dolor dentis est propter frigiditatem, aut in ipso est frigus, aut uermis, et non confert curatio cum medicinis: tunc Cauterium in ipso est secundum duos modos: aut Cauterium cum butyro: aut cauterium cum igne.	 When the tooth pain is due to coldness or there is coldness itself, or worms, and treatment with medicine does not help; then cautery is done in two ways: either cautery with butter, or cautery with fire.
Cauterium autem eius cum butyro est, ut accipias butyrum uaccinum, et bullias ipsum in cochleari ferreo, aut in uenera.	 Cauterium however with butter is, that you receive the waxed butter and boil it in an iron cauldron or copper vessel.
Deinde accipe cotum, et inuolue ipsum super extremitatem tentae.	 Then take a cup and fold it over the end of the wound.
Deinde submerge ipsum in butyro bullito: et pone ipsum super dentem dolorosum festinanter, et tene ipsum donec infrigidet: deinde itera ipsum aliquotiens, donec perueniat uirtus ignis ad radicem dentis.	 Then immerse it (the cup) in melted butter; place it quickly on the painful tooth and hold it until it cools down; then repeat this several times until the heat of the fire reaches the root of the tooth.
Et si uis, submerge lanam, aut cotum in butyro frigido, et pone ipsum super dentem dolentem: et pone super ipsum ferrum ignitum, donec perueniat ignis ad profundum concauitatis dentis.	 And if you wish, immerse wool or a cup in cold butter; place it on the painful tooth and put hot iron on top of it until the heat reaches the bottom of the cavity of the tooth.
Cauterizatio autem eius cum igne est, ut intendas ad cannulam aeris, aut cannulam ferri.	 The cauterization with fire is done using a copper pipe or an iron pipe.
Et sit in corpore eius quiddam grossitudinis, ut non perueniat acuitas ignis ad os infirmi.	 There should be something thick (a barrier) in the body to prevent the sharpness of the fire from reaching the weak bone.
Deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma ueniet: et pone ipsum super illum dentem: et tene manum tuam, donec infrigidetur Cauterium.	 Then apply a hot iron (cautery) with the appropriate shape to the tooth; hold it until it cools down.
Fac illud aliquotiens, nam dolor remouebitur, aut in illo eodem die, aut die alio.	 Do this several times because the pain will gradually disappear, either on the same day or on another day.
Et oportet in impressione illius Cauterii, ut impleat infirmus os suum buyro bono, et teneat ipsum hora una: deinde exspuat ipsum.	 And it is necessary to fill the weakened bone with good butter during the application of the cautery and hold it for an hour; then spit it out.
Et haec est forma Cauterii.	 This is the shape of the cautery.
Cauteriza cum quacumque extremitate uis secundum quod est possibile: et haec est forma Cannulae.	 Cauterize using any shape you wish, provided that it is possible; this is the form of the pipe (cannula).
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Strophulis.	 Chapter on how to cauterize ulcers.
Caput XXIIII.	 Chapter XXIV (24).
Quando Strophulae sunt a phlegmate, et ab humiditatibus frigidis, et non sunt obedientes digestioni per mecicinas, et uis digestionem earum uelociter: tunc igni Cauterium concauum, cuius forma est haec.	 When ulcers are caused by phlegm and cold humors, and do not respond to medication, and you wish to treat them quickly, then use a concave hot iron (cautery) with this shape:
Habens duas extremitates apertas, ut egrediatur fumus apud Cauterium ab extremitate altera: et pone ipsum ignitum super ipsum apostema semel, et secundo, si indiges illo, donec perueniat ad profundum apostematis.	 Having two open ends so that smoke exits from one end at the Cautery and place it burning once on top of the ulcer; and if you need it, put it again, until it reaches the depth of the ulcer.
Quod si apostema est paruum: tunc pone Cauterium secundum quantitatem apostematis.	 If the ulcer is small: then place the cautery according to the size of the ulcer.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super ipsum cotum infusum in butyro, donec remoueatur quod combussit ignis.	 Then leave it for three days and place a covered cup filled with butter on top of it until the burn caused by fire is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dentis, donec sanetur forma cannulae.	 Then treat it with a tooth ointment until the form of the canal is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in raucedine uocis, et constrictione anhelitus.	 On the method of cauterizing in laryngitis and constriction of breath.
Caput XXV.	 Chapter 25.
Quando uincunt humiditates super cannale pulmonis, et praecipue quando illud est cum frigiditate complexionis, tunc oportet ut euacuetur infirmus in primis cum medicinis solutiuis.	 When dampnesss attack the channel of the lung and especially when it is accompanied by coldness of constitution, then the sick person should be evacuated first with dissolving medicines.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum in nocrati apud radicem gutturis in loce depresso: et caue, ne peruenias cum Cauterio ad guttur, neque in cute, nisi quiddam eius.	 Then cauterize it in the neck at the root of the throat in a depressed place and be careful not to reach the throat with the cautery nor the skin unless something from it.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum cauterio alio apud iuncturam colli in ultimo spondili eius ultimando: et sit Cauterium clauile secundum modum, qui praecessit.	 Then cauterize it with another cautery at the joint of the neck at the end of the hip bone and let the cautery be a nail as described earlier.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit, donec sanetur.	 Then treat it with what was previously mentioned until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in aegritudinibus Pulmonis, et Tussi.	 On the method of cauterizing in diseases of the lung and cough.
Caput XXVI.	 Chapter 26.
Quando Tussis et aegritudo Pulmonis sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, et infirmus non habet febrem, neque phthisim, et aegritudo antiqua: tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis supra furculam in locis depressis, lenibus, uacuis.	 When cough and disease of the lung are from cold dampness, and the sick person does not have fever, nor phthisis, and the illness is old: then cauterize it with two cauteries above the clavicle in depressed, smooth, empty places.
Et cauterio alio in medio pectoris inter duas mammillas: et sit cauterium cannulae secundum formam quae praecessit.	 And cauterize it with another one in the middle of the chest between two breasts and let the cautery be a canal as described earlier.
Et si uis sit cauterizatio tua punctando cum cauterio, quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma praecessit in punctatione doloris aurium: et sint puncta ex triginta punctis usque quasi ad alia.	 If your treatment is cauterization by puncturing with a cautery called "Punctum," which shape was described earlier in the procedure for ear pain; and if there are punctures from thirty punctures up to others.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit, donec sanetur.	 Then heal it with that method (the cauterization) until it heals.
Et iam sit cauterium habens tres ramos: secundum hanc formam.	 Now let the cautery have three branches in this shape.
Quare alleuiatur cum eo cauterizatio, quando tu facis cum eo uice una tria Cauteria.	 Therefore, when you use the cautery, alleviate (the pain) with it as if you were using three separate cauteries.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Titillico, in dislocatione Humeri.	 Method of cauterization in a case of Titillicus (a condition affecting the arm), in dislocation of the humerus (upper arm bone).
Caput XXVII.	 Chapter XXVII.
Quando dislocatur caput adiutorii caussa humiditatum, et nonfigitur in hora reditus sui a dislocatione sua, donec sit illud ei consuetudo reditionis, deinde dislocatur a paruo motu, qui accidit sicut nos iam testificauimus illud, tunc oportet ut reducas dislocationem in primis.	 When the head of the arm is dislocated due to the cause of humidity and it does not reposition itself within an hour after its dislocation, until this becomes a habit for it, then it should be dislocated again by a slight movement that occurs as we have already testified; afterwards, in such case, you should immediately restore the dislocation.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, aut super latus sanum.	 Then the sick person lies down on his back or on a healthy side.
Deinde eleua cutim, quae est in interiori Titillici ad superiora cum digitis manus tuae sinistrae: et si iunctura dislocatur ad interiora.	 Then loosen the skin that is inside the Titillicus (the affected area) towards the upper part with your left hand fingers; and if it is connected and dislocated towards the internal parts.
Deinde igni Cauterium habens duo uerua.	 Then take a cautery with two prongs.
Cuius forma est haec.	 This is its shape:
Deinde cauteriza cutim, donec penetret eam usque ad latus aliud, et ueniet figura cauterizationis cum quatuor cauteriis.	 Then cauterize the skin, until it penetrates it on the other side, and the figure of cauterization with four cauteries will come.
Et quandoque fit cauterizatio cum cauterio habente tria uerua, quare fit figura cauterizationis tunc sex cauteriorum: et sunt uerua secundum subtilitatem tentae.	 And sometimes the cauterization is made with a cautery having three points, for this reason the figure of the cauterization will be with six cauteries: and they are the points according to the delicacy of the skin touched.
Et haec est forma cauterii habentis tria uerua.	 And this is the form of the cautery having three points.
Et quandoque additur super hunc modum unum, quare sunt cauteria octo.	 And sometimes one is added to this method, for this reason there are eight cauteries.
Deinde pone super cauterium porros contritos cum sale.	 Then place on top of the cautery split rods with salt.
Deinde fac adhaerere infirmum tranquillitati, ut non moueatur membrum tempore aliquo, donec confortetur.	 Then make the patient rest in peace so that a limb is not moved at any time until it recovers.
Et si dislocatio est ad superiora, et raro fit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super humerum cauterio clauili, aut cauteriis multis punctando.	 And if the dislocation is towards the upper part (shoulder), and this rarely occurs, then cauterize it on the shoulder with a pointed cautery or many cauteries poking.
Nam iunctura firmatur, et remouetur humiditas: et sanatur infirmus.	 For union strengthens, and moisture is removed; and the sick person recovers.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Stomachum.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing the stomach.
Caput XXVIII.	 Chapter 28.
Quando accidunt in Stomacho frigus et humiditates multae, donec extrahant ipsum a complexione sua, et multiplicentur catarri ad ipsum, et assiduas modos curationis, et non confert: tunc oportet ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat crura sua, et manus suas.	 When cold and much moisture occur in the stomach, until it expels itself from its composition, and catarrh multiplies towards it, and persistent methods of treatment, and this does not help; then the patient should lie on his back with his legs extended, and his hands.
Deinde cauteriza cum tribus cauteriis, cauterio sub cochleari pectoris quantitate digiti unius cum cauterio clauili, et duobus cauteriis inferius a duobus lateribus cauterii unius, donec ueniat figura cauteriorum triangulata.	 Then cauterize with three cauteries: one cautery in the size of a cochlea of the breast, another cautery like a nail, and two cauteries below the sides of one cautery's base, until the figure of the cauteries becomes triangular.
Et elonga inter utraque ut non coniungantur, quando facient pus.	 And stretch it between each (part) so they do not join, when pus forms.
Et sit profunditas cauterii quantitas duarum tertiarum grossitudinis cutis.	 Let the depth of the cautery be the size of two fingers breadth of the skin.
Et sit figura cauteriorum secundum hanc formam sine additione: et si uis cauteriza cauterio magno in medio stomachi secundum hanc formam: et sit cauterium quo fit hoc cauterium unum secundum figuram circuli secundum hanc formam.	 Let the figure of the cauteries be as such without addition: and if you wish to cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this shape, let the cautery which is used for this have the shape of a circle according to this shape.
Et cauterizatur stomachus punctando ei qui terretur ab hoc cauterio: et est, ut signes super stomachum punctum secundum quantitatem, quam uis cum encaustro: deinde cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio puncti: deinde cura ipsum cum curatione, quae praecessit donec sanetur.	 The stomach is cauterized by pricking it with a cautery that presses against it; and it is as if signs are placed on the stomach according to the size you wish with encaustic: then cauterize the place with the cautery for the point, then care for it with the treatment that preceded until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Epar frigidum.	 Paragraph on the method of cauterizing Epirrhus (Epirus).
Caput XXIX.	 Chapter 29.
Quando accidit in Epate dolor ex frigiditate et humiditate, aut ex uentositate grossa, donec egrediatur a complexione sua naturali egressione superflua, et curatur infirmus, cum eo quod diximus, et non proficit in illo: tunc oportet ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam, et signes cum encaustro tria cauteria secundum hanc figuram, et hanc quantitatem eandem super Epar inferius ab hypocundriis, ubi peruenit cubitus hominis: et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium secundum grossitudinem digiti: et sit cauterium secundum longitudinem corporis rectum: et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio multum.	 When there is pain in the liver due to coldness and moistness, or from gross flatulence, until it expels its superfluous excretion through its natural discharge, and the patient does not get better by what was said above: then the patient must lie down on his back on his neck, and mark three cauteries with encaustic according to this figure, and the same size below Epirrhus where the elbow of a man reaches; and let the space between each cautery be the size of a finger; and let the cautery be as long as the body; and do not press your hand too much with the cautery.
Et sit quantitas eius quod aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, quantitas medietatis eius non additum: et sit infirmus stans super pedes suos.	 Let its (the cautery's) size which is heated be the thickness of the skin plus half of it; and let the patient stand on his feet.
Si autem non est stans, tunc sit iacens, qui iam extendit crura sua, et eleuauit brachia sua.	 If it is not standing, then let it lie (down), which already extended its legs, and raised its arms.
Haec est forma cauterii.	 This is the form of cautery.
Et tibi quidem possibile est, ut cauterizes ista cauteria cum cauterio cultellari, quando tecum est subtilitas et prudentia in arte.	 And indeed it is possible for you to use this cautery with a sharp surgical knife when subtlety and wisdom are present in your art.
Et custodi te, ut non ultime procedas in cauterizatione, et aduratur spissitudo cutis totius, quare aduratur corpus totum, et perueniat ad intestina: quoniam cutis illic est subtilis, scias ergo illud.	 Be careful that you do not advance too far in cauterization so that the thickness of the skin is burned completely, for then the entire body is burnt and it reaches the bowels; because there the skin is delicate, therefore know this.
¶ De modo cauterizandi apostemata Epatis.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing liver abscesses.
Caput XXX.	 Chapter 30.
Quando accidit exitura, et uis scire, si illud apostema est in carne Epatis, aut in tunica eius: tunc si est in carne Epatis, inuadit infirmum dolor, et grauitas absque acuitate: et si est in tunica Epatis, cum dolore est acuitas uehemens: et uides iam, quia fatigauit medicos eius curatio.	 When there is a discharge and the desire to know if this abscess is in the liver flesh or its membrane; then, if it is in the liver flesh, a mild pain and heaviness occurs without sharpness; but if it is in the liver membrane, with pain there is strong sharpness; and you see that the treatment of it has already exhausted the doctors.
Oportet ergo ut resupinet infirmus super ceruicem suam.	 Therefore, the sick person must lie on their neck.
Deinde figura locum apostematis cum encaustro: deinde ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	 Then place the position of the abscess with the hot iron; then heat the cautery similar to a small rod.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its shape.
Et cauteriza cum eo cauterium unum, donec comburatur cutis tota, et perueniat ad siphac, donec egrediatur sanies tota: deinde cura ipsum curatione exiturarum, donec sanetur.	 And use the cautery with it until the entire skin is burned and reaches the pus sac, until all the pus comes out; then take care of the wound by treating the discharge, until it heals.
Et non oportet ut hac cauterii specie utatur, nisi cuius studium in arte medicinae prolongatur: et per cuius manus concurrunt aegritudines istae cum experimento aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super huiusmodi operationem.	 And it is not appropriate to use this cautery method unless one's passion for the art of medicine is prolonged; and through whose hands these diseases frequently occur with experience; then he may dare on such an operation.
At uero dimittere ipsam, apud me est melius.	 But it is better to let go of it (the abscess), in my opinion.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Pleuresi.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing pleurisy.
Caput XXXI.	 Head, Chapter XXXI.
Dixerunt antiqui, cauterium cum radicibus aristolochiae ad Pleuresim frigidam secundum hunc modum.	 The ancients said, cautery with the roots of Aristolochia for a cold pleurisy in this manner.
Et est, ut recipias ex radicibus aristolochiae siccae longae, radicem unam longiorem, quae ex ea inuenitur, et sit sicut grossitudo digiti.	 And it is to receive from the dried roots of Aristolochia, one longer root which can be found among them, and let it be as thick as a finger.
Deinde submerge eam in oleo: et accende ipsam in igne.	 Then immerse it in oil and light it on fire.
Deinde cauteriza cauterio uno in eo quod est inter continuationem furculae cum collo, et duobus cauteriis paruis sub guidezi parum decliuibus ad partem, quae est sub barba.	 Then cauterize with one hot iron in what is between the joining of the collarbone with the neck, and with two small irons under the chin a little below where the beard is.
Et duobus cauteriis etiam in eo, quod est inter costam quintam et sextam decliuibus ad posteriora parumper: et cauterio alio in medio pectoris, et alio supra stomachum.	 And with two irons also in what is between the fifth and sixth ribs a little below towards the back; and with another iron in the middle of the chest, and another above the stomach.
Et tribus cauteriis a posterioribus: uno in eo quod est inter duas spatulas: et duobus cauteriis a duobus lateribus pectoris, inferius cauterio quod est inter duas spatulas.	 And with three irons from the back; one in what is between the scapulas; and with two irons on the sides of the chest, the lower iron being what is between the scapulas.
Et non oportet ut comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit in manifesto cutis odorando.	 And you must not press your hand with the iron, but rather let it smell freely of the skin.
Et iam dixerunt quidam antiqui, quod ex hominibus sunt qui utuntur cauterio ex ferro simili radio: et igniunt, et intus mittunt ipsum in eo quod est inter costas, donec perueniatur cum eo ad ipsum apostema, et egrediatur sanies: sicut diximus in apostemate Epatis.	 And some ancients have said that there are humans who use an iron similar to a ray and burn it, and push it inside what is between the ribs until it reaches the abscess, and let pus come out; as we said in the abscess of the liver.
Sed in hac perforatione cum cauterio est ex timore, quod aut moritur infirmus statim, aut accidit in loco fistula, cui non est sanatio.	 But in this perforation with iron is feared that either the weak person will die immediately or a fistula occurs at the place which does not heal.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Splenem Caput XXXII.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing the spleen, Head XXXII.
Quando tu curas aegritudinem splenis, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua, tunc cauterium in ea est secundum tres modos, qui omnes sunt recti.	 When you treat the illness of the spleen, as we said in the treatment of diseases and your treatment is not effective, then cautery on it is in three ways, all of which are correct.
Quorum unus est, ut facias tria cauteria, aut quatuor lineando secundum longitudinem splenis secundum figuram cauteriorum Epatis, quorum praecessit figura.	 One of them is to make three or four cautery points, arranging them along the length of the spleen according to the shape of Epate's cauteries, whose preceding figure it is.
Et sit inter omne cauterium quantitas grossitudinis digiti, aut plus parum.	 And let the size between each cautery be that of a finger, or more or less.
Et sit modus cauterii, quem diximus in cauterio epatis aequaliter.	 The method of cauterization on the liver, which I mentioned in the liver cautery, shall be equal.
Et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio: et sit infirmus resupinus super dorsum suum.	 Do not press your hand with the cautery, and let the patient be weak lying on his back.
Et modus alius de cauterizatione est: ut ignias cauterium habens duo uerua, quod diximus in capitulo dislocationis humeri: et eleua cutem, quae est in directo splenis, ubi peruenit cubitus infirmi sinister: et sit eleuatio tua qua eleuas cutem secundum latitudinem corporis, ut cadant cauteria secundum longitudinem corporis.	 Another method of cauterization is: holding the cautery with two prongs, as I said in the chapter on dislocation of the shoulder; and peel off the skin that is directly on the spleen, where the arm of the weak person arrives; and your peeling should be according to the width of the body, so that the cauteries fall along the length of the body.
Deinde intromitte duo uerua ignita ualde, donec cum eis penetres cutem a parte altera: deinde extrahe cauterium: fiunt ergo cauteria quatuor.	 Then insert two prongs heated very hot until they penetrate the skin from the other side; then remove the cautery; thus four cauteries are made.
Et si uis cauteriza cum cauterio alio habente tria uerua.	 And if you wish to cauterize with a cautery having three prongs.
Deinde cura cauterium postquam dimittis ipsum emittere pus diebus multis: est enim magis conferens quamque reliqua quae praecesserunt ex curatione.	 Then take care of the cautery after you release it to emit pus for many days; for it is more helpful than the other methods that preceded it in treatment.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Hydropisi.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing in dropsy.
Caput XXXIII.	 Chapter XXXIII.
Cauterium non cadit in Hydropisi, nisi ascliti proprie.	 A cautery does not fall in dropsy unless it is properly applied.
Quando tu curas Hydropicum cum modis curationis, quos diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, et cauterio uno super stomachum, et cauterio alio super epar, et cauterio super splenem, et cauteriis duobus post dorsum inter spondiles, et uno in directo pectoris, et alio in directo stomachi: et sit quantitas profunditatis cauterii propinqua spissitudini cutis.	 When treating a dropsy with the methods of treatment that I mentioned in the division, and if the treatment is not helpful, then it is necessary to cauterize it with four cauteries around the navel, one on the stomach, another on the liver, another on the spleen, two behind the loins, and one on the breast and another on the stomach; and the size of the cautery should be close to the thickness of the skin.
Deinde dimitte cauterium apertum, ut emittat pus tempore longo.	 Then release the open cautery, so that it may emit pus over a long time.
Et non euacues infirmum a curatione post cauterium cum eo: quod oportet ut aggregentur ei duae intentiones: et festinabit ad ipsum sanatio cum auxilio Dei.	 And do not evacuate the weak from treatment after cautery, for it is necessary that two intentions be gathered to him: and healing will hasten towards him with God's help.
Forma uero cauterii cum quo cauterizatur uenter, sit clauilis: secundum quod praecessit forma eius: et illius cum quo cauterizatur dorsum, sit oliuaris secundum quod praecessit eius forma.	 The form of the cautery with which the abdomen is cauterized should be clavils, according to its preceding form; and the one with which the back is cauterized should be oliuaris, according to its preceding form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Pedes, et Crura.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing feet and legs.
Caput XXXIIII.	 Chapter XLII (42).
Quando apostemantur in Hydropico, et replentur aqua citrina: oportet ut cauterizes super dorsum Pedis in nocrati, quae est inter auricularem et anularem: et eleua manum tuam cum cauterio, et non torqueas ipsum: deinde eleua manum tuam: et non iteres ipsum omnino.	 When they are amputated in hydropicus and filled with citrine water, it is necessary to cauterize on the back of the foot at the nocrati, which is between the auricular and anular; then lift your hand with the cautery, do not twist it; then lift your hand; do not touch it again.
Resudet enim aqua citrina, et sit cauterium secundum hanc formam.	 The water of citrine will boil, and let the cautery be in this shape.
Deinde fac super duo crura duo cauteria in omni crure, et fiat cauterium cum extremitate cultellari cauterii: et fiat cauterium secundum longitudinem cruris, unum sub genu, et alterum inferius eo, circiter medium cruris: et super omnem coxam cauteria duo: et dimitte cauterium apertum absque curatione tempore longo: ut resudet ex eo aliquod aquae: deinde cura ipsum cum reliquis quae diximus.	 Then make two cauteries for each leg, and let the cautery be with the end of a small cautery at the end; and let the cautery be along the length of the leg, one below the knee, and the other lower by about half the length of the leg; and over the entire hip, place two cauteries; and release the open cautery without treatment for a long time, so that something boils out of it; then treat it with the rest as we have said.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in solutione Ventris.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing in the solution of the abdomen.
Caput XXXV.	 Chapter XLV (45).\]    Cauterium
Quando est solutio uentris ex frigore et humiditatibus, donec debilitet uirtutes retentiuam et digestiuam, quae sunt in stomacho et intestinis: et curatur illud cum modis curationis, et non sanatur: et uides infirmum tolerantem cauterium exuberantis uirtutis, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio magno super stomachum suum, secundum quod praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi cum cauterio circuli, et quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici subtilibus, cum cauterio clauili subtili: et cauterio super alcatin supra alhosos magno, aut duobus cauteriis.	 When the solution of the abdomen is due to cold and humidity, until the powers retained and digestive ones, which are in the stomach and intestines, weaken; and it is treated with methods of treatment, but does not heal; and you see the weak enduring a cautery with excessive strength, then cauterize it with a large cautery over the stomach, according to what was preceded in the cauterization of the stomach with a circular cautery, and four subtle cauteries around the navel, with a subtle clavils cautery; and a large cautery or two cauteries over the alcatin above the alhosos.
Et si uides humiditates exuberantes, et infirmum tolerantem illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio super pectinem, et cauterio super omne ilium: et fortasse addes duo cauteria parua super stomachum prope magnum.	If you see excessive moistures and the patient enduring it, then cauterize it with a cautery on the crown and also on all of it [the head]: and perhaps add two small cauteries near the stomach.
Est enim curatio proficiens, cuius iuuamentum non errat.	 The treatment is advancing, whose benefit is not in error.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Hemorroidas.	 On the method of cauterizing hemorrhoids.
Caput XXXVI.	 Chapter XXXVI.
Quando in ano sunt Hemorroides antiquae multae, aut una, et sunt ex humoribus grossis, frigidis, aut humiditatibus corruptis, et curantur cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: tunc cauteriza tribus cauteriis super inferiorem spondilem dorsi sub almeidati parumper triangulatim, et cauterio sub umbilico quasi duobus digitis.	 When there are many old hemorrhoids in the anus, either one and they are from thick, cold or corrupted fluids, which cannot be cured as we have said in the division, then cauterize with three cauteries on the lower part of the back of the hipbone slightly triangularly under the almeidati, and cauterize under the navel about two fingers.
Et si cogitas, quod stomachus eius infrigidatus sit, et cibus eius non digeratur, et faciem eius uides apostemari, tunc cauteriza eum super stomachum cauterio magno, secundum quod praecessit: et cauterio super Epar eius, et alio super Splenem ipsius, cum cauterio clauili: et dimitte cauterium apertum tempore aliquo: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 If you think that his stomach is chilled and his food is not digested, and you see the face turning pale, then cauterize it on the stomach with a large cautery, as mentioned before: also cauterize on the liver and another one on the spleen, with a cautery claw: leave the open cautery for some time: then take care of him until he is cured.
¶ De modo cauterizandi althelul post abscisionem eorum.	 On the method of cauterizing althelul after their removal.
Caput XXXVII.	 Chapter XXXVII.
Quando tu abscindis althelul, tunc ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	 When you remove althelul, then heat the cautery which is similar to a rod.
Deinde intromittite ipsum ignitum in ipsum althelul abscisum: et ultima manum tuam, donec perueniat cauterium ad orificium uenae, ex qua currit sanguis: fac illud semel, aut bis.	 Then introduce the heated cautery into the removed althelul: and press your last finger until the cautery reaches the opening of the vein from which blood flows: do this once or twice.
Si ergo althelul fuerint multa, tunc cauteriza unumquodque cauterio secundum quod narrauimus.	 If there are many althelul, then cauterize each one with a cautery as I have said.
Deinde cura ea, cum eo quod confert eis ex unguentis, donec sanentur.	 Then take care of them with what helps them from ointments until they are cured.
Et si cauterizas eum cauterio magno super alcatin, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	 And if you cauterize him with a large cautery on alkali, it is more ultimate in help.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Fistulam in ano.	 On the method of cauterizing an anal fistula.
Caput XXXVIII.	 Chapter XXXVIII.
Quando non obedit infirmus sectioni et operi quod narrauimus in loco suo, et terretur ab illo, fortasse sanatur cum cauterio.	 If the sick person does not obey the incision and operation as we have described earlier, and is afraid of it, perhaps he will heal with a cautionery.
Cum ergo accidit alicui Fistula, et antiquatur, currit pus ex ea, et humiditates corruptae.	 When there occurs a fistula, and it becomes old, pus runs out of it, and the surrounding tissues are corrupted.
Dignius ergo quod oportet est, ut probes eam cum tenta subtili.	 Therefore, it is appropriate to examine it with a thin probe.
Deinde cognosce quantitatem profunditatis eius cum tenta.	 Then recognize the depth of it using a probe.
Deinde ignias cauterium, quod est simile radio.	 Then apply fire cautery which is similar to a rod.
Deinde intromit te ipsum ignitum in ipsam Fistulam et quantitatem in qua intrauit clauus.	 Then you introduce yourself with the fire cautery into the fistula and determine the depth where it was inserted.
Et itera super eam cauterium, donec comburantur illa omnia corpora corrupta, semel, aut bis, aut ter, secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	 And repeat the cautery on it until all the corrupted tissues are burned away, once or twice or thrice, according to your need.
Et custodi te ab adustione nerui, si est illic, aut uenae magnae: aut si Fistula uadit ad corpus uesicae, aut ad corpus intestini, tunc custodi te ab istis locis omnibus.	 And be careful not to burn the nerve or large vein if there is one; or if the fistula goes to the bladder or intestine, then beware of these places altogether.
Et non facias illud, nisi quando fistula est in loco carnoso: et cogitas, quia non est penetrans.	 And do not do this unless the fistula is in a fleshly place; and consider that it does not penetrate.
Deinde cura locum usquequo sanetur.	 Then care for the place until it heals.
Si autem sigillatur locus, et abscinduntur ab eo materiae, et remanet sic tempore longo: tunc scias, quia iam sanatus est integre.	 If the place is covered and the material removed from it and it remains for a long time; then know that it has healed completely.
Et si non abscindunt ab eo materiae, tunc scias quia est penetrans, aut in profundo eius est os corruptum, aut quasi illud ex illis: quorum rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	 And if the material is not removed from it, then know that it penetrates or there is a deep corruption of bone in it, or something similar from those which will be remembered in their places.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Renes.	 Chapter on cauterizing Kidneys.
Caput XXXIX.	 Chapter XXXIX.
Quando accidit in Renibus dolor ex frigore, aut ex uentositate grossa, et minuitur propter illud coius infirmi, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum super almethenem super ipsos renes, cauterio super omnem renem cum cauterio clauili, cuius praecessit rememoratio.	 When there is pain in the kidneys due to cold or gross wind and it weakens the body of the sick person, then it is necessary to cauterize it on top of the almethenum over both kidneys, with a cautery on all the kidney with a cautery claw, whose method has been previously mentioned.
Et fortasse cauterizamus ipsum secundo in ipso almeidatu.	 And perhaps we cauterize it (the wound) again at the almond stage.
Quare uenient tria lineata.	 Because three lines will come.
Ergo erunt magis ultima in iuuamento.	 Therefore, they will be more beneficial (or effective) at healing.
¶ De modo cauteritzandi Vesicam.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing bladder.
Caput XL.	 Chapter XL:
Quando accidunt in Vesica debilitas, et mollificatio a frigo re et humiditatibus, donec non retineat infirmus urinam, tunc cauteriza ipsum in inferiori parte suminis super Vesicam, ubi incipiunt pili pectinis, et cauterio a dextra suminis, et alio a sinistra illius: et sit longitudo illius cauterizationis lateris secundum quantitatem nodi pollicis: et cauteriza ipsum cauterio inferiori dorsi, aut duobus cauteriis, si indiges illo: et sit secundum quod praecessit cauterium clauile.	 When weakness and softening occur in the bladder due to cold and humidity, so that the weak cannot retain urine, then cauterize it below at the lower part of the scrotum over the bladder, where the pubic hairs begin, and with one cautery from the right scrotum, and another on its left; and let the length of this cauterization be according to the size of the knuckle of the thumb; and cauterize it with a lower back cautery, or with two cauteries if necessary; and let it be according to the preceding cauterization.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Matricem.	 When weakness and softening occur in the uterus due to cold and humidity, so that the weak cannot retain fluids, then cauter
Caput XLI.	 On the Cauterization of the Uterus.
Quando accidunt in Matrice frigus et humiditates, et prohibetur per illud ab impregnatione, et corrumpuntur menstrua eius, et tardatur prouocatio eorum, et accidit ei apud aduentum eorum dolor, tunc oportet ut cauterizetur tribus cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, sicut diximus in cauterizatione uesicae, et cauterio super alcatim inferius dorso, aut duobus cauteriis: et sit cauterium clauile.	 When cold and humidity occur in the uterus, preventing conception, and the menstruation of it is corrupted, their provocation is delayed, and pain occurs during their onset; then it is necessary that it be cauterized with three cauteries around the navel, as we said in the cauterization of the bladder, and with a cautery below the lower back, or with two cauteries; and let the cauterization be like the one described for the bladder.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Ancham in dislocatione.	 On the Cauterization of the Anus in Dislocation.
Caput XLII.	 Title XLII. (Title Forty-Second)
Quando effunduntur humiditates mucosae ad pixidem Anchae, et fiunt caussa exitus eius a loco suo: et signum illius est, quod prolongatur crus super alterum, quando comparantur adinuicem: et inuenitur locus dislocationis in eo uacuus.	 When the mucous discharges flow towards Ancha's plaster and cause it to leave its place: and a sign of this is that the leg extends over the other when they are compared one against the other: and there is an empty spot found at the dislocation in it.
Oportet ergo ut cauterizes infirmum super pixidem Anchae ipsius cauterio simili circulo: postquam tu signas cum encaustro in circumitu pixidis, sicut reuoluitur: et ut cadat ipsa pixis in medio circuli.	 Therefore it is necessary that the weak part be cauterized over Ancha's plaster with a similar cautery circle: after you mark it with wax around the plaster, as prescribed: and so that the plaster falls into the center of the circle.
Et sit cauterium cuius forma praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi.	 And let the shape of the cautery be as it was described in the cauterization of the stomach.
Quod si tibi non est praesens hoc cauterium, tunc cauteriza ipsum tribus cauteriis, cum cauterio oliuari magno: et fiat cauterio profunditas secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis totius.	 If this cautery is not present to you, then cauterize it with three cauteries, with a large oil-soaked cautery: and let the depth be according to the thickness of the skin's entirety.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Sciatica.	 On the method of cauterizing in Sciatica.
Caput XLIII.	 Title XLIII. (Title Forty-Third)
Quando accidit dolor in pixide anchae, et sunt caussa illius frigus et humiditates: et curatur infirmus cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, et antiquatur illud: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum ab humoribus grossis cum pillulis foetidis, aut cum pillulis artificialibus, et similibus.	 When pain occurs in Ancha's plaster and the cause is coldness and humidity: and it is treated with what was said above, but the treatment does not help and it worsens: then it is necessary to dissolve the weak part from thick humors with fetid pills or artificial pills, and similar ones.
Deinde cauteriza eum.	 Then cauterize it.
Et modus cauterii in ea est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum medicinis adurentibus, aut cauterium cum igne.	 And the method of cauterization is according to two methods: either with a cautery with medicines that drive it out, or with fire.
Cauterium cum igne, est secundum multos modos.	 The cautery with fire is in many ways.
Quorum unus est, ut cauterizes super pixidem anchae ipsius tribus cauteriis triangulatis, secundum hanc formam.	 One of them is to cauterize over Ancha's plaster with three triangular cauteries in this shape.
Et fac eis profunditatem bonam, uel malam.	 Make a good or bad depth for them.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium quantitatis grossitudinis digiti: sitque cauterium oliuare.	 Let the space between every cautery of any size be that of a finger's breadth; and let the cautery be made of oil.
Quandoque autem fit cauterium in medio super caput anchae ipsius.	 Sometimes, a cautery is made in the middle of the anus itself.
Quare sunt quatuor cauteria.	 Why are there four cauteries?
Et si uis cauteriza cum circulo, cuius praecessit forma in cauterizatione dislocationis anchae, uno: ut sit circulus continens ancham totam.	 If you wish to cauterize with a ring, the shape of which preceded in the cauterization of an anus dislocation, let it be one: so that the ring encloses the entire anus.
Et combure spissitudinem cutis totius.	 Burn the thickness of the skin all over.
Iste est modus cauterii in Sciatica, quando dolor est adhaerens anchae ipsi, et non extenditur usque ad coxam et crus.	 This is the method for cautery in sciatica, when the pain is adhering to the anus itself and does not extend to the hip and leg.
Si autem extenditur usque ad coxam et crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis super coxam, super locum ad quem innuit illic infirmus, in quo est dolor, et cauterio tuo super cauillam quatuor digitis ad partem syluestrem parumper: et sit cauterium cultellare.	 If it extends to the hip and leg, then cauterize it with two cauteries on the hip, at the place indicated by the patient where the pain is, and with your cautery four fingers' length towards the outer part: let the cautery be a knife-shaped one.
Et sit profunditas cauterii secundum profunditatem spissitudinis cutis.	 Let the depth of the cautery be according to the thickness of the skin.
Quod si infirmus innuit quod dolor extenditur usque prope digitos pedis, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic ubi innuit cum cauterio puncti, tribus, aut quatuor, aut pluribus, si indiget illo.	 If the patient indicates that the pain extends near the toes of the foot, then cauterize it there where the patient indicates with a cautery point, three, four or more if necessary.
Et si innuit dolorem esse sub genu uersus crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic cauterio uno cultellari.	 If he indicates that the pain is under the knee turned towards the leg, then cauterize it there with a knife-shaped cautery.
Et caue tibi in omni cauterizatione tua, ut non ultimes cum cauterio ad hoc ut comburas neruum, aut arteriam magnam, et attrahas per illud super infirmum nocumentum malum, aut contractionem.	 Be careful with all your cauteries that you do not burn a nerve or the major artery, and attract harm to the patient through it, or cause contracture.
Et ego quidem iam uidi unum et alium, ex eis qui cauterizauerunt supra cauillam, et ultimauerunt in cauterizatione, et inflatum est crus, donec tumor consecutus est pedem, et perforatus est totus, et corruptus est totus pes: deinde accidit solutio uentris, et mors post illud.	 I myself have already seen one and another of those who cauterized above the calf, and burnt in the cauterization, and the leg swelled up until it reached the foot, and was perforated completely, and the whole foot rotted: then there followed a rupture of the stomach, and death afterwards.
Quod si dolor est in duabus partibus simul, cauteriza utramque secundum hunc modum.	If pain is in two parts simultaneously, cauterize both according to this method.
Et sapientes quidam dixerunt in cauterizatione anchae, cuius cauterii iste est modus.	 And some wise men said in the cauterization of the anus, whose cauterization this is the method.
Fac simile samio ex ferro, cuius diametrus sit medietas palmi: et sit apud orificium suum secundum grossitudinem nuclei dactyli, aut minus parumper: et intra illud samium sit samium tertium.	 Make a similar object of iron, whose diameter is half the width of the palm; and it should be at its place according to the size of the knuckle, or slightly less; and within that small object, there should be another small object.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne samium per quantitatem nodi pollicis: et sint samia aperta a duabus partibus: et sit altitudo eorum quasi nodus, aut duo nodi: et fac eis manubrium ex ferro decenter aptatum in samiis.	 And there should be a space that is between every small object according to the size of a knuckle; and the small objects should be open on both sides; and their height should be like a knuckle, or two knuckles; and make handles of iron properly fitted in the small objects.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its shape.
Deinde igniatur in igne, donec rubeat, et proiiciat scintillas: deinde ponatur super pixidem anchae infirmo accubitato super latus sanum.	 Then it is heated in fire until it glows and sparks; then it should be placed on the cushion of the anus resting weakly on the healthy side.
Cauteriza ergo eum tribus cauteriis rotundis in uice una.	 Cauterize therefore with three round cauteries at once.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	 Then, let it be for three days.
Postea emplastra cum butyro: et dimitte uulnus apertum diebus multis.	 Then pack it with butter; and let the open wound remain for many days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with ointment until it heals.
Inquit Albucasis, hac specie cauterii o filii, parum usi sumus, propter terrorem aspectus eius: et propterea, quod paucos inuenimus qui expectent super ipsum.	 Albucasis says: in this way of cauterization, O sons, we have not been sufficiently accustomed to it due to the fear of its appearance; and for that reason, we find few who dare upon it.
Verumtamen est ex bonis cauteriis ei qui suffert, et inuenit cum eo locum eius.	 However, it is one of the good cauteries for him who can endure it, and it has a place in that condition.
Cauterium autem cum medicinis adurentibus est, ut tu facias duo samia habentia perforatam armillam, in quam descendit cardo portae eius ex aere, aut ferro, longitudo parietis: quorum in altitudinem eorum sint duo nodi, aut quasi ipsi.	 The cautery with stimulating medicines is to make two small objects having a perforated armillary sphere, into which descends the key of its door from brass or iron, the length of the wall; whose height should be two knuckles, or as if they themselves.
Et sit spacium quod est inter utraque quantitas grossitudinis digiti, et sint aperta inferius et superius: et sit quod contineant se adinuicem, secundum hanc formam.	 And let there be a space that is between each quantity of the finger's thickness, and let it be open below and above; and let it contain each other in this manner.
Deinde depone eam super pixidem anchae, infirmo iacente super latus sanum.	 Then place it on a boxwood plank, with the weak one lying on its healthy side.
Et comprime manum tuam super pixidem anchae multum.	 And press your hand on the boxwood plank strongly.
Deinde funde inter duos circulos ex aqua calida, quae sit calefacta cum igne parumper, et tene eam quantitate horae temporalis: et toleret infirmus mordicationem eius, et ipsius adustionem, nam ipse inuenit mordicationem sicut ignis, donec quiescat mordicatio.	 Then pour water into two circles between them which is heated slightly by fire, and hold it for the amount of an hour; let the weak one bear the bite of it, and its burning, for he himself has found that biting like fire until the biting stops.
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum instrumento, et absterge aquam calidam ab ancha tota cum aqua dulci: deinde dimitte illud tribus diebus.	 Then scrape your hand with a tool and remove warm water from the plank along with sweet water; then let it be for three days.
Et pone super illud butyrum, donec remoueatur nigredo adustionis: et dimitte illud diebus aliquot, et curret ex eo pus.	 And place butter on it until the blackness of the burning is removed; and let it be for some days, and pus will run out from it.
Est enim ultimum in iuuamento.	 For it is the ultimate treatment.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with ointments until it heals.
Quod si extendatur dolor usque ad coxam, aut crus: fac ei statuam in eo quod continet aquam, secundum quod fecisti in ancha aequaliter.	 If the pain extends to the hip or leg: make a setting for it in that which contains water, according to what you have made on the plank equally.
Et iste est modus aquae calidae: et ego iam scripsi eam in tractatu rectificationis medicinarum.	 And this is the method of hot water; and I have already written it in the treatment of rectifying remedies.
Sume alcali, et calcis non extinctae amborum ana partem unam: tere utraque, et pone ea in ollam nouam, cuius inferior pars sit perforata foramine uno paruo, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum radius: et pone sub fundo ollae ollam aliam uitreatam: et proiice super alcali et calcem ex aqua dulci, quod submergat utraque per digitum: post quam tu comprimas ea manu tua compressione bona: et dimite ollam, donec descendat aqua acuta inferiori parte ollae uitreatae.	 Take alkali and powdered unburnt lime, mix them in equal parts; grind each of them and put them into a new pot, the bottom of which is pierced with a small hole according to the size that the radius enters; and put another pot underneath it which is covered; throw over the alkali and lime from sweet water, so that each of them immerse by a finger depth; then press them with good pressure using your hand; and let the pot be until the acid water goes down in the bottom of the earthenware pot.
Deinde aggrega illam aquam totam, et proiice eam super aliam calcem: et cola, donec renouetur.	 Then gather all that water and pour it over another leg: and boil, until it returns.
Ipsa enim erit tunc fortis acuitatis ualde, quae administratur in multis operationibus medicinae, et in cauterizatione reliquorum membrorum.	 For indeed, it will then be very strong and sharp, which is given in many operations of medicine, and in the cauterization of other members.
Quoniam efficit operationem ignis ipsius.	 Because it effects the operation of fire itself.
Et ex medicinis sunt, cum quibus cauterizantur ancha, etiam sicut tesisie, et mel anacardi, et calx cum sapone, ita quod utraque sint permixta. ¶	 And among the medicines with which cauteries are made, such as alum and tesisie, and honey from the nut tree, and chalk with soap, so that each be mixed together. (¶ is a paragraph symbol)
Et Galenus quidem narrando retulit, cuiusdam uiri ex antiquis curationem, qua curatus est dolor anchae et uenae sciaticae: et magnificauit esse eius ualde.	 And Galen himself, in his narrative, reported a cure of a certain man from among the ancients, who was healed of pain in the anus and the sciatic vein: and he praised it very highly.
Et dixit, quia non indiguit alia curatione, et quia sanatus est ex uice una, donec retulit, quia ipse fortasse intrauit balneum delatus, et exiuit ex eo iam sanus.	 And he said that it did not require another cure, and because he was healed from a single application, until he reported that perhaps he himself entered the bath and came out of it already healed.
Et est, ut accipiatur ex seitaragi uiridi: et si non inuenitur uiride, sumatur siccum, recens: et teratur multum cum aliquanto adipe, et ponatur super ancham, ubi est dolor, aut crus, aut in coxa: et ligetur, et dimittatur quantitate trium horarum, aut per quantitatem quod sentiat infirmus sedationem adustionis.	 And it is to be taken from the green seed of seitaragus: and if green seed is not found, dry one should be taken, fresh: and grind it very much with a little fat, and place it on the anus, where there is pain, or leg, or in the hip: and tie it and let it stay for the quantity of three hours, or as much as it feels weak from the heat of the cauterization.
Deinde intromitte eum in balneum.	 Then introduce it into a bath.
Cum ergo roridum fit corpus eius, intromitte ipsum in solium.	 When his body becomes warm, introduce him into the sun.
Nam dolor recedit, et sanatur.	 For pain departs, and it heals.
Et scias, quia non oportet ut utatur aliquis cauterio cum istis medicinis, nisi post euacuationem corporis.	 And know that no one should use a cautery with these medicines unless after the evacuation of the body.
Et Dioscorides qui dem dixit, quod stercus caprarum, quando cum eo cauterizatur uena sciatica, confert ei: et fit cauterium secundum hunc modum.	 And Dioscorides, who said that the feces of goats, when it is cauterized with them on the sciatic vein, add it: and the cautery is made in this manner.
Sumatur lana, et imbibatur oleo antiquo, et ponatur super locum profundum, qui est inter pollicem pedis, et inter focile, et est propinquior focili.	 Take flax, and let it be soaked in ancient oil, and place it on a deep place which is between the toe of the foot and the heel, and closer to the heel.
Deinde accipe stercus caprarum siccum, et inflamma ipsum in igne, donec fiat carbo.	 Then take dry goat dung, and ignite it until it becomes charcoal.
Deinde pone ipsum super lanam, et dimitte ipsum, donec extinguatur.	 Then place it on the flax, and let it rest until it goes out.
Deinde itera illud.	 Repeat that procedure.
Non cesses ergo facere illud, usquequo perueniat sensus super mediatione usque ad ancham, et quiescat dolor.	 Do not cease to do that until sensation reaches the marrow, and the pain subsides.
Et iste modus cauterii nominatur cauterium Vaccinum.	 And this method of cauterization is called Vaccine cautery.
¶ De cauterizatione doloris Dorsi.	 Chapter on the Cauterization of Back Pain.
Caput XLIIII.	 Chapter XLIV.
Quandoque accidit dolor in Dorso ex caussis multis, aut a casu, aut a percussione, aut euacuatione superflua, et illis similibus, ex infusione materiei frigidae, et humidae: et cauterium quidem non cadit, nisi in hac specie sola, quae fit ex infusione materiei frigidae.	 Whenever there is pain in the back due to multiple causes, either from an accident, or a blow, or excessive evacuation, and similar things, due to the influx of cold and moist matter; and cauterization does not apply except in this single case which is made by the influx of cold matter.
Oportet ergo post euacuationem infirmi cum pillulis foetidis, et eis similibus, ut fiant super Dorsum, ubi est dolor, tres lineae secundum latitudinem almeidati ipsius, postquam signas cum encaustro in omni linea quinque cauteria, aut plura secundum quantitatem quae uenit ex tolerantia infirmi uirtute eius: et fiat cauterizatio cum cauteriopuncti.	 Therefore, after the evacuation of the sick with fetid pills and similar things, they should be placed on the back where there is pain, three lines wide according to the palm of the hand, after marking them with encaustic in every line of five cauteries or more according to the amount that comes from the strength of the patient; and the cauterization should be done with cauterion puncti.
Et si uis, cauteriza tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor, cum cauterio clauili mediali, secundum hanc formam.	 And if you wish, cauterize with three or four cauteries together with the middle clavile cautery, in this manner.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in incaeptine Gibbositatis.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing humpback deformity.
Caput XLV.	 Chapter XLV.
Multotiens accidit haec aegritudo infantibus paruis.	 This disease often occurs in young children.
Et signum incaeptionis eius in pueris est: quod accidit super eum strictura in anhelitu apud eleuationem, et motum: et inuenis in ultima spondilium Dorsi et nodorum eius, quod iam incaepit eminere super reliquos spondiles.	 The sign of the beginning of this deformity in children is that it happens above them when they breathe deeply during elevation and movement; and you find at the end of the vertebrae of the back and their knots, which has already begun to protrude above the other vertebrae.
Cum ergo uides illud, et uis facere illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio quod sit circulus secundum hanc formam.	 When you see that [thing], and wish to do it, then cauterize it with a cautery that is in the shape of a circle.
Et capiat cauterium super omnem partem spondilis aequaliter: et si uis cauteriza in circumitu spondilis cum cauterio puncti duas lineas, aut tres: et sint puncta propinqua adinuicem.	 Take the cautery over the whole mussel shell equally: and if you wish to cauterize around the mussel shell with a pointed cautery, take two or three lines, and let the points be close together.
Deinde cura locum, donec sanetur cum eo quod diximus.	 Then care for that place until it heals as we have said.
Et caue, ne administres cauterium in gibbositate, quae fit in spasmo nerui.	 Beware not to administer the cautery on a hump which is caused by a spasm of the nerve.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Podagra, et doloribus iuncturarum.	 On the method of cauterization for gout and joint pains.
Caput XLVI.	 Chapter XLVI.
Quando dolores iuncturarum sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, quae effunduntur ad cuiuslibet membra corporis, tunc quando accidunt dolores in pedibus, de consuetudine medicorum est, ut nominent illud Podagram proprie.	 When the pains of joints are caused by cold humidity that flows into any part of the body, then when pains occur in the feet, it is customary among physicians to call this gout properly.
Cum ergo curatur Podagra frigidae caussae cum modis curationis, et non remouentur dolores, tune cauterium remouet eos.	 When gout caused by cold is treated with methods of treatment and the pains are not removed, then cautery removes them.
Et est, ut cauterizes eum post euacuationem in circumitu iuncturae pedum, cauteriis multis: et sit cauterium Oliuare.	 And it is that you should cauterize [the affected area] after evacuation around the joint of the foot with many cauteries, and let the cautery be Olivary.
Cuius haec est forma.	 This is its shape. (Referring to the Olivary cautery)
Et si indiges ut punctes super faciem pedis, tunc fac cum cauterio puncti.	 And if you need points on the sole of the foot, then do it with a pointed cautery.
Quod si ascendunt dolores usque ad genua, aut reliquas iuncturas, et multotiens accidit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super omne genu tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor ab omni parte, cum hoc eodem cauterio Clauili.	 If the pains ascend to the knees or other joints, and this often happens, then cauterize it on the entire knee with three or four cauteries from all sides, with this same cautery of Clavius.
Si autem necessaria sunt tibi plura hoc cauterio, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	 But if you require more of this cautery, then cauterize it.
Et non submergas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit circiter spissitudinem cutis tantum.	 And do not immerse your hand with the cautery, rather let it be about the thickness of the skin.
Si autem ascendunt dolores ad genua, et dorsum: tunc administra quod diximus ex cauterio in capitulo suo.	 If the pains ascend to the knees and back, then administer what was said in its own chapter.
Quod si dolores sunt in manibus tantum, tunc puncta in circumitu focilium, sicut reuoluuntur duae lineae.	 If the pains are only in the hands, then make incisions around the joints of the fingers, as two lines are rolled up.
Si autem remanet ex doloribus in digitis, tunc puncta eos, super omnem nodum punctum, et super pectinem manus.	 If pain persists in the fingers, then pierce them all over every knot and on the back of the hand.
Si autem ascendunt dolores post dies ad cubitos, aut ad humeros, tunc cauteriza utrosque ab omni parte.	 If pains rise after days to the elbows or shoulders, then cauterize both from all sides.
Et non euacues infirmum ex regimine bono, ex recaeptione medicinarum.	 And do not evacuate a sick person by good regimen or by taking medicine.
Nam si bonum fiat regimen, et euacuetur phlegma, sanabitur auxilio Dei cum isto cauterio.	 For if the regimen is good and phlegm is evacuated, it will be healed with this cautery aid from God.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Rupturis.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing ruptures.
Caput XLVII.	 Chapter 47.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, et descendit intestinum, aut zirbum ad testiculum, et est illud incipiens propinquum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo dimittere comestionem in die suo.	 If there is a rupture in the groins and the intestine or spermatic cord descends towards the testicle, which is beginning to appear nearby: then it is necessary to order the sick person to fast on his own day.
Et utatur ex lenientibus, quo descendat stercus a uentre suo.	 And let him use the laxatives so that feces will descend from his belly.
Deinde sedeat inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et praecipe ei, ut teneat anhelitum suum, donec egrediatur, uel appareat zirbum, aut intestinum.	 Then let him sit on your hands upon his back: and command him to hold his breath until it comes out or appears pus or intestine.
Deinde reduc ipsum digitis tuis, et signa cum encaustro sub Ruptura super os pectinis, cum signo cuius extremitas sit similis medietati circuli ad superiora corporis.	 Then put your fingers on him and sign with wax under the wound on his neck, with a mark whose end resembles half of a circle towards the upper part of the body.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma, donec ueniat album, et proiiciat seintillas.	 Then heat the cautery, which has this shape, until it turns white, and throw sparks at it.
Deinde reduc intestinum, aut zirbum ad concauitatem suam.	 Then pull the intestine or pus into its hollow.
Deinde ponat minister manum suam super locum, ut non exeat intestinum: et tu iam aperuisti inter crura infirmi, et posuisti sub eo puluinar, et seruiens alius super crura eius, et alius super pectus eius qui tenet manus.	 Then let the servant place his hand on the spot to keep the intestine from coming out: and you have already opened between the legs of the sick man, and placed a pan under him, and one servant is serving at his legs, and another at his chest who holds his hands.
Deinde depone cauterium super ipsum signum, manu tua cum cauterio stante recta.	 Then place the cautery on the mark, with your hand holding the cautery upright.
Et tene ipsum, donec cum eo consequaris os: aut itera cum eo uice alia, si non consecutus fueris cum eo in prima usque ad os.	 Hold him until you follow the bone with it: or hold him again with another instrument, if you do not reach the bone with it in the first attempt.
Et prudenter obserua ab exitu intestini in hora cauterizationis tuae, ne comburas ipsum, et eueniat per illud super infirmum aut mors, aut malicia magna.	 And observe carefully that the intestine does not come out during your cautery work, lest you burn him and something happens to the sick person or great harm.
Et scias, quod quando tu non consequeris cum cauterio os, non confert operatio tua.	 And know that when you do not reach the bone with the cautery, your operation is of no use.
Et oportet ut sit cauterium infantium subtile, secundum mensuram eorum.	 The cautery for children must be delicate, according to their measure.
Deinde cura cum reliquis unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then treat with ointments, until he is healed.
Et sit infirmus iacens super dorsum suum quadraginta diebus, donec sigilletur uulnus.	 The sick man should lie on his back for forty days, until the wound is healed.
Et oportet, ut ponas nutrimentum eius longitudine temporis curationis eius, quod leniat uentrem eius: ut non exeat intestinum apud conamen et egestionem.	 It is necessary to put food for him according to the length of his healing time, so that his stomach is softened and nothing comes out from it during the operation or evacuation.
Deinde quando uult surgere post quadraginta dies, tunc administra ligamentum decenter factum, et teneat ipsum quadraginta diebus aliis.	 Then when he wants to get up after forty days, then administer a properly made ligament and hold him for another forty days.
Et minoretur a labore, et repletione cibi et potus, et uocibus uehementibus.	 And it should be diminished by labor, and filled with food and drink, and vehement voices.
Nam quando utitur hoc regimine, ita sanatur sanatione integra.	 When using this regimen, healing occurs in its entirety.
Et ego dicam curationem Rupturarum cum incisione in capitulo suo.	 I will say the cure of ruptures with incision in its chapter.
Quando autem Rupturae accidunt in reliquo uentre, et sunt incipientes, et uis ut non addantur, tunc cauteriza Rupturam eius cauterio rotundo secundum quantitatem eius: et sit illud quod aduritur ex tunc sicut tertia eius.	 But when ruptures occur in the remaining abdomen and are new, and the force is not added, then cauterize the rupture with a round cautery according to its size: and that which is burned should be as the third part of it from then on.
Deinde cura ipsum, cum eo quod diximus: et non addetur.	 Then cure itself, when I said so: do not add anything.
Et iam dixerunt quidam primi: ut cauterizetur Ruptura cum cauterio triangulato, secundum hanc formam.	 And it was said by some first ones: to cauterize the rupture with a triangular cautery according to this shape.
Postquam signatur cum encaustro, et ponitur linea quae est per latitudinem in latere superiori Rupturae, et linea altera ad inferius.	 After it is signed with pitch and a line is placed that is across the width on the upper side of the rupture, and another line downwards.
Et depone manum tuam in medio cum cauterio clauili.	 And place your hand in the middle with the nail-cautery.
Sed cauterium primum est facilius et melius.	 But the first cautery is easier and better.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in doloribus propter casum, aut percussionem.	 Chapter on the manner of cauterizing in pains caused by fall or blow.
Caput XLVIII.	 Chapter XLVIII.
Quando accidit in quibusdam membris a casu, aut percussione dolor: et perseuerat ille dolor tempore longo, et non confert in eo curatio cum medicinis: tunc oportet ut cauterizetur cum cauterio Puncti.	 When it happens in certain limbs due to a fall or blow and the pain persists for a long time, and no cure occurs with medicines: then it is necessary that it should be cauterized with the puncture cautery.
Et sit cauterium omnis membri cauterium secundum magnitudinem eius, et ipsius paruitatem, et debilitatem eius, et ipsius uirtutem, et locationem torsionis, et doloris ex eo.	 And let the cautery be for all members according to its size and its weakness, and its power, and the looseness of the torsion, and the pain from it.
Si ergo sanatur ex cauterio primo, est bene.	 If it is cured by the first cautery, it is good.
Si non: tunc itera super ipsum cauterium.	 If not: then apply another cautery on top of it.
Quoniam de consuetudine horum dolorum est, ut permutentur ex membro ad illud quod appropinquat ei.	 Because it is the custom of these pains that they are changed from one member to another nearby.
Quare oportet ut consequaris eos cum cauterio, donec sanetur infirmus.	 Therefore it is necessary that you follow them with a cautery until the sick one is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Lepra.	 On the method of cauterizing in Leprosy.
Caput XLIX.	 Chapter XLIX.
Leprosi autem quandoque iuuantur cauterio iuuamento maximo.	 Lepers are sometimes greatly benefited by cautery.
Et praecipue species Leprae, quae fit propter putrefactionem phlegmatis et melancholiae: cum ergo uis cauterizare ipsam considera.	 And especially the type of leprosy that is caused by decomposition of phlegm and black bile; therefore consider cauterizing it.
Si ergo Lepra est ineipiciens, et curasti eam cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non descendit, neque stat: et times super infirmum, quod comprehendat corruptio super totam complexionem eius: tunc cauteriza eum super caput quinque cauteriis: uno in medio capitis noto, et secundo inferius eo uersus frontem apud finem capillorum, et duobus super duo cornua, et uno posterius super nucea ceruicis.	 If the leprosy is beginning and you have treated it as we said in the division, and it does not subside or stabilize; and you fear that corruption will spread over his entire complexion: then cauterize him on the head with five cauteries: one in the middle of the head, known as the fontanelle, and the second lower towards the forehead at the end of the hairline, and two above the two horns, and one behind on the nape of the neck.
Et ultima manum tuam cum cauterio parumper, donec imprimat in os impressionem paruam, et dislocentur ex eo cortices: ut alleuietur expiratio uaporum grossorum ex eo, et cauteriza cauterio etiam super ipsum splenem, secundum quod praecessit.	 And finally press your hand with the cautery slightly until it makes a smaller impression on the bone, and the cortexes separate from it; in order to alleviate the expiration of gross vapors from it, and cauterize with the cautery also over the spleen, according to what has preceded.
Sin autem Lepra iam sparsa est super infirmum, et apparet manifeste: tunc oportet ut cauterizes cum istis cauteriis, quae diximus in capite, et cauterio super extremitatem nasi, et duobus cauteriis super duas maxillas, et duobus cauteriis super spondiles colli, et sex super spondiles dorsi, et uno magno super alhahosos apud gran caudae et uno supra ipsum, in ipso almeidati: et duobus super anchas: scilicet super omnem ancham uno, et duobus super genua: uno super omne genu, et duobus super humeros, et duobus super cubitos, et duobus super teneritudines pectoris sui: et cauteriza ipsum super omnem iuncturam, ex iuncturis digitorum manuum suarum, et pedum suorum: et cauteriza super omnem calcaneum pedum suorum, et focilia manuum suarum.	 But if the leprosy is already spread over the sick person, and it appears clearly: then it is necessary that you cauterize with these cauteries which we said in the head, and with a cautery over the extremity of the nose, and with two cauteries over the cheeks, and with two cauteries over the spondyles of the neck, and six over the spondyles of the back, and one large over the alhahosos at the base of the tail and one on it, in the almeidat: and two over the ankles; namely over all the ankle with one, and two over the knees, and two over the elbows, and two over the wrists, and two over the softnesses of his chest: and cauterize him over all the joints, from the joints of his fingers of his hands to his feet: and cauterize over all the calcanei of his feet, and the follia of his hands.
Et caue tibi a neruis qui sunt super postremum calcanei, ut non comburas eos.	 Beware lest you burn the nerves that are above the last calcaneus.
Et quandoque cauterizatur cauterio super os pectinis, et alio super os stomachi, et alio super epar.	 And sometimes cauterized by a cautery on the ear lobe, and another on the belly of the stomach, and another on the epigastrium.
Et scias, quod quanto plus addis cauterium, est magis iuuamentum, et magis conferens.	 Know that the more you apply the cautery, the more it is helpful, and the more it conforms.
Et scias, quod infirmus non inuenit in cauterio dolorem, sicut inueniunt ipsum sani: propterea, quod corpus eius iam stupefactum est.	 Know that the sick do not find pain in the cautery as the healthy do; therefore because his body is already stunned.
Et oportet ut sint cauteria ex magnitudine, et paruitate secundum membra et iuncturas: secundum quod praecessit ex speciebus ferramentorum.	 It is necessary that the cauteries should be of size and weight according to the members and joints; according to the kinds of tools that preceded them.
Deinde cura cauterium ex farina herbi cum melle, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then care for the cautery with flour of herbs and honey, and the rest of the treatment, until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Stupore.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing in stupor.
Caput L.	 Chapter L.
Quando stupet aliquod membrum, et curatur cum medicinis, et oleis, et emplastris, et non sanatur, tunc cauteriza ipsum membrum stupefactum cauteriis, secundum quod meretur magnitudo membri, aut paruitas eius.	 When a limb is numbed and treated with medicines, oils, plasters, but does not heal, then cauterize the numbed limb with cauteries, according to the size of the limb or its smallness.
Et sit cauterium tuum intrans in spissitudinem cutis parumper.	 Let your cautery penetrate slightly into the skin's thickness.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then treat it with an ointment until it heals.
Et quandoque cauterizatur ad quiddam stuporis, qui accidit manui, et pedi, in spondilibus dorsi apud exitum neruorum, qui mouent illud membrum: et remouetur stupor.	 And sometimes when cauterization is performed for numbness that occurs in the hand and foot, in the joints of the back at the exits of nerves that move that limb: the numbness is removed.
Verum non praesumat super illud, nisi qui est sapiens in anatomia membrorum, et egressione neruorum mouentium corpus.	 But let him not presume to do this, unless he is wise in the anatomy of limbs and the exit of nerves moving the body.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Albaras.	 Chapter on Cauterization in Albaraz.
Caput LI.	 Title LXI.
Quando antiquatur Albaras, et non confert in eo aliquid ex ingeniis medicinae: tunc cauteriza super ipsam cauterio profundo parumper, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis, donec remoueatur albedo, et mutetur color eius.	 When Albaraz (a type of ulcer or lesion) hardens and does not yield to any medicine: then cauterize it deeply with a cautery, according to the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness is removed and the color changes.
Deinde cura ipsum cum farina herbi, et lentis cum oleo rosa, et foliis arnoglossae, et sanguine columbae, et sanguine hyrundinis: de unoquoque sit pars una: misceantur haec omnia, et liniantur super pannum, et adhaereant loco, donec sanetur.	 Then treat it with a mixture of grain from herbs and lentils with rose oil, arnoglossus leaves, dove blood, and frog blood: each ingredient in equal parts: mix all these together, soak them on a cloth, and apply them to the place until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Cancro.	 Chapter on Cauterization in Cancer.
Caput LII.	 Title LXII.
Quando Cancer est incipiens, et uis ipsum sistere: tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio circuli in circuitu eius, sicuti reuoluitur.	 When a cancer is beginning and you wish to stop it: then cauterize it with a circular cautery around its circumference, as it is usually done.
Sapientes autem dixerunt, ut cauterizetur cauterio ultimo in medio.	 The wise ones said that it should be cauterized with the last cautery in the middle.
Mihi autem non uidetur illud: quoniam timeo quod ulceretur: et ego iam uidi illud aliquotiens.	 It does not seem good to me (that is, to cauterize in the middle): I fear that it would ulcerate; and I have already seen this happen many times.
Et rectius est, ut cauterizetur in circumitu eius cum circulo, sicut diximus: aut cauteriis multis.	 It is better to cauterize around its circumference with a circle, as we said; or with several cauteries.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Adubelati.	 Chapter on the manner of cauterization in Adubelati.
Caput LIII.	 Chapter LIII.
Quando aliquis habet Adubelati, et tardatur in maturatione, aut propter superfluitatem facientem eam, aut propter aetatem infirmi, quando est decrepitus pauci sanguinis, aut propter tempus, et uis festinare in maturatione Adubelati, tunc cauteriza in circumitu eius cum cauteriis paruis multis punctando.	 Chapter LIII. When someone has an Adubelati (a kind of tumor) that is slow in maturation, or because it is caused by excess, or because the person is old and weak, or because of time, and wishes to hasten the maturation of the Adubelati, then cauterize around its circumference with several small cauteries, puncturing it.
Deinde dimitte eam.	 Then let it be.
Nam ipsa festinabit cum maturatione.	 For it will hasten with the maturation itself.
Si autem uis perforationem eius cum cauterio, tunc igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma.	 If you wish to perforate it (the tumor) with a cautery, then heat the cautery with fire, and this is its shape.
Et depone ipsum in medio Adubelati, donec penetret cutem: et sit cauterium ab eo quod sequitur infirmus, ut alleuietur cursus puris.	 And place it in the middle of the Adubelati until it penetrates the skin; and let the cautery be weak, so that its course may be alleviated with purifying.
Deinde cura ipsum donec sanetur.	 Then care for it until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in malo corrodente.	 Chapter on the manner of cauterization in a rotting tumor.
Caput LIIII.	 Chapter LIIII.
Corrodens non est nisi corruptio in membro ambulans, et corrodit ipsum: sicut ignis comedit ligna sicca.	 Corrosion is not but corruption walking in a limb and consuming it; just as fire eats dry wood.
Si ergo uides corrodentem in loco qui toleret cauterium cum igne, tunc igni cauteria multa, clauilia parua et magna, secundum quod conueniet illi loco in quo est corrodens.	 If you see corrosion in a place that can bear cautery with fire, then apply much cautery, small and large clamps according to what is appropriate for the place where there is corrosion.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum ab omni parte donec eradices corruptionem totam, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid penitus.	 Then cauterize it from all sides until you root out the entire corruption, and nothing of it remains deep within.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super loca cauterizata sulphur tritum cum oleo, donec eradicentur escharae omnes, et omnis corruptio.	 Then let it be for three days, and put on the cauterized places ground sulfur with oil until all scabs are removed and all corruption is completely gone.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis generantibus carnem.	 Then treat it with ointments that stimulate flesh growth.
Si ergo uides, quod post tres dies caro nascitur natiuitate sana, in qua non est corruptio, est bonum.	 If you see after three days that flesh is growing in a healthy manner without corruption, it is good.
Et si non: tunc itera cauterium super illud quod remansit ex locis corruptis.	 And if not: then repeat the cautery on what remains from the corrupted places.
Et corrodens medicatur quandoque cum medicina acuta.	 And corrosion is treated sometimes with strong medicine.
Ipsa namque surgit loco cauterii.	 But it arises in place of cautery itself.
Verumtamen cauterium cum igne est uelocioris iuuamenti: et ego quidem iam dixi cauterizationem eius cum medicina acuta in diuisione: accipe ergo eam illic quando ea indiges.	 Nevertheless, cautery with fire is quicker help; and I have already said that cauterization of it with strong medicine is used in division; therefore take it there when you need it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Clauis, et Verucis.	 [Section title] On Cauterizing in Nails and Warts.
Caput LV.	 Chapter 50.
Multotiens accidit in inferioribus partibus pedum haec aegritudo: et est res grossa, filtrata, quae laedit pedem.	 Often occurs in the lower parts of the feet this disease: and it is a large, filtered substance that harms the foot.
Et cauterium quidem in eis est secundum duos modos: cauterium cum igne, et cauterium cum aqua calida.	 And there is indeed cautionery for them according to two modes: cauterization with fire, and cauterization with hot water.
Quantum autem cum igne est, ut ignias cauterium concauum simile pennae uulturis: quod fiat ex ferro, secundum quantitatem quod contineat clauum ab omni parte: et sit subtilium marginum.	 As for the cauterization with fire, it should be done as follows: make a hollowed-out cautery similar to the beak of a vulture from iron, according to its size so that it contains a nail from all sides; and let it have sharp edges.
Deinde depone ipsum ignitum super clauum.	 Then place the heated one on the nail.
Deinde reuolue manum cum cauterio in circumitu claui, donec perueniat cauterium ad profunditatem claui: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, donec incipiat emittere pus.	 Then rotate the hand with the cautery around the nail until the cautery reaches the depth of the nail; and leave it for three days until it begins to discharge pus.
Deinde emplastra ipsum cum maluis syluestribus, contritis cum sale: et dimitte emplastrum super ipsum in nocte.	 Then apply ointments of forest malva crushed with salt; and leave the ointment on it at night.
Ipse enim eradicabitur ex radicibus suis.	 For it will be rooted out from its roots.
Deinde cura locum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	 Then care for the place with a salve made of fresh flesh until it heals.
Quod si sunt non conuersi, et multotiens accidunt in superficie corporis, praecipue in manibus et pedibus: tunc administres in eis cauterium cum aqua calida: et est, ut accipias cannulam ex aere, aut ferro, aut ex penna uulturis: et depone eam super clauum, aut althelul.	 If they have not been converted [changed?], and often occur on the surface of the body, especially in the hands and feet: then administer cauterization with hot water; and it is, that you take a tube made from copper or iron or from the beak of a vulture; and place it on the nail or on the cuticle.
Deinde proiice in cannulam ex aqua calida quantitatem paucam: retine manum tuam, et tu reuolue eam cum compressione manus tuae parumper, ut imprimatur margo cannulae in radice claui, et inueniat aqua calida uiam ad profundum, ad radicem claui: et expectet infirmus parumper super mordicationem aquae calidae hora una.	 Then pour a small amount of hot water into the tube; hold your hand and rotate it slightly so that the tip of the tube presses on the root of the nail, and let the hot water find its way to the depth, to the root of the nail; and let the patient wait for a while under the pressure of the hot water for about an hour.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, nam clauus eradicatur cum radicibus suis.	 Then release it, for the nail will be rooted out along with its roots.
Ita fac cum eis uno post unum, donec uenias super omnes qui ex eis sunt in corpore.	 Follow it thus one after another, until you reach upon all who are from them in the body.
Deinde cura eos postquam eradicantur, cum eo quod generat carnem ex unguentis.	 Then care for them when they are eradicated, with that which generates flesh from unguents.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tremore.	 On the method of cauterizing in tremor.
Caput LVI.	 Chapter LVI.
Quando accidit alicui Tremor ex frigore in neruo, aut ex febre quartana, aut alio: tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis, aut quinque super spondiles dorsi, et inter omnem spondilem cauterio, et in pectore eius cauterio, et super stomachum eius cauterio.	 When trembling occurs to someone due to cold in a nerve, or quartan fever, or another reason: then it is necessary that you cauterize it with four cauteries, or five on the back of a dorsal spondyle, and between every spondyle with a cautery, and in its chest with a cautery, and above its stomach with a cautery.
Tremor enim quiescit cum cauterio oliuari, et festinat sanitas aegritudinis frigidae.	 For trembling quiets down when cauterized with oil, and hastens the health of cold illness.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Albathir.	 On the method of cauterizing albathir.
Caput LVII.	 Chapter LVII.
Quandoque expelluntur in corpore Albathir foedae, id est, pustulae, quae fiunt a materiis grossis corruptis.	 Sometimes, in the body, albathirs (abscesses) that are foul, i.e., pustules, which are produced by corrupted matter, are expelled.
Oportet ergo in primis cum apparent, ut cauterizentur super omne caput pustulae cauterio subtili cum ligno myrti, cuius extremitas accensa est cum igne.	 Therefore, when they appear first, it is necessary to cauterize on every head of the pustule with a subtle cautery and with myrtle wood whose end is set alight with fire.
Aut cum radice aristolochiae longae.	 Or with the root of aristolochia (long).
Aut cum cauterio lenticulari.	 Or with a lenticular cautery.
Et quandoque cauterizantur ademenul, in principio expulsionis suae secundum hunc modum: et non augentur: et disrumpitur superfluitas faciens eos, et sanatur ex eis.	 And sometimes cauteries are applied to adomenes (the abdomen) at the beginning of its expulsion according to this method; and they do not increase; and excess is broken, making them, and healed from them.
Verumtamen oportet ut fiat illud post euacuationem cum phlebotomia.	 Nevertheless, it must be done after evacuation with phlebotomy (bloodletting).
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fluxu sanguins ex arteria in uulnere.	 On the method of cauterizing during blood flow from an artery in a wound.
Caput LVIII.	 Chapter LVIII.
Multotiens accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, quae incisa est apud uulnus, quod accidit extrinsecus, aut apud incisionem apostematis, aut cauterium membri, et similia eis: et fit difficile abscindere eum.	 Multiple times occurs the flow of blood from an artery, which is cut near a wound, this happens externally, or at the incision of an abscess, or cauterization of a member, and similar to these: and it becomes difficult to separate it.
Cum ergo accidit alicui illud, tunc propera cum manu tua ad orificium arteriae, et pone super ipsum digitum tuum indicem: et stringe eum multum, donec obsessus sit sanguis sub digito tuo, et non egrediatur ex eo aliquid.	 When this happens to anyone, then immediately place your finger on the orifice of the artery, and press hard upon it; so that the blood is held under your finger, and nothing comes out from there.
Deinde pone in ignem cauteria oliuaria parua, et magna numero plura: et suffla super ea, donec fiant ignita ualde.	 Then place a small oil lamp cautery on the fire, and many of them, in large number; and blow upon them until they are very hot.
Deinde accipe ex eis unum, aut paruum, aut magnum, secundum uulnus et locum, in quo disrupta est arteria, et depone cauterium super ipsam uenam, post quam tu remoues digitum tuum festinanter: et tene cauterium, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 Then take one of them, small or large, according to the wound and place where the artery is broken; and place the cautery on the vein, after you remove your finger quickly; hold the cautery until the blood separates.
Quod si expellatur cum eleuas digitum ab orificio arteriae, et extinguis cauterium, tunc accipe cauterium aliud festinanter, ex cauteriis quae in igne sunt praeparata.	 If the blood is forced out when you remove your finger from the orifice of the artery, and extinguish the cautery, then immediately take another cautery, from those which are prepared in the fire.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum uno post aliud, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 Therefore do not cease to perform this with one after another until the blood separates.
Et caue, ne comburas neruum qui est illic, et accidat super infirmum malicia alia.	 And beware, lest you burn the nerve which is there, and some other evil befall the weak man.
Et scias, quod quando ex arteria fluit sanguis, tunc non est possibile abscindere ipsum: praecipue quaudo arteria est magna, nisi cum uno quatuor modorum.	 And know that when blood flows from the artery, then it is not possible to separate it; especially because the artery is large, unless with one of four methods.
Aut cum cauterio, sicut diximus.	 Or with a cautery, as we have said.
Aut cum extractione, quando non est extracta.	 Or with extraction, when it has not been extracted.
Nam quando extrahitur, contrahuntur extremitates eius, et abscinditur sanguis.	 For when it is pulled out, its extremities contract and the blood separates.
Aut ligetur cum filo ligatione forti.	 Or it is tied with a strong thread.
Aut ponantur super ipsum medicinae de proprietate, quarum est abscindere sanguinem, et stringatur cum puluinari constrictione decenti.	 Or medicines are placed upon it, which have the property to separate blood; and it is pressed with a suitable tourniquet.
Qui autem administrat abscisionem eius cum ligamento, et strictura cum panno, aut positione rerum comburentium, et similium, non confert ei penitus, nisi raro.	 Whoever administers amputation with a ligature, and constriction with cloth, or placement of burning things, and similar [procedures], does not fully heal it, except rarely.
Si autem accidat alicui illud, et non sit ei praesens medicus, neque medicina: tunc incipiat cum positione digiti indicis super orificium uenae ipsius, sicut narrauimus, et constrictione eius ualde, donec obsessus sit sanguis a superiori parte uulneris, et super arteriam.	 If it happens to someone and the doctor is not present nor medicine available: then let him begin with the positioning of the index finger over the opening of the vein itself, as we have said, and its tightening very much, until the blood is blocked from above the wound, and on the artery.
Et digitus non remoueatur, desuper ipsum cum aqua frigida uehementis frigoris semper, donec congeletur sanguis, et ingrossetur, et abscindatur.	 And the finger shall not be removed, above it with cold water of violent cold always, until the blood freezes, thickens, and is cut off.
Et interim consideret in eo, quid indiget ex cauterio, aut ex medicina.	 And meanwhile let him consider in that, what needs cautery, or medicine.
¶ Partis Primae Finis.	 § Part One Conclusion.
Liber Chirurgici Albucasis Pars II.	 Book of Surgery by Albucasis, Part II.
¶ De Incisione, Perforatione, et Phlebotomia in uulneribus, et his similibus.	 § On incision, perforation, and phlebotomy in wounds, and similar [issues].
Iam Diximus in Capitulo Primo, omnem aegritudinem in qua conueniens est cum igne cauterium et medicina comburente, et occasiones eius, ipsius caussas, et instrumenta eius, et formas cauteriorum.	 We have said in Chapter One, every sickness in which burning with fire is suitable and medicine burns, and the occasions of it, causes, instruments, and forms of cauterization.
Et posui illic capitula a uertice usque ad pedem.	 And I set forth chapters from the neck to the feet.
Et ego procedam in hoc capitulo illa eadem uia: ut alleuietur super quaerentem quaesitum eius.	 And I will proceed in this chapter by the same path, so that he who seeks finds the sought for [information].
Et antequam incipiam illud, oportet ut addiscatis o filii, quod in hoc capitulo est ex terrore illud quod est in capitulo primo de cauterizatione.	 And before I begin that, it is necessary for you sons to learn what is found in this chapter on account of the fear which was mentioned in Chapter One on cauterization.
Et propter illud oportet, ut sit cautela in eo uehementior, quoniam in operatione quae est in hoc capitulo, multotiens cadit euacuatio cum sanguine, cum quo stat uita apud apertionem uenae, aut incisionem super apostema, aut apertionem exiturae, aut curationem uulneris, aut extractionem sagittae, aut incisionem super lapidem, et illis similia: ex quibus omnibus associatur tremor, et timor, et cadit in pluribus eorum mors.	 And for this reason, caution must be greater, because in the operation which is in this chapter, evacuation with blood often occurs, with which life remains open at the opening of the vein, or incision over an abscess, or the opening of drainage, or treatment of a wound, or extraction of arrows, or incision over a stone, and similar [issues]: from all of these the tremor and fear occur, and death occurs in many of them.
Et ego moneo uos, ne cadat super uos illud in quo est haesitatio, nam quandoque cadunt ad uos in hac arte modi hominum cum modis infirmitatum.	 And I warn you not to let it fall upon you where there is hesitation, for sometimes in this art modes of humans fall upon you with the modes of weaknesses.
Ex eis enim est qui irascitur cum aegritudine sua, et est leuis apud eum mors: propter uehementiam eius quod inuenit ex infirmitate sua et longitudine eius maliciei.	 For there is one who gets angry with his illness and death is easy for him; because of the vehemence he finds from his weakness and the length of his wickedness.
Et cum aegritudine est ex timore quod significat mortem.	 And when an illness is from fear, it signifies death.
Et ex eis est, qui dat tibicensum suum, et ditat te cum eo, sperans sanitatem, et aegritudo eius est perniciosa.	 And there is one who gives you a pledge and promises to heal you, hoping for health, but his illness is destructive.
Non ergo oportet ut consentiatis ei qui uenit ad uos ex eis, cuius modus est talis.	 Therefore, it is not proper that you agree with him who comes to you whose mode is such.
Et sit cautela uestra uehementior, quam cupiditas et uestra rapacitas.	 Let your caution be greater than your greed and your avarice.
Et non praesumatis super aliquid ex illo, nisi post scientiam certam, quae uerificat apud uos illud ad quod peruenit successio laudabilis.	 And do not presume about anything from it, unless after certain knowledge, which has been proven to be a praiseworthy sequence in your case.
Et utimini in curatione omnium infirmorum uestrorum, prognosticatione et indicatione de eo ad quod conuenienter sit salus.	 And use in the cure of all your sick, by prognosis and indication about what is fittingly healthy for them.
In illo namque est uobis adiutorium super acquisitionem famae et gloriae, et memoriae et laudis.	 For there is help for you in it regarding the acquisition of fame and glory, memory and praise.
Inspiret uobis Deus o filii, intellectum suum, et non auferat uobis directionem et inspirationem: quoniam illud est in manu eius.	 May God inspire you, O sons, His understanding, and not take away from you guidance and inspiration; for it is in His hand.
Et ego quidem ordinaui hoc Capitulum distinguendo per capitula, secundum quod praecessit in capitulo Cauterii, a ceruice usque ad pedes: ut alleuietur uobis quaesitum quod uultis ex eo, et quo indigetis.	 And I myself have arranged this chapter by dividing it into sections, according to what preceded in the chapter of Cauterii, from the neck to the feet; so that you may be relieved of what you seek from it and what you need.
¶ De curatione Aquae quae aggregatur in capitibus puerorum.	 Chapter on the treatment of water accumulating in children's heads.
Caput I.	 Chapter 1:
Scias, quod haec infirmitas multotiens accidit pueris apud partum: aut quando stringit obstetrix caput pueri absque leuitate.	 Know that this weakness often occurs in children at birth or when the midwife squeezes the child's head without ease.
Et quandeque accidit etiam ex caussa occulta quae non scitur.	 Sometimes it also occurs due to hidden causes which are not known.
Et ego quidem non uidi hanc aegritudinem in aliis quam in pueris: et ad omnem quem ex eis uidi properauit mors: propter illud ergo uisum est mihi dimittere operationem in ea.	 I myself have never seen this sickness in any but children, and death followed all whom I saw of them; for that reason it seemed to me that the operation should be abandoned in such a case.
Et ego quidem uidi ex eis puerum, cuius caput impletum erat aqua, et caput magnificabatur in omni die, donec non poterat sedere super seipsum, propter magnitudinem capitis sui: et humiditas augmentata fuit, donec mortuus est.	 I myself have seen a child whose head was full of water and whose head swelled every day until he could not sit up himself, because of the size of his head; and the moisture increased until he died.
Et haec quidem humiditas, aut aggregatur inter cutem et os: aut aggregatur sub osse super sifac.	 This moisture, it accumulates between skin and bone or it accumulates under the bone above the forehead.
Et operatio in illo, si est humiditas inter cutem et os, et apostema est paruum, tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis fissura una in latitudine: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo nodi, donec currat humiditas.	 And the operation in that case, if there is moisture between skin and bone and the abscess is small, then a slit should be made in the middle of the head, one fissure wide enough, its length like two knuckles, until the moisture runs out.
Et haec est forma spatumilis.	 And this is a form of trepanation (spatulum).
Si ergo humiditas est magis augmentata, et apostema est maius, tunc pone eas duas fissuras, secundum formam hanc.	 If the moisture is more increased and the abscess is larger, then make these two slits according to this form.
Et si humiditas est sub osse, et signum eius est, quod uides commissuras capitis apertas ab omni parte: et aqua deprimitur quando comprimis eam manu tua ad interiora, et non occultatur tibi illud: tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis tribus fissuris, secundum hunc modum.	 If the moisture is under the bone and there is a sign that you see that the skull openings are wide open from all sides; and water sinks when you press it with your hand towards the inside, and it is not hidden from you, then make three slits in the middle of the head according to this method.
Et post incisionem extrahe humiditatem totam.	 And after the incision, extract all the moisture.
Deinde stringe fissuras cum pannis et puluillis.	 Then suture the slits with bandages and lint.
Deinde embroca illud desuper cum uino et oleo usque ad diem quintum.	 Then apply oil and wine to it until the fifth day.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et cura uulnus cum tentis, et unguentis.	 Then loosen the sutures, take care of the wound with ointments and salves.
Et non dimittas stringere caput cum aequalitate.	 Do not omit to tie the head with equality.
Et ciba infirmum omni cibo sicco paucae humiditatis, usquequo confortetur membrum, et sanetur.	 Feed the ill man with dry food of little moisture until he is strengthened and cured.
Et modus alius incisionis est, ut consideres ubi apparet magnitudo apostematis, et collectio aquae.	 Another method of incision is to consider where the size of the abscess appears, and the collection of water.
Quoniam quandoque est in occipitio plus, aut in sincipite, aut in dextra, aut in sinistra.	 Whenever it is more, either in the head, or in the skull, or in the right, or in the left.
Ascende ergo cum incisione ubi apparet tibi apostema et impletio aquae: et scinde illud secundum quod tibi possibile est.	 Therefore advance with an incision where it appears to you that there is an abscess and fill with water: and cut it as much as possible.
Et obserua, ne incidas arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis, et moriatur infirmus ex illo fluxu cum euacuatione humiditatis.	 And observe, do not cut an artery, and let the flow of blood occur, and let the sick person die from that flow with the evacuation of moisture.
¶ De incisione Arteriarum quae sunt post aures.	 Section on the incision of arteries that are behind the ears.
Caput II.	 Chapter II.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri ad oculos, aut ad pectus, et antiquatur illud, et non confert curatio medicinarum: tunc magis ultima curatio est in illo, incisio harum duarum arteriarum.	 When catarrh occurs to someone's eyes or chest, and it grows old and medical treatment does not help: then the final cure is more in that, incision of these two arteries.
Oportet ergo quando uis incidere eas, ut radat infirmus caput suum.	 Therefore, when one wants to cut them (the arteries), it is necessary for the sick person to shave his head.
Deinde frica locum cum panno aspero, ut appareant arteriae.	 Then rub the place with a rough cloth, so that the arteries appear.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum, cum quolibet panno suo.	 Then let the sick person press his neck with any cloth of his.
Deinde considera, ubi pulset uena.	 Then consider where the vein throbs.
Et loca utriusque sunt loca quae sunt post aures depressa: et raro occultatur, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	 And these places are the places that are depressed behind each ear: and they are rarely hidden except in some men.
Deinde signa cum encaustro super utraque: et incide utramque cum spatumili utrimque acuro, incisione perueniente ad os: et fiat illud per latitudinem capitis.	 Then mark both (the places) with pitch: and cut one on each side with a spoon-shaped knife, the incision reaching to the bone: and make this opening through the width of the head.
Et si uis, intromitte spatumile sub arteria, et incide eam ad superiora cum incisione.	 And if you want, insert the spoon-shaped knife under the artery, and cut it towards the top with the incision.
Et sit longitudo incisionis quasi duo digiti iuncti.	 Let the length of the incision be as long as two fingers joined together.
Nam quando inciditur uena, egreditur sanguis egressione pulsatili, qui salit ad interiora saltu frequenti.	 For when the vein is cut, blood flows out with a pulsating discharge, which jumps to the inside with frequent leaps.
Si autem arteria non apparet sensui, tunc oportet ut mensures ab aure quantitatem spacii trium digitorum.	 If the artery is not visible to the senses, then it is necessary for measurements from the ear to determine the amount of space of three fingers.
Deinde signa cum encaustro, et finde usque ad os.	 Then mark with pitch and cut until the bone.
Et illud quod oportet emittere ex sanguine, est VI uncia et fortasse emittis ex eo plus, aut minus.	 And what must be released from the blood is about 6 ounces, perhaps you will release more or less from it.
Totum illud secundum quantitatem quae apparet tibi ex uirute infirmi et repletione arteriae eius.	 Entire this according to the quantity that appears to you from the strength of the sick person and the filling of the artery.
Deinde considera ad uulnus.	 Then consider about the wound.
Tunc si remanet ad os ex sifac aliquid, tunc incide illud, ut non accidat apostema calidum: tunc stringe uulnus cum liciniis ex panno lini.	 Then if there is something left on the bone from the siphon, then cut it, so that a hot abscess does not occur: then press the wound with flax from linen cloths.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then care for him with an ointment until he is healed.
¶ De extractione arteriarum, quae sunt in timporibus.	 On the extraction of arteries which are in the temples.
Caput III.	 Chapter III.
Quando accidit homini hemicranea antiqua, aut catarri acuti propter humiditates acrimoniales, et caliditate in lacertis timporum, aut soda antiqua, uehemens, et similia illis: et medicatur cum modis curationis medicinae, et non confert illud: tunc experti sumus in his aegritudinibus extractionem arteriarum ex timporibus, aut cauterizationem earum, sicut narrauimus.	 When an old hemicrania or acute catarrh due to acrimonious humidities and warmth in the neck of time, or an old soda, severe, and similar to these occur in a man: and it is treated with methods of curative medicine, but that does not help; then we are experienced in dealing with such maladies, extraction of arteries from the neck, or cauterization of them, as we have described.
Et modus operationis in extractione earum, est, ut radat infirmus pilos qui sunt in timporibus, et intendat ad arteriam apparentem in timpore.	 And the method of operation for their extraction is that the sick person shaves hairs which are in the neck, and bends to the visible artery in the neck.
Ipsa namque ostenditur tibi ex pulsu suo, et raro occultatur nisi in paucis hominibus, aut uehementia frigoris.	 Moreover, it is shown to you by its pulse, and it rarely hides except in a few men, or severe coldness.
Quod si occultatur tibi, tunc stringat infirmus caput suum cum quolibet panno suo: deinde frica locum cum panno aspero.	 If it is hidden to you, then let the sick person tighten his head with any cloth of his; then rub the place with a rough cloth.
Aut uapora locum cum aqua calida, donec appareat tibi apparitione manifesta.	 Or boil the place with hot water, until it appears to you in a clear appearance.
Deinde accipe spatumile, quod paulo ante formaui.	 Then take a spoon, which I previously made.
Deinde excoria cum eo cutem cum facilitate, donec peruenias ad arteriam.	 Then peel the skin with it easily until you reach the artery.
Deinde proiice in eam uncinum, et extrahe eam ad superiora, donec extrahas eam ex cute, et facias eam euadere ex tunicis quae sunt sub ea ab omni parte.	 Then insert a hook into it and draw it out towards the top until you draw it out from the skin, and make it come out from all sides of the layers beneath it.
Si autem arteria est subtilis: tunc inuolue eam cum extremitate uncini.	 But if the artery is delicate: then insert it with the tip of the hook.
Deinde incide ex ea partem secundum quantitatem qua elongentur extremitates eius, et contrahantur, et non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 Then cut from that part according to the amount by which its ends will be extended and contracted, and there should not be a blood flow.
Nam si non inciditur, et si non abscinditur, non ascendit sanguis penitus.	 For if it is not cut, and if it is not separated, the blood does not rise deeply.
Deinde euacua ex sanguine ana VI unci, usque ad .III.	 Then evacuate from the blood six ounces, up to three.
Quod si arteria est magna: tunc oportet ut liges eam in duobus locis ex filo duplo, forti, ex serico: aut ex chordis alhohod, ut non properet ad ipsam putrefactio ante consolidationem uulneris, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 If the artery is large: then it must be tied in two places with strong thread, double filament, silk, or cord of alhohod, so that rot and decay do not occur before the wound is consolidated, and there should not be a blood flow.
Deinde incide superfluitatem, quae est inter duo ligamenta.	 Then cut off the excess, which is between two ligaments.
Fac illud in illa hora, aut post horam aliam.	 Do that at that hour, or another hour.
Et si uis, cauteriza eam cauterio usque ad os, cum cauterio cultellari: donec incidantur extremitates eius, et stabit loco eiusdem operis.	 And if you wish, cauterize it with a cautionery to the bone, with a small knife-shaped cauterization; until its ends are cut off, and it remains in the same place as the operation.
Et est melius opus, nisi si infirmus habet febrem, autest calefactae complexionis.	 And it is a better operation, unless the patient has fever, or suffers from cold conditions.
Quoniam cauterium est ex eis, quae iuuant ad finiendas humiditates.	 Because cautionery comes from those things that help to stop wetness.
Ergo est melius iuuamentum.	 Therefore it is a help.
Et oportet post extractionem arteriarum, ut impleatur locus cotto antiquo: et ponantur super ipsum puluilli decenter facti.	 And after the extraction of the artery, the place should be filled with old boiled material; and fine powdered lice should be placed on top of it.
Et post solutionem curetur cum medicinis siccis, quae faciunt nasci carnem, et cum liciniis, donec sanetur.	 And after the solution, it is to be cleaned with dry medicines that cause new flesh to grow and with linen until it heals.
Quod si interim dum operaris accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, tunc propera ad abscindendum eum cum cauterio, aut ut impleas locum cum zegi: et stringe manum tuam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 If there happens to be bleeding from the artery while you are operating, then hasten to cut it with cautionery or fill the place with wax; and press your hand until the bleeding stops.
Quod si nihil ex illis est tibi praesens, tunc pone super locum digitum tuum, donec congeletur sanguis.	 If there is nothing from those present, then place your finger on the place until the blood freezes.
Et embroca locum cum aqua uehementis frigoris, donec quiescat acuitas, et stringatur secundum quod oportet.	 And immerse the place with water of strong cold, until the sharpness subsides and it is pressed as necessary.
Et ex eo quod est leuius et facilius extractione arteriae, est, ut cauterizes uenam cum hoc cauterio habente duos cultellos: sitque acuitas duorum cultellorum similis almagdatem.	 And because the vein is lighter and easier to extract, it is to cauterize the vein with this cautionery having two small knives; and the sharpness of the two knives should be similar to almandine.
Verumtamen sunt multo minoris acuitatis, quam duo cultelli.	 Nevertheless, they are much less sharp than two knives.
Quoniam si sunt acutae, sicut duo cultelli, properat utrisque frigus: et non incidunt carnem cum uelocitate.	 Because if they are as sharp as two knives, cold should be applied to both of them; and they will not cut flesh swiftly.
Cum ergo in eis est aliquantulum grossitudinis, tenetur in eis calor ignis, et abscinditur caro uelociter: cum hoc ergo opus est melius omni opere, et leuius, et facilius.	 Since there is a certain thickness in them, heat of fire should be applied to them; and the flesh is cut off swiftly; when this operation is thus performed, it is better than any operation, and lighter and easier.
Et sit spacium quod est inter duos cultellos quantitas grossitudinis digiti, postquam tu signas duo loca cum encaustro: et depone utrosque ignitos ualde, donec perueniant ad os, et incidant uenam in duobus locis: ut elongetur quod est inter extremitates eius.	And let the space between two knives be of the size of a finger's width, after you mark two places with encaustum (wax); and place both extremely hot ones, until they reach the bone, and cut the vein in two places: to expel what is between its extremities.
Nam non consolidantur cum hoc cauterio penitus.	 They are not consolidated with this cautery thoroughly.
Et haec est forma cauterii.	 This is the form of the cautery.
¶ De cura cursus lachrymarum acutarum assiduarum ab oculis.	 Chapter on the treatment of continuous, acute tears from the eyes.
Caput IIII.	 Head IV.
Quando sunt lachrymae assiduae, et est cursus earum ex uenis, quae sunt super craneum capitis exterius: et non confert in eis aliquid curationis medicinae cum medicinis, et uides faciem infirmi iam rubere, et sentit in fronte sua deambulationem, sicut est deambulatio formicarum: et oculi eius sunt extenuati, humidi, ita quod iam corrosi sunt pili eorum cum corrosione: et calefactae sunt palpebrae eius ex acuitate lachrymarum: tunc antiqui indiguerunt in curatione earum hac operatione, et denominauerunt eam curationem, cum Ense.	 When the tears are continuous and there is a flow from veins on the outside of the skull; and no medicine for treatment is applied to them with medicines, and you see the face of the sick person blushing, and it feels like the crawling of ants on the forehead; and his eyes are sunken, wet, so that the hairs of their eyelashes have already been corroded by the corrosion; and his eyelids are heated due to the acuity of the tears: then the ancients resorted to this treatment for them, and they called it treatment with a knife.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere pilos qui sunt in fronte sua.	 And it is, that you order (the patient) to shave the hairs which are on his forehead.
Deinde incide in fronte tres fissuras aequedistantes secundum longitudinem frontis: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo digiti, et fissura una sit aequedistans longitudini nasi in medio frontis, et secunda secundum longitudinem parumper a motu lacertorum, et tertia a parte altera: et caue ab incisione arteriarum quae sunt in duobus lateribus: et elonga manum tuam a continuatione duarum mandibularum, et sit spacium omnis incisionis quantitas trium digitorum coniunctorum: et sit tibi frustum spongiae praeparatum, aut panni siccati multi, cum quibus exsicces sanguinem.	 Then make three equal incisions in the forehead: and let the length of the incision be as two fingers, and let one incision be equidistant from the nose in the middle of the forehead, and the second slightly below the movement of the arms, and the third on the other side: and avoid cutting the arteries which are on both sides. And extend your hand away from the continuation of the two jaws, and let the space of all incisions be the size of three finger joints connected: and have a piece of sponge prepared, or dry cloth multiplied, with which you can absorb blood.
Deinde intromitte spatumile duarum acutarum extremitatum, cuius mox sequens est forma.	 Then insert the pointed end of two pieces, whose following shape is:
Ab incisione quae est a parte timporis, usque ad incisionem secundam: et excoria cum eo totam cutem, quae est inter duas incisiones, cum sifac, quod est super os.	 From the incision which is from the temple, up to the second incision: and scrape with it the entire skin that is between two incisions, together with the fat that is above the eye.
Deinde fac illud etiam ab incisione media usque ad incisionem secundam.	 Then do the same from the middle incision up to the second incision.
Deinde extrahe hoc spatumile, et intromitte in incisionem primam iterum instrumentum aliud, quod nominatur cultellare acutum, ab una parte lene, non acutum ab altera parte.	 Then remove the pointed end and insert another tool, called a sharp knife, from one side gently, not sharp on the other side.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its shape.
Et pone latus eius acutum uersus carnem annexam cum cute, et latus eius lene uersus os: et impelle ipsum, donec perueniat ad fissuram mediam: et abscinde cum eo omnia uasa, quae descendunt a capite ad oculos: praeter quod continuetur incisio usque ad illud quod apparet de cute.	 And place its sharp side facing the attached flesh with skin, and its blunt side facing the bone: and push it until it reaches the middle incision: and cut off with it all vessels that descend from the head to the eyes, except for the incision which appears on the skin.
Deinde fac illud in fissura media usque ad fissuram aliam.	 Then do the same in the middle incision up to another incision.
Et postquam currit ex sanguine quantitas aequalis, exprime loca ex frustis sanguinis coagulati.	 And when an equal amount of blood flows out, squeeze the places from clotted blood pieces.
Deinde pone in omnem fissuram licinium ex cotto ueteri, et pone super eos puluillos imbibitos in uino, et oleo, aut aceto.	 Then place a linen cloth from an old pot on every fissure, and place over them small pieces that have been soaked in wine, oil, or vinegar.
Et uide ut non accidat apostema calidum.	 And ensure that no hot abscess occurs.
Et in die tertia solue ligamentum, et administra infusionem multam cum aqua tepida.	 On the third day, loosen the ligature and administer a large infusion with warm water.
Deinde cura illud ex unguento basilicon, et reliquis quibus curantur uulnera: usquequo sanetur.	 Then take care of that with the ointment of basilicon, and the others that heal wounds until it is healed.
¶ De cura lachrymarum acutarum et catarrorum ad oculos ex interioribus capitis.	 Chapter on the treatment of acute tear ducts and nasal catarrh from inside the head.
Caput V.	 Chapter V.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri acuti, acres, assidui: et uides oculos eius extenuatos, paruos, et iam debilitatus est aspectus eorum: et palpebrae ulceratae, et cadunt pili ex eis, et in profundo capitis est dolor acutus, laedens, et sternutatio consequens: tunc sume ex istis accidentibus, quod illae materiae, et catarri non ueniunt, nisi ex uenis multis.	 When someone has frequent, severe, and persistent catarrhs or acute tears, you notice their eyes are weakened, small, and their appearance is already poor: and the eyelids have ulcers, hairs fall out from them, and there is a sharp pain deep within the head, which causes sneezing: then take from these symptoms, those substances that catarrhs or tears do not come unless from many veins.
Et melior curatio in eis est haec.	 A better treatment for them is this.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere frontem suam.	 And it should be prescribed to the sick person to shave their forehead.
Deinde incide in eam fissuram unam in medio frontis, aut alterius parumper per latitudinem, et incipe cum fissura a timpore sinistro ad timpus dextrum: et sit incisio usque ad os: et elonga manum tuam a lacertis timporum, qui mouentur apud masticationem: donec quando detegitur os: et exsiccabis totum sanguinem cum spongia.	 Then make one incision in the middle of the forehead, or slightly to the right or left in width, starting from the left temple to the right temple, and let the incision extend to the bone: and stretch out your hand away from the temples that move during chewing until the bone is exposed: and remove all blood with a sponge.
Tunc separa inter duo labia fissurae cum cotto ueteri, aut cum liciniis ex lino.	 Then separate the two lips of the incision with a heated iron or with linen cloths.
Deinde stringe desuper cum puluillis: et imbibe puluillos cum uino et oleo, ut non accidat apostema calidum.	 Then tie on top with thread: and soak the thread with wine and oil to prevent a hot abscess from forming.
Et quando soluis illud, et uides quod apostema calidum iam imminuitur: tunc oportet ut frices os, donec incipiat in eo nasci caro.	 And when you release it and see that the hot abscess is about to decrease: then you must break the bone, until meat begins to grow in it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum regimine exiccatiuo quod facit nasci carnem: sicut si accipias ex farina tritici partes duas, et ex colophonia quatuor partes: et praepares ex eis emplastrum, et administretur ad natiuitatem carnis in istis uulneribus.	 Then care for it with a drying treatment that promotes growth of flesh: just as if you take two parts of wheat flour and four parts of resin: and prepare a plaster from them, and apply it to promote growth of flesh in these wounds.
¶ De cura eius quod cadit in Aurem.	 Section on treatment for the one falling into the ear.
Caput VI.	 Chapter VI.
Omne Quod in Aurem cadit, est una quatuor specierum: aut lapis mineralis, aut simile lapidi, sicut ferrum, et uitrum: aut est ex planta, sicut est cicer, et fabae: aut est res fluxibilis, sicut aqua, et acetum, et eis similia: aut aliquod animal.	 Every thing that falls into the ear is one of four kinds: either it is a mineral stone, or something similar to a stone like iron and wood; or it is from a plant such as chickpea and beans; or it is liquid such as water, vinegar, and similar substances; or it is an animal.
Quando ergo cadit in aurem lapis, aut genus lapidis ex eis quae non adduntur, neque crescunt in aure, expone Aurem soli: si ergo uides lapidem, tunc distilla in Aurem aliquid ex oleo uiolato, aut sisamino.	 When a stone falls into the ear or something of that kind which does not grow in the ear, expose only the ear: if you see a stone, then pour something from broken oil, or sesame into the ear.
Deinde administra extractionem eius, et fac sternutare cum condisi, et opila nares apud aduentum sternutationis, postquam tu ponis in circumitu auris frusta ex pannis, aut lana, et extendis aurem ad superiora.	 Then administer the extraction of it and make him sneeze with powder and apply opium to the nostrils near the onset of sneezing, when you put around the ear fragments from cloth or wool and stretch the ear towards the upper parts.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum hac cura.	 Often it comes out with this care.
Si autem non egreditur, tunc administra extractionem eius cum Gesti, id est, Pizigarolis subtilibus: cuius forma est haec.	 If it does not come out, then administer the extraction of it with Geisa (meaning Pizigir), that is subtle Pizigarols: whose shape is this.
Si ergo egreditur cum gesti, est bonum.	 If it comes out with Geisa, it is good.
Et si non, tunc administra extractionem eius cum uncino caeco subtili paucae duplicationis.	 And if not, then administer the extraction of it with a fine blunt hook few times.
Si ergo non egreditur per illud, tunc fac cannulam ex aere, et intromitte extremitatem cannulae in foramen auris multum, et opila quod est in circumitu cannulae cum caera mollificata cum oleo, ut non sit uento uia nisi cannulae: deinde extrahe cum uento tuo attractione forti.	 If it does not come out through that, then make a tube from iron and introduce the end of the tube into the ear opening a lot and apply opium around the tube with softened wax so that only the way is open to the wind; then extract it with your strong pull of the wind.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus.	 Often it comes out with what we have said.
Si autem non egreditur hoc modo: tunc accipe ex helkalimbat, aut ex uisco, id est, gluten praeparato, cum quo capiuntur aues, rem modicam: et pone ipsum in extremitate radii postquam tu inuoluis super eam cotum decenter positum: deinde intromitte ipsum in foramen auris cum facilitate, postquam tu exiccas aurem ab humiditate.	 If it does not come out in this way: then take some helkalimbate or distilled water, that is wheat gluten prepared with which birds are caught, a small amount; and place it on the end of the radius after you have placed a suitable lid over it well; then introduce it into the ear opening with ease, when you remove the ear from moisture.
Si ergo non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc propera ad scindendum, antequam accidat apostema calidum, aut spasmus.	 If it does not come out with all that I have mentioned, then hurry to cut, before a hot abscess or spasm occurs.
Et modus fissurae est, ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis in cephalica: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum mensuram uirtutis eius.	 The method of lancing is to first use the lancet on the weak, in the head region: and draw out from his blood according to its power.
Deinde fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et conuerte aurem eius ad superiora, et finde fissuram paruam in radice auris apud adipem eius in loco depresso ipsi: et sit fissura lunaris figurae, donec peruenias ad lapidem: deinde aufer eum cum eo, quod est tibi possibile ex instrumentis.	 Then make the weak person sit between your hands, and turn his ear upward, and make a small lancing wound at the base of the ear near its fatty tissue in the depressed place: and let the wound be in the shape of the moon until you reach the stone: then remove it with whatever is possible for you using the instruments.
Deinde sue fissuram ab hora tua cum uelocitate, et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 Then let the lancing wound heal from your own time and care until it heals.
Quod si res cadens in aurem est ex uno granorum, quae crescunt, et inflantur: tunc administra extractionem eius.	 If a grain falling into the ear is one that grows and swells, then administer its removal.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc accipe spatumile tenue, subtile, secundum hanc formam.	 But if it does not obey you for evacuation, then take a thin, delicate probe of this shape.
Et administra cum eo abscisionem illius speciei ex granis, quae cadunt in aurem, et non facias illud, quando tu cogitas, quod illud granum iam humectatum est per uaporem auris, donec ponis ipsum frusta multa: deinde extrahe ea cum uncinis, aut cum gesti subtili, aut cum suctione, sicut diximus, nam extractio eius alleuiatur.	 And administer with it the removal of that type from grains which fall into the ear, and do not do this when you think that the grain is already moistened by the moisture of the ear, until you put many fragments on it: then remove them with forceps, or with a subtle probe, or with suction, as we have said, for the removal of it is relieved.
In aqua autem quae ingreditur in aurem, oportet ut utatur infirmus sternutatione cum condisi in primis: et iam impleuit aurem suam cum aliquanto cotto ueteri: et est iacens super illam aurem, in qua est aqua.	 In water which enters the ear, the weak should use sneezing with it in the first place: and already the ear has filled itself with some hot water: and it lies on top of that ear where the water is.
Si ergo egreditur per illud, est bonum.	 If it comes out through this, it is good.
Et si non: tunc accipe lapides multos, secundum longitudinem digiti, tenues, lenes, et calefac eos cum igne parumper, et intromittat infirmus ex eis unum in foramen auris suae: et saliat super pedem suum unum ex illa parte, et percutiat cum lapide alio super lapidem qui est in aure.	 And if not: then take many small, soft, warm stones according to the length of a finger and heat them slightly: and the weak person should insert one from these into the ear canal of his: and sprinkle one foot with it on that side, and strike with another stone against the stone in the ear.
Non ergo cesset facere illud cum lapide et lapide, donec egrediatur tota aqua.	 "Therefore, it should not cease to be done with a stone and a stone, until all the water comes out.
Et iam egreditur aqua ita, ut accipias ex parpyro, aut ex iunco unum, et intromittas extremitatem eius unam in aurem: et accendas extremitatem alteram cum igne, donec comburatur plurimum eius.	 "And now the water flows out in such a way that you take one from balsam or reed, and insert its tip into the ear; and light the other end with fire until it burns as much of it as possible.
Deinde itera iuncum alium, et fac illud multotiens, donec egrediatur tota aqua: et extrahe ipsam cum cannula secundum quod praemissum est in lapide.	 "Then take another reed and do this repeatedly until all the water comes out; and draw it out with a cannula as described earlier using the stone.
In extractione autem animalis intrantis in eam, si est parui corporis, ut pulex, et ei simile, cura ipsum sicut dixi in diuisione.	 "In the extraction of an animal that has entered it, if it is of small body size, like a louse, and similar to what was said in the division, care should be taken for it as I have stated.
Sed si est corporis magni, quod appareat sensui: tunc administra extractionem eius cum gesti, et uncinis: et res eius est facilior omnibus, quae tenentur in aure.	 "But if it is of large body size, which can be perceived by the sense: then administer the extraction of it with tweezers and hooks; and its removal is easier for all who hold in the ear.
In extractione autem uermis generati in aure, quando curas eum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et in tractatu distilationum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut aspicias aurem in sole.	 "In the extraction of worms generated in the ear, when care for it is not effective as I have said in division and in the treatment of distillations, then you should look at the ear in sunlight.
Si ergo apparet illic aliquid ex uermibus, tunc extrahe illud cum gesti, aut cum uncinis subtilibus.	 "Therefore, if something appears there from worms, then draw it out with tweezers or delicate hooks.
Si autem non apparet illic aliquid, tunc accipe cannulam, cuius haec est forma, stricta inferius, ampla superius: et intromitte extremitatem subtilem in aurem secundum quantitatem quod tolerat eam infirmus: deinde suge cum ea suctione forti.	 "But if nothing appears there, then take a cannula with this shape: narrow at the bottom and wide at the top; insert its fine tip into the ear according to the size that the sick person can tolerate; then suck it with strong suction.
Fac illud multotiens, donec egrediantur omnes uermes.	 "Do this repeatedly until all worms come out.
Si autem non obediunt tibi ad exitum, tunc opila circumitum cannulae cum caera, sicut dixi in lapide.	 "But if they do not obey your command to leave, then wrap the tip of a cannula with wax as I have said using the stone.
Quod si non egrediuntur cum eo quod diximus: tunc administra distillationes quas iam experti sunt antiqui in interfectione uermium: et inuenies illud in tractatu distillationum.	 "If they do not come out as I have said, then administer the distillations that the ancients have been experienced with in the treatment of worms; and you will find it in the treatment of distillations.
Et sit effusio tua qua effundis olea et medicinas in aurem cum hoc instrumento, cuius forma depicta est hic.	 And let your flow (be) that which you pour oil and medicines into the ear with this instrument, whose shape is depicted here.
Sicut uides fac ipsum ex argento, aut aere, inferius strictum, in quo sit foramen paruum, amplum superius.	 As you see, make it from silver or bronze, narrow below, where there should be a small hole, wide above.
Sit ergo ut impellens quod est in concauitate cannulae, sit ex aere decenter factum.	 Therefore, let the thing (that is) pressed within the hollow of the cannula be made of bronze properly.
Et si uis, accipe radium, et inuolue in extremitate eius cottum inuolutione decenti: deinde proiice oleum, aut succum, aut quod uis ex istis medicinis in cannulam: et ipsa sit in aure: deinde intromitte radium cum cotto desuper, et exprime ipsum manu tua compressione temperata, donec impellatur oleum in concauitate auditus, et sentiat ipsum infirmus interius: et illud quod infunditur in aurem, sit iam calefactum cum igne parumper: et caue ne sit res quae distillatur in eam frigida ualde: medicinae enim non tolerant illud.	 And if you wish, take radium (a mixture of copper and zinc), and wrap its end with a wrapping properly; then pour oil, or juice, or whatever medicine you want into the cannula; and let it be in the ear; then insert radium with the wrapper on top, and press it with your hand moderately, until the oil is pressed out in the hollow of the ear, and the sick person feels it inside: and whatever is poured into the ear, let it be already heated slightly; and take care that there is no substance that distills excessively cold into it; medicines cannot tolerate that.
¶ De cura opilationis accidentis Auri.	 Chapter on the treatment of auricular impaction (ear blockage).
Caput VII.	 Chapter VII.
Quandoque egrediuntur quidam infantes ex uentribus matrum suarum non perforati.	 Whenever some infants emerge from their mother's womb without perforated eardrums.
Et iam accidit etiam quibusdam hominibus opilatio in meatu Auris a uulnere, aut carne nata in ea.	 And it also happens to some people that ear impaction occurs due to a wound or tissue born in the ear.
Et haec opilatio quandoque fit in profundo foraminis Auris, quam non consequitur uisus: et quandoque accidit ad exteriora foraminis parum, et consequitur eam uisus.	 And this impaction sometimes occurs in the deep ear canal, which is not visible; and sometimes it occurs near the outer ear canal, which can be seen.
Illa ergo quae accidit in profundo Auris, et quam non comprehendit aspectus, est in pluribus dispositionibus difficilis sanationis.	 Therefore, that which occurs in the deep ear and is not perceptible by sight, is difficult to cure in many dispositions (positions).
Et in illa quam consequitur uisus, oportet ut ponas Aurem infirmi in sole, et aspicias in ea: tunc si uides opilationem apparentem, aperi eam cum spatumili subtili, cuius forma est haec quae sequitur, sit extremitas eius in qua sit quaedam latitudo parua, cuius quaedam pars sit acuta: et reliquum spatumile sit duarum laterum lenium: ut non laedat aurem.	 And in the one which is visible by sight, it is necessary that you place the sick person's ear on the sun and look at it; then if you see the impaction appearing, open it with a thin spatula whose shape is as follows, its end should have a small hollow, part of which should be sharp: and the rest of the spatula should be two sides that are gentle so as not to harm the ear.
Si ergo opilatio est a carne nata in meatu auris: tunc tene eam cum uncino subtili, et incide eam cum facilitate uehementi, donec auferatur tota caro.	 If therefore an abscess is born from the flesh within the ear: then hold it with a subtle hook, and cut it easily and powerfully until all the flesh is removed.
Quod si opilatio est in profundo auris: tunc accipe radium subtilem, lenem, et calefac ipsum cum igne parumper: deinde mitte ipsum in meatum auris.	 If therefore an abscess has gone deep into the ear: then take a thin probe, warm it slightly with fire: then put it into the ear.
Si ergo senseris opilationem cum eo, quod inuenit infirmus cum grauitate auditus, conare apertionem eius cum facilitate: et caue, ne uulneres neruos auris.	 If you should feel an abscess which is accompanied by weakness and difficulty of hearing, try to open it gently: and be careful not to injure the nerves of the ear.
Deinde pone in aurem licinium secundum quantitatem amplitudinis foraminis, quod inuoluisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud aliquot diebus, donec sis securus de consolidatione uulneris.	 Then put linen in the ear according to the size of the hole you made, wrapped in Egyptian ointment: do this for several days until you are certain that the wound has healed.
Aut accipe licinium, et infunde ipsum in aqua rosata, et pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, et utere ipso.	 Or take linen and soak it in rose water, powderize on it ground alum, and use it.
Quod si uides aurem iam apostemari: tunc oportet ut extrahas licinium, et permittas ipsum cum licinio alio, quod inuolues in caeroto quod sit factum cum oleo rosato, donec sedetur apostema calidum: deinde cura ipsum usquequo sanetur.	 If you see that the ear is beginning to decay: then it is necessary to extract the linen, and allow it to remain with another piece of linen which you have wrapped in a pot made with rose oil, until the decaying matter becomes warm: then take care of it until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis: tunc submerge spongiam, aut pannos in aqua frigida, et pone super eam aurem: et utere reliqua curatione, quae abscindit fluxum sanguinis praedicta in tractatu distillationum.	 If there is bleeding, immerse a sponge or cloth in cold water, and place it on the ear: and use the rest of the treatment that removes the described bleeding in the section on distillation.
¶ De cura Altheli palpebrarum.	 Chapter on the care of Althelia's Eyes (Eyelids).
Caput VIII.	 Chapter VIII.
Isti Althelil qui accidunt in Palpebris oculi, quandoque sunt humidi, et sunt sicci.	 Those Altheli that occur on the eyelids of the eyes are sometimes wet and sometimes dry.
Oportet ergo ut teneas eos cum tenaliis: aut cum uncino, et incidas eos cum spatumili a radicibus suis.	 Therefore it is necessary to hold them with tweezers or with a hook, and cut them from their roots.
Deinde pone super loca zegi tritum.	 Then apply powdered alum.
Si autem ex eis fluat sanguis, tunc cauteriza eos cum cauterio lenticulari subtili.	 If blood flows from them, then cauterize them with a fine lenticular cautionery.
Et cauterizare eos, est melius post incisionem.	 To cauterize them is better after the incision.
Multotiens enim redeunt quando remanet ex radicibus suis aliquid.	 Often they return when something remains from their roots.
Et quando cauterizantur cum igne, comburuntur illae radices, et non redeunt.	 And when cauterized with fire, those roots are burned and do not return.
¶ De cura Grandinum palpebrarum oculi.	 Chapter on the treatment of inflammation of the eyelids of the eye.
Caput IX.	 Section IX.
Multotiens accidit in palpebris aliquid quod assimilatur Crandini in fortitudine sua, et sua duricie, et propter illud nominatur Grando: et est aggregatio humiditatis grossae in palpebra superiore, et palpebra inferiore.	 Often something happens on the eyelids resembling Grandinosity in its firmness and hardness, and it is called a Grandino; it is an accumulation of thick humidity on the upper eyelid and lower eyelid.
Operatio ergo in eis est, ut consideres tunc, si est Grando procedens in eo, quod apparet de palpebra, et mouentur ad omnem partem, et res eius est facilis.	 Therefore the operation is to determine if it is a Grandino that appears on the eyelid and moves in all directions; its matter is easy to remove.
Finde ergo super eam fissura per latitudinem.	 Make an incision above it with sufficient width.
Deinde excoria eam ab omni parte cum facilitate, donec euadat.	 Then scrape it from all sides easily until it comes out.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncino, et abscinde ipsam.	 Then hold it with a hook and cut it off.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi abscisio eius, nisi postquam tu penetras palpebram cum incisione parumper, tunc nocet infirmo illud in aliquo.	 If the removal of it is not prepared for you unless after you have penetrated the eyelid with a small incision, then it harms the weak in some way.
Quod si fissura est magna: tunc aggrega ipsam cum sutura: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 If the incision is large: then gather it up with stitching; and care for it until it heals.
Et si est parua, non superueniet tibi malum ex ea.	 And if it is small, no harm will come to you from that.
Vnguentum enim restaurat ipsam, et incarnat eam.	 Ointment restores and fills it in.
Et si grando est decliuis ad interiora auris uersus superficiem intrinsecam, tunc inuersa palpebram, et suspende grandinem cum uncino: praeter quod indigeas incisione, et preme eam ab omni parte.	 And if the Grandino is inclined towards the inner part of the ear and the surface turns inwards, then turn the eyelid over, hold the Grandino with a hook; apart from that you will need an incision, and press it from all sides.
Quod si elongatur palpebra per incisionem, non nocet illud in aliquo.	 If the eyelid is stretched by the incision, it does not harm the weak in any way.
Deinde ablue oculum post incisionem grandinis, cum aqua salsa: et cura locum cum eo quod incarnat, donec sanetur infirmus.	 Then wash the eye after snow-blowing incision with salted water; and take care of the place until it heals when the patient is sick.
¶ De cura Axirnath palpebrarum.	 On the cure of the Eyelids.
Caput X.	 Chapter X.
Axirnath est adeps qui generatur in tunicis palpebrae superioris: et plurimum quidem accidit illud pueris: et ipsum grauat oculos eorum, et accidunt eis catarri in matutinis, et non possunt intueri lumen solis, propterea, quod lachrymae properant ad eos, et propter illud uides eos discumbere super facies suas semper, et super eas dormiunt, et sunt palpebrae eorum sub superciliis humidae, quas iam cooperuit inflatio: et eminentia quidem Axirnath apparens est oculo, et quando tu premis locum cum digitis tuis, sentis Axirnath inter eos.	 The axirnath is a boil that arises in the upper eyelid; and it mostly happens to children; and it weighs down their eyes, and they get cataracts in the mornings, and they cannot see the light of the sun, because tears run towards them, and for this reason you see them lying on their faces constantly, and sleeping on them, and their eyelids are always moist under the eyebrows, which have already been swollen; and the appearance of the axirnath is visible to the eye, and when you press the place with your fingers, you feel the axirnath between them.
Et modus operationis eius est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	 And the method of treatment is for the patient to put his head in your lap.
Deinde accipe pannum lini, et praepara in eo licinia, et fac ex illo licinio circulum secundum quantitatem quod continet Axirnath ab omni parte.	 Then take a linen cloth, and prepare on it a linen square according to the size of what contains axirnath from all sides.
Deinde pone eum super eam, et preme cum digitis tuis ab omni parte, ut aggregetur Axirnath in medio circuli.	 Then put it on top and press with your fingers from all sides, so that axirnath gathers in the middle of the circle.
Deinde finde in medio illius humiditatis cum spatumili incidente fissuras per latitudinem, et non sit fissura maior illa quae fit in phlebotomia in profundo.	 Then find in the center of that moisture with a thin-bladed knife-like instrument, and let the incision not be larger than the one made during venesection in depth.
Aut oportet ut findas cutem totam, donec peruenias ad Axirnath in pluribus enim dispositionibus procedit Axirnath ex fissura secundum formam frusti pinguedinis albae.	 Or it is necessary that you make an incision of the entire skin until you reach axirnath, because axirnath proceeds from the incision in various dispositions, for axirnath comes out from the incision like the shape of a white grease ball.
Extrahe ergo eam cum panno, quem infiltrasti inter digitos tuos ad exteriora: et tu reuoluis manum tuam ad dextram et sinistram, donec dispergatur: et caue, ne addas in fissura, ut non peruenias cum spatumili ad oculum, et laedas eum.	 Then remove it with a cloth that you have infused between your fingers towards the outside; and you turn your hand to right and left until it is dispersed; and be careful not to add to the incision so as not to reach with the knife-like instrument to the eye, and damage it.
Si autem non appareat tibi Axirnath in principio fissurae, tu addas in fissura parum cum facilitate, donec procedat Axirnath.	 If however the Axirnath does not appear to you at the beginning of the split, you shall add a little into the split with ease, until the Axirnath comes out.
Deinde extrahe eam, sicut diximus.	 Then extract it, as we have said.
Deinde submerge pannos in aceto et aqua, et pone eos super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis.	 Then immerse the cloths in vinegar and water, and place them on the site, and bind it with threads.
Et ex hominibus sunt qui terunt salem, et ponunt ipsum in concauitate fissurae, ut liquefiat quod remansit ex illa humiditate.	 And among men there are those who grind salt and place it in the hollow of the split to dissolve what remains from that moisture.
Deinde cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it until it heals.
Si autem accidat in loco apostema calidum, tune cura ipsum cum emplastris sedatiuis, donec sanetur.	 If however an abscess occurs at the site which is hot, then care for it with soothing plasters until it heals.
¶ De modis Ataxmir oculi, id est, cum palpebra mollificatur oculi, unde fit ut rugetur sicut non debet.	 \*\*Methods of Ataxmira for the eye, that is, when the eyelid becomes soft so that it weeps as it should not.\*\*
Caput XI.	 Chapter XI.
Quando nascuntur in palpebris oculi pili additi praeter cursum sub pilis naturalibus, et antiquantur: tunc ipsi nocent oculo, et faciunt accidere modos aegritudinum, sicut lachrymas assiduas, et mollificationem palpebrarum, et albuginem, donec fit illud caussa destructionis oculi.	 When hairs appear in the eyelids beyond the natural course of hair growth and turn grey, then they harm the eye and cause diseases such as constant weeping, softening of the eyelid, and clouding, until it causes the destruction of the eye.
Et Ataxmir quidem oculi curatur secundum quatuor modos.	 And Ataxmira for the eye is treated according to four methods.
Aut per cauterium cum igne.	 Or by cautery with fire. (This means using a hot instrument to burn away the excess hair.)
Aut cum medicina acuta, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo cauterii.	 Or with sharp medicine, according to what has been said in the chapter on cautery. (The "sharp medicine" refers to chemicals or agents that can burn away the excess hair.)
Aut curatur Ataxmir per incisionem et suturam.	 Ataxmir is treated by incision and suture.
Aut per cannas, secundum quod ego dicam.	 By reeds, as I shall say.
Oportet ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	 You must place the head of the sick man on your lap.
Deinde conuerte palpebram oculi manu tua sinistra.	 Then turn the eyelid of the eye with your left hand.
Si ergo conuertitur, bonum est.	 If it is turned, that is good.
Et si non: intromitte acum in eam, in qua sit filum ab inferiori parte palpebrae, et fac penetrare acum cum filo desuper, et sit illud prope pilos ipsos, id est, prope marginem palpebrae, in quo nascuntur pili: et trahe filum ad superiora cum palpebra, et conuerte eam cum radio.	 And if not: insert the point into it, where there is a thread from below the eyelid; let the point penetrate with the thread from above, and let this be near the hairs themselves, that is, near the edge of the eyelid, where the hairs grow: and draw the thread upward along with the eyelid, and turn it with a spatula.
Deinde finde in interiori parte palpebrae sub pilis additis cum spatumili incidente a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus.	 Then find on the inside of the eyelid below the added hairs, with the probe inserted from the greater lacrimal sac to the lesser lacrimal sac.
Deinde extrahe filum, et pone sub palpebra puluillum paruum ex cotto, aut panno: deinde signa super palpebram cum encaustro, quod sit sicut figura folii myrti.	 Then draw out the thread, and place under the eyelid a small piece of cotton or cloth; then mark the eyelid with wax, so that it resembles the figure of a myrtle leaf.
Verumtamen oportet, ut fit figura secundum quantitatem et eleuationem palpebrae: quoniam iam diuersificatur illud in hominibus.	 However, it is necessary that the figure be made according to the size and elevation of the eyelid; because it varies greatly among humans.
Ex eis enim est, qui indiget ut incidatur ex palpebra quantitas magna, secundum quantitatem quae mollificatur a palpebra.	 For there are those who require that the incision be made according to a large size of the eyelid, according to the amount that is softened by the eyelid.
Deinde cum spatumili finde super duas lineas quas signasti, et incipe a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus, et sit fissura una prope pilos naturales, sicut est grossitudo radii.	 Then with the probe find on top of the two lines you marked, and start from the greater lacrimal sac to the lesser lacrimal sac; let there be one fissure near the natural hairs, like a thick vein.
Deinde intromitte uncinum in uno duorum angulorum cutis.	 Then insert the hook into one of the two corners of the skin.
Deinde excoria ipsam totam.	 Then scrape the whole thing.
Deinde aggrega cum sutura duo labia, cum acu et filo lana subtili: et absterge sanguinem, et fac adhaerere quod superfluit ex filis super duo supercilia, cum quibusdam rebus inuiscantibus, si uis facere illud: et si non, non cures.	 Then join together with a suture the two lips, using a sharp needle and fine wool; wipe away the blood, and let the excess from the threads adhere to the eyebrows, if you wish to do this: and if not, do nothing.
Deinde dimitte suturam et fila usque ad tres dies, aut quatuor: postea cura illud.	 Then release the suture and the threads for three or four days; afterwards, take care of it.
Et si uis, dimitte uulnus absque sutura, et cura ipsum cum eo, quod exsiccat et constringit.	 And if you wish, release the wound without suture, and take care of it, so that it dries out and contracts.
Nam palpebra eleuatur apud sigillationem uulneris et aggregationem eius: sed futura est melior.	 For the eyelid is elevated during the sealing of a wound and its adhesion; but it will be better later on.
Hunc modum curandi Ataxmir docuerunt antiqui.	 This method of healing was taught by the ancient Ataxmires.
Verumtamen in eo est sollicitudo super infirmum, et est ex bona operatione, et non est in eo timor.	 However, there is concern for the sick person in this, and it comes from a good operation, and there is no fear in it.
Et modus alius est in Ataxmir etiam: et est, ut signes super palpebram figuram, quae sit sicut figura folii myrti, sicut narrauimus.	 And another method is in the Ataxmires also: it is to mark signs on the eyelid with a figure like that of the leaf of the myrtle, as we have said.
Deinde eleua palpebram cum tribus uncinis separatis, aut aggregatis, secundum formam hanc quae sequitur, deinde incide quod superfluit cum forficibus paruis, secundum hanc formam, cum aequalitate incisionis.	 Then lift the eyelid with three separated or joined combs in the following shape, then cut off what is excessive with small scissors according to this shape with equal incisions.
Si autem non est tibi possibile tenere uncinum, et non aequatur illud: tunc accipe acum in qua sit filum, et intromitte ipsum in medio figurae: et intromitte filum aliud prope lachrymale maius, et filum secundum prope lachrymale minus: et aggrega inter digitos tuos fila cum aequalitate.	 If it is not possible for you to hold the comb and it does not fit, then take a needle with thread, and insert it into the middle of the figure; and insert another thread near the greater tear duct, and a third thread near the smaller tear duct; and gather the threads with equal tension between your fingers.
Deinde eleua manum tuam eleuatione aequali: et eleua cutem super quam est signatum cotum, sicut narrauimus.	 Then lift your hand evenly with an elevation; and lift the skin over which is marked the wound, as we have said.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then gather together two edges of the wound with a suture; and take care of it until it heals.
Si uero accidat apostema apud incisionem tuam, aut fissuram tuam: seda illud apostema cum caeroto, et his similibus, ex unguentis sedantibus.	 If an abscess occurs at your incision or your wound, use wool to soothe it with pitch and similar substances from soothing ointments.
Et quandoque accidit palpebrae etiam, ut conuertantur pili eius.	 And sometimes the eyelashes also turn over.
Oportet ergo ut utaris in ea quod diximus in incisione: sed sutura utrisque magis est artificialis.	 Therefore, it is necessary to use what we have said for an incision; but a suture is more artificial for both.
¶ De cura Ataxmir cum cannis.	 Treatment for Ataxmir with dogs.
ET Est, ut conuertas palpebram, et scindas fissuram quae est deintus, secundum quod narraui.	 It is to turn the eyelid and cut the cleft that is inside, as I have said before.
Deinde arte fac duas cannas, aut duo ligna subtilia: quarum longitudo sit secundum longitudinem palpebrae, et latitudo earum sit minor latitudine spatumilis: et tu iam incidisti in extremitatibus utriusque ab utrisque partibus ubi tenes fila.	 Then, using art, make two dogs or two thin sticks of wood, their length being the same as the eyelid's length and their width narrower than that of the spatula's; and you have already cut on both ends at the places where you hold the thread from each side.
Deinde aggrega utramque cum subtilitate super illud quod superfluit ex palpebra oculi, et stringe duas cannas ab utrisque partibus strictura forti, et dimitte eam diebus aliquot.	 Then gather one of them with a spatula on that which overhangs from the eyelid of the eye and tie the two dogs from each side with strong binding, and release it after several days.
Cutis enim stricta morietur, et denigrabitur, et putrefiet, donec cadet per se.	 For the tightened skin will die, darken, and rot until it falls off by itself.
Si ergo tardatur, tunc incide eam cum forficibus.	 If it slows down (the dead skin), then cut it with scissors.
Deinde cura eam, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it until it heals.
Cum ergo consolidatur, eleuatur palpebra: et non pungunt pili.	 When it hardens, lift the eyelid and do not pluck the hairs.
Et haec est forma duarum cannarum, quas facies secundum hanc figuram, et quantitatem in longitudinem et latitudinem.	 And this is the shape of the two dogs that you will make according to this form and its size (dimensions).
¶ De eleuatione pilorum pungentium in oculo cum acu.	 Treatment for plucking hairs from the eye with a needle.
Caput XII.	 Chapter 12.
Operatio in illo est, ut accipias acum subtilem, et intromittas in eam filum ex serico subtile, lene.	 The procedure is to take a fine needle and insert a thin silk thread into it gently.
Deinde aggreges extremitates eius, et nodes utramque nodo subtili ualde: et sit longitudo filorum palmus unus.	 Then gather its ends and tie them both with a very thin knot; and the length of the threads should be one palm (of the hand).
Deinde compone in Alinxotati filum aliud subtile sub eo in breui, et noda extremitates eius si uis.	 Then prepare another thin thread called Alinxotati underneath it briefly and knot its ends if you wish.
Deinde ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo, et sit prope solem ut declaretur operatio: quoniam est operatio subtilis, uel minuta.	 Then place the sick person's head on your lap and bring it close to the sun so that the operation may be visible; because this is a delicate or minor operation.
Deinde intromitte acum cum alinxotati in radicem palpebrae, et fac eam penetrare in palpebram festinanter, donec extrahas eam desuper pilum naturalem.	 Then insert the needle with Alinxotati into the root of the eyelid and make it penetrate quickly into the eyelid until you pull out the natural hair from above.
Deinde trahe pilum usque supra alinxotati: et intromitte in alinxotati illum pilum: si est unus, aut duo, aut tres, non plures.	 Then draw out the needle above the incision: and insert the needle into the incision; if it is one, or two, or three, not more than that.
Deinde trahe manum tuam cum eo, donec egrediatur pilus cum alinxotati in palpebra cum pilo naturali.	 Then draw your hand along with it, until the needle comes out of the incision together with the hair and the surrounding skin along with its natural hair.
Si autem trahatur alinxotati, et non egrediatur pilus cum ea: trahes alinxotati ad inferiora, cum filo quod tu composuisti in ea, donec egrediatur alinxotati ex foramine superiori, et uideas eam uisione oculi: tunc enim trahes alinxotati, et filum: et extrahe utraque, et claude oculum: et dimitte ipsum clausum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec adhaereat pilus loco suo, et nascatur super ipsum caro.	 If the incision is drawn and no hair comes out with it, draw the incision downward with the thread you have prepared in it, until the incision comes out of the upper opening, and you see it with your eyes; then you draw out the incision and the thread, and extract both, and close the eye, and leave the closed one for two or three days, until the hair adheres to its place, and flesh grows over it.
Quod si pilus est breuis, tunc aut associa ei pilum longum ex pilis naturalibus, et eleuatur cum eo: aut dimitte ipsum, donec elongetur post spacium, et tunc eleua ipsum.	 If the hair is short, then tie a long hair from the natural hairs to it and pull them out together; or leave it alone until it grows out, and then pull it out.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae accidit in palpebra superiori.	 Chapter on the treatment of Xanthelasma that occurs in the upper eyelid.
Caput XIII.	 Chapter XIII.
Quando accidit oculo haec Alxatrati, nominatur Leporina.	 When this xanthelasma occurs in the eye, it is called "Leporina.
Et haec Alxatrati est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	 And this xanthelasma is either natural or acquired.
Accidentalis ergo fit ex consolidatione uulneris, aut sectionis, aut cauterii, et similium illis.	 Therefore the acquired one arises from the consolidation of a wound, or a cut, or a cauterization, and similar things.
Et modus operationis in ea est, ut tu findas illam consolidationem, et ut separes labia eius, et ponas in eo quod est inter ea licinium ex lino, et liges eam, donec sanetur.	 And the method of operation in it is to open the consolidation and separate its edges, and put a piece of cotton from flax in it, and tie it until it heals.
Et non oportet, ut utaris in curatione eius rebus quae exiccant et constringunt: nam si tu facis illud, redit Alxatrati deterior quam fuit: imo utere in ea rebus quae mollificant, sicut foenumgraecum: et embroca cum aqua, in qua cocta sit althea, semen lini: et unguento dyaquilon, quod liquefactum sit cum aliquo ex oleis: et inuolue cum eo licinium, et cura cum eo.	 And it is not necessary to use in the treatment of this xanthelasma things that dry and tighten; for if you do so, the xanthelasma becomes worse than before; rather use things that soften, such as fenugreek: and embrocation with water, in which althea has been boiled, along with flax seed; and unguent of dyaquilon, which has been melted with some oil; and apply cotton soaked with it, and treat with it.
Et thesaurus curationis tuae est, ut coneris omni ingenio, ut non consolidetur, secundum formam quae fuit in primis.	 Thy treasure of care is that thou should endeavor with all thy skill, so as not to heal in its former shape.
Et haec quidem operatio quam diximus, non est nisi quaedam rectificatio Alxatrati, ut non redeat forma loci secundum quod fuit omnino.	 This operation which we have said, is indeed a correction of the Alexis, so that not the shape of the place should return as it was altogether.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae fit in palpebra inferiori, et est rugatio uel contractio sursum ad dextrum et sinistrum.	 Of the care of Alexis which is done on the lower eyelid, and it is a thickening or contraction upwards towards right and left.
Caput XIIII.	 Chapter XIV.
Haec Alxatrati quae fit inferius, est quae uere nominatur Alxatrati.	 This which is done below [on the lower eyelid], is indeed what is truly named Alexis.
Et est naturalis, et est accidentalis.	 And it is natural, and it is accidental.
Et accidentalis fit ex uulnere, aut fissura, aut cauterio, et illis similibus.	 And the accidental [Alexis] is made from a wound, or a split, or cautery, and similar things.
Et uia operationis in ea est, ut accipias acum, in qua sit filum duplum, et tingas eam in carnem, et facias eam penetrare a lachrymali sinistro usque ad lachrymale dextrum, donec perueniat filum in duabus extremitatibus carnis.	 And the way of operation in this is that thou takest a needle with double thread, and dost dip it into flesh, and maketh it pass from tear-duct on the left unto tear-duct on the right, until the thread reach the ends of the flesh.
Deinde extende carnem ad superiora cum acu, et incide eam cum spatumili lato.	 Then extend the flesh upwards with a needle, and cut it with a broad knife.
Si ergo redit figura palpebrae secundum quod oportet, est bonum.	 If therefore the shape of the eyelid return as it should be, it is good.
Et si non, accipe radium, et pone ipsum in fissuram, et conuerte cum eo palpebram: et finde duas fissuras in latere interiore palpebrae, et sint extremitates duarum fissurarum ex duobus angulis incisionis, donec concurrant et fiat ex eis angulus: donec quando aggregantur fiat figura earum haec figura, et est litera lauda graeca.	 And if not, take a burnisher, and put it in the split, and turn with it the eyelid; and make two splits on the inner side of the eyelid, and let the ends of the two splits be from the corners of the incision, until they meet and make an angle: until when they gather together this shape is made, and it is the Greek letter lambda.
Deinde aufer illam carnem per quantitatem, quod est latus eius acutum inferius, ab eo quod sequitur palpebram.	 Then remove that flesh to its sharp lower part from what follows the eyelid.
Deinde aggrega partes separatas: sue eam cum filo lanae.	 Then gather together the separated parts; or it with a yarn thread.
Deinde cura eas cum eo quod diximus, de medicinis mollificantibus, et liciniis, donec sanentur.	 Then care for them [the splits] with what we said, from softening medicaments and linen, until they heal.
Et si Alxatrati accidat ex fissura, et sutura, aut cauterio: tunc oportet ut findas fissura plana sub pilis palpebrarum, etiam secundum quod praecessit.	 If Alxatrati occurs from a fissure, either by suturing or cauterizing: then it is necessary to explore the fissure flat under the eyelashes, as before.
Deinde separa inter duo labia cum licinio, secundum quod diximus.	 Then separate between two lips with a linen cloth, as we said before.
Et summa sermonis de cura Alxatrati, quando est desuper, aut inferius, est, ut currat in ea operatio, secundum quod praeparatur ex forma Alxatrati.	 The summary of the treatment for Alxatrati, whether it is above or below, is that the operation should be performed on it, according to the preparation as described for Alxatrati.
Ipsa namque est multarum diuersitatum in forma: et artifex prudens praeparat ingenium cum quocunque modo est possibile ei, donec redire faciat figuram ad formam naturalem, aut prope eam, et ipsemet infirmus, secundum quod conuenit ei ex operatione et instrumentis in plurimis dispositionibus.	 Indeed it (Alxatrati) is full of many diversities in shape: and the skillful artisan prepares his art with whatever means is possible to him, so that he makes it return to a natural or nearly natural figure, and himself who is sick, according to what is suitable for him from the operation and instruments in various dispositions.
¶ De adhaerentia palpebrae oculi cum coniunctiua, aut cornea.	 Chapter on the adherence of the eyelid with the conjunctiva, or cornea.
Caput XV.	 Chapter XV.
Quandoque accidit haec consolidatio multis hominibus, ita ut consolidetur palpebra superior cum albedine oculi, et prohibeat ipsum ab operationibus suis naturalibus.	 When this consolidation happens to many people, so that the upper eyelid adheres with the white of the eye and prevents it from performing its natural functions.
Oportet ergo quod intromittas extremitatem radii sub palpebra, et eleues eam sursum: aut extendas eam cum uncino: deinde incide adhaerentiam cum spatumili subtili, quod non sit cum acuitate incisionis spatumilium, imo sit obtusum parumper: ut non inquietetur infirmus apud operationem, et remoueatur spatumile, et laedat oculum cum acuitate sua: et sit incisio tua quasi tu excories illam adhaerentiam cum facilitate, donec quando redit palpebra secundum formam suam naturalem, et sanetur adhaerentia tota.	 Therefore, it is necessary that you introduce the tip of a radius under the eyelid and pull it up; or extend it with a hook; then cut the adherence with a thin spatula, which should not be sharp like a spatula's edge, but rather dull slightly; so that the sick person is not disturbed during the operation, and the spatula is removed, and it does not harm the eye with its sharpness; and your incision should be as if you are scraping off the adherence with ease, until when the eyelid returns to its natural shape, and the adherence is completely healed.
Funde tunc in oculum aquam salsam, cum aqua ablue ipsum: aut distilla in ipsum ex sief facto, ex ziniar dissoluto cum aqua.	 Then pour salted water into the eye, and rinse it with water; or drip it onto him from a syringe made of sheep's horn with water mixed.
Deinde separa inter palpebram et oculum cum licinio lini: et pone super oculum lanam infusam cum albugine oui: et post diem tertium utere sief, et cum solidatiuis, donec sanetur.	 Then separate with a linen thread between the eyelid and the eye: and place on the eye wool soaked with egg white: and after three days use it or with solidified ointments, until it heals.
¶ De incisione ungulae et eminentiae carnis lachrymarum.	 On the Incision of the Toenail and the Protrusion of Skin around the Eyes.
Caput XVI.	 Chapter XVI.
Scias, quod ungula est secundum duos modos.	 Know that a toenail is according to two modes.
Aut est neruosa: et est similis sifac duro, subtili.	 Or it is horny and resembles the hoof of an ox, being hard but fine.
Aut est non neruosa, similis humiditati congelatae albae: quae quando tangit cam ferrum, aut conaris capere eam cum uncino, abscinditur, et non figitur in ea uncinus.	 Or it is not horny, resembling the consistency of frozen white moisture, which when touched with iron or attempted to be picked up with a nail, is torn off and cannot be gripped by the nail.
Et utraeque species non incipiunt, nisi a lachrymali maiore, usquequo uadit paulatim, donec cooperit uisum, et prohibet lumen, et motum oculi.	 And neither of these types begins, except from the greater tear duct, until it gradually reaches the eye, covers the vision, and prevents light and movement of the eye.
Et modus operandi in incisione eius est: ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	 And the method of operation in the incision is: that the sick person places his head in your lap.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et eleua palpebram manu tua.	 Then open the eyes of the patient and pull back the eyelid with your hand.
Deinde collige ungulam cum uncino paucae duplationis, et extende eam ad superiora.	 Then gather the toenail with a small nail, and extend it upward.
Deinde accipe acum, et intromitte in eam pilum ex pilis equi, et bouis, aut uaccae: et sit filum forte, et duplica extremitatem acus parumper, et fige eam in medio ungulae: et penetra eam cum acu, et liga cum filo ungulam, et extende eam ad superiora: et excoria cum pilo latus ungulae quod sequitur pupillam, ac si tu serres eam cum pilo usque ad postreimnum eius.	 Then take the awl and insert a hair from the horse, ox or sheep into it, let it be a thread, and bend the end of the awl slightly, and fix it in the middle of the toenail: and pierce it with the awl, and tie the toenail with the thread, and extend it upward: and scrape with the hair the side of the toenail that follows the pupil, as if you were holding it with the hair until its end.
Deinde incide residuum in radice lachrymalis cum spatumili subtili, aut cum forficibus paruis: et dimitte carnem lachrymalis naturalem, ut non accidat ex incisione eius cursus lachrymarum assiduus.	 Then cut the remainder at the root of the tear duct with a sharp small knife or tweezers: and let out the natural skin of the tear duct so that there is not a persistent flow of tears from the incision.
Et quandoque extenditur ungula cum uncino solo: aut cum filo, sicut diximus.	 And sometimes the nail is extended with a spatula alone; or with thread, as we have said.
Deinde excoriatur cum spatumili leni, cuius haec est forma.	 Then it is scraped with a soft spatula, whose form is this.
Et caue, ne tangat spatumile tunicam corneam, et accidat in ea ruptura, et perforetur pupilla.	 Be careful, lest the spatula touches the horny coat and causes a break there, and the pupil is pierced through.
Deinde post incisionem, proice in oculum aliquid salis contriti, aut ex sief facto ex ziniar, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	 Then after the incision, cast into the eye something crushed salt or made from cumin and leave it for another day.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur.	 Then care for it as necessary until it heals.
Quod si ungula est non neruosa, et non potes intromittere in eam acum, neque figitur in ea uncinus, tunc multotiens curatur haec species ungulae cum medicinis, et sanatur sicut narraui in diuisione.	 If the nail is not nerve-connected and you cannot insert an awl into it nor does a spatula fit there, then this type of nail is repeatedly treated with medicines until it heals as I narrated in the division.
Quod si uis incidere eam, tunc aperi oculum infirmi, et accipe spatumile subtile, lene, debilis acuitatis, secundum hanc formam.	 If you wish to cut it (the nail), then open the eye of the sick person, and take a thin, soft, delicate, blunt spatula according to this shape:
Et rade ungulam desuper rasione cum subtilitate.	 And grind the nail from above with a sharp razor.
Quod si uides quod ipsa rarificatur et confringitur, et imprimit in eam rasio, tunc distilla ex hora tua in oculum ex sief facto ex ziniar, aut ex sief rubeo, aut sale trito: et opila oculum usque ad diem alium.	 If you see that it is becoming rarefied and crushed, and the razor presses upon it, then distill from your hour into the eye from cumin made of zinziber, or red cumin, or crushed salt; and close the eye until another day.
Deinde itera super ipsam operationem, donec remoueatur totum eius.	 Then repeat this procedure until the whole thing is removed.
Nisi contrarium sit tibi in oculo apostema calidum: tunc enim dimitte ipsam, et cura apostema, donec sanetur.	 Unless it should be a hot abscess in your eye, then leave the former and care for the abscess until it heals.
Deinde itera operationem super ipsam cum rasione, donec sanetur.	 Then repeat this procedure on it with the razor until it heals.
Eminentia autem carnis lachrymalis, si nocet in oculo nocumento magno, suspendatur cum uncino, et incide ex ea partem eius: et non ultimes incisionem, ut non accidat cursus lachrymarum.	 However, a growth of flesh near the tear-duct, if it causes great harm in the eye, is suspended with a spatula and cut from that part of it; not to the end, so as not to interrupt the flow of tears.
Deinde stilla in lachrymale sief rubeum, aut factum ex ziniari, donec sanetur.	 Then milk, whether white or red, or made from cheese, should be applied until it heals.
¶ De incisione Alguardenic, et carne nata in oculo.	 On incision of the eyelid, and flesh born in the eye.
Caput XVII.	 Chapter XVII.
Nascitur quandoque in quibusdam oculis hominum caro rubea composita, uel superposita, donec cooperit pupillam, aut appropinquat, aut stringit super palpebras, et fortasse conuertit palpebras ad exteriora: et assimilatur rosae balaustinae.	 There sometimes arises in certain human eyes red flesh composed or laid over, until it covers the pupil, approaches, or contracts upon the eyelids and perhaps turns the eyelids towards the outside; and it resembles a rosebush.
Et operatio in ea etiam est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	 And the treatment for it is that the weak one should place his head in your lap.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et collige illam carnem totam cum uncinis conuenientibus ad illud: et tene illud cum forcipe uno, aut gesti.	 Then open the eyes of that person and collect all that flesh together with appropriate forceps; and hold it with one forceps or scissors.
Deinde incide carnem in primis, donec finiatur totum eius cum incisorio.	 Then make an incision in the flesh first, until you have finished cutting it all off with a knife.
Et caue ab oculo, ut non laedas ipsum apud operationem: et sit incisio tua qua ipsam incidis, aut cum spatumili, quod narrauimus in incisione ungulae: aut cum forficibus paruis, cum quibus colligitur asebel, secundum quod ueniet forma eius post hoc capitulum.	 Be careful not to harm the eye during the operation; and let your cut be such as we described in the incision of the nail, or with small forceps, as are used for extracting an asebel [a kind of cyst], according to what its form will be after this chapter.
Cum ergo completur incisio tua, et remouetur tota alguardenici, tunc imple oculum ex sale contrito: aut distilla in eum puluerem rubeum, et similia illi ex medicinis corrosiuis: et pone super oculum deforis cottum cum albugine oui: ut securetur ab apostemate calido.	 When your incision is completed and the entire alguardenic [the red flesh] is removed, then fill the eye with ground salt or pour in a reddish powder and similar substances from corrosive medicines; and place on the outside of the eye a warm cloth with egg white to protect it from infection.
Quod si remanet ex alguardenici aliquid, et dominatur tibi sanguis calidus, et times apostema calidum: tunc dimitte oculum, et cura ipsum cum eo quod sedat apostema.	 If any part of the alguardenic remains or if a hot blood flows and you fear a hot infection, then leave the eye alone and treat that which cures an abscess.
Deinde itera super ipsum cum operatione, donec sanetur.	 Then repeat the procedure until it heals.
Et similiter fac cum carne addita quae accidit in oculo ex hac specie.	 And do similarly with the added flesh that occurs in the eye of this kind.
Verumtamen oportet, ut alienes curationem omnis oculi debilis ex uia naturali, aut ex uia accidentali, operando cum ferro: et non intromittas manum tuam in aliqua harum operationum, donec uideas, quod illud membrum est tolerans illam operationem.	 It is necessary that every weak eye of an alien, whether by natural or accidental way, be treated with iron; and you shall not insert your hand into any of these operations until you see that the member can endure such operation.
¶ De collectione Sebel ex oculo.	 On collecting Sibel from the eye.
Caput XVIII.	 Chapter XVIII.
Sebel sunt uenae rubeae quae texuntur super oculum, et prohibent uisui operationem suam: et debilitant oculum cum longitudine dierum.	 Chapters on Sibel (red veins over the eye that hinder vision and weaken the eye over days).
Necesse est ergo tibi in primis, ut consideres, si oculus in quo est Sebel, est fortis, et non est in eo aegritudo aliqua, praeter Sebel: tunc collige Sebel eius.	 Therefore it is necessary that first you consider if the eye with Sibel is strong and there is no other disease except Sibel; then collect Sibel from it.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo.	 And it is to command the weak person to place his head on your chest.
Deinde suspende illas uenas cum uncino uno, aut duobus secundum prudentiam tuam: et sit uncinus subtilis duplationis, secundum hanc formam, aut sint duo uncini gradat in corpore uno, secundum hanc formam.	 Then suspend those veins with a single hook or two according to your judgment; and let the hook be subtle and double, in this shape, or there should be two hooks in one body, in this shape.
Deinde collige cum forficibus subtilibus illas uenas cum subtilitate, et absterge sanguinem hora post horam, donec uideas illas uenas remoueri ex oculo, et resoluuntur: et caue ne laedas oculum cum extremitatibus spatumilis.	 Then collect with subtle forceps those veins and remove blood hour by hour until you see the veins are removed from the eye and resolved; and beware not to harm the eye with the points of the forceps.
Et sit operatio tua in meridie coram sole, et sis firmus in operatione tua ualde: ut non incidas nisi illas uenas.	 And let your operation be at midday facing the sun, and be very firm during your operation so as not to cut except the veins.
Et cum tu expleueris, tunc distilla in oculum sief uiride, aut rubeum: ut sua acuitate corrodat quod remansit ex sebel.	 And when you have finished, then distill into the eye either green or red; so that it burns what remains from Sibel with its own acidity.
Si autem non est tibi possibile colligere illud totum in illa hora, tunc emplastra oculum cum eo, quod sedat dolorem oculi: et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur dolor eius: et securetur ab apostemate calido: deinde itera super ipsum secundum modum eundem, donec sanetur.	 If it is not possible for you to collect all of it in that hour, then plaster the eye with what soothes the pain of the eye; and leave it for several days until the pain subsides; then cover it warmly; afterward apply it again in the same way until it heals.
Et haec est forma forficis.	 This is the form of a pair of forceps.
¶ De reductione Arissati ad nasum.	 On reducing an Ariessus (nasal polyp) to the nose.
Caput XIX.	 Chapter XIX.
Nominant medici Arissati Fistulam, quam curas cum cauterio, aut cum medicina acuta comburente, secundum quod praecessit eius narratio.	 The surgeon named Arisset cures a fistula with cautionery or sharp medicine burning, according to the narrative that precedes it.
Et si non sanatur, tunc non est ingenium in ea: nisi ut findas super apostema apud natiuitatem eius, et extrahas totam humiditatem quae est in eo et pus, donec detegatur os.	 If it is not cured, then there is no skill in it, unless to find upon the abscess at its birth and draw out all the moisture that is in it and pus, until the bone appears.
Cum ergo detegitur os, et uides in eo corruptionem, aut nigredinem, tunc rade ipsum cum instrumento, cuius forma est haec.	 When the bone appears, and you see corruption or blackness in it, then file it with an instrument whose shape is this.
Et nominatur Asperi capitis.	 It is called the rasping of the skull.
Fiat ex ferro indo, et sit caput eius rotundum sicut azir, quod sit punctatum punctatione limae, aut punctatione aliskilferi punctatione subtili: et pone ipsum super locum corruptum ossis.	 Make it from iron and its head should be round like an azir (a type of file), pierced with the punctations of a rasp or a fine, subtle rasp; and place it on the corrupted bone.
Deinde reuolue ipsum inter digitos tuos, et tu preme manum tuam parumper, donec scias quod illa corruptio iam rasa est: et fac illud aliquotiens.	 Then move it back and forth with your fingers, and press your hand gently on it until you know that the corruption is now filed away; do this repeatedly.
Deinde restaura locum cum medicinis exiccatiuis stipticis.	 Then restore the place with most powerful astringents.
Si ergo consolidatur locus, et nascitur in eo caro, et abscinditur cursus saniei: et remanet quadraginta diebus, et non renouatur, et non apostematur, et non accidit in eo accidens: tunc scias quia iam sanatus est.	 If the place consolidates and flesh grows there, and the course of pus is cut off; and it remains for forty days without recurring, without abscessing, and no incident occurs in it; then you know that it has been cured.
Et si non, tunc non est in eo ingenium, nisi reducere fistulam ad foramen nasi, secundum hanc formam.	 If not, then there is no skill in it, unless to reduce the fistula to the nostril opening, according to this shape:
Et est, ut detegas ab osse secundo cum ferro, aut cum medicina acuta: et cum detectum est os, tunc accipe terebrum secundum hanc formam, sit extremitas ferrea, triangulata: et lignum eius sit pyramis extenuata usque ad extremitatem, sicut uides.	 It is to expose the second bone with iron or sharp medicine; and when the bone is exposed, then take a trepan (a surgical instrument for boring a hole in the skull) according to this shape: its tip should be iron, triangular; and its handle should be a pyramid extended to the tip, as you see.
Deinde pone illud super os ipsum: et sit illud prope lachrymale: et elonga manum tuam ab oculo parum.	 Then place it on the bone itself; and let it be close to the lacrimal (eye tear duct); and extend your hand slightly from the eye.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum terebro, donec penetret os, et sentiat illud infirmus: per hoc quod inuenit uentum exire ex eo, quando tenet manum suam super nasum suum.	 Then turn your hand with the lancet until it penetrates the bone and feels weak; by this, when you hold your hand over his nose, you will know that wind is coming out from it.
Ergo tunc restaura locum cum medicinis stipticis exiccantibus, sicut docui te.	 Therefore, restore the place with cauterizing medicines, as I have taught you.
Cum ergo nascitur caro, et induratur locus: tunc materia quae effundebatur ad exteriora, redit ad nasum: est ergo leuius illud super infirmum.	 When the flesh is born and the place hardens; then the matter that was flowing outwards returns to the nose; it is therefore lighter above the weak one.
¶ De reductione eminentiae Oculi.	 Chapter on Reducing Protrusions of the Eye.
Caput XX.	 Chapter 20.
Quando eminet Oculus cum totalitate sua, et non accidit in uisu nocumentum, neque diminutio: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum: deinde phlebotomes eum: postea ponas uentosas in ceruice absque scarificatione, sed cum suctione.	 When the eye protrudes completely and there is no damage to vision nor decrease; then it is necessary to loosen the weak one. Then apply leeches. Afterwards, place poultices on the neck without scarification but with suction.
Deinde pone super Oculum linimentum quod fit ex acacia, et aloe, et olibano, et sarcocolla.	 Then place over the eye a liniment made from acacia, aloes, frankincense and gum Arabic.
Deinde stringe Oculum desuper super emplastrum cum puluillis multis.	 Then bind the eye on top with plasters full of many fleas.
Et modus puluillorum est: ut accipias pannos lenes, multos, et duplicetur omnis pannus ex eis super quatuor: fac ex eis multos: deinde pone eos unum super alium, secundum quantitatem qua indiget Oculus: deinde stringe super ipsos cum panno duro strictura forti.	 And the method of fleas is: that you take soft cloths, many, and fold each one four times; make many from them; then place one on top of another according to the size that the eye needs; then bind them together with a strong bandage.
Et itera uentosas cum suctione sine scarificatione.	 And repeat the poultices without scarification but with suction.
Deinde aufer uentosas, et dimitte oculum strictum die et nocte.	 Then remove the poultices and let the eye be bound day and night.
Si autem ligamentum iterum mollificatur, tunc oportet ut stringatur multum: deinde aufer ligamentum post diem et noctem, sicut diximus.	 If the binding becomes soft again, then it is necessary to bind it tightly; then remove the binding after a day and night, as said before.
Si ergo uides oculum iam redisse uuae tunicae, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam, et uentosas, donec sanetur.	 If you see that the eye has returned to its usual color; it is good; and if not, then repeat the poultices, fleas, bindings, and poultices until it heals.
¶ De incisionie Vuae tunicae.	 On the incision of the tunica vaginae.
Caput XXI.	 Concerning the extraction of the stone from the bladder
Quando accidit disruptio in tunica Vuea, deinde eminet et procedit extra palpebras sicut granum Vuae, et foedatur forma hominis propter illud, et uis incidere illud: tunc operatio in eo est, secundum quod narro: et est, ut intromittas acum in radice Vuae ab inferiori ad superiorem partem.	 When the bladder is ruptured, then the stone comes out like a grain of the vagina and stains the human form because of it, and there is a desire to incise it: then the operation should be performed on it, as I have told you before; it is to insert a pointed instrument from the root of the bladder, from the lower part to the upper part.
Deinde intromitte acum aliam in qua sit filum duplum a parte lachrymalis, et fac eam penetrare: et dimitte acum primam secundum dispositionem suam.	 Then insert another pointed instrument with a double thread from the lachrymal side and make it penetrate; then release the first needle according to its position.
Deinde incide locum fili dupli, et liga cum eo partem Vuae in circumitu acus: et stringe eam multum.	 Then cut the place of the double thread and tie a part of the bladder around the needle; and pull it tightly.
Deinde extrahe acum, et pone super oculum lanam infusam in albugine oui: et dimitte eum, donec cadat filum cum Vua.	 Then take out the needle and place wool soaked in oil on the eye; and release it until the thread comes out with the bladder.
Deinde cura oculum cum eo, quod confortat ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	 Then take care of the eye, because it is comforting to itself, until the wound heals.
Et quandoque stringitur Vua ab omni parte cum circulo ex panno, donec addat oculus eminentiam magnam.	 And sometimes the bladder is tightened from all sides with a bandage made of cloth until the eye protrudes greatly.
Deinde perforetur cum spatumili subtili, quod perueniat ad profundum oculi, et currat humiditas albuginea, et descendat oculus, et ingrediatur statim: deinde stringe eum, donec sanetur.	 Then it should be pierced with a sharp instrument so that it reaches the depth of the eye and the moisture of the eyeball is let out, and the eye descends and enters immediately; then tighten it until it heals.
¶ De curatione Alcomnati.	 On the treatment of ulcers.
Caput XXII.	 Concerning the operation for removing a piece from a malignant
Haec Aegritudo quae nominatur Alcomnati, non, est nisi sanies, quae aggregatur in oculo, similis aquae descendenti, et non est ipsa.	 This disease called Alcomnati is nothing but pus that accumulates in the eye, similar to water descending and it itself is not.
Et modus operandi in ea est, ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem praeparatum, uel directum.	 And the way of operating on it is for the sick person to sit on a prepared chair or directly.
Deinde accipe caput eius manibus tuis a partibus duabus, et moue ipsum, donec uideas saniem peruenire ad inferiora oculis tuis.	 Then take the head with both your hands from two sides and move it until you see pus reaching the lower part of your eyes.
Deinde figatur, et non descendat, et absoluatur lumen: et uideat infirmus res sicut uidebat: et si non descendit inferius, scias quia est aqua.	 Then it figures and does not descend, and the light is freed: and let the sick one see as he saw before: and if it does not descend lower, know that there is water.
Si autem non praeparatur descensus saniei cum eo quod diximus, tunc fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas.	 If the descent of pus is not prepared with what I have said, then make the sick one sit between your hands.
Deinde accipe spatumile subtile, et finde cum eo supra panniculum corneum parumper apud continuationem coniunctiuae cum tunica cornea in corona, donec egrediatur sanies.	 Then take a subtle spathule and bore with it on the cornified cushion near the junction of the conjunctiva with the corneal layer at the crown, until pus comes out.
Cum ergo egreditur, tunc distilla in oculum aquam calidam in qua miscuisti mel: aut aquam in qua iam bullisti foenumgraecum et mel: deinde curetur cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 When it comes out, then pour warm water mixed with honey into the eye, or warm water in which you have already cooked barley and honey; then treat it with the remaining treatment until it is healed.
¶ De cura aquae, quae descendit in oculo, uel cataracta.	 Chapter on the treatment of water that descends into the eye, or cataract.
Caput XXIII.	 Chapter XXIII.
Iam Diximus species aquae in diuisione, et quae conuenit ad perforandum sermone declarante et exponente, tunc accipe illud idem secundum sanitatem.	 We have said the type of water in division, and what suits for perforating with a declaring and explaining speech, then take it according to health.
Tunc ergo oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas quadratum, oppositum lumini, prope solem: et liga oculum eius sanum, et stringe eum ualde: deinde palpebram oculi eius manu tua dextra, si oculus in quo est aqua, est oculus sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	 Then it is necessary that you make the sick one sit between your hands with a square position facing the light and near the sun; tie his healthy eye, and squeeze it very hard; then close the eye of the water with your right hand, if the eye in which there is water is the left eye; or with your left hand, if the eye is the right.
Deinde accipe manu tua dextra almagda, si oculus est sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	 Then take your right hand (if the affected eye is the left) or your left hand (if the affected eye is the right).
Deinde pone extremitatem almagda prope coronam per grossitudinem radii in ipsa albedine oculi apparente lachrymalis minoris: deinde impelle almagda cum uirtute: et tu reuoluis cum eo manum tuam, donec penetret in albuginem oculi: et sentias, quod almagda iam peruenit ad rem uacuam.	 Then place the tip of your thumb near the crown and the thickness of a radish on the white part of the eye visible as the smaller lachrymal; then push with power; and you revolve your hand together, until it penetrates into the cornea of the eye; and feel that your thumb has reached an empty place.
Et oportet, ut sit mensura itineris almagda ad profundum, mensura spacii quod est a pupilla usque ad finem nigredinis: et est corona oculi.	 And it is necessary that the measure of the journey (of an instrument) be large enough for depth, the measurement of the space from the pupil to the end of blackness; and it is the eye's corona.
Uidebis enim ea in ipsa pupilla uisione oculi, propter claritatem tunicae corneae.	 You will see (the line) in the very pupil of the eye, on account of the clarity of the cornea layer.
Deinde pone almagda usque ad locum in quo est aqua.	 Then place (the instrument) large enough to reach where there is water.
Deinde preme ipsum inferius uice una post aliam.	 Then press it downward once after another.
Si ergo descendit aqua statim, tunc infirmus uidet illud super quod aperit uisum suum statim, et almagda in oculo suo.	 If therefore water flows out immediately, then the sick one sees (the object) above what opens his vision immediately, and large enough in his own eye.
Deinde quiescas paululum.	 Then rest for a while.
Si ergo descendat aqua, tunc depone eam secundo, praeter quod egrediatur almagda.	 If water flows out again, then remove it (the instrument) after it has flowed out large enough.
Quando ergo figitur, et non ascendit: tunc extrahe almagda cum facilitate: et tu reuoluis manum tuam paulatim.	 When it is stuck and does not rise up: then remove large enough with ease; and you turn your hand slowly.
Deinde dissolue in aqua aliquid ex sale claro gemmae: et ablue cum eo oculum deintus.	 Then dissolve something from clear salt in water, and clean the eye within with it.
Deinde pone extra oculum totum stuppam, aut lanam infusam oleo rosato, et albugine oui: et liga cum eo oculum sanum.	 Then place outside the eye the whole of wool soaked in rose oil and white egg yolk; and bind with it the healthy eye.
Nos autem, et illi qui sunt nostri temporis, ponimus super eum ciminum tritum cum albumine oui.	 We and those who are of our time place over him (the affected part) crushed cumin with egg white.
Quod si non obedit tibi almagda ad introitum in oculum propter duriciem suam, quoniam ex hominibus est, cuius oculus est durus ualde: tunc oportet ut accipias spatumile, quod nominatur Alberid, cuius haec est forma.	 If large enough does not obey you in entering the eye because of its hardness, since it is a man whose eye is very hard: then it is necessary that you take a spatula, which is called Alberid, and this is its shape.
Pefora ergo cum eo ipsam coniunctiuam tantum, et non ultimes manum tuam in foramine: et non est nisi ut facias uiam ad almagda locum subtilem.	 Therefore bore only the conjunctiva with it (the instrument), and do not push your hand into the hole; and there is no other purpose but to make a subtle way to the large enough place.
Deinde intromitte almagda, secundum quod diximus.	 Then insert large enough, as we said.
Et apud complementum operis tui, praeparetur infirmo dormitorium decenter factum, in quo dormiat super dorsum suum in domo tenebrosa: et prohibeatur ab omnibus motibus, et a tussi: et pone cibum eius illud quo lenitur natura eius: et non moueat caput suum dextra, neque sinistra omnino.	 On the completion of your work, prepare for the sick one a bed well-made, in which he may sleep on his back in a dark house; and prohibit from all movements, and from coughing: and place food for him such as soothes his nature; and do not move his head to right or left at all.
Et sit ligamentum secundum dispositionem suam usque ad diem tertium.	 And let the suture be according to its arrangement until the third day.
Deinde solue illud in illa domo tenebrosa, et experire uisum eius: et fac eum uidere res.	 Then dissolve it in that dark dwelling, and test its sight: make it see things.
Deinde reduc ligamentum usque ad diem septimum.	 Then bring the suture back until the seventh day.
Et non oportet ut faciat illud in hora curationis, aut post incisionem statim: imo oportet, ut alienes illud: propterea quod aqua ascendit uelociter per aspectum uehementem.	 It is not proper for him to do it during the hour of cure, or immediately after incision; rather, let a stranger do it: therefore, because water rises quickly through a violent wound.
Si autem accidit apostema calidum: tunc oportet ut soluas oculum ante septimum: et rectifica illud cum eo quod sedat apostema, donec sedatur: tunc absolue ipsius uisum, et pone super faciem eius orale quo regatur uisus eius sub eo diebus aliquot, ipso existente in illa domo tenebrosa.	 If however a hot abscess occurs: then it is necessary that you dissolve the eye before the seventh day; and correct it with what soothes the abscess, until the abscess subsides; then remove its sight, and place over his oral cavity what regulates his vision for some days, while he remains in that dark dwelling.
Deinde egrediatur a domo gradatim, et conuersetur in casis suis.	 Then let him go out of the house gradually, and convert himself to his cases (bandages).
Et scias, quod in zaltea non excusatur discipulus a uisione aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super operationem.	 And know that in the case of lancets, the student is not permitted to look away from the sight often; then he dares upon the operation.
Et iam quidem peruenit ad nos quidam ex illis qui sunt de Alayrach, qui dixit, quod factum fuit in Alayrach magdan perforatum, quo sugitur aqua.	 And indeed, one of them who are from Aleppo has reached us, who said that a large cistern was made in Aleppo, through which water is drawn.
Verum ergo non uidi aliquem in terra uostra, qui fecerit illud: neque legi illud in aliquo ex libris antiquorum: et est possibile, ut sit illud nouum.	 Therefore, I have not seen anyone in your land who made that; nor have I read it in any ancient books; and it is possible that it is new.
Et istae sunt formae specierum ex magda, ut stet super ea qui ea ignorat.	 These are the forms of the species from the large cistern, to stand over him who does not know them.
Fiant ex aere proprie: et sint extremitates eorum cum hac eadem subtilitate triangulatae, et extremitas acuta.	 Make them of bronze; and let their ends be with this same triangular subtlety, and the end sharp.
Formae magda.	 Large cisterns (or forms).
¶ De cura Carnis natae in naso.	 Chapter on the care of born flesh in the nose.
Caput XXIIII.	 Chapter XXIII.
Quandoque nascuntur in naso Carnes diuersae additae, ex quibus est aliquid quod assimilatur scorpioni multorum pedum: et ex ea est caro cancerosa, lapidea, fusci coloris: et ex ea est quae est caro lenis, non fusci coloris.	 Whenever diverse fleshes are born in the nose, among which there is something resembling a scorpion of many feet; and from that is the cancerous flesh, stone-like, dark colored; and from that is the soft flesh, not dark colored.
In ea ergo quae ex istis carnibus est lenis, non fraudulenta, neque cancerosa, oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas oppositum soli, et aperi nares eius, et proiice uncinum in illas carnes: deinde trahe eas ad exteriora, et incide quod comprehendisti ex eis cum spatumili subtili acuto a parte una, donec scias quod caro tota iam ablata est.	 Therefore, for the soft flesh among these, not fraudulent, nor cancerous, it is necessary that you make the patient sit opposite the sun with his nose open, and throw a hook into those fleshes; then draw them out towards the exterior, and cut what you have grasped from them with a thin subtle spatula on one side until you know that all the flesh has been removed.
Quod si remaneret aliquid ex ea cuius abscisio non est possibilis: tunc rade illud cum uno instrumentorum subtilium cum facilitate, donec non remaneat ex eo aliquid.	 If something remains of that which cannot be removed: then shave it with one subtle instrument with ease until nothing is left from it.
Si autem sanguis tibi dominatur, aut accidat apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei per id quod oportet: aut est ex apostematibus malignis, tunc propera cauterizando eum, donec abscindatur sanguis, et auferantur omnes carnes.	 If blood dominates you or a hot abscess occurs: then oppose it with what is necessary; or if it is from malignant abscesses, then hasten to cauterize him until the blood is separated and all fleshes are removed.
Deinde proiiciatur in nasum post incisionem acetum, et aqua, aut uinum.	 Then vinegar, or water, or wine should be thrown into the nose after the incision.
Si autem aperitur nasus, et procedat ex eo humiditas usque ad palatum, tunc scias quia iam sanus est.	 If the nose opens and moisture proceeds to the palate, then you know that he is already well.
Si uero non penetrat humiditas, secundum quod oportet, tunc scias quod intra ipsum est caro nata in superioribus ossibus naris, ad quae non peruenit cum incisione instrumentum.	 If the moisture does not penetrate as it should be, then you know that within him there is flesh born in the upper bones of the nose, which was not reached by the incision instrument.
Tunc ergo oportet, ut intromittas filum lini cui sit quaedam grossitudo, et noda in eo nodos multos: et pone inter omnem nodum quantitatem digiti, aut minus: et ingeniet infirmus, ut mittat extremitatem unam fili in nasum cum radio, aut cum quo possibile est ei postquam fecerit ipsum simile azer: et trahat odoratum suum, donec perueniat usque ad caassum, et egrediatur super guttur suum.	 Then it is necessary to insert a linen thread with some thickness and many knots; and place between each knot an amount equal to or less than a finger: and make the patient do it so that he sends one end of the thread into the nose with a rod, or with whatever is possible for him after he has made himself similar to an azer [a surgical instrument]; and draw out the smell until it reaches the back, and come out on his throat.
Et multotiens quidem faciunt simile huic Attomi pueri in scholis: et est res facilis ei, qui uult.	 And indeed often do boys in schools make this like that of Attotus; and it is a matter easy to him who wishes.
Deinde pone duas extremitates fili, extremitatem unam quae egreditur super nasum, et alteram quae remansit in naso.	 Then place two ends of the string, one which comes out on the nose, and the other which remains inside the nose.
Deinde ac ministra serraturam carnis cum nodis qui sunt in filo.	 Then, as an assistant, the skin incision with the knots that are in the thread.
Fac illud donec scias quod carnes iam sunt cum nodis fili.	 Do this until you know that the flesh is now with the thread knots.
Deinde extrahe filum: et pone in nasum post abstersionem sanguinis licinium quod imbibisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud tribus diebus, aut plus, donec unguentum corrodat totum quod remansit ex carnibus.	 Then withdraw the thread; and place on the nose after bleeding linen which you have soaked in Egyptian ointment; do this for three days or more until the ointment has completely dissolved all that remains of the flesh.
Deinde pone in fine rei in nasum cannulam de plumbo, diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	 Then place at the end of the procedure a lead cannula into the nose for some days until it heals.
Si autem indiget curatione quae exiccet, utere illa.	 If however it requires drying treatment, use that.
Ad caputpurgium faciendum, cum quo distillantur olea, et aliae medicinae in nasum, fac illud ex argento, aut aere: quod sit simile lampadi paruae, apertum sicut conchula: et meatus eius similiter.	 For making the head-pouring when olive oil and other medicines are distilled into the nose, make it from silver or brass; which is similar to a small lantern, open like a snail's shell; and the channel should be similarly shaped.
Et si uis fac cannulam clausam, sicut canna.	 And if you wish to make a closed cannula, do so like a reed.
Et conchula instrumenti ad caputpurgium faciendum, sit plena, detecta: cui sit manubrium in postremo eius, cum quo teneas ipsam, quando calefacis in ea oleum, aut quod uis ex succis, et rebus fluxibilibus.	 And the snail-shell instrument for head-pouring should be full and perforated; which has a handle at the end, with which you hold it when heating oil or whatever you wish in it, and liquids that flow easily.
Et haec est forma instrumenti.	 And this is the form of the instrument.
¶ De cura Thelul nasi.	 Chapter on the treatment of a deviated nose.
Caput XXV.	 Chapter XXV.
Multotiens nascitur in extremitate nasi Thelul, et magnificatur, et augmentatur cum diebus, donec foedus fit aspectus eius.	 Often a Thelul is born at the end of the nose and grows and increases with days until it becomes unsightly to look at it.
Et propter illud oportet, ut in cidas illud in principio apparitionis eius, et eradices totum eius.	 And for this reason, it is necessary to cut it off at the beginning of its appearance and remove all of it.
Deinde pone super locum, aut cauterium, aut medicinam comburentem quae stat loco eius.	 Then place on the spot, either a cautery or a medicine burning in its place.
Si ergo tardatur incisio eius, donec magnificetur, tunc considera, si est lapideum, durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro: quoniam apostema est cancerosum.	 If the incision does not progress as expected until it is enlarged, then consider if it is hard, of a dark color and few senses; then do not touch it with iron, because it is a cancerous ulcer.
Multotiens enim uidi, qui incidit hmoni apostema, et accidit ex eo malicia magna super illum qui ipsum habebat.	 For often I have seen that one who has cut an abscess has encountered great evil upon the one who possessed it.
Et si apostema est lenis tactus, non fusci coloris, et uides quod incisio possibilis est in toto eius, tunc euacua infirmum, et incide ipsum sine timore, absque pauore: et cura locum cum eo quod exiccat et constringit, donec sanetur.	 And if the abscess is soft when touched and not dark in color, and you see that it is possible to cut through it entirely, then evacuate the weakened part, and cut it without fear or hesitation; and care for the place with it so that it drains and constricts until it heals.
¶ De sutura nasi, et labii, et auris.	 Chapter on stitching the nose, lip, and ear.
Caput XXVI.	 Chapter 26.
Scias Quia quando accidit solutio continuitatis in una harum cartilaginum, parum confert in ea operatio, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	 Know that when continuity of one of these cartilages is disrupted, the operation does little good, unless in some men.
Oportet ergo quando accidit alicui aliquid ex illo, ut consideres, si est uulnus recens cum sanguine suo: et tunc aggrega duolabia uulneris cum sutura: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Therefore when something happens to anyone from one of these, you should consider if it is a fresh wound with its own blood; and then join together the edges of the wound with stitching; then care for it until it heals.
Et si solutionis continuitatis labia iam separata sunt, et facta est unaquaeque pars sana: tunc oportet ut excories omnem partem a cute sua apparente, donec sanguinetur.	 And if continuity of the lips has been separated and each part has become healthy, then it is necessary to scrape off all the part appearing from its own skin until it bleeds.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cum sutura, et stringe ea, et pulueriza super ipsum sanguinem draconis, et olibanum trita: et pone supra pulueres frustum emplastri diafinicon, et alicuius alterius ex emplastris consolidatiuis: et dimitte ipsum ligatum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	 Then join together the two lips with stitching and bind them, and sprinkle over it powder of dragon's blood and pulverized olibanum; and place on top of the powders a fragment of plaster called diaphyton, and of another consolidating plaster; and leave it bound for two or three days.
Deinde solue ipsum, et permuta medicinam: et dimitte ipsum, donec abscindantur fila per se.	 Then dissolve it, and change the medicine; and leave it until the stitches are dissolved by themselves.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then care for yourself with an ointment until you are healed.
Modus autem suturae est, ut aggreges solutionem continuitatis, aut cum acubus, sicut narrauimus in sutura uentris: aut aggrega solutionem cum filo, sicut feci te scire.	 The method of suturing is to gather the solution of continuity, or with needles as we have mentioned in the abdomen suturing; or gather the solution with thread, as I told you before.
¶ De extractione nodorum labiorum.	 Chapter on the removal of lip nodes.
Caput XXVII.	 Chapter XXVII [of Albucasis's book].
Multis Quidem hominibus accidunt plaerumque in interioribus labiorum suorum apostemata dura similia granis herbi: et quaedam eorum minora, et maiora.	 Many people often have hard ulcers on the inside of their lips similar to the seeds of a plant; and some of them are smaller, and others larger.
Ergo oportet ut conuertas labium, et findas super omnem nodum eius, et suspendas ipsum cum uncino, et incidas ipsum ab omni parte.	 Therefore, it is necessary to turn the lip and search for every node on it; and hang it with a hook and cut it in all directions.
Deinde impleas locum post incisionem zegi trito, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 Then fill the place after the incision with boiled vinegar until blood is separated.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto, et curetur locus cum eo, in quo est stipticitas, usquequo sanentur uulnera.	 Then clean with vinegar, and care for the place where there is stiffness until the wounds heal.
¶ De incisione carnis natae super gingiuam.	 Chapter on incising the skin of a newborn baby over the gum.
Caput XXVIII.	 Chapter XXVIII [of Albucasis's book].\]  Mult
Multotiens nascitur super gingiuam caro addiat, quam antiqui nominant abuluss.	 Many times flesh is born above the gum, which the ancients called ablus.
Oportet ergo ut suspendas eam cum uncino: aut teneas eam cum forcipibus, et incidas eam apud radicem suam, et dimittas saniem currere, aut sanguinem.	 Therefore, it is necessary to hang it with a hook; or hold it with forceps and cut it at the root and let pus run out or blood.
Deinde pone super locum zegi tritum, aut alios pulueres stipticos, exiccatiuos.	 Then place on top of it boiled vinegar or other stiffening powders, dried.
Quod si redit illa caro post curationem, nam multotiens redit, tunc incide eam secundo, et cauteriza ipsam: ipsa namque non redit post cauterium.	 If that flesh returns after treatment, many times it returns, then cut it a second time and burn it; for it does not return after burning.
¶ De rasione Dentium cum ferro.	 Chapter on tooth shaving with iron.
Caput XXIX.	 Chapter XXIX [of Albucasis's book].\] 
Quandoque aggregantur in superficiebus Dentium ab interiori et extetiori parte, et inter gingiuas cortices asperi, turpes, et quandoque denigrantur, et citrini fiunt, et uirides, donec peruenit ex illo corruptio ad gingiuam, et foedi fiunt dentes per illud.	 Sometimes cavity forms on the surfaces of teeth from inside and outside and between gums with rough cortex; and sometimes they turn yellow and green, and when corruption reaches to the gum, and they become foul teeth through that.
Oportet ergo ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et caput eius in sinu tuo, et rade molam et dentem, in quo apparent tibi cortices, et res similis arenae: donec non remaneat ex eis aliquid, et similiter fac de nigredine, et uiriditate, et citrinitate, et aliis donec mundentur.	 Therefore it is necessary that you make the sick man sit between your hands, and his head in your bosom, and scrape the mole and tooth, where the bark appears to you, like sand: until nothing remains of them, and similarly do with blackness, and greenness, and citron-color, and others until they are cleaned.
Si ergo auferatur quod in eis est a principio rasionis, bonum est: et si non, tunc itera super eos rasionem die alio, secundo, et tertio, donec ad ultimum perueniat studium in eo quod uis.	 If what is in them is removed at the beginning of the reasoning, it is good: if not, then repeat the reasoning upon them on another day, on the second, and on the third, until finally the study comes to that which you desire.
Et scias, quod dens indiget rasoriis diuersarum formarum, multarum figurarum: secundum quod praeparatur operationi tuae: proptera, quod rasorium quo raditur dens ab inferiori parte, est aliud a rasorio quo raditur inter dentes, secundum formas alias.	 And know that the tooth requires scapellers of various shapes and forms, according to which it is prepared for your operation: because the scapeller with which the tooth is scraped from below is different from the scapeller with which the tooth is scraped between the teeth, according to other shapes.
Et istae formae rasoriorum sint apud te praeparatae, quas uides.	 And these shapes of the scapellers be prepared by you, which you see.
¶ De extractione doloris Dentium.	 Chapter on the extraction of tooth pain.
Caput XXX.	 Chapter 30.
Oportet ut cures Dentem a dolore suo cum omni ingenio, et tardes in eradicatione eius.	 It is necessary that you cure the tooth from its pain with all your skill, and you are slow in its extraction.
Non est enim quod uicem eius suppleat quando eradicatur: quoniam est substantia sublimis: donec quando non est excusatio de eradicatione eius, tunc oportet quando cogitur infirmus eradicare ipsum, ut firmetur, et certificetur apud te dens dolens.	 For there is no substitute for it when it is extracted, since it is a lofty substance: until there is no excuse for the extraction of it, then if the sick man is compelled to extract it himself, he must be made firm and certain by you that the painful tooth is to be extracted.
Multotiens enim decipit infirmum dolor, et putat quia est in dente saha et eradicat ipsum: deinde non recedit dolor, donec eradicetur dens infirmus.	 For often pain deceives the sick man and he believes that there is wormwood in the tooth and extracts it himself: then the pain does not subside until the sick tooth is extracted.
Nos enim iam uidimus illud ex operatione phlebotomatorum.	 We have already seen this from the operation of phlebotomists.
Cum ergo certificatur apud te dens dolens ipsemet, tunc oportet ut scarifices in circumitu dentis cum spatumili, in quo sit quiddam uirtutis, donec soluatur gingiua ab omni parte: deinde moue ipsum digitis tuis, aut cum forcipibus subtilibus in primis paulatim, donec concutias ipsum.	 And when the sick man is made certain by you that the painful tooth is to be extracted, then it is necessary that you make an incision around the tooth with a spatula, in which there is something of virtue, until the gums are loosened from all sides: then move it with your fingers, or with subtle forceps firstly gently, until you shake it.
Deinde loca tunc in eo forcipes magnos locatione bona, et caput infirmi inter genua tua: quod iam bene tenuisti, ita quod non moueatur: deinde trahe dentem secundum rectitudinem, ut non frangas ipsum.	 Then place the large forceps well in those places [of the patient], and hold the head of the weak [patient] between your knees so that it does not move; then pull out the tooth along the straight path, so that you do not break it.
Si ergo non egreditur, tunc accipe aliquod illorum instrumentorum, et intromitte ipsum sub eo ab omni parte cum facilitate, et conare motionem eius, sicut fecisti in primis.	 If it does not come out [the tooth], then take one of those instruments and insert it under it from all sides with ease, and try to move it as you did at first.
Si autem dens est perforatus, aut corrosus: tunc oportet ut impleas illud foramen panno: et stringas ipsum cum extremitate radii subtilis, ut non frangatur in hora constrictionis tuae super ipsum cum forcipibus.	 If the tooth is perforated or corroded: then it is necessary to fill that hole with a cloth and bind it with the end of a thin radius so that it does not break during your hour of extraction with forceps.
Et oportet, ut exquisite agas cum scarificatione in circumitu gingiuae ab omni parte multum.	 And you should take great care with the incision around the gums from all sides.
Et custodi fortitudinem tuam, ut non frangas ipsum, et remaneat pars eius, et redeat super infirmum ex ea malicia quae sit maior dolore eius primo.	 And keep your strength so that you do not break it [the tooth] and leave a part of it, and return over the weak one with that greater pain which was first there.
Et caue, ne facias illud quod ignorantes faciunt phlebotomatores in festinatione sua, et audacia ipsorum super eradicationem eius, praeter quod administrent illud quod narrauimus.	 And be careful not to make the same mistake as ignorant bloodletters do in haste and their audacity with its removal, besides what I have told you [about administering something].
Multotiens enim faciunt euenire super homines infirmitates magnas, quarum difficiliores sunt ut frangantur, et remaneant radices eius omnes, aut quaedam earum: aut ut extrahant ipsum cum quibusdam ossibus mandibulae: sicut testificati sumus multotiens illud.	 For many times they bring great weaknesses upon men, which are difficult to break and leave all of its roots, or some of them; or they extract it with certain bones of the jaw, as we have often testified.
Deinde colluatur post eradicationem eius cum uino, aut cum aceto et sale.	 Then it is washed after its removal [of the tooth] with wine, or with vinegar and salt.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis ex locis (multotiens enim accidit) tunc tere aliquid ex zegi, et imple cum eo locum: et si non, cauteriza ipsum si non confert tibi zegi.	 If there should be bleeding from the place (for it often happens), then rub something with wax and fill the place; if not, cauterize it [the area] if you do not have wax.
Formae forcipum subtilium quibus mouetur dens in primis, sint longarum extremitatum, breuis manubrii, grossi, ut non duplicentur quando cum eis premitur super dentem: sint sicut uides grossorum manubriorum, donec quando stringis cum eis, non dent seipsas, neque duplicentur: breuium extremitatum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut ex faled decenter facti, directarum extremitatum: et in eorum extremitatibus sint dentes, quorum quidam ingrediantur in quosdam, et stringant constrictione decenti, forti.	 The tips of the fine forceps by which a tooth is moved should be long in length, short in handle, thick, so that they do not split when pressed upon the tooth; they should resemble the handles of large forceps, until when you tighten them, they do not bite themselves, nor split; the handles should be short, and made of iron or brass well-made, straight tips; and in their tips there should be teeth, some of which enter into certain places and tighten with a decent constriction, strong.
Et quandoque fiunt extremitates sicut forma oris auis quae nominatur ciconia, et sunt fortis constrictionis.	 And sometimes they (the veins) become like the shape of a bird's beak called ciconia, and are very constricted.
¶ De eradicatione Dentium, et extractione ossium mandibularum fractorum.	 On the extraction of teeth, and the removal of broken jaw bones.
Caput XXXI.	 Chapter 31.
Quando remanet apud eradicationem Dentis qui frangitur aliquid, tunc oportet ut ponas super locum cotum cum butyro die uno, aut duobus diebus, donec mollificetur locus: deinde intromitte ad ipsum algasti, aut forcipes: quorum extremitates assimilantur ori auis quae nominatur ciconia.	 When a piece remains in the socket of the tooth that is fractured, then it should be covered with lard on the spot for one or two days until the place softens; subsequently introduce into it algasti, or forceps: whose extremities are similar to the mouth of the bird named ciconia.
Forma autem haec est forcipum.	 The form of this is as follows (for the forceps):
Sint extremitates eorum factae sicut lima deintus: aut sicut aliskilfegi.	 The extremities are made as if with a rasp from within: or as if with an aliskilfegi.
Si ergo non obedit tibi ad exitum cum istis forcipibus, tunc oportet, ut caues super radicem, et detegas carnem totam, et intromittas instrumentum quod nominatur Palanca parua, cuius forma est haec.	 If, therefore, it does not obey you with these forceps, then it is necessary that you be cautious on the root and separate the entire flesh and introduce an instrument called a Small Palanca, whose shape is as follows.
Sit breuis extremitatis, grossae parumper: et non sit imbibitum, ut non frangatur.	 Let the end of it be short, somewhat thicker: and let it not be swollen so as not to break.
Si ergo egreditur radix per illud, est bonum: et si non, iuuare oportet cum istis instrumentis aliis quorum formae sunt istae.	 If, therefore, the root comes out through it, that is good; and if not, help with other instruments whose shapes are as follows.
Forma primi triangulatae extremitatis, in qua est quaedam grossitudo.	 The first shape is a triangle, in which there is some thickness.
Forma triangulatae extremitatis subtilis.	 The shape of the fine triangle.
Etiam iuuatur cum hoc instrumento habente duos ramos, cuius haec est forma.	 Also helps with this instrument having two branches, whose form is as follows.
Et cum aliis instrumentis et ferramentis quae praecesserunt in rasione dentium.	 And with other instruments and tools which preceded in the ratio of teeth.
Etiam sit iuuamentum cum hoc instrumento quod assimilatur uncino magno, huius formae, triangulatae extremitatis tortae, in qua est quiddam grossitudinis, ut non frangatur: et sit non imbibitum.	 And also helps with this instrument resembling a large nail, whose form is a twisted triangle, having some thickness to avoid breaking and not swollen.
Et scias, quod instrumenta dentium sunt multa: et similiter reliqua instrumenta non computantur, et artifex prudens, subtilis in arte sua inuenit per se ipsum instrumentum, secundum quod significant ei operatio et aegritudines ipsae.	 And know that there are many instruments for teeth: and similarly the other instruments are not counted, and the skilled craftsman, skillful in his art, finds himself an instrument according to what the operation signifies and the illnesses themselves.
Quoniam ex agritudinibus sunt ad quas non dixerunt antiqui instrumentum, propter diuersitatem specierum earum.	 Because of the variety in the types of ailments for which the ancients did not make an instrument.
Si autem frangatur os ex mandibula, aut ex aliis ossibus oris, aut putrefit: tunc perscrutare super ipsum in loco suo cum eo quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis et forcipibus quae dixi in extractione radicum, et iuuare cum gesti, cuius forma est haec.	 If the bone breaks from the jaw, or from other bones of the face, or rots: then examine it on its own place with that which is suitable for it from the instruments and forceps I mentioned for root extraction, and help with this gesture, whose shape is as follows.
Sit in eo quiddam grossitudinis paulatim, ut stringatur, uel teneatur cum eo os, et non fugiat et uadat, donec egrediatur os: et restaura locum cum medicinis conuenientibus ad illud.	 Let there be some thickness in it gradually, so that the bone can be held or tightened with it and not escape and move away until the bone comes out; and restore the place with suitable medicines for this.
Si autem in osse est putredo parua, tunc rade ipsum a putredine sua, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 If there is a little rottenness in the bone, then scrape it off from its rottenness, and treat it until it heals.
De serratura Dentium eminentium super alios.	 On the lock of projecting teeth over others.
Caput XXXII.	 Chapter XXXII.
Quando Dentes eminent non secundum cursum suum naturalem, foeda fit per illud forma: et praecipue quando accidit illud in mulieribus, et puellis, scilicet uenalibus.	 When teeth project not according to their natural course, the form becomes ugly because of it; and this is especially true when it happens in women and girls, namely in those who are menstruating.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	 Therefore, one must consider.
Nam si dens est natus post dentem alium, et non locatur, uel est possibilis eius serratura, neque limatura ipsius: tunc eradica ipsum: et si est annexus cum dente alio, tunc incide ipsum cum isto instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	 For if a tooth is born after another tooth, and it does not fit or its locking mechanism or grinding mechanism is possible, then pull it out; and if it is attached to another tooth, then cut it with this tool, the shape of which is as follows:
Est simile rostro paruo, et fit ex ferro indo, acutae extremitatis ualde.	 It resembles a small beak and is made from hard iron with a very sharp tip.
Et sit incisio tua qua ipsum incidis in diebus multis, et propter duriciem dentis, et ut non commoueatur alius ex dentibus.	 And your cut should be such that you cut it over many days, and because of the hardness of the tooth, so as not to disturb any other teeth.
Si autem est eminens expositus limaturae suae: tunc lima ipsum cum lima ex indo, cuius forma est haec.	 If it is a projecting tooth exposed to grinding, then grind it with a file made from iron, the shape of which is as follows:
Sit totum ex indo, et manubrium eius minutorum punctorum ualdae, sicut lima cum qua fiunt acus: cum quo limetur dens paulatim in diebus multis cum facilitate, ut non commoueatur dens, et cadat: deinde leni ipsum, in fine rade ipsum cum quibusdam rasoriis.	 The entire instrument is made of ivory, and its handle is small, full of large holes, like a file with which points are made: with which the hard tooth is gradually filed down over many days with ease, so that it is not disturbed, and falls out: then smooth it gently at the end, polish it with some files.
Quod si est dens, ex quo frangatur pars, et laedit linguam: tunc oportet ut limes eum etiam, donec auferatur asperitas illius fractionis, et aequetur: et applanetur, et non laedat linguam, neque corrumpat sermonem.	 If it is a tooth that breaks and injures the tongue, then it must be filed with a file until the roughness of the fracture is removed and it is made smooth; and it should not injure the tongue nor corrupt speech.
¶ De retatione Dentium cum filis auri.	 On filing teeth with gold filaments.
Caput XXXIII.	 Chapter XXXIII.
Quando accidit Dentibus anterioribus concussio et commotio a percussione, aut casu: et non potest infirmus stringere super illud quod comedit ut non cadat: et curasti eos cum medicinis stipticis, et non ualuit curatio: tunc ingenium in eis est, ut stringantur cum filo auri: quoniam argentum fit uiride, et putrefit post dies: sed aurum nunquam mutatur.	 When there is concussion and agitation of the front teeth due to a blow or accident, and a weak person cannot hold what he eats so that it does not fall out; and if you have treated them with medicinal adhesives, but the treatment has not helped: then it is appropriate for them to be bound with a gold filament, because silver turns green and decomposes after days, but gold never changes.
Et sit filum medium in subtilitate et grossicie secundum quantitatem quod capiat inter Dentes.	 And let the filament be of intermediate thickness and coarseness according to its quantity that it may hold between the teeth.
Et forma quidem retationis est, ut accipias filum, et intromittas duplum eius inter duos dentes sanos: deinde texeas cum duabus extremitatibus fili inter dentes motos, siue unus sit, aut plures, donec peruenias cum tela usque ad dentem sanum alterius partis.	 And the shape of filing is that you take the filament and insert its double between two healthy teeth; then wrap it with its ends around the mobile teeth, whether one or more, until you reach the healthy tooth on the other side with the needle.
Deinde itera texturam usque ad partem a qua incaepisti: et stringe manum tuam cum subtilitate et sapientia, donec non remoueatur prorsus: et sit constrictio tua qua stringis filum, apud radices dentium, ut non euadat.	 Then return the wrapping to the starting point; and bind your hand with delicacy and wisdom until it is not completely removed; and let your binding, which you bind the filament, be near the roots of the teeth so that it does not come off.
Deinde incide extremitates fili superfluentes cum forficibus: et aggrega utrumque, et conuerte eas cum gesti: et occulta ipsas inter dentem sanum et dentem motum, ut non laedat linguam: deinde dimittatur ita strictum dum remanet.	 Then cut off the excess ends of the filament with scissors; and bring together both, and fold them back with a twist; and hide these in between the healthy tooth and the mobile tooth so as not to injure the tongue; then release it when it is bound tight enough.
Si autem soluitur, aut inciditur, stringe eos cum filo alio, et stabit cum eo taliter tempore toto.	 If it is opened or cut open, bind them with another thread and let it remain in that state for the entire time.
Et haec est forma Dentium, et figura retationis duorum dentium sanorum, et duorum dentium motorum, sicut uides.	 This is the form of teeth, and the figure of the interlocking of two healthy teeth, and two moving teeth, as you see.
Et quandoque fit, ut redeat dens unus, aut duo post casum urriusque in locis suis, et retentur sicut narrauimus, et remaneant: et non facit illud nisi artifex, prudens, et expertus.	 And sometimes it happens that a tooth returns to its place after the loss of one or two in their respective locations, and remains as we have said; this is not done except by an artist, wise, and experienced.
Et quandoque aptatur aliquod ex ossibus uaccinis: et fit ex eo sicut forma dentis, et ponitur in loco, ex quo munitur dens et stringitur, sicut diximus: et remanet, et seruitur cum eo tempore longo.	 And sometimes a piece is prepared from the bones of a calf; and it is made into the shape of a tooth, and placed in the position where it is protected and bound, as we have said; and it remains, and serves for a long time.
¶ De incisione ligamenti quod accidit sub lingua, et prohibet loquelam.	 Chapter on the incision of the ligament that occurs under the tongue, and prevents speech.
Caput XXXIIII.	 Chapter XXXIV.
Quandoque ligamentum hoc quod accidit sub lingua, est aut naturale, cum quo nascitur homo, aut accidentale, a uulnere quod iam consolidatum est.	 Sometimes this ligament that occurs under the tongue is natural, with which man is born, or accidental, from a wound that has already healed.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi in capite eius in sinu tuo, et eleua linguam eius: deinde incide illud ligamentum neruosum per latitudinem, donec soluatur lingua a retentione sua.	 The operation in it is to open the mouth of the sick person at the head of his neck in your bosom, and lift out his tongue; then cut that nerve-ligament across its width until the tongue is released from its constraint.
Quod si in eo fuerit quiddam duriciei et nodationis, et fuerit illud ex consolidatione uulneris: tunc proiice in illud uncinum, et finde illud per latitudinem, donec incidas ligamentum, et soluatur nodatio.	 If there is something hard and knotty, and it is from the consolidation of a wound; then throw a hook into it and pierce it across its width until you cut the ligament, and the knot is released.
Et caue, ne sit fissura in profundo carnis, et incidas arteriam illic, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 And be careful that there is no tear in deep flesh, and do not cut an artery there, and let blood flow out.
Deinde colluatur in uestigio incisionis cum aqua rosata, aut cum aceto, aut aqua frigida.	 Then it is cleaned in the trace of the incision with rose water, or vinegar, or cold water.
Deinde pone sub lingua licinium ex lino, quod teneat infirmus in omni nocte: ut non consolidetur secundo.	 Then place a cloth made from flax under the tongue that the sick person holds all night; so that it does not consolidate again.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc pone super locum zegi tritum.	 If however there occurs a bleeding, then place upon the place zagi crushed.
Si uero uincit te sanguis, tunc cauteriza locum cum cauterio lentiginoso, quod conuenit ad illud: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 If it is cut (by a knife), then cauterize the place with a lentiginous cautery that suits the wound; afterwards take care of it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
¶ De extractione Ranulae quae fit sub lingua.	 Chapter on the extraction of the Ranula that happens under the tongue.
Caput XXXV.	 Chapter XXXV. (Chapter 35)
Quandoque accidit sub lingua apostema quod assimilatur Ranae paruae, prohibens linguam ab operatione sua naturali: et fortasse magnificatur adeo, donec implet os.	 Sometimes there occurs under the tongue an aposteme resembling a small Ranula which hinders the natural movement of the tongue and perhaps becomes swollen to the point of filling the bone.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi coram sole: et considera apostema.	 And the operation on this is that you open the sick person's mouth facing the sun; and examine the aposteme.
Si ergo uides ipsum fusci coloris, aut nigri, durum, cui non inuenit infirmus sensum: tunc non tangas ipsum, quoniam est cancer.	 If you see it of a dark or black colour, hard and insensitive to the touch; then do not touch it, as it is cancer.
Et si est decliue ad albedinem, in quo est humiditas, tunc proiice in ipsum uncinum, et incide ipsum cum spatumili subtili, et libera ipsum ab omni parte.	 And if it is sloping towards whiteness, where there is moisture; then plunge a hook into it and cut it with a thin spatula, and release it from all sides.
Quod si uincit te sanguis in hora tuae operationis, tunc pone super ipsum zegi tritum, donec abscindatur sanguis: deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec extrahas ipsum cum complemento eius.	 If it bleeds during your operation, then place upon it crushed zagi until the bleeding stops; afterwards return to your operation until you extract it with its contents.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto et sale: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	 Then wash it with vinegar and salt; afterwards take care of it with the rest of the treatment that suits the wound until it heals.
¶ De curatione apostematis duarum Amigdalarum.	 Chapter on the treatment of two Aphthae (aphtha is an ancient term for a canker sore).
Caput XXXVI.	 Chapter XXXVI. (Chapter 36)
Quandoque accidunt inter guttur godad, id est, glandulae, quae similantur algodad, quae accidunt deforis: et nominantur duae Amigdalae: quas quando curas cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non sanantur, tunc considera.	 Sometimes there appear in the throat nodes which resemble glands that appear externally and are called two Aphthae; when you treat them with what I have said above and they do not heal, then examine them.
Si ergo est apostema durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro.	 If it is a hard aposteme of dark colour, with little sensation; then do not touch it with iron.
Et si est rubei coloris, et radix eius est grossa: tunc non tangas ipsum etiam cum ferro, timens fluxum sanguinis, imo dimitte ipsum, donec maturetur.	 If it is red in color and the root is thick: then do not touch it even with iron, fearing bleeding, rather leave it alone until it matures.
Et tunc aut perforabis ipsum: aut rumpetur per se.	 Then either you will pierce it yourself or it will burst by itself.
Et si est albi coloris, rotundum, et est radix eius subtilis: tunc oportet ipsum incidi.	 If it is white in color and round and the root is subtle: then it must be cut.
Et operatio in ipso est, ut consideres ante operationem suam, si quieuit apostema eius calidum quiete completum, aut imminuitur quadam diminutione: tunc ergo fac sedere infirmum coram sole, et caput eius sit in sinu tuo: et aperi os eius, et accipiat seruiens inter manus suas, et premat linguam eius inferius cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	 And the operation on it is that you consider before its operation whether its aposteme is quiet and warmly completed, or if it decreases in some way: then therefore make the sick person sit facing the sun, and his head should be in your lap; and open his mouth, and let a servant hold him by hand, and press his tongue downwards with an instrument, whose form this is.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere, quod sit subtile sicut cultellus.	 Let it be made from silver or brass, which is as subtle as a scalpel.
Cum ergo premis cum eo linguam, et ostenditur tibi apostema, et cadit super ipsum uisus tuus: tunc accipe uncinum, et fige ipsum in amigdalam, et extrahe eam ad exteriora quantum potes, praeter quod trahas cum ea aliquid ex tunicis.	 When therefore you press his tongue with it and the aposteme is shown to you and falls upon him: then take a hook, and fix it in a pea-sized lump, and extract it as far as possible, apart from pulling something out of the tunics along with it.
Deinde incide eam cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma quae sequitur.	 Then cut it with an instrument, whose form is as follows:
Assimilatur forficibus: uerumtamen extremitates eius sint curuatae, ita quod orificium cuiusque earum est in directo alterius acute: unde cura ut sit ex ferro indo, aut alfuled imbibitum.	 It resembles forceps; however its extremities should be rounded, so that the opening of each of them is directly opposite another's point: therefore it should be made of steel or alum treated with oil.
Si autem non est praesens hoc instrumentum, tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili, cuius haec est forma.	 If this tool is not available, then cut it with a spatula, whose form is as follows:
Sit acutum a parte una, non acutum a parte altera.	 One part should be sharp, not the other.
Et postquam incidis amigdalam unam, incide alteram secundum hanc eandem speciem incisionis.	 And after you have cut one pea-sized lump, cut another according to this same cutting pattern.
Deinde post incisionem gargarizet infirmus cum aqua frigida, aut cum aceto et aqua.	 Then the sick person should rinse his throat with cold water or vinegar and water.
Si autem accidat ei fluxus sanguinis, gargarizet cum aqua in qua bulliti sunt cortices granatorum: aut folia myrti, et similia illis ex stipticis, donec abscindatur fluxus sanguinis: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 If bleeding occurs, let him gargle with water in which the bark of pomegranates has been boiled; or with myrtle leaves and similar ones from other plants, until the bleeding stops; then take care of him until he is healed.
Et quandoque nascuntur in gutture apostemata alia, praeter amigdalas duas.	 And sometimes boils appear in the throat besides the two tonsils.
Incide ergo ea secundum quod dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum aequaliter.	 Cut them equally according to what I said in the incision of the two tonsils.
Et ego quidem iam medicatus fui mulierem ex apostemate, quod natum erat inter guttur eius, quod trahebat ad fuscedinem, pauci sensus, quod iam fere clauserat guttur: et mulier respirabat a meatu stricto, et iam prohibuerat ei comestionem, et potum aquae: et iam peruenerat ad mortem, si remansisset uno die, aut duobus diebus.	 I myself have already cured a woman from a boil that had been born in her throat, which was dragging toward swelling, few senses, which almost closed her throat; and the woman was breathing through a narrow opening, and she had already prohibited food for herself, and water; and by then, if it had remained for one or two days, death would have occurred.
Et apostema tantum ascenderat, quod emiserat duos ramos, donec exierant super duo foramina nasi.	 The boil had risen only so much that it had released two branches until they came out through the two nasal openings.
Properaui ergo festinanter, et fixi in unum eorum uncinum.	 I rushed quickly and fixed one of its hooks.
Deinde traxi ipsum, et tracta ex eo est portio magna.	 Then I pulled it, and a large piece was drawn out from it.
Deinde abscidi eam, ubi comprehendi ex foramine nasi.	 Then I cut it off where it could be taken from the nasal opening.
Deinde feci illud ei quod processit ex foramine nasi altero.	 Then I did what came out from the other nasal opening.
Deinde aperui os eius, et pressi linguam eius: et postea fixi uncinum in ipsum apostema: deinde abscidi ex eo partem eius, et non cucurrit ex eo nisi sanguis paucus: absolutum est ergo guttur mulieris, et incepit statim bibere aquam, deinde accepit ex cibo.	 Then I opened his mouth and pressed his tongue; then I fixed a hook in the boil; then I cut off a piece of it, and nothing but a little blood came out from it; so the woman's throat was healed, and she immediately began to drink water, and then she started eating.
Non ergo cessaui incidere ex illo apostemate multotiens tempore longo: et apostema succedebat loco eius quod incidebam, donec prolongatum est nimis et cum ea illud.	 Therefore, I did not stop cutting from that boil for a long time; and the boil succeeded in place of what I was cutting, until it became too prolonged and with that [something else].
Ingeniaui ergo, et cauterizaui apostema inter guttur.	 So, I made an incision, and burned the boil in the throat.
Stetit ergo ab additione: deinde ambulaui a parte, et non sciui quid fecit Deus cum ea post me.	 Therefore it stood after addition: then I walked on the side, and I did not know what God had done with it after me.
¶ De incisione apostematis uuulae.	 On the Incision of an Apostemat in the Uvula.
Caput XXXVII.	 Chapter XXXVII.
Quando descendit catarrus ad uuulam, et apostematur, et est long: tunc ipsa nominatur perpendicularis: et si est in inferiori parte grossa, rotunda, tunc ipsa nominatur uua.	 When a catarrh descends to the uvula, and is excised when it is long, then it is named perpendicular; and if it is thick and round in the lower part, then it is called a nodule.
Quando curatur cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: et uides quod apostema calidum quieuit ab ea, et est subtilis: tunc oportet ut incidas eam.	 When it is cured along with what has been said in the division, and cure does not help; and you see that the apostemat is warm and has subsided from there, and is soft; then one should incise it.
Et quae ex ea est aggregata rotunda, et non est ei longitudo, et est sanguinea, aut fusci coloris, aut nigri, et non est ei sensus: tunc oportet ut deuites incisionem eius.	 And what has been gathered round from it, and is not long, and is bloody or of a dark or black color, and has no sensation; then one should cut an incision into it.
In ea enim est timor super infirmum.	 For in it there is fear for the weak.
Oportet ergo quando uides eam secundum modum quem dixi ex albedine, et longitudine sua, ut facias sedere infirmum coram sole: et premas linguam eius cum instrumento, cuius praecessit narratio: deinde fige uncinum in uuam, et trahe eam inferius: et incide eam cum uno duorum instrumentorum quae dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum.	 Therefore when you see it according to the way I have said in its whiteness and length, you should make the weak sit before the sun; and press his tongue with the instrument whose description has been given earlier; then insert a hook into the uvula, and pull it downwards; and incise it with one of the two instruments that were mentioned in the incision of the two amygdalae.
Et oportet ut non incidas ex ea, nisi illud quod additur super naturalem terminum sine additione.	 And one should not incise from it unless what is added exceeds the natural limit without addition.
Nam si tu incidis ex ea plus, laedes uocem et sermonem.	 For if you incise more than this, you will damage the voice and speech.
Deinde post incisionem utere eo quod narrauimus in incisione duarum amigdalarum: et cura eam, donec sanetur.	 Then after the incision use what has been said regarding the incision of the two amygdalae; and care for it until it is healed.
Si autem terretur infirmus ab incisione: tunc oportet ut utaris ingenio in cauterizatione eius absque timore et pauore.	 If, however, the weak is afraid of the incision; then one should use art in its cauterization without fear or dread.
Et modus cauterii in ea non est, nisi cum aqua acuta: et est, ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	 The method of cauterization in that case is not except with sharp water: and it is, that you place the head of the sick person in your armpit.
Deinde preme linguam eius cum instrumento quod diximus.	 Then press his tongue with the instrument mentioned before.
Deinde accipe ex aqua quam dixi tibi in capitulo cauterizandi, et confice cum ea calcem non extinctam, et pone eam non spissam, neque subtilem, et imple ex ea concauitatem huius instrumenti, cuius haec est forma.	 Then take water as I said in the chapter on cauterization and make a non-extinguished mortar with it, and do not fill it thick or too thin, and fill the depression of this instrument with it, which has this form:
Sit extremitati eius in qua ponitur medicina concauitas, sicut concauitas cochlearis radii.	 Let the end of the instrument where the medicine is placed be concave like a conch shell's radius.
Et pone instrumentum cum medicina super uuulam ipsam: et infirmus sit iacens super latus suum, ut currat saliua ex ore eius ex intrinseca medicina, ut non descendat ex ea ad guttur ipsius aliquid, et laedat ipsum.	 Place the instrument with the medicine on the wound itself: and let the sick person lie on his side so that the saliva from his mouth runs out through the intrinsic medicine, so that nothing from it falls into his throat and harms him.
Deinde tene manum tuam cum medicina.	 Then hold your hand with the medicine.
Et tu ex primas eam super uuulam quantitate medietatis horae, donec uideas eam iam denigratam, et sedatam mordicationem medicinae.	 And you apply it on the wound by handfuls for half an hour until you see it darkened and the biting of the medicine ceased.
Et si uis ut accipias cotum, et inuoluas ipsum super extremitatem radii, et infundas cotum cum medicina, et intromittas radium cum coto in cannulam desuper, donec adhaereat cotum super uuulam.	 And if you want to take a cataplasm, and wrap it around the end of the radius, and pour the cataplasm with medicine over it, and insert the radius with the cataplasm into the tube above until the cataplasm adheres to the wound.
Fac illud multotiens, donec consequaris quod uis de cauterizatione uuae.	 Do that repeatedly until you achieve what you want from the cauterization of the vein.
Deinde dimitte eam: ipsa namque arescit et cadit post tres dies, aut quatuor.	 Then release it: for indeed it will char and fall off after three or four days.
Quod si indiges ut iteres medicinam, itera ipsam: et post cauterizationem absterge in circumitu uuae cum coto imbibito in butyro, et mundifica cum eo quod est in circumitu eius ex medicina: et colluatur cum aqua frigida.	 If you need to repeat the medicine, do so: and after cauterization clean it around the vein with cataplasm soaked in butter, and clean it with that which is in the vicinity of it from the medicine: and rinse it with cold water.
Et curetur extrinsecus cum embrocis, et deintus cum gargarismis, donec sanetur.	 Externally it will be treated with ointments, and internally with emetics, until it is healed.
Haec ergo species curationis est salubrior incisione et longinquior a timore.	 This therefore is a more beneficial treatment by incising (cutting) and at a greater distance from fear.
Et quandoque curatur uuula etiam cum eo quod est subtilius quam cauterium et incisio: curatur enim cum suffumigatione, secundum hunc modum.	 And sometimes the ulcer is also cured with a method that is more subtle than cautery and incision; it is cured by suffumigation (suffocating), according to this method.
Sume calamentum, et hyssopum, et origanum, et rutam, et sseah, et chamomillam, et abrotanum, et similia eis ex herbis: et aggrega ea omnia, aut quaedam eorum in olla, et submergantur cum aceto, et bulliant: et olla sit lutata cum luto decenter: et sit in medio ollae foramen, super quod componatur instrumentum concauum secundum hunc modum.	 Take camomile, hyssop, origanum (wild marjoram), rutum (rue), sseah (probably an error or misspelling), chamomilla (chamomile), abrotanum (meadowsweet), and similar herbs from plants; gather all of these together, or some of them in a pot, and submerge them with vinegar, and boil; let the pot be well-coated with mortar; and there should be a hole in the middle of the pot, over which an instrument is placed according to this method.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere: et intromittatur extremitas, in qua est granatum, in os infirmi, donec ascendat uapor ad uuulam super cannulam, donec obscuretur uuula multum.	 Make it from silver or brass; insert the end, where the grain is, into the sick man's mouth, until the vapor reaches the ulcer through the cannula (a thin tube), until the ulcer is covered a great deal.
Deinde itera super ipsam multotiens, donec arescat.	 Then repeat this many times, until it burns (or heals).
Et caue, ne facias hanc curationem in principio aduentus apostematis.	 And be careful not to perform this treatment at the beginning of the appearance of an abscess.
Plaerumque enim addit in apostemate: et non oportet ut facias illud nisi apud declinationem apostematis eius calidi.	 Usually, however, you should add (something) in an abscess; and it is not appropriate to do this unless near the opening of the abscess at its warm point.
Si autem non est praesens tibi hoc instrumentum, tunc accipe cannam, et compone in extremitate eius corticem oui: ut non comburatur os infirmi: quoniam cortex oui prohibet uaporem comburere os: et haec est ex bona curatione cum salute.	 If this instrument is not present with you, then take a cannula and prepare its end with the rind of an ox's horn; so that the bone of the sick man is not burned; because the ox's horn rind prevents the vapor from burning the bone; and this is part of good treatment with benefit.
¶ De extractione spinarum, et ossium de gula.	 § On the extraction of thorns and bones from the throat.
Caput XXXVIII.	 Chapter XXXVIII.
Multotiens adhaeret in gutture os, aut spina piscis, aut aliud.	 Multitiimes an bone adheres to the throat, or a fish spine, or something else.
Oportet ergo ut extrahas quod ex eis est apparens super quod cadit uisus, postquam premis linguam cum instrumento apud solem, et declaratur tibi quod est in gutture.	 Therefore, it should be extracted whatever appears visible over which the sight falls after pressing the tongue with the instrument in the sun, and it becomes clear to you that it is in the throat.
Et quod non apparet tibi et occultatur in gutture, oportet ut facias uomere infirmum antequam digeratur cibus in stomacho.	 And what is not apparent to you and hidden in the throat, it should be done with a purgative before the food is digested in the stomach.
Fortasse enim egredietur res annexa per uomitum.	 Perhaps the thing attached will come out through vomiting.
Aut deglutiat infirmus frustum napi, aut radicem lactucae, aut deglutiat buccellam panis sicci: aut accipiat frustum spongiae marinae siccae lenis: et liga ipsum in filo, deinde deglutiat ipsum.	 Or the sick person may swallow a piece of ginger, or the root of lettuce, or a mouthful of dry bread; or he may take a piece of soft dried sea sponge; and tie it up in thread, then swallow it.
Cum ergo peruenit ad locum ubi sunt spinae, aut os, et extrahitur, tunc egreditur.	 When it reaches the place where the spine or bone is located, and it is extracted, then it comes out.
Si ergo non egreditur cum eo quod diximus: tunc utere instrumento ex plumbo secundum hanc formam.	 If it does not come out as we said; then use an instrument made of lead in this shape.
Sit grossius quam Radius parumper, et in extremitate eius sit curuitas, quam intromittat in guttur suum cum facilitate: et ipse habeat caput suum eleuatum sursum.	 Make it thicker than the radius a little, and at its end have a bend so that it may be introduced into the throat with ease; and let it have its head raised upward.
Et caueat a tactu suae epiglotis, ut non accidat ei tussis, et impellat cum eo os, aut spinam, aut intromittat ipsum medicus manu sua.	 And let him beware of touching his epiglottis, lest he coughs, and pushes with it the bone or spine, or the doctor may insert it by hand.
Verum quod infirmus intromittat, hoc est melius: propter scientiam suam de loco rei annexae: et impellat inferius, aut trahat manum suam cum instrumento sursum, totum illud secundum quantitatem quae praeparatur ei, donec egrediatur.	 Indeed, what the sick person introduces is better; because of his knowledge of the place of the attached thing; and he pushes downward or draws his hand with the instrument upward, all that according to its quantity which is prepared for him until it comes out.
¶ De extractione Sanguisugae.	 Chapter on the Extraction of Leeches.
Caput XXXIX.	 Chapter XXXIX.
Quando medicatur sanguisuga cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex curatione cum medicinis, et non confert, tunc considera in gutture infirmi coram sole, siue apud solem postquam premis linguam eius cum instrumento quod narraui tibi.	 When the leech is treated with what I said in the division of cure with medicines, and it does not work; then consider in the throat of the sick person in the sun or after pressing his tongue with the instrument that I told you, whether anything appears visible over which the sight falls.
Si ergo cadit uisus tuus super sanguisugam, extrahe eam cum uncino paruo, aut cum gesti subtilibus decenter.	 If therefore your sight falls upon a leech, remove it with a small hook or with finely pointed tweezers.
Quod si non est possibile cum eis: tunc accipe cannulam concauam, et intromitte eam in guttur infirmi usque prope guttur: deinde intromitte in concauitatem cannulae ferrum ignitum cum igne.	 If it is not possible with them (the hook or tweezers): then take a concave tube and insert it into the throat of the patient as far as the throat; then insert into the hollow of the tube hot iron with fire.
Fac illud multotiens: et abstineat infirmus ab aqua tota die.	 Do this frequently: and let the patient abstain from water for the whole day.
Deinde accipiat uitreatam plenam aqua frigida, et aperiat os eius in ea: et colluat os suum cum ea, et non deglutiat ex ea aliquid: et moueat aquam una hora post aliam cum manu sua.	 Then let him take a mouthwash full of cold water, and open his mouth in it; and rinse his mouth with it, and do not swallow anything from it; and move the water one hour after another with his hand.
Sanguisuga enim ilico cum sentit aquam cadit.	 For the leech immediately drops (falls out) when it feels water.
Si autem non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc suffumiga infirmum cum cimicibus, aut cum asa cum instrumento quod narraui in suffumigatione uuulae.	 If it does not come out with what we have said, then fumigate the patient with bedbugs or with an asa (fumigantium instrument) that I mentioned for fumigating the ear.
Fac illud multotiens, quoniam ipsa cadet.	 Do this frequently, because it will drop (fall out) by itself.
Et modus operationis in suffumigatione est, ut accipias ollam, in qua sint prunae uiuae cum igne: et olla sit cooperta cum coopertorio, in cuius medio sit foramen: et componatur in illo foramine extremitas instrumenti.	 And the method of operation in fumigating is that you take a pot with live prunes and fire; and let the pot be covered with a cover, in the middle of which there should be a hole; and place the end of the instrument in this hole.
Deinde proiice suffumigationem, et ponat infirmus os suum in extremitate cannulae, et claudat os suum, ut non egrediatur suffumigatio, donec scias quod suffumigatio iam peruenit ad sanguisugam.	 Then throw the fumigation, and let the patient place his mouth at the end of the tube, and close his mouth, so that the fumigation does not escape, until you know that the fumigation has reached the leech.
Nam sanguisuga statim cadet.	 For the leech will immediately fall out.
Quod si non cadit, tunc itera suffumigationem multotiens.	 If it does not fall out, then repeat the fumigation frequently.
Et toleret infirmus sitim, et comedat salsa, et allia, et non bibat aquam.	 Let the patient endure thirst, and eat salt and other things, but do not let him drink water.
Necesse est ergo ut egrediatur cum hoc regimine.	 Therefore it is necessary for it to come out with this regimen (treatment).
Et haec est forma instrumenti cum quo extrahitur sanguisuga ex gutture, quando cadit super ipsam uisus.	 And this is the form of the instrument with which a leech is drawn from the throat, when it falls upon it.
Est simile forcipibus, sicut uides: nisi quia est ei haee curuitas quae intromittitur ad guttur.	 It resembles forceps as you see, except that it has a curve which is introduced into the throat.
Et extremitas eius similis ori auis quae nominatur ciconia, in quo est asperitas limae: quando comprehendit aliquid, non dimittit ipsum omnino.	 And its tip resembles the beak of a bird called ciconia (cormorant), which has the roughness of a file; when it captures something, it does not release it completely.
¶ De apertione Apostematum, et eorum sectione, et cura in genere.	 Chapter on the opening of abscesses, and their cutting and treatment in general.
Caput XL.	 Chapter 40.
Apostematum species sunt multae, multorum modorum, secundum quod uenit rememoratio eorum, scilicet unius, et unius in hoc libro: et sunt diuersae in perforatione eorum, et sectione ipsorum ex duobus modis.	 The species of abscesses are numerous, various according to their remembrance, that is, one and one in this book; and they are different in perforating them, and cutting them from two ways.
Quorum unus est ex specie apostematis in seipso, et eo quod comprehendit ex humiditatibus.	 One of them is the species of abscess within itself, and that which it encloses due to moistures.
Et modus secundus est propter loca, in quibus accidit ex corpore.	 And the second mode is because of places where it happens from the body.
Quoniam apostema accidens in capite, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in ano: et apostema accidens in loco carnoso, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in iuncturis: et unicuique eorum est iudicium suum ex operatione.	 Since an abscess happening on the head is different from an abscess happening in the anus; and an abscess happening in a fleshy place is different from an abscess happening in joints: and each of them has its own judgment according to the operation.
Et ex apostematibus sunt quae non oportet ut perforentur, nisi post maturationem saniei in eis, et complementum eius: et ex eis sunt, quae oportet ut perforentur, dum sunt cruda, et non maturantur secundum complementum.	 And from abscesses there are some that should not be perforated unless the pus in them has matured and completed; and from these there are some that should be perforated while they are raw, and do not mature according to completion.
Sicut apostemata quae sunt propinqua iuncturis.	 As abscesses which are near joints.
Quoniam apostema quando accidit prope iuncturam, et prolongatur esse eius, donec putrefit quod est in circumitu eius fortasse corrumpuntur ligamenta, aut nerui illius iuncturae: quare est caussa propior contractionis illius membri.	 Since when an abscess happens near a joint and prolongs to be there until it putrefies what is around it perhaps the ligaments or nerves of that joint are corrupted, therefore it is the cause of the closer contraction of that member.
Aut est apostema apud membrum principale: quoniam si tu tardas perforationem eius, donec maturetur, nocebit uel illi, uel per illud membro principali.	 The boil is an aposteme in the main member: because if you delay its opening until it matures, it will harm either him or the principal member.
Aut est prope anum, perfora ergo ipsum immaturum: et non oportet, ut perfores, apostema crudum, non completae digestionis, nisi quod est prope anum, ut non putrefiat profundum, et longetur ad interiora ani, et fiat fistula, aut fiat in termino eius quod non sanatur.	 It is near the anus; therefore perforate it while still immature: it is not necessary to perforate a raw aposteme before complete digestion, unless it is near the anus, so that it does not rot deeply and extend towards the interior of the anus, becoming a fistula or one that will not heal at its end.
Oportet ut scias horam perforationis apostematis, quod maturatum est secundum complementum: et est apud sedationem doloris, recessionem febris, et diminutionem rubedinis, et pulsationis, et acuitatem capitis apostematis: et reliqua signa.	 You must know the hour of perforating the boil, when it is mature according to its completion; and this is in sedation of pain, withdrawal of fever, decrease of redness, and pulsations, and acuteness of the head of the boil; and the rest of the signs.
Et oportet, ut facias eandem perforationem in inferiori loco apostematis, et uehementioris eminentiae: et sit perforatio uadens in longitudine corporis, si apostemata sunt in partibus manuum et pedum, et locis lacertorum, et chordarum, et neruorum, et arteriarum, et ad ultimum in omnibus locis aequalibus, quibus non est reflexio.	 And it is necessary that you make the same opening in a lower place of the boil and of greater protrusion: and the perforation should run along the length of the body, if the boils are in parts of the hands and feet, and places of shoulders, and necks, and tendons, and nerves, and finally in all places where there is no reflection.
In illis autem quae reflectuntur, uade cum perforatione secundum illud membrum.	 In those which are reflected, go with the perforation according to that member.
Quando uero apostema est in locis carnosis: tunc melius est ut dimittas perforationem eius, donec confirmetur eius digestio, sicut diximus secundum complementum.	 When the boil is in fleshy places: then it is better to delay the opening of it until its digestion has consolidated, as we have said according to its completion.
Quoniam si tu perforas ipsum ante illud, prolongatur cursus uirus ex eo, et est multae sordis et sordiciei, et fortasse indurantur labia eius, et profunditas eius.	 Because if you perforate it before that, the course of the virus from it is prolonged and there are many dirt and dirty places, and perhaps its lips harden and its depth.
Et quaedam apostemata perforantur secundum latitudinem corporis apud necessitatem: aut secundum illud quo indiget membrum.	 And some boils are opened according to the length of the body for necessity, or according to that which the member needs.
Et oportet, ut administres in apostematibus paruis perforationem paruam, et in apostematibus magnis perforationem amplam: aut sectiones multas per similitudinem magnitudinis apostematis.	 And it is necessary to administer a small opening for small boils and a large opening for large boils; or many sections according to the similarity of the size of the boils.
Et sunt ex apostematibus, in quibus oportet ut concauetur cutis: et incidatur quando iam facta est sicut pannus, et facta est in termino, quod iam mortua est: sicut illud quod accidit in multis, ut dubelet, et bubonibus.	And there are among the tumors, where the skin should be concave: and it is to be cut when already made like a cloth, and it has become at its end, what is already dead: as that which happens frequently with many, to shrink, and with buboes.
Et ex eis sunt quae secantur sectione habente tres angulos.	 And there are those which are to be cut by a section having three angles.
Et ex eis est, ex quo inciditur sicut figura folii myrti.	 And there is one of them, where it is to be cut like the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Sicut apostema inguinum.	 As an inguinal tumor.
Et ex eis sunt in quibus administratur sectio rotunda, et sectio lunaris: et similes eis ex sectionibus.	 And there are those in which a circular section and crescent-shaped section is administered, and similar ones from sections.
Illud uero cui non est caput, sicut sunt apostemata lenia superficialia, oportet ut perfores ipsum perforatione superficiali, uel plana tantum.	 What is without a head, such as superficial tumors, it is necessary to pierce through it with a surface perforation, or only flat one.
Et oportet, quando apostema est grossum, et iam collegit saniem multam, et perforas ipsum, ut non properes et extrahas pus totum in illa hora: imo extrahe ex ipso partem eius.	 And it is necessary, when the tumor is large and has collected much pus, and you pierce it, so that it does not burst out and extract all the pus in that hour: instead, extract a part of it from it.
Deinde opila apostema usque ad diem alium.	 Then, open the tumor until another day (for further treatment).
Deinde extrahe quiddam ex pus iterum.	 Then, extract something again from the pus.
Fac illud multotiens secundum gradationem, donec egrediatur: praecipue si infirmus est debilis uirtutis, aut mulier praegnans, aut puer paruus, aur senex decrepitus: spiritus enim animalis ab animali multotiens resoluitur cum egressione saniei: et fortasse moritur infirmus, et tu non percipis.	 Do this many times according to the degree, until it comes out: especially if he is weak in strength, or a woman pregnant, or a small child, or an old man worn out: for the animal spirit is often resolved with the discharge of pus; and perhaps the sick one dies, and you do not perceive.
Caue ergo hoc capitulum cautela magna.	 Be careful of this chapter, with great caution.
Et post perforationem tuam, qua ista perforas apostemata, oportet ut abstergas uulnus: et considera.	 And after your perforation, where you pierce the tumors, it is necessary to clean the wound: and examine.
Si ergo est uulnus apostematis paruum, aut est sectio plana, tunc administra licinia ex lino, aut coto antiquo.	 If therefore the wound of the tumor is small, or the section is flat, then administer a linen cloth, or an old copper sheet.
Et si est apostema magnum, et fissurae perforationis multae sunt, oportet tunc ut intromittas in omnem fissuram licinium, donec perueniant adinuicem.	 If there is a large abscess and many openings of the perforation, then it is necessary to insert linen into every opening until they meet each other.
Et si in apostemate abscidisti partem cutis, aut in circumitu concauasti eam: tunc oportet ut impleas eam coto ueteri, aut sicut quando texitur pannus, aut raditur lanugine lini absque humiditate: et stringe ipsum usque ad tertium diem.	 If you have removed a part of the skin from an abscess or if you have hollowed it out around it, then it is necessary to fill it with old cloth, or as when a fabric is sewn, or shorn with linen wool without wetness; and tighten it for three days.
Deinde proiice ipsum, et cura illud cum eo quod oportet ex unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then remove it (the cloth or dressing), and care for that place with whatever is necessary from an ointment until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis in hora tuae operationis, tunc administra aquam frigidam, et acetum, postquam imbibitur in eis pannus: et ponis ipsum super locum fluxus sanguinis multotiens.	 If there is bleeding during your operation hour, then administer cold water and vinegar; after it has been soaked in them, place a cloth on the site of bleeding multiple times.
Si autem perseuerat fluxus sanguinis, tunc oportet ut administres regimen, et curationem, et pulueres, quae narraui in locis multis huius nostri libri, et ex diuisione.	 If the bleeding persists, then it is necessary to administer a treatment and cure, and powders which I have mentioned in many places of this our book and from division (of the body).
Si autem est in tempore hyemis, et locus apostematis est multorum neruorum: tunc oportet ut infundas puluillos cum uino, et oleo calidis: et ponas eos super loca.	 If it is winter time and the abscess site involves many nerves, then it is necessary to pour powders with warm wine and oil on them; and place them on the locations.
Et si fuerit in aestate, et loca sunt carnosa: tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos imbibitos in aqua, et oleo, aut eum uino et oleo, et totum illud frigidum.	 And if it is summer and the sites are fleshy, then it is necessary to place powders soaked in water, oil, or with wine and oil, and make everything cold.
Donec quando erit dies tertius, sicut diximus, tunc oportet ut soluas apostema, et abstergas ipsum, et administres in curatione eius quod ei conuenit, donec sanetur.	 Until the third day, as we have said, it is necessary to solve the abscess, remove it, and administer whatever is appropriate for its cure until it heals.
Hoc est ergo quod necessarium est ex cognitione curationis apostematum uniuersaliter.	 This is therefore what is generally necessary for the knowledge of treating abscesses universally.
Secundum semitam uero distinctionis, iam dixi de omni apostemate, qualiter est uia ad curationem eius capitulatim singulariter.	 According to the method of division (of the body), I have already said about every abscess, how is the way to treat it individually and chapter by chapter.
¶ De sectione apostematum quae accidunt in cute capitis.	 On the sectioning of skin tumors that occur on the head.
Caput XLI.	 Cirurgia de baculo manibus et pedibus
Accidunt in cute capitis apostemata parua, et sunt ex speciebus Nodorum, quos continent tunicae, quae sunt eis sacci: quasi ipsa sint hausolati gallinae.	 In the head small tumors called nodules occur, which are contained by sacs of the skin that resemble pouches of a hen's egg.
Et ipsorum species sunt multae.	 And their types are many.
Ex eis sunt pingues: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditatem similem limo: et ex eis quae continent humiditatem similem frisatis et pultibus: et eis similibus, et ex eis sunt, quae sunt lapidea dura.	 Among them are the fat ones; among them are those that contain moisture like mud; among them are those that contain moisture like ointments and powders; and similar to these, and among them are hard stone-like ones.
Et in sectione omnium, et ipsorum extractione non est timor, dum apud ipsorum sectionem non facit contrarietatem arteria.	 And in the section of all, and in their extraction there is no fear, as long as their section does not oppose an artery.
Et operatio in sectione eorum est, ut experiaris ea cum instrumento, cuius forma uenit post haec, quod nominatur Intromissum, donec scias quid contineat.	 The operation in their section is to test it with the instrument, whose form comes after these, which is called Intromissum, until you know what it contains.
Nam si est illud quod continet humiditas, tunc seca ipsum sectione secundum longitudinem sectione superficiali: secundum hanc formam.	 For if that which it contains is wetness, then cut it with a section according to its length with a surface section: according to this shape.
Et incipe cum sectione ex linea b. ad lineam, g. Cum ergo euacuatur humiditas, tunc excoria kistin quae continet illam humiditatem, et non dimittas ex ea aliquid penitus.	 And begin with a section from line b to line g. For when the wetness escapes, then scrape off the bladder which contains that wetness, and do not leave anything inside of it.
Multotiens enim redit, si remanet ex ea aliquid.	 For many times it returns if something remains from it.
Deinde submerge cotum in unguento aegyptio, si est praesens: et si non, in aqua et sale: et imple cum eo uulnus, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	 Then immerse the wound in Egyptian ointment if it is present; and if not, in water and salt; fill the wound with it, and leave it until another day.
Ipsum enim corrodet quod remansit ex kisti.	 For it corrodes what remains from the bladder.
Deinde itera super ipsum cotum cum aegyptio secundo, et tertio, et si indiges illo, donec confidas quia non remanserit ex kisti aliquid, tunc enim cura uulnus cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then repeat over the wound with second Egyptian ointment, and third, and if necessary, until you are confident that nothing remains from the bladder, then treat the wound with ointment until it heals.
Quod si apostema continet nodum pinguem: tunc seca ipsum secundum hanc formam, sectione habente formam crucis: et proiice uncinos inter duolabia sectionis, et excoria ipsum ab omni parte: et conare uirtutem tuam in extractione tunicae quae continet ipsum.	 If an abscess contains a thick knot: then cut it according to this shape, with a section having the shape of a cross; and throw the hooks between the two parts of the section, and scrape off the entire thing from every part; and try your strength in the extraction of the covering that contains it.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi arteria, tunc fac illud quod narrabo tibi post.	 If, however, it opposes an artery for you, then do what I will tell you afterwards.
Et similiter fac in apostemate, si est lapideum, ex sectione, et curatione eadem, secundum quod diximus.	 And the same applies to an abscess if it is stone-like, by section and the same treatment, as we have said.
Et sectio super apostema lapideum est facilior: quoniam est pauci sanguinis et humiditatis.	 The section on a stone-like abscess is easier: because there is little blood and wetness.
Et quandoque sunt quaedam horum apostematum quae sunt in capite in quibusdam hominibus, cum quibus penitus non est humiditas.	And sometimes there are some of these abscesses that are in the head in certain men, in whom there is not deep moistness.
Quod est: quia ego secui super apostema in capite mulieris uetulae, et inueni apostema sicut lapis solidus et durus, asper, albus, qui non poterat frangi: et si percuteretur cum eo aliquis proiiciendo, uulnerat ipsum.	 I have cut over an abscess on an old woman's head, and I found the abscess to be as hard and solid as a stone, rough, white, which could not be broken: and if anyone struck it with something, he would wound himself.
In aliis uero apostematibus accidentibus in capite, praeter haec scilicet apostemata quae accidunt in capitibus puerorum, et apud radices aurium, sectio eorum omnium sit sectio superficialis.	 In other cases of abscesses in the head (except for these abscesses that happen on children's heads and at the roots of the ears), the cutting of all of them should be a superficial cut.
Vel pone perforationem eorum semper ab inferiori parte eorum, ut alleuietur cursus saniei ad inferiora.	 Or, make a perforation in them always from the lower part, so that the course of pus may be directed downward.
Deinde cura ea cum eo quod conuenit eis ex curatione.	 Then care for it with what is suitable to it from the cure.
¶ De sectione Strophularum in collo.	 Chapter on the incision of goiter (enlarged thyroid gland) in the neck.
Caput XLII.	 Chapter 42.
Multotiens acccidunt ista apostemata in collo, et sub assellis, et inguinibus: et quandoque accidunt in reliquo corpore.	 These abscesses often occur in the neck, and under the shoulders, and groins; and sometimes they occur elsewhere in the body.
Et super illa quae ex eis accidunt in collo, sunt unum, et multa: et generantur ab inuicem: et omnis Strophula ex eis est intra tunicam propriam ei, sicut est in nodis et apostematibus capitis, sicut narrauimus.	 And on those that occur in the neck, there is one and many; they originate from opposite sides; and every goiter arising from them is within its own layer, like a knot or abscess of the head, as we have said.
Et species harum Strophularum sunt multae.	 And the types of these goiters are many.
Et ex eis enim sunt lapideae: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates: et ex eis sunt malignae, quae non obediunt curationi.	 For they are hard (lapideae): and there are those that contain moistness: and there are evil ones, which do not obey the cure.
In illa ergo quam ex eis uides bonae dispositionis in tactu, cuius manifestum est propinquum colori cutis, et mouetur ad omnem partem, et non est annexa cum neruis colli, neque cum guidegi, neque cum arteria, neque est profunda: oportet ut seces eam sectione superficiali a superiori parte ad inferiorem partem corporis ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. et excoria eam ab omni parte: et extende duo labia cutis cum uncino, aut cum uncinis multis, si indiges illo, sicut diximus in apostematibus capitis, et extrahe eam paulatim.	 Therefore, when you see a good disposition in the touch of one of them (which is evident by its proximity to the skin color and moves in all directions and is not attached to the neck muscles, groin or artery, and is shallow): it should be cut off with a superficial incision from the top to the lower part of the body along the line, b. to the line, g. And remove the scab from all sides: and spread two layers of skin with an uncured or with many uncured, if necessary, as we have said in abscesses of the head, and slowly extract it.
Et est super cautelam, ut non incidatur uena, aut neruus.	 And it is above the cautery, that a vein or nerve should not be cut.
Et sit spatumile non acutum ualde: ut non addat tibi manum tuam cum incisione, aut inquietet infirmum, et incidas quod non est necesse.	 And the blade should not be very sharp: so that it does not injure your hand during the incision or distress the sick person, and you cut what is not necessary.
Si autem incidis uenam, aut arteriam, aut prohibet te ab operatione, tunc pone in uulnus zegi tritum, aut quosdam pulueres qui abscindunt sanguinem, et stringe uulnus, et dimitte ipsum, donec quiescat acuitas apostematis, et mollificetur uulnus: uel incipit et uult putrefieri.	 If, however, you cut a vein or artery, then stop the operation, place on the wound some crushed antimony or certain powders that dissolve blood, and tighten the wound, and leave it alone until the sharpness of the cautery subsides and the wound becomes soft: or it begins to putrefy.
Nam sanguis abscinditur tuncia Redi ergo ad operationem tuam, donec compleas.	 For blood is drained through the ligature, therefore go back to your operation when you have finished.
Deinde inquire digito tuo indice, si remansit aliquid ex Strophulis aliis paruis: ergo incide eas, et munda eas.	 Then ask your index finger if anything remains of the stylets or other small things: therefore cut them and clean them.
Quod si est in radice Strophulae uena magna: tunc oportet ut non incidas illam Strophulam ex radice sua: imo oportet ut liges eam cum filo duplato forti, et dimittas eam donec cadat per se absque nocumento.	 If there is a large vein at the root of the stylet, then it should not be cut from its root: rather, it should be tied with strong doubled thread and left to fall by itself without harm.
Deinde imple uulnus coto ueteri, quod iam submersisti in unguento aegyptio.	 Then fill the wound with a lining of old cloth that you have already soaked in Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum.	 Then care for him (the patient).
Si inciditur Strophula tota, tunc oportet ut aggreges labia duo uulneris: et suas ipsum statim, postquam uides quia prorsus non remansit superfluitas.	 If the stylet is completely cut through, then join together the lips of the wound: and suture it immediately, after you see that there remains no excess.
Si autem uides quod remansit superfluitas propter magnitudinem Strophulae, tunc oportet ut intendas ad incidendam radicem eius, et extrahendam eam: et administra suturam quam diximus.	 If, however, you see that there remains an excess due to the size of the stylet, then you should aim at cutting its root and pulling it out: and apply the suture as we have said.
Et quae ex Strophulis continet humiditates, perfora illam perforatione superficiali: ut appareat tibi locus maturitatis eius: et pone perforationem ab eo quod sequitur inferius corporis, sicut diximus.	 And what contains humidity from the stylets, pierce it through a superficial perforation: so that you can see the maturity of its place: and position the perforation below the following part of the body, as we have said.
Deinde administra post perforationem licinia cum unguento, et similia eis, ut corrodat quod remansit ex corruptione, donec quando uides uulnus iam mundatum esse: tunc cura ipsum cum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	 After perforation, administer linseed with ointment, and similar substances, to consume what remains from corruption, until you see the wound already clean: then care for it with regenerative flesh ointment, until it heals.
¶ De sectione Epiglotis ab apostemate intra guttur accidente.	 On the trachea cut due to an ulcer within the throat.
Caput XLIII.	 Chapter XLIII.
Dixerunt antiqui hanc sectionem in Epigloti, et non uidi aliquem in terra nostra, qui eam fecerit: et haec est scriptura sermonis eorum.	 The ancients said this trachea cut, and I did not see anyone in our land who has done it; and this is their writing.
In habentibus autem synanchiam, oportet ut deuitetur sectio Epiglotis: cum non fiat iuuamentum per illud: propterea, quod omnes uenae et pulmo sunt infirmi.	 In those with synangiosis (tongue-swallowing), it is necessary to avoid trachea cut; for there is no advantage in doing so because all the veins and lungs are weak.
In illis uero qui habent apostema calidum in ore, aut gutture, aut duabus amigdalis, quando non est aegritudo in cannali, oportet uti sectione Epiglotis, ad fugiendum ex perditione quae fit ex praefocatione.	 In those who have a hot ulcer in the mouth, throat, or both tonsils, when there is no sickness in the channel, it is necessary to use trachea cut to prevent death from suffocation.
Oportet ergo quando uolumus illud, ut secemus Epiglotim sub tribus circulis Epiglotis, aut quatuor, sectione parua per latitudinem, in eo quod est inter duos circulos per quantitatem, quod sit sectio in sifac, non in cartilagine: et iste quidem locus est conueniens sectioni, quoniam est priuatus carne, et uasa sanguinis ab eo sunt longinqua.	 Therefore, when we wish to cut the trachea, it should be cut under three or four circles of the trachea, with a small cut across its width, in that which is between two circles, and the cut should be in the cartilage, not in the bone: this place is suitable for cutting because it is without meat, and blood vessels are far away from it.
Quod si medicator est timidus, tunc oportet ut extendat cutem gutturis cum uncino.	 If the doctor is afraid, then it is necessary that he stretch the throat skin with a hook.
Deinde findat cutem, donec quando peruenit ad cannalem: deuitet uas sanguinis, si uidet ex eis aliquid.	 Then he should cut the skin until he reaches the channel; he should avoid blood vessels if he sees any of them.
Deinde secet sifac quod narrauimus: et significatur super sectionem cannalis ex phlegmate quod egreditur ex ea, cum eo quod disrumpitur, et abscisione uocis.	 Then he should cut the cartilage as we said; it is indicated by the phlegm that comes out from the channel when it is ruptured, and by the voice being lost.
Et dimitte uulnus apertum tempore aliquo.	 And leave the open wound for some time.
Cum ergo remouetur hora in qua timetur praefocatio, aggrega duo labia uulneris cutis, et sue ipsam solam absque cartilagine.	 When therefore the hour is removed in which perforation is feared, join together two lips of the wound's skin, and its own sole without cartilage.
Deinde administra medicinas quae faciunt nasci carnem, usquequo sanetur.	 Then administer medications that make flesh grow, until it heals.
Inquit Albucasis.	 Says Albucasis.
Summa huius sermonis quem narrauimus, expositio non est, nisi quando uident, quod aliquod horum apostematum iam opilauit guttur infirmi: et sublimatus est infirmus super mortem, et uult intersecari anhelitus eius: uadunt ad secandum Epiglotim, ut respiret infirmus super locum uulneris quadam respiratione, et saluetur a morte: et propter hoc praeceperunt dimittere uulnus apertum, donec consumatur malicia aegritudinis, et est malicia eius tribus diebus, et quasi ipsa: tunc ergo praecaeperunt suere uulnus, et curare ipsum, donec sanetur.	 The conclusion of the story we have told is as follows: Albucasis says that if any one of these abscesses has already opened the throat of a sick person, and he is raised up above death and wants to cut his breath, they go to cut the Epiglottis so that the sick person may breathe over the place of the wound with some breathing, and thus be saved from death. And for this reason they commanded to leave the wound open until the malice of the disease is consumed, and its malice lasts three days, as if it were itself. Then, therefore, they commanded to close the wound and take care of it until it heals.
Et illud quod uidi per me ipsum est, quod una ancilla accaepit cultellum, et misit cum in guttur suum, et incidit cum eo partem cannalis pulmonis.	 And that which I have seen with my own eyes is the following: a maidservant seized a knife and sent it into her own throat, and cut a piece of the windpipe of the lungs.
Et uocatus sum ad curationem eius, et inueni eam mugire, sicut est mugitus mortui.	 And I was summoned to heal her, and found her moaning, as is the moan of the dead.
Detexi ergo a uulnere, et inueni sanguinem qui egressus fuerat ex uulnere paruum.	 Therefore, I looked at the wound, and found that blood had come out from the wound, albeit in small quantity.
Confisus ergo sum, quod ipsa non absciderat uenam, neque guidegi: et uentus egrediebatur ex uulnere.	 Consequently, I was convinced that she had not severed the vein or the windpipe, and air was coming out from the wound.
Properaui ergo, et sui uulnus, et curaui ipsum, donec sanum est: et non accidit ancillae aliquid, nisi raucedo in uoce: et rediit post dies ad meliorem dispositionum suarum.	 I approached therefore, and closed the wound, and healed it until it was well; and nothing happened to the maidservant, except hoarseness of voice; and she returned after some days to a better condition.
Hinc ergo dico: quod in sectione Epiglotis non est timor.	 From this I say that there is no fear in cutting the Epiglottis.
¶ De sectione Herniae gutturis.	 On the section of hernia of the throat.
Caput XLIIII.	 Title XLIV.
Hoc Apostema nominatum Hernia gutturis, est apostema magnum, secundum colorem corporis: et est in mulieribus multum.	 This swelling named hernia of the throat is a large swelling, according to the color of the body; and it occurs much in women.
Et est secundum duos modos: aut enim est naturale: aut est accidentale.	 And it occurs in two ways: either it is natural; or it is accidental.
In naturali certe non est ingenium.	 Certainly, in the natural one, there is no birth defect.
Accidentale uero est secundum duos modos: quorum unus est similis nodis pinguibus.	 Accidental is, according to two modes: one of which is similar to fatty nodes.
Et modus alter, est similis apostemati quod fit ex nodatione arteriae.	 And the other mode, is similar to an abscess that occurs due to a knot in an artery.
Et in ipso est timor, et non oportet ut praesumptio fiat ad ipsum cum ferro, nisi in eo quod est paruum: et tu proba ipsum, et inuestiga ipsum cum Intromisso.	 And in the same (accidental or abscess), there is fear, and it should not be presumed with iron unless it is small: and you examine it and investigate it with a probe.
Si ergo inuenis ipsum simile nodo pingui, et non est suspensum cum aliqua uenarum: tunc seca ipsum, sicut secantur nodi: et extrahe ipsum cum eo quod continet ex kisti, si est in kisti: et si non, tunc perscrutare totum eius.	 If you find it similar to a fatty node and it is not suspended by any veins: then cut it, as knots are cut; and remove it with the surrounding tissue from a chest, if it is in a chest: and if not, then examine the entire area thoroughly.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod oportet ex curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then care for the place with what is necessary for treatment, until it heals.
¶ De sectione super species Nodorum.	 Chapter on the Surgical Treatment of Knots.
Caput XLV.	 Chapter XLV.
Nodorum multae sunt species, et ego iam dixi omnes species eorum in diuisione: et oportet ut narrem hic differentiam inter Nodum, et Exituram: cum sit dubitationem faciens.	 Chapter XLV: There are many kinds of knots, and I have already said all their species in the division: it is necessary that here I explain the difference between a knot and an abscess, when there is doubt.
Dico ergo, quod cum Exitura est caliditas, et febris, et dolores uehementes, donec sedatur ebullitio superfluitatis, et completur putrefactio: tunc enim quiescunt febris et calor.	 Therefore, when an abscess is hot, and fever, and violent pains, until the boiling of the excess subsides and the rotting is completed: then the fever and heat subside.
Cum Nodo uero non est caliditas, neque febris, neque dolores, et continet eos kistis sifachin, qui est eis saccus proprius, et est secundum colorem corporis: et est incaeptio eorum sicut cicer, et fit sicut batecha, et maior et minor.	 However, when there is no heat, nor fever, nor pain in a knot, and it contains them within a chest or sac that is proper to it: and it is closed like a pea, and made like a bun, and larger or smaller.
Et sunt secundum duas species: aut pingues: aut continent humiditatem.	 And they are of two kinds: either fatty; or containing moisture.
Et colores humiditatis sunt multi, secundum quod dixi in diuisione.	 And the colors of moistures are many, according to what I have said in the division.
Oportet ergo, quando peruenis ad curationem Nodi, ut experiaris eum, et inquiras ipsum in primis cum instrumento quod nominatur Intromissum, secundum quod ueniet forma eius in capitulo quod est post hoc.	 Therefore, when you approach the treatment of a knot, it is necessary to examine and investigate it first with an instrument called a probe, according to what its form will be, as it will come in the chapter that follows this one.
Et modus inquisitionis apostematum, et Nodorum omnium est, ut accipias hoc instrumentum, et intromittas ipsum in humidiorem locum, quem inuenis in apostemate: et tu reuolue digitos tuos cum eo paulatim, donec scias quod instrumentum iam penetrauit cutem.	 The method of investigation for boils and all nodes is to receive this tool and insert it into the moist place you find in the boil: and you rotate your fingers with it gradually until you know that the tool has already penetrated the skin.
Deinde ultima manum tuam secundum mensuram magnitudinis apostematis.	 Then, lay your hand according to the measure of the size of the boil.
Deinde extrahe Intromissum, et considera illud quod egrediur in uestigio eius.	 Then remove what has been inserted and observe what comes out as its trace.
Si ergo egreditur humiditas currens, quicunque color sit: tunc seca ipsum sectione superficiali, secundum quod dixi in reliquis apostematibus.	 If therefore moisture running out comes forth, whatever its color is: then cut it off with a superficial incision, according to what I said in the other boils.
Et si non egreditur humiditas in uestigio Intromissi, tunc scias quia est pinguis: seca ergo super ipsum sectione habente formam crucis, secundum formam hanc, sicut docui te: et suspende ipsum cum uncinis, et excoria cutem ab omni parte cum facilitate: et custodi kistin si potes super illud, ut extrahas ipsam sanam cum Nodo.	 And if moisture does not come out as a trace of what has been inserted, then you know it is greasy: so cut above it with an incision in the shape of a cross, according to this form, just as I taught you: and suspend it with hooks, and scrape off the skin from all sides easily: and keep a box if possible over it, so that you extract the healthy one along with the node.
Si autem disrumpitur kistis apud operationem, et non est possibile extrahere ipsam sanam, multotiens enim accidit illud, tunc extrahe ipsam frustatim, donec non remaneat ex ea aliquid.	 But if it bursts open in the box during the operation and it is not possible to extract the healthy one, then remove it fragmentarily until there remains something of it.
Nam si remanet ex ea aliquid parum, aut multum, redit Nodus secundum plurimum.	 For if something remains little or much, the node returns to a great extent.
Quod si uincit te, et remanet ex eo parum: tunc imple uulnus apud completionem tuam, quibusdam pulueribus corrosiuis acutis: et stringe uulnus, et pone supra ipsum quod sedet apostema calidum, et cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 If it overpowers you and something remains little: then fill the wound up to your completion with some corrosive sharp powders: and bind the wound, and place on it what sits the boil warm, and care for it with the rest of the cure until it heals.
Si ergo est Nodus magnus, tunc sue duo labia eius, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat.	 If therefore the node is large, then cut open two lips of it and care for it with that which fills in.
Si autem est tibi contraria uena pulsatilis, aut non pulsatilis: tunc propera, et imple locum zegi trito, et dimitte ipsum strictum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec putrefiat uulnus, et quiescat ebullitio sanguinis: deinde redi ad incidendum illud quod remansit ex Nodo.	 But if it is pulsating vein for you or not pulsating, then hurry and fill the place with lime powder: and leave it compressed for two or three days until the wound putrefies and the boiling of blood quiets down: then return to cut what remains from the node.

Et istae sunt formae Experientium, et no, id est, perforantia: et unum eorum nominatur beris, idest, peforans: et sunt trium specierum.	 Primum est beris rotundus: cuius latitudo non sit minus decem lineas, et altitudo non sit minor quinque linearum: in cauda parte habet unguiculum, qui fieri debet quadratarum extremitatum decenter ut festinent introitum.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et medium, et paruum.	 From these there is a great one, and a middle one, and a small one.
Conueniunt, ut inuestigentur per ea apostemata, et exiturae, et fistulae, et bubones ab eo quod inter ea est ex ossibus.	 They come together so that they may be incised with lancets and cut through for abscesses, ulcers, fistulas, and boils which are among the bones.
Et aliis fiunt rotunda, tersa, lenia, sicut acus magnae quibus subsellia suuntur, ex citrino scilicet, aut ex aere, aut ferro, aut argento.	 And others are made round, polished, soft, like the large needle heads which have handles made from citron [wood], or brass, iron, silver.
Et meliora eorum sunt quae fiunt ex citrino.	 Better among these are those made of citron wood.
Et fiunt Experientia etiam de plumbo nigro, quae conueniunt ut per ea experiantur fistulae, quarum concauitate sunt reflexiones, ut reflectantur cum lenitate sua cum illis reflexionibus.	 Moreover, lead pipes are also made, which come together to test fistulas that have concave shapes, where the reflection takes place with their smoothness along with those reflections.
Et sunt iterum trium specierum.	 And they are again of three kinds.
Quoniam ex eis sunt longa, ex eis media, et ex eis breuia, secundum quantitatem amplitudinis fistulae et stricturae eius.	 Because among them there are long ones, medium-sized ones, and short ones, according to the size of the fistula and its narrowness.
Forma Vncinorum, et sunt multarum specierum.	 The shape of the cupping glasses, and they are of many kinds.
Quoniam ex eis sunt simplices, scilicet quibus est curuitas una: et sunt trium specierum sicut uides, Magni, Medii, et Parui.	 Because among them there are simple ones, those with a single curve: and they are of three kinds as you see, Large, Medium-sized, and Small.
Et ex eis sunt Vncini caeci: et sunt trium specierum.	 And among them there are blind cupping glasses: and they are of three kinds.
Et ex eis sunt uncini habentes duas curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et ex eis sunt uncini habentes tres curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et omnes isti sunt necessarii in loco suo.	 And among them there are cupping glasses with two curves: and they are of three kinds; and among them there are cupping glasses with three curves: and they are of three kinds; and all these are necessary in their places.
Et istae sunt formae Scalpellorum, quibus secantur et excoriantur Nodi, et apostemata: et sunt trium specierum: quoniam ex eis est magnum, medium, et paruum.	 And these are the shapes of knives with which nodes and abscesses are cut and scraped: and they are of three kinds; because among them there is a large one, a medium-sized one, and a small one.
Eorum extremitates quibus fit sectio sunt acutae, extremitates aliae sunt non acutae: et non ponuntur taliter, nisi ut cum eis fiat iuuamentum in excoriatione Nodorum apud timorem incisionis uenae, aut nerui: et ut sanetur per ea infirmus, et inueniat tranquillitatem parumper ex adustione quam inuenit apud excoriationem apostematis.	 The ends of those with which the cut is made are sharp, and the other ends are not sharp: they are not placed thus except for assistance in scraping nodes on account of fear of incising a vein or nerve; and so that he who is ill may be healed through them, and may find temporary relief from pain as he finds when scraping abscesses.
Istae sunt Magda, et sunt specierum trium.	 These are Magda, and they are of three kinds.
Fiunt ex aere, et sunt similia Radio, cum quo fit alcohol: et in extremitate lata est puncta Spatumilis occultata: et in ea currit ad interiora, et ad exteriora quando uis, sicut uides.	 They are made of copper and are similar to a radio; at the end is a hole called Spatumilis, hidden inside, which runs both towards the interior and exterior as you see.
Forma Spatumilium quae absconduntur inter digitos apud perforationem apostematum: et non percipiunt ea infirmi: et sunt trium specierum, magnum, medium, et paruum.	 The form of Spatumiliums hidden among the fingers near the opening of abscesses; the weak do not feel them. They come in three kinds, large, medium and small.
Fomae Ventosarum cum quibus abscinditur fluxus sanguinis: et sunt trium specierum, magnae, mediae, et paruae.	 The forms of Ventosariums for cutting blood flow; they come in three kinds, large, medium and small.
Fiant ex aere, aut citrino, rotundae, ad longitudinem parumper, sicut uides: et sint ad subtilitatem.	 Make them of copper or citron, round and slightly shorter than what you see, fine in texture.
Et oportet ut sint istae species Ventosarum apud te magnae, et paruae: ut abscindas per eas sanguinem cum uelocitate apud necessitatem, et tunc quando non est tibi praesens medicina.	 These forms of Ventosarium should be large and small with you so that in necessity you can cut blood quickly through them, and when there is no medicine present for you at hand.
Verumtamen non utaris eis in abscisione sanguinis in omni loco corporis, et non utaris nisi in locis carnosis: sicut lacertis cruris, et coxae, et lacertis brachiorum, et mammillarum, et uentris, et inguinum, et similibus eis, ex lacertis carnosis, humidis.	 However, do not use them for bleeding in any part of the body, and do not use them except in fleshy places such as the arms, thighs, shoulders, breasts, stomach, groin, and similar areas with moist flesh.
Et quandoque fiunt ex eis instrumenta parua alia similia corticibus fisticorum, secundum suam formam: quibus abscinditur sanguis quando fluit ex loco phlebotomiae, aut apud incisionem uenae, aut arteriae: et quandoque fiunt ex eis rotundae secundum hanc formam.	 Sometimes they are made into small instruments similar to the coverings of a fist, according to their shape; with which blood is cut when it flows from the place of phlebotomy or incision of vein or artery; and sometimes they are round in this way.
¶ De cura Mammillarum hominum quae mammillis mulierum assimilantur.	 Chapter on the care of human breasts resembling women's breasts.
Caput XLVII.	 Chapter LIV.
Quandoque inflantur Mammillae quorundam hominum apud complementum somni (id est, cum incipiunt pollui in somno) donec similantur mammillis mulierum: et remanent apostemosae foede.	 Sometimes the breasts of some men swell during sleep (that is, when they begin to defile during sleep), becoming like women's breasts and remaining abscessed with a foul smell.
Qui ergo abhorret illud, oportet ut secet super mammillas sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Deinde excoria pinguedinem totam.	 Who, therefore, recoils from it (the procedure), should cut across the mammary gland according to the shape of a crescent moon, following this form from line b to line g. Then scrape off the entire fat.
Postea imple uulnus ex medicamine incarnatiuo.	 Fill the wound with an ointment made of incarnated matter.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then attach two lips of the wound together with a stitch, and take care of it until it heals.
Si autem declinat mammilla ad inferiora, et mollificatur propter magnitudinem suam, sicut accidit mulieribus: tunc oportet ut findatur in duobus lateribus suis superioribus duabus sectionibus similibus figurae lunari, quarum unaquaeque continetur cum altera apud fines utriusque, donec sit linea maior continens minorem, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Postea excoria cutem quae est inter duo labia, et aufer pinguedinem, et administra quod diximus de sutura et pulueribus, quod est necessarium ex curatione, donec sanetur.	 If the mammary gland sinks downward due to its size, as happens with women: then it should be cut in two on each side of the uppermost part into two similar lunar-shaped sections, one contained within the other at their edges so that the larger line contains the smaller one, according to this form from line b to line g. Then scrape off the skin between the two lips, remove the fat and administer what I said about stitching and powders necessary for treatment until it heals.
Si autem non comples incisionem eius quod oportet te incidere, propter inquietudinem infirmi, aut propter fluxum sanguinis: tunc oportet ut impleas uulnus coto submerso unguento corrosiuo, et dimitte ipsum, donec corrodat illud quod remansit ex pinguedine.	 If you cannot complete the incision as required because of the restlessness of the sick person or due to bleeding: then fill the wound with a tightly packed corrosive ointment and leave it until it consumes what remains of the fat.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it until it heals.
¶ De perforatione apostematis, quod accidit sub Titillico.	 On the perforation of an abscess which occurs under the titillicus (a part of the cheek or jaw).
Caput XLVIII.	 Chapter XLVIII.
Ista apostemata quae accidunt sub Titillico, sunt ex speciebus Strophularum dura, quae continet kistis, et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates.	 These abscesses which occur under the titillicus are of the types of stubborn boils that contain pus, and there are those that contain moisture.
Quae ergo sunt ex eis quae continent humiditates, oportet ut secentur sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam, ex linea b. ad lineam, g. cum ergo euacuatur totum quod est in apostemate ex sanie, tunc imple ipsum coto ueteri, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	 Those that contain moisture should be cut according to the shape of a crescent moon, following this form from line b to line g. When everything that is in the abscess has been evacuated by pus, then fill it with an old dressing and leave it until another day.
Deinde auferatur cotum, et curetur cum unguento conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	 Then the wound shall be cleaned, and it shall be treated with an appropriate ointment until it heals.
Quod si apostema fuerit ex specie nodorum Strophularum, tunc scinde super ipsum, sicut diximus in sectione super Strophulas aequaliter.	 If the tumor is of the kind of knots of strawberries (boils), then cut it over as we said when cutting strawberries equally.
Si autem extenditur uulnus in hoc ut emittat pus, tunc administra in eo cauterium, secundum quod diximus in eo quod praemissum est.	 If the wound spreads so as to discharge pus, then apply a cautery, according to what was said in that which was mentioned earlier.
¶ De sectione apostematis quod accidit propter Arteriam et Venam.	 Chapter on the section of tumors due to an artery or vein.
Caput XLIX.	 Chapter 49.
Quando disrumpitur Arteria, et consolidatur cutis quae est supra eam, tuno multotiens accidit inde apostema: et similiter accidit Venae etiam, ut accidat in ea apostema et inflatio.	 When an artery ruptures and the skin above it consolidates, there often occurs a tumor; similarly, this happens with veins so that a tumor and swelling occur in them.
Et signa quibus cognoscitur, quod apostema et inflatio sint propter Arteriam et Venam, sunt: quoniam, quando apostema est propter arteriam, est longum, aggregatum in profundo corporis: et quando impellis apostema digits tuis, sentis quasi sit ei stridor.	 And the signs by which it is known that a tumor and swelling are due to an artery or vein are as follows: because when the tumor is due to an artery, it is long, aggregated in the depth of the body; and when you press the tumor with your fingers, it feels like there is a grating sensation.
Et illud quod est propter Venam, est rotundum in manifesto corporis.	 What concerns the vein is round in evident body.
Et sectio super hoc apostema est error, et praecipue quod est sub ascellis, et inguinibus, et collo, et in locis multis corporis: et est magnum ualde.	 And the incision upon this boil is an error, especially if it is under armpits, groins, neck, and in many parts of the body; and it is very great.
Oportet ergo ut deuitetur eius cura cum ferro, et quod ex eis etiam est in extremitatibus, aut in capite, oportet ut deuitetur.	 Therefore, its care must be avoided with the iron, and what is also from them in the extremities or head, it must be avoided.
Super illud ergo quod ex eis est ex inflatione orificii Arteriae, finde in cute sectione in longitudine.	 Therefore, above that which arises from the swelling of the orifice of the Artery, find incision in the skin's length.
Deinde aperi sectionem cum uncinis, postea Arteriam: et libera eam ex tunicis, donec detegatur.	 Then open the incision with scissors, then the Artery; and release it from tunics until it is exposed.
Deinde intromitte sub ea acum, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, et stringe Arteriam cum filo duplo in duobus locis, secundum quod docui te in extractione duarum Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	 Then insert a needle beneath it and make it penetrate to the other side; and tie the Artery with double thread in two places, according to what I taught you in extracting two Arteries which are in temples.
Deinde punge locum, qui est inter duo ligamenta cum spatumili, donec egrediatur sanguis qui est in eo totus, et soluatur apostema.	 Then pierce the place between two ligaments with a lancet until all the blood comes out, and the boil is dissolved.
Deinde administra curationem quae generat pus, donec cadant ligamenta: postea cura illud cum unguentis conuenientibus ad illud, donec sanetur.	 Then administer a treatment that produces pus, until the ligaments fall; then care for it with appropriate ointments until it heals.
Quod si fuerit apostema propter sectionem Venae, tunc oportet ut teneas manu tua quod tibi possibile est ex apostemate cum cute.	 If the boil is from the incision of a vein, then it is necessary that you hold with your hand what possible for you from the boil along with the skin.
Deinde intromitte acum sub loco quem tenuisti manu tua, et fac eam penetrare: et sit in ea filum duplum, donec extrahas ipsum ex latere altero.	 Then insert a needle beneath the place which you held with your hand; and make it penetrate; and let there be double thread in it until you draw it out from the other side.
Deinde liga cum ipso apostema ligamento bono: secundum quod dixi tibi in ligamento uuae, a duabus partibus cum duabus extremitatibus fili.	 Then bind with the same boil a good ligament; according to what I told you in ligating a vein, with two parts and two ends of thread.
Si autem times quod extrahatur filum, tunc intromitte acum aliam cum filo alio sub apostemate toto apud incisionem acus: preme, et stringe fila tua in quatuor locis.	 But if you fear that the thread will be drawn out, then insert another needle with a different thread beneath the entire boil near the incision; press and tie your threads in four places.
Deinde seca apostema in medio sui, donec quando egreditur quod in eo est: tunc incide superfluitatem cutis, et dimitte quod ligatum est ex ea.	 Then cut the boil in the middle of it, until when it comes out what is inside: then cut the excess skin and release what was bound from it.
Deinde pone super ipsum puluillum quem submersisti in uino, et oleo.	 Then place on top of the boil that you have immersed in wine, and oil.
Deinde administra curationem, quae fit cum liciniis et unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then administer the cure, which is made with lints and oils, until it is healed.
¶ De apostemate quod accidit ex torsione Neruorum.	 Chapter on boil occurring from twisting of nerves.
Caput L.	 Title: L. (Presumably "Libellus
Sicut accidit apostema in Arteria et Vena, similiter accidit apostema in Neruis: quod accidit in eis percussio, aut accidit a labore superfluo, et similibus: et fit plurimum illis in locis adiutoriorum, aut calcanei, et in omni loco in quo mouentur iuncturae: et est apostema graue.	 As it happens with boil on the Artery and Vein, similarly it happens with boil on Nerves: which occurs from strike or excessive labor or similar: it mostly occurs at places of joints, ankles or any place where joints are moved: and the boil is heavy.
Similatur color eius reliquo corpori, et est in pluribus dispositionibus absque dolore: et quando stringitur cum uehementia, sentit in eo infirmus simile stupori.	 It resembles the color of the rest of the body, and is in many positions without pain: and when it is squeezed with great force, one feels weak like faintness in it.
Et non est apostema aggregatum in profundo corporis, imo est sub cute, et ipsum mouetur ad omnem partem, et non uadit ad anteriora, uel ante, neque retro ad posteriora.	 And the boil is not gathered deep within the body, rather it is under the skin, and itself moves to every part, and does not reach forward or anterior nor backward to posterior areas.
Quod ergo ex eis est in iuncturis, non oportet ut inuadatur cum ferro.	 Therefore, what is in joints should not be penetrated with iron.
Fortasse enim accidet contractio.	 For perhaps it may be a contraction.
In illo autem quod ex eis est in capite, aut in fronte, finde cutem cum spatumili.	 However, in that which is in the head or forehead, puncture the skin with a lancet.
Si ergo est apostema paruum, tunc tene ipsum cum forficibus, et abscinde ipsum a radice.	 If the boil is small, then hold it with forceps and remove it from the root.
Et si est magnum, tunc suspende ipsum eum uncino, et excoria ipsum: deinde aufer ipsum, et aggrega uulnus cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 And if it is large, then hang it with a hook and remove the covering: afterwards remove it, and close the wound with suture: then treat it until it is healed.
¶ De sectione apostematis, quod accidit in uentre.	 Chapter on incision of boil occurring in abdomen.
Caput LI.	 Title: LII (presumably "Libellus
Accidunt quibusdam hominibus multotiens in uentribus eorum, et in reliquis corporibus ipsorum, thelil, quae nominantur Fungalia, per similitudinem ipsorum cum fungis.	 Occur frequently to some men in their bellies, and in the remaining parts of their bodies, a growth called "Fungalia," resembling fungi.
Quorum radix est subtilis, et ipsorum caput est grossum, et conuersa sunt labia eorum.	 Its root is subtle, and its head is thick, and they have turned lips.
Et est ex eis paruum: et est ex eis quod magnificatur ualde.	 And there is something small from them, and there is something from them that is greatly increased.
Et ego quidem iam uidi uirum, et in uentre eius erant duo thelil, quae erant magis quam rebus aliis similia fungis: non erat differentia inter ea, alba, minutae radicis, et inuersabantur labia eorum, et findebantur, et humiditas currebat ex eis semper.	 I myself have already seen a man, and in his belly there were two growths, which resembled fungi more than anything else; there was no difference between them, white, with small roots, and their lips were turned back, and they were swollen, and liquid flowed from them constantly.
Incidi ergo ea, et inueni in pondere unius quasi X et VIII uncia et in altero quasi VI uncia Et operatio in incisione eorum est, ut consideres tunc, si infirmus est humidus, et color thelil est albus, humidum, subtilis radicis: tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili lato, et sint in praesentia tua cauteria in igne.	 I cut them, and found that one weighed approximately 10 ⅜ ounces and the other approximately 6 ounces. And the operation for cutting these is, when you consider whether the sick person is weak and wet, and the growth is white, wet, with a subtle root; then cut it with a broad lancet, and have cauterization tools ready in your presence.
Multotiens enim expellitur apud sectionem eius sanguis multus: propera ergo si te uincit sanguis, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	 For many times blood is expelled during the cutting of it; therefore, if blood overpowers you, then cauterize it.
Quod si uides infirmum pauidum et timidum ab incisione cum ferro, tunc accipe filum ex plumbo decenter factum, et stringe cum eo athelul: cuius modus est quem diximus, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	 If you see a weak, fearful, and timid person from the cutting with iron, then take a well-made lead thread, and bind it with it to the athelul; whose method is as we have said, and leave it for two days.
Deinde adde in strictura plumbi.	 Then add to the narrowing of the lead.
Non ergo cesses stringere plumbum, quotiens imprimit in thelil, donec abscindatur, et cadat per se absque labore.	 Therefore do not cease to bind the lead, as long as it presses into the growth, until it is cut off and falls out by itself without effort.
Si autem thelil grossae fuerit radicis, tunc in incisione eius est quiddam timoris et pauoris: praecipue quod est in uentre.	 If the growth is thick-rooted, then there is fear and dread in its cutting; especially since it is in the belly.
Verumtamen possibile est, ut incidas medietatem eius.	 It is possible to cut through its middle.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum, ut non redeat.	 Then cauterize it, so that it does not return.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	 Then care for it until the wound heals.
Et caue ne praesumas incidere thelil quod est fusci coloris, pauci sensus, foedi aspectus: ipsum enim est apostema cancerosum: et ego ueniam cum rememoratione Cancri post hoc.	 And beware not to cut that which is black in color, with few senses and a foul appearance; for it is a cancerous aposteme; and I will come again with the reminder of Cancer after this.
¶ De cura eminentiae Vmbilici.	 Chapter on the care of umbilical hernia.
Caput LII.	 Chapter LII.
Fit eminentia Vmbilici ex caussis multis.	 A protrusion of the umbilicus occurs for many reasons.
Aut ex fissuris sifac, quod super uentrem est: et exit ex eo althub, aut intestinum, secundum quod accidit in reliquis rupturis.	 It arises either from hernias of the sciatic vein, which is above the abdomen, and exits through the anus, or it is intestine, according to what happens in other ruptures.
Aut ex sanguine qui fluit ex Vena, aut ex Arteria, secundum quod praemissum est.	 It arises either from blood flowing from a vein, or from an artery, as was mentioned before.
Aut ex uentositate coartata in eo.	 It arises from a constricted wind there.
Si autem est propter fissuram sifac, et exitum thirbi: tunc est color apostematis similis colori corporis: et est lene, absque dolore: et apparet diuersi situs.	 But if it is due to a hernia of the sciatic vein and the passage of worms: then it has the color of an abscess, similar to the body's color; it is soft, without pain; and its position appears to be diverse.
Et si est propter egressionem intestini, tunc est situs eius, cum eo quod narrauimus, uehementioris diuersitatis.	 And if it is due to the exit of intestine: then its position, as we have said, has a more violent diversity.
Cum ergo tu premis ipsum digitis tuis, occultatur: deinde redit, et fortasse est cum eo sonitus: et magnificatur multum apud introitum balnei, et laborem uehaementum.	 When you press it with your fingers, it is hidden; then it returns and perhaps there is a sound; and it swells greatly at the opening of the bath and causes strong pain.
Si uero est propter humiditatem, est lene, tunc non occultatur quando premis ipsum manu tua, neque constringium, neque additur.	 If it is due to moisture: then it is soft; it does not hide when pressed with your hand, nor is it constricted, nor does it swell.
Quod si est propter sanguinem, tunc cum istis signis apparet apostema ad nigredinem de cliue.	 If it is due to blood: then with these signs appears an abscess turning black from the navel.
Si autem est propter carnem natam: tunc est apostema graue, grossum, durum, et figitur secundum quantitatem unam.	 But if it is due to fleshy matter: then the abscess is heavy, large, hard, and heals in one portion.
Si uero est propter uentositatem, tunc tactus eius est lenis.	 If it is due to windiness: then when touched, it is soft.
Et operatio in illo est, ut consideres tunc, si eminentia umbilici est propter sanguinem Arteriae, aut Venae, aut uentositatem: tunc oportet ut prohibearis a curatione eius.	 The operation in this case is to determine whether the protrusion of the umbilicus is due to blood from an artery or vein, windiness, or moisture. Then it is necessary to prevent treatment of it.
Nam in illo est timor et pauor, sicut docui te in capitulo, in quo dixi apostemata propter arteriam et uenam.	 For there is fear and terror, as I taught you in the chapter where I said abscesses due to an artery and vein.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est propter intestinum, aut zirbum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, quatenus teneat anhelitum suum, et stet stans extensus.	 If the protrusion of the umbilicus is due to the intestine or hernia: then it is necessary that you instruct the sick one, so that he holds his breath and stands extended.
Deinde signa cum encaustro in circumitu umbilici totius.	 Then mark with the hot iron around the entire umbilicus.
Postea praecipe ei, ut resupinetur inter manus tuas super dorsum suum.	 Then instruct him to lie down beneath your hands on his back.
Deinde circunda cum spatumili lato in circumitu umbilici super locum quem signasti cum encaustro.	 Then circle with a broad spatula around the umbilicus over the place you marked with the hot iron.
Postea extende medium apostematis ad superiora, cum uncino magno.	 Then stretch out the midriff of the incision upward with a large hook.
Deinde liga eum in circumitu forti cum filo, aut cum chorda de serico ligamento firmo: et sit nodus ligamenti alenxotati.	 Then bind him around with strong thread or silk cord, and the knot should be the knot of an embroiderer's knot.
Deinde aperi medium apostematis extensum supra ligamentum.	 Then open up the extended midriff incision above the ligament.
Si ergo inueneris ipsum iam captum a ligamento: tunc extrahe alenxotati, et intromitte in ipsum digitum indicem, et impelle intestinum ad interiora uentris: et si inueneris zirbum, tunc accipe ipsum cum uncino, et incide superfluitatem eius.	 If indeed you find it already seized by the ligament: then extract it (the hernia), and insert your index finger into it and push the intestine towards the interior of the abdomen; and if you find a hernia, then take it with a hook and cut off the excess of it.
Si autem contraria est tibi arteria, aut uena: tunc circunda ipsum multum.	 But if it is an artery or vein against you: then tie it (the hernia) tightly.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam.	 Then return to your operation.
Et accipe duas acus, et intromitte in eis duo fila fortia: et intromitte duas acus in circumitu quem fecisti circa apostema in modum crucis, quas facis penetrare.	 And take two needles and insert strong threads into them; and insert two needles into the circle you made around the abscess in the form of a cross, which you pierce through.
Deinde stringe apostema in quatuor locis super acus: et si uis, aufer acus, et dimitte locum, donec putrefiat caro extensa: et cadat per se: aut incide ipsam quando subtiliatur et putrefit.	 Then stitch the abscess in four places over the needles; and if you wish, remove the needles and leave the place until the rotten flesh extends and falls off by itself; or cut it when it becomes soft and rots.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of him with the things he needs from unguents until he is healed.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est ex carne nara in eo, aut ex humiditate: tunc oportet ut concaues apostema, sicut diximus.	 If the protrusion of the umbilicus is from a tumor in him or due to moisture: then make a hollow in the abscess, as we have said.
Et extrahas sanguinem, aut humiditatem, quam inuenis in eo.	 And draw out blood or moisture which you find there.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod solidat locum.	 Then care for it with what solidifies the place.
¶ De cura CANCRI.	 Chapter on the Care of Cancer.
Caput LIII.	 Chapter LIII.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Cancri, et qualiter est uia ad curationem eius cum medicinis: et cauendum ab eo cum curatione eius cum ferro, ut non ulceretur: et diximus Cancrum generatum in matrice, et cautelam a curatione eius.	 We have already said in the division of species of Cancer, and how the way to its treatment with medicines; and it must be cautioned against using iron for its treatment lest it is wounded; we have also said that Cancer is generated in the matrix, and warned against cauterization in its treatment.
Et dixerunt antiqui, quod quandoque Cancer est in loco, ubi possibilis est eius eradicatio: sicut Cancer qui est in mammillis, aut in coxa, et eis similibus, ex membris locatis ad extrahendum totum eius: praecipue quando est incipiens paruus.	 And the ancients said that sometimes Cancer is at a place where it can be eradicated; such as cancer which is in breasts or hips and similar limbs, which are situated to extract its entirety; especially when it begins small.
Quando uero antiquatur, et est magnus, non oportet ut appropinques ei.	 But when it becomes old and large, one should not approach it closely.
Ego enim non potui sanare ex eo aliquem: neque uidi alium ante me qui peruenerit ad illud.	 For I was unable to heal anyone from that; nor did I see anyone before me reach that point.
Et operatio in eo, quando est locatus sicut diximus, est, ut praecedas, et soluas infirmum ex cholera nigra aliquotiens.	 And the operation on it, when it is situated as we have said, is to precede and dissolve a weak person from black cholera several times.
Deinde phlebotoma ipsum si inuenis cum repletione manifesta.	 Then phlebotomy that person if you find him with manifest congestion.
Deinde praepara infirmum praeparatione, in qua locetur cum operatione.	 Then prepare the sick person with a preparation in which the operation is performed.
Deinde proiice in Cancrum uncinos qui conueniunt ei.	 Then thrust awls into the Cancer which fit it.
Postea concaua ipsum ab omni parte cum cute, secundum perscrutationem, donec non remaneat aliquid ex radicibus eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere, et non abscindas ipsum uelociter, imo exprime loca, et absterge sanguinem grossum totum manu tua, aut cum quo possibile est ibi ex instrumentis.	 Then hollow out the person from all sides with skin, according to examination, until nothing remains of its roots; and let the blood flow, and do not cut or tear it quickly, rather press on the places, and remove the thick blood entirely with your hand, or as much as possible with instruments there.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi fluxus sanguinis grossi ex incisione arteriae, aut uenae: tunc cauteriza uenam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 If, however, the flow of thick blood from an incision of an artery or vein opposes you; then cauterize the vein until the blood is cut off.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then, take care of yourself with the rest of the treatment until you are healed.
¶ De cura Hydropisis.	 On the treatment of Hydrophysis.
Caput LIIII.	 Chapter LIV.
Iam narrauimus in diuisione species Hydropisis, et qualiter fit aggregatio aquae: et signa omnis speciei, et curationem eius cum medicinis.	 We now narrate on the division of types of Hydropsis, and how water accumulates; and the signs of all its species, and its cure along with medicines.
Et illa quae curatur cum ferro, non est nisi species asclitis sola: et non approximatur cum ferro speciei timpanitis: neque speciei hyposarcae penitus: nam illud mortale est.	 And the one that is to be cured with iron, is not but the sole species of ascites; it does not approach with iron the species of tympana; neither deeply the species of hypoascia, for that is fatal.
Quando tu iam medicatus es hanc speciem Hydropisis timpanitis cum medicinis, et non contulit medicatio tua: tunc considera.	 When you are already treated with medicines for this species of hydropsis of the tympana and your treatment has not helped; then consider.
Nam si infirmo iam consecuta est debilitas, aut est cum eo infirmitas alia praeter Hydropisim: sicut si sit cum eo tussis, aut uentris solutio, et similia illis: tunc caue ne mediceris ei cum ferro: quoniam est timor illud.	 For if the patient has already been weakened or there is another ailment apart from hydropsis such as cough, bowel looseness, and similar; then beware of treating him with iron, for it is dangerous.
Si autem uides infirmum exuberantis uirtutis, neque est cum eo aegritudo praeter Hydropisim solam: et non est puer, neque senex: tunc modus operationis in eo est, ut tu eleues infirmum stantem inter manus tuas, et minister post ipsum exprimat uentrem eius manu sua impellendo aquam ad inferiorem partem pectinis.	 But if you see the patient overflowing with strength and no other ailment except hydropsis alone; and he is neither a child nor an old man; then there is a method of operation in him, that you raise the weakened one standing between your hands, and a servant after him presses out his abdomen with his hand forcing the water down towards the lower part of the chest.
Deinde accipe spatumile spinosum, secundum hanc formam.	 Then take a thorny catheter (spathulum spinosum), shaped like this.
Sit duarum partium acutarum, longum, acutae extremitatis sicut Spatumile.	 It should have two pointed parts, long, with sharp tips like a catheter.
Verumtamen in eo sit quiddam breuitatis paulatim, ut non pertranseas cum eo apud operationem usque ad intestinum, et laedas ipsum.	 However, there should be something shortening it slightly, so as not to penetrate with it up to the intestines during the operation and harm it.
Deinde considera.	 Then consider.
Nam si est generatio Hydropisis ex parte intestinorum, tunc oportet ut elongeris cum sectione ab umbilico quantitate trium digitorum, ad inferiora in directo eius supra pectinem.	 For if the hydropsis is generated from the intestines, then you should extend with a section of three fingers' length below the navel towards the lower part beyond the chest.
Si uero generatio Hydropisis est propter aegritudinem epatis: tunc sit sectio tua sinistra ab umbilico tribus digitis.	 But if the hydropsis is generated from a liver ailment; then your section should be on the left side, three fingers' length below the navel.
Et si generatio eius est propter splenem, tunc sit sectio in latere dextro: et non oportet etiam ut sit sectio in latere super quod uult iacere infirmus, ut non currant superfluitates ad illum locum debilem.	 If the generation is due to the spleen, then let the section be on the right side: and it is not necessary that the section also be on the side towards which the sick man lies, lest excess fluids flow towards the weak location.
Deinde perfora cum instrumento cutem totam.	 Then pierce the skin completely with the instrument.
Deinde intromitte in illam sectionem, et eleua manum tuam cum Spatumili inter cutem, et sifac, quasi tu excories ipsum: et sit quantitas quae excoriatur quantitas unguis, aut circiter ilud.	 Then insert your hand into that incision, and push the Spatula-like instrument under the skin, as if you are scraping it; and let the quantity scraped off be equal to a fingernail or about that much.
Deinde perfora sifac, donec perueniat Spatumile ad locum uacuum: et est locus aquae.	 Then pierce the Spatula until it reaches the empty place; and that is the watery location.
Deinde extrahe ipsum, et intromitte in foramen instrumentum, cuius haec est forma.	 Then remove it (the organ), and insert the instrument into the opening, which has this form.
Et est simile cannulae: fit ex argento, aut aere, aut aurichalco, lene, tersum: cui in inferiori parte sui est foramen paruum, et in lateribus eius sunt tria foramina, duo ab una parte, et unum a parte altera: et facia est extremitas eius incisa, secundum modum incisionis calami, sicut uides: in extremitate eius superiore est armilla.	 And it resembles a cannula: made of silver, copper or gold, cleaned; at its lower part there is a small hole, and on both sides there are three holes, two from one side, and one from the other side; its end is cut in the manner of a incision of a reed, as you see; at the upper end of it there is a strap.
Nam quando instrumentum peruenit ad aquam, tunc ipsa descendit statim super instrumentum, ergo euacua ex aqua in hora quantitatem mediam.	 For when the instrument reaches the water, then the water immediately descends upon the instrument, therefore evacuate from the water a middle amount (of urine).
Quoniam si tu euacuas ex ea plus quam oportet, in hora fortasse moritur infirmus per resolutionem spiritus sui animalis: aut accidit ei syncopis quae appropinquat morti.	 Because if you evacuate more than necessary from it (the water), perhaps the sick man will die from resolution of his animal spirit; or he may have a fainting spell approaching death.
Verum euacua ex ea secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius, et secundum quod significant tibi dispositiones infirmi ex uirtute pulsus eius, et ex bonitate eius.	 But evacuate from it (the water) according to its potency, and according to what the dispositions of the sick man indicate through his pulse, and the quality of it.
Deinde extrahe instrumentum, et retine aquam.	 Then remove the instrument, and retain the water.
Quod est, quia retinetur statim propter cutem quae retinet foramen quod est super sifac: de quo narraui, ut perfores ipsum secundum illum modum.	 This is because it is immediately retained due to the skin that holds the hole above the Spatula; which I told you to pierce in this manner.
Deinde itera instrumentum die altero, si uides infirmum tolerare illud: et extrahe etiam ex aqua quantitatem paruam.	 Then on the second day, if you see that the patient can bear it, repeat the operation; and extract also a small amount from water.
Fac illud diebus aliquot sine timore, et custodi te ab errore: donec non remaneat ex aqua nisi parum.	 Be careful in the days to come, and avoid error; until there remains in water only a little.
Si autem times super infirmum, et dimittis ex aqua rem multam: tunc cura ipsum cum sepultura in harena calida, et sudore multo in balneo et sole, et expectet super sitim: et cura ipsum cum medicinis exiccatiuis, donec sanetur: et cauteriza super stomachum, et epar, et splenem, post extractionem aquae: secundum quod narraui in eo quod praecessit.	 If you fear for the patient, and let much out from water; then take care of him with hot sand and much sweating in a bath and sun, and watch over his thirst; and take care of him with the most powerful medicines, until he is cured; and cauterize above the stomach, and liver, and spleen, after the removal of water; according to what I told you in that which preceded.
¶ De cura infantium qui nascuntur locis urinae eorum non perforatis.	 Chapter on the care of infants who are born where their urinary passages have not been perforated.
Caput LV.	 Chapter LV.
Quando egreditur aliquis infantium ex uentre matris suae, et caput mutonis eius est non perforatum, aut est foramen strictum, aut in non suo loco.	 When a child is born from a mother's womb and its head is not pierced (or has a narrow opening), or it is in an incorrect position.
Oportet ergo succurrere cum perforatione eius statim cum nascitur cum Spatumili subtili ualde, secundum hanc formam.	 Therefore, one must immediately pierce (or enlarge) it with a thin spatula when the child is born, according to this shape.
Deinde pone in foramine clauum subtilem ex plumbo, et liga ipsum: et tene ipsum tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	 Then place a fine key (or nail) made of lead into the opening and tie it; hold it for three or four days.
Quando ergo uult urinam emittere, remoueatur, et mingat.	 When it wishes to emit urine, remove it, and mix it (with something).
Deinde reduc ipsum.	 Then return it.
Et si tu non ponis plumbum, iam possibile est, ut urina quae incedit super locum, non permittat ipsum claudi.	 And if you do not place the lead, now it is possible that the urine flowing over the place does not allow it to close.
Ille autem cuius foramen est strictum, medicatur cum plumbo, sicut diximus, diebus multis, donec amplificetur.	 However, if its opening is narrow, it is treated with lead, as we said, for many days, until it is enlarged.
Illi autem in quibus est foramen in non suo loco, laeduntur.	 Those in whom the opening is in an incorrect position are injured.
Quod est, quia ex eis qui nascitur, foramen est apud finem capitis uirgae: quare non potest mingere ad anteriora, donec eleuat uirgam manu sua ad superiora.	 This is because the opening is at the end of the spinal column of the child that is born; therefore, it cannot mix (the urine) toward the front, until it raises the spinal column with its own hand to a higher position.
Neque est ei generatio, propterea, quod sperma non potest peruenire ad matricem secundum rectitudinem: et est aegritudo foeda ualde.	 There is no generation in it (the child), because semen cannot reach the mother correctly; and it is a very foul illness.
Et modus operationis in illo est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum.	 The method of treatment in this case is for the sick person to lie on his back.
Deinde extende caput uirgae eius manu tua sinistra extensione uehementi, et incide caput capitis uirgae ex loco priapi, cum acumine, aut spatumili acuto: sicut est incisio calami, aut sicut tu radis aliquid, ut medium eius ueniat simile capiti uirgae: et ut cadat foramen in medio secundum quod oportet.	 Then extend the head of the spinal column with your left hand and make an incision at the location of priapus (a condition in which the penis is persistently erect) on the head of the spinal column with a sharp blade or spatula, similar to the incision of a reed, or as if you were rooting something, so that the medium comes out like the head of the spinal column and the opening falls in the middle as required.
Et caue tibi apud operationem tuam a fluxu sanguinis.	 And be careful during your operation to avoid bleeding.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	 It happens often that this occurs. (This could refer to the bleeding.)
Oppone ergo ei cum eo quod abscindit sanguinem, et cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	 Apply pressure against it when cutting blood vessels, and take care of the wound until it heals.
¶ De Albather quae accidunt in praeputio et capite uigae, et corruptione, nigredine, et adhaerentia.	 § On Albathar that occurs in the foreskin and the head of the penis, as well as decay, darkening, and adherence.
Caput LVI.	 Chapter LVI. (LVI is Roman numeral for sixty-
Multotiens accidunt istae Albather in uirga, et est eminentia carnis foedae.	 It often occurs that these Albathars happen in the penis, and it is a swelling of foul flesh.
Et ex ea alia est maligna, et alia non maligna.	 And from this one (the swelling) there is one malignant and one not malignant.
Non malignam ergo oportet ut suspendas cum uncino subtili, et abscindas eam, donec mundes eam totam.	 Therefore, the non-malignant one should be suspended with a fine hook and cut off completely until it is cleaned.
Deinde pone super eam cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio.	 Then place on it a heated plate immersed in Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud cum unguento dyafinicon, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it with dafinicon ointment until it heals. (Dafinicon is an antiseptic.)
Quod si Albather est maligna, foedi coloris, tunc oportet ut administres in ea cauterium post incisionem eius et ipsius rasionem.	 If the Albathar is malignant and foul-colored, then it is necessary to administer a cautery after the incision and removal of it.
Si autem Albather est in praeputio captiui, non circumcisi, et est pars Albather inter praeputium, et pars eius extra: tunc oportet ut auferas Albather, quae est intus in primis, donec quando consolidatur, tunc cura ipsum exterius: quoniam quando tu curas eam simul, non securatur praeputium quin preforetur.	 But if the Albathar is in a circumcised or uncircumcised foreskin, and part of it is inside and part outside: then you must remove the inner Albathar first, until it consolidates, then take care of the exterior; because when you take care of it at the same time, the foreskin will not heal and will ulcerate.
Et iam accidunt etiam in testiculis, et praeputio nigredo et corruptio.	 Also, these Albathars occur even in testicles, and blackening and decay of the foreskin.
Oportet ergo, ut tu concaues totum quod iam denigratum est, et quod uult corrumpi, aut iam corruptum est.	 Therefore, it is necessary to excavate everything that has blackened and is about to decay or has already decayed.
Deinde line super ipsum post illud cum melle quod iam concussum est cum farina corticum granatorum, et herbi tritorum cribellatorum.	 Then apply a linen cloth soaked in honey that has been pounded with flour of walnuts and sieved herbs. (This is to treat the blackened or decaying area.)
Deinde cura illud cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra cauterium cum cauterio lunari, secundum hanc formam.	 If there is a flow of blood, then administer cautery with lunar cautery in this form.
Cauterium enim est iuuatiuum ad duas dispositiones simul, scilicet ad fluxum sanguinis, et uulnus quando corrumpitur.	 For cautery is beneficial for two conditions at once, namely a flow of blood and a wound when it is damaged.
Quod si corroditur caput uirgae, et destruitur totum in hora: tunc oportet ut intromittas in meatum priapi cannulam ex plumbo, ut mingat infirmus super eam.	 If the head of a splinter is corroded and destroyed within an hour, then it is necessary to introduce a copper cannula into the urine, so that the weak urine flows over it.
In adhaerentia uero praeputii cum capite uirgae, et haec quidem adhaerentia non accidit, nisi in eo cuius praeputium est sanum, et non exigitur super ipsum circumcisio: et quandoque accidit adhaerentia propter uulnus, aut apostema: oportet ergo ut excories eam cum Spatumili obtuso, donec soluatur ligamentum, et liberetur caput uirgae ab omni parte.	 However, in the adherence of the foreskin with the head of the splinter, and this adherence does not occur unless in one whose foreskin is healthy and circumcision is not required for it; sometimes it occurs due to a wound or an abscess. Therefore, it is necessary to remove the adhered part with a spatula until the ligament dissolves and the head of the splinter is freed from all sides.
Quod si est difficile discernere ea exquisite, tunc oportet ut excories aliquid ex capite uirgae, et ex praeputio.	 If it is difficult to distinguish [the adhered part] accurately, then it is necessary to remove something from the head of the splinter and from the foreskin.
Quod est, quia praeputium quando est subtile, fortasse perforatur propter subtilitatem suam uelociter.	 Because when the foreskin is thin, it may be perforated quickly due to its delicacy.
Deinde separa inter praeputium, et caput uirgae cum panno lini subtili, qui iam madefactus est in aqua frigida, ut non adhereant iterum.	 Then separate the foreskin and the head of the splinter with a fine linen cloth that has already been soaked in cold water to prevent them from adhering again.
Deinde curetur cum uino stiptico, donec consolidetur.	 Then it is treated with wine until it solidifies.
¶ De mundificatione infantium, et curatione ex errore eis accidente.	 Section on the cleansing of infants and treatment due to an error occurring in them.
Caput LVII.	 Chapter LVII.
Circumcisio non est solutio continuitatis, sicut reliqua uulnera: uerumtamen cum sit ex operatione nostra, uoluntate nostra, et usus eius sit in pueris proprie, est necesse ut signemus in ea operationem meliorem, et uiam leuiorem perducentem ad salutem.	 Circumcision is not a solution for continuity, as are other wounds; nevertheless, since it comes from our operation, our will, and its use is proper to boys, it is necessary that we mark in it an improvement in the operation and an easier way leading to health.
Dico ergo, quod antiqui non dixerunt circumcisionem in aliquo suorum librorum: quoniam non utuntur in legibus suis, et non est nisi quod acquisiuimus per experimentum.	 I say, therefore, that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books: because they do not use it in their laws, and it is only what we have learned through experience.
Quod est, quia ego inueni maiorem partem artificum, et phlebotomatorum uti mundificatione, circumcidendo cum nouacula, et cum forficibus: et utuntur alfecati, et ligaudo cum filo, et incisione cum ungula.	 I have found that most artists and blood-letterers use cleaning by circumcising with a knife and with forceps: they employ the application of ointment, binding with thread, and cutting with a nail.
Et ego quidem iam probaui omnes istos modos, et non inueni meliorem mundificatione cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo.	 And indeed I have already proven all those methods, and I did not find a better cleaning method with forceps, or binding with thread.
Quoniam in mundificatione cum nouacula, multotiens effugit cutis.	 Because in circumcision with a knife, the skin is often missed.
Quoniam cutis praeputii duas habet tunicas: ergo forsitan inciditur cutis superior, et temanet tunica inferior: cogitur ergo ad incisionem ad incidendum alteram, et dolorem futurum.	 Because the foreskin has two layers of skin: perhaps the outer layer is cut and the inner layer is torn: it is therefore necessary to make an incision to cut the other one, and pain will result.
Et cum mundificatione quae fit per alfecati, id est, digitalis, quo utuntur sutores, non securatur incisio extremitatis uirilis membri: quoniam fortasse ingreditur in foramen eius.	 And when cleaning is done with the application of ointment, that is, digitally (as surgeons do), it is not cut off at the tip of the male organ: because perhaps it enters its opening.
In mundificatione autem cum ungula, fortasse euadit ferrum, et corrumpit operationem tuam: et cutis quidem pueri est breuis natura, et multotiens nascuntur taliter, quod non indigent mundificatione: et iam uidi illud.	 But in circumcision with a nail, perhaps the iron will enter and ruin your operation: and indeed the skin of children is naturally short, and often such cases occur that do not require cleaning: I have already seen this.
Mundificationis autem cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo, bonum experimentum detexit mihi: quoniam forfices sunt proportionalis incisionis: propterea, quod acuitas quae est superius, est sicut acuitas quae est inferius.	 But the cleaning with forceps and binding with thread showed me a good experiment: because the forceps are proportionate to the incision: therefore, the sharpness that is above is like the sharpness that is below.
Cum ergo premis manum tuam, proportionantur duae acuitates, et incidunt secundum operationem unam in tempore uno: et fit compressio simili figura, continens cutem uirgae ab omni parte, cum qua non cadit error omnino.	 And since you press your hand together, the two sharpnesses are proportionate, and they cut according to one operation in one time: and a compression is made in a similar shape, containing the skin of the penis from all sides, with which there is no possible mistake at all.
Et modus operationis propriae est, ut facias extimare, puerum praecipue, si est ex eis qui intelligunt parumper, quod tu non facis, nisi quod ligas filum in uirga sua tantum: et dimittas ipsum usque ad diem alium.	 The method of the operation is that you shall make him estimate, primarily a boy if he understands slightly, which you do not do except that you tie a thread on his rod alone; and you shall release him until another day.
Deinde fac eum gaudere et laetari omnimodo quo possibile est tibi illud, ex eo quod recipit intelligentia sua.	 Then make him rejoice and be happy in every way as much as possible for you, from the fact that he receives understanding with himself.
Deinde fac eum stare inter manus tuas praeparatae staturae, et non sit sedens: et occulta forfices in manica tua, aut sub pede tuo, ne uideat eos puer omnino, neque aliquid ex instrumentis.	 Then make him stand among your prepared hands, and let him not be sitting; and conceal the scissors in your hand or underfoot, so that the boy does not see them at all, nor anything from the instruments.
Deinde intromitte manum tuam ad uirgam eius, et suffla in cutem, et trahe eam sursum, donec egrediatur caput uirgae.	 Then insert your hand into his rod, and blow on the skin, and pull it upwards until the head of the rod appears.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex eo quod aggregatur in ea sordicie.	 Then clean it yourself from the fact that it collects dirt upon it.
Deinde liga locum signatum cum filo duplo.	 Then tie the marked place with a double thread.
Postea liga inferius eo parumper ligamentum secundum.	 Then tie below it a little ligament in second.
Deinde tene cum indice tuo, et pollice locum ligamenti inferioris retentione bona, et incide inter duo ligamenta.	 Then hold with your index finger and good pressure of the thumb, and cut between two ligaments.
Deinde eleua cutem sursum uelociter, et extrahe caput uirgae.	 Then peel off the skin quickly upward, and extract the head of the rod.
Deinde dimitte sanguinem currere paulatim (est enim melius) et pone puluerem desuper: et super puluerem pannum in quo expansus est uitellus oui decocti in aqua rosata, concussum cum oleo ros recenti bono: et dimitte eum super ipsum usque ad diem alium: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then let the blood flow slowly (for it is better), and place powder on top; and on the powder place a cloth in which a boiled lamb's wool has been spread out, mashed with fresh rose oil; and leave him on this until another day; and take care of the rest of his healing until he is healed.
Forma autem forficis ad mundificationem haec est.	 The form of the scissors for cleaning is as follows.
Sint hebetes duae extremitates, et sint incidentes: ne egrediatur in eis ramus claui: et sit longitudo duarum acuitatum, sicut longitudo duorum manubriorum aequaliter.	 Let them have two sharp points, and let them be concave; let no branch of the nail come out on them; and let the length of two cutting edges be equal to the length of two handles equally.
Error uero cadens in mundificatione est: quoniam fortasse effugit cutis intrinseca tota, aut pars eius apud incisionem.	 However, if an error occurs in cleaning, it is because perhaps the inner skin escapes completely or a part of it near the incision.
Ergo oportet, ut extendas eam ex hora tua cum ungue tuo ante apostemationem loci: et incidas eam secundum aequalitatem.	 Therefore, it is necessary to stretch it from your hour with your nail before the excision of the place and to cut it according to equality.
Quod si non potes tenere eam cum ungue tuo, tunc extrahe eam cum uncino, et incide eam.	 If you cannot hold it with your nail, then pull it out with a forceps and cut it.
Si autem praeterierint ei tres dies, et remanet quod est sub uirga inflatum, apostematum: tunc dimitte illud, donec sedetur apostema calidum, et excoria illud cum facilitate, et incide illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi: et caue tibi a capite uirgae.	 But if it exceeds three days and there remains what is under the navel inflated, it should be cut out; then let it sit until the abscess becomes hot, and scrape off the abscess easily, and cut it according to what is prepared for you; and take care of the head of the vein.
Non enim nocebit ei illud.	 It will not harm him that.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod consolidat uulnus ex pulueribus, quos narrauimus in tractatu de pulueribus: et si inciditur ex cute supra mensuram, et euadit ad superiora, non nocet ei illud etiam.	 Therefore take care of it with that which consolidates the wound with the powders, as we have said in the treatment of powders; and if it is cut through the skin beyond measure, and it reaches the surface, it does not harm him even then.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod diximus, donec sanetur.	 Therefore take care of it with that which we have said until it heals.
¶ De extractione Vrinae retentae in uesica.	 Chapter on the extraction of a retained bladder stone.
Caput LVIII.	 Chapter LVIII.
Urinae retentio in uesica, fit ab opilatione facta ex lapide, aut sanguine congelato, aut pus, aut carne nata, et similibus illis ex eis quae diximus ex modis curationis in diuisione.	 Retention of urine in the bladder is caused by an obstruction made of stone, congealed blood, pus, flesh born, and similar things from those which we have said in the treatment methods in division.
Et si non soluitur Vrina, et uides retentionem eius esse propter Lapidem, qui iam est in collo uesicae: tunc oportet ut sit infirmus super genua sua curuatus.	 And if the urine does not flow and you see that its retention is due to a stone already in the neck of the bladder; then it is necessary for him to be weakened on his knees, bent over.
Deinde componantur pedes eius super dorsum eius, et extendat uentrem suum ex superiori parte dorsi eius, et stringat infirmus anhelitum suum quantum possibile est ei.	 Then arrange his feet on top of him and he should stretch out his abdomen from the upper part of his back and squeeze his breath as much as possible.
Cogitur ergo cum collo uesicae ad expulsionem Lapidis ad posteriora: quare absoluitur Vrina.	 Therefore, he should be forced with the neck of the bladder towards expelling the stone; why the urine is released.
Quod si non soluitur cum eo quod diximus, et uehemens sit res super infirmum: tunc oportet ut administres extractionem eius cum instrumento, quod nominatur siringa, cuius haec est forma Sit ex argento, et sit subtile, lene, concauum sicut cannula pennae auis in subtilitate radii, longum in similitudine palmi unius et medii: cui sit cannula subtilis in capite eius.	 If it does not flow with what has been said and the strong man is over the weak one; then it is necessary to administer its extraction with an instrument called a syringe, whose form is like this Sit made of silver, and be subtle, soft, concave like a feather cannula in subtleness of radius, long like the palm of one hand and a half; let there be a fine cannula at its head.
Et modus exitus Vrinae per ipsum est, ut accipias filum duplicatum, et liges in extremitate eius lanam, aut cotum, ligatura bona: et intromittas extremitatem fili in inferiori parte Siringae: et incide cum forficibus si superfluit aliquid ex lana, uerum intromitte in cannulam cum uehementia, sicut alzer.	 The method of exit for the bladder stone is as follows: take a doubled thread, tie it at its end with good ligature: introduce the end of the thread into the lower part of the urethra; and cut it with scissors if there is any excess from the thread, but introduce it forcefully into the catheter like an alazer.
Deinde inunge siringam cum oleo, aut cum butyro, et albugine oui: et fac sedere infirmum super sedem, et embroca uesicam, et ipsius uirgam cum oleis humidis, et oleo oliuae, et aqua tepida.	 Then anoint the urethra with oil, or butter and white of egg: and have the patient sit on a chair, and warm the bladder, and the penis with moist oils, olive oil, and warm water.
Deinde intromitte siringam in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat ad radicem uirgae.	 Then introduce the catheter into the penis gently until it reaches the root of the penis.
Deinde dupla ipsam superius a parte umbilici.	 Then double (it) from above the navel.
Deinde impelle siringam intra ipsam, donec perueniat ad Vesicam, et sentiat eam infirmus iam peruenisse ad rem uacuam: et non fit hoc secundum hunc ordinem, nisi quoniam meatus, in quo uadit, est in quo est tortuositas.	 Then push the catheter into it until it reaches the bladder, and let the patient feel that it has reached an empty place: and this is not done according to this order unless because the passage, through which it goes, is twisted.
Deinde extende filum cum lana paulatim.	 Then extend the thread little by little with wool.
Vrina enim sequetur lanam.	 For a bladder stone follows wool.
Deinde extrahe eam, et fac currere Vrinam per uiam urinae: et itera siringam, et non cesses facere illud, donec euacuetur uesica, et inueniat infirmus alleuiationem.	 Then remove it (the stone) and make the bladder pass urine: and repeat the catheter, and do not stop doing this until the bladder is emptied and the patient finds relief.
¶ De qualitate clisterizationis uesicae cum Clepshydra.	 Chapter on the quality of clysters for the bladder with a clepsydrum.
Caput LIX.	 Chapter LIX (Roman numerals, this is the 5
Quando accidit in uesica ulcus, aut sanguis in ea congelatur, aut coartatur in ea pus, et uis distillare in eam aquas et medicinas: tunc fiat cum instrumento quod nominatur Clepshydra, et haec est forma eius.	 Chapter LIX. When there is an ulcer in the bladder, or blood congeals in it, or pus collects and it needs to distill water and medicines into it: then it should be done with the instrument called a clepsydra, and this is its form.
Est enim surda, id est, clausa.	 For it is deaf (or mute), that is, closed.
Et in eo sunt tria foramina, duo ex parte una, et unum ex parte altera, sicut uides.	 And in it (the bone) are three holes, two from one side and one from the other side, as you see.
Et locus concauus, in quo est illud quod impellit, sit secundum quantitatem quod opilet ipsum sine additione, donec quando trahitur cum eo aliquid, ex humiditatibus attrahatur: et quando impellitur, cum eo expellatur ad longinquum: secundum quod facit clepshydra, qua proiicitur naphta, id est, ignis graecus in praeliis martis.	 And the concave place, where that which drives it is located, should be of a size sufficient to contain it without addition until when something is pulled along with it, it is attracted by humidity: and when it is pushed, when it is expelled to a distance: as the clepsydras do, which project naphtha, i.e., Greek fire, in the warfare of Mars.
Cum ergo uis proiicere humiditates in uesicam, intromitte extremitatem clepshydrae in humiditatem, et trahe cum eo quod impellit ad superiora, humiditas enim trahitur in concauitatem clepshydrae.	 When you wish to project the moisture into a bladder, introduce the end of the clepsyra into the moisture and pull along with it what drives it towards the upper part; for the moisture is drawn into the hollow of the clepsyra.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem eius in uirgam, secundum quod narrauimus in siringa.	 Then introduce its end into the cane (cane being a type of long thin tube), as we mentioned in the syringe.
Deinde impelle humiditatem cum eo quod impellit illa namque humiditas peruenit ad uesicam statim, ita quod sentit eam infirmus.	 Then push moisture along with what drives it, for the moisture reaches the bladder immediately, so that it feels weakened.
Forma clisteris subtilis quo clisterizatur uesica.	 The form of a subtle enema is used to enema the bladder.
Fiat ex argento, aut auricalco: cuius caput altius sit simile alcama paruo, et sub eo sinus inter quem cadat ligamentum.	 Make it from silver or tin (an alloy of copper and tin); its head should be like a funnel with a small depression in the middle for the cord to pass through.
Deinde accipe uesicam arietis, et pone in ea humiditatem, qua uis clisterizare uesicam.	 Then take the sheep's bladder and put moisture in it with which you wish to enema the bladder.
Deinde liga eam inter duos sinus ligatura forti cum filo duplo: et calefac illam humiditatem parumper super ignem.	 Then tie the filled bladder between two small pockets (sinuses) with a strong cord and heat the moisture inside it slightly over the fire.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem clisteris in uirgam, postea stringe manum tuam super uesicam cum humiditate strictura decenti, donec sentiat infirmus, quod illa humiditas iam peruenit ad uesicam.	 Then introduce the end of the enema into the cane; afterwards, place your hand over the bladder with the moisture and press it firmly until you feel it has reached the bladder.
Si autem non est tibi praesens uesica, tunc accipe frustum pergameni, et fac ex eo circulum, et perfora ipsum ab omni rotunditate sua.	 If there is no bladder present, then take a piece of parchment (animal skin that has been scraped and cleaned), make a circle from it, and pierce a hole through its entire roundness.
Deinde intromitte filum forte in illis foraminibus, sicut reuoluuntur.	 Then insert a thread into those holes, as they are rolled up.
Deinde aggrega circulum, sicut aggregatur alsofratu: postquam tu ponis in eo illud quod uis ex humiditatibus, et oleis, et aquis.	 Then join a circle, as it is joined with a hinge: after you place within it what you wish from moist substances, and oils, and waters.
Deinde liga ipsum in instrumento: et fac cum eo sicut fecisti cum uesica ex expressione cum manu tua, donec perueniat humiditas ad uesicam.	 Then tie it up in the instrument, and do with it as you did with the bladder by pressing with your hand until moisture reaches the bladder.
¶ De extractione Lapidis.	 [Title: Extraction of a Stone]
Caput LX.	 Chapter LX (Roman numeral for sixty)
Iam diximus in diuisione species Lapidis, et curationem eius cum medicinis: et dixi differentiam inter Lapidem generatum in renibus, et uesica, et signa illius totius: et dixi Lapidem in quo cadit operatio cum manu et sectio: et est Lapis generatus in uesica proprie: et ille qui figitur in uirga: et ego sum narrans illud cum expositione manifesta et abbreuiatione.	 We have already said about the nature of the Stone and its treatment with medicines, and the difference between the Stone generated in kidneys, bladder, and its signs altogether; we have also said that the operation on the Stone is performed by hand and section; and it is the Stone generated specifically in the bladder that is meant; and he who is formed in the penis; and I am telling this with manifest explanation and abbreviation.
Dico ergo, quod Lapis generatus in uesica, plurimum accidit pueris.	 The Stone generated in the bladder happens most often to children.
Et ex signis eius est, quod urina egreditur ex uesica similis aquae in subtilitate sua: et apparet in ea harena alba, et fricat infirmus uirgam suam, et laborat cum ea, et multotiens pendet.	 And among its signs is that urine comes out from the bladder similar to water in thinness; and it appears there white sand, and the sick man rubs his penis, and labors with it, and often hangs down.
Deinde erigitur, et egreditur cum eo anus in multis eorum.	 Then it erects, and comes out together with the anus in many of them.
Et est facilis sanatio puerorum, ex eo usquequo consequuntur quatuordecim annos.	 The cure for children is easy until they reach the age of fourteen.
Et est difficilis in senibus.	 And it is difficult in old people.
In iuuenibus autem est media, in eo quod est inter illud: et eius cuius Lapis est maior, curatio facilior: et si paruus, est econuerso illius cura.	 In young men it is of medium difficulty, because it is between that and its size; and the larger the Stone, the easier the cure; and if it is small, the reverse is true for the cure.
Cum ergo peruenimus ad curationem, oportet in primis, ut mundificemus infirmum cum clisteri, quod extrahat totum stercus quod est in intestinis suis: ipsum enim quandoque prohibet inuentionem Lapidis apud inquisitionem.	 When we arrive at the treatment, it is first necessary to cleanse the sick man with an enema, which removes all feces that are in his bowels; because sometimes it hinders the discovery of the Stone during the investigation.
Deinde accipiatur infirmus cum pedibus suis, et concutiatur, et moueatur ad inferiora: ut descendat Lapis ad profundum uesicae, aut saliat de loco alto aliquotiens.	 Then the sick man is received with his feet, beaten, and moved downward; so that the Stone descends to the bottom of the bladder or sometimes jumps from a high place.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas praeparatum, et manus eius sint sub coxis ipsius, ut fiat uesica tota decliuis ad inferiora.	 Then make him sit between your hands, and his hands should be under his hips; so that the bladder becomes completely descended towards the lower part.
Deinde perquire eum, et tange eum extrinsecus.	 Then examine him and touch him externally.
Si ergo sentis Lapidem in spacio, tunc propera statim cum sectione super ipsum.	 If therefore you feel a stone in the space, then hurry immediately with cutting upon it.
Quod si non cadat sub tactu tuo omnino, tunc oportet ut abstergas digitum indicem cum oleo manus sinistrae, si infirmus est puer: aut digitum medium si est iuuenis completus: et intromittas ipsum in anum suum, et perquire de Lapide, donec stat sub digito tuo: et conuerte eum paulatim ad collum uesicae.	 If it does not fall under your touch entirely, then you should push aside the finger of the right hand with oil, if the patient is a weak child; or the middle finger if the patient is an adult man; and insert it into its own anus, and inquire about the stone, until it lies beneath your finger; and gradually turn it towards the neck of the bladder.
Deinde preme super ipsum cum digito tuo, et impelle ipsum ad exteriora aduersus locus, cuius sectionem uis: et praecipe ministro, ut premat uesicam manu sua, et praecipe alii ministro, ut extendat testiculos manu sua dextra ad superiora: et alia manu sua, ut remoueat cutem, quae est sub testiculis in parte a loco in quo est sectio.	 Then press upon it with your finger and push it towards the outside against the place where you wish to make an incision; and command the attendant to press the bladder with his hand, and command another attendant to extend the testicles of the right hand upwards; and with the other hand, remove the skin that is under the testicles in the part from the place where the incision is to be made.
Deinde intromitte Spatumile incidens, cuius forma haec est.	 Then insert a spatula cutting tool, which has this shape.
Et finde in eo quod est inter anum et testiculos, et non in medio, ad latus natis sinistrae: et sit sectio super ipsum lapidem, et digitus tuus sit in ano: et fiat sectio transuersa, ut sit sectio exterius ampla, et interius stricta, secundum quantitatem quod sit possibile egressio Lapidis ex ea non maior.	 And find it where it is between the anus and testicles, not in the middle, on the side of the left buttock; and make the incision over the stone, and your finger should be in the anus; and make the incision transverse, so that the incision is wide outside and narrow inside, according to the quantity by which the exit of the stone from it may not be greater.
Fortasse enim comprimit digitus, qui est in ano Lapidem apud sectionem, et egreditur absque difficultate.	 For perhaps the finger presses the stone that is in the anus at the incision, and comes out without difficulty.
Et scias, quod ex Lapide est cui sunt anguli et margines, quare fit difficilis exitus eius propter illud.	 And know that from the stone are its corners and edges, for this reason the exit of it is difficult because of that.
Et ex eo est lenis, similis glandulae, et rotundus: et fit facilis egressus eius.	 And from it is smooth, like a nut, and round; and the exit of it is easy.
Ei ergo cui sunt anguli, et margines, adde in fissura.	 To him who has corners and edges, add them into the incision.
Quod si non egreditur ita, tunc oportet ut ingenies super ipsum: aut stringas super eum cum gesti decenter, cuius extremitas sit sicut Luna, quae stringat super Lapidem, et non euadat ab ea: aut ut intromittas sub eo instrumentum subtile, curuatae extremitatis.	 If it does not come out in this way, then you should pierce it; or tighten it over it with pliers, whose end is like the moon, which presses on the stone and does not slip off from it; or insert a sharp tool under it, curved at its tip.
Si autem non potes super cum, tunc amplifica foramen parumper.	 If however you cannot go over it, then widen the opening slightly.
Quod si uincit te aliquid ex sanguine, abscinde ipsum cum zegi.	 If something in the blood opposes you, cut it out with scissors.
Si uero lapis est plus quam unus, tunc impelle in primis magnum ad os uesicae.	 If there are more than one stone(s), first drive a large one into the bladder bone.
Deinde incide super ipsum.	 Then cut upon it.
Postea impelle paruum post illud: et similiter fac si sunt plures duobus.	 Then push in a smaller one after that, and do the same if there are more than two.
Quod si magnus est ualde, tunc ignorantia est ut seces super ipsum sectione magna.	 If it is very large, then ignorance is to cut through it with a great incision.
Quoniam accidit infirmo una duarum rerum, aut ut moriatur, aut accidit ei distillatio urinae assidua: proptera, quia non consolidatur locus omnino.	 Since it happens to the sick that either one of two things occurs, namely death or continuous discharge of urine; therefore, because there is no consolidation in the place at all.
Verum administra expulsionem eius, donec egrediatur: aut ingenia in fractura eius cum forficibus, donec extrahas eum frustatim.	 But administer its expulsion until it comes out; or bind up the fracture of it with forceps, until you draw it out piece by piece.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc imple uulnus thure, et aloe, et sanguine draconis: et stringe ipsum, et pone super ipsum pannum infusum oleo et uino, aut oleo rosato, et aqua frigida: ut sedetur apostema calidum.	 When you have therefore completed your operation, then fill the wound with turpentine, aloe, and dragon's blood; bind it up and place upon it a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or rose oil, and cold water; that the abscess may settle down warm.
Deinde resupina infirmum super collum suum, et non soluas ligamentum, usque ad diem tertium.	 Then turn the sick person on his neck and do not unbind the bindings until the third day.
Cum ergo solueris ipsum, embroca locum cum aqua, et oleo multo.	 When you unbind it, smear the place with oil and water.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dyafinicon, et unguento basilicon, donec sanetur.	 Then treat him with diaphinicon ointment and basilicon ointment until he is healed.
Si autem accidit in uulnere apostema calidum additum, et corrosi, et illi similia: sicut si congeletur sanguis in uesica, et prohibeatur ex eo urina: et cognoscitur illud ex egressione sanguinis cum urina.	 If, however, an abscess hot and corrosive is added to the wound, and similar things occur as if the blood congeals in the bladder, and urine is prevented from coming out of it; and it is known that this occurs through the discharge of blood along with urine.
Intromitte ergo digitum tuum in uulnus, et extrahe illum sanguinem.	 Therefore, insert your finger into the wound and draw out the blood.
Nam si remanet, prouocat ad corruptionem uesicae, et putrefactionem eius.	 If it remains, it provokes the corruption of the bladder, and its putrefaction.
Deinde ablue uulnus cum aceto, et aqua, et sale: et oppone omni speciei cum eo quod conuenit ex curatione, usquequo sanetur.	 Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt; and apply any remedy that agrees with its cure until it heals.
Et oportet in horis curationis totius, ut liges duas coxas, et aggreges, caussa medicinarum quae ponuntur super locum.	 It is necessary during the entire period of treatment that bandages be applied to both thighs and joined together, because of the medicaments placed upon the site.
Quod si lapis est paruus, et sit in meatu uirgae, et figitur in eo, et prohibetur urinae exitus: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod narro antequam peruenias ad sectionem.	 If the stone is small and is in the channel of the spermatic cord, and it obstructs the flow of urine; then treat it with what I have mentioned earlier before reaching the section.
Multotiens enim a sectione excusaris per hanc curationem, iam enim probaui illud.	 For often you are excused from this treatment by means of the operation, for I have already proven that.
Et est, ut accipias Perforatorium ex ferro alferico, cuius haec est forma, triangulatae extremitatis, acutum, fixum in ligno.	 And it is to be received the Perforator, made of iron alnifar, whose form is triangular at the end, sharp and fixed in wood.
Deinde accipe filum, et liga cum eo uirgam sub lapide ut non redeat ad uesicam.	 Then take thread, and tie it around the spermatic cord beneath the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.
Deinde intromitte ferrum perforans in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat Perforatorium ad ipsum lapidem: et reuolue Perforatorium manu tua in ipso lapide paulatim: et coneris perforationem eius, donec facias ipsum penetrare a parte altera.	 Then introduce the perforating iron into the spermatic cord with ease, until the Perforator reaches the stone; and rotate the Perforator in the stone slowly with your hand; and you will make a hole in it, until you cause it to penetrate from the other side.
Urina namque absoluitur statim.	 For urine is immediately released.
Deinde preme manum tuam super illud quod remansit ex lapide ab exteriori parte uirgae.	 Then press your hand upon what remains of the stone from the outside part of the spermatic cord.
Ipse enim frangitur, et egreditur cum urina, et sanatur infirmus.	 It breaks and is released with the urine, and the weak man becomes well.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi haec curatio, propter aliquid quod prohibet ab illo: tunc liga filum sub lapide, et filum aliud supra lapidem.	 If this treatment is not prepared for you because of something that prevents it from being done; then tie thread beneath the stone and another thread above the stone.
Deinde seca super lapidem in ipsa uirga inter duas ligaturas.	 Then cut across the spermatic cord above the stone between the two bindings.
Deinde extrahe ipsum.	 Then extract it.
Postea solue ligamentum, et mundifica sanguinem congelatum, qui fit in uulnere.	 After that, loosen the ligament, and clean up the frozen blood which is made in the wound.
Et non est necessarium ligamentum fili sub lapide, nisi ut non redeat ad uesicam: et ligamentum aliud desuper, nisi ut quando soluitur filum post egressionem lapidis, redeat cutis ad locum suum, et cooperiat uulnus: et propter illud necesse est tibi illud quando ligas filum superius, ut eleues cutem ad superiora, ut redeat apud complementum tuum, et cooperiat uulnus, sicut diximus.	 It is not necessary to tie a thread under the stone, unless it does not return to the bladder: and another ligament on top, unless when the thread is loosened after the stone's departure, the skin returns to its place, and covers the wound: and for this reason, you must do that when you tie a thread above, in order to lift the skin towards the higher parts, so that it returns to its complement, and covers the wound, as we said.
¶ De extractione Lapidis mulierum.	 Chapter on the extraction of stones in women.
Caput LXI.	 Chapter LXI.
Parum generatur Lapis in mulieribus.	 A small amount of stone is generated in women.
Si autem accidat alicui earum lapis, tunc difficilis est curatio, et prohibetur propter modos multos.	 If however a stone should occur to any of them, then the treatment is difficult and it is forbidden because of the many modes.
Vnus eorum est: quod mulier fortasse est uirgo.	 One of them is: that the woman perhaps is a virgin.
Et secundus est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem quae detegat seipsam medico, quando est casta, aut ex habentibus maritos.	 And the second one is, because you will not find a woman who reveals herself to the doctor when she is chaste, or those with husbands.
Tertius est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem bene scientem hanc artem, praecipue operationem cum manu.	 Thirdly, because you will not find a woman well knowing this art, especially the operation with hand.
Et quartus est longinquitas a loco lapidis: quare indiget sectione profunda, et in illo est timor.	 And fourthly, distance from the place of the stone: wherefore deep incision is needed, and there is fear.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad illud, tunc oportet ut accipias mulierem medicam, bene scientem: et parum inuenitur.	 If necessity forces it, then it is necessary that you receive a woman doctor, well knowing: and there is little to be found.
Si uero priuaris ea, tunc quaere medicum castum, subtilem, et praesenta mulierem obstetricem bene doctam in re mulierum, aut mulierem quae in hac arte innuit partem artis: fac ergo eam praesentem, et praecipue ei, ut faciat totum quod praecipis ei ex inquisitione super lapidem.	 But if you are not allowed by her, then seek a chaste doctor, subtle, and a present midwife well-trained in women's matters, or a woman who is familiar with this art: make her present, and especially to her, that she does everything which you command her according to the investigation about the stone.
In primis quod est, ut aspiciat si mulier est uirgo: tunc oportet ut intromittat digitum in anum eius, et quaerat lapidem.	 First of all, that it is to look if the woman is a virgin: then it is necessary for him to insert his finger into her anus and search for the stone.
Si ergo inuenit ipsum, coartet eum sub digito suo, et tunc praecipe obstetrici, ut intromittat digitum suum in uuluam infirmae, et inquirat super lapidem, postquam ponit manum suam sinistram super uesicam, et comprimit eam compressione bona.	 If therefore he finds it (the stone), he should grasp it with his finger, and then command the midwife to insert her finger into the weak bladder, and inquire about the stone, after she has placed her left hand on the bladder and compresses it with a good pressure.
Si ergo inuenit lapidem, tunc oportet ut gradatim moueat eum ab orificio uesicae ad inferiora cum summa uirtutis suae, donec perueniat cum eo ad radicem coxae.	 If therefore he finds it (the stone), then he must carefully move it from the opening of the bladder to the lower parts with all his strength, until it reaches the root of the hip bone.
Deinde secet super eum apud oppositionem medietatis uuluae apud radicem coxae, ex quacunque parte praeparatur ei, et sentit lapidem in illa parte: et digitus eius non remoueatur a lapide, coartans sub eo: et sit sectio parua in primis.	 Then he cuts it at the opposition of the mid-bladder at the root of the hip bone, from whatever side it is prepared for him, and feels the stone in that place; his finger must not be removed from the stone, pressing on it; and the cut should be small at first.
Deinde intromittat radium super illam sectionem.	 Then insert a probe over that incision.
Si ergo sentit lapidem, tunc addat in sectionem secundum quantitatem proportionatam quod lapis egreditur ab ea.	 If he feels the stone then he adds to the incision according to the amount proportional to what the stone comes out from it.
Et scias, quod species lapidis sunt multae.	 And know that the shapes of stones are many.
Ex his enim est paruus, et magnus, lenis et asper, longus, et rotundus habens ramos.	 For it (the stone) may be small or large, smooth or rough, long or round having branches.
Scias ergo species eius, ut significetur tibi per hoc super illud quod uis.	 Therefore know its shape, so that it is indicated to you about that which you wish.
Si ergo uincit te sanguis, tunc adde in loco zegi tritum, et tene ipsum hora una, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 If blood overcomes (you), then add in the place of the sieve ground up, and hold it for an hour until the blood is cut off.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis: et fac, ut praepares tecum ex instrumentis, quae dixi in extractione lapidis in uiris, ut adiuueris per ea in operatione tua.	 Then return to your operation until the stone comes out; and make sure you prepare yourself with the instruments that I have mentioned for the removal of stones in men, so as to assist in your operation.
Quod si uincit te fluxus sanguinis, et scis quod expulsio sanguinis est ex arteria quae incisa est: tunc pone puluerem super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis strictura decenti: et non mutes illud: et dimitte lapidem, et non extrahas ipsum.	 If the flow of blood overcomes (you) and you know that the expulsion of blood is from an artery that has been cut; then apply powder on it and bind it with suitable ligatures; do not move that; and let the stone remain, and do not extract it yourself.
Fortasse enim morietur mulier infirma.	 Perhaps a weak woman may die.
Deinde cura uulnus.	 Then treat the wound.
Cum ergo sedatur acuitas sanguinis post dies, et putrefit locus, tune redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis.	 When, therefore, the sharpness of the blood subsides after days, and the place rots, then return to your treatment, until the stone comes out.
¶ De sectione suiper Herniam aquosam.	 Chapter on the division of a watery hernia.
Caput LXII.	 Chapter 62.
Ramex aquosa non est, nisi aggregatio humiditatis in sifac albo, quod est sub cute testiculi continente ouum: et nominatur sifac.	 A watery tumor is not anything but an accumulation of moisture within the albucocycle, which is situated under the skin of the testicle and is called albucocycle.
Et quandoque est in panniculo proprio sibi, quem praeparauit ei natura in parte oui, donec putetur: quod est ouum aliud, et est cutis testiculi inter sifac album, quod diximus: et non fit illud nisi raro.	 And sometimes it is within its own proper pannicle that nature has prepared for it in the part of the testicle until it feels like a different egg; this is the skin of the testicle between the albucocycle, which we have mentioned, and such does not usually occur except rarely.
Et generatio quidem huius ramicis, est ex debilitate quae accidit testiculis: quare effunditur ad eos haec materia.	 And indeed the generation of this [tumor] is due to weakness which happens to the testicles; hence this material flows towards them.
Et quandoque accidit ex percussione super testiculos.	 And sometimes it occurs from a blow upon the testicles.
Et haec humiditas est habens colores multos.	 And this moisture has many colors.
Aut enim est color eius decliuis ad citrinitatem, aut est sanguineus rubeus, aut faeculentus, niger, aut est aquosus albus, et est illud quod est plus.	 For it can be of a yellowish-brown color, or blood red, or greenish-black, or watery white, and this is the worst of them all.
Et signa quibus scitur ubi sit aggregatio aquae, sunt ista.	 And signs by which it can be known where the accumulation of moisture is located are these:
Nam si est in sifac albo quod diximus, tunc apostema est rotundum ad longitudinem parumper sicut figura oui: et non apparet testiculus, quoniam humiditas continet eum ab omni parte.	 If it is in the white flesh as we said, then the aphthae is round and slightly smaller in length, like the figure of an eye: and the testicle does not appear, since moisture keeps it contained from all sides.
Et si est humiditas in panniculo proprio sibi, tunc apostema est rotundum cum parte oui, et propter hoc extimat homo quia est ouum aliud.	 If there is moisture within its own flesh, then the aphthae is round like part of an eye, and therefore man consumes it because it is another egg.
Et si humiditas est inter cutem testiculorum et sifac album, tunc cadit sub sensu.	 If there is moisture between the skin of the testicles and white flesh, then it falls under the sense [of touch].
Quando ergo uis cognitionem coloris humiditatis, tunc experire colorem humiditatis in apostemate cum Intromisso quadrato, cuius forma praecessit.	 Whenever one desires to know the color of the moisture, then test the color of the moisture in an aphthae with a square probe, whose shape has been described before [in the text].
Secundum illud ergo quod egreditur in uestigio Intromissi, iudica de illo quod est inter ipsum.	 Accordingly, as it comes out on the track of the probe, judge concerning that which is between [the aphthae] itself.
Cum ergo uenimus ad curationem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, ut phlebotometur si possibile est ei illud, et uides corpus eius plenum.	 When we come to the treatment with iron, then you must command the sick man to be bled if it is possible for him, and see his body full [of blood].
Deinde resupinetur super dorsum suum super rem altam parum, et pone sub eo pannos multos.	 Then he lies down on his back on a low bench and places many cloths under himself.
Deinde sede tu super sinistram eius, et praecipe ministro, ut sedeat a dextra eius, qui extendat uirgam eius ad unum duorum laterum cutis testiculorum, et ad partem mirach uentris.	 Then you sit on his left side and command the servant to sit at his right, who extends his arm to one side of two layers of skin of the testicles, and to the upper part of the abdomen.
Deinde accipe spatumile latum, et seca cutem testiculorum ex medio per longitudinem, usque prope pectinem: et fiat sectio secundum rectitudinem aequedistantis lineae quae diuidit cutem testiculorum, donec perueniat ad sifac album comprehendens: et excoria ipsum et obserua, uel caue ex hoc, ut seces ipsum: et sit excoriatio tua qua ipsum excorias, ex parte quae suspenditur cum ouo plus: et subtiliter scrutare cum excoriatione secundum quantitatem quod tibi possibile est.	 Then take a broad spatula, and cut the skin of the testicles from the middle along its length to almost the comb [of pubic hair]: and make the incision according to the rectitude of an equidistant line that divides the skin of the testicles, until it reaches the white flesh enclosing [the testicle]: and scrape it off and observe, or be careful not to cut it: and your scraping should be on the side which hangs more with the egg: and subtly examine with the scraping according to the quantity that is possible for you.
Deinde perfora sifac plenum aqua perforatione ampla, et extrahe totam aquam.	 Then perforate a bladder full of water with a large perforation and remove all the water.
Deinde separa inter duo labia sectionis cum uncinis, et extende sifac ad superiora, et non tangas cutem testiculorum comprehendentem: et incide sifac qualitercunque est possibile tibi incidere ipsum, aut cum totalitate sua, aut frustatim, praecipue latus eius subtile.	 Then separate the two lips of the incision with scissors, and extend the bladder to above and do not touch the skin that covers the testicles holding it: and cut the bladder as you can cut it, either entirely or in pieces, especially the subtle side of it.
Nam si tu non exquisite perscrutaris, in incisione eius non fit securitas, quin aqua redeat.	 For if you do not carefully examine, there is no certainty that water will not flow out through the incision.
Si autem procedit ouum exterius a cute sua in hora operationis tuae: tunc quando compleueris sectionem sifac, reduc ipsum.	 If however an egg comes out externally from its covering during your operation hour: then when you finish the bladder incision, return it.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cutis testiculorum cum sutura.	 Then join together the two lips of the scrotal skin with a stitch.
Deinde cura ipsum sicut reliqua uulnera, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it as you would any other wound until it heals.
Quod si inuenis ouum corruptum ex nigredine alia, tunc oportet ut liges uasa, quae sunt suspensorium, timens fluxum sanguinis.	 If however you find a rotten egg due to some discoloration, then it is necessary that you tie off the vessels, which are the supports, fearing bleeding.
Deinde abscinde testiculum cum suspensorio, et extrahe ouum: postea cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	 Then remove the testicle along with its support and extract the egg: afterwards care for it as we have said.
Si uero aqua est aggregata in duabus partibus, tunc scias quia sunt duae ramices: seca ergo partem aliam secundum quod fecisti in altera aequaliter.	 If however water is gathered in two parts, then you know that there are two branches: therefore cut the other part equally as you did with the other one.
Et si aequatur tibi, ut sit operatio una, tunc fac: deinde absterge sanguinem.	 And if it seems to you that the operation should be one, then do so: afterwards remove blood.
Et intromitte in sectiones lanam submersam in oleo, aut in oleo rosato: et pone deforis lanam aliam quam submersisti in uino et oleo, et expande eam super duos testiculos, et mirach uentris: et pone desuper pannos duplicatos, et sunt puluilli: et liga eos desuper cum ligamento, quod est habens sex secundum hanc formam.	 And insert a thread submerged in oil or rose oil into the incisions: and place another thread soaked in wine and oil on the outside and spread it over both testicles, and examine the intestines: and put double cloths on top, and they are pockets: and tie them above with a ligament that has six knots.
Deinde sumantur duo panni, et suantur, et impleantur la na carminata, secundum hanc similitudinem: et fiant extremitates quibus premitur ex coto, aut lana humida: et aggregentur cum strictura in lumbari bracharum: et una extremitatum accipiat super anum usque ad dorsum, et secunda accipiat ad partem pectinis: et duae extremitates super duas coxas inferius, et duae extremitates aliae super duo inguina, et aggregetur strictura tota in lumbari bracharum.	 Then two pieces of cloth are taken, washed and filled with a carminated linen, as follows: and the ends that are pressed together are made from leather or moist thread: and they are sewn together at the waist: and one end reaches from the anus to the back, and the second reaches to the neck area: and two ends below reach to both thighs, and two other ends above reach to both groins, and the entire stitch is sewn at the waist.
Et, quandoque artificialiter medicatur haec ramex cum cauterio loco sectionis cum ferro: et est, ut accipias cauterium cultellare subtile, et seces cum eo cutem testiculorum: et est ignitum, secundum quod narrauimus: donec quando detegitur sifac album continens aquam: tunc accipe cauterium, secundum hanc formam.	 And sometimes artificially this ramie stalk is healed with a cautery at the place of section with iron; and it is that you take a sharp-edged cautery, and cut the skin of the testicles with it; and it is ignited, as we have narrated; until when the sifac (white band) containing water is exposed; then take the cautery in this form.
Assimilatur literae graecae.	 This phrase translates to "Assimilation of Greek letters.
Deinde perfora cum eo illud sifac, et est ignitum, donec egrediatur humiditas tota.	 Then pierce it with that [the cautery], and let it be ignited until all the moisture comes out.
Deinde extende sifac cum uncinis, et excoria cum cauterio subtili ignito, et incide ipsum secundum quod possibile est tibi, donec eradices totum eius.	 Then stretch the sifac (white band) with the hook, and scrape it off with a sharp-edged cautery that has been ignited, and cut it as far as possible for you, until you have removed everything of it.
Et caue ex ouo, ne tangat ipsum ignis.	 And be careful not to let the fire touch the egg (testicle).
Et scias, quod haec operatio est saluior, et longinquior a fluxu sanguinis, et melior quam operatio cum sectione.	 And know that this operation is healthier, more distant from bleeding, and better than the operation with section.
Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit in hora sectionis, aut in hora cauterii apostema calidum, aut fluxus sanguinis, aut aliquid aliud: tunc oportet ut cures quod contrarietatem tibi facit ex illo cum curatione quae conuenit ei, secundum quod praemissum est.	 If however it happens that it causes an opposition to you in the hour of section or in the hour of cautery, or a boil (abscess), or bleeding, or something else; then it is necessary for you to treat what causes the opposition from that with a suitable cure, according to what has been mentioned previously.
Si autem infirmus est timidus, et non expectat super hanc operationem, propter horribilitatem suam: tunc administra perforationem secundum quod ego narro illud: et est.	 If however the sick man is afraid and does not await this operation because of its horror; then administer a puncture according to what I narrate below, and it is.
Quando certificatur tibi apud te per illud quod diximus de significationibus, quod ramex est aquosa: tunc oportet quod facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	 When it is assured to you by what has been said about signs that the ramie stalk is watery; then it is necessary for you to make the sick man sit on an elevated seat.
Deinde perfora apostema in inferiori parte sui cum spatumili lato: et pone perforationem secundum longitudinem corporis, et sit apertio ampla, donec currat aqua tota.	 Then puncture the boil (abscess) at its lower part with a large spatula; and place the puncture in line with the body, and let the opening be wide until all the water runs out.
Deinde pone super locum cotum, et liga ipsum, et dimitte ipsum ut currat residuum aquae: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	 Then place over the wound a cloth, and tie it, and let it run free to drain the remaining water; then take care of it until the wound heals.
Si autem contrarietas sit egressioni aquae in hora qua perforas ipsam: et non sit illud nisi propterea, quia panniculus albus contrarietatem facit in orificio uulneris, et prohibet exitum aquae: tunc oportet ut intromittas pennam in uulnus, aut instrumentum cum quo extrahitur aqua hydropicorum, cuius forma praecessit: aut adde in operatione uulneris parumper.	 If there is obstruction to the flow of water at the time when you open it [the wound], and this is not for the reason that a white cloth obstructs the opening of the wound and prevents the exit of water, then it is necessary to insert a feather into the wound, or an instrument with which water from hydropic swellings is removed, whose shape has been described earlier; or add slightly in the operation of the wound.
Et scias, quod aqua redit, et aggregatur post sex menses, aut circiter eos.	 And know that water returns and accumulates after six months, or about those.
Cum ergo aggregatur, tunc pertoretur secundum eundem modum, et pertransibit infirmus dies suos.	 When it [the water] accumulates, then it should be drained in the same way and the sick days will pass.
¶ De cura Ramicis carnosae.	 Chapter on the care of fleshy roots (radishes).
Caput LXIII.	 Chapter LXIII.
Scias, quod in sectione super hanc Ramicem, est ex timore perducente ad perniciem in pluribus dispositionibus.	 Know that when cutting through this radish, there is danger of leading to death in many ways.
Quapropter uidetur mihi eius dimissio saluari ex ea.	 Therefore it seems to me that its abandonment [radish] would be saved from it [danger].\]     Et sic de omnibus his, quae scripsi de Ramice carnose et de al
Et ego sum rememorans operationem in ea, et species apostematis.	 And I recall the operation in her [radish], and the appearance of excisions.
Dico ergo, quod accidunt apostemata multa in corporibus, ex quibus componuntur testiculi: et fit illud ex caussis multis, scilicet.	 I say that many excisions occur in the body, from which testicles are made; and this is due to many causes, namely.
Aut ex superfluitate acuta, uel acri, quae effunditur ad testiculos.	 Or from an excess of sharp or acid fluid that flows towards the testicles.
Aut ex percussione.	 Or from a blow [or injury].\]     Aut ex expositione sol
Et est color apostematis secundum colorem corporis, et non inuenitur ei dolor: et est apostema graue.	 And the color of an excision is according to the color of the body, and no pain is found in it; and it is a serious excision.
Et fortasse est apostema lapideum, cuius color est fuscus, et non est sensus ei.	 And perhaps it is a stone-like excision, whose color is black, and there is no sensation in it.
Et quandoque fit ex nodatione arteriarum, et inflatione earum: sicut iam praecessit eius rememoratio: aut ex inflatione uenarum.	 And sometimes it occurs from the knotting and swelling of arteries, and its inflammation; as I have already mentioned its recall; or from the inflammation of veins.
Quod ergo est ex eis ex inflatione arteriarum, cognoscitur per dispositionem apostematis, quando comprimis ipsum digitis tuis.	 What is from them due to inflammation of the arteries, is recognized by the arrangement of an abscess, when you compress it with your fingers.
Et non oportet ut tangas ipsum prorsus.	 It is not necessary for you to touch it completely.
Illud uero quod fit ex inflatione uenarum, non dispergitur ex eo aliquid apud compressionem cum digitis.	 However, that which comes from the inflammation of veins, does not spread out anything when compressed with fingers.
Et iam possibile est, quod super hanc speciem fiat sectio, et super reliquas carnes: et est, ut seces cutem testiculorum.	 And now it is possible to make an incision on this kind and on the remaining flesh; and there is a custom to cut the skin of testicles.
Deinde extende ouum ad sursum, et extrahe ipsum cum sifach albo: et libera suspensorium ex uasis, et liga uasa: et incide suspensorium postquam tu liberas ipsum ab omni parte ex partibus oui.	 Then stretch the egg upward, and extract it with a white swab; and free the suspending ligaments from the vessels, and tie the vessels; and cut the suspending ligament after you have freed it from all parts of the egg.
Si ergo ouum consolidatum est cum illis carnibus natis, tunc oportet ut attrahas ouum, et incidas ipsum.	 If the egg has hardened with those born flesh, then you must draw out the egg and cut it.
Et si adhaerentia est inter aliquid ex siphaket, aut in eo quod est inter uasa: tunc oportet ut liberes totam illam adhaerentiam, et incidas eam incisione rotunda.	 And if there is an adhesion between something from the swab or in what is between the vessels; then you must free the whole adhesion and cut it with a round incision.
Si autem est natiuitas carnis in loco adhaerentiae quae est retro: tunc oportet ut incidas totum eius, et extrahas ouum, sicut diximus.	 If there is a growth of flesh at the place of the adhesion that is behind; then you must cut the whole of it and extract the egg as we said.
Cum ergo completur operatio tua, tnnc imple uulnus in lana infusa in oleo rosato, et uino: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 When your operation is completed, then fill the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and wine; then take care of it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
¶ De cura Ramicis, quae est cum Vite.	 Chapter on the Care of Branches, which is about Vine.
Caput LXIIII.	 Chapter LXIV.
Uitis est apostema inuolutum quadam inuolutione, simile botro, cum mollificatione testiculorum: et fit difficilis super infirmum motus et exercitium, et deambulatio.	 It is an abscess enveloped by a kind of sheath, similar to a botryoidal tumor with softening of the testicles; and it becomes difficult for weak motion, exercise, and walking.
Et in curatione huius aegritudinis est ex timore, propter illud cuius praecessit rememoratio.	 And in the treatment of this illness there is fear due to the memory of what preceded it.
Verum oportet, ut dicamus operationem in ea secundum quod fecerunt primi.	 It is necessary that we speak of the operation in it according to what the first ones did.
Dico ergo, quod oportet ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	 Therefore I say, it is necessary that you make the sick person sit on an elevated chair.
Deinde impelle suspensorium testiculorum ad inferiora.	 Then push down the suspenders of the testicles to below.
Deinde tene cutem testiculorum cum digitis tuis, cum uasis quae sunt propinqua uirgae: et teneat ea minister alius, et extendat ea extensione uehementi.	 Then hold the skin of the testicles with your fingers, with the bellows that are near the handle: and let another servant hold it, and stretch it with a violent extension.
Deinde incide cum spatumili lato acuto sectione transuersa in directo uasorum, donec detegantur uasa.	 Then make a cut with a broad sharp transverse saw, until the vessels are exposed.
Deinde excoria ab omni parte, sicut diximus tibi in extractione Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	 Then scrape off from all sides, as we told you in the extraction of arteries that are in the temples.
Postea fige in eis acum in qua sit filum duplum, et liga ipsum in primo locorum quibus accidunt Vites: et liga ipsum iterum in ultimo eorum.	 Then insert into them a hook with double thread and tie it at the first knots where they occur (knots called vites): and tie it again at the end of them.
Deinde seca ea in media sectione recta secundum longitudinem corporis, et extrahe quod aggregatur ex humiditatibus faeculentis corruptis.	 Then cut it through a central straight section according to the length of the body and pull out what accumulates from foul, rotten humors.
Deinde cura uulnus cum curatione reliquorum uulnerum, in quibus uis generari saniem, ut cadant uasa quae nutriunt unum testiculorum.	 Then take care of the wound as you would other wounds that generate pus, so that the vessels supplying one testicle are cut off.
Non est enim malum per illud.	 It is not bad through it (in the sense of an operation or treatment).
Si autem accidat Vitis omnibus uasis, tunc oportet ut extrahantur propter hoc testiculi cum uasis: ut non priuetur ouum nutrimento, propter incisionem, et tabescat, uel arescat, et non sit iuuamentum cum eis.	 If all the vessels are affected by knots, then they must be removed for this reason, because the testicles will not receive nourishment due to the incision, and it will rot or burn, and not be useful with them.
¶ De cura Ramicis intestinalis.	 Chapter on the care of the intestines.
Caput LXV.	 Chapter LXV (Roman numerals).
Euentus huius Ramicis est ex sectione, quae accidit in sifach extenso super uentrem in parte inguinum ex mirach uentris.	 The passage of the intestines occurs by a cut that happens when the sigmoid colon is extended over the abdomen in the inguinal part of the stomach.
Quare descendunt intestina ex illa Ruptura ad unum testiculorum.	 Why do the intestines fall out from that rupture towards one testicle.
Et haec Ruptura est aut ex sifach, aut extensione eius.	 And this hernia is either through the scrotum (sifach), or by its extension.
Et accidunt istae duae species ex caussis multis: aut ex percussione, aut saltu, aut clamore, aut eleuatione rei grauis, et similibus.	 These two types of hernia occur through many causes: either by striking, jumping, shouting, lifting heavy objects, and similar things.
Et signum, quando est ex extensione sifach.	 The sign is when it is from the extension of the scrotum (sifach).
Est quod accidit paulatim in tempore longo, et non accidit subito: et est apostema aequale uersus profundum: propterea, quod sifach comprimit intestinum.	 It occurs gradually over a long time, and does not happen suddenly; it is an abscess equal in size to the depth; for this reason, the scrotum compresses the intestine.
Et signum eius quando est ex sectione sifach, quia facit accidere ex principio sui dolorem uehementem subito: et est apostema diuersum, apparens sub cute propinque: et illud est propter exitum intestini, et cursus eius ad exteriora sifach.	 The sign of it (hernia) is when it is from the section of the scrotum, because it causes a sudden severe pain at the beginning; and it is an abscess different, appearing near the skin; and this is due to the exit of the intestine, and its flow to the outer parts of the scrotum.
Et quandoque egreditur cum intestino zirbum: et nominatur haec Ramex intestinalis, et zirbia: et quandoque fit cum uentositate.	 And sometimes it comes out with the intestine (intestines), and this is called an Intestinal Branch, and a worm; and sometimes it happens with diarrhea.
Et quandoque currit in intestinum stercus, et retinetur illic: et est cum eo pernicies infirmi: quoniam facit accidere dolorem prauum, et praecipue quando premitur.	 And sometimes feces run into the intestine and are retained there; and it is with this that the danger of illness occurs; because it causes severe pain, especially when pressed.
Et in curatione specierum aegritudinis huius cum ferro est timor: quare oportet ut caueatur casus in ea.	 And in the treatment of the types of this disease with iron there is fear; therefore, one must be careful about accidents in it.
Et modus operationis est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut reducat intestinum manu sua ad interiora concauitatis suae, si obedit reditui.	 And the method of operation is to command the sick person to put the intestine back into his own concavity with his own hand, if he obeys the return.
Deinde resupinetur super collum suum inter manus tuas: et eleua crura eius.	 Then he lies on his back on top of his neck between your hands; and elevate his legs.
Deinde extende cutem quae sequitur cutem ad superiora, et seca cutem testiculorum totam per longitudinem.	 Then extend the skin following the skin to the upper part, and cut the entire skin of the testicles along its length.
Deinde fige in duobus labiis sectionis uncinos, secundum quod indiges ad aperiendum sectionem cum eis: et sectio sit secundum quantitatem, quod sit possibile, ut egrediatur ex ea ouum.	 Then make two hooks at the lips of the incision, according to what is needed for opening the incision with them; and the incision should be according to its quantity so that it can come out from there an egg (ovum).
Deinde excoria siphak, et quae sunt sub cute testiculorum, donec quando detegitur sifach album, durum ab omni parte: tunc intromitte digitum tuum indicem in eo quod sequitur testiculum, in eo quod est inter siphach album, quod est sub cute oui, et inter sifach secundum, et absolue cum eo adhaerentiam quae est in posteriori parte oui.	 Then scrape the scrotum, and what is beneath the skin of the testicles, until the scrotum becomes white all over: then insert your index finger into the area following the testicle, into that which is between the white part of the scrotum, which is under the skin of the eye, and between the second part of the scrotum, and without any adherence to it from the posterior part of the eye.
Deinde moue cum manu dextra ad interiora cutem testiculorum: et cum hoc extende sifach album ad sursum, cum manu sinistra: et eleua ouum cum sifach ad partem sectionis: et praecipe ministro, ut extendat ouum ad sursum: et tu solue adhaerentiam, quae est retro solutione completa.	 Then with your right hand move towards the inner skin of the testicles: and as you do this, stretch the white part of the scrotum upward, with your left hand: and lift the egg with the scrotum to the cutting part: and command the servant to extend the egg upward: and you separate the adherence that is behind the complete separation.
Et quaere digitis tuis, ut non sit aliquid illic ex intestino inuoluto in sifach albo duro.	 And examine your fingers whether there is nothing there from the rolled-up intestine in the hard white scrotum.
Si autem inuenis ex eo aliquid: tunc impelle ipsum ad uentrem inferius.	 If, however, you find anything from it [the egg]: then push it down to the lower belly.
Deinde accipe acum, in qua sit filum grossum, factum licinium ex decem filis: et intromitte ipsam apud postremum sifach, id est, tunicae, quod est sub cute testiculorum quae sequitur sectionem: deinde incide extremitates quae eminent ex filo, donec sint quatuor fila.	 Then take a sharp instrument with a thick thread made of linen from ten threads, and insert it into the last part of the scrotum, that is, the covering which follows the skin of the testicles: then cut the ends protruding from the thread until there are four threads.
Deinde compone quaedam eorum super quaedam cum figura quae sit in modo crucis: et liga cum eis alsifach, de quo diximus, quia est sub cute testiculorum ligamento uehementi, donec non possit aliquod ex uasis, quae nutriunt eos mittere ad eos aliquid: ut non accidat inde apostema calidum.	 Then make some of them [the four threads] crosswise with a figure in the form of a cross and tie the scrotum that we spoke of, which is the covering of the testicles with a strong ligament, so that no juices that nourish them can pass to it: lest there be a hot abscess.
Et pone iterum ligamentum secundum extra ligamentum primum, longinquum ab eo minus duobus digitis.	 And place another ligament outside the first one at least two fingers' length away from it.
Et post ista duo ligamenta dimitte ex sifach, quod est sub cute testiculorum, quantitatem magnitudinis digiti: et incide reliquum totum secundum rotunditatem, et aufer ex eo ouum.	 And after these two ligaments, release from the scrotum, which is under the skin of the testicles, a quantity equivalent to the size of a finger: and cut the rest all around in a round shape and remove the egg.
Deinde seca in inferiori parte cutis testiculorum sectione, ex qua currit sanguis, et sanies: sicut narrauimus in eo quod praemissum est.	 Then cut off the lower part of the scrotal skin with a section where blood and pus run, as we said in what was mentioned before.
Deinde administra lanam submersam in oleo, et pone in uulnus: et administra ligamentum quod narrauimus.	 Then apply wool soaked in oil and place it on the wound; and apply the bandage as we said.
Et quandoque cauterizatur sifach album quod diximus, post incisionem eius timendo de fluxu sanguinis.	 And sometimes cauterize the white pus of leprosy (sifach) which we mentioned, after making an incision, fearing blood flow.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	 It often happens this way.
Et dimitte ligamentum, donec cadat per se.	 And remove the bandage until it falls off by itself.
Si autem tardatur casus eius, tunc embrocetur cum aqua calida: et pone super ipsum illud quod diximus, donec cadat.	 If the case lingers, then foment with warm water; and place on top of it what we said, until it falls off.
Deinde cura uulnus cum reliqua curatione uulnerum, donec curetur.	 Then care for the wound with the rest of the treatment for wounds, until it heals.
¶ De Ramice uentosa.	 Chapter on Bloated Abdomen.

IN Hac Ramice non uidi aliquem qui ausus fuerit super curationem eius cum ferro.	 In this swollen abdomen, I have not seen anyone who dared to cure it with iron.
Et primi quidem dixerunt, quod fit sicut narrauimus in Ramice quae est cum Vite.	 And indeed, the first ones said that it happens as we described in swollen abdomen which is associated with worms (Vite).\]
Quod est, ut liges uasa post sectionem super ea cum facilitate inferius: deinde seca in medio, et cura postremo cum eo quod aperit ipsum, donec cadant uasa: et cura uulnus, secundum quod diximus, donec sanetur.	 That is to say, to tie the vessels after cutting them below, then cut in the middle; and finally treat it with what opens it until the vessels fall out; and care for the wound as we said, until it heals.
¶ De disruptione quae fit in inguinibus.	 Chapter on Dislocation that happens in the thighs.
Caput LXVII.	 Chapter 67.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, sicut diximus, et eminet locus, et non descendit ad testiculos aliquid ex intestinis: et si descendit, est illud parum, et redit in omnibus horis: uerum si prolongatur cum ea tempus, additur fissura in sifach, donec descendunt intestina in sifach.	 When dislocation occurs in the thighs as we said, and a place appears and something from the intestines does not come out towards the testicles; and if it comes out, it is little and returns to its place every hour; but if it persists for a time, a fissure is added in leprosy (sifach), until the intestines descend into sifach.
Et accidit illud ex extensione sifach, quod est in inguinibus, sicut diximus.	 And this happens due to the extension of leprosy (sifach) in the thighs as we said.
Quod est, quia extenditur sifach: deinde mollificatur, et apostematur locus, et eminet.	 That is, because it is extended, then it is softened, and the place is excised, and it protrudes.
Et cura eius est cum cauterio, sicut praecessit eius narratio.	 And its care is with the cautery, as its previous narrative has said.
Et quandoque curatur cum ferro, secundum hunc modum: et est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum inter manus tuas.	 And at times it is cured with iron, in this manner: and it is that it lies weak on its back between your hands.
Deinde seca locum Rupturae apostematum et eminentem, sectione per latitudinem, secundum quantitatem trium digitorum.	 Then cut the place of Rupture and protrusion, with a cut in width, according to the quantity of three fingers.
Deinde stringe alsifak et, quae sunt sub cute, donec quando detegitur sifach album, quod est sub cute quae sequitur ipsum.	 Then bind the sifak and what is under the skin until when the white sifak appears, which is under the skin following it.
Tunc accipe radium, et pone ipsum super locum eminentem ex sifach, et preme ipsum ad profundum uentris.	 Then take a probe, and put it on the protruding place from the sifak, and press it to the depth of the intestines.
Deinde sue duo loca eminentia super extremitatem radii ex sifach, et annecte cum sutura unum eorum cum altero: deinde extrahe extremitatem radii.	 Then two places protrude at the end of the radius from the sifak, and connect them with a suture one to another: then extract the end of the radius.
Et non incidas alsifach omnino, neque tendas ouum, neque aliud, sicut feci te scire in curatione ramicis intestinalis.	 And do not cut the sifak at all, nor stretch the egg, nor anything else, as I have taught you in the cure of intestinal branches.
Deinde cura illud curatione uulnerum.	 Then take care of that with the treatment of wounds.
Cum ergo incidis fila, mundifica illud, et restaura uulnus, donec consolidetur.	 And when you cut threads, clean it, and restore the wound, until it is consolidated.
Sisach enim contrahitur, et non additur eminentia Rupturae.	 Indeed, sifak contracts and no protrusion of rupture is added.
Et cauterium est melius in hoc loco: quoniam est propinquius ad salutem.	 And the cautery is better in this place: because it is closer to health.
¶ De mollificatione cutis testiculorum.	 Chapter on the softening of the scrotum skin.
Caput LXVIII.	 Chapter LXXVIII.
Multotiens mollificatur cutis testiculorum in quibusdam hominibus, propter quod mollificantur carnes quae sunt inter ea, et foedatur aspectus eius.	 Many times the scrotum skin is softened in certain men, on account of which the meat that is between them is softened, and its appearance becomes foul.
Ergo necesse est ei qui rogatur in curatione eius, ut faciat iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et incidat totam cutem quae mollificata est super cutem naturalem.	 Therefore it is necessary for him who is asked about its cure to make it lie weak on his back, and to cut the entire skin that has been softened over the natural skin.
Deinde aggreget duo labia cum sutura: et si uis, sue in primis superfluitatem cutis mollificatae tribus suturis, aut quatuor, et firma suturam.	 Then gather the two lips together with a stitch; and if you wish, or rather to remove excess skin softened, use three or four stitches, and make a firm one.
Deinde incide inter sututuras.	 Then cut between the stitches.
Deinde cura curatione reliquorum uulnerum, usquequo sanetur, et cadant fila.	 Then take care of the treatment of the remaining wounds until they heal and the threads fall out.
¶ De Castratione.	 Chapter on Castration.
Caput LXIX.	 Chapter LXIX.
Scias, quod Castratio in lege nostra excommunicata est: et propter illud liceret mihi, ut non rememorarer eius in libro meo isto: et non est necessaria rememoratio eius, nisi propter duos modos.	 Know that castration is forbidden by our law; and on account of this, it was permissible for me not to mention it in my book; and it is unnecessary to remember it except for two reasons.
Quorum unus est, ut sit illud in scientia medici quando interrogatur de ea: et ut sciat curationem eius cui accidit.	 One reason is that it should be known by the physician when he is asked about it; and so that he knows its treatment when it happens to someone.
Et modus alter est, quod nos multotiens indigemus castratione quorundam animalium, propter iuuamenta nostra per illud, sicut arietum, hyrcorum, et gattorum, et similium ex animalibus.	 And the second reason is that we often need castration of certain animals for our benefit through it, such as sheep, goats, and cats and similar animals from among the animals.
Dico ergo, quod Castratio fit secundum duos modos.	 I therefore say that castration is done in two ways.
Aut per attritionem.	 Or by attrition (castrating with a rough cloth).\]  Aut
Aut per fissuram, et sectionem.	 Or by making a cut and sectioning (surgical castration).\]  Ubi prius amputatum
In illa autem quae fit per attritionem, uia operationis est: quod nos faciamus sedere animal in aqua calida, donec mollificentur testiculi eius, et leniantur, et pendeant: deinde attere eos manu tua, donec resoluantur et non appareant sub tactu.	 In the case of castration by attrition, the method of operation is that we make the animal sit in warm water until its testicles soften and become relaxed and hang down; then you rub them with your hand until they resolve and are no longer noticeable when touched.
In castratione autem per fissuram et sectionem, oportet ut teneas animal, et premas cutem testiculorum eius cum manu sinistra.	 In the case of surgical castration, it is necessary to hold the animal and press the skin of its testicles with your left hand.
Deinde liga suspensorium, et seca super omne ouum sectione una, donec quando procedunt duo oua: tunc incide ea postquam excoriaueris utrumque, et non dimittas super ea ex sifaket aliquid praeter sifac subtile, quod est super uasa.	 Then bind the suspension, and cut through everything above the egg with one section until when two eggs come out; then cut that part after you scrape off the scrotum of both, and do not leave anything on top of it except the thin sifaket, which is over vessels.
Et iste modus castrationis est melior eo qui fit per attritonem: quoniam attritio fortasse relinquit aliquid ex testiculis, quare desiderat animal coitum.	 This method of castration is better than the one done by grinding: because grinding perhaps leaves something from the testicles, therefore the animal desires copulation.
Deinde cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	 Then, care for the wound until it heals.
¶ De cura Hermafroditae duorum modorum.	 Chapter on the care of Hermaphrodite in two ways.
Caput LXX.	 Chapter LXX.
Hermafrodita ex uiris est secundum duos modos.	 Hermaphrodite is from men according to two modes.
Vnus eorum est, quia apparet in eo quod sequitur spacium, aut in cute testiculorum, in eo quod est inter duos testiculos, figura quasi uulua mulieris, in qua sunt pili: et quandoque currit urina ex eo quod est in cute testiculorum.	 One of them is that it appears in him what follows the space or in the skin of the testicles, between the two testicles, in the form similar to a female vulva, in which there are hairs: and sometimes urine flows out of it from the skin of the testicles.
In mulieribus autem est species una, et est uulua mulieris super pectinem sicut testiculi uiri parui omnino, eminentes ad exteriora: quorum unus est sicut priapus uiri, et duo sicut duo testiculi.	 But in women there is one form and it is a female vulva on top of the comb-like structure like those of small male testicles protruding to the outside; of which one is like a priapus of man, and two like two male testicles.
Et curatio trium specierum, duarum ex uiris, et speciei unius ex mulieribus, est: quia oportet ut incidas carnes additas, donec effugiat impressio earum.	 And the care of three forms, two from men and one from women, is: because it is necessary that you cut the added flesh, until the impression of them disappears.
Deinde cura eas curatione reliquorum uulnerum.	 Then, care for them with the care of other wounds.
In specie autem secunda uirorum, ex qua egreditur urina, quae est in cute testiculorum, non est operatio, neque est eius curatio omnino.	 But in the second form of men, from which urine comes out, which is on the skin of the testicles, there is no operation and no care at all for it.
¶ De incisione Tentiginis, et carnis eminentis in uuluis mulierum.	 Chapter on the incision of warts and protruding flesh in female sores.
Caput LXXI.	 Chapter LXXI.
Tentigo fortasse additur super rem naturalem, donec foedatur et turpis fit aspectus eius: et quandoque magnificatur in quibusdam mulieribus adeo, donec expanditur sicut in uiris, et peruenit usque ad coitum.	 Warts are added over the natural thing, until it becomes ugly and its appearance is disfigured; and sometimes they become enlarged so much in some women that they spread like in men, and they reach copulation.
Oportet ergo ut teneas superfluitatem Tentiginis manu, aut cum uncino, et incidas: et non ultimes in incisione, praecipue in profundo radicis: ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 Therefore, it is necessary that you hold the surplus of warts with your hand or a hook and cut it; and do not go to the end in cutting, especially in deep roots: so that blood flow does not occur.
Deinde cura ipsam curatione uulnerum, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with wound treatment until it heals.
Caro autem orta, est caro quae nascitur in orificio matricis, donec impleat ipsum: et fortasse egreditur ad exteriora secundum similitudinem caudae: et propter illud quidam primi nominant aegritudinem caudatam.	 A boil that arises is the flesh which is born in the opening of the matrix, until it fills itself up; and perhaps it goes out to the outside similar to the tail; and because of this some call the illness 'tailed'.
Oportet ergo ut incidamus eam sicut incidimus Tentiginem, et curemus eam, donec sanetur.	 Therefore, it is necessary that we cut it like we would cut a boil, and treat it until it heals.
¶ De cura Alratica, quae est uulua mulieris non perforata.	 On the treatment of an Alratic ulcer, which is an unperforated woman's ulcer.
Caput LXXII.	 Chapter LXXII.
Alratica est, ut sit uulua mulieris non perforata, aut sit foramen paruum.	 An Alratic ulcer is when it is a woman's unperforated ulcer or there is a small opening.
Et est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	 And it is either natural or accidental.
Accidentalis est ex aegritudine quae praecessit: et ipsa quidem fit aut ex carne nata addita, aut sifach subtili, aut spisso: et fit aut in profundo matricis, aut in lateribus eius, aut in superiore ipsius, aut inferiori eius: et prohibet a coitu et impregnatione, et partu, et fortasse prohibet menstrua.	 An accidental Alratic ulcer is due to an illness that has preceded; and it forms either from flesh born added to it, or from subcutaneous tissue, or from the skin; and it forms either in the depth of the matrix, or in its sides, or above it, or below it; and it prevents coitus, impregnation, parturition, and perhaps menstruation.
Et cognitio illius fit per aspectum obstetricis, si opilatio est apparens propinqua.	 Its recognition is made through the examination of an obstetrician if the opening appears near.
Si autem non est apparens, tunc quaere eam digitis tuis, aut cum radio.	 If it is not visible, then search for it with your fingers or with a probe.
Si autem opilatio est ex sifach subtili, et est propinqua duobus labiis: tunc propera, et disrumpe ipsam.	 If the opening is from subcutaneous tissue and is near two lips, then apply pressure and break it open.
Et est, ut ponas super duo labia puluillos.	 It is, so that you place poultices on top of two lips.
Deinde pone indices tuos duarum manuum simul, et mulier sit super dorsum suum expansis cruribus suis.	 Then place your fingers of both hands together and the woman should be over her back with her legs spread out.
Deinde extende duo labia cum fortitudine, donec disrumpatur sifach subtile, et aperiatur opilatio.	 Then separate the two lips with force until the subcutaneous tissue is broken and the opening is opened.
Deinde accipe lanam, et imbibe eam in oleo, et pone ipsam super locum: et coeat mulier omni die, ut non consolidetur locus uice alia.	 Then take wool, wet it in oil and place it on the location; and let the woman sit there every day so that the location does not harden due to another illness.
Si autem sifach est grossum, spissum: tunc oportet ut seces ipsum cum spatumili lato simili folio myrti.	 If however the boil is large and thick: then it is necessary that you cut it with a broad lancet, similar to a myrtle leaf.
Si autem opilatio est ex carne nata, tunc suspende eam cum uncinis, et incide eam: et sint tecum medicinae quae fluxum sedant sanguinis absque mordicatione, sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus aggregatum cum albugine oui.	 If the boil is born from flesh, then suspend it with hooks and cut it; have medicines that stop the flow of blood without causing pain, such as acacia, dragon's blood, and frankincense mixed with egg white.
Deinde administra cannulam ex plumbo amplam, ut non consolidetur uulnus uelociter, teneat eam diebus aliquot: et administra licinium ex lino sicco, deinde curetur reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then administer a wide cannula made of lead to prevent the wound from closing quickly; hold it for several days; then apply linen cloth, followed by the usual treatment until it heals.
Et quandoque nasciur in matrice natiuitas carnium aliarum: oportet ergo ut incidantur secundum hunc modum: dum non est apostema cancerosum apostemati enim canceroso quod est in matrice, non fiat contrarietas cum ferro omnino.	 And sometimes a birth of flesh from the matrix occurs for others: it is therefore necessary to cut it according to this method: until there is no abscess; because an abscess that is cancerous should not be opposed to iron in any way.
¶ De cura hemorroidarum, Athehelil, et Bothor rubeae in uuluis mulierum.	 Chapter on the treatment of hemorrhoids, Athehelil and Bothor for women with red wounds.
Caput LXXIII.	 Chapter LXXIII.
Hemorroides quidem sunt apertio orificiorum uenarum, donec currit ex eis sanguis multus assidue.	 Hemorrhoids indeed are the opening of vein orifices until blood continuously runs out in large amounts.
Cum ergo antiquantur hemorroides, fiunt thelil: et iam dixi in diuisione species earum, et signa ipsarum: et dicam hic quae ex eis recipiunt curationem, et quae non.	 When hemorrhoids have become chronic, they turn into thrombus; and I have already said about their kinds, and the signs of them; and here I will say what receives treatment from them and what does not.
Dico ergo, quod hemorroides quae sunt in orificio matricis, et non apparent sensui: tunc non est ei curatio cum ferro.	 Therefore, I say that hemorrhoids that are in the opening of the matrix and do not appear to the senses: then there is no treatment with iron.
Quae autem ex eis sunt in orificio matricis super quas cadit sensus, sunt quae curantur.	 But those from them that are in the opening of the matrix over which sensation falls can be treated.
Oportet ergo ut intromittas mulierem in domum frigidam.	 It is therefore necessary to introduce a woman into a cold house.
Deinde extende athehelil cum forficibus, aut cum panno aspero, et incide eas ex radicibus suis.	 Then stretch out Athehelil with hooks or with rough cloth and cut them from their roots.
Deinde pulueriza super eas apud fluxum sanguinis ex uno puluerum incisiuorum absque mordificatione: sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus, et similia eis.	 Then pulverize it over them at the flow of blood from one incision without biting: as acacia, and dragon's blood, and asafoetida, and similar ones.
Deinde impellat pedes eius ad parietem hora una.	 Then push his feet against the wall at one hour.
Postea depone eam in aquam frigidam.	 Then put her in cold water.
Quod si perseuerat fluxus sanguinis: tunc fac eam sedere in decoctione sumach, et corticum granatorum, et gallarum, et similium.	 If the flow of blood persists: then make her sit in a decoction of sumac, and of pomegranate bark, and of tannins, and similar ones.
Deinde accipe farinam hordei, et confice eam cum melle et aceto, et fac emplastrum cum eo super dorsum eius.	 Then take barley flour, and knead it with honey and vinegar, and make a plaster with it on his back.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis cum eo, bonum est: et si non, fac adhaerere dorso uentosas, et mammillis, absque scarificatione.	 If the blood is cut off along with it, that is good: and if not, make adhesive bladders or breasts, without scarification.
Deinde accipe lanam, et submerge in succo tarathit, aut succo arnoglossae, aut succo ramorum alaulat, id est, aglanter, uino pontico, et fac adhaerere loeo.	 Then take wool, and dip it in the juice of thistle, or the juice of argol, or the juice of alaoult leaves, that is, aglant root, wine from Pontus, and make it stick to the wound.
Cum ergo quiescit apostema, tunc cura locum cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	 When the abscess is quiet, then take care of the place with ointments until it heals.
Albarth uero rubeum est simile capitibus alhaasse, et est asperi aspectus.	 Albarth however is red and resembles the heads of alhassa, and has a rough appearance.
Oportet ergo ut incidas quod apparet ex eo, secundum quod dixi in thelil aequaliter: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Therefore it is necessary to cut what appears from it, as I said in thelil equally: and care for it until it heals.
¶ De perforatione Exiturae quae accidit in matrice.	 Section on the Perforation that occurs in the womb (uterus).
Caput LXXIIII.	 Chapter LXXIIII.
Accidunt in matrice species multae apostematum, sicut cancer, et apostema lapideum, et ulcera, et adubelati, et alekilati, id est, herpes, aestiomemus, et fistulae, et hemorroides, et ragadiae, et thelil, et apostema calidum.	 Various appearances of abscesses occur in the matrix, such as cancer, stone abscess, ulcers, adubelati, alekilati (herpes), fistulae, hemorrhoids, ragadiae, thelil, and warm abscess.
Et ego quidem iam dixi omnes has aegritudines et species earum, et signa ipsarum, et earum curationes in diuisione: necesse est ut dicam in hoc tractatu apostema calidum quod accidit in matrice, quando est ex apostematibus quae colligunt saniem, et uis scire qualiter fit eius apertio cum ferro.	 And indeed I have already said all these diseases and their species, and the signs of them, and their cures are divided: it is necessary that in this treatise I say about the warm abscess that occurs in the matrix, when it is from the abscesses that gather pus, and to know how its opening with iron.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	 Therefore, one should consider.
Tunc si dolor apostematis in incaeptione sua est acutus cum percussione sua, et flamma, et febre: et uides ipsum rubere: si cadit super ipsum sensus, tunc non properes cum perforatione eius: et cura ipsum cum eo eo quod iuuat super maturationem, donec quando quiescat acuitas accidentium.	 Then if the pain of the abscess in its beginning is sharp with striking and flame, and fever, and you see it redden, if it falls upon the sense, then do not press with piercing, and cure it with that which helps for maturation until when the acuteness of the incidents ceases.
Tunc oportet ut facias sedere mulierem super sedem quae labeat duo sedilia, et reclinetur, uel appodietur super dorsum suum, et aggreget pedes suos ad partem inferiorem uentris: et sint coxae eius expansae, et ponat brachia sua sub genibus suis, et liget utraque ligamento conueniente ad illud.	 Then one should make the woman sit on a seat that has two arms, and recline or lie upon her back, and bring her feet to the lower part of her belly: and let her thighs be open, and put her arms under her knees, and bind each with a bandage fittingly to that.
Deinde sedeat obstetrix a latere dextro, et administra instrumentum quo aperitur orificium matricis.	 Then let the midwife sit on the right side, and administer the instrument for opening the matrix's orifice.
Cuius forma uenit in eis quae sunt post.	 Its form comes to those who are after.
Et oportet quando uis administrare hoc instrumentum, ut figas cum Radio profundum matricis mulieris: ut non sit illud quod ingreditur ex instrumento plus, quam profundum matricis, et laedat infirmam.	 And it is necessary when you wish to administer this instrument, that you strike with a long rod the matrix of the woman, so that what enters from the instrument is not greater than the depth of the matrix, and does not harm the weak.
Si autem fuerit instrumentum magis quam profundum, tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos super tecturam profundi matricis: ut prohibeatur introitus instrumenti totius in profundum matricis: et oportet ut ponat uertiginem, quae currit in instrumento, ex latere superiore: et ut teneat instrumentum, et ut reuoluat minister uertiginem, donec aperiatur profundum matricis.	 If the instrument is too deep, then one should place feathers on the cover of the matrix depth: to prevent the entry of the entire instrument into the depth of the matrix: and one should hold the instrument and turn the worker's reel, until the depth of the matrix opens up.
Cum ergo apparet Exitura, et tangitur manu, et est lenis et mollis: tunc oportet ut seces ipsam apud caput suum cum spatumili lato.	 When it appears to be excised and touched with the hand, and it is soft and tender, then it is necessary to cut it off at its head with a broad lancet.
Cum ergo euacuatur sanies, tunc oportet ut ponas in uulnus licinium submersum in oleo rosaceo: aut oleo uiridi, in quo sit quaedam stipticitas: et pone licinium, et extrahe sectionem in profundo matricis.	 When pus is discharged from it, then put linen soaked in rose oil or green oil containing some styptic substance into the wound; place the linen and extract the incision deep within the matrix.
Et pone exterius super matricem, et super pectinem lanam mundam submersam in aqua, in qua bullitae sunt maluae.	 Put it (the wound) externally on the matrix and on the comb a clean fleece soaked in water where molasses have been boiled.
Deinde curetur post duos dies cum unguento quod conuenit ad illud, donec sanetur.	 Then it should be treated with an ointment suitable for that after two days until it heals.
Et quandoque abluitur matrix et uulnus, ita quod clisterizatur cum aqua et melle: deinde cum aqua in qua bullita est radix lilii, aut aristolochia longa: deinde redeat ad unguentum.	 And sometimes the matrix and the wound are washed so that it is cleansed with water and honey; then with water in which the root of the lily or long aristolochia has been boiled, and then return to the ointment.
Quod si uulnus absconditum fuerit interius in matrice, tunc oportet ut prohibearis ex curatione eius cum ferro, imo cura ipsum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione.	 If the wound is hidden internally within the matrix, then it is necessary to prevent any treatment with iron for that one; rather treat it with what I said in the section on incisions.
¶ Doctrinae Obstetricum, qualiter medicentur embriones uiui, secundum figuram non naturalem egressi.	 Section on obstetrics: how to treat living embryos that have exited in an unnatural way (according to their figure).
Caput Lxxu.	 Chapter LXXX.
Necesse est Obstetrici, ut cognoscat in primis figuram partus naturalis.	 It is necessary for the obstetrician to first know the shape of a natural birth.
Ex signis ergo eius est, quod quando uides mulierem comprimi ad inferiora, et desiderat odorare aerem, et alleuiatur super eam quod super ipsam est de partu, et festinat exitus embrionis: tunc scias quod iste partus est secundum figuram naturalem, et est exitus eius super caput suum, et secundina cum eo: aut suspensa, uel pendens ex umbilico.	 Therefore, among the signs of it (the unnatural birth) is that when you see a woman pressing towards the lower parts and yearning to smell the air, and a strong urge comes over her for the exit of the embryo; then know that this birth is in accordance with its natural shape, and it is an exit above its head and secondary (membrane) with it: or suspended, or hanging from the navel.
Cum ergo uides haec signa, tunc oportet ut comprimatur uenter eius, ut descendat embrio uelociter.	 When you see these signs, then it is necessary to press the woman's abdomen so that the embryo descends quickly.
Nam quando descendit super caput suum, descendit secundina cum eo, et mundatur ex illis superfluitatibus mundificatione bona.	 When it descends upon his head, the second one descends with it, and it is to be cleaned from those excesses with good cleansing.
Qui autem est praeter hunc partum, est innaturalis, illaudabilis.	 But that which follows this birth is unnatural, not to be praised.
Quoniam quandoque egreditur foetus super pedes suos, et egreditur corpus eius ante caput ipsius, et pedes eius, et manus eius una, aut pes eius unus: aut egreditur caput eius et manus eius: aut egreditur uentrinus: et fortasse conuertitur super collum suum, et similia ex figuris illaudabilibus.	 For at times the fetus comes forth upon its feet and its body comes out before its head; and the feet of it, and the hands of it come out one or only one foot: or the head of it and the hands of it: or the belly comes out: and perhaps it turns over on its neck, and similar unnatural shapes.
Necesse est ergo Obstetrici, ut sit prudens, subtilis in istis rebus omnibus, et caueat sibi ab errore et decaeptione: et ego sum ostendens omnem figuram ex eis, et qualiter est ingenium in ea, et significetur per illud, et stetur super ipsum.	 Therefore it is necessary that the midwife be prudent, skillful in these matters, and take care to avoid error and deception; and I show every figure of them, and what is the meaning of it, and it will be made clear through that, and it shall stand upon him.
Quando egreditur foetus super caput suum egressione sua naturali, et uehemens fit illud super mulierem, et difficilis fit ei partus, et uides uirtutem eius iam debilitatam: tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, aut mulieres teneant eam: et uapora uuluam eius cum foenugraeco decocto, et cum oleis humidis.	 When the fetus comes forth upon its head with its natural exit, and it becomes vigorous on the woman, and childbirth is difficult for her, and you see its strength already weakened; then make her sit on a chair, or women hold her: and warm her vagina with a decoction of fennel and with moist oils.
Deinde intromittat Obstetrix inter digitos suos Spatumile paruum, et findat cum eo secundinam, et secet eam ungue suo, donec currat quod est in ea ex humiditate: et preme uentrem mulieris, donec descendat foetus.	 Then the midwife introduces a small spatula between her fingers, and scrapes it with it, and cuts the second one with her nail, until what is in it runs out from its wetness; and press the woman's womb, until the fetus descends.
Si autem non descendit, tunc oportet ut clisterizetur mulier ex mucillagine foenugraeci, cum oleo sisamino.	 But if it does not descend, then it is necessary to cleanse the woman with a decoction of fennel mucilage, with sesame oil.
Deinde praecipe ei post clistere, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi, et tene os eius et nasum ipsius hora una.	 Then command her after the cleansing to be pressed: and make her sneeze with pepper, and hold her mouth and nose for an hour.
Foetus enim egredietur statim.	 The fetus shall come out immediately.
Quod si egrediantur duae manus foetus in primis, iunc oportet ut reducas eas cum facilitate paulatim.	 If two hands emerge from the fetus first, it is necessary that you draw them back gently.
Si autem non obedit in introitu, tunc pone mulierem super sedem, et eleua pedes eius sursum: deinde concute sedem super terram: et mulier teneatur, ut non cadat apud concussionem.	 If it does not obey during the delivery, then place the woman on a chair, and lift her feet upward; then strike the chair on the ground; and hold the woman so that she does not fall during the striking.
Si ergo non egrediuntur manus, et moritur foetus: tunc incide eas, et extrahe residuum foetus: et liga manum eius cum panno, et extrahe ipsum cum aequalitate: nam ipse egredietur.	 If the hands do not come out and the fetus dies; then cut them and remove the remaining fetus; and tie her hand with a cloth, and remove it with equal effort; for it will also come out.
¶ Exitus embrionis super pedes suo.	 The emergence of an embryo is above its feet.
Quando egreditur foetus super pedes suos, tunc oportet ut impellat eos sursum: deinde conuertat foetum paulatim: postea aequet ipsum.	 When the fetus comes out above its feet, then push them upward; then gradually turn it over; finally straighten it.
Deinde accipiat unum pedum eius, et extendat eum paulatim.	 Then take one of his feet and stretch it gently.
Cum ergo egrediuntur usque ad coxas, tunc praecipe ei, ut comprimatur, et fac eam sternutare cum condisi: egredietur enim, si Deus uoluerit.	 When they come out as far as the hips, then command him to press and make her sneeze with powder; it will come out if God wills it.
Et si non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc reduc foetum paulatim, donec ponas eum secundum figuram naturalem.	 And if it does not come out as we have said, then gradually pull the fetus back until you place it in its natural position.
Nam ipse egredietur tunc egressu facili.	 It will then come out easily with an easy delivery.
Quod si prohibeatur cum eo toto quod narrauimus: tunc accipe ex mucillagine alteae, et oleo sisamino, et gummi soluto: et percute totum in mortario percussione bona: deinde line cum eo uuluam mulieris, et inferius uentris eius.	 If you are forbidden to do everything as we have said; then take althea mucilage, sesame oil, and dissolved gum; grind it well in a pestle; then smear the woman's vulva with it and below her belly.
Deinde fac eam sedere in aqua tepida, donec consequatur hypocundria.	 Then make her sit in warm water until she feels relief in her womb.
Cum ergo uides quod iam calefacta sunt inferiora eius, tunc fac ei sief de myrrha: et suppone ipsum.	 When you see that the lower parts are already warmed up, then give her something to sniff from myrrh and place it beneath her nose.
Quando ergo tenet sief hora una, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	 When an hour has passed, then make her sit on a chair.
Deinde fac eam sternutare: et stringe ipsius os et nasum: et preme inferiorem partem uentris compressione facili.	 Then make it sneeze: and tighten its own bone and nose: and press the lower part of the abdomen with easy compression.
Nam foeus egredietur statim.	 The feces will exit immediately.
¶ Exitus foetus super genua et manus.	 The birth takes place above the knees and hands.
Quando egreditur secundum hanc formam, tunc ingeniet in intromittendo manus suas paulatim.	 When it exits in this manner, then he should introduce his hands gradually.
Deinde resupinetur mulier super collum suum, et pendeant pedes eius ad inferiora: et ipsa sit iacens super lectum, et complicet manus suas.	 Then the woman lies on her back on her neck and let her feet hang downwards; and she should lie on the bed and fold her hands.
Deinde preme supra uentrem eius paulatim.	 Then press above her abdomen gradually.
Deinde extrahe quod est sub pedibus eius ex puluinaribus, donec sit praeparata in inferiori parte.	 Then extract what is below her feet from the anus until it is ready at the lower part.
Quod si non egreditur foetus, tunc accipe pedes eius, et moue eos motu uehementi.	 If the fetus does not exit, then seize his feet and move them with strong movement.
Deinde preme quod est supra hypocundria paulatim, donec ascendat foetus ad superiora.	 Then press what is above the pubis gradually until the fetus rises to the upper part.
Deinde intromittat manus suas, et aequet foetum paulatim: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimatur, donec egrediatur foetus.	 Then introduce his hands and equalize the fetus gradually; and command the woman to press herself until the fetus exits.
¶ Exitus foetus latitudinaliter pendens ex manibus.	 The birth takes place laterally hanging from the hands.
Ingenietur in reductione manus eius.	 He should introduce his hand for reduction (reducing a prolapsed organ).
Si autem non potest reducere eam, tunc eleua mulierem, et fac eam ambulare.	 If it cannot be reduced, then lift the woman and make her walk.
Si uero ambulare non potest, tunc fac eam iacere super lectum: et concute crura eius concussione uehementi.	 If she cannot walk, then let her lie on the bed and strike her legs with strong impact.
Deinde administra linimentum quod praeparasti ex mucillaginibus.	 Then apply the liniment you have prepared from mucilage (a gummy substance made from various plants).
Quod si accipit eam partus, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	 If it receives her in childbirth, then let her sit on a chair.
Deinde stude in reductione manus, et aequa foetum secundum figuram naturalem: et fac sternutare mulierem, et praecipe ei, ut comprimat se, donec egrediatur.	 Then strive to reduce the hand, and equalize the fetus according to its natural form; and make the woman sneeze and command her to press herself until it exits.
¶ Exitus foetus super collum suum, expansis manibus, et est facies eius ad dorsum matris suae.	 The birth takes place on the back of the neck with spread hands and the face of the fetus is towards the back of the mother.
Oportet ut teneat Obstetrix manum foetus, deinde reuoluat eum paulatim, et aequet eum cum facilitate.	 The obstetrician must hold the fetus and then gradually turn it, and equalize it with ease.
Cum ergo aequatur, tunc pone super uuluam eius quod narrauimus ex oleo et mucillaginibus.	 When it is evened out, place it on the opening we have mentioned, with oil and mucilage.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut moueatur paulatim.	 Then command him to move it slowly.
Cum ergo feceris illud, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, et praecipe ei ut inclinetur ad latus dextrum.	 When you have done that, then make her sit on a chair, and command her to lean towards the right side.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi.	 Then command him to press: and make her sneeze with powder.
¶ Exitus foetus praeparati super latus.	 The preparation of the fetus is on the side.
Quando descendit ad orificium matricis secundum hunc modum cum secundina, tunc scinde secundinam cum ungue tuo, donec euacuetur ex humiditate.	 When it descends to the opening of the matrix in this manner with the second one, then divide the second one with your nail until it is evacuated due to moisture.
Si ergo suspenditur super faciem foetus, et collum eius, tunc incide eam ex umbilico: ut non retineatur, et moriatur.	 If the fetus is suspended over the face and its neck, then cut it from the navel so that it is not retained and dies.
Deinde impelle foetum ad interiora, donec ponas eam secundum quod oportet: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimat se aliquotiens: ipse enim egredietur exitu leui.	 Then push the fetus towards the inside until you place it as necessary: and command the woman to press herself several times; for it will come out with an easy exit.
¶ Exitus Geminorum, aut foetuum multorum.	 The birth of twins or many children.
Scias, quod Gemini multotiens nascuntur: et quandoque nascuntur tres, et quatuor.	 Know that twins are born frequently: and sometimes three, and even four.
Verumtamen illud extraneum est, et raro contingit.	 However, this is unusual and rarely occurs.
Quinque uero est res extra naturam, et non uiuunt penitus: et continet eos, quamuis multiplicentur, secundina una: et separantur per sifach, distinguens inter eos ligatum in umbilico cuiusque eorum.	 Five are indeed outside nature and do not live long: and they contain one second only, which separates them through a siphac, distinguishing between them bound at the navel of each of them.
Et quandoque egrediuntur sicut egreditur foetus unus exitu naturali, facili: et egrediuntur exitu illaudabili, sicut narrauimus.	 And sometimes they come out just as a single fetus comes out with a natural and easy exit: and they come out with an unaccountable exit, as we have mentioned.
Quod si difficiles fuerint quidam eorum apud partum, et perueniunt ad illud quod diximus ex figuris innaturalibus, tunc cura eos sicut narrauimus: et sit ob stetrix subtilis, et faciat quod facit cum facilitate et tarditate, et ingenietur secundum omnem figuram cum eo quod praeparatur ei ex ingenio ducente ad salutem.	 If some of them are difficult at birth and reach what I have said in unnatural positions, then care for them as we have mentioned: let the midwife be skillful, and do what she does with ease and slowness, and proceed according to every position with him who is prepared for it by his intelligence leading towards health.
¶ Rememoratio eius quod formatur in matrice ex embrionibus, et abortiuntur.	 Remembrance of that which is formed in the womb from embryos, and they miscarry.
Quandoque formatur in matrice unus, et duo, et tres, et quatuor, et quinque, et sex, et septem, et plures decem: et iam uerificatum est apud me, quod mulier abortiendo emisit septem, et alia quindecim, omnes formatos.	 Sometimes one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and more than ten are formed in the womb: and it is confirmed by me that a woman, while miscarrying, has emitted seven, and another fifteen, all formed.
Quod factum est mensuratione gloriosi sapientis.	 What was done by measurement of the glorious wise man.
Hoc ergo totum oportet ut sit in scientia Obstetricis.	 Therefore this whole matter should be in the knowledge of Obstetrics.
Fortasse enim perueniet ad eam simile illius: opponat ergo ei cum illo quod oportet	 Perhaps it will reach a similar case; therefore let him compare with it what is necessary.
¶ De extractione foetus mortui.	 On the extraction of the dead fetus.
Caput LXXVI.	 Chapter LXXVI.
Quando curas foetum mortuum cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex medicatione, et non egreditur, et cogeris uti operatione cum manu, tunc oportet ut consideres.	 When you take care of a dead fetus, along with what I said in the division and it does not come out, and you will be compelled to use an operation by hand, then you should consider the following.
Si ergo mulier est sanae uirtutis, et non est cum aliquo ex accidentibus, ex quibus timetur super eam perditio: tunc oportet ut resupinetur mulier super lectum, super dorsum suum, et sit caput eius inclinatum inferius, et crura eius eleuata: et ministra teneat eam a duabus partibus, aut ligetur ad lectum, ut non extrahatur corpus eius apud extractionem foetus.	 If the woman is healthy and there are no accidents that cause fear of loss for her: then she should lie down on the bed on her back, with her head inclined downwards, and her legs elevated; and a nurse should hold her from both sides or tie her to the bed so that her body does not be pulled out during the extraction of the fetus.
Deinde humecta os matricis ex oleis humidis cum mucillagine alteae, et foenugraeci, et seminis lini.	 Then moisten the mouth of the womb with moist oils such as olive oil, mucilage from althea, fenugreek, and flaxseed.
Deinde inungat Obstetrix manum suam cum istis oleis et mucillaginibus: deinde intromittat eam in matricem cum facilitate.	 Then the obstetrician wets his hand with these oils and mucilages; then he introduces it into the womb with ease.
Deinde quaerat cum ea locum in quo figat uncinos ex foetu, et loca conuenientia ad illud.	 Then he seeks out a place to insert hooks from the fetus, and places that correspond to it.
Considera ergo tunc, si foetus est praeparatus ut descendat super caput suum: tunc fige uncinos in oculos eius, aut in collo eius, aut in ore eius, aut in palato ipsius, aut sub barba eius, aut in furcula ipsius, aut in locis propinquis costis, et sub hypocundriis.	 Therefore consider whether the fetus is prepared to descend upon its head: then insert hooks into its eyes, neck, mouth, palate itself, beneath its beard, in its armpits, or near its ribs, and under its navel.
Si autem descensus est super pedes eius, tunc in pectine, et costis eius mediis.	 If it is a descent below his feet, then on the breastbone and his middle ribs.
Et oportet, ut teneat uncinum cum manu dextra: et ponat curuitatem eius in eo quod est inter digitos sinistrae manus: et intromittat cum manu cum facilitate, et figat uncinum in aliquo illorum locorum quae diximus, donec perueniat ad rem uacuam.	 And it is necessary that he holds the hook with his right hand: and places the sore in that which is between the fingers of the left hand: and introduces with his hand easily, and pierces the hook in one of those places which we said, until it reaches the hollow place.
Deinde figat in oppositione eius uncinum alium, aut tertium, si indiges: ut sit contractio aequalis, et non declinet ad partem.	 Then pierce another or third hook, if necessary: so that the contraction is equal, and it does not lean to one side.
Deinde extendatur extensione aequali, et non sit extensio secundum rectitudinem tantum, imo moueatur ad omnem partem, ut alleuietur exitus eius: sicut fit cum dente apud eradicationem eius.	 Then it is extended with an equal extension, and it should not be an extension only along the straight, but rather move to all parts, so that the opening is relieved: as it is done with a tooth in its extraction.
Et oportet in eo quod est inter illud, ut mollificetur extensio.	 And it is necessary in what is between them, that the extension is softened.
Quod si retineatur ex eo pars, tunc oportet ut inungat Obstetrix quosdam digitos cum oleo, et intromittat eos ex parte, ut reuoluat cum eis quod retinetur.	 If a part remains in it, then it is necessary that the midwife binds certain fingers with oil, and introduces them from that side, to turn with them what remains.
Si ergo egreditur pars foetus, tunc permutentur uncini ad locum alium qui sit altior: fac hoc donec egrediatur foetus totus.	 If then a part of the fetus comes out, then the hooks are changed to another higher place: do this until the whole fetus comes out.
Si ergo egreditur manus ante alia, et non est possibile reducere eam, propter coartationem eius: tunc oportet, ut inuoluatur super eam pannus.	 If then a hand comes out before the others, and it is not possible to return it because of its contracture: then a cloth should be wrapped around it.
Deinde extrahe eam donec quando egreditur tota, incide eam aut in iunctura plantae, aut in cubito: et ita oportet ut facias in manu altera, et in duobus pedibus.	 Then extract it until when the whole comes out, cut it at the ankle or elbow: and thus you should do in the other hand, and in both feet.
Si autem caput foetus est magnum, aut accidit ei coartatio in exitu, aut est in capite eius aqua aggregata: tunc oportet ut intromittat inter digitos Spatumile spinosum, et findat cum eo caput, et extrahat aquam: aut disrumpat ipsum cum instrumento quod nominatur Almisdac: cuius forma uenit cum formis reliquorum instrumentorum in capitulo quod est post hoc.	 If the fetal head is large or there is a contracture at exit, or water has accumulated in its head: then a sharp pointed spatula should be introduced between the fingers and pierce the head, and extract the water; or it should be broken with the instrument called Almisdac, whose shape comes with the shapes of the remaining instruments in the chapter that follows this.
Similiter faciat si foetus est magni capitis natura, tunc oportet ut seces algengematu: aut extrahas ipsum cum misdach, sicut diximus.	 Similarly, do as follows if the fetus is large-headed by nature, then it is necessary to cut off the membranes around the head; or else pull it out with forceps, as we have said.
Deinde attrahas ossa cum forcipibus.	 Then draw out the bones with forceps.
Quod si egrediatur caput, et coartetur apud furculam: tunc findatur, donec effundatur humiditas quae est in pectore.	 If the head emerges and becomes stuck at the neck, then it is broken open to release the moisture that is in the chest.
Si autem non complicatur, neque obedit ad exitum: tunc incide caput frustatim, secundum quod possibile est tibi.	 If it does not twist or yield to exit, then the head is cut open piece by piece, as far as possible for you.
Quod si inferius uentris est apostematum, aut est in eo hydropisis: tunc oportet ut perfores ipsum, donec currat humiditas ex eo.	 If there is an abscess or hydrops below the abdomen, then it is necessary to pierce it until the moisture runs out of it.
Si uero foetus est super pedes suos, tunc attractio eius est facilis, et directio eius ad os matricis est leuis.	 If the fetus is above its feet, then its extraction is easy and its direction towards the birth canal is light.
Si autem coartatur apud uentrem, aut pectus: tunc oportet ut extrahas ipsum cum panno quem inuoluisti super manum tuam: et findat uentrem, aut pectus, donec currat quod est in eis.	 If it is stuck at the abdomen or chest, then it is necessary to pull it out with the cloth that you have wrapped over your hand; and break open the abdomen or chest until what is inside runs out of them.
Si autem auferuntur reliqua membra, et redit caput: tunc intromittat Obstetrix manum sinistram.	 If the other limbs are removed and the head returns, then the midwife should insert her left hand.
Si ergo os matricis est apertum, tunc intromittat manum in profundum matricis, et quaerat cum ea caput, et attrahat ipsum cum digitis usque ad os matricis: deinde intromittat in eo uncinum unum, aut uncinos duos, et attrahat ipsum cum eo.	 If the birth canal is open, then the hand should be inserted deep into the birth canal and searched for the head, and pulled it with the fingers as far as the birth canal; then a hook can be inserted into it, or two hooks, and pulled out along with them.
Quod si os matricis coartatur, propter apostema calidum quod accidit ei: tunc non oportet ut laboretur super ipsum, imo oportet tunc administrare effusionem rerum humidarum, pinguium: et administra emplastra: et sedeat in aquis quae mollificant et humectant.	 If the birth canal is stuck due to a hot abscess that has occurred there, then it is not necessary to exert force on it; instead, administer bloodletting of moist substances and ointment, and apply plasters; and sit in warm water that softens and moistens.
Quod si foetus est super latus suum, tunc possibile est ut aequetur: tunc administretur quod diximus in foetu uiuo.	 If the fetus is on its side, then it may be possible to turn it; then what was said about a living fetus should be administered.
Quod si non est possibile illud, tunc incidatur frustatim, et extrahatur.	 If it is not possible to do that, then make a shallow cut and extract it.
Et oportet ut non dimittas aliquid ex secundina intus omnino.	 And you must absolutely not leave anything from the second layer inside at all.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc administra quod diximus in apostematibus calidis quae accidunt in matricibus.	 When you have completed your procedure, then give what we said about warm cauterizations that occur in the wombs.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc descendat in aquis stipticis, et administra reliquam curationem.	 If bleeding occurs, let it go into cold water and give the rest of the treatment.
Et ego quidem iam uidi mulierem, in cuius uentre mortuus erat foetus: deinde impregnata est super ipsum uice alia, postea mortuus est foetus alius etiam.	 I myself have already seen a woman whose womb contained a dead fetus; then she became pregnant again on top of that, and another dead fetus was also born.
Accidit ergo ei post tempus longum apostema in umbilico suo, et inflatum est, donec apertum est: et coepit emittere pus.	 So after a long time, she had an abscess at her navel that became swollen until it opened and began to emit pus.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius, et medicatus sum ei tempore longo: et non consolidatum est uulnus.	 I was therefore summoned for her treatment, and I treated her over a long period of time; but the wound did not heal.
Posui ergo super ipsum ex quibusdam emplastris fortis attractionis: et exiuit ex loco os.	 So I placed some strong adhesive plasters on it, and the bone came out from that place.
Deinde praeterierunt ei dies aliquot, et exiuit os aliud.	 Then several days passed, and another bone came out.
Miratus sum ergo inde, cum in uentre non sit os.	 I was amazed then, since there was no bone in the womb.
Cogitaui ergo, quia erant ex ossibus foetus mortui.	 So I thought, because the dead fetuses were from bones.
Inquisiui ergo uulnus, et extraxi ossa multa, muliere existente in melioribus dispositionibus suis: et iam uixit taliter tempore longo, et mittit ex loco pus parum.	 I therefore asked about the wound, and extracted many bones from it, while the woman was in good condition; and she lived thus for a long time, but emitted little pus from that place.
Et ego non firmaui hic hoc extraneum, nisi quoniam in eo est scientia, et adiutorium ad illud, quod administrat medicus artifex cum manu ex curatione.	 I did not fix this foreign object here unless there was knowledge about it and help for that, which the medical craftsman administers with his hand in treatment.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum necessariorum in extractione foetus.	 Chapter on the shapes of necessary instruments for the extraction of a fetus.
Caput LXXVII.	 Chapter LXXVII.
Hic inferius est forma Strictorii, quo aequantur libri, cui aequaliter sunt duae uertigines in duabus extremitatibus duorum lignorum.	 Here below is the form of the Stricture Instrument, where books are evened, which have equally two spindles at the ends of two woods.
Verumtamen haec Vertigo oportet ut sit subtilior strictorio: et ut fiat, aut ex ebano, aut ex ligno bussi.	 Nevertheless, this Spindle should be more delicate than the Stricture Instrument: and to make it so, either from Ebony, or from Wood of Box.
Et sit latitudo omnis ligni quasi duo digiti: et margo cuiusque amborum est quasi digitus unus, et longitudo cuiusque eorum est palmus et medietas: et in medio duorum lignorum sunt duo additamenta ex genere eiusdem ligni, quae iam firmata sunt in utrisque, quorum longitudo est medietas palmi et plus parum: et latitudo utriusque est quasi duo digiti, aut plus parum.	 And let the width of all the wood be as two fingers: and the edge of each of both is like one finger, and the length of each of them is a palm and half, or more: and in the middle of two woods there are two additions of the same type of wood, which are already firmly fixed in each, whose length is half a palm, and less: and the width of each is as two fingers, or less.
Et ista duo additamenta intromittuntur in os matricis, ut aperiatur cum eis quando tu reuoluis duas Vertigines.	 And these two additions are inserted into the mouth of the Matrix, so that it opens with them when you turn the two Spindles.
Forma Vertiginis qua aperitur matrix.	 The form of the Spindle which opens the Matrix.
Forma alia ad simile illius, subtilior, et leuior.	 Another form similar to it, more delicate and lighter.
Fiat ex ligno ebani, aut bussi, secundum similitudinem forcipum.	 Make it from Ebony wood, or Boxwood, according to the likeness of forceps.
Verumtamen in extremitate eius sint duo additamenta, sicut uides hic supra: et longitudo omnis additamenti ex eis est quasi palmus: et latitudo utriusque est, duo digiti.	 Nevertheless, at the end of it there should be two additions, as you see here above: and the length of each addition is as a palm: and the width of each is as two fingers.
Cum ergo uis aperire matricem cum eo, tunc fac sedere mulierem super lectum, pendentibus pedibus eius, aperto quod est inter crura eius.	 When therefore you wish to open the Matrix with it, then make the woman sit on a bed, with her legs apart, opening what is between her thighs.
Deinde intromitte ista duo additamenta coniuncta in matricem: et tu es tenens extremitatem instrumenti inferius inter coxas eius.	 Then insert these two additions together into the Matrix: and you are holding the lower end of the instrument between her thighs.
Deinde aperi manum tuam cum instrumento, sicut facis cum forficibus, aequaliter secundum quantitatem quam uis ex apertione oris matricis, donec faciat Obstetrix quod uult.	 Then open your hand with the instrument as you do with forceps, equally according to the quantity you want from the opening of the Matrix, until the Midwife does what she wants.
Forma Vertiginis alterius quam dixerunt antiqui Forma Impellentis quo impellitur foetus.	 Form of Dizziness Other Than That Which the Ancients Called Form of Pushing, by Which the Fetus is Pushed.
Forma Almisdac, qua conteritur caput magnum: et assimilatur forcipi, cui sunt dentes in extremitate, sicut uides.	 The form that crushes the large head: and it resembles a pair of forceps, which have teeth at the end, as you can see.
Et quandoque fit oblungum, sicut forcipes secundum hanc formam, sicut uides, cui sunt dentes sicut dentes serrae, quo inciditur et conteritur.	 And sometimes it becomes oblique, as forceps according to this form, as you can see, which have teeth like the teeth of a saw, with which it cuts and crushes.
Forma Almisdac quo conteritur caput paruum.	 The form that crushes the small head.
Forma Vncini habentis spinam unam.	 The form of a Scissor having one spine.
Forma Vncini habentis spinas duas.	 The form of a Scissor having two spines.
Forma forcipis cui sunt dentes serrae, cum quo conteritur caput foetus.	 The form of forceps having saw-like teeth, with which the fetal head is crushed.
Forma Spatumilis habentis duas extremitates ad abscindendum caput.	 The form of a Spatula having two ends for cutting off the head.
Forma duorum Spatumilium etiam latorum.	 The form also of two wide Spatulas.
Ista instrumenta omnia exercentur, et quanto plus multiplicantur species eorum, et praeparata sunt apud artificem, est uelocior ad operationem suam, et altior apud homines, propter quantitatem suam.	 These instruments are all operated with the fingers, and as more of their forms multiply and are prepared by the craftsman, it is quicker for its operation, and higher among people, because of their quantity.
Non ergo despicies ex eis instrumentum, quin sit apud te praeparatum.	 Therefore, do not disregard an instrument from among them, as if it were not prepared by you.
Inexcusabilis est enim necessitas eorum.	 Indeed, their necessity is inexcusable.
¶ De extractione Secundinae.	 Chapter on the Second Extraction (C-Section).
Caput LXXVIII.	 Chapter LXXVIII.
Quando retinetur Secundina apud partum, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmae, ut retineat anhelitum suum.	 When the Second Extraction (C-Section) is retained during labor, then it should be ordered that the weak ones (midwives) hold their breath.
Deinde fac eam sternutare cum condisi: et stringe manum tuam super os eius, et nares ipsius.	 Then make her sneeze with a spoon and press your hand over her mouth and her own nostrils.
Si ergo egreditur per hoc, bonum est.	 If it (the baby) exits through this, that is good.
Si non: tunc accipe ollam, et perfora in coopertorio foramen: et pone in ea herbas aperientes os matricis, sicut calamentum, rutam, et anetum, et camomillam, et sseham, et cassiam ligneam, et centauream: accipe omnes istas herbas, aut quasdam earum, et submerge eas cum aqua, et pone eas super ignem.	 If not: then take a pot and make a hole in the mattress; put in there opening herbs for the womb, such as calamint, rutabaga, anise, chamomile, sesame, cassia wood, centaury, immerse all these herbs or some of them with water, and place them over the fire.
Deinde pone embulam arundinis super foramen coopertorii ollae, et extremitatem aliam in os matricis: et teneat eam donec perueniat uapor ad concauitatem matricis.	 Then place the plunger of reed upon the opening of the pot's cover, and hold the other end against the bone of the matrix; and hold it until the vapor reaches the concavity of the matrix.
Deinde fac eam sternutare, sicut diximus.	 Then make her sneeze, as we have said.
Secundina enim egredietur cum facilitate.	 For secondarily, it will come out easily.
Si autem remaneat post hanc curationem, et non egrediatur: tunc praecipe Obstetrici, ut submergat manum suam in oleo sisamino, aut mucillagine alteae.	 If it remains after this treatment and does not come out: then command the midwife to immerse her hand in sesame oil or marshmallow root juice.
Deinde intromittat in uuluam, et quaerat cum ea Secundinam.	 Then insert into the vagina, and search for the Secondary one (baby).
Cum ergo inuenerit eam, tunc accipiat eam, et extendat ipsam paulatim.	 When she finds it, then take it, and slowly stretch it out.
Si autem fuerit annexa in profundo matricis, tunc intromittat manum, secundum quod narrauimus, donec quando inuenerit Secundinam, et extrahat eam paulatim secundum rectitudinem, ut non cadat matrix apud attractionem uehementem: imo oportet, ut permutetur cum facilitate ad latera dextra et sinistra: deinde addatur in quantitatem attractionis.	 If it is attached deeply in the matrix, then insert the hand as we have said, until when she finds the Secondary one, and pulls it out slowly along with right and left movement to avoid falling of the matrix due to strong attraction; indeed, it must be changed easily to the right and left side; then add more for the strength of the attraction.
Ipsa enim obedit tunc, et seruatur, et euadit ab adhaerentia.	 It (the baby) then yields itself, is preserved, and comes out from the attachment.
Quod si os matricis est coartatum, sicut nos iam narrauimus: cura eam cum sternutatione, et ex medicatione ollae cum herbis.	 If the bone of the matrix is crooked, as we have already said: treat it with sneezing and with medicine from the pot with herbs.
Si autem non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc caue ne fatigeris super eam in iteratione extractionis.	 If it does not come out as we have said, then be careful not to tire yourself by repeated attempts at extraction.
Verum oportet, ut quod egreditur ad os matricis ex ea, liges ad coxam mulieris.	 It is necessary that what comes out from the bone of the matrix, you tie it to the woman's hip (afterbirth).
Deinde clisteriza eam cum unguento tetrapharmacon.	 Then purge her with the ointment four-powder (purgative).
Ipsum enim putrefaciet eam post dies, et dissoluetur, et egredietur.	 It will rot it after days, and dissolve, and come out.
Verumtamen quando putrefit, eleuatur ex ea odor malus ad stomachum et caput, et laedit illud infirmam.	 However, when it rots, raise the foul smell from her stomach and head, and injure that weak place.
Oportet ergo ut administrentur suffumigationes conuenientes ad illud.	 Therefore, it is necessary that suitable fumigations are administered for that purpose.
Quidam autem antiquorum iam experti sunt suffumigationem nasturtii, et ficuum siccarum.	 Some of the ancients have already tried fumigations with nasturtium and dried figs.
Forma instrumenti quo suffumigatur mulier apud retentionem Secundinae et menstruorum.	 The shape of the instrument used to fumigate a woman during retention for afterbirth and menstruation.
Fiat ex uitro simile alcama, aut ex zere: et ponatur extremitas ampla super ignem: et suffumigatio sit posita super prunas: teneat eam, donec consumatur illa suffumigatio: et itera aliam.	 Make an instrument similar to an alembic or a jar, and place the wide end over the fire; let the fumigation be placed on plums; hold it until the fumigation is consumed; then another one should be held.
¶ De curatione Ani non perforati.	 [Chapter] On the treatment of an unperforated anus.
Caput LXXIX.	 Chapter LXXIX.
Nascuntur multi puerorum, et Ani eorum sunt non perforati, quos iam opilauit sifac subtile.	 Many male children are born whose anuses are not perforated, which the sharp flint has already cauterized.
Oportet ergo, ut obstetrix perforet illud sifac digito suo: et si non, perforet ipsum cum Spatumili acuto: et caueat lacertum, ne tangat eum.	 Therefore, the midwife should perforate it with her finger; and if not, she should perforate it with a sharp spatula; and be careful not to touch him [the child] with her arm.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam infusam in uino et oleo.	 Then place linen soaked in wine and oil on top of him [the child].
Deinde cura ipsum cum ungentis, donec sanetur.	 Then care for him with unguents until he is healed.
Si autem times quod opiletur, tunc pone in foramine cannulam de plumbo diebus multis, et auferatur quando puer uult egerere.	 If one fears that it may perforate [the anus], then place a lead pipe in the hole for many days, and remove it when the child wishes to defecate.
Et iam accidit opilatio Ani etiam ex consolidatione uulneris, aut apostematis.	 And now it happens that perforation of the anus also occurs from the consolidation of a wound or boils.
Oportet ergo ut secetur illa consolidatio, deinde curetur cum eo quod diximus ex curatione et plumbo.	 Therefore, it is necessary to cut off that consolidation, then care for it as we have said in the treatment and with lead.
¶ De curatione Fistularum quae accidunt in inferiori parte.	 [Chapter] On the treatment of fistulas occurring in the lower part.
Caput LXXX.	 Chapter LXXX.
Fistulae quae accidunt in inferiori, sunt Nodatio, et Grossitudo quae accidunt prope anum deforis: aut in spacio unius partium: et est Fistula una, aut plures.	 Fistulas that occur in the lower part are those that are nodose and swollen that occur near the anus outside; or in a space of one part; and there is one fistula, or more than one.
Cum ergo antiquatur illa Nodatio, aperitur, et currit ex ea humiditas aquosa alba, aut pus subtile.	 When therefore that ancient Nodation is opened, there runs out from it moist watery whiteness or subtle pus.
Et quandoque sunt ex istis Fistulis penetrantes.	 At times there are penetrating ones among these fistulas.
Ergo penetrantes cognoscuntur per illud quod egreditur ex egestione, et uentositate, quando utitur infirmus egestione: et fortasse egreditur ex eis uermis.	 Therefore, the penetrating ones are recognized by what comes out from the discharge, and by wind, when the sick person uses the discharge; perhaps a worm may come out of them.
Et sunt ex eis Fistulae quando sunt in spacio penetrantes usque ad uesicam, et usque ad meatum uirgae.	 These fistulas are among them when they penetrate into the space and reach the bladder, and the muscle of the penis.
Et sunt ex eis penetrantes usque ad iuncturam coxae, et usque ad nodum caudae.	 There are also penetrating ones among these that penetrate until the junction of the hips and as far as the node of the tail.
Ex eo autem quo cognoscitur Fistula penetrans usque ad anum, etiam a non penetrante, est, ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum: et intromittas tentam subtilem in Fistulam ex aere, aut ferro: quando non est tortuositas.	 From that which is recognized as the penetrating fistula until the anus, even from the non-penetrating one, it is to insert your little finger into the anus and insert a thin probe into the fistula made of metal or iron; provided there is no twisting.
Quod si in ea est tortuositas, tunc intromitte in eam tentam ex plumbo subtilem, aut pilum ex pilis equarum, donec sentias tentam, aut pilum in digito tuo.	 If there is twisting in it, then insert a thin probe made of lead or horsehair into it until you feel the probe, or the hair on your finger.
Quod si non sentis ipsam penitus, neque procedit ex foramine aliquid ex egestione, neque uentositas, neque uermis sicut dixi: tunc scias, quia est non penetrans: propera ergo ad curationem.	 If you do not feel it fully, nor does anything come out from the discharge, nor wind, nor worm as I said; then you will know that it is not penetrating - approach for treatment.
Et quando Fistula est penetrans usque ad uesicam, aut ad meatum urinae: tunc significatio eius est exitus urinae ex ea, et prohibitio eius ab hoc ut consolidetur locus cum medicinis.	 When the fistula is penetrating to the bladder or the urinary muscle, then its sign is the outflow of urine from it; and its prohibition is that the location should not be made firm with medicines.
Si uero est penetrans usque ad iuncturam coxae, aut ad os coxae: tunc signum eius est, quod perueniat tenta usque illuc, si non est in ea tortuositas usque ad os: et inuentio doloris in circumitu partis, et quod egreditur pus ex ea semper: et quod non ualeat in ea medicatio, neque consolidatur cum unguento.	 If it is penetrating to the junction of the hips or the hip bone; then its sign is that the probe reaches there, if there is no twisting up to the bone; and the pain appears around the area and that pus always comes out from it; also, treatment cannot be administered in it nor should it be made firm with an ointment.
Et in istis Fistulis omnibus penetrantibus non est curatio omnino: et curatio earum est labor et uanitas ei, ex stultis medicis, super quem formatur.	 In these fistulas penetrating there is no cure at all: and the cure of them is labor and vanity to him, on whom it is formed by foolish physicians.
In illa autem quae non est penetrans, et non antiqua, speratur sanatio cum serro: secundum quod ego narro tibi, et ego iam probaui: et est, ut iaceat infirmus inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et eleua crura eius usque supra coxas ipsius, et coxae eius sint inclinatae ad uentrem ipsius.	 But in that which is not penetrating and not ancient, healing is hoped for with a lance: as I tell you, and I have already proven it: and it is so that the sick one lies on his back under your hands upon his back: and the legs are raised up to above his hips: and the hips of his are inclined towards his stomach.
Deinde intromittetentam plumbi, aut aeris, si est in Fistula tortuositas, donec scias ubi peruenit tenta.	 Then insert lead or air, if there is a winding in the fistula, until you know where the probe has reached.
Si autem sentit eam infirmus circa anum, tunc oportet ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum.	 If, however, the sick one feels it around the anus, then it is necessary that you insert your thumb into the anus.
Si ergo sentis in digito tuo tentam iam penetrasse per seipsam detectam, praeter quod sentias inter digitum tuum, et inter ipsum sifac, aut carnem: tunc ergo scias certe, quia est penetrans: non ergo labores in ea, quoniam non est eius sanatio, sicut diximus.	 If therefore you feel the probe itself has already penetrated through the one found by itself, besides what you feel between your thumb and there or the flesh: then you know certainly that it is penetrating: do not labor in it because its healing does not exist, as we have said.
Dixerunt tamen, quia sanatur in quibusdam hominibus caro, et ex medicatione qua ei speratur iuuamentum, est, ut ignias cauterium subtile secundum amplitudinem Fistulae, sicut praecessit, et intromittas ipsum ignitum in Fistulam, donec perueniat circa anum.	 They say that the flesh heals in certain men, and the help expected from the medication is that small cautery iron be heated to the size of the fistula, as I have said earlier, and then it is inserted into the fistula while burning until it reaches around the anus.
Deinde itera illud bis, aut ter, donec scias, quia iam adustae sunt omnes illae carnes additae filtratae, quae sunt similes cannulae pennae auis.	 Then repeat that two or three times until you know that all those added fleshes filtered, which are similar to a feathered pipe, have been burned.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, donec egrediantur illae carnes, quae adustae sunt: deinde cura illud cum unguentis generantibus carnem et consolidantibus.	 Then treat it with linen wrapped in butter until the burnt flesh comes out: then treat it with ointments producing and consolidating the flesh.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est.	 If therefore it heals, it is good.
Et si non, tunc non sanatur cum alia curatione unquam.	 And if not, then it will never be healed with any other treatment.
Et si egreditur tenta, et non peruenerit usque ad digitum tuum, qui est in ano, et est inter ipsum et tentam uelamen spissum ex carne, aut sifac: et uides Fistulam in eo quod sequitur superficiem cutis, tunc seca cutem ab initio Fistulae, et tu uadis secando cum tenta quod est in fistula, donec perueniat secatio ubi peruenit tentae extremitas, et liberatur tenta et cadit.	 If it [the probing] goes out [of the anus], but does not reach your finger, which is inside, and there is a thick membrane of flesh between it and the probe, or if you see that there is a fistula following the skin surface - then cut the skin from the beginning of the fistula. And you proceed to cutting with the probe that is in the fistula until you reach where the tip of the probe ends, and the probe is released and falls out.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas, quae assimilantur cannulae pennae auis, ut non remaneat ex eis aliquid.	 Then clean those fleshy parts resembling the quill of a bird's feather, so that nothing remains from them.
Si autem uincit te sanguis, et soluit inter te et inter operationem tuam ut seces illas carnes: tunc melius quod fit, et uelocioris iuuamenti, cauterizare eam cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta.	 If blood defeats you and dissolves the bond between you and your operation so that the flesh should be separated - then it is better to burn it with fire or sharp medicine.
Quoniam cauterium cum igne aggregat habitudines bonas, adustionem illarum carnium additarum, et abscisionem sanguinis, et exiccationem humiditatum.	 Because the cautery with fire produces good conditions, burning of those fleshy parts is added, as well as the coagulation of blood and drying of moisture.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, aut caulibus tritis, donec locus emittat pus, et egrediantur illae carnes adustae in pus.	 Then treat it with linen strips wrapped in butter or heated earthenware vessels until the place produces pus, and those burned fleshy parts are expelled into the pus.
Deinde cura tunc uulnus cum unguentis consolidatiuis, generantibus carnem duram: et sunt medicinae in quibus sunt stipticitas et exiccatio.	 Then treat the wound with ointments that harden the flesh, producing tough skin; and there are medications containing astringents and drying agents.
Nam quando restaurantur, tunc iam sanatur: et non times iterationem.	 For when it [the wound] is repaired, then it is healed; do not fear repetition.
Si autem Fistula iam peruenit usque ad profundum ani, et elongatur a superfluitate corporis: tunc intromitte digitum tuum in anum, et inquire cum eo.	 If the fistula has already reached the deep part of the anus and is prolonged from the body - then insert your finger into the anus and examine it.
Si ergo sentis tentam, et inter te, et inter eam est uelamen ex sifac, aut carne, et est propinqua penetrationi: tunc non est operatio in illo, nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	 Therefore, if you feel a probe, and between it and yourself is a membrane of flesh or skin, and it is approaching perforation - then there should be no operation on it, except according to the way of faith and hope.
Quod est, quia administratur in eo unus trium modorum: aut ut cauterizes ipsam, sicut diximus: aut seces eam, donec consequaris concauitatem eius, ut sit possibile tibi intromittere licinia, et curationem ex proximo.	 That is because it is administered in him one of three methods: either to cauterize it itself, as we have said; or to excise it, until you reach its concavity, so that it is possible for you to insert the linen, and cure it from nearby.
Et non procedas multum cum sectione, ut non incidas lacertum continentem anum, et accidat super infirmum exitus egestionis absque uoluntate.	 And do not proceed much with the excision, lest you cut the flesh containing the anus, and an unwanted evacuation occur.
Deinde cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	 Then treat that with what I have said.
Fortasse enim sanabitur: aut elonges ipsum uelamen, et mundes ipsum postquam secas ipsum usque prope anum, sicut diximus, aut cum tenta, aut cum instrumento alio acutae extremitatis.	 Perhaps it will heal: or stretch the membrane and clean it after you cut it up to near the anus, as we have said, or with a probe, or with another sharp-tipped instrument.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas quae sunt in sectione, usque ubi potes cum perscrutatione.	 Then clean those flesh particles that are in the incision, as far as you can with examination.
Deinde conare restaurationem uulneris totius cum sectione, et orificio superiore ubi consolidatur: et remanet Fistula aperta in interiore parte anus, et erit leuius super infirmum.	 Then try the healing of the whole wound with the incision, and with the upper opening where it heals; and a fistula remains open in the interior part of the anus, and it will be easier on the sick.
Et quandoque suitur Fistula secundum hunc modum: et est, quando intromittis tentam in Fistulam: et est in latere ani circa superficiem corporis cum cute et margine ani: tunc accipe tentam perforatae extremitatis, quae est sicut acus aleskef, id est, praeparantium coria, secundum hanc formam.	 And sometimes a fistula is drained in this manner: and it is when you insert a probe into the fistula; and it is on the side of the anus near the surface of the body with skin and edge of the anus; then take a perforated probe tip, which is like an awl point, that is prepared ox hide, in this shape.
Et intromitte in eam filum inuolutum ex quinque filis, et circiter ea.	 And insert into it a thread wound around five strands and about that [size].
Deinde intromitte tentam cum filo in Fistulam, donec consequatur concauitatem eius.	 Then insert the probe with the thread into the fistula, until you reach its concavity.
Si ergo est penetrans in margine ani interius prope, tunc extrahe filum ex illo foramine: ita ut intromittas digitum tuum in anum, et extrahas extremitatem fili, et aggreges duas extremitates simul: et stringe utramque, et dimitte illud die uno, aut duobus diebus: et quanto plus incidit filum in carne, stringe ipsum bene, donec incidantur illae carnes quae sunt inter duas extremitates fili, et cadant: deinde cura uulnus, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	 If it is penetrating into the edge of the anus internally, then pull out the thread from that hole; so that you insert your finger into the anus, and pull out the tip of the thread, and bind both ends together; and tighten each one, and leave it for one or two days; and the more the thread cuts into the flesh, the better tighten it, until those tissues between the two ends of the thread fall off and drop out; then treat the wound, until it heals and recovers.
Si autem orificium Fistulae non est penetrans: tunc fac ipsum penetrare quocunque modo praeparatur tibi, nisi sit in profundo multum.	 If, however, the opening of the Fistula is not penetrating: then make it penetrable in any way prepared for you, unless it is in a very deep place.
Non enim inest tibi, ut facias illud propter lacertum, ut non incidas ipsum.	 You have no need to do so (that action), lest you cut the arm itself.
Deinde fac cum ea sicut diximus, donec sanetur.	 Then proceed as we said, until it heals.
Forma Spatumilis spinosi quo finditur Fistula, cuius curuitas est acuta ualde, et pars altera est non acuta, ut non incidat illud quod non est necesse, sicut uides.	 Make a beak-shaped spatula, sharp on the part that enters the Fistula, whose edge is very sharp; and the other part is not sharp, so as not to cut what is not necessary, as you see.
¶ De sutura Hemorroidarum, ex quibus currit sanguis ex incisione earum: et cura fissurarum.	 On stitching Piles (Hemorroids), from which blood flows when they are cut; and on the treatment of cracks.
Caput LXXXI.	 Chapter LXXXI.
Sunt Hemorroides secundum duos modos.	 There are Hemorroids in two ways.
Aut enim sunt intra anum, similes uesicis carbonum, uel prunarum: aut quasi ipsae sint grana uuae.	 Or they are inside the anus, similar to coal blisters or prune stones; or as if they were like grains of wheat.
Et ex eis sunt paruae, et magnae: et sanguis currit ex eis semper, et est una, et sunt multae.	 And among them are small ones and large ones; and blood always flows from them, and there is one and there are many.
Et sunt extra anum, et in extremitatibus eius.	 And they are outside the anus, and at its extremities.
Verumtamen istae quae sunt extra anum, sunt secundum plurimum paucae humiditatis, ex quibus currit aqua citrina, aut parum sanguinis cursu assiduo: et sunt secundum colorem corporis.	 However, those that are outside the anus are mostly few in moisture, from which yellow water or a small amount of blood flows continually; and they are according to the color of the body.
Et curatio eius quae est intra anum, est, ut praecipias infirmo ut assellet: et exprimatur, donec egrediatur anus, et appareant athelil tibi.	 And the treatment of that which is inside the anus, is to command the patient to sit in hot water, and it is squeezed out until it appears at the anus, and you see it.
Propterea ergo et suspende cum uncinis: aut tene eos cum ungue tuo.	 Therefore also hang them with hooks; or hold them with your nail.
Deinde incide eos apud radices suas.	 Then cut them at their roots.
Si autem non retinentur in eis uncini, propter humiditatem eorum et ipsorum mollificationem: tunc cape eos cum panno aspero, aut cum coto ex diploide lanea, et extrahe eos cum digitis tuis.	 If they are not held in by hooks due to their moisture and softening; then grasp them with a rough cloth or a double-layered woolen fabric, and pull them out with your fingers.
Deinde incide eos, et pulueriza super eos post incisionem quosdam pulueres calidos, ut stent eis loco cauterii.	 Then cut them (the vessels) and sprinkle some warm powders over them after the incision as a substitute for cautery.
Aut cauteriza eos secundum quod praecessit in capitulo cauterizandi.	 Cauterize them according to what has been described in the previous chapter on cauterization.
Deinde cura eos cum reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	 Then care for them with the rest of the treatment until they heal.
Quod si non obedit anus egressioni, tunc clisteriza infirmum clisteri in quo sit mordicatio parua, ut lauetur cum eo quod est in ano, et obediat egressioni uelociter, quando exprimit se infirmus.	 If the anus does not obey the enema, then administer a gentle enema with an emetic substance to cleanse what is in the anus and make it quickly obey the evacuation when it discharges.
Si autem athelil sunt extrinseci ab ano, tunc res eorum est leuis, facilis: et est ut capias eos cum ungue tuo, aut capias eos cum uncino, et incidas eos.	 If they are external ulcers from the anus, then their condition is light and easy: and it is to seize them with your nail or with a pair of forceps and cut them.
Deinde cura eos cum eo quod diximus, donec sanentur.	 Then care for them as we have said, until they heal.
Et qui abhorret incisionem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut administres suturam eorum secundum hunc modum.	 And if the incision is resisted by iron, then it is necessary to administer a suture for them in this way.
Accipe filum inuolutum, et intromitte ipsum in acum.	 Take thread wound around a needle and insert it into the point (of the ulcer).
Deinde extrahe athelil ad superiora, et fac ipsum penetrare cum acu in radice eius ex parte altera: et inuolue duas extremitates fili, in inferiori parte acus, et sint latitudinaliter: et stringe athelil strictura forti.	 Then draw out the ulcers towards the top and make it penetrate with the needle into the root of the other side: and wind up the two ends of the thread, on the lower part of the needle, and let them be wide: and tighten the ulcer with a strong ligature.
Deinde noda filum, et extrahe acum.	 Then tie the thread and pull out the needle.
Fac illud cum omnibus athelil, et dimitte ex eis unum: nec suas ipsum, ut currat ex eo superfluitas sanguinis.	 Do the same with all the ulcers, and leave one of them: do not seize it to avoid excess bleeding from it.
Deinde pone super anum pannum infusum in oleo rosato, aut caeroto, et pone ipsum super anum: et praecipe infirmo, ut quiescat.	 Then place a cloth soaked in rose oil or pitch on the anus and put it on the anus: and tell the patient to rest.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, donec cadat.	 Then dismiss him until he falls asleep.
Cum ergo cadunt athelil, cura eos cum unguentis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	 When the ulcers fall off, care for them with ointments and the rest of the treatment, until they heal.
¶ De cura Fissurarum.	 Treatment of Fissures.
Multotiens enim accidunt ex exiccatione stercoris, et constrictione naturae.	 For they often occur from evacuation of feces and constriction of nature.
Cum ergo antiquantur, et non ualet in eis medicina: tunc oportet ut radas cum puncta Spatumilis, aut cum ungue tuo, donec fiant humidae, et auferatur ab eis cortex superior qui prohibet eas a consolidatione.	 When they have grown old and medicine is of no avail: then it is necessary to shave with spatula or nail, until they become moist and the superficial layer which prevents their healing is removed.
Deinde cura eas, donec consolidentur secundum quod oportet.	 Then care for them until they are healed as required.
Si autem non consolidantur: tunc itera eas cum rasione uehementiori quam prima, donec sanguinentur multum, et excorientur deinde cura eas, donec sanentur.	 If they do not heal: then treat them again with a stronger reason than before, until they bleed much, and then care for them until they are healed.
¶ De curatione Almirmar inuersorum, et non inuersorum: et Athelil siccorum, et Formicae.	 On the treatment of Almirmar ulcers, and not ulcers: and Athelil sores, and Formicae.
Caput LXXXII.	 Chapter LXXXII.
Scias quod Almirmar non est nisi nodus rotundus secundum colorem corporis, similis capiti claui: et fit in toto corpore, praecipue in inferioribus partibus pedum, et digitis: et accidit ex eis dolor apud ambulationem.	 Know that Almirmar is not anything but a round nodule similar to the color of the body, like the head of a nail: and it occurs throughout the body, especially in the lower parts of the feet and fingers: and pain occurs during walking from them.
Oportet ergo ut secetur quod est in circumitu claui, et teneatur cum forficibus, aut cum uncino, et eradicetur ex radice sua.	 Therefore it must be cut that which is on the edge of the nail, and held with forceps or tweezers, and uprooted from its root.
Deinde cura illud: et si uis cauteriza illud secundum quod praecessit in capitulo suo.	 Then care for that, and if you wish to cauterize it as mentioned in the previous chapter.
Ex athelil autem siccis unus est eminentia parua, aspera, filtrata, rotunda supra superficiem corporis.	 Athelil is one of the dry sores: and there is a small projection that is rough, filtered, round on the surface of the body.
Et multotiens accidunt in manibus puerorum.	 And they often occur in the hands of children.
Et curatio eius est, ut extendas athelil, et incidas ipsum: aut stringas ipsum cum filo de serico: aut cum pilo, donec cadat.	 And its treatment is to stretch Athelil, and cut it itself: or sew it with silk thread: or with wool, until it falls off.
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum secundum quod praemissum est cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta: et iam eradicantur athelil inuersi, et non inuersi cum instrumento quod ego dicam.	 And if you wish, cauterize it as mentioned before with fire or sharp medicine: and now Athelil ulcers, and not ulcers are uprooted with the tool that I will say.
Formica autem est etiam eminentia parua filtrata, grossa, super superficiem corporis, uadens in profundum ualde: et quando inuenit eam frigus, sentitur in ea simile mordicationi formicae, et fit in corpore toto: et plurimum eius fit in manibus.	 Formica is also a small, filtered projection, coarse on the surface of the body, penetrating very deep: and when it is found cold, it feels like biting by an ant, and occurs throughout the body: and most often it occurs in the hands.
Et curatio eius est, ut accipias cannulam ex penna anseris, aut penna uulturis forti: et pone illam cannulam super Formicam, donec contineat circulus cannulae ex partibus eius.	 And its treatment is to take a reed from the goose feather or strong vulture feather: and place the reed on Formica until it holds the circle of the reed from its parts.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum cannula, donec seces quod est in circumitu Formicae: et ponas eam in profundo carnis, et eradices Formicam ex radice eius.	 Then turn your hand with the cannula until you reach what is around the Ant (Formica). Place it into the depth of the flesh and root out the Ant from its root.
Et si uis, fac illud cum cannula aeris, aut ferri, secundum hanc formam.	 And if you wish, do this with a metal or iron cannula in this manner.
Sit superius cannulae ad sublimitatem trahens surdum inuolutum, ut alleuietur super digitum apprehensio eius et ipsius reuolutio.	 Place the cannula on top with a pull towards its highest point to loosen the deaf person's swelling around the finger and its subsequent rotation.
Et si uis cauteriza Formicam secundum quod praemissum est in cauterizatione Athelil in capitulo de cauterio.	 And if you wish, cauterize the Ant according to what has been said before in the chapter on cauterization of Athelil.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum quae administrantur ad Clisteria in aegritudinibus Ani, et solutionis uentris, et colicae.	 Chapter on the shapes of instruments used for administering enemas in diseases of the anus, and of the solution of the abdomen, and colics.
Caput LXXXIII.	 Chapter LXXXIII.
Quandoque Clistere fit ex argento, aut ex aurichalco, aut ex aere fuso, aut malleato.	 Sometimes an enema is made of silver, or gold plated, or brass melted, or hammered.
Et quandoque fit ex istis Instrumentis paruum, et magnum, secundum illos in quibus administrantur.	 And sometimes these instruments are small, and large, according to those in which they are administered.
Illud ergo quod administratur in curatione puerorum paruorum, sit paruum: et quorum ani sunt debiles, aut dolorosi, sic et clisteria eorum.	 Therefore, the enema given for the treatment of small children should be small. And those for weak or painful anuses should also be small.
Clistere magnum.	 Large enema.
Cistere paruum.	 Small enema.
Canna eius, id est, caput superius in quo ligatur uter, sit amplum secundum hunc modum: et sit ei distinctio ut ligetur uter sicut uides, et extremitas eius inferior quae intromittitur in anum, sit surda, id est, non aperta, lenis, ualde, trahens ad subtilitatem: et in uno laterum eius sint duo foramina, et in latere altero foramen unum.	 The cannula of this (enema), that is the upper part where the uterus is tied, should be wide according to this method: and it should have a division so that the uterus can be tied as you see, and its lower end which is inserted into the anus, should be blunt, not open, soft, very thin, extending to subtlety. And on one side of it there should be two holes, and on the other side one hole.
Et sit amplitudo foraminis secundum grossitudinem radiorum, et grossius parum, et sit uter in quo ponuntur medicinae ex uesica animalis: aut ex charta ouis, quae sit secundum formam asofrati paruae: cuius radix sit palmus unus.	 And the size of the hole should be according to the thickness of a ray, and somewhat coarse but not too much. The uterus in which the medicines are placed should be that of an animal's bladder or a sheep's parchment, shaped like a small asafoetida bag, whose root should be one palm.
Et perforetur foraminibus multis sicut reuoluitur, et sit spacium quod est inter omne foramen grossitudo digiti.	 The incisions should be made in numerous holes as is customary, and the space between each hole should be of the thickness of a finger.
Deinde intromitte in illa foramina filum forte ex filo crudo, quod sit ex decem filis, aut circiter ea, et aggrega cum eo utrem sicut asofrati.	 Then insert into those holes a thread made of raw silk, which should be about ten threads, or approximately that, and wrap it around with wool as one does with asafetida.
Cum ergo ponitur in eo uter, stringatur in capite clisteris inter duo distinguentia constrictione forti.	 When the uterus is placed inside, it should be tied at the top with a strong constriction using a clyster.
Deinde clisteriza cum eo.	 Then administer a clyster to it.
Et haec est forma circuli utris hic depicta, et foraminum.	 And this is the shape of the circle and the holes as depicted here.
Qualitas autem clisterizandi cum eo, est: ut impleas utrem, aut uesicam ex medicina, quae sit calefacta secundum quantitatem tolerantiae infirmi: et caue ne sit calida ualde, aut frigida ualde.	 The quality of administering a clyster to it is as follows: fill the wool or bladder with medicine that has been heated to the quantity that the patient can tolerate; and be careful not for it to be excessively hot or excessively cold.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et eleuet crura sua ad superiora: et pone sub eo inthaan, id est, corium super quod iacent homines, aut linteamen.	 Then the patient lies down on his back, and raises his legs towards the top; and place under him a bed, that is to say, a skin or cloth upon which people lie.
Deinde inunge extremitatem Clisteris cum oleo, aut cum albugine oui, aut cum mucillagine foenugraeci, aut similium.	 Then anoint the end of the clyster with olive oil, or with lard, or with mucilage from fenugreek, or similar things.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in anum cum facilitate.	 Then insert it into the anus with ease.
Deinde accipiat minister utrem cum duabus manibus suis simul, et exprimat ipsum cum uehementia, donec euacuet totum quod est in Clisteri in intestinum.	 Then receive the assistant with both hands, and squeeze it out with force, until all that is in the clyster is expelled into the intestine.
Deinde extrahe Clistere, et eleuet infirmus crura sua ad parietem.	 Then remove the clyster and raise the patient's legs towards the wall.
Quod si medicina cogit eum ad exitum, tunc teneat quantum potest.	 If the medicine forces him to evacuate, then hold him as much as possible.
Et si dormit cum ea nocte tota, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	 And if he sleeps through the entire night with this, it is more beneficial for his recovery.
Si autem clisterizas eum in aegritudinibus solutionis uentris, et festinat exitus eius: tunc itera clistere, donec sanetur.	 If you administer the clyster to him in cases of abdominal illness and he evacuates quickly: then repeat the clyster until he is cured.
Quod si in ano sunt hemorroides, aut apostemata laedentia, tunc sit clistere subtile ualde, lene, ex clisteribus quibus clisterizantur pueri.	 If there are hemorrhoids or wounds in the anus, then let the clyster be very subtle and gentle, from the clysters with which children are clystered.
Et haec sit forma clisteris subtilis super quod sit stricta cutis.	 Let this be the form of the subtle clyster upon which the skin is tightened.
¶ De curatione Vulnerum capitis sine fractura ossis.	 On the treatment of head wounds without bone fracture.
Caput LXXXIIII.	 Head, number LXXXIV.
Iam dixi in diuisione de curatione uulnerum quod conueniebat libro, et ego dicam hic curationem eorum cum manu, et cum medicinis secundum complementum.	 I have already said in the division on the treatment of wounds that it was appropriate for a book, and here I will speak of their treatment by hand, and with medications as a supplement.
Dico ergo, quod uulnera diuersificantur secundum illud quo fiunt uulnera, et secundum locum super quem cadit uulnus.	 Therefore, wounds are differentiated according to the cause by which they occur, and according to the place upon which the wound falls.
Res ergo quibus fiunt uulnera multotiens, sunt sicut iactus lapidis: aut incisio ensis, aut cultelli: aut percussio cum lancea, aut ligno, aut sagitta: et similibus illis ex rebus multis.	 Thus, the causes of wounds are as numerous as the throw of a stone: or a cut by a sword, or a knife: or a thrust with a spear, or wood, or arrow, and similar things from many other things.
Vulnera autem quae fiunt secundum loca corporis sunt, sicut uulnus quod cadit super caput, aut collum, aut pectus, aut uentrem, aut epar: et similia ex eis membris.	 Wounds that occur according to the body parts are as follows: a wound that falls on the head, or neck, or chest, or abdomen, or back, and similar things from those members.
Et ego sum narrans curationes quorundam uulnerum, ut ponam eam ratiocinationem et regulam super reliqua uulnera.	 And I am telling the treatment of certain wounds, so that I may present the reasoning and rule for the remaining wounds.
Et ego incipiam a uulneribus capitis simplicibus: quoniam rememoratio compositorum ueniet in principio capituli tertii.	 And I will begin with simple head wounds, since the account of compound wounds will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
Dico ergo.	 Therefore.
Quando accidit in capite uulnus simplex, et non est fractura ossis: considera tunc, si est ex iactu lapidis, aut ei similibus, et iam fregit cutem tantum: et est uulnus magnum, et times super infirmum euentum apostematis calidi: tunc propera, et phlebotoma cephalicam statim: et non tardes illud: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius: si non fuerit prohibens aliquid a phlebotomia, praecipue si fuerit sanguis qui egreditur ex uulnere paucus.	 When there is a simple wound on the head and no bone fracture has occurred: consider then if it was caused by the throw of a stone or something similar, and only the skin has been broken, and the wound is large and you fear that warm abscesses may occur: then hurry, and perform phlebotomy cephalic immediately: do not delay this, and draw out from him according to the amount of its virtue as much blood as possible, unless something prohibits phlebotomy, especially if little blood is exiting from the wound.
Et sit phlebotomia ex contrario partis uulneratae.	 Phlebotomy should be from the opposite side of the wounded part.
Et caueat infirmus sibi a repletione, et uino, et cibis grossis.	 Let the sick person avoid self-indulgence, wine and heavy foods.
Si autem minutionem prohibet aliquid, tunc minoretur ex cibo, et non appropinquet carnibus, neque uinis.	 If something forbids reduction, then it should be reduced from food, not from flesh nor wine.
Et pone super uulnus si accidit ei apostema calidum, cotum infusum in oleo rosato solo, aut cum uino in quo est stipticitas.	 Place over the wound if it happens to be a hot abscess, boiled cotton soaked in warm rose oil alone, or with wine containing saltpeter.
Si autem securus fueris ab apostemate calido, tunc pone super uulnus, si est recens cum sanguine suo, et non mutauit ipsum aer, puluerem quem ego narrabo post paululum: et si iam mutauit ipsum aer, tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, donec sanetur.	 If you are free from a hot abscess, then place over the wound if it is recent with its own blood and has not changed the air around it. And if the air around it has already changed, then place some ointments over it until it heals. (Followed by a statement about the powder to be used if the air changes.)
Si autem uulnus est magnum, aut est ex incisione ensis, et similium: et non aggregantur labia eius per puluillos, tunc aggrega ipsa cum sutura, secundum quod ego narrabo in uulneribus uentris de sutura eorum.	 If the wound is large or from a sword cut and similar, do not bring the edges together by stitches through holes, but bring them together with sutures as I shall tell you about in wounds of the abdomen regarding their suturing.
Si autem uulnus iam detectum est ab osse, et pendet, et non est retentio eius, nisi in suspensorio paruo: tunc incide ipsum.	 If the wound is already from bone and hangs and there is no holding of it except with a small hook, then cut it.
Deinde cura uulnus cum medicinis, et restaura in eo carnem duram loco cutis, et praecipe infirmo, ut alatur cibis in quibus est grossitudo, sicut sunt capita, et triticum coctum, donec sit ut puls: et eis similia.	 Then care for the wound with medicines and restore the hard flesh to its place in the skin, and advise the sick person to eat foods with heaviness, such as bread and cooked wheat, until it is soft; and similar things.
Quod si inuenis in cute putrefactionem, et non adhaeret ossi: tunc incide putrefactum totum, et proiice ipsum: deinde cura illud.	 If you find corruption in the skin that is not attached to bone, then cut out the rotten part and throw it away; then care for it afterwards.
Si autem in his uulneribus est arteria, aut uena ex qua fluit sanguis: et non abscinditur per medicinas, tunc inquire super arteriam.	 If in these wounds there is an artery or vein from which blood flows and it cannot be separated by medicine, then look for the artery.
Si ergo inuenis eam non sectam, tunc seca eam cum Spatumili, aut liga eam.	 If you find it uncut, then cut it with a Spatula, or tie it.
Quod si necessitas prouocat quando non confert illud quod diximus, tunc cauteriza eam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 If necessity compels and it does not yield what has been said, then cauterize it until the blood is cut off.
Si autem uulnera ista sunt parua, simplicia, tunc res eorum est facilis, leuis: ita ut puluerizes super ea hunc puluerem: quoniam consolidat ea antequam mutet ea aer.	 If these wounds are small and simple, the cure is easy and light; thus, scatter this powder over them, because it consolidates them before the air changes them.
¶ Modus Pulueris incarnatiui.	 Method of Powder for Healing.
Recipe olibani partem unam, et sanguinis draconis partes duas, et calcis non extinctae partes tres: teratur totum multum, et cribelletur: et impleatur ex eo uulnus, et constringatur constrictione bona, donec adhaereat super ipsum bene, et coaguletur cum sanguine.	 Take one part of olibanum, two parts of dragon's blood, and three parts of unburnt lime; grind it all thoroughly, then sift it; fill the wound with it, bind it tightly until it adheres well to it, and let it coagulate with the blood.
Deinde stringe ipsum desuper cum puluillis, et dimitte ipsum, neque soluas ipsum dum permanet, ita quod non apostemetur.	 Then bind it on top with small bindings and leave it alone, do not loosen it until it does not separate.
Nam non eradicatur ab eo medicina, donec sanatur.	 For the medicine will not be pulled out of him until he is healed.
Et quandoque facit illud calx sola, quando non sunt tibi in praesenti olibanum, et sanguis draconis etiam facit eandem operationem in multis ex uulneribus magnis, quando conuenit ut ponatur super ea et stringantur, et sunt uulnera recentia cum sanguine suo, quae non alterauit aer.	 Sometimes lime alone does it when olibanum and dragon's blood are not available to you at present; moreover, lime performs the same operation in many large wounds when it is to be placed upon them and they are bound, and the wounds are recent with their own blood, which has not been changed by air.
Quod si iam alterauit ea aer quadam alteratione, praecipue quando est in tempore aestatis, tunc non est in positione huius pulueris intentio: cura ergo ipsum cum eo quod diximus, ita ut ponas super ea quaedam unguenta digestiua: aut ponas super ea pultes ex farina hordei, factas cum aqua et melle, donec emittant pus.	 If the air has already changed them by some change, especially during summertime, then this powder is not suitable; therefore, treat it with what I have said, placing some digestive ointments on them or putting on them poultices made from barley flour, prepared with water and honey, until they emit pus.
Deinde cura ea reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	 Then treat the rest of it with the remaining cure until they are healed.
Si uero accidat cum uulnere fractura in osse, et est parua, tunc extrahe illud cum Gesti: et ego iam dicam curationem fracturarum capitis in eo quod futurum est.	 But if it happens that there is a fracture of the bone with a wound and it is small, then extract it with Gui (Gesti); I will soon say the cure for fractures of the skull in what follows.
¶ De uulneribus Colli.	 On wounds of the neck.
Caput LXXXV.	 Chapter LXXXV.
SI Autem uulnus accidat in Collo, tunc non est inter ipsum differentia in medicatione, et inter uulnus capitis quando est simplex.	 If a wound occurs in the neck, then there is no difference in treatment between it and a simple wound of the head.
Si autem iam incisus est neruus Colli, aut arteria: tunc si est neruus, non est in eo ingenium, nisi ut deuitetur curatio eius cum eo quod facit stipticitatem uehementem, sicut ziniar, et zegi, et eis similia.	 If the nerve or artery of the neck is already cut: then, if it is a nerve, there is no skill in treating it except to avoid treatment for the strong stiffness it causes, like the ziniar and zegi and similar ones.
Quoniam nocent neruis, et contrahunt eos.	 Because they are harmful and contract them.
Et non ponas super uulnus aliquid frigidum omnino: quoniam substantia neruorum est frigida, et continuatio eius est cum cerebro, quod est sublimius membrorum: et sit illud quo curatur ex medicinis lene, sicut calx lota cum aqua dulci aliquotiens infusa cum oleo, aut cum oleo rosato, et tuthia, quando abluitur etiam cum aqua dulci: et reliqui lapides minerales, secundum hunc modum, et unguenta humida.	 And do not place anything cold at all on the wound: because the substance of nerves is cold, and their continuation is with the brain, which is above the organs; and let what is used to treat it be made from soft medicines, like limestone mixed with sweet water several times infused with oil, or rose oil, and turpentine, when it is washed even with sweet water; and the remaining mineral stones, in this manner, and moist ointments.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, tunc administra suturam: aut coarta labia eius cum puluillis.	 If the wound is large, then administer suture; or strip the edges of its lips with pulpilles.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it until it heals.
Si uero uulneri est profunditas, aut accidit in eo sinus in inferiori parte eius, in quo iam aggregatur pus, tunc perfora ipsum in magis depresso loco in eo.	 If the wound is deep or occurs in it a cavity on its lower part, where already pus collects, then pierce it at a more depressed place in it.
Quod si iam incisa est in uulnere arteria, et consecutus est sanguinem eius fluxus: tunc separa, uel seca eam, et liga ipsam: aut cauteriza eam, si prouocat necessitas ad illud.	 If the artery is already cut in the wound and there follows a flow of blood from it: then separate it, or cut it off and tie it; or cauterize it, if necessity requires that.
Si autem iam incidit spondiles gutturis, aut totum, et saluatae sunt alhaudegi: tunc aggrega labia cutis cum sutura super cannam gutturis, et non tangas guttur, imo aequa ipsum, et reduc ipsum super figuram naturalem.	 If the windpipe (spondiles) has already been split open, entirely, and the trachea has been saved: then join together the lips of the skin with suture over a reed for the throat, and do not touch the throat, but rather equalize it, and bring it back to its natural shape.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti, et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot.	 Then tie the wound with a suitable suture and let it be for some days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis in quibus est stipticitas et exiccatio, donec sanetur.	 Then treat it with ointments containing astringents and drying agents until it heals.
Si autem uulnus iam fecit impressionem in osse, tunc perquire ipsum: tunc si in ipso sunt fragmenta ossis, extrahe ea omnia, aut quae potes ex eis: et quod non praeparatur, dimitte illud, donec putrescat uulnus, et separetur et alleuietur egressio eius.	 If the wound has already made an impression on the bone, then examine it. If there are pieces of bone inside, remove them all or as many as possible. And whatever cannot be prepared at that time, leave it until the wound rots, separates and heals over.
Quod si uulnus fuerit recens, tunc pulueriza super ipsum puluerem quem narraui.	 If the wound is recent, then dust it with the powder I mentioned.
Si autem uidetur in uulnere os, et fit Fistula: tunc cura ipsam cum eo cuius rememoratio uenit in capitulo suo.	 If a bone appears in the wound and a fistula is formed: then treat it as described in its respective chapter.
¶ De uulnere in Spatulis.	 Chapter on wounds using probes.
Caput LXXXVI.	 Chapter 86.
SI Est percussio lanceae, aut cultelli: et uides eius profunditatem, tunc considera.	 If it is a wound caused by a spear or knife, and you can see its depth: then examine it.
Si ergo ex uulnere egreditur uentositas, quando anhelat ex eo infirmus, tunc scias, quia uulnus est mortale.	 If a gas escapes from the wound when the person is weakly breathing, then you know that the wound is mortal.
Quod si non fuerit ei profunditas, et est recens cum sanguine suo: tunc non ponas in eo a prima hora puluerem, neque stringas ipsum, ut non retineatur sanguis in profunditate eius, et reuertatur ad cor, et interficiat infirmum: sed pone in ipso unguentum attractiuum, et solue ipsum in die bis.	 If the depth of the wound is not visible and it is recent with blood: then do not apply powder to it immediately nor tie it up, so that the blood does not remain in its depth and returns to the heart and kills the weakened person; instead apply an attracting ointment and dissolve it twice a day.
Si uero unguentum non est tibi praesens, tunc pone in orificio uulneris cotum uetustum, ut sugat illud quod egreditur de eo ex humiditatibus: et fac ut dormiat infirmus super uulnus, ut currat quod aggregatur in eo.	 If the ointment is not available to you, then place on the wound's opening an old piece of cotton to absorb what escapes from it due to moisture; and let the weakened person sleep over the wound so that it runs together and heals.
Si uero iam praeterierint uulneri tres dies, aut plures, et non accidit infirmo spasmus, neque tremor cordis malus, neque strictura in anhelitu, et uides reliquas dispositiones eius bonas: tunc scias, quia uulnus est saluum.	 If three or more days have passed since the wound occurred, and there is no spasm, no bad heart tremor, no shortness of breath constriction, and you can see that its other signs are good: then know that the wound is healthy.
Cura ergo ipsum et cum liciniis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Cure yourself and with liniments, and with the remaining treatment, until you are healed.
Si uero excusatur sanatio eius, et iam aperitur semper, tunc scias, quia iam factum est Fistula.	 If it is excised (the affected part), and healing begins again, then you will know that it has become a Fistula.
Cura ergo ipsam ex capitulo suo.	 Cure it from its own chapter (part).
Et si uulnus est ex incisione ensis, aut cultelli, et est simplex in superficie pectoris, aut dorsi: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit ex sutura, si est magnum: aut cum puluere, si est paruum.	 And if it is a wound from sword or knife cut, and it is simple on the surface of the chest or back: then cure it with that which preceded (first aid), if it is large: or with powder, if it is small.
Si autem iam fecit impressionem in osse, et incidit ex eo frusta: tunc inquire uulnus, et propera ad extrahendum illa frusta, si sunt separata.	 If it has already made an impression on the bone and cut off fragments from it: then search for the wound, and rush to extract those fragments, if they are separated.
Si uero non sunt separata, tunc dimitte ea, donec putrefiat uulnus, alleuiatur enim extractio eorum.	 If they are not separated, then leave them until the wound putsrefies; for extraction of them is deodorized.
Reliquorum autem uulnerum accidentium in reliquis membris iudicium in curatione, est iudicium eius quod diximus.	 For other wounds due to accidents on the remaining members, the judgment in treatment is the same as what we have said.
¶ De uulneribus Ventris, et exitu intestini, et exitura eorum.	 Chapter on abdominal wounds and the expulsion of the intestines, and their return.
Caput LXXXVII.	 Chapter LXXXVII.
Disruptio quae accidit uentri, est magna, et media, et parua.	 A rupture that occurs in the abdomen is great, middle, or small.
Ex magna igitur quandoque egreditur intestinum, aut numerus intestinorum.	 From a great rupture, intestines or their number sometimes come out.
Quare fit intromissio eorum, et eorum sutura uehementior et difficilior.	 Therefore, their insertion and stitching is made more difficult and forceful.
Et disruptio parua etiam fit difficilis ex modo alio.	 A small rupture is also difficult in another way.
Sequitur ergo, ut sit reductio eorum difficilior, si non properas in intromissione sua ad locum suum statim: quoniam inflatur, aperitur, et ingrossatur: quare fit difficilis introitus eius.	 Therefore, its return is more difficult if you do not rush to the site for its insertion immediately; because it swells, opens up and enlarges; hence the entry is difficult.
Propter hoc ergo fit melior disruptionum disruptio media: quoniam cum ea non fit difficilis reductio intestini, sicut fit dissicilis in his duabus speciebus.	 Therefore, a medium rupture is more beneficial because with it the return of the intestine is not difficult, as it is in these two types (great and small).
Scias, quod sutura uenris est secundum quatuor modos.	 You should know that stitching of veins is according to four modes.
Duae suturae communes conueniunt in sutura uentris, et in sutura reliquorum uulnerum corporis: et duae suturae aliae proprie communicant reliquis uulneribus.	 Two types of stitches commonly join in stitching the vein, and in stitching other wounds of the body; and two other types of stitches specifically communicate with other wounds.
Verumtamen sunt magis propriae cum sutura uentris: et ego narro tibi unamquamque cum expositione, et declaratione.	 However, they are more suitable for stitching the vein; and I tell you one by one with explanation and clarification.
Dico ergo, quia quando uulnus est paruum, et egreditur ex eo aliquid ex intestino, et fit difficile reducere ipsum: tunc illud est propter unum duorum modorum.	 Therefore, when the wound is small and something comes out of it from the intestine, and it becomes difficult to return it; then this is due to one of the two modes.
Aut propter paruitatem disruptionis, sicut diximus: Aut quoniam in intestino est inflatio propter frigus aeris.	 Or because of the smallness of the rupture, as we said; or because there is inflation in the intestine due to cold air.
Quando ergo illud est ita, tunc oportet ut calefacias ipsum, ita ut submergas spongiam, aut pannum humidum in aqua tepida sola.	 When this is so, then it is necessary to heat it so that you immerse a sponge or damp cloth in warm water only.
Aut decoquas in aqua squinantum, et cyperum, et spicam, et embroces cum ea intestinum, donec resoluatur inflatio.	 Or cook in water with squill, cyperus, pepper, and myrrh with the intestine until the inflation is resolved.
Quandoque facit illud uinum in quo est stipticitas: et est melius quam aqua sola in resolutione inflationis.	 Sometimes it makes wine that contains strychnos; and this is better than water alone in resolving the inflation.
Cum ergo uides inflationem iam resolui, tunc humecta intestinum cum aqua in qua decocta est altea, aut malua.	 When you see that the inflation has already been resolved, then moisten the intestine with water in which asphodel or mallow was boiled.
Nam per illud alleuiatur introitus eius cum re parua.	 For this reason, the entrance is anaesthetized with it when the wound is small.
Si autem excusatur reditus eius post hanc curationem, tunc finde in disruptione parum, cum instrumento quo secantur hemorrhoides.	 If however the return of it occurs after this treatment, then sew up the rupture with a tool used to cut hemorrhoids.
Et curatio prima est melior quando praeparatur, quam sectio: et non fit coactio ad secandum post necessitatem et defectum instrumenti.	 And the first treatment is better when it is prepared than when it is cut; and there should not be a forced action to cut when necessary and lack of tools.
Sit pars eius una quae est torta, acuta, et pars eius altera non acuta, et extremitas subtilis non sit cum subtilitate Spatumilis, imo sit obtusior parumper: et est illa quae similatur caiada, sicut uides.	 Let one part of it be twisted, sharp, and another part not sharp, and the tip should not be fine with the fineness of a spatula, but rather somewhat blunt; and this is like a scabbard, as you see.
Cum ergo amplificatur uulnus, et ingreditur intestinum, tunc oportet, ut sit reductio eius secundum formam suam naturalem in loco suo sibi proprio, si possibile est super illud: quoniam est melius.	 When a wound is extended and enters the bowel, then it should be reduced to its natural shape at its proper place, if possible on top of it: because it is better.
Quando uero disruptio est ampla in inferiori parte uentris: tunc oportet ut facias iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et pone crura sua altiora capite suo.	 When the wound is wide at the lower part of the belly: then it should be made to lie on its back, and place the legs higher than the head.
Et si est in superiore parte uentris, tunc pone caput eius, et pectus ipsius altiora quam eius inferiora.	 And if it is at the upper part of the belly, then raise its head and chest higher than its lower parts.
Et similiter si est disruptio in una duarum partium uentris, tunc pone intentionem tuam, et tuam considerationem semper in hoc, ut pars in qua est uulnus sit altior parte altera.	 And similarly if the wound is on one of two parts of the belly, then direct your attention and consider always that the part with the wound should be higher than the other part.
Et ita oportet, ut admimistres illud in uulneribus magnis, et in uulneribus mediis.	 In this way it is necessary to introduce this into large wounds and medium-sized wounds.
In uulneribus autem paruis, pone illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	 And in small wounds place it according to what you are prepared for.
Deinde fac ut sit praesens inter manus tuas minister pius, qui teneat disruptionem totam manu sua: et aggrega labia eius.	 Then make the devoted servant be present between your hands who holds the whole wound with his hand and press its lips together.
Deinde detege ex ea ei qui sequitur suturam aliquid post aliquid: et iste est modus suturae communis unius.	 Then take something from that which follows to bind, this is the common method of sewing one part.
Et est, ut accipias acum, aut numerum acuum secundum quantitatem amplitudinis uulneris.	 And it is to take a needle or the number of needles according to the size of the wound.
Deinde dimitte ab extremitate disruptionis quantitatem digiti anularis, id est, medici: et fige acum unam praeter quod intromittas in eam filum in duabus extremitatibuis cutis, cum duabus extremitatibus sifac quod est sub cute ab interioribus, donec facias eam penetrare ab alia parte, et tu iam aggregasti duas extremitates cutis, et duas extremitates sifac: et fiunt quatuor ordines.	 Then remove from the end of the wound a finger's breadth, that is, of the doctor; and sew the needle one time into the skin at both ends, with the ends of the sinew that is beneath the skin from inside, until you make it penetrate from the other side, and by this time you have joined the two edges of the skin and the two ends of the sinew; and four rows are made.
Deinde stringe cum filo duplo in circumitu acus aliquotiens a duabus partibus simul, quousque sint aggregata duo labia uulneris aggregatione decenti.	 Then sew with double thread around the needle several times at both sides together until the lips of the wound are joined by appropriate stitching.
Deinde dimitte grossitudinem digiti etiam, et fige in eis acum aliam: postea reta eam cum filo, sicut fecisti cum acu prima.	 Then release the thickness of the digit and also tie another thread: afterwards straighten it with thread, as you did with the first thread.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum eo quo indiges ex acubus, donec compleas constrictionem uulneris totius.	 Do not cease to do that with the necessary needles until you complete the closure of the whole wound.
Et sint acus mediae inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem: quoniam acus subtiles ualde uelociter incidunt carnem: et grossae sunt difficilis introitus in cutem: propter illud oportet ut sint mediae in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	 Let the needles be of a medium size between thickness and delicacy; because fine needles easily pierce the flesh, and thick ones have difficulty entering the skin; therefore, it is necessary for them to be medium in delicacy and thickness.
Et non oportet, ut figatur acus in duabus extremitatibus cutis propinquae multum: ut non incidatur caro uelociter, et aperiatur uulnus ante consolidationem sui, et non elongentur etiam cum sutura, ut non prohibeatur uulnus a consolidatione.	 And it is not appropriate that the needle should be folded at both ends of the skin close by; so as not to pierce the flesh quickly and open the wound before its consolidation, nor lengthen even when sewing, so as not to prevent the consolidation of the wound.
Deinde incide extremitatem acuum, ut non laedant infirmum apud somnum suum: et pone eis puluillos ex pannis ab omni parte, qui teneant extremitates acuum: et dimitte eos, donec scias quod uulnus iam consolidatum est.	 Then cut the end of the needle so as not to injure the weak person in his sleep; and place small pieces of cloth from all sides around its ends, which hold the end of the needle; and release them when you know that the wound is already consolidated.
Et haec quidem species suturae cum acubus taliter est conuenientior in uulneribus paruis.	 And this kind of sewing with needles in such a way is more suitable for small wounds.
Quoniam sufficit in sutura eorum acus una, aut duae, aut circiter eas.	 Because only one needle or two, or about that number, are sufficient for sewing them.
Sutura autem secunda communis est, ut aggreges cum sutura extremitates quatuor: extremitates, duas cutis, et extremitates duas sifac in uice una, cum acu in qua sit filum inuolutum aequale in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	 The second sewing is common, to join together the ends of four with sewing; the four ends, two of skin and two of sifac in place of one, with a needle in which there is thread wound equally in delicacy and thickness.
Deinde quando penetraueris cum acu has extremitates quatuor, reduc acum a parte a qua incaepisti eadem, ut cadat filum retatum a superiori parte uulneris: ut sit sutura, sicut sutura panni quo stringuntur panni, et pone inter omnem suturam quantitatem grossitudinis digiti minoris.	 Then, when you penetrate with the needle these four ends, draw back the needle from the side where you entered so that the thread falls down from the upper part of the wound; so that it is sewing as sewing of cloth when they fasten cloth, and place between every stitch a quantity equal to the thickness of a little finger.
Hanc autem suturam sciunt homines.	 Men know this suture.
Et cum hac sutura ego sui uulnus quod acciderat uiro in uentre suo, qui fuerat uulneratus cum cultello, et erat disruptio uulneris maior palmo uno: et exierat ex intestinis circiter duos palmos ex intestino medio, et erat disruptio in medio uentris.	 And with this suture, I stitched the wound that had happened to a man in his abdomen, who was wounded with a knife, and the wound's breakage was greater than one palm; and about two palms of intestines had come out from the middle intestine, and there was a rupture in the middle stomach.
Reduxi ergo illud postquam stetit intestinum eius extra uulnus xxiiii horis.	 I therefore returned it after the intestine stayed outside the wound for 24 hours.
Consolidatum est ergo uulnus in spacio quod fuit circiter XV dies: et curaui ipsum, et sanatus est: et uixit post illud annis multis, conuersatus in suis dispositionibus.	 The wound was therefore healed in the space that was about 15 days; and I cured it, and it got well; and he lived after that for many years, converted to his own ways.
Et medici iudicauerant, quod non sanaretur.	 And the physicians had judged that it would not get well.
Et ex miraculo fuit, quod non curaui illud cum unguento.	 And by a miracle, I did not cure it with ointment.
Quoniam fui in loco in quo non inueniebatur unguentum, neque aliquid ex medicinis.	 Because I was in a place where no ointment was found, nor anything from the medicines.
Posui ergo super uulnus cotum uetustum bis in die, et assiduaui ablutionem eius cum aqua mellis, donec sanatum est.	 I therefore put old bread twice a day on the wound, and I attended to its cleansing with water of honey until it got well.
Duas autem species suturae proprias dicam secundum narrationem sermonis.	 I will now speak about two types of sutures according to the report of the speech.
Et est, ut incipias cum sutura acuta: et intromittas acum ab exteriori ad interiorem partem.	 And it starts with a sharp suture: and you insert the needle from the outside to the inside part.
Cum ergo penetrat acus in cutem, et in lacertum euntem secundum longitudinem et latitudinem totius corporis: dimitte extremitatem sifac in latere in quo intromisisti acum, et fac penetrare in extremitatem aliam ab interiori parte ad exteriorem in extremitate altera mirach.	 When the needle goes through the skin and advances according to the length and width of the entire body: release the end of the suture on the side where you inserted the needle, and make it penetrate to the end of another from the inside to the outside at the opposite extreme.
Cum ergo feceris eam penetrare, tunc fac eam penetrare secundum hoc in eadem hac extremitate mirach ab exteriori parte ad interiorem: et dimitte extremitatem sifac, quae est in hoc latere, et fac penetrare acum in extremitatem alteram ab interiori parte ad exteriorem: et fac penetrare cum penetratione tua qua facis eam penetrare in sifac extremitate mirach, quae est in parte eius, donec penetret in ipsum totum.	 When you make it penetrate as described above on the same side, then make it penetrate from the outside to the inside at the same end: release the end of the suture, which is on this side, and make the needle penetrate to the end on the other side from the inside to the outside; and make it penetrate together with your penetration that you make it penetrate in the suture end, which is at this part, until it goes through entirely.
Deinde incipe etiam ab hoc eodem latere, et sue ipsum cum extremitate, quae est ex sifac in latere alio, et extrahe acum ex cute quam penetrauit.	 Then also start from the same side, and take it along with its extremity which is on the other side of sifac, and draw out the point that has penetrated the skin.
Deinde reduc eam in illam cutem, et sue extremitatem sifac, quae est in latere alio, cum hac extremitate mirach: et extrahe eam ex cute quae est ex parte eius, et fac illud uice una, et alia: et fac illud uice post uicem, usquequo suas extrinsecum totum secundum illud exemplum.	 Then return it to the same skin, and take sifac's extremity on the other side with this extremity of mirach; draw it out from the skin that is on its part, and do the same for both sides; then do it again after the first time, until you withdraw all of it according to the example given.
Et summa huius suturae, est ut suas sutura pellipariorum qua suunt pelles: ita ut suas sifac uice una ex parte una extremitate cutis: et ut dimittas eam uice alia ex parte alia, donec compleas.	 The sum of this suture is that the skin of sutures should be smoother than the skins; so that you close sifac with one part of the skin's extremity, and release it with another part from the other side until you complete it.
Secunda species suturae propriae, quam dixit Gale nus.	 The second type of suture proper, as Galen said.
Iste eius sermo narratus est, ut suas eam secundum similitudinem, qua suunt eas quidam medicantium, ita quod aggregant omnem partem ad comparem suam conuenientem per naturam: et applicant extremitatem sifac ad eius aliam extremitatem, et extremitatem mirach ad extremitatem eius aliam.	 This speech is told in a way similar to those who heal, so that they gather all parts together which naturally fit by themselves; and apply the extremity of sifac to its other extremity, and the extremity of mirach to another one of its extremities.
Et illud fit secundum quod narro tibi.	 And this is done as I am telling you.
Oportet ut figas acum in extremitatem mirach propinquam tibi ab exteriori parte, et facias eam penetrare ad interiorem in eo solo: et dimittas duas extremitates sifac.	 You must place the point on the extremity of mirach close to you from the outside part, and make it penetrate to the inside only; then release both extremities of sifac.
Deinde reuolue acum, et fac eam penetrare ab exteriori parte ad interiorem in duas extremitates sifac, scilicet utrinque.	 Then turn the point and make it penetrate from the outside to the inside in both sides of sifac.
Deinde reuolue utrasque, etiam fac penetrare utrasque ab interiori usque ad exteriorem, in duas extremitates mirach alias, quae sunt in latere opposito.	 Then turn both sides and make both penetrate from the inside to the outside, in the two extremities of mirach which are on the opposite side.
Et iste modus suturae est melior sutura communi facili, et est sutura cuius praecessit rememoratio.	 And this method of suture is better than the common and easy one, and it is the suture whose previous reminder has been given.
Iste est ergo sermo Galeni etiam.	 This is therefore a saying (or discourse) of Galen as well.
Et dixerunt quidam.	 And they said something.
Retificatur sutura uentris cum duabus acubus.	 The stitching of the abdomen should be made with two needles (or points).
Quod est, ut intromittas in eis utrisque filum unum: et incipe cum intromissione acus, ex eo quod est apud te, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, secundum suturam eorum qui suunt coria aequaliter.	 That is, so that you insert one thread into each of them (the abdomen): and begin with the introduction of the needle, from what is at hand with you, and make it pass through to the other side according to the stitching of those who sew hide equally.
Et scias, quod quando disruptio est in medio uentris: tunc sutura eius est difficilior quam reliquorum locorum uentris.	 And know that when the rupture (or tear) is in the middle of the abdomen: then the stitching of it is more difficult than the rest of the places in the abdomen.
Iudicium uero medicationis uulneris, est iudicium reliquorum uulnerum.	 The judgment (or decision) of the dressing of a wound is the judgment of other wounds as well.
Quod est, quia quando tu consequeris uulnus recens cum sanguine suo, antequam alteret ipsum aer: et reducis intestinum, et suis ipsum, et aptas ipsum: tunc pone super puluerem incarnatiuum.	 That is, because when you will conquer a fresh wound with its own blood before it becomes altered by the air: and you reduce (or put back) the intestine, and close (or suture) the wound itself, then place it on a powder of ashes.
Quod si aer iam alterauit uulnus: tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, quae sunt tibi praesentia, donec faciant pus: et cadant fila, et consolidentur sifac, et mirach.	 If the air has already altered the wound: then place some unguents on it that are present with you, so that they cause pus: and let threads fall and settle, and bandage (or wrap) it with linen cloth and mullein leaves.
Deinde cura illud sicut est curatio reliquorum uulnerum, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of that in the same way as the treatment of other wounds until it is healed.
Si autem non sunt tibi praesentes medicinae, tunc pone super ipsum statim, exquo incipit emittere pus, cotum uetus: et permuta ipsum bis in die, sicut docui te, donec sanetur.	 If there are no remedies present with you: then immediately place on it a warm old cloth: and change it twice a day as I have taught you until it is healed.
Nam tu non indiges medicatione alia in pluribus dispositionibus, quando uulnera sunt simplicia.	 For you do not need any other remedy in more complicated situations: when the wounds are simple.
Si autem times, quod communicet uulnus membris principalibus in laesione, tunc oportet ut submergas lanam lenem in oleo temperatae caliditatis, aut in oleo rosato: et pone ipsam in circumitu locorum quae sunt inter inguina, et sub ascellas.	 If you fear that the wound communicates with the main limbs due to injury: then it is necessary that you immerse a warm wool in oil tempered to a moderate heat, or in rose oil: and place it in the surrounding area of places that are between the groin, and under the armpits.
Quod si sentit dolorem, aut punctiones, aut putrefactionem in intestinis suis (nam multotiens accidit illud) tunc clisteriza ipsum cum uino stiptico, nigro, tepido: praecipue si putredo iam peruenit in intestino, et facta est exitura penetrans usque ad concauitatem eius.	 If he feels pain or punctures or putrefaction in his intestines (for this often occurs), then clisterize him with warm, black, stirrup wine: particularly if the putrefaction has already reached the intestine and an exit has been made penetrating to its concavity.
Et scias, quod illud quod est ex intestino grosso, est facilioris sanationis: et quod ex eis est ex subtili, difficilioris sanationis.	 And know that what is from the large intestine is easier to heal, and what is from the small intestine is more difficult to heal.
Intestinum autem quod nominatur Ieiunum, non suscipit sanationem ex uulnere quod accidit in eo omnino: et illud est propter multitudinem eius, quod est ex uenis, et magnitudine earum, et propter subtilitatem corporis eius, et propinquitatem ipsius naturae neruorum.	 The intestine that is called the Jejunum does not accept healing from a wound that occurs in it at all: and this is because of its multitude, which is from veins, and their size, and because of the subtlety of its body, and because of the proximity of its nature to nerves.
Si autem illud quod procedit ex uulnere est zirbum, et consequeris ipsum recens: reduc ipsum secundum reductionem tuam, qua reducis intestina aequaliter.	 If what proceeds from the wound is pus and you take it fresh: lead it back as you lead the intestines equally.
Si uero praeteriit ei spacium, et iam factum est uiride, aut nigrum: tunc oportet ut stringas ipsum cum filo supra locum qui denigratus est ex eo, ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 But if time has passed and it has become green or black: then you must tie it with thread above the place that has been darkened from it, so that blood flow does not occur.
In zirbo enim sunt uenae et arteriae.	 For in pus there are veins and arteries.
Deinde incide quod est praeter illud ligamentum, et pone duas extremitates fili pendentes ex inferiori parte uulneris extra ipsum: ut alleuietur super te attractio eius, et extractio ipsius apud casum zirbi, et emissionem pus uulneris.	 Then cut what is beyond that ligament and place two ends of thread hanging from the lower part of the wound outside it: so as to relieve you from its attraction towards you and the extraction of the pus at the site of the wound, and the emission of pus from the wound.
¶ Rememoratio uulneris quod accidit in Intestino.	 Reminder of a wound that occurs in the Intestine.
Quando accidit disruptio in Intestino, et est parua: tunc possibile est, ut restauretur in quibusdam hominibus: propterea, quia ego uidi qui fuit uulneratus in uentre suo cum percussione lanceae, et erat uulnus a dextra stomachi, et antiquatum est uulnus: et factum Fistula, et exiuit ex eo egestio, et uentositas.	 When there is a rupture in the Intestine and it is small: then it is possible for some people to be restored: because I have seen one who was wounded in his abdomen with a spear strike, and the wound was on the right side of the stomach, and the wound was old: and a fistula was made, and excrement and gases came out of it.
Posui ergo curationem, usque quod ego non fui confisus in sanatione eius: neque cessaui subtiliare ipsum, donec sanatus est, et consolidatus est locus.	 I therefore administered treatment, until I was not confident in its healing; neither did I cease to investigate it, until it was healed and the place was consolidated.
Postquam ego uidi locum iam consolidatum, timui super infirmum, quod accideret super infirmum accidens malum in uentre suo: et non accidit ei ex illo accidens malum.	 When I saw the place already consolidated, I feared an accident happening to the sick man, that an accidental evil might occur in his stomach; and it did not happen to him from that accidental evil.
Et remansit in melioribus dispositionibus suis, comedens et bibens, et futuens, et intrauit balneum, et exercitatus est in dietis suis.	 And he remained in better conditions for himself, eating and drinking, urinating and defecating, and entering the bath, and exercising in his own regimen.
Et iam dixerunt quidam experimentatorum, quia quando accidit in Intestino uulnus, et est paruum: tunc oportet ut ligetur secundum hunc modum.	 And some of the experimenters said that when a wound occurs in the intestine and it is small, then it should be tied according to this method.
Et est, ut accipias formicas magnorum capitum.	 It is, to receive large-headed ants.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, et pone formicam unam ex eis quae habeant os apertum super duo labia uulneris.	 Then join two lips of the wound, and place one ant with an open mouth on top of the two lips of the wound.
Cum ergo capit super ea, et stringit os suum, abscinde caput eius, adhaeret enim, et non soluitur.	 When its head is on top of them, and it closes its mouth, cut off its head, for it will stick, and it will not be loosened.
Deinde pone formicam aliam prope primam, et non cesses facere illud cum formica post formicam secundum quantitatem uulneris totius.	 Then place another ant next to the first, and do not cease doing that with an ant according to the quantity of the wound in its entirety.
Deinde reduc ipsum, et sue uulnus.	 Then reduce it, and close the wound.
Illa enim capita remanent annexa in Intestino, donec cibetur Intestinum, et sanetur, et non accidat infirmo nocumentum penitus.	 For those heads remain attached to the intestine until it is eaten, and healed, and no harm occurs to the sick man in his entirety.
Et iam possibile est, ut ligetur Intestinum etiam cum filo subtili: quod abstersum est ex intestino animalis, annexo cum eo postquam intromittitur in acum.	 And it is now possible to tie the intestine even with a thin thread; which I removed from the animal's intestine, attached to it when introduced into the point.
Et est, ut accipias extremitatem huius fili ex intestino, et excarnetur multum.	 It is, to take the end of this thread from the intestine and remove much of the flesh.
Deinde liga in extremitate eius filum lini subtile inuolutum.	 Then tie a thin linen thread at the end of it.
Deinde intromitte illud filum in acum, et sue cum eo intestinum.	 Then insert that thread into the point, and suck out the intestine with it.
Deinde reduc ipsum in disruptionem.	 Then lead it back to the incision.
Et iste modus suturae cum formicis et intestino, non est nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	 And this method of suture with worms and intestine is not except by way of trust and hope.
Scias, uulnus quod est magnum, amplum, praecipue si est in uno intestinorum gracilium: tunc non est ingenium nisi subtiliatio, neque est eius sanatio omnino.	 Know that a large wound, wide, especially if it is on one of the slender intestines: then there is no artistry except refinement, nor is its healing altogether.
¶ De cura Zuchemen, et Fistularum.	 § On the care of the rectum, and fistulas.
Caput LXXXVIII.	 Chapter LXXXVIII.
Scias, quod omne uulnus, aut apostema quando ueterascit et antiquatur, et fit ulcus, et non consolidatur, et emittit pus semper, et non abscinditur: tunc nominatur uniuersaliter in quocunque membro fuerit Fistula, et nos nominamus ipsum Zuchemen.	 Know that every wound or boil when it becomes old and hardens and turns into an ulcer and does not consolidate and always emits pus and is not cut off: then it is called universally in whatever member it may be a fistula, and we call it the rectum.
Et Fistula quidem est secundum ueritatem nodatio filtrata, dura, alba: cum qua non est dolor, cui est concauitas pennae auis: et propter illud nominant eam quidam Risati, id est, pennam.	 And a fistula indeed is according to the truth a filtered knot, hard and white: with which there is no pain, which has a hollow of a bird's feather: and for this reason some call it Rata, that is, feather.
Et est in quibusdam horis humida, quae emittit pus.	 And it is sometimes moist, which emits pus.
Et fortasse scinditur humiditas in quibusdam horis.	 And perhaps moisture is cut off in some hours.
Et quandoque est haec humiditas multa, et est pauca: et est grossa, et est subtilis.	 And sometimes this moisture is much and is little; and it is thick and is refined.
Et ego iam praemisi in diuisione, tunc cum dixi uulnera, quod omne ulcus quod non sanatur, neque nascitur in eo caro, non est illud nisi propter unam nouem caussarum.	 And I have already said in the division, when I spoke of wounds, that every ulcer which does not heal and is not born in it flesh, is not this because of one of nine causes.
Quarum una est, aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore: aut propter maliciam eius: aut quoniam inter ipsum, et super labia eius est caro dura, prohibens natiuitatem carnis: aut quia est multae sordis et sordiciei: aut quoniam ulcus in seipso est putridum, et materia quae mittitur ei est malae qualitatis: aut quoniam medicina est inconueniens in curatione eius: aut quoniam corruptio cadens in regione est genus pestilentiae, aut per proprietatem in regione, sicut accidit in Caesaraugusta: in qua fit difficilis digestio aegritudinum, et tardatur in ea sanatio apostematum per naturam: aut quoniam in eo est os unum, aut numerus ossium.	 One of them is because of the scarcity of blood in the body; or because it is bad; or because there is hard flesh between it and its edges, preventing the growth of flesh; or because there are many filths and dirtiness; or because the ulcer itself is putrid, and the matter that is sent to it is of poor quality; or because the medicine is inappropriate for its healing; or because corruption falling in the region is a kind of pestilence, as happens in Caesaraugusta: where digestion of illnesses becomes difficult, and healing of boils is delayed by nature; or because there is one bone or number of bones in it.
Et ego iam ostendi omnes istas caussas et signa earum, et curationes ipsarum cum medicinis in diuisione: et oportet hic ut faciam te scire curationem Fistulae et Zuken, quae fit per uiam operationis cum manu.	 I have now shown you all those causes and their signs, and the treatments of them with medicines in division. Here it is necessary for me to make you know the treatment for a Fistula and a Hernia, which is made through the way of operation by hand.
Scias ergo, quod Fistula accidit in omnibus membris corporis.	 Therefore, you should know that a Fistula occurs in all the members of the body.
Nam ex eis sunt Fistulae quae perueniunt ad uenas magnas et arterias, aut neruos, aut sifac: aut ad intestinum, aut ad uesicam, aut ad aliquam ex costis: aut ad aliquam ex spondilibus dorsi, aut ad aliquam iuncturarum compositarum compositione: sicut manus, et pedis: et ex eis sunt quae uadunt ad propinquitatem membri principalis, et similium.	 For of these are Fistulae which reach the large veins and arteries, or nerves, or bladders; or to the intestine, or to the bladder, or to any of the ribs: or to any of the spine bones, or to any of the joints composed; such as the hands and feet: and of these are those which approach the proximity of the main member, and similar ones.
Quae ergo ex his Fistulis est secundum hunc modum, est ex aegritudinibus difficilis sanationis, et non recipit curationem, et occupatio cum ea est labor et ignorantia.	 Which of these Fistulas is so according to this manner, is difficult for cure, and does not receive treatment, and occupation with it is labor and ignorance.
Quod si est ex Fistulis aliqua cuius profunditas non peruenit ad haec loca quae dixi: et speras, et confidis in curatione eius, et uis peruenire ad cognitionem illius, tunc accipe tentam ex aere, aut ferro, si Fistula tendit secundum rectitudinem, et perquire eam cum ipsa.	 If it is of any Fistulas whose depth does not reach to the places which I said: and you hope, and trust in its cure, and wish to reach the knowledge of it, then take a probe made of brass or iron, if the Fistula tends according to straightness, and explore it with that.
Si autem in Fistula est tortuositas, tunc inuestiga eam cum tenta de plumbo subtili.	 If, however, there is a twisting in the Fistula, then investigate it with a probe made of thin lead.
Quoniam plumbum cum lenitate sui corporis alleuiatur, et curuatur circa tortuositatem.	 Because lead, with its own softness, is softened and bent around the twisting.
Quod si Fistula est habens orificia multa, non est tibi possibile ut significes super eam cum tenta.	 If the Fistula has many openings, it will not be possible for you to indicate over it with a probe.
Clisteriza ergo ex eis orificium ex orificiis suis.	 Clysterize therefore from those openings of its own openings.
Nam humiditas qua clisterizas ipsum, uadit uersus orificia alia, et currit ex eis.	 For moisture which you clysterize with itself goes backwards through the other openings and runs out from them.
Deinde exquisite inquire secundum quem modum est tibi possibile: ut cognoscas quod illic est os, aut neruus, et est Fistulae concauitas longinqua, aut propinqua: aut est Fistula una cui sunt orificia multa, et sta super totum illud, cum summa fortitudinis tuae: cum interrogatione tua, qua interrogas infirmum, et inuentione doloris apud compressionem cum manu tua super locum, et similibus ex significationibus et caussis accidentibus apostemati.	 Then carefully inquire in whatever way is possible for you: so that you may know whether there is a bone or nerve there, and it is a long deep-set fistula or a nearby one: or it is a fistula with multiple openings, which covers the entire area, when you apply your maximum strength: with your questioning of the patient, when you inquire about pain under compression with your hand on the location, and similar signs and causes of inflammation.
Cum ergo steteris super omnia illa statione uera, tunc uade ad curationem secundum confidentiam: et est, ut consideres tunc, si est Fistula propinqua apparens, aut in loco saluo longinquo a iunctura, aut a neruo, aut arteria, aut uena, aut uno locorum quae dixi tibi: tunc seca Fistulam secundum quod praemissum est ex narratione mea, et aufer quod est in ea ex filtratione, et carnibus corruptis, quod nascitur in orificio eius ex carne, aut thelul, et similibus: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 When you have stood over all these things, then proceed to treatment according to your confidence: and it is for you to consider at that time whether the fistula is nearby or appearing in a safe remote location, or near a nerve, artery, vein, or single location as I have mentioned to you: then cut the fistula according to what was previously stated in my account, and remove from it what is present due to filtration, and decayed flesh, which grows in its opening from flesh or membrane, or similar things: and treat it until it heals.
Si autem Fistula est longinquae profunditatis, et est secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut seces eam in profundo quantum est tibi possibile.	 If the fistula is deep-set and straight, then it should be cut as deeply as possible for you.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex omnibus carnibus eius corruptis.	 Then cleanse it from all corrupted flesh of its surroundings.
Deinde administra licinia inuoluta in medicinis acutis: et intromitte ea usque ad concauitatem Fistulae quam comprehendisti cum ferro: fac cum ea illud aliquotiens, donec corrodat medicina acuta totum quod remansit in concauitate Fistulae ex corruptione.	 Then apply linen folded in medications that are sharp, and insert it into the depth of the fistula opening that you have grasped with an iron: do this several times until the sharp medication corrodes everything remaining in the depth of the fistula due to decay.
Deinde restaura ipsam cum unguentis quae generant carnem sanam, donec sanetur.	 Then restore it with unguents that generate healthy flesh, until it heals.
Si uero non sanatur per illud, tunc cauteriza ipsam secundum quod narrauimus.	 If it does not heal by this, then cauterize it as I have previously described.
Si ergo caussa Fistulae est os, et certificatur apud te illud: tunc inquire ipsum, et seca ipsum secundum quod narraui tibi: si non prohibet te aliquid ex uena, aut neruo, aut membro principali, sicut diximus.	 If the cause of the fistula is a bone and this is certain to you: then inquire about it and cut the bone as I have told you: if there is nothing preventing you from doing so, according to what we have said, regarding a vein, nerve or major limb.
Si ergo detegitur tibi os, et est in eo quiddam corruptionis, et nigredinis: tunc rade ipsum, donec auferatur corruptio eius tota.	 If therefore a bone is exposed to you and there is something corrupted within it, and blackening: then scrape it, until the entire corruption is removed from it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it with that which cures it, until it heals.
Quod si non sanatur, et emittat pus sicut faciebat: tunc scias, quod tu non peruenisti ad totam eradicationem corruptionis.	 If it does not heal and discharges pus as it was doing: then you will know that you did not achieve complete removal of the corruption.
Detege ergo super illud secundo, et exquisite fac rasionem eius, et mundificationem ipsius cum ultima fortitudine tua.	 Excavate therefore above it again, and seek out its reason, and clean it with the utmost strength of your skill.
Deinde restaura ipsum.	 Then restore it.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est: et si non, tunc scias quod illa corruptio est in profunditate longinqua corporis, quam non es consecutus.	 If it heals, that is good; and if not, then you will know that the corruption is in a distant depth of the body, which you were not able to reach.
Non est ergo tibi in ea ingenium, nisi dimittere ipsam naturae.	 Therefore, it is not your skill in this matter, but rather to let nature take its course.
Quod si corruptum est os paruum, et est possibile tibi, attrahe ipsum cum forficibus subtilibus quae conueniunt ad illud.	 If the small bone is corrupted, and it is possible for you to do so, draw it out with fine forceps suitable for that purpose.
Si autem sunt ossa multa, tunc exquisite fac attractionem eorum omnium, neque dimittas ex eis aliquid cum tua fortitudine.	 If there are many bones, then seek to draw out all of them carefully, without leaving anything behind with your strength.
Si uero contrarietatem facit tibi aliquid ex humiditatibus, et non est in incisione eorum timor, uel error: tunc incide illas humiditates et carnes, si sunt illic, et libera ossa.	 If on the other hand something opposes you from the humidities and there is no fear or mistake in the cuts: then cut those humidities and flesh, if it is there, and free the bones.
Si uero non est tibi praeparatio auferendi ossa ex hora tua, tunc pone super uulnus quod putrefaciat ipsum: et dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat quod est in circumitu illorum ossium ex carnibus et humiditatibus.	 If you do not have the preparation for removing bones from your time, then place over the wound something that will corrupt it; and let it go until it corrupts what is around those bones of flesh and humidities.
Et custodi uulnus ut non consolidetur.	 And keep the wound so that it does not solidify.
Et constringatur sectio quam tu secuisti in operatione tua.	 And the incision which you made during your procedure should be tied up.
Imo pone super ipsum, si times, cotum submersum sulfure trito cum oleo: aut cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio, aut aliquo unguentorum uiridium.	 Or if you fear, place on it a cloth soaked in powdered sulfur with oil; or a cloth soaked in Egyptian ointment, or in some green ointment.
Nam quando putrefient illae scilicet humiditates, et separantur ex eis ossa, alleuiatur ablatio eorum, et ipsorum attractio.	 When those [humidities] namely rot and bones separate from them, let there be an excision of them, and their attraction.
Si autem est os unum magnum, sicut os cruris, aut os coxae, et similia illis, et quod ex eo corruptum est, est pars magna: tunc rade ipsum rasione ultima, donec auferatur illa nigredo et corruptio.	 If there is one large bone, like the thigh bone or hip bone and similar to them, and what has been corrupted from it is a large part: then shave it with the final rasp until that blackness and corruption is removed.
Deinde restaura uulnus.	 Then restore the wound.
Si uero quod est in eo corruptum, est pars magna, et corruptio iam consecuta est medullam ossis, tunc necesse est serrare ipsum, et incidere ipsum totum usque ad locum, ubi peruenit corruptio: tunc cura ipsum, donec consolidetur.	 If what is in it has become a large part and corruption of the bone marrow has already occurred, then it is necessary to saw it, and cut it completely to the place where the corruption has reached: then treat it until it heals.
Et ego narro tibi zuken, quae accidit uiro in crure suo: ut ponas ipsam exemplum et adiutorium super operationem tuam.	 And I tell you this sign which happens to a man in his leg: place it as an example and aid for your surgery.
Fuit uir iuuenis aetate circiter triginta annos, cui accidit dolor in crure suo, a caussa quae mota est super ipsum intra corpus, id est, ab interioribus, donec peruenerunt materiae ad crus, et apostematum est apostemate magno: et non fuit ei caussa extrinseca.	 There was a young man about thirty years old who had pain in his leg, which moved upon him from within the body, that is, from inside, until the matter reached his leg and an abscess was opened with a large incision: and there was no external cause for it.
Extensum est ergo cum eo tempus cum errore medicorum, donec apertum est apostema, et concurrerunt cum eo materiae multae.	 Then the time passed with the error of the physicians until the abscess was opened, and many matters gathered around it.
Et postposita est curatio eius, donec fistulatum est crus, et facta sunt in eo orificia multa: quae omnia emittebant pus, et humiditates corporis.	 And the treatment of him was delayed until the leg became fistulous and many openings were made in it: which all emitted pus and humidities of the body.
Curauit ergo ipsum multitudo medicorum circiter duos annos, et non fuit in eo sapiens in arte manus, donec uocatus sum, et uidi crus eius, et materias quae currebant ex illis orificiis cursu magno: etiam omne uiri corpus iam tabuerat, et color eius citrinus erat.	 A multitude of physicians treated him for about two years, and there was no wise man in the art of hand until I was called upon, and saw his leg, and the matters that were flowing out from those openings with a great flow: even the entire body of the man had become gangrenous, and his complexion was jaundiced.
Intromisi ergo tentam in uno locorum orificiorum, et peruenit tenta ad os.	 I inserted my finger into one of the openings and my finger reached a bone.
Deinde perscrutatus sum orificia omnia: et inueni ea peruenire ad se inuicem ex omnibus partibus cruris.	 Then I have examined all the openings and found them to lead into each other from every part of the leg.
Properaui ergo, et secui super unum illorum orificiorum, donec detexi partem ossis: et inueni ipsum corruptum: quod iam corrosum erat, et denigratum, et putruerat, et perforatum erat, donec penetrauerat usque ad medullam.	 I have probed and cut open one of the openings, until I exposed a part of the bone: and I found it corrupted; which had already rotten, decayed, putrefied, and perforated until it penetrated to the marrow.
Serraui ergo quod detectum est mihi, et praeparatum ex osse corrupto.	 Then I have sawed what was exposed to me, and prepared it from the corrupted bone.
Et deputaui, quod non esset in osse nisi illa corruptio, quam abscidi, et serraui.	 And I removed whatever was not bone except that corruption which I cut off and sawed.
Et ego iam eradicaueram eam.	 And now I have extracted it.
Deinde posui restaurationem uulneris cum medicinis consolidatiuis spacio longo.	 Then I placed the healing of the wound with strengthening medicines in a long space.
Et non est consolidatum.	 And it is not healed.
Deinde tentaui, et detexi super os secundo supra detectionem primam: et inueni corruptionem continuam cum osse: et serraui quod apparuit mihi etiam ex illa corruptione.	 Then I tried again and exposed on the second bone above the first exposure: and found continuous corruption with the bone; and sawed what appeared to me also from that corruption.
Deinde conatus sum restaurationem eius.	 And I made an attempt at healing it.
Et non est restauratum.	 And it is not restored.
Detexi ergo super ipsum iterum, et non cessaui incidere os particulatim, et conari restaurationem eius: et non est restauratum, donec incidi ex osse circiter palmum unum, et extraxi illud cum medulla sua.	 Then I exposed it again and did not stop cutting the bone piece by piece and trying to heal it; and it is not restored until I cut from the bone about one palm and extracted that with its marrow.
Deinde restauraui ipsum cum medicinis, et consolidatum est uelociter, et sanatum: et non fuit necessaria haec iteratio in operatione eius, et sectione ipsius, nisi propter dispositionem debilitatis infirmi, et paucitatem tolerantiae eius, et timorem meum super ipsum de morte: quoniam accidebat ei in omnibus horis ex superfluitate euacuationis syncopis mala.	 Then I healed it with medicines and it quickly became consolidated and cured; and this iteration in the operation and section of it was not necessary except for the disposition of the weakness of the patient, and the scarcity of his tolerance, and my fear over him concerning death; because there occurred to him at all hours from excessive evacuation of syncopes bad.
Sanatus est ergo sanatione integra: et nata est in loco ossis caro dura, et bona facta est dispositio in corpore suo, et rediit uirtus eius: et conuersatus est in dispositionibus suis: et non fecit ei contrarietatem in ambulatione nocumentum omnino.	 He was therefore completely cured; and new flesh hard grew at the place of the bone, and good arrangement was made in his body, and his strength returned; and he turned to his dispositions; and no harm at all occurred to him from walking contrary to it.
Si autem os eminens in loco corporis iam fractum est: tunc oportet ut serres ipsum, secundum hunc modum: et est: ut accipias ligamentum, et stringe ipsum in extremitate ossis eminentis: et praecipe alicui, qui extendat ipsum ad sursum: et pone ligamentum aliud ex lana grossius ligamento primo.	 If, however, the protruding bone in the body's location is already fractured: then it is necessary that you grasp it thus: and it is as follows: to take a ligament, and tie it at the end of the protruding bone: and command someone to stretch it upwards: and place another thicker ligament over the first one.
Deinde liga ipsum super carne, quae est suh osse: et extende extremitatem eius, ut trahas carnem ad inferiora: et tu detegis carnem super locum quem uis serrare, ut non laedat Serra carnem.	 Then tie it on the flesh that is next to the bone: and stretch out its end so as to pull the flesh towards lower parts: and expose the flesh over the place where you wish to cut, so that the knife does not hurt the flesh.
Pone lignum, aut tabulam sub osse inferius decenter: quoniam quando facis illud, non prohibetur quin secet carnem corruptam.	 Place a stick or a board under the bone below properly: because when you do that, it is not forbidden to cut corrupted flesh.
Et oportet ut sit Serratura super locum corruptum parumper, ut non sit in concauitate ossis corruptio: et non appareat in apparitione sua sensui, et cogat ad Serraturam sui uice alia.	 And it is necessary that the knife be above the corrupted place a little, so that there is no corruption in the concavity of the bone: and it does not appear to the sense in its vision, and compels another to perform the cutting instead.
Quod si os est corruptum, et non est eminens, imo continuatur pars eius cum parte: et corruptio est in medio eius, aut in parte ipsius: tunc detege carnem ab omnibus partibus totam.	 If the bone is corrupted and not protruding, rather it is continuous with another part, and corruption is in the middle of it or in a part of it: then expose the flesh from all parts completely.
Deinde pone lignum inferius.	 Then place a stick below.
Postea serra illud ex parte prima, ubi est corruptio, donec continuetur Serratura ex parte altera: et sit Serratura secundum longitudinem a corruptione parumper, secundum quod diximus.	 Afterwards cut it from the first part where there is corruption, until the cutting is continuous on the other side: and the knife should be according to the length slightly away from the corruption, as we said.
Quod si corruptio est in iunctura, incide ipsam iuncturam corruptam, et serra os ubi continuatur ex parte altera.	 If corruption is at a joint, cut the corrupted joint itself, and cut the bone where it is continuous on the other side.
Si uero corruptio est in continuatione duarum iuncturarum, tunc non est in ea ingenium nisi abrasio.	 But if corruption is at the continuity of two joints, then there is no skill but abrasion.
Quod si corruptio est in pectine manus, aut in pectine pedis: tunc res in eo est difficilis ualde.	 If corruption is in the beak of the hand or in the beak of the foot: then there is a very difficult matter in that.
Verum oportet, ut inquiras corruptionem qualiter appareat tibi.	 But it is necessary for you to examine how the corruption appears to you.
Et abradas eam, et mundes ipsam secundum quamcunque dispositionem tibi possibile est, et cum quocunque ingenio rectificatur tibi: quando non facit tibi contrarietatem Vena, aut Neruus.	 And file (or remove) it (the lesion), and clean it as well as possible for you, and with whatever skill it is corrected for you: when it does not cause you opposition to the Vein, or Nerve.
Et scias quod incisoria, et Serrae ad incidendum ista ossa sunt multa, secundum situm ossium, et praparationem eorum, et ipsorum grossitudinem, et subtilitatem eorum, et magnitudinem, et paruitatem ipsorum, et duriciem ipsorum, et eorum raritatem.	 And know that many incising (saws) and Serrae for cutting these bones are, according to the position of the bones, their preparation, their thickness, and subtlety, their size and smallness, their hardness, and rarity.
Quapropter oportet, ut praepares omni speciei operationis instrumentum conueniens ad illam operationem.	 Therefore, it is necessary that you prepare every kind of instrument suitable for each operation.
Et scias, quod operationes istae significant tibi super speciem instrumenti quo indiges, quando tecum est studium longum.	 And know that these operations indicate to you the type of instrument that you need, when your study is prolonged.
Et cognitio modorum huius artis, testimonium modorum aegritudinum: tunc enim iam inuenies per teipsum illud quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis ad omnem infirmitatem.	 And the knowledge of the methods of this art is a sign of the nature of diseases; then indeed you will find for yourself what suits it from the instruments for every ailment.
Et ego sum firmans tibi in ultimo huius capituli numerum instrumentorum, quae pones exempla super quae incides, et probationem qua experiaris super alia.	 And I am confirming to you at the end of this chapter the number of instruments, which you will put examples on for what you cut, and a test for what you try on others.
Forma Serrae.	 The shape of the saw.
Forma alterius Serrae.	 The form of another saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	 The form of another saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	 The form of another saw.
Haec forma Serrae depicta, sit decenter facta.	 This saw shape should be correctly made.
Fiat arcus eius superior, acuitas eius ex ferro: et manubrium eius ex buxo, et sit pyramidale decenter factum.	 Make the curve of this saw superior and its cutting edge from iron; and its handle from boxwood, and it should be correctly made pyramidal.
Forma Rasorii iuncturarum.	 The shape of a rasp for joints.
Sit caput huius Rasorii, secundum formam capitis claui stellati: et puncta eius sint secundum formam punctorum elischetfegi.	 The head of this rasp should be in the shape of a star key head; and its points should be in the shape of the points of an escarbuncle chisel.
Et non conuenit, nisi ut fricentur cum eo capita iuncturarum, quando corrumpuntur, aut os amplum, et magnum est.	 It is not suitable unless it scrapes the heads of joints when they are broken, or a large and thick bone.
Forma maioris Rasorii.	 Form for a larger razor.
Forma medii Rasorii.	 Form for a medium-sized razor.
Forma Rasorii lati.	 Form for a wide razor.
Forma Rasorii in quo est concauitas.	 Form for a razor with a hollowed out center.
Forma Rasorii alterius subtilis.	 Form for another fine razor.
Forma Rasorii alterius curuatae extremitatis.	 Form for a razor with a curved end.
Forma Rasorii parui, subtilis tentae.	 Form for a small, fine, and flexible razor.
Forma Rasorii cum quo inciduntur ossa.	 Form for a saw-like razor with which bones are cut.
Forma etiam Rasorii magni.	 Also the form of a large razor.
Hoc similatur Radio, et extremitas est sicut Serra: exhibetur in locis multis ex rasione ossium.	 This resembles a saw and its end is like a chisel; it is used in many places for bone cutting reasons.
Forma Rasorii quod conuenit ad rasionem eius quod perforatum est ex ossibus.	 Form for the razor that fits for the purpose of perforating bones.
Extremitas eius triangula, acutarum est extremitatum.	 Its end is triangular and sharp-edged.
Fit ex Indi.	 It is made from India.
Et similiter oportet, ut fiant omnia quae diximus ex Rasoriis, et Incisoriis, et Serris.	 And similarly, everything that I have mentioned should be made of razors, knives and saws.
¶ De incisione extremitatum, et Serratura ossium.	 Section on the incision of extremities and the sawing of bones.
Caput LXXXIX.	 Chapter LXXXIX.
Putrefiunt extremitates, aut ex caussa extrinseca, aut intrinseca.	 Decay occurs at the extremities, either from an external cause or an internal one.
Cum ergo medicatus fueris illam corruptionem curatione medicinarum, et non confert curatio: et uides corruptionem incidere in membrum, quam non repercutit aliquid: tunc oportet ut incidas illud membrum usque ubi consequitu corruptio, ut euadat infirmus per illud a morte, aut a malicia quae est maior defectu membri.	 When you are treated for that corruption with medicinal remedies and it does not improve, and you see the corruption advancing into a limb which is not affected by anything else: then it is necessary to amputate that limb up to where the corruption extends so that the weak one may pass through it from death or from the malice which is greater than the defect of the limb.
Et signum cui accidit illud est, quod denigratur membrum, donec putetur: quod ignis combussit ipsum, aut putrefit post nigredinem: donec inciditur illa putredo usque ad illud quod sequitur illud membrum, et serpit in totum corpus.	 And the sign that occurs is that the limb darkens until it seems as if it has been burnt, or else it becomes corrupt after turning black: until the corruption extends to that which follows the limb and creeps over the entire body.
Propera ergo cum incisione eius, et similiter si caussa corruptionis est a percussione quorundam uenenosorum: sicut scorpionis marini, et uiperae, et rutellae, et similium.	 Approach then with the incision, and similarly if the cause of the corruption is from the sting of certain venomous creatures: such as the marine scorpion, viper, weasel, or similar ones.
Si ergo corruptio, aut percussio est in extremitate digiti, tunc incide digitum, et non des spacium corruptioni, ut incedat usque ad reliquam manum.	 If the corruption, or the wound, is at the extremity of a finger, then amputate the finger, and do not leave room for the corruption to spread, so that it may not advance to the rest of the hand.
Et similiter si accidit in manu, tunc incide eam ex radice focilis, et non des spacium corruptioni, donec capiat in focili brachii.	 And similarly if it occurs in the hand, then amputate from the root of the wrist, and do not leave room for the corruption to spread, until it takes hold in the arm.
Et si inuadit in eo, tunc incide brachium apud cubitum in iunctura sua.	 And if it advances to the elbow joint, then amputate the arm at the elbow joint.
Si autem pertransit corruptio, et uides eum circiter cubitum: tunc in illo est mors infirmi.	 If, however, the corruption passes beyond the elbow and you see it as such: then death is imminent for the weak one.
Et administrare praeter illud ex curatione, est quantitas uirtus.	 And whatever is administered after that for treatment, is the measure of its power.
Et similiter fac de pede, quando inuadit corruptio in digito, tunc incide ipsum apud unum nodorum: et si capit in pectine pedis, tunc incide pedem totum.	 And similarly do the same with the foot, when corruption advances to a toe: then amputate it at one joint; and if it takes hold in the front part of the foot, then amputate the entire foot.
Si autem ascendit ad genu, tunc incide crus apud iuncturam genu.	If it rises to the knee, then cut the leg at the joint of the knee.
Quod si corruptio iam peruenit supra genu, tunc non est in ea ingenium, nisi dimissio, et relinquere infirmum morti.	 If corruption has already reached the knee, then there is no skill in that case except for release and leaving the weak to death.
Et modus incidendi membrum, aut serrandi ipsum est, ut stringas ligamentum in inferiori, quem uis incidere: et stringe ligamentum aliud supra locum.	 The method of cutting a limb or sewing it is to tighten the ligament below where you wish to cut and tighten another ligament above the place.
Et extendat minister ligamentum unum ad inferiora: et extendat minister aliud ligamentum superius ad sursum.	 And extend one minister (assistant) to the lower parts, and extend another minister to the upper parts.
Et tu separa carnem quae est inter duo ligamenta, cum Spatumili lato, donec detegatur caro tota.	 And you separate the flesh that is between the two ligaments, with a wide spatula, until the entire flesh is exposed.
Deinde incidatur, aut serretur.	 Then it is cut or sewn.
Et oportet, ut ponas ab omnibus partibus pannum lini, et non tangat Serra locum sanum: et accidat infirmo laesio addita, et apostema calidum.	 It is necessary that you place a linen cloth on all parts and the saw not touch a healthy place; and it should happen that an additional injury occurs to the weak and a hot abscess.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis interius dum operaris, tunc cauteriza locum uelociter: aut pone super ipsum quosdam pulueres abscindentes sanguinem.	 If bleeding occurs internally while you are operating, then cauterize the place quickly or place some absorbing powders on top of it to stop the bleeding.
Deinde redi ad medicationem tuam, donec compleatur.	 Then return to your treatment until it is completed.
Deinde liga membrum uulneratum cum ligamento conueniente ei, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then bind the wounded limb with a suitable ligament and care for it until it heals.
Et ego narro tibi quod accidit uiro in pede suo, hoc idem accidens quod narro tibi.	 And I tell you what happens to a man on his foot; the same thing happens that I told you.
Quod est, quia accidit in pede suo nigredo, cum adustione quae assimilatur combustioni ignis: et corruptio illa in primis accidit in digito suo, donec coepit pedem totum.	 What happened was that there is a blackening on his foot, with a burning similar to fire burning; and the corruption begins first in his toe until it spreads throughout the entire foot.
Properauit ergo uir ex seipso, postquam uidit corruptionem incidere in membro cum uehementia eius, quod inuenit ex dolore, et adustione eius: et incidit ipsum apud iuncturam, et sanatus est.	 Therefore the man, seeing the corruption spread in his limb with great pain, which he found from the pain and burning; and he cut it at the joint and was cured.
Et postquam praeteriit ei tempus longum, accidit ei illa eadem corruptio in digito manus suae indice.	 And after a long time had passed, the same corruption occurred in the index finger of his own hand.
Venit ergo ad me, et conatus sum recuperare illam superfluitatem cum eo quod posui super manum ex medicinis post mundificationem corporis eius: et non repercussa est superfluitas, et coepit incedere in digitum alium: donec coepit coruptio in manum.	 Therefore he came to me, and I attempted to regain the excess with what I had placed on his hand from medicines after the cleansing of his body; but the excess was not found, and it began to progress to another finger: until corruption started in the hand.
Vocauit ergo me, ad incidendum manum eius: et nolui illud, sperans ex me super repercussionem illius superfluitatis: et timui etiam super ipsum apud incisionem manus eius mortem.	 He called me to cut his hand; but I did not want it, hoping for a recovery of the excess from my side; and I also feared death itself in cutting his hand.
Quoniam uirtus uiri erat super casum.	 Because the man's strength was above his fall.
Postquam ergo desperauit de me, reuersus est ad terram suam: et peruenit ad me de eo, quia properauit, et incidit manum suam totam: et sanatus est.	 After he had given up hope in me, he returned to his own land; and he came back to me concerning him, because he rushed, and cut off all his hand; and he was healed.
Et non attuli hanc narrationem, nisi ut sit adiutorium super illud quod cadit de genere huius aegritudinis: et ut sit significatio qua significetur, et secundum quam agatur.	 I did not bring this story except as help for that which falls under the genus of this illness; and as a signification of what is to be understood, and according to how it should be done.
¶ De cura Sinuum, et qualitate clisterizationis cum medicinis.	 Chapter on the care of sinuses, and the quality of cleansing with medicines.
Caput XC.	 Chapter XC.
Quando accidit apostema in quibusdam membris carnosis, et prolongatur spacium apostematis, donec collectionem facit saniei: deinde rumpitur, aut perforatur, et egreditur quod in eo est ex sanie, et remanet locus uacuus quasi sit uas: et cutis quae est super ipsum sicut pannus qui iam subtiliatus est: et non peruenit ad ultimum in corruptione sua, neque imprimit in os, neque in neruum, neque in ligamentum: meretur ut nominetur Sinus: et non nominatur Fistula: uerumtamen si prolongatur spacium eius, donec imprimat corruptio in aliquid horum membrorum, tunc nominatur Fistula, aut zuken.	 When a boil occurs in some fleshly members and the space of the boil extends until it collects pus; then it bursts or perforates and what is inside the boil comes out along with the pus, leaving a void place as if it were a vessel; and the skin that is over it like a cloth that has been worn away; and it does not reach ultimate corruption, nor presses into bone, nor into nerve, nor into ligament: it deserves to be called Sinus; and it is not called Fistula: however, if the space of it extends until corruption presses into one of these members, then it is called Fistula or zukan.
Et cura eius est, ut incidas illam cutem totam sicut reuoluitur: et praecipue quando subtiliata est, et facta sicut pannus: et confidis quia non aaehaeret cum loco, propter corruptionem suam.	 And its care is that you cut the entire skin as it is rolled; and especially when it has been worn away and become like cloth; and trust that it will not adhere to the place due to its corruption.
Si autem speras quod adhaereat cutis, et non consequitur ex eo corruptio illa ultima consecutione: et si in cute est spissitudo ex carne, tunc cura ipsum cum Clisteri: et est, ut consideres ad Sinum.	 If however you suspect that it adheres to the skin, and this does not follow from its subsequent corruption: and if there is thickening in the skin from flesh, then treat it with Clisterium; and it is to be considered towards the Sinus.
Tunc si est magnus, et pus quod emittitur ex eo est foetidi odoris: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum medicamine aegyptio, quod est aceti, et olei, et ziniar, partes recipiens aequales, aggregentur in uase: et decoquantur super ignem, donec rubeat medicamen: et ueniat in spissitudinem mellis.	 If it is large and the pus that comes out of it has a foul smell: then clisterize it with Egyptian medicine, which is vinegar, oil, and zinnia (mastic) mixed in equal parts, put them together in a vessel; boil over fire until the medicine turns red; and let it reach the consistency of honey.
Deinde accipe ex eo quod tibi necesse est: et dissolue ipsum cum aqua et melle, et clisteriza cum eo Sinum: et stringe orificium eius, et dimitte medicinam in eo ad quantitatem duarum horarum.	 Then take from it what you need; dissolve it with water and honey, and clisterize the Sinus with it; tie up its opening and let the medicine remain within for two hours.
Deinde extrahe ipsum cum expressione: fac illud diebus tot, donec mundificetur Sinus, et remoueatur foetor.	 Then remove it by pressing; do this daily until the sinus is cleansed and the foul smell removed.
Et quandoque clisterizatur cum aqua cineris, quando non est tibi praesens hoc medicamen: et est, ut accipias cinerem lignorum uitis, aut cinerem ex lignis ilicis: et proiicias super eam aquam.	 And at times it is to be clisterized with water and ashes, when this medicine is not available; and it is to receive ashes of grape wood or ashes from holly trees; throw water over it.
Deinde cola eam, et clisteriza cum ea, donec confidas quod Sinus iam ablutus est.	 Then boil it and clisterize with it until you believe that the sinus has been cleansed.
Quod si infirmo non est tolerantia super medicamen aegyptium, neque aquam cineris, tunc clisteriza ipsum cum aqua et melle, cui iam permixtum est aliquid ex ziniar contrito.	 If the patient is not able to tolerate Egyptian medicine or water and ashes, then clisterize it with water and honey mixed with some crushed zinnia (mastic).
Aut clisteriza ipsum cum melle et uino permixtis, quoniam de proprietate mellis est, ut mundificet, et abluat: et uinum facit adhaerere Sinum, praecipue quando in uino est superfluitas stipticitatis et siccitatis.	 Or clisterize it with honey and wine mixed together because the property of honey is to cleanse and purify; and wine makes the sinus sticky especially when there is excess thickening and dryness in the wine.
Cum facis illud aliquotiens, et confidis quod Sinus corruptio iam remota est: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum eo quod facit nasci carnem in eo.	 When you do this often and believe that the sinus corruption has been removed: then clisterize it with that which causes flesh to grow therein.
Et est, ut accipias ex emplastro dyafinicon: et dissoluas ipsum cum oleo rosato, et uino stiptico: aut clisteriza ipsum cum quibusdam medicinis, et unguentis aliis, quorum proprietates scripsi in tractatu unguentorum.	 And it is to receive from the plaster dyafinicon: and dissolve it with rose oil, and stiptic wine; or purge it with certain medicines, and with other ointments, whose properties I wrote in the treatise on ointments.
Quod si orificium Sinus est strictum, in quo non capit cannula clisteris: tunc amplifica ipsum cum ferro parumper: aut pone in ipso licinium inuolutum in unguento aegyptio, aut in unguento basilicon, donec amplificetur.	 If the orifice of the Sinus is narrow and cannot receive a cannula for purgation: then expand it slightly with iron; or place upon it linen wrapped in Egyptian ointment, or in basilicon ointment, until it expands.
Et similiter si est orificium etiam amplum, tunc aggrega labia eius cum sutura: et dimitte ex eo quantitatem in quam ingrediatur clistere sine additione.	 And similarly if the orifice is also wide, then gather its lips with stitching; and let out from it as much as the purgation can enter without addition.
Et similiter si orificium eius ex quo currit pus, est eleuatum ad superiora: tunc seca ipsum in depressiori loco qui est in ipso, ut currat ex eo pus usque inferius: quoniam pus quando coartatur in profunditate Sinus, prohibet carnem generari in eo.	 And similarly if the orifice from which pus runs is elevated above: then cut it in a lower place that is within it, so that pus can run downwards; since pus when constricted in the depth of the Sinus prevents flesh to grow there.
Quod si non est tibi possibile secare Sinum circiter inferius eius secundum quod uis: tunc conare, ut praepares membrum praeparatione qua currat ex eo pus cum facilitate secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	 If it is not possible for you to cut the Sinus below as you wish: then try, so that you prepare a member in such a way that pus can run out from it with ease according to how it is prepared for you.
Conare, ut non retineatur in eo aliquid ex pus omnino: et accipe medicinas consolidatiuas quae ponuntur super signum, conuenientes ad illud quod uis.	 Try, so that nothing from the pus is retained there; and take consolidating medicines which are placed on the mark, suitable for what you wish.
Et extende eas super pannum lini.	 Spread them out on a linen cloth.
Et sit pannus tantae quantitatis, qua fiat communicatio totius Sinus.	 Let the cloth be of such size that there is communication of the entire Sinus.
Deinde incide cum forficibus in directo orificii Sinus foramen, amplius orificio Sinus parumper.	 Then cut with scissors a hole in the direct orifice of the Sinus, slightly larger than the orifice of the Sinus.
Deinde extende ex unguentis lenibus super pannum alium, secundum quantitatem foraminis: et pone eum super ipsum positione longinqua ab orificio Sinus, ut alleuietur exitus pus ex eo: et non auferas pannum magnum, nisi post dies aliquos uice una.	 Then spread some gentle ointments over another cloth according to the size of the hole; and place it on top with a long position from the orifice of the Sinus, to ease the exit of pus from there; and do not remove the large cloth unless after several days in one go.
Ille autem qui est super orificium Sinus, est ille quem remoues in omni hora, ut egrediatur quod aggregatur in eo ex pus: et ut scias, an illud quod currit ex eo uirus, est multum, aut parum: aut digestum, aut indigestum.	 He who is above the opening of the Sinus, is the one to be removed at all times, so that what accumulates in it from pus may exit: and you should know whether what flows out of it is much or little; or digested or undigested.
Et cum hoc iterum considera locum Sinus ipsius, an in ipso sentiat dominus eius dolorem, aut non sit in eo dolor, et an sit in eo apostema, aut non sit in eo apostema.	 And again consider the location of the Sinus itself, whether its master feels pain there or not; and whether there is a boil there or not.
Cum ergo protenditur medicatio tua taliter, et uides materiam quae egreditur super orificium Sinus, tunc scias, quod Sinus iam adhaeret, aut approximat adhaerentiae: tunc ergo solue ipsum in mane, aut in tertio die: et quando soluis uulnus, tunc permuta pannum alium, et renoua unguentum.	 When your treatment is performed in this manner and you see the matter that exits from the opening of the Sinus, then know that the Sinus already adheres or approaches adhesion; then therefore dissolve it either on the morning or on the third day: and when you dissolve the wound, then change the linen cloth and renew the ointment.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post spacium longum uirus subtile, tunc non desperes de adhaerentia eius, nam sanatio eius appropinquat, quoniam ex hominibus sunt qui tardant generationem carnis in uulneribus suis, et ex eis sunt qui agunt econtrario illius.	 If, however, a subtle venom flows out of the Sinus after a long interval, then do not despair of its adhesion, for healing is approaching; because there are some men who produce slow flesh generation in their wounds, and there are others who act contrary to this.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post dies multos pus indigestum, tunc scias quod sinus non adhaeret.	 If, however, undigested pus flows out of the Sinus after many days, then know that the Sinus is not adhering.
Si ergo tardatur adhaerentia Sinus, et prolongatur res eius: tunc adde in exiccatione medicinarum, uerum faciant medici, ut sint medicinae in substantia sua humidae, et in uirtute sua siccae: sicut unguentum dyafinicon, quando additur in eo superfluitas additionis ex zegi.	 If therefore the adhesion of the Sinus is delayed and its matter prolonged; then add in drying medicines, but let the doctors do so that the medicines are humid in substance and dry in potency; such as unguentum dyafinicon when added to it an excess from zegi.
Et ex magis ultimo quo curatur, est, ut accipias unguentum dyafinicon, et soluatur cum oleo rosato, et roretur super ipsum uinum antiquum aequale in substantia sua.	 And from the more remote which is cured, it is that you receive unguentum dyafinicon, and dissolve it with rose oil, and rub over it old wine equal in substance.
Deinde confice ipsum cum eo, et utere ipso.	 Then make a paste from it and use it.
Et iam facit simile huic actioni, quando non est tibi praesens unguentum dyafinicon, mel, quando decoquis ipsum, donec ingrossetur, et uteris eo.	 And now he performs an action similar to this one, when you do not have the ointment dyafinicon available, honey, when you cook it until it thickens, and use it.
Aut accipe myrrham, et aloen, et olibanum: tere totum, et pulueriza illud super mel dum est super ignem.	 Take myrrh, aloes, and frankincense: grind everything into powder and sprinkle it over honey while it is over the fire.
Deinde line super ipsum pannum, et stringe ipsum super Sinum: et line cum melle quod decoquisti, donec ingrossatum est: et pulueriza super ipsum species, et pone super ipsum pannum, et stringe eum.	 Then, lay linen over it and bind it on a bladder: and lay the linen with the cooked honey, until it thickens: and sprinkle its powdery substance over it and bind it again.
Et quandoque administratur in illo aristolochia longa, et radices lilii coelestis, et est lilium: et farina herbi, et centaurea.	 And sometimes, in that case, aristolochia longa, celestial lily roots, and the lily itself are administered: along with wheat flour and chamomile.
Utere eis simplicibus, aut aggregatis, tere ea, et cribella ipsa: et pulueriza super mel quod narraui, et utere eo.	 Use them simply or combined, grind them, and sift the powder: sprinkle it over the honey I mentioned and use it.
Quod si prolongatur res Sinus, et non sanatur hac curatione: tunc scias, quod in profundo eius est corruptio: aut iam facit impressionem in ossibus, aut in reliquis membris duris, aut ligamentis: tunc cura ipsum curatione Fistularum, secundum quod praemissum est.	 If the case of the bladder continues and is not cured with this treatment: then you know that there is corruption in its depth: or it already causes impression on bones, or in hard members, or ligaments: then treat it with fistula cure, as previously mentioned.
¶ De cura Panaritii et unguis attritae, et incisione digiti additi, et sectione.	 Chapter on the treatment of pawrot and worn nails, and the incision and amputation of a finger or toe.
Caput XCI.	 Chapter CXI.
Panaritium est apostema quod nascitur sub ungue pollicis manus, aut pedis: et fortasse nascitur in reliquis digitis.	 Pawrot is an abscess that develops under the nail of the thumb or big toe, perhaps it arises in other fingers.
Cum ergo prolongatur res eius, et negligitur curato eius, et apostematur apostemate calido: aut corrumpitur, et emittit pus, donec corrodit radicem unguis: et fortasse corrumpit eam totam, et fortasse peruenit corruptio ad os, donec est ei odor foetidus: et fit extremitas digiti lata, et fit color eius fuscus.	 When the case of pawrot persists and is neglected and treated with warm abscess incision, it ruptures and releases pus until it corrodes the root of the nail: perhaps it corrodes it completely and corruption reaches the bone, so that there is a foul smell: and the tip of the finger becomes wide and its color turns black.
Quando ergo tu curas ipsum, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut incidas cum ferro totam superfluitatem quae remansit ex ungue.	 When you heal the self, with what we said in the division, and your treatment does not improve it: then it is necessary that you cut with iron all the excess which remains from the nail.
Deinde cauteriza uulnus post illud.	 Then, cauterize the wound after that.
Cauterium enim iuuatiuum est ualde.	 For indeed cautery is very beneficial.
Si uero os est sanum, et est unguis etiam sana, et additiones uacuae unguis iam comprimunt carnem ad interiora, et incipiunt pungere ipsam, et laedunt eam: tunc oportet ut ponas Radium subtilem sub angulo unguis quae pungit carnem, et impelle eam sursum: et incide eam carnem cum facilitate, et pone super illud quod remanet de carne ex medicinis comburentibus, corrosiuis, donec remoueatur totum eius.	 If the bone is healthy and also the nail is healthy, and empty additions of the nail already press the flesh towards the inside and begin to pierce it, and hurt it: then it is necessary that you place refined Radium under the angle of the nail which pierces the flesh, and push it upwards: and cut the flesh with ease, and place on top of what remains of the flesh from healing medicines, corrosives, until it is removed entirely.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then heal it with ointments, until it heals.
Si autem corruptio iam imprimit in os, tunc oportet ut incidas illud os, et extrahas ipsum: non enim sanatur unquam dum permanet in eo os corruptum.	 If already corruption is pressing on the bone, then it is necessary that you cut the bone and extract it: for indeed the bone does not heal while a corrupted bone remains in it.
Quod si uides corrosionem et corruptionem incedere in digitum, tunc incide eum in uno nodorum, secundum quod praemissa est eius rememoratio.	 If you see the corrosion and corruption advancing in a finger, then cut it in one knuckle, according to what was mentioned in its description.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then heal it, until it heals.
Si autem accidat ungui attritio, aut percussio: et contingit in ea dolor uehemens, tunc oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	 If however the nail is worn away or struck, and a strong pain occurs, then it is necessary to use leeches first.
Deinde seca unguem cum Spatumili acuto sectione transuersa de sursum ad uisum.	 Then cut the nail with a sharp Spathamelon crosswise from above towards the end.
Et custodi, ne sectio perueniat ad carnem quae est sub ungue, nam tu facies accidere per illud super infirmum dolorem uehementem, et erit caussa ad natiuitatem carnis additae in loco.	 And keep, that the cut does not reach the flesh which is under the nail, for indeed you will cause a strong pain above the weak, and it will be the cause of the growth of additional flesh at that location.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod sedat dolores.	 Then heal the place with what soothes the pains.
Digitus uero additus qui nascitur in quibusdam manibus hominum, fortasse est carnosus totus: et fortasse sunt in quibusdam eorum ossa, et fortasse est in eo unguis: et quidam eorum nascitur in radice iuncturae, aut est natiuitas eius in quibusdam nodis digiti.	 A finger that is born in some human hands may be entirely fleshy; and in some of these there are bones, and in one of them there is a nail: and some of those which are born at the root of the joint, or its birth is in the knots of the finger.
Ille ergo qui nascitur in quibusdam nodis digiti, non mouetur: et ille qui nascitur apud iuncturam digiti, fortasse mouetur.	 The one who is born in certain knots of the finger, does not move: and the one who is born at the junction of the finger, perhaps moves.
Eius ergo qui ex eis est carnosus, sectio eius facilis est.	 Therefore, for the one who is fleshy [from this condition], the cutting [of the affected part] is easy.
Quod est, ut incidas ipsum apud radicem suam cum Spatumili lato.	 This means, to cut it at its root with a broad Spatulili [tool].
Eius autem cuius natiuitas est in radice iuncturae curatio, est difficilis.	 But the treatment of the one whose origin is at the junction of the root, is difficult.
Abstine ergo ab incisione eius.	 Therefore, refrain from cutting it [the affected part].
In illo uero qui nascitur in digito apud ultimum nodorum, tunc oportet ut incidas in primis carnem eius incisione rotunda usque ad os.	 However, in the one who is born in the finger at the end of knots, then it is necessary to cut its flesh with a circular incision up to the bone [first].
Deinde serra os cum una illarum Serrarum conuenientium ad illud.	 Then saw the bone with one of those [appropriate] saws that fit for it.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then treat him until he is healed.
Consolidatio autem quae accidit digitis adinuicem, multotiens accidit aut ex natiuitate hominis, id est, nascitur cum eo, aut a consolidatione uulneris, aut combustione ignis, et similibus.	 Consolidation, which often occurs in the fingers on the other hand, frequently happens either from human birth, that is, being born with it, or from the consolidation of a wound, or from fire burns, and similar things.
Oportet ergo ut seces illam consolidationem, donec redeant digiti secundum formam suam naturalem.	 Therefore, it is necessary to cut that consolidation until the fingers return to their natural shape.
Deinde pone inter eos licinia, aut pannos infusos in oleo rosato: ut non consolidentur uelociter, et separa inter eos: aut pone inter eos laminam plumbi subtilem, donec consolidetur locus secundum quod oportet.	 Then place a linen cloth or absorbent cloth soaked in rose oil between them to prevent them from consolidating quickly and separating them; or place a thin sheet of lead between them until the location is healed as required.
Et similiter si accidat consolidatio quibusdam digitis cum palma, tunc seca illam consolidationem, secundum quod praeparatur et conuenit figurae membri.	 And similarly, if there is consolidation in some fingers with the palm, then cut that consolidation according to what is prepared and fitting for the shape of the member.
¶ De incisione Vitium.	 [Section] On the Vice of Incision.
Caput XCII.	 Chapter CXII.
Uites sunt Venae inuolutae, grossae, plenae superfluitatibus melancholicis quae accidunt in pluribus membris corporis: et plurimum euentus earum est in cruribus, praecipue in cruribus iter agentium et laborantium, et portantium.	 The veins are enlarged, thick, and filled with melancholic excesses which occur in many parts of the body; and their most common outcome is in the legs, especially in those who travel and exert themselves, and those who carry loads.
Oportet ergo ut administres excussionem corporis ex cholera nigra aliquotiens excussione forti.	 Therefore, it is necessary that you administer a purge of the body from black bile at times with strong purging.
Deinde phlebotoma patientis eas basilicam.	 Then perform venesection on the patient's basilic vein.
Curatio uero earum cum ferro, est secundum duos modos.	 The treatment of these (issues) with iron is according to two modes.
Vnus eorum est, ut secentur, et extrahatur sanguis niger.	 One of them is to cut (the vein), and draw out black blood.
Et modus alter est, ut eleuetur Vena, et extrahatur tota.	 And another method is, that it should be lifted up (the vein) and completely drawn out.
Sectio uero eius est secundum hunc modum.	 The section (operation) of this (vein) is according to this method.
Embroca crus in primis cum aqua calida multum, donec resoluatur sanguis grossus faeculentus.	 Pour a lot of warm water on the leg first, until the thick, foul blood is resolved.
Deinde stringe crus infirmi a superiori parte coxae eius, usque ad inferiorem partem genu cum uitta.	 Then tie the weak (affected) leg from its upper part of the thigh to its lower part of the knee with a bandage.
Deinde seca uenam in loco uno, aut duobus, aut tribus sectione ampla.	 Then cut the vein at one, or two, or three wide sections.
Deinde eleua, id est, extrahe sanguinem in manu tua ab inferiori parte cruris, usque ad sursum, et a superiori oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	 Then lift and draw out (the blood) from the lower part of the leg by hand towards the upper part, and it is necessary that the leech should be applied first to the affected person.
Deinde seca unguem cum usque inferius: donec egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uides sufficere, et quam tolerat uirtus infirmi.	 Then cut the fingernail towards the lower part: until a quantity of blood comes out that you see is sufficient, and as much as the strength of the affected person can bear.
Postea liga eam: et praecipe ei, ut abstineat a cibis generantibus choleram nigram: et itera euacuationem et phlebotomiam, quando implentur Venae, et nocet illud infirmo.	 Then tie it (the vein): and command him to abstain from foods that generate black bile; and repeat the evacuation and leeching when the veins are full, and that is harmful for the affected person.
Eleuatio autem eius est secundum hunc modum.	 The elevation (lifting of the blood) is according to this method.
Rade crus infirmi, si in ea sunt pili multi.	 Scrape the weak (affected) leg if there are many hairs in it.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in balneum: aut embroca ipsum in crure eius cum aqua calida, donec rubeat, et exuberentur Venae: aut exercitetur exercitio forti, si non est ei praesens balneum, donec calefiat membrum.	 Then immerse him in the bath; or pour warm water over his leg, until it turns red and the veins swell up; or exercise him with a strong movement (exercise), if there is no bath present for him, until the limb becomes warm.
Deinde seca cutem in directo uenae sectione per longitudinem: aut in ultimo eius apud genu, aut in inferiori parte eius apud calcaneum.	 Then make a longitudinal incision on the skin along the vein section; or at the end of it (the vein) near the knee, or at the lower part of it near the heel.
Deinde aperi cutem cum uncinis, et excoria uenam ab omni parte, donec appareat sensui: et est apud apparitionem eius, quod uides eam rubeam ad nigredinem decliuem.	 Then open the skin with a scalpel and scrape off all the vein until it is visible to the senses; and at its appearance, when you see it turn from red to black, there is a decline in sensation (the vein has been completely emptied).
Cum ergo uadit ex cute, uides eam albam quasi sit chorda.	 When it comes out from the flesh, you see it white like a cord.
Deinde intromitte sub ea Radium, donec quando eleuatur et egreditur de cute: suspende eam cum uncino caeco, leni.	 Then insert a rod under it until when it is raised and comes out of the flesh: hang it with a blind hook, gently.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam prope illam sectionem tribus digitis.	 Then make another incision nearby that incision with three fingers.
Deinde excoria cutem a superiori parte uenae, donec appareat.	 Then remove the skin from above the vein until it appears.
Deinde eleua eam cum Radiis sicut fecisti, et suspende eam cum uncino alio, sicut fecisti in primis.	 Then raise it with rods as you did before and hang it again with another hook, as you did first.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam, aut sectiones plures, si indiges illo.	 Then make another incision or multiple incisions if needed.
Deinde eleua, et incide ipsam ultima sectione apud calcaneum.	 Then remove it and cut the last incision at the heel.
Deinde extrahe eam ad sectionem quae est supra eam.	 Then draw out that part above it.
Et fac illud, donec extrahas eam ex sectione quae est superior, uel altior sectionibus omnibus, donec quando egreditur tota: tunc incide eam.	 And do this until you draw it out from the above incision or any higher incisions, until it comes out completely: then cut it.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad extrahendum, et eleuandum: tunc intromitte acum cum filo forti duplo, et liga eam, et extrahe ipsam: aut intromitte sub ea Radium: et reuolue manum tuam ad omnem partem, donec egrediatur.	 If it does not obey you in drawing and raising: then insert a sharp point with a strong thread and tie it and draw it out itself or insert a rod under it: and turn your hand to every part until it comes out.
Et caue, ne incidatur.	 And be careful not to cut it.
Nam si incidatur, fit difficile tibi eleuare eam ualde, et ingreditur super infirmum ex ea nocumentum.	 For if it is cut, it becomes very difficult for you to raise it and it enters into the patient a great harm from it.
Cum ergo extraxeris eam totam: tunc pone super locum uulnerum lanam submersam in uino et oleo rosato, aut oleo: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 When you draw it out completely: then place a wool soaked in wine and rose oil or olive oil on the wound site and take care of it until it heals.
Quod si Vitis est contracta, habens tortuositatem cui sit inuolutio ad partes, et non est sicut diximus secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut findas super eam ad omnem partem tortuositatis eius, et loca inuolutionis ipsius.	 If it is a vein that has a curvature with turns and is not as we have said straight: then you should make an incision over all its parts of the curvature and the places of the turning.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncinis, donec eleues eam totam: et caue apud sectionem tuam super eam ne incidas uenam, aut uulneres: nam difficile fiet super te eleuare, uel extrahere eam.	 Then hang it with hooks until you raise it completely: and be careful at your incision site not to cut the vein or wound: for it will become difficult for you to raise or draw it out.
Conserua ergo prudentiam tuam.	 Preserve therefore your prudence.
Forma Incidentis quo sanatur Vitis.	 The way to heal a wound is shaped like a vine (or grapevine).
Forma Vncini caeci.	 The shape of the bandage for a blind man (or blind eye).
Non est ei curuitas sicut reliquis Vncinis, neque est acutae extremitatis, ut non uulneret uenam: et est grossae flectuositatis, lenis: quoniam si esset subtilis, incideret uenam subtilitate sua: imo sit ei superflua grossitudo, sicut diximus.	 It is not a wound as the others are, nor does it have an acute end to injure the vein; and it has a thick and flexible nature because if it were subtle, it would pierce the vein with its subtlety; but rather excessive thickness is superfluous for it, as we said.
De extractione Venae cruris.	 On the extraction of the leg vein.
Caput XCIII.	 Chapter XCIII.
Haec Vena generatur in cruribus in terris calidis, sicut Alizegi, et terra Arabum, et in terris aridis, calidis, paucae teneritatis, id est, in quibus non nascitur herba, neque arbor.	 This vein is produced in warm lands such as Al-Izegi and the Arabian Peninsula, and in dry, warm areas of little softness (or frailty), that is, where no grass or tree grows.
Et fortasse generatur in locis aliis corporis praeter crura.	 And perhaps it is produced in other parts of the body apart from the legs.
Et generatio quidem eius est a putrefactione quae accidit sub cute, sicut accidunt intra corpora serpentes et uermes ascarides, et uermes generati inter cutem et carnem.	 Its generation indeed is from the putrefaction that occurs under the skin, such as what happens inside snakes' or tapeworms' bodies and worms generated between the skin and flesh.
Et signum incaeptionis euentus huius Venae est, quod accidit in crure inflammatio uehemens.	 And the sign of the onset of this vein is that which occurs with a violent inflammation in the leg.
Deinde uesicatur locus.	 Then it (the area) is incised.
Deinde incipit Vena exire ex loco illius uesicationis, quasi sit radix plantae, aut animal.	 Then the vein begins to emerge from that incision, as if it were the root of a plant or an animal.
Cum ergo apparet ex ea extremitas eius, tunc oportet ut inuoluas super ipsam frustum plumbi, cuius pondus sit ex drachma keil, usque ad drachmas II et noda ipsam: et dimitte plumbum suspensum ex crure.	 When its end appears from there, then it is necessary to roll a leaden tube (or lead weight) of kilogram-keel weight over it up to two drachms and the knot; and let go of the hanging lead from the leg.
Quotiens ergo egreditur ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, inuolue illud in plumbo, et noda illud.	 Whenever something comes out of it towards the outside, roll that over in lead and knot it.
Quod si prolongatur multum, tunc incide partem eius, et inuolue residuum.	 If it extends for a long time, then cut off part of it, and roll up the rest.
Et non incidas eam radicitus antequam egrediatur tota.	 Do not cut it root-wise before it has completely come out.
Quoniam si incidis, contrahitur, et ingreditur in carnem: et facit accidere apostema, et putredinem in loco, et ulcus malum.	 Because if you cut (it), it contracts and enters into the flesh; and causes an abscess to occur, and pus in the place, and a bad ulcer.
Quapropter oportet, ut suauiter tractetur, et extrahatur paulatim, donec egrediatur ex ultimo sui, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid in corpore: et ex hac quidem Vena egreditur in quibusdam hominibus quod est in longitudine sua quinque palmorum et decem.	 Therefore, it should be treated gently and slowly drawn out until it has completely come out and nothing remains in the body; and from this vein comes out in some people what is in its length five palms and ten (fingers).
Et iam peruenit ad me, quia exiuit uiro ex XX palmis.	 And now it has reached me, because a man has come out from twenty palms.
Si autem inciditur tibi in hora medicationis tuae: tunc intromitte radium in foramine eius, et perfora eam foramine longo, cum corpore, donec euacuetur totum quod est in ea ex materia: et administra putrefactionem loci cum medicinis diebus aliquot.	 If however it is cut during your treatment; then insert a probe into its opening and perforate it with a long probe, along with the body, until all that is in it from the matter has been evacuated; and administer pus-treatment to the place with medicines for some days.
Deinde cura ipsum curatione apostematum.	 Then treat it with the treatment of abscesses.
Et haec quidem Vena quandoque habet ramos multos, praecipue quando apparet in iunctura pedis, aut in pede ipso: et accidunt ei orificia multa, et egreditur ex omni orificio ramus.	 And this vein sometimes has many branches, particularly when it appears at the junction of the foot, or on the foot itself; and many openings occur to it, and a branch comes out from every opening.
Cura ergo ipsam, sicut diximus in diuisione, et cum eo quod praemissum est.	 Therefore, treat it as we have said in the previous section, and with what has been mentioned before.
¶ De sectione super Vermes generatos sub cute, et dicitur Aegritudo bouina.	 § On the cutting of worms generated under the skin, and it is called Bouin disease.
Caput XCIIII.	 Chapter CXLIII.
Haec Aegritudo nominatur in quadam terra apud nos Aegritudo bouina: propterea, quia multotiens accidit bouibus, et est uermis paruus unus, qui nascitur inter cutem et carnem.	 This disease is called Bouin disease in a certain land among us; because it often occurs to cows and there is a small worm that is born between the skin and flesh.
Et uadit in corpore toto, ascendendo et descendendo: et ostenditur sensui apud ambulationem eius de membro ad membrum, donec disrumpit ubicumque disrumpit in cute locum, et egreditur.	 And it moves throughout the body, going up and down; and it is perceived by the senses during its movement from limb to limb until it bursts open at any place where it bursts, and comes out.
Et generatio eius est ex putredine quorundam humorum.	 And its generation is from the corruption of certain humors.
Sicut accidunt uermes et serpentes, id est, lumbrici, et ascarides in uentre.	 As worms and snakes, that is, earthworms and roundworms occur in the belly.
Et timetur ex malicia eius.	 And it is feared from its malice.
Quia quando ipse uadit in corpore, et eleuatur ad caput, et peruenit ad locum: tunc fortasse aperit in eo, et egreditur, et destruit oculum: et accidit illud multotiens.	 When it enters the body and rises to the head, and reaches the place, then perhaps it opens there and exits, and destroys the eye; this happens often.
Cum ergo uis curare eum, et extrahere ipsum, tunc non fit illud nisi apud ambulationem eius, et apparitionem ipsius sensui.	 When one wants to cure it and extract it, this is done only during his walking and the appearance of the same to the sense.
Oportet ergo, ut stringas quod est supra eum, et quod est sub eo cum ligamento constrictione forti.	 Therefore, one must bind what is above it and what is below it with a strong bandage.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	 Then cut above it, and extract it.
Quod si profundatur in carne, et non inuenis ipsum: tunc pone super locum cauterium cum igne, donec moriatur.	 If it goes deep into the flesh, and you cannot find it; then place a cauterization over the spot with fire until it dies.
Et maius quod timetur, est corruptio eius, qua corrumpit oculum, sicut diximus.	 And the greater fear is its corruption which corrupts the eye, as we have said.
Si autem uides eum iam peruenisse in capite prope oculum, tunc stringe sub eo supercilium strictura bona.	 If you see it has already reached the head near the eye, then bind above it with a good brow-band.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	 Then cut above it, and extract it.
Et oportet ut utatur infirmus mundificatione sui corporis, cum medicinis soluentibus humores putridos malos.	 And the sick person must use self-cleansing of his body, with medicines that dissolve bad and foul humors.
Et caueat sibi a cibis generantibus putrefactionem.	 And let him be careful to avoid foods causing decay.
¶ De sectione super aegritudinem Nakir.	 Section on the disease called Nakir.
Caput XCV.	 Chapter XCV.
Haec aegritudo nominatur in terra nostra Nakir: et est dolor qui accidit in quibusdam membris: deinde permutatur de membro ad membrum.	 This disease is called Nakir in our land; it is pain that occurs in some members, then changes from member to member.
Et ego quidem iam uidi ipsum, secundum quod narro tibi.	 And I myself have already seen this, as I have told you.
Vocatus sum ad mulierem infirmam in quibusdam uillis.	 I was called to a sick woman in some villages.
Et detexit brachium suum, et uidi inflationem paruam in uena funis brachii.	 She pulled out her arm, and I saw a swelling smaller than the vein of the arm.
Et postquam remansi hora una, uidi unam inflationem incedere cum focili, sicut incedit uermis, ascendendo ad humerum eius uelocius quam esse potest: ut sit sicut argentum uiuum, quando currit de loco ad locum.	 And after staying for an hour, I saw a swelling moving with a worm-like motion, faster than possible, as if silver running from place to place.
Recessit ergo dolor ex illo loco, et fixus est in humero.	 The pain therefore withdrew from that place, and it was fixed in the shoulder.
Deinde sedi hora una, et cucurrit in reliquum corpus, donec perueniret in brachium aliud.	 Then, after an hour, it ran through the rest of the body until it reached another arm.
Deinde narrauit mihi, quia reuoluebatur in toto corpore suo, secundum quod uidi.	 Then he told me that it was being turned throughout its entire body, as I saw it.
Miratus sum ergo de uelocitate permutationis eius de membro ad membrum.	 I was therefore amazed by the swiftness of its transformation from limb to limb.
Et ego quidem ante illud non uideram hanc aegritudinem oculis meis taliter secundum hunc modum.	 And indeed, before that, I had not seen this illness appear in my eyes in such a way.
Verumtamen uidi multos, qui inueniunt dolorem permutari de membro ad membrum: et non uidi ipsum oculis, sicut uidi eum in muliere.	 Nevertheless, I have seen many who find pain transform from limb to limb; and I did not see it with my own eyes as I saw it in the woman.
Et ego non cogito illud esse, nisi quod est propterea, quod mulier fuit ex illis qui sunt ex uillis sicci corporis detectarum uenarum: hinc ergo apparet sensui illa uentositas permutata.	 And I do not think that it was anything other than because the woman was one of those who are afflicted with dry bodies and congested veins; therefore, it appears that this windiness was transformed.
Et est necesse, ut non appareant secundum hanc rationem in illis qui sunt deliciosi, et corporibus humidis, occultarum uenarum.	 And it is necessary that it does not appear according to this reason in those who are delicate and have moist bodies, the hidden veins being concealed.
Cum ergo uis curationem eius, et sentit patiens illud dolorem: tunc si est apparens tibi oculo, sicut diximus, tunc stringe supra ipsum, et sub ipso uelociter: et seca supra ipsum, donec egrediatur illa uentositas coartata: et cauteriza locum.	 When therefore you wish to cure it, and the patient feels that pain; then if it appears to you with your eyes as we have said, then squeeze above it and below it quickly; cut above it until that windiness is released, compressed; and cauterize the place.
Si autem non uides ipsum oculis tuis: tunc cura ipsum cum excussione corporis, et cum eo quod expellit uentositates, et carminat eas cum pillulis foetidis, et pillulis de serapino, et similibus.	 But if you do not see it with your eyes: then cure it with the body's shaking and with that which expels windiness, and crumble them with foul pills, and pills of myrrh, and similar things.
¶ De extractione Sagittarum.	 Chapter on the Extraction of Arrows.
Caput XCVI.	 Chapter LXVI.
Sagittae diuersificantur secundum species suas, et secundum loca in quibus cadunt ex corpore.	 Arrows are classified according to their shapes and the places where they fall from the body.
Earum uero diuersitas est: quoniam ex eis sunt quae habent cuspides magnos, et paruos: et concauae, et surdae.	 The diversity of arrows is that there are some which have large points and small ones; concave or straight.
Et ex eis sunt quae habent tres angulos.	 And among them are those which have three angles.
Et ex eis quibus sunt linguae.	 And from these are tongues.
Et ex eis quibus sunt astellae.	 And among them are stars.
Illae uero quae sunt secundum membra in quibus cadunt, est secundum duos modos.	 Those that are in regard to limbs where they fall, are according to two modes.
Aut enim membra sunt ex membris principalibus concauis, sicut cerebrum, et cor, et epar, et pulmo, et renes, et intestina, et uesica, et eis similia.	 Or the limbs are from principal convex members such as the brain, heart, liver, lung, kidney, intestines, bladder, and similar.
Quando ergo cadit in aliquo horum membrorum, et apparent tibi signa mortis, quae ego narro tibi post, tunc oportet ut deuites extractionem illius sagittae ex eis, nam mors consequitur illum in quo est, in pluribus dispositionibus.	 When it falls in any one of these members and shows you signs of death, which I will tell you afterwards, then it is necessary that you devote the extraction of this arrow, for death follows it wherever it is, in various positions.
Et quando non apparent tibi ista signa mala, et sagitta non est absconsa in profunditate membri, tunc extrahe ipsam, et cura uulnus.	 And when these signs are not evident to you, and the arrow is not concealed in the depth of the member, then extract it yourself, and care for the wound.
Ex signis enim cerebri quando cadit in eo sagitta, et penetrat os, et egreditur siphac quod est super cerebrum, est: quoniam accidunt ex illo soda uehemens, et scotomia, et uertigo, et rubedo in oculis, et inflatio, et rubedo linguae, et spasmus, et permixtio intellectus, et uomitus cholerae.	 For the signs of brain when an arrow falls into it and penetrates the bone, and comes out from what is above the brain, are: because hot flashes occur from it, and scotoma, and vertigo, and redness in the eyes, and swelling, and redness of the tongue, and spasms, and confusion of intellect, and vomiting of cholera.
Et fortasse egreditur sanguis ex naribus, aut auribus.	 And perhaps blood comes out from the nose, or ears.
Et fortasse abscinditur sermo, et destruitur uox.	 And perhaps speech is cut off, and the voice is destroyed.
Et egreditur ex loco uulneris humiditas alba similis pulti.	 And from the place of the wound comes out moisture white like plaster.
Et exit ex eo simile aquositati carnis.	 And it comes out similar to meat that has been soaked in water.
Si ergo apparent tibi ista signa, tunc abstine a curatione, et extrahe sagittam si non egreditur.	 If these signs appear to you, then abstain from treatment, and extract the arrow if it does not come out.
Signa autem sagittae quando cadit in corde, sunt: quod ipsa est prope mammillam sinistram: et sentit cum ea quasi ipsa sit fixa in re dura, non in re uacua.	 The signs of the arrow when it falls on the heart are: that it is near the left mammary: and it feels as if it were fixed in a hard thing, not in an empty one.
Et fortasse sagittae est motus similis motui pulsus: et currit ex uulnere sanguis niger.	 And perhaps the arrow has motion similar to the pulse: and blood runs from the wound black.
Et sequitur illud frigus extremitatum, et sudor frigidus, et syncopis.	 And follows that chill of the extremities, and cold sweat, and fainting.
Scias ergo, quod mors descendit procul dubio.	 Know therefore, that death approaches without doubt.
Et signum sagittae quando uulnerat pulmonem, est exitus sanguinis spumosi ex uulnere: et uasa quae sequuntur collum, apostematur, et mutatur color infirmi.	 And the sign of an arrow wounding the lung is the flowing out of frothy blood from the wound; and vessels that follow the neck are to be tied off, and the color of the sick person changes.
Et expirat spiritum magnum, altum: et quaerit attractionem aeris frigidi.	 And breathes out a great, deep breath; and seeks attraction of cold air.
Quod si cadat sagitta in uelamen, quod est in pectore: tunc est prope costas paruas: et fit anhelitus magnus cum dolore uehementi, cum suspirio: et mouentur omnia membra humerorum.	 If the arrow falls into the pleura, which is in the chest; then it is near to the small ribs; and a great gasping with intense pain occurs, with sighing; and all the limbs of the shoulders are moved.
Et si cadat sagitta in stomachum, tunc fortasse egreditur ex uulnere ex cibo aliquid indigestum.	 If the arrow falls into the stomach, then perhaps something undigested comes out from the wound.
Et si cadit sagitta in Ventrem, et figitur in eo: egreditur aliquid stercoris ex uulnere, aut zirbum, aut intestinum quod iam disruptum est.	 If the arrow falls into the abdomen and is fixed there, then something of feces comes out from the wound, or pus, or an intestine that has already been ruptured.
Non est ergo spes in curatione eius, neque in extractione sagittae.	 Therefore there is no hope for his cure nor in extracting the arrow.
Quod si sagitta cadat in Vesicam, et egrediatur urina: et procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, et fortior sit dolor super infirmum: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	 If the arrow falls into the bladder and urine comes out; and something proceeds from it to the outside, and the pain is stronger upon the sick person; then know that it is mortal.
Reliqua autem membra, sicut facies, et collum, et guttur, et spatula, et adiutorium, et spondiles dorsi, et furcula, et coxa, et crus, et eis similia ex membris saluantur secundum plures dispositiones: quando non inuenit sagitta arteriam, aut neruum: et non est sagitta uenenosa.	 The remaining limbs, such as the face, neck, throat, tongue, spatula, aid-hand, dorsal vertebrae, pelvis, leg and similar parts of the body are to be cured in various ways; when the arrow does not hit an artery or a nerve; and the arrow is not poisonous.
Et ego narro tibi quod uidi de esse harum sagittarum, ut significes per illud super curationem tuam.	 And I tell you that I have seen such arrows, which indicate by this concerning your cure.
Quod est, quia cuidam uiro cecidit sagitta in lachrymali oculi eius, in radice nasi.	 That is because a man had an arrow fall into his tear duct of the eye, at the root of the nose.
Extraxi ergo eam ipsi ex parte altera, sub adipe auris eius: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei in oculo eius nocumentum.	 Extract it from the other side, beneath the ear fat; and he was cured, and no harm came to his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam Iudaeo, quae cecidit ei in adipe oculi sui sub palpebra inferiori: et sagitta iam occultata erat, et non consecutus sum ex ea nisi extremitatem paruam eius, cum qua adhaeret in ligno suo: et erat sagitta magna ex sagittis arcuum Turcorum, cum ferro leni, in qua non sunt aures.	 And extract another arrow from the Jew, which fell upon his eyelid beneath the lower lid; and the arrow was already hidden, and I did not obtain more than its tip, which adhered to the wood of it; and the arrow was large among arrows of Turks, with a soft iron, in which there were no ears.
Sanatus est ergo Iudaeus, et non accidit in oculo eius accidens malum.	 The Jew was therefore cured, and no further harm came to his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam ex gutture Christiani.	 And extract another arrow from the throat of a Christian.
Et erat sagitta arabica, et est illa cui sunt aures.	 And the arrow was Arabian, and it had ears.
Secui ergo super ipsam inter duas guidegi: et iam submersa erat in gutture eius.	 Cut therefore upon it between two ribs; and already it was immersed in his throat.
Subtiliatus sum ergo cum ea, donec extraxi eam: et sanatus est Christianus.	 I became sharp with it, until I extracted it; and the Christian was cured.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam uiro quae ceciderat in uentre eius: et cogitauimus, quia moreretur ex ea.	 And extract another arrow from a man who fell upon his abdomen; and we thought that he would die from it.
Postquam ergo praeterierunt ei triginta dies, et non mutatum est super eum aliquid ex dispositionibus eius, secui super sagittam: et ingeniaui super eam, et extraxi eam: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei accidens malum.	 After thirty days had passed, and nothing changed in his condition, I cut upon the arrow; and I became sharp upon it, and extracted it; and he was cured, and no further harm came to him.
Et uidi uirum cui cecidit sagitta in dorso eius, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam.	 And I saw a man upon whom an arrow had fallen on his back, and the wound was consolidated over it.
Postquam ergo fuit post septem annos, exiuit sagitta in radice coxae eius.	 After seven years, the arrow emerged at the root of his hip.
Et uidi mulierem cui cecidit in uentre suo sagitta, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam, et remansit sagitta intra ipsam: et non mutata est ex dispositionibus eius aliqua, et mulier non inuenit ei nocumentum in aliqua ex operationibus suis naturalibus.	 And I saw a woman upon whom an arrow had fallen on her abdomen, and the wound was consolidated over it, and the arrow remained within her; and nothing changed in her condition, and the woman did not suffer harm from any of her natural operations.
Et uidi uirum alium, cui cecidit sagitta in facie sua: et consolidatum est uulnus, et remansit, non inueniens ei multum dolorem: et similia istis multa.	 I saw another man, to whom an arrow fell upon his face; and the wound was sealed, and he remained, not finding him much pain; and similar things many times.
Et extraxi sagittam uiro ex principibus Regis, quae ceciderat ei in medio nasi sui, et iam declinauerat ad partem dextram parumper: et occultata erat sagitta tota.	 I removed the arrow from the man who was among the King's princes, which had fallen upon his nose in the middle, and it had already turned a little towards the right; and the arrow was completely hidden.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius post casum sagittae usque ad tres dies.	 Therefore I was called for his treatment after the fall of the arrow up to three days.
Inueni ergo uulnus sagittae strictum ualde.	 I found therefore the wound of the arrow narrowed very much.
Inquisiui ergo eam cum tenta subtili, et non sensi eam: et ipse quidem inueniebat punctionem et dolorem sub aure sua ex parte dextra.	 I pierced it then with a delicate probe and did not feel it; and himself indeed found the puncture and pain under his right ear.
Speraui ergo, quod erat illa punctio ex extremitate sagittae.	 Therefore I hoped that this was the puncture from the end of the arrow.
Emplastraui ergo locum cum emplastro in quo erat uirtus attractiua, et digestiua, confidens apud me, quod apostemaretur locus, et appareret mihi signum sagittae, ut secarem super eam: et non accidit in loco accidens significans quod sagitta consecuta sit locum.	 I plastered therefore the place with a healing ointment containing an attracting and digesting virtue, trusting that the wound would heal, and that the mark of the arrow would appear to me so that I could cut over it; but this did not occur in the place signifying that the arrow had struck.
Assiduaui ergo cum emplastro super eum diebus multis: et non accidit accidens, et consolidatum est uulnus interim: et remansit infirmus de extractione eius spacio dierum, donec sensit sagittam die quodam intra nasum suum.	 I remained therefore with the plaster on him for many days; but this did not occur, and the wound healed in the meantime; and he remained weak in extracting it until one day within his nose he felt the arrow.
Et narrauit mihi illud.	 And he told me that.
Posui ergo super illud uulnus medicinam acutam, corrosiuam diebus multis, donec apertum est: et cum tenta tentaui ipsum, et sensi extremitatem sagittae subtilem quae adhaeret in ligno.	 Therefore I applied on that wound a sharp and corrosive medicine for many days until it opened; and when I pierced it with a probe, I felt the delicate end of the arrow adhering to the wood.
Deinde addidi in apertione uulneris per illam medicinam acutam, donec apparuit nobis uisibiliter extremitas sagittae: et praeteriit mihi cum eo spacium temporis circiter quatuor menses.	 Then I added to the opening of the wound through that sharp medicine until the end of the arrow appeared visibly to us; and it passed by me for about four months with him.
Deinde postquam amplificatum est uulnus, et possible fuit mihi intromittere forcipes in ipsam, et mouere ipsam, et non obediuit ad exitum: tunc non cessaui subtiliare, et ingeniare super eam cum modis ingeniorum, donec coepi super eam die quodam cum forcipibus decenter factis, secundum quod ueniet forma eorum in fine capituli, donec extraxi eam.	 Then, after the wound has been enlarged and it was possible for me to insert forceps into it, and move it, and it did not obey to come out: then I did not cease to refine and contrive over it with methods of ingenuity, until on some day I began with properly made forceps, according to what their form will be at the end of the chapter, until I extracted it.
Deinde restauraui uulnus.	 Then, after the wound has been sutured.
Et medici quidem iudicant, quod cartilago nasi non restauratur.	 And indeed physicians judge that the cartilage of the nose cannot be sutured.
Restauraui ergo ipsam, et consolidatum est uulnus, et sanatus est infirmas sanitate integra: nec nocuit ei aliquid omnino.	 I therefore sutured it, and the wound was healed, and the weak one recovered with a healthy integrity; nothing at all harmed him.
Et ego narro tibi qualitatem extractionis quarundam sagittarum: ut ponas illud regulam et significationem super illud quod non dixi.	 And I tell you the quality of extraction of some arrows: so that you will put that rule and meaning on what I have not said.
Quoniam partes huius artis et distinctiones earum non comprehenduntur cum narratione: neque comprehendit illud liber, et artifex prudens comparat cum pauco super multum: et cum eo quod est paesens, super illud quod est absens: et inuenit operationem nouam, et instrumentum nouum apud descensus rerum extranearum huius artis quando accidunt.	 Because the parts of this art and their distinctions are not understood with a narration; neither does that book comprehend it, and the skilled craftsman compares little to much; and when one is present, on what is absent; and he finds a new operation and a new instrument for descending things foreign to this art, when they occur.
Dico ergo, quod sagittae non egrediuntur ex membris quibus sunt fixae, nisi secundum duos modos.	 I say therefore that arrows do not come out of the members on which they are fixed, unless according to two modes.
Aut per attractionem ex loco ex quo intrauit.	 Or by being attracted from the place where it entered.
Aut contrario partis alterius.	 Opposite part of another.
Et illa quae egreditur unde intrauit, aut est sagitta procedens in loco carnoso: et attrahitur, et egreditur.	 And that which comes out from where it entered, or is a projectile going into the fleshly place: and it is drawn, and it goes out.
Quod si non obedit ad exitum ex hora in qua cadit: tunc oportet ut dimittas ipsam aliquot diebus, donec putrefiat caro quae est in circumitu eius: et alleuietur attractio eius, et eius egressio.	 If it does not obey for exit from the hour at which it falls: then it is necessary that you let it go for some days, until the flesh around it rots: and the attraction of it decreases, and its coming out.
Et similiter si figitur in osse, et non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc dimitte ipsam etiam aliquot diebus: et itera eam cum attractione et motione omni die, donec egreditur.	 And similarly if it fixes in bone and does not obey for the exit, then let it go also for some days: and apply it every day with pulling and movement, until it comes out.
Quod si non obedit tibi ad exitum post dies, tunc oportet ut perfores in circumitu sagittae in ipso osse ab omni parte cum terebro subtili, donec amplificentur sagittae.	 If it does not obey for the exit after days, then it is necessary that you pierce around the projectile in the same bone from every side with a fine chisel, until the projectile widens.
Deinde attrahe eam, et extrahe ipsam.	 Then pull it and extract it.
Si autem sagitta est fixa in capitis osse, et iam processit in uno uentrium cerebri, et apparent ex infirmo quaedam illorum accidentium quae dixi: tunc abstine ab attractione sagittae, et dimitte eam, donec aequetur esse eius post dies.	 If the projectile is fixed in the bone of the skull and has advanced into one ventricle of the brain, and some of the symptoms which I mentioned appear weak: then refrain from pulling on the projectile, and let it be until its state is equal after days.
Nam si sagitta peruenit ad sifach, tunc mors non prolongatur ei.	 For if the projectile reaches the nose, then death does not prolong for it.
Et si sagitta non est fixa, nisi in corpore ossis tantum, et non penetrat usque ad sifach: et remanet infirmus aliquot diebus, et non accidit ei ex illis accidentibus aliquid: tunc ingenia in attractione sagittae et extractione eius.	 And if the projectile is not fixed except in the body of a bone only, and does not penetrate until to the nose; and remains weak for some days, and nothing happens from those symptoms: then the skill is in pulling on the projectile and extracting it.
Si autem est fixa ualde, et non obedit tibi ad attractionem: tunc administra terebella in circumitu sagittae, sicut narraui tibl: deinde cura locum, donec sanetur.	 If it is fixed strongly and does not obey for pulling: then administer chisel around the projectile, as I told you; then take care of the place, until it heals.
Si autem Sagitta iam absconsa est in loco corporis, et occultatur et absconditur a sensu: tunc inquire eam cum tenta.	 If the projectile is already hidden in the body's place and is concealed and hidden from sensation: then search for it with probes.
Si autem sentis eam, tunc attrahe eam cum quibusdam instrumentis quae conueniunt attractioni eius.	 If however you feel it (the tumor), then pull it out with certain instruments that are suitable for its pulling out.
Si autem non potes super eam, propter constrictionem uulneris, et propter longitudinem sagittae in profundo: et non est illic os, neque neruus, neque uena: tunc finde super eam, donec amplificetur uulnus, et sit possibile extrahere sagittam.	 If you cannot pull it (the arrow) on account of the constriction of the wound and the length of the arrow in depth, and there is no bone, nerve or vein there: then fill it (the wound), until the wound expands, so that it becomes possible to extract the arrow.
Quod si sunt ei aures quibus teneatur, tunc libera carnem fixam in eis ab omni parte, omni ingenio quo potes illud, et ingenia, si non potest super euasionem carnis in fractura aurium, et contorsione earum, donec euadat.	 If it (the tumor) has ears by which it is held: then cut the fixed flesh from all sides with any means you can manage, and the instruments if the cutting of the flesh cannot be made through breaking of the ears and twisting them, until it comes out.
Et tu quando administras extractionem Sagittae, in quocumque loco est, tunc utere contorsione manus tuae, cum forficibus ad partes omnes, donec facias eam euadere: et subtilia ultima subtilitate, ut non frangatur Sagita, et fiat difficilis tibi attractio eius, et ipsius extractio.	 And when you administer the extraction of an arrow in any place, then use twisting with your hand along with forceps to all parts, until it makes it come out: and carefully with utmost subtlety so that the arrow is not broken, and its pulling becomes difficult for you, and its removal.
Quod si non potes super eam ex hora una, tunc dimitte eam diebus aliquot, donec putrefiant quae sunt in circumitu eius.	 If you cannot pull it (the arrow) within an hour, then leave it for some days until what is around it putrefies.
Deinde itera eam: alleuietur enim tuncia Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra quod diximus ex curatione in capitulo suo: et custodi uirtutem tuam ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, aut chordae.	 Then try it again: for the wound will heal itself if the flow of blood opposes you. But if a counteraction occurs to you in the form of bleeding, then administer what we have said in its treatment chapter: and keep your skill away from cutting a vein or nerve or tendon.
Et administra ingenium omni modo quo tibi possibile est euasionis Sagittae: et sit illud cum facilitate, et tranquillitate, uel tarditate, et firmitate, sicut narraui tibi.	 And use any means to extract the arrow with ease, peace, or slowness, and firmness as I have told you.
Et oportet, ut facias cum trahis Sagittam, ut infirmus sit secundum figuram, secundum quam fuit apud casum Sagittae in ipso.	 It is necessary that when you pull the arrow, it should be weakened in the same form as at the time of the arrow wound.
Quoniam est magis iuuatiuum.	 Because it is more beneficial.
Si autem non est tibi possibile illud, tunc administra quod tibi est possibile ex figuris.	 If that is not possible for you, then administer what is possible according to figures (arrow shapes).
Sagitta autem quae egreditur ex contrario partis alterius, aut iam procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora: aut facit gibbositatem extremitas Sagittae per sensum ex superiore parte cutis propinquae, et uides eam eminentem: seca ergo super eam, et sit sectio secundum quantitatem quod capiant in ea forcipes.	 The arrow that emerges from the opposite part of another, or it already advances something towards the exteriors; or it causes a swelling at the tip of the arrow by sensation from the upper part of the skin nearby, and you see it protruding: therefore cut above it, and let the section be according to the quantity that the forceps can grasp.
Deinde attrahe eam: ipsa namque fit facilis ad exitum.	 Then draw it out: for it becomes easy to come out.
Si uero retinetur in osse, tunc torque manum tuam secundum rotunditatem, donec imprimat Sagitta in osse, et amplificet sibiipsi: deinde trahe ipsam.	 If however it is held in the bone, then turn your hand according to its roundness, until the arrow presses into the bone and enlarges itself; then draw it out.
Et si non: dimitte eam diebus aliquot: deinde itera eam, donec egrediatur.	 And if not: let it be for some days; then press it again until it comes out.
Quod si lignum Sagittae est in ea, tunc impelle ipsam cum eo.	 If wood is in the arrow, then push it out along with it.
Si autem cecidit lignum, et uis administrare impulsionem: tunc intromitte ad eam instrumentum concauum, ut ingrediatur concauitas eius in caudam Sagittae: deinde impelle eam cum ipso.	 If however the wood has fallen out, and you wish to administer a thrust; then insert a concave instrument into it, so that its concavity enters the tail of the arrow: then push it along with it.
Si autem Sagita est concaua, tunc impelle eam cum instrumento intrante in ipsam.	 If however the arrow is concave, then push it along with the instrument inserted into it.
Sagitta enim alleuiatur per illud.	 The arrow is relieved by that [cure].
Quod si Sagitta est toxicata, tunc oportet, ut concaues carnem totam, in qua est uenenum: si est tibi possibile illud.	 If the arrow is poisoned, then it is necessary to excavate all the flesh where the venom is; if you are able to do this.
Deinde cura eam cum eo quod conuenit ad illud.	 Then heal it with what suits for that.
Quod si Sagitta est cadens in pectore, aut in uentre, aut in uesica, aut in latere: et est propinqua ex eo quod tangis cum tenta, et possibile est tibi secare super eam: tunc seca, et caue ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, et extrahe eam.	 If the arrow falls in the chest, or in the belly, or in the bladder, or in the side: and it is close to that which you touch with your hand, and it is possible for you to cut above it; then cut, and be careful not to cut a vein or a nerve, and pull it out.
Deinde sue uulnus, si uides, et cura illud, donec sanetur.	 Then suture the wound, if you see it, and heal it until it heals up.
Et haec est forma Forcipum, quibus extrahuntur Sagittae.	 And this is the form of forceps with which arrows are pulled out.
Sint extremitates similes rostro auis, quae factae sunt sicut ferra: quando capiunt super Sagittam, non dimittunt eam.	 Extremities are like the beak of a bird, which have been made as iron: when they take hold of an arrow, they do not release it.
Et fiunt ex eis species multae, magnae, et paruae, et mediae, secundum quantitatem magnitudinis Sagittae, et paruitatis eius, et amplitudinis uulneris, et constrictionis eius.	 They become various kinds, great and small, and medium-sized, according to the size of the arrow, its fineness, and the width and depth of the wound.
Forma Impellentis concaui.	 The shape of the projectile is hollowed out.
Et forma Impellentis surdi.	 And the shape of the projectile is deaf.
Hoc est surdae extremitatis sicut Radius, ut alleuietur introitus eius in sagittam concauam, et impellatur cum eo.	 This is a hollowed-out extremity like a radius, so that its entrance may fit into the concave arrow and be propelled with it.
Huius extremitas impellentis concauae est concaua sicut penna auis: ut alleuietur introitus sagittae in ipsam et impulsio eius.	 The extremity of the hollowed-out projectile is also concave like a bird's feather: so that the arrow's entrance may fit into it and its thrust be effective.
¶ De phlebotomia Venarum.	 Chapter on Phlebotomy of Veins.

Et nominat eam uulgus uenam uentris.	 And the common people call it vein of the abdomen.
Et Funis brachii, et est posita super focile: et est illa in qua phlebotomatur, et est illa quae apparet supra pollicem appatitione manifesta.	 And Brachial artery, and it is placed on the elbow; it is the one that is cut for bleeding, and it is the one that appears above the thumb in a visible manner.
Et Saluatella: et est uena quae est inter annularem et minimum: et sunt ei duo rami.	 And Savial artery; it is the vein that is between the ankle and the smallest [finger or toe]; and it has two branches.
Et in crure et in pede sunt tres uenae.	 And in the leg and foot there are three veins.

Phlebotomiae uero duarum uenarum quae sunt post Aures, iuuamentum est ad catarros antiquos, et hemigraneam, et sahafati, et ulcera capitis mala antiqua.	 In fact, bloodletting of the two veins that are behind the ears is beneficial for old catarrhs, and migraine, and sores on the head, old sores.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eam est secundum quod narro.	 And the quality of bloodletting is as I have said.
Et est, ut radatur caput infirmi: et fricetur occipitium eius in loco duarum uenarum cum panno aspero fricatione bona.	 And it is to shave the head of the sick person; rub the back of his head in the place of the two veins with a rough cloth.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum cum uitta, donec appareant duae uenae.	 Then the sick person should tighten his neck with a ligature until the two veins appear.
Et loca earum sunt post Aures in duobus locis depressis capitis.	 The places [of incision] are after the ears, in two depressed locations on the head.
Quaere ergo eas digito tuo, et ubi sentis pulsum earum sub digito tuo, illic signa cum encaustro.	 Therefore, seek them with your finger, and where you feel its pulsation under your finger, mark that spot with the hot iron [cautery].
Deinde accipe phlebotomum cultellarem, et est ille qui dicitur Incidens.	 Then take the phlebotomous knife, and it is called "The Cutter".
Deinde intromitte ipsum sub uena in cute, donec perueniat phlebotomus ad os.	 Then introduce it [the knife] under the vein into the skin, until the phlebotomist reaches the bone.
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum uena et cute ad superiora, et incide uenam cum cute incisione incidente.	 Then move your hand with the vein and skin upwards, and cut the vein along with the skin incision.
Et sit longitudo incisionis quantitas duorum digitorum iunctorum, aut circiter illud: et fac exire ex sanguine quantum uis.	 And let the length of the incision be the size of two fingers joined together, or about that much: and make as much blood flow out as you wish.
Deinde stringe eam cum puluillis, et dimitte eam, donec sanetur.	 Then tie it [the cut vein] with threads, and let it be, until it heals.

¶ De phlebotomia duarum Arteriarum in timporibus.	 Chapter on phlebotomy of two Arteries in Time.
Duarum uero Arteriarum quae sunt in duobus timporibus phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad hemigraneam antiquam: et sodam prauam, et obtalmiam assiduam: et cursum superfluitatum effusarum acutarum ad oculos.	 However, the phlebotomy of the two arteries that are in the two times of bleeding, is an aid to old hemigraine, and sodam prawa, and obtalmia assidua: and to the flow of superfluidity discharged acutely towards the eyes.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eas est secundum quod narro tibi.	 And the quality of phlebotomy [of these arteries] is as I have told you.
Stringat infirmus collum suum multum, donec appareant duae uenae sensui apparitione manifesta: et demonstretur pulsus earum sub digito tuo.	 Let the sick person tightly wrap his neck until two veins appear to the senses with clear evidence, and their pulse is shown under your finger.
Tunc enim signa cum encaustro.	 Then mark that spot with hot iron [cautery].
Deinde eleua cutem desuper uenam ad superiora cum digito tuo indice, et intromitte phlebotomum incidentem desubtus, et eleua uenam ad superiora.	 Then move the skin above the vein upwards with your finger as an indicator, and introduce the phlebotomous knife [cutting] from below, and move the vein upwards.
Et incide eam, sicut fecisti in duabus uenis aliis: et fac currere ex sanguine secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	 And cut it [the vein], as you did with the two other veins: and make blood flow out according to your need.
Deinde solue coartationem infirmi, et pone digitum tuum super uenam hora una.	 Then release the restriction of the sick person, and place your finger on the vein at the first hour.
Postea pone super ipsam cotum et puluillos, et stringe ipsum desuper constrictione forti: et dimitte ipsam, donec sanetur.	 Then place a ligature and bandages over it, and bind it tightly with a strong binding; release it when it is healed.

¶ De phlebotomia uenae frontis post phlebotomiam Cephalicae.	 Chapter on venesection in the forehead after cephalic venesection.
Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae uenae frontis est post phlebotomiam Cephalicae, ad aegritudines faciei antiquas: et ad hemigraneam, et rubedinem: et ulcera foeda.	 Indeed, the benefit of venesection in the forehead after cephalic venesection is for ancient facial diseases, and for hemi-cranium, and redness, and foul ulcers.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, secundum quod narro tibi.	 And the quality of this venesection, as I have told you.
Coartet infirmus collum suum cum uitta, donec appareat uena.	 The sick man binds his neck with a bandage until the vein appears.
Deinde accipe instrumentum quod nominatur Fossorium.	 Then take the instrument called "Fossorium".
Cuius haec est forma.	 This is its form: (description of the shape and construction of the fossorium instrument follows)
Pone acumen eminens quod est in capite Fossorii super ipsam uenam, et percute super ipsum cum pectine, aut cum re alia in modo eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere secundum quantitatem quam uis.	 Place the pointed end that is at the head of the Fossorium on the vein and strike it with a hammer or another tool in the same manner; release the blood to flow according to the quantity you desire.
Deinde solue perforationem infirmi, et stringe eam, donec sanetur.	 Then release the perforation of the sick person and bind it until it is healed.
Et quandoque aperitur cum phlebotomo lato.	 And sometimes when the venesection is performed with a wide instrument (such as a vein cutter).
Verumtamen non oportet, ut sit phlebotomus acutae extremitatis, sicut reliqui phlebotomi, imo sit latae extremitatis.	 However, it is not necessary for the venesection instrument to have a sharp point, unlike the other venesection instruments, but rather one with a wide end.
Et phlebotoma eam secundum transuersionem: quoniam os est propinquum: et fortasse in eo frangetur phlebotomus quando est subtilis.	 And the venesection should be made across (transversely), because the bone is nearby; and perhaps the venesection instrument may break when it is too sharp.
¶ De phlebotomia Venarum in duobus Lachrymalibus.	 Chapter on venesection of veins in the two tear ducts.
Iuuamentum autem duarum Venarum quae sunt in duobus Lachrymalibus duorum oculorum, est ad oculum ex scabie et rubedine: et sebel in oculo, et aegritudinibus faciei.	 Indeed, the benefit of the two veins that are in the two tear ducts of the two eyes, is for the eye affected by scabies and redness; swelling of the eye, and facial diseases.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae earum est, ut stringat infirmus collum suum cum uitta.	 The quality of phlebotomy is that it binds a weak neck with a plaster.
Deinde phlebotoma eas: et tu sis stans super caput eius.	 Then the blood-letting shall be done: and thou shalt stand over his head.
Et fiat phlebotomia secundum transuersum ad longitudinem parum, cum phlebotomo paruo, lato parumper, nam in loco non est caro.	 And the blood-letting shall be done across, less than long, with a small phlebotome, narrower but not too much, for there is no flesh in that place.
Si enim phlebotomus est subtilis extremitatis, fortasse frangitur.	 For if the phlebotome is sharp at the tip, it may break.
Deinde fac currere ex sanguine quantum est tibi necesse.	 Then make him run with as much blood as necessary for you.
Et pone super eas cotum, et stringe eas nocte una, et solue eas.	 And place upon them a cloth, and bind them at night, and loosen them.
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Nasi.	 Chapter on the blood-letting of the veins of the nose.
Venae autem Nasi phlebotomia, est conferens ad febrem acutam, et sodam uehementem, et aegritudines faciei, sicut hemigraneam, et rubedinem quae accidit in facie: praecipue quando est antiqua.	 The veins of the nose for blood-letting are useful for acute fever, severe inflammation of the face, and diseases of the face such as hemigraine and redness that occurs on the face, especially when it is old.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringat infirmus collum suum.	 The quality of phlebotomy in this case is to tighten a weak neck.
Deinde tene nasum eius manu tua sinistra, et accipe phlebotomum subtilem, longum: et fige eum in medio leporis ipsius, inter illud quod distinguit nasum secundum rectitudinem.	 Then hold his nose with your left hand and take a fine, long lancet. Insert it in the middle of the leprosy itself, between that which separates the nose according to its alignment.
Quoniam uena non apparet sensui illic, et quia sanguis incipit fluere statim.	 Since the vein is not visible there and because blood begins to flow immediately.
Et oportet, ut ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo parumper: et facias currere ex sanguine secundum necessitatem tuam.	 And it is necessary that your hand with the lancet be slightly curved; and make the blood flow according to your need.
Deinde liga ipsam nocte una.	 Then bind it (the wound) overnight.
Ipsa enim restauratur uelociter.	 For it heals quickly.
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Guidegi.	 Chapter on the phlebotomy of veins (by Guidon).
Duarum uero Guidegi phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad constrictionem anhelitus, et incaeptionem leprae, et aegritudines melancholicas, et impetiginem et ulcera mala, et corrodentibus, id est, herpetibus estiomenis.	 The advantage of the two phlebotomies by Guidon is for constriction of the breath, and the onset of leprosy, and melancholic illnesses, and impetigo and bad ulcers, and those that are destructive (or corroding), that is, herpes or scabies.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae earum est ut stringat infirmus sub utrisque in collo suo cum ligamento: et stet artifex super caput infirmi, et infirmus sit sedens super sedem.	 And the quality of their phlebotomy is to tighten a weak person under both necks with a band; and the operator stands over the head of the sick person, and the sick person sits on a chair.
Deinde phlebotoma uenam ad longitudinem phlebotomia ampla parumper.	 Then the lancet should be about half the length of a wider phlebotomy (lancet).
Deinde extrahe ex sanguine quantitatem temperatam, aut secundum illud quod uides ex necessitate quae est ad illud.	 Then draw out an amount of blood that is weighed according to what you see, or according to the necessity that is at hand.
Deinde fac similiter de uena alia.	 Then do the same with another vein.
Postea solue ligamentum, et stringe duas uenas strictura media: ut non praefocetur infirmus.	 Then untie the band and tighten both veins with a strap so that the sick person does not suffocate.
Et dimitte eam usque mane.	 And let it be for the morning.
Sanatur enim uulnus.	 The wound heals.
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Algeberich.	 Chapter on the phlebotomy of veins (by Albucasis).
Venae autem Algeberich phlebotomiae iuuamentum est: quia confert ad alcolam in ore, et corruptionem gingiuae: et ulcera mala: et fissuras labiorum, et ulcera mala, etiam quae sunt in naso, et in circumitu eius.	 The advantage of the veins according to Albugasis is because it contributes to alcohol in the mouth and corruption of the gums; and bad ulcers; and cracks in the lips; and bad ulcers, even those that are in the nose, and around it.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae earum est, ut facias sedere infirmum coram te: et stringe collum eius cum uitta.	 And the quality of phlebotomy for them is that you make the sick person sit before you: and bind his neck with a bandage.
Deinde reuolue labium eius, et aspice ad duas uenas: quarum una est a dextera labii, et secunda a sinistra eius: et demonstratio utriusque est per nigredinem ambarum.	 Then roll up his lip and look at the two veins: one of which is from the right side of the lip, and the second from its left side: and the demonstration of both is by their blackness.
Et illud uerum est: quia in circumitu earum sunt uenae minutae, nigrae.	 And that is true because around them there are small, dark veins.
Incide ergo utramque incisione incidente.	 Therefore make an incision on both sides.
Si autem dubitatio est super te, et non scis quae earum est: tunc intende ad incisionem maioris earum, et ipsarum manifestiorem.	 If there is doubt about it and you do not know which one it is: then direct your attention to the larger of them, and its more visible.
Et similiter fac de duabus uenis quae sunt in labio superiore: et plurimum quidem currit consuetudo cum eo: et incide duas uenas quae sunt in labio inferiori.	 And similarly do with the two veins that are in the upper lip: and most commonly it is done with this one: and make an incision on the two veins which are in the lower lip.
¶ De phlebotomia Venae sub lingua post Cephalicae phlebotomiam.	 Chapter of Phlebotomy: The Vein under the Tongue after the Phlebotomy of the Head.
Duarum uero Venarum quae sunt sub lingua phlebotomiae iuuamentum: est, quod phlebotomia Cephalicae est ad praefocationes quae sunt in gutture, et aegritudinem uuulae, et aegritudines oris.	 But the advantage of the two veins that are under the tongue for phlebotomy is because phlebotomy of the head is for afflictions that are in the throat, and the illness of the larynx, and the illnesses of the mouth.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eas est, ut sedeat infirmus inter manus tuas coram sole: et eleualinguam eius, et aspice sub lingua a latere eius uno uenam, et a latere eius alio uenam: et color utriusque decliuis ad nigredinem.	 And the quality of phlebotomizing them is that the sick person should sit between your hands facing the sun: and lengthen his tongue, and look under the tongue on one side to find a vein, and on its other side to find another vein: and the color of each becomes dark.
Phlebotoma ergo utramque: et custodi, ne ultimes manum tuam in phlebotomando eas.	 Therefore make an incision on both sides: and beware that you do not go too deep when phlebotomizing them.
Nam sub eius sunt arteriae, et fortasse accidet fluxus sanguinis ex illis arteriis.	 For there are arteries under it, and perhaps bleeding may occur from those arteries.
¶ De tribus Venis in cubito.	 Chapter of the Three Veins on the Arm.
Venae autem tres quae phlebotomantur in cubito, sunt in quarum phlebotomia cucurrit consuetudo in omnibus hominibus.	 The three veins that are phlebotomized on the arm, those whose phlebotomy is commonly done in all men.
Et phlebotomia earum fit secundum duos modos.	 And phlebotomy [is done] according to two modes.
Aut pungendo cum phlebotomo myrtino lato: aut oliuari ad subtilitatem decliui: aut secando cum phlebotomo cultellari, et est Alnesil.	 Either by pricking with a broad leech (myrtio largo): or by cupping to the subtlety of the vein (oliuando ad subtilitatem decliuis): or cutting with a surgical knife (secando cum phlebotomo cultellari), and it is called Alnesil.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its form.
Sic Alnesil est, quod conuenit ad sectionem.	 Thus, Alnesil [is] that which [concerns] cutting.
Et ex eis sunt species latae, et subtiles secundum amplitudinem uenarum et stricturam earum Forma phlebotomi myrtini sit lata, sicut uides.	 And from these [are] the broad and subtle forms according to the width and tightness of the veins. The form of leeching (phlebotomi myrtini) is broad, as you see.
Et conuenit ad aperiendas uenas concauas, plenas, procedentes, apparentes, grossas, et illas quae continent sanguinem grossum, turbidum.	 It [concerns] opening concave veins, full, protruding, visible, thick ones, and those that contain thick, turbid blood.
Et iste phlebotomus est minoris latitudinis, et subtilioris extreminatis.	 And this leech [is] smaller in width and more subtle for veins that are more superficial.
Et conuenit ad phlebotomiam uenarum subtilium, quae continent sanguinem subtilem citrinum	 It [concerns] the leeching of subtle veins that contain fine yellow blood.
¶ De phlebotomia Basilicae.	 Chapter on leeching (phlebotomia) in the basilica.
Basilicae autem quae est una harum trium uenarum phlebotomiae iuuamentum est.	 The basilica, which is one of the three veins for leeching, provides aid.
Quia extrahit sanguinem ex aegritudinibus, quae sunt sub gutture et collo, ex eo quod sequitur pectus, et uentrem: et conuenit phlebotomatori cum phlebotomat eam, ut caueat, et sit super timorem ex ea nam sub ea est arteria.	 Because it draws blood from the ailments that are below the throat and neck, following the chest and abdomen; it [is] necessary for the leecher to know this vein, so as to be careful about it, because under it is an artery.
Si ergo errat, et addit in punctura phlebotomi, incidet illam arteriam, et accidet fluxus sanguinis.	 Therefore, if there is an error and blood is drawn by pricking with a leech, he will cut the artery, and bleeding will occur.
Quapropter oportet, ne phlebotomet eam cum phlebotomo pungente: imo sit secans cum Alnesil.	 Therefore, it is necessary for the leecher not to prick her with a leech; instead, he should cut with a surgical knife (Alnesil).
Quod si non apparet Basilica apparitione manifesta, tunc oportet, ut alienes ipsam, et permuteris ad aliam, aut quaeras aliquem ramum eius: aut phlebotomes loco eius Funem brachii.	 If the basilica does not appear in a clear manifestation, then it is necessary to search for another or to exchange it for another; or to seek a branch of it; or to use a leech on its place, instead of an arm (Funem brachii).
Ipsa enim est manifesta, et seca eam cum phlebotomo Anesil, sicut diximus.	 It is indeed apparent; cut it as Phlebotomus Anesil did, as we said.
Si autem uis phlebotomiam ipsius eiusdem, tunc oportet ante stricturam brachii, ut tangas locum, donec cognoscas locum pulsus.	 If you wish to perform phlebotomy (bloodletting) on it, then it is necessary before the tightening of the arm, that you touch the place, until you recognize the location of the pulse.
Deinde signa super locum cum encaustro, postea brachium, et seca uenam sectione concaua cum phlebotomo Alnesil, sicut diximus.	 Then mark the place with hot iron, afterwards the arm, and cut the vein with a concave-shaped knife as Phlebotomus Alnesil did, as we said.
Et caue ne cadat percussio per spacium a loco arteriae.	 And beware that the blow does not fall in the space from the place of the artery.
Et quando uides, cum tu stringis ligamen, inflationem in loco quem signasti cum encaustro, tunc illa inflatio est inflatio arteriae: deuita ergo eam.	 And when you see, while tightening the bandage, an inflammation at the place which you marked with hot iron, then that inflation is of the artery; avoid it (the blood vessel) therefore.
Quod si uides sanguinem apud phlebotomiam salire, sicut urina pueri, et est sanguis subtilis, rubeus: tunc scias, quia est ex sanguine arteriae.	 If you see blood rising at the site of bloodletting, like the urine of a boy, and it is thin, red; then know that it is from the artery's blood.
Tunc ergo propera, et pone digitum tuum super ipsum spacio longo, deinde aufer digitum tuum.	 Therefore advance, and place your finger upon it over a long space, afterwards remove your finger.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis (multotiens namque abscinditur) tunc stringe brachium, et dimitte ipsum: et caueat infirmus a motione eius: et sit super timorem eius.	 If blood is cut (for it is often cut), then tighten the arm and leave it alone; let the weak avoid movement of it; and beware of fear of it.
Et non moueat ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	 And do not move it for a few days until it is healed.
Si autem non abscinditur sanguis, et uincit te: et non est tibi praesens in momento tuo medicina, tunc incide arteriam, si apparet tibi.	 If blood is not cut and it overwhelms you, and medicine is not present at hand for you in the moment; then cut the artery, if it appears to you.
Nam extremitates eius contrahuntur, et abscinditur sanguis.	 For its extremities contract, and blood is cut off.
Aut accipe corticem fistici, et finde eum: accipe medietatem unam, et stringe eam super locum uenae strictura decenti, cum ligamento et puluillis usque ad diem alium.	 Or take the bark of the fig tree, and pound it; take one half, and tie it over the place of the vein tightening with a bandage and small stones until another day.
Tunc si abscinditur sanguis, est bonum.	 Then if blood is cut, it is good (meaning the treatment was successful).
Et si non: tunc cura ipsum cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio ex loco puluerum abscindentium fluxum sanguinis: et abscisio sanguinis eius non est difficilis in pluribus dispositionibus, propter locum paruum uulneris, et possibilitatem ligamenti ex brachio.	If not (the case): then treat the same person with whom the one who preceded it is remembered, from the place of the dusts causing blood flow abscission; and the bleeding's abscission is not difficult in many dispositions, due to the small size of the wound, and the possibility of tying (ligament) from the arm.
¶ De phlebotomia uenae Fuscae.	 On the phlebotomy of the Green Vein.
Venae autem Fuscae phlebotomiae iuuamentum est, quod trahit sanguinem ex superiori parte capitis, et inferiore corporis: propterea, quia est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae, sicut diximus.	 The phlebotomy of the Green Vein is helpful because it draws blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body; because it is composed of a branch of the Basilica vein and the Branch of the Cephalic, as we have said.
Et conuenit phlebotomanti eam, ut sit super timorem ex phlebotomia eius, nam sub ea est neruus.	 It is suitable for the phlebotomist to be aware of this vein, because of fear from its phlebotomy, since there is a nerve beneath it.
Si ergo addit in punctura phlebotomi, et inuenit neruum, accidit in ea stupor, et difficilis fit sanatio eius, et fortasse non sanatur penitus.	 Therefore, if the phlebotomist adds in piercing and finds a nerve in it, a stupor occurs, and healing becomes difficult, and possibly it is not completely healed.
Et iste neruus multotiens apparet sensui.	 And this nerve often appears to sensation.
Si autem occultatur in quibusdam hominibus, et est subtilis, et non ostenditur: tunc oportet ut ponas phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas, sectionem cum Alnesil, et deuita neruum cum fortitudine tua.	 If it is hidden in some people and is subtle and not shown, then you must place your phlebotomy where you phlebotomize it, the section with Alnesil, and avoid the nerve with your strength.
Quod si uena est inter duos neruos, tunc finde uenam in longitudine.	 If the vein is between two nerves, then cut the vein lengthwise.
¶ De uena Cephalica.	 On the Cephalic Vein.
Phlebotomiae autem uenae Cephalicae iuuamentum est, quia attrahit sanguinem ex capite, et confert ad aegritudines oculorum.	 The phlebotomy of the Cephalic Vein is helpful because it draws blood from the head, and contributes to eye diseases.
Et oportet in hac uena proprie, si uis, ut phlebotomes eam pungendo cum phlebotomo oliuari, aut cum phlebotomo myrtino: quoniam est saluior uenarum omnium, quoniam non est subea arteria, neque neruus.	 It is appropriate in this vein that the phlebotomist be anointed with oil or myrrh before piercing it, since it is safer than all veins because it is not below an artery nor a nerve.
Verumtamen conuenit tibi apud phlebotomiam, ut deuites cum phlebotomo caput lacerti tantum, et quaeras locum leniorem: et non nocet ei, si non inuenitur cum percussione prima, ut iteretur super eam cum phlebotomia aliquotiens.	 It is fitting for you when you perform venesection (phlebotomy), to ask the barber-surgeon to take only the head of the vein, and to seek a softer place; it does not harm him if no such place is found with the first blow, that he may repeat over it several times with venesection.
Verumtamen fortasse apostematur in quibusdam hominibus quando non phlebotomatur in percussione prima, sed non nocet ei illud apostema in aliquo.	 Perhaps some men may have a haematoma when not venesection is performed on the first blow, but it does not harm him if such a haematoma occurs somewhere.
¶ De utilitate Phlebotomiae, et cautelis in ea obseruandis.	 On the utility of Venesection and the precautions to be observed.
Qualitas autem Phlebotomiae, et accidentia eius ex ea, in cuius rectificatione oportet te cogitare.	 The qualities and circumstances of Venesection and their correction, which you should consider.
Primum ergo illius est de quo oportet ut scias, quod phlebotomia non administratur, nisi in conseruatione sanitatis, et perseuerantia eius, et cautela ab aduentu aegritudinum.	 First of all, you should know that venesection is not administered unless for the conservation of health and its continuance, and caution against the approach of diseases.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in una uenarum trium quae sunt in cubito, scilicet Cephalica, et Fusca, et Basilica.	 And that venesection should be performed in one of the three veins that are in the elbow, namely the Cephalic, the Radial (Fusca), and the Median (Basilic).
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in principio Veris super ieiunium, in uere, et aestate: et autumno, et hyeme post comestionem, quando apparent significationes repletionis.	 And that venesection should be performed at the beginning of spring on fasting days, in summer and autumn after food consumption, when signs of overfullness appear.
Et fiat phlebotomia in die primo, aut in tertio, postquam praeterierint de die tres horae.	 And that venesection should be performed on the first or third day after three hours have passed.
Phlebotomia autem quae administratur in aegritudinibus, non habet horam determinatam: sed quando prouocat conuenientia et necessitas ad illud, in nocte, aut die, et in omni hora, et in omni tempore.	 Venesection that is administered in diseases has no fixed hour; but when it is necessary and suitable for such a purpose, it may be done at night or day, and at any hour, and at any time.
Et non oportet, ut phlebotomentur pueri, donec ueniant super eos quatuordecim anni.	 It is not necessary to perform venesection on boys until they reach the age of fourteen.
Neque phlebotometur mulier praegnans, nisi a mense quarto usque ad septimum.	 Venesection should not be performed on pregnant women except from the fourth month up to the seventh.
Neque phlebotomentur senes, qui iam pertransierunt sexaginta annos.	 Venesection should not be performed on old men who have already passed sixty years of age.
Cum ergo aliquis uult phlebotomari propter quemcumque modum sit: oportet, ut mundificet intestina sua ante phlebotomiam cum clisteri leni, si in eis est stercus multum retentum: ut non attrahant uenae apud phlebotomiam ex intestinis superfluitates putridas nocentes membris principalibus.	 When anyone wishes to be bled for any reason: it is necessary, that he cleans his intestines before bleeding with a mild purge, if there is much fecal matter retained in them: so that no putrid superfluities from the intestines attract at the time of bleeding towards the principal members.
Neque phlebotometur patiens toctina, id est, satietatem nauseatiuam: neque crapulatus, neque euadens ab ebrietate, donec remoueatur illud ab eis.	 A patient should not be bled when he is afflicted with toctina (or satiety of nausea), nor when he is vomiting or still under the influence of drunkenness, until that has passed.
Neque infirmus cum hydropisi.	 A person suffering from dropsy should not be bled.
Et caueatur phlebotomia iterum post colicam passionem, et uomitum, et fluxum uentris, et multiplicationem coitus, et laboris, et exercitii, et uigiliarum, et ieiunii, et omnis quod dissoluit uirtutem ex re corporea aut animali.	 Be careful about bleeding again after a colic attack, vomiting, diarrhea, increase in sexual activity, labor, exercise, vigils, fasting, or any substance that weakens the body's strength from either a material or an animal source.
Deinde considera in subtilitate humorum ante illud, si sanguis est grossus cum cibis et potibus, et medicinis: si possibile est ei illud.	 Then take into account the subtlety of humors before doing this, if the blood is thick with food and drinks, and medications; if it is possible for him to do so.
Deinde introeat balneum, si non prohibet ipsum aliquid: aut exercitetur aliquo exercitio, ut subtilietur sanguis.	 Then let a bath be entered, if nothing prevents it; or exercise with some exercise, to make the blood subtle.
Et pone phlebotomiam eius in pectore, circa tertiam diei, sicut diximus: et conare, ut euacuetur pectus eius illa die ex omnibus accidentibus animalibus malis: sicut angustia, et ira, et timor: et ex omnibus accidentibus corporeis, sicut labor, et poena, et superfluicoitus, et illis similia.	 Place the bleeding of this person on his chest, about the third day, as we said earlier; and try to have him evacuate his chest that day from all bad animal conditions such as anxiety, anger, fear; and all bodily conditions such as labor, punishment, superfluities, and similar ones.
Et sedi suae faciat esse praesentes res cum quarum usu cucurrit consuetudo hominum ex aromaticitate, et odoramento, et tripudio et similibus illis per quantitatem possibilitatis.	 And let him have present the things for which customary use among humans is from their aromatics, scents, incenses, and similar ones, according to his ability.
Deinde sedeat phlebotomator super puluinari, quod sit altius quam puluinar phlebotomandi: postea extrahat brachium suum, et fricet ipsum phlebotomator manu sua bis, aut ter.	 Then let the person who is bleeding sit on a stool (puluinari), which should be higher than the stool for bleeding; then he shall draw out his arm and rub it with his hand by the bleeding person two or three times.
Deinde stringat ligamentum cum corrigia, et inuoluat eam bis.	 Then tie the ligament with a suture and roll it twice.
Et sit strictura temperata, quoniam strictura quando est inaequalis, aut per superfluitatem in strictura, tunc prohibet cursum sanguinis: aut in mollificatione, tunc etiam prohibet cursum sanguinis.	 And let the constriction be moderate, because an unequal constriction, either by excess in constriction, then it prevents the flow of blood; or in softening, then it also prevents the flow of blood.
Deinde post stricturam oportet, ut fricet phlebotomandus manus suas simul adinuicem, donec inflentur uenae, et declarentur sensui.	 Then, after the constriction, the one who performs venesection should rub his hands together until the veins swell up and become visible to the touch.
Deinde abstergat phlebotomator phlebotomum cum pauco oleo, antiquo proprie.	 Then the one who performs venesection cleans the lancet with a little oil, using an ancient method.
Deinde ponat digitum suum indicem manus sinistrae super ipsam uenam sub loco cuius phlebotomiam uult, parum: ut non fugiat uena, et cassetur percussio.	 Then he should place his index finger of the left hand on top of the vein at the location where he wishes to make the venesection, slightly: so that the vein does not run away and the blow is cushioned.
Quoniam ex uenis est quam inuenis sicut chordam fugientem apud phlebotomiam: et ex eis est quae est plena uentositate: et quando ponis phlebotomum super eam, contrahitur sub phlebotomo, et decipitur phlebotomator, et non aperit phlebotomus uenam: et si aperit eam, est stricta: propter illud ergo oportet, ut firmetur phlebotomator, et sit sollicitus in his rebus omnibus.	 Because the veins are like a string escaping during venesection; and some of them are filled with wind; and when you place the lancet on it, it contracts under the lancet, deceiving the one who performs venesection, and he does not open the vein; and if he opens it, it is constricted: therefore for this reason the one who performs venesection should be firm and careful in all these matters.
Deinde deponat phlebotomum.	 Then place the lancet down.
Si ergo aperitur uena ex uice una, tunc bonum est.	 If one vein is opened by chance, then it is good.
Et si non, tunc itera illud uice alia sub illo loco parum, aut supra ipsum cum festinatione: si non apostematur locus.	 And if not, then try again with another vein in the same place slightly, or above it with haste: if the place is not missed.
Quod si apostematur, aut expauescit infirmus, tunc dimitte eum die, aut duobus diebus: et non stringat ligamentum.	 If the place is missed or if the weak person faints, then let him go home for a day or two; and do not tie the ligament.
Fortasse enim attrahet apostema calidum.	 Perhaps it will attract an abscess that is hot.
Neque ingrediatur balneum.	 Do not enter the bath.
Deinde iteret phlebotomiam, si amat.	 Then repeat the venesection, if needed.
Quod si apertio est parua, aut currit sanguis subtiliter: et times ut non egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uis: tunc itera phlebotomum in foramine ipso secundum rectitudinem, et adde in operatione parum.	 If the opening is small, or blood flows finely: fear lest not the quantity of blood that you wish does not exit; then repeat the venesection in the same hole correctly, and add less in the operation.
Et fac illud cum festinatione, antequam apostemetur locus, apostematus enim locus est in multis hominibus apud operationem paruam.	 And do this with haste before the place is opened, because the opened place is dangerous for many people during small operations.
Si ergo uides ipsum iam apostematum, tunc non iteres super ipsum omnino, non enim excusat apud te aliquid.	 If therefore you see that the place has already been opened, then do not go over it at all; for nothing can be excused by you in this case.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex faece olei: quoniam alleuiat cursum sanguinis.	 And put something of oil paste on top of it, because it alleviates the flow of blood.
Et est melior in hoc loco quam oleum ipsum, et quam reliqua olea.	 And oil is better than this place and than any other oil.
Et similiter administra faecem olei in omni phlebotomia tua, qua phlebotomas uenas apud prohibitionem cursus sanguinis: et faciunt illud tyriaca alfarach, et sagzenea, quando ponitur ex una earum super locum.	 And similarly administer oil paste in every venesection of your own, where the flow of blood is forbidden; and do this as the Tyrian alfarach and Sagzenea when it is placed over the place.
Sanguis enim subtiliatur et resoluitur, quando est grossus.	 Blood becomes thin and dissolves when it is thick.
Quod si accidat in loco phlebotomiae apostema magnum, nam multotiens accidit, praecipue ei qui non est phlebotomatus nisi uice illa, aut est apertio uenae parua, tunc propera et pone super locum spongiam infusam in aqua et sale, calefacta parumper: et stringe eam hora una: quoniam soluitur.	 If by chance a large abscess occurs at the place of venesection, which often happens especially to those who are not venesectionists except for that occasion, or if the opening of the vein is small; then hurry and put on top of it a sponge soaked in water and salt, warmed slightly: and squeeze it for an hour; because it is dissolved.
Et oportet, ut facias illud post exitum sanguinis ex uena ipsa, cum complemento sui, aut ex uena alia.	 And it is necessary that you do this after the blood has left from the vein itself, when its end has been reached, or from another vein.
Quod si remanet in loco post dies aliquid nigredinis, aut uiriditatis, non nocet illud: et si uis, pone super ipsum aliquid aloe, aut myrrhae solutorum: aut aliquid ex succo menthastri, id est, calamenti aut simile illius.	 If something black or green remains at the place after days; it does not hurt it; and if you want, put on top of it something of aloes or myrrh dissolved: or something of mint juice, that is, camphor or similar to it.
Et multotiens quidem accidunt apostemata et eminentiae apud phlebotomiam Basilicae.	 And indeed, ulcers and swellings often occur near veins during venesection in the Basilica.
Pone ergo manum tuam super ipsam, tunc si inuenis molliciem apud compressionem tuam super ipsam, tunc illa eminentia est mala.	 Place your hand upon it (the swelling), then if you find softness under your pressure upon it, then that swelling is evil.
Caue ergo, ut ponas super eam aliquid ex eo quod diximus.	 Therefore, be careful, lest you place anything on it of what I have said.
Nam fortasse fluet ex ea sanguis arteriae.	 For perhaps blood from an artery will flow from it.
Sed fac emplastrum ei cum eo in quo est stipticitas, ut induretur locus.	 But make an ointment for it with what is mentioned there (the recipe) to harden the place.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with the rest of the treatment until it is healed.
Et oportet, ut extrahas omni homini ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis suae.	 And it is necessary, that you draw blood from every man according to the amount of its virtue.
Et quod apparet ex colore uincente super sanguinem.	 And what appears as a red color spreading over the blood (disseminated intravascular coagulation).
Nam sanguis si est niger, tunc dimitte ipsum exire, donec rubeat: et similiter si uides ipsum grossum: tunc dimitte eum, donec subtilietur: et similiter si est acutus, donec auferatur acuitas eius.	 For if the blood is black, then let it come out until it turns red; and similarly, if you see it thick, let it go until it becomes thin; and similarly, if it is sharp (hematocrit), let it go until its sharpness disappears.
Et oportet ei qui est plenus, fortis, et indiget extractione sanguinis uice una, ut amplificetur phlebotomia uenae, et sit phlebotomus latus: et in eo qui est debilis, sit econtrario illius.	 And it is necessary that the one who is full, strong, and requires bloodletting by one vein, amplify venesection of the vein and be a competent bloodletter; and on the contrary, for the one who is weak, the opposite should hold.
Et oportet, ut extrahat ipsum in uicibus, et ut sit foramen strictum: et melius quod administratur in phlebotomia uenae est, ut sit transuersa sectio, non punctura.	 And it is necessary, that you draw it (blood) in the intervals (between veins), and that the opening be narrow; and it is better what is administered in venesection of the vein, that it is a transverse section, not a puncture.
Et iste modus phlebotomiae est saluus a fluxu sanguinis, et ab incisione nerui: et est laudabilior, et saluior quam phlebotomia per latitudinem et longitudinem.	 And this method of bloodletting is beneficial in preventing the flow of blood and incising a nerve; and it is more commendable and safer than bloodletting by length and width (venesection).
Et cui consueuit peruenire apud phlebotomiam syncopis, oportet ut cibes ante phlebotomiam modico pane infuso in aqua granati muzi: aut secaniabin, si est calefactus: et extrahas ei ex sanguine in tribus uicibus, aut quatuor.	 And who is accustomed to faint during bloodletting, it is necessary that he eat before bloodletting a little bread soaked in water of muskmelon or ginger; or if he is heated, let him be cooled; and draw blood from him in three intervals or four.
Et si est infrigidatae complexionis, tunc accipiat ante phlebotomiam panem infusum in syrupo miua, aut in syrupo de melle aromatizato cum speciebus, aut in syrupo aromatizato odorifero.	 If it is of cold constitution, then let him receive before phlebotomy bread soaked in syrup of honey and myrrh, or in syrup sweetened with scented honey and spices, or in scented and fragrant syrup.
Quod si accidat syncopis apud phlebotomiam, et est caussa eius exitus sanguinis multi: tunc oportet, ut sumat in potu aquam carnis, et syrupum odoriferum subtilem: et utatur aromaticitate cum algalia, et liniatur pectus eius cum ea: et utatur reliquis quae diximus in diuisione in capitulo syncopis ex euacuatione.	 If syncope occurs during phlebotomy, and the cause of it is excessive bleeding: then it is necessary that he drinks meat broth, and subtle scented syrup; and let him use aromatics with algalia (a plant or seaweed), and let his chest be swabbed with it; and let him use the remedies mentioned in our previous discussion on syncope due to evacuation.
Qui autem uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo: oportet ei cuius phlebotomia est propter euacuationem multam, et uirtus eius est debilis, ut soluat sanguinem paulatim per quantitatem uirtutis in diebus continuis.	 Whoever wishes to dislocate his arm and let out blood in the second way: it is necessary for him, whose phlebotomy is for great evacuation, and the strength of his constitution is weak, to let out blood gradually by amount of strength day after day.
Qui uero uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo, et est corpus eius forte: tunc faciat illud post septem horas, aut nouem a phlebotomia sua prima.	 But whoever wishes to dislocate his arm and let out blood in the second way, and his body is strong: then he shall do it after seven or nine hours from his first phlebotomy.
Qui autem uult attrahere sanguinem ex corpore suo ad contrarium partis ad quam declinat: oportet ut euentetur ei in die secundo, aut in tertio.	 But whoever wishes to attract blood from his body towards the opposite part where it tends: then let it be dislocated for him on the second or third day.
In cuius uero corpore est sanguis multus iam calefactus, et acuitur, et facit accidere febrem: oportet, ut egrediatur ex eo sanguis in uice una, et extrahatur ex eo quantitas multa: et amplificetur apertio usquequo accidat syncopis: postquam tu fueris conseruans omnes conditiones phlebotomiae: et ut ponas manum tuam super pulsum eius apud cursum sanguinis, ut non accidat mors loco syncopis.	 If there is much blood already heated and sharpened, and it causes a fever: then let the blood come out from him once, and a large quantity be extracted; and the opening should be kept as long as syncope occurs; after which you shall conserve all conditions of phlebotomy; and put your hand on his pulse during the flow of blood, to avoid death in place of syncope.
Multotiens enim accidit illud, quando ignorat phlebotomator, et cadit negligentia.	 For it often happens when the phlebotomist is ignorant and falls by negligence.
Et non oportet quando uis soluere brachium, et soluere sanguinem secundo, cum iam clausum sit orificium uenae, et fiat difficilis exitus sanguinis, ut prematur super ipsum cum uehementia, et curuatum extendatur uelociter.	 It is not appropriate when you wish to solve the arm, and to release the blood, when already the opening of the vein has been closed, and the exit of blood becomes difficult, that you press strongly upon it and quickly stretch out the cut vein.
Nam illud est malum ualde, imo dimitte ipsum, donec phlebotometur secundo.	 That is very bad indeed, rather let it be, until it is to be bled again with the lancet.
Aut remoue cum acuitate phlebotomi illud quod coagulatum est ex sanguine in orificio uenae, et pone super ipsum aliquid salis dissoluti in aqua.	 Either remove with the sharpness of a lancet what has been coagulated from the blood in the opening of the vein and place something dissolved in salt water upon it.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex tyriaca alfaroch, aut sagzenea, et pone ipsum compressione leni, donec egrediatur sanguis.	 And place upon it something from turpentine gum or aloes or sage, and press it gently until the blood comes out.
Si uero iam apostemata est uena, tunc dimitte eam, et non tegas eam, donec sedetur apostema.	 But if already the vein has become gangrenous, then let it be, and do not cover it up, until the gangrene subsides.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad soluendum sanguinem secundo, et non est excusatio, tunc aut phlebotoma ipsum supra illum locum, aut in brachio alio in uena alia.	 But if necessity calls for the releasing of blood again and there is no excuse, then either bleed that spot or bleed in another vein elsewhere in the arm.
Funis autem brachii phlebotomatur loco Fuscae, et Basilicae, cum non inueniuntur, et sunt occultae, quoniam est composita ex eis.	 The ligament of the arm is bled in the place of the Fuscus and the Basilicus, when these are not found and hidden because it is composed of these.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus manum suam in aqua calida, donec rubeat focile, et appareat uena manifeste.	 And the quality of bleeding from this ligament is that a weak person should insert his hand into warm water until it turns red and the vein appears clearly manifest.
Deinde stringatur super ipsam cum ligamento parum constrictione media.	 Then, a cord is tied over it with moderately tight tension.
Deinde phlebotoma secundum transuersationem paulatim, non latitudinaliter, neque secundum longitudinem: et sit apertio ampla, et sit phlebotomia tua qua eam phlebotomas super iuncturam manus parumper.	 Then the lancet is used for second bleeding obliquely gradually, not lengthwise or widthwise; and let the opening be wide, and let your lancing of it be on the junction of the hand slightly.
Quod si prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera manum in aqua calida, et dimitte sanguinem currere in aqua, donec consequaris necessitatem tuam.	 But if the exit of blood is forbidden, then insert your hand into warm water and let the blood flow into the water until you meet your need.
Si autem fueris in diebus aestatis, tunc excusaris ab iteratione manus in aqua calida.	 If you are in the days of summer, then you excuse from the repetition of hands in hot water.
Et plurimum quidem ponitur cursus sanguinis in aqua calida in tempore hyemis.	 Much is placed on the course of blood in hot water during winter.
Et phlebotomia huius uenae est saluior omnibus uenis, quoniam non est sub ea uena pulsatilis, neque neruus.	 And this vein's phlebotomy is safer than all other veins because it is not under a pulsating vein nor a nerve.
Phlebotomia uero Saluatellae manus dextrae, est conferens aegritudinibus epatis.	 Indeed, the phlebotomy of the right hand's little finger is beneficial for liver diseases.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringas mahason manus cum ligamento, aut manu tua, postquam tu intromittis eam in aquam calidam, donec infletur uena, et demonsteretur sensui ualde.	 And the quality of its phlebotomy is that you tie a leash to the hand with a ligature or with your hand after you insert it into hot water, until the vein swells and becomes very noticeable.
Deinde phlebotoma eam transuersando.	 Then the phlebotomy of it is made by crossing it (the cut).
Et si incidis eam totaliter, non nocebit ei illud in aliquo.	 And if you cut it completely, it will not hurt him at all.
Et conserua, ne ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo.	 Preserve (it), lest you cut off your hand with the phlebotomy.
Sub ea enim sunt nerui digitorum denudati ex carne.	 For under that are the nerves of the fingers exposed from the flesh.
Deinde itera manum ad aquam calidam, et dimitte currere sanguinem in ea.	 Then repeat the hand to hot water and let the blood run in it.
Nam si tu non iteras eam in aqua calida, coagulatur sanguis in orificio uenae, et prohibetur a cursu.	 For if you do not repeat it in hot water, the blood coagulates in the vein's opening and prevents its flow.
Cum ergo extraxeris ex sanguine quantitatem necessitatis, tunc pone super uenam oleum et sal: ut non consolidetur uelociter.	 Since when you remove blood in the required quantity, then place oil and salt on the vein so that it does not coagulate quickly.
Et similiter oportet, ut facias cum omni ramo stricto.	 And similarly, it is necessary to do this with every constricted branch.
Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae eius ex manu sinistra, est: quoniam est conferens ad aegritudines splenis: et similiter fac in phlebotomia eius, sicut fecisti in secunda aequaliter.	 But the aid of this vein's phlebotomy from the left hand is that it is beneficial for spleen diseases; and similarly, do as you did in the second one equally.
Saphenae autem phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad aegritudines quae sunt in inferiori parte corporis, sicut aegritudines matricum, et retentionem menstruorum, et infirmitates renum, et ulcera coxarum et crurium antiqua, et similia ex aegritudinibus.	 The phlebotomy of the saphenous vein is beneficial for diseases that are in the lower part of the body, such as diseases of the womb, retention of menstruation, and weaknesses of the kidneys, and old ulcers of the hips and legs, and similar ones from other diseases.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus pedem suum in aquam calidam: et faciat super ipsum fricationem, donec exuberent uenae: et liga supra iuncturam pedis cum corrigia.	 The quality of phlebotomy is such that the unhealthy one puts his foot into warm water: and he should make friction upon it until the veins swell: and tie above the joint of the foot with a ligature.
Et uenae quidem locus est apud calcaneum, apparens uersus pollicem: et ramificantur ex ea in facie pedis rami multi.	 The vein's location is at the heel, appearing toward the thumb: and they branch out from it on the face of the foot into many branches.
Phlebotoma ergo eam in ampliore ramo eius, aut apud calcaneum in aggregatione eius: quoniam est melius et saluius.	 Therefore, phlebotomy should be made in a larger branch of it, or at the heel in its aggregation: because it is better and safer.
Quod si phlebotomas eam in facie pedis, tunc caue a neruis qui sunt sub ea super faciem pedis.	 If phlebotomy is made on the face of the foot, then beware of the nerves that are under it on the surface of the foot.
Et pone phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas ex transuerso, quasi tu uelis incidere eam: et sit phlebotomus Nesil.	 And place your phlebotomy instrument perpendicularly, as if you wish to cut it: and the phlebotomist is Nesil.
Si autem prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera pedem eius in aqua calida: et dimitte sanguinem currere in eam, donec euacuatur.	 If the outlet of blood is forbidden, then immerse his foot in warm water: and let the blood flow into it until it is evacuated.
Quod si errat uenam phlebotomator in prima uice, tunc iteret cum phlebotomia ad superiora parumper, nam locus est saluus, et non times ex eo maliciam, quando tu caues a neruis, sicut diximus.	 If the phlebotomist errs in the first vein, then repeat with phlebotomy to the upper part slightly, for it is safe, and do not fear any harm from it, as long as you beware of the nerves, as we have said.
Et similiter cum Saphena pedis alterius aequaliter.	 And similarly, with the saphenous vein of the other foot equally.
Venae autem Sciaticae locus, sicut diximus, est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	 The location of the sciatic vein, as we have said, is at the heel from the forest side.
Et iuuamentum phlebotomiae eius est, ad dolorem anchae, quando est propter sanguinem calidum.	 And the benefit of phlebotomy is for pain in the ankle, when it is due to hot blood.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut ingrediatur infirmus balneum, et festinet: et stringe crus eius a latere anchae usque supra calcaneum quatuor digitis, cum uitta subtili longa: non enim apparet nisi propter illud.	 The quality of phlebotomy is such that the unhealthy one enters the bath and hurries: and bind the leg from the ankle to above the heel with a thin, long bandage, for it does not appear unless for this reason.
Quando ergo apparet, tunc phlebotoma eam secundum quodcumque ingenium est tibi possibile, aut secundum transuersionem: et est melius, aut ut incidas eam incisione, aut seces eam sectione.	 When it appears, then perform phlebotomy as possible for you, either according to the transverse method: and it is better, or make an incision into her, or cut her off with a section.
Locus enim eius est saluior, et ipsa est in pluribus hominibus occulta ualde.	 The place of this is safer, and it is very hidden in many people.
Quod si non inuenis eam, et non apparet sensui omnino: tunc phlebotoma aliquem ramum eius, et est ille qui apparet in dorso pedis, et uersus auricularem: et caue a neruis, et fac currere ex sanguine quantitatem quam uis.	 If you do not find it and it does not appear at all to the senses: then perform phlebotomy on one of its branches, and there is one that appears on the back of the foot, turned towards the auricle: and beware of the nerves, and let the amount of blood run according to your wish.
Deinde solue stricturam, et pone super locum phlebotomiae corium, et stringe locum.	 Then unravel the stricture, and place skin over the site of phlebotomy, and bind the site.
Uelociter enim sanatur.	 It is quickly healed.
¶ De Ventosatione, et qualitate usus eius.	 On ventosation and the quality of its use.
Caput XCVIII.	 Chapter XCVIII.
Uentosae fiunt ex cornibus, et ex aere, et ex uitro.	 They are made from horns, and from brass, and from glass.
Et Ventosatio quidem fit secundum duos modos.	 And ventosation is done according to two modes.
Cum scarificatione, et extractione sanguinis: et alter est uentosatio sine scarificatione.	 With incision and bloodletting: and there is another ventosation without incision.
Et haec Ventosatio quae est sine scarificatione, est secundum duos modos.	 And this ventosation which is without incision, is according to two modes.
Aut enim est cum igne.	 Or it is with fire.
Aut est absque igne.	 Or it is without fire.
Et uentosis quae administrantur cum scarificatione et extractione sanguinis sunt quatuordecim loca corporis.	 And the places of the body where ventosation with incision and bloodletting are administered are fourteen.
Quorum unus est, Ventosatio Alnocrati, et est postremum capitis: et Alkehel, et est medium colli: et uentosae Alhagdahim, et sunt duae laminae colli a duabus partibus simul: et uentosae menti, et est sub mandibula in inferiori oris: et uentosae duarum spatularum: et uentosae Alachosos super finem caudae: et uentosae duorum focilium, et sunt medium duorum brachiorum: et uentosae duorum crurium: et uentosae duarum cauillarum.	 One of them is Ventosation Alnocrati, and it is the last part of the head: and Alkehel, and it is in the middle of the neck: and ventosations Alhagdahim, and they are two plates of the neck from both sides at once: and ventosations of the brain, and it is under the jaw on the lower part of the mouth: and ventosations of the two spatulas: and ventosation Alachosos above the end of the tail: and ventosations of the two fists, and they are in the middle of two arms: and ventosations of the two legs: and ventosations of the two calves.
Et Ventosatio quidem non extrahit sanguinem tibi ex uenis minutis sparsis in carne, et propter illud non cadit uirtus ex eis, sicut est casus eius ex phlebotomia.	 And Ventosation does not draw blood from you from the small veins scattered in the flesh, and therefore its power does not fall out of them, as is the case with its failure due to venesection.
Neque oportet, ut administretur uentosatio siue cum igne, aut absque igne in aliqua aegritudinum quae fiunt ex repletione, donec euacuetur totum corpus.	 It is not necessary that Ventosation be administered with fire or without it for any of the illnesses caused by congestion, until the entire body has been evacuated.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad Ventosationem ex aegritudine, aut propter consuetudinem, administramus eam in omni hora in principio mensis, in fine eius, et in medio ipsius, et in quocumque tempore fuerit.	 If necessity requires Ventosation due to illness or custom, administer it at the beginning of the month, at its end, and in the middle, and at any time whatsoever.
Quod est, quia ex hominibus est qui quando multiplicatur in eo sanguis, donec indiget extractione eius per uentosationem, inuenit in capite suo grauedinem, et sodahan.	 It is because there are men whose blood multiplies in them until it requires the extraction of it through Ventosation, who find a headache and swelling in their heads.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit repletionem et rubedinem in facie sua, capite suo, et collo suo.	 And there are those who find congestion and redness in their faces, in their heads, and in their necks.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit pruritum in facie sua, et fronte sua, et tenebrositatem, et hebetudinem in oculis suis.	 And there are those who find itching in their faces and foreheads, and darkness, and dullness in their eyes.
Et ex eis est qui scalpit locum uentosationis suae.	 And there are those who have a pain at the place of their Ventosation.
Et ex eis est cuius risus multiplicatur.	 And there is one whose laughter is increased.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit gustum sanguinis in ore suo: aut apostematur lingua, et expuit sanguinem.	 And there are those who find the taste of blood in their mouths: or their tongue is scraped and the blood is sponged off.
Et ex eis est cuius somnus multiplicatur.	 And there is one whose sleep is increased.
Et ex eis est qui uidet in somno suo sanguinem et rubedinem, et interfectos, et plagas, et quae sunt similia illis.	 And there are those who see blood and redness in their dreams, and the dead, and wounds, and things similar to them.
Quando ergo uidemus aliquid ex illis, et proprie si est in tertia media mensis: praecipimus tunc uentosationem fieri, postquam praeterierunt de die duae horae, aut tres.	 When we see something from these [symptoms], and especially if it is during the third week of the month: we order Ventosation to be performed, after two or three hours have passed since that day.
Iuuamentum autem Ventosationis nuchae, est: quoniam ipsa confert ad grauitatem in capite, et quod effunditur ad oculos.	 The benefit of Ventosation for the neck is that it alleviates headache and that what is released goes to the eyes.
At uero oportet, ut sit illud post euacuationem totius corporis.	 It is necessary that it [the lesion] should be after evacuation of the entire body.
Et haec quidem Ventosa est loco phlebotomiae Cephalicae.	 This [method] is called ventosa in the place of cephalic phlebotomy.
Et non licet, ut utatur ea qui est frigidae complexionis, aut in quo est catarrus.	 And it must not be used by one who has a cold temperament or where there is a catarrh.
Nam infert ei nocumentum magnum.	 For it brings great harm to him.
Et propter illud non oportet, ut utantur ea senes, et in cuius capite sunt aegritudines frigidae.	 And for that reason, it should not be used by the elderly, and in one whose head is afflicted with cold diseases.
Qui autem super eam fit assiduus, generatur super eum obliuio.	 He who becomes persistent over it generates oblivion upon himself.
Et propter illud oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut deponat manum suam cum uentosa parumper ad inferiora, timendo ex generatione obliuionis.	 And for that reason, you should instruct the ventosa operator to place his hand with the cupping glass slightly lower, fearing the generation of oblivion.
Ventosatio aut Alkehel, est loco phlebotomiae Fuscae, et phlebotomiae Basilicae, et propter illud confert asmati, et constrictioni anhelitus, et fissurae instrumenti anhelitus, et tussi, et repletioni.	 Cupping (ventosatio or alkehel) is in the place of phlebotomy Fusca, and Basilica phlebotomy, and for that reason it brings shortness of breath, constriction of the windpipe, shortness of breath due to instrument fracture, coughing, and repletion.
Et oportet, ut impellatur Ventosa Alkehel parumper, quoniam si ponitur inferius, generat debilitatem in corde, et stomacho.	 And it must be pushed slightly the cupping glass (alkehel), because if placed lower, it generates weakness in the heart and the stomach.
Ventosatio uero alhagdahim, confert doloribus accidentibus in capite, et obtalmiae, et hemigraneae, et perforationi, et dolori in radicibus dentium: et est loco phlebotomiae Basilicae.	 Cupping (alhagdahim) brings pain to accidents of the head, migraine, and optic neuritis, perforation, and pain in the roots of teeth; it is in the place of basilica phlebotomy.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne premat manum suam cum scarificatione: ut non incidat arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 And you should instruct the ventosa operator not to press his hand with scarification, lest he cut an artery and cause bleeding.
Ventosatio autem sub mento, confert alcolae in ore, et corruptioni gingiuae, et similibus eis ex aegritudinibus quae sunt in ore: et stat loco phlebotomiae alieherich, quae sunt in duobus labiis.	 Cupping under the chin brings drunkenness to the mouth, corruption of gums, and similar problems that are in the mouth; it takes the place of another type of phlebotomy, which is located on the two lips.
Ventosatio autem spatularum, confert ad alchafacham, quae fit ex replexione, et caliditate.	 Cupping with a spatula brings alchafacham, which occurs from repletion and heat.
Ventosatio uero interiorum partium duorum focilium, confert iuuamentum phlebotomiae uenarum trium, Basilicae, et Fuscae, et Cephalicae: quoniam ipsa attrahit sanguinem ex omnibus illis uenis minutis, quae sunt in carne: et attrahunt illae uenae minutae ex uenis aliis grossioribus eis, donec peruenit attractio ad uenas tres.	 Internal cauterization of two fires assists the phlebotomy of three veins, Basilica, Fusca, and Cephalica: since it draws blood from all those fine veins that are in the flesh; and those fine veins draw blood from other larger ones until the attraction reaches the three veins.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne multum procedat in scarificatione: quoniam locus est denudatus carne, et sub eo sunt nerui et arteriae.	 It is necessary that you instruct the cauterizer not to proceed too much in scarification: because there is flesh exposed, and beneath it are veins and nerves.
Ventosa autem quae uentosatur super alchausos, confert hemorroidibus Ani, et ulceribus inferioribus.	 The ventose which is applied to the anus assists hemorrhoids of the anus and lower ulcers.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut sit uentosa magna, et ut sit ex aere: quoniam locus indiget suctione forti, et fortasse franguntur Ventosae subtiles: et scarificetur scarificatione magna.	 It is necessary that you instruct the cauterizer that the ventose should be large and of iron: because the place needs strong suction, and perhaps small ventoses may break; and it should be scarified with a deep scarification.
Ventosae autem crurium minuunt diminutione manifesta: quoniam attrahunt sanguinem ex toto corpore, et conferunt doloribus antiquis in renibus, et matricibus, et uesica: prouocant menstrua, et conferunt bothor, et ademenul: et stant loco phlebotomiae duarum saphenarum, et alhorcobeni.	 The ventoses of the legs diminish with an obvious reduction: because they draw blood from the entire body, and provide old pains in the kidneys, womb, and bladder; provoke menstruation, and confer inflammation and coldness; and stand in place of the phlebotomy of two saphenas and alhorcobeni.
Verumtamen debilitant corpus multum, et faciunt accidere syncopim in pluribus hominibus.	 However, they weaken the body greatly, and cause fainting in many men.
Et Ventosarum alhorcobeni iuuamentum est propinquum iuuamento Ventosarum duorum crurium.	 And the ventose of alhorcobeni assists closely the assistance of the ventoses of two legs.
Qualitas positionis Ventosarum est, ut ponas uentosam in primis uacuam, et sugas suctione temperata: et non prolonges positionem uentosarum, sed pone eas uelociter, et remoue eas uelociter, ut ueniant humores ad locum aduentu aequali: et non cesses iterare illud et continuare, donec uideas locum iam rubere et inflari, et appareat rubedo sanguinis: tunc ergo scarifica, et itera suctione paulatim.	 The quality of the position of the ventoses is that you should place the ventose first in an empty place, and suck with moderate suction; and do not prolong the position of the ventoses, but place them quickly, and remove them quickly, so that humors come to the site at equal arrival; and do not cease to repeat this and continue until you see the place already redden and inflame, and the redness appears as blood; then scarify, and gradually repeat suction.
Deinde considera in dispositione corporum.	 Then consider in the arrangement of bodies.
Nam qui ex hominibus est tenerae carnis, rarorum pororum, oportet ut scarifices ipsum semel, non plus: ut non ulceretur locus.	 For whoever is from soft-fleshed people, rare pores, it is necessary to scarify him once, not more: so that the place does not ulcerate.
Et praecipe Ventosatori, ut amplificet scarificationem, et profundet parum: et temperet suctionem in facilitate, et uelocitate, et motu suaui.	 And command to the Wind-healer (anesthetist), that he should enlarge the scarification and not too deeply: and temper the sucking in ease, speed, and gentle motion.
Quod si in sanguine est grossitudo, tunc oportet, ut scarifices ipsum bis.	 If there is swelling in blood, then it is necessary to scarify him twice.
In uice quidem prima aperitur uia subtiliationi sanguinis, et aquositati eius: et in secunda quidem perscrutationi exquisitae extractionis sanguinis grossi.	 In the first instance, a way is opened for subtle blood flow and its liquefaction: and in the second instance, to the thorough examination of the extraction of coagulated blood.
Si uero sanguis est faeculentus ualde, tunc fiat scarificatio uice tertia: ut consequatur ultimum.	 If indeed the blood is extremely foul, then let there be a third scarification: so that it follows the last.
Et ad ultimum, quando uolumus extrahere sanguinem paulatim, uel parumper, sufficit nobis scarificatio una.	 And finally, when we want to draw out blood little by little or less, one scarification is sufficient for us.
Quod si uolumus extractionem sanguinis multi, scarificamus scarificatione plurima.	 If we want the extraction of blood many times, let there be multiple scarifications.
Et si nos mensuramus, quod sanguis est grossus: tunc oportet, ut scarificetur scarificatione profunda: et terminus aequalis in scarificatione, est profunditas cutis.	 And if we measure that the blood is thick: then it is necessary to scarify with deep scarifications: and the end equal in scarifications, is the depth of the skin.
¶ Quid sit illud quod oportet administrari ex oleis apud positionem Ventosarum, et quid caueat uentosandus.	 What is that which should be administered from the oils at the position of the Wind-healers (anesthetists), and what the anesthetist should avoid.
IN illo quidem cuius cutis est grossa, dura, fusca, et pori eius sunt stricti, oportet ut ungantur loca Ventosare cum oleis apertiuis, lenitiuis, resolutiuis: si est in tempore aestatis, sicut est oleum alkeiri, aut oleum uiolatum, aut oleum de amigdalis dulcibus, aut oleum de semine cucurbitae.	 In the thick-skinned person, hard, dark, and whose pores are narrow, it is necessary to anoint with oils of opening (anesthetics), softening, resolving: if it is in the summertime, as aloe oil, or olive oil, or oil from sweet almonds, or oil from pumpkin seeds.
Et si est in tempore hyemis, tunc oleum narcissinum, aut oleum de lilio, aut oleum camomellinum, aut sarbatinum: et eis similia.	 And if it is in the wintertime, then narcissus oil, or lily oil, or chamomile oil, or soap (sabun): and similar to these.
Si uero superfluitas est grossa, frigida: tunc oleum sit amaracinum, aut oleum de balsamita aut oleum alben, aut oleum anetinum: et eis similia.	 If the superfluity is thick and cold, then use bitter almond oil, or oil from balsam or white oil, or oil of anise; and similar ones.
Si uero uentosandus est amplorum pororum, tenerae carnis: tunc oportet, ut prohibeatur ab oleo, et oportet ut isti abluant loca Ventosarum earum post uentosationem cum aqua rosata, aut cum aqua frigida, aut cum aqua solatri, aut cum aqua cucurbitae, aut cum aqua portulacae: et similibus eis.	 If the wound is large and filled with putrid flesh, then it is necessary to prohibit oil and clean the places of the wounds after lancing them with rose water, or cold water, or salt water, or cucumber water, or portulaca water; and similar ones.
Ille autem cuius sanguis est multae humiditatis, abluat uentosas cum aceto, aut cum aqua myrti, et sumach: et similibus eis.	 He whose blood is much moisture, clean the wounds with vinegar, or with water of myrtle, and sumac; and similar ones.
Cuius autem superfluitates sunt grossae, abluat uentosas suas cum uino antiquo, aut cum aqua samsuci, aut decoctione aneti, aut camomillae: et eis similibus.	 He whose superfluities are thick, clean the wounds with old wine, or with juniper water, or anise decoction, or chamomile; and similar ones.
Et oportet, ut caueatur uentosatio in balneo, aut in uestigio balnei, imo oportet, ut administretur post exitum ex balneo per horam, aut per horas duas.	 It is necessary to avoid lancing in the bath or near the bath, rather it should be administered after leaving the bath for an hour, or two hours.
Et non oportet, ut dormiat aliquis post uentosationem.	 And it is not advisable that anyone sleeps after lancing.
¶ Quid est quo oportet ut regatur Ventosandus, aut Phlebotomatus ante uentosationem.	 \*What is necessary to regulate the wound or phlebotomy before lancing?\*
ET post eam oportet, ut consideres in primis: tunc si Ventosatus, aut Phlebotomatus sit cholericus, et uincunt super sanguinem eius acuitas et inflammatio: tunc oportet, ut accipiat infrigidantia, sicut granatum muzum: et etiam endiuiam cum aceto et lactuca, et secaniabin, et iuleb: et eis similia.	 \*And after this it is necessary to consider the following: Then if the wound or phlebotomy is choleric and its sharpness and inflammation dominate over blood, then it is necessary for him to receive cooling agents such as grapes, muskmelon; also onion with vinegar and lettuce, and cucumber and garlic; and similar ones.\*
Et pone cibaria eius pullos, et carnes ouium sekebiget, et cibos conditos cum agresta: et eis similia.	 \*And place his food for him, roasted young chickens, lamb meat, and cooked foods with vinegar; and similar ones.\*
Et cuius complexio est frigida, oportet ut sumat in potu syrupum de melle, aut de almiua, aut alsecaniabin de seminibus factum: et sumat uinum odoriferum medium, quod est inter uetus et nouum: et praecipiatur, ut utatur paucitate cibi.	 \*And if his complexion is cold, he should drink honey syrup or almond syrup made from seeds; and sweet smelling wine that is between old and new; and it is recommended that he use sparingly with food.\*
Et pone cibum eius pullos, et canebir: et passeres, id est, paruas aues: et pullos columborum issiadebet.	 Place his food with chickens and let them eat; and sparrows, that is, small birds; and the young pigeons will be swallowed.
Et oportet, ut potus die uentosationis et phlebotomiae plus sit quam cibus: et oportet, ut detur in potu in quibusdam hominibus in horis tyriaca alfaroch, aut medicamen de musco, id est, muscata, aut alesselithe ante uentosationem: et ante phlebotomiam, aut post: ut confortentur membra principalia, et subtilietur sanguis.	 It is necessary that, on the day of ventositation and phlebotomy, there be more drink than food; and it must be given to some people in tyriac alfaroch hours, or medicine from musc, that is, muscatel, or alesselithe before ventositation; and before or after phlebotomy: so that the main limbs may be strengthened, and the blood may be made more subtle.
Et non oportet, ut sumant eam in potu calefacto.	 It is not necessary to drink it in a heated drink.
¶ De Ventosis sine scarificatione.	 Chapter on ventositation without scarification.
Uentosae autem quae sunt sine scarificatione, sunt Ventosae quae ponuntur super epar, et splenem, et podagram, et super uentrem, umbilicum, et loca renum, et pixidem anchae: quoniam ista membra non sufferunt scarificationem super se.	 Ventosations which are without scarification are those that are placed on the liver, spleen, foot-affliction, and on the abdomen, navel, places of the kidneys, and the ankle-blister: because these members cannot bear scarification upon them.
Et non quaeritur per eas, nisi aut attactio ex membro sanguinis ad membrum: sicut ponimus Ventosam super mammillas in aegritudine fluxus sanguinis narium.	 Nor is anything sought by these, except attraction of blood from one member to another; such as placing a ventosation on the breasts in the illness of nosebleed.
Et utimur eis, ut soluamus a membro uentositatem frigidam inuiscatam in membro: sicut ponimus uentosam super uentrem, et umbilicum.	 And we use them to dissolve the cold and unwelcome ventosity in one member by another; such as placing a ventosation on the abdomen and navel.
Ipsa enim rarificat membrum, et calefacit ipsum, et remouet dolorem propterea, quia resoluit illam uentositatem.	 For it makes the member rarefied, and warms it, and removes pain therefore, because it dissolves that ventosity.
Etiam ponitur super renes, quando accidit in eis opilatio, aut lapis.	 Also it is placed on the kidneys, when there occurs abscess or stone.
Uirtute enim attractionis suae fortasse aperit opilationem, aut eradicat lapidem ex loco suo.	 By its virtue perhaps it opens an abscess, or expels a stone from its place.
Et similiter facit quando ponitur super epar, et splenem apud uentositatem terendam in eis utrisque.	 And similarly it does when placed on the liver and spleen for the ventosity to be drained from either of them.
Et istae Ventosae administrantur uacuae cum sectione tantum.	 These are administered empty with incision only.
Et quandoque administrantur cum igne.	 And at times they are administered with fire.
Et quandoque administrantur plenae aqua tepida in aegritudinibus pleuresis: et illud est, ut impleatur Ventosa, et sit magna, aqua calida sola, aut aqua in qua decoctae sint herbae quae conueniunt.	 And at times they are filled with warm water for diseases of pleurisy: and that is to fill the ventose bag and it should be large, hot water alone, or water in which boiled herbs suitable have been put.
¶ Forma Ventosae administratae cum igne.	 § Shape of a ventose administered with fire.
Sit amplitudo orificii eius duorum digitorum apertorum, secundum quod formauimus: et quantitas eius in profundo sit medietas palmi: et sit in latere eius in loco qui est circiter medium eius, foramen paruum, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum acus: fiat ex aere simul, aut citrino, grossorum marginum, lenium, aequalium, tersorum: ut non laedat membrum apud positionem suam super ipsum: et sit in medio eius uirga transuersa ex aere, aut ferro, ubi ponitur candela cum igne.	 The width of its opening should be two fingers apart, as we have made it; and the depth should be half a palm; and on the side of it, in a place approximately halfway along its length, there should be a small hole, according to the size that can enter it with an awl; it should be made of brass or citronwood, smooth, equal-edged blades, cleansed; so as not to harm the member at its position above it; and in its middle, a transverse rod of brass or iron, where the candle is placed with fire.
Et iam fit haec uentosa magna, maior ea quam narrauimus, et parum minor illa, secundum aegritudines et aetatem eius qui utitur.	 And now this ventose is made large, larger than we have described, but slightly smaller than the one mentioned earlier, according to the diseases and age of the person who uses it.
Ventosae enim puerorum, et extenuatorum sunt aliae, quam uentosae uirorum, et grossorum corporum.	 For ventoses of children, and of those weakened, are different from the ventoses of men, and of fat bodies.
Qualitas autem ponendi hanc uentosam cum igne super membrum, est, ut accendas licinium cum igne ex lino decenter, aut candelam paruam ex caera: et pone eam super medium uirgae transuersae quae est in medio uentosae: ut sit accensus ignis circiter inferiorem partem uentosae, ut non comburatur corpus infirmi.	 The quality of placing this ventose with fire on a member is that you should light a linen cloth or a small candle from wax; and place it on the middle transverse rod that is in the middle of the ventose; so that the fire is burned approximately below the lower part of the ventose, to prevent burning of the weak body.
Deinde ponatur super membrum: et digitus sit super foramen quod dixi, donec quando tenemus uentosam: dum indigemus, auferamus digitum, et egredietur uapor super illud foramen, et soluetur uentosa statim.	 Then it should be placed on the member; and a finger should be over the hole that I have said, until we hold the ventose; while we need it, we remove the finger, and steam will come out through the hole, and the ventose is immediately released.
Deinde igni licinium secundum modum suum, et itera eam, si indiges illa.	 Then, linen (you) heat according to its manner, and if necessary, repeat it.
In Ventosa autem quae administratur in aegritudine pleuresis cum aqua, non est uirga transuersa, neque foramen: et non administratur, nisi quia impletur aqua, et ponitur super membrum tantum.	 In pneumothorax, which is administered in the sickness of pleurisy, there is no bladder with a cross or hole: and it is not administered unless because it is filled with water, and is placed only on the body part.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its form.
Et haec Ventosa quanto plus est magna, ut capiat aquam multam, est melior.	 And this pneumothorax, the larger it is, in order to hold much water, is better.
¶ De suspensione Sanguisugarum.	 § On Suspension of Sugar-water.
Caput XCIX.	 Chapter XCIX.
Sanguisugae non administrantur in pluribus, nisi in quibus membris non est possibilis positio uentosarum, propter paruitatem eorum, sicut labium, et gingiua, et eis similia.	 Sangue-sugars are not administered in many cases, unless in those members where the position of ventoses is not possible due to their smallness, such as lips, gums, and similar parts.
Aut in membro denudato a carne, sicut digitus, et nasus, et eis similia.	 Or in a member denuded of flesh, such as fingers, nose, and similar parts.
Et qualitas utendi eis est: ut ueneris ex Sanguisugis quae sunt in aquis dulcibus, mundis a putredinibus.	 And the quality of use is that you come from Sangue-sugars which are in sweet waters, free from decay.
Deinde dimittantur die et nocte in aqua dulci, donec famelicae sint, et non remaneat in uentre earum aliquid.	 Then, they should be let go every day and night into sweet water until they are hungry, and there remains nothing left in their stomachs.
Deinde euacuetur corpus in primis cum phlebotomia, et cum uentosis.	 Then the body is bled first with phlebotomy, and with ventoses.
Deinde absterge membrum infirmi, donec rubeat.	 Then cleanse the ill member until it turns red.
Postea ponantur super ipsum.	 Afterwards, they are placed on top of it.
Cum ergo implentur, et cadunt, et est possibilis suctio loci cum uentosa, tunc est magis ultimum in iuuamento: et si non, tunc ablue locum cum aceto.	 When they are filled and fall, and it is possible to suck at the place with a ventose, then it is more beneficial for healing; and if not, then cleanse the place with vinegar.
Deinde cum aqua multa, et fricetur, et exprimatur.	 Then, with much water, rub and squeeze.
Quod si prolongatur cursus sanguinis post casum Sanguisugarum, et est illud resudando: tunc infunde pannum lini in aqua frigida, et pone ipsum desuper, donec abscindatur resudatio.	 If the flow of blood is prolonged after the loss of Sangue-sugars, and it is exuding; then immerse a linen cloth in cold water, and place it on top until the exuding ceases.
Quod si multiplicatur sanguis, tunc pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, aut gallas, et similia eis ex stipticis: donec abscindatur sanguis.	 If blood is multiplied, then pulverize over it zeji ground or gall-stones, and similar ones from poppy seeds: until the blood is cut off.
Aut ponantur super locum medietates fabarum excorticatarum: et dimittantur, donec adhaereant fabae in loco, nam sanguis abscinditur.	 Or pulverized almonds (fabarum) without their shells are placed on the site and left until the beans stick to the place, for blood is cut off.
Et oportet si necessaria est iteratio Sanguisugarum, quando est possibile, mutare eas.	 And it is necessary that if a repetition of Sanguisugarum (a sugar extract from the sap of the blood-leaf plant) is needed, it should be changed when possible.
Si autem prohibentur Sanguisugae a suspensione, tunc abstergatur locus cum sanguine recenti.	 But if Sanguisuga (leeches) are forbidden from being hung up, then clean the site with fresh blood.
Aut fige acum in locis, donec egrediatur aliquid ex sanguine.	 Or insert an aculeus (a pointed instrument or needle) into the sites until something comes out of the blood.
Deinde ponantur, nam ipsae quando sentiunt aliquid ex sanguine, adhaerent statim.	 Then place them, for they themselves will stick immediately when they sense something from the blood.
Quando ergo uis ut cadant, pulueriza super eas aliquid ex aloe trito, aut salem, aut cinerem: et cadent statim.	 Whenever you want them to fall (off), pulverize something from ground aloes, salt or ashes over them, and they will fall immediately.
¶ Partis Secundae Finis.	 End of the Second Part.
¶ Liber Chirurgici Albucasis Pars III.	 Beginning of the Third Book of Albucasis's Surgery.
¶ Sermo uniuersalis de restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus.	 Universal Discourse on Restoration, Dislocation, and Treatment of Torsions and Similar Conditions.
Caput I.	 Chapter I.
Hoc Capitulum etiam multotiens est necessarium in arte Medicinae, et est restauratio fracturae, et dislocationis accidentium in ossibus.	 This Chapter is also frequently necessary in the art of Medicine and it is restoration for fractures and dislocations occurring in bones.
Scitote o Filii, quia iactant se de hoc Capitulo stolidi medicorum et uulgi, et qui non inspexerunt unquam antiquorum librum, neque legerunt ex eo literam.	 Know ye, O sons, that foolish doctors and the common people boast about this Chapter, and those who have never looked at an ancient book or read a letter from it.
Et propter hanc caussam fit, quod iste modus ex scientiis in terra nostra est priuatus.	 And for this reason, this method has been deprived of learned men in our land.
Et ego non obuiaui in eo unquam bono omnino, et non adeptus sum ex eo illud, quod sum adeptus nisi propter longitudinem lectionis librorum antiquorum, et studium super intellectum eorum, donec extraxi scientiam illius ex eis.	 And I have never used it in a good way, nor have I acquired that from it except for the length of reading ancient books and my diligence in understanding them until I extracted the knowledge of that method from them.
Deinde adhaesi experimento et studio longitudine uitae meae.	 Then I attach myself to experiment and study throughout my life.
Et iam descripsi uobis ex illo in hoc Capitulo totum quod continet scientia mea: et super quod praeteriit experimentum meum, postquam abbreuiaui illud uobis, et liberaui illud ex occupatione elongationis, et abbreuiaui illud fine abbreuiationis, et ostendi illud fine declinationis: et formaui in eo formas multas ex formis instrumentorum quae administrantur in eo, cum sit ex additione declinationis, sicut feci in duobus Capitulis praecedentibus.	 And now I have described for you the entire content of that chapter containing my knowledge; and above what my experiment exceeded, after abbreviating it for you, and freeing it from occupation with elongation, and abbreviating it to its end of abbreviation, and showing it at its end of declination: and I have formed in it many forms of instruments that are administered within it, since it is due to the addition of declination, as I did in the two preceding chapters.
¶ Summae, et collectiones ex esse fracturae ossium, ex eis quarum praemissio necessaria est, antequam incipiamus rememorationem membrorum fractorum, et diuersorum, si uniuscuiusque.	 Summary and collections of fractures of bones from those whose separation is necessary before we begin the reminder of broken members, and of various kinds, if of each one separately.
Caput II.	 Chapter II.
Oportet, ut dicamus in prologo huius Capituli, summas sermonis, et capitula, ad quarum intellectum cogitur in primis artifex ad stationem super earum ueritatem: scilicet ut uos, et qui sunt prompti, sciant, uel addiscant hanc artem nobilem, et alii a uobis.	 It is necessary that we say in the prologue of this chapter the main points and headings, to which the craftsman must be directed first regarding their truth: namely, that you and those who are ready should know or learn this noble art from each other.
Dico, ergo, quod quando accidit alicui fractura, aut dislocatio, aut torsio, aut casus: tunc oportet, ut properes in primis ad phlebotomandum eum, et soluendum ipsum, aut utraque simul: si non prohibeat aliquid, sicut debilitas uirtutis: aut est ille cui accidit aliquid ex illis puer, aut senex decrepitus: aut est tempus uehementis caloris, aut uehementis frigoris ualde.	 Therefore, I say that when a fracture or dislocation or twist or accident happens to someone, then it is necessary to rush at first to bleed him and free him, or both simultaneously: unless something prevents it, such as weakness of strength; or he who it has happened to is a child or an old man decrepitus; or it is a time of intense heat or intense cold.
Deinde sit contentus in cibo suo, oleribus frigidis, et carnibus auium, et haedorum: et prohibe uinum, et carnes grossas, et repleri ex cibis et omni cibo qui replet uenas sanguine.	 Then he should be content with his food, cold vegetables, beans and cabbage: and forbid wine, coarse meats, and to be filled from foods and all food that fills the veins with blood.
Donec quando securus sis ex apostemate calido, et non times effusionem materiei ad membrum: tunc redeat infirmus ad regimen suum primum cum quo cucurrit consuetudo eius.	 Until when you are secure from a hot apoplectic attack, and do not fear the flow of matter to the limb: then let the sick person return to his own regimen first with which his custom has been accustomed.
Cum ergo incipit os fractum restaurari, tunc oportet, ut cibetur infirmus cibis nutrientibus nutrimento multo, grosso, graui, in quibus sit uiscositas: sicut cibaria facta ex tritico cocto cum aqua, et rizum, et capita, et pedes, et uentres uaccarum, et oua, et pisces recentes: et uinum grossum, et similia illis.	 When therefore the broken bone begins to heal, then it is necessary that the sick person be fed with nourishing foods in abundance, thick, heavy, containing viscosity: such as food made from cooked wheat with water, rice, and heads, and feet, and innards of cows, and eggs, and fresh fish; and thick wine, and similar things.
Cum hoc enim regimine fit coagulatio fracturae uelocius, et melius.	 When this regimen is followed, the healing of the fracture happens more quickly and better.
Et scias, quod ossa fracta, quando sunt in uiris qui sunt in prima senectute, et decrepitis, non est possibile, ut continuentur et consolidentur secundum naturam suam semper, propter exiccationem membrorum eorum: et consolidantur et continuantur quae ex eis sunt in fine lenitatis, sicut ossa puerornm paruorum.	 And know that broken bones, when they are in men who are in the first old age and decrepit, it is not possible for them to be joined and consolidated according to their nature always, because of the drying up of their limbs; and they are consolidated and joined only at the end of the softness, such as the bones of small boys.
Verumtamen natura annectit super os fractum ex omni parte aliquid simile glutino, in quo est grossitudo, quo adhaeret et stringit ipsum, donec conglutinantur adinuicem, et ligantur adinuicem, donec uenit in fine fortitudinis et firmitudinis, sicut fuit in primis, donec non prohibet ipsum aliquid ab operationibus suis: et propter hanc caussam est necesse, ut ponas nutrimentum infirmi cibaria, in quibus sunt grauitas, et uiscositas, et grossitudo, sicut diximus.	 However, nature connects something similar to a glue on every part of the broken bone, in which there is thickness, by which it adheres and tightens it until they are consolidated to each other, and bound together until it comes to the end of strength and firmness, as it was at first, until it does not prohibit something from its operations; and for this reason, it is necessary that you give nourishment to the sick with foods that have thickness, viscosity, and heaviness, as we said.
Et scias, quod fracturae species sunt diuersae, secundum diuersitatem membrorum: quoniam fractura cruris, est diuersa a fractura ossis capitis: et fractura ossis pectoris, est diuersa a fractura ossis dorsi: et similiter reliqua membra omnia diuersa existunt adinuicem: et ego ueni cum rememoratione omnis speciei fracturae expositae in Capitulo suo distinctae ab alia.	 And know that the kinds of fractures are various, according to the diversity of the limbs; because the fracture of the leg is different from the fracture of the bone of the head; and the fracture of the bone of the chest is different from the fracture of the bone of the back; and all other limbs are different from each other in this way; and I come with a reminder of every kind of fracture exposed in its own chapter distinguished from others.
Et diuersificantur species fracturae ossis etiam in seipsa.	 The species of bone fracture are also diversified within themselves.
Quoniam fit fractura eius arcuata, praeter quod accidant in ea astellae.	 Because the fracture is arched, stars also happen in it.
Et quandoque fit fractura eius secundum longitudinem ossis: et sunt fracturae eius satagiae, id est, astellae, et additiones procedentes, sicut sunt in calamo, cum aptatur cultello ad scribendum.	 And sometimes the fracture is along the length of the bone; and there are fractures called stars, that is, points, and additions protruding, like in a reed when it is cut with a knife for writing.
Et non procedentes: et est fractura cum uulnere et disruptione in capite: et est fractura fissura parua.	 And not protruding; and there is the fracture with wound and dislocation at the head; and there is the small crack fracture.
Et omni speciei est ingenium, uel instrumentum proprium in restauratione eius, secundum quod ueniet rememoratio eius, distincta in locis suis.	 And every kind has a skill, or its own tool for restoration, according to what its memory comes up, distinguished in its places.
Et ex eo quo cognoscitur fractura ossis, est tortuositas eius, et ipsius eminentia: et apparitio eius sensui, et sonitus eius quando comprimis ipsum manu tua.	 And from that which the bone fracture is known, there is its twist and its protrusion; and its appearance to the sense and its sound when you compress it with your hand.
Quando ergo non est in loco tortuositas apparens, neque sonitus apud tactum tuum cum tangis os cum agitatione, neque inuenit infirmus magnum dolorem: tunc non est illic fractura, imo possibile est, ut sit tortuositas, aut fissura parua: non ergo oportet, ut moueas ipsum cum manu et compressione omnino, imo pone super ipsum ex medicinis, quarum uenit rememoratio, post momentum illud quod conuenit loco: deinde stringatur strictura subtili.	 When therefore there is no twist appearing nor sound under your touch when you touch the bone with movement, nor does a weak great pain appear; then there is no fracture there, indeed it is possible that there is a twist or small crack; therefore do not move it with your hand and compression at all, but put medicines over it whose memory comes up after some time; then tie a string around it with a fine ligation.
Et scias, quod locus quando arcuatur, et scinditur in duo, praeter quod accidant in eo satagiae, uerumtamen remouetur omnis pars a compari sua: tunc oportet tibi, ut incipias ab hora tua ad rectificationem eius, aequando ipsum antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	 And know that the place becomes arched and is split into two, but stars appear in it; however, all parts should be removed from each other; then you must begin to start at your hour for its correction, aligning it before a hot abscess appears on it.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum, tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec quiescat apoestema.	 If however a hot abscess appears on it, then leave it for some days until the abscess subsides.
Deinde aequa ipsum secundum quemcunque modum potest ex lenitate et ingenio.	 Then align it according to whatever method possible with gentleness and skill.
Et scias, quod restauratio eius, et ipsius aequatio, est facilior quam ossis, in quo accidunt satagiae.	 And know that the restoration and its equality is easier than the bone, where complications occur.
Deinde stringe ipsum, secundum quod ueniet tibi rememoratio eius.	 Then tie it up, according to what comes to your recollection of it.
Si uero in osse sunt satagiae, tunc necessaria est extensio huius membri fracti ex duabus partibus, si manus sit, aut pes: aut cum manu tua, si membrum est paruum: aut cum duobus funibus, aut cum fune et manu.	 If there are complications in the bone, then an extension of this broken member is necessary from both sides, whether it be a hand or foot; or with your hand if the member is small; or with two ropes, or with a rope and your hand.
Et sit positio tua qua ponis membrum super locum aequalem, secundum figuram suam naturalem, donec quando extenduntur partes membri fracti: tunc conare, ut redire facias illas additiones omni ingenio, et secundum quemcunque modum potes in locis suis: et caue secundum fortitudinem tuam, ne accidat super infirmum per operationem tuam dolor, neque laesio: et conare secundum fortitudinem tuam, ut applices unum duorum ossium cum socio suo, secundum meliores formas.	 And let your position be such when you place the member on a level surface according to its natural shape, until the parts of the broken member are extended; then try to bring back all additions with every effort and in whatever way possible at their places; and beware lest, by your operation, pain or injury occurs, nor harm; and try with your strength, to apply one of two bones together with its companion, according to better shapes.
Et oportet in illa hora, ut tentes et tangas ipsum manu tua.	 And it is necessary that you probe it at that time with your hand.
Si ergo uides illic aliquid diuersum, rectifica ipsum, et aequa illud per quantitatem tuae uirtutis.	 If therefore you see anything different there, correct it and make it equal by the amount of your strength.
Et caue extensionem uehementem, et compressionem fortem, sicut faciunt multi stolidorum.	 And beware of violent stretching and strong compressions, as many foolish people do.
Multotiens enim faciunt accidere per operationem illam suam apostema calidum, aut contractionem in membro: sicut iam uidimus illud ex operationibus eorum multotiens.	 For they often cause an abscess to occur due to their operation or a contraction in the member; as we have seen this happens many times from their operations.
Deinde annecte post aequationem, et decentem operationem, et stricturam illius membri, et quietem, et tranquillitatem: et mone infirmum super ipsum.	 Then attach after the equality and suitable operation, and compression, relaxation, and peace of that member; and warn the weak person about it.
Et fac ipsum cauere, ne moueat ipsum in hora suarum uigiliarum, et somni sui apud reuolutionem suam, et agitationem suam, et apud egestionem suam, et omnes motus suos ultima uirtute sua.	 And make him take care not to move it during his waking hours and sleep, during its rotation, its stirring, and during its exertions, and all his movements with the last of his strength.
Et ut caueat, ne sit positio membri positio cum qua sequatur dolor.	 And so that it may be avoided, let there not be a position of a limb with which follows pain.
Quod est, quia quando sentit in dispositione positionis membri dolorem, aut laesionem: tunc oportet, ut permutes ipsum ad dispositionem aliam ab illa cum qua non sentiat dolorem.	 Whenever there is pain or injury while in the position of a limb, then it must be moved to another position in which no pain is felt.
Et caue cum illo, ut sit positio eius illa aequalis, recta: ut non accidat in membro tortuositas, quando restauratur.	 And see that its position is equal and straight, so that there will not be a twisting in the limb when it is restored.
Et qualitas stricturae membri fracti est, secundum quod narro.	 The quality of the constriction of the broken member, as I have told.
Scias, quod membra fracta diuersificantur in paruitate sua, et eorum magnitudine, et ipsorum forma.	 Know that fractured members are differentiated according to their size and form.
Quae ergo ex eis sunt parua, sicut brachium, et digitus, et focile, et similia eis, tunc oportet, ut sit inuolutio panni mollis, subtilis.	 Those that are small, such as the arm, finger, fleshy part of the ear, and similar to these, then it is necessary that the bandage be made of soft, fine fabric.
Quae autem ex eis sunt grossa, sicut coxa, et crus, oportet ut sit in eis inuolutio lata, dura.	 Those that are large, such as the hip and leg, it is necessary that there be a wide, firm bandage around them.
Quoniam ligamentum latum, connectit membrum magnum, et stringit ipsum ab omni parte strictura aequali, ita quod non ingreditur ipsum macula.	 Because a broad ligament binds a large member and compresses it from all sides with equal constriction, so that no spot remains inside of it.
Deinde incipe post euacuationem tuam ab aequatione ponere linimentum conueniens ad illud, in stuppa leni super locum fracturae ipsius.	 Then begin after your evacuation to place a suitable poultice on it at the soft spot of the fracture itself.
Deinde incipe inuoluere ligamentum super locum fracturae ipsius tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod meretur membrum: et stringe manum tuam parumper cum ligamento.	 Then begin to wrap the bandage around the location of the fracture itself with three or four wrappings, according to what the member deserves; and bind your hand slightly with the bandage.
Deinde uade cum eo ad partem superiorem a loco fracturae, et stringe minus quam fuit strictura tua, qua strinxisti locum fractum.	 Then go to the upper part from the location of the fracture and bind it less than your previous constriction, with which you bound the fractured place.
Deinde elonga te cum inuolutione a loco fracturae parumper, et mollifica stricturam paulatim, donec capias ex loco sano rem magnam.	 Then extend yourself and the bandage slightly away from the location of the fracture and gradually soften the constriction until you gather much from a healthy place.
Deinde accipe uittam aliam, et inuolue eam iterum super locum fractum inuolutionibus.	 Then take another poultice, and wrap it again over the fracture with bandages.
Postea uade cum inuolutione ad partem inferiorem a fractura.	 Advance with subsidence towards the lower part from the fracture.
Et sit operatio tua in strictura inuolutionis, et mollificatione eius, secundum quod diximus in inuolutione prima superiore.	 And let your operation be in the constriction of subsidence, and softening it, as we said in the first subsidence above.
Deinde pone inter inuolutiones ex stuppa leni, aut panno, cum quo aequetur tortuositas fracturae, si est in ea tortuositas: et si non, non ponas in ea aliquid.	 Then place between the subsidences from soft sponge or cloth, which corresponds to the crookedness of the fracture, if there is crookedness in it; and if not, do not put anything in it.
Deinde inuolue super ipsam uittam aliam.	 Then subside upon another piece of meat above it.
Postea aequa super has inuolutiones astellas decenter factas statim, si non est in loco inflatio, neque apostema calidum.	 Then place equal stars (stitches) well made immediately on top of these subsidences, if there is no swelling or warm abscess in the area.
Si autem in ea est inflatio, aut apostema: tunc pone super eam quod sedet illud apostema, et auferat inflationem: et dimitte eam aliquot diebus.	 If there is swelling or abscess in it; then place upon it what sits on the abscess and remove the swelling; and leave it for some days.
Deinde stringe super ipsam tunc astellas.	 Then bind over these with stitches.
Et sint Astellae ex medietatibus cannae latae, rasae, formatae sapienter: aut sint ex ligno unde fiunt cribra, quae fiunt ex pino, aut geraid, id est, ramis palmae, aut calingi: et sit amplitudo omnis Astellae, secundum hanc formam, et hanc eandem figuram.	 Let the stitches be half of a thick reed, smooth and well formed; or let them be from wood where sieves are made, which are made of pine or oak, or calingi: and let the width of each stitch be according to this shape and this same figure.
Verumtamen oportet, ut Astella quae ponitur super ipsam tracturam, sit grossior et latior parumper, quam reliquae Astellae: et longitudo Astellae sit secundum quod licet membro ex magnitudine et paruitate.	 However, it is necessary that the stitch which is placed upon the swollen part be slightly thicker and wider than the other stitches; and the length of the stitch should be according to what is suitable for the limb in size and smallness.
Deinde stringe super Astellas cum uitta alia, secundum stricturam primam eandem.	 Then bind over the stitches with another piece of linen, following the first constriction.
Deinde liga desuper cum filis decenter, secundum quod diximus de strictura: et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae plus: et quanto plus elongatur a fractura sit, strictura minor.	 Then bind over with threads well, as we said about the constriction; and let your constriction be over the fracture place more; and the farther it extends from the fracture, the less the constriction should be.
Et oportet, ut sint fila media in grossitudine et subtilitate, et sint ex lino molli.	 It is necessary that the threads be of medium thickness and fineness, and they should be from soft linen.
Quoniam si fila sunt grossa, sicut uidi ex operatione stolidorum ponentium fila sua ex chordis lini tortis, est error magnus: quoniam cadit strictura cum eis extra qualitatem.	 If threads are thick, as I have seen in the operation of stupid people putting their threads twisted from the cord of flax, it is a great mistake: because the constriction falls out with them beyond its quality.
Et fila subtilia iterum non conueniunt: quoniam tu non consequeris per stricturam cum eis illud quod uis.	 Fine threads do not agree again: since you will not obtain what you want through the constriction with them.
Et non oportet, ut sit inter astellam et astellam minus quam digitus.	 It is not necessary that there be less than a finger between one star and another.
Quod si laeditur infirmus per extremitates astellarum post stricturam in locis sanis: tunc pone sub eis ex stuppa leni, aut lana carminata, donec nihil laedatur ex illo.	 If the sick person is injured by the points of the stars after the constriction in healthy places: then place beneath them from soft wool or carmine-coated wool, until nothing is injured from that.
Quando autem est fractura cum uulnere, et accidit disruptio in cute, ego ueniam cum rememoratione eius in capitulo secundum singularitatem.	 When there is a break with a wound, and there is a rupture on the skin, I shall come for its reminder in Chapter 2 under special circumstances.
Et scias, quod non omne membrum fractum oportet ut stringatur cum astellis a primo die.	 And know that not every broken limb should be strung with stars from the first day.
Quod est, quia membrum quando est magnum, non oportet ut ponas superipsum astellas, nisi post quinque dies, aut septem, aut plus, secundum securitatem tuam ab euentu apostematis calidi.	 For since a limb is large when it is large, you should not place stars on top of it unless after five days, or seven, or more, according to your safety from the coming of a hot apoplectic fit.
Et iste est modus emplastrorum, quibus restaurabant antiqui, quae ponuntur super fracturam et dislocationem.	 This is the method of ointments, which the ancients used to place on a fracture and dislocation.
¶ Modus Emplastri communis abbreuiati, restaurans fracturam, conueniens pluribus complexionibus, praecipue mulieribus, et pueris: quoniam est ex eo super quod non uincit calor, neque frigus.	 Common Ointment Method, restoring a fracture, suitable for many temperaments, especially women and children, since it is from that which heat does not conquer nor cold.
Et est, ut accipias ex puluere molendini, et est medulla farinae quae pendet in parietibus molendini apud motum molae: et conficias ipsum sicut est, praeter quod cribelles ipsum cum albugine oui: et pone confectionem eius non spissam, neque subtilem.	 And you should receive from the flour mill dust, and it is the marrow of wheat that hangs on the walls of the mill near the movement of the millstone: and make it as such, except that you sieve it with egg white: and place the mixture not thick, nor thin.
Deinde utere eo.	 Then use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, restaurantis fracturam, et dislocationem, et torsionem.	 Another Ointment Method, restoring a fracture, and dislocation, and twisting.
Recipe almess, et laudani, et acaciae, et enulae, et mugath: et suc, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V et alethil ʒ XX terantur omnia, et cribellentur, et misceantur cum aqua alethil: aut cum albugine oui, si complexio infirmi est calefacta.	 Prepare a paste with almess, laudanum, acacia, enula, and mugath. Grind all of them together with ten parts of myrrh, five parts of aloes, and twenty parts of althea. Strain the mixture and sift it. Mix it with water of althea, or with sheep's milk whey if the patient's complexion is heated.
Deinde utere hoc emplastro.	 Use this paste as a plaster.
Nam ipsum est bonae compositionis, restaurat ossa fracta uelociter, et confert pluribus hominibus.	 For it is of good composition, restores broken bones quickly, and is beneficial for many people.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, quod etiam confert fracturae et torsioni.	 Another method of applying a plaster, which also helps with fractures and dislocations.
Recipe mugath, et mess, et alteae albae, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V acaciae ʒ VI boli armeni ʒ XX terantur omnia contritione multa, et cribellentur, et conficiantur cum aqua, aut albugine oui: et administrentur.	 Prepare mugath, mess, white althea, all ground together with ten parts of myrrh, five parts of aloes, six parts of acacia, twenty parts of Armenian clay, and grind them thoroughly, sift them, and make into a paste with water or sheep's milk whey. Administer it.
¶ Modus Emplastri ad iuncturas, et ossa separata ex locis suis: et sedat dolorem accidentem eis, et scissuram ossis, et fracturam.	 Another method of applying a plaster for joints that are dislocated and bones separated from their places: it soothes the pain, heals the broken bone, and stops the cracking.
Sumatur lana succida, et submergatur in aceto, et oleo decocto: et ponatur super locum.	 Take boiled wool, immerse it in vinegar and heated oil, and place it on the affected area.
Et in hoc quidem Emplastro non est uirtus restaurationis, sed est bonum in sedatione apostematis calidi: et expellit dolores proprie.	 In this plaster, there is no power of restoration, but it is good for the soothing of a hot abscess and for expelling specific pains.
¶ Modus Emplastri, quod restaurat os fractum.	 Another method of applying a plaster that restores broken bones.
Sume folia fici surdi, et folia papaueris syluestris: et tere omnia, et fac emplastrum ex utrisque.	 Take the leaves of fig tree and wild papaver, grind them all, and make a plaster from both.
¶ Modus Emplastri abbreuiati, administrati apud restaurationem fracturae ossis: et quando tu uis resolutionem residui apostematis.	 Another method of applying a short-term plaster for the restoration of broken bones and when you want to dissolve the remnants of an abscess.
Recipe radicis alteae, et camomillae, et florum uiolarum, et farinae herbi, omnium ana partem unam: terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum uino, si non est membrum calefactum.	 Prepare the root of althea, chamomile, marsh marigold flowers, and the flour of herbs, all in equal parts. Grind them all and make into a paste with wine if the affected area is not heated.
Si uero est calefactum, tunc confice illud cum aqua coriandri humidi, aut cum aqua, et utere eo.	 If it is heated, then prepare it with water of coriander steeped in water, or use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius fortioris in resolutione, quam istud primum, quando accidit apostema durum apud restaurationem membri.	 Another stronger method for resolving an abscess, which is stronger than the first, when a hard abscess occurs during the healing of a limb.
Recipe radicis alteae, et seminis lini, et balaustiae, et melliloti, et samsuci, et floris uiolarum, et camomillae, omnium ana, partem unam, terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum aqua salicis, aut cum aqua dulci, aut cum uino.	 Take the root of althea, linseed seed, balustia, lentil, samsuc, violets, camomile and mix them all together, grind each part into one, then prepare it with water of willow or sweet water, or wine.
Totum illud secundum caliditatem membri, et quietem caloris eius.	 Apply the whole thing according to the heat of the limb, and the calmness of its warmth.
Hippocrates uero non dixit in libro suo, quod ponatur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius, nisi caerotum factum ex caera, et oleo: non aliud: et narrauit, ut sit medium inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem.	 Hippocrates however did not say in his book that it should be placed on a broken limb during its healing, except for wax made from tallow and oil; not anything else; and he said that it should be of medium thickness between coarseness and fineness.
Galeno autem uisum est, ut ponantur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius res, in quibus est exiccatio caliditatis, sicut myrrha, et aloes et olibanum, et similia eis ex eis quae narrauimus.	 Galen however considered it appropriate to place on a broken limb during its healing substances that have the property of extracting heat, such as myrrh, aloes and frankincense and similar substances from what we have mentioned.
¶ Modus Emplastri quod confert ad laesionem et dolorem.	 Method of plaster that helps with injury and pain.
Recipe mugath, et ciceris, et capillorum hominis incisorum, aut pennae auis, et alteae, et salis partes aequales: terantur, et cribellentur, et conficiantur: et fiat ex eo emplastrum.	 Take mugath, chickpeas, human hair cuttings or bird feathers, althea, and salt in equal parts: grind them, sift them, and prepare plaster from it.
Quantitas autem secundum quam oportet, ut remaneat ligatura, deinde soluatur, est, ut consideres tunc, si non accidit infirmo dolor, neque pruritus, neque mouetur os fractum a loco suo: tunc non resoluas ipsum diebus multis.	 The quantity that should remain as ligature is such that you consider whether pain does not occur, nor itching, nor the bone moves from its place; then do not dissolve it for many days.
Quod si accidat ei in loco pruritus uehemens, aut dolor inquietans, aut inflatio: tunc propera, et solue in hora ipsum, et aufer emplastrum ab eo: et accipe pannum lenem, aut spongiam marinam lenem, humidam: et submerge eam in aqua tepida, et ablue cum ea locum, donec quiescat pruritus, et sedetur dolor.	 If there is intense itching, restless pain, or swelling at the site; then hurry and dissolve it within an hour, remove the plaster from it; and take a soft cloth or sea sponge, moistened with warm water and clean the place with it until the itching subsides and the pain settles.
Deinde dimitte membrum quiescere una hora.	 Then let the member rest for one hour.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam succidam, submersam in aceto et oleo, aut oleo rosato: et liga super ipsum nocte una, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido, et quiescat inflatio membri, et remoueatur dolor eius.	 Then place upon it a woolen cloth soaked in vinegar and oil, or rose oil: and bind over it at night until you are certain of the absence of the hot inflammation, and let the swelling of the member subside, and remove the pain from it.
Deinde itera ipsum ad stricturam subtilem, et emplastrum paruum: et non stringas ipsum constrictione tua prima, et subtilia cum eo, donec sanetur.	 Then repeatedly apply it to a narrow bandage and small plaster: and do not bind it with your first constriction, and with fine ones until it is healed.
Quod si uides, quod apostema, et rubedo, et dolor, et inflatio, et omnia accidentia iam remota sunt penitus, et indiges emplastro et strictura, tunc itera illud sicut fecisti in primis aequaliter.	 If you see that the abscess, redness, pain, swelling, and all other signs have been completely removed: then apply the plaster and bandage equally as you did at first.
Quod si non accidit membro aliquid ex eis quae diximus, tune non soluas ipsum, nisi post tres dies, aut quatuor, aut quinque, aut septem.	 If nothing of the aforementioned occurs in the member: then do not loosen it until three days, or four, or five, or seven.
Et quando que dimittitur uiginti diebus totum illud, secundum quod apparet tibi ex solutione membri, sicut diximus, donec quando adhaeret fractura, et approximat coagulatio carnis super eam: adde etiam tunc in strictura plus quam strictura tua prima tota: et adde etiam in ingrossatione cibi infirmi, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius.	 And when it is released after twenty days, according to what you see in the solution of the member, as we have said: until such time as the fracture adheres and coagulation of flesh over it: add also more to your bandage than your first bandage: and add also more nourishment for the weak, according to the memory of its previous condition.
Si autem uides locum fracturae iam exiccari, et extenuari plus quam oportet: tunc scias, quod nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad ipsum.	 If you see that the location of the fracture is already drying out and becoming too thin: then know that nourishment must not reach it.
Embroca ergo ipsum cum aqua tepida apud omnem uicem qua soluis ipsum, et sit illud in omnibus tribus diebus, et alleuia stricturam parumper.	 Therefore pour warm water on it at every place where you loosen it: and let it be for all three days, and alleviate the bandage slightly.
Per hanc ergo operationem currit ad membrum nutrimentum, et sanatur uelociter.	 Therefore by this operation nourishment flows to the member, and it heals quickly.
Illud autem quod faciunt stolidi restauratores ex fractura membri uice alia, quando non restauratur in primis, secundum quod oportet, et restauratur secundum tortuositatem, est error ex operatione eorum, et timor magnus: et si esset rectum, dixissent illud antiqui in libris suis, et operati fuissent cum eo.	 However what stupid restorers do for a fracture of the member instead of restoration as it should be: when it is not restored first according to necessity, and restored according to twists: it is an error from their operation, and great fear: and if it were correct, the ancients would have said that in their books, and they would have operated with it.
Et ego non uidi alicubi eorum uestigium in illo omnino, et rectius est, ut non fiat illud.	 And I have not seen any trace of theirs there at all, and it is better that it is not done.
¶ De factura accidente in capite.	 On the making of an ulcer in the head.
Caput III.	 Chapter 3.
Species fracturae sunt diuersae, et figurae eius multae: et caussae eius sunt distinctae.	 The types of fractures are various, and their shapes are many; and their causes are separate.
Nam ex fractura est quae fit a percussione cum ense: et percussio aufert os totum usquequo peruenit ad siphac, quod est sub osse, sicut facit axia in ligno: et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Axialis.	 For from a fracture is that which occurs from a blow with a sword; and the blow removes the bone completely as far as it reaches to the pia mater, which is under the bone, just as an axe does in wood; and because of this, this type of fracture is called Axial.
Aut ensis incidit quiddam ossis, et incidit faciem eius, et non penetrat incisio usque ad ultimum eius: et nominatur haec species fracturae Kalaan, id est, Leuatio absolute.	 The knife has cut something of a bone and has cut its face, but it does not pierce through the incision to the end of it; and this type of fracture is called Kalaman, that is, Absolute Lever.
Et est uulnus duarum fracturarum, aut magnum, aut paruum.	 And it is a wound of two types of fractures, either large or small.
Et ex fractura est, quae est contritio, aut attritio: et caussa eius est percussio cum lapide, aut casus super lapidem, aut eis similia.	 And from the fracture is that which is a crush or rubbing; and its cause is striking with a stone, or falling upon a stone, or similar things.
Et haec fractura est etiam aut penetrans, quae iam appropinquat panniculo, quod est sub osse: aut est in facie ossis: et est uulnus harum duarum fracturarum etiam aut paruum, aut magnum.	 And this fracture is also piercing, which approaches the cloth that is under the bone; or it is on the face of the bone; and it is a wound of these two types of fractures, either small or large.
Et ex fractura est, quae est occulta in osse in subtilitate capilli: et est fissura parua, et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Capillaris.	 And from the fracture is that which is hidden within the bone in the subtlety of hair; and it is a small crack, and because of this it is called this type of fracture Capillary.
Et ex eis est fractura, quae fit a casu, aut percussione lapidis, et eis similium, quae faciunt ingredi laminam ossis ad interiora, et fit loco concauitas: sicut accidit caldariis aeris, quando occurrit eis percussio, et ingreditur pars eorum ad interiora.	 And from them is a fracture which occurs from falling or striking with a stone and similar things, which cause the lamina of the bone to enter into the interior; and it forms a hollow: as happens with cauldrons of brass, when they are struck and part of them enters into the interior.
Et plurimum quidem fit illud in capitibus humidorum ossium, sicut sunt capita puerorum.	 And it often occurs in the moist skull bones, such as those of children.
Et fiunt omnibus istis speciebus fracturae satagiae separatae, et ego ueniam cum rememoratione illius totius in loco suo.	 And all these types of fractures are separated by sawing, and I will go with the reminder of the entire thing to its place.
Et cognoscimus omnes has species fracturae per detectionem super eam, et inquisitionem earum cum tentis, et ablationem carnium corruptarum, quae sunt super eas.	 And we recognize all these types of fractures by examination on it and investigation of them with probes, and removal of the rotten flesh that is over them.
Species uero Capillaris cognoscitur per hoc, quod detegitur super os, et abstergitur, et linitur super ipsum cum encaustro: fractura enim apparet nigra.	 But the Capillary type is recognized by this: it is exposed on the bone and scraped off, and rubbed upon it with a hot iron; for the fracture appears black.
In curatione autem fracturae, considera in primis accidentia infirmi: tunc si uides ex accidentibus quod significet significatione manifesta super timorem, sicut uomitus cholerae, et extensio, et amissio intellectus, et abscisio uocis, et syncopis, et febris acuta, et egressus oculorum, et rubedo eorum, et similia eis ex accidentibus in pluribus dispositionibus, proculdubio non sanatur: et si uides accidentia non terrentia te, et speras salutem: tunc incipe curationem eius.	 In treating a fracture, consider first the condition of the sick man; then if you see from his conditions that it indicates fear clearly, as vomiting cholera, extension, loss of intellect, abscission of voice, fainting, acute fever, discharge of eyes, redness of them and similar things in many dispositions, without a doubt he will not be cured; and if you see conditions that do not frighten you and you hope for salvation; then begin the treatment.
Quod est, si uenit ad te uulneratus in primis cum uulneratur: et est illud in diebus hyemis, tunc oportet, ut studeas in ablatione ossis ante diem quartumdecimum secundum omnem dispositionem.	 If a wounded person comes to you first with a wound, and it is during the days of winter, then it is necessary that you should study in the removal of the bone before the fourteenth day according to every arrangement.
Et si est in diebus aestatis, tunc oportet, ut properes remouere os ante diem septimum, antequam corrumpatur quod est sub osse ex panniculo, et accidant illa accidentia quae narrauimus.	 If it is during the days of summer, then you should hasten to remove the bone before the seventh day, before what is beneath the bone decays from fat and such things as we have mentioned happen.
Quod si fractura ossis iam peruenit ad panniculum tangentem cerebrum, et est cum minutiis, et attractione: tunc oportet, ut incidas partem comminutam, et attritam, secundum quod narro tibi.	 If the fracture of the bone has already reached the fat touching the brain and is with fragments and traction, then you should cut the fragmented and smoothed part according to what I have told you.
Et est, ut radas caput uulnerati: et detege super os secundum quemcunque modum possibile est tibi: et secundum figuram uulneris, et quod leue est super infirmum.	 And it is necessary that you shave the head of the wounded and pierce through the bone according to whatever method is possible for you: and according to the shape of the wound and what is light on what is weak.
Quod si accidat tibi apud detectionem ossis fluxus sanguinis, aut apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet.	 If there occurs to you during the piercing of the bone a flow of blood or a hot abscess, then apply what is necessary to it.
Et est, ut impleas locum cum pannis infusis in uino, et oleo rosato: et facias quiescere uulnus, donec sedetur apostema, et sis securus a fluxu sanguinis.	 And it is necessary that you fill the place with soaked cloths in wine and rose oil: and let the wound rest until the abscess settles down and you are secure from the flow of blood.
Deinde incipe in curatione ossis, et ablatione eius.	 Then begin in the healing of the bone, and removal of it.
Et illud fit secundum unum duorum modorum.	 And this is done according to one of two methods.
Modus quidem unus est, ut incidas os cum Incisorio strictae aciei: et haec est forma eius.	 One method is to cut the bone with a knife with a narrow blade: and this is its form.
Dende administra Incisorium aliud post Incisorum latius eo parumper: et haec est forma eius.	 Then administer another knife wider than the first: and this is its form.
Deinde administra etiam Incisorium aliud latius etiam quam secundum.	 Then administer yet another knife wider still.
Et modus secundus est, ut sit apud te numerus Incisoriorum diuersorum: quorum quaedam sint latiora quibusdam, et quaedam eorum breuiora quibusdam: et sint in ultimo acuitatis extremitatum suarum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut fuled: et utere facilitate in percussione super Incisorium, ut non concutiat caput, et laedat ipsum.	 And the second method is that you have a number of knives of various sizes, some of which are wider than others and some of which are shorter than others: and they should be at the end points of their sharpening, and made of iron or hardened: and use them with ease in striking the knife, so as not to shake the head and hurt it.
Si autem os est forte, durum: tunc oportet, ut perfores in circumitu eius, antequam tu administres Incisoria, cum Terebris quae nominantur Terebra non profundantia: et non nominantur ita, nisi quoniam ipsa non pertranseunt terminum ossis carnei ad illud, quod est post ipsum: propterea, quod Terebro est extremitas rotunda super illud, quod est sub capite eius acuto, similis margini, et circulus paruus prohibet submergi, et pertransire spissitudinem ossis.	 If the bone is hard and tough: then it is necessary that you perforate around its circumference before you administer Incisoria, with Terebris which are called Terebra not penetrating deep: and they are not named thus unless because they do not penetrate beyond the bone marrow to what lies after it; therefore, because the tip of the Terebra is rounded above that which is under its head sharp, similar to an edge, and a small circle prevents submerging, and penetrating through the thickness of the bone.
Et conuenit tibi, ut accipias ex istis Terebris numerum multum, quorum unumquodque conueniat quantitati spissitudinis ossis, donec praesens sit tibi omni craneo Terebrum: cuius extremitatis acutae quantitas in longitudine et breuitate sit, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis illius cranei.	 It is necessary that you take a great number of these Terebris, one of which should correspond to the thickness of the bone; until the present has all the Terebrum of the skull: whose sharp tip's quantity in length and breadth should be according to the thickness of that skull.
Et haec est forma trium specierum Terebrorum, uel Trepanorum.	 And this is the form of three types of Terebris or Trepans.
Qualitas autem perforandi in circumitu ossis fracti, est: ut ponas Terebrum super os, et reuoluas ipsum digitis tuis, donec scias, os iam penetratum esse.	 The quality of perforating around the bone that is broken, is: that you place the Terebra on the bone and rotate it with your fingers until you know that the bone has been penetrated.
Deinde permuta Terebrum ad locum alium, et pone quod est inter omne foramen quantitatem grossitudinis radii, aut circiter illud.	 Then exchange the Terebra to another place and place what is between every hole of a size equal to the thickness of a finger or about it.
Deinde incide cum Incisoriis quod est inter omne foramen ex osse: et fac illud subtilius quam potes super illud ex fine leuitatis, sicut diximus, donec eradices os, aut manu tua, aut cum aliquo alio ex quibusdam instrumentis, quae parasti ad illud: sicut tenaliae, et forpices subtiles.	 Then cut with Incisoria what is between every hole from the bone: and do it more subtle than possible over that from the end of delicacy, as we said, until you have removed the bone, either by your hand or with some other tools which you have prepared for this; such as tenalias and delicate forpices.
Et oportet, ut caueas omni cautela, ne tangat Terebrum, aut Incisorium aliquid ex siphac.	 And it is necessary that you be careful with all caution, that the Terebra or Incisoria touches nothing from silk.
Cum ergo circumieris os perforando, et separatum fuerit a siphac, si fuerit continuum cum eo, et extraxeris ipsum, oportet ut radas, et aeques extremitatem eius quod remanet in osse cum instrumento alio simili Incisorio.	 When you perforate the bone by going around and it is separated from silk, if it was continuous with it, and you remove it, it is necessary that you shave, and equalize the remaining part in the bone with another similar Incisoria.
Verumtamen oportet, ut sit tenuis et subtilis magis aliis Incisoriis.	 It is necessary that it should be thin and subtle more than other incisors.
Quod si remanet aliquid ex ossibus paruis, et satagiae: tunc accipe ea cum facilitate, cum eo quod est apud te ex instrumentis.	 If something remains from small bones and cartilage, then take it with ease, with what is near you among your tools.
Deinde cura uulnus post illud cum liciniis, et unguentis quae diximus.	 Then care for the wound after that with linen, and the ointments that I mentioned.
Et modus alius operationis est facilis, prorsus longinquus a timore: quem dixit Galenus, et laudauit ipsum laude magna: et iste est sermo eius.	 Another method of operation is easy, completely distant from fear; which Galen said and praised greatly; and this is his statement.
Necese est tibi in primis, ut incipias detegere partem ossis ex loco, in quo fractura est uehementior, et manifestior: donec quando detexeris illam partem, et posueris sub eo extremitatem huius Incisorii lenticularis, cuius haec est forma.	 You must first begin to expose a piece of bone from the place where the fracture is more violent and clear; until when you have exposed that part and placed under it the tip of this Convex Incisor, which has this form.
Et pars lenticularis, lenis non incidit aliquid: et pars acuta eius in duabus lateribus eius uadens in longitudinem, sicut uides: ut sit pars lenticularis innixa ad siphac, facie eius incidente acuta in osse.	 The convex part does not cut anything; and the sharp part of it extends on both sides in length, as you see; so that the convex part may be attached to the splint, with its face incidentally sharp on the bone.
Deinde percute super Incisorium a parte una cum malleo paruo, donec incidas totum os cum facilitate, sicut reuoluitur: et tu sis securus ex panniculo, quod non accidat in eo accidens, quod timeas prorsus.	 Then strike the Convex Incisor on one side with a small hammer until you cut all the bone with ease, as it is rotated; and you will be safe from the cloth that does not fall into the place you fear completely.
Et si medicans non esset stultior hominum, et magis ignarus eius, nec esset dormiens, tunc si remaneret aliquid annexum ossi ex panniculo in quibusdam locis, incideret ipsum ab eo cum extremitate incisorii lenticularis ipsius, et liberaret ipsum ab eo cum facilitate.	 And if the doctor were not foolish among men, and more ignorant of this, nor asleep, then if something remained attached to the bone from the cloth in some places, he would cut it off with the tip of the Convex Incisor and free it with ease.
Liberatur enim ab eo sine nocumento, et absque timore.	 It is freed from it without harm and without fear.
Et si fractura ossis non penetret usque ad panniculum, et illud quod abscinditur ab osse est facies eius, et remanent in ipso asperitas et satagiae subtiles: tunc oportet, ut radas illam asperitatem, et eradices illas satagias cum rasoriis subtilibus ex quibus praeparasti numerum diuersarum quantitatum, ut sit tibi possibile administrare ex eis in omni loco conuenientiora eorum, et rectiora ipsorum, secundum illud ad quod perducit te operatio, et ipsum os fractum, et figura eius.	 If the bone fracture does not penetrate to the cloth and what is cut away from the bone is its face, and roughness and subtle cartilage remains in it; then it is necessary that you remove the roughness, and dig out the cartilages with finer rasors that you have prepared of various sizes, so that it will be possible for you to administer them in every place more suitable and correct according to where the operation leads you, and the fractured bone, and its figure.
Et oportet, ut administres in rasione tua, qua in primis radis os, latius illorum rasoriorum.	 It is necessary that you administer [the procedure] according to your reasoning, firstly cutting the bone more widely with those broader scalpels.
Deinde utere post ipsum subtiliore eo.	 Then use a finer instrument after that.
Et non cesses facere illud secundum continuitatem, donec peruenias ad administrandum tenuius, et subtilius eorum omnium.	 Keep doing that continuously until you reach administering it more thinly and more finely with them all.
In unaquaque autem fissurarum reliquarum paruarum capillarium, et fractura subtili, oportet ut administres curam, secundum illud quod perducit ad rectificationem eius.	 In each of the remaining small cracks and subtle fractures, it is necessary that you administer care according to what leads to its correction.
Et est res quae non occultatur super omnem, cui in hac arte est quodlibet studium, et stetit super illud quod scripsimus, et ostendimus in fracturis magnis.	 And there is a thing that does not hide upon every one who has any study in this art and it stands upon what we have written and shown in large fractures.
Si autem panniculus detectus retinetur, quando tu eradicas os: tunc oportet, ut accipias pannum lini, secundum quantitatem uulneris, et submerge ipsum in oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super orificium uulneris.	 If however a piece of flesh is detected while you are cutting the bone: then it is necessary that you take linen cloth according to the size of the wound and immerse it in rose oil and place it over the wound opening.
Deinde accipe pannum alium duplicatum, aut triplicatum, et submerge ipsum in uino et oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super pannum primum: et fac illud quam facilius potes super illud, ut non grauetur siphac.	 Then take another cloth doubled or tripled and immerse it in wine and rose oil and place it on top of the first one: and do that as easily as possible over it so that it is not too heavy.
Deinde administra supra ipsum ligamentum latum: et non stringas ipsum, nisi per quantitatem quae teneat uulnus tantum: et dimitte ipsum cum hac cura die uno, aut diebus duobus, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido.	 Then administer a wide bandage over it and do not tie it except according to the amount that holds the wound only: and leave it with this care for one day or two days until you are certain about hot swelling.
Deinde solue ipsum, et administra post illud medicinas cum quibus est superflua siccitas: sicut radices lilii, et farina herbi, et puluis thuris, et aristolochia, et similia eis: et est, ut facias ex istis medicinis puluerem, qui puluerizetur super uulnus sicut sunt siccae.	 Then dissolve it and administer afterwards medications with which excessive dryness is necessary: such as the roots of garlic, flour of herbs, powder of frankincense, Aristolochia, and similar ones: and it is so that you make a powder from these medications and sprinkle it over the wound like dry ones.
Et uniuersaliter administra in illo omnem medicinam de proprietate cuius est ut abstergat, et non mordicet.	 And administer universally in that all medication with a property to cleanse and not bite.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, ut uulnus in curatione tua sit limpidum: neque sit in ea sordes unguenti, neque sordicies.	 Be careful according to your virtue, so that the wound may be clean during your treatment: neither should there be dirt from ointment, nor dirtiness.
Neque dimittas uirus aggregari in eo omnino: quoniam quando uirus aggregatur super panniculum cerebri, corrumpit eum, et putrefacit ipsum, et accidit super infirmum post illud malicia magna: et iam accidit in siphac capitis, cum mundificatur ab eo os, praecipue quando negligitur cura eius, nigredo in superficie eius.	 Do not let pus gather at all on it, because when pus gathers upon the brain tissue, it corrupts it and putrefies it, and a great evil happens after that to the sick person: and already has happened on the skull, when the bone is cleaned by him, especially when the care of it is neglected, blackness appears on its surface.
Considera ergo tunc, si accidunt infirmo accidentia quae diximus, scias, quia est pernitiosum proculdubio.	 Therefore, if the afflictions that have been mentioned occur to the sick person, know that it is certainly dangerous.
Et si nigredo non accidit, nisi a medicina quae ponitur super ipsum, et est in uirtute illius medicinae, ut faciat illam nigredinem: tunc oportet, ut accipias ex melle partem unam, ex oleo rosato partes tres, et linias cum eis pannum.	 And if the blackness does not occur, except from the medicine that is put upon him, and it is in the virtue of that medicine to make the blackness: then you should receive a part from honey, three parts from rose oil, and wash with them cloth.
Deinde pone ipsum super siphac: postea cura ipsum cum speciebus curationis quae conueniunt, donec sanetur.	 Then place it upon the skull: afterwards take care of it with suitable remedies for healing, until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Nasi quando frangitur.	 Chapter on the restoration of a broken nose.
Caput IIII.	 Chapter IV.
Scias, quod non franguntur ex Naso nisi duae partes eius superiores simul, aut una earum: propterea, quod ipse sunt duo ossa: quoniam inferius eius est cartilaginosum, non frangitur, et non accidit ei nisi attritio, et tortuositas, et simitas.	 Know that the nose is not broken except for two of its upper parts at once, or one of them: because it has two bones, since below it is cartilaginous and does not break, nor does it happen to it except by abrasion, curvature, and deviation.
Si frangitur una duarum partium eius, tunc oportet, ut intromittas digitum paruum in foramen Nasi, et aeques illam fracturam digito tuo indice, et pollice deforis, donec redeat Nasus super figuram suam naturalem: et fiat illud arte, cum facilitate.	 If one of its two parts is broken, then you should insert a small finger into the nose's opening and align the fracture with your index finger and thumb on the outside until the nose returns to its natural shape: and do this skillfully with ease.
Et caue, ne accidat per operationem tuam illam super infirmum dolor.	 And be careful that pain does not occur upon the sick person due to your operation.
Quod si fractura est in superiore parte Nasi, et non perueniat ad illam digitus: tunc oportet, ut aequetur extremitate radii, in quo sit grossitudo parua.	 If the fracture is in the upper part of the nose, and it is not reached by the finger: then it is necessary to equalize the end of the radius, where there is a small swelling.
Si uero fractura est in duabus partibus, tunc fac simile illius: et propera cum restauratione eius in die primo fracturae, si est possibile.	 If the fracture occurs in two parts, then do as follows: and approach with its restoration on the first day of the fracture, if it is possible.
Et si non, tunc post diem septimum, aut decimum apud quietem apostematis calidi.	 And if not, then after the seventh or tenth day, at rest, let the aposteme be made with warm poultices.
Deinde intromitte in extremitate Nasi licinium ex panno lini, si fractura est in parte una: aut intromite duo licinia si fractura est in duabus partibus: et sit in licinio grossitudo tantae quantitatis, quae impleat foramen Nasi.	 Then insert a piece of linen cloth into the end of the nose, if the fracture is in one part: or insert two pieces of linen cloth if the fracture is in two parts: and let there be in the cloth a swelling of such size that it fills the nostril.
Et dixerunt quidam antiquorum restauratorum, ut infundantur licinia in butyro, et permutentur omni die.	 And some old restorers said that they should be soaked in butter and changed every day.
Illud uero non uidetur mihi, imo oportet, ut infundatur licinium in albugine oui, confecto cum puluere molendini.	 But this does not seem to me, on the contrary, it is necessary that the linen cloth should be soaked in egg white, made with flour mill.
Deinde dimitte licinium, donec firmetur os, et induretur cartilago.	 Then release the linen cloth until the bone hardens and the cartilage thickens.
Et quandoque intromittitur in Nasum loco licinii penna anseris, postquam inuoluitur super ipsam pannus lenis: et fit, quod ipsa tenet fracturam Nasi uehementius, et ut non prohibeatur infirmus ab inspiratione.	 And sometimes a feather of a goose is inserted into the nose instead of the linen cloth, after it has been covered with soft fabric: and this happens so that the feather tightly holds the fracture of the nose, and prevents the weak from being hindered in breathing.
Et non est haec res necessaria.	 And this is not necessary.
Si uis, fac illud: et si uis, fac licinia.	 If you wish, do it: and if you wish, do with linen cloth.
Quod si accidat Naso iterum dum operaris apostema calidum, emplastra nasum cum caeroto, aut cum coto infuso in oleo rosato, aut modico ex dyaquilon.	 If the nose again becomes infected while performing an aposteme with warm poultices, plaster the nose with pitch or with copper pledget soaked in rose oil or a little with tannin.
Si autem non accidit apostema calidum, tunc oportet, ut emplastres ipsum cum farina sisami, et puluere thuris confecti cum albugine oui.	 But if there is no infection of the warm poultice, then it is necessary to plaster it with wheat flour and frankincense powder mixed with egg white.
Deinde pone super ipsum stuppam lenem, et non liges Nasum cum aliquo omnino.	 Then place a soft cloth upon it (the wound), and do not bind the nose with anything at all.
Si uero franguntur ossa Nasi fractura parua, aut comminuuntur, tunc oportet, ut scindas super ea, et extrahas ipsa cum instrumentis quae conueniunt eis.	 If the nasal bones are broken into pieces, or crushed, then it is necessary that you make an incision over them and extract those pieces using suitable instruments for the purpose.
Deinde sue scissuram, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat, et consolidat ex emplastris conuenientibus ad illud, uel unguentis.	 Then make a suture (stitch), and care for it with what coagulates (the tissue) and consolidates it using suitable ointments or poultices that are suitable for the purpose.
Quod si accidat inter Nasum uulnus, tunc oportet, ut cures ipsum cum liciniis: et administres cannulam de plumbo, donec sanetur.	 If it happens (that) there is a wound between the nose, then it is necessary to care for it with linen and administer a lead cannula until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Mandibulae inferioris, quando disrumpitur.	 Chapter on the restoration of the lower jaw when it breaks.
Caput V.	 Chapter V.
Quando disrumpitur Mandibula inferior, et fractura eius non est cum uulnere: conspice tunc si est fractura eius deforis tantum, et non frangitur in duo, et curuatur ad interiora: tunc cognitio eius est facilis.	 When the lower jaw breaks and there is no wound associated with it: examine whether its break is only external and not broken into two, and if it bends inwardly: then its diagnosis is easy.
Oportet ergo, si est fractura eius in parte dextra, ut intromittas digitum indicem sinistrae in os infirmi: similiter si fractura est in mandibula sinistra, tunc intromitte indicem manus dextrae: et impelle cum eo gibbositatem fracturae deintus cum facilitate ad exteriora cum manu tua altera ab interiori parte ossis decenter, et cum eo aequa ipsam.	 Therefore, if the break is on the right side of the jaw, insert your left index finger into the sick person's mouth: similarly, if the break is on the left jaw, then insert your right index finger: and press with it the bulge of the fracture inwardly towards the outside with your other hand from the inner part of the bone evenly, and with it align it.
Quod si fractura mandibulae iam separata est in duo, tunc oportet, ut administres extersionem a duabus partibus, secundum rectitudinem: donec possibilis sit aequatio eius.	 If the break of the jaw has already separated into two parts, then you must administer an extension from both parts according to their alignment: until it is possible for them to be aligned evenly.
Si autem iam accidit in dentibus commotio, aut disruptio: tunc stringe illos de quibus speras quod remaneant cum filo auri, aut argenti, aut seta.	 If it happens that there is movement or dislocation of the teeth, then bind those that you hope will remain with a wire made of gold, silver, or silk.
Deinde pone super mandibulam fractam caerotum.	 Then place soft wax on the broken jaw.
Deinde pone super ipsum pannum duplicatum, et pone super pannum astellam magnam decenter factam: aut frustum cutis soleae aequale, in longitudinem mandibulae.	 Then place over it a double cloth, and place upon the cloth a large awl well made: or a piece of shoeleather equal in length to the jawbone.
Deinde liga ipsum desuper, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ligatura eius, et conuenit ipsius applicatio, donec non destruitur: et praecipe infirmo, uti tranquillitate et quiete: et pone cibum eius sorbitiones lenes.	 Then bind it above as your preparation of the ligature requires and its application suits until it does not destroy itself: and order the sick one to take it quietly and with calmness: and place for him soft food for eating.
Si autem estimas, quod iam alteratur aliquid figurae aliquo modorum: tunc propera, et solue ipsum in die tertio.	 If you judge that it changes in some way by any means: then hurry and dissolve it on the third day.
Deinde rectifica quod alteratum est ex eo, et emplastra ipsum ex puluere molendini, cum albugine oui, aut cum farina sisami, postquam tu abstuleris caerotum: et pone super emplastrum lanam lenem.	 Then straighten out what is twisted from it, and plaster it with a plaster made of milled flour with egg white or with wheat bran after removing the soot: and place upon the plaster a soft woolen cloth.
Dum ergo permanet annexum illud emplastrum super ipsum, et non alteratur ossis dispositio, dimitte ipsum, ne soluas, donec sanetur: aut stringe fracturam.	 As long as that plaster remains attached to it and the bone's position does not change, leave it undisturbed until it heals: or bind the fracture.
Multotiens enim stringitur haec fractura in tribus septimanis.	 For this fracture is frequently bound in three weeks.
Quod si interim accidat apostema calidum, tunc administra illud quod diximus multotiens in sedatione eius, donec remoueatur illud apostema.	 If a hot abscess occurs meanwhile, then administer what we have said many times for the soothing of it until the abscess is removed.
Et si fractura est cum uulnere, considera.	 And if the fracture is with a wound, be aware.
Namsi iam separatur ex osse frustum, aut a satagie: tunc subtilia te in hoc, ut auferas illa frusta satagiae cum eo quod conuenit tibi in ablatione eorum ex instrumentis.	 If the fragment is separated from the bone or a tooth, be careful. Then use subtlety to remove those fragments of the gum that suit you for their removal using instruments.
Si uero orificium uulneris est strictum, tunc amplifica ipsum cum phlebotomo secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	 If the opening of the wound is narrowed, then enlarge it with a leech according to your need.
Deinde quando abstuleris illa satagie, et non remanserit ex eis aliquid, sue tunc orificium uulneris, si est amplum: et si non, pone super ipsum ex emplastris quae conueniunt ad illud, et incarnant illud, donec sanetur.	 Then when you remove the gum, and nothing remains from it, or if the opening of the wound is large: and if not, place upon it an ointment that suits for that purpose, and let it heal until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Furculae, quando frangitur.	 On the restoration of a broken Fork (Furcula).
Caput VI.	 Head VI.
Plurimum quidem frangitur Furcula ab anteriore parte ex parte humeri, et fractura eius fit secundum unum trium modorum.	 Much indeed breaks the Fork from the anterior part near the shoulder, and its fracture is made according to one of three modes.
Aut enim frangitur et separatur in duo, praeter quod accidant in ea satagiae: et est facilius ad restaurationem eius.	 Either it breaks into two parts, beyond which occur protrusions (satagiae); and it is easier to restore this fracture.
Aut ita, quod accidunt in osse satagiae: et est difficilius ad restaurationem.	 The translation is: "It is thus, what happens in a fractured bone: and it is more difficult for restoration.
Aut ita, quod est fractura cum uulnere.	 The translation is: "It is thus, what is a fracture with a wound.
Et operatio in ea quando fractura est absque uulnere, est, ut facias praesentes esse duos ministros, ut teneat unus eorum adiutorium quod sequitur Furculam fractam, et alter extendat collum uersus partem.	 The translation is: "And the operation in this case when there is no wound, it is to make present two assistants, so that one of them holds the supporting lever (Furcula) which follows the fracture, and the other stretches the neck towards the opposite side.
Deinde aequa fracturam digitis tuis, donec fiat forma eius, secundum quod oportet: et non sit in ea eminentia, neque concauitas.	 The translation is: "Then, make an equal fracture with your fingers until it has the required shape: and there should not be any projection nor depression.
Quod si indiges extensione plus, tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico infirmi spheram ex panno, aut lana: et sit magnitudo eius secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae: et extende, et eleua Furculam, et coarta spheram manu tua, donec aeques fracturam, secundum quod oportet.	 The translation is: "If you need more extension, then it is necessary to place under the weak person's pillow a sphere made of cloth or wool, and let its size be according to your necessity: and extend, lift the lever, and press the sphere with your hand until an equal fracture, as required.
Quod si non potes trahere extremitatem Furculae ad exteriora: propterea, quia peruenit ad profundum: tunc oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et ponas sub humero eius puluinar medium in magnitudine, et premat minister humerum eius ad inferiora, donec eleuetur os Furculae quod est in profundo ad sursum: atque tunc rectifica fracturam, et aequa eam digitis tuis.	 The translation is: "If you cannot pull the end of the lever outwards because it has reached deep inside: then, let the weak person lie on their neck and place a small plank under their shoulder in size, and press the assistant's arm downwards until the bone of the lever that is deep inside is lifted up to the surface: and then correct the fracture and make an equal one with your fingers.
Si autem sentis sathaiatum ex Furcula, et mouetur: tunc oportet, ut findas super illud, et extrahas ipsum alsathaiatum cum facilitate.	 The translation is: "If you feel a spasm from the lever and it moves: then, press on it and extract the spasm with ease.
Si autem est retentum in osse, tunc ingenia in incisione eius cum uno Incisoriorum quae praeparasti ad illud, postquam tu posueris sub Furcula instrumentum quod seruat sifach: et est instrumentum ex ligno, aut ex ferro.	 The translation is: "If it is retained in the bone, then make an incision in that place with a tool prepared for this purpose after you have placed the instrument which holds the sifach under the lever. And the tool is made of wood or iron.
Et haec est forma eius.	 The translation is: "And this is its shape.
Assimilatur cochleari cui non est concauitas.	 The shell that lacks a hollow.
Et sit latitudo eius secundum illud quo indiges eo ex magnitudine ossis, et paruitate eius.	 And let the width of it be according to what you need for it due to the size of the bone, and its smallness.
Longitudo uero eius etiam secundum quod possibile est tibi ad operationem.	 Its length too, if possible for you, according to the operation.
Et habeat duas extremitates, sicut uides: et extremitas una sit ampla, et altera stricta.	 And let it have two ends, as you see: and one end be wide, and the other narrow.
Si autem disruptio uulneris quod scidisti quando extraxisti sathaiatum ossis, est ampla, et securaris ab apostemate calido: tunc aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura.	 If, however, the fracture of the wound which you have cut when you extracted the splinter of bone is wide and you fear from a hot fistula: then bring together two lips of the wound with suture.
Et si disruptio est parua, aut times apostema calidum: tunc imple uulnus cum pannis, et puluillis secundum quantitatem scissurae uulneris.	 And if the fracture is small or you fear a hot fistula: then fill the wound with rags and pulverized charcoal according to the size of the wound incision.
Quod si accidat apostema calidum, tunc infunde pannum in oleo rosato, et aceto, et uino, et pone super ipsum.	 If, however, a hot fistula occurs: then soak the rag in rose oil, vinegar, wine and place it on top of it.
Strictura uero ossis quando est absque uulnere, et absque sectione, est, ut ponas super os emplastrum factum ex farina molendini cum albugine oui.	 But a bone setting without wound and without incision is as follows: place plaster made from flour milled with egg white on the bone.
Et pone stuppam lenem super ipsum.	 And place a soft woolen cloth over it.
Deinde pone spheram sub titillico eius, si indiges illa.	 Then place a sphere under it if you need it.
Deinde accipe himematem, id est, rotam quam tenent Saraceni, quae sit longa ualde: et sit latitudo eius palmi unius, aut circiter illud.	 Then take the hemorrhoid, that is, a wooden roll which Saracens hold, which should be very long: and its width should be the size of one palm, or approximately that.
Deinde pone puluillum duplicatum super stuppam et emplastrum.	 Then place a double layer of charcoal on the woolen cloth and plaster.
Deinde accipe astellam ex tabula subtili, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, et in longitudine similiter.	 Then take a small awl made from fine wood, whose width is three fingers, and similarly long.
Deinde inuolue eam in panno.	 Then thrust it through the cloth.
Deinde inuolue pannum illum cum astella in loco alhimemati qui cadit super fracturam et locum.	 Then thrust the cloth with the awl into the place of the hemorrhoid which falls on the fracture and wound.
Deinde pone alhimemati super fracturam sicut reuoluiur, et inuolue eam super collum eius, et sub titillico eius sano, et sub titillico eius infirmo: et reduc eam super omnem partem, et quomodo uides quod strictura tenet fracturam strictura decenti: et est illud, quod non occultatur super te, et totum, ut non remoueatur astella desuper os fractum.	 Then place the hemorrhoid on the fracture as it is rolled, and thrust it into the neck of the patient, both above the healthy part and below the injured part: and bring it all over so that the setting holds the fracture tightly: and this is what should not be hidden from you, and entirely, so that the awl does not move away from the fractured bone.
Et propter hoc oportet, ut aspicias infirmum in omni die.	 It is necessary to observe the sick person every day.
Quotiens ergo mollificatur ligamentum, et uides astellam iam remoueri: tunc rectifica illud, et stringe ligamentum.	 Whenever the bandage becomes soft and you see the splinter moving: then adjust it and tighten the bandage.
Deinde pone somnum infirmi super dorsum eius, et pone sub titillico eius apud somnum eius puluinar paruum in nocte, ut cum eo eleuetur adiutorium eius a latere ipsius.	 Then place the sick person's sleep on his back and put a small pill under his pillow during sleep, so that when he awakens, help will be summoned from his side.
Eleuatur ergo fractura furculae per eleuationem humeri.	 Therefore, break the collarbone by elevating the shoulder joint.
Aut liga brachium eius ad collum ipsius: et non soluas ligamentum, si non accidat in loco accidens ex pruritu, aut ab apostemate, usque ad duodecim dies.	 Or bind his arm to his neck and do not loosen the bandage unless it happens in the place where it is bound due to itching or abscess, for up to twelve days.
Deinde renoua emplastrum, si uideris faciem eius ad illud.	 Then renew the plaster if you see his face turning towards it.
Et adde in strictura, et dimitte ipsum, donec restauretur et coaguletur.	 And add to the constriction, and release it when it is healed and congealed.
Et fractura quidem furculae stringitur et confortatur secundum plurimum in uigintiocto diebus: et quandoque fit in quibusdam hominibus in minore illo.	 The break in the collarbone is bound and supported as much as possible for 20 days; but sometimes it occurs in a lesser degree in some people.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spatulae.	 Chapter on the repair of the spatula (thoracic plate).
Caput VII.	 Chapter 7.
Raro frangitur Spatula, et in loco lato eius: et non franguntur ex ea nisi margines eius.	 The spatula rarely breaks, and in its wide place: and it is not broken from it except for its edges.
Quando ergo frangitur ex eo locus, et frangitur in medio eius, et non cognoscitur illud nisi per tactum: tunc secundum quod est figura fracturae conare praeparationem eius.	 When the place from which it breaks and breaks in its middle is not known except by touch, then according to its shape prepare its treatment.
Et reduc eam super figuram naturalem omni modo ingenii, quod est tibi possibile.	 And bring it back to its natural form by any means of skill that is possible for you.
Deinde pone super locum puluerem molendini cum albugine oui, et stuppam lenem, et pone desuper puluillum ex panno duplato.	 Then place on it a little dust from the mill with egg white, and soft wool, and put above it a small piece of double-folded cloth.
Deinde pone super ipsum astellam latam ex tabula subtili secundum quantitatem Spatulae totius, aut ampliorem ea parum.	 Then place on it a broad needle from thin wood according to the size of the spatula, or slightly larger but not too much.
Si uero sub astella est concauitas in aliquo locorum Spatulae, tunc aequa illam concauitatem cum stuppa leni, donec descendat astella secundum aequalitatem.	 But if there is a depression under the needle in any part of the spatula, then fill that depression with soft wool until the needle descends to the same level.
Deinde ftringe desuper cum alhimemati longa, constrictione decenti, et firmitudine astellae, donec non remoueatur a loco suo.	 Then sew above it with long alum thread in a proper tension and the firmness of the needle until it is not moved from its place.
Et considera ligamentum in omni die.	 And examine the sutures every day.
Quotienscunque ergo mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum, et aequa astellam si remoueatur a loco suo: et iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	 Whenever the suture becomes soft, sew it, and if the needle is moved from its place, let it lie weak on its healthy side.
Et Spatula quidem restauratur in uiginti diebus, aut in uigintiquinque diebus.	 The spatula is restored within twenty days, or within thirty days.
Quando ergo completur iste numerus, tunc solue ligamentum: et tu sis in securitate.	 When this number is completed, then dissolve the suture: and you will be safe.
Nam ipsa est ex ossibus quorum communitio non timetur, neque eorum solutio.	 For it is made from bones whose fracture is not feared, nor their solution.
Si autem procedat ex osse frustum, et pungit sub cute: tune scinde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum.	 But if a piece of bone protrudes and pierces the skin beneath it, then cut above it, and remove it.
Et fac quod diximus in fractura furculae ex sedatione apostematis calidi, si accidat ex eo aliquid.	 And do as we said in the treatment of the clavicle fracture by applying a hot poultice, if anything happens from it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Pectoris.	 Chapter on the restoration of chest fracture.
Caput VIII.	 Head VIII.
Pectus quandoque frangitur in medio sui, et raro accidit illud.	 Chest sometimes breaks in the middle of itself, and it happens rarely.
Extremitates eius quidem plurimum franguntur, et comminuuntur ex accidentibus eius.	 Its extremities break or are crushed more often due to accidents.
Quando frangitur eius medium, quod declinat ad inferiora, et accidit ei dolor uehemens, et difficultas in anhelitu, et tussis: et fortasse euomit sanguinem, et declaratur concauitas in osse fracto, et non occultatur sensui, Restauratio eius est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et pone inter Spatulas eius puluinar.	 When its middle breaks and it slopes downwards, accompanied by intense pain, difficulty in breathing, coughing, possibly vomiting blood, a hollow appears on the fractured bone that is not hidden to the senses, its restoration involves laying weakened on his back with a splint placed between his ribs.
Deinde preme humeros eius, et aggrega costas a duabus partibus uel lateribus cum manibus: et subtiliare in aequatione eius, secundum omnem modum quo possibile est illud et conuenit, donec redeat figura ossis, secundum quod oportet.	 Then press his shoulders and bring together the ribs on both sides or flanks with hands, and carefully carve it into alignment, as much as possible, until its shape returns to that of a bone, as required.
Deinde pone super ipsum emplastrum et stuppam, et pone desuper astellam ex tabula subtili ex salice, aut chalingi, et ex eis similibus in leuitate, postquam tu inuoluis eam in panno.	 Then place an ointment and woolen cloth on top of it, and place a star-shaped bandage made from thin wood or ivory, or similar materials, wrapped in a fabric when you apply it.
Deinde subtiliare in ligando eam super os fractum, ut non remoueatur: et uade cum ligatura secundum rotunditatem ad dorsum aliquotiens, et stringe ipsum strictura decenti.	 Then carefully bind it over the broken bone so that it does not dislodge; and walk around with the bandage following the roundness to the back several times, tightening it properly.
Deinde considera ligaturam in omni hora, et quotienscumque mollificatur, stringe eam: et si necessitas eius prouocat ad solutionem eius apud pruritum, uel corrosionem quae accidit in loco, aut dolorem, aut apostema: tunc propera, et solue eam, et eradica emplastrum, et rectifica quod accidit cum modo curationis eius.	 Then consider the binding at every hour and whenever it becomes soft, tighten it; and if the need arises for its dissolution due to itching, corrosion that occurs in the area, pain, or abscess, then hurry, unbind it, remove the ointment, and correct whatever has occurred with the treatment method.
Deinde reduc emplastrum, si uides ad illud faciem: et annecte ei stricturam, donec sanetur.	 Then reapply the ointment if you see it facing that way; and apply a tightening bandage until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Costarum, quando franguntur.	 Chapter on the restoration of ribs when they break.
Caput IX.	 Head IX.
Scias, quod Costarum fractura non accidit, nisi in locis grossis quae sequuntur dorsum, et ex extremitatibus earum ab anteriori parte.	 Know that a rib fracture does not occur except in large areas following the back and from the anterior part of its extremities.
Et non accidit eis attritio, nisi propterea, quia sunt cartilaginosae.	 It does not happen to them (the bones) abrasion, unless because they are cartilaginous.
Et cognitio ipsius non occultatur sensui apud inquisitionem cum digitis.	 And the knowledge of it is not hidden from the sense during examination with fingers.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, ut aeques fracturam cum digitis secundum modum possibilem, donec aequetur figura, secundum quod oportet.	 And its restoration is made so that it is set in a fracture with the fingers according to possible manner, until it corresponds to the shape as it should be.
Deinde emplastra, et stringe os fractum cum astella, si indiget illo.	 Then apply ointment, and bind the broken bone with an astragal if necessary.
Et si fractura Costarum est decliuis ad interiora: tunc accidit infirmo dolor uehemens, et punctura, sicut punctura illa quae accidit illi qui habet pleuresim: propterea, quod os pungit uelamen, et etiam ei accidit difficultas anhelitus, et tussis, et uomitus sanguinis multi: et haec est difficilis curationis.	 If the fracture is of the ribs inclined toward the inside: then it happens a strong painful suffering to the weak, and puncture, as the puncture that occurs in him who has pleurisy: because the bone pierces the pleura, and also to him it happens difficulty breathing, and coughing, and vomiting blood many times: and this is difficult cure.
Et iam ingeniati sunt antiqui in ea cum ingeniis multis: et ex eis sunt qui dicunt, ut ponas cibos infirmi qui generent inflammationem et uentositatem, ut inflammetur uenter, et extendatur, et impellatur fractura ad exteriora.	 And the ancients have been skilled in this with many skills: and among them are those who say that you should put foods for the weak which generate inflammation and bloating, so that the stomach is inflamed and extended, and pushed the fracture towards the outside.
Nos uero abhorremus, ut non fiat caussa uelox ad faciendum apostema calidum, si non accidit.	 But we avoid that a cause arises for making a quick pustule, if it does not happen.
Si autem iam accidit, tunc addit in eo.	 If it has already happened, then you add (something) to it.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: ponatur super locum uentosa, deinde sugatur cum fortitudine, et est similius ratiocinationi.	 And some of them say: place a bladder on the location, then squeeze with force, and it is more similar to reasoning.
Verumtamen timetur, quod attrahat uentosa superfluitates ad locum, propter dispositionem debilitatis.	 However, it is feared that it attracts bladder superfluities to the location, due to the dispositions of weakness.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: oportet ut cooperiatur locus cum lana quae iam submersa est in oleo calido: et ponantur puluilli inter Costas, donec impleatur: ut sit ligatura aequalis quando inuoluis eam secundum rotunditatem.	 And some of them say: the location should be covered with wool that is already submerged in hot oil: and fleas are placed between the ribs until it is full: so that the binding is equal when you roll it according to roundness.
Deinde curetur infirmus curatione pleuresis ex cibo et medicina.	 Then the sick person is to be treated for pleurisy with food and medicine.
Quod si coartat infirmum res uehemens, quam non tolerat, et os pungit uelamen punctura laedente, et timemus super infirmum: tunc oportet, ut scindamus super locum, et detegamus a Costa fracta.	 If the disease causes severe constriction and the person cannot bear it, or if we pierce with a lancet and wound the membrane, and we fear for the sick person: then it is necessary that we make an incision over the spot, and expose the broken rib.
Deinde ponamus super ea instrumentum quod conseruat sifac, cuius rememoratio praecessit: et incidamus os cum facilitate, et incidamus ipsum.	 Then we place on it an instrument which seals the sifac (whose description has been given earlier), and cut the bone with ease, then we cut it itself.
Deinde aggregemus duo labia uulneris, si est magnum cum sutura: et curemus ipsum cum emplastris, donec sanetur.	 Then we bring together two edges of the wound if it is large with suture: and treat it with plasters until it heals.
Quod si accidat interim apostema calidum, tunc propera, et infunde puluillos in oleo rosato, et pone super locum: et curetur infirmus cum eo quod conuenit apostemati.	 If by chance an abscess occurs which is hot, then hurry and apply mustard seeds in rose oil on the spot: and treat the sick person with whatever suits the abscess.
Interim etiam resupinetur super latus super quod dormit, donec sanetur.	 Meanwhile, also rest on the side where he sleeps until it heals.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spondilium dorsi et colli.	 Section on the restoration of a fracture of the spine and neck.
Caput X.	 Chapter X.
Ossibus quidem colli quandoque aduenit fractura, et raro accidit eis attritio: et similiter Spondilibus dorsi etiam.	 Fracture sometimes occurs in the bones of the neck, and it rarely happens that they are rubbed [together]; and similarly with the vertebrae of the back as well.
Cum ergo accidit illud alicui, et uis scire, an sanetur, an non sanetur: tunc confidera.	 When it happens to someone that they are fractured and he wishes to know whether he will be healed or not: then consider [the situation].
Nam si uides manus eius iam mollificatas, et stupefactas, et mortuas: et non potest mouere eas, neque extendere eas, neque constringere eas: et quando constringis eas cum digitis tuis, et pungis eas cum acu, non sentit illud, et non sentit in eis dolorem: tunc scias, quia non sanatur, et in pluribus dispositionibus est mortale.	 For if you see that his hands are already softened, stunned and dead; and he cannot move them, extend them or close them; and when you press them with your fingers and pierce them with a needle, he does not feel it nor feels pain in them: then you will know that they will not heal, and in many cases, it is mortal.
Quod si mouet eas, et sentit in eis constrictionem cum digitis et puncturam: tunc scias, quia nucha ossis salua est, et quod infirmus sanabitur cum curatione.	 If he moves them and feels compression with his fingers and the prick [of the needle], then you will know that the hump of the bone is sound, and that the weak one will be healed with treatment.
Quod si eueniat Spondilibus dorsi simile illius, et uis scire, an sanetur etiam, an non: tunc considera ad pedes eius: tunc si uides quod mollificati sunt, et accidit in eis illud quod accidit in manibus: deinde quando iacet super dorsum suum, egreditur uentositas et egestio absque uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super uentrem suum, egreditur egestio sine uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super dorsum suum, et uult mingere, et non potest: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	 If it happens in the vertebrae of the back like the aforementioned [case], and you wish to know whether he will be healed or not: then consider his feet; then if you see that they are softened and the same thing occurs as in the hands; then when he lies on his back, wind comes out without his will; and when he lies on his stomach, wind comes out without his will; and when he tries to relieve himself, he cannot: then you will know that it is mortal.
Non ergo labores in curatione eius.	 Therefore, do not labor in his treatment [of the fracture].
Si uero non accidit ei aliquid ex illo, res est leuior.	 But if nothing of that kind happens to him, it is less severe.
Et curatio eius quod accidit ex illo est, ut coneris sedationem apostematis calidi: ita, ut ponas super Spondilem attritam oleum rosatum solum: aut cum uitellis oui assati.	 And the treatment for his fracture that occurs in this way is to apply a plaster of warm emetics; thus placing oil of rose on the rubbed vertebra, or with pig's bladder soaked in vinegar.
Pone super ipsam illud aliquotiens in die, donec quando sedatur apostema calidum: tum pone super locum unum ex emplastris confortantibus, exiccantibus, et stringe super ipsum cum ligamento: et praecipe infirmo, ut utatur quiete et tranquillitate.	 Place it on that place several times a day until the warm emetic subsides; then place one of the strengthening and drying plasters, and bind it tightly over it with a bandage; and instruct the weak one to rest quietly and peacefully.
Nec dormiat super partem cum qua inuenit dolorem, donec sanetur.	 He shall not sleep on the part where he found pain until it is cured.
Quod si accidit apud attritionem ossis sathaiatum, aut aliquid quod iam separatum fit ex eo: tunc oportet, ut seces super cutem, et auferas illud.	 If it happens during the fracture of a bone called Sathaiatum or something that has already separated from it: then one must remove it by incision on the skin and take it away.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, si est magnum, cum sutura.	 Then gather together two lips of the wound if it is large with suture.
Deinde cura ipsum cum aliquo incarnatiuo, ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it (the wound) with some ointment until it is cured.
Si uero frangitur postremum ossis alhausos, et est finis caudae: tunc oportet, ut intromittas pollicem manus sinistrae in anum, et aeques os fractum manu altera, secundum quod possibile est, et secunda aequatione.	 If the last bone called Alhausos breaks and it is at the end of the tail: then one must insert the thumb of the left hand into the anus, and with the other hand one should adjust the broken bone as much as possible, according to the second alignment.
Deinde pone super ipsum, et aufer ipsum: et cura uulnus cum curatione quae praecessit, donec sanetur.	 Then place it on (the broken bone) and take it away; and care for the wound with the remedy that has been mentioned before until it is cured.
¶ De restauratione Anchae.	 Chapter on the restoration of anus.
Caput XI.	 Chapter XI.
Raro franguntur ossa Ancharum.	 Rarely do bones in the anus break.
Quod si franguntur, tunc fractura eorum non est, nisi comminutio in extremitatibus ipsorum: et scinduntur in longitudine, et declinantur ad interiora: et accidit infirmo dolor in loco, et punctura: et stupescit crus quod frangitur.	 If they do break, the fracture of these bones is not anything but a comminution at their extremities; and they are split lengthwise, and they slope towards the interior; and there occurs pain and weakness in the place, and puncture; and the leg that breaks becomes numb.
Et restauratio quidem eius est, ut extendas manum tuam super ipsum, donec stes super fracturam qualiter est figura eius.	 And the restoration of it (the anus) is to extend your hand over it until you feel its shape at the breakage.
Quod si fractura est in extremitatibus eius tantum, tunc aequa illam fracturam, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ex aequatione, donec assimiletur figurae suae naturali.	 If the breakage is only at its extremities, then adjust that broken part according to the alignment prepared for you until it resembles its natural shape.
Si autem fractura est in longitudine, aut iam declinat ad interiora: tunc fac iacere infirmum super uentrem suum, donec praeparetur tibi restauratio illius fracturae.	 If the breakage is in length and already slopes towards the interior: then make the weak one lie on his stomach until the restoration of that broken part is prepared for you.
Quando ergo aequaueris ipsam, pone super ipsam emplastrum: deinde pone super ipsam astellam ex ligno, aut ex cute: et stringe strictura super quam non timeas permutationem fracturae, neque remotionem astellae.	 When you have adjusted it (the broken bone), place an ointment on it; then place a splint made of wood or hide over it, and tie the bandage around it so that you do not fear the displacement of the fracture or the removal of the splint.
Et aequa concauitatem illorum cum eo quod impleat eam, donec capiat eam strictura secundum aequalitatem: et praecipe infirmo, ut dormiat super dorsum suum, aut super latus suum sanum.	 And equal the hollows of them with that which fills it until it is grasped by the ligature, according to equality; and command the sick one to sleep on his back or on his healthy side.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc cessa ab extensione eius, et ipsius restauratione, donec sedetur apostema calidum: et pone super ipsum quod sedet ipsum, secundum quod praecessit, deinde redi ad restaurationem eius: et stringe ipsum sicut oportet.	 If, however, it happens that an abscess is hot: then cease from extending it and its healing until the hot abscess settles; and place on it what he sits upon, as before, then return to its healing; and tie it as necessary.
Si uero accidit in osse satagie, aut comminuitur, extrahe.	 If, however, it happens that there is a fracture of bone, or it is broken, extract it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Adiutorii.	 [Section on the healing of fractures] Assistant.
Caput XII.	 Chapter XII.
Adiutorium est illud, quod est inter cubitum usque ad caput Spatulae.	 The assistant is that which is between the elbow to the head of a spatula.
Si ergo frangitur, tunc restauratio eius est secundum unum duorum modorum.	 If it is broken, then its healing is according to one of two methods.
Quorum unus est: ut accipias lignum planum mediae grossitudinis, secundum hanc formam, quae sequitur.	 One is: that you take a flat piece of wood of medium thickness, in this shape, which follows.
Et ligentur in duabus extremitatibus duo ligamenta.	 And two ligaments shall be tied at both ends.
Deinde suspendatur ex loco eleuato: et sedeat infirmus super sedem.	 Then it is suspended from a raised place: and the sick person shall sit on the seat.
Deinde proiiciat brachium suum fractum super lignum, donec perueniat ad titillicum eius, in cuius medio sit annexa curuitas ligni.	 Then let his broken arm be thrown upon a log until it reaches the handle of that log, where the wound of the log is attached.
Deinde suspende desuper ipsum aliquid graue, ut extendat ipsum minister ad inferiora.	 Then suspend something heavy above it so that the assistant stretches it towards the lower parts.
Deinde aequet medicus fracturam manibus suis simul, donec redeat fractura, secundum quod oportet.	 The physician then presses the fracture with his hands until it returns, as is required.
Et modus alter est, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et suspende manum eius a collo ipsius cum ligamento.	 There is another way, namely, that the sick person lies on his back and his hand is suspended from his neck with a rope.
Deinde praecipe duobus ministris, ut teneat unus eorum illud quod est supra fracturam cum manibus suis: et ut alter teneat inferius eius, et extendat unusquisque eorum ad partem suam.	 Then order two assistants, one to hold the broken bone with his hands above it; and let the other hold the lower part of it, and each of them should stretch their respective parts.
Et si uis, ut sit extensio fortior, tunc stringe sub fractura cum ligamento, et supra ipsam cum ligamento alio: et extendat ea unusquisque duorum ministrorum ad duas partes suas.	 If you wish for a stronger extension, then tie a rope under the fracture and above it with another; and let each of the two assistants stretch their respective parts to the two sides.
Si ergo fractura est propinqua extremitati humeri, tunc oportet, ut ponatur unum ligamentum sub titillico, et alterum sub fractura uersus cubitum.	 If therefore the fracture is near the end of the humerus, then a rope should be placed under the pulley and another towards the elbow.
Et similiter si fractura est propinqua cubito: tunc oportet, ut ponatur ligamentum super illum locum, et super cubitum ipsum.	 And similarly, if the fracture is near the elbow: then a rope should be placed over that place and on the elbow itself.
Deinde aequa fracturam cum facilitate absque labore, donec quando aequatur fractura secundum quod oportet, et applicatur applicatione bona: tunc stringe eam, si non accidit apostema calidum.	 Then press the fracture easily without effort, until it aligns as required and is applied well; then tie it if no warm abscess occurs.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam usque ad diem septimum.	 If, however, a warm abscess occurs, then release the bandage for seven days.
Et pone super ipsum lanam succidam imbibitam in aceto et oleo rosato, donec quando quiescit apostema: tunc stringe eam: et modus stringendi eam est, ut ponas emplastrum super fracturam.	 Place over it a shred of linen soaked in vinegar and rose oil until the abscess calms down; then tie it; and the method of tying is to apply a plaster over the fracture.
Deinde pone inuolutionem ex panno nouo super emplastrum.	 Then place a new cloth wrap over the plaster.
Deinde aggreget brachium super adiutorium ipsum, et ponat manum suam apertam super humerum suum.	 Then bend the arm over the support and place your open hand on your shoulder.
Et pone pannum, et stringe super adiutorium brachium, ut brachium stet loco astellarum: si non prohibet te ab illo aliquid, neque alteretur super te aliquid ex osse fracto.	 Place a cloth and tie the arm to the support so that the arm remains in position of the stars; if it does not prevent you from anything or anything from the broken bone does not move towards you.
Quod si times, quod alteretur super te ex osse fracto aliquid, tunc utere astellis: et est, ut ponas super fracturam ipsam astellam quae sit latior et fortior reliquis astellis.	 If you fear that something may change on you from a broken bone, then use trephines: and it is, that you place the trephine upon the fracture itself which is broader and stronger than the other trephines.
Et ponas inter omnem astellam latitudinem digiti: et sit longitudo astellarum secundum fracturam cum additione trium digitorum ab omni parte.	 Place a trephine of any width equal to the length of the finger for each trephine: and let the length of the trephines be according to the fracture, with an addition of three fingers from all sides.
Deinde stringe super astellas strictura quam dixi in principio capituli.	 Then tie a ligature over the trephines as I said at the beginning of the chapter.
Et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae strictior.	 And it is, that your ligature over the fracture site should be tight.
Et quanto plus elongatur fractura, sit strictura minor.	 And as the fracture extends more, the ligature should be less tight.
Si ergo uides situm astellarum et stricturam, sicut diximus, in hora qua restauras membrum statim, tunc fac: et si times apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam et astellas usque ad diem septimum, sicut diximus.	 If you see the positions of the trephines and the ligature, as we said, at the hour when you restore the limb, then do so: and if you fear a warm abscess, then release the ligature and the trephines until the seventh day, as we said.
Deinde considera ligamentum in omnibus tribus diebus, ut non accidat in loco pruritus, aut inflatio, aut prohibeatur cibus peruenire ad membrum, propter dispositionem superfluitatis stricturae.	 Then consider the ligature for three days so that itching, swelling, or food may not reach the limb due to the obstruction of the tightening of the ligature.
Rectifica ergo illud totum, secundum quod diximus.	 Correct then everything as we said.
Si uero es super fiduciam, ut non accidat ex illo aliquid: tunc non soluas ligamentum, nisi post tres dies, aut plus.	 If you are confident that nothing will happen from it: then do not loosen the ligature, unless after three days or more.
Et sit dormitio infirmi super dorsum suum, et manus eius super stomachum suum: et pone sub adiutorio culcitram plenam lana aequaliter.	 And let the sick person lie on his back and place his hand on his stomach: and put under him a wool-filled cradle full of wool equally.
Et considera in omni hora noctis, aut diei, ut non soluatur figura membri fracta, aut mollificetur ligamentum.	 And consider at every hour of the night or day, so that the shape of the broken member is not loosened or the ligature softened.
Rectifica ergo illud totum uirtute tua.	 Correct then everything with your power.
Et pone cibum infirmi secundum ordinem quem praemisimus, ita ut sit cibus subtilis in primis, donec incipiat os stringi: tunc oportet, ut ingrosses cibum eius.	 And place the food of the sick person according to the order we gave, so that the food is subtle at first, until the bone begins to harden: then it is necessary that you increase his food.
De consuetudine enim adiutorii et cruris est, ut stringatur in quadraginta diebus: tunc ergo oportet, ut soluatur, et administretur balneum, et medicetur cum unguentis quae rectificant illud.	 In the custom of assistance and the leg, it is to be bound for forty days; then, therefore, it should be loosened, and a bath given, and it should be treated with ointments that correct it.
Quod si fractura fuerit foeda, attrita: tunc non soluas ab ea ligamentum et astellas usque ad quinquaginta dies, et usque ad duos menses.	 If the fracture is foul, to be scraped; then do not loosen the bandage and splints from it for fifty days, and until two months.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Brachii.	 Chapter on the restoration of the arm fracture.
Caput XIII.	 Chapter 13.
Brachium est compositum ex duobus ossibus, quae nominantur duo focilia.	 The arm is made up of two bones, which are called the two humeri.
Quorum unum est paruum: et est illud quod sequitur pollicem.	 One of them is small; and that is the one following the thumb.
Et alterum est magnum, et est illud quod est positum sub paruo ab inferiori parte.	 And the other is large, and that is the one placed below the small one from the lower part.
Fortasse ergo frangitur focile maius solum, aut paruum: et fortasse franguntur simul.	 Therefore, perhaps only the larger humerus is fractured, or perhaps both are fractured.
Quando ergo frangitur focile paruum superius, tunc restauratio eius est facilis, et sanatio eius est facilior.	 When the smaller humerus is fractured above, then the restoration of it is easy, and its healing is easier.
Et quando frangitur focile inferius, est fractura eius mala, et sanatio eius difficilis.	 And when the larger humerus is fractured below, its fracture is bad, and its healing is difficult.
Et deterior ea est, quando franguntur duo ossa simul.	 And it is worse if both bones are fractured at the same time.
Si ergo os quod frangitur est focile parum superius, tunc conuenit medico apud restaurationem eius, ut ponat extensionem paruam cum facilitate, donec aequet ipsum.	 If the bone that is fractured is the smaller humerus above, then it is suitable for the physician at its restoration, that he places an extension smaller with ease, until it equals itself.
Si uero focile magnum est illud quod fractum est: tunc oportet, ut ponat stricturam fortiorem ualde.	 But if the larger humerus is the one that is fractured; then it is necessary that he places a stronger extension very much.
Et oportet, ut ponat figuram manus apud restaurationem eius, et ipsius extensionem extensam super puluinar.	 And it is necessary that he places the hand shape at its restoration, and its extension extended above the pulley.
Et sit pollex manus ad superiora altior omnibus digitis: et sit articularis inferior omnibus digitis, uel reliquis: et infirmus sedens quadratus super seipsum, et sit puluinar coram eo, uel in directo eius, in altitudine, ut non incurrat infirmus laborem.	 And let the thumb of the hand be higher than all the fingers; and let the inferior joint be lower than all the fingers or the others; and let the weak one sitting squarely above itself, and let the pulley be before it, or directly in front of it, in height, so that the weak one does not fall into labor.
Deinde extendat minister Brachium ab inferiori parte, aut manu sua, aut cum ligamento.	 Then, the servant extends the arm from its lower part, either with his hand, or with a rope.
Et minister alius extendat desuper similiter.	 And another servant stretches it likewise above.
Deinde aequet medicus os, donec reducat ipsum secundum meliorem figuram quam potest.	 Then the physician sets the bone, so that he can restore it to its best possible shape.
Quod si in fractura ossis sunt satagiae, tunc conare reducere omne frustum in loco suo uirtute tua.	 If there are fragments in a broken bone, then make an effort to put each fragment back into its place by your own strength.
Si uero apparet in eo sathaiatum separatum, et pungit cutem, et non est tibi spes in restauratione eius: tunc finde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum secundum modum quem diximus in eis quae praemissa sunt.	 If it appears that a fragment is separated and pierces the skin, and there is no hope for restoration: then seal over it, and remove it according to the method we have mentioned earlier.
Si autem fractura est cum uulnere, ego iam feci ad illud capitulum singulare, ergo accipe curationem illius inde.	 If there is a fracture with a wound, I have already written a separate chapter about this, so take care of it from there.
Quod si accidat in principio tuae restaurationis apostema calidum, tunc line pannum cum caeroto facto ex oleo rosato, et caera alba, et sit medium inter spissitudinem et subtilitatem: et stringe pannum super ipsum strictura subtili, donec quando sedatur apostema: tunc remoue caerotum, et pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum albumine oui.	 If a hot abscess occurs at the beginning of your treatment, then prepare a linen cloth with beeswax made from rose oil, and white wax, of a medium thickness between thick and thin: and bind the cloth over it tightly using a fine thread, until the abscess subsides: then remove the beeswax, and apply a prepared plaster made from milled powder with egg white.
Deinde pone astellas, et sit astella quae ponitur super fracturam ipsam latior parumper, et fortior.	 Then place the awls, and let the awl placed over the fracture be slightly wider and stronger.
Et scias, quod numerus astellarum Brachii est sex in pluribus dispositionibus: siue sit fractura in focili uno, aut in duobus focilibus simul.	 And know that the number of awls for an arm is six in various arrangements: whether it be a fracture in one hole, or in two holes at the same time.
Deinde pone stricturam tuam super locum fracturae fortiorem et uehementiorem, et aliquanto plus cum strictura ad superiora fracturae, aut ad inferiora eius: aut pone stricturam molliorem strictura eius parumper, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius in principio capituli.	 Then place your stronger and more powerful splint over the location of the fracture, and place a splint that is slightly longer on the upper part or lower part of the fracture, or place a softer splint for it slightly, according to what was mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.
Et sint panni qui inuoluuntur super fracturam, panni lenes, humidi: et non sint duri, asperi.	 And let the cloths that are wound around the fracture be soft and damp; they should not be hard or rough.
Et sit filum quo stringitur ex lino proprie, medium inter subtile et grossum, sicut narrauimus.	 And let the thread with which it [the wound] is to be tied be made from flax, of a medium thickness between fine and coarse, as we have said.
Et considera membrum et ligamentum post dies.	 Consider the member (limb) and the ligament after days.
Quod si accidat aliquid cuius rectificatio sit necessaria, sicut pruritus qui accidit membro: tunc oportet, ut embroces membrum cum aqua calefacta, donec quiescat ille pruritus, et dimittas membrum non constrictum, donec quiescat, deinde itera stricturam.	 If something occurs that requires correction, such as itching of the member (limb): then it is necessary to anoint the limb with warm embrocation until the itch subsides, and leave the limb unbound until it has subsided, and only then tighten again.
Quod si strictura iam mollificata est, et os iam remotum, et similia illis: tunc rectifica illud totum uirtute tua, et considera iterum.	 If the ligature has already been softened and the bone removed and similar things have happened: then you should correct it with your skill, and consider again.
Nam si nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad membrum, propter superfluitatem stricturae, tunc oportet, ut mollifices ipsum parumper, et dimittas ipsum aliquot diebus, donec currat ad ipsum nutrimentum, deinde stringe ipsum.	 If nutrition is prevented from reaching the member due to an excess of ligature, then it is necessary to soften it a little and leave it for some days until it reaches its nourishment, and then tighten it again.
Si autem non accidit infirmo aliquid eorum quae diximus, tunc non oportet, ut soluatur, nisi post uiginti dies, aut circiter hos.	 But if nothing of the kind happens to the sick man which we have said, then it is not necessary to undo (loosen) it unless after twenty days or about that time.
Deinde suspendatur manus infirmi ad collum eius.	 Then the hand of the sick man is to be suspended to his neck.
Et sit collum eius aequale, et custodiatur uirtute sua a motibus agitatiuis.	 And let his neck be equal (straight), and keep it firmly fixed against violent movements.
Et fac eum dormire super dorsum suum.	 Make him sleep on his back.
Et scias, quod haec fractura in triginta diebus, aut in triginta duobus diebus restauratur: et fortasse restauratur in uigintiocto diebus.	 Know that this fracture will heal in thirty or forty days, and perhaps it may heal within twenty-eight days.
Totum illud est secundum dispositiones complexionum, et dispositiones uirtutis.	 Everything depends on the dispositions of the temperaments (humors) and the dispositions of one's abilities.
¶ De restauratione fracturarum Manus.	 Chapter on the restoration of fractures: Hand.
Caput XIIII.	 Chapter XIII.
Scias, quod pectini Manus, et nodis digitorum raro accidit fractura.	 Know that a scissor's hand and the fingers are seldom fractured.
Et non accidit ei, nisi attritio multotiens.	 It does not happen to him unless he is rubbed frequently.
Quando ergo accidit plantae fractura, aut attritio: tunc oportet, ut sedeat infirmus quadratus: et coram eo sit sedes secundum aequalitatem.	 When the foot is fractured or rubbed, then the sick man should sit on a square seat and a seat be provided for him in accordance with his height.
Deinde pone Manum eius super eam extensam.	 Then place his hand upon it extended.
Deinde extendat minister ossa fracta, et aequet ea medicus, donec quando coniunguntur coniunctione bona.	 The assistant shall then extend the broken bones and the physician shall set them, until they join together with good union.
Tunc oportet, ut ponat emplastrum et stuppam, si non accidat apostema calidum.	 Then it is necessary that he places a plaster and a woolen dressing, if there does not occur a warm abscess.
Deinde pone astellam desuper secundum quantitatem loci: et tu iam inuoluisti eam in panno lini.	 Then place a probe (astella) on top according to the size of the place, and you have already wrapped it in linen cloth.
Si autem fractura est ad inferiora circiter uentrem plantae, tunc fac simile spherae ex panno: et praecipe infirmo, ut coartet super eam cum planta sua fracta: deinde stringatur cum panno longo.	 If the fracture is around the lower part, about the heel of the foot, then make a splint similar to a ball from cloth; and command the patient to bend upon it with his broken foot; then bind it with a long cloth.
Et sit astella ex corio, in quo sit lenitas, ut applicetur corium cum corpore plantae: et stringe eam, secundum quod oportet.	 And let the probe (astella) be made of calfskin, with softness, to apply it to the skin of the sole; and bind it as necessary.
Si autem fractura est ad exteriora, tunc oportet: ut ponas astellam desuper, et astellam aliam ab inferiori in planta: et sit manus aperta recta.	 If the fracture is at the outer side, then it is necessary that you place a probe (astella) on top and another probe from below on the foot; and let the hand be open and straight.
Deinde pone stricturam, sicut reuoluitur manus: et extende inter digitos cum ligamento.	 Then apply the splint as the hand is rolled; extend it between the fingers with a lacing.
Quod si accidat fractura alicui nodorum digitorum, tunc si est pollex, aequetur secundum quod oportet.	 If there occurs a fracture in any knuckle of the finger, if it is the thumb, then set it as necessary.
Deinde stringatur cum planta: et si amas, pone ei astellam rectam, paruam: ut eleuetur fractura, et non moueatur.	 Then bind it with the palm; if there are any, place a straight probe, smaller than the length of the fracture, so that it may be elevated and not moved.
Si autem fractura est reliquis digitis, sicut medio, et indici, aut auriculari, et anulari, tunc aequetur, et ligetur cum digito sano qui sequitur eum: aut ligentur omnes secundum continuationem: et est melius.	 If the fracture is in the remaining fingers, such as the middle one, index finger, ring finger or little finger, then set it and bind it with a healthy finger that follows it; or all of them are bound according to continuity; this is better.
Aut pone super ipsum astellam paruam, sicut diximus in pollice.	 Or place a smaller probe on top as we said in the thumb.
Et considera in restauratione tua, et post ipsam dispositionem apostematis calidi: et oppone cum eo quod oportet, quando accidit aliquid ex illo, secundum quod iteratur eius narratio.	 And consider in your restoration, and after the disposition of warm abscesses; and oppose it with what is necessary, when something occurs from that, according to its narrative.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Coxae.	 On the restoration of a hip fracture.
Caput XV.	 Chapter Fifteen.
OS Coxae multotiens frangitur, et declaratur sensui: quoniam conuertitur ad interiorem et posteriorem partem.	 The thighbone (Femur) is often broken and exposed to the senses because it turns towards the inner and posterior parts.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, quod stringitur ligamentum supra fracturam, et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	 And its restoration is done in such a way that a ligament is tightened above the fracture, and another ligament below the fracture.
Et infirmus prostretur super faciem suam.	 The patient is then laid supine on his face.
Deinde extendat omne ligamentum minister ad partem suam secundum aequalitatem: et hoc, quando est fractura in medio ossis.	 Then, all the limbs are to be extended towards their respective parts according to equality; and this, when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.
Si autem est fractura propinqua radici Coxae, tunc sit ligamentum ad partem pectinis, ut cadat extensio ad sursum: et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	 If, however, the fracture is near the root of the hip, then let there be a ligament towards the neck part so that the extension falls upwards; and another ligament below the fracture.
Et sic similiter si est fractura propinqua genu, tunc sit ligamentum propinquum genu, ut sit extensio ad inferiora.	 And similarly if the fracture is near the knee, then let there be a ligament near the knee so that the extension falls downwards.
Deinde aequet medicus os utriusque manibus suis, donec reducat ipsum secundum similitudinem figurae naturalis: et coniugatur os coniunctione bona.	 Then the physician equalizes the bone with both hands until he reduces it to its original shape; and the bone is joined by a good union.
Tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum et stricturam, si non accidit membro apostema.	 Then it is necessary that you apply a plaster and a bandage if there is no abscess in the limb.
Quod si accidat in eo apostema: tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur apostema calidum, deinde redi ad curationem tuam.	 If an abscess occurs in it: then let it be left for some days until the abscess subsides, and then return to your treatment.
Strictura autem eius ita sit.	 The bandage should be as follows.
Oportet ut inuoluas super fracturam imema duram, id est, bindam: et dupla eam bis, aut ter: et remaneat ex ea superfluitas.	 It is necessary to wind a hard material, that is a bandage, over the fracture; and double it twice or thrice; and there remains an excess of it.
Deinde inuolue crus, donec perueniat calcaneus apud radicem natis.	 Then wind the leg until the heel reaches the root of the foot.
Et intromitte filum longum inter Coxam et crus prope genu ad inferiora, et ueniant extremitates fili a superiori parte duarum partium.	 And insert a long thread between the hip and the leg near the knee towards the lower parts; and the ends of the thread come from the upper parts of the two limbs.\]
Deinde reuolue super Crus et Coxam quod superfluit ex alimema.	 Then wind over the leg and hip the excess from the bandage.
Deinde pone super Coxam in loco fracturae ipsius astellas, et pone ex eis astellam unam super os cruris.	 Then place a star (awl) over the thigh at the site of the fracture and place one star (awl) over the leg's bone.
Deinde imple uacuitates inter crus et coxam cum pannis lenibus, ut aequetur strictura.	 Then fill in the gaps between thigh and shin with soft cloth, so that it fits tightly (to hold the fractured bones together).
Deinde incipe cum strictura forti a medio super locum fracturae tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor.	 Then begin with a firm ligature from the middle over the site of the fracture with three or four wraps.
Et quanto plus elongaris cum ligamento a loco fracturae, sit strictura tua minor et mollior, et lenior.	 And as you extend the ligature away from the site of the fracture, let your ligature be less tight and softer, and looser.
Deinde intende ad duas extremitates fili, quod tu intromisisti inter coxam et crus.	 Then direct the threads at both ends, which you inserted between thigh and shin.
Liga ergo cum utrisque tres astellas quae sunt desuper.	 Tie together with each end three auls (awls) that are above (the area).
Deinde uade cum duabus extremitatibus fili ad inferiora, donec peruenias ad cauillam pedis.	 Then go with both ends of the thread to the lower parts until you reach the ankle of the foot.
Et cum utrisque stringe etiam extremitates astellarum a parte altera: ut non remoueatur ligamentum ex loco suo.	 And tie together also the ends of the awls with each end, so that the ligature is not dislocated from its place.
Deinde dimitte stricturam super illud, dum permanet, ita quod non accidat membro corrosio, neque apostema, neque inflatio, et similia eis.	 Then release the ligature when necessary, so that it does not cause rot (gangrene), boil (abscess), swelling or similar to the member.
Quod si accidat aliquid ex illo.	 If something happens with it.
Propera ergo cum solutione eius, et rectifica illud quod accidit inde totum, secundum quod diximus multotiens.	 Therefore approach with the solution of it (the affected area) and correct whatever has happened there entirely, as we have said many times.
Si uero in osse est frustum ex osse quod pungat: tunc oportet, ut aeques illud, si est tibi possibile.	 If the splinter is in the bone that pierces it (the flesh): then it is necessary to equalize it (remove the splinter), if it is possible for you.
Et si non, finde super illud, et remoue illud: et cura cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio, donec sanetur.	 And if not, plug over it and remove it; take care of the one who preceded it (the surgeon) in memory until it heals.
Et quandoque stringitur haec fractura Coxae, praeter quod addantur ei astellae, sicut diximus in adiutorio et brachio.	 And sometimes this thigh fracture is ligated beyond what the auls (awls) are added, as we said in help for the arm and leg.
Verumtamen in restauratione eius taliter fracta, non accidit infirmo claudicatio.	 However, in repairing this fracture, it does not happen that a lame limp occurs.
Et si restauratur sola, praeter quod applicetur ei crus alterum, tunc necesse est, ut claudicet ille cuius est, semper.	 If it (the limb) is only restored, provided that another leg is not applied to it, then it is necessary that the one to whom it belongs will always limp.
Et scias, quod Coxa stringitur in quinquaginta diebus, uel additur parum, aut minuitur parum: totum illud est secundum diuersitatem complexionum, et reliquarum dispositionum.	 Know that the hip is bound for fifty days, or a little more, or a little less; all this depends on the diversity of temperaments and other conditions.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Rotulae genu.	 Chapter on the restoration of the fracture of the knee joint.
Caput XVI.	 Chapter XVI.
Scias, quod Rotulae genu raro accidit fractura, sed accidit ei attritio multotiens.	 Know that the knee joint rarely suffers a fracture but often suffers wear and tear.
Si uero accidit ei fractura, tunc non nisi aut fissura, aut foramen in partibus suis.	 But if it does suffer a fracture, then it is not other than a split or a hole in one of its parts.
Et est illud cum uulnere, et absque uulnere.	 And it is with an ulcer and without an ulcer.
Et statur super illud totum cum sensu.	 It stands on the whole thing with feeling.
Et restauratio eius est ita, ut aequetur quod disruptum est ex partibus eius cum digitis, donec aggregetur, et coniungatur secundum quod possibile est ex aequatione et facilitate, et fabricatione.	 The restoration of it is thus that the broken parts are brought together with the fingers until they meet and are joined according to what is possible by means of matching and ease, and construction.
Deinde pone emplastrum ex farina sisami, uel molendini, cum albumine oui: et pone super ipsum astellam rotundam, si indiges illa: et stringe desuper strictura conueniente ad illud.	 Then place a plaster made of oatmeal flour or milled grain with egg white on it; and place a round stopper over it if needed; then bind it above with a suitable bandage.
Deinde considera omnes dispositiones quas narrauimus in reliquis fracturis: sicut apostema calidum, et similia illi: ita, ut opponas omni accidenti cum eo quod conuenit ei, donec sanetur.	 Then consider all the conditions that we have mentioned in other fractures; such as a hot abscess and similar things; so that you counter any occurrence with what is appropriate to it until it heals.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Cruris.	 Chapter on the restoration of a leg fracture.
Caput XVII.	 Chapter XVII.
Scias, quod Cruri sunt duo ossa, quorum unum est grossum, et nominatur nomine Cruris: et alterum subtile, et nominatur Focile.	 Know that there are two bones in the leg, one of which is large and called the shinbone (Crus); and the other is slender and called the anklebone (Focile).
Et accidit utrisque ex speciebus fracturae quod accidit duobus ossibus brachii: et propter illud fit restauratio eius, sicut restauratio brachii aequaliter, et operatio est una.	 And it happens that in the case of the leg bones, as with the bones of the arm, fractures occur; and for this reason their restoration is made equally, and the operation is one and the same.
Quod si franguntur duo ossa simul, conuertitur Crus ad omnes partes.	 If two bones are broken together, the leg is turned to all parts.
Et si frangitur os subtilius, conuertitur Crus ad anteriorem partem.	 If a bone is broken more subtly, the leg is turned towards the anterior part.
Et si frangitur os grossius, inuenis illud inferius: et est ex eis quae non occultantur tibi.	 If a bone is broken coarsely, you will find it below; and it is from those that do not deceive you.
Deinde administra extensionem, et aequationem, et ligationem astellarum secundum illud aequaliter.	 Then administer extension, equality, and ligature of the stars according to that equally.
Verumtamen oportet, si fractura Cruris est fractura foeda, habens sethagie multa: ut sit extensio minor, et lenior alleuiatione tua.	 However, if there is a foul fracture of the leg with many seithagi, it should have less extension and be softened more by your application.
Et in Crure quidem est ex operatione quiddam super brachium: et est, ut quando tu aequas astellas, et comples omnem operationem tuam, tunc accipe duas fascias ex ligno pini, quod administratur in fabricatione solariorum quod ponitur sub tabulis: et fiunt ex spatulis palmae: et elige ex eis quibus est grossitudo parua, et neque sint ex minutis: et sit longitudo earum secundum longitudinem Cruris a genu usque inferius.	 And in the leg there is something more than in the arm in operation; and it is that when you tie the stars, and complete your entire work, then take two bands from pine wood, which are used in the making of solariums placed under tables; and they are made from the spatulas of the palm; and choose from them those with small thickness and not too small; and let their length be according to the length of the leg from the knee to below.
Deinde inuolue super unamquamque pannum duabus inuolutionibus secundum longitudinem eius.	 Then fold over each cloth twice, according to its length.
Et pone unam partem Cruris a parte una, et alteram a parte altera: et sint ex genu usque inferius pedis.	 And place one part of the leg on one side and another part on the other; and they should be from the knee to below the foot.
Deinde liga duas fascias in tribus locis ex duabus extremitatibus et medio.	 Then bind two bands in three places, from the two extremities and middle.
Cum enim strictura prohibetur, Crus declinat ad dextram et sinistram, et stat statione bona.	 For when binding is forbidden, the leg inclines to the right and left, and remains in a good stance.
Et iam quidem administretur cunabulum ex ligno secundum longitudinem Cruris, et ponatur in eo Crus, ut conseruet ipsum a motu.	 And indeed a cradle made of wood should be applied according to the length of the leg, and the leg should be placed into it so that it is restrained from movement.
Et plurimum quidem oportet, ut facias illud in fractura quando cum ea est uulnus proprie.	 And certainly it must be done in a fracture when there is an ulcer in it properly.
Deinde considera Crus in omni die, et stude cum eo studio ultimo ab apostemate, aut inflatione, aut reliquis aliis.	 Then consider the leg every day, and strive with it to the utmost from apostemate, or inflation, or any others.
Si ergo accidit aliquid ex illis, tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur, si Deus uoluerit.	 If therefore something happens from those [things], then oppose it with what is necessary, until it heals, if God wills it.
De fractura ossium Pedis, et Digitorum.	 On the Fracture of Bones in the Foot and Fingers.
Caput XVIII.	 Chapter XVIII.
Calcaneo quidem non accidit fractura penitus.	 Indeed, it does not happen that the calcaneum is broken entirely.
Ossibus uero Pedis accidit quandoque fractura, et Digitis parum etiam accidit fractura: et non accidit eis nisi attritio in pluribus dispositionibus.	 The bones of the foot indeed sometimes suffer a break, and it happens less often with the fingers; they do not break except by repeated impact in several positions.
Quod si accidit ossibus Pedis fractura, et uides illa ossa sublimari super se adinuicem, tunc ponat infirmus Pedem suum super terram praeparatam, sicut ambulans.	 If a fracture occurs in the bones of the foot and you see that the bone rises above itself, then lay the injured foot on the ground prepared like one walking.
Deinde sta tu, et pone Pedem tuum super illud quod eleuatur ex illis ossibus: postea preme, uel calca eam: et aequa ipsam, donec redeat in locis suis.	 Then stand you there, and place your foot upon that which is raised by those bones; afterwards press, or trample it; and hold it even, until it returns to its places.
Deinde pone emplastrum, et stuppam desuper: et pone sub uentre Pedis tabulam paruam, cui sint duo capita plana.	 Then place ointment and wax upon it; and place a small table underneath the foot with two flat heads.
Deinde stringe eam cum Pede strictura decenti, postquam tu inuoluis eam cum pannis, et reliquis quibus indiget.	 Then bind it with a bandage suitable for the foot when you have wrapped it with linen and other things needed.
Cum ergo praetereunt ei tres dies, aut quatuor, tunc solue ligamentum.	 When three or four days have passed since then, loosen the bandage.
Nam tu inuenies ossa aequata, siue sint fracta, aut sint dislocata.	 For you will find the bones evened out if they are broken or displaced.
Operatio ergo in eis est, sicut uides.	 Therefore the operation is as you see it.
Si autem franguntur aliqui digiti, tunc restaura eos, et aequa ipsos secundum quod narraui tibi in restauratione digitorum manus.	 If fingers are broken, then restore them and even them as I have told you in the restoration of the fingers of the hand.
Deinde pone digito tuo astellam secundum longitudinem digiti, et sit latior eo parumper: deinde pone sub Pede hanc tabulam quam narraui tibi, et stringe eam strictura decenti.	 Then place a star-shaped splint on your finger according to the length of the finger, and it should be wider by a little; then place under the foot the table I have told you about, and bind it with a suitable bandage.
Si uero quod frangitur ex ossibus est duo, aut tria, aut plus, tunc pone super omnem digitum astellam suae quantitatis, inuolutam in panno lini: et stringe tabulam in inferiori Pedis: et sit stans super unum capitum tabulae extra uentrem Pedis, ut teneat retentione bona.	 If what breaks is two or more bones, then place a star-shaped splint over the entire finger wrapped in linen; bind the table under the foot; and let the table stand on one side of the foot outside the waist to hold it firmly with good support.
Et conuenit tibi, ut non obliuiscaris, quin consideres omnia quae dixi tibi in reliquis fracturis ex accidentibus quae diximus: et oppone omni accidenti cum eo quod oportet.	 It is appropriate for you to remember that you should consider all the things I told you about fractures from the accidents mentioned previously; and to apply each of these accidents with what is suitable.
¶ De fractura Vuluae mulieris, et ossis pectinis, et uirgae uiri.	 On the fracture of a woman's jaw, and the bone of the breastplate, and the man's phallus.
Caput XIX.	 Chapter XIX.
Quando frangitur Vulua mulieris, tunc fac eam sedere quadratam.	 When a woman's jaw is fractured, then make her sit upright.
Deinde inclina eam ad partem dorsi ipsius parumper, et teneatur retro.	 Then lean her towards the back of that side a little, and hold it in place.
Deinde impleat obstetrix Vuluam eius coto, donec impleat eam: et fiat in Vulua ex eo sicut sphera.	 Then fill her jaw with linen cloth until it is full; and make a ball of it within the jaw.
Deinde concutiatur mulier, et eleua dorsum eius paulatim.	 After that, strike the woman on the back, and rub the fracture gradually.
Illud enim cotum egreditur, donec fiat ante portam Vuluae sicut sphera, et os fractum redit.	 For this reason, the linen cloth comes out until it forms a ball before the jaw opening, and the broken bone returns to its place.
Deinde pone puluillum super dorsum eius.	 Then place some small stones on her back.
Quando ergo uult mingere, remoueat cotum cum facilitate, deinde mingat: et reduc ipsum secundum modum, quo intromisisti ipsum in primis: deinde redeat ad puluillum suum primum.	 Whenever she wishes to drink, let her remove the linen cloth easily, then drink; and reduce it according to how you first inserted it; then return to the small stones first.
Faciat illud septem diebus, aut circiter, os ipsum enim restauratur.	 Do this for seven days or approximately, because the bone will heal itself.
Et si uis, accipe uesicam ouis, et stringe super foramen eius cannulam arundinis, et intromitte uesicam totam in Vuluam eius.	 And if you wish, take the bladder of an ox and tie a reed tube around its opening, and insert the entire bladder into her jaw.
Deinde suffla in cannulam cum uirtute, donec infletur uesica intra Vuluam, fractura enim redit.	 Then blow through the tube with force until the bladder inflates within the jaw, because the fracture will return to its place.
Deinde impleatur cum coto, et stet aliquot diebus, secundum quod narrauimus, donec sanetur.	 Then it is filled with linen cloth and remains for some days as we have said, until it heals.
Et quando frangitur os Pectinis uiri, aut mulieris, tunc administra in restauratione eius, et ipsius aequatione illud quod narrauimus in osse Anchae.	 When the breastplate bone of a man or woman is fractured, then administer the same treatment as we have said for the bone of Ancha.
Et non occultatur rectum in his fracturis propinquis, quae parum contingunt, praecipue cui est quiddam studii, uel usus.	 And it is not concealed straight [bone] in such fractures which scarcely touch [it], especially when there is something of study or use involved.
Et intellige librum meum istum multum, quoniam fractura ipsa significat tibi in pluribus dispositionibus uiam rectam in restauratione sui, et strictura sui: intellige ergo.	 Understand my book well, for the fracture itself signifies to you in many dispositions the way of the straight [bone] in its restoration and its constriction; therefore understand it.
In Virga autem uiri quando frangitur, accipe guttur anseris: et intromitte uirgam in ipso.	 When the penis of a man is broken, take the neck of a goose and insert the rod into it.
Deinde pone super ipsum inuolutionem ex panno, et inuoluatur, et dimittatur tribus diebus, aut circiter eos, et sanabitur, si Deus uoluerit.	 Then place on top of it a covering made from cloth, and wrap it up, and let it be for three days or about that, and it will heal if God wills it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae ossium, quando est cum uulnere.	 Chapter on the restoration of bone fractures when there is a wound.
Caput XX.	 Chapter 20.
Conuenit ei cui accidit fractura cum uulnere, praecipue si est magnum, sicut os coxae, aut adiutorii, aut simile illi, ut properes, et phlebotomes ipsum statim: si attestantur tibi conditiones phlebotomiae, sicut praemisimus.	 It is suitable for him who has a fracture accompanied by a wound, especially if it is large like the hip bone or humerus, to hasten and call the blood-letter immediately; if the conditions of phlebotomy are testified to you as we have previously mentioned.
Quod si uulnus effluit sanguinem, tunc oportet, ut properes ad abscisionem eius, ita ut puluerizes super ipsum zegi tritum: si non est tibi praesens aliud.	 If the wound exudes blood, then it is necessary for you to hasten to its excision, so that you powder over it a mixture of chalk and lime; if no other [substance] is present to you.
Deinde incipe restaurare fracturam in illo eodem die: et non postponas illud, si non accidit apostema.	 Then begin the restoration of the fracture on that same day; and do not delay it, unless an abscess occurs.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte restaurationem eius usque ad diem nonum, donec sedetur apostema.	 If a hot abscess occurs, then wait for the restoration of it until the ninth day, until the abscess settles down.
Et non appropinques ei in die tertio, et quarto omnino, nam tu faceres ei accidere accidentia mala.	 And do not approach him on the third and fourth days at all, for you would cause him harm.
Si autem os fractum est eminens super cutem detectum: tunc oportet, ut coneris reducere ipsum, et aequare ipsum manibus tuis cum facilitate et extensione parua.	 If the broken bone is protruding above the skin exposed, then it is necessary to compress it and bring it back to its place with your hands easily and with little extension.
Si autem non praeparatur extensio eius, et ipsius aequatio manibus tuis: tunc reduc ipsum cum isto instrumento.	 If however the extension is not prepared, and the same is equal to your hands: then reduce it with this instrument.
Et est instrumentum quod fit ex ferro, cuius longitudo est quantitas septem digitorum, aut octo: et eius latitudo est secundum quantitatem uulneris.	 And is an instrument that is made of iron, the length of which is the amount of seven or eight fingers, and its width according to the size of the wound.
Et propter illud necesse est medico, ut accipiat ex eis tria, aut quatuor secundum quantitatem qua indiget ad illud ex curatione in omni specie fracturae.	 And therefore it is necessary for the physician to receive three or four according to the quantity that he needs for this in all types of fractures.
Et sit rotundum: et sit in eo grossitudo parua, ut non duplicetur apud compressionem super ipsum in hora operationis: et sit acutae extremitatis, cui sit margo in extremitatibus suis.	 And let it be round; and let there be a small thickness inside it so that it does not double up against the instrument during the operation within an hour; and let it have sharp ends with an edge on its ends.
Et sit superius eius ad grossitudinem ex medietate eius usque ad inferiora.	 And the top of it should be thick from the middle to the bottom.
Et haec est forma eius.	 This is its shape.
Oportet in Hac Operatione, ut ponatur extremitas eius acuta curuata super extremitatem ossis eminentis: et impelle ipsum cum eo uice una, donec quando redit os et aequatur quadam aequatione.	 In this operation, the sharp end should be placed on the protruding bone's edge; and push it with one blow until the bone returns and becomes equal to some degree.
Conare ergo aequare extremitates fracturae adinuicem.	 Try then to align the fracture's ends facing each other.
Quod si extremitates eius fracta est subtilis, et non accipit eam instrumentum accaeptione bona, tunc opotet, ut incidas extremitatem illius ossis, donec instrumentum potestatem habeat eius.	 If the ends of the fracture are subtle and do not accept the instrument well, then it is necessary to cut the bone's edge until the instrument can grasp it.
Si uero non potes reducere eos cum eo quod narrauimus omnino, tunc incide ipsum cum eo quod conuenit ei ex Incisoriis quae diximus: aut serra ipsum cum una serrarum quocunque modo possibile est tibi.	 But if you cannot reduce them with the instrument as we have said completely, then cut it with the saw that suits it from the incision tools that we have mentioned; or cut it with a pair of scissors in any way possible for you.
Deinde rade illud quod remanet in osse ex asperitate et corticibus minutis.	 Then file away what remains on the bone from roughness and small layers.
Cum ergo reducitur os, et inuenit infirmus post reductionem eius dolorem uehementem laedentem, tunc scias, quod os non rediit ad locum suum naturalem.	 When the bone is reduced, and after the reduction of it finds a weak point causing intense pain, then you know that the bone has not returned to its natural position.
Fac ergo illud.	 Make it.
Nam tu confers infirmo iuuamentum magnum, cum completur restauratio tua quam facis ossi.	 Thou conferrest great aid to the sick one, when thou complete the restoration that thou dost make of the bone.
Tunc submerge pannum in uino stiptico, nigro.	 Then immerse the cloth in stiptic wine, black.
Et proprie si est in aestate.	 And indeed it is appropriate in summer.
Et non ponas super uulnus caerotum, neque aliquid in quo sit oleum: ut non faciat accidere in ipso putredinem et corruptionem.	 And do not place over the wound black things, nor anything that contains oil: so that it does not cause putrefaction and corruption at the wound.
Deinde administra astellas in hora complementi tui a restauratione ossis.	 Then administer the astella in the hour of your completion of the bone restoration.
Et dimitte uulnus detectum: ita, ut incidas cum forficibus foramen in inuolutionibus secundum quantitatem uulneris.	 And leave the detected wound: so that you cut with the forceps a hole in the swellings according to the size of the wound.
Et caue omni cautela, ne stringas uulnus cum fractura.	 Take care to avoid at all costs that you bind the wound during the fracture.
Multotiens enim fecerunt istud stolidi medici: et fecerunt accidere super infirmos suos aut mortem, aut corrosionem, aut zuchem, id est, saniem.	 For many times have foolish doctors done this: and they caused death or corruption, or gangrene, that is, pus, upon the sick.
Et sit strictura tua mollis, lenis, diuersa stricturae fracturarum reliquarum.	 Let your binding be soft, gentle, diverse binding from other fractures.
Quod si uulnus est malum, aut est uulnus magnum, et times super ipsum quaedam accidentia mala quae narrauimus, et inuenis dolorem in loco suspensum: tunc non oportet, ut ponas super ipsum astellas.	 If the wound is bad or the wound is large and you fear certain evil accidents that we have mentioned, and you find pain suspended at the place: then it is not necessary that you place astella over it.
Et fac eis inuolutiones ex pannis duris in loco astellarum, et stringe ipsum cum eis.	 And make swellings from stiff cloth in place of astella and bind it with them.
Cum autem est post diem unum, aut dies duos, et uides uulnus iam incipere, ut in eo generetur pus: tunc aufer desuper ipsum pannum quem posuisti super ipsum cum uino.	 But when it is one day or two days and you see that the wound begins to produce pus: then take away from above the cloth that you placed over it with wine.
Deinde administra licinia, et unguenta cum quibus de consuetudine nostra est, ut medicemur uulnera: sicut unguentum tetrapharmacon, et similia illi.	 Then administer linen and ointments with which it is our custom to treat wounds: such as tetrapharmacon ointment and similar ones.
Et conuenit tibi, ut soluas ligamentum.	 It is appropriate for you that you loosen the binding.
Et considera uulnus in omni die mane et uespere, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	 Consider the wound every day at morning and evening until it is consolidated and healed.
Et oportet, ut praeparetur membrum taliter, ut currat ex eo pus ad inferiora cum facilitate.	 It is necessary that the limb should be prepared in such a way that pus runs out of it easily towards the lower parts.
Quod si praetereunt uulneri dies multi, et non consolidatur, neque abscinditur pus ab eo: tunc scias, quod illic sunt satagie ossis parua.	 If several days pass without the wound healing and the pus is not expelled from it, then you will know that there are small bones there.
Quare oportet, ut inquiras uulnus cum tenta.	 Therefore, one should examine the wound with a probe.
Quot uero ex illis alsatagie sunt separata, remoue ea, et extrahe ipsa.	 As many of these small bones as are separated, remove them and extract them.
Et quae ex eis sunt non separata, et pungunt membrum, et faciunt accidere dolorem, conare incidere ea, et auferre ea omni modo quo possibile est tibi illud.	 And those which are not separated and pierce the limb and cause pain, try to cut them and remove them in any way possible for you.
Quod si accidat uulneri zuchen, aut ekileten, id est, estiomenus, aut species alia corruptionis et putrefactionis: tunc oportet, ut opponas unicuique ex eis cum eo quod conuenit ei ex curatione, cuius praecessit narratio in capitulo suo.	 If there occurs a tumor or ulcer on the wound, that is to say, if it is an abscess or another form of corruption and putrefaction: then it is necessary to apply to each of these with what is suitable for its cure, which was described in its chapter.
Et ex eo in quo oportet ut stet sermo meus, et cui facias praesentem mentem tuam quando frangitur os, et eminet super membrum, sicut os coxae, et adiutorii, et similia eis ex membris magnis, est, ut non praesumas attractionem eius, multotiens enim accidit ex illo mors, imo dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat.	 And in the discussion from which my speech is required when a bone breaks and protrudes on the limb, such as the hip or the arm, and similar large bones, it is not to be presumed that one can attract it, for often death occurs from this; rather leave it alone until it has rotted away.
Fortasse enim cadet per se post uiginti dies, aut triginta.	 Perhaps it will fall off by itself after twenty or thirty days.
Tunc ergo cura uulnus, si uidetur tibi: et sinon, dimitte ipsum.	 Therefore, treat the wound if you see fit; otherwise, leave it alone.
¶ De curatione Nodationis in uestigio fracturae.	 Chapter on the treatment of swelling in a fracture.
Caput XXI.	 Chapter 21.
Multoties accidit haec Nodatio in uestigio sanationis fracturae.	 Often this swelling occurs in the healing of a fracture.
Praecipue, quae est prope iuncturas: et foedatur ex ea figura membri.	 Most often it is near the joints; and it corrupts the shape of the limb.
Et fortasse prohibet membrum ab operatione sua naturali.	 And perhaps it prevents the limb from performing its natural functions.
Considera ergo tunc, si nodatio est recens: administra in ea medicinas quae stipticitatem habent, sicut aloe, et olibanum, et myrrha, et sarcocolla, et acacia, et similia eis.	 Therefore, if the swelling is new, administer medications that have astringent properties, such as aloes, olibanum, myrrh, sarcocolla, acacia and similar remedies.
Ita, ut accipias ex istis quasdam, aut omnes eas: et confice eas cum uino stiptico, aut cum albumine oui, aut cum aceto: et pone eas super nodationem in stuppa, et stringe eas super ipsam strictura bona.	 Thus, take some or all of them, and suture them with sticky wine, or with egg white, or with vinegar; and place them on the knot, and tighten them well on the good constriction itself.
Et dimitte stricturam, nec soluas eam diebus multis.	 And leave the suture, do not loosen it for many days.
Deinde solue eam, et itera aliam, donec remoueatur nodatio.	 Then loosen it and make another one until the knot is removed.
Aut stringe super ipsam laminam plumbi decenter.	 Or suture it well on the lead sheet.
Plumbo enim est proprietas remouendi omne quod timetur ex membris.	 For lead has the property of removing everything that is feared from the limbs.
Si autem nodatio iam in lapidem conuersa est, et stricta est, et festine prouocat necessitas ad auferendum eam: tunc finde super eam ex superiori parte eius, et incide superfluitatem eminentem: aut rade eam cum quibusdam rasoriis, donec remoueatur: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 If the knot has already turned to stone and been hardened, and urgently calls for its removal: then make an incision above it on the superior part, and cut off the excess protruding; or grind it with certain rasps until it is removed; and care for it until it heals.
¶ De curatione quando restauratur, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, non secundum naturam suam.	 \paragraph{On the treatment of when the limb is restored, and remains subtle after that, not according to its own nature.}
Caput XXII.	 Chapter XXII.
Quando restauratur fractura ossis, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, debile: tunc non fit illud nisi propter caussas multas.	 When a bone fracture is restored and the limb remains subtle and weak after that, it should not be made unless for many reasons.
Quarum una est, multitudo solutionis ligamenti et ligationis eius non secundum quod oportet: aut propter superfluitatem stricturae ligamentorum, donec prohibeatur nutrimentum currere ad membrum: aut propter multitudinem embrocationis superfluae in non sua hora: aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore infirmi, et debilitatem eius.	 One of the reasons is the excessive solution and tying of the ligament not as required; or due to the excess tightness of the ligaments until it prevents nourishment from reaching the limb; or due to the excessive embrocation at an inappropriate time; or due to the scarcity of blood in the body of the sick and its weakness.
Et curatio illius est, cibare infirmum, et tenerum facere corpus eius, donec multiplicetur sanguis in eo.	 And the treatment of this is, to feed the sick, and make his body soft until the blood multiplies in him.
Et administra balneum.	 And administer a bath.
Et intromitte gaudium et laeticiam super eum.	 And introduce joy and happiness over him.
Deinde pone picem super membrum: ut attrahat pix ad ipsum nutrimentum multum.	 Then place pitch on the limb: so that the pitch attracts much nourishment to it.
Et assiduet embrocationem eius cum aqua tepida, donec currat nutrimentum, et redeat ad figuram suam naturalem.	 Apply embrocation to it with warm water until the nourishment runs, and return it to its natural shape.
¶ De curatione ossium fractorum quando restaurantur tortuose.	 On the cure of fractured bones when they are restored twistedly.
Caput XXIII.	 Chapter Twenty-Three.
Quando accidit membro iam restaurato post sanationem eius tortuositas, et eminentia ossi fracto, aut nodatio: et foedatur per illud forma membri, uerumtamen membrum non prohibetur ab operatione sua naturali: tunc non oportet ut recipias sermonem eius, qui existimat, ut frangatur membrum denuo.	 When a restored member, having been cured of its deformity and the protrusion of a fractured bone or nodule, becomes disfigured due to such condition; yet, it does not prohibit the natural operation of the limb; then, it is not necessary that you heed the speech of one who proposes breaking the limb anew.
Et iam fuerunt multi stolidorum medicorum et restauratorum, qui fecerunt illud in terra nostra.	 And indeed there have been many foolish physicians and restorers, who did this in our land.
Et haec quidem operatio est uituperabilis ualde, perducens ad mortem, uel timorem magnum, ut scilicet sit mortalis.	 And this operation is highly condemnable, leading to death or great fear, indeed it should be feared as lethal.
Verum si claudicatio et nodatio sunt recentes: tunc oportet, ut embrocetur cum aqua tepida, in qua decoctae sint herbae mollificantes, sicut folia alteae, et radix eius, et mellilotum, et illis similia.	 However, if the limping and nodulation are recent; then it is necessary to immerse [the affected area] in warm water, into which have been boiled softening herbs such as elder leaves, its root, sweet clover, and similar plants.
Et fiat ei emplastrum cum emplastro mollificatiuo, sicut dyachilon decenter factum.	 And make for it a plaster with a softening plaster like well-made dyachilon.
Aut sumatur mucilago radicis alteae, et concutiatur cum adipe gallinae, aut oleo sisamino: et emplastretur cum eo.	 Or take the mucilage from elder root, pound it with chicken fat or sesame oil; and apply it as a plaster.
Aut sumantur ficus pingues, et terantur cum fimo columbino, et similibus eis quae nominantur ex medicinis diminuentes consolidationem.	 Or take the ripe figs, pulverize them with dove droppings and similar remedies that reduce hardening.
Et quandoque soluitur nodatio cum fricatione assidua, antiqua, et leni, quae fit cum manibus humidis.	 And sometimes the nodule dissolves through persistent, old-fashioned, and gentle rubbing, which is done with moist hands.
Et administretur motus membri ad omnem partem in horis omnibus.	 And exercise the limb fully in all directions daily.
Si autem tortuositas iam antecessit, et fortis facta est, et conuersa est in lapidem, et prouocata est necessitas ad curatonem eius cum ferro: tunc oportet, ut secetur superius eius, et soluatur continuatio ossis, et incidatur quod superfluit ex nodatione aut osse cum Incisoriis subtilibus: et administretur facilitas in illo cum sollicitudine et studio.	 If the deformity has already occurred, and it has become strong, and has turned into a stone, and there is necessity for treatment with iron; then it is necessary to cut off its upper part, and to dissolve the continuation of the bone, and to incise what protrudes from the nodule or bone with subtle chisels; and apply ease in this with diligence and care.
¶ De sermone in Dislocatione.	 On Speech in Dislocations.
Caput XXIIII.	 Chapter XXIV.
Dislocatio est exitus alicuius iuncturarum a loco suo.	 Dislocation is the displacement of some joints from their place.
Quare prohibetur a motu suo, et foedatur figura membri.	 Why it should be prevented from moving and becomes disfigured in shape (or appearance) of the member.
Et facit accidere super infirmum dolores, et laesiones uehementes.	 And causes falling upon the weak pain, and severe injuries.
Quando ergo accidit alicui dislocatio, tunc oportet festinare ad restaurationem eius: neque tardet eam omnino.	 When therefore dislocation occurs to someone, then it is necessary to hasten for its restoration: nor should one delay it at all.
Nam si tardatur, apostematur locus, et fortasse cum eo reductio dislocationis.	 For if delayed, the location will be lost, and perhaps with it the reduction of dislocation.
Propter illud ergo non oportet, ut moueatur, neque extendatur in hora apostemationis eius.	 Therefore, it should not be moved or extended during its relocation hour (or time of resetting).
Quoniam multotiens facit accidere spasmum, et dolores laedentes.	 For because it often causes falling into a spasm, and painful injuries.
Verum quando accidit illud, tunc oportet, ut properes ad phlebotomiam infirmi.	 But when this happens, then it is necessary that you hasten to the bloodletting of the weak.
Deinde dimittatur, donec quiescat apostema.	 Then it should be left until the abscess subsides (or becomes calm).
Deinde embrocetur membrum cum aqua calida et oleo.	 Then let the limb be wrapped with warm water and oil.
Deinde reducatur cum facilitate.	 Then it should be reduced gently.
Et curetur omne membrum cum eo cuius rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	 And all the limbs should be treated together, with that one whose recollection comes back to its place (or position).
Ego quidem iam ordinaui capitula dislocationis, etiam secundum quod praecessit in fractura, a superiori parte corporis usque ad inferiorem eius.	 I myself have already ordered the chapters on dislocations, even according to what precedes in fracture, from the upper part of the body down to the lower part.
¶ De cura dislocationis Mandibulae inferioris.	 Chapter on care for lower jaw dislocation.
Caput XXV.	 Chapter XXV.
Parum dislocantur duae Mandibulae nisi raro.	 The two lower jaws are seldom dislocated.
Et dislocatio ambarum fit secundum unum duoru modorum.	 And dislocation of both occurs in one of two ways.
Aut enim remouentur a locis suis remotione parua, et mollificantur parumper.	 Or they are removed from their places slightly and softened slightly (or temporarily).\] Et aut dislocatur una ex eis, altera autem restat in situ suo.
Aut dislocantur dislocatione integra, completa, donec mollificentur ad partem pectoris, donec currat saliua infirmi, et non possit tenere eam, neque possit claudere os suum, et inuoluatur lingua eius cum sermone.	 The dislocation is to be reduced by integration, completely, until it softens towards the chest, until the saliva of the weak runs and it cannot hold her, nor can it close its own mouth, and his tongue is rolled up with speech.
Quando autem dislocatio eius est parua, tunc redit in pluribus dispositionibus per se cum paucitate.	 When the dislocation is slight, then, by itself, it returns in many ways with a little effort.
Si uero est dislocatio completa, integra: tunc oportet, ut administretur reductio eius uelociter, et non tardetur penitus: et est, ut teneat minister caput infirmi: et intromittat medicus pollicem manus suae unius in radicem Mandibulae dislocationis inter os eius, si dislocatio est a parte una.	 If the dislocation is complete and whole, then it must be quickly administered the reduction of it and should not delay greatly; and there is to be one who holds the head of the weak, and the physician inserts his thumb of one hand into the root of the dislocated jawbone if the dislocation is from one side.
Aut intromittat duos pollices suos simul, si dislocatio est a duabus partibus.	 Or, he inserts two thumbs at once, if the dislocation is from both sides.
Et reliqui digiti manuum eius sint extra, quibus aequet.	 And the remaining fingers of his hands are to be outside, with which it is equally held.
Et praecipe infirmo, ut mundificet Mandibulas suas, et absoluat eas ad manducandum ad omnem partem.	 And order the weak one to cleanse his jawbones and purify them for eating in every respect.
Et medicus aequet Mandibulam, et impellat Mandibulam, donec redeat ad locum suum.	 And the physician presses and pushes the jawbone until it returns to its place.
Quod si difficilis sit reductio eius, praecipue si sunt ambae Mandibulae simul: tunc administra uaporationem cum aqua calida, et oleo, donec fiat facilis reductio ambarum: neque tardes reductionem ambarum omnino, sicut diximus.	 If the reduction is difficult, especially if both jawbones are dislocated at once: then administer vaporization with hot water and oil until the reduction of both becomes easy; do not delay the reduction of both in any way, as we have said.
Cum ergo redeunt et aequantur, et clauditur os infirmi, et non mollificantur: tunc pone super eas puluillos pannorum, cum ceroto quod sit factum ex cera: et oleo rosato.	 When they return and align, and the mouth of the weak one is closed, and they do not become soft: then place over them small pieces of cloth, with beeswax that has been made, and scented oil.
Deinde ligetur cum facilitate cum ligamentis mollibus.	 Then it is to be bound gently with soft ligaments.
Et sit somnus infirmi super dorsum suum: et caput eius sit stans inter duo puluinaria, ut non moueat ipsum ad dextram et sinistram: neque conetur, uel cogatur masticare aliquid: imo ponatur cibus eius sorbitio lenis, donec quando remouentur dolores, et nodatur Mandibula: tunc comedat quod uult, et administretur illud cum facilitate.	 And the sleep of the weak one is on his back; and his head is standing between two pillows so that it does not move to the right and left; nor should he be forced or compelled to chew something; rather, let his food be soft sorbitio, until when the pains are removed, and the jawbone is loosened: then he can eat what he wants, and it is administered gently.
Non laboret super operationem oris sui apud comestionem et potum, et oscitationem, donec nodetur Mandibula, et sanetur.	 Do not let him eat or drink, nor speak, at his mouth operation, until the mandible is healed and it is cured.
Quod si difficilis fiat reductio duarum Mandibuiarum, quando dislocantur in hora aliqua, et non conuertuntur ad loca sua: tunc multotiens accidunt inde febres, et soda assidua: et fortasse soluitur uenter infirmi, et fortasse uomit choleram puram.	 If the reduction of the two mandibles becomes difficult when they are dislocated at some hour and do not return to their places: then frequently fevers occur, and an abscess continuous; and perhaps the weak stomach dissolves, and perhaps it vomits pure cholema.
Cum ergo uides illud: tunc scias, quia est perditio, et multotiens moritur ille cui accidit illud in decem diebus.	 When you see that (thing), then know that it is a disaster, and he who has it frequently dies within ten days.
¶ De reducione dislocationis Furculae, et extremitatis humeri.	 Section on the reduction of dislocation of clavicle, and the extremity of the humerus.
Caput XXVI.	 Chapter 26.
Furcula quidem non dislocatur ex latere intrinseco, propter continuationem suam cum pectore.	 The clavicle is not dislocated from the inside side, because of its connection with the chest.
Et dislocatur quandoque ad exteriora: et declaratur illud sensui.	 And it is sometimes dislocated towards the outside: and this becomes clear to sensation.
Et restauratio eius est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat brachia sua.	 The restoration is that the weak one lies on his back and extends his arms.
Deinde coarta locum cum palma tua coartatione forti, nam ipsa redibit.	 Then empty the place with your firm grasp, for it will return to its place.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stringe eam.	 Then place the plaster on it and the little pills, and press it down.
Extremitates uero eius quae sequuntur cubitum, et continuantur cum eo, non dislocantur, nisi raro.	 The extremities that follow the elbow do not dislocate except rarely.
Quod si dislocatur die aliquo: tunc oportet, ut reducatur et aequetur secundum quod diximus, et quod praeparatur tibi.	 If it is dislocated on any day: then it must be returned to its place and made equal according to what was said, and what has been prepared for you.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam.	 Then place the plaster on it, and pills, and a bandage.
Et praecipe infirmo, adhaerere tranquillitati et quieti, donec sanetur.	 And command the weak one, to hold onto tranquility and rest until he is healed.
Et cum hac eadem curatione reducitur extremitas Humeri, quando separatur etiam a loco suo.	 With this same treatment, the elbow joint is returned when it also separates from its place.
¶ De reductione dislocationis Humeri.	 Chapter on the reduction of shoulder dislocation.
Caput XXVII.	 Chapter XXVII.
Scias, quod Humerus non dislocatur, nisi secundum tres modos.	 Know that the shoulder does not dislocate except in three ways.
Quorum unus est, ut dislocetur ad partem titillici ad inferiora.	 One is, it dislocates to the side of touching towards the lower part.
Secundus est, ut dislocetur ad partem pectoris.	 The second is, it dislocates towards the chest.
Et fortasse dislocatur ad superiorem partem Humeri: et illud fit raro.	 And perhaps it is dislocated to the upper part of the shoulder: and that happens rarely.
Et non dislocatur ad posteriora, propter spatulam.	 It does not dislocate towards the back, due to the spine of the scapula.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora, propter neruos.	 It does not dislocate towards the front, due to nerves.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur et egreditur ad inferiora uersus titillicum: praecipue in illis, quorum carnes sunt paucae.	 Most often it dislocates and exits towards the lower side, turned towards the side of touching; especially in those whose flesh is scanty.
Quoniam egrediur in eis uelociter, et ingreditur uelociter.	 Because it quickly comes out in them and enters quickly.
In illis autem quorum carnes sunt multae, est econtrario illius, scilicet quia egreditur cum difficultate, et ingreditur cum difficultate.	 In those whose flesh is numerous, there is contrarily its counterpart, namely because it exits with difficulty, and enters with difficulty.
Et fortasse accidit quibusdam hominibus percussio, aut casus, et apostematur Humerus apostemate calido, et putatur propter illud, quia iam dislocatus est.	 And perhaps it happens to some people a blow or accident and the humerus is amputated with hot amputation tool and it is believed because of that it has already been dislocated.
Oportet ergo, ut experiaris illud, donec stes super certitudinem eius, et tunc procedas in curatione eius.	 Therefore, one should test it so as to be certain of its truth and then proceed with its treatment.
Et cognoscitur dislocatio, quando est ad inferiora uersus titillicum: et distinguas inter Humerum dislocatum, et humerum sanum.	 A dislocation is recognized when it faces downwards towards the tip of the elbow; and you should distinguish between a dislocated shoulder and a healthy one.
Nam tu inuenis inter eos diuersitatem manifestam, et inuenis in capite Humeri concauitatem, et sub titillico apud tactum caput humeri quasi ipsum sit ouum: et non potest infirmus reducere manum ad aurem suam, neque mouere eam omnibus motibus.	 For you find among them an obvious difference, and in the head of the shoulder you find a hollow, and beneath the tip of the elbow at touch, it seems like an egg; and an invalid cannot bring his hand to his ear, nor move it with all movements.
Et similiter, si dislocatur uersus pectus, aut ad sursum: tunc inuenis manifestum tactum, neque occultatur.	 And similarly, if it is dislocated towards the chest or upwards: then you find a clear touch and it is not hidden.
Et huius quidem dislocationis fit facilis reductio, quando est recens, aut infirmus est puer.	 This kind of dislocation can be easily reduced when it is recent or if the child is weak.
Et reductio eius est, ut eleuet minister manum suam ad superiora.	 The reduction of this kind is that the hand should lift itself towards the upper part.
Deinde pone tu pollices tuos sub titillico eius, et eleua iuncturam cum fortitudine ad sursum ad locum suum: et minister eleuet manum suam, et extendat eam ad sursum.	 Then place your thumbs under the tip of his, and lift the joint with strength to its place; and let the hand lift itself and stretch it upwards.
Deinde ponat eam inferius, ipse enim redit uelociter.	 Then put it down below, for it will return quickly by itself.
Si autem non redit per illud quod diximus, et sunt a principio quo accidit dislocatio dies multi: tunc oportet, ut balneetur infirmus in aqua calida, et administretur embrocatio quae mollificat et lenit, sicut si decoquantur radices alteae, et foenugraecum, et mellilotum in aqua, et administretur.	 But if it does not return according to what has been said, and there are many days since the dislocation occurred: then it is necessary to bathe the invalid in warm water, and administer an embrocation that softens and soothes, such as if they boil the roots of althea, fenugreek and mellilotus in water, and administer it.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et ponatur sub titillico eius sphera et lana, quae sit aequalis inter lenitatem et stricturam.	 Then, the sick one shall lie on his back: and let there be placed under his navel sphere and wool, which is equal in thickness between softness and tightness.
Deinde ponat medicus calcaneum suum super spheram, et eleuet caput humeri cum uirtute, et attrahat manum infirmi ad inferiora.	 Then the physician shall place his heel upon the sphere, and lift up the head of the arm with force, and draw the hand of the sick one downwards.
Et minister alius teneat caput infirmi, ut non moueatur ad inferiora: ipse namque redit statim.	 And another servant shall hold the head of the sick one, so that it is not moved downwards: for he himself will return immediately.
Et si uis, reduc eum secundum modum hunc: et est, ut facias esse praesentem uirum qui sit longior infirmo, et stet a parte lateris, et intromittat humerum suum sub titillico infirmi: et eleuet titillicum eius ad superiora, donec sit infirmus suspensus in aere.	 And if you wish, bring him back in this manner: and it is, that you make a man who is taller than the sick one to stand by his side, and insert his arm under the navel of the sick one: and lift up the navel of the sick one towards the upper part, until the sick one is suspended in the air.
Et minister alius trahat manum infirmi ad inferiora uentris eius.	 And another servant shall draw the hand of the sick one to the lower part of his belly.
Si autem infirmus est leuis: tunc oportet, ut suspendatur cum eo aliquid aliud, ut grauet ipsum: nam redit dislocatio statim.	 If the sick one is light: then it is necessary that something else be suspended with him to weigh him down; for a dislocation returns immediately.
Et reducitur etiam secundum modum alium: et est, ut figatur in terra lignum longum, cuius caput sit rotundum figura: sicut manica mortarii: quod non sit grossum, neque subtile.	 And another method is also returned: and it is, that a long piece of wood be formed on the ground, whose head is round in shape, like the handcuff of a miller; but not too thick or too thin.
Deinde ponatur sub infirmo postquam ponuntur super caput ligni panni lenes: et infirmus sit stans secundum longitudinem ligni.	 Then let there be placed under the sick one, after the head of the wood is placed, soft cloths: and the sick one shall stand according to the length of the wood.
Deinde extendatur manus eius ad inferiora a parte altera, et extendatur corpus eius ab altera parte cum fortitudine: nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	 Then his hand shall be stretched out to the lower part from one side, and his body shall be extended from the other side with force: for the union returns to its place with speed.
Quod si difficilis sit eius reductio per omnia quae diximus, tunc utere hac cura: et est, ut accipias lignum cuius longitudo sit quantitas duorum brachiorum, et eius latitudo quantitas quatuor digitorum, et grossitudo eius quantitas duorum digitorum: cui sit caput rotundum, ut alleuietur introitus eius in profundum titillici, secundum hanc formam.	 If the reduction is difficult through all that has been said, then use this remedy: and it is, that you take a piece of wood whose length is the size of two arms, and its width is the size of four fingers, and its thickness is the size of two fingers; and let its head be round to facilitate the entrance into the deep navel, according to this shape.
Deinde ligentur super caput rotundum panni lenes, ut non laedat lignum infirmum.	 Then, soft cloths shall be bound over the rounded head, so as not to injure the weak wood.
Deinde ponatur sub titillico infirmi, ut extendatur manus, aut brachium super lignum usque ad inferiora: et ligetur lignum super adiutorium et brachium et extremitatem manus.	 Then, place under the trembling of the weak one, so that the hand or arm can be extended over the wood until the lower parts; and tie the wood with assistance, and the arm and the end of the hand.
Deinde ponatur brachium super gradum scalae per latitudinem, et extendatur manus ad inferiora, et dimittatur reliquum corpus suspensum a parte altera.	 Then, place the arm over the step of the ladder at its width, and extend the hand to the lower parts, and let the remaining body be suspended from the other side.
Iunctura enim ingreditur statim.	 For this reason, join immediately.
Cum ergo completur introitus eius secundum quemcunque modum possibile est: tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico spheram aequalis quantitatis ex lana.	 When the opening for it is completed in whatever way possible: then it is necessary that you place under the trembling sphere of equal quantity from wool.
Deinde pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum olibano, et albumine oui super humerum totum, sicut reuoluitur desuper.	 Then place the prepared plaster from milled powder with olibanum and egg white over the whole shoulder as it is turned upside down.
Deinde stringe sub titillico strictura decenti: et reuoluatur ligamentum super emplastrum desuper: et annectatur manus eius ad collum ipsius, et dimittatur, neque moueatur manus eius septem diebus.	 Then bind under the trembling tie of suitable size; and roll up the bandage over the plaster above; and attach his hand to his neck, and let it not be moved for seven days.
Et oportet, ut ponatur cibus infirmipaucus, donec confortetur membrum: quoniam est uelocius ad sanationem eius.	 It is necessary that a small amount of food be placed, until the limb is strengthened; since it is quicker for its healing.
Deinde ponatur amplior post septem dies, aut quinque, et ex ercitetur cum motu.	 Then, place it larger after seven days or five, and let it be shaken with motion.
Si ergo firmatur et non mollificatur, tunc iam sanatus est.	 If it is strengthened and does not become soft, then it has been healed.
Si uero iunctura dislocatur multotiens, propter humiditatem quae accidit ei, aut propter caussam aliam: tunc oportet, ut administretur in ea cauterium cum tribus foraminibus, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo de cauterio.	 But if the joint is dislocated many times, because of the moisture that happens to it, or for another reason: then it is necessary, to administer cautery on it with three holes, according to what was mentioned in the chapter on cautery.
Quod si fiat hoc totum, et soluatur ligamentum post septem dies, et non confirmetur iunctura, et reducatur emplastrum et strictura super ipsum aliquotiens, et non firmetur, et cadat, et non possit eleuare ipsum ad superiora: tunc scias, quod nerui eius qui sunt ad caput humeri, iam incisi sunt, aut extensi, aut mollificati: et scias, quod iunctura nunquam figetur in loco suo.	 If all this is done and the bandage is loosened after seven days, and the joint does not become strengthened, and the plaster and tie are not placed over it again, and it does not become firm, and falls, and cannot be raised to above: then you will know that the nerves of the neck at the shoulder have been cut or stretched or softened; and you will know that the joint never heals in its place.
Dislocationis autem quae fit uersus pectus et mammillam, aut ad posteriora reductio, fit cum impulsione et extensione cum manibus: donec redeat, et administretur in ea reliqua strictura et cura, donec sanetur.	 Dislocations that occur towards the chest and breast, or are reduced to the rear, are accomplished by pushing and extending with the hands, until it returns, and treatment and restraint are administered in it until it heals.
Quod si accidat post sanationem grauitas in membro, et tarditas in motu eius, tunc utatur infirmus balneo multotiens, donec leniatur illa grauitas, et redeat ad naturam eius primam.	 If pain or sluggishness in the limb occurs after healing, then the weak should use baths often, until the pain is relieved and it returns to its natural state.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Cubiti.	 Chapter on the treatment of shoulder dislocations.
Caput XXVIII.	 Chapter 28.
Scias, quod iunctura Cubiti dislocatur cum difficultate, et similiter redit cum difficultate etiam: et ipsa quidem dislocatur ad omnes partes, et praecipue ad anteriorem, aut ad posteriorem.	 Know that the union of the shoulder joint is dislocated with difficulty and also returns with difficulty; and indeed it is dislocated in all directions, but especially towards the front or rear.
Et eius dislocatio non occultatur tibi: quoniam est cadens sub uisu, et sub tactu, secundum quamcunque figuram dislocetur.	 And the dislocation of this joint will not be hidden from you; since it falls under your sight and touch, according to whatever form it is dislocated.
Et quando coniungis cubitum dislocatum cum sano, declaratur tibi illud manifeste.	 And when you join a dislocated shoulder with a healthy one, the dislocation is revealed clearly to you.
Concauatur enim iunctura, et non potest duplicare brachium, neque tangere cum eo humerum suum.	 For the joint will be hollowed out, and it cannot double the arm, nor touch its own humerus with it.
Et oportet, ut properes, et reducas dislocationem statim, antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	 And it is necessary that you hasten and reduce the dislocation immediately, before a warm abscess occurs.
Nam si accidit ei apostema calidum, difficilis fit eius reductio: et fortasse non sanatur omnino, praecipue quando est ad posteriora.	 For if a warm abscess occurs, the reduction becomes difficult; and perhaps it will not heal at all, especially when towards the rear.
Est enim deterior omnibus speciebus dislocationis, et uehementioris doloris eis: et multotiens descendit cum ea mors.	 For of all kinds of dislocations, it is worse in every way, and more painful; and death often accompanies it many times.
Et restauratio eius quando est ex eis quae possibile est reducere, est, ut extendatur manus eius cum duabus manibus: et brachium eius sit expansum, et manus medici sint supra cubitum et sub eo, et ipse impellat iuncturam cum pollicibus manuum suarum simul, aut cum radice palmae suae, donec redeat ad locum suum.	 And the restoration of this, when it can be reduced, is as follows: extend the hand with two hands; let the arm be spread out, and the hands of the doctor to be above and below the shoulder, and he himself should push the joint with his thumb or the root of his palm until it returns to its place.
Aut uero dislocatio est ad anteriora: tunc redit ita, ut duplicet manum cum manu sua, donec percutiat cum radice palmae suae cubitum qui est dislocatus.	 If it is a dislocation to the front: then return it so that he separates his hand with his hand until he strikes with the root of his palm the elbow which is dislocated.
Quod si non obedit dislocatio ad reductionem, tunc administra extensionem uehementem, fortem ualde: et est, ut extendant brachium duo ministri: et teneant ipsum duo ministri etiam, ut non remoueatur apud extensionem.	 If the dislocation does not obey to reduction, then administer a violent and strong traction; and it is such that two attendants stretch the arm; and the two attendants also hold it, so that it is not moved during the traction.
Deinde reuoluatur brachium ad omnem partem postquam inuoluitur super manum eius pannus duplicatus longus, aut ligamentum latum.	 Then the arm is turned to every part when it falls upon his hand, a cloth doubled long or a wide bandage is applied over it.
Et quando tangit medicus manu sua iuncturam, inungat ipsam cum oleo: ut sit illud ex eis quae adiuuant in lubricitate iuncturae cum facilitate.	 And when the doctor touches with his hand the joint, he anoints it with oil; so that it is from those which aid in lubricity of the joint with facility.
Deinde impellat iuncturam impulsione uehementi, donec redeat.	 Then push the joint forcefully until it returns.
Et post reductionem eius oportet, ut ponatur super ipsam emplastrum, in quo sit stipticitas, et exiccatio cum albugine oui: et stringatur strictura decenti.	 After its reduction, it is necessary that a plaster be placed on it, containing the stiptic and the application of white wax; and to bind with a suitable ligature.
Et suspendatur brachium a collo infirmi: et dimitte diebus aliquot.	 Suspend the arm from the neck of the patient; and leave for some days.
Deinde soluatur.	 Then loosen it.
Si ergo firmatur iunctura in loco suo, tunc solue ligamentum ab ea, et dimitte ipsam.	 If the joint is fixed in its place, then loosen the bandage from it, and leave it.
Et si uides iuncturam non bene stringi, tunc itera emplastrum, et ligamentum, et dimitte ipsam diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	 And if you see the joint not bound well, then apply a new plaster, and bandage, and leave it for some days until it is bound.
Deinde solue ipsam.	 Then loosen it.
Si autem accidit ei grauitas post reductionem iuncturae, et dispositio sit in motu: tunc administra humectationem in balneatione, et fricationem subtilem, et compressionem, donec liniatur, aut pone super iuncturam iliati, id est, natem arietis pinguem.	 If, after the reduction of the joint, there is pain and its position is in motion: then administer humectation in bathing, and subtle friction, and compression, until it is lined, or place over the joint a goat's fat tail, that is, a thick grease.
Deinde ligetur, et dimitte ipsam super eam die et nocte.	 Then bind it and leave it on it day and night.
Deinde aufer eam, et intromitte ipsum in balneum.	 Then remove it, and immerse him in the bath.
Cum ergo sudat, tunc frica iuncturam fricatione temperata.	 When therefore it sweats, then rub the junction with moderate rubbing.
Deinde itera super ipsam aleliati uice una, et secunda, et tertia cum introitu balnei, donec leniatur.	 Then again apply it to the same three times, with the beginning of the bath, until it becomes soft.
Et si uis, pone super ipsam stercus uaccinum, humidum, calefactum cum butyro, et stringe super ipsum.	 And if you wish, place upon it dung of sheep, moist and warmed with butter, and press upon it.
Fac illud aliquotiens.	 Make that frequently.
Ipsa namque lenitur, et redit ad dispositionem suam.	 It becomes soft, and returns to its former state.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Almahassem.	 Chapter on the cure of dislocation by Al-Zahrawi (Albucasis).
Caput XXIX.	 Chapter XXIX.
Mahassem manus multotiens dislocatur, id est, iunctura quae est inter brachium et manum.	 Mahassem's hand is often dislocated, that is, the junction between arm and hand.
Et reductio dislocationis eius est facilis.	 The reduction of this dislocation is easy.
Econtrario reliquarum iuncturarum.	 Contrariwise, other joints.
Verumtamen oportet, ut uelocitas sit in reductione dislocationis eius in hora in qua dislocatur, antequam apostemetur locus: aut accidat in eo apostema calidum.	 However, it is necessary that swiftness be in the reduction of this dislocation at the hour it occurs, before the place is evacuated; or a hot abscess may occur there.
Et reductio dislocationis in eo est, ut ponas Mahassem manus infirmae super tabulam, et extendat minister manum eius: et ponat medicus palmam suam super eminentiam iuncturae, et impellat eam, donec redeat.	 And the reduction of this dislocation is that you place Mahassem's weak hand on a table and extend the hand of the assistant; and the physician shall place his palm over the prominence of the junction and push it until it returns.
Verumtamen oportet, ut consyderetur, si palma iam recessit ad uentrem manus: tunc ponat infirmus dorsum manus suae super tabulam apud extensionem et reductionem: et si dislocatio est procedens ad dorsum manus, tunc sit positio manus eius intrinsece super tabulam, id est, interior pars manus eius super tabulam ponatur, ut cadat manus medici super ipsam eminentiam iuncturae.	 However, it should be considered if the palm has already receded to the abdomen of the hand; then let the weak hand lie on a table during extension and reduction; and if the dislocation is proceeding towards the back of the hand, then its position should be inside the table, that is, the inner part of the hand should be placed on the table, so that the physician's hand falls upon the prominence of the junction.
Si ergo redit statim, bonum est: et si non, tunc stringe eam cum emplastro sedante apostema: et dimitte ipsum, neque iteres illud.	 If it returns immediately, that is good; and if not, then press it with an ointment sitting on a hot abscess, and leave it alone, do not repeat it.
Nam si non tolerat, neque potes super reductionem eius, postquam praetereunt ei dies, uerumtamen iunctura remanet secundum tortuositatem suam: et non nocet infirmo aliquid, nisi quod mollificatur manus, et non potest stringere aliquid: tunc scias, quod nerui sunt abscissi, aut attriti.	 For if it does not tolerate and you cannot perform the reduction of it after the days have passed, nevertheless the joint remains in its crooked state; and it does not harm the weak anything, except that the hand is softened and nothing can be pressed; then you will know that the nerves have been cut or rubbed.
Non est ergo ingenium in ea, nisi ut stringatur cum cauterio prope casum eius.	 The skill in it is only to tighten with a cautery near its failure.
Et fortasse non confert illud aliquid.	 And perhaps that brings nothing additional.
Cum ergo non redit Almahassem, tunc pone super ipsum emplastrum, quod narrauimus.	 Since Almahassem did not return, then place a plaster on top of him, as we have said.
Deinde stringatur, et dimittatur quinque diebus: postea soluatur et dimittatur, et exercitetur manus.	 Then it is tightened and released for five days; afterwards it is loosened and released, and exercise the hands.
Si autem priuatur motus eius, et accidat in ea aliquid grauitatis: tunc leni eam cum aqua calefacta, et fricatione aliquotiens, donec leniatur.	 If its movement is hindered, and something heavy happens to it; then soften it with warm water, and rub it occasionally until it becomes soft.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Digitorum.	 Chapter on the treatment of finger dislocations.
Caput XXX.	 Chapter XXX.
Quando dislocatur ex eis Digitus ad omnem partem, uel ex eis Digitus ad dorsum palmae, aut uentrem eius: tunc extende Digitum, et impelle dislocationem pollicibus tuis, donec redeat.	 When a finger is dislocated from any part, or a finger is dislocated to the back of the palm or its ventrum; then extend the finger and push the dislocation with your thumbs until it returns.
Deinde sustenta caput Digiti, et suspende ipsum uersus partem ad quam dislocatur, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	 Then hold the head of the finger, and suspend it turned towards the side to which it is dislocated, and release it for two days.
Deinde suspende eum, et extende ipsum, donec aequetur rectus in illo die suo.	 Then suspend it and extend it until it becomes straight on that day itself.
Cum ergo fuerit nox, liga ipsum secundum narrationem ipsam: et non cesses soluere ipsum in die: et exerce eum cum motu: et liga ipsum in nocte.	 When it is night, bind it according to the aforementioned description; and do not cease to release it during the day; and exercise it with movement; and bind it at night.
Fac illud diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	 Do that for some days until it tightens.
Et similiter fac cum eo, si dislocatur ad uentrem manus: et liga eum ad partem ipsam, et fac cum eo operationem tuam primam, donec sanetur.	 And similarly do the same if the dislocation is towards the palm of the hand; and bind it to that part itself, and perform your first operation on it until it heals.
Et similiter fac cum eo quando dislocatur ad reliquas partes.	 And similarly do the same when it is dislocated towards other parts.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Spondilium dorsi.	 Chapter on the treatment of spondylous dislocations of the back.
Caput XXXI.	 Chapter XXXI.
Quando accidit alicui Spondilium dorsi, aut colli dislocatio completa, aut remouentur Spondiles multae a locis suis: tunc non est in ea curatio, quoniam mors properat infirmo.	 When anyone has a spondylous dislocation of the back or a complete dislocation of the neck, or many spondyles are displaced from their places; then there is no cure for it, because death approaches the sick one.
Et signum illius est, quod egestio infirmi egreditur absque uoluntate, neque potest tenere eam: et multotiens mollificantur ex eo quaedam membra eius, aut duo crura eius, aut duo brachia ipsius, aut unum eorum: aut remouetur Spondilis una de loco suo.	 The sign of it is that the sickness of the person departs without will, and he cannot hold it; and many times some members of his are softened from it, or two legs of his, or two arms of himself, or one of them; or a vertebra is removed from its place.
Multotiens enim remouetur, quod multotiens fit remotio earum ad quatuor partes.	 Many times a removal occurs, which often happens in four parts.
Illa ergo quae remouetur ad posteriora, nominatur Gibbositas.	 Therefore, what is removed towards the backside is called Gibbositas.
Curatio uero eius est, ut consyderes tunc, si Gibbositas accidit a puericia: tunc non est in ea curatio, neque ex ea est sanatio omnino.	 The cure for it is to consider whether the Gibbositas occurs during childhood; then there is no treatment in it, nor healing at all from it.
In illa autem quae accidit a casu, aut percussione, aut similibus illis, iam dixerunt antiqui modos curationis sermone prolixo.	 However, the one that occurs by accident, or blow, or similar things, the ancient ones have already described the methods of treatment in a long discourse.
Cuius plurimum non redit cum proficuo.	 It is unlikely to return when it advances.
Ego uero iam abbreuiaui ex illo, cuius parum excusat a multo eius ex propinquitate mea ad intentionem: et expositione mea qua exposui illud, et formaui instrumentum eius diuerso modo ab eo quo ostenderunt illud, et exposuerunt ipsum.	 I have already departed from that which excuses itself little by its proximity to my intention; and in my exposition of it, I formed the tool for it differently than they showed it and explained it.
Dico ergo, quod in gibbositate quae accidit ab anteriori parte, non est ingenium, neque sanatio ex ea.	 Therefore, I say that there is no remedy, nor healing from the Gibbositas that occurs from the front side.
Et similiter in illa quae fit ad duo latera etiam.	 And similarly in the one that occurs on both sides.
Et non curatur ex eis, nisi illa quae accidit in dorso proprie, cum eo quod ego narro: et est, ut extendatur infirmus super faciem suam super podium aequale prope parietem: et expandatur sub eo stramentum humidum, ut non laedatur pectus eius.	 And it is not treated from them unless the one that occurs on the back properly, as I say; and it is to be done that the sick person extends his face on a flat surface, almost against the wall; and a wet blanket is spread under him so as not to hurt his chest.
Deinde ponatur lignum rectum fixum in fouea in terra, in extremitate podii, circiter caput eius: et lignum aliud circiter pedes eius in extremitate altera podii: et minister teneat lignum, et sit non firmatum in fouea.	 Then place a straight piece of wood fixed in the fireplace on the floor, at the end of the foot; and another piece of wood about his feet at the other end of the foot; and hold the man keep the wood, and it should not be fastened in the fireplace.
Et minister alter teneat alterum.	 One assistant holds the other.
Deinde inuolue super caput infirmi, et sub titillicis eius ligamentum lene, firmum: et extende extremitatem ligamenti ad lignum quod est apud caput eius: et liga ipsum in eo.	 Then, stretch over the head of the sick one, and bind a ligament gently but firmly beneath his chin; extend the end of the ligament to the wooden post that is beside his head; and tie it there.
Deinde stringe ligamentum aliud supra anchas eius, et supra genua ipsius, et apud cauillas eius.	 Then stretch another ligament over his ankles, and above his knees, and at the shackles of his legs.
Deinde aggrega ligamenta omnia, et liga ea in ligno altero quod est apud pedes eius.	 Then gather all the ligaments, and tie them to another wooden post that is by his feet.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem ligni ligamentum, et non remoueantur duo ligna ex locis suis in quibus sunt fixa: uerumtamen non sint firmata, sicut diximus.	 Then each assistant extends his ligament to the part of the wooden post, and let the two posts not be moved from their places where they are fixed; but they should not be made fast as we said.
Et medicus ponat palmas suas super Spondilem cum fortitudine, donec redeat: aut ponat super eam tabulam.	 And the physician places his hands on the patella (Spondyle) firmly until it returns; or he can place a board over it.
Deinde annectat super tabulam pedes suos, donec redeat.	 Then connect his feet to the board until it returns.
Si autem non redit per hanc curationem, tunc accipe tabulam cuius longitudo sit circiter tria brachia.	 If it does not return through this treatment, then take a board whose length is approximately three arms (about 4.8 feet or 1.5 meters).
Et caua in pariete de quo diximus quod est prope infirmum, locum in quem ingrediatur extremitas tabulae.	 And drive a hole in the wall as mentioned near the sick one, into which the end of the board enters.
Deinde pone medium tabulae super Spondilem.	 Then place the middle part of the board over the patella (Spondyle).
Et ponat pedes suos medicus super extremitatem alteram.	 And let the physician put his feet on the other end.
Et stringat bene, donec coartetur Spondilis, et redeat ad locum suum.	 And bind it well until the patella (Spondyle) is dislocated and returns to its place.
Deinde si uis, operare cum torno quod inuoluitur cum manu tua: et est, ut figas in terram apud caput infirmi in postremo podii duo ligna, quorum longitudo sit brachii unius: et apud caput eius in postremo podii duo ligna.	 Then, if you want, operate with a drill that is held by your hand; and it will be like driving two wooden posts into the ground at the head of the sick one on the last foot, whose length is an arm (about 1 cubit or 48 cm); and at his head on the last foot, two wooden posts.
Et sit longitudo quae est inter omne lignum palmus unus: et iam factum est in omni loco foramen, in quo currit tornum: et firmetur lignum omne in terra multum, ne moueatur omnino.	 And let the length between every post be a palm (about 9 cm); and it is now made that there is a hole where the drill runs through; and let every post be fixed firmly in the ground so that it does not move at all.
Et intromittatur lignum rotundum: et est tornum in quo reuoluitur ligamentum in duobus foraminibus duorum lignorum.	 And a round stick is introduced: and it is a probe in which the ligament revolves in the two holes of the two sticks.
Et in extremitate eius est foramen, in quo firmatur lignum, cuius longitudo est palmus cum eo quod reuoluitur: et in duobus lignis aliis est similiter illius.	 And at its end there is a hole, in which the stick is fixed, whose length is a palm with that which revolves; and similarly on the other two sticks.
Deinde stringe ligamenta quae strinxisti in pectore infirmi torno quod est apud caput eius: et ligamenta quae strinxisti in cruribus eius in torno quod est apud pedes eius.	 Then tie the ligaments which you have tied in the chest of the sick man to the probe that is at his head; and the ligaments which you have tied in his legs to the probe that is at his feet.
Deinde stet apud omne tornum minister, qui torqueat manum suam cum licinio, cum quo reuoluitur tornum: et medicus aequet Spondilem, secundum quod diximus.	 Then stand by each probe the servant who will twist his hand with the linen cloth, with which the probe revolves; and the doctor ties the Spondile, as we said before.
Haec est forma torni, quae sequitur.	 This is the form of the probe that follows.
Deinde postquam redit Spondilis, et aequatur locus, tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum exiccatiuum cum albumine oui.	 Then when the Spondile returns and the place is tied, then it is necessary that you put on an ointment of lime with egg white.
Deinde stuppam.	 Then apply a plaster (or lint).
Postea pone supra emplastrum astellam ex tabula, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, aut circiter eos.	 Then put on top of the ointment a star-shaped patch from wood, whose width is three fingers or around that.
Et longitudo eius quantitas quae capiat locum Gibbositatis, et super partem Spondilis sanae.	 And its length is the amount that covers the humpback (or protrusion), and above the healthy part of the Spondile.
Deinde ligetur cum ligamento quod diximus.	 Then it should be tied with the ligament that we said before.
Et utatur infirmus nutrimento subtili, donec sanetur.	 And the sick man shall take a subtle nourishment until he is healed.
Quod si remaneat quiddam eminentiae in loco in fine sanationis: tunc oportet, ut administrentur medicinae quae mollificant, et leniunt, cum administratione tabulae quam narrauimus tempore longo.	 If something remains as a protrusion in the place at the end of healing: then it is necessary to administer softening and soothing medicines along with the use of the tablet that we said before for a long time.
Et iam administratur in illo lamina plumbi.	 And now lead is applied on it (the Spondile).
Et quandoque accidit eminentia in postremo Spondilium dorsi: et putatur per eam dislocatio, et est illud os quod iam eminet.	 Sometimes a protrusion occurs at the last Spondyle of the back; and it is thought to be a dislocation, and that bone which is now projecting.
Quare non oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei cum hac medicina: fortasse enim accidere faciet mortem.	 It is not appropriate to presume [treatment] with this medicine, for perhaps it will cause death.
¶ De curatione Anchae dislocatae.	 Treatise on the Treatment of a Dislocated Shoulder.
Caput XXXII.	 Chapter XXXII.
Scias, quod iuncturae Anchae, et iuncturae humeri, non accidit, nisi dislocatio tantum: neque accidit eis quod accidit reliquis iuncturis ex remotione parua, et concauitate.	 Know that the joints of the ankle and shoulder do not occur except by dislocation; nor does what happens to the other joints happen to them through slight displacement and concavity.
Et iunctura quidem Anchae dislocatur secundum quatuor partes.	 Indeed, the joint of the ankle is dislocated in four parts.
Quod est, quia dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	 It is because it is dislocated to the front and back.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur ad interiora: et parum dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	 It is dislocated indeed more towards the inside; it is dislocated less to the front and back.
Et curatio dislocationis eius ad interiora, est: quia quando tu coniungis crus infirmi sanum cum infirmo, est longius: et est genu eius eminens plus quam sani, et non potest infirmus duplicare pedem suum apud inguen: et est locus qui sequitur inguen apostematus apostemate calido, propterea, quod caput coxae iam peruenit illic.	 The treatment of dislocation towards the inside is: because when you join the weak foot to a healthy one, it is longer; and the knee of the weak one protrudes more than that of the healthy one, and the weak one cannot double his own foot at the groin; and there is a place following the groin which is pressed with something hot, therefore because the head of the hip has already reached there.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad exteriora est, quod sunt accidentia eius contraria istis accidentibus.	 The sign of dislocation towards the outside is: that its symptoms are opposite to these symptoms.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad anteriora, est, quia expandit crus sanum secundum complementum: uerumtamen non duplicat ipsum absque dolore qui est in genu: et si conatur ad ambulandum, non potest super illud ad anteriora: et retinetur urina eius, et apostematur inguen eius, et apud ambulationem est calcatio eius super calcaneum.	 The sign of dislocation towards the front is: that it stretches the healthy leg too much; however, it does not double without pain in the knee; and if he tries to walk on it, he cannot do so over it at the front; and he retains his urine, and his groin is pressed, and during walking his heel is stepped on.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad posteriora est, ut non expandat genu, neque possit duplicare ipsum antequam duplicet inguen: et est crus eius etiam breuius altero: et inguen est mollificatum, et est caput coxae apud locum ilii.	 The sign of dislocation towards the back is: that it does not stretch the knee, nor can it double before the groin doubles; and his leg is even shorter than the other one; and his groin is softened, and the head of the hip is at its place.
Reductio uero huius dislocationis specierum est, ut consyderes tunc, si dislocatio est uetusta, quae iam antiquatur cum habente ipsam.	 The reduction of this dislocation however is: that you should consider then if the dislocation is old, which has already become chronic with the one having it.
Deinde si tu administres reductionem eius, et remanet secundum dispositionem suam: tunc non est in ea curatio omnino.	 Then if you administer the reduction of it and it remains according to its position; then there is no cure at all in that case.
Non ergo oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei penitus.	 Therefore, it is not appropriate to presume him completely.
In illo autem cuius dislocatio est recens, et est ex una specierum quatuor dislocationis: tunc propera ad hoc, ut uoluas iuncturam, et extendas ipsam ad interiora et ad exteriora, et moueas eam dextra et sinistra: fortasse enim redit, et non indiget alia cura.	 In the case of a recent dislocation, which belongs to one of the four types of dislocations: then proceed by pressing and stretching [the limb], moving it inward and outward, and shaking it left and right: perhaps it will return, and no further care is needed.
Si autem non redit hoc modo, tunc oportet, ut praepares ministrum fortem, et extendat crus eius ab inferiori parte: aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento, quod ligetur super crus eius supra genu: et minister alius extendat manum eius desuper, ita ut intromittat manus suas sub titillicis eius.	 If it does not return by this method, then prepare a strong assistant, and let him stretch the leg from below: either with his hands, or with a strap that is tied above the knee: and another assistant should extend the hand above, so that he introduces his hands under the joints.
Deinde stringat cum ligamento leni super radicem coxae, et teneat extremitatem ligamenti alterius.	 Then, bind gently with a strap over the root of the pelvis, and hold the end of the other strap.
Et sit extensio eius aut ab anteriori parte inguinis ad partem furculae, aut a posteriori ad partem dorsi.	 And the extension should be either from the front part of the groin to the neck region, or from the back to the back region.
Et sit extensio eorum omnium uice una, donec eleuetur infirmus cum corpore suo a terra, et remaneat pendens.	 The extension of all [limbs] should be uniform until the weak one is raised from the ground with his body and remains hanging.
Et haec enim species extensionis est species communis specierum quatuor.	 And this type of extension is a common type among the four types.
Si ergo redit dislocatio cum eo quod diximus, est bonum: et si non, tunc necesse est omni speciei illud quod dicam de curatione propria.	 If the dislocation returns with what I have said, it is good: and if not, then it is necessary for all types to apply what I will say about its treatment.
In reductione quidem eius propria quando dislocatio est ad interiora, oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super latus suum sanum.	 In the case of its own reduction when the dislocation is toward the inside, it is necessary for the weak person to lie on his healthy side.
Deinde ponat ligamentum super radicem coxae, in eo quod est inter caput coxae, et locum qui est sub inguine.	 Then, place a strap over the root of the pelvis, where it is between the head of the pelvis and the area under the groin.
Deinde extende ligamentum ad sursum a parte inguinis ad altiorem partem corporis, ad partem furculae.	 Then extend the strap upward from the groin to a higher part of the body, to the neck region.
Deinde accipiat minister alius fortis brachia eius, et minuat locum grossum coxae infirmae, et extendat ad exteriora extensione uehementi.	 Then receive another strong assistant with his arms, and reduce the swollen area of the weak pelvis, and stretch it outward by means of a strong extension.
Iam enim redit ad locum suum.	 Now, it returns to its own place.
Et haec species est facilioris reliquis speciebus curationis, qua reducitur hoc membrum.	 This is an easier kind of treatment among the rest, by which this limb is reduced.
Si autem excusatur super te, et non obedit tibi ad introitum cum hac specie curationis omnino: tunc oportet, ut ligentur duo pedes infirmi simul cum ligamento forti, leni, super duos calcaneos, et super duo genua: et sit longitudo cuiusque a compare suo quantitatis quatuor digitorum: et sit crus infirmum extensum plus altero quantitate duorum digitorum.	 If it is excised over you and does not obey you for this kind of treatment at all: then it is necessary that two weak feet are bound together with a strong ligament, gently, on the two heels, and on the two knees; and let the length of each be four digits' width apart from its root; and let the injured leg be extended by more than twice the width of two digits.
Deinde suspendatur infirmus super caput ligni, quod sit in domo: et sit longitudo eius a terra quantitas duorum brachiorum.	 Then the injured one is suspended above the head of a pole, which is in the house; and let its length from the ground be two forearms' width.
Deinde praecipe iuueni forti, ut muniat caput coxae: et suspendatur cum infirmo inuenis alius: et impellat iuuenis alius, muniens coxam cum fortitudine, nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	 Then command a strong youth to strap the head of the hip; and suspend it with the injured one, another youth will do so; and another youth will push, strapping the hip with force, for the joining returns to its own place quickly.
In reditione autem eius propria, quando est dislocatio ad exteriora, oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super podium, secundum quod narrauimus in habente gibbositatem.	 In its own reduction, when it is a dislocation towards the outside, it is necessary that the injured one lies on a stool, according to what we have said about having a hump.
Et stringatur ligamentum super crus eius, infirmum proprie, et super pectus eius.	 And bind a bandage around its leg, the injured one's own, and its chest.
Deinde ponantur duo ligna, unum apud pedes eius, et alterum apud caput ipsius.	 Then two poles are placed, one at his feet and another at his head.
Deinde ponatur lignum additum in medio podii, fixum bene: super quod inuoluti sint panni humidi, ut non laedat infirmum: et sit lignum inter coxas eius, ut non attrahatur ad inferiora apud extensionem.	 Then a pole is placed in the middle of the stool, firmly fixed; on which the injured ones are wrapped with wet cloths so as not to injure it; and let there be a pole between its hips, so that it is not pulled downwards during extension.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem suam, et medicus aequet reductionem manu sua.	 Then all attendants go to their respective parts, and the doctor equalizes the reduction with his hand.
Si ergo obedit ad reuersionem, erit bonum.	 If it therefore obeys for the reversal, it will be good.
Et si non, pone super ipsam tabulam, et preme ipsam, sicut diximus in gibbositate, aequaliter.	 And if not, place it on the table and press it equally, as we said in the case of a hump.
Verumtamen oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	 The sick person should lie on his healthy side.
Et quando dislocatio est ad anteriora, tunc oportet, ut extendatur crus infirmi uelociter: et est secundum hanc eandem narrationem super podium: et ponat medicus palmam manus suae dextrae super inguen infirmum.	 When there is a dislocation in front, then it is necessary to quickly extend the sick person's leg. And according to this same narrative on a bed, the doctor should place the palm of his right hand on the sick person's groin.
Deinde coartet ipsum cum manu altera, et cum illa coartatione pone ipsum extensum ad inferiora ad partem genu.	 Then bend him with your other hand, and with this bending, place him extended towards the lower parts at the knee joint.
Et si dislocatio est ad posteriora: tunc non oportet, ut extendatur infirmus ad inferiora, et sit eleuatus super terram: imo oportet, ut sit positus super rem duram, sicut oportet, ut fit etiam si dislocatur ancha eius ad exteriora, secundum illud quod diximus de accubitu eius super duas anchas: et est super faciem eius, et ligamenta extensa: secundum quod diximus nuper.	 If the dislocation is towards the back: then it is not necessary to extend the sick person towards the lower parts and lift him off the ground. Instead, he should be placed on a hard surface, as is also necessary if his hip joint is dislocated towards the outside, according to what we said about his lying on two hips: namely, on his face and with his legs extended: according to what we said recently.
Et oportet, ut administretur compressio cum tabula etiam super locum ad quem egreditur iunctura, cum completur reductio secundum quod oportet.	 It is necessary to apply compression with a board also at the place from which the joint departs, when reduction is completed as required.
Et signum reditionis eius non occultatur tibi: et est, ut extendas duo crura infirmi: et quando uides ea aequalia, et infirmus stringit crus suum, et expandit ipsum absque excusatione: tunc scias, quia iam redit membrum, secundum quod oportet: tunc coniunge duas coxas, et pone emplastrum, et stringe cum imemati, id est, rota: ita, ut non moueatur ancha ad aliquam partium: et adhaereat infirmus quieti tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	 And the sign of its reduction is not hidden from you: and it is to extend the two legs of the sick person: and when you see them level, and the sick person tightens his leg, and expands himself without support: then you will know that the limb has returned, as required: then join the hip bones, and apply a plaster, and tighten with bandages, that is, a roller: thus, so that the hip joint is not moved to any part: and let the sick person rest quietly for three or four days.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et emplastrum, et compara crus cum altero: tunc si uides ea aequalia in statu, tunc scias, quod dislocatio iam firmata est: absolue ergo infirmum ad ambulandum.	 Then loosen the ligament, remove the plaster, and compare the leg with the other: then if you see them level in position: then you will know that the dislocation is already fixed: so release the sick person to walk.
Et si uides aliquid mollificationis: tunc redi, et emplastra illud, et stringe illud secundum stricturam tuam primam: et dimitte illud etiam tribus diebus.	 And if you see something softening: then return, and apply a plaster, and bind it according to your first binding: and leave it for three days.
Deinde solue illud et fac ipsum tardare in ambulatione super utrumque aliquot diebus, donec confortetur bene.	 Then loosen that [part] and make it slow in walking on either side for several days, until it recovers well.
¶ De dislocationis Genu.	 Chapter on Dislocations of the Knee.
Caput XXXIII.	 Chapter 33.
Genu dislocatur secundum tres modos.	 The knee is dislocated in three ways.
Dislocatur ad exteriora, ad interiora, et ad inferiora, scilicet ad posteriora.	 It [the knee] is dislocated externally, internally, and downwards (backward).
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora.	 And it is not dislocated anteriorly.
Et signum dislocationis eius, est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut applicet crus suum ad coxam suam.	 The sign of its [the knee's] dislocation is that you instruct the weak to apply their leg to their hip.
Si autem non adhaeret cum coxa: tunc scias, quod Genu est dislocatum.	 If it does not stick with the hip: then know, that the knee is dislocated.
Et restauratio omnium modorum dislocationis eius est, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum, ita ut iam extendat crus suum si potest super illud, et adhaeret dorsum tuum ad faciem eius: et pone pedem eius inter pedes tuos.	 And the restoration of all the ways of its [the knee's] dislocation is that you make the weak sit upright, so that he can now extend his leg over it and let his back touch his face; and put his foot between your feet.
Deinde adhaerere fac Genu eius cum palmis tuis, et recta eas inter digitos tuos super Genu eius.	 Then make the [knee's] bones adhere with your hands, and place them straight across the [knee] between your fingers.
Deinde applica cum palma tua duo latera Genu eius cum fortitudine.	 Then apply both sides of the knee with the palm of your hand firmly.
Et minister alius extendat pedem eius, donec redeat Genu ad locum suum.	 And another servant extends his [the patient's] foot until the knee returns to its place.
Et signum reditionis est, ut adhaereat crus cum coxa in lenitate, non laboriose.	 The sign of its return is that the leg sticks with the hip gently, not forcefully.
Deinde emplastra ipsum, et adhaerere fac crus cum coxa.	 Then bandage [the knee] and let the leg stick with the hip.
Deinde liga ea simul cum uitta tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	 Then bind it together with a plaster for three or four days.
Deinde solue ea.	 Then loosen it.
Et non utatur infirmus ambulatione aliquot diebus, donec sanetur.	 And the weak one should not walk for some days until he is healed.
Si autem recusatur tibi reductio eius, tunc administra extensionem fortem cum ligamentis, quorum praecessit narratio in curatione anchae, donec redeat.	 If [the knee] refuses to return, then administer a powerful extension with ligaments, the treatment of which has been described earlier for an ankle, until it returns.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Calcanei.	 Chapter on the Treatment of Ankle Dislocation.
Caput XXXIIII.	 Head, Chapter XXXIIII.
Calcaneus quandoque remouetur remotione parua, et quandoque dislocatur secundum complementum.	 Heel is sometimes moved with slight removal, and at other times dislocated according to its full extent.
Et dislocatio eius fit, aut ad interiora, aut ad exteriora.	 Its dislocation is either internal or external.
Et signum dislocationis eius est, quod uides Calcaneum inflatum, procedentem ad partem ad quam dislocatur.	 The sign of its dislocation is that you see the heel swollen, projecting towards the part to which it has been dislocated.
Curatio autem remotionis eius, est facilis reditionis: et est, ut extendatur cum facilitate cum manibus, et aequetur, donec redeat.	 The treatment of its removal is easy; it consists in bringing it back easily with the hands and equalizing it until it returns to its place.
In curatione autem eius quando dislocatur secundum complementum, oportet, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum: et teneat ipsum minister fortis ualde a posteriori parte dorsi eius, in medio ipsius.	 In its dislocation according to its full extent, it is necessary that you make the patient sit upright; and let a strong attendant hold him from behind the middle of his back.
Deinde tene tu cum manu tua dextra pedem eius a superiori parte eius, et cum manu tua sinistra ab inferiori parte pedis eius loco cauillae.	 Then you hold his foot with your right hand from above and your left hand below the foot of him in the position of the ankle joint.
Deinde trahe pedem ad tecum manu tua dextra.	 Then, pull the foot towards you with your right hand.
Deinde cum sinistra duabus uicibus.	 With your left hand press it (the dislocated heel) in two places.
Deinde extende cum sinistra, et impelle pectus pedis cum dextra uersus crus absque labore.	 Then stretch it (the foot) with the left and push the front of the foot (ankle) towards the back with the right hand without effort.
Fac illud bis, sicut narrauimus.	 Do this twice as we have said.
Deinde impelle pectus pedis ad crus in uice tertia, et tu trahis cauillam.	 Then push the front of the foot (ankle) towards the back for the third time and you pull the ankle joint.
Si ergo redit in uice una, aut in duabus secundum hunc modum, et uides pedem aequatum, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera operationem super ipsum: quoniam ipse redit.	 If it returns to its place once or twice according to this method, and you see the foot straightened, that is good; if not, then repeat the operation on him, because he will return to his place.
Si autem prohibetur tibi reductio eius cum eo quod narrauimus: tunc fac iacere infirmum super dorsum suum super terram, et fige paxillum in terra firmatum ualde, ut cadat inter coxas eius: et tu iam inuoluisti super ipsum pannum, ut non laedat infirmum.	 If the reduction of it (the dislocated heel) is prevented for you with him as we have said, then make the patient lie on his back on the ground and set a pillow firmly fixed in the ground so that he falls between his hips; and you should already have wrapped him in cloth so that he does not injure himself.
Deinde accipiat minister coxam eius: postea extendat minister alter pedem, aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento quod liget super collum pedis.	 Then let the attendant take hold of his thigh: afterwards, let another attendant extend the other leg, either with his hands or with a strap that ties around the neck of the foot.
Deinde extendat omnis minister contra extensionem comparis sui: et paxillus sit stans inter duas coxas infirmi retinens eum, ut non attrahatur corpus eius ad inferiora apud extensionem.	 Let every attendant extend himself opposite the stretching of his companion: and let the footstool be standing between the two thighs of the weak one, holding him so that his body is not drawn towards the lower parts during the stretching.
Deinde aequet medicus dislocationem manibus suis, et minister alter teneat crus sanum ad inferiora.	 Then let the physician adjust [the dislocated part] with his hands, and another attendant hold the sound leg towards the lower parts.
Nam dislocatio redit cum uelocitate.	 For a dislocation returns swiftly.
Quando ergo redit dislocatio, et declaratur tibi sanitas reditionis eius: tunc pone emplastrum et stuppam, et stringe ipsam cum ligamentis firmiter, et liga pedem cum ligamento ad crus.	 When the dislocation returns and the health of its return is made known to you: then apply plaster and pitch, and bind it firmly with bandages, and tie the foot with a strap to the sound leg.
Et oportet, ut caueas uel timeas de neruis, qui sunt supra calcaneum posterius, ut non sit ligamentum super eos uehemens, et laedat eos.	 And it is necessary that you be careful or afraid of the nerves which are above the heel at the back, so that the bandage is not too tight and injures them.
Deinde dimitte ipsum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	 Then dismiss him for two or three days.
Quod si mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum: deinde solue ipsum in die tertio, aut quarto: et prohibe infirmum ab ambulatione quadraginta diebus.	 If the bandage softens, bind it again; then unbind him on the third or fourth day; and forbid the weak one from walking for forty days.
Si uero conatur ambulare ante illud spacium, non fit securitas quin dissoluatur super ipsum dislocatio, et corrumpatur, et non recipiat post illud curationem.	 But if he attempts to walk before that period, there will be no assurance that the dislocation will not recur, and it will be damaged, and will not receive healing after that.
Quod si accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc oportet, ut administres in sedatione eius illud, in quo praecessit narratio nostra in alio loco ex curatione, et embrocationem, donec remoueatur.	 If he has a hot abscess: then it is necessary that you administer to its sedation the remedy which was previously mentioned in another place in the cure, and embrocation until it is removed.
¶ De dislocatione Digitorum pedis, et cura.	 [Section on] Dislocation of Fingers of the Foot and Cure.
Caput XXXV.	 Chapter XXXV.
Oportet, ut aequetur quod dislocatur ex eis cum extensione pauca absque labore: et illud quidem non est difficile, imo est facile.	 It is necessary that it be adjusted which has been dislocated with little extension without effort; and this indeed is not difficult, but rather easy.
Si autem dislocatio est in quibusdam nodis dorsi pedis: tunc oportet, ut faciat sedere infirmus pedem suum super locum aequalem terrae, aut super tabulam: et est stans sicut ambulans.	 If the dislocation is in certain nodes of the foot's back: then it is necessary that he makes his foot sit on an equal place with the ground, or on a table: and he stands as if walking.
Deinde tu sta, et pone pedem tuum super illud quod eminet ex illis iuncturis.	 Then you stand and put your foot over that which rises from those joints.
Deinde calca illud cum pede tuo cum uirtute, donec redeat, et uideas ipsum iam aequatum, et non appareat in loco eminentia.	 Then press it with your foot until it comes back, and you see that it is equal, and no longer appears to protrude from its place.
Deinde pone sub uentre pedis eius tabulam quae capiat pedem totum, cui sint duo capita.	 Then put a board under the foot's belly which can hold the entire foot, having two legs.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti tribus diebus.	 Then bind it with a suitable bandage for three days.
Deinde solue ipsum, et fac quiescere eum ab ambulatione diebus multis, donec stringatur et securetur a reductione.	 Then unbind it and let him rest from walking for many days, until it is bound and secured against relapse.
¶ De speciebus dislocationis cum uulnere uel fractura.	 Chapter on the types of dislocations with wound or fracture.
Caput XXXVI.	 Chapter 36.
Quando accidit aliquid ex illo, et conaris curationem eius, et ipsius restaurationem, multotiens succedit mors: et propter illud non oportet, ut praesumat super curationem eius, quod est huiusmodi, nisi qui est prudens in arte longi usus, misericors, pius, tardus, non audax, neque praesumptuosus: et ut utatur in incaeptionce medicinis quae sedant apostemata calida tantum: et dimittat infirmum diuino iudicio.	 When something happens to it, and you attempt its cure and restoration, death often occurs multiple times; therefore, one should not presume to treat this type of condition without being wise in the art of long practice, merciful, pious, patient, cautious, not presumptuous, and using only cold medicines at first: and let the sick man be left to divine judgment.
Nisi uideas, aut speras salutem a perditione cum lenitate aegritudinis, et in quo apparet quiddam spei.	 Unless you see or hope for salvation from impending destruction with the softening of the sickness, and where something appears to indicate hope.
Conare ergo reductionem eius statim in principio rei, antequam accidat apostema calidum.	 Try its reduction immediately at the beginning, before a hot abscess occurs.
Si ergo redit membrum, secundum quod uolumus, tunc administra regimen quod sedat apostema: et cura uulnus cum eo quod conuenit ei ex unguentis desiccatiuis.	 If the limb then returns as we desire, then administer a regime that checks an abscess; and heal the wound with that which is suitable for it from dry ointments.
Quod si dislocatio est cum fractura, et accidunt in osse satagiae separatae, tunc conare ablationem earum, et fac in illo quod diximus in aegritudinibus simplicibus ex eo quod praecessit in locis earum.	 If the dislocation is with a fracture and there are separated splinters in the bone of the shaft, then try to remove them, and make in that which was said for simple diseases from the place where they preceded.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, et custodi teipsum ab introitu in uiam timoris: secundum quod praecessit praedicatio mea tibi.	 And be careful according to your virtue, and guard yourself from entering the path of fear: according to what my prediction preceded for you.
Nam illud est melius tibi apud Creatorem tuum, et magis permanens ad gloriam tuam, et magis saluum tuo corpori apud illos in tuo tempore.	 That is better for you with your Creator, and more permanent to your glory, and more safe for your body among them at your time.
