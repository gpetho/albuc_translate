to cut the frenulum of the tongue
Sometimes this frenulum that comes from under the tongue is either natural, that one is born with it; or by accident from a healed wound; and the procedure is such that you open the patient's mouth, and have their head in your lap, and lift the tongue; then cut the sinewy frenulum widely, so that the tongue is freed from its attachment, and if there is hardness or a knot, and it is from the healing of a wound, put the hook there and cut that ligament widely; and be careful that the incision is not too deep, because of the artery that is underneath; and when you have done this, wash the area with rose water and vinegar, or with cold water, then put a linen tent under the tongue; and let the patient hold it there every night, so that the area cannot heal closed.
And if bleeding occurs, apply ground vitriol to the area; and if the blood overcomes you, cauterize it with a lentil-shaped cautery, which is good for this; then treat it with other treatments until it is healed.
