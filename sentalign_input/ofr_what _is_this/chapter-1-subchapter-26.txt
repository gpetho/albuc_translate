After this, make three cauteries: one below the hollow of the chest by the width of a finger, with the whole cautery instrument; and two cauteries outside on both sides, so that the shape of the cauteries forms a triangle, and there is such a space between one and the other that they are not joined together when they discharge pus; and let the cauteries be so deep that they reach two parts of the heart, and the shape of the cauteries be according to this form without addition:
And if you wish to cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this shape; and for he who is afraid of this cautery, cauterize by pricking and mark a point on the stomach according to the amount of ink you wish; then cauterize it with the whole cautery which is called "pointed".
After the treatment of the ailment that we discussed before, until he is healed.
