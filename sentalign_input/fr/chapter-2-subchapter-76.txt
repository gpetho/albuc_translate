Of the dead child
When you treat a woman for a dead child in her womb, as I said in the division, and it does not come out, and you are constrained to manual work;
then you must know if the woman has sound strength, and has no condition or fear of death;
then the woman must be supported on her back, with her head inclined downward, and her legs raised;
and the assistant holds her on both sides, or she is tied to the bed so she is not pulled during the descent of the child;
then rub the opening of the uterus with moist oils mixed with marshmallow mucilage, fenugreek, and linseed, then the midwife anoints her hands with these oils and mucilages;
then she gently places them in the uterus, then finds a place where she puts the hooks that are suitable for this,
and take care if the child is positioned to descend head first;
then fix the hooks in its eyes or in its neck or in its mouth or in its palate or under the chin or in the armpit or near the ribs,
and if the descent is feet first, fix them in the wrist and the sides;
and he must hold the hook in his right hand, and place the curve between the fingers of his left hand, and gently put his whole hand in, and fix the hook in any of these places that we have mentioned, until it reaches the empty space;
and this is the form of the hook:
then fix another hook against it, or a third if necessary, so that the extraction is even;
and then extend it evenly by moving from one side to the other, to make it come out, and the hooks should be toothed to hold better, as here is the form:
And if a part remains, the midwife anoints some of her fingers with oil, and places them in that part, and pulls out the other part;
and if any remains, put the hook in a higher place, and do this until it is all out.
And if one hand comes before the other, and it cannot be brought back because of the tightness,
then you must wrap it in a cloth, until it is all out;
then cut it at the joint of the limb or at the elbow, and you must do the same with the other hand, and the two feet.
And if the child's head is large and the exit is narrow, or there is fluid collected in the head,
then you must put the spiked spatula between your fingers, and split the head and extract the fluid;
or break it with the instrument called "almidach", the form of which is given with the instruments in the chapter after this one;
and do the same if the child has a naturally large head;
and then pull out the bones with tongs,
and if the head comes out and it is stuck at the collarbone, split it, so that the fluid in the chest comes out;
and if it cannot come out, cut it into pieces as much as you can;
and if it is swollen in the belly or under the ribs, you must pierce it until the fluid runs out.
And if the child is feet first, the extraction is easier, and the adjustment to the mouth of the uterus is easy.
And if it is narrow in the belly or the chest, you must extract it with a cloth wrapped around your hand;
and split the belly or the chest, until the fluid runs out;
and if the other limbs are removed, and the head remains,
the midwife places her hand deep in the uterus, and pulls it to the mouth of the uterus;
then places one or two hooks, and pulls it out;
and if the mouth of the uterus is narrowed by a hot abscess that has formed there, then do not try to work,
but administer moist and greasy things;
and administer plasters, and seat her in softening and moistening water.
And if the child is on its side, and you can align it, then administer what we have said for the live child;
and if it cannot be done, pull it out in pieces, and leave nothing of the afterbirth.
And when you have done this, administer what we have said for hot abscesses that form in the uterus;
and if a flow of blood occurs, put her in restraining water, and administer other treatments.
And I saw a woman in whose womb a child had died, then another was conceived over it, and the other also died.
After a long time, an abscess formed in the belly, and it swelled until it opened, and began to greatly fester.
I was called to treat it, and I thought a long time, and the wound could not heal.
I applied a strong drawing plaster, and a bone came out, and after a few days, another.
I was very surprised, because there are no bones in the belly.
So I thought these were the bones of a dead child.
I cleaned the wound, and extracted many bones, until the woman was in better condition;
and the woman lived a long time this way, and a little pus always came out from the place;
and I have recorded this chapter only because, when the master finds a strange thing, he should know how to treat it.
