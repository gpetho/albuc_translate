of the torture of the mouth
Torture that must be treated by cautery is excluded except for those that arise from phlegm, as we have said in the divisions of illnesses;
and do not cauterize similar conditions that come from dryness and nerve spasms.
When you treat this type of torture that arises from phlegm with hydragogues and purges of the head and gargles, and this is not effective, then you must cauterize the patient with three cauteries:
one at the root of the ear, and another a little outside the temple, and the third at the joining of the two lips;
and place the cautery on the part that appears healthy, and make a cautery near the top of the ear, a little below the crown of the head, and another on the temple about a thumb's length long;
and leave the cautery in place until half of the core is burned;
and this is the shape of the cautery:
And it is similar to the lancet that we have shown before, but it is a little more subtle, and the blade should be a little thicker;
afterwards treat the area as I have said before, until it is healed.
