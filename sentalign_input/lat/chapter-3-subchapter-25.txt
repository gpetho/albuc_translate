On the reduction of the dislocation of the clavicle and shoulder joint.
Chapter 26.
The clavicle does not typically dislocate inward due to its connection with the chest.
Occasionally, it dislocates outward, which is evident to the touch.
To restore it, have the patient lie on their back and extend their arms.
Then press the area with your palm firmly, which should reposition it.
Afterward, apply a plaster and cloth pads, and secure it.
The ends of the bones extending toward the elbow, connected to it, rarely dislocate.
But if it is dislocated on any day, then it should be reduced and aligned as we have said, and what is prepared for you.
Then place a plaster over it, along with cushions and a bandage.
And instruct the patient to adhere to calm and rest until healed.
And with this same treatment, the shoulder extremity is reduced when it is also separated from its place.
