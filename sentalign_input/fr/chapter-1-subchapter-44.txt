of joint pain
When joint pain is from moisture that is spread to each part of the body, and when pain comes to the feet, which doctors properly call "podagra", and when it is from a cold cause and medical treatments cannot cure it, it is cured by cautery in this manner: make many cauteries around the joint of the foot, and let the cautery be olive-shaped in this shape:
And if it is necessary to prick the face of the foot, make a cautery with the cautery called "point". And if the pains come to the knees and other joints, which happens many times, make cautery on each knee with three or four cauteries on each part, with the olive-shaped cautery; and if you need more, make more, but do not leave your hand there longer than necessary to burn the thickness of the core.
And if the pains descend to the knees and the back, administer the cautery we mentioned in its chapter. And if the pains are in the hands, make pricks around the joint in two lines; and if there is still pain in the fingers, make pricks on each joint and on the back of the hand; and if the pains come to the elbows or shoulders, cauterize each part, and govern the patient well and give medicines. For if you govern well and purge phlegm, the patient will be healed with God's help.
