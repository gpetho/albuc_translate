Of the fracture of the bones of the foot.	On fracture of bones of the foot and of the toes.	0.7751585
At the ankle, there is no fracture, but in the bones of the foot there is sometimes a fracture, and rarely in the toes, and there is only shattering in most cases.	The heel is never fractured; but the bones of the foot sometimes are. The toes too are rarely fractured; but mostly they get crushed.	0.82285273
And if a fracture occurs in the bones of the foot, and you see these bones overlapping each other, have the patient place his foot on the ground, as if he wanted to walk, and then immediately place your foot on his, where the bones are raised, then press until they return to their place; then apply the plaster and padding on top, and place a small board with two flat ends under the arch of the foot, then bind it to the foot tightly, after you have wrapped cloths around it, and other things you need.	If a fracture occurs to the bones of the foot, and you see the bones riding over one another, let the patient plant his foot flat on the ground as if walking. Then stand and put the sole of your foot on the prominent bones and with your foot put pressure upon them and level them to their proper place. Then apply a bandage and some tow on top, and put under the inner part of the sole of the foot a small board with two flat heads. After you have wrapped them in material and so on, bind them tightly to the sole of the foot.	0.9152643
And when three or four days have passed, untie the bandage, for you will find the bones even, whether broken or dislocated.	When three days or four have passed, loosen the binding and you will find the bones in position; whether they have been fractured or dislocated, the operation is (the same,) as you see.	0.8417113
And if any of the toes are broken, restore them as we have described for the fingers; then place a splint on the broken toe, along the length of the toe, and a little wider, then place the board that I mentioned under the foot, and bind it tightly; and if there are two or three, or more, broken, place a splint on each toe according to its size, wrapped in a linen cloth, and tighten the board under the foot; and the end of the board should extend past the arch of the foot, so that it holds it well.	If one of the toes be broken, reposition and straighten it in the way that I described for the fingers; then apply to the broken toe a splint of a length corresponding to the toe and a little wider than it. Then under the sole of the foot put the board that I have just described, and bandage it on firmly. If the broken bones number two, three, or more, then apply over each toe a single splint measured to it, wrapped in soft material, and bind the board on the sole and let the flat portion of each of the two heads extend beyond the end of the sole of the foot, so that it may be held firmly.	0.94215256
And you must not forget the other things that I have said about other fractures, as we have explained; and treat each injury as appropriate.	And you must not forget to pay attention to all those contingencies that we have mentioned to you in other fractures; meet each contingency with the means proper to it.	0.8342255
