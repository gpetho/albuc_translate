Chapter Thirteen:
On the Cauterization of Chronic Tearing.
When chronic tearing of the eyes is due to manifest veins and arteries on the exterior of the head, indicating cold phlegmatic excesses, cauterize the patient with the same cautery mentioned for the onset of water falling into the eyes, and a cautery in the middle of the head, and two cauteries on the neck below the two temples, and two cauteries on the neck below the two bones.
If additional cautery is needed, cauterize on each side of the eyeâ€™s tail at the end of the eyebrow with a small cautery.
