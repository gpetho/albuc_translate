The treatment of tremors/shaking/shivering/palpitations (depending on context. Could also be "trembling sickness" like Parkinson's disease, etc.  More context would be needed)
When someone trembles from coldness of the nerves, or from quartan fever or other, then you must make four cauteries or four on the spine of the back, one cautery between each vertebra; and one cautery on the feet, and one on the stomach with olive cautery; thus the trembling will cease, and the health of the cold illness will hasten.
