O, son, since I have completed for you this book, which is the summit of the science of medicine, for its completion, its consequences, its exposition, and its clarifications, it seems to me that I should fulfill my obligation to you with this treatise, which is a part of the practice with the hand, that is, surgery.
Because the practice with the hand is almost entirely lost in our region and our time, to the point that its science is greatly diminished, and its vestiges are obscured; and nothing remains of it but some small descriptions in the books of the Ancients, which are mostly altered, leading to errors and hesitation, so that their intentions are unclear and their strength and art are weakened.
And it seems to me that I should revive it by ordering this treatise according to a method of exposition, clarification, and abbreviation; and so that it may include the forms of cautery instruments and other surgical instruments, both by adding descriptions and by preparing them, which is necessary.
But the reason why a skillful artisan with his hands is not found in our time is that the art of medicine is extensive, and its practitioner must first be trained in the science of anatomy, which is lacking in Gaul, so that he knows the functions of the members and their forms, and their connections and separations; and has knowledge of the bones, nerves, and muscles, and their number and arrangement; and of the pulsating and quiet veins, and the places of their origin.
And for this reason Hippocrates says that in name it is much, but in practice little, and especially in the art of the hand.
But we have already spoken of this in the introduction to this book; for whoever is not knowledgeable in what we have said about anatomy is surely liable to fall into error, by which men will be killed, as I have seen many examples, for some are trained in this science and then practice it without knowledge and experience.
For I saw a foolish and inexperienced physician incise a scrofulous abscess in the neck of a woman, and he cut some arteries of the neck, so that a great deal of blood flowed until the woman died in his hands.
And I saw another physician who undertook to remove a stone from a man who had grown old, and the stone was large, and he came to him and extracted that stone along with a piece of the bladder, so that that man died on the third day.
And I was called to extract it, and I saw that because of the size of the stone and the condition of the patient, I knew that he would die.
And I saw another physician who received a stipend from a duke of our land for surgery, and a black eunuch came to him who had a fracture in his thigh; and the physician, through his ignorance, pulled the fractured bones apart, over the wound, with cushions and splints with tight binding, and did not allow the wound to breathe.
And then he loosened it according to his wishes, and then he bound it again, and then he left it for some days and commanded that we not loosen the binding; and it remained so until the thigh and foot became abscessed, and it came to ruin.
And I was called to him, and I prepared to unbind the ligature, and tranquility was achieved and thus a lessening of his pain.
But however, corruption was already confirmed in the limb, so that I could not restrain it, and the corruption did not cease to spread in the limb until the patient perished.
And I saw another physician who punctured a cancerous abscess, and it was ulcerated for some days, until its malignancy was magnified with its lord (or master/owner).
The reason is that a cancerous sore is full of melancholic humor; therefore, it should not be approached with iron at all, but it should be in a limb which suffers so that it is completely contained.
And therefore, sons, it is necessary for you that the operation with the hand be divided into two divisions: that is, in an operation which is associated with health, and in a work with which there is peril in the greatest dispositions (or conditions).
And I have already explained this throughout this book, in which operations come which contain error and fear; therefore, it is necessary for you that you guard against this and avoid that, so that fools do not find a way to speak and dishonor you.
Therefore, take up your instruments with diligence and with God's protection, and treat your patients with happiness and firmness.
And use the best method, by the grace of God, leading to health and laudable success, and leave the terrible illnesses of difficult healing, and keep your instruments away from that which makes you fear, so that hesitation in your faith and in your name does not escape you: for it remains more to your glory, and higher in the world and behind your holiness.
Galen already said in some of his admonitions: Do not treat a bad illness, lest you be called bad physicians".
And I have divided this book according to three chapters.
Begins the division of the book, and first of the first part. The first chapter ordered from head to foot, on the forms of the instruments and the tools of cauteries, and on what is necessary in the operation.
The division of the second part. The second chapter, of suction and perforation, and of cupping glasses, and of wounds, and of the extraction of arrows and similar things, all chaptered and ordered according to the forms of the instruments.
The third chapter, of restoration and dislocation, and of the treatment of sprains and similar things; a chapter ordered from head to foot, and of the forms of the instruments.
It is necessary that I should say the quality of the benefits of that cautery and its harms, and in what complexion cautery is prohibited.
Therefore I say that the discourse on the quality of the benefit of cautery and its harm is a long and prolix discourse, and subtle in science, and a hidden secret; and many wise men have already spoken of it, and they have disagreed about it, and a little of their discourses suffices me, fearing prolixity.
And therefore I say that cautery benefits all complexions universally, which are with matter or without matter, except two complexions, which are hot complexions without matter.
In the hot and dry complexion with matter there is disagreement; for some say that cautery is beneficial to it, and others say the contrary, that cautery is not suitable in a disease which is caused by heat and dryness, because the nature of fire is heat and dryness, and it is unsuitable that a hot and dry disease should be healed by that which is hot and dry.
And I answer him who says the contrary, that benefit is done by cautery in every hot and dry disease that comes in the bodies of men, for when you compare the body of man and its humors to the complexion of fire, you find the body of man cold.
And I say, concerning his discourse, that experience has revealed this to me several times.
However, it is not fitting that this should come upon one who is already experienced and exercised in the chapter on cautery by previous practice, and who has known the diversity of the complexions of men and the disposition of the diseases in themselves, and the causes of them, and their accidents, and the duration of those diseases.
But in the other complexions, there is no fear for you, and especially in the cold and moist diseases, for all physicians are agreed upon those, and they are not in disagreement about the benefit with cautery in those.
And know, sons, that the secret of healing by cautery with fire, and its goodness, is superior to cautery with a burning medicine, because fire is simple, whose action does not reach except the member which is cauterized, and does not harm another member adjoining it, except with little harm.
But the action of burning medicine reaches to those members which are distant from it, and quickly brings to the member a disease of difficult healing and quickly kills.
But fire, by its sublimity and the goodness of its substance, does not do this, except that it surpasses. And it is already known to us by experiment and by the length of service of study with the art concerning the truth of the causes; and for that reason I am excused from the length of speech. And if it were not that it is not written in my book at this point a secret hidden with fire, and the quality of its operation in bodies and its expulsion by which it expels diseases, with philosophical demonstrative speech, which would be acute in your thoughts.
And know, sons, that they disagree on the time in which it is convenient to perform cautery, and they place the best time in springtime.
And I say that cautery is convenient at all times, so that the harm due to accidental time is submerged in the benefit of that which is achieved with cautery, and especially if the cautery is for pains or necessary pains, strong and urgent, which do not suffer delay because it is feared that those evils may come, which are greater than the small harm caused by time.
And this does not enter your minds, oh sons, this is not esteemed except by the vulgar people and foolish physicians, that is, that for that illness which is healed by cautery there is no remission at any time, and they place that as a consequence.
And the cause is not at all as they believe, for cautery is only in place of medicine which alters the complexion and dries the humors which are the cause of the pains.
However, cautery is superfluous over medicine because of the quickness of its efficacy and the power of its operation and the greatness of its lord.
And it is possible that his illness may return at some time, according to the complexion of the patient and the location of his illness, and his strength, and that which is prepared in his body from the aggregation of superfluities in him, and that which has reached him in its acquisition in food and similar causes; except that the illness in which cautery is administered is a subtle illness in a member with few superfluities and humors, such as cautery of a tooth for pain and similar to that, it is possible that that pain may not return to him, but this happens in small things.
And a more common saying is that cautery is the last resort of medicine, and it is a true saying, not to that which they understand by it, for they believe that there is no cure that profits with medicine or with any other thing besides cautery.
And the cause is contrary to that; and the intention that cautery is the last resort of medicine is only when we administer the methods of cure in some illnesses, and those medicines do not help, and then at the end of the cause one administers cautery, and it profits for that. And therefore from here it is seen that cautery is the last resort of medicine, not according to the intention which the common people and too many foolish doctors understand.
And the ancients said that cautery with gold is better than cautery with iron, and they did not say this except for the evenness of gold and the sublimity of its substance.
And they said that the place of cautery does not burn, as if that were not absolutely true, because I have already proven this and found that it does not do so except in some bodies without others, and cautery with this is good and better than with iron as they said; however, when you do cautery with fire with gold, it is not apparent to you, because it is ignited according to the quantity you desire by the roughness of the gold, and because it prepares to receive cold; and if you apply fire to it, the gold melts from the fire, and sometimes some sheets in the fire so that the artisan is busy with that.
And therefore cautery with iron is done more easily and more appropriately for the correctness of the operation.
And I have already ordered this chapter on cautery according to chapters, and I have ordered those from the head to the feet, so that I might offer to the enquirer what he wants from it.
The first chapter.
This cauterization counteracts the humidity and coldness affecting the brain; the accident of which has two causes: that is, the cause of excessive and abundant rheumy flux, called coryza, flowing from the head to the parts of the eyes and ears, and excessive sleepiness, and toothache and sore throat, and universally of every illness that comes from coldness, such as paralysis, sopor, and apoplexy, and similar illnesses.
The form of this cauterization is this: first, order the patient to be evacuated with a purgative medicine, cleansing the head, for three or four nights, according to the strength of the patient, his age, and his constitution.
And then order him to shave his head with a razor, and then place him sitting between your hands on a low bench and have him place his hands on his feet.
And then place the root of your palm near the bridge of his nose, between his eyes. However, when your middle finger has reached that spot, mark that spot with a probe, and then ignite the olive-shaped cautery, of which this is the form:
And then place that [cautery] on the spot marked with the probe, in such a way that it descends, with which your hand should be constrained little by little, and you rotate it.
And then lift your hand slightly and observe the area, and if you see some quantity of the head of the bone uncovered, like the quantity of a grain of barley, then lift your hand, and if not, return your hand with that iron, with another of that kind if it is cooled, until that which I have told you is seen of the bone.
And then take a little salt and dissolve it on the area and leave it for three days.
And then place on it cotton soaked in wine and leave it there until the burn scar is destroyed. And then treat the area with tetrafarmacon ointment until it is healed.
And it has been said that when the wound remains open, it is better to leave the arm [unbound], because it is better and more beneficial.
And some of them say that the bone marrow should be cauterized to the bone, and the cautery should be held there until some part of the bone's substance is hardened.
And then scrape away what is burned from the bone, and then it should be treated.
And others say that with the cautery, penetrate to the back, until it firmly enters the bone, until the bone is broken, and this is the form of a small alphecat [presumably a type of ulcer or lesion]: And they believe that vapors from the head exhale from that place.
And the wound should be kept open for a long time, and then it should be healed until it is consolidated.
But I have not seen these two types of cautery at all, except in some men, according to the way of fear; and leave that, my friend, it is better with health, when it is; for the head is weakened by the solution of its continuity, just as we have testified in the other members, and especially when the patient's head is of a cold nature.
And the first type of cautery is safer and better, in my opinion; and I use and work with that one for health.
Chapter Two.
Concerning the cautery of the head.
When a chronic and prolonged pain occurs in the whole head, and this is prolonged in the patient, and he uses leeches, cupping, purgatives, plasters, ointments, poultices, and similar remedies, and especially if he has already been cauterized with a cautery which we mentioned and none of these things benefit him, then consider whether the patient's head is of strong constitution by nature; and if it is not cold and finds great coldness, then cauterize that with another cautery below the previous one a little. And then cauterize that on the temple of his head with a cautery until the skin is parted. Incise the skin and let the bone be uncovered to the extent we have recounted, and cauterize that with a cautery in the back part of the head in the place which is called the vas – and that is the place where a cupping glass is placed. And lighten your hand in this, and do not uncover the bone, for the patient through this finds much greater pain, different from the pain of all the other cauteries of the head.
And I say this cautery in its place, for it is necessary that the cautery with which the temples of the head and the occiput are cauterized is a more subtle cautery than that with which the middle part of the head is cauterized; and this is its form.
Chapter three.
Concerning the cauterization of recent migraine.
When a sharp pain arises in the head, or a spreading pain within the eye, let the head be evacuated with purifying medicines, and let the other treatment be administered, which I have described in the sections on diseases; and if nothing helps, then cauterization is done in two ways: either cauterization with a sharp burning medicine, or with iron.
But cauterization with a burning medicine is that you take a clove of garlic, and peel it and cut off its extremities from both ends. Then incise the location of the pain in the temple with a lancet until a place is made there beneath the skin, until it is hidden.
Then bind it tightly with a compress for continuous constriction, and leave it for the space of three hours; then untie it and remove the garlic, and leave the wound for two or three days, and then place cotton soaked in butter on it until the area becomes soft.
And then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And if you wish, do this with some burning medicines which I have written about in the twelfth treatise on burning medicines.
But cauterization with iron in this manner:  heat the cautery, of which this is the form:
and it is called a nail or small nail, because its head is like the shape of a clove, in which there is some curvature, and in the middle of it is a small eminence.
And then place it on the location of the pain, and hold your hand — so that the burning which is below is not hurt — and move the iron little by little with speed.
And if the amount that is burned by the sharpness of the cautery is thus half of it, and lift your hand so that the artery below is not burned, so that there is no flow of blood.
And then soak cotton in salt water and place that on the location, and leave it for three days; and then place cotton soaked with  ointment, and then treat with ointment until it is healed.
And if you wish, cauterize with the tip of the knife as with a cautery, and beware of cutting the artery in this, specifically a not-ancient migraine.
Chapter four.
Concerning the cauterization of chronic migraine.
When you treat migraine with what we have said in the preceding treatment, and what we have said in the divisions of illnesses, and the treatment does not help, and sometimes because of the illness what we have said about the first cauterization with medicine or cauterization with fire is not enough, then it is necessary that you heat the knife cautery until it is white hot, so that you mark the location of the pain with a line whose length is half a finger, or something like that; and pause your hand for a moment and press it until you incise the artery and reach the bone.
However, it is necessary for you to be careful of the continuation of the jaw, which is weakened by chewing, and that the muscle not be hardened and the nerve that serves it, and that spasm does not occur.
And if it is about the guarding and caution of the flow of blood from the artery that is incised, because in its incision there is danger, and especially to one who is ignorant of what he is doing and is not studious and experienced; and leaves the operation to him at the beginning.
And I will come with a recollection of the treatment of accidental blood flow from the artery according to its manner, in its place in this book.
And if you see that this illness is not alleviated by this cauterization and the patient's body is tolerable, cauterize it in the middle of the head as we have recounted, and treat the wound until it is healed.
And if you wish, administer the cautery which we have mentioned in the chapter on the constriction of an artery with a cautery having two blades; this cauterization is better and more suitable.
Chapter 5.
On the cauterization of earaches.
When pain in the ear comes from cold and is treated with laxative remedies and with the other treatments that I have described in the section, and the pain is not relieved, then apply the cautery; this is the one called "puncta," of which this is the form:
Then apply the point, then the ignition, and let it be moved around the entire ear as a wheel is turned, or in the circumference of each part if the pain is in one part. Extend the cautery from the root of the ear little by little, after you have marked the location with a probe.
And if the cautery requires ten points in the whole ear, or in a part of it, then treat the areas until they are healed.
Chapter 6.
Concerning the cauterization of a cough.
A cough which is cured with cauterization is only one of those types which come from phlegm, as we have said in the divisions of diseases.
Avoid cauterization of the type of cough that arises from dryness or from a spasm of the nerve.
When you treat that type of cough with leeches, purgatives, and gargles, and your treatment is ineffective, then you should cauterize the patient with three cauteries:  the first at the root of the ear, the second a little below the temple, and the third at the junction of the two lips.
And place your cautery on the opposite side from the affected part, because softening [or relief] only comes to the part that appears healthy.
And the form of cauterization is that you cauterize it with the cautery at the very tip of the ear, a little above the temple, and another at the temple, the length of which should be according to the length of the thumb, and hold your cautery there until half the thickness of a finger's breadth is burned.
And this is the form of the cautery, and it is a type of knife, the form of which is shown before [in a diagram, presumably]. However, it is more subtle if it is a little like this; and it is necessary to cut away a little of the superfluous thickness.
And then care for the place with what has been previously prescribed until it is healed.
Chapter 7.
Concerning the cauterization of chronic apoplexy.
When apoplexy is chronic and you treat it with what we have said, and your medication is not effective, and the patient does not have a fever, then cauterize him with four cauteries: on all the horns of his head; and with a cautery in the middle of the head, as we have said; and with a cautery on the neck. And the manner of cauterization is done as described above.
And it is already cauterized above the mouth of the stomach; and it is further back; and then let it be treated with what follows.
Chapter 8.
Concerning the cauterization of forgetfulness done by flame.
So that large enemas and purging pills are given to the patient at the beginning.
And then shave the patient's entire head and apply to their neck a plaster of the kind described in the treatise on plasters.
And apply that several times, for that is a manner of cautery. And do this according to the same order which I have already said.
And if he is healed by those means, it is good; but if not, then make for him three cauteries in the back part of his head, which descend from the uppermost part of the head to the lowermost part of the neck. And place between each cautery the width of a finger, and then treat the cautery with what has been prescribed.
But if you add to it and the patient tolerates it, then make a cautery in the middle place; and if you wish a greater addition, then cauterize that on both sides. (or ...then cauterize on both sides of it.)
Then treat that until it is healed; and let the cautery be olive-shaped according to the form previously given.
Chapter 9.
Concerning the cauterization of paralysis and the softening of the whole body.
That you proceed in the purification of the head with leeches and with what we have said; and then shave the patient's head, and then cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head, and with a cautery on all the sides of the head, and with a cautery on the back part of it, and with three cauteries on the vertebrae of the neck.
And if it is necessary in the illness of softening of the body to find it and the patient is tolerant and the illness is severe, then cauterize it with four cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, and finally with a cautery until it is burnt from the tailbone of him, and raise your hand. And then cure it until it is healed, and this should be an olive-oil cautery.
Chapter 10.
Concerning the cauterization of epilepsy.
The epileptic is not cauterized unless that epilepsy is caused by phlegm.
And therefore it is necessary that you purify his brain at the beginning with herbs and with the other treatments which we have described in the section when the patient is strong and can tolerate the administration of medicines.
And if it is a child who cannot tolerate medicines, then administer gargles and masticatories that purify the brain, before that for many days, with improvement of the diet.
Then shave the head of the patient, and cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head according to the preceding method, and with another cautery in his occiput, and cauterize above each temple. And if the patient is strong and can tolerate it, then cauterize him with the cauteries that I have mentioned, having paralysis and softening of the body over the vertebrae of the neck and the vertebrae of the back.
And let the cautery be olive-shaped as previously described.
But if the patient is a child, then apply a small cautery according to this method.
Chapter 11.
On the cauterization of melancholy.
When the causes of melancholy are corrupt humors and a thick phlegm, then cauterize it with the cauteries which we have described in the treatment of paralysis.
And if the cause of melancholy is a superfluity tending towards melancholy, and the patient's body is moist, then give him to drink that which cleanses his brain, according to what has preceded in the division (of treatments).
And then shave the head of the patient, and then make a decent bandage for him/her in a circle, and then place that in the middle of the head.
And the patient should be seated upright and held securely on all sides.
And then apply a liniment; and it is more worthy to use old sheep's grease. And heat that over the fire with moderate warmth, which the said sufferer will feel when it is applied to him/her. And then pour that into the middle of his/her head within the circle, and leave it there until it is cooled.
And do this to the patient once a week, along with his/her other good treatment until he/she is healed; or if you wish, cauterize it by making small punctures according to the patient's need, but hold your hand with a cautery thus prepared: this is a type of cautery that moistens the brain evenly.
And then apply that cotton soaked in butter or goose grease.
Chapter 12.
Concerning the cauterization of water descending into the eye.
When the beginning of water in the eye is revealed to you by the signs which I have mentioned in the division, then begin and give the patient something to drink that will purify his head, and protect it from all humidity.
And make him sweat in a bath for several days.
And then order him to shave his head, and cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head; and then cauterize it with two cauteries on the two temples if the beginning of the descent of water is in both eyes, or on one side if the beginning of the water is in one eye.
Incise with a cautery all the veins and arteries which are below the temple; and let the cauterizations be far apart in the width of the temples.
And beware of a flow of blood when it is cauterized; and if you see a flow of blood from it, stop it with any medicine which is possible for you.
And I come with wisdom which is in the extraction of arteries and with the excision of them and the caution of blood flow.
And sometimes it is cauterized in the neck below the two bones with two cauteries placed far apart.
Chapter 13.
Concerning the cauterization of old tears (likely referring to old wounds or sores, possibly fistulas).
When the tears (wounds, sores) of the eyes are old and persistent, and through the veins and arteries which are in the manifest location of the head, and it is verified that this is a superfluity of cold phlegmatic humors, then cauterize that with the cautery which we recounted in the first chapter concerning water falling into the eyes, and with a cautery in the middle of the head and with two cauteries in the neck below the two temples, and with two cauteries in the neck below the two bones. And if it requires additional treatment, then cauterize that in all parts of the corner of the eye above the extremity of the eyebrow with a small cautery.
Chapter 14.
Concerning the cauterization of nasal odor (foul smell from the nose).
When you treat this with what we have said in the division and your treatment does not help, then you prepare and give the patient cochlearia (a spoonfull, or possibly a specific herbal remedy) to drink for three nights; and then shave his head, and cauterize it with a moderate-sized cautery, with an olive-shaped cautery. And then cauterize that with a clove-shaped cautery, with two cauteries above the two eyebrows, just below the hair a little.
And be careful with the burning, that you do not burn too deeply.
And of the clove-shaped cautery, this is the form (shape/method).
Chapter 15.
Of the cauterization for softening the eyelids of the eyes.
When the eyelid is softened by illness or humidity, then cauterize that eyelid with a lunar cautery; and this is its form:
And if you cauterize that (area) above the two eyebrows a little with two cauteries in each part, and they should be elongated towards the temples. And let the length of each cautery be according to the size of the eyebrow.
And do not press your hand too much with the cautery, but only enough so that a third part of the eyelid is hardened/dried.
Chapter XVI.
Concerning the cauterization of the eyelid of the eye when the skin is turned inward towards the parts within and punctures the eye.
When the skin of the eye is turned inward so that it punctures the eye, cauterization in such cases is done in two ways, for cauterization is either with fire or with a burning medicine.
If cauterizing it with fire, instruct the patient beforehand to shave the hairs as those who cleanse them do, until they are elongated and softened; and if it punctures beneath their roots, then you should bind the patient's eyes with a bandage so that they are not harmed until the hairs have grown back.
Then, when they are grown and softened, place the patient's head in your lap, and then mark on the eyelid of their eye with a probe, with a mark which is according to the figure of a myrtle leaf, and let the beginning of the mark be near the hairs.
And then apply a cotton swab soaked in egg white or in mallow mucilage to the eye.
And then ignite the cautery, of which this is the form.
And then cauterize over the figure which you have marked, little by little, in many times, until the surface of the cornea, which is like a myrtle leaf, is entirely burned.
And a sign of the success of your work is that you see the eyelid of the eye already contracted and the hairs around it raised from the puncture of the eye.
Then raise your hand and leave it for three days, and then apply cotton with a bandage until the scar is healed. And then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
But if some matter returns through the hairs near their origin and the eyelid is softened, then apply the cautery again in the same way as you did at first.
But if the hairs are under the eyelid, then cauterize it until it is raised to its natural place and is even, and the hairs do not prick the eye.
But cauterize with a burning medicine; that is, order the patient to pluck the hairs until they are elongated and even, and then make a paper or cloth shape like a myrtle leaf.
Then take known soap and quicklime, one ounce, or whatever, and mix these ingredients well, and do this quickly so that it does not cool; then spread this on the paper which is made in the shape of a myrtle leaf, and place this on one or both eyes; and place under the eye cotton soaked in egg white, and the patient's head should be in your lap.
And place your finger on the medicine and press it lightly, and do not move it until the patient feels the bite of the medicine, for the bite is like fire.
And then, when you perceive that he feels the bite, then leave the medicine and move it with your finger; then, when the biting sensation ceases, remove the medicine and wash the eye with water; and then observe if you see that the eyelid is already raised; if it is not raised you should constrain it with fire or incision, for then it is well; and if not, return some of the medicine to the place where the medicine has not been applied and it has not blackened until your operation is even and the eyelid is contracted.
Then place cotton with a bandage on it until the scab from the cauterization is removed, and then treat it with healing ointment or something else until it is healed.
And it is necessary for you, during your operation, to watch with diligent vigilance that nothing of the medicine falls into the eye, and if the eyelid after a few days is softened and some hair roots push into the eye, then repeat your medicine on that place of the eyelid which is softened, and properly as you did in the beginning, and then heal it until it is healed.
And this is the method for myrtle leaves.
And know that the eyes of men are diversified according to their size and smallness, and therefore your constriction is made accordingly.
And the way of rectitude will not be hidden from him who studies this art.
Chapter 17.
Concerning the cauterization of a fistula in the tear duct of the eye.
When you treat a fistula with what we have said in the divisions of diseases and your treatment does not succeed, then you must cauterize it in this manner: instruct the patient to place their head in your lap, and have a minister hold their head between your hands in such a way that their head is not moved or agitated.
And then place a cotton ball soaked in egg white or gum arabic on their eye.
And then heat the cautery, whose form is this:
which should be concave, like the shape of a reed or a vulture's feather, at the end with which the cauterization is done.
And if you wish, let it be penetrating to the other end. And if you wish, let it be hollow like a probe.
However, the concave one is better for your work.
Then press the fistula if it is open, and draw out the pus and dry it. And if it is not open, then open it and extract the rottenness from it.
Then place the cautery, which should be well ignited, over it, and hold your hand a little below the cautery, from the eye to the side of the nose, so that your hand does not waver or the patient is disturbed, and then place the cautery on the granulated tissue of the eye and burn it away.
And so if at the beginning your cautery reaches the bone, it is good; and if not, then repeat the cautery once or twice, if necessary; and leave it like that for three days, and then apply a dressing with lint and around it with a drying ointment until it is healed.
But if ten days have passed and it is not healed, then apply a sharp corrosive medicine until the bone is exposed and is scraped as is appropriate in its chapter.
And there is another method of cauterizing a fistula which some ancients described:  Locate the fistula and open it, and then place in that fissure a thin tube, the shape of which is like this:  And pour into it the quantity of one ounce of melted lead; and hold your hand with the tube with good retention, and do not disturb the patient so that the melted lead does not reach the eye; and it is necessary that you place over the patient's eye lint soaked in egg white or water, because the lead will adhere to the site of the fistula and heal it by marvelous healing.
And if the fistula is healed with what we have said about the cautery and the treatment, it is good; and if not, then it is necessary to make an incision in the nose and reduce the fistula to the body of the nose as it will come to its proper place.
Chapter 18.
On the cauterization of the fissure of the well (likely referring to a wound or ulcer).
Many times fissures occur on the lips, and mostly on the lips of children.
Therefore, if you treat those fissures with what we have said in the divisions and your treatment does not help, then apply a small, knife-like cautery according to this form that is shown:
And let its concavity be according to the thinness of a knife.
Then carefully place that instrument in those fissures until the cautery reaches the bottom of the fissures.
Then treat that with cerates until it is healed.
Chapter 19.
Concerning the cauterization of a fistula in the mouth.
When in the root of the uvula, or in the palate, or in the roots of the teeth, an abscess develops, then breaks, becomes chronic, and pus runs and a fistula is formed, and you treat it but the treatment is ineffective, then you should apply a cautery according to the size of the fistula. Then insert the heated cautery into the opening of the fistula, holding it with your hand until the heated iron reaches the bottom, and do this once or twice. Then treat it with what we have described for treatment until it is healed.
And so, if the wound is closed and heals, it is good; but if not, then it is necessary to expose the area and remove the corrupted bone as will be described in its chapter.
Chapter 20.
Concerning the cauterization of teeth and the softening of gums.
When the gums are softened by moisture and the teeth are loose, and you treat them with medicines without success, then place the patient's head on your lap, and then heat the cautery, the shape of which will be described later, in such a way that you place the bowl over the tooth and quickly insert the heated cautery into it, and hold it briefly until the patient feels the heat of the fire reaching the root of the tooth.
And then remove your hand, and then repeat the cauterization several times as needed.
And then let the patient fill their mouth with salt water and hold it for an hour, and then spit it out, because the loose tooth will be fixed, the softened gum will be tightened, and the corrupt moisture dried up.
Chapter 21.
On the cauterization of toothache.
When toothache is due to coldness, or there is cold or worms in it, and you don't achieve a cure with medicine, then cauterize it in one of two ways: either cauterize with a cow's horn, or cauterize with fire.
Cauterization with a horn is done by taking a cow's horn and boiling it in a pot of iron. Then take cotton and wrap it around the end of a stick, and then dip it in the boiled horn, and quickly place it on the aching tooth until it cools.
And then repeat this several times until the virtue of the fire reaches the root of the tooth.
And if you wish, submerge wool or cotton in the aforementioned boiled horn, and place that on the aching tooth, and place ignited iron on top of that until the iron reaches the bottom of the tooth's cavity.
However, cauterization with fire is that you should use a small tube of bronze or iron, and there should be some thickness in its core, and the sharpness of the fire should not reach the patient's mouth.
Then ignite the cautery, the shape of which is appropriate, and place it on the tooth and hold your hand there until the cautery cools; and do this several times because the pain will be relieved either that day or the next.
And it is necessary that, after the application of that cautery, the patient fill their mouth with good boiled water and hold it for an hour, and then spit it out; and this is the form of the cautery.
And cauterize with whatever extremity you wish, as is possible for you.
And this is the shape of the cannula:
Chapter 22.
On the cauterization of extrophulos (or possibly,  exanthematous eruptions/skin eruptions).
When extrophulos are from phlegm and cold humors and are not yielding to digestion by medicines, and you wish to digest them lightly, then ignite the cautery whose shape is as follows, having two open ends so that smoke escapes from one end of the cautery while the other is applied, and place this ignited cautery on the abscess once, and again if it is needed, until it reaches the bottom of the abscess.
And if the abscess is small, then apply the cautery according to the size of the abscess, and then leave it for three days and apply a cloth soaked in butter over it until what the fire has burned is softened.
And then treat it with ointment and bandages and cloths until it is healed.
Chapter 23.
Concerning the cauterization of hoarseness and the constriction of the throat.
When humors gather in the throat and lung, especially if this is accompanied by coldness of constitution, then it is necessary that the patient be evacuated initially with laxative medicines, and afterwards cauterize below the root of the throat in the constricted place.
And be careful not to reach the throat with the cautery, nor burn the windpipe, but only a little.
And cauterize that with another cautery below the junction of the neck at the last vertebra. And his cautery should be a nail, following the previous method.
And afterwards, treat it with what has been prescribed until it is healed.
Chapter 24.
Concerning the cauterization of lung disease and cough.
When cough and lung disease are caused by cold humors, and the patient has no fever or consumption and the illness is chronic, then cauterize with two cauteries on the clavicle in the depressed locations, left and right; and with another cauterization in the middle of the chest between the two nipples; and let the cautery be a nail according to the previous method.
And if you wish, your cauterization may be punctate with the cautery that is called a punctate cautery, the form of which precedes in the punctation of earache.
And let there be points within those [cauteries]; and then cure that with the same [methods] that are described before until it is healed.
And let the cautery have three prongs, for cauterization is done with it: with one application you can make three cauteries according to this method:
Chapter 25.
Of the cauterization of the titillic, which is the head of the penis.
When the head of the penis is dislocated because of lubricous humors and is not fixed in the hour of its return from its dislocation until that which is accustomed to return to it is there, and then by a small movement it is dislocated again so that it returns, as we have testified, then it is necessary that you first reduce the dislocation; and then the patient should be turned on his back or on his healthy side; and then elevate the glans which is inside the prepuce to the outside with the fingers of your left hand, if the joint is dislocated inwards.
And then heat the cautery having two heads; and this is its form:
And then cauterize the glans until it penetrates from one side to the other; and the figure of the cauterization will then be of four cauterized heads.
And sometimes it is adjusted according to this count, and therefore there are eight cauteries.
And then place on the cauterized area cooked porridges with salt, and then keep the patient still, and the limb should not be moved for some time until it is healed.
And if the dislocation is in the upper parts and this is done late, then cauterize over the muscle with a pointed cautery or with many pointed cauteries, because the joint is strengthened and the humidity is removed, and the patient is healed.
Chapter 26.
On the cauterization of the stomach.
When cold and many humors come into the stomach, so that it exceeds its capacity and remains multiplied within it, and if you continue the treatments and do not cure it, then the patient should lie supine, extend their hands and legs, and then cauterize it with three cauteries: one cautery below the feet, about the width of a finger, with a pointed cautery, and two cauteries below on either side of the cautery, so that the cautery forms a triangle; and space them so that they are not close together, which would cause rot.
And if the depth of the cautery is two-thirds the thickness of the finger.
And let the figure of the cautery be according to this form without addition. And if you wish, cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this form; and this should be a cautery in the form of a circle according to this form:
And let the stomach be cauterized, puncturing it where the cautery is feared: and it is that you mark on the stomach points according to the quantity you desire with a probe, and then cauterize those points with a cautery; and then treat it with the treatment that is previously described until it is healed.
Chapter 27.
On the cauterization of the cold liver.
When pain arises in the liver due to coldness, or humidity, or excessive flatulence, so that it is thrown from its normal composition by superfluous egress, and the patient is treated with what we have said and it does not help, then it is necessary that the patient be supine on his neck, and mark with a probe three cauteries according to this form and this same quantity on the liver under the hypochondria, where the patient's lying down is perceived.
And let the space which is between each cautery be according to the thickness of a finger, and let the cautery be according to the length of a straight finger.
And do not press too much with the cautery.
And if the quantity of what is burned is the amount of half the thickness of a finger, and no more should be applied; and if the patient is standing on his feet; and if he is not standing, then let him be lying down, having already spread his thighs, and raise his arms.
And it is possible for you to cauterize these places with a knife-cautery, when you have subtlety and prudence in the art.
And beware that you do not proceed too much in the cauterization, and let the thickness of a whole finger be burned so that the whole body is burned and penetrates to the intestines, because the finger is subtle here; and know this.
Chapter 28.
Of the perforation of an abscess of the liver with a cautery.
When there is an ulcer or abscess in the liver and you want to know if that abscess is in the flesh of the liver or in its tunic, then if it is in the flesh of the liver, the patient finds heaviness and dull pain.
And if it is in the tunic of the liver, the pain is very sharp and sometimes the doctors are fatigued by its treatment.
Therefore, the patient should be turned onto their side; and then mark the location of the abscess with a probe; and then apply the cautery, which is shaped like a rake, the form of which was shown on the previous page. And cauterize with that cautery until all the abscess is consumed, until it reaches the bottom, until pus comes out.
And then treat it with the treatment for other abscesses until it is healed.
And it is not fitting that this type of cautery be used except by one whose study in the art of medicine is extensive, and in whose hands many illnesses have been treated;  however, let someone with experience sometimes dare to undertake this operation, but otherwise leave it to us, and it is better.
Chapter 29.
On the cauterization of pleurisy.
The ancients said that a cautery of the roots of birthwort for cold pleurisy, made in this manner, is effective.  And this is it: that you take a long, dry root of birthwort, one finger in length that is found, and let it be of the thickness of a finger.
Then immerse it in oil and hold it to the fire, and then cauterize with a cautery in the area that is between the continuation of the clavicle and the neck; and with two small cauteries below the clavicles, slightly inclined towards the part that is below the beard, and with two cauteries in the area that is declining between the fifth rib and the sixth, inclining slightly towards the back; and with another cautery in the middle of the chest; and with another on the stomach; and with three cauteries on the back; and with a cautery in the area that is between the two shoulders, and with two cauteries on the two sides of the chest, below the cautery which is between the two shoulders.
And it is not necessary that you grasp your hand with the cautery; rather, let it be in the manifest work of the handle. (Meaning: Don't hold the cautery directly with your hand, use the handle).
And some ancients said that some men use a cautery of iron similar to a ray and ignite it, and place it in the area that is between the ribs, until it reaches that abscess and healthy flesh is formed, just as we have said in the case of an abscess of the liver.
But this perforation with a cautery is not without danger, because one can quickly kill the fistula in the place to which there is no healing.
Chapter 30.
On the cauterization of the spleen.
When you treat the disease of the spleen with what we have said about treatment in the division and your treatment does not succeed, then cauterize it in three ways, all of which are correct. One is to make three or four cauteries lengthwise according to the length of the spleen, following the shape of the liver cauteries, the shape of which has been previously described.
And let the width between each cautery be the breadth of a finger or a little more, and the manner of cauterization should be the same as that which we described for the cauterization of the liver.
And do not press your hand on the cautery; and let the patient be lying on his or her side.
And another method of cauterization is to apply a cautery with two points, as we described in the chapter on muscle dislocation, and raise the rib which is in the region of the spleen where the patient lies on their left side.
And let your elevation, by which you raise the rib, follow the length of the body, so that the cauterizations are made according to the width of the body.
And then insert the two points, very hot, into that space, so that with them you penetrate the rib from the other side.
And then withdraw the cautery; and thus four cauterizations are made.
And if you wish, cauterize with a cautery having three points.
And then you treat the cautery until it has stopped discharging pus for many days, for this is more important than the other preceding actions in the treatment.
Chapter 31.
Concerning the cauterization of a dropsical patient.
Cautery is not applied in dropsy, but only in the case of [a swelling/inflammation -  'alcinte3' is likely a corruption or archaic term needing further context for precise translation].
When you treat a dropsical patient with the methods of treatment which we have described in the division and your treatment is not effective, then you should cauterize him with four cauteries in a circle around the navel, and with one cautery on the stomach, and with another cautery on the liver, and with another cautery on the spleen, and with two cauteries between the vertebrae of the back, and one cautery on the right foot, and with another cautery on the stomach. And the depth of the cautery should be approximately equal to the thickness of a finger.
And leave the cauterization open so that it discharges pus for a long time.
And do not remove the patient from treatment near the cautery with what is necessary, so that two intentions are added to him, and he will be helped towards a speedy recovery.  (The phrasing is somewhat awkward;  it likely means don't interrupt the treatment prematurely, allowing for a more complete healing process.)
The shape of the cautery with which the abdomen is cauterized should be nail-shaped, as its form is described above. And that with which the back is cauterized should be olive-shaped, as its shape is described above.
Chapter 32.
Concerning the cauterization of the feet and thighs.
When the feet are inflamed with dropsy and filled with yellowish water, it is necessary to cauterize the feet on the top of the foot, not in the space between the little toe and the ring finger. Raise your hand with the cautery and do not twist it; and then raise your hand, and do not completely lower it, because the yellow water will flow out.
The cautery is according to this form:  Then make two cauterizations on both thighs, and on each thigh, let a cauterization be made with the knife-like end of the cautery. And let the cautery be according to the length of the thigh: one below the knee and the other below the middle of the thigh; and on each thigh two cauteries.
And leave the wound open without treatment for a long time so that some water may drain from it.
And then treat it with those things which we have mentioned.
Chapter 33.
On the cauterization of the abdomen.
When the abdomen is afflicted by cold and humidity to the point that it weakens the virtues, that is, the digestive and retentive virtues which are in the stomach and intestines, and this is treated with methods of treatment and does not yield, and sometimes the patient suffers and cauterization is indicated, then cauterize it with a large cautery over the stomach as previously described in the cauterization of the stomach, with a circular cautery and with four small cauteries in the circumference of the navel, with a thin nail-like cautery; and with a cautery on the hypochondrium, large or with two cauteries.
And if sometimes the humors are exuberant and the patient tolerates it, then cauterize it over the pubic area and over the intestines, and quickly apply two cauteries to the stomach and near the inguinal regions, for it is a perfect and helpful treatment from which you will not err.
Chapter 34.
On the cauterization of chronic hemorrhoids.
When there are chronic hemorrhoids in the nature of thick, cold humors or corrupted humidities, and they are treated with what we have said in the division and your treatment does not work, then cauterize with three cauteries on the lowest part of the sacrum, small and slightly triangular, and with a cautery above the navel, placed as two fingers apart.
And if you suspect that his stomach is cold and his food is not digested, and you see his face inflamed, then cauterize that on the stomach with a large cautery as previously described; and with one cautery on the liver, and with another cautery on his spleen with a nail-shaped cautery, and leave the cautery open for some time, and then treat him until he is healed.
Chapter 35.
On the cauterization of swellings near their excision.
When you excise a swelling, then you ignite the cautery that is shaped like a ray. Then insert that ignited cautery into that excised swelling, and keep your hand there until the cautery reaches the opening of the vein from which the blood comes.
And do this once or twice, for if the swellings are numerous, then cauterize each of them as we have recounted, and afterwards treat them with ointments until they are healed.
And if you cauterize with a large cautery on someone, it is more effective in healing.
Chapter 36.
Chapter 36. On the cauterization of fistulas that are formed naturally in the private parts.
When nature does not obey the treatment that we have recommended in its place, and the patient is frightened by this, let it be healed with cautery.
Therefore, when someone has a fistula in the anal region, and it is old,  it is filled with pus and corrupt humors.  Then what is most fitting to do is to probe it with a thin probe, and then determine the depth of it with the aforementioned probe.
Then ignite the cautery which resembles a ray (or rod). Then insert that ignited cautery into the fistula, according to the depth measured by the probe.
And repeat the cauterization until those corrupt bodies are burned, once, twice, or thrice, according to your necessity.
And beware of burning nerves and veins; or if the fistula goes to the body of the bladder or to the body of the bowel, then beware of all those places; and do not do this unless the fistula is in fleshy tissue and you think it is not penetrating (deeper structures).
Then care for the place until it is healed.
And if the place is sealed, and the matter is excised from it, and it remains so for a long time, then know that it is entirely cured.
And if the matter is not removed from it, then know that it is penetrating, or in the bone beneath it is corrupt, or this comes from those causes, the memory of which will come in its place (i.e., will be discussed later).
Chapter 37.
On the cauterization of wounds.
When in wounds pain arises from cold or excessive inflammation, and because of this the patient's body is weakened, then it is necessary that you cauterize that (area) over the wounds with a cautery, over each wound with a pointed cautery, of which the preparation has already been mentioned.
And quickly cauterize again a little below, so that three linear cauterizations result, and then they will be more helpful in healing.
Chapter 38.
On the cauterization of the bladder.
When weakness and softening occur in the bladder due to cold and humidity, so that the patient cannot retain urine, then cauterize that (area) in the lowest part above the bladder, where the hairs of the pubic region begin, and cauterize with one cautery on the right side, and with another on the left.
And let the length of each cautery be according to the size of the walnut; and cauterize that with a cautery in the lowest part of the back, or with two cauteries if necessary.
And let the cautery be nail-shaped, as is customary.
Chapter 39.
On the cauterization of the breast.
When cold and dampness come to the breast, and because of this pregnancy is prevented, and her menses are corrupted, and their provocation is delayed, and pain occurs with their arrival, then the place should be cauterized with three cauteries in the circumference of the navel, as we have said in the cauterization of the bladder; and with a cautery on the lowest part of the back, or with two cauteries, and let the cautery be nail-shaped.
Chapter 40.
On the cauterization of a dislocated hip.
When mucous humors are poured into the area of the hip, and are the cause of its displacement, and a sign of this is that one thigh is longer than the other when compared. And the location of the dislocation is found where it bulges.
Then it is necessary that you cauterize the patient on the part of their hip with a circular cautery, after you have marked with a probe the circumference of the affected area as it is swollen, so that the affected area falls within the middle of the circle.
And let the cautery be of the kind previously described in the cauterization of the stomach.
And if that cautery is not at hand, then cauterize it with three cauteries using a large olive-shaped cautery.
And let the cautery be done according to the amount of swelling of the whole leg; and then treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 41.
On the cauterization of the sciatic vein.
When pain comes in the hip area, and it is caused by cold and dampness, and the patient is treated with what we have said and it doesn't work, and this is ancient practice, then you should purge the patient of gross humors with foul-smelling pills or artificial pills or similar; and then cauterize it.
And the manner of cauterization in that case is according to two methods: either cauterization with burning medicines, or cauterization with fire.
If according to two known methods, of which one is that you cauterize that area on the patient's hip with three triangular cauteries according to this form; and make them of good depth. And let the space which is between each cautery be the amount of the thickness of a finger, whether the cautery is olive-shaped or large.
But sometimes let the cautery be in the middle of the area, on the head of the hip, so that there are four cauteries.
And if you wish, cauterize with the circle whose form precedes in the cauterization of a hip dislocation, so that it is a contained circle and burns the thickness of the entire hip.
And this is the method of cauterization in sciatica when the pain is confined to the hip and is not extended to the thigh.
But if it is extended to the thigh, then cauterize that with two cauteries on the thigh, on the place to which the patient points as the location of pain; and with one cautery on the kneecap, four finger-widths below the outer part (lateral side).
And if the cautery is knife-shaped, let the depth of the cautery be according to the thickness of the hip.
And if the patient indicates that the pain extends to the area near the toes, then cauterize there where indicated with a cautery in three or four points, or more if needed.
And if the patient indicates the pain to be below the buttock towards the thigh, then cauterize there with a knife-shaped cautery.
And be careful in all cauterization that you do not go so deep with the cautery as to burn nerves or major arteries, lest this cause harm or contraction to the patient.
And I have seen one and another of those whom I cauterized on the ankle, and went too deep in the cauterization, and the leg swelled until the swelling reached the foot, and the whole foot was perforated and corrupted. And then a strong case of diarrhea followed, and then death.
And if the pain is in two places at once, cauterize each according to this method.
And some wise men say concerning the cauterization of the ankle, the cautery of which is this method: make a circle of iron, the circumference of which is half a palm; and let the opening be according to the thickness of a date pit or a little less.
And inside that circle, let there be another, a third; and let the space which is between them be the quantity of a walnut; and let those circles be open in two parts; and let the length of those irons be a walnut or two walnuts, and make in those irons a properly prepared mark in the circles; and this is its form:
Then let it be heated in the fire until it glows red and throws off sparks, and then let it be placed on the part of the ankle, the patient lying on their side. Therefore cauterize that with three round cauteries at once.
Then leave that for three days; then plaster it with boder and leave the wound open for many days; and then cure it with ointment until it is healed.
Says Albucasis: Oh, son, of this type of cautery we have used little because of the fear of its appearance, and because we have found few who dare to look upon it.
But of the good cauteries to him who suffers them, and finds with it the place of it.  (This is a slightly awkward sentence; a better translation might be: "But the good cauteries are for him who endures them, and it finds the affected area.")
But cauterize with burning medicines, so that you make two circles having a perforated armature in which you place the hook of the iron door; let the length of the walls in the height of them be two nuts or whatever those are. (This sentence is very difficult to translate literally because of its archaic phrasing and unclear terminology.  The meaning is that a cauterizing instrument should be constructed in a specific way involving circles, an armature, and a hook, with the overall dimensions comparable to two nuts.)
And if the space which is between each is the quantity of the thickness of a finger; and they are open below and above, and they contain themselves between them according to this form: (The sentence describes the spacing and configuration of something, likely referring to a diagram not included in the text.)
Then place the patient on their side over the affected part of the hip, and press your hand on the hip area; then take warm water and pour it between the two circles, and the heat of it should be applied slowly, and hold it for about an hour, and let the patient suffer the biting and burning of it—because this causes a burning sensation like fire—until the burning stops.
Then raise your hand with the instrument and wipe the warm water from the entire hip with fresh water.
Then leave it for three days and apply a poultice until the blackness of the burn is removed, and leave it for some days, and pus will drain from it; this is the final treatment.
Then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And if the pain extends to the hip or leg, apply a similar bath containing water as was done for the hip.
And this is the method for warm water, and I have already written about it in the treatise on the rectification of medicines. Take alkali and quicklime, equal parts of each, and crush them and place them in a new pot, the bottom of which is perforated by a small hole, according to the amount that will enter the ray.  (The "ray" here likely refers to a specific instrument or location, perhaps a tube or body part).
And place another inverted pot below the bottom of the pot, and pour over the alkali and quicklime fresh water which covers them by one finger's breadth; and when you compress them with your hand with good compression, and allow the sharp water to descend from above into the inverted pot below.
And then collect all that water, and pour it over fresh quicklime and alkali, for then it will be of very strong acidity, which is used in many medical operations and in cauterizing other limbs, because it acts like fire.
And some medicines with which it is also cauterized are:  honey,  vinegar, and lime with soap, mixed together in this way.
And Galenus recounts the operation and cure of a man from ancient times by which pain in the hip and sciatic nerve was cured, and greatly praised the excellence of this method, and said that it needed no other cure, and that he was healed at once as was recounted, for he quickly entered the bath and was free from it.
And it is that fresh rue should be taken, and if fresh rue is not found, a fresh fig should be taken; and it should be crushed very well with a little lard and placed on the hip where the pain is, or on the thigh, or on the leg, and bandaged.
And it should be left on for three hours, or for as long as the patient feels a decrease in the burning sensation.
Then put him in a bath, and when his body is reddened, expose him to the sun, for the pain ceases and he is healed.
And know that one should not use cautery with these medicines except after the evacuation of the body.
But already Dioscorides said that when the varicose vein is cauterized with goat's dung, it profits him much; and the cautery should be done in this manner: wool should be taken and soaked in old oil, and placed between the toes and the ankle.
Then take dried goat dung and burn it until it becomes charcoal; and then place it on the wool and leave it until it is extinguished. Then repeat this, and do not cease doing this until the feeling of the cauterization reaches the ankle and relieves the pain.
And this manner of cautery is called cautery of goats. (or, more literally:  And this method of cautery is called goat cautery.)
Chapter 42.
On the cauterization of toothache.
Sometimes pain is in the teeth from various causes, such as a fall or a blow or excessive evacuation, and from similar causes, by infusion of cold and humid matter.
And cautery is only suitable for that single type which is caused by an effusion of cold matter.
Therefore, after evacuation of the patient with purging pills and similar remedies,  make incisions on the tooth where the pain is located, three lines according to its width, marking with ink on each line five cauteries or more, depending on the patient's tolerance and their strength.
And let the cauterization be done with a pointed cautery.
And if you wish, cauterize with three or four cauteries using a nail-shaped cautery, according to this form:
Chapter 43.
On cauterization at the beginning of gibbosity (or hunchback).
Often this illness happens to small children; and a sign of its beginning in children is that it occurs in their spine with elevation and movement.
And you find in the last vertebra of the back and neck that it begins to rise above the other vertebrae.
And so when you see this and want to prevent it, then cauterize that with a cautery that is circular according to this form: so that the cautery takes in all parts of the vertebra equally.
And if you wish, cauterize in the circumference of the vertebra with the pointed cautery two or three lines. And let the points be close to each other.
And then care for the place until it is healed with what we have said.
But beware that cautery is not administered in a swelling that is caused by a spasm of the nerves.
Chapter 44.
On the cauterization of gout and joint pain.
When joint pains are caused by cold humors which are infused into each member of the body, then when pain comes in the feet, it is customary for doctors to call this gout properly.
And so if gout caused by cold is cured with a method of treatment and the pains are not removed, then cautery removes them.
And it is that you cauterize that near evacuation in the area of the joint of the foot with many cauteries.
And let the cautery be olive-shaped, of which this is the form:
And if it is necessary that a puncture be made on the surface of the foot, then do it with a pointed cautery. And if the pains rise into the knees or other joints, and this often happens, then cauterize that area on each knee with three or four cauteries on each side with this olive-shaped cautery.
And if many cauteries are necessary, then cauterize that area, and do not press too hard with your hand and the cautery beforehand; let it only be around the thickness of a finger.
And if the pains rise into both knees, then administer the cautery which we have described in its chapter.
And if the pains are only in the hands, and it is called a type of gout, then puncture in the circle of the veins as they wind around, puncture along those two lines.
And if the pains remain in the fingers, then puncture in the circle of the veins on each knuckle and on the palm of the hand.
And if the pains rise to the sides, the hips or the muscles in a few days, then cauterize them on every side of the affected areas.
And do not neglect the patient's good regimen and reception of medicines, for if a good regimen is followed and the inflammation is evacuated with this cautery, he will be healed, God willing.
Chapter 45.
On the cauterization of fractures.
When a rupture occurs in the groin, with the intestines protruding in front of the scrotum, and this is beginning to happen, then you must order the patient to abstain from food that day and to use lenitive measures so that the hernia may descend from his abdomen.
Then hold the patient between your hands over his groin, and instruct him to hold his breath until the hernia or intestine is expelled or appears.
Then return that [the hernia/intestine] with your fingers and gently push the rupture back onto the pubic bone, noting that its extremity should resemble a semicircle in the upper parts of the body.
Then heat the cautery, which is of this form:
until it is very red and throws off sparks. Then return the intestine or hernia to its cavity, and place your hand over the area so that the intestine does not protrude.
And you have already opened the space between the patient's thighs and placed a cushion beneath them, and another servant should be at their legs, and another at their feet, who should hold their hands.
Then place the cautery on that mark with your hand, holding the cautery straight, and hold it there until you reach with it the bone of the penis to the middle of the scrotum; and repeat this another time if you did not reach the bone on the first attempt.
And observe wisely the position of the intestine during your cauterization, so that you do not burn the intestine, lest death or other great harm come upon the patient.
And know that if you do not reach the bone with the cautery, do not consider your operation complete.
And it is necessary that the cautery for children be small according to their size and measure.
Then care for the cauterized area for three days with a poultice until the burn scab is softened.
And then treat it with other ointments until it is healed.
And the patient should lie on their back for forty days until the area and the wound are sealed/healed.
And it is necessary that you give him nourishment according to the length of his treatment, which will cleanse his belly, and that the intestine does not come out due to the effort of healing.
And then, when he wants to get up after about forty days, apply a properly made bandage, and keep it on for another forty days.
And let him be relieved of work and the overconsumption of food and drink, and of loud voices, for when he uses this regimen of complete healing, he will be completely healed.
And I will describe the treatment of ruptures in other parts of the abdomen; and if, at the beginning, you want them not to protrude, then cauterize the rupture with a round cautery according to its size, and let that which is excised from the wound be about one third of it; and then treat it with what we have said, and it is sufficient.
And some earlier authorities said that the rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cautery according to this shape, as it is marked with a probe:
and a line is placed across the widest part of the rupture, and another line above it; and you apply your hand with a pointed cautery, but the first cautery is lighter and better.
Chapter 46.
On the cauterization of torsion. (or: On cauterizing a torsion/twist)
When pain develops in some limb due to a fall or a blow, and that pain persists for a long time and does not yield to treatment with medicines, then it is necessary to cauterize with a pointed cautery.
And let the cauterization of each limb be according to its size and smallness, and its strength and weakness, and the location of the torsion and its pain.
Therefore, if it heals with the first cauterization, it is good; and if not, then repeat the cauterization; for it is customary for such pains to be punctured from one limb to the neighboring one, wherefore it is necessary to treat those with cautery until the patient is healed.
Chapter 47.
Concerning the cauterization of leprosy.
Lepers are sometimes helped greatly by cautery, especially if the type of leprosy is caused by putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy.
And so, if you wish to cauterize a leper, consider if the leprosy is spreading and if it has been treated with what we have said in the division and it has not ceased, nor remains, and you fear that the corruption will encompass the whole body and complexion of the patient, then cauterize the head with five cauteries: one in the middle of the head, and a second just below it, towards the forehead at the hairline; and two more on either side of the head, like horns; and one in the back, on the nape of the neck.
And finally, with the cautery, press lightly so that a small impression is made on the bone, and the scabs are dislodged from it, so that the expulsion of thick vapors is relieved; and cauterize over the spleen as needed.
And if the leprosy is already widespread on the patient and manifestly apparent, then you should cauterize with the cauteries we mentioned on the head; and with a cautery on the tip of the nose, and with two cauteries on the two cheekbones, and with two cauteries on two vertebrae of the neck, and with six cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, and with one large cautery on the vertebrae near the coccyx, and one on the coccyx, and with two on the hips, and one on each buttock, and with two on the knees, and one on each knee, and with two on the ankles, and with two on the muscles, and with two on the tendons of his feet; and cauterize on all the joints of the fingers of the hands and feet, and on each heel of his feet, and on the knuckles of his hands.
And beware of the nerves that are on the heel, so as not to burn them.
And sometimes it is cauterized with one cautery on the pubic bone and another on the stomach opening, and another on the liver.
And know that the more precisely you apply cauteries, the more helpful and beneficial it is; and know that the patient does not feel pain from the cautery, as healthy people do, because his body is already numbed.
And the cauteries should be large or small according to the limbs and joints, as is prescribed by the types of instruments.
Then treat the cautery with cooked barley flour mixed with honey and with other treatments until it is healed.
Chapter 48.
On cauterization of numbness.
When a limb is numb or asleep and has been treated with medicines, oils, and plasters, and is not healed, then you cauterize that numb limb with cauteries according to the size or smallness of the limb.
And let your cautery penetrate the thickness of the skin a little. And then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And sometimes a numbness is cauterized which extends to the hands and feet, and to the vertebrae of the back, near the emergence of the nerves which move that limb, and the numbness is relieved.
But do not presume to do this except one who is learned in the anatomy of the limbs and the emergence of the nerves moving the whole body.
Chapter 49.
Concerning the cauterization of white patches which is morphea.
When a white patch is old and you apply no ointments of medicine to it, then you cauterize it with a cautery iron slightly, according to the quantity and nature of the patch, until the whiteness and its color are relieved, and its color is changed.
And then treat it with flour of barley and lentils with rose oil and with leaves of arnaglossa, and with pigeon's blood or raven's blood; let each be a part and all be mixed, and then spread a cloth and place it over the area until it is healed.
Chapter 50.
Concerning the cauterization of cancer.
When cancer is beginning and you wish to remove it, then cauterize it with a circular cautery iron around its circumference as it is swollen.
And the wise men say that it should be cauterized with the pointed cautery in the middle; but to me this is not advisable, for I fear that it will become ulcerated, and I have already seen this happen several times.
And it is more proper that it be cauterized around its circumference with a circle as we have said, or with many cauteries.
Chapter 51.
On the cauterization of a boil/abscess.
When a boil is delayed in maturation, and this is due to the superfluity causing it, or the age of the patient, because they are old and decrepit, with little blood, or due to the time of year, and you want to hasten the maturation of the boil; then cauterize around its circumference with many small, punctate cauteries; and then leave it, for it will hasten maturation.
But if you want to perforate it with a cautery, then you heat the cautery, of which this is the form: and place it in the middle of the boil until it penetrates the skin.
And if the cautery is in a place where there is pus below, so that the body of the abscess is relieved; and then treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 52.
Concerning the cauterization of corrosives.
A corrosive is a corruption moving in the limb, which corrodes it like fire consuming dry wood.
Therefore, if you see this corrosive in a place that can tolerate cautery with fire, then you immediately cauterize with small, hot nails, large or small according to what is appropriate for the place where the corrosive is.
And then cauterize it entirely until you eradicate all the corrosion and nothing of it remains.
And then leave it for three days, and place crushed sulfur mixed with oil on the cauterized areas until the scabs are completely eradicated and all the corruption is gone.
And then treat it with a flesh-generating ointment.
But if after three days you see that healthy flesh has grown where there is no corruption, it is good; but if not, then repeat the cautery on what remains in the corrupted places.
And corrosion is sometimes treated with a sharp medicine, for that is a remedy in place of cautery. But however, cautery with fire is of more readily available help.
And I have already mentioned the treatment of it with sharp medicine in the section, and therefore take that when you have need of it.
Chapter 53.
Of the cauterization of wounds and other similar things.
Many times, a disease called a wound happens in the parts under the foot, and it is a large, penetrating injury which injures the foot; and cautery in those cases is according to two methods, that is cautery with fire and cautery with hot water.
But cautery with fire is that you heat the concave cautery resembling a vulture's beak, which should be made of iron according to the size which contains the wound in all parts, and should be of fine edges.
And then place that heated iron on the wound, and then move your hand with the cautery in a circle around the wound until the cautery reaches the depth of the wound. And leave it there for three days until it begins to shed slough. And then plaster it with crushed wild mallows mixed with salt, and leave the plaster on it for one night, for this will eradicate it from its roots.
And then treat the area with a flesh-generating ointment until it is healed.
And if it is not converted, and this often happens on the surface of the body, especially on the hands and feet, then you must apply cautery with water to those areas.  Take a cannula of bronze or iron or a vulture's feather, and place it over the wound; then pour a small amount of hot water into the cannula, and hold your hand, and you rotate it with the pressure of your hand overall, and let the edge of the cannula be pressed into the root of the wound, and the hot water will find its way to the root of the wound; and let the patient endure the bite of the hot water for a while, about an hour, and then remove it, for the wound with its roots will be eradicated.
And do the same with those and then the others until you have treated all those that are in the body.
And then treat those, once the roots of the wounds are eradicated, with ointments that generate flesh.
Chapter 54.
On the cauterization of tremors.
When someone suffers from tremors due to cold in the nerves, or from a fever of cold origin, or a similar cause, then you should cauterize them with four or five cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, one cautery between each vertebra; and with a cautery on their feet, and on their stomach, using an olive-shaped cautery.
And his tremor will subside, and hasten the healing of the cold illness.
Chapter 55.
On the cauterization of accidental blemishes to the body.
When blemishes appear on the body, and there are pustules and fissures caused by thick, corrupted matter; then, at the beginning of their appearance, it is necessary that they be cauterized on the head of the fistula with a fine cautery with myrtle wood, the tip of which is heated in the fire; or with a long root of erestologia; or with a lenticular cautery.
And sometimes the cautery is also applied at the beginning of its expulsion in this manner; and they are not believed, and the superfluity is broken up by making them, and heals from them.
However, it is necessary that this be done near evacuation with phlebotomy.
Chapter 56.
Chapter 56. On the cauterization of a blood flow accident caused by an arrow wound.
Many times there is a flow of blood from an arrow wound that is incised near the wound, which flows outward, or near the incision of abscesses or cauterization of the limb, and then it looks similar, and it is difficult to stop that.
Therefore, when this happens to someone, then you press with your hand to the opening of the arrow wound, and place your finger over it tightly many times until the flow of blood is stopped under your finger, and it does not come out.
And then put small and large olive-shaped cauteries in the fire, many in number, and blow on them until they are very hot.
And then take one of those, small or large depending on the location and wound where the artery is broken,  on that vein quickly after you have removed your finger, and hold the cautery until the bleeding is stopped and constrained.
And if the blood is expelled from the opening of the artery when you remove your finger and withdraw the cautery, then take another cautery quickly from among the cauteries which are prepared in the fire, and then do not cease to do this one after another until the bleeding is stopped.
And be careful not to burn the nerve that is there, and that another ailment comes upon the patient.
And know that when blood flows from an artery, it is not possible to stop the bleeding in those cases, and especially when the artery is large, except in one of four ways: either with a cautery as we have said, or with extraction if it is not extracted already, because when it is extracted the extremities are best burned and the blood is stopped, or that it be tied with thread or a ligature with strong constriction, or that medicines be placed on it whose virtue is to stop blood; and these are tightened with a cushion with appropriate compression.
But that which administers appropriate constriction with ligature and with tightness with cloths or by the application of cauterizing agents and the like, does not provide relief except late.
But if this happens to someone and the physician or medicine is not present, then gently press with the index finger on the opening of that vein as we have said, and apply great pressure to it until the blood is stopped from the main part of the wound, and the finger should not be removed from the artery; and above the artery let it be sprinkled with very cold water until the blood is congealed and thickened; and consider whether cautery or medicine is needed.
Of incisions and perforations and cupping and of phlebotomy and of wounds and their similars.
We have already discussed in the first chapter every illness in which cautery with fire and with burning medicine is suitable, and its occasions and causes, and the necessary instruments with the forms of the cauteries; and I have ordered the chapters from the head down to the feet.
And I will proceed in this chapter in the same manner, so that the one seeking this will be relieved, then on that which he will have requested.
And before I begin this, it is necessary, son, that you learn that in this chapter is that which is in the first chapter on cauterization, but in a less frightening way.
And because it is necessary that there be great caution, for in the operations which are in this chapter, many times there is an evacuation of blood, with which life depends, because of the opening of a vein or incision on an abscess, or opening of a wound, or purification of a wound, or extraction of an arrow, or incision of a stone, and the like. And all of these are accompanied by fear and trembling, and in most of them death occurs.
And I admonish you that this hesitation should not fall upon you, because sometimes it happens that you will deal with men with many kinds of illnesses. And some of them become angry with their illness and death is light for them; this is because of the intensity of what they suffer from their illness, and because of the length of their illness, and with the illness is a fear which signifies death.
And there are those who give you their possessions and say that you are hoping for their health, and their illness is pernicious.
Therefore, it is not fitting that you consent to those who come to you who are of this kind; and your caution should be greater than covetousness and your greed; and do not presume anything about this except with certain knowledge which verifies this to you, and to which a laudable outcome follows.
And use in the treatment of all your patients prognostication and indication of him to whom health is restored, for in this is to you aid in acquiring fame and memory, praise and glory.
O, sons, may God inspire you with His understanding and not withhold from you guidance and protection, for this is in His hand.
And I have ordered this chapter, distinguishing it by chapters as preceded in the chapter on cauteries, from the care of the head to the feet, so that this which you ask for and of which you have need may be alleviated for you.
Chapter One.
Of the treatment of the water which is contained in the heads of children.
Know that this illness often happens to children during childbirth and when the nurse compresses the child's head without skill.
And sometimes it happens for a hidden cause which is unknown.
But I have only seen this illness in children; and in all those whom I saw, death followed, and thus it is to me a work left undone in those cases.
And I have seen a child whose head was filled with water, and his head was always thus enlarged until he could not support himself because of the size of his head, and moreover the humidity increased until he died.
And this humidity is either collected between the skin and the bone, or it is collected under the bone on the skull.
For the operation in that case, if the humidity is between the skin and the bone and the abscess is small, then you should make an incision in the middle of the head with a fissure in width, and the length of the fissure should be about two nuts so that the humidity flows out, and this is the form of a spatula:
And so if the humidity is more increased and the abscess is larger, then there are two incisions in this manner:
And if the humidity is under the bone, the sign is that you see the sutures of the head opened on all sides and the water is squeezed out when you compress it with your hand on the inside parts, and this is not hidden from you. You should make an incision in the middle of the head with three fissures in this manner:
And then extract all the humidity from the incision; and then bind the incisions with cloths and feathers; and then pour wine and oil over it until the fifth day, and then untie the binding and treat the wound with tents and ointments, and bind the head evenly; and let the patient eat dry food with little humidity until the member is strengthened and healed.
And there is another method of incision, that you consider where the magnitude of the abscess and the collection of water appear, for sometimes it is more in the occiput, or in the front part, or on the right, or on the left; and therefore aim with the incision where the abscess and the collection of water appear, and do it as best you can.
And observe that you do not cut the artery and cause a flow of blood, and the patient dies from that blood flow with evacuation of humidity.
Chapter Second (or Chapter Two).
When someone develops cataracts or rheum in the eyes or feet, and this is chronic, and the cure is not achieved through medicines, then the last resort is incision of those two arteries (referring to the arteries near the ears mentioned previously).
And therefore, when you wish to incise them, have the patient shave their head, and then rub the area with a rough cloth so that the arteries appear; and then the patient's neck should be constricted with a cloth; and then consider where the vein pulses; and the locations of each, above the places which are near the ears, are compressed, and thus hidden except in some men.
And then mark the artery with a probe, and then incise each one with a sharp lancet on each side, making the incision reach the bone, and this should be done across the width of the head.
And if you wish, insert the lancet under the artery and cut it at the incisions above.
And let the length of the incision be about two joined fingers, because when a vein is incised, the blood comes out with a pulsatile flow, which spurts out frequently.
But if the artery does not appear to the touch, then you must measure from the ear a space of three fingers, and then mark it with a probe, and cut down to the bone.
And the amount of blood that should be let is about six ounces, and quickly let more or less, and all this depends on the strength of the patient and the fullness of their artery.
And then consider the wound, and if any cause of the injury remains on the bone, then incise it so that a hot abscess does not develop.
Then bind the wound with feathers and linen bandages, and treat it with ointments until it is healed.
Chapter 3.
Concerning the extraction of arteries which are in the temples.
When someone suffers from chronic migraine or sharp headaches, due to acrid humors and a quality in the tissues of the temples, or if it is an old, severe headache similar to these, and it is treated with medicinal methods of healing and this does not help, then in these illnesses we must attempt the extraction of arteries in the temples, or their cauterization, as we have shown.
And the method of the operation and extraction of these is that the patient shaves the hair which is on the temples; and attend to the artery apparent in the temple, for it is shown to you by its pulse, and is hidden except in few men by the force of cold.
And if it is hidden from you, then the neck of the patient should be constricted with some cloth; and then rub the place with a rough cloth or evaporate the area with warm water until the artery appears to you manifestly. And then you take the spatula of which this is the form: And then you carefully scrape the skin with that [spatula] until you reach the artery; and then put in it [the artery] ointment and extract it from the superficial parts until you extract it from the skin and uncover it from the tunics which are beneath it, from every part.
But if the artery is small, then wrap it with the end of the oncii [a surgical instrument], and then cut a part of it according to the amount by which its ends are lengthened and constricted, and there will be no flow of blood, for if they are not incised the blood will not rise at all.
And then evacuate from one to three ounces of blood.
And if the artery is large, then it is necessary that you tie it in two places with strong double silk thread or with cords at a distance, and do not allow it to putrefy before the consolidation of the wound and a flow of blood occurs.
And then incise the excess which is between the two ligatures; and do this at that time or at another time.
And if you wish, cauterize it with a cautery to the bone with a knife-shaped cautery until its ends are incised, and it will be in place of that same operation.
And it is a better procedure unless the patient has a fever or is of a hot complexion; because cautery is one of those things that helps drying humors, and therefore it is better in youth.
And it is necessary after the extraction of the arteries that you cleanse the place with old linen, and that powders are decently applied, and then it should be treated with dry medicines causing the flesh to grow and with bandages until it is healed.
And if, while you operate another time, a flow of blood from the artery occurs, then you must take care to stop that blood, either with a cautery, or by filling the place with linen, and press with your hand until the bleeding is stopped. And if none of those things are at hand, then place your finger on the place until the blood is congealed, and bathe the place with very cold water until the sharpness subsides, and it is tightened as necessary.
And what is lighter in the extraction of an artery is that you cauterize the vein with this cautery having two blades, after you have marked the two places with a probe, and place each one, very hot, until they reach the bone and sever the vein in two places, so that what is between its extremities is lengthened, because it is not completely consolidated with this cautery.
And this is the form of the cautery:
And let the sharpness of the two blades be equal. However, if there is less sharpness than two knives it is better, because if they are sharp like two knives, it approaches each cold, and does not cut the flesh quickly.
Therefore, since in those there is some thickness, the heat of the fire is held in them and the flesh is severed lightly.
And this method is better in every way and more gentle.
And let the space which is between the two knives be the amount of the thickness of a finger.
Chapter four.
Chapter Four: On the treatment of sharp and acrid watery eyes.
When there are acrid tears, and it is the flow from those veins which are on the head's surface, and you find no cause for it in the medicinal treatment, and you see the patient's face redden, and feel in their forehead a crawling as if of ants, and their eyes are strained, humid, so that the hairs around them are stuck together, and their eyelids are swollen by the acridity of the tears, the ancients had much skill in treating this, and they would treat this with a sponge.
And you should command the patient to shave the hairs which are on their forehead, and then incise three fissures in the forehead, equally distant according to the length of the forehead. And if the length of the fissure is two fingers: one fissure should be equidistant from the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, and the second according to the length, a little from the movement of the muscles which are in the tear duct, and the third on the other side.
And beware of incising the arteries which are on both sides, and keep your hand away from the continuation of both jaws. And if the space of each incision is the quantity of three fingers, adjust it.
And if you have a piece of prepared sponge or dried cloths, use them to dry the blood.
And then insert a spatula with two sharp ends, of which this is the form of its incision: which is from the part of the temples to the second incision. Excoriate with that [tool/spatula] the entire area which is between the two incisions, with the cyphus which is on the bone, and then do this from the middle incision to the second incision. And then remove that spatula and insert into the first incision again another instrument which is called a curette, sharp on one side and not sharp on the other.
And place the sharp edge of that [curette] against the flesh attached to the bone, and its blunt edge inside the bone, and push it until it reaches the middle fissure, and cut with it all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes.
But let the incision be continued to that part of the bone, and then do this in the middle fissure to the other fissure.
And after a quantity of blood has flowed, press the places of the congealed blood clots.
And then place in each fissure a piece of old linen, and put on those powders soaked in wine and oil and vinegar, and see that a hot abscess does not develop.
And on the third day untie the bandage and administer a large infusion of warm or tepid water, and then treat it with basilicon ointment with rose oil and others until the wounds are healed.
Chapter 5.
Chapter 5:  On the treatment of tears due to cataracts and those descending into the eyes from the inner parts of the head.
When someone suffers from acute and persistent cataracts, and the patient's eyes appear small and shrunken, and their vision is weakened, and the eyelids are ulcerated and their hair falls out, and there is a sharp, throbbing pain in the forehead and consequent sneezing, then know from these symptoms that the cataracts and humors come from the inner parts of the head.
And the best cure in such cases is this:  order the patient to shave their forehead, and then incise a fissure in the middle of the forehead, a small one in width (beginning the incision from the left temple to the right temple; and let the incision reach the bone; and lengthen your cut from the temples, which are sore due to chewing), until the bone is exposed.
Dry all the blood with a sponge or a dry cloth and then fill the space between the two edges of the incision with old cotton or linen cloths. And then bind it tightly with powders soaked in wine and oil, so that a hot abscess does not develop.
And when you unbind it and see that the abscess has diminished, then you should scrape the bone until new flesh begins to grow, and then treat it with a drying regimen that promotes the growth of flesh, such as taking two parts of wheat flour and four parts of colophony, mixing them together, and making a plaster from them to be applied to these wounds to encourage the growth of new flesh.
Chapter 6.
Concerning the treatment of what falls into the ears.
Every substance that falls into the ears is one of four types:  either it is a mineral stone or something similar to stone, such as iron or glass; or it is a plant, such as a grain of wheat or a bean; or it is a fluid substance, such as water or sour wine and similar things; or some kind of animal.
And so, when a stone falls into the ear, or another substance similar to those things that do not soften or grow in the ear, and you expose the ear to the sun, and if you see the stone, then instill into the ear some violet oil or sesame oil, and then proceed with its extraction, and induce sneezing with a suitable remedy, and block the nostrils before the onset of sneezing. Then place some pieces of cloth or wool around the ear, and gently pull the ear upwards, for often it is expelled by these means.
And if it is not expelled, then proceed with its extraction using the instrument called a fine ear-pick, of which this is the form:
And if it is expelled with the ear-pick, it is good; and if not, then proceed with its extraction using a thin probe of little doubling (or slight curvature).
And so, if it is not expelled by this, then make a small brass tube (cannula) and insert the end of the tube into the opening of the ear and seal around the tube with wax and softened oil so that nothing is open except the tube. Then extract it with your breath using strong suction, for often with this which we have recounted (this method) it is removed.
But if it is not expelled in this manner, then take a small amount of kindled (lit) tow or a similar material prepared for catching birds, and place that on the end of a thin rod, and then carefully wrap a suitable cotton (or similar soft material) around that. Then carefully insert that into the opening of the ear, and then dry the ear of its moisture.
And so, if it is not expelled by all the methods which we have recounted, then you should consider cutting it before it develops into a hot abscess or spasm.
And the manner of cutting it is that you first bleed the patient from the cephalic vein and extract blood according to the patient's strength, and then hold the ear between your hands and turn the ear upward, and make a small incision at the root of the ear above the cartilage, in the well-prepared area. And let the incision be crescent-shaped so that it reaches the stone; and, the stone found, remove it if you can with appropriate instruments; and then immediately close the incision quickly, and treat it until it is healed.
And if the cause residing in the ear is a growth that increases and is inflamed, then administer its treatment and extraction; but if it does not obey your treatment, then take finely powdered litharge according to this method: and apply it to the excision of that growth which has fallen into the ear.
And do not do this when you think that it is already moistened by the vapor of the ear, and apply it in small pieces, and then extract them with tweezers or with a fine instrument, or with an incision as we have said, for its extraction is thus facilitated.
But if water has entered the ear, the patient should use sneezing as a first measure, and fill the ear with some old cotton, and lie down on the ear into which the water has entered; and if it is expelled by this, it is good; and if not, then take several heated stones or pebbles, according to the length of the finger, and warm them a little in the fire, and the patient inserts one of them into the opening of the ear and jumps on one foot on that side and strikes with another stone on the stone which is inside the ear. Therefore, do not cease this with the stone until all the water is expelled.
Therefore, do not cease this with the stone until all the water is expelled. And if the water is not expelled in this way, take some paper or tow, and put one end of it in the ear and hold the other end to the fire until the majority of it is burned.
Then put in more tow and do this several times until all the water is expelled, and remove it with a cannula, as was said above of the extracting stone.
But in the extraction of an animal entering that ear, if it is small, like a fly or similar, treat it as we have said in the division; but if it is of a large size, which appears to the eye's judgment, then administer its extraction with forceps and hooks, and this cause is the easiest of all the other causes that befall the ear.
But in the extraction of a worm generated in the ear, when you treat it with what we have said in the division and in the treatise on distillations and your treatment does not work, then you must expose the ear to the sun.
And so if any cause of the worms appears, then extract it with forceps or with fine hooks; but if no cause appears, then take a cannula narrow below and wide above, of which this is the form: And introduce the thin end into the ear according to the amount the patient can tolerate; and then suck with it with strong suction, and do this many times until all the worms are expelled.
But if it does not obey you in this way, then you plug and seal the circumference of the cannula with wax as we have said; then administer distillations which the ancients have already proven in the treatment of worms, and you will find this in the treatise on distillations.
And let your effusion, with which you pour the medicinal oils into the ear, be with this instrument, of which this is the form: And make it of silver or bronze, narrow below, in which there is a small hole, and flat above.
And then let it be such that it pushes what is in the cavity of the cannula continuously where it will be necessary. And if you wish, take a ray (possibly referring to a thin, flexible instrument) and wrap its extremity decently with cotton, and then pour oil into the cavity of the ear, or the juice of some herb, or whatever you wish of these medicines into the cannula — and that is in the ear — and then insert the ray with the cotton on top and press with your hand with moderate compression until the oil is expelled into the cavity of the hearing and the patient feels the oil inside.
And what is poured into the ear should already be slightly warmed by fire. And be careful that what you distill into the ear is not too cold, for ear medicines do not tolerate that.
Chapter 7.
On the treatment of ear obstructions.
Sometimes children are born from their mothers' wombs without perforated ears, and this also happens in some adults, an obstruction in the ear canal due to injury or fleshy growth in it; and this obstruction sometimes occurs in the entrance of the ear canal, which prevents hearing, and sometimes in the outer parts.
And that which happens at its entrance, which prevents hearing, is in most cases of difficult healing.
And in the case where hearing is possible, you should expose the patient's ear to the sun and examine it. And then, if you see a visible obstruction, open it with a fine spatula, of which this is the form:
If its extremity is narrow, one side being sharp and the other not; and the spatula should be two fingers wide so that it does not injure the ear.
And if the obstruction is due to flesh grown in the ear or in its meatus, then remove that with fine hooks and incise it vigorously until all the flesh is removed.
And if the obstruction is in the anterior part of the ear, then take a thin, fine rod and heat it slightly with fire, and then place it in the ear canal.
And then, if you have felt an obstruction with which the patient experiences difficulty, due to the severity of hearing, force the obstruction out gently; and be careful not to injure the nerves of the ear.
Then place in the ear a piece of linen, according to the size of the opening, which you have wrapped in Egyptian ointment; and do this for several days until you are sure of the healing of the wound; or take a wick and soak it in warm water, and then crush and apply it; and if you see that the ear is already abscessed, then you must remove the wick and replace it with another wick which you will wrap in a cerate made with rose oil, until the abscess is reduced; and then treat it until it is healed.
But if bleeding occurs, then submerge a sponge or cloth in cold water and apply it to the ear, and use the other treatment which stops the bleeding, which is described in the treatise on distillation.
Chapter 8.
Concerning the treatment of a stye which occurs on the eyelids.
Styes which occur on the eyelids of the eyes are sometimes moist, sometimes dry.
Therefore it is necessary that you hold them with forceps or with an oncia, and incise them with a spatula from their roots, and then apply a poultice to the area.
But if pain with bleeding occurs, then cauterize them with a thin lenticular cautery.
And the best cauterization is near the incisions, and often they return when some cause remains from their roots; and when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned and do not return.
Chapter 9.
Treatment of swelling that comes to the eyelids of the eyes.
Often there develops in the eyelids of the eyes a certain condition which resembles swelling in its firmness and hardness, and because of its size it is called swelling.
And it is an accumulation of thick humidity in the eyelid, below and above.
Therefore, the operation on them is that you consider then if the swelling is proceeding in him, appearing from the eyelid and is spread to every part; and its cause is light.
Then make an incision on it lengthwise, and then peel it off completely easily until it is removed, and then suspend it with hooks and excise it.
And if the lesion is large, then you should close it with sutures; and treat it until it is healed.
And if it is small, you will suffer no harm from it because the ointment will restore and heal it.
And if the growth is leaning towards the inner parts of the eyelid beyond the inner surface, then evert the eyelid and suspend the growth with hooks,  before you make any incision, and press it from all sides, and if the eyelid is lengthened by the incision, this harms nothing.
Then, after the incision, wash the eye with salt water; and treat the area with a healing agent until it is healed.
Chapter 10.
Concerning the treatment of a growth on the upper eyelid.
A growth (or a tumor, depending on the specific meaning of "axcirnath") is a gray mass which is generated in the membranes of the upper eyelid, and mostly in children.  It aggravates their eyes and causes a great deal of pain, so that they cannot look at the brightness of the sun because tears are constantly produced.
And therefore you see them lying on their faces all the time, and sleeping on their faces; and their lower eyelids, beneath their eyebrows, are moist, already showing swelling, and the appearance of a growth is imminent in the eye; and when you press the area with your fingers, you feel the growth within.
And a certain method of operation is this: the patient places his head in your lap, and you place a cloth beneath him and make him comfortable, and make a circle of appropriate size to encompass the entire growth.  Then place that circle over the growth and press with your fingers all around so that the growth is brought into the middle of the circle.  Then, make an incision into the middle of the moisture with a sharp instrument, making a slit; and the slit should not be larger than the incision made in bloodletting (phlebotomy).
But in the beginning, it is necessary that you completely cut through the skin until you reach the growth, because in most cases the growth is incised to reveal a white, fatty substance.
Then extract it with cloths which you have wrapped around your fingers at the edges, and roll it between your right and left hand until it is completely removed.
And be careful not to push too deeply into the incision, so that with the instrument you do not reach the eye and injure it.
But if the growth does not appear at the beginning of the incision, then gently probe a little further into the incision until the growth is reached; and then extract it as we have said; and then soak cloths in wine and vinegar, and apply them to the area, and compress it with powders.
And some crush salt and place it in the cavity of the incision so that it draws out any remaining moisture.
And then care for it until it is healed.
But if a hot abscess occurs at the site, then treat it with soothing plasters until it is healed.
Chapter 11.
Concerning the various ways of touching the eye.
When in the eyelids of the eyes there are growths beneath the natural hairs and they are inflamed, then these harm the eye and cause various diseases, such as constant tears and softening of the eyelids and membranes, until this becomes the cause of the destruction of the eye, which is called touching the eye (tactinir del huel).  And it is treated in four ways: either by cautery with fire; or with acute medicine as previously stated in the chapter on cautery; or the touch is made by incision and suture; or by cannulas, as I shall explain.
Therefore, you should place the patient's head on your lap; then turn the eyelid of the eye with your left hand. If it is turned, good; but if not, insert a needle into the part where the matter is below the eyelid, and push the needle upwards through the matter — near the edge of the eyelid where the hairs grow — near the hairs, and pull the matter upwards with the eyelid, and turn it back with the ray (presumably a surgical instrument).
Then make an incision in the inner part of the eyelid beneath the inflamed hairs, with a small sharp instrument, from the larger lacrimal duct to the smaller; then extract the matter and place small pieces of cotton or cloth under the eyelid; and then sew it up over the eyelid with thread, and let it be like the shape of a myrtle leaf.
However, the shape should be according to the amount of elevation of the eyelid, for this varies in people, because some need a large incision of the eyelid according to the extent to which the eyelid is softened.
Then make (an incision) with the small sharp instrument along the two lines which you have sewn, beginning from the larger lacrimal duct to the smaller lacrimal duct. And if your incision is near the natural hairs, let it be about the thickness of a king's (presumably a royal finger or some other royal measure of thickness).
Then place the hook in one of the two corners of the wound, and then scrape it all, and then join the two lips of the wound with glue or fine wool thread, and wipe away the blood, and stick what superfluously protrudes from the threads to two eyebrows with some sticky substance, if you wish to do so; and if not, do not worry.
Then leave the suture of the threads for three or four days, and then treat it.
And if you wish, leave the wound without suture, and treat it with something that dries and constricts, because the eyelid is raised due to the sealing of the wound and its aggregation; but suture is better.  Therefore, the ancients advised this.
However, let there be diligence concerning the patient, and it is a good operation, and let there be no fear.
And there is another way to treat it, which is to mark on the eyelid a figure like a myrtle leaf, and then raise the eyelid with three hooks arranged and joined according to this form:
But if this is not possible, to hold the hooks, and this is not equal, then take a needle which has thread and place it in the middle of the figure, and insert the other thread near the larger tear duct, and the second thread near the smaller tear duct, and adjust the threads between your fingers equally, and then with those, lift your hand with equal elevation, raising the entire area which is marked as we have described.
And then join the two lips of the wound with a suture, and treat it until it is healed.
But if an abscess occurs near your incision or fissure, treat that abscess with a plaster and similar things, and with ointment.
And sometimes it happens to the eyelid that its hairs are inverted; then it is necessary that you use on it that which we have said of incision; but suture in each case is more skillful.
To stop bleeding with canes is according to this method: and it is that you turn back the eyelid and cut the growth that is inside as I have recounted; and then skillfully make two thin canes or splinters whose length is according to the length of the eyelid and whose width is less than the width of the space. And you have already incised at the extremities of each part, where you have the threads.
Then carefully add each [cane] subtly over what is superfluous of the eyelid's skin, and bind the canes to each part with a firm ligature, and leave it for some days, for the growth, by the constriction, will die and dry up and will rot until it falls off by itself.
But if it is delayed, then break it off with forceps, and then care for the wound until it is healed.
Then, once it is solidified, the eyelid is raised and the hairs do not prick.
And this is the form of the two canes which you will make according to this form: and have the quantity of length and width neither more nor less.
Chapter 12.
Chapter 12. Of the elevation of stinging hairs in the eye with a needle when the hair is hard.
When unnatural, hard, rough, and stinging hairs are in the eyes, then the operation is that you take a subtle needle and place on it a subtle silk and lion thread, and then you adjust its ends, knotting each in a very subtle manner. And let the length of the threads be the quantity of a palm (handspan).
And then you prepare two other subtle threads underneath it briefly, and tie their ends if you wish.
And then have the patient put their head in your lap, and be near the sun so that your work is illuminated, for it is a subtle and delicate operation.
And then insert the needle into the root of the offending hair, which needs to be extracted, and make it penetrate the eyelid swiftly until you extract it above the natural hair.
And then pull the hair upwards and insert it into a solution, and let the hairs be one or two or three and no more.
And then pull your hand with that until the hair is removed with the solution from the eyelid along with the natural hair.
But if the solution is pulled and the hair is not removed, you will pull the solution to the lower parts with the thread which you have composed with it, until the solution is removed from the upper opening.
And observe that with the vision of the eye, for then you will remove the solution and the thread, and gently cleanse and close the eye, and leave it closed for two or three days, until the hair adheres to its place and good flesh grows over it.
And if the hair is too short, then you attach a long hair from the natural hairs, and it is elevated with that, or you leave it until it is lengthened by some space, and then you elevate it.
Chapter 13.
Of the treatment of  [a condition, likely a stye or similar growth] which appears on the upper eyelid.
When a [condition, likely a stye or similar growth] appears in the eye, and it is a contraction of the eyelid when it is contracted upwards, or to the right or left side, due to poor healing of a wound, incision, or cautery, and it is called harelip [likely referring to a similar type of eyelid malformation], and this [condition] is either natural or accidental, and is caused by the healing of a wound, incision, or cautery, or by something similar that has been poorly treated.
The manner of the operation is that you incise that adhesion and separate its lips, and place between them a small piece of linen cloth, and bind them until they are healed.
And it is not fitting that you use treatments that dry or constrict; for if you do this, the [condition] will return worse than it was before.
Use on it things that soften, such as fenugreek, and apply with water in which mallow and its seeds are boiled, or diachylon ointment, which should be liquefied with some oil, and immerse the cloth in it, and treat with that.
And the treasure of your treatment is that you should prevent, by all means, consolidation from occurring in a manner different from its original state.
And this operation which we have described is nothing but a rectification of the [condition] so that it does not return to a state different from its original form.
Chapter 14.
Concerning the treatment of [a condition, likely a swelling or inflammation] which occurs in the lower eyelid.
This swelling which occurs in the lower eyelid, which is truly called a swelling; and it is of [two] kinds, some natural, others accidental.
But accidental [swellings] are caused by a wound, or by a cut, or by cautery, or by other similar things.
And the method of its operation is that you take a needle with double thread, and place that in the flesh, and make it pass from the left lachrymal duct to the right lachrymal duct, until the thread reaches the two extremities of the flesh.
Then extend the flesh upwards with the needle and sew it with the needle, and incise it with a wide spatula. And then if the shape of the eyelid returns as it should be, it is good; and if not, take a splint and place it in the cleft, and with that splint reshape the eyelid, and sew the two fissures at the edge of the lower eyelid.
And let the extremities of the two fissures be at two angles of the incision which you have made so that they meet, and let an angle be made of them so that when they come together a figure is formed from them.
And this figure is a Greek letter: lambda.
Then remove the flesh from that side to the extent that the lower edge of the wound is acute, so that it may be the eyelid.
Then join the separated parts and sew them with wool thread; and then treat them with what we have said of softening medicines and poultices until it is healed.
And if it is excoriated because of a fissure, suture, or cautery, then it is necessary that you make a flat incision on the skin of the eyelid according to what has been previously described. Then separate [the wound] with a poultice between two lips, as we have said.
In summary, of the treatment of excoriation, whether above or below, the operation proceeds as it is prepared according to the form of the excoriation, and this is in the form of many variations.
And the skillful artisan always prepares the tools in every way possible for him so that he may restore the shape to its natural form, or close to it, and the patient according to what suits him for the operation and instruments in the best circumstances/disposition.
Chapter 15.
Of the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or to the cornea.
When this consolidation happens to many men such that the upper eyelid is solidified with the white of the eye, and the ease of movement and its natural functions are impeded, then it is necessary that you insert the tip of a probe under the eyelid, and lift it up, or spread it with an unguent.
And then you incise the adhesion with a fine spatula, which should not be sharp in its incision, being rather blunt so that the patient is not disturbed by the operation, and move the spatula so that it does not injure the eye with its sharpness.
And let your incision be such that it separates that adhesion easily until the eyelid is returned to its natural form and the whole adhesion is healed.
And then you put salt water in the eye with which you wash it; or distill into it some honey dissolved in water.
And then separate the eyelid from the eye with a small piece of linen, and place on the eye wool soaked in egg white, and then on the third day use consolidative remedies until it is healed.
Chapter 16.
Concerning the incision of the nail and the fleshy eminence of the tear ducts.
Know that a nail is of two types, for it is either nervous, and resembles hard, thin parchment; or it is non-nervous, resembling a congealed white humidity, which when an iron touches it, or is forced to be taken with tweezers, is severed and the tweezers do not penetrate it.
And both types do not begin except from the greater lacrimal gland, until it grows little by little, covering the vision and prohibiting light and eye movement.
But the manner of operating in its incision is that the patient places his head on your lap, and then you open his eyes, and lift the eyelid with your hand, and then grasp the nail with small, double-ended tweezers and extend it toward the upper parts. Then take a needle and insert into it a horsehair, or oxhair, or cowhair, or something similar, or strong thread, or double the tip of the needle little by little and place it in the middle of the nail, and penetrate it with the needle, and tie the nail with thread; and extend it towards the upper parts, and scrape with the hair the edge of the nail which covers the pupil. And thus you follow it with the hair to its back (or root/origin).
And then you incise the remainder at the root of the lacrimal duct with a fine spatula or with small scissors, and leave the natural flesh of the lacrimal gland so that continuous tear flow does not result from the incision of it.
And sometimes the nail, with only tweezers extended or with thread, as we have said, and then it should be scraped with a lion's spatula, of which this is the form:
And be careful that with the spatula you do not touch the cornea and that a rupture occurs in it, and that the pupil is perforated.
Then, into the incision, put a little crushed salt or a powder made of cyani (or possibly a plant similar in name and effect), and leave it there until the next day; and then treat it with what is appropriate until it is healed.
And if the nail is not inflamed and you cannot insert the needle, nor is it embedded in it with tweezers, then often this type of nail is cured with medicines, and is healed as I have recounted in the division (section/chapter).
And if you wish to incise it, then you open the sore of the patient and take a thin lion's spatula of sharp steel, according to this form: with subtlety/precision. And if you see that it is rarefied and is shrinking and becoming embedded in the root, then distill from your alembic onto the sore a powder made of cyani (or a similar plant) or with rue powder or with crushed salt, and cover the sore until the next day.
And then repeat the operation on it until all that is in it is removed, unless on the contrary a hot abscess forms in the wound, for then you leave that, and treat the abscess first until it is healed.
And then repeat your operation on it with reason until it is healed.
And the prominence of the lachrymal flesh, if it is noticeable in the wound to a great extent, should be suspended with hooks; and incise it in part, and do not prolong the incision so that you do not cut the flow of tears.
And then distill onto the lachrymal duct rue and cyani powder until it is healed.
Chapter 17.
Of the incision of a felon and of that which is born of flesh attached in the wound.
Sometimes in the eyes of some, red flesh is born and is super-imposed until it covers the pupil, or approaches or tightens on the eyelids, and quickly compresses the eyelids to the outside parts, and is similar to the rose of a balustrade.
But the operation in this case is that the patient rests his head on your lap; and then open the eyes of that one and collect all that flesh with forceps convenient for this, and hold that with a forceps or with scissors; and then incise the flesh at the beginning until all is finished with the lancet, and be careful of the eye that you do not injure it during your operation.
And let your incision, with which you incise those, be with a spatula which we have recommended in the incision of the nail, or with small scissors with which the hair is collected, according to the form that will come to you for this chapter.
Then, when your incision is complete and all that flesh is removed, then fill the eye with crushed salt, or distill into it a red powder similar to that of corrosive medicines, and place a cotton compress over the outside of the eye with egg white until it is secured from a hot abscess.
And if some cause of inflammation remains and hot blood is discharged, and you fear a hot abscess, then leave the eye and cure that abscess with what relieves that abscess, and then operate on it again until it is healed, and similarly do in the attached flesh which happens in the eye of this kind.
But however, you should avoid any treatment of the weak eye by natural or accidental means, working with iron, and do not put your hand to any of these operations until you see that the member is enduring that operation.
Chapter 18.
Concerning the collection of pus in the eye.
Pus is thick, red veins which are stubborn on the eye and prevent its treatment, and they weaken the eye over a long period of days.
Therefore, it is necessary at the beginning that you consider if the eye in which there is pus is strong and there is no other disease in it other than pus; then you should collect that pus.
And it is that you instruct the patient to place his head in your lap, and then suspend those veins with an ounce or two, according to your judgment; and let that ounce be of subtle, doubled fabric, according to this form:
or two ounces, gradually, in one piece according to this form:
And then let those veins be collected with fine forceps, with subtlety, and wipe away the blood little by little, until you see those veins are removed from the eye and are retracted.
And be careful that you do not injure the eye with the ends of the spatula; and if your operation is in the midday before the sun, and you are very firm in your operation, that you incise only those veins.
And when you have completed [the procedure], then you distil into the eye verdigris or alum so that with its sharpness it corrodes what remains of the hair.
But if this is not possible for you, collect everything at that time, and then you plaster everything with something that relieves his pain, and leave it for a few days until his pain is soothed and the risk of a hot abscess is secured [i.e., avoided].
And then repeat on him according to the same manner until he is healed.
And this is the form of the forceps:
Chapter 19.
Concerning the reduction of a nasal fracture.
When you treat a fracture with cautery or with a sharp, burning medicine, as is described previously, and it is not healed, then there is no pus in it, but rather fissures on the abscess before its maturation, and you must extract all the moisture that is in it and the pus until the bone is uncovered.
And then, when the bone is uncovered and you see corruption or blackness in it, then you scrape it with an instrument of which this is the form:
And it is named a rasp, and it should be made of Indian iron, and its head should be round like a hazelnut, which should be pointed by filing or sharpened by subtle pointing (as is shown in the following form).
And place that [rasp] on the corrupted part of the bone, and then rotate it between your fingers, and press your hand little by little until you know that the corruption is scraped away.
And this should be done several times, and then restore the area with drying and styptic substances.
Then, if the area is consolidated and good flesh has grown there, and the body of the pus is excised and remains for forty days, and it is not renewed and is not festering and no accident befalls it, then you will know that it is healed.
And if not, then there is nothing but to reduce the fissure to the shape of the nose, and according to this manner: that is, you uncover the second bone with an iron or with a sharp medicine, and when the bone is uncovered, then you take a trephine according to this form:
Let the extremity of the iron [trephine] be triangular, and its shaft be slender and tapering to the extremity, like this.  (The "like this" refers to a likely accompanying diagram.)
Then place that [trephine] on the bone, and let it be near the lachrymal bone; and extend your hand a little from the eye, and then rotate your hand with the trephine until it penetrates the whole bone, and the patient will feel it because they will feel air escaping when you hold your hand.
Then restore the area with styptic and drying medicines, as has been taught to you.
Then, when the flesh grows and the area hardens, the matter which flowed to the outer parts returns to the nose; therefore this is easier on the patient.
Chapter 20.
Concerning the reduction of the protrusion of the eye.
When the eye protrudes entirely and is not injured by a wound or diminution, then you should leave the patient, and afterward follow him, and afterward apply cupping glasses to the neck without scarification and suction for good suction; and afterward place on the eye a liniment which is made of acacia, aloe, enses [likely a misspelling or variant of a herb, perhaps *ensifolia* or similar], and sarcocolla, and afterward fasten the plaster over the eye with much powder.
And the manner of the powders is that you take many linen cloths, and each cloth should be folded into four layers; and make [a poultice] of these.
And afterward place these one upon another according to the amount that the eye needs. And afterward bind over these with a firm cloth with a strong binding; and repeat the cupping with suction without scarification; and afterward remove the cupping glasses and leave the eye bound day and night.
But if meanwhile the ligament is softened, then it should be very tightly bound.
And afterward remove the binding during the day and night, as we have said.
And if at times the eye is already reduced, it is good; and if not, then repeat the plaster with the powders and the binding and the cupping until it is healed.
Chapter 21.
Of the incision of the eminence of the uvea tunic.  (Note: "uvea tunic" refers to the uvea, the pigmented layer of the eye.)
When there is a rupture in the uvea tunic, and it is prominent and protrudes beyond the eyelids like a grape, and the person's form is marred by it, and you want to incise it, then the operation is as we have recounted, that you insert the needle into the root of the uvea from below to above, and then place another needle with double thread on the side of the lacrimal duct, and make that penetrate and leave the first needle according to its position; and then incise the place with the double thread and lift with it the part of the uvea around the needle, and tighten that tightly.
And then remove the needle and place on the eye wool infused in egg white and allow the thread with the uvea to remain.
And then treat the eye with something that will comfort it until the wound is healed.
And sometimes collect from all sides with a circular cloth around the eye a large prominent swelling, and then pierce it with a fine spatula that reaches the pupil of the eye, and run the albuginea humor, and the eye descends and enters immediately. (Note:  "albuginea humor" likely refers to a type of fluid or aqueous humor in the eye).
And then tighten it until it is healed.
Chapter 22.
On the treatment of alconati. (Note: "Alconati" is likely a now-obsolete or regionally specific term.  It might refer to a specific disease or condition, perhaps a type of eye inflammation or injury.)
This illness that is called alconati is nothing but a swelling which is located in the eye, similar to descending water, but it is not that. (The phrasing suggests a distinction between the "alconati" swelling and a simple watery discharge or inflammation).
But the way to work on it is to make the patient sit on a prepared and straight chair, and then take his head in your hands on both sides and massage it until you see the swelling descend to the lower parts, and then it should be dried so that it does not descend, and light should be blocked, and the patient should see things as he used to.
And if it does not descend downwards, know that it is water. (Referring to the fluid in the eye; if it doesn't move downward it's simple fluid, not the specific condition "alconati".)
But if the descent of the swelling is not prepared with what we have said, then make the patient sit between your hands and then take a fine spatula and with it, on the pannicle, gently scrape below the continuation of the conjunctiva with the corneal tunic in the corona (towards the empty space), until the swelling is expelled. (This describes a more invasive procedure using a small, fine instrument to remove the swelling.)
Then, when it is expelled, you instill warm water into the eye in which you have mixed honey or water in which you have already boiled fenugreek and honey.
And then it should be treated with the other remedies until it is healed.
Chapter 22.
On the treatment of the water descending from the eye (referring to an eye infection or discharge).
We have already discussed the types of eye discharge in the division and which ones should be perforated, declaring this according to the health (of the patient).
Then you should make the patient sit between your hands on a chair and bind their healthy eye, very tightly.
And then place your left hand near the eyelid of their eye, if the eye with the discharge is the left eye; or with your right hand, if the eye is the right one.
And then with your right hand take an almond, if the eye is the left one; or with your left hand, if the eye is the right one.
And then place the tip of the almond near the cornea, along the thickness of the iris in the white of the eye, on the side of the smaller lachrymal duct, and then press the almond gently and roll your hand with it.
And then penetrate the white of the eye and feel that the almond has reached the empty space (or cavity).
And it should be that the distance of the almond to the pupil is the measure of the space which is from the pupil to the edge of the blackness (iris), and that is the cornea of the eye; for you will see with that pupil through the vision of the eye by the clarity of the corneal tunic.
And then place the almond into the place where the water (fluid) is, and then you draw it down one time then another, and then if the water descends immediately, then the patient sees that upon which he focused his vision immediately, and the almond in his eye.
And then rest a little; then if the water has descended, then you remove it another time before the almond is thrown out (or expelled).
And then when it is dried and does not descend, then you extract the almond with ease, and gently roll it with your hand, and then dissolve a little clear rock salt in the water and with that wash the eye inside; and then place on the outside of the eye cotton or tow or wool infused in rose oil and egg white and bind the eye with it.
But we and those of our time place on that a compress soaked in egg white.
And if the almond does not obey you upon entering the eye because of its hardness—for there are some men whose eyes are very hard—then it is necessary that you take the herb which is named *alberid* (likely a misspelling or dialectal variation of a plant name), of which this is the form:
Then pierce that joint with it, and do not linger with your hand in the hole, but only make a subtle passage for the almond.
And then introduce the almond as we have said.
And for the completion of your work, let the patient be prepared a darkened, quiet sleeping place where he sleeps on his back, and let all movement be forbidden.
And place him in such a position that his body is aligned, and he does not turn his head to the right or left at all.
And let the healing be according to its disposition within three days.
And then release him from that dark room and expose him to a gentle view, and show him some things, and then return to the treatment within seven days.
And it is not fitting that you do this at the hour of treatments or immediately after an infusion. Having said that, you must avoid this because the water may lightly, greatly and vehemently,  [cause damage/have an effect - the meaning of "reguardament" is unclear without more context, it may also refer to a specific medical procedure].
But if a hot abscess occurs, then you must open the wound before the seventh day and treat it with something that reduces the abscess.
Then you cover his eyes and place a cloth over his face, by which his vision will be regulated for some days, while he remains in the dark room.
And then let him be moved from that room gradually and converse on pleasant matters.
And know that in the case of a cataract, the pupil is not excused from some vision at times, and then you should be bold about the operation.
And it has come to us from some of those who are in Artach, and some say that they make fire in Ayrac, a perforated place through which water is drawn.
However, I have not seen anyone in our land who has perfected this, nor have I read about it in any of the books of the ancients; and it is possible that this is novel.
And these are the forms of the types of wound, so that he who is ignorant of them may know them:
And let them be made of bronze or iron properly, and let their ends be made with this triangular subtlety, the sharp end thus, as that is the form.
Chapter 24.
On the treatment of raw flesh in the nose.
When various fleshy growths are produced in the nose, some of which are similar to a very small scorpion, or to a polyp fish; and this illness is called polyp because it resembles that fish in appearance. And from it is cancerous flesh,  scaly, of dark color; and from it is that which is lion flesh, not of dark color.
Therefore, in that which is lion flesh, neither malignant nor cancerous, you should make the patient sit between your hands and place him in the sun, and open his nostrils, and apply your unguent to those growths. Then extract that to the outside parts, and then cut away what you have grasped of those with a sharp, thin spatula from one side until you know that all the flesh is removed; if any part remains from which excision is possible, then scrape it with one of the fine instruments easily until nothing remains of it. But if it bleeds profusely or a hot, malignant abscess forms, then apply what is necessary; or if it is one of the malignant abscesses, then you should incise and cauterize it until the bleeding is stopped and all the cavities are removed.
Then let there be poured into the nose near the incision, strong wine and water or wine. But if the nose is open and no moisture proceeds from it to the palate, then know that it is healed.
But if the moisture does not penetrate as it should, then you know that inside there is rotten flesh in the upper bones of the nose to which excision has not reached.
Therefore, it is necessary to introduce a linen thread into it, to which some thickness is attached, and tie many knots on it, and place between each knot the quantity of a finger or less, and instruct the patient and introduce one end of the thread into the nostrils with a rod or with another means which is possible for him.
And when this is done, let him draw in its odor until it reaches the nasal canals, and it will be expelled through the throat, for many times children do similar things in schools, and it is an easy thing for anyone who wants to do it.
Then place the two ends of the thread, one end coming out of the nose and the other remaining in the nose, and then administer a sawdust of meat with the knots that are on the thread, and do this until you know that the flesh is now with the knots of the thread.
And then remove the thread, and apply to the nose near the extraction of the blood a poultice, and do this for three days or more until the ointment corrodes all that is rotten in the flesh.
And finally, at the end of the treatment, place a lead cannula in the nose for several days until it is healed.
But if you need a more intense cure, use that one.
And this is the form of the instrument, a head-purger, with which oils and medicines are distilled into the nostrils:
And make this of silver or brass, which should resemble a small open lamp, like a small bowl, and the spout similarly.
And if you wish, make a closed cannula like a tube, and the cannula of the head-purging instrument should be flat and open;  it should have a handle at the back, with which you hold it when you heat the oil or whatever you want of the juices and suctible substances in it.
Chapter 25.
Of boils appearing in the extremities of the nose.
Many times a boil is born in the extremities of the nose, and it is magnified and increased in some days, until it is very easily seen.
And for that it is necessary that you incise it at the beginning of its appearance, and eradicate all of it. And then place on the spot either a cautery or a burning medicine which will stay in place.
But if its incision is delayed until it is magnified, then consider if it is hardened,  hard, of a dark color and of little feeling; then do not touch it with iron, for it is a cancerous abscess; for many times he who incises this abscess suffers great harm from it, from the one who had it.
And if the abscess is of a light touch and is not of a dark color, and times when incision is possible in all of it, then evacuate the patient and incise it without fear, and cure the place with that which exudes and compresses until it is healed.
Chapter 26.
Of the suturing of the nose and of the lips and of the ear when the continuity is broken by a wound or the like.
Know that when there occurs a solution of continuity in one of these cartilages, you will have little success in that operation except in certain men.
Therefore it is necessary, when such a thing happens to someone, that you consider if it is a fresh wound with its blood, and then you join the two lips of the wound with suture, and then cure it until it is healed.
And if the lips of the solution of continuity are already separated, and each is healed, then it is necessary that you scrape each part of their apparent skin until blood comes out. And then join the two lips with suture and tighten them, and over them sprinkle dragon's blood and finely ground incense, and place over the powder a piece of diachylon plaster, or of some other of the consolidating plasters, and leave it bound for two or three days, and then unbind it and change that plaster and leave it until the stitches by themselves are removed, and then cure with ointment until it is healed.
But the manner of the suture is that you join the solution of continuity either with needles as we have recounted in the suture of the abdomen, or join the solution of continuity with thread as has been shown to you.
Chapter 27.
Of the extraction of those things that come into the two lips in the inner parts.
Many times there happen to many men in the inner parts of their lips certain hard abscesses resembling the fat of a pig, and some of them are smaller and some are larger.
Therefore it is necessary that you turn back the lips and split each of those hardnesses on all sides, and then, having made the excision, fill the place with crushed sage until the blood is restrained, and then it should be washed with sharp wine and the place treated with something styptic, until it is healed.
Chapter 28.
Of the incision of the flesh grown in the gums.
Very often there grows upon the gum an excrescence of flesh which the ancients called an albulus; then it is necessary that you suspend that with a hook or hold it with forceps and incise it below its root, and allow the pus or blood to flow.
And then place on the area crushed sage or other styptic or drying powders.
And if that flesh returns, then incise it a second time, and cauterize it, for after cauterization it will not return.
Chapter 29.
Concerning the treatment of teeth with iron.
When on the surface of the teeth, both inside and outside, and between the gums, rough, decayed, and sometimes blackened crusts are attached, and they become yellow or green, so that the gum is affected by this corruption and the teeth become decayed.
And therefore it is necessary that you make the patient sit between your hands and rest his head on your lap, and scrape the teeth on which those crusts and similar things appear, like sand, until nothing remains of them.  And do this to remove the blackness, yellowness, and other things until they are cleansed.
If this, which is the beginning of the treatment, has been achieved, it is good; and if not, then you repeat the treatment on those teeth on the following day, and the second, and the third, until you achieve the desired result.
And know that the teeth require many scrapers of different shapes and forms, according to what is prepared for your operation. And because the scraper with which the tooth is scraped from the inside is different from the scraper with which it is scraped between the teeth, according to other shapes, and these shapes of scrapers should be prepared by you, which you will see immediately:
Chapter 30.
On the extraction of teeth.
That you cure the tooth of its pain with all diligence and delay its extraction, for there is no cause that surpasses its sight when it is extracted, for it is a sublime substance, so that there is an excuse in its extraction.
But if the patient is forced to have that tooth extracted, you must be firmly certain which tooth is the aching one, for many times the pain deceives the patient and he thinks it is in a healthy tooth, and you extract that one, and then the pain does not cease until the diseased and aching tooth is extracted, for we have already seen this through the operations of barbers.
Therefore, when you are certain which tooth is aching, and you know it well, then you should scarify around the tooth with a spatula in which there is some virtue, until it is dissolved from the tooth and gum on all sides, and then loosen it with your fingers, or with fine forceps, little by little at first, until it is completely loosened.
And then apply strong, large forceps for a good grip or firm hold, and place the patient's head between your knees so that you hold it well and it does not move, and then extract the tooth straight, in such a way that you do not break it, nor cause the patient greater pain.
And then, if it is not dislodged, then take one of those instruments, and place it under it on all sides with ease, and force its removal in the same way as was done at the beginning.
But if the tooth is cracked or eroded, then you should fill that crack with cloth and tighten it with the end of a thin rod so that it is not broken at the time you tighten the forceps on it.
And you should open carefully with scarification around all parts of the gum and be very careful not to break it and leave a piece behind, which would return to cause the patient pain worse than the first.
And beware that you do not do what some ignorant barbers do in their haste and audacity in extraction, without administering what we have recommended; for many times they cause great illnesses in men which are more difficult to cure, and their roots remain, all or some of them, or that they extract it with some bones from the jaw, as we have witnessed many times.
And afterwards, after its extraction, the mouth should be washed with hot wine or sour wine with salt.
And if bleeding ensues from this, as often happens, then crush some quantity of alum and sprinkle it on the wound, and if the alum is not effective, cauterize it.
The shape of the forceps and fine tongs with which the tooth is grasped at the beginning should be of long, narrow, and thick handles, so that they do not bend when you work with them.
And let them be, as it were, of thick handles, so that when you squeeze with them they are not bent, [but rather] of short extremities.
And let them be made of Indian iron, skillfully made with straight ends, and at the ends of these let there be teeth, of which some interlock with others and tighten by strong constriction, and sometimes the ends of these are shaped like the beak of a bird called a *ciconia*, that is, a stork, and are of strong constriction.
Chapter 31.
Concerning the extraction of teeth and the removal of fractured jawbones.
When you must extract a tooth which, being broken, remains partially embedded, then you should place a poultice on the area for a day or two until the area is softened; and then insert forceps, the ends of which resemble the beak of a bird called a *ciconia* or stork, the shape of forceps:
Their ends should be made inwardly like a file or rasp.
And if it does not yield to you in this way with these forceps or pincers, then you should dig down to the root and expose all the flesh and insert the instrument which is called an *atali*, that is, a small lever, of which the shape is this:
And let it be of short, somewhat thick extremity, and let it not be bent, lest it be broken.
Therefore, if by this the root is extracted, it is good; and if not, help yourself with these other instruments, of which these are the forms: the form of the first instrument is of a triangular extremity, in which there should be some thickness:
The form of the second instrument is that it be triangular and of a more subtle extremity.
And you are now aided with this instrument having two prongs, of which this is the form, approximately the following: and with other instruments which precede in the extraction of teeth; for the work is easily done with this instrument which is similar to a large hook, and this is its form:
of the triangular, curved or short extremity, which should have some thickness, and should not be bent so that it is not broken.
And know also that the instruments for removing teeth are similar to the other instruments.
But the wise and subtle artisan in the art finds for himself, according to what the operation and the various illnesses signify to him; for there are illnesses for which the ancients did not describe nor provide a specific instrument, due to the variety of forms and types.
But if the bone of the jaw or of the other bones of the mouth is broken, or if it is possible, then it should be treated in its place with what is convenient from the instruments and forceps which we have mentioned in the extraction of the roots of the teeth, and help yourself with a splint of which this is the form:
And let there be some small thickness in it, and let it be tightened or held with the mouth so that it does not escape or move until the bone is completely set; and then restore the area with medicines suitable for this.
But if there is a small rottenness in the bone, then scrape away that rottenness and its blackness, and treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 32.
On the treatment of teeth that protrude above the others.
When teeth protrude beyond their natural alignment, their shape is flawed, and this is especially true for women, and particularly for venerable old women; therefore you must consider: if a tooth is next to another tooth and closure or alignment is not possible, then extract it; but if it is not connected to another tooth, then you should incise it with an instrument of the form shown here; and it is similar to a boar's tusk and should be made of Indian iron with a very sharp point.
And let your incision, with which you incise it, be made in several days because of the hardness of the tooth, and so that no other tooth is damaged.
And if the protruding tooth is suitable for filing, then file it with an Indian iron file of this shape:
And let the whole thing be of Indian iron and very smooth; and let it have very fine points, like a file with which needles are made, with which the tooth is filed little by little over many days easily, so that no other tooth is damaged or broken. Then smooth it at the end, and scrape it with some rasps.
And if it is a tooth of which a part is broken and hurts the tongue, then it is necessary that you file it until the roughness of that fracture is removed and smoothed, and is filled so that the tongue is not injured and speech is not impaired.
Chapter 33.
Of the restoration of damaged teeth with gold or silver wire.
When the front teeth are damaged by concussion and loosening due to a blow or a fall, and the patient cannot bite on what he eats, and you have treated it with styptic medicines, and your treatment has not been effective, then so that they do not fall out, they must be fastened with gold wire and not silver, because silver turns green and almost disintegrates after a few days, but gold is never altered.
And let the wire be of such thinness and thickness according to the amount that can fit between the teeth; and the method of tying is that you take the wire and pass a double length of it between two healthy teeth, and then you make two turns of the wire between two damaged teeth, or one or many, until the wire reaches a healthy tooth on the other side. And then repeat the weaving back to the point where you began, and tighten with your hand gently and skillfully until it is firm.
And let your tightening, with which you fasten the wire, be such that it does not slip from the roots of the teeth.
And then cut off the superfluous ends of the wire with forceps or scissors, and smooth those ends at each location, and bend them and hide them between the healthy tooth and the damaged tooth, so that they do not injure the tongue. And then leave it thus tightly fastened.
But if it is loosened or broken, tighten it or them with another wire in the same manner at all times.
And this is the form of the teeth and the manner of the binding of two healthy teeth and two damaged teeth, as you see them thus bound:
And when it is done that one or two teeth return to the position of each in their places, and are grown back as we have recounted, and that they remain fixed.
And this is only done by skilled and wise artisans.
And sometimes a certain remedy is prepared from cow bones, and it is made from them in the form of a tooth, and it is placed in the place where the tooth is missing, and it is secured as we have said, and it remains and serves in that place for a long time.
Chapter 34.
Concerning the incision of the ligament which occurs in the tongue and prohibits speech.
This ligament, which is found under the tongue, is sometimes natural, with which one is born, or accidental and occurs due to a wound which has already healed.
And the operation on it is that you open the patient's mouth, their head being in your lap; and raise their tongue, and then incise that nerve-like ligament according to its width until the tongue is freed from its constraint.
But if in that [area] there is any hardness or knot, and this is due to the healing of a wound, then you should make an incision and divide it across its width until you have cut the ligament and the knot is dissolved.
And be careful that no fissure is made in the depth of the flesh and that you cut only the ligament and that a flow of blood does not occur.
And then wash the area of the incision with warm water or with vinegar or with cold water; and then place under the tongue linen cloths; that is to say, a cloth which the patient should keep under their tongue each night so that it does not heal together again.
But if bleeding occurs, place crushed vitriol on the area; but if the bleeding persists, then cauterize the area with a lancet-shaped cautery which is suitable for this. And then treat it with the other remedies until it is healed.
Chapter 35.
On the extraction of a ranula from under the tongue.
Sometimes an abscess similar to a small tumor occurs under the tongue, preventing the tongue from its natural function; and it is quickly enlarged until it fills the mouth.
And the operation is that you open the patient's mouth, sitting in front of the sun, and examine the abscess.
And if you see it is dark or black, hard, and the patient feels no sensation in it, then do not touch it, for it is cancer.
And if it is tending towards white, and contains moisture, then you place your finger there, and incise it with a fine spatula, and cut it completely; and if blood flows during your operation, then apply crushed vitriol to it until the bleeding is stopped.
Then return to your work until you have completely removed it, until it is washed with wine and salt; and treat it with the other appropriate treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 36.
Chapter 36.  On the extraction of an abscess from the two ears and from that which is located in the throat and other abscesses.
When a goiter develops in the throat, these are glands that have accumulated, which protrude outwards and are called "two ears," which when you treat them with what we have said in the division and it is not healed, then consider if the abscess is hard, dark in color, and with little feeling; then do not touch it with an iron instrument.
And if it is red in color and the root is thick, then do not touch it with iron because of the flow of blood; rather, let it mature, and then either you will extract it, or it will break open by itself.
And if it is white in color, soft, and its root is thin, then it is one that should be incised.
And the operation on it is that you should consider, before your operation, whether the abscess has already matured completely through rest or if it has diminished in some way; and then make the patient sit before the sun, and their head should be in your lap, and open their mouth, and the servant, taking between his hands, should press down the patient's tongue with a very fine instrument, of which this is the form:
And it should be made of silver or bronze, and be as thin as a knife.
Then, as you press the tongue with that and the abscess is shown to you, and you look at it carefully, then take tweezers and put them into the tonsil, and pull it outwards as much as you can. Furthermore, if you pull out something from the membranes, then immediately incise it with an instrument of which this is the form:
Furthermore, if you pull out something from the membranes, then immediately incise it with an instrument of which this is the form: and it is similar to forceps, however its ends are curved, so that the opening of each is opposite the other, very sharp, which should be of tempered iron.
But if this instrument is not at hand, then incise it with a spatula of which this is the form: And let it be sharp on one side, not sharp on the other.
And after you have incised one side, incise the other in the same manner, and immediately after the incision, let the patient gargle with cold water.
But if there is a flow of blood, let him gargle with a decoction of pomegranate rind or myrtle leaves and similar styptic substances until the flow of blood is restrained, and then treat it until it is healed.
And sometimes other abscesses appear in the throat besides those two mentioned above, and incise those according to what I have said about the incision of two sides equally.
And I myself once treated a woman with an abscess which had formed in her throat. This abscess was dark-colored, almost insensitive, and had already closed off her throat, so that the woman was breathing through a narrow passage. I had already forbidden her to eat or drink water, and she would have died within a day or two if she had not been treated.
And the abscess had grown so much that it had formed two openings from which pus came out.
Then I treated it using a fistula approach, and inserted a probe into one of the openings, and drew it out; a large amount of pus was drawn out.  Then I incised the area corresponding to the other opening, and then I opened her mouth, compressed her tongue, and then I placed the probe into that abscess.
And then I excised a large portion of it, and only a little blood flowed from it. Therefore, the woman's throat was completely freed, and she immediately began to drink water, and then she took food. Then I continued to incise the abscess many times over a long period, and another abscess formed in its place, which I incised until it was completely healed.
Then I burned and cauterized her throat; thus it ceased to be infected. And then I went away and did not know what God would do regarding her after I left.
Chapter 37.
On the incision of a swelling when it is abscessed.
When catarrh descends to the uvula and it is abscessed and elongated, then it is called a perpendicular swelling; and if it is thick and round in the lower part, then it is called a bubo.
But when it is treated with what we have said in the division, and your treatment is not effective, and you see that the cauterized abscess is still present and is subtle, then you must incise that which is round and aggregated; and if it is of great length, and is bloody, dark in color, or black, and there is no feeling in it, then you must attempt its incision, for in that case there is danger to the patient.
And when you see it according to the manner I have described, in its whiteness and length, you should make the patient sit and press down their tongue with an instrument which conforms to its shape, and then insert the lancet into the uvula and draw it down, and incise it with one of the two instruments which are described in the incision of the tonsils.
And you must not incise it except what is exactly at the natural limit without addition, for if you incise more, you will impair their speech.
And after the incision, use what we have recommended in the incision of the tonsils, and treat it until it is healed.
But if the patient is frightened by the incision, you should use ingenuity in cauterizing it without causing fear, and the method of cauterization is not only with sharp water (a strong caustic solution), but you should place the patient's head in your lap, and then press down their tongue with the instrument we have mentioned, and then take the water which we have mentioned in the chapter on cauterization, and apply it with a live coal, and apply it neither thickly nor thinly, and with this fill the concavity of the instrument of which this is the shape:
Let the end of it be concave, in which the medicine is placed, like the concavity of a spoon, and place the instrument with the medicine on the uvula, and let the patient lie on their side so that the saliva or mucus from their mouth runs out because of the caustic medicine, so that nothing of it descends into their throat and harms them.
And then take your hand with the medicine, and press it against the uvula for half an hour until you see it become blackened and dried by the action of the medicine.
And if you wish, take cotton and wrap it around the end of the spoon, and soak the cotton in the medicine, and insert the spoon with the cotton into a cannula from above so that the cotton adheres to that cannula, and do this as many times as it takes to achieve what you want from the cauterization of the uvula, and then leave it because it will dry and fall off after three or four days.
And if you need to reapply the medicine, reapply it, and after the cauterization, wipe the area around the uvula with cotton soaked in wine, and clean with it whatever remains around it from the medicine, and wash it with cold water, and treat the outside with an embrocation (a topical ointment or lotion), and the inside with gargles until it is healed.
And this method of treatment is safer than incision and less frightening.
Sometimes the uvula is cured with a method more subtle than cautery or incision, for it is cured with fumigation in this manner: take calamint, hyssop, origanum, rue, dried Arabic gum, chamomile, and similar herbs, and mix all these ingredients, or some of them, in a pot, and submerge them in sour wine, and boil; and the pot should be well sealed with a suitable lid, and in the middle of the lid there should be a hole, over which a concave copper instrument should be placed in this way; it may be made of silver or copper.
And insert the end [of the instrument] into the patient's mouth so that the vapor can reach the uvula through the cannula, until the uvula is sufficiently fumigated.
And then repeat this several times until it is dry, and be careful not to perform this treatment at the beginning of the development of an abscess, because it would increase the abscess too much, and you should not do this, but rather you should cauterize the abscess at its start/manifestation.
But if you do not have this instrument at hand, then take a cane and attach a chicken egg shell to the end of it, so that the patient's mouth is protected, for the eggshell prevents the vapor from burning the mouth.
And this treatment is good for health.
Chapter 38.
Concerning the extraction of thorns and that which adheres in the throat and other causes.
Many times something adheres in the throat, whether a fish bone or some other thing.
Then it is necessary that you extract that which is apparent, on which the eye falls, after you press the tongue with an instrument before the light, so that that which is in the throat may be revealed to you.
And that which does not appear and is hidden from you in the throat, you must cause the patient to vomit before the food is digested in the stomach, for very quickly the thing attached to the throat will be expelled by vomiting; or let the patient swallow a piece of turnip or lettuce root or a piece of dry bread; or take a piece of dried sea sponge, tie it firmly with a thread, and then have the patient swallow it, for when it reaches the place where the thorns are, it will extract them and they will be expelled. And also take an eel, tied with thread, and let it be inserted and quickly withdrawn; or take a leek and quickly insert it and quickly draw it out.
But if it is not expelled by those things which we have said, then use a lead instrument according to this form:
And let it be thicker than a small ray, and at its end let there be a concavity which you may easily insert into his throat.
And let him have his head raised, and be careful not to touch his throat bone, so that it may happen to him that he may push the bone or spine with it, or that the physician may do so with his hand.
But however, it is better that the patient himself insert it, because of his knowledge of the location of the attached cause, and push downwards, and pull his hand upwards with the instrument, all this according to the quantity which is prepared for him until it is expelled.
Chapter 39.
On the extraction of a leech attached to the throat.
When a leech is medicated with what we have said in the division of treatment with medicines and does not work, then consider placing it on the patient's throat in the sun, after you have compressed his tongue with the instrument which we have recommended to you.
Therefore, if you see the leech, extract it with a small hook or with gentle, appropriate movements.
And if it is not possible for you to extract it with that, then take a concave cannula and insert it into the patient's throat, and then place a glowing iron in the concavity of the cannula, and do this as many times (until the leech is dead and detaches itself from the throat), and the patient should abstain from water all day.
And then take a vial full of cold water, and open his mouth into it, and wash the mouth with it; and do not swallow anything from it and stir the water every now and then with your hand, because the leech immediately falls off when it senses the water.
But if it is not expelled by what we have recommended, then fumigate the patient with cymene or asafoetida using the instrument which we have recommended for the fumigation of the uvula.
Do this, so that it will fall out.
And another method of operation in the fumigation of this is that you take a pot in which there are burning coals and the pot is covered with a cover in the middle of which there is a hole, and the end of the instrument is placed in this hole; and then let the fumigation rise; and let the patient put his mouth to the end of the cannula, and close his mouth so that the fumigation is not expelled until you know that the fumigation has reached the leech, for the leech will immediately fall off.
And if it does not fall off, then you repeat the fumigation many times, and abstain the patient from drinking, and eating salty things and garlic, and do not drink water, and thus it is necessary that with this regimen it will be expelled.
And this is the form of the instrument with which a leech is removed from the throat when it is seen; and it is similar to forceps in appearance, except that it has some curvature: which is placed in the throat, and its end is similar to a stork's beak, which is hollow, in which there is a roughness of filing, so that, when it grasps something, it does not let go.
Chapter 40.
In which is the sum of the discourse on the appearance of abscesses and on their incision.
Abscesses are of many species, of many manners, as you will remember from their description, of each one in this book.
And they are diverse in their perforation and incision in two ways, of which one is by the species of abscesses themselves; and by what we understand of the humors.
And the second manner is according to the locations in which they occur in the body, for an abscess occurring in the head is different from an abscess occurring in the buttocks; and an abscess in a fleshy place is different from an abscess occurring in a joint; and each of them has its own judgment for operation.
And moreover, of abscesses, there are some which ought not to be perforated except near maturation of the pus in them or completion of their formation.
There are other abscesses which must be opened when they are raw and not matured according to their completion, such as abscesses that are near the joints, for when an abscess is near a joint, its being is prolonged until that which is in its circumference is digested, and very quickly the ligaments or nerves of that joint are corrupted, wherefore there is made a cause of contraction of that member; or it is an abscess near a principal member, and if you delay its perforation until it is matured, it will harm the principal member; or it is near the anus, therefore perforate that which is not matured; and it is not fitting that you perforate it raw, of uncompleted digestion, except that which is near the anus, so that its matter may not fester and be elongated to the inner parts of the anus, and a fistula be made, or that it be done at such a time that it may not heal. But it is necessary that you know the time of the perforation of the abscess, and this is when it is matured.
And know that it is matured when there is a lessening of the pain and a cessation of the fever, and also a diminution of the redness and pulsation, and the acuteness of the head of the abscess, and the other signs.
And because it is necessary that you know that the perforation falls in the place lowest in the abscess and from the highest point in its healing.
And the perforation should always be along the length of the flesh or body, if the abscesses are in the parts of the hands or feet, and away from the tendons, the cords of the nerves, the arteries; and, lastly, in all even places in which there is no reflection; for in those which are reflected, use perforation according to that member.
But when the abscess is in a fleshy place, then it is better that you delay its perforation until its digestion is completed, as we have said; for if you perforate it before that, the course of the pus is prolonged and much filth remains, and quickly its lips are hardened and its depth increased.
But some abscesses are perforated according to the width of the flesh or body due to necessity, or according to what the member requires.
And it is necessary that you administer a small perforation in small abscesses, and in large abscesses a large and wide perforation, or several incisions, according to the diversity of the size of the abscesses.
And others are abscesses in which it is necessary that the skin be incised and hollowed out, when it is made like bread and is ripe, as happens in cases of swellings and buboes.
And some of these are incised with a three-angled incision; and others are incised in the shape of a myrtle leaf, like the abscesses of the armpits.
And there are those in which a round incision and a crescent-shaped incision are made, and similar ones.
But for those which are not like the aforementioned superficial abscesses, you should perforate them with only a superficial or flat perforation.
And when the abscess is large and has collected much pus, you should perforate it and do not worry about extracting all the pus at once; having extracted some of it, then dress the abscess until the next day, and then extract a larger portion, and do this many times according to the size until it is all evacuated.
And especially if the patient is of weak constitution, or a pregnant woman, or a small child, or an elderly person in a weakened state, because the vital spirit is often dissolved with the egress of the pus, and the patient dies very quickly, and you open these (abscesses).
Therefore, observe this chapter with great caution, and concerning your perforation in which you perforate these abscesses, you should cleanse the wounds and consider whether the wound of the abscess is small or a flat incision; then you apply lint or old linen; and if the abscess is large, and the fissures of the perforation are many, then you should place a wick in each opening until they join together.
And if a part of the skin is cut away in the abscess, or you have hollowed it out in the circumference, then you should fill it with old linen or thread made from linen cloth, as when you have removed splinters or roots, without moisture; and bind it tightly until the third day; and then proceed with this and treat it with the ointments necessary until it is healed.
But if bleeding occurs during your operation, then apply cold water and sour wine in which you soak a linen cloth, and apply this to the bleeding site many times.
But if the bleeding persists, then you should administer the treatment and cure and powders which I have recommended in many places in this our book and division (or section).
But if it is in winter, and the location of the abscess is a place of many nerves, then you should soak powders in hot wine and oil, and apply them to the areas.
And if it is in summer, and the areas are fleshy, then you should apply powders soaked in water and oil or in wine and oil, and all this should remain cold until the third day, as we have said, and then you should open the abscess and clean it and administer to its treatment what is suitable for it until it is healed.
And this is what is necessary for the knowledge of the treatment of abscesses universally, but according to the way of distinction I have already spoken of each abscess, in what manner is the way of its treatment, by chapters individually.
Chapter 41.
Concerning the incision of abscesses which appear in the back of the head.
In the back of the head, small abscesses are found, and these are a kind of nodes which contain tunics (membranes) which are attached to their surfaces; and the species of these are varied.
And some of them are pimple-like, and those contain a humidity similar to slime. And some of them contain a humidity similar to pus, and are similar to them; and some of them are stony, hard.
And in the incision of all of them, and in the extraction of those, there is no fear, since the extraction of these does not cause contrary effects.
And the operation in the incision of these is that you probe them with an instrument whose shape is like this, which is called a probe, until you know what it contains.
For if what it contains is humidity, then incise it lengthwise with a superficial incision according to this form:
And begin the incision from line B to line G.  Then, when the humidity is evacuated, you should scrape that skin which contained the humidity, and do not leave any of it at all, for often the problem returns if any of it remains.
And then immerse cotton in Egyptian ointment, if it is available, and if not, in salt water; and fill the wound with this and leave it there until the next day, for with this you corrode all that remains of that membrane.
And then apply the Egyptian ointment to that cotton a second and a third time if necessary, until you are confident that no part of that membrane remains; then treat the wound with ointment until it is healed.
And if the abscess contains fatty nodules, then you should incise it according to this form: with an incision in the shape of a cross, and insert forceps between the two lips of the incision and scrape it from every part, and exert your strength in extracting the membrane which contains it.
But if the suppuration opposes you, then do what I told you first.
And similarly proceed with a stony abscess in incision and treatment as we have told you; and the incision on a stony abscess is easier, for it has little blood and little moisture.
And sometimes there are some of these abscesses which are in the head in some men, in which there is no moisture at all; the reason is that I incised an abscess in the head of an old woman and found the abscess like a dull, hard, white stone, which could not be crushed, and if anyone were struck with it, it would hurt him.
But in other accidental abscesses in the head other than this, this is not the chapter, such as abscesses that occur in the heads of children and behind the roots of the ears, but the incision of all of these should be a superficial incision.
And make the perforation of those in the lowest part of them so that the body is relieved of the pus in the lower parts.
And then treat those with what is suitable for that treatment.
Chapter 42.
Chapter 42. Of the incision of scrofulas which occur in the neck.
Often these abscesses occur in the neck and in the armpits and in the groin; and sometimes they occur in other parts of the body.
And those that occur in the neck, and many that are generated among them, and every scrofula of those is within its own tunic, and just as in the nodes and abscesses of the head, as we have recounted.
And the species of these scrofulas are many, for of those some are stony, and of those some contain humidity, and of those some are malignant which do not obey cure.
Therefore, in that which you see of good disposition in the touch, of which the color that is manifest is similar to the color of the flesh, and is softened in every part, and is not attached to the nerves of the neck, nor to the veins, nor to the artery, and is not deep, it is necessary that you incise that with a superficial incision from the upper part to the lower part of the body from the line of G to the line of B, and scrape that from every part, and extend the lips of the flesh with an inch, or with many inches if you have need of those, just as we have said in the abscesses of the head, and extract that little by little.
And it is most important that the vein or nerve not be incised.
And let the scalpel not be too sharp, so that it does not injure your hand with the incision, or that it disturbs the patient, and that you incise only what is necessary to incise; for if you should incise a vein or artery and prevent your operation, then place on the wound crushed vitriol or other powders which stop the flow of blood, and bind the wound tightly, and leave it until the acuteness of the abscess is calmed and the wound is softened and begins to fester. When the blood is separated/cut off.
Then return to your operation until you have completed it.
And then investigate with your finger if there is any cause of other small scrophulas; then incise those and cleanse them.
And if there is a large vein at the root of the scrofula, then it is necessary that you do not incise that scrofula at its root. Beforehand, it is necessary that you bind it with strong doubled linen and that you leave it until it falls off by itself without harm.
Then fill the wound with old cotton which you have already submerged in Egyptian ointment, and then cure it.
And if you incise the whole scrofula, then you must adjust the two lips of the wound and stitch it as soon as there is no remaining superfluity.
But if you see that there is remaining superfluity because of the size of the scrofula, then you must understand how to incise its root, and extract it and administer suture and what is said.
And that one of the scrofulas which contains humidity, perforate it with a superficial perforation where the place of its maturation appears to you, and place the perforation so that it is the lowest part of the body, as we have said.
Then administer a perforation, perhaps with ointment and similar things, so that it corrodes what remains of the corruption. And then, when you see the wound is already cleansed, then you cure it with a flesh-generating ointment until it is healed.
Chapter 43.
Concerning the incision of the head of the abscess accidentally within the throat.
The ancients described this incision in the abscess, but no one in our land has been seen to have performed it.
And this is the writing/description of the speech of those (ancients).
But in men having a throat abscess, the extraction of the head (of the abscess) must be avoided, because it is not beneficial, since all the veins and the major ones of the patient are there.
But in those who have abscesses located in the mouth or throat or near the ears, when the illness is not in the windpipe, it is necessary to use the incision of the head (of the abscess) to avoid the loss which is caused by perforation (or suppuration).
Therefore, when we want to do this, we should incise the head of the abscess below three circles of the circles of the abscess, or four, with a small incision in width in the area between two circles, such that the incision is in the skin, not in the cartilage; and this location is suitable for incision because it is devoid of flesh and its blood vessels are far away.
And if the physician is timid, then he should extend the throat membrane with a hook, and then incise the membrane until he reaches the abscess, but he should avoid the blood vessels if he sees any.
Then incise the skin as we have recommended; and the incision of the windpipe is indicated by the inflammation which comes from it, by what is broken from it, and by the loss of voice.
And leave the wound open for some time.
Then, when the time has arrived in which perforation is feared, bring together the two edges of the wound, and sew it up alone, without the cartilage.
Then administer medicines that promote the growth of flesh until it is healed.
And Albucasis says that the sum of the discourse which we have recounted, is an exposition that shows that some of these abscesses have already blocked the throat of the patient, and the patient has come close to death, and his breath is cut off, and some go to incise the epiglottis so that the patient breathes through the site of the wound for some respiration, and is saved from death.
And for this reason I order the wound to be left open until the malignancy of the disease is consumed; and its malignancy lasts for three days; and then I order the wound to be sewn, and cure it until it is healed.
And what I have seen myself, is that a servant took a knife and put it in her throat and incised with it a part of the windpipe, and I was called to her treatment, and I found her moaning as one moans from being wounded, and I uncovered the wound and found the blood which had issued from the small wound.
Therefore, I was satisfied that she had not incised a vein or artery, and wind was issuing from the wound, and I treated it until it was healed.
And the servant suffered nothing but hoarseness in her voice, and after a few days she returned to better health.
And now I say that in the section of the tonsil there is no fear.
Chapter 44.
Concerning an incision on an abscess which occurs in the throat externally, and is called a throat hernia.
This abscess called throat hernia is a large abscess according to the complexion of the body, and it is very common in women.
And it is of two kinds, for it is either natural or accidental.
And in the natural kind, there is no need for a cure.
And the accidental kind is of two types, of which one resembles fatty nodes, and the other type resembles an abscess which is caused by a knotting of an artery, and in this case there is danger. And one should not presume to use iron (surgery) on it except in the case of a small one. And you should probe and investigate it with your finger, and if you find it similar to a fatty node, and it is not connected to any of the veins, then you should incise it as you would the nodes, and extract it with whatever contains it from the skin and bursa; and if not, then its entire being should be examined, and then cure the place with what is necessary for healing until it is healed.
Chapter 45.
Concerning the incision of the types of nodes.
There are many types of nodes, and I have already described all their types in the division (of chapters/topics).
And it is necessary that I recount the difference between a node and an abscess, as there is doubt (about the distinction).
Therefore I say that with an abscess there is heat, fever, and vehement pain until the boiling (inflammation) of the superfluity is sedated; and putrefaction is complete, at which point the fever, pain, and heat cease.
But with a node there is neither heat nor fever nor pain, and it contains that leonine humour which is in its own sac.
And it is according to the color of the body, and its beginning is like a swelling and is made like a vesicle, whether larger or smaller, and there are two types, for they are either fatty and contain humidity, and the colors of the humidity are many, as I said in the division (of chapters/topics).
Therefore, when you arrive at the treatment of a node, you must express that (humor) and incise it at the beginning with an instrument which is called an intromes, according to how its form will appear in the chapter which is near this one.
And the manner of incision of abscesses and of all nodes is that you take this instrument and introduce it into the most humid place which you find in the abscess, and you will revolve your fingers with this little by little until you know that the instrument has already penetrated the membrane.
And then extend your hand according to the size of the abscess, and then extract the intromes and consider what has come out in its track.
And if the flowing humidity, of whatever color it may be, is expelled, then you incise it with a superficial section as I have said in the case of other abscesses.
And if no humidity emerges from the track of the intromes, then know that it is fat (or thick/dense).
And dry it out with an incision in the shape of a cross, according to this form: Thus as I have shown you, and suspend it with hooks, and easily peel off the skin from all sides, and keep the skin or sac, if you can, over it and extract that pus with the node (knot or swelling).
But if it is broken during the operation, it is not possible to extract all the pus, and this happens many times, and then you extract it gradually until nothing remains.
Because if anything remains, little or much, the swelling will return again.
And if you see that a small part remains, then fill the wound with some sharp corrosive powders and tighten the wound, and place over it a hot poultice, and treat it with another cure until it is healed.
And if it is a large swelling, then you sew the two lips of it and treat it with that which causes it to form new flesh (granulation).
But if a pulsating vein is present, or a non-pulsating one, then you consider it and fill the place with crushed vitriol, and let it stay there for two or three days until the wound dries and the boiling of the blood subsides; and then return to incise that which remains of the swelling.
Chapter 46.
Of the forms of instruments necessary in incision and perforation.
Of these are the forms of the instruments, and there are three kinds: of these, some are large, some are medium, and some are small.
The form of the large instrument is this:
The form of the small instrument is this:
They should be made of iron, or of al-fulud (likely a type of metal or alloy), with appropriately rounded ends, so that they may easily enter the abscesses.
And these are the forms of the instruments, and they are called *albered*, and one of them is called *berid*.
And they are of three types, for of them there is a large, a medium, and a small one.
The form of the large instrument, its form:
The form of the medium instrument, its form:
The form of the small instrument, its form:
It is suitable that they be used for those abscesses and discharges and fistulas and buboes, because among those are [abscesses] from bones and other causes.
And they are made round, large, smooth, like large needles with which saddles are sewn, and they are made of electrum, or of brass, or of iron, or of silver. And the best are when they are made of electrum.
And the instruments are made of black lead, which are agreed to be used to open fistulas in the cavity of which there are reflections, so that they are reflected with their lightness to those reflections.
And they are of three types, for some of them are long, and others medium, and others short, according to the size of the width of the fistula and its stricture.
Shape of the large lead instrument:
Shape of the medium lead instrument:
Shape of the small lead instrument:
The shapes of the hooks are of many types, for some of them are simple, which have only one curve, and are of three types: large, small, and medium.
And of them there are curved hooks, and they are of three types.
And of those there are hooks having two curves, and they are of three types.
And of those there are hooks having three curves, and they are of three types.
And all these are necessary in their place.
Shape of a small simple hook, its form:
Shape of a large hook having two curves: Shape of a medium hook having two curves: Shape of a small hook having two curves:
Shape of a large hook having three curves:
Shape of a medium hook having three curves:
And these are the shapes of the scalpels with which nodes and abscesses are incised and scraped, and they are of three types, for of these there is a large, a medium, and a small one.
Shape of a large scalpel:
Shape of a medium scalpel:
Shape of a small scalpel:
The ends of those with which the incision is made are sharp, and the other ends are not sharp, and they are not placed in such a way, except that it is done carefully in the scraping of the nodes, fearing the incision of a vein or nerve, and by these the patient is healed and finds a little tranquility through the cauterization which is found after the scraping of the abscess.
And these are the shapes of the scalpels, and there are three types: large, medium, and small, as you will see.
They should be made of bronze and resemble a ray, with which the alcofol (presumably a surgical instrument or tool) is made.
And it is at the pointed end, hidden with a spatula, and in that direction, inside and outside, as you wish, so that you can see. (This likely refers to a surgical instrument with a hidden, pointed end, revealed with a spatula for surgical use.)
The shapes of spatulas, which are hidden among the fingers during the perforation of abscesses and the patient does not perceive them, are of three types: large, medium, and small. And these are the shapes of those (instruments):
The shapes of cupping glasses with which the flow of blood is stopped, and there are three types: large, medium, and small; their shapes are:
They should be made of thin, bronze or copper, round with some length.
And it is necessary that you have these types of cupping glasses: large, medium, and small, so that you may stop the flow of blood quickly when necessary, and when other medicine is not initially available.
However, do not use them to draw blood from every part of the body, but only from fleshy places, such as the muscles of the legs and thighs, and the muscles of the arms, and the breasts, and the abdomen, and the knees, and similar fleshy, moist muscles.
And sometimes other small instruments are made, similar to small bladders, in this shape; through which blood is drawn when it is done by phlebotomy, or by incision of a vein or by arrow wound.
And sometimes they are made round, according to this shape:
Chapter 47.
Concerning the care of men's breasts which resemble those of women.
Sometimes the breasts of some men are inflamed due to the habit of sleeping on them; and then the breasts are inflamed, and they resemble women's breasts, and become purulent, ulcerated.
And for one who has this, it is necessary to incise it with a lunate incision according to this shape, from line B to line G, and then scrape away all the thickness, and then fill the wound with incarnative medicine, and then approximate the two lips of the wound with suture, and treat it until it is healed.
But if the breast droops downwards and is softened by its size, as happens in women, then let it be split in two halves, its upper parts, with two incisions resembling a lunar shape, each contained within the other by the end of each, so that the larger line contains the smaller according to this shape, from line B and line G. And then scrape the skin which is between the two lips of the wound, and remove the fat, and administer what we have said of the suture and the powders, that which is necessary in the healing until it is healed.
And if you do not complete the incision of what must be incised because of the patient's unease, and because of blood flow, then you must fill the wound with cotton soaked in corrosive ointment and leave it until it corrodes what is superfluous fat, and then treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 48.
Of the perforation of abscesses that appear below the nipple.
These abscesses that appear below the nipple are a type of scrofula, hard, which contain a sac-like skin.
And some of them contain humidity; and those that contain humidity must be incised with a lunar incision according to this figure: from line G to line B. And when all that is in the abscess of pus is evacuated, then you fill it with old cotton and leave it there until the next day.
And then the cotton should be removed and it should be treated with a suitable ointment for this, until it is healed.
And if the abscess is of the type of nodes and scrofula, then you incise it as we have said in the section on scrofula similarly.
But if the wound is so extensive that it produces putrefaction, then administer cautery to it as we have previously described.
Chapter 49.
Concerning the incision of abscesses that occur from archery or from a vein.
When an artery is broken, and the skin over it is consolidated, then often an abscess occurs. And the signs by which it is known that inflammation and abscess are from an artery or vein: for when the abscess is from an artery, it is long and attached to the flesh of the body; and when you press the abscess with your fingers, you feel in it a kind of grating or creaking sound (stridor).
And that which is from a vein is round on the surface of the body.
And incision of this abscess is an error, especially in that which is under the armpits, and in the groin, and in the neck, and in many places of the body; and it is very large, therefore its treatment with iron (cautery or knife) should be avoided.  And that which is in the extremities, or on the head, should be avoided [treated with caution/alternative methods].
But concerning that which is from them [abscesses] by inflammation of the opening of the artery, make a long incision in the skin; and then widen the incision with hooks and near the artery, and free it from the tunics until it is uncovered.
And then place a needle on it and make it penetrate to the other side, and tie the artery with double thread in two places—which method I have shown you in the extraction of two arteries which are in the temples.
And then pierce the place which is between two ligaments with a spatula until all the blood which is there comes out, and the abscess is dissolved.
And then administer treatment in which powder is applied until the ligaments fall away; and then treat that with ointments suitable for this until it is healed.
And if it is an abscess from a severed vein, then it is necessary that you hold with your hand as much as you can of the abscess with the skin, and then insert the needle below the place which you have held under your hand, and make it penetrate; and let there be double thread on it so that you extract it from the other side, and then tie the abscess with a good ligature, as I have told you in the ligature of a grape [vein] in two parts with two ends of the thread.
But if you fear that it will pull out the thread, then insert the thread with that needle under all the abscess below the incision of the first needle, and tighten the threads in four places.
Then dry the abscess in the middle of it until, when what is inside it has come out, then you incise the excess skin, and leave what is tied there.
And then place on it a powder which you have submerged in wine and oil, and then administer the treatment which is done with poultices and ointments until it is healed.
Chapter 1 of the abscess which happens because of a twisted nerve.
Just as abscesses occur in arteries and veins, similarly abscesses occur in the nerves when they are struck or injured by excessive work, and similarly.
And it is formed mostly in the places of the joints or of the heel, or in any place where the joints are injured.
And the abscess is serious, and it resembles the color of the other body parts, and it is in the greatest part of its disposition without them, and when it is strongly constricted, the patient feels a kind of numbness there.
And the abscess is not aggregated in the front of the body, and therefore it is below the rib cage, and it is injured in every part and does not spread to the front or back parts.
Therefore, that which is in the joints should not be incised with iron, for contraction will quickly result.
But that which is on the head or forehead, incise with a spatula. But if the abscess is small, then take it with forceps and excise it from the root.
And if it is large, then you suspend it with a hook, and excise it, and then remove it; and close the wound with sutures, and treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 51.
Concerning the incision of an abscess which occurs in the cheek, which also occurs in the abdomen.
It happens to some men many times in their bellies and in other parts of their bodies, those things which are called fungals by similarity to fungi, of which the root is subtle and the head is large; and sometimes the lips of these are inverted, and it is of those that is small, and it is of those that is greatly magnified.
And I myself have seen one, and in his belly were two things which were most similar to fungi, and there was no difference between them, white, with a thin root.
And sometimes the lips of these were inverted and split, and humidity flowed from it constantly.
Therefore I incised them and found in one about eighteen ounces, and in the other about six ounces.
And the operation in the incision of them is that you consider then if the patient is humid, and the color of the thing is white, humid, of subtle root; then you incise it with a broad spatula, and let cauteries be in your presence in the fire, because many times after the section of it much blood is expelled; and if the blood overcomes you, cauterize it.
And if you see the patient fearful and timid, beware of incision with iron; but then take freshly made lead plaster, and bind the thing with that, in the manner which we have described; and leave it for two days.
And then adjust the tightness of the lead thread; therefore, do not cease to tighten the lead strongly around the thing, until it is cut off and falls by itself without effort.
But if the thing is of thick root, then in its incision there is some cause for fear and dread, and especially that which is in the belly.
But it is possible that you incise half of it, and then cauterize that so that it does not return.
And then care for it until the wound is healed.
And beware that you do not presume to incise that which is of dark color, little feeling, and little suppuration, for that is possibly cancerous.
And I come to the remembrance of cancer regarding this.
Chapter 52.
Concerning the treatment of umbilical hernia.
Umbilical hernia is caused by many things; either by fissures of the peritoneum which is above the belly, and through it the intestine or bowel protrudes as it happens in other ruptures; or by blood which flows from a vein or artery as previously stated, or by constricted flatulence within it.
But if it is due to a fissure of the peritoneum and protrusion of the intestine, then the color of the swelling is similar to the color of the body; and it is soft without pain, and appears in various locations. And if it is due to the protrusion of the bowel, then its location is as we have recounted, with even greater variability, and when you press it with your fingers it is hidden, and quickly returns; and it is easily felt there, and is greatly increased by the entry of a bath and strenuous work.
But if it is due to humidity, then it is soft and is not hidden when you press it with your hand, nor is it constricted, nor does it grow.
And if it is due to blood, then the swelling appears with these signs, tending towards blackness.
But if it is due to raw flesh, then the swelling is heavy, large and hard, and is fixed in a certain place.
But if it is due to wind/gas, then the touch of it is soft.
And the operation on it is that you consider then if the swelling of the umbilicus is from arterial blood, or from a vein, or from wind/gas; then it is necessary that you abstain from its treatment, because in that case there is fear and danger, as I have taught you in the chapter in which I discussed swellings from artery and vein.
And if the swelling of the umbilicus is due to the intestine or the membrane, then you must order the patient to hold his breath, and be lying down and stretched out; and then mark with a probe around the whole umbilicus, and then order him to lie between your hands on his back, and then circumscribe with a broad spatula around the umbilicus on the place which you have marked with the probe; and then extend half of the swelling upwards with an unguent; and then bind it around with strong thread or with a bandage, and in a proper manner of binding.
And then open the middle of the extended swelling over the ligature and insert your finger into that opening and search for the intestine; and if you have found it and it is held by the ligature, then you extract it gently and push the intestine into the inner parts of the belly.
And if you have found the membrane, then take that with an unguent; and incise its superfluities.
But if it is contrary to your [expectation/finding regarding] artery or vein, then surround that spot, and then return to your operation; and take two needles and put in those two strong threads and insert two needles into the circle which you have made around the swelling in the manner of a cross, which you cause to penetrate; and then tighten the swelling in four parts over the needles.
And if you wish, remove the needles and leave the place until the extended flesh dries and falls off by itself; or incise it when it is thinned and dried, and then cure it with what is appropriate of unguents until it is healed.
And if the prominence of the navel is of raw flesh there or from humidity, then it is necessary that you concavate the swelling as we have said and extract the blood or humidity, which you find there, and then cure it with what is appropriate and consolidate the area.
Chapter 53.
On the treatment of cancer.
We have already spoken, in the division, of the type of cancer and in what manner it is subject to treatment with medicines, and that it is avoided in it, treatment with iron so that it is not ulcerated; and we have spoken of cancer engendered in the manner and caution of its treatment.
And the ancients said that sometimes cancer is in a place where its eradication is possible, as with cancer that is in the breasts or in the groin and in similar members, to extract all of it, and especially when it is small and beginning.
But when it is old and large, one should not apply oneself to it, for I could not cure anyone of it nor have I seen another who has succeeded in this.
And the operation on it, when it is located as we have said, is that you proceed and leave the patient and purge the black bile sometimes, and then bleed him, if a manifest repletion is found.
And then prepare the patient with a preparation in which he is placed for the operation, and then apply to the wound ointments which are suitable for it; and then scrape thoroughly from all sides with a good, sharp curette until no part of its roots remain. And let the blood flow, and do not staunch it lightly, and press the area, and wipe away the thick blood completely with your hand or with an instrument, whichever is possible for you among the instruments.
But if you have difficulty with profuse bleeding from an incision of a vein or artery, then cauterize it until the flow of blood has ceased, and then treat it with the other treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 44.  (Assuming a chapter numbering system)
On the treatment of dropsy.
We have already recounted, in the division, the types of dropsy of water, and the signs of each type, and their treatment with medicines.
And that which is cured with iron is only the species of ascites, and iron is not applied to the species of tympanites or the species of anasarca, for that is deadly.
And when you have treated this species of tympanitic dropsy with medicines and your treatment is not effective, then consider this: if the patient already suffers from debility, or has another disease along with this dropsy, such as a cough or abdominal pain and similar things, then beware of treating them with iron, for there is danger in that.
But if you see the patient with exuberant strength, and with no other illness but dropsy alone, and neither a child nor an old person, then the manner of operating on them is that you lift the patient between your hands, and the assistant gently presses their abdomen with their hand, driving the water towards the pubic region, and then take a sharp lancet in this manner:
Let it be two-edged, long, with a sharp point like a lancet; but nevertheless let there be some small shortness in it, so that in the operation with it you do not pierce the intestine, and injure it.
And then consider if the origin of the dropsy is from the intestines, for then you must make your incision three fingers' breadth below the navel, directly above the pubic region.
But if the origin of the dropsy is due to a liver ailment, then your incision should be three fingers' breadth to the left of the navel.
And if its origin is from the spleen, then your incision should be on the right.
And your incision should not be on the side on which the patient wishes to lie, lest the superfluities flow to that vulnerable place.
Then perforate the whole peritoneum with the instrument, and insert it into that incision, and raise your hand with the spatula between the peritoneum and the omentum, and you will peel back that (omentum); if it is the amount of a fingernail or thereabouts.
Then perforate the omentum until the spatula reaches the empty space, which is the location of the water. Then extract that and insert an instrument of which this is the shape: and it is similar to a fine silver cannula; it is made of silver or bronze or tinned lead, which at its lower part has a small hole, and on its sides there are three holes: two on one side and one on the other; and its incised extremity is shaped like a feather, like this:
And at its uppermost extremity is a ring, because when the instrument reaches the water, then that (ring) immediately settles on the instrument, therefore evacuating the water in the right amount, for if you evacuate more than is necessary at once, the patient will very quickly die from the dissolution of his animal spirit, or a syncope will occur which is near to death.
But evacuate it according to the amount of its virtue and according to what the patient's condition indicates to you through the virtue of their pulse and their overall state.
Then extract the instrument, and retain the water, the reason being that it is immediately retained by the caulking which seals the hole that is on the cup, which I have described to you that you should perforate in that manner.
Then reapply the instrument the next day if you see the patient tolerating it, and extract a small quantity of water, and do this for several days cautiously, and beware of error so that only a little water remains.
But if you fear for the patient, and leave a large quantity of water, then treat him with warm sand burial, and induce sweating in a bath, and expose him to the sun for a long time; and treat him with drying medicines until he is healed.
And cauterize the stomach, the spleen, and the liver after the extraction of the water, as I have recounted in what precedes.
Chapter 54.  (Assuming Roman numeral numbering;  LV is 55 in Arabic numerals, but chapters are often numbered consecutively in a running order.)
Of the treatment of children who are born with imperforate urinary tracts.
Sometimes a child is born from its mother's womb and the opening of its urethra is not perforated (or is a narrow opening or is not in its proper place).
Therefore it is necessary to treat it with perforation as soon as it is born, with a very thin instrument, according to this method:
And then place a thin lead probe into the opening and leave it there for three or four days.
And when it wants to urinate, it should be stimulated and it will urinate; and then return the probe.
And if you do not place the lead [probe], it is possible that the urine which goes to that place will not allow it to close.
But that [opening] whose hole is narrow should be treated with a lead probe, as we have said, for several days until it is widened.
But those in whom the opening is not in its proper place, so it is said, the cause of which is that in such individuals, the opening is located below the tip of the penis, so that they cannot urinate unless they raise the penis with their hand to the upper part; and this is not conducive to procreation because the sperm cannot reach the womb in a straight path, and it is a very prolonged illness.
And the manner of the operation is that the patient should be placed on his back, and then extend the head of his penis with your left hand with a vigorous pull, and incise the tip of the penis at the location of the prepuce with a sharp scalpel, like a feather incision, or that you shave some part, so that the middle of it becomes similar to the head of the penis and so that the opening falls into the middle location as needed.
And be careful in your operation about the flow of blood, for this often happens; and stop it with something that will staunch the blood, and treat the wound until it is healed.
Chapter 56.
Concerning the whitlow which occurs in the prepuce at the head of the penis, and of corruption, blackness, and adhesion of the prepuce to the head of the penis.
Many times this whitlow occurs on the penis and is a swelling of foul flesh.
And of these, one is malignant and the other is not malignant.
For the non-malignant, you should suspend it with a fine hook and excise it until you have removed it all; then place on that wound a cloth soaked in Egyptian ointment; and afterwards, treat it with diafinicon ointment until it is healed.
And if the whitlow is malignant, of a foul color, then you should apply cautery to the incision of it and its root.
But if the whitlow is in the prepuce of the head of the uncircumcised penis, and one part of the whitlow is inside the prepuce and the other part is outside, then you should remove the whitlow which is inside first until it is consolidated; and then you treat the outside one, because when you treat both at the same time with the prepuce, it is not ensured that it will not be injured.
And if you find in the genitals and prepuce blackness and corruption, then you should remove everything that is already blackened and is beginning to corrupt or is already corrupt; and then apply to it a poultice made with honey, which is mixed with finely ground and sifted pomegranate rind flour and crushed and sieved herbs.
And then treat it with another cure until it is healed.
But if there is a flow of blood, then apply lunar cautery according to this method:
because cautery is helpful for two conditions at once, that is, for the flow of blood and for the wound when it is corrupted.
And if the head of the penis is corroded and completely destroyed, then you should insert a lead cannula into the opening of the prepuce so that the patient can urinate through it.
In the adhesion of the prepuce to the head of the penis (and this adhesion only occurs in one whose prepuce is healthy, and circumcision has not been performed; and when adhesion occurs due to a wound or abscess) it is necessary that you scrape with a blunt spatula until the bond is dissolved and the head of the penis is freed from all parts.
And if it is difficult to separate these exquisitely, then you should scrape with a spatula some part of the head of the penis and the prepuce, and this is because the prepuce, when thin, is easily perforated by its slight thinness.
Then separate the prepuce from the head of the penis with a fine linen cloth, which has been moistened in cold water so that they do not adhere again.
Then let it be treated with styptic wine until it is healed.
Chapter 57.
Of the cleansing of children and the treatment of what happens to those circumcised.
Circumcision is not a solution of continuity like other wounds; however, since it is of our operation and our will, and since it is properly done on infants, it is necessary that we assign to it the best operation and the easiest path leading to health.
Therefore I say that the ancients did not discuss circumcision in any of their books, for they did not use it in their laws, and it is only because we have acquired it through experience.  The reason is that I have found most of the artisans and barbers use circumcision and cleansing with a lancet and with forceps; and they use ligature with thread and incision with the fingernail.
And I have tried all these methods and I find no better cleansing with scissors, with ligature with thread, than cleansing with the fingernail, because many times the outer skin escapes, for the foreskin has two layers, and the inner layer remains, and is easily forced to another incision and certain pain. And with cleansing which is done with a sharp instrument, and is done with the fingers, which cobblers use, the incision of the extremity of the virile member is not secured, because it easily enters the hole.
But in the operation with the fingernail, it quickly becomes rusty and spoils your work. And the foreskin of a child is short by nature, and many times it is born in such a way that it has no need of cleansing, and I have seen this.
But of the cleansing that is done with scissors and ligatures with thread, the goodness, experience has shown me, for scissors are of proportional incision, because the sharpness which is above is as the sharpness which is below; and thus as you press your hand, there are two proportional sharpnesses, and it incises according to a comparison at one time; and a compression is made of the thread with a figure containing the foreskin of the penis from every part, with which no error at all occurs.
And the manner of the first operation is that you make the child stand, especially if it is one of those who understands a little, so that you do nothing but tie the thread around its penis only, and leave it until the next day.
And then make him happy in every way possible that he can understand. And then have him lie still between your hands, prepared, and let him not be fidgety; and hide the scissors in your hand or under your foot, so that the child does not see them nor any of the other instruments.
And then put your hand to his penis and blow on the foreskin, and pull it back until the head of the penis is exposed, and then cleanse it of whatever dirt is attached to it.
The shape of the scissors for circumcision, this is the shape:
Let one end be blunt and the other sharp, so that the nail does not come out, and let the length of the two sharpened points be the same as the length of two fingers equally.
But the error in circumcision is that you too quickly remove the entire inner foreskin, or part of it, after the incision.
Therefore it is necessary that you stretch that [skin] with your fingernail before the suppuration of the area and that you incise it evenly.
And if you cannot hold it with your fingernail, then pull it with forceps and incise it.
But if three days have passed, and what is swollen remains under the inflamed penis, then you should leave it until the hot abscess subsides, and gently scrape it, and incise it as you see fit.
And beware of the head of the penis, for that will harm him.
And then treat it with that which consolidates the wound, from the powders which we have recommended in the treatise on powders.
And if it is incised excessively from the scrotum and reaches the parts above, that will not harm him.
And further, treat it with what we have said until it is healed.
Chapter 58.
On the treatment of urine retained in the bladder.
Retention of urine in the bladder is caused by obstruction from a stone, or congealed blood, or pus, or a tumor, and similar to those things we have described in the methods of treatment in the division.
And if it is not dissolved with what we have said and the cause is severe for the patient, then extraction must be administered with an instrument which is called a syringe, of which this is the form: Let it be of silver and be subtly hollowed like a bird's quill, with the subtlety of a long ray, similar to a palm and a half in length, which has a thin tube at its tip.
And the manner of drawing the urine with this is that you take a doubled cloth and tie wool or cotton at its end with a good knot; and insert the ends of the cloth into the lower part of the syringe, and cut with scissors if any excess wool is present; but insert it into the cannula forcefully. Then lubricate the syringe with butter and egg white.
And make the patient sit on a chair, and moisten his bladder and penis with moist oils, olive oil and rosewater.
Then gently insert the syringe until it reaches the root of the penis; then bend the penis upwards towards the navel; then push the syringe inside that; then push it until it reaches the bladder, and that indicates to the patient that it has reached the void, and this is not done according to this order, but rather the meatus which goes in a tortuous way.
Then gradually extend the cloth with the wool, because the urine will soak the wool.
Then extract it and take care of the urine, and use the syringe, do not cease to do this and use the syringe until the bladder is emptied and the patient finds relief.
Chapter 59.
Concerning the quality of bladder irrigation with a catheter and similar instruments suitable for this purpose.
When an ulceration or abscess occurs in the bladder, or congealed blood is present in it, or putrefaction is constricted, and you want to instill waters and medicines into it, then it should be done with an instrument which is called a catheter, and this is its form:
except that its extremity is blunt, that is, closed. And in it there are three openings: two on one side, like eyes.
At the beginning, there is a concave space, into which that which is to be instilled is poured, and it should be according to the quantity which fills it, without addition, until when something is drawn from the humors with it, it is drawn out, and when it is expelled, with that it is drawn out, and when it is expelled far, as the catheter does with which naphtha is injected in sea battles.
Therefore, when you want to draw humors from the bladder, insert the extremity of the catheter into the humor, and draw with it that which is pushed upwards, because the humor is drawn into the concavity of the catheter.
And then insert the end of the catheter into the penis as we have recounted in the syringe; and then expel the humor with that which you expel, for that humor arrives at the bladder immediately, and the patient feels it.
The form of the subtle catheter with which the bladder is catheterized, and this is its form:
And let it be made of silver or tin, of which the uppermost part should resemble a small feather, and below it a slender tube.
And then take a goat's bladder, and place in it the humor that you want to instill into the bladder, and then tie it between two with a strong double ligature, and heat that humor over the fire.
And then insert the end of the catheter into the penis.
And then squeeze your hand on the bladder with the liquid with gentle pressure until the patient says that the liquid has reached the bladder.
But if you do not have a bladder at hand, then take a piece of parchment and make a circle from it; and pierce it all around its circumference; and then insert strong thread into those holes, so that it is tightly bound; and then attach the circle in such a way that it is firmly sealed, so that you can put into it what you want of the liquids, and oils, and waters.
And then you tie that to the instrument and do with it as you have done with the bladder, and express with your hand until the liquid reaches the bladder.
Chapter 60.
On the extraction of a stone.
We have already mentioned in the division the types of stones and their treatment with medicines, and the difference between stones formed in the kidneys and stones formed in the bladder, and their symptoms.
And we have discussed the stone which requires a manual operation and incision.
And the stone generated in the bladder properly is that which is lodged in the bladder.
And I am narrating this with clear exposition and brevity.
Therefore I say that stones generated in the bladder mostly affect children; and among its symptoms is that the urine that is expelled from the bladder is similar to water in its thinness, and sand appears in it; and the patient rubs his genitals, and often cries, and is restless; and with this,  pus comes out of the anus in many of these cases.
And the healing of children from this is easier until they reach fourteen years; and the cure is difficult in the elderly. But in young people it is moderate because it is between those extremes.
And in the case where the stone is larger, the cure is easier; and if it is small, it is the opposite.
Therefore, to achieve a cure, at the beginning we must cleanse the patient with a clyster which extracts all the fecal matter that is in their bowels; for this fecal matter sometimes prevents the discovery of the stone through its examination.
Then the patient should be taken with their feet up and massaged and shaken so that the stone descends to the bottom of the bladder, or sometimes leaps from its place.
Then make that small incision between your hands, prepared beforehand, and his hands should be placed under his thighs so that the entire bladder is tilted downwards.
And then search for it and remove all of it from there.
Therefore, if you feel the stone in the area, then immediately proceed with an incision upon it.
And if it does not completely subside under your touch, then you should anoint the index finger of your left hand with oil, if the patient is a child, or the middle finger if they are a young adult, and insert it into their rectum. And press on the stone until it stays beneath your finger. And return it little by little to the neck of the bladder.
And then press on it with your finger, and expel it outwards to the place from which you removed it.
And instruct an assistant to press on the bladder with their hand; and instruct another assistant to extend the genitals upwards with their right hand, and with their other hand to support the perineum, which is below the genitals, near the place where the incision is made.
And then insert a well-sharpened spatula, of which this is the form: And incise what is between the anus and the genitals, not in the middle, but towards the left thigh; and let the incision be above the stone, and your finger be in the anus, and let the incision be transverse, so that the external incision is wide and the internal incision narrow, according to the size that the removal of the stone allows, and no larger, because your finger, which is in the anus, will easily compress the stone against the incision, and it will be expelled without difficulty.
And know that some stones are angular and jagged, which makes their extraction difficult because of this.
And those that resemble an acorn, and are round, are easily extracted.
Therefore, if it is one that is angular and jagged, adjust it in the fissure (or incision).
And if it is not expelled in this way, then you must push on it, or press on it with a suitable instrument, the end of which is like a file with which you press against the stone, and do not let it escape; or introduce underneath it a thin instrument with a curved end.
But if you cannot [remove it] in this way, then you enlarge the opening a little, and if you see a flow of blood, staunch it with crushed vitriol.
But if the stone is more than one, then initially you apply your hand to the opening of the bladder, and then incise over it; then push it a little; and similarly do if there are more than two.
And if the stone is very large, then it is unwise to incise it with a large incision, for this causes one of two things to happen to the patient: either death, or a continuous urinary fistula, because the area is not completely consolidated (healed).
But administer its expulsion until it is expelled, or work on its fracture with forceps until you extract it in pieces.
Then, when you have completed your operation, fill the wound with aloe shavings and dragon's blood, and bind it tightly. And place over it a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or in rose oil and cold water, so that a hot abscess may be calmed.
Then lay the patient supine on their back, and do not unbind the bandage until the third day.
And when you have unbound it, bathe the area with water and much oil, and then treat it with diafinicon ointment and diabazilicon ointment until it is healed.
But if in the wound there occurs a hot, burnt, and corrosive abscess, and of such appearance as if blood were frozen in the bladder, and because of it urine is obstructed (and this is known by the passage of blood with urine), then insert your finger into the wound and extract that blood, for if it remains it provokes corruption of the bladder and putrefaction thereof.
Then wash the wound with sharp wine, water, and salt, and with all appropriate remedies, with whatever is suitable for its healing until it is healed.
And it is necessary during the entire course of treatment that you bind both thighs and adjust the medicines which are placed on the area.
And if the stone is small and is in the meatus of the penis, and is lodged there, and the passage of urine is obstructed, then treat it with what I have recommended before you resort to incision, for many times because of this treatment incision has been necessary; and I have already proven this, and it is that you take a heated iron perforator, of which this is the form:
of triangular extremity, sharp, set in wood.
Then take a thread, and tie the penis below the stone with it so that it does not return to the bladder.
And then insert the iron into the penis, perforating easily until the perforator reaches the stone. And turn the perforator with your hand on that stone little by little, and you will enlarge the perforation until you make it penetrate from the other side; for the urine will immediately be released.
And then press your hand on what remains of the stone on the outside of the penis, because that is broken, and is expelled with the urine, and the patient is healed.
But if this treatment is not suitable for you for any reason that prohibits it, then tie one thread below the stone, and another thread above the stone. And then incise upon the stone in that penis between the two ligatures. And then extract it. And then untie the ligatures and clean the congealed blood which is formed in the wound.
And it is not necessary to tie a thread below the stone, except so that it does not return to the bladder; and the other thread above, because when the thread is untied near the extraction of the stone, the stone returns to its place and covers the wound.
And for this reason it is necessary for you, when you tie the thread above, that you elevate the stone to the upper parts, or that it returns during your procedure, and covers the wound as we have said.
Chapter 61.
On the extraction of a stone from women.
Stones are rarely generated in women.
But if a stone is found in one of them, then its cure is difficult, and is forbidden by many methods.  (Or: ...and is forbidden in many ways.)
One reason is that women are very easily made virgins again. (The implication is that surgical intervention would be counterproductive due to the woman's capacity for healing and/or the risk of damaging her virginity.)
And the second is that you will not find a woman, be she chaste or married, who willingly reveals herself to a physician.
The third is that you will not find a woman who knows this art well, especially the operation with the hand.
And the fourth is that the location of the incision for a stone in women is far from the location of the stone itself, wherefore a deep incision is needed, and in that there is danger.
But if necessity compels you to this, then you must take a female physician who is skilled, and they are rarely found.
But if you are deprived of that, then seek a skillful and subtle physician, or present a matron well-versed in women's matters, or a woman who knows some part of this art.
Therefore, present that woman, and command her to do all that you order, from the initial examination for the stone; the reason is that if she considers whether the woman is a virgin, then she must put her finger in her anus and feel for the stone.
Therefore, if she finds it,  constrict that area below her finger, and then command her to incise there.
But if she is not a virgin, then command the matron to insert her finger into the vagina of the patient and search for the stone, while placing her left hand on the bladder, and compress it with a good compression.
Therefore, if she finds it, then she must gradually soften it from the opening of the bladder to the lower parts with the sum of her skill until she reaches the root of the thing.
And then incise it near the junction of the vagina and the root of the thing, wherever it is stopped for her, and center the stone in that part, and her finger should not be removed from the stone, constricting below it.
And the incision should be small at the beginning; and then insert the instrument (or probe) into that incision, and if the stone is felt, then adjust the incision according to the size that she knows the stone will be removed from.
And know that the types of stones are many: for some are small and large, and smooth and rough, and long and round, and having branches (or protrusions).
Therefore you should know how many types there are of them so that you may understand what you want to do.
And if you see a flow of blood, apply crushed vitriol to the place and keep it there for an hour until the bleeding stops, and then return to your operation until the stone is removed.
And ensure that you prepare the instruments which are mentioned in the extraction of stones in men, so that you are aided by them in your operation.
And if you see a flow of blood, and you know that the expulsion of blood is from the artery that has been incised, then you should place powder on the place and bind it tightly with powders and a descending bandage, and do not repeat this; and leave the stone and do not extract it, for the patient will quickly die. And then treat the wound.
Then, when the sharpness of the blood has subsided after a few days, and the place is dry, you return to your operation until the stone is removed.
Chapter 62.
Concerning the incision of a strangulated hernia.
A watery hernia is nothing but an accumulation of moisture in the white scrotum, which is below the root of the genitals containing the testicle, and is called scrotum.
And sometimes it is in the proper tunic which nature has prepared for it in the area of the testicle, so that it seems that there is another testicle; and this is the root of the genitals between the white scrotum which we have mentioned, and this is nothing but a swelling.
And the generation of this hernia is due to weakness which affects the genitals, so that this matter is poured into them, and sometimes it occurs due to a blow inflicted on the genitals.
And this moisture has many colors, for its color is either tending towards yellow or bloody, or reddish, or black and foul-smelling, or a watery white, and this is the most common.
And the signs by which it is known where this accumulation of water is are these: for if it is in the white scrotum which we have mentioned, then the abscess is round, inclining slightly to length, like the shape of an egg, and surrounds the testicle, for the moisture contains it on all sides.
And if the moisture is in the proper tunic, then the abscess is round near the testicle and therefore one thinks it is another testicle.
And if the moisture is between the  cord of the genitals and the white scrotum, then it falls below the feeling/sensation.  (Meaning the swelling is lower down and the area is numb.)
And if you wish to know the color of the moisture, then you test the color of the moisture in the abscess with a probe, the form of which is described beforehand; and according to what has come out on the probe, judge what is inside.
Therefore, when we come to its cure with iron [cautery], then it is necessary that we order the patient to be phlebotomized if that is possible for you, and you see his body is full.
And then let him lie supine on his back on something slightly raised, and place many cloths beneath him.
And then sit on his left side, and order the assistant to be on his right side, who should extend his finger to one of the two sides of the cord of the genitals and the part of the navel.
And then take a broad spatula and cut the cord of the genitals in the middle lengthwise almost to the perineum.
And let the incision be made straight and equally distant from the line that divides the skin of the genitals, until it reaches the included white fat.
And scrape that [white fat], and observe, and be careful not to cut it; and your scraping, with which you scrape it partially, should be suspended with the finest and most subtle scraping possible according to the quantity.
And then pierce the water-filled cyst with a wide perforation, and extract all the water.
And then separate the two lips of the incision with hooks, and extend the cyst upwards; and do not touch the cord of the genitals within, and incise the cyst in whatever way is possible for you. And incise it in its entirety or in pieces, and especially its thin layer, because if you do not carefully examine its incision, there is no certainty that the water will not return.
But if the egg [testicle] protrudes from its sheath during your operation, then when you have completed the incision of the cyst, return it inside, and then join the two lips of the sheath of the genitals with a suture, and then treat it like other wounds until it is healed.
And if you find the testicle corrupted by another illness, then you must tie the vessels which are on the spermatic cord, and remove the testicle, and then treat it as we have said.
But if the fluid is collected in two separate areas, then know that there are two hernias; therefore, incise that area in the same way as you did the other; and if it seems to you that it is a single operation, then you perform it.
And then you wipe away the blood, and insert into the incisions wool soaked in oil or rose oil; and place on top more wool which you have soaked in wine and oil, and spread this over the genitals and the area of the abdomen; and place on top doubled cloths and powders, and bind these on top with a bandage which is according to this form:
And then two cloths should be taken and filled with carded wool in this manner; and the ends should be made with which it is bound with cotton or damp wool, and they should be added with a bandage in the waistband of the breeches, and one of the ends should reach from the buttocks to the two thighs, and the second should reach to the groin area, and two ends below the two thighs and two other ends above the two knees, and the whole bandage should be fastened in the waistband of the breeches.
And sometimes this hernia is treated artificially with cautery instead of incision with an iron; and it is that you take a thin, knife-like cautery and with it you incise the skin of the genitals, and it is ignited as we have recounted until the white cyst containing the water is exposed, and then you take a cautery in this form: and it resembles the Greek letter.
And then pierce the cyst with it, and ignite it until all the moisture is expelled.
And then extend the cyst with forceps, and scrape with forceps, and scrape with a thin, ignited cautery; and incise it as much as possible until you eradicate all of it; and be careful that the fire does not touch the egg (testicle).
And know that this operation is safer and involves less blood loss, and better than operation with incision.
But if an abscess hinders you during the incision or cauterization, or blood flow, then you must cure whatever hinders you, with the appropriate treatment as described.
But if the patient is fearful and does not expect a second operation because of its horror, then administer perforation as I have recommended; and it is when you are certain, because of what we have said about the signs, that the hernia is watery.
Then you should make the patient sit on some raised seat, then perforate the abscess in its lowest part with a wide spatula, and position the perforation according to the length of the body.
And let the opening be wide enough so that all the water flows out.
Then place a cotton pad over the area and bind it, and leave it so that the remaining water drains. And then treat it until the wound is healed.
But if there is resistance to the outflow of water at that time, you should perforate it: and this is done only because the white panniculus [layer of fat] in the orifice of the wound offers resistance and prevents the exit of the water; then you should place in the wound a pump or instrument with which water is extracted from dropsies, the form of which has been described previously; or apply gentle pressure to the wound opening.
And know that if the water returns and is accumulated again within six months or thereabouts; and when it is accumulated, then it should be perforated in the same manner, for the patient will thus pass his days.
Chapter 63.
Concerning the incision of a fleshy hernia and its treatment.
Know that in the incision of this hernia there is a fear of loss leading to death in most cases; therefore, in my opinion, its removal and being saved by that is better.
And I am recalling the operation on that and the types of abscesses.
Therefore, I say that abscesses arise in the genitals which are composed of these, and this is caused by many things: either by an acute, acrid superfluity, which is poured into the genitals, or by percussion.
And the color of the abscess is according to the color of the body, and no pain is found in it, and it is a serious abscess.
And very quickly is a liquefied abscess, of which the color is dark, and there is no feeling in it.
And sometimes it is caused by the knotting of the arteries, and by the inflammation of those as it is already perceived by the memory of it, or by inflammation of the veins.
But that which is from inflammation of the arteries is known by the dispersion of the abscess when we compress it with our fingers; and it is not fitting that it be touched.
But that which is caused by inflammation of a vein is not dispersed by any cause of compression with the fingers.
And it is possible that an incision is made on this type of swelling and on the other flesh; and it is that you incise the skin of the genitals, and then extend the testicle upwards, and extract it from the white tunic, and free the suspensory ligament, and tie it, and incise the suspensory ligament after you free it from every part of the testicle.
Therefore, if the testicle is already consolidated with those inflamed tissues, then it is necessary that you extract the testicle and incise it.
And if there is adhesion between any part of the tunic, or between that which is between the vessels, then it is necessary that you free all that adhesion and incise it with a circular incision.
But if there is a growth of flesh in the place of the adhesion which is behind, then it is necessary that you incise all that which is there, and extract the testicle as we have said.
Then, when your operation is complete, fill the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and wine; and then treat it with other treatments until it is healed.
Chapter 64.
On the treatment of a hernia that is of the scrotum (or a scrotal hernia).
A scrotal abscess is an inflammation enveloped by some covering similar to a sac, with softening of the testicles, and it makes movement, exercise, and walking difficult for the patient.
And in the treatment of this illness, fear is caused by the recollection of what preceded it.  (Alternatively:  And in treating this illness, one must remember what preceded it, for it causes fear.)
However, we must describe the operation in the same way as the ancients did.
And I say that you must make the patient sit on a raised seat; and then gently pull the suspensory ligament of the testicles downwards; and then hold the scrotum with your fingers, along with the veins that are close to the penis; and let another assistant hold and powerfully extend them.
And then incise with a sharp, broad scalpel, with a transverse incision, directly over the vessels, until the vessels are exposed.
And then flay the entire area in the manner we have described for the extraction of arrows that are lodged in the temples.
And then insert a double-threaded needle into them, and tie it at the first point where you made the incision and tie the other end at the back of them (the vessels). And then incise them in the middle with a straight incision along the length of the body, and extract that which is gathered from the fetid and corrupt humors.
And then treat the wound with the same treatment as other wounds in which you wish healing to be engendered, so that the vessels which nourish one of the two genitals may fall (heal), for that is not harmful.
But if you have cut all the vessels, then it is necessary that the testicles be removed, or that the testicles be tied off with the vessels, so that they are deprived of all nourishment by the incision of the vessels, and that they be destroyed, or that they be tied off so that there is no further growth there.
Chapter 65.
Concerning the treatment of intestinal hernia.
The occurrence of this hernia is due to a rupture that happens in the peritoneum extended over the abdomen on the side of the inguinal rings of the abdominal cavity, causing the intestines to protrude from that rupture to some extent.
And this rupture is either of the peritoneum or an extension of it, and these two types occur for many reasons:  a blow, a jump, a shout, the lifting of something heavy, or similar causes.
And the sign of this, when it is due to an extension of the peritoneum, is that it happens gradually over a long time, and not suddenly, and it is an inguinal swelling near the groin because the peritoneum compresses the intestine.
And the sign of it, when it is due to a rupture of the peritoneum, is that at the beginning it causes sudden, intense pain; and there is a visible swelling below the groin, close to the apparent surface, and this is due to the protrusion of the intestine, and its body in the areas outside the peritoneum.
And sometimes the omentum is expelled along with the intestine, and this hernia is called an intestinal zirbal hernia.  (Note: "zirbal" is likely a variant spelling or a word from a now-obsolete dialect.)
And sometimes it is caused by flatulence, and sometimes a tear occurs in the intestine, and there it is retained, and this causes great suffering for the patient, and sometimes it causes severe pain, especially when pressed.
And in the treatment of this type of illness, iron is dangerous, therefore its use should be avoided.
And the manner of operating on it is that you command the patient to return the intestine with his hand to its cavity if it yields to reduction; then lean over his hip between your hands and raise his legs.
And then stretch the scrotum which is the sac of the testicles upwards, and incise the scrotum lengthwise; then insert into the two lips of the incision hooks, as you would need to open the incision with them.
And if, according to the amount possible for you,  the egg (testicle) is expelled from that incision.
And then scrape away the skin that is under the scrotum, until the hard white tunic of each part is exposed.
Then you insert your finger into what is the testicle, into what is between the white tunic, which is under the tunica vaginalis of the testicle, and the second tunic, and dissolve with it the adhesion that is in the back part of the testicle.
And then gently pull the scrotum upwards with your hand, and with this stretch the tunica albuginea upwards with your left hand, and elevate the testicle with the tunic to the edge of the incision; and instruct the assistant to hold the testicle upwards, and you dissolve the adhesions behind it completely.
And check with your fingers that there is no bowel enveloped in the hard white tunic. But if you find any such thing, then you gently push it back into the abdomen.
And then incise in the area under the scrotum, through an incision from which blood and pus will flow, as we have recounted in what we have said.
Then apply wool soaked in oil and place it on the wound; and apply the ligature which we have mentioned (and sometimes the white tunic is cauterized, which we said above to stop the flow of blood, because this often happens) and leave the ligature until it falls off by itself.
But if its falling off is delayed, then let it be bathed with warm water, and keep it there until it falls off as we have said.
Then treat the wound with the other wound treatments until it is healed.
Chapter 66.
Of a ventose hernia.  (Or: Concerning a hernia with wind/gas.)
In this hernia, I have not seen anyone who has been bold enough to treat it with iron. (Or: In this type of hernia, I have never seen anyone dare to treat it with cautery/iron.)
And the first [doctors] said that it is done as we have recounted in the hernia that is with wine; which is that you tie the vessels near the incision on that [hernia] with ease; and then dry out the middle area around the abscess with that which opens it, until the vessels collapse.
And cure the wound as we have said until it is healed.
Chapter 67.
Of the rupture that is made in the inguinal region (groin).
Sometimes a rupture occurs in the groin as we have said, and the location swells.
And it does not allow any cause of the intestines to the genitals; and if it does, it is little; and it returns in all hours.  (This likely means that the hernia doesn't significantly involve the genitals, and even if it does, it's a small amount and frequently returns to the abdominal cavity).
But if the time with this is prolonged, a fixed fissure is made in the inguinal canal until the intestine descends into the inguinal canal; and this happens because of the extension of the inguinal canal which is in the groin as we have said, which is caused because the canal is stretched, and then it is softened and the place is suppurated and swollen.
And its cure is with cautery, as its narration has preceded. (This means the cure is by cauterization, as previously described).
And sometimes it is cured with iron according to this manner: and it is that the patient lies on his back between your hands, and then dry the location of the rupture of the swollen abscesses with incision across the width according to the amount of three fingers.
And then tighten the white inguinal canal that is under the scrotum until it is uncovered. (This refers to constricting the inguinal canal to better expose the hernia).
And then take the ray (likely referring to a surgical instrument, perhaps a type of cautery) and place it on the prominent part of the inguinal canal, and press it towards the pre-pubic area of the abdomen.
And then sew the two prominent locations on the extremity of the inguinal canal with the ray (instrument), and join one to the other with suture.
And then remove the extremity of the ray (instrument), and do not incise the inguinal canal completely, nor extend the wound, nor anything else like that as I will make you know in the treatment of intestinal hernia.
And then treat it with the treatment for wounds, and as you incise the fibers, cleanse it and restore the wound until it is consolidated; because the inguinal canal is contracted and the prominence of the rupture is not adjusted.
And cauterization is better in this location, because it is closer to health (i.e., a more effective and safer method).
Chapter 68.
Concerning the softening of the swelling of the testicles.
Many times the swelling of the testicles in some men is softened because the flesh that is between them is softened, and this is harmful to their health/appearance.
Then it is necessary for the one who is charged with his cure to make the patient lie on his back, and incise all the swelling which is softened above the natural swelling; and then he should join the two lips with a suture.
And if you wish, sew in the beginning the superfluity of the softened swelling with three or four stitches and with a firm suture.
And then incise between the sutures; and then treat it with the treatment for other wounds until it is healed and the stitches fall out.
Chapter 69.
Concerning castration.
Know that castration is forbidden in our law, but because of that it is incumbent upon me to mention it in this book; and its mention is necessary only in two ways, of which one is so that this is within the knowledge of the physician when questioned about it, that he knows the treatment for it when it occurs; and the other way is that we often have need of castration of other animals for our benefit from them, such as of mules, and of goats, and of pigs, and of similar animals.
And therefore I say that castration is done in two ways: either by abrasion, or by incision.
But in that which is done by abrasion, the method of operation is that we cause the animal to be immersed in hot water until its genitals are softened and relaxed and hang down. And then take them with your hand until they are resolved and do not appear under the touch.
But in castration done by incision, it is necessary that you hold the animal and grasp the scrotum of its testicles with your left hand.
And then tie the suspensory ligament, and incise over each testicle with a cut until both testicles are exposed.
And then incise them after you have skinned each one. And do not place any substance on the cyphus (presumably a type of wound or sore), except the fine cyphus which is over the vessels.
And this method of castration is better, which is done by crushing, because strong crushing leaves no substance of the testicles, so that the animal desires no copulation.
And then treat the wound until it is healed.
Chapter 70.
Concerning the treatment of hermaphroditism.
Hermaphroditism in men is of two kinds: one is where it appears that there is a space in the scrotum, in that which is between the two testicles, a figure like a woman's vulva in which there is hair.
And sometimes urine flows from that which is in the scrotum.
But in women, there is one type:  it is that the vulva, above the pubic area, is like two testicles of a man, somewhat smaller on the outside part, like a man's prepuce and two testicles.
And the cure is of three kinds: two for men and one for women. And it is necessary that you incise those tightened flesh until the swelling subsides, and then that you cure them with the treatment for other wounds.
And in the second type in men, from which urine flows that is in the scrotum, there is no cure or operation for it.
Chapter 21.
Concerning swelling and prominent flesh due to causes in women.
A slight swelling is often caused by natural reasons until it is pressed and made less noticeable; and sometimes it is magnified in some women to such an extent that it spreads like in men and interferes with intercourse.
Then you should hold the excess swelling with your hand or with an instrument and incise it.
And do not go too deep in the incision, especially near the root, so that a flow of blood does not occur.
And then treat it with wound care until it is healed.
Excess flesh is flesh that grows in the mother's womb until it fills it, and it quickly protrudes externally resembling a tail (and because of this some first called it "tailed disease"); therefore, we must incise it as we incise a swelling, and treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 72.
On the treatment of gout.
Gout is when the vagina of the woman is not perforated, or is a small opening. And this is either natural or accidental.
Accidental is due to a preceding illness, and that is caused either by poorly formed flesh or by a subtle or thick membrane.
And it is formed either in the front of the mother, or on her sides, or in her upper part, or in her lower part, and it prohibits conception and pregnancy, and it strongly prohibits menstruation.
And the diagnosis of this is made by observing the womb; if the obstruction is apparent, it is obvious; but if it is not apparent, then you should seek it with your fingers or with a probe.
But if the obstruction is due to a thin membrane, and is close to the two labia, then you should cut and break it.
And you should place powders on the two labia, and then place your index fingers of both hands together.
And the woman should be on her back, her thighs spread, and then spread the two labia forcefully until that thin membrane is broken and the obstruction is opened.
Then take wool and soak it in oil and place it on the area, and keep it moist throughout the day so that the incised area does not heal.
But if the membrane is thick and dense, then you should incise it with a broad spatula or with a myrtle leaf.
But if the obstruction is due to an abscess, then drain it with a lancet, and incise it.
And have with you medicines that stop the flow of blood without biting, such as acacia, dragon's blood, and lint, mixed with egg white.
Then administer a wide lead cannula so that the wound does not heal too quickly.
And keep it there for some days and administer some dry poultices.
And then it should be treated with the other healing methods until it is healed.
And sometimes it happens in the mother's birth of other flesh [likely referring to a difficult birth or complications], and then it is necessary to incise in this manner. But if this is due to a cranky abscess, to the cranky abscess which is in the mother, no harm should be done with iron in any way.
Chapter 73.
Concerning the treatment of hemorrhoids and boils and red swellings that occur in the vulva of women.
Hemorrhoids are a swelling of the orifices of many veins, from which much blood continuously flows; and when they are old hemorrhoids, boils are formed.
And I have already described in the division the types of these and their signs, and I will say thus which ones receive treatment and which ones do not receive treatment.
Therefore I say that hemorrhoids and boils, when they are in the womb and do not appear outwardly, then in those cases no treatment should be done with iron.
But those which are at the orifice of the womb, upon which feeling falls, are those that are cured.
And it is necessary that you place the woman in a cool place and then extend the boil with forceps, or with a rough cloth, and incise them to the roots.
And then sprinkle on them, to stem the flow of blood, one of the incisive powders without biting, such as acacia and similar things.
And then bathe her feet for an hour, and then place her in cold water.
And if the flow of blood persists, then make her sit in a decoction of pomegranate leaves and bark, and of walnuts and similar things.
And then take barley flour and mix it with honey and sour wine and make a plaster with this and apply it to her back.
And if the blood is stopped, it is good; and if not, apply two cupping glasses, to the breasts without scarification.
And then take wool and soak it in coriander juice, or in plantain juice, or in mugwort juice with red wine, and apply it to the area; and then treat the area with ointment until it is healed.
And treat that until it is healed.
Chapter 74.
Of the perforation of a fistula occurring in the mother.
Many kinds of abscesses happen in the mother, such as cancer, and stony abscesses, and ulcerations, and  abscesses, and herpes, and hemorrhoidal fistulas, and fissures, and boils, and other abscesses. And I have already discussed these illnesses, and their types, and their signs, and their cures in the division (section/chapter).
And it is fitting that I speak in this treatise of a hot abscess which appears in the mother when it is among the abscesses that gather pus, and if you wish to know in what manner the operation is performed with iron (a cautery).
Then you must consider if the pain of the abscess at its beginning is acute with percussion and phlegm and fever, and sometimes it reddens and if you touch it you feel pain. Then do not attempt perforation, and treat it with what assists in its maturation until the acuteness of the symptoms subsides.
And then you must make the woman sit on a stool that has two legs; and let her lean on her elbows, and adjust her feet to the part below her belly, and her thighs should be spread, and place her arms under her knees, and tie each one with a suitable bandage to that.
And then the midwife stands on the right side and provides the instrument with which the orifice of the womb is opened, the form of which will come in those things which are done next.
And it is necessary when you want to administer this instrument that you place with the ray (or beam, referring to a light source) the neck of the woman's womb, and that what is entered into the womb by the instrument is no more than the neck of the womb and it hurts the patient. But if the instrument is larger than the neck of the womb, then you must apply powders to the texture of the neck of the womb so that the entrance of any instrument into the neck of the womb is prevented.
And it is necessary that you place the turning device (or rotating mechanism) that runs in the instrument on the upper side, and that the attendant holds the instrument and turns the device until the orifice of the womb is opened.
And when the incision appears, and is touched by the hand and is smooth and moist, then it is necessary that you dry that area, wiping the head with a broad sponge.
And when the pus is evacuated, then it is necessary that you place on the wound a wick submerged in rose oil or green oil in which there is some astringency; and place the poultice on the section in the neck of the womb.
And place outside the womb and over the vulva clean wool submerged in water in which mallows have been boiled.
And then it should be healed in about two days with an ointment which is suitable for this purpose until it is healed.
And sometimes the womb and the wound are washed in such a way that it is cleansed with water and honey, and then with water in which the root of lily or of birthwort has been boiled, and then it returns to the ointment.
And if the wound is deeply within the enclosed womb, then it is necessary that you abstain from treating it with iron, taking care of it with what we have said in the division (chapter/section).
Chapter 75.
To teach midwives in what manner live embryos should be treated when they are expelled contrary to the natural order/course.
It is necessary that the midwife know at the beginning the appearance of natural childbirth by its signs; and it is that when you see the woman straining in her lower parts and desires to smell the air, and moreover is relieved by what is upon her from the birth, and hastens the exit of the embryo, then know that this birth is according to the natural form, and it is the exit of the child head-first, and the afterbirth with it, either suspended or hanging from the umbilical cord.
Therefore, when you see those signs, then it is necessary that her belly be compressed so that the embryo descends easily, for when they descend head-first, the afterbirth descends with it and is cleansed of those superfluities with good purification.
But that which is otherwise is an unnatural and unfavorable birth, for when the embryo is expelled feet first, and its body is expelled before its head and feet, and one of its hands, or its foot, or its head and hand, or its belly, and quickly it is twisted at the neck, and similar unnatural positions.
Therefore it is necessary for the midwife to be wise and skillful in all these matters, and to guard herself against error and deception.
And I am showing all the forms of these, and what skill is needed in them so that it may be understood and acted upon accordingly.
When the fetus is expelled head-first by natural exertion, and this is difficult for the woman and the birth is difficult, and sometimes her strength is already weakened, then have her sit, or have the women support her, and evaporate her vulva with boiled fenugreek and moist oils.
Then the midwife inserts a small, thin spatula between her labia and with it splits the secundines, or scrapes it with her fingernail until she removes the moisture within. And press the woman's belly until the fetus descends.
But if it does not descend, then the woman should be given a clyster of mallow and fenugreek mucilage with a syringe.
Then, after the clyster, order her to be compressed and make her sneeze with sternutatories; and hold her mouth and nose for an hour, for the fetus will be expelled immediately.
And if the two hands of the fetus are expelled at the beginning, then you must reduce them carefully, little by little. But if it does not obey the introduction, then place the woman on a stool and raise her legs, and then shake the stool on the ground; and the woman should be held so that she does not fall from the shaking.
And if the hands are not returned and the fetus dies, then incise them and extract the remains of the fetus, or tie the body to its hand with a cloth and extract it carefully, for it will be expelled.
When the fetus is presenting feet first, then you must push them upwards, and then carefully turn the fetus, and then grasp it, and then take one foot and gently extend it.
But when it has emerged between the thighs, then you should command her to strain, and make her sneeze with a potion, for it will be expelled if God wills it.
And if it is not expelled by what we have recounted, then you return the fetus little by little until you place it in its natural position, for then it will be expelled with ease.
And if it is hindered by all that we have recounted, then take marshmallow mucilage and dissolved gum, and pound everything well in a mortar, and carefully anoint the woman's vulva and the lowest part of her abdomen with it. And carefully make her bathe in lukewarm water, up to her hypochondria (the area below the ribs).
And when you see that the lower parts are softened, then give her a fumigation of myrtle and hold it under her. And when she has had the fumigation for an hour, then make her sit on a chair, and carefully make her sneeze and hold her mouth, and lift her up, and press the lower part of her abdomen with gentle pressure, for the fetus will immediately be expelled.
Thus of the fetus lying sideways, holding one of its hands. Be ingenious in reducing her hand; but if you cannot reduce it, then raise the woman and make her walk.
And if she cannot walk, then make her lie on the bed, and shake her thighs with vehement shaking, and then administer bandages which I have recommended made of mucilage.
And if labor has commenced, then make her sit on a stool, and then work on the reduction of the hand, and grasp the fetus according to its natural position, and make the woman sneeze and command her to bear down until it is expelled.
Thus of the fetus, its hands outstretched over the neck, and its face is towards its mother. It is necessary that the midwife hold the hand of the fetus and then turn it little by little, and that she does this with ease.
And when it is grasped, then place on its head that which we have recommended of oil and mucilages.
And then instruct her to cough little by little, and when you have done this, then make her sit on a stool and command her to be inclined to the right side, and then command her to bear down; and make her sneeze with a concoction. The prepared fetus exits on its side.
When the horror of the mother lessens according to this manner, consider, and then you incise the secundines with your fingernail until it is emptied of humidity.
And if the fetus is suspended over its face and neck, then you incise it at the umbilicus, so that it may not be retained and die.
And then gently push the fetus inwards until you place it as needed, and tell the woman to strain a few times, and it will be expelled with ease, if God wills it.
The exit of twins or multiple fetuses. Know that twins are often born, and sometimes three or four are born, but this is strange and rarely happens; but there are causes for this in nature, and they do not live.
And they share, even if they are multiple, one placenta, and they are separated by a membrane, distinguishing them between the ligament in the umbilical cord of each of them. And sometimes they are expelled as if it were one fetus by easy natural expulsion, and sometimes they are expelled by difficult expulsion as we have recounted.
And if some of their births are difficult, and it comes to what we have said about unnatural presentations, then you treat them as we have recounted.
And if the midwife is skillful and does this with ease and skill, and with gentleness, and is resourceful according to every presentation, as she is prepared by her skill leading to health.
Concerning that which is formed in the womb from embryos and is aborted.
Sometimes one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and even ten or more are formed in the mother, and it has been verified by me that one woman aborted and expelled six, and another ten, all formed, which cause was determined by the measurement of the glorious wise men.
And all this must be in the knowledge of the midwife, because it easily seems to her like this, and therefore she opposes it with what is necessary.
Chapter 76.
On the extraction of the fetus when it is dead.
When you treat a dead fetus with what we have said in the division of medication and it has not been expelled, and you are forced to use a manual operation, then you must consider if the woman is of sound constitution and is not suffering from any of the accidents which threaten her with danger.
Then the woman should be laid on the bed on her back, with her head inclined downwards and her thighs raised.
And the assistant should hold her from both sides, or she should be tied to the bed so that her body does not extend during the extraction of the fetus.
And then you moisten the mother's vulva with warm oils and with a mucilage of mallow, fenugreek, and linseed.
And then let the midwife anoint her hand with those oils and mucilages, and gently insert her hand into the mother, and then search with her hand for the place where the umbilical cord is attached to the fetus.
And convenient places for this: then you should consider if the fetus is positioned head-down, and then you should grasp the umbilical cord at its eyes, or neck, or mouth, or palate, or under the chin, or at its clavicle, or in the appropriate places on the ribs, or under the hypochondria.
But if the presentation is breech, then at the buttocks, or in the middle of the back.
And it is necessary that you hold the umbilical cord with your right hand, and place its curvature in that space which is between the fingers of your left hand, and gently insert your hand and place the umbilical cord in one of those places which we have mentioned, until you reach the empty cavity.
And then place and insert another umbilical cord, or a third if necessary, alongside it, so that the traction is equal, and there is not extension only along its straight line.
Rather, let it be moved in all directions, so that its removal is eased, just as is done in the extraction of a tooth.
And it is necessary in this that the area between them is softened; and if any part of it is retained, then it is necessary that the midwife lubricate some of her fingers with oil and insert them skillfully and loosen with them that which is retained.
Therefore, if a part of the fetus is expelled, then the umbilical cords should be moved to a higher location; and do this until the entire fetus is expelled.
But if one hand emerges before the other, and it is not possible to reduce it because of its constriction, then it is necessary that a cloth be wrapped around it; and then extract it until the whole is expelled, and incise it either at the joint of the hand or at the elbow.
And thus you should do with the other hand and with both feet.
But if the head of the fetus is large, or there is constriction during its exit, or there is collected water in its head, then it is necessary to insert between the fingers expectorant and split the head and extract the water, or to uncover it with an instrument which is named "alundat," the form of which will come with the forms of other instruments in the chapter which is near this one.
And similarly proceed if the fetus has a naturally large head: then it is necessary to incise it with an algematum, or to grasp it with an alunda as we have said; and then extract the bones with forceps.
And if the head is out but constricted below the clavicle, then it should be split so that the fluid which is in the feet may be drained.
But if it is not complicated, nor does it impede delivery, then you should incise the head immediately as much as is possible for you.
And if the lower part of the abdomen is abscessed or dropsical, then it is necessary that you perforate it so that the fluid within it may drain.
But if the fetus is positioned on its feet, then its extraction is easy, and its direction towards the mother's birth canal is easy.
But if it is constricted around the belly and feet, then you must extract it with a cloth which you will have wrapped around your hand, and you must incise the belly and feet so that what is inside them may drain out.
But if the other limbs are removed and only the head remains, then the midwife inserts her left hand; but if the mother's birth canal is open, then she inserts her hand into the womb and searches for the head with it, and pulls it with her fingers towards the mother's birth canal, and then inserts a hook, or two hooks, and pulls it with them.
And if the mother's birth canal is constricted by a hot abscess which harms her, then it should not be disturbed; rather, it is necessary to administer a perfusion of moist, oily substances. And administer plasters; and bathe the patient in waters that soften and moisten.
And if the fetus is lying on its side, then, if possible, it should be rotated; and what we have said about a live fetus should be administered.
And if that is not possible, then it should be cut into pieces, and extracted.
And it is necessary that you leave no part of the afterbirth inside.
And when you have completed all your work, then administer what we have said about the treatment of hot abscesses which may occur in the mother.
And if bleeding occurs, then bathe in styptic waters and administer the other treatment.
And I have seen a woman in whose womb was a dead fetus, and soon after that, she became pregnant again, and soon after, the fetus died as well. A long time ago, an abscess occurred in his navel; and it swelled until it was opened, and began to discharge pus.
And I was called to his care, and I treated him for a long time, and the wound did not heal.
Then I applied plasters of strong attraction to him, and I extracted a bone from him, and after some days, I extracted another bone; and I was greatly amazed, since there should be no bones in the belly.
And then I considered that they were bones from the dead fetus.
Then I cleansed the wound, and extracted many bones from him, the woman being in her menses; and she lived in such a manner for a long time, discharging a little pus.
And I did not consider this to be strange, but because in this there is science and help, so that the skillful physician administers care by hand.
Of the forms of the instruments that are necessary to extract the fetus.
The form of the incision by which the mother is opened:
This is the form of a constrictor in which the membranes are grasped, in which grasping there are two incisions at the two ends of two shafts. However, this incision should be more subtle than a constrictor, and be made of ivory or boxwood.
And let the width of each shaft be about two fingers, and the thickness of each about one finger, and the length of each is a palm and a half; and in the middle space of the two shafts are two fittings of the same wood which are fixed, of which the length is half a palm and a little more, and the width of each is about two fingers, or a little more.
And these two additions are inserted into the mouth of the womb so that it is opened with them when you turn the two prescribed incisions.
Another form similar to that one, but more subtle and lighter:
Let it be made of ivory or boxwood, in the likeness of forceps. However, at its extremity are two additions like tongs, and the length of these additions is about a palm, and the width of each is two fingers.
And when you wish to open the womb with them, then you make the woman lie on the bed with her legs hanging down, that which is between her thighs open. And then open your hand with the instrument, as you would with scissors, gradually, according to how much you want to open the mouth of the womb until the womb does what you want.
The form of vertigo which the ancients described:
The form of the instrument with which the fetus is expelled:
The method/instrument of manipulation with which a large head is countered/managed.  (The "2" likely indicates a textual annotation or variant reading, not part of the original text.)
And it resembles forceps which have teeth at the end, like tongs, and sometimes it is made long like forceps according to this form, like tongs, which have teeth like saw teeth, with which it is incised and managed. The form of a small instrument/tool.
The form of a hook having a spine/point.
The form of a hook having two spines/points.
The form of a spatula having two ends/extremities with which the head is separated/cut.
The form of two wide spatulas.
All those instruments are exercised, and when the types of those are more multiplied and prepared by the artisans, then it is easier in its operation and more valuable to men because of its quantity/number.
And do not omit any of those instruments already prepared by you, for the necessity of them is not excusable.
Of the extraction of the afterbirth.
When the afterbirth is retained after childbirth, then you should order the patient to hold her breath, and then make her sneeze forcefully, and hold your hand over her mouth and nose, and if it is expelled by this, it is good.
And if not, then you take a pot and pierce a hole in the lid and put in it herbs, opening the mother's mouth; thus [use]  chamomile, rue,  anise, chamomile, Arabic gum, cassia lignea, and centaury. All these herbs, or some of them, should be submerged in water in the pot, and place that on the fire.
And then place a reed cannula in the mother's mouth, and hold it there until the vapor reaches the mother's womb.
And then make her sneeze as we have said, and the afterbirth will be expelled quickly.
But if this treatment remains ineffective and it is not expelled, then you instruct the midwife to submerge her left hand in sesame oil or mallow poultice, and then insert it into the vagina and search for the afterbirth with it; and when she has found it, then take it and remove it little by little. But if it is attached to the womb of the mother, then she should insert her hand as we have recommended, and when she has found the afterbirth, extract it little by little as instructed, so that the mother does not faint from the strong traction. Furthermore, it is necessary that it be turned to the right and left sides easily.
And if the mother's mouth is constricted, we have already recommended treatment with sneezing and herbal oil medication.
But if it is not expelled by all the means we have recommended, then be careful not to tire yourself with repeated attempts at extraction; however, it is necessary that what has come out of her into the mother's mouth be tied to the woman's genitals, and then cauterize it with ointment and tetrapharmacon; for that will cause it to fester for a few days and it will be dissolved and expelled.
But when it festers, a foul odor rises to the head and stomach, and this harms the patient; and then it is necessary that fumigations suitable for this be administered.
But some of the Ancients already tested fumigations of henbane and dried figs.
Method of using the instrument with which a woman is fumigated for the retention of menstrual blood and afterbirth:
Let it be made of glass or brass.
And let the narrow end be placed in the vagina and the wide end over the fire, and the fumigation be placed on the embers of the fire.
And let her hold it until that fumigation is consumed and then repeat with another.
Concerning the treatment of an imperforate anus in a child.
Many children are born and their anuses are not perforated, which are very narrow and obstructed. Then it is necessary for the midwife to perforate that narrow passage with her finger; and if not, perforate it with a sharp instrument, and be careful not to touch the rectum.
Then place wool soaked in wine and oil on it; and then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
But if you fear that it is obstructed, then place a cannula in the opening for several days, and remove it when the child wants to defecate.
And if anal obstruction occurs due to the consolidation of a wound or abscess; then it is necessary that this consolidation be incised, and then be treated with what we have said about the treatment and the lead [likely referring to lead-based ointments].
Concerning the treatment of fistulas that develop below [presumably, below the surface or in the anal region].
Fistulas that develop in the lowest part below are knotty and thick, which develop near the anus externally or in the space between the parts [likely referring to the space between the buttocks].
And it is one fistula or several.
And when that knot is old and discharges a watery white humidity or subtle pus, and sometimes some of these fistulas are penetrating.
And those penetrating ones are known because what comes out of them is accompanied by flatulence; and sometimes the patient suffers from flatulence, and worms easily come out of them.
And sometimes these fistulas penetrate into the space,  into the bladder, and into the urethra; and some penetrate into the hip joint and into the buttock.
And what distinguishes a fistula penetrating into the rectum from one that does not penetrate is that you insert your finger into the rectum, and insert a thin probe of brass or iron into the fistula when there is no tortuosity.
But if there is tortuosity in it, then insert a thin probe of lead or horsehair until you feel the probe or hair on your finger.
And if you do not feel it at all, nor does any matter, worms, or flatulence emerge from the opening, as we have said, then know that it is non-penetrating, and then attend to its cure.
And when the fistula penetrates into the bladder or into the urethra, then its indication is thus: the urine from it and prohibition of it so that the area is consolidated with medicine.
But if it penetrates into the joint of the hip or into the bone and causes pain in the surrounding area, then its sign is that the probe penetrates there if there is no tortuosity in the bone, and pain in the surrounding area; and that suppuration always occurs from it; and that medication is of no use, nor is it consolidated with ointment.
And in all those penetrating fistulas there is no certain cure, and the cure of those is the labor and vanity of foolish physicians upon which they are fixed.
But in that which is not penetrating and not old, healing with iron is hoped for, as I shall relate to you, and this I have already proven.
And it is that the patient lies between your hands on his back and raises his legs, his thighs being inclined towards his belly, and then insert a lead or bronze probe, if there is tortuosity in the fistula, until you know the place where the probe penetrates.
And if the patient feels pain around the anus, then you should insert your finger into the anus.
And if you feel with your finger the probe already discovered by itself penetrating, besides what you feel between your finger and that abscess or flesh, then you know for certain that this is penetrating; and then do not work on that, for there is no healing in that, as we have said.
However, some would say that it is healed slowly in some men.
And of the medication by which help is hoped for him, it is that you ignite a fine cautery according to the width of the fistula, as has been explained before, and insert that ignited cautery into the fistula until it reaches the anus; and then repeat this two or three times until you know that all those fistulated, fleshy parts resembling the quill of a bird's feather are cauterized.
And then treat it with poultices wrapped in linen until all the cauterized flesh sloughs away, and then treat it with medicines that generate and consolidate flesh, and if it is healed, it is good; and if not, then it will not be healed at any time by any other treatment.
And if the probe enters, but does not penetrate beyond your finger which is in the anus, and between that and the probe there is a thick layer of flesh or abscess, and you see the fistula in such a way that it reaches the surface of the skin, then dry the skin from the beginning of the fistula, and you will see it dry with the probe, and let it be in the fistula until the incision reaches the place where the end of the probe arrives, and through the probe it is released and removed.
And then cleanse those fistulated fleshy parts which resemble a bird's quill, and let no part of them remain.
But if you see a flow of blood come between you and your work when you cauterize those tissues, then the best and lightest instrument is to cauterize with fire or with a sharp medicine, because cauterization with fire achieves two good effects: that is, the cauterization of those affected tissues and the staunching of blood and drying of the humors.
And then treat it with poultices wrapped in linen or crushed flax until the place is clean, and then treat the wound with ointments that generate and consolidate hard flesh.
And these are medicines in which there is stypticity and drying; when then it is restored it is healed and we do not fear a recurrence.
But if the fistula penetrates to the anus and is elongated from the surface of the body, then insert your finger into the anus and examine it with that.
And so if you feel the fistula and between you and it there is a veil of fat or flesh, and it is close to penetration, then there is no operation there except by way of trust and hope.
Which cause is to be treated in one of three ways:  either cauterize it as we have said; or dry it until you reach its cavity so that it is possible for you to introduce the poultices and the nearby cure; and do not proceed much with incision lest you cut the muscle containing the anus, and that may happen to the patient thus without his will; and then treat it with what we have said for it will be healed quickly; or to lengthen that veil and clean it after drying it near the anus, as we have said, either with a probe or with another instrument of sharp extremity, and then cleanse those fistulous parts which are in the incision where you can with cauterization; and then strive to make the restoration of the whole wound with incision, and if the orifice above is not consolidated, and the fistula remains open in the part of the anus, it will be easier for the patient. And sometimes the fistula ends in this way:  when you insert the probe into the fistula, and it is in the side of the anus around the surface of the body with the tail and in the margin of the anus, then take a probe with a perforated end, which is like a needle for preparing hides in this form:
and insert it into that fistula wrapped in five threads or around them; and then insert a probe with a thread into the fistula until you reach its cavity.
But if it is penetrating into the margin of the anus further inside, then you extract the thread from that hole so that you insert your finger into the anus; and extract the end of the thread and join the two ends together, and tighten each, and leave it for a day or two, and when you further cut the thread into the flesh, tighten it well until those parts of flesh are cut which are between the two ends of the thread and that they fall away.
And then treat the wound until it is consolidated and healed.
But if the opening of the fistula is not penetrating, then make it penetrate, in whatever way is prepared for you, except that it should be very carefully done, for it is not for you to do this so that you do not cut the muscle; and then treat it until it is healed.
The form of a pointed probe with which the fistula is probed: its curvature is very sharp and the other part is not sharp, so that you do not cut what is not necessary, as sometimes happens.
Of the suturing of hemorrhoids from which blood flows in the incision of those.
Hemorrhoids are of two kinds, for either they are between the buttocks similar to charcoal, or they are like bunches of grapes. And of these there are small and large ones, and the blood flows from them constantly and it is one, and there are many, and they are outside the anus, and at its extremities.
However, those that are outside the anus are according to the months of little humidity, from which flows a citrine liquid or a little blood with continuous flow, and they are according to the color of the body.
And the treatment of that which is inside the anus is that you command the patient to sit and strain until the anus protrudes and the hemorrhoids appear to you. Then you carefully grasp and suspend them with hooks or hold them with your fingernail, and then incise them to their roots.
But if the hooks cannot hold them because of their humidity and softness, then grasp them with rough cloth or cotton or a pledget of wool, and extract them with your fingers, and then incise them and sprinkle on them some hot powder near the incision, so that it acts on them in place of cautery; or cauterize them as is described in the chapter on cauterization. And then treat them with the other treatments until they are healed.
And if the anus does not obey [the command to] protrude, then stimulate the patient with a small, mildly irritating clyster, and let it be washed with that water which is in the anus and which lightly obeys [the command to] protrude when the patient strains.
But if the hemorrhoids are outside the anus, then their cause is slight, and it is that you grasp them with your fingernail, or that you grasp them with a hook, and incise them, and then treat them with what we have said until they are healed.
And that which you have incised, it is necessary to suture it in this manner: take enveloped thread and insert it into a needle and then bring the hemorrhoids together from the upper parts, and make it penetrate with the needle at the root of the other part, and wrap the two ends of the thread in the lowermost part of the needle, and it should be latitudinally [i.e., horizontally]; and tighten the hemorrhoid with a strong suture, and then knot the thread and remove the needle.
And do this to all [the hemorrhoids], and leave one of them unstitched, so that the superfluous blood may flow from it.
And then place on the anus a cloth soaked in rose oil or cerate; and place that on the anus and command the patient to rest. And then leave it until it falls off; and when it has fallen off, treat it with ointments or with another cure until it is healed.
And since they are old and that medicine is not effective, then it is necessary that you scrape them with the point of a spatula or with your fingernail until they are made moist and the crust above is removed, which prevents their consolidation; and then treat them until they are consolidated.
Then remove them with a more vigorous scraping than the first, until much blood flows and they are excoriated; and then treat them until they are healed.
Know that a whitlow, that is, a felon, is nothing but a round sore, according to the color of the body, similar to the head of a clove, and it is found throughout the body and especially in the parts below the feet and fingers, and because of them pain occurs from the swelling.
And then it is necessary that what is in the circumference of the felon be incised, and it should be held with forceps or a hook, and eradicated from its root; and then treat it.
And if you wish, cauterize it according to what has been previously described in its chapter.
Moreover, a wart is a small, rough, fistulated, round eminence on the surface of the body, and often appears on the hands of children.
And its cure is that you spread and incise it, or that you bind it tightly with thread or with a skin so that it falls off. And if you wish, cauterize that, as we have said, with fire or with a sharp medicine.
Moreover, a mole is a small, hairy or fistulated lump on the surface of the body, often occurring on the face; and when friction encounters it, it is felt like the biting of an ant, and it is found all over the body.
And its cure is that you take a cannula of goose quill or vulture quill, and let it be strong, and place that over the mole so that the circle of the cannula contains the parts of it; and then revolve your hand with the cannula until you incise that which is in the circumference of the mole, and place that into the depth of the flesh, and so eradicate the mole from its root.
And if you wish, do this with a brass or iron cannula according to this method:
Let the upper part of the cannula be drawn out to a thinness, blunt (that is, not perforated), wrapped so that on the said [mole] the apprehension of it may be avoided and its revolution [around the mole] [may be performed smoothly].
And if you wish, cauterize the mole as is previously mentioned in the cauterization of athel in the chapter on cautery.
Concerning the form of the instruments that are used to give a clyster.
Sometimes a clyster is made of silver, or of latten (brass), or of molten or hammered brass; and sometimes it is made of those instruments, small and large, according to those to whom they are administered, for that which is administered in the treatment of small children should be small; and for those whose buttocks are fragile or painful, the clysters for them should be small.
The form of a large and a small clyster:
The head of the cannula above, to which the bag is tied, should be wide in this manner; and let there be a distinction where the bag is tied, as you see.
And the lower extremity, which is inserted into the rectum, should be blunt (that is, not open) very smooth, tending towards subtlety; and on one side of it there should be two holes, and on the other side one hole, and let the width of the hole be according to the thickness of the rays and a little larger.
And let the bag in which the medicines are placed be of animal bladder or sheepskin, and let its length be one palm.
And let it be perforated with many holes, as it is rolled; and let the space which is between the holes be the thickness of a finger.
Then insert into those holes strong, raw flax thread, about ten threads, or thereabouts; and fasten the bag with it; and when the bag is placed in him, bind it tightly at the head of the clyster with two distinct strong constrictions, and then cauterize each hole with it: But the way to cauterize with this is that you fill the bag with the medicine, which should be heated according to the patient's tolerance; and be careful that it is neither too hot nor too cold.
Then let the patient lie supine on his back, and raise his legs and place a cushion underneath him, on which are placed men or a sheet; and then anoint the end of the clyster with oil or egg white or fenugreek mucilage or the like; and then insert it into the rectum easily, and then the attendant should take the bag and squeeze it with two hands and vigorously until all that is in the clyster is evacuated into the bowel; and then remove the clyster and the patient lowers his legs.
And if the medicine forces him thus, hold it as long as he can; and if he sleeps with it all night, it is more beneficial.
But if you use this clyster for diseases of diarrhea and its expulsion hurts him, then you repeat the cautery until he is healed.
And if there are hemorrhoids or painful abscesses in the anus, then let the clyster be very thin and soft, of the kind with which infants are clystered.
On the treatment of wounds.
I have already said in the division on the treatment of wounds what was appropriate for the book, and I say thus the treatment of those with hand and with medicines according to what is fitting.
Therefore I say that wounds are diversified according to what wounds are made with and according to the place on which the wounds fall.
And the causes for which wounds are often made are thus:  a stone throw, or a cut from a sword or knife, or a blow with a lance, or with a stick, or with an arrow, or similar things from many causes.
But the wounds that are in the parts of the body are such as a wound which falls upon the head, or the neck, or the feet, or the belly, or the thigh, and similar to those of the other limbs.
And I am recounting the treatment of some wounds so that you may apply that reasoning and rule to other wounds.
And I will begin with simple head wounds, for the discussion of compound wounds will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
Therefore I say that when a simple wound occurs on the head and there is no fracture, then consider: if it is from a stone throw or the like, and it has only grazed the scalp and is a large wound, and you fear the occurrence of a hot abscess in that patient, then immediately attend to him and perform phlebotomy of the cephalic vein, and do not delay this; and draw blood accordingly, according to the strength of the patient, unless some cause prohibits phlebotomy, especially if the blood that has issued from the wound is scant.
And let the phlebotomy be on the opposite side from the wounded part; and guard the patient from repletion and from wine and from heavy foods.
But if some cause prohibits bloodletting, then let his food be reduced, and let him not approach meat or wine.
And place on the wound, if a hot abscess occurs in him, a pledget soaked in plain rose oil or in wine in which a styptic has been dissolved.
But if there is certainty of a hot abscess, then place on the wound, if it is recent, its own blood and, if the air has not changed it, the powder which I shall shortly mention.
And if the air has already changed it, then apply some ointment until it is healed.
But if the wound is large or is from a sword cut or the like, and its lips are not properly approximated, then approximate them with sutures according to the method of suturing which I shall describe.
But if the wound has already bared the bone and hangs, and there is no retention of it but a slight suspension, then incise it and then treat the wound with medicines and restore the flesh in place of the bone, and order the patient to be fed on foods lacking coarseness: heads and fine cooked meats and similar things, until it is healed.
And if you find putrefaction in the bone and it does not adhere to the bone, then you incise all that which is rotten and remove it, and then treat it.
But if in these wounds there is an artery or vein from which a flow of blood may occur, and it is not stopped by medicines, then you should investigate the artery, and if you find it uncut, then you should cut it with a spatula, or tie it; and if necessity requires that what we have said is not sufficient, then you cauterize until the bleeding is stopped.
And if these wounds are simple and small, then their cause is light; therefore you should sprinkle this powder on them, for it consolidates them before the air alters them.
And the manner of making the powder is this: take olive oil, one part; dragon's blood, two parts; unslaked lime, three parts; let it all be well ground and sifted, and with it let the wound be filled, and let it be bound with a good bandage until it adheres well to it, and is coagulated with the blood.
And then bind it above with lint and leave it, and do not unbind it while it is thus, unless it becomes inflamed, for the medicine is not removed from it until it is healed.
And sometimes only heat does this, when you do not have olive oil and dragon's blood at hand.
And do this same operation on large wounds when it is necessary to apply it to them and they are fresh and bleeding wounds which the air has not altered.
And if the air has altered them, and especially if it is summertime, then this powder is not suitable; but rather treat them with what we have said, so that you apply some digestive ointments to them, or apply a powder of barley flour with water and honey until they discharge pus; and then treat them with the other treatment until they are healed.
But if a fracture of the bone occurs with the wound, and it is small, then extract it with forceps.
And I will describe the treatment of head fractures in what follows.
Of the wounds of the neck.
But if the wound occurs in the neck, then there is no difference in medication between it and a simple wound of the head.
But if the nerves of the neck or an artery are cut, then if it is a nerve, there is no other remedy but to avoid treating it with anything that causes strong astringency, such as vitriol and similar things, because it is harmful to the nerves and contracts them. And do not apply anything cold to the wound, because the substance of the nerves is cold and its continuation is with the brain, which is the highest of all the members.
And if it is cured with light medicines, such as washing with fresh water, sometimes infused with rose oil or plain oil, and then cleaned with fresh water and other minor remedies in this manner, and moist ointments.
But if the wound is large, then administer sutures, or draw the edges together, and then treat it with powders until it is healed.
But if the wound is deep, or if there is pus in the lowest part of it, then perforate it at the lowest point.
But if an artery is incised in the wound and there is a flow of blood, then separate or dry it, or tie it off, or cauterize it if necessity requires it.
But if the vertebrae of the neck are already incised, or some of them, and the veins of the neck are saved, then you adjust the edges of the wound with sutures on the neck cane and do not touch it; first level it and return it to its natural shape, and then tighten it with a decent bandage, and leave it for some days; and then treat it with ointments which have styptic and healing properties until it is healed.
But if the wound has caused damage to the bone, then cauterize it, and then if there are bone fragments in it, extract all those that you can; and what you are not able to remove, leave it until the wound suppurates, and is separated and the damage is relieved.
And if the wound is recent, then sprinkle on it the powder which has been recommended to you. But if a fistula has formed in the wound, then treat it with that which will be recalled in its chapter.
If it is a wound from a lance or knife, and you see its depth, then consider further if there is a venting of air from the wound when the patient breathes; then know that the wound is mortal.
And if it is not deep and the wound is fresh with its blood, then you should put powder on it in the first hour, and do not bind it tightly so that the blood is not retained in its depth and returns to the heart and kills the patient, but put attractive ointment on it, and unbind it twice a day.
And if you do not have ointment, then place old linen on the opening of the wound so that it draws out the humidity; and make the patient sleep on the wound so that what is contained within flows out.
But if three days or more have passed since the wound and it does not cause the patient spasms, or tremor of the heart, or constriction of the throat, and you see the other good dispositions of him, then know that the wound is safe; and then treat it with cauldrons [likely a misspelling or archaic term for a type of poultice or dressing] and with other treatment until it is healed.
But if its healing is delayed, and it remains open for a long time, then know that a fistula has formed; therefore treat that according to its chapter [i.e., according to the instructions in another section of the text].
And if the wound is from an incision of a sword or knife, and is simple on the surface of the foot or back, then treat it with what is preceded by suture, if it is large, or with powder, if it is small.
But if it has caused damage to the bone, and pieces have been detached from it, then you must clean the wound and attempt to extract those pieces, if they are separated. But if they are not separated, then leave them until the wound is cleaned, so that their extraction is facilitated.
And for other accidental wounds in other limbs, the method of treatment is the same as what we have described.
Of the wounds of the abdomen.
The illness which happens in the abdomen is either great, or small, or moderate.
And a small rupture is treated differently, and it is such that its reduction is more difficult, if you do not take care of its replacement immediately, because it opens and swells, making its reintroduction difficult.
Therefore, the best [type of] rupture is moderate, because in that case the reduction of the intestine is not difficult, as it is in the two previously mentioned types.
And know that the suturing of the abdomen is done in four ways, but two sutures are common and suitable for suturing other wounds of the body.
And two other sutures are peculiar [to the abdomen],  communicating with other wounds, but nevertheless they are more proper for the suturing of the abdomen.
And I recount to you each one with explanation and clarification.
Therefore I say that when the wound is small and some part of the intestine has emerged through it, and it is difficult to reduce it, then this is in one of two ways: either because of the smallness of the rupture as we have said, or because the intestine has become inflamed due to the coldness of the air.
And therefore, when this is so, then it is necessary that you warm it in such a way that you submerge a sponge or cloth moistened in lukewarm water alone, or that you boil in water  squill, cyperus, and spikenard, and bathe the intestine with it until the inflammation is resolved.
And sometimes this is done with a liquid which has astringent properties, and it is better than water alone in resolving the inflammation.
And then, when you see the inflammation to be resolved, then you moisten the intestine with water in which mallow and marsh-mallow have been boiled, for by this the entry of it is eased with little effort.
But if the return of it is hindered despite this treatment, then incise the rupture a little with an instrument with which hemorrhoids are incised.
And the first treatment is better, when it is appropriate that there is no incision, and there is no need to worry about drying due to necessity and debility.
Concerning the instrument, this is its form:
One part of it is sharply curved, and the other part not-sharp, and the extremity is thin, and not with the thinness of a spatula, rather it should be slightly blunt.
And therefore, when the wound is widened and the intestine protrudes, then its reduction should follow its natural form, into its proper place, if possible in this way, for it is better.
But when the rupture is large, and is in the lower part of the abdomen, then you should make the patient lie on his back, and raise his legs higher than his head; and if it is in the upper part of the abdomen, then you should raise his head and feet higher than the lower parts.
And similarly, if the rupture is in one of the two sides of the abdomen, then always direct your attention and consideration to ensuring that the side where the wound is located is higher than the other.
And thus you should administer this in large wounds and in medium-sized wounds.
And in small wounds, place what you have prepared, and then have the assistant gently place his hands between yours, who will hold the entire rupture with his hand and adjust its lips, and then cover that from that, so that some other cause of the suture is nearby.
And this is the common method of suturing: one in which you take the needle, or a number of needles according to the size of the wound; and then, leaving the extremity of the rupture of the annular finger, and tighten one needle, so that you do not put thread in the two ends of the suture, with two ends of the thread that is under the suture of the inner parts, until you make it penetrate that part; and you have now added two ends of the suture and two ends of the thread, and this makes four orders (or layers).
Then tighten with double thread in the circuit of the needle, and sometimes from two sides together, and then bring together the two lips and the wound by decent approximation; and then leave the thickness of a finger and insert another needle into that, and then tie that with thread as you did with the first needle; and do not cease doing this if necessary with the needles until you have completed the entire closing of the wound.
And let the needles be medium between thickness and thinness, for thin needles very easily cut the flesh; and thick ones are difficult to insert into the suture, and therefore it is necessary that they be medium in thinness and thickness.
And it is not necessary that the needle be inserted too deeply into the two ends of the suture, so that the flesh is not lightly incised and the wound does not open before its consolidation.
And let the sutures not be prolonged, lest the wound be hindered from consolidation.
Then cut the ends of the needles so that they do not harm the patient during their sleep; and you shall place over the suture finely powdered material from every part, which will hold the ends of the needles; and leave those until you know that the wound is already consolidated.
And this type of suture with needles in what manner is most convenient in small wounds, because in the suture of those, one needle or two or around those will suffice.
But the second suture is common: and it is that you stitch the four ends, of the wound and two ends of the lip, at once, with a needle around which thread is wrapped equally in fineness and thickness.
And then, when with the needle you have penetrated these four ends, return the needle to the same part from which you began, so that the drawn thread falls from the highest part to the wound, so that the suture is like a cloth suture with which cloths are tightened.
And place between each suture the amount of the thickness of the little finger.
And this suture men know.  (or: And this suture is known to men.)
And with such a suture I sewed up the wound which had happened to a man in his belly, who had been wounded with a knife, and the disruption of the wound was greater than a palm, and two palms of intestine had come out around the middle of the wound, and the disruption was in the middle of the member; and then I reduced it after the intestine had been outside the wound for twenty-four hours.
And the wound was consolidated in the space of fifteen days or thereabouts, and I cured him and he is healed; and after that he lived for many years, and is preserved in his faculties (or abilities).
And the other physicians had judged that he would not be healed; and it was by a miracle, because I did not cure him with ointment, for it was in a place where ointment was not found nor any medicine, but I placed old linen on the wound twice a day and washed it frequently with honey water until it was healed.
But I will describe two kinds of sutures proper according to the account of Paraula (or Paulus; possibly referring to a medical authority).
And it is that you begin with the suture of the co-dena (likely a type of stitch or suture; the word is unclear), and insert the needle from the outside part to the inside part.
And then, as the needle penetrates the co-dena and that same laceration, according to the straightness and length of the whole body (or wound), leave the end of the thread in which you have inserted the needle; and make the needle penetrate at the other end from the inside part to the outside part at the other end of the wound.
And then, when you have made that penetration, then you make it penetrate again at that same end of the wound from the outside part to the inside part; and leave the end of the thread that is at this point, and make the needle penetrate at the other end from the inside part to the outside part.
And make it penetrate with that penetration with which you make it penetrate into the thread at the end of the wound which is on his side until all of it penetrates.
And then begin from that same side and sew that with the end of the thread on the other side, and extract the needle from the co-dena which it penetrated, and then return it into that co-dena and sew the end of the thread that is on the other side with this end of the wound; and extract it from the co-dena which is on his side.
And do this once and again, and do this one time then another time until you sew all that is outside according to that example.
And the sum of this manner of suture is that you sew with a leather-worker's stitch, with which one sews hides, in such a way that you sew the thread one time from the side of the end of the co-dena, and that you leave it another time until you have completed it.
But the second type of suture, which you properly call *Gualia*, and this is spoken of by him and recounted by him, is that you sew it according to the similarity with which some medicant sews it, so that you join each part to its corresponding part conveniently by nature; and apply the end of one side and the end of the wound to the other end of the side, and this is done as I have recounted to you.
So that you put the needle into the end of the wound near you on the outside part, and make it penetrate to the inside part in that sole place, and leave two ends of the thread; and then turn the needle and make it penetrate from outside to inside in the two ends of the thread.
And then turn each of them, and make each penetrate from the inside part to the outside part in two other ends of the wound that are on the opposite side.
And this manner of suture is better than the common, light suture, and it is the suture of which I previously made mention.
This is the discourse of Gualia.
And moreover, some say, the suture of the belly is rectified with two needles, that is, that you insert into each of them a thread, and begin with the insertion of the needle from the side nearest to you, and make it penetrate to the other side, according to the suture of those who sew hides similarly.
And know that when the rupture is in the middle of the belly, then its suture is more difficult than in other parts of the belly.
But the judgment of the medication of a plague is like the judgment of other plagues.
The reason is that when you treat a fresh wound with its blood, before the air alters it, and you reduce the intestine and sew it and dress it properly, then apply an incarnative powder to it.
And if the air has already altered the wound, then apply some ointments which are at your disposal until they form a hard scab and the threads fall out and are consolidated, such as ciphac and myrrh; and then treat it as you would treat other wounds until it is healed.
But if you do not have those medicines at hand, then apply immediately, as soon as it begins to discharge pus, old lint, and change that twice a day, as you have been taught, until it is healed, because you will not need other medication in many instances when the wounds are simple.
But if you fear that the wound will spread infection to the principal limbs, then you should submerge lion's wool in good quality steeped oil, or in rose oil, and place this in the area around the armpits and under the arms.
And if you feel pain or putrefaction in their bowels, because this often happens, then cauterize it with dark, tepid, styptic wine, especially if the putrefaction has reached the intestine and made a penetrating exit into its cavity.
And know that that which is in the large intestine is of easier healing than that which is in the small intestines.
And it is of difficult healing because the intestine which is called "jejunum" does not receive healing from a wound that falls upon it at all; and this is because of the great multitude of veins that are in it and because of the magnitude of those that are in it, and because of the subtlety of the body of that, and because of the proximity of that to the nature of the nerves.
But if that which proceeds from the wound is the web [likely referring to a membrane or tissue], and you obtain that recently, reduce it according to your skill with which you reduce the intestines similarly.
But if it has passed into the space and has already become green or black, then bind it with gall over the place that is blackened by it, so that a flow of blood may come, for in the web are veins and arteries.
And then incise that which is beyond that ligament, and place two ends of the gall hanging from the part below the wound outside it, so that the attraction of it towards the falling of the web and the emission of the arm of the wound may be relieved for you.
A recollection/reminder of wounds when they happen in the intestine.
When a disruption occurs in the intestine and it is small, then it is possible that it may be restored in some men, because of this, for I saw one who had been wounded in his belly with a lance thrust and the wound was on the right side of the stomach, and the wound was ancient and had become a fistula, and from it issued gesticulation and flatulence.
Then I pursued his cure, although I was not confident in his healing, but I continued to refine the treatment until he was healed and the place was consolidated (healed completely).
And I, since I saw the place already consolidated, feared for the patient that an accident of illness might befall him in his belly; and no such ill accident happened, and he remained in his usual good condition eating and drinking, and then he entered a bath and exercised his limbs.
And some experienced people say that when a wound occurs in the intestine, and it is small, then it should be tied in this manner:  you take ants with large heads; then bring together the two lips of the wound and place one of those ants, with its mouth open, over the two lips of the wound; then, when it bites and clenches its mouth, cut off its head, because it adheres and does not come undone.
Then place another ant next to the first, and do not cease doing this with ants, one next to the other, according to the size of the entire wound.
Then sew up that area and close the wound; and let those attached heads remain in the intestine until the intestine is healed; and no harm will come to the patient.
And it is also possible that the intestine be tied with fine thread which is made from the intestine of an animal, since it is easier to thread; and it is that you take the end of these intestinal threads, and it is well cleaned, and then tie its end with a thread, wrapped, and then insert that threaded needle and sew the intestine with it, and then reduce it into the rupture.
And this method of suturing with ants is only a matter of trust and hope.
But if the wound is large and wide, especially if it is in one of the small intestines, then it is only a reduction, and not a complete healing of it.
Concerning the treatment of a fistula and its formation (or: Concerning the healing of a fistula).
Know that every wound and abscess, when it ages and becomes old, and becomes an ulcer, and is not consolidated and discharges pus continually and is not excised, then, in whatever limb it may be, it is universally called a fistula, and we call it *azukem*. (Note: "azukem" seems to be a word specific to this text, possibly a variant or local term for fistula).
And a fistula, truly speaking, is a hardened, white, knotted swelling, without pain, and which has a concavity like the concavity of a bird's claw; and for this reason it is called a gnarled ulcer, that is, claw-like.
And in some men it is moist, discharging pus; and very quickly the moisture is excised (or, removed) in a few hours. And sometimes this moisture is thick, and sometimes it is thin, and sometimes it is coarse, and sometimes it is subtle (or fine).
I have already shown all those causes, and their signs, and their cure with medicines, in the division (of the treatise).
And it is fitting that I should make known to you the treatment of fistula, which is done by way of operation with the hand.
And know that fistulas occur in all the members of the body; for there are fistulas which reach the large veins and arteries, or the nerves, or the diaphragm, or the intestine, or the bladder, or one of the ribs, or one of the vertebrae of the back, or one of the joints composed by composition, such as those of the hand and foot; and those which damage the proximity of the principal member and similar things.
Therefore, that one of these fistulas which is according to this manner is among the illnesses of difficult healing, and does not receive a cure, and occupation with it is labor and ignorance.
And if it is one of the fistulas whose depth does not reach those places that I have mentioned, and you hope and trust in its cure, and wish to arrive at knowledge of it, then take a probe of brass or iron, and if the fistula goes straight, and search for it with that.
But if the fistula is tortuous, then investigate it with a probe of fine lead, for lead, with the lightness of its body, is easily bent around the tortuosity.
And if the fistula has very horrible twists and turns, it is not possible for you to probe it.
Then, inject a clyster into the opening, for the moisture with which you inject it will go through the other openings and clean them out.
And then inquire carefully, in whatever way is possible for you to know if there are bones or nerves here, and if the depth of the fistula is distant or near, or if it is a fistula which has many openings, and stay on this entirely with the sum of your strength, with your questioning, with which you question the patient, and the discovery of the pain through your compression with the hand on the place, and similar signs and accidental causes to the abscess.
And when you have considered all those causes with true judgment, then proceed to the treatment with confidence: that is, you consider then if it is a fistula near the surface or in a safe place, far from a joint, or from a nerve, or from an artery, or from a vein, or from one of the places which I have told you.
Then you dry the fistula as was said before in the description of it, and remove what is in that filtration and of corrupted flesh, and that which has grown in the opening of flesh or skin and similar things, and treat it until it is healed.
But if the fistula is of great depth, and is straight, then it is necessary that you incise it in the front as much as is possible for you, and then cleanse it of all its corrupted flesh; and then administer cauteries wrapped in sharp medicines, and introduce them into the depth of the fistula, which you have grasped with an instrument (iron).
And do this several times until the sharp medicine corrodes all that is rotten in the depth of the fistula from the corruption.
And then restore it with ointments which generate healthy flesh until it is healed.
But if it is not healed by this, then you cauterize it as we have recounted.
But if the cause of the fistula is bone and you are certain of this, then you should investigate it and dry it as we have recounted, if you do not prohibit any cause from a vein or nerve or principal member as we have said.
But if the bone is exposed to you and there is some corruption and blackness in it, then you scrape it until all the corruption is removed; and then treat it with something that will cause it to grow new flesh until it is healed.
And if it is not healed and discharges pus as it did before, then know that you have not reached the complete eradication of the corruption; and then uncover it again and meticulously perform the scraping and cleansing with your utmost strength, and then restore it.
And so if it is healed, good; and if not, then know that that corruption is in the deep recesses of the body, which has not been reached, and then for you in that case there is nothing to do but leave it.
And if the corrupted bone is small, or it is possible for you to remove it, then you remove it with fine forceps which are suitable for this.
And if there are many bones, then meticulously remove all of them, and do not leave any behind with your best effort.
But if some of the moist tissues impede you, and there is no fear or mistake in cutting into them, then incise those ligaments or flesh if they are present, and free the bones.
But if you are not ready to remove the bones at this time, then apply something to the wound that will rot the wound, and leave it until it has reached the surrounding bones, flesh, and ligaments, and keep the wound from closing, and keep the incision that you made during your operation constricted.
Furthermore, if you are hesitant, place on it a cloth soaked in crushed herbs with oil, or a cloth soaked in Egyptian ointment, or in any of the green ointments, for when those ligaments rot, and the bones are separated from them, their removal and extraction is facilitated.
But if it is a large bone, such as a leg bone or thigh bone or similar, and only its surface is corrupted, then scrape that with a rasp only superficially until that blackness and corruption is removed, and then restore the wound.
But if the corrupted part is large, and the corruption has already reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to cut away all of it until the place where the corruption has reached is excised, and then treat it until it is healed.
And I recount to you what happened to a man in his thigh so that you may use it as an example and aid in your operation.
There was a young man, about thirty years old, who suffered pain in his thigh, and from the inner parts, a morbid matter spread through the body until that matter reached his thigh; and it was the matter of an abscess, with a large abscess, and there was no external cause for it.
And then time passed with it due to the error of the physicians, until the abscess was opened, and much matter flowed from it, and its treatment was delayed until the leg was fistulated, and there were many orifices in it, all of which discharged pus and the humors of the body.
And then many physicians treated him for about two years, and there was no improvement in his condition, until I was called.
And I saw his leg and the matter flowing from those orifices in great quantity; and the body of that man was completely weakened, and his complexion was yellow (citrine).
And then I inserted a probe into one of those orifices and it reached the bone.
And then I quickly examined all the orifices and found that they extended to all parts of the leg.
Then I carefully incised one of those orifices until I exposed a part of the bone, and I found it corrupted, and it was already eroded, corrupted and blackened; and a part of the leg was corrupted, so that it had penetrated to the marrow.
And then I sawed away what was revealed to me and prepared of the exposed bone.
And I believed that in the bone there was only that corruption which I excised and sawed away, and I had already eradicated it.
And then I applied the restoration of the wound with consolidative medicine for a long time, and it did not heal.
And then I iterated and uncovered the bone a second time, over the first uncovering, and I found continuing corruption in the bone.
And I sawed away what appeared to me of that corruption, and then I was frustrated in making its cure and restoration, and it was not restored.
And then I uncovered it again and did not cease to incise the bone little by little, piece by piece, and I forced its restoration, and it was not restored until I incised about a palm's breadth of it, and that I extracted with its marrow, and then I restored that with medicines, and it was lightly consolidated and healed.
And further iteration in its operation and section is not necessary except for the disposition of its weakness and for the smallness of its tolerance and fear of death, for syncope afflicted it at all hours because of the superfluity of evacuation.
And therefore it is healed by a complete healing, and nothing is in place of the hard bone flesh; and its disposition in its body is made good and its strength returned; and it is converted to its dispositions and did not cause it impediment in walking nor harm in any matter.
But if a bone protrudes from the body already excised, then you must cut that in this manner:  you take a ligature and bind that to the extremity of that protruding bone, and command someone to extend it upwards; and place that woolen ligature thicker than the first ligature; and then tie that over the flesh that is beneath the bone, and extend its extremity so that you draw the flesh to the parts beneath, and you uncover the flesh over the place which you wish to saw so that the saw does not injure the flesh.
And place a block or board beneath the bone decently, for when you do this, the saw is not prohibited from cutting the corrupted flesh.
And it is necessary that the sawing be done over the corrupt place little by little, for if corruption is in the concavity of the bone and does not appear in its outward appearance to the senses, then force the sawing of it another time.
And if the bone is corrupt and not protruding, with one part continuous with the other, and the corruption is in the middle part or in a part of it, then you uncover the flesh from all parts completely; and then place wood underneath, and then saw that from the first part where the corruption is until the sawing is continuous with the other part.
And let the sawing be according to the location of the corruption, little by little, as we have said.
And if the corruption is in the joint, incise that corrupt joint, and saw the bone where it is continuous with the other part.
And if the corruption is in the continuation of two joints, then there is no reason for it except for ingenuity/skill.  (The meaning is somewhat ambiguous;  "engen" likely refers to surgical skill or cleverness needed to address such a complex case.)
And if the corruption is in the bone of the hand or foot, it is very difficult; however, it is necessary that you inquire into the corruption in whatever manner it appears to you, and that you open that, and clean that according to each disposition which is possible for you, and with each tool it should be rectified for you, when it does not oppose you in vein or nerve.
And know that the incisors and saws to incise these bones are many according to the placement of the bones, and the preparation of those, and the thickness of those, and the subtlety and the size and the smallness of those, and the hardness and their rarity; therefore it is necessary that you prepare for every kind of operation an instrument convenient to that operation.
And know that this operation signifies to you the type of instrument of which you have need; because with you there is great study and long and knowledgeable experience of the ways of this art, and witness of the ways of illnesses, for then you already have for yourself that which is convenient for the instruments for every illness.
And I am informing you at the end of this chapter the number of instruments which you will place as simple tools with which you will proceed in your prohibition which you will experiment upon others. (The meaning of "prohibicio" here is uncertain and likely refers to a surgical procedure or treatment; perhaps a preventative measure or a test.) Shape/Form of saw:
Shape/Form of another saw:
Shape/Form of another large saw:
Shape/Form of a ray (or spoke): Let the head of this ray be according to the shape of a star-shaped nail head, and its points be according to the shape of the points of an awl.
And it is only suitable that with this (instrument) the heads of the joints are rubbed when they are corrupted, or the opening is large and wide.
Shape of a smaller razor:
Shape of a wide razor:
Shape of another saw decently made: let it be made of the most excellent arc (possibly referring to the shape or material) and its sharpness of iron, and its member (or handle) of suitably made wood. Its shape / The shape of it:
Shape of a razor which has a concavity:
Shape of another, subtle razor:
Shape of another razor with a curved end:
Shape of a small razor similar to a probe:
Shape of another, smaller incisor:
Shape of another incisor; this one resembles a ray, and its end is like a saw, and it is used in many places in the treatment of bones:
Shape of a ray which is suitable for the treatment of those who have perforated bones:
And its end is triangular and sharply pointed.
And it is made of Indian iron, and similarly, it is necessary that all the things we have said about razors, and incisors, and saws, [apply to this instrument as well].
Of the incision of extremities and the sawing of bones.
The extremities may become diseased either by intrinsic or extrinsic causes, or if you have treated that corruption with medications and the treatment is ineffective, or you see the corruption spreading through the limb without any apparent cause, then you should incise that limb to the point where the corruption has reached, so that the patient escapes death or the worse affliction of limb loss.
And the sign of this affliction is that the limb turns black, as if fire has already burnt it, or the blackness spreads until the disease reaches the point where it affects the limb and spreads to the whole body; therefore, treat it with incision.
Similarly, if the cause of the corruption is the striking of some venomous creatures, such as a sea scorpion, a viper, or a shrew, and the like.
And if the corruption or the injury is in the extremity of a finger, then you should incise the finger and not give space for the corruption to spread to the hand.
And similarly, if it affects the hand, then you should incise it from the root of the wrist, and do not allow the corruption to spread to the forearm.
And if it affects the arm, then incise the arm up to the elbow at the joint.
And if the corruption passes beyond and you see it around the elbow, then in that case is the death of the patient; and to administer any other remedy besides that is a waste of effort.
And similarly, for the foot: when corruption affects a toe, then you should incise it up to one of the ankle bones.
And if it takes hold in the instep of the foot, then you should incise the whole foot. But if it ascends to the knee, then you should incise the leg up to the knee joint.
And if the corruption has already reached the knee, then there is no remedy for him but resignation, and to leave the patient to death.
And the manner of incising or cauterizing a limb is that you should tighten a ligature on the lower part which you wish to incise, and tighten another ligature above the location; and let the assistant stretch a ligature to the lower parts, and let the assistant stretch another ligature above; and you separate the flesh which is between the two ligatures, little by little, until all the flesh is exposed; and then it should be incised or cauterized.
And it is necessary that a linen cloth be placed over all parts so that it does not touch the healthy location, and that the patient receives a well-adjusted lesion and a hot abscess.
But if you encounter a flow of blood while operating, then you should carefully cauterize the affected area, or apply some blood-stanching powders; and then return to your medication until it is completed.
And then bind the injured limb with a suitable bandage, and treat it until it is healed.
And I recount to you what happened to a man in his foot, this same accident which I have recounted to you, which is that a blackness occurred in his foot with a burn that resembled a fire burn.
And that corruption occurred first in his toe until it spread to the whole foot.
And then that man prepared himself, because he saw the cure going to the limb with such vehemence that he was overcome by pain and burning, and he incised that foot to the joint, and it healed.
For a long time, he experienced the same corruption in the index finger of his hand.
And then he came to me, and I tried to repel that superfluity with what I applied to his hand in medicines, for the purification of his body; and the superfluity was not repelled and began to spread to another finger until it began in the hand.
And he asked me to incise his hand, and I did not want to do that, hoping for the repulsion of that superfluity, and even more fearing the incision of his hand might be fatal, because the patient's strength was failing.
And after he left me, he returned to his land, and it came to me that that man prepared and incised his whole hand, and he was healed.
And I have included this narrative only so that it may be helpful in the case of this illness, and that it may serve as a sign by which it may be recognized and according to which it may be treated.
On the treatment of sinuses and the quality of clysterization with medicines.
When an abscess occurs in any fleshy member and the space of the abscess is prolonged until it forms a collection of pus, and then it is broken and perforated, and the pus has come out of it, and the place remains empty as if it were a vessel, and the skin that is over it is like thin cloth, and it has not reached a further corruption, and does not impinge on bone or nerve or ligament, it is called a sinus, and it is not called a fistula.
However, if the space is prolonged until the corruption affects any member, then it is called a fistula and not a sinus.
And its cure is that you incise that skin entirely as it is swollen, and especially when it is thinned and made like cloth, and ensure that it does not adhere to the place because of its corruption.
But if you suspect that the skin adheres and that the corruption has not reached further consequence, and the skin has a change of color, then you treat that with a clyster.
And consider the sinus, and then if it is large, and the pus that is in it is of a foul odor, then clysterize it with an Egyptian medicine which is made of oil and sour wine and honey, taking equal parts, and let them be mixed in a vessel, and let them be boiled over the fire until the medicine becomes thick and reaches the consistency of honey.
Then take what is necessary from it and dissolve it with water and honey; and clysterize the sinus with this, and constrict its orifice, and leave the medicine inside for about two hours.
And then extract that with a sponge; and do this for as many days until the sinus is cleansed and the foul smell is removed.
And sometimes it is clysterized with lye water, when this medicine is not available to you; and you take the ash of vines, and put water on it; and then strain this and clysterize with it until you are sure that the sinus is then clean.
And if the patient does not tolerate the Egyptian medicine or the lye water, then clysterize with water and honey and some crushed honey added, and clysterize with wine and honey mixed, for it is the property of honey to cleanse and wash, and the wine makes it adhere to the sinus, especially when the wine has an excess of astringency and dryness.
And when you have done this several times and are sure that the sinus is now clean, then clysterize it with something that will cause the flesh to grow there.
And you should take diafinicon ointment and dissolve it with rose oil and astringent wine; or clysterize with other medicines and ointments that have the properties which I have already written about in the treatise on ointments.
And if the opening of the sinus is narrow, so that the clyster cannula cannot be inserted, then widen it little by little with a small iron instrument, and place a pledget wrapped in Egyptian ointment or basilicon ointment inside until it is widened.
And similarly, if the opening is wide, then you should bring its lips together with a suture, leaving enough space for the clyster to enter without difficulty.
And if the opening from which the pus flows is elevated in the upper parts, then dry the lowest point so that the pus flows downwards, for when the pus is confined within the depth of the sinus, the flesh will not regenerate there.
And if it is not possible for you to dry the sinus to the lowest point as desired, then ensure that you prepare the limb with a preparation by which the pus flows lightly as is suitable, and that nothing hinders the flow of the pus.
But the cloth that is over the opening of the sinus, this should be changed every hour so that the pus that is contained within it may be removed. And so that you may know if the pus that flows from it is much or little, or is digested, or is undigested.
And with this, consider the location of that sinus, whether the patient feels pain there or not, and if there is an abscess there.
And as your treatment is prolonged in this manner, and you see that the matter that is discharged onto the opening of the sinus is already adhering, or is about to adhere, then on the following day, or the third day, remove it; and when you clean the wound, then change the cloth to another and renew the ointment.
But if from the sinus, nearby in the space, there is subtle poison, then do not despair of its adherence, because its healing is approaching, for there are some men in whom the generation of flesh in their wounds is slow, and of these there are those in whom the opposite is true.
And if from the sinus, for many days, undigested pus has issued, then know that the sinus will not close; and if the closing of the sinus is delayed and the cause prolonged, then you should adjust to drying medicines, and if the medicines are moist in their substance and in their virtue, they are dry such as diafinicon ointment, when superfluous addition of zegi is adjusted there.
And the best remedy with which it is cured is that you take diafinicon ointment and dissolve it in rose oil, and add old wine equal to it in substance, and mix that with it, and use that.
And it acts similarly in that situation, when there is no pus: diafinicon ointment, honey cooked until thickened, and use it; or take myrrh, aloes, and incense, crush everything and powder it over the honey while it is on the fire, and then spread this on a cloth and bind it over the sinus; and spread that with the honey which you have cooked until it is thickened, and powder it on a cloth and bind it.
And sometimes are administered with it aristolochia longa and roots of lily of the valley (and it is lily of the valley) and flour of barley and centaury, and use those simples or compounds, crush those, sift them, and powder them over the honey which has been mentioned; and use it.
And if the sinus is prolonged, and is not healed by this treatment, then know that the corruption is in the depth of it, and it has already investigated the bones or other hard members or ligaments; then you treat it with fistular treatment, as above is said.
Concerning the treatment of paronychia and worn nails and added digit incision and section.
Paronychia is an abscess which arises under the nail of the finger or toe of the hand or foot, and quickly spreads to the other fingers, and as it is prolonged and its treatment is less valued, or it is suppurated by a hot abscess, or it is corrupted, and throws out pus until it corrodes the root of the nail, and quickly corrupts the whole of it, and quickly its corruption penetrates to the bone until it has a fetid odor, and the extremity of the finger is swollen, and its color is darkened.
And therefore when you have treated it with what we have said in the division and you do not obtain a cure, then it is necessary that you incise with an iron all the superfluity that remains of the nail and then cauterize the wound, because cautery is very helpful in this.
But if the bone is healthy and the nail is healthy, and the additions of the nail, emptied, already compress the flesh at the edges, and begin to prick and injure it, then it is necessary that you place a thin file under the angle of the nail that pricks the flesh, and push it up and incise that flesh easily, and place on what remains of the flesh corrosive medicines until it is all removed; and then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
But if the corruption has already penetrated the bone, then it is necessary that you incise that bone and extract it, for a bone that is corrupted will never heal.
And if you see the corrosion and corruption going into the finger, then you incise it at one of the joints as its healing is considered appropriate, and then treat it until it is healed.
But if a blow or friction happens to the nail, and vehement pain results, then it is necessary that you first bleed the patient, and then cut the nail with a sharp instrument with a transverse cut from above downwards, and take care that the cut does not reach the flesh that is under the nail, for you will cause the patient vehement pain, and it will be the cause of the generation of superfluous flesh in that place; and then treat that place with something that relieves pain.
But the said finger, which is born in the hands of some men, is very quickly fleshy, and very quickly bony, or very quickly has nails.
And some of them are born at the root of the joint, or their birth is in some of the joints of the fingers. But that which is born in some joint of the finger does not hurt, and that which is born in the joints is very quickly painful.
And of those that are born fleshy, the excision is easy, and it is that you incise that one below its root with a broad instrument.
But of that which is born at the root of the joint, the cure is difficult; and therefore beware of its excision.
But in that which is born on a finger between the joints, it is necessary that you first incise its flesh with a round incision down to the bone, and then saw it with one of those saws suitable for this, and then cure that until it is healed.
But consolidation which happens to the fingers between their knuckles, whether by the birth of a man born thus, or by the consolidation of a wound, or by burning with fire, or similarly, then it is necessary that you separate that consolidation until the fingers return to their natural form.
And then place between them cloths soaked in rose oil so that they are not easily consolidated, and separate them, or place between them a thin lead plate until it is consolidated as necessary.
And similarly, if consolidation occurs in some fingers with the palm, then you separate that consolidation according to what is prepared and suitable for the shape of the member.
Of incisions of vices, there are various.
Vices are various, and are twisted, thick veins full of melancholic superfluities which appear in many parts of the body, and most often in the legs, and especially in the legs of travelers and laborers and those who carry burdens.
Then it is necessary that you administer a purging of the body of black bile several times with strong expulsion, and then bleed the patient from the basilic vein.
But the cure of them with iron is according to two methods: one is that it be incised and that black blood be drawn out, and the other method is that the vein be elevated and entirely extracted.
The incision of it is in this manner:  first bathe the leg with very hot water until the thick, feculent blood is resolved from the leg. Then bind the patient's leg tightly from the highest part of the thigh to below the knee with a bandage, and then incise the vein in one, two, or three places with a wide incision. Then, with your hand, press the black blood from the lower part of the leg upwards, and from above downwards, until the quantity of blood you desire and deem sufficient has been released, and which will remove the patient's malady.
Then bind it up, and instruct the patient to abstain from foods that engender black bile.
And repeat the treatment by phlebotomy when the veins are full and this harms the patient.
But the elevation of them is according to this manner: you who shave the patient's leg, if there is much hair on it, and then place him in a bath and bathe his leg with hot water until it reddens and the veins are distended; or, if a bath is not available to you, have him engage in vigorous exercise until the limb is warmed.
Then incise the vein in the right place, either along its length, behind the knee, or at its lowest point below the ankle.
Then open the vein with a lancet and scarify it on all sides until it bleeds, and it is by its appearance that you see that red vein tending towards blackness.
And then, as it drains from the vein, you see that white thing which is like a string.
Then you place a linen strip underneath so that it is elevated and is drawn away from the vein, and suspend it with a golden or lead weight.
Then make another incision near that incision for three fingers' breadth, and scarify the vein in the part above the vein until it bleeds.
Then elevate it and incise it in the second incision near the heel, and then extract it and elevate it until it is drawn out through the second incision, and then extract it from the incision that is above that.
And do this until you extract it from the incision that is most superior or highest of all the incisions, until it is all removed; and then incise it.
And if it does not obey you to be extracted and elevated, then introduce a needle with strong double thread and tie it and extract it, or introduce a linen strip underneath and rotate your hand in every direction until it is removed. And be careful that it is not incised; for if it is broken, it is made difficult for you to elevate it and it becomes a danger to the patient because of that damage.
And when it is all expelled, then place on the wound site wool soaked in wine and red and un-red oil, and treat it until it is healed.
And if the intestine is constricted, having a tortuosity to which there is a twisting in parts, and it is not straight as we have said, then it is necessary that you make incisions on it at every point of its tortuosity and in the places of its twisting, and then suspend it with hooks until you elevate it entirely.
And be careful in your incision that you do not cut the vein and that you do not injure it, for it will be difficult for you to elevate it; and use your prudence in this.
The form of the incision with which the intestine is cut:
It is not sharpened like hooks, nor is it of a sharp point so that it does not injure the vein; and it is of a thick and flexible nature, because if it were thin, it would cut the vein due to its thinness; it has superfluous thickness as we have said.
Of the extraction of the vein of the leg.
This vein is generated in the legs in hot lands, such as al-Ategi in the land of the Arabs and in the hot and arid lands of India, of little humidity, and in which neither grass nor trees grow.
And it is quickly generated in other parts of the body besides the legs.
And its generation is from putrefaction that comes from under the skin, just as serpents, worms, and maggots and worms are generated between the skin and the flesh.
And a sign of the onset of this vein is that a vehement inflammation happens in the leg; and then the area is blistered; and then the vein begins to emerge from the place of that blister, which resembles the root of a plant.
And when its extremity appears, then you should wrap around it a piece of lead weighing one drachm to two drachms, and tie it and leave the lead suspended from the leg.
And as many times as any part of it emerges outwards, wrap that in lead and tie it. And if the growth is prolonged, then you incise a part of it and wrap the remainder; and do not incise the root until it has emerged, for if you incise it, it is retracted and enters the flesh and causes an abscess and putrefaction in the place and a bad ulceration.
Therefore, it must be treated gently and extracted little by little, until it is completely expelled and no part of it remains in the body.
And from this vein, in some men, a growth emerges which is five palms and fingers in length, and it has even reached me that one emerged which was twenty palms.
And if it is incised at the time of its treatment, then introduce a probe into the opening and perforate it with a long opening into the body, until everything that is in the material is evacuated, and treat the putrefaction of the place for several days with medicines; and then cure it according to the treatment of abscesses.
And this vein sometimes has many branches, and especially when it appears at the joint of the foot or in the foot, and many orifices come to it, and a branch emerges from each orifice.
And therefore cure it as we have said in the division and with what is said above.
Concerning the incision of worms generated under the skin, and it is called bovine sickness.
This illness is called in some lands near us bovine illness because it often happens to cattle and is a small worm which is born between the skin and the flesh, and goes throughout the body rising and falling, and is shown by the feeling of its movement from limb to limb until it breaks the skin and comes out.
And its generation is due to the putrefaction of certain humors, just as worms and snakes and earthworms and ascarids happen in the belly.
And it is feared for its malice, for when it goes into the body and is elevated to the head, and has reached the eye, then very quickly it opens it and enters and destroys the eye, and this happens many times.
Therefore, when you wish to cure this and extract it, then it is done only by observing its movement and appearance to the touch, and then it is necessary that you constrict what is above it and what is below it with a strong bandage and constriction, and then dry it above and extract it.
And if it is deeply embedded in the flesh and you do not find it, then you apply a cautery with fire to the place until it dies, and the greatest danger to be feared is its corruption, by which it corrupts the place as we have said.
But if you see it has reached the head near the eye, then bind above the eyebrow with a strong constriction, and then dry above it, and extract it; and it is necessary that the patient use purification of their body with medicines evacuating bad putrid humors, and guard against foods generating putrefaction.
Concerning the incision for the illness nafir. (or, On the incision of nafir)
This illness is called nafir in our land, and it is a pain which comes in some members, and then is moved from member to member.
And I have already seen that, as I will recount to you. I was called to a sick woman in a village, and I uncovered her arm and saw a small inflammation in the superficial vein of the arm, and after it had remained for an hour, I saw that inflammation moving like a worm climbing upwards, but more lightly than one might fear, as if it were quicksilver when it runs from place to place.
And then the pain left that place and fixed itself in the muscle, and there it remained for about an hour.
And then it ran to the other side until it reached the other arm.
And then I realised that it was moving throughout her body, as I saw; and I was very amazed at its movement and the speed from limb to limb. And I had seen this before with my own eyes in this manner, however I have seen many who find pain shifting from limb to limb. But I did not see it with my eyes as clearly as in the woman.
And I considered that this was so because the woman was old, with dry flesh and exposed veins, and in her, that shifting windiness was apparent to the senses.
And it is necessary that it not appear, according to this reverse cure, in those who are delicate and with moist flesh and hidden veins.
And if you want to cure him, and the patient feels that pain, but it is not apparent to your eye as we have said, then you press lightly on that area and dry it until that constricted windiness is expelled, and cauterize the place.
But if you do not see it with your eyes, then treat it with rubbing of the body and with things that expel windiness, and drive it away with foul-smelling pills and pills of serapium and the like.
On the extraction of arrows.
Arrows are diversified according to their types, and according to the places in the body in which they lodge, for their diversity is such that some have large points, and small ones, and concave ones, and blunt ones, that is, solid ones; and some have three edges, and some have barbs; and some have feathers.
And of the signs in the brain, when an arrow lodges there and penetrates the bone, and emerges from the cranium which is over the brain, for it causes a sudden vehement headache, and dimness of vision, and vertigo, and redness in the eyes, and inflammation and redness of the tongue, and spasm and confusion of mind, and vomiting of bile, and the speech is quickly cut off and the voice is destroyed, and there emerges from the place of the wound a white humidity resembling pus, and pus from it resembling the watery part of flesh.
And therefore if these signs appear to you, then abstain from the cure and the extraction of the arrow, unless it is outside.
But the signs of the arrow when it lodges in the heart, is that it is near the left breast, and it feels as if it were stuck in something hard, and not in something empty; and very quickly the movement of the arrow is similar to the movement of the pulse, and black blood runs from the wound, and there is coldness of the extremities, and cold sweat, and syncope; and therefore know that death approaches without any doubt.
And the signs when the arrow has wounded the lung are thus: frothy blood comes from the wound, and the vessels that are near the neck are inflamed, and the color of the patient is changed, and he breathes with great difficulty, and desires the intake of cold air.
And if the arrow lodges in the diaphragm which is in the chest, then the pain is near the lower ribs, and great swelling is produced with vehement pain and with sighing, and not all the members of the muscles are affected.
And if the arrow lodges in the stomach, then very quickly some undigested food comes out of the wound.
And if the arrow lodges in the abdomen, and is stuck in it, there comes some pus from the wound, or the intestine, or bowel which is ruptured, and there is no hope in its cure without extraction of the arrow.
And if the arrow lodges in the bladder, and urine comes out, and some matter proceeds from it to the external parts, and very quickly pain overcomes the patient, then know that it is mortal.
But the other members, such as the face, the neck, and the throat, and the shoulders and the armpits, and the vertebrae of the back, and the clavicle, and the hip, and the leg and similar members, are saved according to the best dispositions when the arrow does not find a vein nor an artery and is not a poisoned arrow.
And I recount this to you that I have seen of the being of these arrows, so that you may signify by this concerning your cure.
The reason is, because in a man an arrow fell into the lacrimal duct of his eye at the root of the nose, and I extracted it for him from the other side, below the lobe of his ear, and he is healed, and no harm befell his eye.
And I extracted another arrow from a Jew which fell into him in the lobe of his eye, below the eyelid further down, and the arrow was already hidden and I only found a small extremity with which it adhered to its shaft, and it was a large arrow of the sharp arrows of the Turks, with a lion head on it which had no barbs.
And the Jew is healed, and no ill accident befell his eye.
And I extracted another arrow from a Christian man which had fallen into his throat, and it was an Arabic arrow, and this is the kind that has barbs; and then I incised upon it between two guides, and it was already submerged in his throat; and then I proceeded subtly with it, and I extracted it, and the Christian is healed.
And I extracted another arrow from a man which had fallen into his belly, and I thought that he would die from it; and then, since thirty days had passed and nothing had changed in his condition, I incised over the arrow and pulled it out, and he is healed, and no ill accident befell him.
And I saw another man into whom an arrow fell in his back, and the wound had healed over him, and since it was almost seven years, the arrow emerged at the root of the thigh.
And I saw a woman into whom an arrow fell in her belly, and the wound is healed within her, and nothing is changed in her condition, and the woman finds no harm in any of her natural functions.
And I saw another man into whom an arrow fell in his face, and the wound is healed and the arrow broken, finding no great pain here, and many similar to these.
And I extracted the arrow from the man of the king's princes which had fallen into the middle of his nose and had already declined a little to the right side, and the whole arrow was hidden.
And I was called to his cure, concerning the arrow wound, within three days.
And then I found the wound from the arrow very narrow; and then I examined it with a slender probe, and I did not feel it; but he felt a prickling under his right ear, and then I suspected that this prickling was due to the point of the arrow.
And I plastered the place with a plaster which has attractive and digestive virtue, trusting that the place would suppurate so that the location of the arrow would appear to me, so that I could operate on it.
And no significant accident occurred in the place that the arrow had reached; and I continued with the plaster on him for many days and no accident occurred; and the wound healed meanwhile, and the patient desisted from extraction for many days until one day he felt the arrow inside his nose and recounted this to me.
And then I applied a sharp, corrosive medicine to the wound for many days until it was opened, and with the probe I examined it, and I found the point of the arrow, which adhered to the shaft.
And then I applied to the appearance of the wound that sharp medicine until the point of the arrow appeared visibly to me, and I spent time with this for the space of four months.
And then, since the wound was enlarged, and it was possible for me to insert forceps into it, and remove it, and I did not succeed in this way, then I did not cease to refine and devise a method for it, until I managed one day, using ingenious methods, to grasp it with specially made forceps, as the form of those will appear at the end of the chapter, until I extracted it; and then I restored that wound.
And some physicians judged that the cartilage of the nose would not be restored, and I restored it, and the wound healed, and the patient was completely healthy, and he suffered no harm from it.
And I recount to you the quality of the extraction of certain arrows so that you may make a rule and explanation of that which I have not said, for the parts of this art and its definitions are not comprehended by narration nor do books encompass them.
And skilled artisans compare the small with the large; and that which is present with that which is absent; and they find new operations and new instruments because of the unexpected occurrences of extraneous causes in the art.
Therefore I say that arrows are not removed from the members into which they are fixed except in two ways: either by traction from the place where they enter; or by the opposite action from the other side.
And that which is removed from the place where it entered, is an arrow lodged in a fleshy place, and is pulled and removed.
And if it does not yield to such removal at the time of extraction, then it is necessary that you leave it for some days until the flesh around it softens, and its extraction and removal are eased.
And similarly, if it is fixed in bone and does not yield to removal, then leave it for some days and repeat the attempt with traction and movement each day, and it will eventually be removed.
And if it still does not yield after some days, then it is necessary that you perforate the bone around the arrow on all sides with a thin drill until the space around the arrow is widened, and then extract it.
But if the arrow is hidden within the body and is beyond feeling, then you should probe for it with a probe; and if you feel it, then extract it with whatever instruments are suitable for its removal.
And if you cannot reach it because of the tightness of the wound and the length of the probe, and there is no bone, nerve, or vein in the way, then you should incise the wound until it is widened enough to allow extraction of the arrow.
And if it is held fast by barbs, then you should free the flesh in which it is embedded from all sides with all the skill you can muster; and devise a way to overcome this, if you cannot manage it by freeing the flesh from the barbs and twisting them until they release.
And when you undertake the extraction of the arrow, wherever it may be, then use twisting with your hand and forceps on all sides until you make it yield;  and proceed with great delicacy so that the arrow is not broken, making its removal difficult.
And if you cannot manage it at that time, then leave it for a few days until the parts surrounding it soften, and then attempt it again, for it will then be easier. But if you encounter excessive bleeding, then apply the remedies we have described in the appropriate chapter.
And be careful about cutting a vein, nerve, or tendon, and use every possible means to remove the arrow; and do this with ease, calm, slowness, and firmness, as I have recommended to you.
And so, that you may counteract the arrow so that the patient is positioned according to the direction in which the arrow entered, because that is more helpful. But if that is not possible for you, then apply what is possible according to the circumstances.
But if the arrows are protruding from the opposite side, or if some part of it already extends from the inside to the outside, or the tip of the arrow is crooked due to the feeling of the part above the deep wound and sometimes that protrudes; then you cut on that side; and let the incision be according to the size that the forceps can grasp; and then pull it out, for it will easily come out that way.
But if it is lodged in the bone, then you twist the blade in the opposite direction until the arrow is loosened from the bone, and widen it yourself, and then extract it.
And if not, leave it for a few days, and then try again until it comes out.
And if the shaft of the arrow is inside, then push it in with him/her.
But if the shaft has fallen off and you want to administer a push, then you introduce, if it is blunt, a concave instrument so that the concavity of it enters the tail of the arrow and then push it in.
But if the arrowhead is concave, then you push it in with a strong instrument entering into it, because the arrow is relieved by it.
And if the arrow is poisoned, then it is necessary that you remove all the flesh in which the poison is, if it is possible for you to do so, and then treat it with what is appropriate.
And if the arrow falls into the foot, or into the belly, or into the bladder, or into the side, and it is close enough that you can touch it with a probe, and it is possible for you to grasp it, then grasp it and be careful not to cut a vein or nerve, and extract it, and then sew the wound if necessary, and treat it until it is healed.
The shape of the forceps with which arrows are drawn out:
Let the ends of their jaws be like the beak of a bird, made like a saw when they grip the arrow so that they do not let go of it.
And of these, many types are made, large, small, and medium-sized, according to the size of the arrow and its smallness, and the width of the wound, and its tightness.
like a ray, so that the entry into the concave arrow is eased and it is pushed with that.
Of phlebotomy of the veins.
The veins for phlebotomy, of which the usual number is thirty, of which sixteen are in the head; that is, two pulsating veins which are near the ears, called *alhasisain*; two veins which are in the two apparent temples; and two veins which are in the two tear ducts of the two eyes which are called *aspicientz*; and the vein situated in the middle of the forehead, and the vein which is at the tip of the nose; and two *guidegi* which are at the neck; and two veins which are in the upper lip; and two veins which are in the lower lip; and — these are the veins which are called *algelic*—; and there are two veins which are under the tongue. But the veins which are phlebotomized in the arms are five; for of these, one is the cephalic, and it is on the outer side of the arm; and the common people call it “the vein of the head”, and it is a superficial vein, and is composed of a branch of the basilic, and of another branch of the cephalic; and the people call this one “vein of the whole body”, and the basilic is a vein which is situated on the inner side of the arm, and it is called “citillar”, and the common people call it “vein of the belly”; and the *funis* of the arm, and it is situated upon the forearm, and it is that in which phlebotomy is performed, and it is that which appears upon the bend of the elbow by manifest appearance; and the *salvatella*, and it is the vein which is between the ring finger and the little finger, and it has two branches in it.
And in the foot and leg there are three veins; one of these is below the bend of the knee on the outer side; and the second is the saphenous, and its location is below the leg on the inner side; and the sciatic vein, and its location is below the leg on the outer side; and in the leg are other veins similar to these.
The opening of the veins near the ears is beneficial for chronic catarrh, migraine, headaches, and old, bad ulcers of the head.
And the manner of bleeding those veins is as I recount to you: that is, the patient's head should be shaved, and the patient's head should be rubbed at the occiput in the location of both veins with a wide cloth with good friction; then the patient should tighten their neck with a bandage until the two veins and their locations appear near the ears in two depressed places on the head; and feel for them with your finger, and if you feel the pulse of these with your finger, then bleed them by incision.
Then you take the lancet, which is sharp, and you insert it under the vein in the direction of the bone until the blood flows. Then raise your hand with the vein and the elbow to the upper parts and incise the vein with a sharp incision. And let the length of the incision be the amount of two fingers placed together, or thereabouts; and let out as much blood as you wish.
Then bind it with powders and leave it until it is healed.
And already and previously, at the beginning of the book, the incision of these and their cauterization [was described].
But of the two arteries that are in the temples, the benefit of phlebotomy is for chronic and sudden severe migraines, and persistent ophthalmia, and a body with acute superfluities effused to the eyes.
And the manner of phlebotomizing these is as I recount to you: constrain the patient's neck strongly so that the two veins appear to the touch by manifest appearance and their pulse is demonstrated beneath your finger; and then you bleed with a lancet.
Then you lift the skin above the vein at the upper parts with your index finger, and insert the phlebotomy incision underneath, and raise the vein upward; and incise it just as you have done in the other two veins; and let the blood flow according to the quantity of your necessity.
And then loosen the constriction of the patient, and place your finger on the vein for an hour, and then place cotton and powder on it and bind it above with strong compression, and leave it until it is healed.
And now the remembrance of them, and of their incision, and attraction is preceded at the beginning of the book.
Therefore, the benefit of phlebotomy of the frontal vein is in addition to phlebotomy of the cephalic vein for ancient diseases of the face, and for migraine, stiffness, and foul ulcers.
And the quality of his phlebotomy is as I have recounted to you; that is, that the patient should constrict his neck with a bandage until the vein appears; and then take the instrument which is named a lancet, of which this is the form:
Place the prominent point which is at the head of the lancet upon that vein and strike it with a hammer or with something else in the manner of it, and let the blood flow according to the quantity which you wish; and then loosen the perforation of the patient and bind it until it is healed.
And sometimes it is opened with a lateral phlebotomy, however it is not fitting that the phlebotomy be of an acute extremity like the other phlebotomies, rather it should be of a blunt extremity, and phlebotomize it across, because the bone is near and would easily break there with the phlebotomy when it is sharp.
But the benefit of the two veins that are at the tear ducts of the two eyes is for scabies of the eyes, for stiffness and swelling in the eyes, and for diseases of the face.
And the manner of the phlebotomy is that the patient should constrict his neck with a bandage, and then phlebotomize those veins, and you should be standing over his head.
And let the phlebotomy be made across rather than lengthwise, a little, with a small phlebotomy instrument, because in that place there is no flesh; and if the phlebotomy instrument is sharp, its point will very easily be broken.
And then let the blood flow as much as is necessary to you, and place cotton over it, and bind it tightly for one night, and then unbind it.
But phlebotomy of the vein of the nose is beneficial for acute fever and violent headache, and for diseases of the face and migraine and inflammation that occurs in the face, and especially when it is chronic.
And the manner of his phlebotomy is that the patient should constrict his neck, and then hold his nose with your left hand, and take a long, thin phlebotomy instrument and insert it into the middle of the bridge of the nose, straight, because the vein is not apparent to the touch there, and because the blood begins to flow immediately.
As you move your hand with the small phlebotomy instrument little by little, let blood flow according to your needs; and then bind it for a night, for it will heal easily.
But bleeding from both temples is helpful for constriction of the throat and the beginning of leprosy, and for many illnesses, impetigo, and bad, corrosive ulcers, as well as herpes.
And the manner of phlebotomy in these [temples] is that the patient should hold each side of his neck tightly with a bandage; and the practitioner should stand above the patient's head, and the patient should be seated on a stool.
Then phlebotomize the vein lengthwise with a wide phlebotomy instrument little by little; and draw out blood according to a moderate quantity or according to what you see is necessary; and then do likewise to the other vein.
Then untie the bandage and tighten the two veins with a moderate constriction so that the patient is not suffocated, and leave it until morning, for the wound will be healed.
And the benefit of phlebotomy of the alveolar veins [veins near the gums] helps with small abscesses and pustules of the mouth, and corruption of the gums, and bad ulcers and fissures, and bad ulcers that are in the nose and around it.
And the manner of phlebotomy of these [veins] is that you make the patient sit before you, and bind his neck with a bandage, and then roll back his lips and look for two veins, of which one is on the right of the lip and the second on the left; and the identification of each is by the blackness of each of the two, and this is more so because in the vicinity of these are small, black veins; and then incise each with an appropriate incision.
But if you are in doubt, and you do not know which is which, then you should incise the larger of those veins, and the most apparent one.
And do the same for the two veins that are in the upper lips.
But of the two veins that are below the tongue, the phlebotomy of the cephalic vein is suitable for affections that are in the throat, for diseases of the uvula, and for diseases of the mouth.
And the method of phlebotomizing these is that you hold the patient between your hands facing the sun, and raise their tongue, and look under the tongue, on one side you will see one vein and on the other side another vein, and the color of each is tending towards blackness.
And then phlebotomize each one; and be careful not to extend your hand too far when phlebotomizing these, because below these are arteries.
And the veins that are phlebotomized in the neck are those which are common to all men, and their phlebotomy is done in two ways: either they are opened with a myrtle- or olive-shaped phlebotomy instrument of fine point; or they are incised with a lancet-shaped phlebotomy instrument, and this is called the "alnessil", and this is its form:
Let its width be like this, and it is suitable for opening concave, full, prominent, thick veins, and those that contain thick, turbid blood.
And this phlebotomy instrument is of lesser width and a more subtle point, and is suitable for phlebotomy of fine veins containing thin, citrine blood.
But the benefit of phlebotomy of the basilic vein, which is one of three veins: because it draws blood from illnesses that are below the throat and neck, and from what affects the feet and abdomen.
And it is necessary for the phlebotomist, when performing this phlebotomy, to carefully observe and be very cautious, because beneath it is an artery, and if he errs and is inaccurate in the puncture of the phlebotomy, he will incise that artery and cause a flow of blood; therefore, it is necessary that one does not perform this phlebotomy with a sharp phlebotomy instrument, before it is cut with a lancet.
And if the basilic vein is not clearly visible, then you should abandon it and move to another, or seek one of its branches; or perform phlebotomy at the end of the arm in its place, for that is clearly visible; and incise it with a lancet-like phlebotomy instrument as we have said.
But if you wish to perform phlebotomy on the same vein, then before constricting the arm you should touch the area until you locate the pulse, and then mark it with a pen; and then tie the arm and incise the vein with a concave incision using a lancet-like phlebotomy instrument as we have said; and be careful that the incision does not fall into the area of the artery.
And when you see, as you tighten the ligature, swelling in the area you marked with the pen, then that swelling is the swelling of the artery, and therefore avoid that area.
And if you see the blood flowing from the phlebotomy like a child's urine, and the blood is thin and red, then know that it is blood from the artery; and then you should quickly place your finger over it for a long time; and then remove your finger, and if the bleeding stops, because many times it stops, then you should loosen the arm and leave it.
And guard the patient from their movement, and let there be a great care for them, and do not anger them for some days until they are healed.
But if the bleeding is not stopped, and you see that you do not have a remedy for this, then you should incise the artery, if it appears to you; because its extremity is constricted, and the bleeding will stop; or that you take bark of the fig tree, and grind it, and take one half and apply it tightly to the area of the vein with a descending ligature and powders until the next day.
And then if the bleeding is stopped, it is good; and if not, then treat it with that which is preceded in the recollection of the place of the powders that stop the flow of blood.
And the stopping of their blood is difficult in many cases because of the small size of the wound and the possibility of tying the arm.
But in the case of the dark vein, phlebotomy is helpful, extracting blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body; for this reason, because it is composed of branches of the basilica and of branches of the cephalic, as we have said.
And it behooves the phlebotomist to be very careful in the phlebotomy, because beneath it is a nerve; and if he happens to pierce the nerve during phlebotomy, the patient will suffer numbness, and its cure is difficult, and it is not easily healed completely. And this nerve often appears visibly; and if it is hidden from some men and is subtle and is not shown, then it behooves you to use a phlebotomy tool with which you phlebotomize with a slanted incision, and avoid the nerve with your skill.
And if the vein is between two nerves, then you should open the vein lengthwise.
The benefit of phlebotomy of the cephalic vein is that it draws blood from the head and helps with eye diseases.
And it is fitting in this case, if you wish, that the phlebotomist punctures with an olive-shaped or myrtle-shaped phlebotomy tool; because it is the safest of all veins, for there is neither artery nor nerve beneath it.
However, it is often quickly abscessed in some men, when it is not phlebotomized at the first puncture, but this abscess does no harm.
The first of these is that you should know that phlebotomy is administered only for the preservation of health and for its hope and caution against the onset of illnesses, and that phlebotomy should be performed in one of the veins that are in the arm, that is: cephalic, median, and basilic; and that phlebotomy should be performed at the beginning of spring, on an empty stomach in spring and autumn, and in winter near mealtime, when signs of repletion appear.
And let phlebotomy be performed on the third day or the first, after three hours of the day have passed.
But phlebotomy, which is administered, more when it provokes suitability and necessity for it, either by night or by day, at any hour and at any time.
And it is necessary that a child should not be phlebotomized until they are fourteen years old, and a pregnant woman should not be phlebotomized except from the fourth month until the seventh, and old women who have already passed sixty years should not be phlebotomized.
And if someone wants to be phlebotomized in any way, they must cleanse their bowels before phlebotomy with a clyster (enema), if they have much retained waste in them, so that the veins do not draw the superfluities from the bowels into the phlebotomy, which are putrid, and that they may not harm the principal members.
And let not patients with persistent nausea and diarrhea be phlebotomized, nor those recovering from illness or fever until that is remedied in them, nor patients with dropsy; and let phlebotomy be feared near colic, vomiting, and abdominal pain, and near excessive sexual intercourse, and hard work and exercise, fasting or vigils, and any cause that dissolves strength, whether corporeal or animal.
And consider carefully the thinning of humors beforehand, if the blood is thick, with foods and drinks, and with medicines if this is possible for him.
And then enter a bath if no cause prohibits it, or be exercised by some activity so that the blood may be thinned.
And perform the phlebotomy in the middle of the day, that is, around the third hour, as we have said.
And perhaps you should ensure that the patient's feet are guarded on that day from all harmful accidents, both animal, such as anxiety, anger, fear, and all bodily accidents, such as excessive work and exertion, sexual intercourse, and things similar to these.
And in his room, let there be present things whose use is customary among men, with aromatics and perfumes, and with balsams and similar things, according to what is possible.
And let the phlebotomist sit on a cushion that is higher than the cushion of the one who is to be phlebotomized.
Then, extend his arm, and let the phlebotomist rub it with his hand two or three times; and then tighten the ligature with a strap and wrap it around twice.
And let the constriction be moderate, for if the constriction is not even, or if the constriction is excessive, then it prevents the flow of blood; or if it is too loose, then it prevents the blood from flowing out properly.
And near the constriction, it is necessary that the one who is to be phlebotomized rub his hands together until the veins are swollen and become clearly visible.
Then let the phlebotomist anoint his phlebotomy lancet with a little old oil; and then place the index finger of his left hand on the vein, below the place where he wants to perform the phlebotomy, so that the vein is slightly displaced, and the percussion is stopped, because those veins which you find thus contracting, like a fleeing string,  should not be phlebotomized; and those that are full of air and contract when you place the phlebotomy lancet on them should be avoided by the phlebotomist; and if the lancet does not open the vein, or if it does open it, it is too tight.
Therefore, the phlebotomist must be skilled and attentive in all these matters.
Then apply the phlebotomy lancet; but if the vein is opened at once, it is good; and if not, repeat the process a little below that place, or above it carefully, if the place is not abscessed.
And if the place is abscessed, or the patient is frightened, then leave it for a day or two, and do not tighten the bandage, for it will quickly draw a hot abscess, nor should he enter a bath.
Then repeat the phlebotomy if needed.
And if the opening is small and the blood flows subtly, and you fear that the desired quantity of blood will not be drawn, then repeat the phlebotomy in that same straight line and enlarge the opening slightly, and do this carefully before the place becomes abscessed, for in many men the place becomes abscessed from a small opening.
But if you see that it is already abscessed, then do not repeat the procedure there, for it will not benefit you in any way; and place some olive oil on it, for it relieves the body of blood. And olive oil is better in this instance than other oils.
Similarly, administer olive oil in every phlebotomy with which you open veins to prevent blood clotting; and they [the texts/doctors] prescribe theriac and sagapenum when one of these is placed on the location, because the blood is thinned and its thickness is resolved.
And if a large abscess develops at the site of the phlebotomy—for this often happens, especially to someone who has been bled only once or where the opening in the vein was small—then make a compress and place on the site a sponge soaked in slightly warmed salt water, and squeeze it for an hour, for this will dissolve it.
And it is necessary to do this immediately after the bleeding from that vein, or from another vein, is complete.
And if some blackness or greenness remains at the site for some days, do not worry; and if you wish, apply something made of dissolved aloe and myrrh, or something made of juice of mint or calamint, or something similar.
And abscesses and swellings often occur after phlebotomy of the basilica vein.
Then place your hand on it, and if you then find softness under your compression, then that swelling is malignant and bad; and then be careful to apply something of what we have said, for blood will quickly flow from the artery.
And make a plaster with something that has styptic properties, so that the place is hardened, and then treat it with the other treatment until it is healed.
And it is necessary that you extract blood from each person according to the quantity of their strength and according to the color predominating in the blood as it appears.
For if the blood is black, then you let it flow until it is red; and similarly, if you see it thick, then you let it flow until it is thinned; and similarly, if it is sharp (thin), until its sharpness is diminished.
And it is necessary for someone who is full and strong and needs bloodletting at once, that the phlebotomy of the vein be widened and the phlebotomy be wide.
And in someone who is weak, the opposite should be done, and it is necessary to extract blood in several times, and the opening should be narrow.
And the best way to administer phlebotomy of a vein is that the section be transverse, not a puncture.
And this manner of phlebotomy is safe from excessive bleeding and the cutting of nerves, and it is more praiseworthy and safer than phlebotomy according to length and breadth (i.e., a long incision).
And to someone accustomed to fainting during phlebotomy, it is necessary that you treat them before phlebotomy with a little bread infused in pomegranate wine or simple warmed oxymel; and extract the blood in three or four times.
And if there is coldness of complexion, then before phlebotomy take bread infused in syrup of myrrh or in syrup of honey aromatized with spices such as pepper, cinnamon, ginger, and the like, or in an aromatized and very fragrant syrup.
And if syncope occurs during phlebotomy, and the cause is the loss of much blood, then it is necessary that he drink meat broth and a very subtly fragrant syrup; and use aromatics with vinegar, and let his feet be bathed with it.
And use the other remedies that we have mentioned in the section on syncope due to evacuation (of blood).
And whoever wants to bleed his arm and dissolve his blood a second time, should, if the phlebotomy is for much evacuation, and his strength is weak, evacuate the blood little by little, that is, according to the amount of strength over continuous days.
But whoever wants to bleed his arm and shed his blood a second time, and his body is strong, then let him do so about seven or nine hours after the first phlebotomy.
But whoever wants to draw blood from his body away from the affected area, should be bled on the second or third day.
But that body in which there is much already heated blood, and it is sharp and causes fever, should have blood drawn from it at once, and a large quantity should be drawn, and the opening should be enlarged until syncope occurs, provided you have observed all the conditions of phlebotomy; and that you place your hand on his pulse near the blood vessel, so that death does not result instead of syncope, for this often happens when the phlebotomist is ignorant and negligent.
And it is not fitting, when you want to untie the arm and evacuate the blood a second time, that since the opening of the vein is already closed and the exit of the blood is made difficult, that you press on it with vehemence and bend it slightly, for this is very harmful.
Having left it until it is bled a second time; or remove it with the sharpness of the phlebotomy instrument that is coagulated by the blood in the opening of the vein; or place on it theriac alfarach, or sage, and compress it with light compression until the blood has flowed out.
And if the vein is abscessed, then leave it and do not touch it until the abscess is calmed.
And if necessity compels you to evacuate the blood a second time, and there is no excuse, then you bleed it in that place or in the other arm in another vein.
And the vein called "rope of the arm" is phlebotomized instead of the cephalic or basilic, when they are not found or are hidden, because it is composed of those.
And the quality of his phlebotomy is that the patient puts his hand in warm water until the vein reddens and appears manifestly.
Then it should be tightened with a bandage with moderate stricture; and then phlebotomize according to the small transversal, neither laterally nor lengthwise.
And let the opening be wide, and perform your phlebotomy where you phlebotomize it, a little above the joint of the hand.
And if the flow of blood is impeded, then put the hand back in warm water and let the blood flow into the water until you achieve your need.
But if you are in the summer days, then you are excused from putting the hand back in warm water, and the reason is that the body's blood is warmer in winter.
And phlebotomy from this vein is safer than from all other veins, because below it there is no pulsating vein, nor nerves.
And phlebotomy of the little finger vein of the right hand is beneficial for liver diseases.
And the manner of phlebotomy is that you bind the hand with a ligature or with your hand, after you have placed it in warm water, until the vein is swollen and clearly visible; and then phlebotomize it transversely; and if you incise it completely, it will not harm in any way.
And take care not to extend your incision too far with the phlebotomy, because below are the nerves of the fingers, denuded of flesh.
And then return the hand to warm water and let the blood flow into it, for if you do not return it to the warm water, the blood will coagulate in the opening of the vein, and the flow will be impeded.
And when the blood has been drawn in the necessary quantity, then place oil and salt on the vein, so that it is not quickly consolidated; and similarly you should proceed in every narrow branch.
But the benefit of phlebotomy in the left hand is that it is helpful for diseases of the spleen.
And perform the phlebotomy on him similarly as you have done on the other.
And the benefit of phlebotomy of the saphenous vein is for diseases that are in the lower part of the body, such as diseases of the womb, and retention of menses, and for the diseases of old sores and ulcers of the thighs and legs, and similar diseases.
And the manner of phlebotomy on him is that the patient should put his foot in warm water and rub it until the veins appear well; and tie it above the joint of the foot with a strap; and the place of the vein is usually apparent above the big toe, and from that, many branches are spread out on the surface of the foot.
Therefore, phlebotomize the largest branch below the leg, above the ankle, because it is better and healthier.
And if you phlebotomize that on the surface of the foot, then beware of the nerves that are below it on the surface of the foot, and perform your phlebotomy in such a way that you phlebotomize across, as if you wanted to incise it.
And let the phlebotomy be skillful.
But if the blood's outflow is prohibited; then you immerse his foot in warm water and let the blood flow into it until it is evacuated.
And if the phlebotomist errs on the first attempt, then repeat the phlebotomy a little higher, because the location is safe; and do not fear harming him, but beware of the nerves as we have said.
And similarly do the same to the saphenous vein of the other foot.
And of the sciatic vein, the location, as we have said, is below the heel, under the anklebone on the outer side.
And the benefit of phlebotomy for him is for hip pain when it is due to hot blood.
And the manner of his phlebotomy is that the patient enter a bath, and tighten his thigh from the side of the hip up to above the ankle with a long, thin bandage for four fingers, because it will not appear otherwise.
And then when it appears, then you phlebotomize that according to whatever method is possible for you and according to the transverse vein; that is better. Or incise it by incision or cut it by section, for its location is safe.
And it is often hidden in many men; and if you find it, and it does not appear to the touch at all, then phlebotomize one of its branches, and that is the one that appears on the back of the foot between the little toe and the ring finger.
And beware of the nerves, and let the blood flow in the quantity you desire.
And then loosen the bandage and place cotton over the phlebotomy site and bind the area tightly, for it heals easily.
Concerning cupping and the qualities of using them.
Cupping vessels are made of horn, or of brass, or of glass.
And cupping is done in two ways: one is with scarification and blood extraction, and the other is cupping without scarification.
And this cupping which is without scarification is done in two ways, for it is either with fire or without fire.
And the cupping vessels that are administered with scarification and blood extraction are applied to fourteen places of the body, of which one where cupping vessels are placed is at the occiput, which is the back part of the head; and the middle of the neck on both sides together; and cupping vessels on the chin below the jaw below the mouth; and cupping vessels on the two shoulder blades; and cupping vessels on the loins, which is above the end of the coccyx; and cupping vessels on the two hips, and they are on the two flanks; and cupping vessels on the two thighs; and cupping vessels on the two buttocks.
And cupping does not extract blood except from the small veins scattered in the flesh, and therefore it does not diminish the vital strength in the same way as phlebotomy; nor should cupping be done with fire or without fire in any illness caused by repletion until the whole body is evacuated.
But if necessity calls for cupping because of illness or a continued condition, we administer it at any time, at the beginning of the month and at the end of it, and in the middle of it and at any time.
Therefore, when one sees any of those conditions, and especially if it is in the third or middle part of the month, then we command that cupping be done after two or three hours of the day have passed.
And the benefit of cupping the nape of the neck is that when it relieves heaviness in the head and that which is affecting the eyes; but this should be done after evacuation of the whole body.
And this cupping is in the place of phlebotomy of the cephalic vein.
And it is not advisable to use it on someone of cold complexion, or in whom there is a catarrh, for it causes great harm to such a person.
And therefore it is not advisable to use it on the elderly, and on those whose heads are afflicted with cold illnesses.
But to one on whom it is continuously applied, forgetfulness is caused; and therefore you should instruct the cupper to place his hand lightly with the cupping glass at the lower parts, fearing the generation of forgetfulness.
But cupping with alkahel (likely referring to a specific substance or method) is in the place of phlebotomy of the dark vein (vena fusca) and the basilic vein: and therefore it is beneficial for asthma, and for the constriction of the throat, and for the rupture of an instrument in the throat (possibly a reference to a choking incident or injury), and for coughs, and for repletion (excess fluids).
And it is necessary that the alkahel cupping be applied a little higher, for if it is placed lower, it produces weakness in the body and in the stomach.
And cupping with alhagdahan (likely another specific substance or method) benefits pains affecting the head, and ophthalmia (eye inflammation), and migraine, and suffocation, and pains in the roots of the teeth; and it is in place of phlebotomy of the basilic vein.
And it is necessary that you instruct the cupper not to press his hand with the scarification, lest he injure the artery and cause a flow of blood.
And cupping below the chin benefits canker sores in the mouth, and corruption of the gums, and similar mouth diseases; and it is in place of phlebotomy of the [likely a specific vein in the lip area,  possibly a mis-transcription or archaic term] which are in the two lips.
But cupping that is done over the two shoulder blades benefits against caphatan (likely a specific illness or symptom), which is caused by an excess of heat.
And cupping on the two inner parts of the ankles is helpful instead of phlebotomy of three veins, that is, the basilic, median cubital (fusca - possibly a variation in naming), and cephalic veins, because it draws blood from all those smaller veins that are in the flesh, and those small veins from the other larger veins until the drawing reaches the three veins.
And command the cupper that he not proceed excessively in scarification, because the place is devoid of flesh, and underneath are nerves and arteries.
And there is a cupping glass with which one cups over the buttocks and it benefits against hemorrhoids of the anus and deeper ulcers.
And it is necessary that you command the cupper that it be a large cupping glass, and that it be of brass, because the place requires strong suction; and quickly thin cupping glasses are broken and it should be scarified with scarification.
Moreover, cupping of the legs diminishes by manifest reduction, because it draws blood from the whole body, and it benefits old pains of the joints and of the womb, and of the bladder; and it provokes menstruation, and benefits against boils and swellings; and it stands in place of phlebotomy of the two saphenous veins, and of the two iliac veins.
However, they greatly weaken the whole body and cause fainting in many men.
And of the iliac cuppings, the benefit is similar to the benefit of cuppings of the two legs.
And the quality of the placement of the cupping glasses is that you place the cupping glass initially empty and draw by tempered suction, and do not prolong the placement of the cupping glasses, but place those lightly, and remove those carefully, and that the humors come to the place by equal admixture. And do not cease to iterate this and continue until you see the place redden and swell and the redness of the blood appear.
And then you scarify and iterate the suction little by little, and consider the condition of the body.
Because that man who is of tender flesh and rare pores, it is necessary that you scarify him once and no more, lest the place be ulcerated.
And command the cupper to enlarge the scarification and make it somewhat deeper, and to moderate the suction with ease.
And if the blood is thick, then it is necessary to scarify twice, for in the first time the way of thinning is opened for the blood and its watery part. But in the second [scarification], to the scrutiny acquired by the extraction of thick blood.
And if the blood is very foul, then let a third scarification be made so that the desired result is achieved.
Finally, when we want to extract the blood little by little or a small amount, one scarification is enough for us.
And if we want extraction of much blood, we make many scarifications; and if we know that the blood is thick, then it is necessary that we scarify with deep scarifications.
And the term scarification refers to the depth of the incision only.
And if the skin of the one to be treated is thick, hard, dark, and its pores are constricted, the places for the cupping glasses should be anointed with emollient, opening, and resolving ointments; if it is in summer, such as aloe oil, violet oil, sweet almond oil, or poppy seed oil; and if it is in winter, then narcissus oil, lily oil, chamomile oil, or blood oil, and similar things.
And if the excess [humor] is thick and cold, then the oil should be amaranth oil, or balm oil, or aloe oil, or anise oil, and similar things.
But if the patient has large pores and tender flesh, then the use of oil should be prohibited, and for such a one, the places for cupping should be washed with vinegar or cold water of nightshade, or with poppy water, or with  water of borage, and similar things.
And the one whose blood is of much humidity, wash his cupping sites with sour wine, or with myrtle and sumac water, and similar things.
And for the one whose humors are thick, wash his cupping sites with old wine, or with water of bugleweed (or marjoram), or with a decoction of anise, or of chamomile, and similar things.
And the cupping should be performed before the bath; rather, it should be administered about an hour or two before the bath, and he should sleep after the cupping.
What is required to regulate the patient before cupping or phlebotomy?
It is necessary to consider at the beginning: if the person to be cupped or bled is choleric and has sharp, inflamed blood, then he should take cooling things, such as sour pomegranates, endive in sour wine, lettuce, hemp seed, julep, and similar things.
And give him foods such as chicken, and the meat of domestic birds, and foods seasoned with acids, and the like.
And for one whose complexion is cold, he should drink syrup of almonds, or syrup of hemp seed, and sumac, and very fragrant wine, between autumn and winter; and he should be advised to use little drink and food, and give him foods such as chicken, hemp seed, peas, small birds, and doves.
And it is necessary that on the day of cupping and phlebotomy, his drink should be greater than his food.
And it is necessary that at certain hours some men be given theriac, or medications of musk, that is, nutmeg, or theriac before cupping or phlebotomy, or shortly before, so that the principal members may be comforted and the blood may be thinned; and they should not take those heating things.
But the cuppings that are without scarification should be cuppings that are placed on the liver, and on the spleen and gout, and on the navel, in the places of the knees, and the urinary bladder, because these members do not tolerate scarification on them.
And it is not desired for those except the attraction of blood from a member, just as we place a cupping glass on the breast in a disease of nasal bleeding; and we use this so that cold, invisible windiness may be dissolved from the member, just as we place it on the belly and navel; for this rarefies the member and warms it and diminishes the pain because it resolves windiness.
And it is placed on the nostrils when obstruction or swelling occurs in them, for by the virtue of strong attraction it quickly opens the obstruction and eradicates the swelling from its place.
And similarly it acts when it is placed on the liver and spleen because of windiness enclosed in them.
And these cuppings are administered empty with suction only; and sometimes they are administered with fire.
And sometimes they are administered full of lukewarm water in diseases of the spleen.
And this is so that the cupping glass is filled and is larger; that is, hot water alone, or water in which herbs suitable for this purpose have been boiled.
Method of applying a fire cupping glass: let the width of the opening be two fingers, as we have formed it; and the length of the cup be half a palm; and let it be on the side of the patient, in the location that is in the circumference, half of it; the hole should be small enough that only a needle can enter it.
Let it be made of bronze, copper, or tin, with thick edges, smooth, even, and polished so that it does not injure the limb due to its position on it.
And in the middle of it let there be a transverse bar of bronze or iron, on which a candle with fire is placed.
And now let this cupping glass be larger than the one we have described; and the smaller one smaller than that, according to the illnesses and the age of the one who uses it.
And the cupping glasses for infants and thin people are different from the cupping glasses for youths and those with large bodies.
And the way to apply this cupping glass with fire to the limb is to extend the wick with a decent wood fire before a small wax candle, and place that on the middle of the transverse bar in the middle of the cupping glass, so that the fire is kindled around the part underneath so that the patient's body is not burned.
And then it should be placed on the patient's limb, and the finger should be on the hole we have mentioned, until when we hold the cupping glasses and do not need to remove the finger and have the vapor escape through that hole, then the cupping glass will immediately be dissolved (i.e., the suction will cease).
And then ignite the wick according to its manner, and repeat this if you need to.
But in cupping, which is administered in the illness of pleurisy, with water, in which there is no transverse bar or hole, and is not administered unless it is filled with water, and is placed on the limb only.
And this is its form: And this cupping glass, the larger it is, the better it is, because it can receive a greater quantity of water.
Chapter 97.
Leeches are not administered to many limbs, but only to those limbs in which the placement of cupping glasses is not possible, because of their smallness, such as the ear and gums and similar parts; or on a limb lacking flesh, such as a finger and nose and similar parts.
And the quality of using those is that you should find leeches in fresh waters of clean stagnant pools.
And then let them be left day and night in fresh water until they are hungry, and that no substance remains in their bellies; and then let the body be evacuated at the beginning with phlebotomy and cupping; and then rub the limb of the patient until it reddens; and then let them be placed upon it.
And when they are full and fall off.
And if it is possible to draw blood from the area with a cupping glass, it is more beneficial afterwards.
And if not, then wash the area with vinegar and then with warm water; and let it be rubbed and squeezed.
And if the flow of blood is prolonged near the application of the leeches, and it is oozing, then you dip a cloth in cold water, and place that over it until the oozing is stopped.
And if the bleeding is excessive, then sprinkle crushed vitriol, or gallnuts and similar styptic substances, over it until the bleeding stops; or place halves of roasted beans on the area, and leave them until the beans stick to the area and the bleeding stops.
And it is necessary, if needed, to reiterate the application of leeches, when it is possible to change those.
And if the leeches are prevented from adhering, then rub the area with fresh blood or prick the area with a needle until blood appears; and then apply them, because when they sense any blood they immediately attach.
And when you want them to fall off, sprinkle a little crushed aloe, or salt, or ash, on them, and they will fall off immediately.
Thus begins the prologue of the third part: On Restoration. This chapter is very often necessary in the art of medicine; and it is the restoration of fractures and accidental dislocations in the bones.
O, son, know that foolish and common physicians boast of this chapter, those who never looked at the books of the Ancients nor read a letter of them.
And for this reason, this method among the learned in our land is neglected; and I have never forgotten this at any time; and I have not acquired this except through long reading of the books of the Ancients and study of their understanding, until I extracted the science from them.
And I have applied myself to experiment and study throughout my life.
And I have described in this chapter all that my knowledge contains and on which my experience is based; since I have abbreviated it for you and delivered it from the burden of length; and I have abbreviated it to the point of brevity; and I have shown it to the point of clarity; and I have shown many forms of the instruments that are used in it, as is done by way of explanation, as I have done in the two preceding chapters.
Chapter one.
Summaries and collections on the subject of bone fractures, those which are necessary to preface before we begin the discussion of broken bones and the various types of each. Therefore, I will say in the preface to this chapter the summaries of the discourse; and the chapters to the understanding of which the craftsman is obligated at the beginning and to stand upon the truth of those things; that is, you and those who are ready to know or learn this noble art besides yourselves.
And therefore I say that when a fracture, dislocation, sprain, or fall happens to someone, then you must attend to it at the beginning with phlebotomy or purging, or both together, if no cause prohibits it, such as weakness of virtue, or if the one to whom it happened is a child, or an old person in decrepitude, or it is a time of intense heat, or intense cold.
And furthermore, let him be content with a diet of cool herbs and the meat of birds and rabbits; and we prohibit rich meats and filling foods and all food that fills the veins with blood, until you are assured of a warm abscess, and if you do not fear effusion of matter to the limb.
And then return the patient to his former regimen, with which he is accustomed.
And so, as the broken bone begins to be restored, then it is necessary that the patient be fed nutritious foods, of much and thick and heavy nourishment in which there is viscosity, such as foods made from wheat cooked with water, and rice, and heads [presumably of grain], and peas, and cow bellies, and eggs, and fresh fish, and thick wine and things similar to those; and with this regimen, the coagulation of the fracture is made more lightly and better.
And know that broken bones, when they are in men who are in the first age [youth] and in the decrepit, it is not possible that they are continued and consolidated according to their nature because of the desiccation of their limbs.
However, nature adjusts and brings to the broken bone from every part some substance similar to glue, in which there is thickness that adheres and binds that until they are together conglutinated and tied together, until they come to the end of strength and firmness, like fire at the beginning, until no cause prohibits it from its work.
And for this reason it is necessary that you provide the patient with foods in which there is gravity, viscosity, and thickness, as we have said.
And know that the types of fracture are diverse according to the diversity of the members, for a fracture of the bone of the leg is different from a fracture of the bone of the head; and a fracture of the bone of the foot is different from a fracture of the bone of the arm; and similarly all the other members are different among themselves.
And I come with a remembrance of every type of fracture, explained in its own chapter distinct from the others.
Much diversity of fracture in itself. And the types of bone fracture are diversified in themselves; for there is an arcuate fracture, besides those that happen in the ribs; and sometimes a fracture is made according to the length of the bone: and these are the fractures of the shaft and splinters and additions proceeding and not proceeding, just as is done in the quill when it is prepared for writing, and there is a fracture with a wound and disruption in the head, and there is a small fissure fracture.
And for each type there is an appropriate device or treatment in its restoration, as will be remembered distinctly in its place.
Many signs of bone fracture. And by this a bone fracture is known: its crookedness, and the prominence and appearance of it to the touch, and that of it when we compress it with the hand.
And therefore, when there is no apparent crookedness in the place, nor is it felt by your touch when you touch the bone with agitation, and the patient does not find great pain, then there is no fracture here.
However, it is possible that there is a crookedness or small fissure, in which case you should not move it with your hand and with complete compression; however, place on it the medicines of which mention is made near that moment which suits the place; and then it should be bound tightly with a thin bandage.
And know that if the place is arched and is not split in two, or other things which do not happen to it, such as being completely separated from its counterpart, then you must begin at your hour with its rectification before an abscess or burning happens to it.
And if a burning abscess happens to it, then leave it for a few days until the abscess ceases; and then dress it according to whatever light and ingenious method you can.
And know that the restoration and healing of it is easier than of a bone in which a similar injury has occurred.
And then bind it as the recollection of it shall come.
But if the injury is in the bone, then extension of that broken member is necessary from two parts, if it is the hand or the foot; or with your hand if the member is small; or with two cords or with one cord and a hand.
And let your position be such that you place the member in a dressing according to its natural shape, while the parts of the broken member are being extended, then you are forced to return those additions with ingenuity and in any way that you can to their places.
And take care, according to your strength, that neither pain nor injury befall the patient through your operation; and force yourself, according to your ability, to apply one bone to the other, its companion, according to their best forms.
And it is necessary that at that time you profitably touch that with your hand, and if you see here some different cause, rectify that and adjust that according to the amount of your skill.
And avoid vehement extension and compression, as many foolish physicians do, who often cause a hot abscess through their operation, or cause contraction in the member, as we have seen this through their operation many times.
And the quality of the binding of the quieted member is that which I recount; so that you know that broken members are diversified in their smallness and in their greatness and in their form.
And for those that are small, such as the arm and the finger and the penis and similar to those, then it is necessary that the wrapping be of very fine cloth.
But those that are large, such as the thigh or the leg, it is necessary that in those there be a wide and firm wrapping, for the wide binding connects the large member and tightens it on all sides with even binding, in such a way that no blemish enters it.
Then begin, then your evacuation of equalization, to place a bandage suitable for this, over the place of that fracture with three or four wrappings according to what the member deserves; and tighten your hand a little with the bandage.
And then come with that to the highest part of the place of the fracture, and tighten less than you did your binding with which you have tightened the place of the fracture. And then extend yourself with a wrapping of the place of the fracture a little, and soften the binding little by little, until you take from the place its great part.
And then take another bandage and wrap that other time over the broken place with a wrapping, and then come with the wrappings to the lowest part of the fracture; and let your operation be in the tightening of the wrapping and in the softening of that according to what we have said in the first wrapping above.
And then place between the wrappings tow or linen cloth with which the tortuosity of the fracture is filled, if there is tortuosity in it; and if not, do not place anything there.
And then place another bandage over it, and then wrap over these bandages well-made splints immediately, if there is no inflammation or hot abscess in the place, and then place over it that which dries the abscess and removes the inflammation; and leave that for some days; and then you tighten the splints over it.
And let the splints be half the width of a reed, and well-formed wisely; or let them be of pine wood; or of palm branches; and let the width of each splint be according to this form and this figure:
However, it is necessary that the splint that is placed over the fracture be a little thicker and wider than the other splints, and the length of the splint according to what is needed for the limb in size and smallness; and then tighten over the splints with another bandage according to your first tightening; and then tie over it with thread decently as we have said of tightening, and it is that your tightening be according to the place of the fracture more, and the more it is distant from the fracture, the less the tightening.
And it is necessary that the threads be moderate in thickness and fineness, and be of linen; and if the threads are thick, as I have seen by the operation of certain fools placing their threads of twisted ropes, and it is a great error, when the tightening loses equality.
And likewise, very fine threads are not convenient, because you will not achieve with them what you want by tightening, and it is not necessary that there be less than one finger's width between splint and splint.
And if the patient is hurt by the ends of the splints near the binding in those places, then place under those parts linen or carded wool until that does not injure him.
Sometimes a fracture is accompanied by a wound, and a disruption occurs in the bone, and I will come to a remembrance of that in the following chapter according to its singularity.
And know that not every broken limb is splinted on the first day; the reason for this is that, when the limb is large, you should not place splints on it except after about five or seven days, or more, according to your certainty of the occurrence of a hot abscess.
And this is the manner of the plasters with which the Ancients used to restore, which are placed on fractures, dislocations, and sprains.
Method of a common plaster, briefly described, for the restoration of fractures, suitable for many constitutions and especially for women and children, because it is of such a nature that neither heat nor cold overcomes it: and it is that you take some miller's dust, which is the pith of the flour that settles on the walls of the mill during the milling process.
And prepare it as it is, except that you sieve it with egg white, and make the application neither thick nor thin; and then use it.
Another method of a plaster restoring fractures, dislocations, and sprains: take of asafoetida, of ladanum, of acacia, of elecampane, and of megrach (which is the root of wild pomegranate), of each one drachm; of myrrh and aloes, five drachms; of aloechil, twenty drachms; all should be crushed and sieved and mixed with aloe water or with egg white if the patient's constitution is hot; and then use this plaster, for it is of good composition and restores lightly broken bones, and benefits many people.
Another method for a plaster which benefits fractures and sprains: take megrach and the root of white mallow, ten drachms each; of myrrh and aloes, five drachms each; of acacia, six drachms; of Armenian bole, twenty drachms.
All should be crushed in a mortar with great care, and be sieved, and be mixed with water or with egg white and be applied.
A method for a plaster for joints and bones separated from their places, and if pain occurs in those and in fissures and fractures: let soiled wool be taken and submerged in sour wine and boiled oil and be placed on the area.
However, this plaster does not have the virtue of restoration, but rather of drawing out hot abscesses and expelling pain specifically.
Another method for a plaster that restores a broken bone: take fresh fig leaves and wild poppy leaves; pound everything and make a plaster from them.
Method for a brief plaster administered for the restoration of a bone fracture and when you desire resolution of the remaining abscess: take roots of marshmallow, of chamomile, and violet flowers, of barley flour, of all equal parts; let all be crushed and mixed with wine, if the limb is not inflamed.
But if it is inflamed, then prepare it with moistened coriander water or with water and use it.
Another method for a plaster more potent in resolution than the first, when a hard abscess occurs during the restoration of the limb: take roots of marshmallow and flaxseed, and of althea, and melilot, marjoram, violet flowers, chamomile, of all equal parts; let all be crushed and mixed with willow water or with fresh water or with wine, all this according to the quality of the limb and the repose of its color.
However, Hippocrates did not say in his book that it should be placed on the broken limb during its restoration except a cerate made of wax and oil and nothing else; and he recommends that it be of medium consistency between thick and thin.
But in Gaul it is seen that they are placed on the broken limb during its restoration, and the substances which are drying with little heat are like myrrh, incense, and similar to those substances that we have mentioned.
Method for a plaster that benefits injury and pain: take  mint,  wax,  shaved human hair or bird down, and marshmallow, and salt, equal parts; let them be crushed and sifted and mixed, and let a plaster be made.
But the amount of time the bandage should remain and then be loosened, is that you should consider whether no pain or itching has occurred, and the bone is not broken or dislodged from its place; then you should not loosen it for many days. And if intense pain or itching or swelling occurs at the site, then immediately loosen or untie it at that moment, and remove the plaster from it.
And take linen cloth and a moist sea sponge, and submerge it in lukewarm water, and with that wash the area until that itching ceases and the pain is calmed; and then let the limb rest for an hour; and then place over it soiled wool submerged in sour wine and oil or rose oil, and bind it for a night until you are sure of a hot abscess, and that the swelling of the limb has subsided, and its pain is reduced.
And then repeat that subtle constriction and small plaster and do not tighten it with your first constriction, but subtly with that until it is healed.
And if you see that the abscess, the redness, the pain, the swelling, and all the symptoms are now completely reduced, and you judge that the plaster and constriction are unnecessary, then you repeat that as you did at the beginning, similarly.
And if none of the conditions we have mentioned occurs in the limb, then do not untie it before three or four or five or seven days; and sometimes all this is left for twenty days, according to what appears to you upon unbinding the limb, as we have said, until the fracture adheres, and approaches the coagulation of the flesh over it.
And then adjust the constriction more than in your first constriction overall, and adjust it to the increase in the patient's flesh, according to the progress of their recovery.
But if you see the site of the fracture drying and thinning more than is appropriate, then know that nourishment is prevented from reaching it; and therefore, bathe it with lukewarm water every time you untie it; and let this be done every three days; and loosen the constriction a little, and by this operation, nourishment will reach the limb, and it will be healed easily.
But what foolish restorers of a fractured limb do, when it is not set properly at the beginning, and is set crookedly, is an error according to their operation, and a great danger, and if this were proper, the Ancients would have greatly magnified it in their books and would have worked with it.
And I have not seen any of them do this, wherefore it is more reasonable that you do not do it.
Chapter Two: On fractures when they occur in the head.
The types of fractures are many, and their forms are diverse, and the causes are distinct, for some fractures are caused by a blow from a sword, and the blow crushes all the bone into the ciphac (likely referring to the spongy bone), which is beneath the bone, just as a wedge does in wood, and for this reason this type is called *ascial* (likely a term for a splintered or comminuted fracture); or the sword cuts some part of the bone, and cuts its flesh but does not penetrate to the back of it; and this type of fracture is called *levatio absoluta* (likely a term for an incomplete or superficial fracture).
And the wound of these two fractures is either large or small, and of a fracture which is comminuted or abraded; and its cause is a blow with a blunt object or a fall onto a stone, and similar things.
And this fracture is either penetrating, so that it approaches the periosteum which is beneath the bone; or it is on the surface of the bone, and the wound of these two fractures is either large or small.
And there is a fracture which is hidden in the bone, as fine as a small hair, and for this reason this type is called a capillary fracture.
And there is a fracture which is caused by a fall or by a blow from a stone and the like, which causes some lamina of the bone to enter into the inner parts, and is made in a concave place, as happens to the plates of bronze when they receive a blow and part of them enters into the inner parts.
And this happens especially in the bodies of moist bones, such as the heads of children.
And in all these kinds of comminuted fractures, the pieces are like separated stars. And I will bring back all of this into its place (I will reduce it).
And we recognize all these kinds of fractures by probing them and by investigating them with probes, and by removing the corrupted flesh that is over them.
And a hairline fracture is known because it is uncovered on the bone, and is wiped clean, and is examined with a probe, for the fracture appears black.
But in the treatment of a fracture, consider first the patient's symptoms.  And then, if you see by the symptoms that it signifies by manifest indication danger, such as vomiting of bile, and prostration, and loss of consciousness, and loss of voice, and syncope, and acute fever, and swelling of the eyes and redness of them, and similar symptoms in the more serious cases, undoubtedly it is not healing.
And if you see no unusual symptoms and you expect recovery, then you begin his treatment.
The reason is that if the wounded person has come to you at the beginning, as wounded, and this is in the winter days, then it is necessary that you study the setting of the bone before the fourteenth day, according to all circumstances.
And if it is in the summer days, then it is necessary that you strive to set the bone before the seventh day, before that which is under the bone is corrupted by the pus, and before the symptoms that we have recounted occur.
And if the fracture has already reached the membrane covering the brain, and is with small pieces and attrition, then it is necessary that you incise the comminuted and atrophied part, as I shall explain to you.
And it is so that you shave the head of the wounded patient, and uncover the bone according to custom and manner as much as possible according to the shape of the wound, and that it is light on the patient.
And if you encounter, during the uncovering of the bone, a flow of blood or a hot abscess, then you oppose it with what is necessary, and you fill the place with cloths soaked in wine and rose oil, and let the wound rest until the abscess is settled and the bleeding is stopped; and then begin with the encircling of the bone and its removal.
And this should be done according to one of two methods of operation.
And one method is that you incise the bone with a narrow incisor, and this is its form:  And then apply another incisor, this one, a little wider than that one; and this is its form:
And then apply even wider incisors than the second.
And it is necessary that you have a number of different incisors, some of which are wider than others; and some of them are shorter than others, and let them be sharp at the ends, and be made of Indian iron or steel.
And use them with ease in percussion on the incisor so that you do not strike the head and injure it.
And if the bone is strong, hard, then it is necessary that you perforate its circumference before you apply the incisors with the drills, which are called shallow drills.
And they are not so named except because those do not reach the limit of the skull bone near it, because the drill has a round end or edge on that which is below its sharp head, similar to a rim or small circle, which prevents it from being submerged and passing the thickness of the bone.
And it is convenient that you take a large number of these drills, each of which suits the thickness of each bone, until you have at hand for all parts of the skull a drill whose point is sharp, the length and shortness being according to the thickness of that part of the skull.
And this is the manner of three types of drills: The method of perforating the circumference of the broken bone is that you place the drill on the bone and turn it with your fingers until you know that the bone is pierced; then move the drill to another place, and place them so that the space between each hole is the size of the radius, or thereabouts.
And then incise with incisors that which is between each hole in the bone, and make it as thin as you can in order to lighten it, as we have said, until you remove the bone, either with your hand, or with some other means by certain instruments which you will have prepared for this, such as fine pincers and forceps.
And it is necessary that you take great care that the incisor does not touch anything of the brain.
And so when you have encircled the bone by perforating it, and it is separated from the brain if it is continuous with it, and you have extracted it, it is necessary that you scrape and smooth its roughness with another instrument similar to an incisor, but however it must be thinner and more delicate than the other incisors.
And if any part of the small and splintered bones remains, then take that away easily with whatever instrument you have; and then cure the wound with liniments and ointments which we have mentioned.
And another method of operation is easier, far from fear, which Galen described and praised highly; and this is his discourse: it is necessary for you at the beginning to begin uncovering the part of the bone at the place where the fracture is most violent and most evident, until when you have uncovered that part and have placed beneath it the extremity of that slow and gentle incisor of which this is the form:
And it is so that the lenticular part is smooth and does not cut anything, and the sharp part is divided into two edges lengthwise, like a wedge; so that the lenticular part is fitted to the brain with its face, the sharp edge cutting into the bone.
And then strike the incisor on one side with a small mallet until you incise all the bone easily as it is revolved, and you are sure of the pannicle that no accident happens to it in any way, even if the physician were the most foolish of all men and the most ignorant of them; certainly, and even if he were sleeping.
Then, if any part remains attached to the bone of the pannicle in any place of the bone, incise that with the extremity of that lenticular incisor, and remove that easily, for it is removed without harm and without fear.
And if the fracture of the bone does not penetrate into the pannicle, and what is separated or removed from the bone is its surface, and there remain roughness and small splinters, then it is necessary to scrape away that roughness and remove those splinters with fine rasps for which you have prepared several, of different sizes, so that it is possible for you to use the most suitable and correct of these according to what you are doing in your operation on that broken bone and its form.
And it is necessary that you begin your rasping of the bone with the widest of those rasps, and then use progressively the finer ones, and do not cease to do this continuously until you arrive at using the finest and most subtle of all those.
But in each of the other small, capillary fractures and subtle fractures, it is necessary to administer care according to what you are doing for their rectification.
And it is a matter which is not hidden from all those who have studied that art. And I stand by what we have shown written above regarding large fractures.
And if the panniculus (skin and subcutaneous tissue) is retracted when you reduce the bone, then it is necessary that you take linen cloth according to the size of the wound, and immerse that in rose oil, and place that over the opening of the wound; and then take another doubled or tripled cloth and immerse it in wine and rose oil and place that over the thin cloth, and do this as lightly as you can, so as not to weigh down the fractured bone; and then apply a linen bandage over that, and do not tighten it except to the extent that it holds the wound only.
And leave it with this dressing for a day or two until you are sure of a hot abscess; and then untie it and then administer medicines with which to draw out superfluous moisture, such as flaxseed, barley flour, and powder of lentils and birthwort, and similar things.
And it is so that you make a powder of these medicines to be dusted over the wound, once they are dry; and universally, apply to it any medicine whose property is to cleanse and not to bite (i.e., cause further irritation).
And take care, according to your ability, that the wound in your treatment remains clean; and let there be no filth of ointment or other matter; nor allow virulence to accumulate there; for when it is applied to the panniculus of the brain, it corrupts and poisons it, and this evil causes great harm to the patient.
And it happens in a fracture of the head, as the bone is cleansed from it, and especially when its treatment is neglected, and there is blackness on its surface; and therefore consider then, if the patient suffers the accidents that we have described, know that it is pernicious without any doubt.
And if there is blackness not from the medicine that is placed on top, but it is by virtue of that medicine that causes that blackness, then it is necessary that you take one part of honey and three parts of rose oil, and with these moisten a cloth, and then place that on the fracture; and then treat it with the appropriate healing remedies until it is healed.
Chapter 3.
On the restoration of the nose when it is broken.
Know that the nose is not broken except in two parts joined together, or one of these sometimes, because in it there are two bones, for the lower part is cartilaginous, and it is not broken and there is only abrasion, crookedness and sinuosity to it.
But if one of the two parts of it is broken, then it is necessary that you insert your little finger into their nose, and that you align that fracture inside with your index finger, and with the thumb outside, until the nose returns to its natural shape. And let this be done by you with ease, and take care that you do not cause pain to the patient through your operation.
And if the fracture is in the upper part of the nose, and the finger does not reach it, then it must be aligned with the end of a rod which has a small thickening.
And if the fracture is in two parts, then you do the same for both.
And take care to restore it on the first day of the fracture, if possible; and if not, then around the seventh or tenth day you should treat the resulting inflammation with cautery.
And then insert into the end of the nose a small roll of linen cloth, if the fracture is in one part, or two small wedges, if the fracture is in two parts, and let the size of the wedge be such as to fill the opening in the nose.
And some of the ancient restorers say that the wedges should be soaked in pitch and changed every day, but I have not seen this done; rather it is necessary that the roll be soaked in egg white mixed with mill dust; and then leave the wedge there until the bone is set and the cartilage is hardened.
And sometimes, instead of a wedge, a goose feather, wrapped in linen cloth, is inserted into the nose; and this is especially useful when the nasal fracture is more severe and the patient's breathing is not obstructed.
And this method is not necessary for you; and if you wish, do this, and if you wish, use wedges.
And if another time a hot abscess occurs, apply a plaster to the nose with cerate or cotton soaked in sour wine and rose oil, or with diachylon.
But if a hot abscess does not occur, then it is necessary to plaster it externally with sesame flour and boiled lentil powder mixed with egg white; and then place linen cloth over it, and do not bind the nose with anything.
But if the nasal bones are broken with a small fracture or are comminuted, then it is necessary to incise over them, and extract them with instruments suitable for this; and then sew the incision, and treat it with what promotes granulation and consolidation, and with plasters suitable for this.
And if a wound occurs inside the nose, then it is necessary to treat it with wedges and administer lead canulas until it is completely healed.
Chapter 4.
Concerning the restoration of the jaw when it is fractured.
When the lower jaw is broken and the fracture is not accompanied by a wound, observe then if the fracture is only external, and is not broken in two and is bent inwards at the parts, then its diagnosis is easy.
And it is necessary then, if the fracture is on the right side, that you insert your left index finger into the patient's mouth; and similarly if the fracture is in the left jaw, then insert the index finger of your right hand; and push with that the projection of the fracture inwards, easily towards the outer parts, with your other hand from the outside of the bone; thus decently equalize it.
And if the fracture of the jaw is already separated into two, then it is necessary that you administer extension from two sides according to straightness until its equalization is possible.
And if there is concussion of teeth with disruption, then bind those which you hope will remain with gold or silver wire or silk; and then place over the broken jaw a cerate, and then place over it a doubled cloth, and place over the cloth a suitably made large compress, or a piece of linen equal to the length of the jaw; and then bind that above as the binding appears suitable to you and as the application requires, until it is healed.
And command the patient to use rest and tranquility, and give him food of sorbitious lions.  (Note: "sorbicios leons" is likely a corruption or unusual phrasing.  It may refer to easily digestible foods, or a specific type of food mentioned in other medieval texts - further research into medieval culinary terms would be needed for a definitive translation.)
And if you estimate that the form is already altered in some way, then you should consider and unbind it on the third day; and then rectify that which is already altered and plaster it with powdered barley, with egg white, or with starch, after you have removed the cerate, and place wool over the plaster.
And then, since this plaster is attached and adjusted to it, and the disposition of the bone is not altered, leave it; do not unbind it until it is healed and the fracture is firm; for many times this fracture is fixed in three weeks.
And if another time a hot abscess occurs, then administer what we have said many times in its sedation until it is healed, and that abscess is softened.
And if the fracture is with a wound, then consider if a piece of the bone is separated or splintered; then you should carefully remove those splinters with whatever is suitable for that in removing them from the instruments.
And if the opening of the wound is narrow, then you should enlarge it with a fleam according to your need.
And then, when you have removed those splinters, and nothing remains of them, then you should sew the opening of the wound if it is wide; and if not, place on it one of the plasters that is suitable for it and heals it, until it is healed.
Chapter 5.
Concerning the restoration of the clavicle when it is broken.
Often the clavicle is broken in the front part above the muscle, and this fracture occurs in one of three ways.
Because it is either broken, or separated, or separated into two parts without splinters; and it is easy to restore; or it is such that splinters are present, and it is difficult to restore; or it is such that the fracture is accompanied by a wound.
And the operation in this case, when the fracture is without a wound, is that you have two assistants present, so that one holds the broken clavicle and supports it, and the other extends the neck towards that side.
Then bind the fracture with your fingers until its shape is correctly formed, and there is neither prominence nor concavity.
And if you need more extension, then you should place under the patient's armpit a pad of cloth or wool, its size according to your need; and extend and elevate the clavicle and compress the pad with your hand until you bind the fracture as needed.
And if you cannot pull the end of the clavicle outwards because it is stuck to the sternum, then the patient should lie supine on their neck, and you should place a moderately sized cushion on the muscle.
And the assistant presses the muscle downwards until the bone of the clavicle which is above the sternum is elevated, and then you straighten the fracture and bind it with your fingers.
But if you feel splinters of the clavicle and they are loose, then you should make an incision over it and remove those splinters easily.
And if it is retained in the bone, then you should carefully incise it with one of the scalpels which you have prepared for this, after having placed under the clavicle the instrument that serves as a splint; and this instrument is of wood or iron, of which this is the form:
And it is similar to a spoon, of which this is the concavity; and let its width be according to your need, according to the size or smallness of the bone.
But its length should be as long as is possible for you during the operation; it should have two ends like this, one end wide and the other narrow.
And if the disruption of the wound which you have incised when you extracted the splinter from the bone is wide, and there is a risk of a hot abscess, then you should join the two edges of the wound with sutures.
And if the disruption is small, or you fear a hot abscess, then you should fill the wound with cloths and powders according to the size of the wound's incision.
And if a hot abscess occurs, then soak a cloth in sharp vinegar and rose oil and wine, and place it on top.
And ensure that the splint is not moved from over the broken bone.  Therefore, you must see the patient each day, because when the ligament is softened or you see that the splint has shifted, then you must correct this and tighten the bandage.
Then place the patient's pillow under his neck, and place a small cushion under his scrotum at night beneath the pillow. This ensures that, with this elevation, the help (support) is given to that part, and thus the fracture of the clavicle (furcula) is elevated by the muscle; or his arm should be tied to his neck.
And do not untie the bandage unless an abscess or swelling occurs at the site, before twelve days have passed.
Then renew the plaster if you see the need, and adjust the bandage, and restore it, and leave it until the fracture of the clavicle (furcula) is healed and consolidated.
And it is strengthened and healed, according to the case, in twenty-eight days, and sometimes in some men it is done in less time than that.
Chapter 6.
Concerning the restoration of a shoulder fracture.
The shoulder blade is broken at its lateral side, and not shattered, but only the margins are broken.
And so when the location of the break — and it is broken in the middle of the location — is unknown except by touch, then, according to the nature of the fracture, forcefully prepare it and reduce it to its natural form in every way possible to you.
Then place on the area powdered finely ground albumen of an egg and lion's mane; then place a dusting of doubled cloth; then place over it a thin linen bandage, according to the size of the whole shoulder blade or a little more.
But if the bandage shows a concavity in any part of the shoulder blade, then you should fill that concavity with lion's mane, and then tighten the bandage evenly.
And then bind it above with a long bandage with a decent constriction and firmness of the bandage until it is not moved from its place.
And examine the binding each day; and every time it is loosened, bind it again and tighten it, and adjust the bandage if it has moved from its place.
And have the patient lie on their healthy side.
And the shoulder blade is restored in twenty days or in twenty-five.
And so when that number is complete, then you unbind it, and you should know for certain that it is from the bones of which the beginning is not feared nor their dissolution.
And if it proceeds from the location of the collarbone and extends below the clavicle, then you incise over it, and remove it, and proceed as we have said in the fracture of the clavicle regarding the cauterization of an abscess if it should occur here.
Chapter 7.
Of the restoration of a fractured foot.
The foot is sometimes broken in the middle, and this heals slowly; but its extremities heal much more quickly, even if they are crushed and comminuted.
And among the accidents when the middle of the foot is broken, it inclines towards the inner parts and causes great pain, difficulty in breathing, cough, strong fever, and vomiting of blood; and it is evident in the cavity of the broken bone and is not hidden from sensation.
And its restoration is that the patient should be laid supine on his back, with a cushion placed between his shoulders; then press gently on his muscles, and adjust the bones with the hands on both sides, subtly working on it and manipulating it in every way possible and appropriate, until the bone's shape is restored as it should be.
Then place a plaster and lint over it, and place over this a splint of thin willow or lime wood, or similar in lightness, after wrapping it in cloth; then carefully bind this over the broken bone so that it is not loose; and bind it with a circular bandage to the back sometimes, and tighten it with appropriate firmness; and then check the bandage frequently, and tighten it when it becomes loose.
And if necessity demands loosening of the bandage because of corrosion or itching, or pain, or an abscess that might occur at the site, then carefully unbind it, remove the plaster and correct what has happened using appropriate treatment; and then reapply the plaster, if the situation allows; and adjust the firmness until it is healed.
Chapter 8.
On the restoration of ribs when they are broken.
Know that a fracture of the ribs only happens in the thicker parts, which are two; and in their extremities towards the front,  destruction does not occur because they are cartilaginous. And the knowledge of it is not hidden from the sense of its examination by touch.
And the restoration should be thus: equalize the fracture with your fingers as much as possible, until it is aligned as it should be, and then plaster and bind the broken bone with a bandage, if it needs that.
And if the fracture of the ribs is towards the inner parts, then the patient suffers vehement pain and a stabbing sensation, like the stabbing pain that occurs in one who has pleurisy, and this is because the bone pierces the membrane; and it causes difficulty in breathing, coughing, and vomiting of much blood; and this is difficult to cure.
And the Ancients were ingenious in treating this with many devices.
And of them it is said: it is necessary that you give the patient foods that cause inflation and flatulence, so that the belly is inflated and distended, and the fracture is pushed outwards.
But we avoid this so that it does not lightly cause a hot abscess if it does not already exist; and if it already exists, then it helps with that.
And some of them say that a cupping glass should be placed on top and that it should draw with strength; and this seems reasonable, but it is feared that the cupping glass will draw superfluities to the place because of weakness.
And some of them say: the place should be covered with wool that has been submerged in hot oil, and powders should be placed between the ribs until it is full, so that the bandage is even as it envelops that area according to its roundness; and then the patient should be treated with a treatment for pleurisy, with diet and medicine.
And if a violent cause constricts the patient, which he cannot bear, and the bone pierces the skin with a lacerating puncture, threatening the patient, then it is necessary to cut open the area, uncover the broken rib, and then place on it an instrument that preserves the *ciphác* (likely referring to a specific surgical instrument or technique, the exact meaning lost to time), the remembrance of which is mentioned before, and that we incise the bone easily and extract it.
And then we join the two lips of the wound, if it is large, with sutures, and we treat it with plasters until it is healed.
And if an abscess forms inside, then you should take and pour powders into rose oil and place it on the area, and the patient should be treated with what is appropriate for an internal abscess.
And let him be supine on the side on which he sleeps until he is healed.
Chapter 9.
Chapter 9: Of the restoration of a fracture of the spine and of the neck.
Sometimes a fracture occurs in the bones of the neck, and it is slow to heal, and similarly in the vertebrae of the back. And when this happens to someone and you want to know if he will be healed or not, then consider this: if you see his hands already softened, numb, and dead, and he cannot move, extend, or clench them, and when you constrict them with your fingers or prick them with a needle and he feels no pain in them, then know that he will not be healed, and in most cases it is mortal.
And if he moves them and feels constriction with the fingers and puncture, then know that the marrow of the bone is safe and that the patient will recover with treatment.
And if you see the same thing in the vertebrae of the neck and you want to know if it will heal or not, then observe his feet.
Then, if you see that they are already softened, the same thing has happened to them as happened to the hands, and when he lies on his back, he experiences flatulence and defecation without his will, and sometimes he lies on his back and wants to urinate but cannot, then know that it is mortal, and therefore do not work on his cure.
But if none of these things occur, the cause is better and milder.
And his cure is that you should apply to the inflamed area a hot poultice placed on the affected vertebra, with plain or rose-scented oil, or with well-beaten egg whites; apply this several times a day until the hot abscess is sedated.
And then apply one of the comforting and stimulating plasters, and bind it tightly; and command the patient to use rest and tranquility and not to sleep on the side where he feels pain until it is healed.
And if it happens that because of the attrition of the bone, splinters or something else has become separated from it, then it is necessary that you make an incision on the wound and remove that bone; and then join the two lips of the wound, with sutures if it is large; and then treat it with some incarnative ointment until it is healed.
But if the posterior part of the hip bone is broken, and it is the end of the femur, then you must insert the index finger of your left hand into the rectum, and realign the broken bone with the other hand as much as possible by counter-traction; and then apply a plaster and bandage, if you need them, and then bind it tightly.
And if you feel broken splinters in it, then you should make an incision there, and remove them, and treat the wound with the treatment previously described until it is healed.
Chapter 10.
Of the restoration of the hip.
The hip bones are rarely broken, and if they are broken, then their fracture is only a separation at the extremities of those bones, and they are split lengthwise and incline inwards; and the patient experiences pain and throbbing in the area, and the leg is numb when it is fractured.
And the restoration of it is that you extend your hand over it until it is over the fracture, which is the shape of it.
And if the fracture is only at its extremity, then you bind that according to what is at your disposal for equal binding, until it is similar to its natural shape.
But if the fracture is lengthwise or inclines downwards, then you make the patient lie on their stomach until the restoration of that fracture is prepared by you. And then when you have bound it, place a plaster over it, and then place a splint of wood or reed over that, and tighten it with a bandage over which you do not fear puncture of the fracture nor displacement of the splint.
And bind the concavity with something that fills it until it takes the bandage equally, and command the patient to sleep on their back or on their healthy side.
But if a hot abscess occurs, then you cease the extension of it and its restoration until the hot abscess is settled, and place on it that which settles it as is prescribed; and then return to its restoration, and bind it as is necessary.
And if splinters occur in the bone or are comminuted, then you remove them.
Chapter 11.
Concerning the restoration of a fracture of the humerus.
The humerus is that which is between the side and the head of the shoulder.
And if it is broken, then its restoration is in one of two ways, of which one is that you take a piece of wood of moderate thickness according to this form:
And let two bandages be tied at the two extremities, and then let it be suspended from a raised place.
And place the patient on a seat; and then place his broken arm on the wood until it reaches his wrist, in the middle of which the curve of the wood should be attached.
And then suspend some heavy object from it, or the assistant stretches it downwards; and then the physician joins the fracture with his hands until the fracture returns as it should.
And the other method is that the patient lies supine on his back and suspend the hand from his neck with a bandage; and then command two assistants that one of them hold what is above the fracture with his hands; and the other hold the part below; and each of them stretch it to his side.
And if you want the extension to be stronger, then you tighten it above the fracture with a bandage and above that with another bandage, and each of the two assistants extend to their respective sides.
And so if the fracture is close to the end of the muscle, then it is necessary that half of the bandage be placed on the wrist and the other below the fracture near the elbow.
And similarly, if the fracture is close to the elbow, then it is necessary that the bandage be placed on that place and on that elbow.
Swathe that with ease and without trouble, and then when it is swathed as necessary and is applied with good application, then tighten it unless a hot abscess occurs.
But if a hot abscess occurs, then leave the bandaging until the seventh day, and place on it clean wool soaked in sharp wine and rose oil until the abscess subsides, and then you tighten that.
And the manner of tightening it is that you place a plaster over the fracture, and then place a wrapping of new cloth over the plaster; and then adjust the arm over that support, and place your open hand over its muscle.
And place the cloth and tighten the arm over the support so that the arm is in a stellar position, unless some cause of the broken bone prohibits this.
And then use splints.
And it is so that you place over the fracture that splint which is wider and stronger than the other splints; and place between each splint the width of a finger, and let the length of the splints be according to the fracture with the addition of three fingers on each side.
And then tighten over the splints with the bandage which I mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.
And it is so that your bandage over the location of the fracture should be tighter. And the longer the fracture, the less tight the bandage should be.
And so if you see the placement of the splints and the bandage as we have said at the time when you restore the limb to its proper position, then you act.
And if you fear a purulent abscess, then you leave the bandage and splints in place until the seventh day, as we have said.
And then consider the bandage in all parts for three days so that itching or inflammation does not occur in the area; or it is forbidden for food to reach the limb due to the tightness of the bandage; and therefore rectify all this as we have said.
But if you are confident that none of these things will happen, then do not untie the bandage until three days or more.
And let the patient's sleep be on their side, and their hands should be on their stomach.
And place over the injured area a poultice full of well-carded wool, and check every hour of the night or day that the shape of the broken limb is not loosened or dissolved, or that the bandage is not softened; if so, rectify it all with your skill.
And give the patient food according to the order which we have previously mentioned, so that the food is light at the beginning until strength begins to return; and then it is fitting that you give him thicker food.
For it is customary for the injured area and his leg to be bound for 40 days; and then it is fitting that they be unbound and a bath be administered, and it should be medicated with ointments which rectify that.
And if the fracture is badly crushed, then you should not unbind the bandage and splints for 10 days or for two months.
Chapter 12.
Concerning the restoration of a fractured arm.
The arm is composed of two bones which are called two focils; of which one is small, and it is that which is next to the little finger, and the other is large and is that which is placed below the little finger, on the lower part.
And very easily the larger bone is broken alone, or the smaller one, and very easily they are broken together.
And when the small bone is broken above, then its restoration is easy, and its healing is easier.
And when the bone is broken below, the fracture is bad, and its healing is difficult.
And worse than that is when both bones are broken together.
Therefore, if the bone that is broken is the smaller bone above, then it is convenient for the physician, during its restoration, to apply slight extension with ease until it is aligned.
But if the large bone is what is broken, then it is necessary to apply a more forceful extension.
And if both bones are broken together, then you must apply the traction much more strongly.
And you must position your hand during its restoration and extension stretched out on a cushion, and the wrist of your hand should be higher than all the other fingers, and the thumb should be lower than the other fingers, and the patient should be lying on their back on a square cushion.
And there should be a cushion in front of him at his height or level, so that the patient does not suffer discomfort.
Then let the assistant extend the arm from the lower part with his hand or with a bandage, and another assistant extend it from above similarly.
Then the physician should manipulate the bone until he reduces it to the best possible position.
And if the bone fracture is jagged, then you must forcefully reduce all the pieces to their place with your skill.
And if a separated, jagged piece appears that protrudes, and there is no hope of restoring it, then you should saw it off and remove it according to the method we described above.
But if the fracture is accompanied by a wound, I have already devoted a separate chapter to this, and therefore take care of that.
And if an abscess occurs at the beginning of your reduction, then you should line a cloth with a cerate made of rose oil and white wax, and let it be of medium consistency between thick and thin, and bind the cloth over it with a subtle ligature until the abscess subsides; and then remove the cerate and apply a plaster prepared from powdered barley flour with egg white, and then apply stars; and let the star which is placed over the fracture be more spread out and stronger.
And know that the number of stars for the arm is six in the greatest arrangements, whether the fracture is in one bone or in two bones together.
And then apply your binding over the fracture site more firmly and more tightly, and if the binding is closer to the upper parts of the fracture or to the lower parts of it, apply the binding a little more loosely, as was mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.
And the cloths that are wrapped around the fracture should be soft and damp cloths, and not hard or rough, and the thread with which it is bound should be of a consistency midway between fine and coarse, as we have recommended.
And examine the limb and the bandage after a few days. And if any cause arises for which rectification is necessary, such as itching which occurs in the limb, then you must bathe the limb with warm water until that itching ceases.
And leave the limb unconstrained until it rests, and then reapply the bandage.
And if the fracture is now softened and the bone is reset and similar to the others, then correct all this with your skill.
And consider further if nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb by excessive tightness of the bandage, for then you must loosen it a little and leave it so for a few days until nourishment flows to it, and then tighten it again.
But if the patient does not experience any of the causes we have mentioned, then it is not necessary to loosen [the bandage] until approximately twenty days or thereabouts.
And then let the patient's hand be suspended by its own agitated movement, and make him sleep on his back.
And know that this fracture is restored in thirty days or in thirty-two days, or even quickly in twenty-eight days, and all this depends on the disposition of the complexions and the strength of the healing power.
Chapter 13.
Concerning the restoration of a fracture of the wrist and fingers.
Know that fractures rarely happen in the wrist and finger joints; instead, attrition [or wearing down] occurs very often.
And when a fracture or attrition occurs in the hand, then the patient should lie down, and a cushion should be placed in front of him according to his size, and then he should place his hand on that cushion.
Then the assistant extends the broken bones, and the physician joins them until they are united with a good connection.
Then it is necessary to apply a plaster and lint, unless a hot abscess occurs; and then apply a bandage over it according to the size of the area, and you have already wrapped it in linen cloth.
But if the fracture is in the inner parts of the palm of the hand, then make a kind of ball of cloth, and instruct the patient to hold it with his fractured palm; then it should be tightly bound with a long cloth.
And let the bandage be of leather with cloth in which it is softened, so that the leather may be applied to the palm; and tighten it as needed.
But if the fracture is on the outer parts, then it is necessary that you place a bandage above and another bandage below on the palm, so that the hand is open and straight; and then apply the splint, as if the hand were bent at the wrist between the fingers with ligaments.
And if a fracture occurs in any of the knuckles of the fingers, then if it is the thumb, it should be straightened as needed and then bound to the palm; and if you wish, apply a small, straight splint so that the fracture is elevated and not moved.
But if the fracture is in the other fingers, such as in the middle finger, or in the index finger, or in the ring finger, or in the little finger, then it should be straightened and bound to the finger next to it; or all should be bound together continuously, which is better; or place a small splint on it, as we have said for the thumb.
And consider, in your restoration, and in addition to that, the disposition of a hot abscess and oppose—with your operation—what is necessary when any of these conditions occur, according to the repeated description of it.
Chapter 14.
Of the restoration of a fracture of the thigh bone.
The thigh bone is often broken and this is revealed by the sensation, depending on whether it is broken in the front or the back part.
And its restoration is done in this way: a bandage is tightened above the fracture and another bandage below the fracture, and the patient is laid prostrate on his stomach and face.
And then the physician extends the entire bandage to its proper place according to the quality, when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.
But if it is close to the hip joint, then let the bandage be close to the knee on the side of the kneecap, so that the extension is upward, and the other bandage below the fracture.
And similarly, if the fracture is close to the knee, then let the bandage be placed near the knee, and let the extension be towards the lower parts.
And then the physician aligns the bone with both his hands until he reduces it to its natural form and the bone is joined by a good conjunction; then it is necessary to apply a plaster and a bandage, unless an abscess occurs in the limb. But if an abscess occurs there, then you leave it for a few days until the hot abscess subsides, and then return to your treatment.
The bandage should be made thus: you should wrap a firm bandage around the fracture, and double it two or three times, and remove the excess; and then wrap the leg until it reaches the ankle and the hip joint.
And insert a long strip of cloth between the thigh and the leg near the knee on the lower parts, and let the ends of the cloth come from the upper part of both sides, and then roll over the leg and thigh what is superfluous of the bandage.
And then place splints on the thigh at the site of the fracture, and place one splint on the bone of the leg.
And then fill the spaces between the leg and thigh with soft cloths, so that the bandage is firm.
And then begin with a tight bandage in the middle over the fracture site with three or four wraps, and the further you get from the fracture site, the looser, lighter, and softer your bandage should be.
And then extend the two ends of the cloth to the lower parts until it reaches the ankle, and tighten both ends of the splints on the other side so that the bandage is not displaced from its place.
And then leave the bandage on, provided that it does not cause the limb to become corroded, or develop a hot abscess or swelling, or anything similar; and if any of these things occur, then carefully loosen it, and correct whatever has occurred, just as we have said many times before.
But if there is a piece of bone in the bone which protrudes, then you must set it as best as possible; and if not, bind it and keep it in place, and treat it with the remedies previously mentioned until it is healed.
And sometimes this thigh fracture is tightened beyond what is achieved by the application of splints, as we have described for the treatment of the arm.
However, in the restoration of the limb made in this manner, the patient does not experience lameness; and if it is restored alone, without the application of support to the other leg, then it is necessary that he will always limp on that side.
And know that the thigh is bound for forty days, or a little more or a little less, and all this depends on the diversity of complexions and other conditions.
Chapter 15.
Of the restoration of a fracture of the kneecap.
Know that a fracture of the kneecap heals slowly, but often causes considerable attrition (or wearing away/damage).
But if a fracture occurs, then it is only a fissure or hole in its parts, and this is with or without a wound, and all of this is accompanied by pain.
And its restoration is such that what is broken of its parts is joined together with said splints until it is united and joined as much as possible by equalization, ease, and fabrication (or crafting).
Then apply a plaster and place a round splint over it, if you have one; and bind it above with a suitable bandage.
And then consider all the preparations that we have recommended in other fractures, such as a hot poultice and similar things, so that any accident is countered with what is suitable for it until it is healed.
Chapter 16.
On the restoration of a leg fracture.
Know that in the leg there are two bones, of which one is large and is called by the name of the leg; and the other is thin, and is called the fibula.
And whatever kinds of fractures happen to these two bones of the leg also happen to the two bones of the arm, and therefore its restoration is done in the same way as the restoration of the arm, and the operation is one and the same.
And if the two bones are broken together, the leg is distorted in all its parts.
And if the thinner bone is broken, the leg is distorted in the front parts.
And if the thicker bone is broken, you will find it below, and it is one of those things that are not easily seen by you.
Then administer extension, setting, and ligation of the splints according to that same method.
However, if the leg fracture is large, having many splinters, the extension should be less and gentler, and relieve it with your skill.
And in the leg, there is some cause for operating on the arm, and it is when you align the splints and have completed all your work, then you will take pieces of pine wood which are placed under the bandages that are placed on the soles, and they are carefully made from palm branches; choose those of small thickness and not the smallest, and let their length be according to the length of the leg from the knee to the foot.
Then wrap each cloth in two layers according to its length, and place one on one side of the leg and the other on the other side, from the knee to the lowest part of the foot.
Then tie the two splints in three places: at both ends and in the middle, for with this structure the leg is prevented from bending to the right or left, and it remains in a good position.
And a small wooden splint has already been prepared according to the length of the leg; and let the leg be placed on it so that it is kept from movement.
And it is especially necessary that you do this in a fracture, and when there is a wound properly so called.
And then examine the leg every day and study it carefully, and watch for abscesses and inflammation or other similar conditions; and if any of these occur, then treat it as necessary until it is healed.
Chapter 17.
Of the fracture of the talus and the bones of the foot and toes.
A fracture of the whole talus does not often occur; but fractures of the bones of the foot do occur sometimes; and fractures of the toes rarely occur, and only attrition in the case of a predisposition.
And if a fracture occurs in the bones of the foot and sometimes these bones are raised up above each other, then the patient should place his foot on the ground prepared as before.
Then place one foot on that which is elevated of those bones, and then press, and force those bones until they return to their places.
Then apply a plaster and lint over it, and place under the sole of the foot a small board to which two straps are attached.
Then tighten that with a descending bandage, after you have wrapped it with cloths and other necessary materials.
And when three or four days have passed, then untie the bandage, for you will find the bones set, whether they were broken or dislocated, and the operation on them is as you know.
But if some are said to be broken, then restore those, and set them as I have recounted to you in the restoration of the broken bones of the hand. Then apply a splint to the broken finger according to its length, and let it be a little longer; and place under the foot that board which I have mentioned to you, and tighten it with a proper bandage.
But if what is broken of the bones is two or three or more, then you place on each finger a splint of its size wrapped in linen cloth, and tighten the board at the bottom of the foot, and let it rest on one of the ends of the board across the instep so that it holds it with good retention.
And it is convenient for you that you not forget to consider all the things which I have told you in the other fractures of the accidents that we have mentioned; and oppose yourself to every accident with what is appropriate.
Chapter 18.
Of the fracture of the woman's hip and of the pubic bone and of the man's penis.
When the hip of the woman is broken, then make that part lie down flat, and gently incline it slightly towards the back, and let it be held from behind.
And then the midwife fills the hip with cotton, and it should be made into a ball in her hip; and then the woman should be held, and her back raised little by little, because all this is useless until the part of the hip is in front in the form of a sphere and the broken bone returns.
And then place powders on her back, and when she wants to urinate, remove the cotton easily and then she urinates, and reposition and return it according to the method by which you positioned it at the beginning, and then return to the first powder.
And do this for seven days or thereabouts, for then it is restored.
And if you wish, take a sheep's bladder and attach a small cane tube to its opening; and introduce the whole bladder into her hip, and then inflate it through the tube until the bladder is inflated inside the hip, for this will help the fracture to heal.
And then it should be filled with cotton and left for some days as we have recommended, until it is healed.
And when the bone of the pubis of a man or woman is broken, then administer for its restoration and healing what we have recommended for the hip bone.
And that which is right is not hidden in these nearby fractures which seldom occur, especially for one who studies and uses and understands this my book well; for this fracture signifies to you in the greatest dispositions the correct way in its restoration and its binding, and therefore understand well.
But in the case of a man's penis when it is broken, take a hen's gizzard and place the penis in it; and then place a cloth bandage over it, and let it be wrapped, and then let it be left for three days or thereabouts, and it will be healed.
Chapter 19.
Of the restoration of bone fractures when they are accompanied by a wound.
It is convenient for one who suffers a fracture with a wound, and especially if the bone is large, such as the thigh bone or the humerus, or similar to those, that you carefully attend to and bleed him immediately if the conditions for bloodletting testify to this as we have said above.
And if the wound flows with blood, then it is necessary that you attend to its retention so that you pulverize crushed sage over it, if no other cause is present.
And then begin to restore the fracture on that same day, and do not prolong it, unless an abscess occurs.
But if a hot abscess occurs, then you should leave its restoration until the ninth day, until the abscess has subsided, and do not approach it on the third and fourth days at all, for you will cause bad accidents.
But if the broken bone is prominent above the skin, uncovered, then it is necessary that you carefully reduce it and align it with your hands easily and with little extension.
But if extension is not prepared for you and the alignment of it with your hands, then you reduce it with your hands using this instrument; and this instrument is made of iron, its length is seven or eight fingers, and its width is according to the size of the wound; and for this, it is necessary for the physician to have three or four of them, according to the quantity needed for this in the treatment of every kind of fracture.
And let it be round, and let it be of little thickness so that it is not bent by the compression on it during the operation.
And let it have a sharp end which has a margin at its extremities; and let the top of it be of increasing thickness, and from its middle to the sides.
And this is its form:
And it is named in Greek "labre volentz atelarem," that is, a small spatula.
Therefore it is necessary that its sharp end be placed raised above the end of the prominent bone.
And push that in at once until the bone returns, and let it be equalized with some equalization/adjustment.
And then strive to equalize the ends of the fracture between them, and if the broken end of the bone is thin, and does not take the instrument well, then it is necessary that you incise the end of that bone until the instrument has power over it.
But if you cannot reduce the bone completely with what we have recounted, then incise it with whatever is suitable from the incisors which we have mentioned; or saw it with one of the saws in whichever way is possible for you.
And then scrape away what remains on the bone of roughness and small splinters.
And when the bone is reduced, and after the reduction the patient finds vehement and persistent pain, then know that the bone is not returned to its natural place; and then do what you consider will bring great benefit to the patient.
When your restoration of the bone is complete, then submerge a cloth in black styptic wine, especially if it is summer, and do not place on the wound cerate or anything else containing oil, lest it cause putrefaction and corruption there.
And then administer stitches at the time of your completion of the bone's restoration, and leave the wound uncovered so that you incise the opening with forceps and use dressings according to the size of the wound.
And guard yourself with all caution that you do not constrict the wound with the fracture, for many times foolish physicians have done this, and caused death or a corrosive or suppurating illness, that is, gangrene, in their patients. And if your constriction is light, soft, different from the constriction of other fractures.
And if the wound is large or a bad wound, and you fear some bad accidents which we have recounted, and you find pain in the place, then it is not fitting that you place stitches there, but apply a dressing of hard cloths instead of stitches and bind it tightly with these.
And when, after a day or two, the wound begins to suppurate, then you remove the cloth which you had placed upon it with wine, and then administer poultices, ointments with which it is our custom to treat wounds, such as tetrapharmacon ointment and similar ones.
And it is necessary for you to unbind the bandage and examine the wound each day, morning and evening, until it is consolidated and closed, and it is necessary that the limb be positioned in such a way that the pus flows downwards easily.
If many days pass and the wound is not consolidated nor is the pus discharged from it, then know that there is stagnation of humors, wherefore it is necessary to probe the wound with a probe. And of those collections of pus, those which are separated, remove and extract them; those which are not separated and compress the member and cause pain, it is necessary for you to incise them, as far as is possible for you.
And if a worm or maggot infests the wound — that is, a stiomenios, or another kind of corruption and putrefaction — then it is necessary that you treat each of these with what is appropriate for it, the treatment of which is described earlier in its chapter.
And this is what my discourse should address, and you should keep in mind: when a large bone is fractured, apply a dressing to the limb, just as to a fractured thigh bone or similar large bones, and do not attempt traction or extraction, for in many instances death results from this; leave it until it suppurates, for it will fall off naturally in about 20 or 30 days; and then treat the wound if you deem it necessary, but if not, leave it be.
Chapter 20.
Chapter 20: On the treatment of a swelling that occurs at the site of a fracture.
Often this swelling occurs at the site of a healing fracture, especially near the joints, and it distorts the shape of the limb; and it quickly prevents the limb from its natural function.
Then consider if the swelling is recent and apply medicines that have astringent properties, such as aloe, incense, myrrh, cerussa (white lead), and similar substances;  take some or all of these, and mix them with astringent wine, or egg white, or sour wine, and apply this to the swelling on a piece of linen, and bind it firmly.
And leave the bandage tight for many days; then unbind it and apply another, until the swelling is reduced; or apply a thin lead plate, because lead has the property of reducing anything swollen in the limbs.
But if the swelling has already become hardened and constricted and necessity compels its removal carefully, then incise it in its highest part, and excise the excess and prominent part, or scrape it with a sharp instrument until it is reduced; and treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 21.
Chapter 21. Of the restoration of a fracture when it is set, and the limb remains thin and weak, not according to its natural state.
When a bone fracture is set, and afterward the limb remains thin and weak, this happens for many reasons: one of which is the excessive loosening of the ligaments and their binding not as it should be; or by excessive tightening of the bandages so that nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb; or by an excessive amount of superfluous embrocation; or by excessive movement not at the proper time; or by a lack of blood in the patient's body and by their weakness.
And the cure for this is to give the patient nourishing food and to make his heart cheerful so that his blood is increased; and administer baths; and instill joy and mirth in him.
And then apply a poultice to the limb, so that the poultice draws much nourishment to it, or continuous embrocation with warm water, until nourishment flows and it returns to its natural form.
Chapter 22.
Chapter 22. Of the treatment of fractured bones when they are set crookedly and the proper operation is prevented.
When, in a limb already set, there is a recurrence of crookedness and swelling at the fractured bone and a knot, and because of this there is deformity of the limb, but nevertheless the limb is not prevented from its natural function, then you should not heed the words of anyone who claims that limb is newly fractured.
But there have been many foolish physicians and bone-setters who have done this in our land; and this operation is very reprehensible, leading to great fear, the sign of which is death.
But if the lameness and swelling are recent, then they should be bathed with warm water in which are boiled softening herbs, such as mallow leaves and roots, melilot, and similar things; and an emollient plaster should be applied, such as well-made diachylon; or a mucilage of mallow root should be made and mixed with white clay or with olive oil, and applied as a plaster; or fatty figs should be crushed with pigeon droppings, and similar things from among the medicines called consolidating unguents.
And sometimes it is resolved with frequent, light friction with moistened hands, and movement of the limb in every part should be administered at all times.
But if the crookedness has progressed and become severe and hardened, and it becomes necessary to treat it with iron, then the uppermost part should be sawn off and the continuity of the bone dissolved, and that which superfluously swells from the knotting of the bone itself should be incised with fine scalpels, and relief should be provided with care and diligence.
Chapter 23.
Concerning discourse on dislocation.
Dislocation is the displacement of any of the joints from their place, whereby movement is prevented, and the shape of the limb is distorted, causing great pain and injury to the patient.
Therefore, when a dislocation happens to someone, then it is necessary to immediately strive that it be reduced, and not delay this reduction, for if it is delayed, the place becomes inflamed and very quickly it becomes difficult to reduce the dislocation.
And for this reason, it should not be moved or stretched at the time of inflammation, because many times it causes spasms and intense pain.
But when this happens, then you should attend to the phlebotomy of the patient, and then let him rest until the inflammation subsides; and then the limb should be bathed with warm water and oil, and then it should be reduced with ease.
And every limb should be treated in such a way that its healing will bring it back to its proper place.
And I have now ordered the chapters on dislocation according to what preceded on fracture; from the uppermost part of the body down to the lowermost part.
Chapter 24.
On the treatment of dislocation of the lower jaw.
If the two jaws are dislocated, it will not be long; and the dislocation of both is done in one of two ways: either they are moved from their places by slight displacement, and are somewhat softened; or they are dislocated by complete and total dislocation, until they are softened at the joint, to the point that saliva flows from the patient and they cannot retain it nor close their mouth, and their tongue is entangled in their speech.
But when the dislocation is slight, then in most cases it returns by itself with little intervention.
But if the dislocation is complete and total, then a reduction must be administered promptly, and not delayed at all.
And let the assistant hold the patient's head, and let the physician insert the thumb of one hand into the root of the dislocated jaw inside the patient's mouth, if the dislocation is on one side; or let him insert both thumbs together, if the dislocation is on both sides, and let the other fingers of his hands be outside with which he will pull; and he commands the patient to relax their jaws and allow them to be moved from each side; and the physician pulls the jaw and pushes the jaw until it returns to its place.
And if the reduction is difficult, and especially if both jaws are dislocated together, then administer a vaporization with warm water and oil, until the reduction of both is made easier and do not delay the reduction of both at all, as we have said.
And then, when they return and are aligned, and the patient's mouth is closed and not softened, then place on it some linen cloths with cerate, and it should be made of wax and rose oil; and then it should be bound easily with soft bandages.
And let the patient sleep on their back, and their head should be supported between two pillows, so that it does not lean to the right or left; and do not force them to chew anything; beforehand, their food should be finely chopped, until, when the pains are lessened and the jaws are healed, then let them eat what they wish.
And this should be administered with care, and do not exert effort on opening the mouth during eating and drinking and speaking, until the jaw is healed and mended.
And if the reduction of the two jaws is difficult when they are dislocated at any time and are not returned to their places, then many times fevers and persistent thirst occur, and very quickly the patient's belly is bloated, and very quickly they vomit pure bile.
And when you see this, then know that it is dangerous; and many times he who experiences this dies within ten days.
Chapter 25.
Of the reduction of the dislocation of the clavicle and of the extremity of the muscle.
The clavicle is not dislocated inward from its articulation with the sternum; and sometimes it is dislocated outwards, and this is evident to the touch.
And its restoration is that the patient lies on his back and extends his arms. And then constrict the area with your palm with firm pressure, for it will return.
And then apply a plaster and powders to that area and bind it tightly.
But the extremity of that which is next to the hip and is continuous with it, is not dislocated in any way; then it must be reduced and bandaged as we have said and as is appropriate for you.
And then apply a plaster, and powders, and a bandage, and instruct the patient to adhere to tranquility and rest until healed.
And with this same treatment, the extremity of the muscle is reduced when it is separated from its place.
Chapter 26.
On the reduction of the dislocation of the muscle.
Know that a muscle is dislocated in only three ways, one of which is that it is dislocated from the upper part to the lower part.
And the second is that it is dislocated from the upper part of the muscle, and this is done slowly; and it is not dislocated in the back parts by the shoulder; and it is not dislocated in the front parts by the nerves.
And it is mostly dislocated and protrudes outwards in the lower parts below the armpit, and especially in those who have little flesh, it is easily dislocated; but in those who have much flesh, it comes out with difficulty.
And it quickly happens to some men through a blow or fall, and their muscle is inflamed by a hot abscess, and it is thought to be dislocated because of this.
Then it is necessary that you explore this until you are certain about it, and then you proceed to its cure.
And the dislocation is known when it is in the lower parts below the armpit; so that you distinguish between the dislocated muscle and the healthy muscle, because you find a manifest difference between them; and you find a concavity at the head of the muscle and below the armpit near the touch of the head of the muscle, like an egg, and the patient cannot bring his hand to his ear, nor move it in all movements.
If it is dislocated near the feet or above, then you find a manifest touch, and it is not hidden.
And reduction of this dislocation is easily done when it is fresh and the patient is a child.
And the reduction of it is that the minister raises his hand to the upper parts; and then places his hands under his armpit, and raises the joint strongly to its place, and the minister raises his hand, and extends it upwards; and then places it below because it returns lightly.
But if by what we have said it does not return, and from the beginning that the dislocation happened, many days have passed, then it is necessary that the patient be bathed in warm water and a softening and relaxing embrocation be administered, such as boiled roots of marshmallow, fenugreek, and melilot in water, and be applied.
And then the patient should be supine on his back and a wool ball, of a consistency between soft and firm, placed under his armpit. Then the physician places his heel on the ball and elevates the head of the muscle forcefully, and pulls the patient's arm so that it is not pulled downwards. Another assistant holds the patient's head to prevent it from being pulled downwards, for then it quickly returns to its place.
And if you wish, reduce it according to this method:  have a man present who is taller than the patient, standing on that side, and insert his shoulder under the patient's armpit and raise the patient's armpit upwards until the patient is suspended in the air. Another assistant pulls the patient's arm from below his belly. But if the patient is light, then it is necessary that something else be suspended with him to weigh him down, because the dislocation returns immediately.
And it is reduced easily in another way: a long, round-topped pole, like a mortar pestle, neither thick nor thin, is fixed in the ground. Then, soft cloths are placed on top of the pole, and the patient stands along the length of the pole. Then his arm is extended downwards on the opposite side; and his body is forcefully extended on the other side, for the joint returns to its place quickly.
And if reduction is difficult by all the methods we have mentioned, then use this treatment: take a stick two cubits long and four fingers wide,  and its thickness should be reduced at the end that goes under the armpit in this way:
And then soft cloths should be tied over the rounded end so that the stick does not injure the patient.
Then it should be placed under the armpit of the patient, and the arm or hand should be extended over the stick down to the lower parts, and the stick should be tied to the armpit, arm, and hand.
Then the arm should be placed on a step of a ladder according to its width, and the hand should be extended downwards, and the rest of the body should be suspended on the other side, for the joint will enter immediately.
And when the reduction is complete in whatever way possible to you, then you should place under the armpit a ball of wool of sufficient size; and then apply a plaster prepared from powdered elm leaves and egg white over the entire muscle, so that it is wrapped around it, and then tighten it under the armpit with a suitable bandage; and the bandage should be wrapped over the plaster, and the patient's hand should be attached to their neck, and it should be left, and the patient's hand should not be moved for seven days.
And the patient's diet should be light until the limb is strengthened, for this makes healing easier.
Then the diet should be increased gradually after seven or five days and some movement should be exercised; and so if it is firm and not softened, then it is healed.
But if the joint is dislocated many times due to humidity affecting it or some other cause, then cautery with three punctures should be administered in that place, as previously described in the chapter on cautery.
And if all this is done and after seven days the bandage is untied and the joint is not firm, and the plaster and the bandage are reapplied several times, and it is not firm and hangs and cannot raise that arm to the upper parts, then know that the nerves of it, which are at the head of the muscle, are severed or stretched or softened, and know that the joint will never be fixed in its place.
For the dislocation that occurs between the foot and the ankle or the parts behind, reduction is done with impulse and extension with the hands, until it returns [to its place].
And let another bandage be applied to that [area], and treat it until it is healed.
And if during healing heaviness occurs in the limb and slowness in its movement, then the patient should use baths many times until that heaviness is relieved and it returns to its former natural state.
Chapter 27.
On the treatment of elbow dislocation.
Know that the elbow joint is dislocated with difficulty and similarly returns with difficulty; and it is dislocated in all directions, and especially from the front to the back, and its dislocation is not hidden from you because it is evident to the sight or to the touch, according to whatever form it is dislocated, and when you align the dislocated elbow with its socket, this is manifestly declared to you, because the joint is concave and cannot bend the arm, nor can it touch its muscle with it.
And it is necessary that you take care, and reduce the dislocation immediately before a hot abscess develops, for if a hot abscess develops, its reduction is difficult, and it is not easily healed at all; and especially when it is in the back parts, for it is the worst of all other kinds of dislocations, and of greater pain, and often causes death with it.
And its restoration, when it is possible to reduce it, is that his hand be extended with two hands, and his arm be expanded, and the physician's hands be on the elbow and below it, and he pushes the joint with the thumbs of his hands together, or with the root of his palm until it returns to its place.
But if the dislocation is in the front parts, then return it in such a way that you bend the hand with your hand, until you strike the elbow with the root of your palm.
And if the dislocation does not yield to reduction, then administer vigorous and very strong extension.
And it is necessary that two assistants extend the arm, and that two other assistants hold it firmly so that it is not moved during the extension.
And then the arm should be rotated in every direction, after it has been wrapped with a long, folded cloth over his hand, or a bandage.
And when the physician touches the joint with his hand, anoint it with some oil so that this will aid in lubricating the joint with ease; and then push the joint with forceful pressure until it returns to its place.
And after the reduction, it is necessary that he be placed on a plaster which has styptic and drying properties with egg white, and it should be tightly bandaged with a descending compression bandage, and the arm should be suspended from the neck, and left like that for some days.
And afterwards it should be unbound; and then if the joint is set in its place, then you untie his bandage and leave it thus.
And if you see the joint is not well tightened, then you renew the plaster and bandage, and leave it like that for some days until it is tightened; and then unbind it.
But if the patient experiences pain after the reduction of the joint, and his condition is aggravated by movement, then administer moist applications in a bath and gentle friction, and compression, until he is relieved; or place on the joint soothing herbs, that is, something very oily; and then it should be bandaged, and left on the bone day and night. And then remove that, and put him in a bath; and when he is sufficiently warm, then you rub the joint with a temperate friction, and then again apply soothing herbs, that is, very oily rosemary, once, and a second time, and a third time. with the application of a bath, until it is softened.
And if you wish, place on it a warm, moist cow's bladder and bind it tightly; and do this several times, for it is moist and helps restore it to its proper condition.
Chapter 28.
Concerning the treatment of a dislocated wrist, that is, of the joint that is between the arm and the hand.
A dislocated wrist is sometimes easily reduced, unlike other joints. However, speed is necessary in its reduction at the time it is dislocated, before the place becomes inflamed or a hot abscess develops there.
And the reduction of its dislocation is that you place the patient's wrist joint on a table, and the assistant extends the patient's hand, and the physician places his hand or palm on the prominence of the joint, and pulls it until it returns to its place.
However, it must be considered whether the palm is already turned towards the belly of the hand. Then the patient places the back of his hand on a table during extension and reduction; and if the dislocation is towards the back of the hand, then let the position of his hand be inwards on the table, so that the physician's hand falls on that prominence of the joint.
And so if it returns immediately, it is good; and if not, then bind it with a poultice that softens the inflammation and leave it; and do not repeat this, for otherwise you will not be able to succeed in its reduction once days have passed.
However, if the joint remains in its twisted position, and the patient feels no pain, only that the hand is weakened and cannot grasp anything, then you should know that the nerves are pinched or crushed, and then there is no remedy except to bind it with a cautery near the injury, and quickly give it something to hold.
Therefore, when the limb is reduced, then apply the poultice we have described, and let it be left and bound for five days; then let it be unbound and left, and let his hand be exercised.
But if its movement is impeded and some heaviness occurs in it, then soothe it with warm water and friction several times, until it is relieved.
Chapter 29.
On the treatment of finger dislocations.
Sometimes fingers are dislocated in every part.
And when one of those fingers is dislocated towards the back of the palm or the belly of the hand, then extend the finger and push the dislocation back with your own hands, until it returns.
And then support the head of the finger, and suspend it towards the part to which it is dislocated, and leave it like that for two days.
And then suspend it and extend it until it is straight and set in its place that day.
And when it is night, bind it according to that description, and do not cease to unbind it during the day and exercise it with movement, and bind it at night; and do this for some days until it is tight/firm.
And do similarly if it is dislocated on the palm of the hand, and bind it to that part and perform this first operation until it is healed.
And similarly do this when it is dislocated in other parts.
Chapter 30.
On the treatment of the dislocation of the vertebrae of the back.
When a complete dislocation happens to any of the vertebrae of the back or neck, and many vertebrae are dislodged from their places, then in that case there is no cure, for death threatens the patient.
And a sign of this is that the patient's excretion is expelled involuntarily, and they cannot retain it; and often some of their limbs are paralyzed, or their two legs, or their two arms, or one of these; or a vertebra is dislocated, because often it is dislocated and often the displacement is in four parts.
Therefore, that is already dislocated to the back parts and is called yellowness (jaundice/possibly referring to a discoloration or symptom).
But the cure for it is that then you consider if the yellowness (jaundice/discoloration) comes from a fever, for then in that case there is no cure nor healing at all.
But in that which comes from a fall or from a blow or similar to those, the Ancients already described the methods of cure with long discourse, of which the most returns with profit; but I have already abbreviated that, of which the little excuses the excess of it, for my proximity to my intention of explanation, with which I have expounded and formed this from various instruments of that with which I will show this and expound that.
And of those, only that which happens in the two properly is cured with what I have recounted.
And it is that the patient should be extended on his face on a fairly level bed near a wall, and a soft mat should be placed under him so that his feet are not hurt.
And then a straight pole should be placed, fixed in the earth at the head of the bed near his head, and another pole near his feet at the other end of the bed.
And the attendant should hold the pole, and it should not be fixed in a hole; and another attendant should hold the other according to that method.
Then wrap a cloth around the patient's head and tie it firmly with strong linen; and extend the end of the linen to the pole which is near his head, and tie it to him; and then tighten another linen around his hips and thighs, and around his legs; and then adjust all the linen and tie them to the other pole which is near his feet.
And then each attendant should extend the linen to the part of the pole, and the two poles and the linen should not be removed from their places where they are fixed, but however, they are not fixed as we have said.
And the physician should place his palms on the spine with firmness until it returns, or place a board on it, and then adjust his feet on the board until it returns.
But if it does not return by this method, then take a board whose width or length is about three braccia, and make a hole in the wall which we have said is near the patient, into which the end of the board fits. Then place half of the board on the spine, and the physician place his feet on the other end, and press firmly until the spine is reduced and returns to its place.
And if you wish, use a lathe which is turned by hand; and you should place in the ground near the patient's head at the back of the buttocks two poles, the length of each being one braccia, and near their head at the back of the buttocks, similarly two poles; and the distance between each pole should be one palm, and in each pole there is a hole through which the lathe passes, and each should be firmly fixed in the ground so that it is not moved.
And let there be a round pole on which the lathe is placed, and let it be revolved in the two holes of the two poles.
And at its end is a hole into which the pole is fitted, the length of which is one palm including that which revolves; and in the other two poles is something similar to that.
Then tighten the ligatures that you have tied to the patient's feet in the hole which is near their head, and the ligatures that you have tied to their thighs in the lathe which is near their feet.
And then near each lathe let a servant stand who turns the lathe with his hand, and the physician adjusts the vertebra as we have said.
And then, once the vertebra is returned and the place is adjusted, then you should apply a drying plaster with egg white, and then lint; and then place over the plaster a tablet of wood whose width should be three fingers or thereabouts, and whose length should be enough to cover the area of the hump, and the healthy part of the spine.
And then it should be bound with the ligature which we have mentioned, and nourish the patient with light food until he is healed.
And if any swelling remains in the area at the end of the healing, then medicines should be administered that soften and smooth, with the administration of the tablet for a long time, which we have recommended; and a lead plate is then applied to that area.
And sometimes swelling occurs in the rear of the spinal vertebrae, and is caused by that dislocation; and it is that bone which already swells, so that no attempt should be made to treat it with this medicine, because it will very quickly cause death.
Chapter 31.
On the treatment of a dislocated hip.
Know that the hip joint and the muscle joint suffer only dislocation, and not what happens to other joints of small movement and concavity.
And the hip joint is dislocated in four ways, for it is dislocated inwards, or outwards, or forwards, or backwards.
And it is mostly dislocated inwards, and rarely forwards or backwards.
And a sign of its dislocation inwards is that, when you align the patient's healthy leg with the affected one, the affected leg is longer and the knee more prominent than the healthy one, and the patient cannot bend their foot without pain.  And it is the place where the pain is inflamed with a hot abscess, because the head of the femur has already arrived there.
And the sign of that to which dislocation happens outwards, is that its symptoms are contrary to these symptoms.
And the sign of that to which dislocation happens forwards is that he extends his leg completely, but nevertheless cannot bend it without pain in the knee, and if he forces himself to walk he cannot do so forwards; and his urine is retained and his groin is inflamed, and he walks on his heel.
And a sign of dislocation happening backwards is that he cannot extend the knee, nor can he bend it before bending the hip, and his leg is shorter than the other, and the groin is softened, and the head of the femur is behind that place.
But the reduction of these types of dislocation is that you consider, then, if the dislocation is old and longstanding,  if it has been in that position for a long time and you administer reduction to it, and it remains according to its disposition, then it is not entirely cured; and then it is not necessary to make a prognosis in this case.
But in the case where the dislocation is recent, and is one of the four types of dislocation, then see to it that you return the joint and extend it inwards and outwards, and move it to the right and left, for it quickly returns and does not need other treatment.
But, if it does not return in this manner, then it is necessary that you prepare a strong assistant and extend the patient's leg from the lower part, either with his hands, or with a bandage which is tied above the knee; and another assistant extends the hand of that one from above in such a way that he puts his hands below the patient's testicles; and then tighten a strong bandage around the root of the thigh, and let another assistant hold the end of the bandage.
And let the extension be from him or from the inside part at the groin to the part of the fork (presumably the pubic area), or from the back part to the part of the back.
And let the extension of all these be at once until the patient is lifted with his body from the ground and remains suspended.
And this type of extension is common to all four (types of dislocation).
And therefore, if the dislocation returns with what we have said, it will be good; and if not, then it is necessary for every type that which we will say of its proper cure.
In the reduction of the hip itself, when it is dislocated, and the dislocation is towards the inner parts, it is necessary that the patient be supine on his sound side; and then place the ligatures on the root of the thigh in that place which is between the head of the thigh and the place that is below the groin; and then extend the ligature upwards from the part of the groin to the highest part of the fork (pubic area).
And then another strong minister grasp his arms, and raise the thick part of the affected thigh and extend it outwards with a forceful extension, for thus it will return to its place.
And this type is of easier cure, with which this member is reduced, than the other types.
But if it is excused on your account and does not yield to treatment with this type of cure at all, then it is necessary that the two feet of the patient be tied together with a strong, light ligature, above both ankles and both heels.
And let the length of each be about four fingers, and let the injured leg be extended more than the other by the amount of two fingers.
And then the patient should be suspended from the head of the beam, and let him be in the house; and let his height from the ground be about two arms' lengths.
And then order a strong young man to lower the head of the thigh, and let another young man be suspended with the patient, and let the other young man, pulling strongly, lower the thigh, for the joint returns to its place quickly.
But in the actual reduction, when it is a dislocation to the outside, the patient should lie on his back as we have recommended in the case of coldness; and let the bandage be tightly applied to the affected leg and to his feet.
And then two beams should be placed, one at his feet and the other at his head; and then let adjusted beams be placed in the middle of the mound placed on top of which wet cloths are wrapped, so that the patient is not harmed because the beam is between his thighs, so that during the extension the lower parts are not pulled.
And then each assistant extends on his side, and the physician with his hand guides the reduction according to the art.
And when the dislocation is in the front parts, then it is necessary that the leg be extended slightly, and it is according to this same narrative on a mound; and the physician places the palm of his right hand on the patient's hip joint, and then grasps it with the other hand, and with that grasp he pulls it downwards towards the knee joint.
And if the dislocation is in the back parts, then it is not necessary that the patient be extended downwards, and he is raised above the earth; rather it is necessary that he be placed on a hard surface, just as it is necessary for the elevation if his hip is dislocated outwards, according to what we have said about his lying on two cushions; and is on his face and the ligaments are extended, as we have said, there is little more [to do].
And it is necessary that compression be applied with a board to the place where the joint is.
Therefore, when the reduction is completed as necessary — and the sign of its reduction is not hidden from you, which is that you extend the patient's two legs, and when you see them equal and the patient bends his leg and extends it without difficulty, then you know that the limb is returned as necessary — and then you adjust the two thighs and apply a plaster and bind it tightly so that the hip is not moved in any direction; and the patient should rest for three or four days.
And then untie the bandage and the plaster, and compare one leg with the other.
Then, if you see them equal in appearance, then you know that the dislocation is now healed, and then let the patient go.
And if you see any cause for softening, then you return and plaster that, and bind it according to your first constriction, and leave it for three days.
And then untie it, and have him delay walking for some days, until he is strengthened.
Chapter 32.
On the treatment of knee dislocation.
The knee is dislocated in three ways, for it is dislocated outwards, and inwards, and downwards, more towards the back; and it is not dislocated forwards.
And the sign of its dislocation is that you command the patient to bring his leg to his thigh; then you will know that the knee is dislocated.
And the restoration of all its dislocations is that you make the patient lie down straight, so that he extends his leg if he can; then apply your two hands to his face, and place his foot between your feet; and then apply his knee to your palms, and hold those between your fingers on his knee firmly, and have another assistant extend his foot until the knee returns to its place.
And the sign of its reduction is that his leg adheres to the thigh with light, effortless movement.
And then plaster that and bind the leg to the thigh, and then bind them together with a bandage for three or four days, and then unbind them.
And do not allow the patient to walk for some days, until he is healed and strengthened.
But if its reduction is difficult for you, then administer strong extension with bandages, of which the method in the treatment of the hip was previously described.
Chapter 33.
On the treatment of the dislocation of the talus (ankle bone).
The talus is sometimes dislocated by a small movement, and sometimes completely dislocated, and its dislocation is either inwards or outwards.
And the sign of its dislocation is that sometimes the talus swells, protruding towards the side to which it is dislocated.
But the treatment of its displacement is gentle reduction; it is to be extended easily with hands and bandaged until it returns [to its place].
But in treating it when it is completely dislocated, you must make the patient lie down straight, and have a strong and capable assistant hold him from behind at the middle of his back.
Then you, with your right hand, take the foot from the upper part, and with your left hand the lower part of the foot at the ankle.
Then pull the foot towards you with your right hand, and then with your left hand twice, and then extend with the left; and push the foot with the right hand towards the leg without effort.
And do this twice as we have described.
Then push the foot to the leg a third time, and you are at the ankle.
Then it will return in one or two times according to this manner, and if you see the foot straightened, it is good; and if not, then repeat the operation, because it will return.
But if the reduction is prohibited for you by what we have recounted, then make the patient lie on his back on the ground, and tighten a tightly bound small pillow on the ground, which fits between his thighs, and you have already wrapped a cloth around him so that the patient is not injured.
And then let his attendant hold his thighs, and then another attendant extend the foot with his hands or with a bandage tied above the ankle; and then let each attendant extend against the extension of his counterpart, and the pillow remains between the patient's thighs, holding it, so that his body is not pulled downwards against his extension.
And then the doctor straightens the dislocation with his hands, and another attendant holds the healthy thigh downwards, because the dislocation easily returns.
And so when the dislocation returns and the success of its reduction is clear to you, then apply a plaster and bind it tightly with bandages, and bind the foot to the leg with a bandage.
And it is necessary that you fear or guard against the nerves which are behind the heel, so that the bandage over it is not too tight and severely injures them.
And then leave it for two or three days; and if the bandage is loosened, tighten it.
And then unbind it on the third or fourth day, and forbid the patient from walking for forty days. But if he is forced to walk before that time, there is no certainty that the dislocation will not be loosened and worsened, and then it will not receive a cure.
And if a hot abscess occurs, then you must administer to him what we described earlier, in another place concerning treatment and application, until it is healed.
Chapter 34.
Concerning the treatment of dislocations of the toes.
It is necessary that what is dislocated be healed with little extension without effort; and this is not difficult, rather it is easy.
But if the dislocation is in one of the bones of the foot, then you must make the patient place his foot on level ground or on a table, and remain there as if he were walking.
And then you stand, and place your foot on what protrudes from the joints, and then press that with your foot firmly until it returns, and you see that it is healed and no prominence appears in that place.
And then place under the sole of his foot a board that covers the whole foot, to which are attached two supports, and then tighten that with a suitable and firm bandage for three days; and then untie it and make him rest from walking for many days, until it is strengthened and its recovery is assured.
Chapter 35.
Of the types of dislocation that are made with a wound or with a fracture or with both together.
When any of these things happen, and you busy yourself in its cure and in his restoration, many times death ensues.
And therefore it is not fitting that anyone presume upon his cure except one who is wise in the art, of long experience, merciful and compassionate, slow, not rash nor presumptuous; and that he use in the beginning only those medicines that soothe hot abscesses, and leave the patient to divine judgment, except in that case where you hope for salvation from danger, with alleviation of the sickness, and in which some hope appears. And then exert yourself immediately to reduce it at the beginning of the cause, before a hot abscess develops.
And then if the limb returns as we wish, then administer a regime which soothes hot abscesses and treat the wound with what is suitable for it of drying ointments.
And if the dislocation is with a fracture and the jagged ends of the bone are separated, then you must force their alignment, and do in this case what we have said in the simple diseases of what precedes in those places.
And guard and avoid, according to your virtue, that entry into paths of fear as my preaching has preceded you; for this is better for you before your Creator, and more permanent for your glory, and more healthful for your true body in your time. Thus end the words of Albucasis perfectly, for which may God be blessed. Amen.
