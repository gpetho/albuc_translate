Viscous humors may settle in the hip joint, causing it to be displaced. A sign of this is that one leg will be longer than the other when they are measured against each other, and you will find a gap at the site of the dislocation.  The patient should be cauterized right on the hip itself, with a semi-circular cautery.	Sometimes harmful humidities reach the hip joint and result in its coming out of its place. The symptom of this is that one leg is longer than the other when one is measured against the other; and a hollow is found there [i.e. at the hip].	0.7064671
After marking with ink around the joint as it rotates, so that the joint itself falls in the center of the circle. And the cautery iron should be the one whose form was presented in the cauterization of the stomach. If this cautery iron is not available, then cauterize with three burns using the large olive-shaped cautery iron.	Then you should cauterize the patient over the hip joint itself with a circular burn, after you have marked with ink a circle round the femoral joint, so that the joint falls in the middle of the circle. The cautery should be the one whose description has already been given in cauterization of the stomach. But if you have not this cautery by you, give him three cauterizations with the larger size olivary cautery.	0.78458506
Make the cauterization as deep as the entire thickness of the skin. Then treat him until he recovers, God willing.	The burn should be to the depth of the whole thickness of the skin. Then dress till healed.	0.73774374
