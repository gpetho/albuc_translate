On the Adhesion of the Eyelid to the Conjunctiva or to the Cornea.
This adhesion may occur in many people, where the upper eyelid adheres to the white of the eye, preventing its easy movement and hindering its natural functions.  Therefore, you should insert the end of a probe under the eyelid.
And lift it upwards or extend it with a hook, then cut the adhesion with a delicate scalpel, not as sharp as cutting scalpels, but somewhat blunt, so that the patient does not become agitated during the procedure and cause the scalpel to slip and injure the eye with its sharpness.  And your cutting should be as if you are peeling that adhesion.
And wait until the eyelid returns to its natural state and the entire adhesion heals. Then pour salt water into the eye to wash it, or drop in dissolved copper sulfate eye drops. Then separate the eyelid and the eye with a linen wick.
And place cotton wool moistened with egg white over the eye. After the third day, use soothing eye drops until it heals.
