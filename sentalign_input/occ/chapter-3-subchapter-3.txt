Chapter 3:
On the Restoration of the Nose when it is Broken.
Know that the nose is not broken except in the two uppermost parts, or sometimes one of them, because it has two bones, while the lower part is cartilaginous and does not break but may suffer abrasion, twisting, and curvature.
But if one of the two parts is broken, you must insert your little finger into their nose and align the fracture from inside with your index finger and from outside with your thumb until the nose returns to its natural shape.
Do this gently and ensure that your operation does not cause the patient pain.
If the fracture is in the uppermost part of the nose and your finger cannot reach it, you must align it with the tip of a small rod.
If the fracture is in two parts, you must do the same for both.
Try to restore it on the first day of the fracture if possible; if not, then within seven or ten days after ensuring no pus forms.
Insert a piece of linen cloth into the end of the nose if the fracture is in one part, or two tampons if the fracture is in two parts, and make the tampon thick enough to fill the nasal cavity.
Some ancient restorers say that the tampons should be soaked in vinegar and changed daily, but I have not seen this; rather, the cloth should be soaked in egg white mixed with flour, and left in place until the bone is set and the cartilage hardens.
Sometimes, instead of a tampon, insert goose feather wrapped in linen, especially for more severe nose fractures, ensuring it does not obstruct the patient's breathing.
This is not necessary; if you prefer, use this method, or use tampons.
If an abscess forms, plaster the nose with cerate or cotton soaked in vinegar and rose oil, or with diachylon.
If no abscess forms, apply a plaster externally with sesame flour and incense powder mixed with egg white; then place cotton over it, but do not bind the nose for any reason.
But if the nose bones are broken with a small fracture or are shattered, you must incise over them, extract them with appropriate instruments; then suture the incision, and treat it with substances that heal and solidify, and with suitable plasters.
If a wound forms inside the nose, treat it with tampons and insert lead canulas until it is completely healed.
