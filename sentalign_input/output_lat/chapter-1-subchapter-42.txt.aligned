When the patient has been purged with foetid pills or the like, he should be cauterized in his back where the pain is, over the breadth of the flat of the back, after the place has been marked with ink, with three rows of cauterizations, five in each, or more, in proportion to what you see of the patient's endurance and strength. Use the punctate cautery.	Therefore, after evacuating the patient with stinking pills, and similar treatments, three lines should be made on the back, where the pain is, according to the width of the affected area itself, marking five cauterizations on each line with ink, or more according to the patientâ€™s ability to endure it: and the cauterization is to be performed with a pointed cautery.	0.7733099
