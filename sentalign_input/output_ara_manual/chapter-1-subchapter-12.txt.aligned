On cauterizing watery eyes.	On cautery in cataract of the eye.	0.6752256
If you ascertain the beginning of watery eyes by the signs mentioned in the classification, then hasten to have the patient drink what cleanses his head and protects him from all moistures, and have him sweat in the bath while fasting for several days.	When by those signs I have mentioned in the relevant section there is brought to your notice the beginning of a cataract of the eye, start with draughts for the patient such as shall cleanse his head; and guard him from all humidities. Make him also sweat for some days, fasting, in the bath.	0.80097675
Then have him shave his head and cauterize it in the middle of the head, then cauterize him twice on the temples if the beginning of the watering is in both eyes, or on one side if it is in one eye.	Then tell him to have his head shaved; and burn him with one cauterization in the middle of the head; then cauterize him with two burns on the temples if the cataract is beginning in both eyes; or on the one side only if it is in one eye.	0.8795004
Then cauterize all the veins and arteries that are under the skin with the cautery iron, and let the cauterizations be the length and width of the temples, and beware of bleeding.	And with the cautery cut all the subcutaneous veins and arteries; and let the cauterizations be long, across the breadth of the temples.	0.7555579
If you see any bleeding, stop it immediately with any treatment you can, and we will discuss the wisdom of incising arteries, cutting them, and guarding against bleeding.	Beware of haemorrhage; if you see any, stanch it straight away with any means you can. We shall deal later on with the method of extraction and cutting out of arteries, and provision against haemorrhage.	0.813744
Two deep cauterizations may also be made on the nape of the neck, under the two bones.	Two strong cauterizations are sometimes made on the back of the neck below the two bones.	0.7752863
