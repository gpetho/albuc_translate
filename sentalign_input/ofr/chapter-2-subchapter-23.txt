of the waters of the eye
We have already described the appearances of the waters in the section, and what is necessary for piercing;
So act according to the health/condition.
You must have the patient sit between your legs crossed, away from the sunlight, and bind the healthy eye and tighten it very firmly;
then place the eye chart in your left hand if the eye is left, or in your right hand if the eye is right;
then take in your right hand, if the eye is left, the instrument which is called "almagda", or in your left hand, if the eye is right;
then place the tip of the instrument next to the pupil about the thickness of a spoke in the white of the eye towards the smaller tear duct, then push the instrument which is called "almagda" forcefully, and twist your hand until it pierces the white of the eye, and feel that the almagda reaches the empty space;
and the depth of the almagda's path must be equal to the distance from the pupil to the edge of the iris;
and that is the pupil of the eye;
you will see the bone in that spot because of the clarity of the cornea, and then place the instrument up to where the fluid is, then press it out from one path to another.
if the fluid descends immediately, the patient will see in front of him and the instrument in his eye.
Afterwards rest a little, and if the fluid rises again the second time, place the cautery with the instrument, and when it is inserted and it does not rise, then remove the almagda gently by turning your hand little by little;
and then put a little bit of rock salt in water, and bathe the eye in this.
Then cover the eye completely with tow or wool soaked in rose oil and egg white, and bandage it with the healthy eye.
We, and those who are of our time, apply ground cumin with egg white.
And if the almagda cannot enter the eye due to its hardness, for there are such men who have very hard eyes, then you must take the instrument which is called "alberit", of which this is the form:
And then pierce the conjunctiva only, and do not go too deep, but make a small hole, then put in the almagda, as we have said;
and at the completion of the work, prepare for the patient a suitable dormitory, where he may sleep on his back in a dark place;
and let him be free from all movements, and take light meals, and not move his head neither to the right nor to the left, and be bandaged according to his condition until the third day;
then unbind him in that same dark house, and test his sight, and make him see some things, and then reapply the bandage until the seventh day;
and you should not do this at the time of the treatment or immediately after the incision, but you must delay this, because the humor rises quickly.
If hot abscesses arise, untie the eye before the seventh day and treat it with that which soothes abscesses;
and when it is calmed, then uncover the sight and place a pad on his face to cover it for a few days, and he should still be in that dark house.
And then he should leave the house little by little, and return to his affairs;
and know that no apprentice should interfere in this case.
And one came to us who was from Iraq, who told us that in his country they made perforated almond paste through which they sucked water, but nevertheless I never saw any in our land, nor did I ever read about it in the books of the ancients;
and perhaps it is a new thing.
And these are the likenesses of the forms of almond paste, so that those who don't know them can see them;
and they should be made of brass specifically:
And let their tips be of this same fineness, and the last part in three sharp angles.
