On the incision of varices, which are varicose veins.
Varices, also known as varicose veins, are large, twisted veins filled with melancholic superfluities. They often appear in many parts of the body, but are most common in the legs, especially in people who travel, labor, or carry heavy loads.
Thus, it is necessary to purge the body of black bile occasionally with strong expulsion, and then bleed the patient from the basilic vein.
However, their treatment with iron is done in two ways: one involves making an incision and drawing out the black blood, and the other involves lifting and removing the entire vein.
The incision is done in this manner: first, soak the leg with hot water until the thick blood, which is thickened in the leg, is dissolved. Then, tightly bind the leg of the patient from the upper part of the thigh down to below the knee with a bandage. Next, make an incision in the vein at one or two or three places with a broad cut, and draw out the black blood with your hand from the lower part of the leg upward and from the top downward, until the desired amount of blood is extracted and you see that it is enough to relieve the patient.
Then, bandage the area and instruct the patient to abstain from foods that generate black bile.
Repeat the treatment by phlebotomy whenever the veins are filled and it troubles the patient.
But lifting the veins is done in this way: shave the patient's leg if it has many hairs, then put it in a bath and soak the leg with hot water until it turns red and the veins become prominent. Alternatively, have the patient perform vigorous exercise if a bath is not available, until the limb is heated.
Then, make an incision in the skin over the vein with a long cut either behind the knee or lower down near the heel.
Next, open the skin with hooks and strip the vein from all sides until it is fully visible, and you see it turning dark red to black.
Then, when you see it and the surrounding tissue looks white like a cord.
Next, insert a rod under it to lift it and detach it from the surrounding tissue, then suspend it with a hook.
Then make another incision about three fingers' width from the first, and strip the skin from the upper part of the vein until it is exposed.
Next, lift the vein and cut it at the lower incision near the heel, then extract and lift it until it comes out through the second incision, and continue extracting it from the upper incisions.
Continue this process until you have extracted it from the highest incision, until the entire vein is removed, and then cut it.
If you have difficulty extracting and lifting it, insert a needle with strong double thread and tie it off, then extract it, or insert the rod underneath and twist your hand around it until it is removed.
Be careful not to cut it; if it breaks, it will be very difficult to lift and will cause harm to the patient.
Once you have removed it completely, place a cloth soaked in wine, rose oil, and regular oil over the wound and treat it until it heals.
If the vein is contracted and twisted, and has loops at parts, and is not straight as described, you must make incisions over each twisted part and at the loops, then suspend it with hooks until you can lift it entirely.
Be careful during the incisions not to cut or injure the vein, as it will be difficult to lift; use your skill and prudence.
Shape of the tool used for vein sectioning:  
Shape of a hook for surgery:
It is not sharpened like a hook, nor does it have a pointed end so that it does not harm the vein; and it has a thick, flexible body, because if it were thin, it would cut the vein due to its thinness; rather, it has an excessive thickness as we have said.
