Introduction.
Preamble.
Since there is a lack of good masters of this art in our time, it is because medicine is a long field of study, and the author needs to practice dissection before his art with his own hands on the anatomy taught by Galen, until he knows the movements of the members, and their forms, and their connections, and their separations, and has knowledge of bones, nerves, and veins, and their numbers, and their exit, and their palpitations, and quietus, and places of origin.
And for this reason Hippocrates said, 'A name by itself is much, and a work by itself is little, especially in the art of the hand.'
However, we have already spoken about it at the beginning of this book.
Since he who does not know what we have said about anatomy will certainly fall into error, leading to the destruction of humans: as I saw many of them forming a science from it, and boasting about it without knowledge or experience.
That is, because I saw a dull doctor cut the apostema scrofulous wound on the woman's neck, and hit some blood vessels in her throat: why did the woman's blood flow until she died between his hands.
And I saw another doctor who assumed that he would remove a large stone from a man who had been walking for a long time, and the stone was big. So he approached him and removed the vein with a wisp of hair. Why did the man die on the third day?
And I too had been called to extract it; and I saw from a great stone, and from the arrangement of the nurses, that he would die.
And I saw another physician, who was taking a fee from our King for medicine: and it happened that a black eunuch, who was with him, broke his thigh near the heel; and the doctor persued with his ignorance, and bound the fracture together with thin splints and strong bindings, and did not stop the course of the wound's inflammation.
Then he let him go according to his desires. Then after a few days he sent him away and commanded him not to loosen the bindings; and so he remained until his leg and foot had healed properly, but then he came to ruin.
So I was called to loosen the bindings; and what followed was peace, and he was freed from his pain.
But the corruption had already taken hold in the limb; and I could not prevent it.
Then the corruption ceased to spread in the limb until he died.
And I saw another physician who opened a cancerous boil; and it became ulcery after a few days, until the malignancy spread to his lord.
That is, for when it is cancerous from the melancholic humor, then one should not approach it with iron at all unless it is present in a member that can bear it, so that it may be cut off entirely.
And for that reason, O sons, you must know that the art of surgery is divided into two parts: that which is associated with health, and that which is associated with danger in many arrangements.
And I too have already set forth in every part of this book wherever surgery has come up, where there is terror and fear.
Why do you need to tell him that, and to decrease it? So that the dumb fool doesn't offend me with his words and dishonors me.
Therefore, receive with care and protection, and bring our sick with ease and strength, and use a better path, led by the grace of God to salvation and worthy succession: and remove from us that which makes us fear, so that it may enter upon us hesitation in our faith and our comfort.
For it remains more to remain in our glory, and higher in the world, and at last to the quantities of us.
Because Galen has already said in some of his adages. Do not cure disease with medicine: do not name a doctor to disease.
But I have already divided this treatise into three chapters.
Chapter one.
Chapter on cauterization with fire and medication, on acute medication, on medicine that is hot or cold, on the shape of instruments and tools for cauterization, and on everything else needed in the operation.
Chapter two.
On cutting and piercing, phlebotomy and wound-cleaning, and extracts of arrows, and similar things: and the whole chapter on the shape of instruments.
Chapter three.
On restoration, dislocation, and cure for torsion, and similar things: the whole chapter, ordered from head to foot, and with the shapes of instruments.
But before I remember the operation with him, it is necessary that I should tell you the quality of his cauterization and non-cauterization: and in which complexion he shows it.
I therefore say that the speech on the quality of cauterization and its harm is long, subtle, scientific, and secret.
Also spoken was a great number of wise men, and they disagreed with each other; but for me, little of their words is sufficient, fearing the lengthiness of their speech.
I therefore say that cauterization is universal to all complexions, whether with or without substance; excepting two complexions, which are a hot, substance-less complexity and a dry, substance-less complexity.
In complexity, however, hot and dry with substance, they disagreed. Some, indeed, have said that cauterization is useful in that. And others said the opposite of that, namely that cauterization is not suitable for an illness which is hot and dry: for fire's nature is hot; and it is unsuitable, as it heals a hot and dry illness with hot and dry.
And he who says the opposite of that said: That by cauterization healing is done in any hot and dry illness which occurs in human bodies; for when you compare a human body, and its moisture, to the complexity of fire, the body's coldness disappears.
And I myself say by that speech: for by experiment I have discovered that at times.
However, it is not necessary that you make that point, except those who have already been tested and exercised in the last exercise of the chapter on cauterization, and have recognized the diversity of human complexions, and the nature of illnesses within them, and their causes, and their accidents, and the time period of their existence.
From the other complexities there is no fear for you; and especially in cold and moist illnesses. For all doctors have already agreed upon them; and they did not disagree on cauterization in them.
And know ye sons, that the secret of cure by cauterization with fire, and the goodness thereof, is when the medicine is burned with the fire upon the cautery: for fire is simple, whose action does not reach, unless to the member which is cauterized; and does not hurt the other member joined therewith, unless with a little injury.
But the action of medicine when it is burned and increased by fire reaches that which extends from the members: and perhaps makes it happen to a member that it has difficulty in being cured, and perhaps destroys it.
But fire because of its subtlety and goodness of its substance does not do that, unless it overflows.
Now this has already become known to us by trial, because of the length of practice and study with art and standing on the veracity of things: and because of this excuse from the length of speech.
And if it were not, because it is not allowed to this my book, I would give you the secret hidden in fire, and the quality of its action on the bodies by means of its expulsion: which expels diseases with a philosophical demonstration-phrase, which was added by the minds of your ancestors.
And know ye sons, that yourselves differ in the time when it is to be made to happen cautery, and put a better time of medicine:
And I say that cautery is suitable at all times: for the injury which happens because of time is hidden in a good will, which is attracted with the cautery. And especially if the cautery is for pains from necessary pains, firming, banquets which do not tolerate delay: for they are afraid of them, that a bad will happen which is greater than a little injury is to blame for the lack of time.
And do not fall into the minds of your sons that they should not judge, except for common and stupid doctors, namely that he who is cured of a disease by cautery does not always recover: and they put its consequence, and it is not like what they think: for cautery is not, unless in place of medicine, which changes the complexion, and dries up humidities which are the causes, wherefore pains happen.
Indeed, the cautery is superfluous on top of the medicine due to its velocity, vigor, and power, and because it belongs to the Lord: and it is possible that the sickness be restored at some time during the course of nursing, and location of sickness, and strength; and that it is prepared in his body from an excess that has accumulated in him: and that it comes to him in its acquisition from food, and similar things from causes, unless there is sickness, in which cauterization is administered.
Indeed, a slight sickness in a small member is superfluous due to excess dryness and humidity, like the pain of a tooth, for its own pleasure, and other similar things; because it is possible that this pain does not return to him. But that is true only in a few cases.
But the word of the cure is again true; that the cautery is last of all medicine, it is a straight word: not to that which they intend in him; for they believe that there is no healing with medication, nor with anything else after the occasion of the cautery.
But the case is just the opposite, and the intention, that the cautery is last of all medicine, is not true; unless when we administer methods of cure in some diseases, and do not give them medicine: then we administer at the end of the matter a cautery, and it comes to pass. Then it falls, that the cautery is last of all medicine, not according to the intention which the common people and many medical doctors understand.
But the ancient ones have said that a gold cautery is better than an iron one: and they did not say that, except for the equality of gold, and the limitation of its substance; and they have said that it does not make a wound in the cauterizing place. But that is not absolutely so; for I have tested that, and found that it does not make those wounds in certain bodies without others.
It is good to use the cautery with it, and better than using iron, as they say. Indeed, when you use the fire cautery on gold, it does not show you, when lit according to the quantity you use, due to the redness of the gold: and when it is proper for it to be cold, and if you add ignition on top of it, it melts in the fire and turns into leaves.
Why does the craftsman fall from that [practice]: and for that reason we prefer the cautery with iron among us, and more quickly and closer to the work, from truth to operation.
And I have already arranged this chapter on the cautery, according to the chapters: and I have arranged it from the head until the feet: so that you may find what you want from it.
Chapter II.
Confirm here the cauterization to the domain of humidity and coldness on the brain: which are two causes of salt, and a multitude of flow of humors from the head to the parts of the eyes and ears, and a multitude of sleep, and pain of teeth, and pain of throat: and generally all sickness that happens from coldness, such as paralysis, and salting, and epilepsies, and apoplexies, and similar things from those illnesses.
The way of cauterization is, so that you prescribe to the sick: that it be drained in the first place with a solute and purifying medicine, washing the head three nights, or four, according to what the power of the sickness, and its age, and custom, demand.
Then prescribe to him that he should wash his head with a soft cloth. Then make him sit between your hands, so that he has already placed his hands on his chest.
Then place the root of your palm on the root of his nose between his eyes. So whenever your middle finger has come up to that point with uneasiness, mark that spot with an unclean mark.
Then fire cautery: this is its shape.
Then put the flesh on the marked spot with your fingers, and squeeze it gently, and then remove it. Then quickly wipe your hand, and examine the spot.
If you see now a little quantity of salt on the bone, or a little quantity of licorice, then quickly wipe your hand. And if not, repeat the motion with the iron, or with another one when it is chilled: until you see the bones, which I told you.
Then take some salt and dissolve it in water, and immerse the cloth in it, and put it on the spot: and leave it for three days.
Then put on the spot the cloth immersed in butter, and leave it until the fire is completely extinguished. Then take care of that with the four-fold ointment until it heals.
They have already said that since the wound remains open for so long, pus is emitted: why is it better and more helpful?
And some of them said, to cauterize the skin all the way down to the bone: and hold the cautery until a certain hardness is achieved.
Then clean after that what has been burned, then cauterize it.
And others say that it is necessary to do with the cautery what I have just described, so that an impression of a knot is made on the bone: or the instrument which women put in their hair with a little letter: and they cut off, that vapours of the head's essence may be emitted from this place, and the wound may heal after a long time.
Then cauterize it until it hardens.
But these two species of cautery do not seem to exist among all men, except for certain people from second-hand knowledge out of fear.
And leave it: as far as I am concerned, it is better with the health of that person.
For the head is weakened by the resolution of its natural continuity; as we have testified in the other members; and above all when the head is weak, by nature: and the species of cautery is more sound and better with me, and I use it; so let us operate on it while it is healthy.
Chapter III: On the Mode of Causing a Head W
When in the whole head there is a chronic pain; and when it is prolonged in an invalid, and if he uses hypos, hot baths, head rinsings, oils, and applications: then operate. And especially if already cauterized with one kind of cautery which we have described, and gives it no benefit: then consider. For if the head is weak by nature's creation, and is not weak, and cold is keen: then cauterize with another kind of cautery a little below it. Then cauterize itself on all the horns of its head with its own cautery, and do not let the skin be burned, and uncover a quantity from the bone, which we have described. And cauterize itself with one kind of cautery at the back of its head, in the place which is called the vein; and this is a place where there is a flowing wind: and moisten your palm well in this, and do not uncover the bone. For an invalid will have keen pain because of this, and is far removed from the pain of the other parts of the head's cauterization.
And I will call this cautery in its place; and it should be that by which the horns of the head are cauterized, and the back of the head by a finer cautery, by which the middle of the head is cauterized.
Chapter IV: On Causing a Head to Bleed When it has
When pain and swelling occurs in part of the head, or when the pain extends to the eye, and if the head is washed with medicinal solutions, and the remaining treatment is given, as I have described in the divisions of diseases, and this does not benefit him entirely: then cauterization must be done in two ways: either cauterization with a sharp medicine that burns; or with iron.
But if cauterization is to be done with a sharp medicine that burns, i.e., take one of the teeth of another, and cut it out, and cut off its ends from the two sides. Then cut the place of pain at the time with a phlebotome on the side, until it is made into a place under the skin, in which a lump is captured.
Then introduce it into him under the skin, until it is hidden: then tie it over it with a knot of constrictive yarn, and leave it for fifteen hours, and then dissolve it, and pull out one, and leave it for two days, or three: then put a cloth over the spot immersed in butter, until a pus place forms: then care for the wound with ointment until it heals.
And if you want to make it with some sharp medicines that burn, which I have written about in the second book, On Burning Medications.
But cauterization with iron is according to this method. Fire Cauterization, whose form is this:
And it is called a Clavicle: because the form of the head is like the form of a clavicle, in which there is some curvature, and in the middle of it is a small eminence.
Then place the iron on the spot, and hold your hand: and you will turn the iron gradually with speed: and let the amount that burns be of the thickness of the skin, such as half of it. And raise your hand so that the artery below does not burn, and an outflow of blood does not occur.
Then dip the wound in saline water and put it on the place and leave it for three days; then put the wound with butter: later care with ointment until healed.
And if you see, cauterize this headache with an edge of scalpel second cautery. And do not cut the artery in this half-headache, but old one his own.
The mode of cauterizing in an old headache.
When you treat a headache, with what we have said before in the preceding cure, and that which we have said in the divisions of diseases, and there is no cure: and you see from the disease that it does not suffice to him what we have said from the first cauterization with medicine, or with cauterization with fire, then it must be that you bring the fires of Cauterie, until it becomes white after the signs on the place of pain with a line, whose length is half a finger, or almost like it: and put your hand out one way, and squeeze it until you touch the artery, and reach as far as the mouth.
However, it is necessary for you, so that you cauterize the continuation of the jaw, which moves when chewing, does not burn on the side, or nerve that moves it, from which happens a spasm.
And be on guard, and beware of the flow of blood of the artery, which is cut off. For there is a fear in the cutting off of it, and especially to him who does not know what he does, and is not learned, nor expert: and dismisses the operation with it at first.
And I come with a reminder of the regime of the flow of blood from an artery according to its own way, and in its place in this book.
That if you see from the disease that this cauterization is not sufficient for him, and you see the body bearing the cauterization in the middle of the head, as we have told, care about the sore, until it heals.
And if you see, administer cautery, which we have said in the chapter on arteriotomy with a cautery having two scalpels. For cauterization is better and more effective in this way.
§ On the method of cauterizing in ear pain.
When it happens that there is pain in the ear from cold, and cauterize with water, and the rest of the cure as we have said in the division, and the pain does not disappear, then fire Cautery: and that is what is called a point, whose form is this.
Then the points with it after its ignition around the whole ear, as it swells: or in the circumference of each, if at the same time pain is in both. And stretch it with the cautery from the root of the ear slightly, after you have marked the places with wax: and let the quantity of cauterium be ten points all over the ear, and almost the same.
Then care for the place, until they are healed.
§ On the method of cauterizing in torture.
Chapter VII.In cumque cauterium ignis fac
For the torture which is cured with cauterization, is not except for the kinds that happen from phlegm, according to what we have said in divisions of diseases.
And prolonged cauterization of a species that happens from drying up, and the spasm of a nerve.
When you treat this species of torture with hyoscyamus, and caputpurums, and gargarisms, and your cure does not bring about a result, then you should cauterize the sick three times: one near the root of the ear, and a second slightly below its place, and a third at the meeting of the two lips.
And put your cautery on the opposite side of the weak part. For softening does not happen except in the part that appears to be healthy.
And the form of cauterizing is so that it cauterizes itself with the cautery in the direct extremity of the upper ear near the hairline slightly: and another in the time: whose length is according to the length of the finger. And lay your hand with the cautery, until the amount of half the thickness of the skin is burned.
And this is the form of the cautery; and it has a kind of blade whose form is as follows: indeed, it is not too fine, as you see; and it is necessary that the blade should be somewhat thin, because of its thickness.
Then take care of the wound with this; until such time as it heals: unless you want to suffer a great deal of pain and loss.
(On the way of cauterizing in ancient apoplexia.)
When apoplexia is old, and you take care of it with that which I have said, and your medicine does not avail, and the patient has no fever, then cauterize him with four cauteries on every corner of his head, and with one in the middle of his head, as we have said, and with one at the back of his head, according to what preceded: and let the mode of the cautery be according to what preceded.
Also cauterize with the cautery on the mouth of the stomach: and it is more the last.
Then take care of it with that which preceded.
CHAPTER IX.
It is necessary that they be given to the first patient with great fever, and pills that clean the brain.
Then cut off his head entirely, and put on his scalp an ointment described in the book of ointments: and apply it sometimes.
This is the way to make a poultice: and do it according to the order which I have mentioned there.
If then he recovers by means of it, it is good. If not: then do to him three cauterizations in the posterior part of his head, which are descending from the upper part of the head down to the lower part of the eye: and put between every cauterization a thickness of finger.
Then take care of the poultice, with what preceded it.
If however you want to add something, and the sick man endures that: then do to him a cauterization in the middle. That if you want to add something: then cauterize him over two horns.
Then take care of the head until it is healed: and let the poultice be oiled according to the form which I have mentioned above.
As to the way of cauterizing in paralysis and softening.
Head
It is necessary that you proceed in cleaning out the head with fever, and with what I have said.
Then cut off the head and nurse it: then cauterize him in the middle of the head, and on all the horns of the head, and on the posterior part of it, and three on the spine of the neck.
If however you are not able to endure the softening of the body in many places, and the sick person endures that and the illness is strong: then cauterize him with four cauterizations on the spine of the back, and the last one while it is burning up from his skin, and wash your hand. Then take care of the head until it is healed: and let the poultice be oiled in this way.
As to the way of cauterizing in epilepsy.
He should not cauterize an epileptic patient unless he is certain that the epilepsy is due to phlegm.
Therefore, to begin with, he should wash out his brain with water and with the other remedies which we have mentioned in the section on general treatment; for a sick man is great or tolerant of medicine.
But if he is a boy who does not tolerate medicines, then let him be given gargles and mouthwashes to wash out the brain; before many days of good diet.
Then rinse his head, and afterwards cauterize him with one cautery in the middle of his head, and according to what has been said before in the method; and another cautery on his occiput, and over all the ridges of his head. If the sick man is strong and tolerant, then cauterize him with the medicines which I have mentioned for paralysis and softening of the body on the neck and back; and let there be olive oil as a second method of cautery.
But if the sick man is a boy, then place the fine cautery, according to this method:
The way of cauterizing in melancholy.
When the cause of melancholy is corrupt moisture and thick phlegm, then cauterize him with the medicines which we have mentioned for paralysis.
And if the cause of melancholy is an excess of vapor going into melancholy, and his body is wet with moisture; then give him in a vessel which washes out his brain, according to what has been said in the division: and afterwards rinse his head, and then make a loop made loosely of linen, like a circle.
Then place it in the middle of his head: and let the sick man sit holding himself upright.
Then present the liniment. And it is more honorable from old butter. Let him heat him on a moderate fire; and let him put his hand into him when he bears the heat, as he enters into him. Then he cleared him out in the middle of his head in a circle, and let him go until he became cold.
Then let him have this treatment once a week with the rest of the regimen, until he is healed.
Or if you want to put a ring around him, a small circle of fire, except that you hold your hand with the cauldron: and let it emit odour.
This kind of fire moistens the brain with its quality.
Then place a cloth soaked in butter, or chicken fat, on him.
The way of treating with fire going down to the eye.
Chapter 13:
When you see the beginning of the water in the eye, which I mentioned in the division, then begin to drink and make the sick person drink, so that he may refresh his head.
And keep him away from all moisture, and let him sit in a bath, on a few days' fast.
Then command him to wash his head, and let him treat himself with fire in the middle of his head. Then let him treat himself with fire on either side of the head with two torches, if the beginning is the descent of water into both eyes at once: or from one side, if the beginning is the entrance of water into one eye: and cut off with the torch all the veins and arteries that are under the skin: and let there be torches long in length. And let him guard against the flow of blood.
If you see anything of this, then cut it off immediately with whatever medicine is possible: and I will come with wisdom, which is in the extraction of arteries, and their cutting off, and their carefulness against the flow of blood.
And whenever he is treated with fire in wax, under two bones, with two torches at the end.
The way of treating with fire in ancient tears:
When the tears of the eyes are ancient and constant, and they are on the veins, and the arteries that are in the front of the head, it is certain that it is from cold and phlegm: then let him treat himself with fire by means of the same torch that I mentioned at the beginning of the entrance of water, a fire in the middle of the head, and two torches on either side of the head, and two torches in wax under two bones. And if it does not heal with addition, then cauterize him in all sides carefully the eye, on the extremity of the superciliary arch with a small cautery.
De mode cauterizandi in foetore nasi: cum vir entero esset, prope nasum ad pedem ad sinum, sub maxilla,
When you treat it, as we have said in the division, and the remedy does not take place: then approach, and give three nights of infirmary to him: then shave his head, and cauterize him with a medium cauldron, with an olive cauldron. Then cauterize him with two caulters, on the two supercilias under the hair a little.
And guard against the artery, lest you cut it.
This is the form of cauterization with claws.
De mode cauterizandi in mollificatione palpebrae: cum vir entero esset, prope nasum ad pedem ad sinum, sub maxilla, cum caut
When the eyelid of the eye is softened by sickness or moisture: then cauterize the eyelid with a lunar cauldron, with this cauldron of the moon.
And if the eye is (to be) opened, then cauterize him above the two supercilias with two caulters on all parts: and they are extended by the two times: and let the length of each cautery be according to the length of the supercilium: and do not remove your hand from the cautery, but according to the quantity that is burned the third eyelid.
De mode cauterizandi palpebra cum pilis invisserunt pungentes oculum: tunc prope nasum ad pedem ad sinum, sub maxilla, cauteriza Palpebram cauterio uno cum hoc cauterio lunari
is fire: or is with medicine-burning.
In the cauterium but with fire: however, before that, recommend that he stops his hairs from coming off, if he is of those who wash them, until they grow out and become even. If I puncture him near his eye: then constrict his eyes with putty, so that they do not move until they have healed.
When they have healed and been brought to a steady state, then place the head of the patient in your lap: afterwards mark the eyelids of his eyes with caustice, a mark that is shaped like a leaf of myrrh: and let the mark begin from near the hair.
Then place a damp cloth soaked in albumen, or in a slippery substance made from the mucilage of psyllum, on the eye.
Then apply fire to the mark, its shape being this:
Then cauterize over the mark, slowly and repeatedly, until the surface of the skin is completely burnt away, leaving a shape that resembles the leaf of myrrh, all by itself.
And the mark of your work is this: so that if you press the eyelids of his eyes together, and feel the hair near the mark of the wound, you will know that the patient's eye has been healed.
So then let go of your hand, and send him away for a few days.
Then place on the patient's skin a cloth soaked in butter, until the scar is removed. Then tend to the patient with ointment, until he is healed.
If any of his hair falls out an hour later and the eyelid becomes soft, then apply fire to the same place as before, as you did in the beginning.
If, however, the hair has fallen out at the lower eyelid, then cauterize that place until it has returned to its natural position: and make sure that the eyes do not tickle after.
It is as you command for the sick person: let him forgo shaving his hair, until it has grown and settled down. Make in the shape of a leaf of myrrh out of a piece of cloth or a patch of linen.
Then take out of a known soap, and from a clay that is not soaked in any weight or almost like it: then rub it together with good rubbing, and make it with speed, so that it does not grow cold. Then from that take a piece, and put it on the paper that you made like the form of an oak leaf, and place [it] on the eyelid of one eye or two eyes. And put under the eye a cotton wodge soaked in albumin or: and let the head of the patient lie in your lap.
And put your finger like an index on the medicine, and press it a little. And you move [it] whenever the sick person feels a tingling sensation from the medicine: for its bite is like fire.
While he was persisting in doing so because he found the bite of the medicine, then let go of the medicine, and move  [it] yourself with your finger. While he was calming down from the bite, then let go of the medicine, and wash the eye with water.
And then consider, if you see the eyelid close up, like it closes during burning or incising, is good: and if not, then repeat again on top of that place from the medicine where it does not impress the medicine, and does not harm, until your operation is completed, and the eye closes.
Then put on the eye a cotton wodge with butter, until the skin of the burn is peeled off. Then take care of the eye with a diaphenicon ointment, or any other, until it heals.
And it is necessary for you near the operation, to guard the last guards, so that nothing from the medicine falls into the eye.
That if the eyelid softens after a few days, and fights with some hair in the eye, then repeat again on that place the medicine where it softens from the eyelid of itself, like you did in the beginning. Then take care of the eye, until it heals.
And this is the form of an oak leaf.
And you should know that human eyes differ from each other in size and shape. So therefore according to this consideration be your thought: and do not conceal the straightness of its direction, which is the study of this art.
To cauterize a lacrimal fistula.
When you treat a fistula, as we have said in the division of diseases, and your treatment does not help: then you should cauterize it according to this method.
Order the sick person to put his head in your lap, and hold his head between your hands so that he does not move or shake it.
Then put the cotton wisp soaked in alumen, or in mucilage of psillium, on his eye; then hold it over the fire, which should be shaped like this.
Sit facing the fire, as the shape of a flute's feather extends from one end, so that it is heated on one side; and if the wisp sits so as to penetrate all the way to the other end, and if the wisp sits so as to be held up towards the sky.
However, this kind of fire is better suited to your purpose.
Then express the fistula if it is open, and remove anything from it, and dry it out; and if it is not open, then open it and remove any pus from it.
Then put the fire on it, which should burn fiercely.
And hold it with your hand somewhat near the fire, towards the nose, so that your hand does not move or shake the sick person; and place the fire on the eye fat, and dissolve it.
If then you see any pus at the beginning of your fire up to the mouth, it is good. And if not: then repeat the fire once or twice, if you can bear it; and discharge him after three days.
Then put the cotton wisp with butter on, and take care of the patient with drying ointment until he is healed.
That if he does not heal after fourty days, then put on him an acute corrosive medicine until the mouth is detected; and cut it according to what it says in his own chapter.
There is another mode of cautery, which some said first. intend to the place of the fistula, and find it: then put into it a narrow needle, that is, a fine cannula, whose form this is. And pour into it a quantity of liquid lead, and hold your hand with the cannula in good hold, so that it does not move at all, so that it does not run, or come to the eye of him.
And you should put on a patch over his eye that is made with an infusion in albumin or water.
Because lead burns the place of the fistula, and heals it with a wonderful cure.
That if the fistula is healed, as well as what we said from cautery, and cure, is good. And if not, then it is necessary to administer a nostrum hole, and reduce the fistula to the course of the nose, according to what comes into his own place.
On the mode of cauterizing in the fissures of the lips.
Often occur in the lip fissures, which are called hairs, and especially on the lips of boys.
When you care for these fissures, as well as what we said regarding the distribution of diseases, and there is no cure, then a small paring iron from fire, according to this form.
And let it be sharp according to the subtility of the knife.
Then put the lit iron quickly into the cracks of the fissures, until the fire reaches the bottom of the fissures.
Then care for him with a patch, until he is healed.
On the mode of cauterizing in the fistula of the mouth.
If it is that an apostema occurs in the root of the gums, or in the palate, or in the roots of the teeth: then pus is made, and breaks out: afterwards, it is healed over, and pus runs, and a fistula forms: then care for it, and there is no cure in it, then you should put fire cauterium according to the quantity, which he takes into the fistula. Then introduce the litmus into the opening of the fistula, and hold your hand, until the litmus reaches its bottom, and its tip: do this once or twice.
Then care for the patient after that, as we have said regarding the cure until he is cured.
If therefore is chopped off pus, and heals, it will be good. And if not, then it is necessary to detect the place, and remove the corrupted bone according to what comes into its head.
Regarding the way of cauterizing in gingival and molified teeth.
When the gums are softened by moisture, and the teeth move, and do not respond to treatment, then put the patient's head in your lap.
Then the fire-tip, of whose shape you have made after these things, so that you put it on a tooth: and introduce the ignited fire quickly into it; and hold your hand slightly, until the sick one feels the heat of the fire already reaching its root of the tooth.
And wipe your hand: then repeat the fire a few times, according to what you want.
Then fill the patient's mouth with salt water, and keep it for an hour: and spits it out.
For the tooth will become steady in its place, and the corrupted moisture will be tightened and dried up.
Regarding the way of cauterizing in toothache.
When the toothache is due to coldness, or there is coldness in it, or skin, and does not respond to treatment with medicines: then the fire within it is second according to two ways: either with butter; or with fire.
But the fire of it is as follows: to take butter that is yellow, and heat it up, and hold it on the tooth in an iron fork, or in a vessel. Then take a piece of cloth and wrap it around the end of the tentacle. Then dip the end of the tentacle in butter that has been heated: and place the end on the painful tooth quickly, and hold it until it begins to freeze: then repeat this several times until the fire's power reaches the root of the tooth.
And if you can't hold it, dip the cloth or the bandage in cold butter and place it on the painful tooth: and place a hot iron on top of it, until the fire reaches deep into the hollow of the tooth.
But cauterization with fire is so that you can see towards the hole in the air, or a iron tube. And sit in his body some grease, so that the fire' sharp point does not reach the sick mouth.
Then hold the cautery, its shape depending on the case: and place it on the tooth: and hold your hand so that the cauterization begins to freeze.
Do this several times, for the pain will be relieved, or do it on the same day, or on another day.
And it is necessary that the cauterization impression be filled so that the sick mouth is filled with good balm, and holds it for an hour: then let it open widely.
And this is the form of the cautery.
Cauterize with whichever end you will, as well as it can be: and this is the form of the tube.
The way to cauterize in staphylas.
When the staphylas are from phlegm, and from cold humors, and are not submissive to digestion through medicines, and want to digest them quickly: then take a careful fire, whose shape is this.
It has two open ends so that the smoke can come out through the other end of the cautery: and place the fire on the apostema once, and a second time if you tolerate it, until it reaches deep into the apostema.
If the wound is small: then place the cautery according to the quantity of the wound.
Then let him lie for three days, and put over him a cloth dampened with vinegar until he is healed from the burn.
Then care for the wound with a dental ointment until it has healed in shape of a tube.
The way of cauterizing in a raucous voice and constriction of a breath.
When there is an excess of moisture above the tube of the lung, and especially when it is accompanied by a cold complexion, then it is necessary that the sick person be discharged at once with soluable medicines.
Then cauterize the throat with a mild caustic at the root of the tonsils in a depressed place; and be careful, so that you do not apply the caustic to the throat or skin, unless there is something on it.
Then cauterize the throat with another caustic at the joint of the neck in the last part of the spine of the last; and let the caustic be a nail according to the manner which has preceded.
Then care for the person with what has preceded, until he is healed.
The way of cauterizing in respiratory ailments of the lung and throat.
When the cough and illness of the lung are due to cold humidities, and the sick person does not have a fever or consumption, and the illness is old: then cauterize the throat with two caustics above the jawbone in depressed places, gently and mildly. And with another caustic in the middle of the breast between two nipples; and let the caustic be a tube according to the shape which has preceded.
And if your cauterization is by piercing with a cautery which is called a 'Punctum', whose shape has preceded in the piercing of pain in the ears: and let there be points of twenty points up to almost another.
Then care for the person with what has preceded, until he is healed.
And it has also three branches for sitting cautery: in this form. Why should you be comforted by the cauterization with him, when you make a one-three cauterization with him.
Chapter XXVII
When the head of the adductor is causing humidity and is not returning to its place at the time of dislocation, until it has become accustomed to its return, then dislocate it by a slight movement; for this we have already testified that it should be reduced; Then let the sick person lie on his back or on his healthy side. Then rub with oil, which is within the titillum on the upper part with your left-hand fingers: and if the joint is dislocated inwardly.
Then take the cautery with two wires. Whose form is this.
Then cauterize with oil, until it penetrates to another side, and the shape of the cauterization is made with four cauterizations.
And when the cauterization is made with a cautery having three wires, why does the shape of the cauterization then become six smaller ones? And the wires are according to the subtlety of the touch.
And this is the form of the cauterization having three wires.
And when one is added to this mode, why are there eight cauterizations?
Then place on the cautery crushed peppercorns with salt. Then make so that it adheres to the tranquility of the sick, so that no member moves at any time, until it is comforted.
And if the dislocation is upward and rarely does so, then cauterize it on the shoulder with a clauvus cautery, or with many punctures.
For the joint becomes secure, and removes humidity: and the sick person is healed.
To cauterize the stomach.
When cold and moisture accumulate in the stomach, until they are removed from his own skin, and there are many discharge to it, and persist in treatment methods, and do not work: then it should lie down on his back, and spread out his legs, and stretch his hands. Then cauterize with six cauterization, cauterization under the cochlea in the quantity of one finger with cauterization of the nail, and two cauterization below from the two sides a cautery of one, until the figure of the cauterization is triangular. And lengthen between each other so that they do not join together, when they make pus.
And be the depth of cauterization quantity of two thirds the thickness of the skin.
And be the figure of the cauterization as such without addition: and if you want to cauterize with a large cauterization in the middle of the stomach according to this form: and be the cauterization that is made this way one according to the shape of a circle according to this form.
And be cauterized the stomach by piercing it who shudders at this cauterization: and it is as the signs on the stomach point according to quantity that you do with caustics: then cauterize the pierce it: then care for the stomach with treatment, which preceded until it is healed.
To cauterize the cold stomach.
When it is painful in the back due to cold and moisture, or due to rough winds, until it comes out of his own skin natural exit of waste, and care for the sick with what we have said, and does not benefit in it: then let the sick person lie on his back on his scalp, and place three cauterization according to this form, and the same quantity above the spine, where the bed of a man is located: and be the space that is between each other according to the thickness of the finger: and be the cauterization according to the length of the body straight: and do not squeeze your hand with a large cauterization.
And let there be an amount that is heated by the thickness of the skin, and a half of it not added: and let the sick stand on his own feet.
But if he is not standing, then he should lie down, for he has already extended his legs and raised his arms.
This is the form of the cautery.
And you too can do this cauterization with a knife, when there is subtlety and wisdom with you in the art.
And guard yourself so that you do not proceed last in the cauterization, and let the thickness of the skin be heated throughout, since the thickness of the skin is there, know that one.
[On the mode of cauterizing the liver.]
When an ulcer is seen to be coming out, and you need to know if it is in the liver or in its membrane: then if it is in the liver, you will see a dull pain, and there is a mild acuteness: and you will see that the treatment of the doctors for it tires them out.
It should be so that the sick person lies down on his own bed. Then figure out the position of the ulcer with a mirror: then light the cauterizing fire so that it is heated by radiation. And this is its form. And cauterize it with one cauterizing fire until the skin throughout is burned, and reaches the siphum, until the pus comes out entirely: then take care of the cure for the healing of ulcers, until it heals.
And it is not appropriate that this cauterization be done with the appearance of someone who has been studying medicine for a long time: and because, at times, some diseases come to those who carry out such an operation: in fact, let one dare to perform such an operation.
But I think it is better to leave it alone.
To cauterize in pleurisy.
The ancients said that the cauterization with the roots of aristochoea is applied to cold pleurisy in this way. And it is as follows: you shall receive from the dry roots of aristochoea a long root, which is found in it, and make it as large as the thickness of a finger. Then immerse it in oil: and light it on fire. Then cauterize with a long cautery in that which is between the rib and the collarbone, and two small cauteries under the guide a little inclined on either side, which are under the beard.
And two cauteries also in that which is between the fifth and sixth ribs inclined towards the back a little: and a long cautery in the middle of the chest, and another above the stomach. And three cauteries from the back: one in that which is between two spatulas; and two cauteries from the sides of the chest, the lower cautery being in that which is between two spatulas.
And it is not necessary that you should squeeze your hand with the cautery, but let it be held out in front of your skin smelling.
And some ancient men said that they who use a cautery of iron similar to a radium: and light it up, and put it in that which is between the ribs until it reaches the pus, and the pus comes out: as we have said in the pustule of the liver.
But in this piercing with the cautery there is a fear, that either the sick man dies immediately, or a fistula happens to the place which does not heal.
Chapter 32.
When you are curing a disease of the spleen, with that which we have said about dividing the diseases, and your cure does not bring forth its effect, then cauterize it in three ways, all of which are straight.
One is enough to make three wounds or four by tracing along the length of the splenic section according to the figure of the smaller liver, which preceded in form.
And between each wound there should be a quantity of thickness of the finger, or more or less.
And let the distance between the wounds be equal to that which we mentioned in the cauterization of the liver.
And do not compress your hand when you cauterize; and let him lie on his back.
And another mode of cauterization is that which we mentioned in the chapter on shoulder dislocations: and dry up the skin, which lies directly in front of the spleen where it reaches the bed of the left side; and let your hand rise while you dry up the skin according to the width of the body, so that the wounds may reach according to the length of the body.
Then introduce two hot knives deeply, until you penetrate through with them the skin on the opposite side; then remove the cautery; so there will be four wounds.
And if you wish to cauterize with a knife having three knives.
Then take care of the cautery after you have removed it, if it should emit pus for many days: for it is more healing than each that has preceded in the cure.
The mode of cauterization in the Hydropsys.
The cautery does not fall into the Hydropsis if it is properly raised up.
When you cure the Hydropsis with the modes of cure which we mentioned in the division, and there is no cure, then you should cauterize four times around the navel, and once over the stomach, and once over the liver, and once behind each spine, and one in front of the chest, and another in front of the stomach: and let the distance between each cautery be close to the thickness of the skin.
Then remove the cautery so that it opens up, to emit pus after a long time.
And do not let the patient depart from you after the cauterization, for he should gather up two purposes, and the healing will be quick to him with the help of God.
Indeed, the form of the cautery with which the abdomen is cauterized, should be a closure: second because it precedes its form: and its back, with which he is cauterized, should be an olive, because it precedes its form.
The mode of cauterizing the feet and the legs.
When they are put out into the Hydroptic, and are filled with yellow water: you should cauterize on the back of the foot in the noccere, which is between the auricular and the ring finger: and wash your hand with the cautery, and do not twist it: then wash your hand: and do not touch it at all.
For the yellow water will make a mark, and the cautery will be made according to this form.
Then make two cauteries on the two legs, and let the cautery be made with the tip of a knife-edge cautery: and let the cautery be made according to the length of the leg, one under the knee, and the other below it, about in the middle of the leg: and let there be two cauteries on the whole loin, and do not let the cautery be closed for a long time: so that it will come out from it some water: then care for him with the rest that we have said.
The mode of cauterizing in the abdominal solution.
Chapter XXXV. The Abdominal Solution.
When the solution of the stomach is loosened by cold and moisture, until the retaining virtue and digesting power, which are in the stomach and intestines, has weakened: and care for it with the methods of care, and does not heal: and you will see a sick person who tolerates an exuberant virtue, then cauterize him with a great cautery on his stomach, second because it precedes in the cauterization of the stomach with a circular cautery, and four small cauteries around the navel, with a small tip-shaped cautery: and a cautery over the alcatine above the loins, or two cauteries.
And if you see moistures that are abundant, and the sickly one bearing it, then cauterize him with cautery over the ribcage, and cautery over the entire ileum: and perhaps you added two small cauteries near the great stomach.
For cure is accomplished by a surgeon whose skill is not in error.
On the mode of cauterizing Hemorrhoids.
Chapter 36. On the Mode of Cauterizing Hemorr
When there are many ancient Hemorrhoids, or one, and they are of gross humors, cold, or corrupt moistures, and so cure them along with what we have said in the division, and there is no cure: then cauterize three cauteries on the lower part of the spine behind a slightly triangular almighty, and a cautery under the navel almost like two fingers.
And if you think that his stomach is cold, and his food is not digested, and you see his face turn pale, then cauterize him over the stomach with a large cautery, according to what preceded it: and cauterize on his Epopeus, and with another on his Splenium, with a clavicle cautery: and leave the cautery open for some time: and then cure him, until he is healed.
Chapter 37. On the Mode of Cauterizing Athel
When you cut off the athel, then you light a cautery which is radiated with fire. Then introduce the lit athel into the cut athel: and with your hand, until the cautery reaches the opening of the anus, from which runs blood: do this once, or twice.
If there are many athel, then cauterize each one according to what we have described. Then cure them with the ointment, along with what is appropriate for them, until they are healed.
And if you cauterize him with a large cautery over the sacrum, it is more final in its effect.
To cauterize the fistula in the anus.
Chapter 38 on Head.
When the patient does not submit to cutting and the operation that we have described in its place, and trembles at it, perhaps he will be healed with cauterization.
When then happens to someone a fistula, and it is old, pus runs out of it, and corrupt moisture. It is fitting that you should test it with a subtle touch. Then know the depth of its quantity by testing.
Then light a cautery fire, which is like a ray. Then insert yourself with the lit cautery into the fistula and measure how much it enters.
And repeatedly pass the cautery over it until all corrupt bodies are burned up, once, or twice, or three times, depending on the need.
And guard yourself from burning of the nerve, if there is one, or a large vein: or if the fistula opens into the body of the uterus, or the body of the intestine, then guard yourself from all such places.
And do not do this unless the fistula is in a fleshy place: and consider that it does not penetrate.
Then take care of the place until it is healed.
But if the place seals itself and no more material is shed from it for a long time: then know that it has been completely healed.
And if no material is shed from it, then know that it is penetrating, or has an opening into its depth, or almost like it: of which remember the place.
The way to cauterize the kidneys.
When pain from cold or a gross wind afflicts the kidneys and they are aching because of it, then you should cauterize each kidney individually from above, with a cautery on all the kidneys with a nail, whose reminder was this.
And perhaps we cauterized him himself second by himself almeidatu. Why are there three lined. Therefore will be the last in iuuamento.
§ On the way to cauterize the Vesica.
When it happens in Vesica weakness, and softening from cold re and moisture, until he does not retain weak urinarv, then cauterize him himself at the bottom of the supply over Vesica, where begin the hair of the comb, and cautery from the right supply, and another from his left: and sit length of his cauterization later side according to quantity of knuckle pollicis: and cauterize him himself cauterio lower back, or two cauteries if you tolerate that: and sit according to what came before cauterium claw.
§ On the way to cauterize the Matrix.
When it happens in Matrix cold and moisture, and it is forbidden by him from impregnation, and his menstrua corrupt, and is delayed their provocation, and happens to him at the aduentum of them a pain, then it should be ut cauterizetur tribus cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, sicut diximus in cauterizatione uesicae, and cautery on alcatim lower back, or two cauteries: and sit cautery claw.
§ On the way to cauterize the Anus in dislocation.
When are poured out humidities of the mucous Anus to the faeces, and is a cause of exit from its place: and the sign of it is that he prolongs his crus over another, when they face one to another: and is found the location of dislocation in that vacuus.
Therefore it should be that cauterizes the weak on the Anus of himself similar circle: after which you have the signs with the caustice in circumitu pixidis, like a refolded: and let fall itself pixis in the middle of the circle.
That if you do not have this cautery present, then cauterize it with three cauteries, with a large olive oil cautery: and let the depth of the cautery be according to the thickness of the skin of all.
Then take care of the wound, until it heals.
The mode of cauterizing in sciatica.
When it happens that there is pain in the sciatic nerve, and there is a cause for this pain, cold and wetness: and the sick person is treated with it as we have said in the division, and there is no cure, and it becomes stale: then it is necessary that you should separate the sick person from gross humors with fetid pills, or with artificial pills, and others. Then cauterize it.
And the mode of the cautery in her is according to two ways: either the cautery with burning medicines, or the cautery with fire.
The cautery with fire is according to many ways.
One of these is, that you cauterize over the sciatic plexus with three triangular cauteries, according to this form. And let them be of good depth, or bad. And there is a space which is according to the thickness of the finger between every cautery; and let there be an olive oil cautery.
When however it happens that the cautery is made in the middle on top of the sciatic plexus itself. Why are there four cauteries?
And if you wish to cauterize with a circle, whose form preceded in the cauterization of the sciatic dislocation, one: that it is a circle containing all the sciatica.
And burn up the thickness of the skin of all.
This is the mode of cauterizing in sciatica, when there is a painful adherence to the sciatic itself, and does not extend until the pelvis and legs.
But if it extends until the pelvis and legs, then cauterize it with two cauteries on top of the pelvis, on the place where the pain is, and with your cautery on the four fingers slightly towards the outside: and let there be a scalpel-like cautery.
And let the depth of the incision correspond to the thickness of the skin.
If the patient complains that the pain extends up to the toes, then cauterize him at that place with a single, double, triple or multiple punctures, depending on his tolerance.
And if the patient complains of pain under the knee towards the leg, then cauterize him there with a single knife cut.
And make sure that with all your cauterizations, you do not end up with the knife burning nerves, or a large artery, and do not cause harm to any bad disease or contraction on it.
And I have seen one and another who cauterized on top of the thigh, and were finished with the cauterization, and their leg became swollen, until a tumor was formed, and it was perforate all over, and corrupted all over: then there happened a solution of the blood, and death after that.
If the pain is on both sides at the same time, cauterize one side according to this method:
And some wise people have said about the cauterization of the anchal, whose cauterization is this way: Make a similar shape out of iron, whose diameter is half the size of the palm, and let it be placed at the opening according to the thickness of the finger nail or less, and let there be another one inside that third.
And let there be a space between each anchal that is the quantity of the thumb nail: and let there be openings on both sides: and make their height almost like a knot, or two knots: and make them handle-like by bending them in the anchae.
Then let it be heated in fire until it turns red, and let sparks come off: then place it on a plate of the anchal lying down on the healthy side. So cauterize it with three round cuts in one direction.
Then let him leave the wound to the tribes for three days. Then bind it with butter: and let the open wound stand many days. Then take care of the wound with ointment, until it is healed.
Says Al-Bu-Kaas, with this kind of burn, we use very little because of the fearsome appearance of it: and therefore, because there are few who wait over it.
However, it is from good cauterization that he suffers, and remains with him the place of his wound.
But the cauterium with doctors who attend him is, so that you make two knots with a loop that comes down with the bar of his door from iron, or from brass, its length to their height: and there are two knots on them, or almost like themselves.
And there should be a space that is between the two equal amounts of thickness of the finger, and they are open upper and lower: and there should be one that holds itself in the opposite direction, according to this form.
Then place it on ash-paste, the sick man lying on the healthy side. And press your hand hard on the ash-paste. Then pour between the two circles of hot water, which is warmed with fire slightly, and hold it for a quantity of time: and let the sick man feel the tingling of it, and his own burning, for he finds the tingling like fire, until he sleeps from it.
Then wash your hand with an instrument, and rinse all the ash completely with sweet water: then let it stand for three days.
And put butter on it, until it removes the blackness of burning: and let it stand for a few days, and let the pus run out from it. For it is the latest in healing.
Then take care of that with ointment, until it is healed.
If the pain extends to the hip, or the foot: let him have a standing position in it that holds water, according to what you did in the ash equally.
And this is the method for hot and cold water: I have already written about it in my treatise on rectifying medicines. Take the two medicines, one part alkaline and one part non-extinct calcis; mix them together, and put them into a new jug with a small hole at the bottom of one part only, according to the quantity that is to be added: and put under the bottom of the jug another jug empty: and pour on the water from the sweet well which immerses both of them with the finger: then squeeze them together firmly with your hand; and let the jugs go until the sharp water comes out at the bottom of the jug.
Then collect the whole water, and pour it on the other calcis; and drink it up, until it returns again.
This will then be very strong in acidity, which is administered in many medicinal operations, and in the cauterization of the remaining members. For it efficacious in operation of fire itself.
And from medicines are, with which they cauterize the broad, also as theriacakis, and honey of anacardium, and calcic soap, so that both are mixed together.
And Galenus himself reported, relating of a man of the ancient cure, who was cured of pain in the ankle and sciatic pain: and he praised it very much. And he said, "He did not like any other cure, and was cured from one foot only, until he reported, that perhaps he entered into a hot bath, and came out already well.
And this is to be taken from the seitaragi man: and if a viride is not found, it is taken just as it is, fresh: and it is massaged much with some fat, and placed on the ankle, where the pain is, or on the hip: and it is bound up, and left for three hours, or for such a quantity that the patient feels the sensation of painful tedium. Then introduce him into the bath.
When therefore the body becomes hot, introduce it into the heat. For the pain has subsided, and he is recovering.
And you should know that it is not appropriate to use any medicine with these medicines unless after the body has been evacuated.
And Dioscorides, who said that when the dung of goats is applied with fire to a sciatic pain, it will be cured; and it becomes a fire in this way. The wool is dried, and imbibes the old oil, and is placed on a deep place, which is between the thumb of the foot, and between the fire, and is closer to the fire.
Then take the goat dung as it is, and set it on fire in the fire, until it becomes a coal.
Then place the coal on the wool, and leave it until it goes out. Then repeat this. So do not stop doing that, until the sense has become accustomed to the mediation up to the ankle, and the pain has rested.
And this method of cautery is called Vaccinium cautery.
§ On the cauterization of the pain of the back.
When pain occurs in the back from various causes, or from injury, or from excessive discharge, and such like, by means of cold and wet material: and cauterization does not take place unless in this one form alone, which is made by applying cold material.
It is necessary therefore after the discharge of the wounds with pungent pills, and similar ones, that they may be placed on the back where there is pain, three lines according to the length of the spine itself, after having marked them with fire in every line; five cauterizations, or more according to the quantity which comes from the tolerance of the wound's virtue: and let cauterization be made with cautery punctures.
And if you wish, cauterize three cauterizations, or four, with the middle clavus, according to this form.
To cauterize in the cauldron of gibbosity.
This illness often occurs in small children.
And the sign of this illness in children is: that which happens to him a rigor in hunger when they are lifted up, and movement: and an swelling in the last spine of the back and knots of him, which already began to emerge over the other spines.
When you see this, and want to make it, then cauterize him with the cauldron that sits in this form a circle.
And he takes the cautery over all parts of the spine equally: and if you want to cauterize around the spine with the cauldron of a dot two lines, or three: and let be dots nearby side by side.
Then care for the place, until it is healed with him that I said.
And be careful, do not administer the cauldron to gibbosity, which is done in a spasm of a nerve.
Ch. On the mode cauterizing in podagra, and pains of joints.
When the pains of joints are from cold humidities that are poured out to any member of the body, then when these pains occur in the feet, it is the custom of the doctors to name it podagra by right.
When this podagra of cold cause is cured with modes of curing, and the pains do not move away, then remove the cautery to move them.
And is, as cauterizes him after his evacuation in the circumférence of the joint of the feet, caulteries many: and let be the cauldron Olive oil.
And if you can stand as dots on the face of the foot, then do it with a dot of cauldron. That if they ascend pains up to the knees, or other joints, and often this happens: then cauterize him over all knee with four cauldron, or six from every part, with this same cauldron of Olive oil.
If, however, you need more of this remedy, then cauterize him then. And do not submerge your hand with the caustic, but rather sit around it with only the spiciness of the skin.
If, however, the pains rise up to the knees, and the back: then administer what we said above from the caustic in our chapter.
That if the pains are only in the hands, then poke around with fire, as they return like two lines.
If, however, there remains any pain in the fingers, then poke them, over every lump a point, and over the palm of the hand.
If, however, the pains rise up after days to the elbows, or to the shoulders, then cauterize both of them from all parts.
And do not let the sick person recover from a good regimen, from the reception of medicines. For if the regimen is made good, and the phlegm is excreted, it will be healed by the help of God with this caustic.
On the Manner of Causing a Burn to Heale Broken Bones.
When a Rupture has occurred in the groin, and has descended into the bowels, or to the testicle, and it is beginning to be near to the scrotum: then you shall order the sick person to cease from food in his own day. And let him use laxatives, so that the dung may descend from his own gut.
Then let him sit between your hands on his back: and order him that he hold his breath until he has gone forth, or show his buttocks, or his intestine.
Then let him reduce the man with your fingers, and mark with the caustic under a Rupture on the top of the pelvis, with the sign whose end is similar to half a circle towards the upper part of the body.
Then let the caustic fire be held, with this form, until it has become white, and throw off sparks. Then let the intestine be reduced, or the buttocks to its cavity. Then let the attendant place his hand upon the place so that he does not exit the intestines: and you have already opened between the ribs of the sick person, and placed under it the penis, and one servant stands on his ribs, and another on his chest who holds the hands.
Then let him deposit the caustic on the spot, with your hand holding the caustic upright. And hold him, until you are satisfied with him: or else go again with him by another route, if you are not satisfied with him in the first place up to the mouth.
And carefully observe that there is no exit from the intestines at the time of your cauterization, so that he does not burn himself, and let him go through it to the sick or to death, or great mischief.
And know that when you do not achieve the mouth with the caustic, your operation is fruitless.
And it should be that the caustic of infants is subtle, according to their measure.
Then care for him with the rest of the ointment, until he recovers.
And let the sick person lie on his back for forty days, until the wound is closed.
And let him take food by length of time of his cure, which softens his gut: so that he does not exit the intestines through desire and defecation.
Then when he should rise after forty days, then give him a looser ligature, and let him hold for forty more days.
And let him abstain from work, and be filled with food and drink, and loud speeches.
For when he uses this regimen, he is healed by a whole cure.
And I will tell the cure of ruptures with an incision in its chapter.
When, however, ruptures occur in the remaining gut, and are incipient, and do not enter, then cauterize his rupture with your round caustic according to its quantity: and let it be what is burned from then on as the third one. Then take care of yourself, as we have said: and do not be led astray.
And some have said first: that it should be cauterized with a triangular cautery, according to this form.
Afterwards sign it with encaustic, and place the line which is across from the lateral upper part of the rupture, and another line towards the bottom. And put your hand in the middle with the cautery closed.
But it is easier and better to use the cautery first.
The mode of cauterizing in pains by accident, or by percussion.
Chapter LXVIII.
When it happens in some member by accident, or by percussion: and that pain persists a long time, and does not respond to treatment with medicines: then it should be cauterized with the Pointed cautery.
And let the cautery be to all members according to its size, and its health, and its weakness, and its virtue, and its location of twist, and the pain from it.
But if it is healed by the first cauterization, it is good. If not: then repeat on top of it the cauterization.
For these pains are used to pass from one member to another as it approaches that which is affected. Why should the consequences be caused by the cautery, until the sick is healed.
The mode of cauterizing in Leprosy.
But the lepers should be cauterized by a sharp instrument. And especially the characteristic of Leprosy, which is caused by putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy: so that you consider carefully how to cauterize it.
If this Leprosy is not open, and you have treated it with the one we have mentioned in the division, and it has not come down, nor stayed: and you wait for the disease to encompass the whole complexion: then cauterize him on top of the head with five cauteries: one in the middle of the hairline, and a second lower down towards the forehead at the end of the hair, and two above the two ears, and one behind the nape of the neck.
And last, you shall hold your hand with the cautery just a little while, until it prints upon the mouth an impression of pallor, and the membranes are displaced from it; that the expiration of the vapors of great heat may be relieved, and the cautery also over the splenetic organ, according to what went before.
But if the leper has already spread on the sick person and appears clearly: then you shall cauterize with these cauteries which we said in the beginning, and with a cautery on the tip of the nose, and two cauteries on the two cheeks, and two cauteries on the two sides of the neck, and six on the sides of the back, and one great one on the hahosas near the tail end and one above it: and two on the shoulders and two on the elbows, and two on the breasts, and one on the entire chest, from the connection of the fingers of his hands and feet: and cauterize him on all joints, from the connection of the fingers of his hands and the feet of his feet: and cauterize him on all heels of his feet, and on the knuckles of his hands.
And so that you do not burn them, take care from the nerves that are at the very end of the heel.
And when one is cauterized with a cautery on the bone of the chest, and another on the bone of the stomach, and another on the liver.
And you should know that the more you add cautery, the greater is the benefit, and the more it confers.
And you should know that a sick person does not feel pain in the cautery, unlike a healthy person: therefore because his body is already stunned.
And it is fitting that the cauteries should be of a size and proportion appropriate to the limbs and joints: according to what went before from the appearance of the tools of the trade.
Then care for the cauteries with flour of herb and honey, and with the rest of the cure, until it is healed.
To cauterize in a stupor.
When a limb is stuporous and does not heal with medicines, oils, plasters, and so on, then cauterize the limb that is stuporous with cautery, according as the magnitude of the limb is increased, or its diminutio
And place your cautery instrument within the thickness of the skin a little. Then care for the limb with ointment until it is healed.
And sometimes when cauterization occurs for some stupefaction which befalls the hand, or foot, in the spine of the back near the exit of nerves which stir that limb: and the stupefaction is removed.
But he does not do this [cauterization] unless he is wise in the anatomy of limbs, and knows the exit of nerves which stir the body.
Head.
When Albucasis is burned and does not bear any of the artifice of medicine: then cauterize on top of it a little with deep cautery, according as the thickness of the skin, until the hue is removed, and its color is changed.
Then care for the limb with herb flour, with rose oil and leaves of arglochea, and pigeon blood, and duck blood: let one part be mixed, let them spread on a cloth, and let them adhere to the place until it is healed.
The way to cauterize in cancer.Caput LII.
When cancer is beginning, and the eye is affected: then cauterize the eye with a circular cautery according as it turns.
But the wise have said, that the last cautery in the middle should be used.Et quandoque cauterizatur, non facit utrique oculo, sed mediocoelo, et postea
But to me that does not seem right: for I fear that it will ulcerate: and I have seen it sometimes.
And it is better that he be cauterized around his wound with a circle, as we have said: or with many caustics.
Regarding the method of cauterizing in ablation.
When someone has ablation and it is delayed in maturing, or because of superfluous reasons that cause it, or because of old age, when the blood is little, or because of time, and the pulse rushes to mature ablation, then cauterize around his wound with a few caustics by pricking. Then let go of him. For it will hurry with the maturation.
But if you pierce his wound with a caustic, then take this kind of caustic, which is in the form of:
And place him in the middle of the ablation until it enters the skin; and let the caustic remain with him because it will weaken, so that the flow of blood may be eased.
Then take care of him until he is healed.
Regarding the method of cauterizing with a caustic that corrupts.
Chapter III. On Corrupted Wounds.
Corrosion is not but corruption in a walking member, and it corrupts the member itself; just as fire consumes dry wood.
But if you see corrosion in a place that tolerates caustic with fire, then take many caustics, small and large, as is suitable for the place where corrosion is.
Then cauterize him from all parts until you eradicate the entire corruption, and do not leave any trace of it.
Then let him go for three days, and place sulfur, reduced with oil, on the cauterized places until all the eschar and corruption are eradicated.
Then take care of him with ointments that generate flesh.
But if you see that after three days healthy flesh is born by a kind of rebirth, and there is no corruption, it is good.
And if not: then apply cautery to that which remains in the corrupted locations.
And sometimes when it is infected it is cured with acute medicine. For it itself rises up at the place of cauterization.
However, cauterization with fire is faster in effect: and I have indeed already said that cauterization with acute medicine is applied in division: so take it there when it tolerates it.
On the method of cauterizing in slits and warts.
Chapter 50.
This disease often occurs in the lower parts of the feet: and it is a gross, filter-like growth that hurts the foot.
And there are two ways of applying cauterization to them: cauterization with fire and cauterization with hot water.
As for the cauterization with fire, like the feathers of a penning torch it is prepared from iron, according to the quantity that contains the clap when all parts are covered: and its edge should be sharp.
Then place the burned thing on the clap. Then turn the hand with the cautery around the clap, until the cauterization reaches the depth of the clap: and leave it for three days, until pus begins to be discharged. Then bind the thing with wet silkworm threads, crushed with salt: and leave the plaster on the thing at night. For it itself will be eradicated from its roots.
Then care for the place with a soft salve of meat, until it heals.
If they are not turned inside out and often occur on the surface of the body, especially on the hands and feet: then apply to them cauterization with hot water: and it is like receiving a tube made of brass, iron, or a feather of a penning torch: and place it on the clap, or on an atharel. Then pour into the tube a little amount of hot water: hold your hand so that it is turned around with your finger to such an extent that the edge of the tube is pressed into the root of the clap, and the hot water is found at the bottom: and let stand for a while on the prickling of the hot water.
Then release him, for the wound to be cured with its roots.
So do with them one after another until you have done all that are in the body.
Then take care of them after they have been eradicated, with the same unguent that generates flesh from the wax.
The method for cauterizing in a tremor.
When it happens to someone who has a tremor due to cold in a nerve, or from quartan fever, or otherwise: then you should cauterize the spot four times, or five on top of the spine, and between each vertebrae with cautery, and in the pit of the stomach with cautery, and above the stomach with cautery.
For a tremor ceases when it is oiled with cauterization, and a feverish health is hastened by the health of cold.
The method for cauterizing with Albathir.
Chapter LVII.
When albater are expelled from the body, that is to say, pus that is produced from corrupted coarse material.
Then, when it first appears, it should be cauterized all over the head with fine cautery and a piece of myrrh, whose tip is lit with fire. Or with long roots of aristochnema. Or with a lenticular cautery.
And when they are cauterized with fire, at first during their expulsion in this way: and they do not increase: and they are broken up by the excess, and are healed from them.
However, it should be done after evacuation with phlebotomy.
The method for cauterizing in a flux of blood from an artery in the ulnar:
However, it often happens that a flux of blood comes from an artery that has been cut near the ulnar, whether from outside, or at the site of an abscess, or when cauterizing a member, and similar things: and it is difficult to stop it. Oportet itaque ex parte, ubi accidit, aduersus haec caute
So when this happens to someone, then grasp the affected artery with your hand and place your finger over it as an indicator: and grip it very tightly until the blood is stopped under your finger and nothing comes out of it.
Then put on a small amount of olive oil fire, and a great many more: and blow on them until they are very hot.
Then take from them one, or small, or large, according to the size and place of the broken artery, and place the fire on it: then remove your hand quickly: and hold the fire until the blood is completely stopped.
If you should release your hand from the opening of the artery and put out the fire, then take another fire quickly from those that are prepared in the fire:
So do not stop doing this with one after the other until the blood is completely stopped.
And be careful so that you do not burn the fire that is there, and do not bring on another injury to a healthy person.
And know that when blood flows from an artery, it is then impossible to stop it: especially if the artery is large, unless with four fingers. Or with fire, as we have said. Or with extraction, when it has not been extracted. For when it is extracted, its ends are drawn back, and the blood stops flowing. Or it is bound with a strong knot of thread. Or are placed on the top of a drug that stops the flow of blood and is tightened with a decreasing constriction.
But he who gives the cut with a knot, and constriction with a cloth, or puts burning things together, and similar things, does not give it deeply unless rarely.
But if this happens to someone and there is no present physician or medicine: then begin with the position of the index finger over the opening of the wound, as we have related, and its constriction very tightly until the blood is stopped from the upper part of the wound, and around the artery. And the finger should not be moved away, above it with cold water always stirring the cold, until the blood has congealed, and has thickened, and has been cut off.
And while that is considered, what does not require a poultice or medicine.
On incising, perforating, and draining wounds, and similar matters.
We have already spoken in the first chapter about all illness that is treated with a burning cauterization and medicine, and its causes, instruments, forms of cauterization.
And I placed those chapters from the top to the bottom.
And I will proceed in this chapter in the same way: so that the one who is inquiring may find what he seeks easily.
And before I begin that, you should learn from your son, that horror is in the first chapter about cauterization.
And because of that, it is necessary to be more careful, since there are many things in this operation that cause a tremor and fear, and they lead to death.
And I warn you, do not allow that hesitation to come about, for sometimes those who are in this art of surgery get into a difficult situation with the diseases of people, and that leads to their own death. For some of them become angry with their own illness, and they are easily killed because of the severity of their disease and the length of their suffering. And when ill health comes from fear, which indicates death.
And some of them give you a gift, and they promise you health, but their illness is destructive.
Therefore it is not necessary that you should assent to him who comes to you from them, whose way is such. And be your prudence greater than your cupidity and your avarice. And do not presumptively surmise anything from him, unless after having certain knowledge that confirms it with you as regards the success of what is worthy of praise.
And for the treatment of all your sick patients, with prognosis and indication of that which is appropriate for their recovery.
For in him is an aid to you in acquiring fame and glory, and memory and praise.
May God inspire you, O son, with his understanding and not take away from you his guidance and inspiration: for it is in his power.
And I have ordered this chapter distinguishing it into chapters, according to which precedes in the chapter of Cautery from the crown to the feet: that you may be aided with what you wish from him and for which you are in need.
Of the treatment of water which is added to the heads of boys.
Chapter I.
You should know that this sickness often occurs in boys at birth; or when the midwife squeezes the head of the boy without gentle touch.
And whenever it also happens for an unknown cause which is not known.
And I have not seen this disease in any other than in boys; and I wished to see all of them die, because of that, therefore I have left off the operation on it.
And I have seen a boy from among them, of whom the head was filled with water, and his head increased in size every day, until he could not sit himself up on his own, because of the size of his head: and his moisture increased, until he died.
And this moisture, or it is added between the skin and the jaw: or it is added under the bone over the Mandible.
And the operation in that, if there is humidity between the skin and bone, and the apostema is small, then you should find a fissure in the middle of the head in width; and its length be almost two knots until the humidity has run out.
And this is the form of the scalpel.
But if the humidity is increased and the apostema is larger, then place two fissures according to this form.
But if the humidity is under the bone and the sign of it is that you see the comissures of the head open from all parts: and the water is depressed when you press it with your hand towards the inside, and is not hidden from you: then you should find in the middle of the head three fissures, according to this manner.
And after the incision, remove all the humidity. Then tighten the fissures with rags and flour. Then dip it in vinegar and oil until the fifth day.
Then dissolve the ligaments, and care for the wounded joints with linen, and ointments.
And do not cease to tighten the head with equality. And feed the sick with dry and little-humidity food until their member is comforted, and healed.
And another way of incision is that you consider where the appearance of the size of the apostema and the collection of water appears.
Since when ever it is in the back more, or in the front, or on the right, or on the left.
So climb up with an incision where you see the apostema and the filling appear: and cut it according to what is possible for you.
And observe, so that you do not hit the artery, and does not happen a flow of blood, and the sick dies from that flow with the evacuation of water.
Of the incisions of arteries which are behind the ears.
Head 2.
When there happens to someone a catarrh to the eyes, or to the chest, and it does not improve with medicines: then the last treatment is in that, incision of these two arteries.
So when you want to cut them, let the sick person carry his head. Then cover the place with a sharp cloth so that the arteries appear. Then let the sick person tie his neck with any of his cloths. Then consider where the pulse is beating. And the places are those which are behind the ears: and rarely they are hidden, except in some people.
Then mark with caustic on each: and cut both with a sharp scalpel, cutting towards the mouth: and let it be made through the width of the head.
And if you want, insert the scalpels under the arteries, and cut them from above with a cut.
And let the length of the cut be almost two fingers joined together.
For when the vein is cut, blood flows out with a pulsating movement, which climbs to the inside at an frequent interval.
But if the artery does not appear by touch, then it is necessary that measurements are taken from the color of three fingers. Then mark with caustic and find until you reach the mouth.
And what needs to be emitted from blood, is six minutes and perhaps you emit more or less from it. All this depends on the amount that appears to you from the vein and filling of the artery.
Then consider towards the neck. Then if there is something stuck in the throat, then cut it so that it does not cause a boil to form: and tie the neck with linen thread from a cloth.
Then care for the patient with ointment, until he recovers.
Regarding the extraction of arteries, which are in the temples.
Head
When a man has an old headache, or sharp cataracts because of the acrid and sour liquids, and heat in the temples, or old sodas, stinging, and similar things: and he is treated with the methods of medicine, and does not report it: then we are expert in these diseases, extracting the arteries from the temples, or cauterizing them, as we have described.
And the method of operation in extracting them, is, as the patient has hair on his temples, and it points to an apparent artery in the temple. And himself he shows you from his pulse, and rarely is hidden except in a few men, or when he shudders with cold.
If it is hidden from you, then the patient should tie his head with any cloth: and then he should cover the place with a rough cloth. Or he should moisten the place with warm water, until it appears to you in a manifest way. Then take a spikelet, which has been slightly bent. Then scratch the skin with it easily, until you reach an artery. Then throw it into her and extract it from above, until you draw it out of the skin, and make it ooze with sweat from tunics which are under it on all sides.
If the artery is thin: then wrap it up with the end of the spikelet. Then cut from that part a little more than the length of its ends, and turn them in opposite directions, and do not let there be any flow of blood. For if it does not cut, and if it does not split, the deep blood will not rise.
Then make ooze with blood for six ounces, up to three drops.
If the artery is large: then it should be tied in two places with double thread, strong, from silk: or with string of the hair, so that it does not come under putrefaction before hardening of the wound, and let there be a flow of blood.
Then cut away the superfluity, which is between the two ligaments. Make it do this thing at that hour, or after another hour.
And if there is a wound, cauterize it with the knife until it reaches the mouth, with a surgical knife: until the ends of it stand still in its place.
And this work is better if the patient has no fever, or if his complexion is tepid. For the cautery is from those which remain to finish the wetnesses. Therefore it is better to use a ligature.
And it is necessary after the extraction of the arteries, that the place may be filled with the old cooked substance: and let them be placed on the flesh from afar made pulli.
And after the solution of the ointment with dry medicines which make the flesh grow, and with ligatures, until it is healed.
That if during the operation a flow of blood comes from an artery, then you should proceed to cut it off with the cautery, or to fill the place with a bandage: and hold your hand firm, until the blood is cut off. That if you have nothing present for this, then place your finger on the place, until the blood has congealed. And dip the place in the water of cold frothiness, until the sharpness is calmed down, and hold it firm according to what is necessary.
And from that which is easier and more easily extracted the artery, it is, as if a pin has two points, like an almond; However, there are much less sharpness than two knives. For if they are sharp, like two knives, it is necessary for both to have coldness: and do not cut into the flesh with speed. And when there is a little roughness on them, it is held in them the heat of fire, and the flesh is cut off quickly: and so this work is better on all operations, and lighter and easier.
And this is the form of cauterization.
And set a space which is the quantity of the roughness of the finger between the two knives, after you have marked the two places with the caustic: and put both on well alight, until they come to the nose, and fall into only two places: that it may be stretched out what is between their extremities. For with this cautery, deep parts are not consolidated.
Chapter IV.
On the treatment of acute, chronic, and stinging eye wounds.
When the tears are persistent and there is a course of blood from the veins that run along the outside of the skull: when this does not respond to medical treatment, his eyes will begin to turn red, and he will feel a crawling sensation on his forehead, as if it were caused by ants walking over it; his eyes will become dry and irritated, so they have been corroded by their hair with corrosion; and his eyelids will become heated from the pain of the tears. Then the ancient people used to treat them with this operation, and called it the Ense cure.
And is, as you command, to shave off the hair on the forehead of the sick. Then make three incisions in the forehead that are equally spaced according to its length: and let the length of each incision be almost as long as two fingers, and let one incision be equally distant from the middle of the nose, and the second according to half the distance between the two mandibular teeth, and the third from the side of the second: and pay no attention to the arteries that are on either side: and extend your hand out from the joint of the two jaws, and let the space between each incision be the length of three joined fingers: and have a sponge plug or a dry cloth ready for stopping up the blood.
Then introduce a long sharp instrument into the two ends of the incision, whose end is soon followed by this form: From the incision that is from the temporal side, all the way to the second incision: and scrape with it all the skin that is between the two incisions, along with the waxy membrane that is on top of the bone. Then do this also from the middle incision to the second incision. Then pull out this spoon and introduce into the first incision again a different instrument, which is called a sharp chisel from one side of the lather, not acute from the other side. And this is his form.
And this is his form.
Then place the acute side of him towards the flesh attached with skin, and the soft side towards the bone: and push him, until he reaches the middle crack: and cut off with him
And when an equal quantity of blood runs out, then express the places from the clotted blood.
Then place into every crack a chip of hard-boiled bread, and place on them wet rags soaked in wine, or oil, or vinegar. And check so that the swelling does not become hot.
And on the third day, loosen the ligaments, and give a strong infusion with warm water. Then care for him with basilic ointment, and with the other ointments that heal wounds: until he is healed.
Head
§ On the treatment of acute tears and cataracts in the eyes from within the head.
When acute, sharp, and frequent tears occur in someone's eyes, and their eyes appear weak, pale, and already weakened: and the eyelids become ulcerated, and hair falls out from them, and there is a sharp pain in the deep part of the head, and resulting sneezing: then remove these accidents, so that those materials do not come, unless they are removed with many.
And the best treatment for them is this. And it is as you instruct the sick person to shave his forehead. Then make an incision in the middle of his forehead, or to the right or left of its width, and start from the left-hand side of the temple until it reaches the right-hand side: and push it up to the bone: and extend your hand away from the jaw bones that move during mastication: until it is detected by the bone: and dry out all the blood with a sponge.
Then separate between the two lips of the wound with a hot sponge, or with linen bandages. Then bind above with flannel: and dip the flannel in wine and oil so that a hot pus does not form.
And when you have removed it, and you see that a hot pus is about to appear: then it is necessary that the surgeon should come, until it has begun to grow there.
Then take care of the man with the dry cure that makes the flesh grow: as if you had taken two parts of wheat flour and four parts of colophony: and prepare an ointment from it, and administer it to the birth of meat in these wounds.
Chapter VI.
Regarding the cure that falls on gold.
All that falls on gold is of four kinds: either mineral rock, or similar stones, such as iron and lead; or it is from a plant, such as chickpeas and beans; or it is a fluid, such as water and vinegar, and things like them; or some kind of animal.
When, however, a stone falls on gold, or a kind of rock that does not add to it, and does not grow in gold, expose gold to the sun: but if you see a stone, then distill into gold some of the oil of olive nuts, or sesame seeds. Then administer the extraction, and make it snort with ointment, and paint the nose at the approach of the snorting, after you have put on around the ears rolls of cloth or wool, and extend the ear towards the top.
For often with this cure one goes wrong.
But if he does not go wrong, then administer the extraction with gentle hand, that is, with thin gestures: whose form is this.
But if he goes wrong with his hand, it is good.
And if not, then administer the extraction with a thin, blind hook, made in a few places.
If therefore he does not come out through that [incision], then make a tube of brass, and introduce the end of the tube into the ear hole a lot, and the dust that is around the tube with the softened gold with oil, so that there is no way for the wind except through the tube: then draw it out with your breath strongly.
For many times he went out with it when we told him. But if it does not come out in this way: then take from the alum-pot or from the water, that is, the gluten prepared, with which gold is woven, a little piece: and put it on the end of the ear after you have dried the ear with moisture. Then introduce it into the ear hole easily, after you have removed the wax from the ear.
But if it does not come out with all that we have told you, then prepare yourself to split it, before a hot blister or spasm occurs.
And the way to split it is so that the phlebotomist takes blood from the head first: and draw out the blood according to the measure of its strength. Then make the sick person sit between your hands, and turn his ear towards the top, and find a small hole at the base of his ear next to his fat there: and make the hole round in shape, until you reach a stone: then take it out with that, which is possible for you from instruments.
Then close up the hole from your side with speed, and care for that, until it heals.
That if what falls into the ear is from one grain, which grows, and swells up: then administer its extraction.
But if it does not obey you to come out, then take a thin spike, subtle, according to this shape.
And administer with that from the grain, which falls into the ear, a little spike, according to this shape. And do not consider it, when you think, that this grain is already moistened by the moisture of the ear, until you put it on many thorns: then draw it out with a hook, or with a gentle gesture, or with suction, as we have said, for its extraction alleviates it.
But the water that is poured into the ear should be used by the sick with sternutation first, and also to fill his ear a little cooked old: and lying down on it his ear, where there is water. If so then leave it through that, it is good.
And if not: then take many stones, according to the length of a finger, fine, soft, and heat them slightly with fire, and insert one of them into the ear hole of the sick: and let him sit on one leg from there, and hit it with another stone against the ear bone. So he will not cease to do this with stones and pebbles, until all the water has come out.
And already the water is coming out so that you take it from a torch or from one branch and insert the end of it into the ear: and light the end with fire, until it is burned up completely. Then repeat the branch a few times, until all the water has come out: and take it out with a tube according to what has been said before in the stone.
In extraction however of an animal inside it, if it is a small body, like a flea, and similar to it, take care of it as I have said in the division.
But if it is a large body, which seems to the sense: then administer its extraction with gestures and hooks: and the work of it is easier for all those who hold it in the ear.
But in the extraction of scabs from the ear, when you care for it with what we have said in division and in the book of distillation, and your cure does not bring about this: then it is necessary that you observe the ear in the sun. If so then appears there something like scabs, then extract it with gestures, or with fine hooks.
But if there does not appear anything there, then take a tube whose this form, narrow below, wide above: and insert the end into the ear according to the quantity that the sick can bear it: and then suck with it a strong suction. Here he was quite often, until all the wounds had healed.
But if they do not obey you to go out, then bind around the catheter with plaster, as I said in the stone.
That if they do not go out with him which we have said: then administer the distillations which the ancient ones know about in the infection of wounds: and you will find it in the book on distillations.
And be your pour forth which you pour forth oil and medicines into the ear with this instrument, whose form is depicted here. As you see make it from silver, or from brass, lower part tight, in which sits a small hole, wide upper.
Then sit as if you push forth what is in the constriction of the catheter, sit from brass slightly made. And if you want, take radium, and pour it on the end of the cotton in a gentle boiling: then pour forth oil, or broth, or what you want from these medicines into the catheter: and let it sit in brass: then insert radium with the cotton coming out, and squeeze it forth by your hand gently, until it pushes forth oil in the constriction of the ear, and feels it within: and that which is poured into the ear, may already be warmed a little with fire: and may not be cold so as to distillate it in there: for these medicines do not tolerate it.
Chapter VII.
Regarding the treatment of auricular accidents.
When certain children come out of their mothers' wombs with their ears not pierced.
And it has happened also to some people that they have an auricular ojection from a scar, or from flesh born in it.
And this ojection, when it comes to be in a deep pore of the ear, which does not result from a cut: and when it happens to be on the outside of a pore little, and results from that cut.
That which has happened in a deep pore of the ear, and which does not comprehend in its appearance, is in many dispositions difficult to heal.
And in that which follows the opening of the wound, you should put the gold nurse on the sun, and look at it: if you see the operation apparent, open it with a thin spatula, whose form is this which follows, let the end of it be in a small width, some of it being acute: and let the rest of the spatula be soft on both sides: so that it may not hurt the ear.
If then the operation is from the flesh born in the meatus of the ear: then hold it with a small hook, and cut it with ease of cutting, until all the flesh is taken away.
That if the operation is in the deep of the ear: then take a small ray, soft, and heat it slightly with fire: then put it into the meatus of the ear.
If then you feel the operation with it, that it remains weak with the weight of hearing, be careful in opening it with ease: and with care, so as not to hurt the nerves of the ear.
Then put in the ear a little linen according to the quantity of width of the foramen, which you have inserted into the Egyptian ointment: let it be a few days, until you are sure of the healing of the wound.
Or take linen, and pour into it water rose, and powder over it some fine powder, and use it.
That if you see the ear already separated: then it is necessary that you should take out linen, and let it with other linen which you have inserted into the green which you make with rose oil, until it is healed: then take care of the ear until it is cured.
If then blood flows: then dip a sponge, or cloth, into cold water, and put it on the ear: and use the remaining cure, which stops the predicted flow of blood in the book of distillation.
Of the care of the eyelids.
Head VIII.
These are the signs of Althelil which occur in the eyelids when they are moist and dry.
You should therefore hold them with tenails; or with an anchor, and strike them with a mallet from their roots. Then put on the ground the three-sided piece of wood.
But if blood flows from them, then cauterize them with a fine lenticular cauldron.
And cauterizing them is better after the incision. For many times they run away when something remains of their roots. And when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned and do not run away.
In regard to the care of the eyelids of the eye.
Chapter IX.
This often happens to the eyelids which is a accumulation of moisture which is thick and hard, and for that reason it is called Grando; and it is an aggregation of moistness which is thick on the upper eyelid, and the lower eyelid.
The operation in them is therefore, that you should consider then, if there is Grando proceeding from it, which appears from the eyelid, and moves to all parts, and the thing is easy.
So then put a slit across the width. Then peel off that skin from all parts with ease until it is peeled off. Then hang it on a hook and cut it off.
But if you are not prepared to cut it off, unless after you have made a slight incision in the eyelid, then that will hurt the sick person.
That if the slit is large: then aggregate it with a stitch; and take care of it, until it heals.
And if it is small, you will not have any trouble from it. The unguents restore that skin and make it flesh again.
And if Grando is a discharge towards the inner part of the ear towards the inside surface, then reverse the eyelid and hang up Grando on a hook: except that you should make a slight incision, and press it from all parts.
If the eyelid is made longer by an incision, this does not hurt in any way.
Then, after the incision has been made with a blade, wash the eye with salty water; and take care of the place where it is swollen, until the wound heals.
On the care of the eyelids.
Chapter 10: Head.
Axirnath is a grease that is generated in the eyelids; and it often happens that this affects young people: it damages their eyes, causing them to have cataracts in the morning, and they cannot see the light of the sun, because their tears flow towards them, and for that reason they always rest their faces on their hands, and lie upon them when they sleep, and their eyelids are moist with an inflammation, which has already been caused by the swelling: and the protuberance of Axirnath is apparent to the eye; and when you press the spot with your fingers, you feel Axirnath between them.
And its mode of action is such that he who has the illness places his head in your lap.
Then take a piece of linen cloth, and prepare it with a knot, and make from it a circle which will encompass all the Axirnath. Then put it on that, and press with your fingers from all parts so that the Axirnath is gathered in the middle of the circle.
Then find in the middle of it with a sharp knife an incision that is not larger than a toothpick, and does not extend to the deeper part.
Or you should find the whole skin, so that you reach the Axirnath; for in several positions the Axirnath proceeds from a crack of a second kind, as if by the loss of snow on the white hair.
Then pull it out with the cloth which you have soaked between your fingers towards the outside: and you should move your hand to the right and left until it has spread out; and carefully so that you do not add to the incision with the knife at the eye, and let it go.
If however it does not appear to you at first in the fissure, you add a little to the fissure with ease, until the axil comes out. Then take it out, as we have said.
Then dip the cloth in vinegar and water, and place it on the spot, and squeeze it with flour.
And there are people who grind salt, and put it in the concavity of the wound, so that what remains of the moisture is liquid.
Then take care of it, until it heals.
If however a blister arises in the place, then take care of it with soothed plasters, until it heals.
Regarding the methods of Ataxmir for the eyes: that is, when the eyelid becomes soft to the eye, so that it rubs as it should not.
Chapter XI.
When hairs grow out of the eyelids besides their usual course under the natural lashes, and turn backwards: then they harm the eye, and produce diseases such as constant tears, softening of the eyelids, and cloudiness, until they cause the destruction of the eye.
And Ataxmir treats the eyes according to four methods. Or with a caustic and fire. Or with acute medicines, according to what is set down in the chapter on cautery. Or Ataxmir treats with incision and stitchings. Or with blisters, according to what I say.
It is necessary that you put the head of the patient in your lap. Then take the left hand and turn the eyelid of the eye with your fingers.
If it is turned, it is good. And if it is not turned: push the point into it, where there is a hair from the lower part of the eyelid, and make it penetrate with the wire from above, and let it lie close to the hairs themselves, that is, close to the edge of the eyelid, where the hairs grow out: and pull the wire upwards with the lid, and turn it outwards.
Then find in the inner part of the eyelids under the hairs with the spatula incident from the greater tear up to the smaller tear.
Then remove the filament, and put under the eyelid a thin bit of wool from wool or cloth: then mark on the eyelid with the caustic, which is like the shape of the leaf of mint.
However, it is necessary that it be made according to the amount and height of the eyelid: for this varies from person to person.
From these is one who needs it so that it should strike out from the eyelid a large amount, according to the amount which softens from the eyelid.
Then with the spatula find over the two lines which you marked, and begin from the greater tear up to the smaller tear, and let there be a single crack near the natural hairs, as is the roughness of the radius.
Then introduce the hook into one of two angles of the skin. Then scrape all that. Then collect with a stitch the two lips, with ac and fine wool thread: and wipe away the blood, and let it adhere what is superfluous from the hairs over the two eyelids, with which some things are to be seen, if you wish to do so: and if not, then don't worry.
Then let go of the stitch and the thread up to three or four days: then take care of that.
And if you wish, let go of the knot without a stitch, and take care of itself with it, which dries up and tightens. For the eyelid becomes detached at the seal of the wound and aggregation of it: but the future is better.
This way of treating has been taught by the ancient Ataxmir.
However, there is concern over the weak one, and it is from a good operation, and it is not in it any fear.
And another method is also with Ataxmir: and that is, as the signs on the eyelid are made like the shape of the leaf of mint, which we have described.
Then clean the eyelids with three separate hooks, or gathered together, according to this form which follows; then cut what is superfluous with small scissors, according to this form, with equality of the incision.
But if you are not able to hold the hook, and it does not match: then take an acumen where the hair is, and insert it in the middle of the form: and introduce another hair near the larger tear, and a second hair near the smaller tear: and gather the hairs between your fingers with equality.
Then clean your hand with equal cleaning: and clean the skin above where the mark of the knot is, as we have said.
Then gather together the two lips of the wound with a stitch: and care for it, until it heals.
But if there is an abscess by your incision, or a hole: but this abscess with caustics, and those similar, from a wax sitting.
And when the eyelids also happen, so that his hair turns.
Therefore it is necessary that you use in this what we have said in the incision: but the stitch on both sides is more artificial. Of the care of Ataxmir with the scissors.
AND It is, so that you turn the eyelid, and cut the hole which is within, according to what we have told. Then with art make two scissors, or two thin sticks: whose length is according to the length of the eyelid, and their width is less than the width of a hair: and you have already incised at the ends of each side where you hold the hairs.
Then gather each with subtlety above what is superfluous from the eyelid of the eye, and tightly tighten the two scissors from both sides, and let it go after a few days. For the skin is tight to kill, and will be covered with rust, and will rot, until it falls by itself.
But if it delays, then cut it with scissors. Then care for her, until she recovers.
When therefore she is healed, take away the plaster; and do not prick the cicatrice with a pin.
And this is the form of two cans, which you shall make according to this figure, and their quantity in length and breadth.
Chapter XII.
De the creation of two canisters for puncturing the eye with an aiguille.
The operation in that case is, that you should take an aiguille sharp, and stick it into the eye with a thread of silk. Then bind the ends together, and tie each with a small knot; and make the length of the threads be half an inch.
Then take another thin thread and put it under the first bandage, and tie the ends together if you wish to.
Then place the sick person's head in your lap, and hold it near the light that the operation may be seen; for it is a delicate operation, or a minute one.
Then stick the aiguille with the bandage into the root of the eyelid, and let it penetrate quickly into the eyelid, until you draw out a natural pimple.
Then pull the pimple up above the bandage: and stick it into the bandage; if it is one, or two, or three, not more.
Then take your hand with it, until the pimple and the bandage go out of the eyelid with a natural pimple.
If however the bandage is pulled out, and does not come out with it: take the bandage from below, with the thread which you have put into it, until you draw out the bandage from the upper aperture, and cover the eye; then take both of them away, and close the eye; and let him be closed for two days, or three, until the pimple adheres to its place, and grows on the flesh.
If however the pimple is short, then either join it with a long natural pimple, and take it away with it; or dismiss him, until he grows longer in space, and then stick him.
Chapter XIII. On the treatment of a wound on the upper
When it affects the eye, this is called Leporine.
And this Al-Xatrati is either natural or accidental.
So the accidental one is caused by the consolidation of a wound, or a section, or a cauterization, and similar things.
And the mode of operation in it is such that you find her consolidation, and so that you separate her lips, and put into it what is between them from a linen cloth, and bind her, until she heal.
And it is not necessary, that you use in her cure the things which dry and tighten: for if you do so, Al-Xatrati will be worse than it was: but you should use in her cure the things which soften, such as fenugreek: and dip with it into water, in which has been boiled aloe, linseed: and apply with it an unguent, which melts when mixed with some oils: and wrap it up with the linen, and apply the unguent with it.
And the treasure of your cure is such that you may keep all art, so that she does not consolidate, according to the form which it had in the beginning.
And this operation which we have described, is but a certain correction of Al-Xatrati, so that the form of the place may not be completely changed, altogether.
On the treatment of Al-Xatrati when it affects the lower eyelid, and is a wrinkling or contraction upward toward the right or left.
Chapter XVIII. On the treatment of Al-Xatrati when it
This Al-Xatrati which affects below is what is called Al-Xatrati. And it is either natural or accidental.
And the accidental one is caused by a wound, or a nick, or a cauterization, and similar things.
And the mode of operation in it is such that you take up the akh (a substance used in medicine), in which there is a double thread, and dip it into flesh, and let it penetrate from the left tear gland to the right tear gland, until the thread reaches both extremities of the flesh.
Then extend the flesh to the upper parts with an awl, and cut it with a chisel. If, then, the figure returns to the eyelid according to what is necessary, it is good.
And if not, take the ray, and put it in the notch, and turn it with it the eyelid: and find two notches in the inner side between the eyelids, and are the ends of the two notches from two angles of incision until they meet and make the figure this figure, and it is a Greek letter.
Then remove that flesh by quantity, which is the acute lower side of it, from him who follows the eyelid. Then gather together the separated parts: sew them with a wool thread.
Then care for them with what I have said, about medicated salves, and liniments, until they are healed.
And if an alien body comes out of the notch, and sewing, or cauterizing: then you should find a flat notch under the eyelids' hairs, also according to what has preceded. Then separate between the two lips with a liniment, according to what I have said.
And the whole speech about the cure of an alien body, when it is on top, or below, it is, that it runs in this operation, according to what is prepared from the form of Al-Xatrati.
For it is itself a multitude of different forms: and the prudent artisan prepares the mind with whatever way is possible for him, until he makes the figure return to its natural form, or close to it, and himself becomes infirm, according to what suits him, from operation and instruments in many dispositions.
Chapter XV
Regarding the adhesion of the eyelid of the eye with the conjunctiva, or cornea.
When this consolidation happens to many people, so that the upper eyelid is consolidated with the white of the eye, and prevents itself from its natural operations.
Therefore, it is necessary that you introduce the radius end under the eyelid and lift it up; or extend it with a hook: then cut the adhesion with a fine blade, which should not be too sharp, but rather a little blunt: so that the sick person does not disturb during the operation, and does not move the blade, and does not hurt his eye with its sharpness: and your incision should be as you remove this adhesion easily, until when the eyelid returns to its natural form, and heals all the adhesion.
Then, at that time, pour into the eye salty water to wash it, with water Ablute him: or distill in him from a mixture of distilled water and dissolved zinc:
Then, after a day, use a thread to separate the eyelid from the eye: and place on the eye wool dipped in Albughine: and after three days use a blade, and with solids, until it heals.
Regarding the incision of the nail and the eminence of the flesh of tears.
Chapter XVI.
You know that the nail is according to two ways. Or it is nervous: and it is similar to a soft, thin wood. Or it is not nervous, similar to frozen moisture as snow: which when it touches metal, iron, or tin takes it with a hook, and does not stick to it.
And both kinds do not begin, unless from the greater tear, until it is slowly discharged, until it dries up, and prevents the light, and the movement of the eye.
And the method of working on his incision is: so that the sick person puts his head in your lap. Then open his eyes and lift his eyelids with your hand. Then take the nail with a little hook, and extend it upwards. Then take a sharp needle, and insert it into the nail with a horsehair thread, or a hook: and make the thread strong, and double the end of the needle slightly, and fix it in the middle of the nail: and pierce it with a pin, and tie the nail to the thread, and extend it upwards: and cut it with a sharp blade, and remove it from the nail, and extend it again upwards: and scrape it with the hair of the nail that follows the pupil, as if you were holding it with a hair until its tip.
Then cut the residue on the lacrimal root with a fine scalpel, or with small forceps; and release the natural flesh of the lacrimal so that its course of tears is not interrupted by the incision.
And when ever the nail extends itself in the sole with a hook: or with a thread, as we have said. Then scrape it with a soft scalpel, whose shape is like this.
And be careful not to touch the horny tunic with the scraper, lest it cause a break, and pierce the pupil.
Then, after the incision, pour into the eye some crushed salt, or make a paste of zinc, and leave it until another day. Then take care of the eye with whatever is necessary, until it heals.
If the nail is not nervuous, and you cannot get into it, nor does the hook hurt it, then often cure this nail condition with medicines, and it heals as well as that in the division.
If you need to cut it, then open the eye for nursing, and take a fine scalpel, gentle of sharpness, according to this form. And scrape the nail from above with subtlety. If you see that it is getting thinner and drying up, and the rasion becomes imprinted in it, then distil from your own blood into the eye, made of zinc paste, or of red ochre, or of fine salt: and pamper the eye until another day.
Then repeat this operation on it again, until it is completely removed. Unless you have a warm apostema in the eye: for then let go of it, and take care of the apostema until it heals.
Then repeat the operation on the nail with the rasp, until it heals.
Except that the flesh of the lacrimal, if it hurts greatly in the eye, be suspended with a hook, and cut off from it: and do not make the last incision, lest the course of tears be interrupted.
Then pour the eye-wash into the tear-vessels with red rub, or made from za'atar, until it heals.
In regard to the incision and the flesh that has come out of the eye.
Chapter XVII
This flesh sometimes becomes attached to the eye of some men, mixed with red color or laid on top of it, until it covers the pupil, or approaches it, or presses against the eyelids, and perhaps turns the eyelids outward; and is absorbed into the rose-colored cheeks.
And the operation on it is also that he who is lame should put his head in your lap. Then open his eyes and pluck out all the flesh with a suitable hook; and hold it with a forceps, or grasp it.
Then make the incision on the flesh first, until you have cut off all of it with the scalpel. And keep away from the eye so that you do not wound it during the operation: and let your incision be where you incise, or with a scalpel, which we have mentioned in the incision of the nail: or with small forceps, with which Așbel is caught, according to what its form will be after this chapter.
When your incision is complete and all the algardenium has been removed, then fill the eye with ground salt: or distil into it red powder, and similar medicines that are corrossives: and put on top of the eye a cotton wool with alumen, so that it is protected from the burning heat.
If there remains any algardenium, and hot blood reigns over you, and you are worried about the heat of the aposteme; then let go of the eye, and take care of it with him when he sits down.
Then repeat the operation on the flesh again, until it heals.
And do likewise with the meat that has come out of the eye from this kind.
However, it is necessary that you keep away from natural or accidental causes of eye disease, operating with iron: and do not put your hand into any of these operations, until you are certain, for that member is able to bear that operation.
About collecting sevel from the eye.
Chapter XVIII.
Of sevel that are small red sores that grow on the eye, and that prevent vision; and also weaken the eye with the passage of time.
It is therefore necessary for you to consider, first of all, whether the eye in which there is sevel is strong and has no other disease except the sevel; then collect the sevel from it.
And if you command the sick person to place his head in your lap.
Then hang the sores by one or two hooks according to your skill: and let the hook be thin, double-shaped, or there may be two hooks on a single bar, according to this form.
Then take with delicate hooks the sores with carefulness, and wipe away the blood hour after hour, until you see the sore spots coming out of the eye and healing up; and do not touch the eyes with your fingertips.
And let your surgery take place in the middle of the day, and be very firm in your surgery: so that you do not fall except for the sores.
And when you have cleaned it out, then pour into the eye a little saffron liquid or a little red liquid; so that its own acuity may corrode what is left of the sevel.
But if you are not able to collect all of it in that hour, then plug the eye with something that soothes its pain; and let it rest for a few days, until the pain subsides: and protect it from the heat of the sun: and then repeat the same operation on it again according to this method, until it heals.
This is the form of the hook.
Chapter XVIII.
Of reducing ari-sat to the nose.
They named the medical instrument a fistula, which is used with caustic or acute fire according to what came before in its account.
And if you do not heal it, then there is no skill in it: unless you discover a pimple at the time of its birth and drain all the moisture that is in it and the pus, until the bone is detected.
And when the bone is detected, and you see corruption or discoloration in it, then scrape it out with this instrument, whose shape is like this.
And it is called the chisel of the head.
Let it be made of iron and let the head be round like a chisel, which is marked with the file or with fine sand: and place the instrument on the corrupted place of the bone.
Then turn the instrument between your fingers and press your hand lightly, until you know that that corruption has now been shaved: and do it sometimes.
Then restore the place with dry leeching.
If then the place is healed, and a bone grows up in it, and the wound heals over: and remains forty days, and does not break again, and does not get infected, then you shall know that it has now been healed.
And if not, then there is no skill in it, unless a tube is reduced to the nostril, according to this form.
And it is so that you may extract the second bone with iron, or with sharp medicine: and when the bone has been detected, then take a chisel according to this form, whose end is metal, triangular: and let the wood of it extend to an edge like a pyramid, as you see.
Then put it on the bone itself: and let it be near the tear: and extend your hand from the eye a little way.And when tu sentias in oculo, et vidisti strabismus, et non ponit caput tuum secundum naturalem locum suum: tunc scias quae ueneat cor Then feel with your hand if you can feel the eye, and see if it is strabismus, and does not put your head into its natural place: then you shall know that the disease is coming out of it, whenever it feels weak.And then turn your hand with the chisel, until it enters the bone, and feels sick: by this means let it be known that the disease is leaving it, whenever it holds its hand over its nose.
Therefore then restore the place with stictical medicines that are drying out, as I have taught you.
When the flesh is then born and the place hardens: then the substance that flows out to the outside returns to the nose: so it is lighter on the sick.
On the reduction of vision.
Chapter 20.
When the eye shoots out with all its power and does not cause damage or loss of vision, then it is necessary to let go of the sick person: then let him bleed; afterwards put vents on the scalp without scarification but with suction.
Then put on the eye a liniment that is made of Acacia, and Aloes, and Olibanum, and Sarcocolla. Then tighten the eye from above over a plaster with many powders.
And the mode of the powders is this: that you take soft cloths, many and double all the cloths out of them on four sides: make out of them a lot: then put them one over another according to the amount which the eye needs: then tighten them strongly with a hard cloth.
And repeatedly apply vents without scarification.
Then remove the vents and let go of the tightened eye during the day and night.
If, however, the ligament again softens, then it is necessary to tighten it a lot: then remove the ligament after day and night, as we have said.
If the eye then is already clean with new wounds of the ligature, it is good: and if not, then repeatedly apply vents, and tightness, and vents, until the healing.
On the incision of the ligament.
Chapter 21.
When the break-out occurs in the Veal ligament, then it shoots out and proceeds outside the eyelids like a grain of corn, and moves in the form of a man because of it, and the eye incises it: then the operation on it is this: and it is as if you were to insert an acorn in the root of the Veal from below to above.
Then introduce another instrument into the space between the lacrimal and nasal bones, and let it penetrate: and then remove the first one according to its position.
Then cut a space with a double-bladed knife, and fasten one end to the area around the nose with a ligature: and tighten it very much.
Then remove it now, and place a woollen thread soaked in white of egg on the eyeball: and let go of it until the thread falls with the lacrimal filament.
Then care for the eye with it, that it may comfort itself, until the wound heals.
And when the thread is tightened around the entire area with a circle of cloth, until the eye has developed great prominence.
Then pierce it with a thin spatulum, which reaches to the depth of the eye, and let moisture from the white of egg flow in, and let the eye fall down, and immediately put it back in: then tighten it until it heals.
§ On the Cure of Alconey.
CHAPTER XXII.
This condition called Alconey, is not anything but the white accumulating in the eye, similar to water dropping down, and it itself is not.
And the method of treatment for it is, that you should make the sick person sit on a prepared bench, or directly.
Then take his head in your hands from both sides, and gently move it, until you feel the white moving to the lower part of his eyes. Then bind it, and let it not fall down, and make the light complete: and the sick person shall see as he used to; and if it does not fall down below, you shall know that it is water.
If, however, the descent of the white with it has not been prepared as we have said, then make the sick person sit between your hands. Then take a thin spatulum, and find it with him slightly above the connection of the corium with the corneal layer in the crown, until the white comes out.
So then when you have walked out, then distill into the eye hot water in which you mixed honey: or water in which you have already boiled fenugreek and honey; and then treat with the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
On the treatment of water that has entered the eye, or a cascade.
Chapter XXIII On the Treatment of Water That Has Entered the Eye
I have already spoken on the species of water, which are divided, and which suit the diagnosis and explanation, then take that same one according to the cure.
Then you should make the patient sit with his two hands between himself and the light, near the sun: and bind his healthy eye, and tighten it: then you can blink his eye with your right hand, if the water has entered his left eye: or with your left hand, if it is his right eye.
Then take alum with your right hand, if the eye is on the left: or with your left hand, if it is on the right.
Then put the end of the alum towards the crown by the thickness of the radius in the white of the eye which appears to be the tear: then push the alum with force: and you can turn your hand while doing so, until it penetrates into the socket of the eye: and you will feel that the alum has already reached the dry spot.
And it should be such a measure of distance for the alum to the depth, which is the space between the pupil and the end of the blackness: and that is the crown of the eye. You will see it in the same pupil with a red eye, on account of the clarity of the cornea.
Then put the alum until you reach the place where the water is. Then press it down with a gentle force.
But if the water has already descended, then the sick person will see it right away, and the alum in his own eye immediately.
Then rest a little. If water has fallen, then deposit it second, except for what has exited as almonds.
When, however, it is formed and does not rise up: then extract the Almonds with ease: and you shall move your hand gradually.
Then dissolve in water a little of the clear salt of the gem: and wash with it the inner eye. Then put on the whole eye a drop, or a wool dipped in rose-oil, and white of egg: and bind it with it the healthy eye.
But we, and those who are our companions at this time, put on him powdered cumin, mixed with white of egg.
That if the Almond does not obey you at the entrance to the eye through its durezza, since it is from a man, whose eye is very hard: then you should take the spikelet which is called Alberid, whose this form.
Open it then with him only the conjunction so much, and not the last your hand in the hole: and is there only to do you make a small space for the Almond.
Then introduce the Almond, according to what we have said above.
And at the completion of your work, let be prepared for the sick an uneven-made bed, in which he may sleep on his back in a dark house: and let be forbidden from all movements, and from coughing: and place before him food by which nature heals him: and let not move his head to the right, or at all to the left.
And let sit the ligature according to its position until the third day.
Then dissolve it in that dark house, and test his vision: and let him see objects. Then reduce the ligature until the seventh day.
But it is not necessary that he do this at the time of healing, or immediately after the incision: but rather, let him keep it away: because water rises quickly through a steep aspect.
If, however, the apoplexy is hot: then it is necessary that you release the eye before the seventh; and correct it with that which is settled when the apoplexy is settled: then absolve his sight, and put over his face the oral part in which the sight of him under lies for a few days, while he remains in that dark house.
Then let him leave the house gradually, and turn round in his seats.
And know that the student is not excused from sight sometimes in the zalah: then let him dare to look at the operation.
And indeed one of those who are from Al-Ayrah has already come to us; he said that it was done in Al-Ayrah a hole made with the magdan by which water is sucked up.
But verily you will not see anyone on earth who did that: and it is not written about him in any of the old books: and it is possible that it should be new.
And these are the forms of the eyes from the magdan, so that they stand on her who does not know them.
Let them be made of pure brass: and let their ends be with this same subtle triangular shape, and the acute end.
Head 24th.
Regarding the care of a birthmark on the nose.
When and what different meats are added to the nose, from which there is something that resembles a scorpion of many feet: and from it is that cancerous meat, stone-like in colour, which is soft; and from it is that flesh which is soft, not stone-like in colour.
In that which of these meats is soft, not deceitful, and not cancerous, you should make it sit between your hands opposite the sun, and open its nostrils, and throw in a hook made of thin sharp iron from one side; then pull it out to the outside, and cut off what you have caught with it by means of a fine sharp chisel: then draw it towards you, and see if all the meat has gone.
If anything remains that cannot be cut off: then cut it with a slender instrument easily, until nothing remains of it. But if blood rules over you, or a fever occurs: then oppose it with that which is necessary; or if it is a malignant abscess, then approach it by cauterizing it, until the blood is cut off and all the flesh is taken away.
Then let it be poured into the nose after an incision with vinegar, and water, or wine. But if the nose is opened, and moisture proceeds from it to the palate, then you should know that he is already well.
But if the moisture does not penetrate as it should, then you should know that within himself there is a birth in the upper bones of the nose, to which the knife does not reach with the incision.
Then it is necessary that you introduce a thread of linen, of which there is some grossness, and spots in it many: and place between each spot the amount of a finger, or less: and he will be relieved, so that he lets one end of the thread into his nose with a ray, or with whatever is possible for him after he has done himself similar azur: and he should carry his odor, until it reaches as far as his throat, and he should come out onto his throat.
And often indeed do this boys like this in school: and it is a simple thing for him who wants to.
Then place the two ends of the thread, the end that comes out onto the nose, and the other that remains in the nose. Then also close the opening of the skin with the thread. Let him be until you know that the flesh is already there with the spots on the thread.
Then pull out the thread: and put into the nose after drying up of the blood a liquid that you soaked in Egyptian ointment: let him be for three days, or more, until the ointment eats away all that remains of the flesh.
Then put in the end of the nose a canula of lead, for several days until it heals.
If it needs more cure than to dry it up, use that.
For making the lavage, when it is distilled with oil and other medicines to the nose, make it of silver or brass: that it be like a little lamp, open-ended like a seashell: and its bore also.
And if you want to make a closed canula, like a reed.
And the shell of the instrument for making the lavage be full, fixed: which has a handle at the end, so that you hold it when you heat it with oil, or what you want to use and liquid things.
Head 25.
The Thelul of the nose often begins at the end and grows larger, and increases in appearance over several days until it appears like a festering wound.
And because of that, you should cut off all of its growth at the beginning of its appearance, and scrape it out completely. Then put over the place, or cautery, or burning medicine that stays in its place.
If the cutting then lags behind until it grows larger, then examine it, if it is hard and has a dull color and few senses: then do not touch it with iron: because it is a cancerous growth.
For often the eye that has cut into a person's head develops a large, evil growth on top of it from which bad things arise.
And if the growth is soft to the touch and not dull in color, and you see that the cutting may have reached its whole extent, then wash it with water that is cool and cut the person without fear or trepidation: and heal the place along with it by drying it up and constricting it, until it heals over.
Head and neck.
On sewing up the nose, mouth, and ears.
For when a break in the continuity of one of these cartilage pieces occurs, little operation is effective on it, except in some men.
It is necessary, therefore, when it has happened to anyone of these things, as you should consider if the bone is recent with its blood: and then gather the pain of the wound with a suture: then take care of it, until it heals.
And if the continuity of the solution has already separated the lips, and some healthy part has been made: then it is necessary that you remove all of its own skin, until it bleeds. Then gather the two lips with a suture, and tie them tightly, and powder them over the wound with dragon's blood, and olive oil, ground: and put over the powders a fragment of a plaster of diafinicon, and some other of a consolidated plaster: and leave it tied for two days, or three. Then dissolve it, and change the medicine: and leave it, until the threads separate by themselves. Then take care of the wound with ointment, until it heals.
But the method of the suture is, to gather the solution of continuity, or with the knuckles, as we have told you about the suture of the foot: or to gather the solution with a thread, as I have made you aware.
Head and neck.
The extraction of nodules from the lips.
In fact, it happens to many men, and especially in the inner lips there are similar hard little lumps of herbs: and some smaller, and some larger.
Therefore it is necessary that you open the lips, and find out on every lump, and hang it up with a hook, and drop it from all sides.
Then fill the place after cutting dry, ground, until the blood dries.
Then clean it with vinegar, and take care of the place with it, where there is a stinging sensation, until the wounds heal.
De incisione carnis natae super gingiuam.
Of the incision of flesh that has grown on the gums.
Often a sore grows on the gums, which the ancients called abluss.
It is necessary that you should hang it by a hook: or hold it with tongs and cut it close to its root, and allow the wound to discharge its pus or blood.
Then put on a place of poultice of ground pepper, or other astringent powders, drying agents.
That if that sore returns after treatment, for often it does return, then cut it again and causticate it: for this does not return after the cauterisation.
De rasione dentium cum ferro.
As regards shaving the teeth with iron.
When they have gathered on the surface of the teeth from within and from outside, and between the gums are rough, knots, and sometimes corroding them, and becoming yellow, and white, until the corruption reaches the gums, and the teeth are decayed by it.
It is necessary that you should put the sick person between your hands, and his head in your lap, and shave off the rotten molars and teeth on which you see the gums, and similar ground powder: until there remains nothing of it, and likewise do with the blackness, rustiness, yellowness, and other discolourations, until they are cleansed.
If then what is removed from them at the beginning of the shaving is good: and if not, then repeat the shaving another day, and a third time, until you have come to the last study in it that you wish.
And know that the teeth respond to various shapes of blades: and also, as regards preparing your operation, this blade with which you cut from below is different from the blade which cuts between the teeth, according to their shapes.
And these forms of blades are prepared for you, which you will see.
Chapter 30.
On the extraction of toothache.
It is necessary that he who seeks to extract a tooth should be very careful and diligent in its extraction and late in its eradication. For the tooth cannot be made to yield when it is eradicated: since the substance is soft; until, indeed, there is no excuse for its eradication, then let him who seeks to extract a tooth when he is ill consider eradicating it so that it hardens, and certify with you, the toothache.
Often the illness deceives the sick person and he supposes that the pain is in the tooth and eradicates it himself: then the pain does not retreat until the tooth is eradicated.
For we have already seen from the operation of bleeding.
Then, when the toothache is certified with you, let him who seeks to extract it scrape around the tooth with a file, in which there is some virtue, until it has healed the gum entirely: then, with your fingers or with delicate forceps little by little, until you have struck it.
Then, when the place is good and you have located it well, and your head is between your knees, which you hold firmly so that it does not move: then, with a firm grip, draw out the tooth according to its straight line, so as not to break it.
If then it does not come out, then take one of these instruments and push it under it from all sides with ease, and try to move it, as you did at first.
If then the tooth is pierced or corroded: then it is necessary to fill the cavity with cloth: and you should hold it tight with a narrow forceps so that it does not break at the time of your constriction on it with the forceps.
And it is necessary, that you should carefully examine with scraping around the gum entirely.
And keep your strength, so that you do not break it and a part of it remains, and returns to the sick one from that evil which causes him greater pain first.
And for that reason, do not do what the phlebotomators do when they are in a hurry and their boldness overcomes them in eradicating it, except that they administer it which we have said.
For this reason, repeatedly they bring about great illnesses in men, which are more difficult to break than to heal and leave all the roots of it or some of its parts; or take it out with some of the bones of the jaw: as we have been told many times that thing.
Then they wash it after eradicating it with wine, or with vinegar and salt.
That if it should happen that the flow of blood comes from the places (for it often happens) then dry up a little of the wound, and fill it with it: and if not, cauterize it, if it does not give you any relief.
The shapes of the forceps which move with subtlety in the first place are long at their ends, short in the handle, thick so that they do not double when pressed against the tooth: they are like the thick handles which you see, until when you press them together they do not bite into themselves, nor double; and the shorter ends, and they are made of iron ingot or a twisted bar of iron, straightened out: and in their ends there are teeth, some of which enter into some things, and by constricting them tightly, they hold fast with force.
And when the ends become like the shape of an ear which is called a ciconia, and are strong constriction:
Chapter 31.
of the eradication of teeth and extraction of fractures of the mandible bones.
When a tooth that is broken remains after eradication, then you should place it on the cot with butter for one or two days, until it softens: and then introduce into it the gouge or the forceps; whose ends are like an ear which is called a ciconia. The shape of this forceps is.
Make the ends smooth like a file: or like an awl.
But if he does not yield to you at the exit with these pincers, then you should cut off the root, and peel off all the flesh, and insert the instrument which is called a small palanquin, whose shape is this.
The short end should be slightly thicker; and it should not be wet, lest it break.
But if the root comes out by means of that, it is good; and if not, you should help with these other instruments whose shapes are these.
The shape of the first triangular end, in which there is some thickness.
The shape of the second triangular end, which is thinner.
And with the other instruments and tools which have gone before in the description of the teeth.
Also help with this instrument which is like a large hook, of the shape of the second triangular end, twisted, in which there is some thickness so that it does not break; and let it not be wet.
And know that there are many instruments for the teeth; and likewise the other instruments do not count; and the prudent artisan finds out by himself the instrument, according to which it is necessary for him to operate and to cure his own ailments.
For from the diseases of the teeth, there are instruments which the ancient ones did not describe, because of the diversity of their forms.
But if the jaw is broken by the molar, or by any other bone of the mouth, then examine it carefully in its place with what belongs to it from the instruments and pincers which I have described for extracting the root, and help with these gestures, whose shape is this.
Let it be slightly thicker so that it holds together, or let it be held with the jaw, and do not let it move or vibrate until the jaw comes out; and restore its place with the suitable medicines for it.
If there is putrid pus in bone then scrape it off and cure it until sound.
Of the dismembering of a tooth from the jaw-bone.
On the removal of the teeth from the jaw-bone.
When teeth become dislocated from their natural course, they get foul through the shape of the jaw, especially when it happens to women and girls, that is to say, young.
It is necessary for you to consider. For if one tooth has come after another, and does not fit into its place, or is possible to open it with a file, then scrape it out: and if it is joined with another tooth, then cut it out with this instrument, of which the following is the form.
It is like a little chisel, made of iron, with a sharp end.
And your cut should be deep so that it can go through the bone, and for the hardness of the tooth, and so that another tooth does not move.
If it is exposed by the wear of its own file: then scrape it with a file made of iron, of which the following is the form.
It should all be made of iron, and its little end pointed with the point of an awl, like a file with which nails are made: and with this the tooth is scraped little by little over several days with ease, so that another tooth does not move, and it falls off: then it is to be smoothed, in the end, scraped with some rasps.
If it is a tooth that breaks off a piece and hurts the tongue: then you must also smooth out this piece, until its roughness has gone, and make it even: and it should be smoothed, so as not to hurt the tongue, or damage the speech.
Chapter 33: Of the extraction of teeth when they are decay
Of the retaining of teeth when they are decayed with gold.
When the anterior teeth have a shock or movement by reason of a blow, or accident: and cannot hold firm on them, and they do not taste good after the use of medicines for their relief, then it is clever in them to fasten them with gold wire: because silver becomes yellow, and decayed after a few days: but gold does not change.
And let there be a thread medium in fineness and coarseness according to the quantity that it takes between teeth.
And the shape of the retention is so that you take the thread and insert it twice its length between two healthy teeth: then you knit it with its two extremities in a thread between the teeth of both parts until you reach the other healthy tooth. Then repeat the texture until you reach the side from which you began: and tightly with subtlety and wisdom, until it does not move completely: and let your constriction be where you tighten the thread, near the roots of the teeth, so that it does not move.
Then cut off the excess ends of the thread with the pincer: and gather both sides, and turn them towards each other: and hide them between the healthy tooth and the moted one so that they do not hurt the tongue: then let it be loosened in such a way that there is left only a small amount.
If however it loosens or cuts, tighten them with another thread and let it stand with it in such a way for a whole time.
And this is the form of the teeth, and the shape of the retention of two healthy teeth and two moted teeth as you see them.
And sometimes, when one tooth falls and heals again in its place, and the retainers remain as we have described, and do not hurt it - this is done only by a skilled, prudent, and experienced artisan.
And sometimes a bone is broken by a jab: and it is made like the form of a tooth, and put in place, from which it is protected and tightened, as we have said: and remains, and stays with it for a long time.
Head 34.
Sometimes this ligament that happens under the tongue is either natural with which man is born, or accidental due to an arrow that has already healed.
And the operation is, so that you open the mouth of the patient on his head in your bosom, and relieve his tongue: then cut this neural ligament across its width, until the tongue is released from its retention.
If there is something hard and rigid in it and it is a result of injury and the wound is healed: then insert a hook into it and cut across its width until you reach the ligament, and release the rigidity.
And do not make a cut at the bottom of the flesh, and do not cut an artery there, and do not cause blood to flow.
Then wash the incision with pink water or vinegar or cold water.
Then place under the tongue a lymph from linen, which holds the sick one every night: so that it does not become consolidated again.
But if there is blood flow, then place on the spot a lump of dried clay. But if you are pricked by blood, then cauterize the spot with a burning coals, which suits it: then take care of yourself with the rest of the cure, until it heals.
Head XXXV
When a little pustule forms under the tongue that absorbs the small wound, preventing the tongue from its natural function: and perhaps it increases so much, until the bone is filled up.
And the operation is, to open the jaw without pain by the sun: and consider the pustule.
But if you see that the color of it is dark or black, and hard, and the sick person does not have a feeling: then do not touch it, for it is cancer.
And if it declines to whiteness, in which there is moisture, then insert into it a hook, and cut it with a very fine scalpel, and free it from all parts. If you are pricked by blood during your operation, then place on the spot a lump of dried clay, until the blood stops: and then resume your operation, taking off the skin with its appendages.
Then wash with vinegar and salt: and care for that wound with suitable cure until it heals.
¶ On the treatment of abscesses of the two amygdaloids.
Chapter 36. On the treatment of abscesses of the two
When abscesses occur between the tonsils, that is, glands which resemble abscesses and occur in the jaw: they are called the two amygdaloids; when treated as described in the division, and yet do not heal, then consider.
If then there is an abscess that is hard, of a pale colour, with little sensation: then do not touch the abscess with iron.
And if it is of a red colour, and the root is thick: then do not touch it with iron, fearing that there will be a flow of blood; but leave it, until it has grown dry. And then either you pierce it: or it will burst of itself.
And if it is of a white colour, round, and its root is thin: then the wound should be allowed to bleed.
And the operation on it is such, that you should consider before the operation itself, if its abscess is hot, and has become quiet and complete, or is somehow imminent: then therefore make the person sit in front of the sun, and place his head in your lap: and open the mouth, and let him take hold of the tongue from below with an instrument, which has this form.
Let it be made of silver, or of brass, that it is fine like a knife.
When then you press with it on the tongue, and it shows itself to you, falling on your side: then take a hook, and fasten it in the amygdaloid, and pull it out as far as you can, pulling off some of the skin with it.
Then cut it with an instrument, which has this form following. It is joined with ligatures: however, its ends are curled up, so that the opening of each of them is on the acute side of the other: wherefore it should be so made of iron, or of a felled skin, that it may absorb.
If it is not present this instrument, then cut it with a chisel, whose this is the shape. Let it be sharp on one part, not sharp on the other.
And having cut one side of the amigdalon, cut the other second to this same form of incision.
Then after the incision gargle the sick with cold water, or with vinegar and water.
But if it happens that there is a flow of blood, gargle with water in which the skins of apples are boiled: or leaves of myrtle, and such like from stypics, until the flow of blood has stopped: then take care of the wound, until it heals.
And when ever there arise in the throat lumps, except two amigdalons. Then cut them as I said above for the cutting of the two amigdalons.
And I too have already treated a woman from an apostematous lump that was born between her throat and which she would put out into froth, little feeling, which had almost closed up her throat: and the woman breathed through my mouth, and had stopped eating, drinking water, and had come close to death, if it had remained one day, or two days.
And the lump had risen so much that it had thrown up two sprigs, until they had come out at two holes in the nose.
So I ran faster, and fixed my hook into one of them. Then I pulled it out, and a big piece came out with it.
Then I cut it off where it was caught in the hole of the nose.
Then I made it come out of the other hole of the nose.
Then I opened her mouth, and pressed her tongue: and then I fixed my hook into it: then cut off a part of it, and there was not much blood coming out: so the woman's throat is entirely stopped, and she began to drink water right away, and then took food to eat.
Therefore I have ceased to strike at that place for a long time; and the scar which I struck has given way to another, until it was too late and was joined to that one.
I therefore used cautery on the scar between the teeth.
So it stood firm from the addition; then I walked away from that part, and did not know what God did with it after me.
On the scar of the wound on the mouth.
Chapter 37 (head)
When the discharge comes down to the lip, and is scarred, and is long; then it is called a vertical scar; and if it is on the lower part and thick, round, then it is called a mole.
When cauterizing with it as we have said in the division, and the cure does not manifest itself; and you see that the scar has become cold from it, and is thin; then you should strike at it.
And what is joined to it that is round and has no length, and is bloody or dark-colored or black, and has no feeling; then you should strike off its scar. For fear is in the scar on the sick.
So you should do when you see it like the way I have described from whiteness and its length, so that you set the sick person before the sun; and press his tongue with an instrument which has gone before in narration: then fasten a hook into the lip, and pull it down: and strike it with one or two instruments which I have mentioned in cutting the two palates.
And you should not strike from it, unless it is added to the natural term without addition.
For if you strike from it any more, you will hurt speech and conversation.
Then after the scar has been struck from it, use that which I have described in cutting the two palates: and take care of it until it is healed.
But if the sick person trembles from the scar; then you should use your skill in cauterizing it without fear and worry.
The mode of cautery with her is not, unless with sharp water: and it is, that you put the head of the nurse in your bosom. Then press her tongue with the instrument which we have said. Then take from the water which I have told you in the chapter of cauterizing, and mix it with her foot not extinct, and put it not thick, nor thin, and fill it with this instrument, whose is this shape.
Sit at the end of her where the medicine is placed, as placed on the cochlea of the radius.
And place the instrument with the medicine on her uvula: and the sick lie on his side, so that the salve comes from her mouth from within the medicine, so that it does not go down from it to his throat, and hurts him.
Then take your hand with the medicine. And you from the first put it on her uvula of half-dose hour, until you see it has become blackened, and has calmed its itching with the medicine's mordication.
And if you want to take the cup and roll it on the end of the radius, and pour the cup with the medicine, and insert the radius with the cup into the tube from above, until it adheres to the uvula.
Do this many times, until you get what you want of the new cauterizing. Then let go of her: for she will heal and fall after three days, or four.
That if you want to drink the medicine, repeat it: and after cauterizing wash around her with a new cup dipped in butter, and clean with it what is in around her from the medicine: and let it sit with cold water.
And be cured from outside with embrocations, and inside with gargles, until he is healed.
This then species of cure is more beneficial than the incising and further distant from the fear.
And sometimes it is also cured with a sound that is finer than cautery and incision: for this reason it is cured with suffumigation, in this way. Take sumac, hyssop, oregano, rue, sseah, chamomile, abrotanums, and other herbs like them; put all of these together in a bowl, and add some vinegar and boil it: the pot should be well covered with litter: and there should be an opening in the middle of the pot above which a fine instrument is placed, as follows.
Let it be made of silver or brass; and the end, in which is the grain, should be inserted into the opening of the tube, until the steam ascends to the edge of the tube, until it is much obscured.
Then repeat this many times, until it is healed.
And if there is a wound, do not begin this cure at the very beginning. For it adds something to the wound: and you should not do this cure unless it is near the time of the warmth of the wound.
But if you do not have this instrument with you, then take a tube and fit a bit of wood to the end of it, so that the smoke does not burn the opening: for the wood prevents the steam from burning; and this is good cure with health.
Regarding the extraction of spine, and bone from the stomach.
Chapter 38 (on) surgery.
Many times an object like a tooth or a spine attached to the stomach, or some other foreign body.
Then, so that what is extraneous to it appears on the surface where the bite has taken place, having pressed the tongue with an instrument at the sun, and shown you what is inside,
And that which does not appear to you, or is hidden in the stomach, must be taken out before the food is digested in the stomach: for this will be effective with health. Perhaps, however, it will come out through the bile.
He should swallow the end of a rope, or the root of a lettuce, or chew dry bread; or he should take the end of a sea sponge that is dry and soft; and bind it with a string, then swallow it. When therefore he has come to the place where there are spines or an oss, and is drawn out, then he goes out.
But if he does not go out with it as I have said: then use the instrument of lead in this form.
Let it be thicker than the radius somewhat, and let there be a curved end at its end, which he may introduce into his throat with ease: and let him hold his head raised up.
And let him beware that he does not touch his epiglottis with his tongue, so that it should not give rise to a cough, and drive out the bone or the spine, or introduce the medicine into himself with his own hand.
But as for the sick person who is to be examined, this is better: through his knowledge of the site of the wound; and let him push below, or lift up his hand with the instrument upwards, all this according to the quantity that has been prepared for him, until he has gone out.
On the Extraction of Blood-Sucker.
CHAPTER XXXIX.
When you are treating with the blood-sucker, and he does not yield, consider whether there is a sore throat before the sun, or after it, when you press his tongue with the instrument that I have told you of.
But if your yawning falls on the blood-sucker, extract it with a small hook, or with subtle movements, and turn away from it.
But if it is not possible with them: then take a tightly-coiled tube, and introduce it into the throat as far as the throat; and then introduce into the coiled tube an iron that is ignited with fire. Make this many times over: and let the sick person refrain from all water for a whole day.
Then let him take a full wash with cold water and open his mouth into it; and let him put his own jaw into it and swallow nothing from it; and let him moisten the water with his hand for an hour after another. For a frog immediately falls when he feels the water.
But if he does not leave with him as we have said, then let him smoke the sick with ants or with an axe as a tool that we have used in smoking with it.
Do this many times, because he will fall himself.
And the method of operation in smoking is that you take a pot in which are fire-roasted frog legs and cover it with a lid, and make a hole in that lid, and fix the end of the tool in that hole.
Then throw the smoking, and let him put his own jaw on the end of the tube, and close it so that he does not come out from smoking until you know that smoking has reached the frog. For a frog immediately falls.
If he does not fall, then repeat the smoking many times.
And let the sick appetite endure, and eat sauce and other things, and do not drink water.
It is therefore necessary that he should go out with this regimen.
And this is the form of the tool from which the frog is taken out of its throat when it falls on it.
It is like a claw, as you see: unless because of the agility that enters into the throat. And the end of it is like an egg-shaped bird called a kikonis, in which there is a sharpness of chisel: and when it catches anything, does not let it go at all.
Regarding the opening of the Apotomates, and its sectioning, and care in general.
Chapter 40.
There are many species of Apotomates, many ways, according to the memory of them, that is to say, one, and there is one in this book: and they differ in their perforation, and in the cutting of them from two kinds.
There is one from the species of aphemia within itself, and because it comprehends from the humidity.
And the second way is because of the places, in which it happens from the body.
For aphemia happens in the head, it is different from the accident of aphemia in the anus; and the aphemia that happens in a fleshy place, it is different from the accident of aphemia in joints; and each of them has its own judgment according to the operation.
And from the aphemia are those that do not need to pierce, unless they have matured blood in them, and its completion; and from these are those that need to pierce when they are raw, and do not mature according to the completion.
As aphemia that is near joints.
For when aphemia happens nearby a joint and its length is prolonged until it rots what is around it, perhaps the ligaments rot, or the nerve of that joint: so it is the cause of the closer contraction of that limb.
Or is an aphemia in a main member; for if you delay the piercing of it until it matures, it will hurt or damage it or through that main member.
Or is nearby a nail, so pierce it when it is immature: and do not need to pierce, the raw aphemia, that is not complete digestion, unless it is nearby a nail, lest it rot deeply, and extends to the inside of the anus, and becomes a fistula, or forms in its term that does not heal.
You need to know the time of piercing the aphemia, that is mature according to its completion; and it is at the rest from pain, the withdrawal of fever, and the decrease of redness, and pulsation, and the sharpness of the head of the aphemia: and the other signs.
And you need to make the same piercing in the lower place of the aphemia, and more prominent; and let the piercing go in the length of the body, if the aphemia is in the parts of the hand and foot, and the places of the fingers, and the chords, and the nerves, and the arteries, and up to the last in all equal places, where there is no reflection.
And in those that are reflected, go with the perforation to that member.
When, however, there is a hematoma in fleshy places: then it is better that you should desist from perforating it until its digestion has been confirmed as we have said according to the complement.
For if you perforate it before that, the course of the virus will be prolonged from it, and there will be much pus and corruption, and perhaps the lips will become thicker, and its depth.
And some hematomas are perforated according to the width of the body in case of necessity: or according to that by which the member is stretched.
And it is necessary that you administer a small perforation in small hematomas and a wide perforation in large hematomas: or sections of different sizes of hematomas.
And there are hematomas from which the skin must be closed together: and it happens when it has already been done like a cloth, and has reached its term, for it is dead: such as happened to many, such as the poultices, and boils.
And there are those that cut off by section having three angles. And there is one in which it incises like the figure of a myrtle leaf.
Like a hematoma of the groin.
And there are those in which a round section is administered, and a lunar section: and similar ones from sections.
In fact, in those that have no head, such as are the small superficial hematomas, it is necessary to pierce them with a superficial perforation, or simply flat.
And it is necessary that when the hematoma is thick, and has already gathered a lot of blood, you pierce it so that it does not flow out and throw all of it out at once: but take off a part from it. Then dust the hematoma until another day. Then remove some pus again.
Then do this many times according to the degree, until it comes out: especially if it is a weak animal, or a pregnant woman, or a young boy, or an old man: for the animal spirit often dissolves from the animal with the exit of blood: and perhaps the sick one dies, and you don't notice it.
Then this chapter therefore with great care.
And after you have made the incision, as you make those incisions that are in front of you, it is necessary that you wipe away the sweat: and consider. But if there is a small wound in front of the incision, or it is a flat section, then he should administer a liniment made from linen, or an old poultice. And if there is a large wound, and there are many holes made by the incision, then he should put liniment into all the cracks, until they are closed up together.
And if you have cut off part of the skin in the wound, or if it has been torn around the circumference: then he should fill it with an old poultice, or as when the fabric is smooth, or is rubbed with a layer of hair without moisture: and tighten him up until the third day.
Then you should pour it out, and care for that with him as you need to from an ointment, until it heals.
But if blood flows in your hour of operation, then he should administer cold water, and vinegar, after it is soaked up by a cloth: and you should place him over the site of the flow many times.
But if the flow of blood persiste, then he should administer a regime, and cure, and powders, which I have narrated in many places of our book, and from a division.
But if it is in the time of winter, and the location of the wound has many nerves: then you should pour in powders with wine, and hot oil: and place them on the places.
And if it is in the summer, and the places are fleshy: then you should pour in powders soaked in water, and oil, or in wine and oil, and all of that cold. Until the third day, as we have said, then you should remove the wound, and wipe him clean, and administer to him whatever cure is appropriate for him, until he heals.
This is why it is necessary to know about the treatment of different types of wounds universally.
However, as for the halfway point of the distinction, I have already said regarding all kinds of wounds, how to treat each one separately.
[Head]
[On the section dealing with wounds that occur on the scalp.]
Wounds that occur on the scalp are small, and they are of two kinds: nods, which are surrounded by a membrane, which is like a bag for them; as if they were little hens' nests.
And there are many kinds of these wounds.
Of these wounds, some are small; and of these wounds, there are those that contain moisture similar to lime; and of these wounds, there is moisture similar to rain and pus; and there are similar ones, and among these there are hard stones.
And in the cutting of all of them, nor is there any danger in their extraction, provided that you do not make any difference when cutting at the site of the wound itself, where the arteries are opposed.
And the operation on these wounds is that you test it with an instrument, whose form has come after these things, which is called the "intromission", until you know what it contains.
For if that is what contains moisture, then dry up the section at right angles to the surface of the wound: in this form.
And begin the cutting from line B to line G. When therefore the moisture is drained out, then remove the skin that contains that moisture, and do not leave any of it behind.
Many times it will return if some of it remains.
Then dip the cloth in Egyptian ointment if it is present: and if not, in water and salt: and fill it with oil, and leave it until the next day. That ointment will corrode what remains of the skin.
Then repeat the application of the Egyptian ointment a second and third time, and if you find it tolerable, until you are confident that nothing remains in the skin, then, since you are comfortable with it, apply the oil with ointment, until the wound heals.
If the abscess contains a pimple: then dry it up according to this form, having the section in the form of a cross; and throw away the hooks between the clefts of the section, and scrub it off entirely; and try your skill in extracting the tunica that contains it.
But if it contradicts you, then do as I shall tell you after.
And also do the same in an abscess, if it is rocky, from the section, and cure in the same way, as we have said.
And the section on a rocky abscess is easier: for there is little blood and moisture. And sometimes some of these abscesses are in the head of certain men, where there is no moisture within.
That is: because I followed on an abscess in the head of a married woman, and found it like a solid stone hard, sharp, white, which could not be broken: and if anyone struck it with a punch, he wounded the flesh.
But in other abscesses of accidents in the head, aside from these abscesses that occur in the heads of boys, and at the roots of the ears, all of them are superficial sections.
Or put a hole in them always from their lower part, that the course of the juice may run to the bottom.
Then take care for these with what is fitting when they are cured.
On the section of Strophulus in the neck.
Head 42.
These abscesses often occur in the neck, and under the cheeks, and in the groin, and sometimes in the whole body.
And above those which occur from them in the neck, there is one kind, and many: and they spring from a common source; and all Strophulus comes from its own tunica, as we have said.
And the kinds of Strophulus are many. And from these are the leaves; and from these are those that retain moisture; and from these are the evil ones, which do not obey cure.
For from these are the leaves; and from these are those that retain moisture; and from these are the evil ones, which do not obey cure.
And it is on guard that it should not strike the vein or nerve.
And let it not be sharp; so that it should not cause your hand to tremble or trouble you in any way, and let you fall down, for this is not necessary.
But if you strike a vein or an artery, or prevents you from carrying out the operation, then put a wooden stake and some powder that stops the blood, and tighten the stake and let go of it, until the edge of the wound has healed, and the wood has become soft: or else it begins to rot.
For blood is stopped by powder; so that you can put yourself back in the preparation for your work, until you are finished with it.
Then examine with your index finger whether there is anything left of the stitches; so that you can cut them off and clean them out.
If there is a large vein at the base of the stitch; then it should not be cut from its root; but it should be tied with strong thread and let go until it falls out by itself without doing any harm.
Then fill the stitch with old cotton that you have already soaked in Egyptian ointment. Then care for the wound.
If the whole stitch has been cut, then you should collect two leaves of the wound; and clean it immediately, as soon as you see that there is no excess remaining.
If you see that there is excess because of the size of the stroma, then it is necessary that you understand to cut off its root and extract it: and administer the suture which we have mentioned.
And which of the stroma contains moisture, pierce it with a superficial puncture: so that you see the place of maturity of it: and put the puncture from there because it follows below the body, as we have said.
Then, after the puncture, administer the licking with ointment and similar things so that it corrupts what remained from corruption, until when you see the scar already healed: then take care of it with a generate ointment of flesh, until it heals.
CHAPTER XLVIII.
§ On the section of the epiglottis from the hernia inside the throat by accident.
The ancient ones said that this section of the epiglottis, and no one in our land has done it, and this is a writing of their speech.
But in those who have a synachium, the section of the epiglottis should be removed: not to do it because of the following thing: for all nostrils and lung are feeble.
In those, however, who have a hot hernia in the mouth or throat or both the walnuts, when there is no disease in the canal, it is necessary to use the section of the epiglottis, to avoid the destruction that is done by pre-condensation.
It is necessary, therefore, when we want to do that thing, that we remove the epiglottis under a circle of the epiglottis, or four, small section by its length, which is the section in the sifil, not in the cartilage: and this place is suitable for the section, because it is separated from flesh, and the blood vessels are far away from it.
If the doctor is a timid one, then it is necessary that he extends the skin of the throat with a hook. Then he finds the skin, until when it reaches to the canal: remove the blood vessel, if he sees any from it.
Then cut away the skin that we have described: and it signifies upon the section of the canal from the phlegm which comes out of it, with that which is cut off, and the ablation of the voice.
And let the raw area be left open for some time.
When therefore the place is moved by the hour, in which there is a fear of hernia, the two lips of the wound of the skin are gathered together and are sutured alone without the cartilage.
Then apply medicines that make the flesh grow again until it is healed.
Says Albucasis. Says Albucasis. The summary of this speech that we have described is an exposition, unless it is clear that one of these lumps has already been drained by the throat being infected: and the sick person has risen up higher than death, and his hernia has grown larger between the larynx and the windpipe, so that he can breathe more freely, and save himself from death: and for this reason they have ordered to leave the lump open, until the malice of the illness is consumed, and it is a malice of three days, and almost the same: then they order to put a lump on it, and to take care of him, until he is healed.
And that which I saw myself, that a servant took a knife, and put it into his throat, and cut off with it a part of the canal of the lung.
And I was called to cure him, and I found it gurgling, as it is the sound of a dead person.
I therefore took away from the lump, and I found blood that was coming out of the small wound. I therefore confessed, that he had not cut off any part, nor sewed it up: and the wind came out from the wound.
I therefore took away the lump, and I cured him, until he was well: and there happened to the servant nothing, except that his voice became hoarse: and after a few days he recovered to better health.
Thus I say: for there is no fear in the epiglottis.
De the section of the hernia of the throat.
Chapter LXXIV.
This hernial growth, named hernia of the throat, is a large one, second in size only to the color of the body; and it occurs frequently in women.
And it has two causes: either it is natural or, on the other hand, it is accidental.
Certainly there is no talent in the natural one.
The accidental one, on the other hand, has two causes; one is similar to the nodules and pus, and the other is... And the other mode, is similar to an aphtem that is formed from the knotting of a blood vessel. And there is a fear in it; and one should not dare to make an incision on it unless it is small; and you should test it and investigate it with the probe. If then the aphem is similar to a large nodule and is not suspended with any veins: then dry it up as you do nodules; and take it out with it if it is contained in a sack, for if it is not, then inspect it all over. Then care for the place with what needs to be done in curing, until it heals.
Chapter L.
De the section on the types of nodules.
There are many types of nodules, and I have already spoken about their various types; and it is necessary for me to describe the difference between a nodule and an excrescence when there is doubt.
I say, then, that when there is heat and fever and acute pain, until effusion subsides and putrefaction is complete; for then the fever and the heat subside.
But when there is no heat or fever or pain, and they are contained in sacks of their own sinuses, which are like beans, and resemble a plumskin, and are larger and smaller: this is how nodules begin.
And they are according to two species: either they are thin: or they retain moisture. And the colors of moisture are many, as I have said in the division.
Therefore, when you apply the poultice to the wound, so that you may feel it and examine it, use the instrument called the intromissor first, according to what will come about from its form in the following chapter.
And the method of examining abscesses and all kinds of boils is, when you take this instrument, to introduce it into a moist place which you have made in the abscess: and you shall move your fingers with it slowly, until you know that the instrument has penetrated the skin. Then take the last hand according to the size of the abscess.
Then remove the intromissor, and see what comes out into the hole.
If therefore it comes out running with moisture, whatever its color is: then dry him by a superficial cut, as I have said for the rest of the abscesses.
And if the intromissor does not bring out moisture in the hole, then you will know that it is fat: so dry him over the top with a V-shaped cut, according to this shape, as I have taught you: and suspend it by hooks, and scrape off the skin from all parts with ease: and if you can keep a box over it, so take out the healthy flesh with a nodule.
If however the skin ruptures during the operation, and it is not possible to take out the healthy flesh, often because this happens: then take it away hastily, until nothing remains of it.
For if there remains a little or much of it, the nodule returns according to most of them.
For if it hurts you, and there remains a little of it: then fill the wound with some powdered caustic substance sharp: and tighten the poultice, and place it over the abscess that sits warm, and take care of the rest of the wound with the usual cure, until it heals.
If then there is a large knot, then cut it in two, and take care that what is incorporeal remains with it.
If however you have a new swelling that pulsates, or does not pulsate: then approach it and fill the space with three-fold powder, and leave it strict for two days, or three, until the pus has putrefied and the fever has subsided: then return to incision of what is left from the knot.
Chapter LVI.
¶ Of external instruments for section and piercing.
From these are the forms of intromissions, and they are of three kinds.
For there is a large one, and there is a medium one, and there is a small one.
Let there be made of iron four-squared extremities deviated, so that they may make the entrance into an apotome.
And these are the forms of exsertions, and there is one, that is to say, piercing: and it is of three kinds.
For there is a large one, and a medium one, and a small one.
Let them be made to project through the apotomes, and the exits, and the tubes, and the abscesses from him who is between them of the bones.
And others are round, and sharp, and smooth, such as the large needles with which the backs of the ears are pierced, made of citrine, or of brass, or of iron, or of silver.
And better ones are those made of citrine.
And there are also exsertions of black lead which are made to project so that the tubes may be examined by it; for with its softness they reflect with mildness to themselves those reflections.
And again they are of three kinds. For there are long ones, and medium ones, and short ones, according to the quantity of the width of the tube and its strictness.
Form of the coracoi, and they are of many kinds.
For they are simples, that is to say, those in which there is one length: and they are of three species as you see, great, medium, and small.
And out of these are the blind Vincess: and they are of three species.
And out of these are the hooks having two lengths, and they are of three species: and out of these are the hooks having three lengths, and they are of three species: and all of these are necessary in their place.
These are the shapes of Scalpels, with which they cut and scarify nodes and abscesses: and they are of three species: for out of these is great, medium, and small.
Their extremities with which they make the section are acute, other extremities are not acute: and they are not placed so, unless it is done with them that makes incision in a nodule out of fear of wound of the skin, or in a nerve: and to heal him who is ill through the heat which he has received less than that which heals by scarification of abscesses.
They are made of brass, and they are similar to the wire by which is made the alcohol: and in the long end there is a concealed pin-head: and in it runs towards the inside, and towards the outside when you wish, as you see.
The form of the pin-head which is concealed between the fingers at the perforation of abscesses: and do not feel it with the touch: and they are of three species, great, medium, and small.
The forms of Wind-pockets with which the flow of blood is cut off: and they are of three species, great, medium, and small.
Let them be made of brass, or of copper, round, a little long, as you see: and let them be delicate.
And let these species of wind-pockets be with you great, and small: that you may cut off the blood with them at speed when you are in need, and then when medicine is not present with you.
Indeed, you should not use them for ablation of blood in any part of the body, and you should not use them unless in meaty places: such as the legs, pelvis, arms, breasts, palms, ankles, and similar, from meaty places, moist.
And when they are made from them small instruments like the blade of a chisel, in accordance with their shape: which ablate blood when it flows from a phlebotomy site, or at a cut to a vein or artery: and sometimes they are made round in this form.
Chapter 57: The Care of the Breast
Now concerning the care of the mammary glands in men which resemble the mammary glands of women:
When and if the breasts of some men swell at the time of sleep (that is, as they begin to become erect in sleep) until they resemble the breasts of women: and remain soft to the touch.
Whoever then dislikes this, should tie a bandage over the breasts with the moon shape, according to this form from a line, to a line, and so on. And then scrape the whole of the swelling. Then fill up the breasts with an ointment made from the ink of the murex shell. Then attach two strips of skin to the nipples with a stitch, and look after it until it heals.
If however the nipple sways downward and softens because of its size, as is the case with women: then let it be found in its two sides on top in two sections like the moon shape, and each one is held by another at the ends like this line from a line to line, g. Then scrape the skin that is between the two lips, and remove the swelling, and apply what we have said about the stitch and the powders, which is necessary in the treatment, until it heals.
If however you do not like the incision that needs to be made on it because of the unease of the disease or the flow of blood: then let you fill the breasts with a submerged cotting ointment that is corrosive, and let go of them, until what remains of the swelling is corroded. Then the care for him, until he is healed.
Regarding the perforation of the abscess, which occurred during the reign of Titus.
Chapter 58.
These abscesses that occur during the reign of Titus are of a hard species of staph, which contains blisters and from them emerge fluid.
Since these are of the type that contains moisture, they should be cut open with a lunar section, according to this form, from line B to line G; and when all that is in the abscess has been drained out of its fluid, then fill it with old skin, and leave it until the next day.
Then the dressing is removed, and care is taken with the ointment suited to it, until it is healed.
If the abscess is of the species of nodules of the staph, then cut it over the top, as we have said in the section on how to cut staphylae equally.
But if it extends a knuckle, so that it spits out pus, then administer cauterization to it, as we have said in the preceding passage.
Chapter 59.
Regarding the section of an abscess that occurs due to an artery or a vein.
When an artery is interrupted and the skin that is above it hardens, it often occurs that a abscess develops there: and likewise it happens with veins, so that a abscess and swelling occur there.
And the signs by which it is known that an abscess and swelling are due to an artery or a vein are these: for when an abscess is due to an artery, it is long and gathered in the depths of the body; and when you press your fingers upon the abscess, you feel as if there were a hissing sound.
And that which is due to a vein is round in appearance on the surface of the body.
And the section upon this abscess is an error, especially if it is under the armpits, and in the groin, and on the neck, and in many other places of the body; and it is great to a remarkable degree. Therefore, so that his care may be with iron, and that which is also from them in the extremities, or in the head, let it be made.
So therefore, since it is from them, that which is from the inflammation of the opening of the artery, find on the skin in a section in length. Then open the section with the hook, then the artery: and free it from the tunics, until it is detected.
Then introduce it under it, and let it penetrate as far as another side, and tighten the artery with a double thread at two places, according to what I taught you in the extraction of two arteries which are in the temples.
Then pierce the place, which is between the two ligaments with a scalpel, until all the blood that is in it comes out, and dissolve the hematoma.
Then administer the cure which generates pus, until the ligaments fall: then treat that with ointments suitable for it, until it heals.
If it is a hematoma because of the section of a vein, then you must hold your hand so that you can get it from the hematoma with the skin. Then introduce the hook under the place which you held with your hand, and let it penetrate: and let it be in it a double thread, until you draw it out from the other side. Then bind with it the hematoma with a good ligament: according as I told you in binding a ligament, from the two parts with the two extremities of the thread.
If however you should suppose that a thread is to be extracted, then introduce another hook with another thread under the hematoma from all around the incision of the hook: press, and tighten your threads in four places.
Then dry up the hematoma in its middle, until when it comes out what is in it: then make an incision on the skin, and let go what was tied from it.
Then put on the top a little wool which you immersed in wine, and oil. Then apply the cure, which is done with liniments and unguents, until it heals.
The head.
That which happens from a twist of the neck.
As has happened with the artery and vein, so has also happened with the nerves: which has happened from a beating, or from excessive work, and in like manner: and it is very useful for them in places of support, or heel, and in any place where the ligaments move: and it is a dark spot.
It resembles the color of the rest of the body, and is present in many dispositions without pain: and when it is held with a vibratory movement, it feels in it a similar stupor.
And is not an aggregate pustule under the skin, but lies beneath the skin, and moves itself to all parts, and does not affect toward the front, or before, nor behind:
That which then is present in the ligaments does not need to be pricked with a needle. Perhaps, however, it may happen that contraction occurs:
In that, however, which is present in the head or forehead, find skin with a bristle. If then it is a small pustule, then hold it with tweezers and cut it off at the root.
And if it is large, then hang it by a hook and scrub it off: then remove it, and add the suture: and care for it, until it heals.
The head.
On the cutting of the pustules, which happens in the belly.
To some people often happens again and again in their bellies, and in the rest of their bodies, a kind of fungi, which they call "fungii", on account of the similarity of these to fungi.
The root of these is fine, and their heads are thick, and their lips are turned down. And there are some who grow very large: and there are some who become very thin.
And indeed I have already seen a man, and within his abdomen there were two small things, which were greater than other similar fungi: there was no difference between them, white, with minute roots, and their lips were intertwined, and they ended, and moisture always ran out of them.
So I have cut them open, and I found in weight one as if ten and eight ounces and the other as if six ounces; And the operation of cutting them is so that you consider then, if he is weak, moist, and the color of the fungus is white, moist, with a thin root: Then cut him with a broad chisel, and let cauterization be in your presence on fire.
For many times blood is discharged during the incision: so then if you are overcome by blood, then cauterize him.
That if you see him weak, trembling because of the incision with iron, then take a wire made from lead that is made to waver, and hold it with him: whose way is what we have said, and let him go after two days.
Then add to the constriction of lead. So do not cease to constrict lead, whenever it presses on the fungus, until it is cut off, and falls of itself without work.
If the fungus is large in root, then there is some fear and trembling in the incision: especially since it is in the abdomen.
However, it is possible that you cut off half of it. Then cauterize him, so that he does not shed.
Then care for the wound, until it heals.
And do not suspect that the fungus which is of a dark color, little sense, and an appetizing appearance: for it is an ulcerous cancer: and I come with a remembrance of Cancer after this.
Head II.
On the care of the eminence of the umbilicus.
Emancipation of the umbilicus is due to various causes. It comes out from the fissures that are above the navel: and it issues forth from it, either as anus or intestine, according to what happens in the other ruptures. Or from the blood that flows out of a vein, or from an artery, according to what has been said above. Or from the windiness confined within it.
But if, on the other hand, it comes out through a fissure that is sifac, and the discharge is dirty: then it is like the color of bloody pus: and it is slimy, without pain: and it seems to be in different locations. And if, on the other hand, it is because of the exit of the intestine: then its site is with that which we have described, more varied in character. When you press it with your fingers, it is hidden: but then it returns, and perhaps there is a sound with it: and it makes a lot of noise at the entrance to the wind, and a rumbling noise.
But if, on the other hand, it is because of humidity, it is slimy, then it does not hide when you press it with your hand, nor does it become tighter, nor does it get added.
If, on the other hand, it is because of blood, then with these signs appears a swelling that turns black at the edge.
But if it is because of a born flesh: then it is a grayish, thick, hard swelling, and it forms one unit in quantity.
But if it is because of windiness, then the touch of it is gentle.
And the operation in it is this: if you note that the prominent umbilicus is because of blood from an artery, or vein, or windiness: then you should refrain from treating it. For there is danger and fear in it, as I taught you in the chapter where I said that swelling comes because of an artery or vein.
If the prominent umbilicus is because of an intestine or a hernia: then you should order the sick person to hold his breath and stand with his arms extended. Then the signs with caustic around the navel of the whole. Then order him to lie down on his back between your hands. Then surround the navel with a hot iron knife at the place you marked with caustic. Then extend the middle part of the skin from above, with a large hook. Then tie him tightly around the navel with a strong thread or silk cord: and let the knot of the tied cord be attached.
Then open the middle part of the skin that has been extended above the ligment. If you have already found the navel caught on the ligment: then remove the ligment and push it into the navel with the index finger: and if there is a hernia, then take it with the hook and cut off its excess.
If, however, the opposite side is a blood vessel or an artery: then surround it very much. Then turn to your own operation. And take two needles and introduce two strong threads into them: and introduce the two needles around the one you have made around the swelling in the form of a cross, which you make penetrate.
Then tighten the swelling at four places on the needles: and if there is a vein, remove the needle, and let it rest until the flesh has rotted away: and let it fall of itself: or cut it off when it becomes thin and rotten.
Then take care of the swelling with the ointment as needed until it heals.
That if the prominence of the navel is from flesh inside or from moisture: then you should seal up the swelling, as we have said. And draw out the blood, or the moisture that has entered it.
Then take care of the swelling to make the place solidify.
Chapter LIII.
Of the treatment of cancer.
We have already spoken at some length about the types of cancer and how to treat it with medicine: and how to beware of treating it with iron so that it does not ulcerate: and we spoke about cancer generated in the womb, and about caution in its treatment.
And the ancients said, that whenever cancer is at a place where its eradication is possible: such as cancer that is in the breast, or in the thigh, and those similar to it, from the member located to extract all of it: especially when it is beginning to parous.
When, however, the cancer has been long established, and is great, it is not necessary that you approach it.
For I cannot heal from it myself: nor did I see anyone else who has recovered from it.
And the operation in it, when it is located as we have said, is, as it were, to go before and to loosen the sick from black cholera sometimes. Then phlebotomy itself if it is with evident swelling of the venes.
Then prepare the sick with preparation, in which he is located with the operation.
Then throw into the cancer the hooks that suit it. Then wrap up the whole with skin, according to the examination, until there is nothing left of its roots: and let not the blood flow, and do not tear it away quickly, except you express the places, and wipe off the gross blood entirely by hand, or with whatever is possible there.
If, however, the opposite makes you flow of gross blood from the incision of an artery or a vein: then cauterize the vein until the blood is separated. Then take care of the cancer with the remaining cure, until it heals.
§ On curative hydropesis.
CHAPTER LII. ON THE TREATMENT OF WATER IN THE B I have spoken so far on the division of species of hydropesis and how the aggregation of water is made: and the signs of each species, and its cure with medicines.
And those that are cured by iron do not approach except a single species of asclepius: and does not approach the iron of the hyposarcis species: for this is deadly.
When you had begun to treat with this species of hydropesis as a tympanic with medicines, and your treatment did not succeed: then reflect. If the disease has already advanced and there is a concomitant weakness or other infirmity besides hydropisis: as if there is a cough with him, or a loosing of the eye, and things like these: then beware that you do not meddle with him with iron: for there is fear in this.
But if you see a person with an abundance of vigor and strength who is not sick except for hydropisis: and he is not a boy, nor an old man: then the method of operation in him is, that you stand him between your hands, and let him squirt the fluid from his hand toward the lower part of the chest.
Then take a small piece of wood with thorns, shaped like this. Set the two sharp ends, one long, and the acute extremity like a sputumile. But in him there should be something that opens gradually, so that you do not harm him with the operation up to the intestine, and you leave him alone.
Then consider. For if the generation of hydropisis is from the part of the intestines, then it should be extended with a section of three fingers' length from the navel directly below the chest.
But if the generation of hydropisis is due to liver disease: then your section should be on the left from the navel by three fingers' length.
And if the generation of it is due to the spleen, then your section should be on the right side: and it should not also be that the sick person lies on his back, so that fluids do not run to that weak place.
Then pierce the skin with a tool all around. Then introduce into that section, and squeeze with your hand with the sputumile between the skin, and rub it as if you were cleaning him out: and let the amount that is squeezed be the amount of a nail, or around that area.
Then pierce the skin until the sputumile reaches a vacuum spot: and that is a place of water. Then extract the flesh, and insert an instrument into this opening. And it is similar to a tube: it is made from silver, or brass, or gold, or linden wood, or tin: and in its lower part there is a small opening, and on the sides of it there are three openings, two on one side, and one on the other side: and the end of it should be sharpened according to the way that a penknife is sharpened, as you see; and at the top of its end there is an armlet.
For when the instrument reaches the water, it descends immediately on top of the instrument; therefore it drains from the water at a medium rate of quantity.
For if you drain from it more than is necessary, perhaps a weak person may die through the loss of his animal spirit: or something may happen to him that approaches death.
But drain from it according to the strength of its power, and according to what you are instructed by its pulsation, and by the goodness of its nature.
Then remove the instrument and retain the water.
That is, because it retains immediately by reason of the skin which retains the opening that is above the syphons: of which I tell you, so that you perform it according to that method.
Then repeat the instrument on the other day, if you see that it can bear that treatment: and remove also from the water a quantity of water that is small.
Do that for some days without fear, and guard yourself against error: until there remains in the water only a little.
But if you are treating a weak person, and you let go of a great deal of water: then take care of him with a grave disease in warm sand, and with much sweat in a bath and in the sun, and wait for hunger: and take care of him with dried-up medicines, until he is healed; and cauterize his stomach, and his entrails, and his spleen, after removing the water: following which I tell you that preceded it.
Of the care of infants who are born with their bladder places not pierced.
Chapter LVI.
When any baby is born from the womb of its mother, and the head of its penis is not pierced, or the foramen is closed, or is not in its place.
Therefore it is necessary to help with the piercing of it immediately when it is born with a delicate needle, according to this form.
Then put on the hole a thin plug of lead, and bind it: and hold it three days, or four.
When then he wants to emit urine, let it be moved, and let it go away. Then reduce the penis.
And if you do not put lead on, it is possible that urine which runs over the place, does not allow the penis to be closed.
But he whose foramen is closed, is treated with lead, as we have said, for many days, until it is enlarged.
But those in whom the foramen is not in its place, are wounded. Which is, because from the one who is born, the foramen is at the end of the penis head: why it cannot urinate in front, until it raises its penis with its hand to the top. And there is no generation for him, therefore semen cannot reach the womb according to its straightness: and it is a bad disease.
And the mode of action in that is, so that it lies down on its back. Then extend the penis head with your left hand by a forceful extension, and cut the head of the penis from the right place with an edge, or a sharp needle: like the cut of a pen, or like you cut something, so that it resembles the head of the penis in shape: and let the foramen fall in the middle according to what should be.
And cause yourself to be near to the flow of blood during your operation. That often happens. Therefore, I did not go with him when he cut off his blood, and healed the wound, until it healed.
Regarding the wounds on the foreskin and scalp, and their putrefaction, blackening, and adherence.
The head.
Often such wounds occur on the penis, and there is an abundance of foul flesh.
And from it one kind of wound is evil and another not evil.
So you should not hang the non-evil one with a small hook, and cut it off, until you have completely removed all of it. Then put on top of it a vat submerged in Egyptian ointment. Then care for the wound with daphnic acid after that, until it heals.
If the wound is evil and of a foul color, then you should administer cauterization to it after cutting it and rasping it.
But if the wound is on the foreskin, which has not been circumcised, and a part of the wound is inside the foreskin and another outside it: then you should remove the wound that is inside the foreskin first, until it is properly healed, then care for the outside wound: because when you care for it at the same time, the foreskin does not heal securely without perforating it.
And now I will also say about wounds that occur on the testicles and on the foreskin, blackness and putrefaction: Then you should bring together everything that has been blackened so far, and what seeks to corrupt, or what is already corrupted.
Then put a line of honey on top of it that has already been crushed with wheat flour and dried with the crisping tongs.
Then care for that one with the remaining cure, until it heals.
But if blood flow occurs, then administer cauterization with lunar cautery, according to this form.
For cauterization is of two dispositions at the same time, namely to the blood flow and to the wound when it corrupts.
If the head of the vagina is corroded and it is completely destroyed in an hour: then you should insert a suitable tube of lead into the meatus so that the sick person urinates on it.
But in reality the prepuce adheres to the head of the vagina, and this type of adhesion does not occur unless the prepuce is healthy, and circumcision is not required on it; and when an adhesion occurs due to a wound or hematoma, then you should cut it with a dull chisel until the ligament is dissolved and the head of the vagina is freed from all parts.
If it is difficult to distinguish it well, then you should cut a little from the head of the vagina and from the foreskin. Because the foreskin is thin, it may be pierced quickly due to its thinness.
Then separate the foreskin and the head of the vagina with a thin linen cloth, which has already been soaked in cold water so that it does not adhere again.
Then treat with wine containing Styphle, until it hardens.
Chapter LVII.
For the purification of infants and treatment from an accident by mistake.
Circumcision is not a cure for continence, as are the other wounds; however, it is an improvement on our wish and its use in young people is beneficial. We must mark this operation as better and more likely to lead to health.
I say, the old people did not say anything about circumcision in any of their books: because they do not use it in their laws, and it is only what we have acquired through experimentation.
That is because I have discovered most of the arts, and the use of leeches and bloodletting for purification, circumcision with a blade and with forceps: they use them to remove the skin, and bind with thread, and incise with a nail.
I have already tested all these methods and found that there is no better way to clean with forceps and thread than ligation.
For when it comes to cleaning with forceps, the skin often heals well. Since the foreskin has two layers of skin, it is possible that one layer may be incised and the other left intact; consider then that the lower layer may be incised as well, causing pain. And since the cleaning done with the finger, that is, the digital method used by surgeons, does not secure the incision at the tip of the male member, it is possible that it may be inserted into a cavity.
But in cleaning with nails, there is a risk of breaking the iron, and ruining your operation; and since the skin of the boy is short by nature, and often grows so that it does not need cleaning; I have already seen this.
But in cleaning with forceps and thread, I have found by experimentation that this is good; since the forceps are of a proportion to make the incision, so that the sharpness above is like the sharpness below. So when you press your hand, the two sharpnesses are proportioned, and they incise one second at a time in the same operation; and it forms a compression of a similar shape, containing the skin of the penis from all sides, so that there is no mistake at all.
And the method of operation is special, so that you can make a quick decision, especially if he is from those who understand somewhat, which you do not do unless you tie the thread on his penis only: and let him go until the next day.
Then let him be happy and enjoy himself in all ways possible for you, since he accepts his understanding. Then let him stand between your hands prepared to stand, and not sitting; and conceal the forceps in your sleeve or under your foot, so that the boy does not see them at all, nor any of the instruments.
Then put your hand on his penis, and blow into the skin, and pull it up, until the head of the penis comes out. Then clean yourself from that which has gathered there in filthiness.
Then bind the marked spot with a double knot. Then bind below it to the same extent as the second ligature. Then hold with your index finger and thumb between the two ligatures where the lower one is held in place, and cut between them. Then wash the skin quickly upwards, and pull out the head of the penis. Then let the blood run away little by little (for it is better) and put on top of the powder: and over the powder a cloth in which the bandage has been expanded, washed with rosin-oiled water, crushed with fresh rosewater: and leave it on itself until another day: and take care of the rest by curing, until it heals.
The shape of the clamp for cleaning is like this.
The two ends should be even and not project, and the length of the sharp points should be equal to the length of the two hands.
But a mistake in cleaning is this: for it may well avoid all skin, or some part of it near the cut.
So you should spread it out from your own time with your nail before examining the place: and cut it to equality.
If you cannot hold it with your nail, then take it out with a clamp, and cut it.
But if it has passed three days and what is under the penis inflated, infected: then let it go until the infection subsides, and wash it well, and cut it as you prepare yourself: and make sure that you do not hurt yourself with the head of the penis. That will not harm him.
Take care that the powder does not harden on him which we described in the book about powders: and if it cuts into the skin above the line, and runs upward, it does no harm to him either.
Therefore treat this with what we have said, until it is healed.
Head LVIII.
On the extraction of a retained wren from the bladder.
Retention of urine in the bladder is due to an operation carried out because of a stone, blood congealed, pus, or meat grown, and similar conditions from those we have spoken of in the division of treatment.
And if the wren is not resolved, and you see that the retention is because of a stone which is now in the neck of the bladder: then it is necessary that the patient be cured lying on his knees. Then they shall arrange his feet on his back, and he shall extend his belly from the upper part of his back, and the patient shall restrain his desire to defecate as much as is possible for him. Therefore it is calculated with the neck of the bladder for the expulsion of the stone to the rear: why is the wren resolved.
That if it is not resolved with what we have said, and the pain is continued on the patient: then it is necessary that you administer the extraction with an instrument which is called a syringe, which has this shape: it is of silver, and it is fine, smooth, and sharp like the cannula of a bird's feather in its subtility, long like the palm of a hand and the middle one; and which has a subtile cannula on its tip.
And the mode of exit of the wren through it is so that you take a double thread, and tie it at its end with good knot: and insert the end of the thread into the lower part of the syringe: and strike with forceps if there is anything excessive of wool; but truly insert it in the cannula with care, as it were a twig.
Then dip the syringe in oil, or in butter, and in Alba (white) wool: and make the patient sit on a chair, and introduce the bladder, and his thread with moist oils, and olive oil, and warm water.
Then introduce the syringe into the penis with ease, until it reaches the root of the penis.
Then double the string over the top part near the navel.
Then push the syringe inside itself until it reaches the bladder, and let him feel that he has already come to an end of relieving himself: and do not make this second order unless the meatus, in which you urinate, is bent.
Then extend the string with a wool slowly. For the wool follows the thread.
Then draw it out, and let the scrotum run along the penis-hole: and again introduce the syringe, and do not cease doing that, until the bladder is emptied, and you feel relief of pain.
Of the quality of washing the bladder with a clepsydra.
Chapter LIX.
When there is an ulcer in the bladder, or blood congeals in it, or pus is gathered in it, and water and medicines are to be distilled into it: then make use of an instrument called a clepsydra, and this is its shape.
It is an opaque vessel, that is, closed. And in it are three holes, two on one side and one on the other side, as you see them.
And the concave place, in which is placed the thing that pushes it without addition, until when it is drawn out with it something is attracted from the moistures: and when it is pushed, together with it, at a distance: according to which the clepsydra drops naphtha, that is, Greek fire in battles on the field.
When you wish to pour waters into the bladder, introduce the extreme end of the clepsydra into the water, and draw it out with what pushes it upwards, for water is drawn into the concave place of the clepsydra.
Then introduce the extreme end of it into the penis, according to which we have described the syringe. Then push moisture with it as it pushes that, for that moisture goes to the dryness at once, so that the sick person feels it.
Form a thin clistere which moistens the bladder.
Let it be made of silver or brass; its head should be higher than the lower part and a loop should be placed under it.
Then take the bladder of a ewe, and place moisture in it, which you will use to moisten the bladder. Then tie it between two loops with strong thread and heat it slightly over a fire.
Then insert the end of the clistere into the penis, then tighten your hand around the bladder with the moisture as it becomes tighter, until the sick person feels that the moisture has already reached the bladder.
If you do not have a present bladder, then take an end of parchment, and make it into a circle, and pierce it from all its roundness. Then insert a strong thread into those holes, as they rotate. Then gather the circle, as is gathered for sewing; when you have placed that which you use for moisten, oil, and water.
Then tie it to the instrument; and do with it as you did with the bladder from expression with your hand, until the moisture reaches the bladder.
ヘッド
The Extraction of Stone.
We have already spoken in the division of the species of stone, and the cure of it with medicines; and we have also distinguished between stone generated in the kidneys, bladder, and other parts, and that is operated on by hand or section: and this is stone properly generated in the bladder: and that which is generated in the kidney is that which grows on the stalk: and I am now speaking of it with manifest illustration and abbreviation.
I therefore say, as for stone generated in the bladder, it often happens to boys.
When a person's urine flows out of his penis like water, and it is thin, and there appears to be white sand in it, and the man's penis hurts when he moves it, and he suffers with it, and often hangs down: Then it becomes erect, and is discharged with the anus in many of them.
And the cure of boys is easy from that age until they are fourteen years old. And it is difficult in the elderly. But in young men it is half-way between the two; and the cure is easier if the man' s stone is large; and if it is small, then the cure is difficult for him.
When we come to the cure, it is necessary first of all that we should clean out the sick man with a clister, which he should remove all the dung that is in his intestines: for sometimes he prevents the discovery of the stone in the inquiry.
Then the sick man should be taken with his feet, and shaken up, and moved down: that the stone may go down into the depths of the rectum, or sometimes come out from a high place.
Then make him sit between your hands, prepared like this, and let his hands be under his heels, so that the entire rectum may decline towards the bottom:
Then inquire about it, and feel it from the outside.
If then you feel a stone in the space, immediately turn yourself towards the section above it.
If it does not fall under your touch at all, then you should wipe the index finger with the oil of your left hand, if the sick boy is a boy; or with the middle finger if he is a full-grown man: and put him in some part of his anus, and feel the stone until it is under your finger: and turn him slowly towards his anus.
Then press on it with your finger, and push it towards the outside against the section which you have found; and let one minister rub his hand on the anus, and another minister stretch out his right hand to the top: and let him moisten the skin, which is under the testicles in that part where the section is.
Then introduce the spatumil incidens, whose form this is. Then find in it what is between the anus and the testicles, and not in the middle, to the left of the birth: and let the cut be made above it, and your finger be in the anus: and let the cut be made transversely, so that it is wide outside, and tight inside, according to the quantity that it is possible for the stone to come out from there without being bigger.
Perhaps the finger, which is in the anus at the time of the cut, will press against the stone during the cutting, and will come out without difficulty.
And you should know that from the stone there are angles and edges, for this reason it is difficult to get out.
And from it there is something smooth, similar to a gland, and round: and the exit of it is easy.
So then to those who have angles and edges, add a groove.
If it does not come out in this way, then you should make use of: or stretch yourself over it with a wobbly gesture, whose end is as the Moon, which stretches over the stone and does not slip from it: or you should introduce under it a slim instrument, with curved ends.
If you cannot stretch on top of it either, then slightly enlarge the hole. That if something from the blood wins over it, cut it off with a scalpel while it is bleeding.
If the stone is more than one, then push into the first big one towards the anus. Then cut on top of it. Then push a little after it: and do likewise if there are more than two of them.
That if it is very big, then the cut on top of it will make it come off. Since this thing has happened to a man of the two things, or that he should die, or that he should have frequent urine passing: soon afterwards, because the place does not consolidate at all.
But give it an expulsion, until it comes out: or devices in the split of it with pincers, until you pull it out quickly.
When you have finished your operation, then fill the ulcer with thure, and aloe, and dragon's blood: and bind it well, and place over it a cloth dipped in oil and wine, or in rose-oil, and cold water: that so the pustule may be dried up by heat.
Then wrap the wound around the neck, and do not sever the ligature until the third day. When you have severed it, then smear the place with much oil and water.
Then care for the wound with the ointment of dye-fungus, and with the ointment of basilicon until it heals.
But if a warm pustule has been added to it, and it has corroded and there are similar things: for example, if blood has congealed in the bladder, and urine is prevented from flowing out of it: and it is known by the exit of blood with urine. Then insert your finger into the ulcer and extract the blood. For if it remains, it provokes corruption of the bladder and putrefaction of its contents.
Then wash the ulcer with vinegar, and water, and salt: and oppose to it all kinds of things that come with the cure, until it is healed.
And in the hours of the cure, two legs should be bound together and gathered up, because medicines that are laid on the spot should not be moved.
That if the stone is small and lies in the meatus of the urethra and is embedded in it, and prevents urine from flowing out: then care for the stone with it when you come to a section of it. For often after this cure, there will be no more difficulty in passing water, because I have tried it out many times.
And this is how you take the iron perforator, whose form is as follows: a sharp-pointed triangle, fixed firmly on a piece of wood.
Then take a thread and tie it to the penis under the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.
Then introduce the piercing iron into the penis with ease, until it reaches the stone; and draw back the piercing iron by your hand on the stone little by little; and examine the piercing, until you make him pierce from one side to the other.
You shall urinate immediately after this.
Then press your hand on what remains of the stone from the outside of the penis. It is itself broken, and emerges with the urine, and heals the wounded part.
But if this remedy is not suited to you for some reason that prevents it: then bind a string under the stone, and a string above the stone. Then dry up on the stone in the penis between the two ties. Then pull out the stone. Then loosen the tie, and clean up the frozen blood, which has accumulated in the wound.
And it is not necessary to tie the string under the stone unless you want to return it to the skin at your side: and the other string from above, unless when the string is loosened after the stone has come out, does not return the skin to its place, and closes the wound, as we have said. For this reason, you must tie the upper string so that the skin returns to its place, and covers the wound, as we have described.
Chapter LXI.
The Extracting of the Stone in Women.
The Stone does not form much in women.
But if any of them should have a stone: then the cure is difficult, and is prohibited on account of many things.
One of them is this: that the woman may not be a virgin.
And a second is that you do not examine a woman who takes medicine when she is chaste, or one who has husband.
A third is that you do not examine a woman who knows this art well, especially the operation with the hand.
And fourth is the distance from the stone's place: why does it need deep sectioning, and there is fear in it.
That if necessity compels to that, then you should take a woman doctor, well-versed in: and it is not often found.
But if you truly want her, then ask for a chaste doctor, subtile, and present a woman obstetrician well-versed in the matter of women's business, or a woman who has an interest in this art part: so make her present, and above all, that she does everything that you command her from inquiry about the stone.
In first place that is, that she inspects if a woman is virgin: then it is necessary that she puts her finger in an anum of her, and asks about the stone.
But if she finds it, let her grasp it under her finger, and then command the obstetrician, that he puts his own finger in the vulva of the unclean one, and asks about the stone, after he has put his left hand on the hair of the patient, and squeezes it with a good pressure.
But if she finds the stone, then it is necessary that she moves it gradually from the orifice of the vulva to the lower part with all her might, until she reaches it with him up to the root of the pelvis.
Then she shall cut on him at the opposition of the middle orifice of the vulva near the root of the pelvis, from whichever side it is prepared, and feels the stone in that part: and her finger should not remove from the stone, grasping under it: and let there be a small section first. Then she shall put the root on that section.
Then she shall put the root on that section. But if she feels the stone, then she shall add to the second section a quantity proportional to what the stone is exiting from her.
And you know that the types of stones are many. For from these there is a small one, and a great one, smooth and rough, long and round having branches.
Know his nature, so that he may be known to you through this that you see.
If therefore blood is making you sick, then add three drops of the place of poultice, and hold it for an hour, until the blood has dried up.
Then turn to your work again until the stone is discharged: and make ready for yourself from the instruments which I have said in the extraction of the stone out of the bladder, so that you may support yourself by means of them in your operation.
That if blood is making you sick, and you know that the flow of blood comes from an artery which has been cut: then put powder over the place, and tighten it with the powder as it dries up: and do not change that: and let go of the stone, and do not extract it. Perhaps, however, the woman will die who is weak. Then take care of the wound.
When, however, the sharpness of the pain has passed after a few days and the place is putrefied, then turn to your work again until the stone is discharged.
Head LII.
Regarding the cutting above the hernial opening with water.
Ram's water is not, unless a gathering of moisture in the alfalfa plant, which is under the skin of the testicle wrapped up in one piece: and it is called alfalfa.
And when it is in a sheet of its own nature, which has been prepared by nature on the skin: that is another thing, and that is the skin of the testicle between the alfalfa plant, which we have said: and that does not happen except rarely.
And the generation of this ramification comes from the weakness which happens in the testicles: why it is discharged towards them this substance. And when it comes to a blow on the testicles.
And this moisture is having many colors. Or, on the other hand, the color of it is veiled towards yellow, or is red, or green, black, or white, and that which is more is this.
And signs by which it is known where the aggregation of water is, are these. Nam si est in sifac albo quod diximus, tunc apostema est rotundum ad longitudinem parumper sicut figuraoui: et non apparet testiculus, quoniam humiditas continet eum ab omni parte.
And if there is moisture in the skin itself, then the hernia is round with a part like this, and therefore a man is estimated to be another one because it is round; [but] if there is humidity in the skin of the testicles, then the hernia is not round but flat, and therefore a man is estimated to be himself.
And if there is moisture between the skin of the testicles and the white skin (scrotum), then it hangs down.
When therefore you wish to know the color of the moisture, then feel for the color of the moisture in the hernia with the square insertion, whose shape preceded it. According to this, when it comes out into the fold of the insertion, judge about it that it is between itself.
When we come to the cure with a iron nail, then it is necessary that you order the sick person to have his blood let if it is possible for him to do so, and you will see his body full of blood.
Then he should lie down on his back on a high bed, and place many blankets under him.
Then sit down on his left side, and order the minister to sit down on his right side, who will stretch out his thigh towards two sides of the skin of the testicles, and towards the part of the pubic bone.
Then take a wide spatula and dry the skin of the testicles from the middle by its length, up to the breastbone; and make a section second by the equidistant line that divides the skin of the testicles, until it reaches the white skin (scrotum), and observe the scar, or gently cut it away so as not to cut it, and then examine the scar carefully according to its amount that you can do.
Then pierce the sinus with a wide bore hole and extract all the water.
Then separate the two lips of the incision with a hook and extend the sinus up to the top, and do not touch the skin that covers the testicles: and cut the sinus however it is possible for you to cut it, whether entirely or in part, especially its thin side. For if you do not examine it carefully, there will be no security in the incision, except that the water runs off.
But if one of them comes out from under his skin during your operation: then, when you have finished the incision of the sinus, reduce it in. Then bring together the two lips of the skin of the testicles with a stitch.
Then take care of the wound as you do with the other wounds, until it heals.
Which if one of the balls becomes corrupted from another color, then you should bind the organs that are suspended, fearing the flow of blood.
Then cut off the testicle with the suspender and extract it: then take care of it as we have said.
But if the water is collected on both sides, then you should know that there are two branches: so dry one side equally as you have done with the other.
And if it is even for you, so that the operation is one, then do so: then wash away the blood. And introduce a wet wool into the incision, or an oiled wool: and place another dry wool that you dipped in wine and oil over the two testicles, and spread it out under the ball: and place two double cloths on top of them, and they are soft: and bind them together above with a thread, which has six turns according to this shape.
Then two cloths are taken and inflated, and filled with crimson wool, according to this similarity: and the ends which are pressed by a bandage, or wet wool: and are joined together with a strap that runs between the shoulders of the arms: and one end takes hold on top of some bone up to the back, and the other end takes hold on the side of the pelvis: and both ends take hold on each side of the hips, and the whole bandage is joined in the lumbar brachium.
And, sometimes with an artificial knife and a cautery at the place of the cut with iron: and it is, that you take the cautery with a small razor, and separate with it the skin of the testicles: and it is ignited, according to what we have told: until such time as it finds the white sifac which contains water: then take the cautery, according to this form.
It assimilates Greek letters.
Then pierce with it that sifac, and it is ignited until all the moisture has gone out.
Then spread out that sifac with a hook, and scrape with the sharp cautery and cut it as well as you can, until you have cut all of it off.
And let the fire not touch him.
And you should know that this operation is more salutary, and further from the flow of blood, and better than the operation with a cut.
But if it causes you a contradiction in the hour of the cut, or in the hour of the cautery, hot or cold flow of blood, or anything else: then you should do what is opposite to that contradiction which you suffer with the cure which suits him, according to what has been said.
But if he is timid and does not await this operation, because of its horror: then administer the piercing according to what I have told you: it is done.
When you are certain of yourself with that which we have said about the meaning of the knife being moist: then you should make the sick person sit on an elevated chair.
Then pierce the apostema in the lower part of himself with a razor blade: and place the cut at the length of his body, and keep it open wide until all the water has run out.
Then put a towel over the place, and tie him up, and let him run to get the water out: then care for the wound, until the sore heals.
But if there is a contradiction in the discharge of water at the time when you pierce it: and there is no doing that except for this reason, because the white cloth causes a contradiction in the opening of the wound, and prevents the exit of the water: then you should put your finger into the wound, or use an instrument with which the water is drawn out, whose shape has gone before: or add to the operation of the wound.
And know that water returns, and is gathered after six months, or about them. So when it is gathered, then it returns in the same way, and the sick will pass through his days.
Chapter LIII. On the head.
On the care of the pink ramus.
You should know that with this ramus, if it is cut across here, it leads to danger in many conditions. Therefore I remove him from this ramus, lest he be saved from it.
And I remember the operation on it, and the appearance of aphasia.
I say then that many things happen in the bodies, from which the testicles are composed: and it happens for many reasons, indeed.
Or from acute excess, or sharp, which is secreted to the testicles. Or from a blow.
And the color of aphasia depends on the color of the body, and it is not felt to be painful: and the aphasia is gray.
And perhaps it is an aphonia of stone, whose color is dark, and there is no feeling for it.
And when it is from the knotting of the arteries, and their swelling: as I have already remembered about it; or from the swelling of the veins.
What is then from these, from the swelling of the arteries, is recognized by the disposition of aphasia when you squeeze your own fingers. And it is not necessary that you touch him completely.
That which is from the swelling of the veins, does not scatter anything from it when you squeeze with your fingers.
And also it is possible that this ramus, if it is cut across here, and on the other parts of the flesh: and it is, so as to separate the skin of the testicles. Then extend your hand upward, and pull out the skin with a siwach or a scissor: and release the suspension from the water, and tie the suspension to the limb: and cut the suspension after you have released the skin from all parts of the body.
If then my bone is well healed with those living muscles, then I should draw it towards me and strike at it.
And if an adhesion is between some of the sinews, or in it that is between the joints: then you should free all that adhesion and strike it with a round incision.
If however the birth of meat is in the place of the adhesion that is behind: then you should strike all of it and draw my bone out, as we have said.
When then your operation is complete, then you should fill the wound with wool infused with rose oil and wine: then take care of it with the rest of the cure, until it heals.
Chapter LXIV.
The Care for the Grapevine, which is with the Vine.
It is useful to have a blister covered with some blister-fluid similar to a blister made by a worm, with the softening of the testicles: it makes it difficult to move on an invalid, and exercise, and walking.
And in the cure for this illness there is a fear because of the recollection of that which preceded it.
But we should say the operation in it according to what the first did.
I will then say that you should make the invalid sit on an elevated seat. Then push the suspender of the testicles to the lower ones. Then hold the skin of the testicles with your fingers, with the fingers that are next to the scrotum: and let him hold them a minister, and stretch them with a strong extension.
Then strike with an acute blade in a transverse section through the middle of the joints, until they are detected.
Then scrub all parts, as we have told you in the extraction of arteries that are in the temporals.
Then fasten into them a nut where is a double filament, and tie it at the first place of the Grapes: and tie it again at the last place of them. Then dry it in a direct middle section according to the length of the body, and remove what is gathered from the corrupt foul humidities.
Then care for the scar with the cure of the remaining wounds, in which the life-giving force should be made to grow again, so that the clothes that nurture one testicle fall off. For this is not bad through that.
If, however, a vine grows in all the scabs, then it is necessary to remove them for this reason from the testicles with the scabs: so that they are not deprived of their nourishment, because of the incision, and do not wither or scar, and are not made into a wound with them.
Chapter LVI.
As for the cure of intestinal worm.
The end of this worms is from the section, which happens on the skin in a wide place under the groin between the testicles.
Why do the intestines come out from that break towards one testicle? And this break is either from the skin, or from the length of the skin.
And these two species arise from many causes: either from a blow, or from a jump, or from a sound, or from lifting up something heavy, and similar things.
And the mark, when it is from the length of the skin. It is what happens gradually over a long period of time, and does not happen suddenly: and it is a swelling equal to the depth: because the skin squeezes the intestines.
And the sign of it, when it is from the section of the skin, because it makes a sudden and painful pain start at its beginning: and it is a swelling different, appearing under the skin nearby: and that is because of the exit of the intestines, and their course to the external skin.
And when it comes out with the intestines in a twisted state: and this is called intestinal worm, and twisted one: and sometimes it happens with windiness.
And when it runs into the intestines of dung, and retains it there: and it is with that kind of worm that sickness and injury occur: because it makes a painful pain, especially when it is pressed.
For the cure of this disease with iron there is fear: for which reason care should be taken to avoid such a case.
And the method of operation is that you instruct the sick person to bring his intestines by hand into his abdominal cavity, if he obeys the return. Then let him lie down on his back between your hands: and wash his legs.
Then extend the skin that follows the skin to the upper part, and dry the entire skin of the testicles by its length. Then attach two sections of the skin with knots, according to which you open the section with them: and the section is arranged according to quantity, so that it can be removed from it.
Then scrape the skin and what is under the skin, until when it is touched, the skin is white, firm on all sides: then insert your index finger into it that follows the testicle, in that which is between the white skin, that is under the skin, and between the second skin, and separate with it the attachment that is in the rear part of the skin.
Then move with the right hand towards the inside of the testicle skin: and while doing so, extend the white skin upwards with the left hand: and wash the eggs with the skin on the side of the section: and instruct the assistant to extend the eggs upwards: and you should separate the attachment that is behind by complete solution.
And examine your fingers that nothing is there in it from the inside of the intestines that has been washed in the white skin or hard. If, however, something is still there: then push it towards the lower abdomen.
Then take the acume, in which there is a thick thread made from ten fils: and insert it between the last skin, that is under the skin of the testicles that follows the section: then cut off the ends that stand out from the thread, until four fils remain. Then put together some of them with a figure that is in the form of a cross: and bind them with the alsifach, from which we have spoken, because it is under the skin of the testicles with a strong ligature, until they cannot send any of their sweat to them, so that no fever is transmitted to them. And place again the second ligament outside the first ligament, distant from it two fingers. And after these two ligaments leave out of the fold, which is under the skin of the testicles, the size of a finger: and cut the rest all round, and take away it.
Then dry up in the lower part of the skin of the testicles, from which runs the blood and pus: as we have said above.
Then put the soaked wool in oil and place it on the scrotum: and administer the ligament that we have described. And when the fold of white fabric which we have spoken of is cauterized, after cutting it with care from the flow of blood. This often happens. And release the ligament, until it falls on its own.
But if this delay happens, then simmer with warm water: and place over it the one that we have spoken of, until it falls.
Then care for the scrotum with the remaining healing of the wound, until it is healed.
Chapter LVI.
This is a recipe for ramicin.
In this ramicin, I did not see anyone who dared to cure it with iron.
And first they said that it was done as we have spoken of the ramicin which is with wine. That is, so that the ligaments go down easily after cutting them from below: then dry up in the middle, and care afterwards with the opening of its own: until the ligaments fall; and care for the scrotum, according to what we have said, until it heals.
Chapter LVII.
Chapter about the incision made in the groin area.
When a rupture occurs in the groin area, as we have said, and there is an outlet, and does not go down to the testicles anything from the intestines: and if it goes down, it is little, and returns at all times: however, if it is prolonged over time, there is a rift in the fold, until the intestines come into the fold.
And that happens from the spread of a syph, which is in the groin, as we have said. That is, because the syph spreads out: then it softens, and the spot gets redder, and it oozes.
And the cure for it is with a cauterium, as has preceded its description.
And when he is cured with an iron, in this way: and it is so, that the sick one lies on his back between your hands. Then dry up the place of the rupture, the red spot, and the oozing out, with a section through its breadth, according to the quantity of three fingers.
Then tighten the ligature, and what is under the skin, until when it is detected that the syph of the white, which is under the skin that follows it, has been discovered.
Then take a ray, and put the person on the place where the oozing out is from the syph, and press the person down to the depth of the wrist.
Then suit two places of oozing out on the end of the ray from the syph, and join them with a stitch one to the other: then take away the end of the ray.
And do not at all touch the syph, nor pull out any one, nor any other, as I have told you in the cure for intestinal worms.
Then the cure for this cure of a wound. When you have cut the thread, then clean it out, and restore the bone, until it has been hardened.
The thread is broken, and no oozing out is added to the rupture.
And the cauterium is better in this place: because it is nearer to salvation.
Chapter LXVIII.
Regarding the softening of the skin of the testicles.
The skin of the testicles is sometimes softened in some people, because the flesh that is between them becomes softened, and its appearance is changed.
Therefore it is necessary for him who asks to be cured of it, that he lie on his back, and incise all the softened skin over the natural skin.
Then join the two lips together with a stitch: and if the eye, first of all, excess skin is softened by three or four stitches, and a firm stitch.
Then open between the stitches.
Then care for the cure of the other wounds, until they are healed, and let the threads drop off.
Head 99.
§ On castration.
You know that castration is excommunicated by our law; and for that reason it would be well if I should not remember it in my book here; and the remembering of it is not necessary except for two reasons.
Of which one is, that it may be in the knowledge of the physician when he is questioned about it: and so that he may know how to cure him who has had it happen to him.
And the other mode is that we often lack castration of certain animals for our own benefit through it, such as goats, horses, and cats, and similar from animals.
I say then, that castration is done according to two ways. Or by friction. Or by a slits and sections.
In that which is done by friction the course of operation is this: that we make the animal sit in warm water until his testicles become soft and loosen and hang down: then we strike them with our hand until they are completely broken and do not appear under the touch.
In castration however by a slit and sections, you must hold the animal, and press the skin of his testicles with your left hand.
Then tie the suspenders and dry completely on all one section, until when the two balls come out: then open them after you have dried them both, and do not let slip anything except the thin skin, which is over the scrotum.
And this mode of castration is better than that which is done by friction: for friction may leave some of the testicles behind, so that the animal desires to have sex.
Heal then the fracture until it heals.
Chapter LXX.
The treatment for hermaphroditism has two methods.
(Hermaphrodite is from a single testicle according to two modes.) (The male is from one testicle because it seems to follow a gap, or on the skin of the testes, between the two testes, in the form of a small woman, with hair: and sometimes urine flows from it from the skin of the testes.)
(But in women there is one form, and it is a small woman over the skin of the breast like a small testicle of the penis completely, prominent to the outside: of which one is like a penis of a man, and two like two testes.)
(And the treatment of three forms, two of a male and one of a female, is this: because you must burn away the added flesh, until you remove the impression of them.) Then heal these wounds with care.
(As for the second form of men, from which urine flows on the skin of the testes, there is no operation or cure at all.)
Chapter LXXI.
On the cutting of tenting and prominent flesh in women's genitals:
(The tenting should perhaps be added to the natural part until it is well fed and ugly in appearance; and sometimes becomes enlarged in certain women so much that it resembles a penis, and reaches up to the bed.)
(So you should hold back the excess of the tenting by hand, or with a hook, and cut it down; and not finally in the cutting, especially in the deep root: lest there be an outflow of blood.)
Then heal this wound with care until it heals.
(But the central flesh is that which is born in the womb of the mother until it fills itself up: and perhaps comes out to the outside according to the similarity of a tail: and for this reason certain call it sickly tail.) It is necessary that we cut into it as we did with Tentigine, and treat it until it heals.
On the treatment of a torn and unperforated hernia in a woman.
Chapter LVII. On the treatment of a torn and unperforated h
Hernia Alratica is either in a woman or a small hole. and it may be either natural or accidental.
Accidental is due to an earlier illness and may itself be either of native growth added, or a small thread-like substance, or a lump: it may be in the depths of the lake, or in its sides, or in its upper part, or in its lower part; and it prohibits coitus and fertilization, and childbirth, and perhaps menstruation.
And the knowledge of this is obtained by the examination of midwives, if the swelling is apparent and near.
If it is not apparent, then seek it with your fingers or a ray of light.
If the swelling is caused by a small thread-like substance and is near to the two lips: then bring them together, and unravel it.
And it is, as if you place two lips on a pair of woolen balls.
Then put your fingers from both hands together, and let the woman lie on her back with her legs spread wide. Then open the two lips firmly, until the small thread-like substance is unravelled and the swelling opens.
Then take a piece of wool, dip it in oil, and place it on the spot; and let the woman sit for all day so that the spot does not harden by other force.
If the thread-like substance is thick and dense: then it is necessary to separate it with a flat leaf of myrtle similar to a spatulum.
If the swelling is of native growth, then suspend it with a hook and cut it: and let there be with you medicines that will stop the flow of blood without biting, such as acacia and dragon's blood, and such aggregate with alum and chalk.
Then administer a large pipe from lead, so that the ulcer does not heal quickly, hold it for a few days: and administer lymph from dry linen, then cure the rest with the remaining cure, until it is healed.
And when ever a birth takes place in the womb of the mother there are births of other creatures; therefore they should take place according to this method: so that there is no contrario between iron and cancerous tumor, for cancer is not born in the womb with an opposite relationship to iron at all.
Chapter LIII.
On the treatment of hemorrhoids, Athelyl and Bochor's red rash on the genitals of women.
The hemorrhoids are an opening of the anal orifices, from which much blood runs frequently.
Now when the hemorrhoids have been long, they become thorns; and I have already, in the division of their species and the signs thereof, said here that which receives the cure, and that which does not.
I say, therefore, that the hemorrhoids which are in the opening of the womb, and do not appear to be sensible: then there is no cure for them with iron.
But those which are out of the womb, above which there is a sense, are those which are cured.
It is necessary that you should put the woman into a cold house. Then extend Athelyl with forceps or with a rough cloth, and cut them from their roots.
Then dust them over with a powder at the flow of blood from one that has been cut without mortifying it: as acacia and dragon's blood, and thistle, and such like to it.
Then push her feet against the wall for an hour. Then put her into cold water.
If the flow of blood persists: then make her sit in a decoction of sumach, and cutlar root, and gall, and such like.
Then take flour of barley, and make it into a paste with honey and vinegar, and make a ointment with it for her back.
If then blood is cut with it, it is good; and if not, let the back wound heal with a furrow and without scarification.
Then take a cloth and soak it in taraxacum juice, or arnica juice, or oak sap juice, that is, without taste, with Pontic wine, and let the back wound heal.
When then the apotheosis has subsided, then take care of the place with ointment, until it is healed.
Albarth is actually similar to red caps and is rough in appearance.
Therefore let it be known what appears from it, according to which I said in the litil equal: and take care of it, until it is healed.
Head 74.
Regarding the exit that happens in the womb.
In the womb there are many kinds of apotheosis, such as cancer, and a hard apotheosis, and sores, and blisters, and scabs, and worms, and warts, and roughness, and hot apotheosis.
And I have already said all these diseases and their kinds, and their signs, and their cures, in a division: it is necessary for me to say in this book about hot apotheosis which happens in the womb, when it is from apotheosis that collect blood, and to know how its opening takes place with iron.
Therefore let it be known. Then if the pain of apotheosis in its beginning is acute with its percussion, and flame, and fever: and you see it red: if it falls on top of itself, then do not like the opening of it: and take care of it with him so that he may please on maturation, until when it has subsided acuity of accidents.
Then let the woman sit on a seat that she may touch two chairs, and lean back, or lie down on her back, and put her feet towards the lower side of her body: and let her legs be spread out, and let her arms rest under her knees, and let her bind each leg with a binding that suits it.
Then let the midwife sit to the right rear, and let her administer the instrument with which she opens the womb's orifice.
And it is necessary when you administer this instrument that you hold it with the arm's depth towards the woman's womb, so that the thing that enters from the instrument does not enter more than the depth of the womb and hurts the weak one.
But if the instrument is more than the depth then it is necessary that you put the pulley on top of the depth of the womb so that the introduction of the instrument into all of the womb is prevented; and it is necessary that you hold the instrument, and turn back the pulley, which runs in the instrument, from the upper side: and that he holds the instrument, and turns back the pulley, until the womb'
So when it appears that it is coming out, and touches the hand, and is soft and smooth: then you must separate it from its head with a smooth edge.
So when the pus is drained then you must put the licinus, which has been dipped in rose oil', in the oil of violet", and put the licinus, and take out a piece from the depth of the womb.
And put the outside on top of the womb, and on the woollen cloth, which has been dipped in water, in which the salt has been boiled.
Then he will take care after two days with the ointment that suits it, until it heals up.
And when the womb is washed and the scar is so that it can be cleansed with water and honey: then he will return to the ointment.
Which if the scar is hidden inside the womb then it is necessary to prevent its cure with fire, indeed take care of itself with what we have said in division.
Head 76.
Doctrines of obstetrics, how they treat the fetus of a woman, according to the form that is not natural for the exit.
It is necessary for the obstetrician to recognize the natural puerperal form at first.
From the signs then, it is that when you see a woman compressing herself from below and wanting to smell the air and relieve herself because she feels the baby's exit on her, then you know that this birth is in the natural form, and its exit is above her head and with it the second, or suspended from the navel.
When then you see these signs, so it is necessary for the womb to compress, that the baby may descend quickly.
For when he has descended above his head, the second has descended with him, and it is cleansed from it with good purgations.
But if this birth is not like that, it is unnatural, unworthy of praise.
For when the baby has come out of his feet, and the body has come out in front of his head, and his feet and hands are one, or his foot or hand is: or when his head and hands have come out: or when the womb has come out: and perhaps it turns over on its neck, and similar signs that cannot be praised.
It is therefore necessary for the obstetrician to be prudent and cautious in all these matters, and to beware of error and deception: and I show you all the figures from them, and how the mind works in it, and signals it through it, and calls out on it.
When the baby has come out of his head with his natural exit, and he becomes heavy on the woman, and her birth is difficult, and you see her strength failing already: then make her sit down on a chair, or let women support her: and sprinkle her with fenugreek tea, and with wet oils.
Then the obstetrician will introduce his finger between her fingers a small spittle, and find with him the second, and dry it up with his nail until it is clean, and press the woman's womb, until the baby has come out.
If it has not come down, then a woman should be made to spit out the foamgrape mucus with sesame oil.
Then order her to compress herself after the enema, and have her sneeze with a condescending tone, and hold her nose and mouth for an hour. For fear that the fetus will come out at once.
What if two hands of the fetus come out first, then it is necessary that you reduce them with ease gradually. If she does not obey when led into, then place the woman on a chair, and raise her feet up: then push the chair down on the ground: and let the woman hold on, so that she does not fall by the jolt.
If then the hands do not come out, and the fetus dies: then cut them open, and remove the residue of the fetus: and bind her hand with a cloth, and remove it with equality: for he will come out.
Exit of the embryo on his own feet. When the fetus comes out on his own feet, then it is necessary that you push him up: and gradually turn the fetus over: and then make him even.
Then take one of her feet, and stretch it out gradually.
For when they have come out as far as the hips, then order her to compress herself, and have her sneeze with a condescending tone: for one will come out if God wills it.
And if he does not come out with what we have described, then gradually reduce the fetus, until you put him back in his natural shape. For he will come out then by an easy exit.
What if you stop completely all that we have described: then take from the foamgrape, with sesame oil and a dissolved gum: and strike it all in a mortar with a good hammer: then let a woman's ulna hit it from below, and her feet. Then I make him sit in tepid water until the hypochondriac becomes visible.
When you see that his lower parts have already become warm, then make him sit on Myrrh and support him. When he has held the seat for an hour, then I make her sit on a chair. Then I make him sneeze: and tightening his mouth and nose, I press the lower part of his leg with a gentle compression. For the heat will soon come out.
Exit the fetus over the knees and hands. When it comes out in this form, then she will come by slowly inserting her hands. Then the woman should lie on her back and hang her feet down to the ground: and she herself should lie on a bed and interlace her hands. Then I press upon her belly little by little. Then I pull out what is under her feet from the armpits until it is prepared in the lower part. If the fetus does not come out, then take her feet and move them violently. Then I press what is above the hypochondria little by little until the fetus rises to the upper parts. Then he should interlace his hands and smooth the fetus little by little: and he should order the woman to compress, until the fetus comes out.
Exit the fetus hanging from the arms. He should be prevented from reducing his hands. If he cannot reduce it, then the woman should be rubbed and made to walk.
But if walking is not possible, then make her lie on a bed: and shake her legs violently.
Then administer the ointment which you have prepared from mucilaginous substances.
If she accepts the birth, then make her sit on a chair. Then study the reduction of her hands and the fetus in a natural position: and make the woman sneeze, and order her to compress herself, until she comes out.
The baby's head comes out above its shoulder, with its hands spread wide, and its face turned towards the back of its mother's body. It is necessary that the obstetrician hold the baby's hand, then turn it gradually and easily.
But when it has become calm, then place it on its back that we spoke of with oil and mucus.
Then order him to move his arms slowly. But when you have done this, then make her sit down on a seat, and order her to lean against the right side. Then order him to compress himself: and make him sneeze with a handkerchief.
The prepared baby is on the side. When it descended into the mother' s opening in this way with the second, then cut the second with your finger, until it is discharged from the moisture.
But if he should hang above the baby' s face and its neck, then cut him from the umbilical cord: lest he hold on and die.
Then push the baby into the insides, until you place it as is necessary: and order the woman to compress herself sometimes: for he will come out easily.
The exit of twins, or of many babies. You know that twins are often born: and sometimes three, and four. But that is unusual, and seldom happens.
Five is a thing outside nature, and they do not live long apart: and it holds them together, however they multiply, only two at a time: and separates them by the scaph, distinguishing between them with tied cords around each of their navels.
And when they go out as does one baby from a natural exit easily: and they go out with a loud noise, as we have told.
That if any of them are difficult at the time of birth, and seek to go to that which we have spoken from unnatural figures, then take care of them as we have told: and let it sit on a soft cloth, and do what it does easily and tardily, and make it take all shapes with it as it is prepared by nature leading to salvation.
Remembering that he is formed in the womb from embryos and is aborted.
When he is formed in the womb one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and more than ten: and I have already verified it with myself that a woman who aborts has emitted seven, and another fifteen, all formed.
That which was measured by the glorious sage.
This then is what should be understood in the science of obstetrics. For it may perhaps come to that which is similar to it: then oppose it with it that which is necessary
Chapter LXVII.
On the extraction of a dead fetus.
When you are concerned with the extraction of a dead fetus as I have said in the division on surgery and do not exit, and you urge that you use the hand operation, then you should consider.
If then the woman is of sound virtue and is not with any of the accidents from which she fears destruction: then it should be that the woman reclines on her bed, on her back, and has her head inclined downward, and her legs raised: and he should hold her by two sides, or tie her to the bed, so that her body is not extracted along with the extraction of the fetus.
Then moisten the mother's mouth with moist oil with mucilaginous althaea, and fenugrecum, and flax seed.
Then the midwife should wash her hands with these oils and mucilages: then she should enter the woman' s womb with ease. Then she should ask where to place the knot of the fetus, and the suitable places for it.
Then consider, if the fetus is prepared to descend over its head: then place the knot in her eyes, or her throat, or her mouth, or her palate, or under her beard, or in her neck, or in the places adjacent to the ribs, and beneath the hip bones.
If however the descent is over his feet, then in the chest, and his ribs in the middle.
And it should be that he holds the awl with his right hand: and lays the wound on himself between the fingers of his left hand: and inserts with ease, and fastens the awl in one of those places which we said, until he has reached the hole.
Then fasten on the other side of his awl, or a third, if you are able to: so that it is equal contraction, and does not decline to the side.
Then let it be extended with an equal extension, and does not extend only according to the rectitude, but also move on all sides, so that it relieves his exit: as happens when a tooth is removed in the process of extraction.
And should be in him who is between that, so that the extension is softened. That if a part is retained from him, then it should be that the midwife puts some fingers with oil, and inserts them on the side, so that they rotate with it, because it holds.
If then a part of the fetus comes out, then change the awls to another place that is higher: do this until the whole fetus has come out.
If then a hand comes out ahead of the other, and it is not possible to reduce it by coarsening: then should be that a cloth is wrapped over it. Then draw it out until when all is coming out, cut it or insert it into the socket of the hand, or into the bed: and so should you do to the other hand, and to the two feet.
If then the head of the fetus is large, or has a coarsening during its exit, or there is water in his head: then should be that it inserts between the fingers of the Spatulimile spinosum, and finds with it the head, and draws out the water: or breaks it up with an instrument called Almisdach: whose shape comes with the forms of other instruments in the following chapter.
Similarly, if the fetus has a large head, then the umbilical cord should be cut: or else it should be pulled out with the hand, as we have said. Then, pull out the bones with forceps.
If the head comes out, and the cord is around the neck: then cut off, until the moisture which is in the chest is let out.
If it is not complicated, and does not submit to delivery: then cut off the head prematurely, as far as you can do it.
If the lower limb is deformed, or there is hydrops in it: then you should cut off the member, until the moisture which is in it has run out.
But if the fetus is above its feet, then the attraction of it is easy, and the direction of it towards the mother's mouth is gentle.
But if the cord is around the gut, or the chest: then you should take a piece of cloth which you have on your hand, and cut off the member, until the moisture which is in it has run out.
If other limbs are also taken away, and then the head comes out: then let the midwife put her left hand in. But if the mother' s mouth is open, then let the woman put her hand in deep into the vagina, and look at the head, and attract it with her fingers up to the mouth: then let her put in a hook, or two hooks, and attract it with it.
If the mouth of the mother is closed, because of the hot swelling which has happened to it: then it is not necessary that she should work on the fetus, but rather at that time you should administer to her the flowing fluids, thick: and apply plasters: and let her sit in water which softens and moistens.
If the fetus is above its side, then it is possible that it will be quiet: then administer to it what we have said about a single fetus.
If it is not possible to do so, then incise quickly and remove it.
And you should not leave anything inside at all after the second incision.
Since you have completed your operation, then administer what we said in the apostemes of the hot things that happen in the wombs.
If a flow of blood occurs, then let it go down in water of rigor, and administer the remaining cure.
And I have already seen a woman, in whose womb the fetus was dead: and then she became pregnant again on top of that same womb, after which the other fetus also died. So it happened to her after a long time that an apostema appeared in her navel, and it swelled up until it was opened, and it began to discharge pus.
So I was called to her cure, and I treated her for a long time: and the wound did not heal.
I then placed over it some strong adhesive plasters: and it came out of place from the mouth. Then a few days passed, and another outlet came out from her mouth. I was amazed then that there is no outlet in the womb when there is an outlet in the mouth.
I thought, since there are bones of a dead fetus.
I inquired about the wound, and I pulled out many bones, while she was in a better state of health: and now she did not live for such a long time, and she began to discharge pus from the site little by little.
And I do not make this foreign to you, unless there is knowledge and aid for it, which the skilled healer can administer with his hand in the cure.
Chapter LXVII. On The Head.
On Forms Of Instruments Necessary For The Extraction Of The Fetus.
The form of the jaw opening.
Here is the form of the Strigulator, which are joined at equal intervals to two rods, with two twines. However, this vertigo should be made less coarse than the striga, and so it is made either of ebony or of wood from the buss tree.
And let the width of all the wood be as wide as two fingers: and the margin of each of them is as wide as a finger, and their length is as a palm and half; and in the middle of the two woods there are two additions of the same kind of wood, which have already been set firm on both, the length of which is the half of the palm and slightly more; and the width of each is almost two fingers, or slightly less.
And these two additions are inserted into the jaw bone, so that it opens with them when you turn your two wheels.
There is another one similar to it, which is smaller and lighter.
Let it be made of ebony wood, or pine wood, according to the similarity of the claws. However, at the end there are two additions, as you can see here above: and the length of each of them is almost a palm: and the width of each is that of two fingers.
But when you open the jaw with it, then make the woman sit on a bed, her feet hanging down, open what is between her shoulder blades. Then insert these two additions joined together into the jaw: and you, holding the end of the instrument between her thighs. Then open your hand with the instrument as you do with the claws, equally according to the quantity that you wish by opening the mouth of the jaw, until the midwife does what she wants to do.
The form of the second wheel, which is different from that which the ancient people spoke about, as it pushes forward the fetus.
The form of Al-Misdar, by which the great head is turned: and resembles the claws, with teeth at the end, as you can see.
And when it is turned inwards, as the claw does according to this form, as you can see, with teeth like a saw, which cuts and turns inside.
Form a Vncinis with one spine.
Form a Vncinis with two spines.
Form a scissor with two ends for cutting off the head.
Also form two scissors for holding open.
These instruments are all used and the more their kinds multiply and they are prepared for use by artifice, the quicker they are in their work and the higher they stand among men because of their number.
Do not then despise these instruments, even if they do not exist with you; rather, have them prepared for you. It is not excusable to need them.
Head 78.
§ On the Extraction of the Second.
When the second is retained at childbirth, then you must take care to hold back the weakling so that it does not hold its breath. Then make her sneeze with a squeeze; and tightly grasp your hand over her nose. If then she comes out through this, it is good.
If not: then take a club, and pierce through the roof; and put in it herbs opening the mouth of the mother, such as calamus, rue, aniseed, camomile, chamomile, and cassia bark, and some of these herbs; and dip them in water, and place them on the fire.
Then put a twig of hawthorn on the hole in the roof, and another end at the mouth of the mother; and let her hold it until the steam from the birth has cooled down.
Then make her sneeze, as we have said. The second is then born with ease.
If, however, it remains after this care and does not come out: then instruct the Midwife to dip her hand in sesame oil or mucilaginous aloe. Then he inserted himself into her vagina and inquired about her second birth. So when he found her, then he took her, and he slowly stretched her out.
But if she is attached in the depths of the womb, then he should insert his hand, according to what we have said above, until such time as he finds the second one and gradually pulls it out according to the straightness so that the womb does not fall due to a sudden pull: at the front it should be exchanged with ease from right to left: then it is added in quantity. For she will obey then and spread herself out, and she will separate herself from the adhesion.
That if the opening of the womb is constricted, as we have already related: take care of it with a sternutation, and from the medication of the wound with herbs.
But if she does not come out with all that we have said above, then take care not to tire her out in the process of extraction.
But it is necessary for what comes out at the opening of the womb from her to be tied up on the woman's thigh. Then clean her with a four-part ointment. For this will make her rot and dissolve after a few days, and she will come out.
But when it is rotten, a bad smell comes out of it towards the stomach and head, and it hurts that part. It is necessary then that appropriate suffumigations be administered to her.
Some of the ancient ones who have already been experienced are the suffumigations of mustard and dried figs.
Form a tool with which to suffume the woman during the retention of the second birth and the months.
Let it be made from a similar wool or from hemp: and let it be placed on a wide end over fire: and the suffumigation should be placed on plums: hold it, until that suffumigation is consumed: and then take another one.
Chapter LXXIX.
As for the treatment of women who have not been penetrated.
Many boys were born, and their hams were not pierced, which the sutures of the delicate sirocco had already opened. It is necessary that the midwife pierce that sirocco with her finger: and if she does not, she should pierce it with a sharp spatulim: and let her beware of touching the snake, lest she be bitten.
Then put a woolen cloth, soaked in wine and oil, on top of it. Then care for the wound with ointment, until it heals.
But if you guess that he is drunk, then put a lead plunger in the hole for many days, and remove it when the boy wishes to defecate.
And it also happened that the boys were drunk because of the concusiveness of the wine or pus. It is necessary that you remove that consolidation, and then care for it with the above-mentioned things after removing it.
Chapter LXXX.
Regarding the cure of fistulas that occur in the lower part.
Fistulas that occur in the lower part are a nodding and grossness which occurs near the anus of a particular animal: or in the space of one part: and there is one fistula, or many.
When that grossness is cured, it opens, and from it issues a watery moisture of white pus or a subtle pus.
And when they are penetrating from these fistulas. Thus the penetrating ones are recognized by that which issues from defecation, and their wetness, when a person with an illness defecates: and perhaps they issue from them naked.
And there are fistulas from which they penetrate into the space all the way to the bone, and up to the vertex of the hip. And some of them penetrate all the way to the joint of the hip, and up to the root of the tail.
From that one from which the penetrating fistula all the way to an animal is recognized, and also not from a non-penetrating one, is, when you put your index finger into the anus: and try to push a thin piece of metal or brass into the fistula: if there is no tortuosity.
If there is a twist in it, then insert into it a thin probe, or a nail from the nails of the equines, until you feel it trying, or a nail in your finger.
If you do not feel it thoroughly, and there is no discharge from the wound, nor any pus, nor is it as I have said: then know that it is not penetrating: therefore approach again to the cure.
And when the fistula penetrates as far as the skin, or to the bladder: then the sign of it is the flow of urine from it, and its prohibition from this so that the place with the medicines consolidates.
If it penetrates as far as the joint of the hip, or to the jaw: then the sign of it is that it reaches with a probe as far as there, if there is no twist in it up to the jaw: and there is pain on the circumference of the part, and pus always comes out from it: and that it does not scar with ointment, and consolidates.
And in all these fistulas which penetrate completely there is no cure at all: and the cure of them is work and vanity to him from foolish doctors, on whom a form is made up.
In that one, or if it is not penetrating, and is not ancient, there is hope for a cure with a knife: for I tell you, and I have tested this myself: and it is, so that the sick man lies in your hands on his back: and trim the legs of him up to above his hips, and his hips are bent towards his venter. Then insert a probe or air, if it is a twist fistula, until you know where the probe reaches.
But if he feels it on a certain part, then you should put your finger on that part.
But if you feel the probe already penetrate itself by your finger, besides that you feel it between your finger and the skin, or flesh: then know for sure that it is penetrating: so do not work on it, because its cure is not as I said.
They said that he heals some people's flesh, and from the medicine which he hopes will benefit them, it is as if he sets fire to a cautery of fine fire according to the width of the fistula, as has been said before, and he inserts it in the fistula until it reaches a certain point. Then he does this again twice or three times, until you know that all the added filtered flesh, which is like a feather, has dried up and become similar to a feather.
Then he cares for that with liniments soaked in butter until the dried-up flesh comes out: and then he cares for it with ointments that generate meat and consolidate it.
If then he heals, it is good.
And if not, then he does not heal with any other cure ever.
And if it comes out and does not reach your finger, which is in the anus, and is between it and a hard piece of flesh or a blade: and you see a fistula on it that follows the skin's surface, then dry off the skin from the beginning of the fistula, and dry out with the towel what is in the fistula, until you reach the place where the end of the towel reaches, and let the towel fall and drop.
Then clean those filtered flesh, which are like a feather, so that nothing remains of them.
If however the blood hurts you, and dissolves between you and your surgery so that it solves those flesh: then it is better if it happens, and quicker in its benefit, to cauterize it with fire, or with sharp medicine.
For the cautery with fire brings good habits together, to the burning of that flesh which is added, and to the stopping of blood, and drying up of moisture.
Then he cares for that with liniments soaked in butter, or with crushed leaves, until the place gives off pus, and dried-up flesh comes out in the pus.
Then the cure for the scar when the wound has hardened with ointments, producing hard flesh: and there are medicines in which are stigmatis and drying out.
For when it is being treated, then it is being healed: and do not put off repetition.
But if the fistula has reached to a great depth of the anus, and has elongated from the excess fluid of the body: then insert your finger into the anus, and feel with it.
But if you feel a pulsatillenesse and between yourself and her is some kind of a defect, or flesh, and is near to penetration: then there is no operation in that, unless by the second time of confidence and hope.
That is, because it is done in him one of the two ways: or as it is cauterized itself, as we have said: or separate it, until the consequence of its concavity comes about, so that it is possible for you to introduce a scalpel, and cure from nearby. And do not proceed much with the incision, lest you fall into the trap of the continous anus, and happens on to a premature death of exhaustion without will. Then the cure for that with him which we have said.
Perhaps it will be healed: or will elongate the defect, and clean it up all the way to near the anus, as we have said, or with a probe, or with another acute end of an instrument. Then clean those filthy meats which are in the incision, all the way to where you can with examination.
Then try to restore the wound of the whole limb with the incision, and the opening where it hardens: and remains a fistula open on the inside part of the anus, and will be lighter on to the premature death.
And when the fistula follows this way: and is, when you introduce a probe into the fistula: and is on the side of the anus near to the surface of the body with skin and the margin of the anus: then take hold of the probe's sharp end, which is like an accusative, that is, a preparative tool, according to this form. And introduce into it a thread uncoiled from five threads, and wrap it around. Then introduce the thread with a hook into the fistula, until you feel its tension.
If then it is penetrating into the margin of the anus internally nearby, then remove the thread from that opening: so that you can introduce your finger in anum, and remove the end of the thread, and gather both ends together at once: and tighten both of them, and let it go one day, or two days: and to the extent that the thread bites into the flesh, tighten it well, until those muscles which are between the two ends of the thread fall down: then take care of the wound, until it hardens, and heals.
If, however, the opening of the fistula is not penetrating: then make it penetrate in whatever way you prepare it for yourself, unless it is in a deep place. For indeed it is not yours to do such a thing, so that you don't hurt yourself itself.
Then do with it as we have said, until it heals.
The shape of the sharp needle where the fistula is found, whose curvature is acute greatly, and its other side is not acute, so that it does not hurt that which is not necessary, as you see.
Chapter LIII.
Of the suture of hemorrhoids, from which runs blood from their incisions: and take care of the fissures.
There are hemorrhoids according to two ways. Or indeed they are inside the anus, similar to charcoal, or like plums: or almost like small grains. And of them there are some little ones and some big ones: and blood runs from them always, and there is one, and many. And they are outside the anus, and at its ends.
Indeed these that are outside the anus, are according to most part few of moisture, from which runs yellow water, or a little blood with constant course: and they are according to color of the body.
And the cure of that which is within the anus, you should instruct the sick person to straining; and it should be expressed until it comes out, and appears atheneum to you. Therefore therefore and hang with hooks: or hold them with your fingernail. Then therefore cut them at their roots.
If however they do not retain hooks, because of their moisture and their own softness: then take them with a rough cloth, or with a twine made of double-twined wool, and pull them out with your fingers. Then cut them and sprinkle over them after the cut some warm powders so that they remain in place of cauterization. Or cauterize them according to what has preceded in the chapter on cauterizing. Then care for them with the remaining cure, until they are healed.
That if the anus does not obey the ejection, then clench the sick with a small clister in which is a little mordicatio, so that it soothes with it what is in the ano, and obeys the ejection more quickly when it is expressed by the sick.
If however atheneum have been taken out of the ano, then the business is lighter and easier: and it is as if you were to take them with your fingernail, or take them with a hook, and cut them. Then care for them with what we have said, until they are healed.
And who hates cutting with iron, then you should administer to them a sutura in the following way. Take a silk thread, and insert it into the anus. Then pull out the atheneum upwards, and let it penetrate with the needle into the root from the other side; and wrap the two ends of the silk thread around the lower part of the needle, and spread them out: and tighten the atheneum with a strong knot. Then tie off the silk thread, and pull out the silk thread.
Do this to all the atheneum, and leave one alone: and let his own be drawn out, so that it carries away the redundancy of blood.
Then put a certain cloth soaked in rose-water, or neroli-water, on the part; and put the same on the part itself; and order the sick one to lie down. Then let him lie down until he has fallen asleep.
When the wound has therefore closed, take care of them with ointment, and with the other treatment, until they are healed.
§ On the treatment of wounds. For often accidents happen because of drying up of stool, and constriction of nature.
When they have been a little while wet, and do not suffer from medicine: then let them be scrubbed with the sponge of Spongia, or with your own finger, until they are moist, and let go off them the upper layer which prevents their being consolidated. Then take care of them, until they are consolidated according to what is necessary.
But if they do not consolidate: then repeat the scrape with a more rough sponge than before, until they bleed much, and then take care of them, until they are healed.
§ On the treatment of putrid wounds, and not putrid ones: and on the care of sore-mouth, and of swelled lips.
Chapter LIII.
Know that Almirmar is only a round knot according to the color of the body, similar to a claw's head: and it happens in the whole body, especially in the lower parts of the feet and fingers: and it causes pain on walking.
Then let it be cut off what is in the circumference of the claw, and held with forceps, or with a hook, and Root it out from its root.
Then take care of that one: and if you have a caustic, treat it according to what has gone before in his chapter.
But from the sore-mouth there is only one little excellence, rough, filtered, round on the surface of the body. And often it happens in the hands of boys.
And its treatment is, that you spread out the sore-mouth, and let it fall; or that you tie it with silk thread: or with hair, until it falls down. And if you see [a wound], cauterize it according to what has been said above with fire, or with sharp medicine; and now the athelias that are imposed are eradicated, and not imposed with an instrument that I call.
But the ant is also a prominent little filter, coarse, on the surface of the body, wetting it deeply; and when it comes to coolness, it feels in it a similar stinging of an ant, and becomes in the whole body; and much of it is made in the hands.
And its cure is that you take a tube from the beak of a goose, or a strong vulture's beak; and put that tube on the ant, until it holds a circle of the tube from its parts. Then you will turn your hand with the tube, until you separate what is in the circumference of the ant; and put it in the depth of the flesh, and you eradicate the ant from its root.
And if you see it, do it with the tube of air or iron, according to this form.
Let the tube sit on top of the palm with a small piece of skin pulled, so that it does not hurt the touch of its grip and its retraction.
And if you see it, cauterize the ant according to what has been said above in cauterizing Athelil in the chapter on cauterization.
Chapter Liii.
About forms of instruments that are administered to clisters in the ailments of the bird, and the solution of the spring, and colic.
When the clister is made of silver, or of gold-plated brass, or of ordinary brass, or of hammered brass.
And when it is made from these small instruments, and from the large ones, according to those in which they are administered.
So then what is administered in the cure of young boys who are weak, or those who are sick, so that their clisters are weak too.
The large clister.
Cistere paruum.
The cysts in the lungs are wide and round. The opening of the cysts is wide enough for a small piece of cloth or a feather to pass through; their base is rounded. The opening of one side should be closed, that is, not open, smooth, slightly curved, and reaching down towards the hip. On one side there are two openings, and on the other side there is one opening.
And many holes are pierced in the cysts, as it were, and there is a space that is the width of a finger between each hole. Then introduce into these holes a strong thread made of raw silk, which has ten threads, or a little more, and tie it together with the same thread. When this cloth is placed in the cysts, tighten it in the top part of the cysts with a strong knot between two distinctions. Then tighten the cloth.
And this is the shape of a circle as it is depicted here, and the holes.
The quality of tightening the cloth is this: fill it with a medicine from the pharmacy that has been heated according to the tolerance of the nurse; and do not make it too hot or too cold.
Then the sick person should lie on his back, and raise his legs up; and place something under him, that is, a mattress above which the people sleep, or a blanket.
Then dip the tip of the cloth in oil, or in alum, or in mucus of fenugreek, or like it. Then introduce it into the anus easily. Then take a servant with his two hands and squeeze it hard until all that is in the cysts has been discharged into the intestines.
Then remove the cloth, and raise the sick person's legs up towards the wall.
If medicine can save him to the end, then he should hold on as long as possible. And if he sleeps with her all night, it is even more of a last resort in healing.
But if you enema him with a solution of the sixth water and his death is imminent: then do another enema until he is healed.
That if there are hemorrhoids or itching painful blisters then do a mild enema frequently, gently, from the enemas with which the boys are enema
And this should be the form of a gentle enema over which there is a strict skin.
Chapter LIII. Of the treatment of head wounds without fracture of the bone.
I have already said in the division of the treatment of wounds which concerned the book, and I say here the cure of these with the hand, and with the help of doctors according to the second aid.
I say, therefore, that wounds differ according to the cause of their being, and according to the place on which they fall.
Therefore the wounds that are often caused, are like shots of stones: or cuts of a knife, or a blow with a lance, or a piece of wood, or an arrow: and similar things from many other things.
But wounds that are caused according to the places of the body are, such as a wound that falls on the head, or the neck, or the chest, or the belly, or an organ: and similar ones from the members.
And I am telling the treatment of certain wounds, that I may set forth the reasoning and rule for the remaining wounds.
And I shall begin with simple head wounds: because the memory of the teacher will come at the beginning of Chapter III.
I say, therefore: When it comes to a simple wound on the head, and there is no fracture of the bone: then consider if it is from a shot of stone, or similar, and has broken the skin only: and it is a severe wound, and fear about the outcome of blistering fever: then make an immediate phlebotomy on the head: and do not delay that: and draw out his blood according to the quantity of its virtue: if there is no prohibition from phlebotomy, especially if it is the blood that flows out from the wound a little. And let the bleeding come from the opposite side of the wounded part.
And let the bleeding come from the opposite side of the wounded part. Let the sick person avoid food, wine, and heavy meals.
But if there is a need to restrain something, then let it be restrained from food, and not approach meat or wine.
And place over the wound if there is a feverish condition, hot poultice with infused oil in rose water alone, or with wine where there is a stenosis.
But if you are free from a feverish condition, then place over the wound if it is new with its own blood, and has not changed its air, the powder which I will describe after a little while: and if it has already changed its air, then place over it some ointment, until it is healed.
But if the wound is large, or is from an incision of a sword, and similar: and its lips are not gathered by poultices, then gather it with a stitch, according to what I will describe in wounds of the leg about their stitches.
But if the wound has already been detected from a bone, and hangs, and there is no retention of it, except in a small suspender: then incision that wound. Then care for the wound with medicines, and restore it to its place of tough skin, and order the sick person to eat food in which there is a fermentation, such as heads of animals and cooked wheat, until it becomes like a pulse: and let them eat similar things.
That if the wound is in the skin and does not adhere to the bone: then incision all that part which is putrefied, and throw it away: and then care for it.
But if there is an artery in these wounds, or a new one from which blood flows: and does not become separated by medicines, then inquire about the artery. But if you do not cut that wound, then dry it up with Spike-root, or bind it up. That if necessity forces you to do this before what I have said is done, then burn it, until blood stops flowing from it.
If, however, these wounds are small and simple, then the matter is easy and light: so that the powder applied to them can be easily absorbed: because it solidifies before it changes by air.
The method of the powder for healing wounds. Take a part of olibanum, and two parts of dragon's blood, and three parts of non-extinguished limestone: all are to be well mixed together, and sieved: then fill it with the powder, and bind it firmly in place until it sticks well to itself and congeals with blood.
Then tie the powder above it, and leave it, and do not remove it until it has remained in place: so that it does not crumble. For the medicine will not be removed from it until it is healed.
And when this lime is made alone by itself, when you do not have on hand olive oil either, and dragon' s blood also makes the same operation in many large wounds when it is put on them and bound together, and are recent wounds with their own blood, which has not been changed by air.
That if the air has already somewhat altered it, especially when it is in the summer season, then the intention of this powder is not in place: so take care to put on it some digestible ointment that we have mentioned, or put on it a paste made from barley flour, prepared with water and honey, until pus is discharged. Then take care of the rest with the usual cure, until they are healed.
If, however, there is a broken fracture of a bone and it is small, then extract it with the help of a hook: for I will now speak about the treatment of fractures of the skull.
Regarding wounds in the neck area.
If a wound has occurred in the neck, then there is no difference in treatment between it and a wound of the head, when the latter is simple.
But if the incision has already reached the nerve of the neck or an artery: then if it is a nerve, there is no skill in it, unless treatment with it causes a harsh constriction, like the cinchona and other such things. For they harm the nerves, and turn them back.
And do not put any cold thing on a wound at all: for the substance of the nerves is cold, and their extension is with the brain, which is an exalted member of the body: and let such a one be cured with medicines of softness, as the lime, when it is poured out with sweet water sometimes infused with oil, or with rosin oil, and turpentine, when it is washed also with sweet water: and other mineral stones, in this fashion, and humid unguents.
But if the wound is large, then administer a stitch: or cover its lips with dust. Then take care of yourself, until you are healed.
But if the wound is deep, or has occurred a pocket of pus in its lower part, then pierce it in a more depressed place.
That if the incision has already reached the nerve of an artery, and the flow of its blood is followed: then separate it, or dry it up, and bind it: or burn it, if necessity compels to do so.
But if the incision has already reached the spine's joint, or all of it, and so on as if it were a horse's joint: then join the skin's lips together with a stitch over the joint, and do not touch the joint, but rather make it fit the natural form. Then tighten it with a tightening that decreases gradually, and leave it for a few days. Then take care of yourself with unguents that cause dryness and healing.
But if the wound has already made an impression on the bone, then examine it: then if there are any fragments of bone, remove them all, or as many as you can: and what is not prepared, leave it, until the wound decays, and separates and discharges its excrement.
If the wound is fresh, then dust the powder on top of the powder that I have laid down. But if it is a case of a broken bone and a fistula: then take care of it with the Remedy that comes in the chapter about it.
On Wounds in Spatulas.
If the wound is caused by a lance or a knife, and you can see its depth, then examine it carefully. But if there is a flow of pus from the wound, and the patient groans because of it, then know that the wound is mortal.
But if it is not deep and is fresh with its blood: then do not put the powder on it at first hour, nor bind it up so that the blood does not hold in its depth and returns to the heart and makes him sick; but put on it a attracting ointment and undo it twice a day.
But if you do not have the ointment present, then put on the wound a used cloth, so that it sucks out what comes from it by moisture: and let the patient sleep on the wound so that what is gathered in it runs out.
But if three or more days have passed since the wound and there has been no spasms, no bad tremor of the heart, no tightness in breathing, and the other signs of it are good, then know that the wound is healed. Take care of it and with ease, and with the rest of the cure, until it is healed.
But if the healing of it is slow and it opens again always, then know that it has already become a fistula. Take care of it from the chapter about it.
And if the bone is from an incision of a sword or a knife, and it is simple on the surface of the back, or the back of the neck: then take care of the wound with the Remedy that preceded it from the sutura, if it is large: or with powder, if it is small.
If, however, he has already made an impression on the bone and has struck out from it a piece of fracture: then inquire about the rib, and approach towards extracting those fractures if they are separate. If, however, they are not separated, then let them go until the rib has putrefied, for the extraction of these will be облегчена.
But as regards the remains of injuries and accidents in the remaining members, it is a question of judgment in the treatment, which I have mentioned.
Regarding wounds in the belly and the exit of the intestine and the exit of them.
The rupture that has occurred in the belly is great, medium, and small.
So then when and how often the intestine emerges, or the number of intestines.
Why do they get mixed up, and their sewing is more painful and difficult?
And the small rupture also is difficult from another mode. So then, in order that the reduction of them may be more difficult, if you do not hurry up to bring it back to its place: for it swells, opens, and thickens: why does entry into it become difficult?
Therefore the middle disruption is better than the small one: for since the reduction of the intestine is not difficult, as it is difficult to reduce these two species.
Know that the縫合 of the belly is according to four ways.
The two common sutures meet in the Suture of the belly and in the Suture of the remaining wounds of the body: and the other two particular sutures communicate to the rest of the wounds. However, they are more proper when it is a matter of the Suture of the belly: and I will tell you one thing at a time, with an explanation.
I say, that when the rib is small and has come out a little of the intestine, and it is difficult to reduce it: then it is on account of one or both of these two ways. Or because of the swelling due to cold air in the intestine, as we have said:
When then is this so? Then it is necessary to warm him up, so as to submerge a sponge or a wet cloth in warm water. Or you cook it in squirted water and cypress and garlic and simmer with it the intestines until the swelling is resolved.
When then does this wine which has fever make? And it is better than water alone in resolving the swelling.
When then do you see that the swelling has already been resolved, then wet the intestines with the water in which it was cooked, or dry them. For by this his entry will be eased with the small object.
But if his return is excused after this treatment, then find in the disruption a little, with the instrument with which they cut the hemorrhoids.
And the first cure is better when prepared, than the incision: and it does not require a force to cut after need and want of instruments.
Let one part of it be acute and the other obtuse, and the extremities be a little sharp, rather blunt; and this is like a cauda, as you see it.
When then does the knot grow larger and enters into the intestine, then it is necessary that there be a return of him according to his natural form in his own place, if possible above it: for it is better.
But when the rupture is wide in the lower part of the groin: then it is necessary that you let lie the sick one on his back, and set his legs higher than his head. And if it is in the upper part of the groin, then set his head and his chest higher than his lower parts.
And also if the rupture is on one side of the groin, then set your intention and your attention always in this, that part in which is the knot be higher on the other side.
And thus it should be that you administer this to large wounds and to medium-sized wounds.
But regarding small wounds, place it as you have prepared it for yourself.
Then make it present between the hands of a pious minister who holds the whole laceration in his hand: and spread out its lips. Then find someone who follows who has some thread; and this is the way of a common single stitch.
And there are those who take as much as you want, or count as much as you want according to the width of the wound. Then let go from the end of the laceration by the amount of your finger, that is, the doctor: and fasten now one after you have inserted it in at both ends of the skin, with two ends of the thread that are under the skin from within, until you have made it penetrate from the other side, and you have already joined together the two ends of the skin, and the two ends of the thread: and there are four orders.
Then tighten with double thread around the needle from both sides at the same time, until the two lips of the wound have been brought together by the decreasing gathering.
Then let go of the thickness of the finger as well, and fasten in them another: then make it straight with thread, just as you did with the needle first time. So you should not stop doing this with him as you go along from the beginning until you have completed the compression of the whole wound.
And there are medium needles between the thickness and the fineness: because the fine ones cut flesh quickly; and the thick ones enter difficult into the skin: therefore it is necessary that they be both of a middle size, and of a fineness.
And it is not necessary that the needle be fastened in both ends of the skin close together: so that the flesh does not quickly cut; and the wound does not open before its consolidation, and it does not elongate with the stitch, so that it does not prevent the wound from being consolidated.
Then cut the end of the acute edge so that it does not hurt the sick person in his sleep; and put on them little balls made from thin cloths from all parts that hold the ends of the sharp edges; and let them go until you know that the injury has already healed.
And this type of stitch with acute points is much more convenient for small wounds. Since it is sufficient in the stitch of their one, or two, or around them.
But the second common stitch is to collect with the stitch the four ends: the ends of the two skins, and the ends of the two sfac in one thread, with an acute point in subtlety and thickness.
Then when you penetrate with the acute point all four ends, draw them back from the part from which you started in order for the thread to come out from the upper part of the wound: so that the stitch is, like a stitch on cloth when cloth is stretched, and place between every stitch the amount of thickness of the little finger.
This stitch everyone knows.
And with this stitch I sewed a wound that occurred to a man in his belly, who had been wounded with a knife, and the injury to the flesh was large with a palm's width: and it came out from the intestines about two palms from the middle intestine, and there was an injury in the middle of the stomach.
So I reduced that after he had stood for twenty hours.
The wound was healed in a space that had been for about fifteen days: and I took care of it, and he was cured: and after that he lived for many years, thriving in his affairs.
And the doctors judged that it would not heal.
But by a miracle I did not cure that with ointment. Since I was in a place where the ointment was not found, and there was no medicine. So I put on the wound a cotton cloth wetted with honey twice a day, and took care of its washing with honey water until it was cured.
Two kinds of stitches I shall call by their own names according to the speech.
And it is as follows, beginning with an acute stitch: and insert it from the outside to the inside part.
When the needle enters the skin, and runs through the length and width of the whole body: let go of the end of the thread where you inserted the needle, and let it penetrate another end from the inside to the outside in an opposite direction.
When you have made it penetrate, then make it penetrate again at this same end from the outside to the inside: and let go of the end of the thread that is in this side, and make it penetrate another end from the inside to the outside - opposite direction - from this same end: and when you make it penetrate, then make it penetrate by your penetration, which makes it penetrate in this end, that is on the opposite side, until it penetrates all of it.
Then also from this same side, and take it by the end that is on the opposite side, and bring out the needle where it penetrated the skin.
Then also reduce it in that skin, and take its end that is on the opposite side, and bring it together with this end where you are; and bring out from the skin that which was brought out from the opposite side: and make that one go out before the other - as many times as necessary - until they are completely outside according to that example.
And the upper part of this stitch is as follows; it is that their stitches should be close together, like those that make the skin smooth: so that its end of the thread is brought out from one side of the skin; and let go of it on the other side until you have finished it.
The second kind of stitch belongs to Galen.
This speech of his has been told, that their stitches should be made similar in such a way as some doctors make them, so that they gather together all the parts by their natural shape: and they bring the end of the thread to one another, and this end where it is brought together with its opposite. And this I will tell you next.
You should make the incision at this point, close to the outer edge near you, and make it penetrate into the inside, in that same place only: and you shall leave two ends of the incision, rifacendo. Then turn the incision around, and make it penetrate from the outside to the inside at both ends, that is to say on each side: rifacendo.
Then turn both sides around, and make them penetrate from the inside to the outside at both ends, that is to say on each side opposite: rifacendo.
And this method of stitching is better than the common easy stitch, and it is a stitch which has a memory: the one before it.
This is thus the speech of Galen also.
And certain ones said. The stitch of the hand with two needles. That is to say, that you should put into them both one wire: and begin with the inserting of the needle, since it is with you, and make it penetrate to the other side, from one side to another, in accordance with the stitches of those which are equal.
And you should know, that when the break is in the middle of the hand: then the stitch of it is more difficult than at any other part of the hand.
Judgment indeed of the treatment of wounds, is judgment of all wounds.
That is to say, because when you have made the wound clean with its own blood, before it cools itself: and you have reduced the entrails, and they themselves, and made them fit: then put on the poultice of scar.
That is to say, if the air has already altered the wound: then put on the poultice of some ointment which is near you, until it makes the pus: and let the wires drop off, and be firm on each side, and the incision close up. Then take care for that wound as is taken care of all wounds, until it heals.
If you have not the medication for that wound, then put on it immediately, so that it may begin to emit pus, and change the poultice twice a day, as I taught you, until it heals.
But if there are no other conditions, and the wounds are simple, then there is no need for medication.
If, however, you should come to the conclusion that there is an injury to the main member of the body, then it is necessary to immerse the wound in a cloth dipped in oil of moderate temperature, or in rosin oil: and place it around the places that are between the hips, and under the armpits.
That if it feels pain, or prickings, or putrefaction in its intestines (for this often happens), then cleanse the bowels with astringent wine, black, hot: especially if putrefaction has already reached the intestines and a penetrating gangrene has taken hold up to the peritoneum.
And know that what is from the large intestine is easier to heal: and that which is from the small intestine is more difficult to heal.
But the intestine which is called the jejunum does not accept healing from a wound that has occurred in it at all: and this is because of its multitude, since it is made up of loops, and because of its size, and because of its softness, and because of the closeness of its nerves.
But if the wound that has come from it is not deep, and you are able to grasp it well: reduce it according to your own judgment, reducing the intestines equally.
But if there is a space that has been passed through it, and it has already become bright or black: then you should tighten it with a thread above the place that has been discolored by it, so that blood does not flow. For in the loop there are arteries and veins.
Then cut what is beyond that ligament, and place two ends of a thread hanging from the lower part of the wound outside the body: so as to relieve its pull on you, and to extract it toward the opening of the loop, and to emit the pus of the wound.
Remembrance of the wound that happened in the Intestine.
When disruption occurs in the intestine and is slight: then it is possible to restore it in some people; because I saw one who was wounded in his abdomen with a lance, and there was an old wound on the right side of his stomach, and it had healed up; and a fistula was made, and came out of it belching and wind.
I therefore applied the treatment, until I was confident in his recovery; and I did not cease to examine him carefully, until he was well and the site had been strengthened.
Once I saw the place was now consolidated, I feared for the disease that might come upon him in his abdomen: and it did not happen to him from that accident any evil. And he remained in better health, eating and drinking, and enjoying himself, and entering a bath, and exercising his body.
And some experimenters said, for when disruption occurs in the intestine and is slight: then it should be tied according to this method. And it is, that you take ants of large heads. Then gather two lips of the wound, and put one ant on them which has an open mouth over the two lips of the wound. Then when the head is on it, and it tightens its mouth, cut off the head; for it clings to it, and does not come off.
Then put another ant next to the first, and do not stop doing this with the ant after the second amount of wound.
Then reduce the wound, and tie up the wound. Those heads remain annexed to the intestine, until it is fed by the intestine, and is healed, and does not happen to the sick person any evil inside.
And it is possible that the intestine be tied also with a thin thread; which is taken from the animal's intestine, annexed to it after it enters into the nest.
And it is, that you take the end of this thread out of the intestine, and cut off a lot of it. Then tie his filament with a thin silk thread. Then insert that filament into the cavity, and sew it to the intestine. Then reduce the wound.
And this method of sewing with the awl and intestine is no more than a second opinion of trust and hope.
You know, a wound that is large and broad, especially if it is in one of the thin intestines; then it is not a skill but a delicate operation, and its healing is not at all certain.
Regarding the care for the small intestine and fistulas.
You should know that every wound, or suppurating sore when it has healed over and become old, and has formed a ulcer, and still discharges pus always, and does not heal: then we call it universally a fistula wherever it may be in the body; and we name it Zuchemen itself.
And a fistula is, in fact, a kind of filiation according to the nature of the part affected; it is hard and white: there is no pain with it, but there are curly feathers: and because of this it is called by some people Risati, that is, feather-like.
And it is sometimes moist, discharging pus. And perhaps it heals by granulation in some hours. When this moisture is much, and there is little: and when it is thick, and when it is thin.
I have already پیش in the division, then when I said wounds, that every ulcer which does not heal, and does not form new flesh, is not a wound at all but a fistula for nine causes.
One of these causes is, or because there is a lack of blood in the body; or because of its malicious nature; or because it is between itself and over its lips hard flesh, which prevents the growth of new flesh; or because it is full of dirt and filth; or because the wound is putrid within itself, and the matter which it discharges is of bad quality; or because medicine is incompatible in its cure; or because corruption by falling into a region is a kind of pestilence, or per se in that region: for this reason digestion of ailments is difficult, and healing of ulcers by nature is delayed; or because there is only one opening, or a number of bones.
And I have already shown you all the causes and signs of them, and their treatments with physicians in detail; and it is necessary here that I make you know the treatment of the fistula and of thezuken, which is made by a surgical opening with the hand.
So you know that the fistula happens in all parts of the body. For these are the fistulas that reach the large veins and arteries, or nerves, or to the intestines, or to the urethra, or to some of the ribs on the back, or to some of the joints of the body by composition: like the hands and feet: and those that flow close to the main member, and others.
Now which of these fistulas is according to this way, it is from diseases that are difficult to cure, and does not accept treatment, and the work with her is labor and ignorance.
That if there is any fistula whose depth does not reach these places that I said: and you hope, and you trust in its cure, and you seek to come to its knowledge, then you accept a trial from bronze or iron if the fistula extends according to rectitude, and you search it with itself.
But if there is any fistula that has a tortuosity, then investigate it with a thin lead. For because the lead with its gentleness softens itself to the body, and it is concerned about the tortuosity.
That if the fistula has many openings, it is not possible for you to indicate on it with a lead. So make a hole from its holes from its holes.
For because the moisture that clisterizes itself, runs towards other openings, and flows out of them.
Then investigate and find out according to how you can be able to: that you may know if there is a mouth or nerve, and the fistula is hidden far away or near: or is a single fistula whose openings are many, and it is over all that with great strength of your own: with your questioning, which you ask the sick person, and by finding out the pain when compressing with your hand on the spot, and similar indications and causes of accident.
Therefore, when you are standing still, stationary and stable, then turn to treatment with confidence: and it is as if you consider that, if there is a fistula that appears close by, or in a place far from the juncture, or from a nerve, or an artery, or a vein, or one of the places I told you, then dry up the fistula according to what I have previously said in my narrative, and remove what is in it from filtration, and腐敗した肉、それはその穴から生じるから、またはそれに似たもの: and cure it until it is healed.
But if the fistula is of great depth, and straight: then you should separate it in the depth as much as you can. Then cleanse it from all of its corrupted flesh.
Then apply the poultice of wet wool in acute medicines: and insert it into the fistula which you have enclosed with iron: do this several times, until the acute medicine has completely corroded what remained in the enclosure of the fistula from corruption.
Then restore it with ointment that generates healthy flesh, until it is healed.
But if it does not heal with this, then cauterize it according to what we have described.
But if the cause of the fistula is an opening, and this is certifed to you: then inquire about it, and dry it up according to what I have told you: if it does not prohibit you from any vein, or nerve, or main member, as we have said.
But if it is discovered to you that there is an opening, and there is some corruption, and blackening: then shave it, until all the corruption is removed. Then care for this person with what incarnates flesh, until he is healed.
That if it does not heal, and it discharges pus as it did: then know, that you have not achieved total eradication of the corruption.
Therefore, examine it again, and carefully consider whether there is some rational explanation for its condition, and cleanse it with your last strength.
Then restore him. So if he recovers, it is good; and if not, then you know that that corruption is far away in the depths of the body, which you have not reached. So you do not have such an art, unless you let it go by nature itself.
That if the corruption is in a small hole, and it is possible for you, draw it out with delicate forceps which are suitable for that.
If there are many bones, then inquire about their attraction, and do not let go of any of them with your strength.
If any of them make you afraid because there is a contrary moisture, and there is no fear or mistake in cutting them: then cut those moistures and the meat, if there is any, and free the bones.
If you do not have the preparation to remove the bones from your time, then place over the wound that it may rot: and let go of it until it rots what is around those bones of meat and moistures.
And guard the bone so that it does not harden again. And let it be constricted as you followed in your operation. At the bottom place over the wound, if you are able, a trodden-in with oil of sulfur: or a trodden-in in Egyptian ointment, or any kind of ointment.
For when those moistures rot, and the bones separate from them, their removal is eased, and their attraction is gone.
If there is one large bone, such as a thigh or hip bone, and that which is corrupted from it is part of the great bone, then cut it with the last rasp, until it is taken away by the black and corruption. Then restore the bone.
If, however, what is corrupted in it is a large part, and the corruption has already reached the bone's marrow, then you need to cut it off, and cut all of it up to the place where the corruption reaches: then take care of it, until it hardens again.
And I tell you a story about what happened to a man in his leg: that you may have an example and helper for your own operation.
There was a young man of about thirty years of age to whom it came to pass that he had pain in his leg, through some cause which entered into him from within the body, that is, from within, until it reached his limb; and there formed upon it a great ulcer, and not for any external cause.
So then with this time of error of the doctors, until the ulcer opened up, and there came many substances to him. And his cure was delayed until his leg had been bound up, and many openings were made in him: all of which were emitting pus, and moistures from the body.
So he was treated by a number of doctors for about two years, and there was no wise man in the art of hands, until I was called, and I saw his leg, and the matter which was flowing out from those openings in great quantity: also all of his body had become yellow, and his color was citron-like.
So then I entered into one of the openings, and came to the mouth.
Then I examined all the openings: and I found them coming together at a place from all parts of the leg.
So then I took hold of it, and followed up on one of the openings, until I detected a part of bone: and I found it corroded: which was already corroded, and discolored, and rotten, and pierced, until it penetrated all the way down to the marrow.
So then I broke off what had been detected by me, and prepared it from corrupt bone.
And I took hold of what was not in the bone but that corruption which I had broken off, and I made it sharp, and I broke it off. So then I had already roots.
Then I set about the root of the ulcer with cementing medicines in a long space. It is not consolidated.
And then I tried again, and grabbed the second bone above the first fracture: and I found continuous damage with the bone; and I tightened that which also seemed to me from that same corruption.
Then I tried to restore it. And it was not restored.
I grabbed it again, and I did not stop hitting the bone in detail, and tried to restore it: and it was not restored until I hit a little palm of the bone and pulled it out with its medulla.
Then I restored it with the help of physicians, and it was quickly consolidated, and healed: and this repetition in its operation, and section, would not have been necessary, except for the weakness of the nurse, and her lack of tolerance, and my fear of it from death; because it happened to him at all times from an excessive bad syncopis.
He was therefore completely healed: and new bone grew in place of the old one, and good order was restored in his body, and his strength returned: and he recovered his health, and returned to his habits: and he did not experience any harm at all during walking.
If however a prominent bone is already broken in the place of the body: then it should be fixed like this: you take a ligament, and tighten it on the end of the prominent bone: and order someone who will stretch it upwards: and put another grosser ligament on the first ligament. Then you fasten the ligament on top of the meat that is the bone: and extend its end so that you pull the meat downwards: and you cover the meat over the place that you want to fix, so as not to hurt it when you cut the meat.
Place a ligament, or a board under the bone below to the side: for when you do that, you should not stop to cut the corrupted meat.
And it should be fixed on the place of corruption slightly, so that there is not the risk of the bone's fracture: and it does not appear from its appearance to the sense, and compels to the force of its own fixing.
If the jaw is corrupted and is not prominent, then a part of it continues with another part: and corruption is in the middle of it, or in some part of it: then discover flesh from all parts altogether. Then put wood below.
Then tighten that from the first part where there is corruption until it continues with the lock from the other part: and tighten the second according to the length of corruption just a little, as I said.
If the corruption is in the joint, then cut that joint that is corrupted, and tighten the jaw where it continues from the other part.
But if the corruption is in the continuation of two joints, then there is no skill in that except for abrasion.
If the corruption is in the hand or foot plank: then the thing in it is difficult to do very much. But it is necessary that you inquire how the corruption appears to you. And abrasion it, and make clean that according to what seems to you possible, and with whatever skill you can correct it: when it does not give you a contrary vein, or nerve.
And know that there are many saws and drills to cut these bones according to the position of the bones, and their preparation, and their thickness and lightness, and their size and smoothness, and their magnitude and hardness, and their rarity. Therefore it is necessary that you prepare for each kind of operation a tool suitable to that operation.
And know that these operations require your attention to the instrument with which you work, when you have a long study. And the knowledge of the ways of this art is a witness to the way of sickness: for then you will find that which suits him out of instruments to every disease.
And I am confirming to you at the end of this chapter the number of instruments, which you may put as examples of what you cut, and proof of what you experience on others.
The shape of a serrated blade.
The shape of the razor's blades are joined together. Let the head of the razor follow the form of a star-shaped claw; and let its cuts follow the shape of a star's points.
It does not fit together unless the heads of the razor blades touch and move together when they are closing; it has a large and wide mouth.
The shape of the larger of the two razor blades.
The shape of the wider razor blade.
The shape of the razor blade that is closed together.
The shape of the other thinner razor blade.
The shape of the curved extreme end of the other razor blade.
The shape of a small and thin blade for the tongue.
This is similar to a ray and the end is like a serrated knife; it is shown in many places of the skull's bone-cutting.
The shape of the razor blade that closes onto the cuts made by the other razor blades through the bones.
Its end is triangular and its angles are acute.
It comes from India. And likewise it should be so that all that we have said about the razors, the incisers, and the serrations should be applied to them.
Regarding the cutting of bones and the serrations on them.
The ends putrifiy, either because of an external cause, or for an internal one.
But when you have cured the disease with medicine, and there is no benefit from the cure; and you see corruption affect a limb, but it does not spread to any other part of the body; then you should cut off that limb all the way up to the place where the infection stops; so that the sick person may be saved from death or from a greater disease by means of this limb.
And the sign that this happened is that the limb is disfigured until it is healed; either it has burned itself up or rotted after yellowing; until this putrefaction comes to that part which follows the limb, and creeps all over the body.
Therefore, when it is incised like this, and similarly if the cause of corruption is from the beating of certain fruits: as in the case of the sea scorpion, and the wasp, and the nettle, and others like them.
If then corruption or a blow is in the extreme part of the finger, then cut the finger, and not leave room for corruption, so that it may be incised all the way to the remaining hand.
And likewise if it happens in the hand, then cut it from the root with fire, and not leave room for corruption, until it is taken in the arm of fire.
And if a wound has happened in it, then cut the arm at the hip where it joins.
But if corruption has passed over, and you see it all around the hip: then death is in that person. And to add to this cure, there is a quantity of virtue.
And likewise do for the foot, when a wound has happened in the finger, then cut it near one of the joints: and if it enters into the shank, then cut the whole foot. But if it ascends to the knee, then cut the leg at the knee joint.
Which if corruption has already reached above the knee, there is no remedy but to cut it off and let go of the sick one to death.
And the way to cut a limb or to bend it is, so that you stretch the ligament in the lower part, which you want to incise: and stretch another ligament above the place. And let one minister of the ligaments stretch to the inferiores: and let another minister of the ligaments stretch upwards to the superior. And you separate the flesh which is between the two ligaments, with a sharp instrument, until all the flesh is seen. Then it should be incised, or stretched.
And it is necessary that you place a linen cloth on all sides and not touch the sound place with the saw: and happen to the sick person a wound added, and a poultice hot.
If, however, a flow of blood occurs inside while you are working, then quickly cauterize the place: or put on it some powder that stops the blood. Then turn your attention to your own medication until it is complete.
Then bind the injured member with a suitable bandage and take care of him, until he recovers.
And I will tell you what happened to the man in his foot, this same accident that I am telling you.
That is, because it happened in his black foot, with a burn that resembles fire; and that corruption first occurred in his toe, until it began to affect the whole foot.
Then the man from his own fever, after he saw the corruption enter into his limb with its violence, which he felt in pain and burning; and because of that infection he cut himself where it joins, and was healed.
And after he had passed a long time, the same corruption happened to him again in the first joint of his hand.
So he came to me, and I tried to remove that excess with him when I put on the hand from the medicines after purifying his body: and the excess did not respond, and began to affect another finger: until it started to affect the hand.
So he called me to cut off his hand; and I did not want to do so, hoping for a response from within to that excess: and I was afraid also of causing death to him by cutting off his hand. For the strength of the man was above his destruction.
Then, when he was disappointed with me, he turned back to his land; and he came back to me, because he hoped for healing, and he cut off all his hand: and he was healed.
I did not bring this story forward unless it should serve as an aid to what concerns this kind of sickness; and so that it should make clear what is made clear, and in accordance with what is relevant.
On the treatment of ulcers and the quality of poultices with medicines.
When an aphma occurs in some fleshy member and the space of the aphma is prolonged until it forms a collection: then it bursts, or pierces, and what is contained within it comes out, leaving a hollow place like a wound, and the skin above it, as though it were a thin cloth; and does not spread to the last extent of corruption in itself, nor prints into the mouth, nor into the nerves, nor into the ligaments: it deserves to be called a sinus: yet if it prolongs the space, until it impresses corruption on some of these members, then it is called a fistula, or a pudenda.
And the care of it is that you should strike all the skin off as though it were burned up; and above all when it has become thin, and is like a cloth: and be confident that it would not stick to the place because of its own corruption.
If, however, you hope that the skin will adhere, and does not bring about the last corruption: and if there is a thickness of flesh on the skin, then care for it with poultices; and you are to consider in regard to a sinus.
Then if it is large, and the pus that is discharged from it has a foul odor: then poultice it with Egyptian medicine, which is acid, and oil, and myrrh, parts equal, blended together in water: and let them boil on the fire until the medicine turns red: and let it come to a syrup.
Then take from it what you need: and dissolve it with water and honey, and poultice it with the sinus: and tighten the opening of it, and let the medicine flow into it for two hours.
Then draw it out with expression: make those days until the sinuses are cleaned and the smell is gone.
And when it is sometimes clotted with blood and water of ash, when this remedy is not present with you: and it is, so that you take the ash of dried wood, or the ash of oak wood: and you pour over it water. Then wrap it up, and clatter it with it until you are confident that the sinuses have been washed away.
That if the tolerance of the Egyptian remedy is not good, and neither the water of ash, then clatter it with water and honey, to which has been added some crushed zircon. Or clatter it with honey and wine mixed, because the property of honey is to clean and wash away: and the wine makes it adhere to the sinuses, especially when there is an abundance of astringency and dryness in it.
When you do this occasionally, and are confident that the corruption of the sinuses has already been removed: then clatter it with it so that flesh is born in it.
And it is so that you take the dyophin from plaster: and dissolve it with rose oil, and wine astringent: or clatter it with some other remedies, of which I have written about their properties in the treatise on ointments.
That if the orifice of the sinus is tight, in which the cannula of the clister does not enter: then enlarge it with iron a little: or put in it the lyme-tree that is stirred in Egyptian ointment, or in basilic ointment until it is enlarged.
And likewise if the orifice is also wide, then join the lips of it with a stitch: and let go from it as much as is added to the clister without any addition.
And likewise if the orifice of it from which the pus runs is raised upward: then dry it out in a lower place where it is located, so that the pus runs from it downward: because when the pus is held back in the depth of the sinus, it prevents flesh from being born in it.
If it is not possible for you to cut around the bottom of the sinus, according to what you wish: then try to prepare the member in such a way that a pus comes out easily, according to how it prepares itself for you. Try not to leave anything behind in it at all: and take the solid medicines that are placed over the mark, fitting for what you wish. And extend them over the fabric of linen. And let there be such a quantity of cloth so that it communicates with all of the sinus. Then cut with forceps into the direct opening of the sinus hole, making a slightly larger opening in the sinus. Then extend with linen pads from another cloth, according to the quantity of the opening: and place it on the body in a distant position from the hole, so that the exit of pus from it is facilitated: and do not remove the large cloth, unless after a few days a single sheet.
But the one who is on the sinus opening is the one whom you remove at all times, so that it comes out what is accumulated in it from pus: and know, that which runs out of it virus, is very much, or little: or digested, or undigested.
And with this repeatedly consider the place of the sinus itself, whether the master feels pain there, or not have pain in it, and whether it is in it a swelling, or not: and if it is in it a swelling, great or small; and if it is hard or soft.
When then your medicine is extended thus, and you see the material that comes out over the sinus opening, know that the sinus has already come together, or is approaching coming together: so then loosen it in the morning, or on the third day: and when you loosen the knot, then change the linen cloth, and rub with unguents.
If however comes out from the sinus after a long space a subtle virus, then do not despair about its coming together, for its cure approaches, because there are those who delay the generation of flesh in their wounds, and there are those who act in the opposite way.
If it has come out of the sinuses after many days of being indignant, then you will know that the sinus does not adhere.
If, then, the adhesion of the sinus is delayed, and its duration is prolonged: then add to the exiccation of medicines, it is true that physicians make them so that they are in their own substance of moisture, and in their own strength dry: like unguentum diacuminicon when added thereto an excess of addition by zeyi.
And from the last, because it is cured when you take unguentum diacuminicon and dissolve it with rose oil and return to the same old wine in its substance.
Then bind it to it, and use it.
And now it does the same action when you do not have with you unguentum diacuminicon, honey, when you cook it, until it thickens, and use it. Or take myrrh and aloe and olive oil: all of them, and grind them into powder and sprinkle it over honey while it is on fire. Then bind a strip of cloth over the sinus and tie it: and bind the strip with honey that you have cooked until it thickens: and sprinkle the powder on the strips, and put it on the cloth, and tie it up.
And when you administer to it long aristochaus, and the roots of the sky lily, and the lily itself: and the herb powder, and the daisy. Use them simple, or mixed together, stir it up, and strain it: and sprinkle the powder over the honey that you have cooked, and use it.
If the sinus is prolonged and does not heal with this cure: then you will know that there is corruption in its depth: or it already makes an impression on the bones, or on the other hard members of the body, or on the ligaments: then care for the sinus with Fistularum cures, according to what has been stated.
Regarding the cure of Panăritus and the grinding of a fingernail and incising a finger and cutting it off:
The finger nail grows from under the thumb of the hand or foot, and possibly also from the other fingers.
When it is then allowed to grow on and neglected with regard to its care, and is made an ulcer with heat: or if it is corrupted, and discharges pus, until it corroded the nail's root: and perhaps it corrupts all of it, and possibly the corruption reaches the mouth, until it has a foul smell: and makes the end of the finger large, and makes its color dark.
When then you shall care for it, with what concerns the above-mentioned, and your treatment does not benefit it: then you must cut away the whole superfluity that remains from the nail. Then cauterize the wound after that. For the caustic of the wound is very hot.
But if the mouth is healthy, and the nail also is healthy, and the nail's additions of thin blood press on the flesh towards the inside, and begin to sting it, and hurt it: then you should put a small radium under the edge of the nail that stings the flesh, and push it upwards: and cut the flesh easily, and put on what remains of the flesh from the medicines burning, and corroding, until it has all fallen away. Then care for that with the nail-oil, until it is healed.
But if the corruption has already imprinted itself into the mouth, then you should cut away that mouth, and take it out: for it is not healed at all while it remains in it.
If you see that the corruption and ulcer are running down the finger, then cut it off at one of its ends, according to what has been said above in regard to the reminder. Then care for the wound, until it is healed.
But if a nail is broken or struck: and there is sharp pain with it, then you should take away the blood first. Then dry the nail with a sharp spatula, cutting across from top to bottom.
And be careful so that the cut does not go down to the flesh that is under the nail, for then you will cause a very painful sore to arise, and it will be a reason for the birth of flesh in that place.
Then care for the place with the same ointment that soothes pain.
The finger that is added which is born in some hands of men, perhaps is fleshly all over; and perhaps there are bones in it, and perhaps a nail is born in it: and perhaps its birth is in the root of the joint, or its birth is in some nods of the finger. So then who is born in some nods of the finger does not move; and who is born next to a joint of the finger, perhaps moves.
But of that which is fleshly there is an easy way to cut it. That is, so that you strike yourself at the root with a sharp spatula.
But of that which its birth is in the root of the joint, there is a difficult treatment. So then abstain from cutting it.
But in that which is born in the finger up to the very nods, then it is necessary so that you strike the first flesh of its round incision all the way to the mouth. Then tighten the mouth with one of those sharp things that are suitable for it. Then care for the flesh so that it heals.
But the healing that happens to fingers from one side to another, often happens because it is born with man, that is, it is born with him; or from the healing of a wound, or from burning of fire, and similar things.
So then let there be separation of that healing so that fingers grow back to their natural form. Then place between them a leather strip, or rags soaked in rose oil: so that they do not quickly come together and separate them: or place between them a thin lead strip, so that the place heals as it should.
And likewise if some fingers with the palm are consolidated, then dry out that consolidation, according to how it is prepared and suits the figure of the member.
¶ On Incision.
Wounds are veins that are swollen, thick, and full of melancholic excesses which occur in many parts of the body; and most of them are found in the legs, especially in those who walk a lot or work hard, and those who carry heavy loads.
Therefore, you should provide for the discharge of the body from black cholera by a strong expiration sometimes.
Then take blood from the patient with a large blade.
The treatment of these wounds with iron is according to two methods. One is that they sit and black blood is drawn from them. And the other method is that a vein is lifted and all of it is drawn out.
But the sectioning thereof is according to this manner. Wrap the leg first with warm water until the thick, foul blood resolves. Then tie the leg of the patient by an nurse from the upper part of the thigh up to the lower part of the knee with a string. Then dry a vein in one place, or two, or three wide sections.
Then draw blood from the lower part of the leg up to the top and at the top it should be that the phlebotomist draws blood from the patient first. Then dry the nail down to the tip: until it exits with an amount of blood that you see sufficient to meet its strength and endurance.
Then tie it up: and command him not to abstain from foods that cause black cholera: and repeatedly draw blood and bleed when the veins are filled, and let the patient suffer.
But the lifting thereof is according to this manner. Cut the leg of the patient if there are many hairs. Then introduce yourself into the bath; or apply a warm damp cloth to his leg, until it turns red and the veins swell; or exercise him strongly, if there is no bath present, until the limb warms up.
Then dry the skin with a towel along the course of the vein; or at the heel of his leg, or at the lower part near the heel.
Then open the skin with a hook, and scrape the vein from all sides until you feel it; and at its appearance, that is when you see it turn red from black to white. When therefore you remove the skin, you will see it white as a string.
Then introduce underneath it the hook with a blunt point, until it comes out and leaves the skin; hang it by the blade of the hook, soft.
Then dry another piece of skin next to that piece of skin with three fingers. Then scrape the skin from the upper part of the vein, until it appears. Then rub it with rays as you did before, and hang it by another hook as you did at first.
Then dry another piece of skin, or more pieces if you can endure it. Then rub it and cut it at the heel.
Then pull it out to the piece that is above it.
And do this, until you pull it out from the upper part; or higher parts of the skin, until it comes out all the way; then cut it.
If, however, it does not obey you in being pulled out and rubbed: then introduce a sharp wire into it, bind it, and pull it out; or introduce a hook underneath it: and rotate your hand around all its parts, until it comes out all the way. Then caustice, lest it cut. For if it cuts, it will be difficult for you to rub it well; and introduce yourself into the wound with a needle.
So when you have drawn it all out: then place it on the wound, soaked with wine and oil, or just oil, and care for it, until it is healed.
If the vine is contracted, and has twists to it which require stretching out towards the ends, and is not like what we have said according to its straightness: then you must find out over it to all parts of its twisting, and the places of its stretching out.
Then hang it up with hooks until you have completely stretched it out: and be careful when you cut your piece above it so that you do not hit a vein, or wound: for it would be difficult to stretch it out over you, or to draw it out. Therefore preserve your wits.
The shape of the incision when the vine is healed.
The shape of the incision when the vine is blind.
It is not a gentle curve like the rest of the vine, and it does not have a sharp extreme, so that it does not hurt the skin: and it has a coarse flexibility, soft: for if it were thin, it would bump into the skin with its thinness: but its coarse flexibility makes it suitable, as we have said.
Of the extraction of a vein from the leg.
This vein is born in the legs in warm countries, like the alnet, and the land of the Arabs, and in arid, warm lands, scarce of tenderness, that is, where no grass grows, nor trees.
And perhaps it is born in other parts of the body besides the legs.
And its generation is from decay which happens under the skin, like what happens inside the bodies of snakes and worms, and worms are generated between the skin and flesh.
And the sign of the beginning of this vein is that which happens in the leg: there is a violent inflammation. Then the spot becomes sore. Then the vein begins to come out from the spot of its sore, like a root of a plant, or an animal.
When this extreme end therefore appears from her, then you should fasten a lead screw on it, the weight of which is from a drachm to two drachms and a mark; and let go the lead that is suspended in the leg.
Whenever anything therefore comes out of her to the outside, fasten it in lead, and mark it. That if it is prolonged for a long time, then cut off a part of it, and fasten the remainder. And do not cut her off by the roots before she has come out all at once. For if you should cut it, it will contract, and go into the flesh; and it will cause a boil, and decay in the place, and a sore wound.
Therefore it should be handled gently, and taken out little by little, until it has come out from the last of its own; and nothing remains in the body from it: and from this vein comes out in some men who are five palms long and ten fingers wide. And already has come to me, for she has brought forth a son from twenty palms.
If however you should cut yourself in the time of your treatment: then drive in a lead screw into the hole, and pierce her through the length, with the body, until all that is in her comes out from that matter; and administer decay to the place with medicines for several days. Then take care of this cure for boils.
And this vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears in the ankle of the foot, or in the foot itself: and it has many openings, and comes out from every opening a branch.
Take care therefore for this cure, as we have said in the division, and with what follows that which has been mentioned.
Regarding the section on worms that are generated under the skin, and it is called Boona Disease.
This Disease is called in some country Bouina Disease; because it often happens to the worms, and it is a scaly one-sided skin: it is born between the skin and flesh.
And he felt all over the body, ascending and descending; and his sense was shown to him by his walking with a member from one part of the body to another, until he stopped wherever he should stop on the skin, and left it.
And his progeny is from the decay of some of the humors. As happen worms and snakes, that is, lombrics and roundworms in the belly.
And they fear his wickedness. For when he himself felt all over the body and went up to the head and came to a place: then perhaps it opens within him and leaves, and destroys his eye: and this happens many times.
But when you are to treat him, and take him out, then it is not done except by his walking and showing of his sense.
Therefore, it should be that you hold back what is above him, and what is under him with strong constriction by a ligament. Then dry up on top of him, and take him out.
That if it penetrates into the flesh, and not into his body: then put on the place a caustic with fire, until he dies.
And greater than that which is feared, is his decay, which corrupts the eye, as we have said.
But if you see him already coming to a head near the eye, then tie under him a good superciliary constriction. Then dry up on top of him, and take him out.
And it should be that the sick one uses his own body purification, with physicians dissolving bad putrid humors.
And let him guard himself from foods that generate decay.
On the division above infirmity of Nakir.
This infirmity is called in our land Nakir, and it is a pain that happens in some member; then it changes from one part of the body to another.
And I myself have already seen him, according as I tell you. I have been called to attend a sick woman in some trouble. And he felt the arm and saw the swelling of the lung in the rope of the forearm.
And after a while I saw one swelling rise with a feverish heat as if it were a wound, going up to his shoulder faster than he could run: so that it looked like silver running from place to place.
So the pain left that spot and was fixed in the shoulder.
Then he sat for a while, and then he ran all over his body until he reached the other arm.
Then he told me that he was shaking all over his body, according to which I saw it.
So I was amazed at the speed with which he moved from one limb to another. And I too had not seen this illness with my eyes before, moving in such a way. However, I saw many who suffered from one limb to another: and I did not see him with my eyes as I saw it in the woman.
And I do not think that was because it is so, that he was from those who are afflicted with dry gangrene of the skin: hence this seems to indicate the windiness that is moved.
And it is necessary so that it does not appear in this way in those who are delicate and have moist bodies, hidden gangrene.
Then when you are treating his cure and the patient feels pain: then if it appears to you with your eye as we have said, then tie him down tightly on top of it and quickly dry him off under it until this windiness is driven away: and burn the spot.
But if you do not see the spot with your eyes: then take care of the body with the scrubbing and with it driving out the windiness, and dyeing them red with bitter herbs, and with herbs of serapina, and others similar to these.
On the extraction of arrows.
Arrows differ according to their kind and the places in which they enter the body.
Indeed there is a difference between them, since some have large points, and some small; and some are curved, and some straight. And of these there are three-angled ones. And of these there are language arrows. And of these there are tethers.
Indeed the ones that enter the limbs fall according to two modes. Or if they enter the principal limbs, such as the brain, and heart, and liver, and lung, and kidneys, and intestines, and bladder, and those like them. When therefore it falls into one of these limbs, and you see signs of death, which I will describe to you afterwards, then you should extract the arrow from it, for death follows it in many dispositions. And when you do not see these bad signs, and the arrow does not appear to be embedded deeply in the limb, then you should extract it, and take care of the wound.
For when the arrow falls into the brain and penetrates the skull and exits through a sinus that is above the brain, it causes a violent fever, and opacities in the eyes, swelling, dizziness, redness of the eyes, blushing, spasms, confusion of thought, and loss of memory, and cholera. And perhaps it will exit blood from the nose, or ears. And perhaps speech is severed, and language is destroyed. And it will exit from the wound a white moisture similar to spittle. And it will exit from it a liquid-like meat.
If you see these signs, then refrain from treatment, and extract the arrow if it has not already exited.
The signs of an arrow that falls into the heart are: it is close to the left nipple; and feels as if it were fixed in a hard object, not in a soft one. And the arrows move in a way similar to the pulsation; and black blood runs from the ulnar bone. And then follows the cold of the extremities, and cold sweat, and fainting. So know that death has come near.
And when the arrow hits the lung, there is a spray of dark blood from the ulnar bone; and the veins that run along the neck, turn pale, and change color in the nurse's hands. And he breathes out great breath, deep; and seeks the coolness of air.
That if the arrow falls into a hole, which is in the chest: then it is near the back for a few inches; and it causes great pain with a sharp ache, with a sigh: and all the arms of the shoulders move.
And if the arrow falls into the stomach, then it is likely that something undigested has come out of the ulnar bone from food.
And if the arrow falls into the stomach and remains there: then something like dung comes out of the ulnar bone, or a knuckle, or an intestine that has already been broken. So there is no hope for his cure, nor for the extraction of the arrow.
That if the arrow falls into the bladder and comes out as urine: and it proceeds from it something that goes outside, and the pain is stronger on the sick person: then know that it is fatal.
The rest of the limbs, such as the face, and the neck, and the tongue, and the spatula, and the aid, and the spine, and the fork, and the hip, and the leg, and those similar to the limbs are healed according to many dispositions: but if the arrow does not hit an artery or a nerve; and there is no deadly arrow.
And I tell you what I saw of these arrows, that you may understand with regard to your own cure.
That is, for a certain man, an arrow fell into his eye, into the lacrimal eye, at the root of his nose. Therefore I removed it from him on one side, below the fat of his ear; and he was healed, and there was no injury to his eye.
And I took out another arrow from the Jew, which had fallen to him in the fat of his eye below his lower eyelid; and the arrow was already hidden, and I did not succeed in taking it out except for its end, which touched his skin, having been wedged in his wood: and this was a great arrow of Turkish arrows, with a soft iron, in which the ears are not.
So the Jew was healed, and there was no harm to his eye.
And I took out another arrow from the throat of a Christian.
And this was an Arabic arrow, and it had ears. So I followed up on top of him between two teeth: and it was already submerged in his throat. I was delicate when I took it out, until I took it out: and the Christian was healed.
And I took out another arrow from a man which had fallen to him in his belly; and we thought that he would die from it.
Then after forty days I passed on behind him, and there was nothing changed in his appearance from his habits, so I followed up the arrow; and I carefully considered it over, and took it out: and he was healed, and there was no harm to him.
And I saw a man to whom the arrow had fallen on his back, and a piece of wood had been set over it. Then after seven years the arrow came out at the root of his thigh.
And I saw a woman to whom an arrow had fallen into her belly, and a piece of wood had been set over it, and the arrow remained within her; and she did not change from her habits in anything, and the woman did not find any harm in him from his natural operations.
And I saw another man to whom an arrow had fallen on his face; and a piece of wood had been set over it, and it remained, not finding much pain in him: and there were many similar things like this.
I extracted a arrow from the king's face, which had fallen on his middle nose, and had already inclined towards the right side by about as much: and the whole arrow was hidden.
So I was called to cure him after the arrow fell for three days. Then I found a sturdy arrow shaft.
So I examined it with a careful touch, and did not feel it out: and he himself felt the prick and pain on his right side. I hoped that was a prick from the end of the arrow.
I plastered over the place with a plaster that attracts and draws on its strength, and assured myself, that if the place were to heal up, I would show you a sign of the arrow, so that I might cut off what followed it: and no such accident happened, meaning that the arrow had gone straight.
I applied the plaster over it for many days: and no accident happened, and the bone was consolidated in between: and he remained weak because of having had the arrow extracted from him for a space of days, until one day he felt the arrow within his nose. And he told me about that.
And he told me about that. So I put on the bone an acute medicine, which I kept for many days, until it was open: and when I examined him, I felt a slight bump of the arrow that clung to the wood.
Then I added to the opening of the wound with that acute medicine, until we could see clearly the end of the arrow: and there passed away from me with that space of time about four months.
Then after the bone had grown bigger, and might possibly have been inserted into it with a fork, and moved it back and forth: then I did not cease to be careful, and devised ways for it, until one day I came upon it with a pair of forks made shorter, according to which their form became at the end of the chapter, so that I extracted it. Then I healed the fracture.
And the doctors say that if the nasal cartilage is not restored, the nose will be disfigured. I then restored it, and the fracture was consolidated, and the broken part was healed with complete health: nor did it cause him any harm at all.
And I will tell you the quality of a certain type of incision: so that you may place that rule and meaning over it, which I have not said.
For the parts and distinctions of this art are not contained in the telling: nor does that book contain them, and the crafty workman compares little with much: and when he describes what is present, he makes mention of what is absent: and he discovers a new operation, and a new instrument, on account of the descent of foreign things of this art when they occur.
I say then, that the arrows do not come out of the member from which they are fixed, except according to two ways. Or by being drawn out of a place into which it entered. Or by being drawn on the contrary side of another part.
And that which goes out from where it entered, or is an arrow going into flesh: and being drawn, it goes out.
That if it does not yield to the exit at the time when it falls: then you must leave it for a few days until the flesh which is around it rots: and the attraction of it will be allayed, and its exit will be eased.
And likewise if it is broken into a bone, and does not yield to you at the exit, then leave it for several days: and again and again with attraction and motion every day until it goes out.
That if it does not yield to you at the exit after several days, then you must cut around the arrow in the bone with a sharp knife, until the arrows become larger. Then attract it, and take it out.
But if the arrow is now buried deep in the body, and hidden and concealed from sensation: then feel for it with your hand. But if you feel it, then attract it with some instruments suitable for attracting it.
But if you cannot bring it to the surface because of the constriction of the wound, and because of the length of the arrow deep inside: and there is no bone, nerve, or vessel there: then look for it until the limb becomes bigger, and it becomes possible to extract the arrow.
That if they are ears which it holds fast, then free the flesh that is fixed to them on all sides, with all the skill you can muster, and the skill of others also: but if it cannot be brought to bear on the ears, or their distortion, until he is healed.
And you, when you perform the extraction of the arrow, wherever it is, then use your twisted hands with forceps to all parts, until you make it bleed: and the smallest detail, so that the arrow does not break, and it becomes difficult for you to attract it, and to extract it.
That if you cannot bring it out all at once, then leave it for a few days, until what is around it begins to rot. Then repeat the extraction: for surely bandages ease pain: but if you feel opposition from the flow of blood, then administer what I have said in my book on healing: and guard your skill from cutting into bone, or a nerve, or a vessel.
And employ skill in every way that you can to heal the patient of the arrow wound: and let it be with ease, and quietness, or slowness, and steadfastness, as I have told you.
And it is necessary that you bring the bowstring with care, so that the patient is in the shape of the arrow, according to what was at the time of the fall of the arrow on itself. For it is more sure. If it is not possible for you to do this, then employ what you can out of the shapes.
But the arrow which comes from the opposite side, or has already gone out a little towards the outside: or makes a protuberance on the extreme end of the arrow by sensation from the upper part of the skin nearby, and you see it sticking out: so cut off above it, and let the section be according to the quantity that they hold in it the bowstring.
Then attract it: for it becomes easy to come out.
But if it is held in the bone, then turn your hand according to the roundedness, until it presses on the arrow in the bone, and makes it more strong for itself: and then pull it out.
And if not: dismiss it with days: and then try again, until it comes out.
That if the arrowwood is in it, then push it out with that.
If it has fallen on the wood, and you are able to give a push: then introduce an instrument into it, so that the hole of it goes into the end of the arrow: and then push it out with that.
If the arrow is closed up, then push it out with an instrument which enters into it. For the arrow is made light by that.
That if the arrow is poisoned, then it is necessary that you should put on meat all over which is the poison: if you are able to do this. Then take care of it with that which comes into contact with it.
If the arrow is lodged in the chest, or in the belly, or in the urethra, or in the side: and it is near to you because you feel pain when you press upon it, and it is possible for you to cut above it: then cut, and take care not to wound the vein, or the nerve, and draw it out.
Then saw off the limb, if you see it, and be careful about that one, until it heals.
And this is the form of the hooks with which arrows are drawn out.
Let them be made similar in length to the point, which are made like iron: when they grasp the arrow, they do not let go of it.
And there are many kinds of them, large and small, medium, according to the quantity of the arrow, and its size, and the width of the wound, and the contraction of it.
This is the form of the hooks for driving out an arrow.
And this is the form of the hooks for driving out an arrow but they are thick.
This is the end of a hook like a radium, so that it may direct its entrance into the conjoined arrow, and push with it.
Regarding phlebotomy (bloodletting) from veins.
The veins which are phlebotomized, of which custom runs in the body, are thirty.
Of these in the head are sixteen: two pulsating veins, which run behind the ears, called the two herbs; and two arteries, which appear in two tempi; and two veins, which run in two nostrils of two eyes, called the two ASPECTIVE; and a vein prepared in the middle of the forehead; and a vein at the end of the nose. And two guide-veins, which are in the neck. And two veins, which are in the upper lip of the mouth. And two wounds that are in the lower lip. These are wounds which are called Algecirich. And these two wounds that are beneath the tongue.
But the veins which are phlebotomized in the arms, are five wounds in the whole arm.
One of them is Cephalica, and it is from the lateral forest; and it is called by the common name a wound of the head. And Fusca. And the middle wound, and it is composed of a branch of the Basilical and a branch of the Cephalical: and it is called by the common name a wound of the body. And the Basilical, which is placed on the lateral domestic: and it is also called the Titillicaris. And this one is called a wound of the leg. And theFunis brachii, and it is placed on the back; and this one is that which appears above the little finger by a visible indentation.
And the Salutatella: and this one is between the ring finger and the little finger; and these two are the branches.
And in the leg and in the foot there are three wounds. One of them is that which is beneath the little finger's knuckle, from the lateral forest. And the second one is the Saphenous vein; and its place is at the heel bone on the lateral domestic side. And the third one, which is called the Nerve; and its place is at the heel bone from the lateral forest.
And in the other leg there are three similar wounds.
Now, about the phlebotomy of two wounds behind the ears.
The phlebotomy of two wounds behind the ears is an ancient procedure which has been used to treat hemiplegia, hemorrhage in the brain, sahafa (a term for a medical condition), and bad sores on the head.
And the quality of the phlebotomy is according to that which I have narrated. And it is, when one rubs the head with an ointment: and it rubs the occipital region of the skull between two wounds with a rough friction. Then the injured man tightened his neck with a cord until two veins appeared. And their places are after the ears on the two depressions of the head. So ask them with your finger, and where you feel the pulse of their ears under your finger, there are the marks with the firebrush.
Then take the scalpel-wielding phlebotomist, and he is the one who is called "the incision. Then introduce him under the vein at the cut, until the phlebotomist reaches the mouth. Then wash your hands with the blood and skin on the upper side, and make an incision of the vein with the skin-cut slash. And the length of the incision is as much as two fingers spread out, or about that: and you make it come out with as much blood as you wish.
Then tighten it with a firebrush, and let it go, until it heals.
And already ahead in the beginning of the book on the incision of their ears, and their cauterization.
The two arteries that are in the two times of phlebotomy by way of a strapping, are for an ancient hemianopsia: and salt water, and perspiration of the acuteness that flows towards the eyes.
And the quality of the phlebotomy of them is according to what I tell you. Then tighten the injured man's neck much, until two veins appear with a noticeable appearance: and he shows the pulse of their ears under your finger. For then are the marks with the firebrush.
Then wash the skin on top of the vein with your index finger, and introduce the phlebotomist from underneath, and wash the vein on top. And make an incision of it, as you did with the two veins: and make the blood flow according to the quantity of your need.
Then dissolve the constriction with the help of a surgical instrument, and place your finger on it for an hour. Then place a cotton wadding over it and the pus, and tightly bind it above the constriction with a strong bandage: and remove the bandage when the wound has healed.
And the memory of them, and their incision, and their extraction is at the beginning of the book.
The instrument for venesection of the forehead is after the venesection of the head, to cure old diseases of the face; and to cure headaches, and red faces; and bad ulcers.
And the quality of venesection is according to whether I tell you. A constricted neck with a purple color, until the blood appears. Then take the surgical instrument which is called a chisel.
Then place the sharp end which is in the chisel on top of the blood, and pierce it with a pin or some other thing in this way: and let the blood run according to how much you wish. Then dissolve the piercing with the help of an instrument, and tightly bind it, until it has healed.
And when it opens with a venesection on the side. However, it is not necessary that the phlebotomist be of acute temperament, as are other phlebotomists, but rather of a moderate temperament. And venesect the blood according to its transmutation: for the mouth is near: and perhaps in this the phlebotomist may break when it is thin.
However the instrument for the two veins which are in the two lacrimal ducts of the two eyes, is to cure an eye from a scabies and a headache; and bad vision in an eye, and diseases of the face.
And the quality of venesection of them is, to bind the constricted neck with blood. Then let him draw blood; and you stand over his head.
And so let the phlebotomy be made according to the length of a little bit, with a small one, at a bit of an angle, for there is no blood in the place. If then the phlebotomist is fine at the end, perhaps it is broken.
Then let him make the blood run out as much as you need. And put a cloth over them and tie them up for one night and then release them.
But the veins of the nose are used for a acute fever and a rushing pulse, and diseases of the face, such as a headache, and a ruddy color that comes to the face: especially when it is old.
And the quality of this phlebotomy is that he should squeeze the sick neck. Then take his nose with your left hand and take a small phlebotomy that is long, and fasten it in the middle of his nose, between what distinguishes the nose according to its length. For the vein does not show itself to the sense there, and because the blood begins to flow immediately.
And let your hand with the phlebotomist be a little behind: and let him make the blood run out according to your need. Then bind it up for one night. For this is quickly healed.
Of the two phlebotomies of Guiy there is a constriction for the constriction of a dry fever and the beginning of leprosy, and melancholy diseases, andImpetigo and bad sores, andcorrosive, that is, scabs of scabies.
And the quality of this phlebotomy is that he should squeeze the sick under each on his neck with a ligament: and let the artisan stand over the head, and let the sick person sit on a chair.
Then phlebotomy a young one for the length phlebotomy broadish sort of. Then extract from the blood quantity of temperature, or according to that which you see from necessity that is to that. Then do likewise with another young one.
Then loosen the ligaments, and tighten two veins tightly in the middle: so that the sick person does not become weakened. And let it remain until morning. For the wound will heal.
As for the phlebotomy of Albigeric. But the phlebotomy of Albigeric is a thing to be avoided: because it conveys to the alcohol in the mouth, and corruption of the tongue: and sores on the lips, and ulcers also, and even those which are in the nose, and round about it.
And the quality of this phlebotomy is that you should make the sick person sit before you: and tighten his neck with a rope. Then open the lips and look at two veins, the one on the right side of the lip, and the other on the left: and the demonstration of both is by the blackness of amber. And that is true: for there are small veins round about them, black. Then cut each of the two veins as they are cut.
But if doubt is upon you, and you do not know which of them is which: then approach to the incision of the greater one of them, and make known its two veins.
And do likewise with the two veins which are in the upper lip: and very much so does habit run with it: and cut two veins which are in the lower lip.
As for the phlebotomy of Veins under the tongue, after the phlebotomy of the head. The two veins which are under the tongue have a rule: that is, the phlebotomy of the head is for those pre-occupations which are in the throat, and the sickness of the throat, and the sicknesses of the mouth.
And the quality of phlebotomy is that the sick person sits between your hands before the sun: and anoint his tongue, and look at it under his tongue on one side, and under his tongue on the other: and the color of both goes away to darkness.
So phlebotomize him on both sides: and guard, that you do not put your hand into his blood. For under him are the arteries, and perhaps it happens that the flow of blood comes out from those arteries.
And the three veins that are phlebotomized in the bed, are in which the custom of phlebotomy runs in all men.
And phlebotomy is done on them according to two ways. Or with the prick and the phlebotomist's needle on the side: or oiling at the point of decline: or drying with the phlebotomist's knife, and it is Anaesthetizer. And this is its form.
And of them are species broad, and subtle according to the length of the veins and their narrowness: and the form of phlebotomy'a needle is broad, as you see it. And it is useful to open closed veins, full, coming from the body, apparent, thick, and those which contain blood thick, turbulent.
And this phlebotomist is of less latitude, and more subtle at the extremities.
And it is useful to phlebotomize veins that contain blood thinner, citrin-colored
But that which is one of the three veins to be phlebotomized, it is a helpment. Because he draws blood from the diseases that are under the throat and the neck, from which comes to the chest and the belly: and it is useful for the phlebotomist to pass over them with care, since an artery lies under them. If he makes an error and adds to the puncture with phlebotomy, he will cut the artery and cause a flow of blood. Therefore, when puncturing with phlebotomy, it is necessary to cut through the vein: with Alne's knife, cut only a little.
If the church does not appear with a visible apparition, then you must remove it and change it to another one, or ask someone else's opinion: or if he cannot find anyone, he will make a knot in his thread of the brachial artery. For it is evident, and cut it with Alne's knife as we have said.
But if you want to make a phlebotomy in his own hand, then you must touch the spot on the brachial artery before it is tightly tied up, so that you know where to cut. Then mark the spot with caustic powder, and afterwards the arm, and cut the thread in a closed section with Alne' knife as we have said. And so that the knot does not fall through the space from the spot of the artery.
And when you see it, as you tighten the knot, the swelling in the spot that you have marked with caustic powder, then this swelling is an swelling of the artery: so remove it.
If you see blood rise during phlebotomy, like a boy's urine, and it is thin blood, red in color: then you will know that it is from the artery's blood. Then therefore place your hand on the spot and let it rest there for a long time, and then remove your hand. If therefore blood is separated (for it is often separated) then tighten the arm and let go of it: and let him be careful to move his hand: and place it on his fear.
And let him not be in pain for several days, until he is healed.
But if the blood does not separate and it hurts you: and there is no present remedy for you in your moment of need, then cut the artery, if it appears to you. The extremities of it are cut off, and blood is shed.
Or take the fistula at its extremities, and cut it off; or take half of it, and tightly bind it to the place where the stricture is, with a ligament and powder until another day.
Then if blood is shed, it is good. And if not: then the care of him with that which preceded his memory from the place of the flux of blood, from which he is cut off: and the cutting off of his blood is not difficult in many dispositions, on account of the small wound, and the possibility of a ligament from the arm.
But the phlebotomy of the veins of the foot is a remedy, which draws blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body: for this reason, it is composed of a branch of the Basilica, and a branch of the Cephalica, as we have said.
And it belongs to the phlebotomist that he should be on his guard against phlebotomy of him, for under it is a nerve. But if he adds anything to the piercing of the phlebotomy, and finds a nerve, there occurs in it an stupor, and a difficult cure is made, and perhaps a thorough cure does not take place.
And this nerve often appears to the sense. But if it is concealed in some men, and is subtle, and does not show itself: then you should put your phlebotomy so that the phlebotomist may make a section with the Alnesil, and remove the nerves with your strength.
That if the vein is between two nerves, then find the vein in its length.
Of the cerebral vein. But the phlebotomy of the cerebral vein is a remedy, for it draws blood from the head, and is applied to the diseases of the eyes.
And it is necessary in this vein to use an oil-phlebotomy, or a myrrh-phlebotomy, for it is salutary for all veins, because it is not under an artery, nor a nerve.
Yet it is fitting that you should go to the phlebotomist's house, so that you may have the head lacerated only, and inquire about a milder place; and it does no harm to him, unless it is discovered upon his body with a first punch, so that he may return to it from time to time with phlebotomy.
Yet perhaps you should avert your eyes from certain people when they are not phlebotomized in the first punch, but it does no harm to him if that aversion is in some measure.
On the Benefit of Phlebotomy and Care to be Taken with It. The Quality or Advantage of Phlebotomy, and the Consequences of It; by which You Should Take Thought for Correction.
Then first of all you should know that phlebotomy is not performed except for the preservation of health, and its perseverance, and the care to avoid any illness.
And so that phlebotomy may be performed on one of the three which are in a bed, namely the Cephalica, and the Fusca, and the Basilica. And so that phlebotomy may be performed at the beginning of spring on a fast, and during the summer, and autumn after a meal, when there are signs of fullness.
And so that phlebotomy may be performed on the first or third day after having passed three hours since the last day.
But phlebotomy which is performed in illness has not determined time; but when it occasioned convenience and necessity to it, at night, or by day, and at all times, and in all places.
And it is not necessary that boys should be phlebotomized until they are fourteen years old. Nor should a woman who is pregnant be phlebotomized until the fourth month up to the seventh. Nor should elderly people who have passed sixty years be phlebotomized.
When then whoever desires to be phlebotomized for any reason should wash his bowels well before phlebotomy with a laxative, if there is much feces in them: so that the fresh blood does not attract the eyes of the phlebotomist from the intestines when it flows, which injures the chief parts.
Do not let the patient suffer from fainting, that is, nausea; nor do they have a cramp, nor does their sweat come from drunkenness until they get rid of it themselves. Nor is the patient ill with hydrops.
And let the phlebotomy be repeated after a colic passion, and vomiting, and flow of blood, and increase of sexual intercourse, and work, and exercise, and vigils, and fasting, and any that dissolves virtue out of the bodily or animal realm.
Then consider with subtlety the humors before that, if the blood is thick with food and drink and medicines: if it can be made possible for him.
Then let him bathe in cold water, if he does not forbid anything: or let him exercise himself in some kind of exercise, that the blood may be refined.
And let his phlebotomy be placed in his chest, about the third day as we have said: and be careful so that his chest is emptied of all animal bad accidents on that day: such as anger, fear: and all body accidents, such as work, punishment, excesses, and the like.
And let him make his own presence of such things with which custom of men runs according to the use: from aromatizing, and fragrance, and revelry, and similar things through quantity of possibility.
Then let the phlebotomist sit on a raised chair, that it may be higher than the one where phlebotomy is done: then he shall take his arm out and rub it with his own hand twice, or three times. Then let him tighten the ligature with a strap, and turn it two times.
And let the constriction be of moderate tension, for a constriction that is uneven, or by excess in the constriction, then it forbids the course of blood: or in softening, then also it forbids the course of blood.
Then after the constriction, let the phlebotomist rub his hands together, face to face, until they are warmed, and present a sensation to the sense.
Then the phlebotomist dried off the bleeding with a little oil, according to custom.
Then he put his index finger of his left hand on the vein where he wanted to take the bloodletting, a little: so that the blood doesn't run away, and so that the pulsation isn't interrupted. Since it is from the veins that bleeding takes place like a running string during bloodletting, and from those that are full of blood: and when you put the phlebotome on it, it is pressed under the phlebotome, and the phlebotomist is deceived, and it does not open the vein: and if it does open it, it is tight. Therefore it is necessary for the phlebotomist to tighten it, and be diligent in these things.
Then put down the phlebotome. If then one vein opens out of many, then it is good. And if not, then go back to the other vein a little below that one, or above it with a rush: if not, choose a place.
Which if it is put out of joint, or causes pain to the patient, then let go of it for a day, or two days: and do not tighten the ligament. For maybe it draws the blood because of the heat. And don't put it in the bath.
Then go back to the bloodletting, if he loves it.
Which if the opening is small, or the blood runs gently: and be careful not to lose a quantity of blood which you wish to take from him: then go back with the phlebotome into that same hole, and add a little to the procedure.
And do it quickly, before that place is put out of joint, since this place goes out of joint in many people during the procedure.
If then you see that he has already been bloodletting, then don' go back to that place at all, for nothing excuses you with him for anything. And put something of animal fat on the top of it: since it soothes the course of blood. And it is better in this place than itself oil, and how other olive oil.
And similarly apply oil of olive to all your phlebotomies, when the course of blood is prohibited: and make that tyriaca alfarach, and the red sage, when it is put from one of them on the spot.
For the blood is thinned and resolved when it is thick.
If it has happened in the spot of phlebotomy a big apostema, for many times it happens, especially to him who is not phlebotomized but only that time, or is a small opening of the vein, then put right and place over the spot a sponge steeped in water and salt, heated slightly: and tie it one hour: because it is resolved.
And it should be that you do that after the exit of blood from his own vein, with its complement, or from another vein.
That if it remains in the place after a certain time of blackening or of the color green, it does not harm that: and if there is a vein, put over itself some oil, or of myrrh dissolved: or some juice of mint, that is, of calamus or similar to it.
And many times happen apostemata and eminenties at the phlebotomy of the Basilica.
So put your hand over it, then if it is soft and damp when you compress it over itself, then that eminence is bad. Take care so that you put over it some of what I have said. For perhaps blood will flow from it of the artery.
But put a plaster on him with what is there that stipticitas, so that the place endureth. Then take care of himself with the other cure, until he is healed.
And it should be that you keep from every man all his blood after the quantity of his virtue. And what seems from the color shining over the blood.
For if the blood is black, then let him not go out, until it shines red: and likewise if you see him thick: then let him not go out, until he thins out: and likewise if it is sharp, then let its sharpness be taken away.
He who is full, strong, and inclined to the extraction of blood at once, so that the phlebotomy of the veins may be increased, and the phlebotomist be wide, should sit on his left side; but he who is feeble should sit on his right side.
And it is necessary that he should extract himself in the viscera, and that the opening be tight; and it is better if that which is administered in the phlebotomy of the veins is transverted section, not a puncture.
And this mode of phlebotomy is salutary against the flow of blood, and from incising a nerve; and it is more praiseworthy and healthier than phlebotomy by width and length.
And he who is accustomed to falling ill after phlebotomy, let him eat a little bread soaked in grape juice water; or secernatabine, if it be warm; and let him extract the blood in three viscera, or in four.
And if his complexion is cold, then let him take before phlebotomy bread soaked in honey syrup, or in honey syrup seasoned with spices, or in syrup seasoned with odorous substances.
That if it happens that syncopes occur after phlebotomy, and is a cause of the exit of blood much: then let him drink in a cup water of meat, and syrup of odoriferous things: and he should use fragrance with algalia, and rub his breast while so: and let him use the rest which we have said in the division about syncopes from discharge.
But he who wishes to let his arm go and let his blood flow again: it is necessary that him to whom the phlebotomy is for a great euacuation, and whose power is feeble, should let his blood flow little by little through a quantity of power in continuous days.
But he who wishes to let his arm go and let his blood flow again, and whose body is strong: then let him do it after seven hours, or nine from his first phlebotomy.
Whoever wishes to draw blood from his own body towards the opposite part to that which he inclines should do so on the second or third day.
But in case the body of this person has much blood that has been warmed and has become sharp and causes fever: it is necessary that he should go out of his body in one direction and draw out a great deal of blood, and increase the opening until fever occurs: after you have kept all the conditions of phlebotomy: and so that you place your hand on his pulse at the course of blood, so that death does not occur at the site of syncope. For many times this has happened when the phlebotomist does not know and falls by neglect.
And it is not appropriate when you wish to draw the arm and draw blood on the second day, while the opening of the vein has already closed, and the exit of the blood becomes difficult so that it presses on him with a sudden movement, and it bends quickly. For this is bad to draw suddenly, far from letting go until the second day of phlebotomy.
Or if you wish to move it with sharp phlebotomy that has coagulated blood in the opening of the vein, and place a little dissolved salt on him in water. And place a little of the tarry fluid or sage green on him, and place the person under compression, until blood comes out.
But if the vein has already been stretched, then let go of it, and do not press on it until it relaxes.
That if necessity forces to draw blood on the second day, and there is no excuse, then either phlebotomize him above that place or in another arm in another vein.
But if you draw the arm of a person at the place of Fusca and Basilica, when they are not found and hidden, since it is composed of them:
And the quality of this phlebotomy is that he should put his weak hand in warm water until it turns red, and the vein appears clearly.
Then tie it above with a slight constriction of the ligature in the middle. Then make a second incision below, gradually and not straight across, nor along its length; and let the opening be wide and your phlebotomy shall come therewith a little over the tourniquet.
If it is forbidden that the blood should flow out, then again put your hand in warm water and let the blood run into the water until you have eased your need.
But if it were summer days, then you should be excused from putting your hand in warm water. And indeed the course of blood in warm water is put forward many times in wintertime.
And this kind of phlebotomy is healthier for all the limbs, since there is no pulsating blood under it, nor nerves.
But phlebotomy of the right hand does indeed confer health on patients with liver ailments.
And the quality of this phlebotomy is such that you should tie the hand with a tourniquet and, after you have put it in warm water, until the blood hardens, and it is clearly felt to be very hot. Then make the incision across it. And if you cut it entirely, it will not hurt him in any way.
And keep your hand away from the phlebotomy. For under it are the nerves of the fingers bare from the flesh.
Then again put your hand in warm water and let the blood run into it. For if you do not put it in warm water, the blood will clotted up in the incision, and it is forbidden to flow along its course.
But when you have extracted the quantity of blood necessary, then put on the incision oil and salt: so that it does not quickly harden.
And likewise you should do, as you do with every tight ligature.
But the binding of the phlebotomy from the left hand is: for it is conferring on patients with sicknesses of the spleen: and likewise do you in this phlebotomy as you did in the second one in equal measure.
The treatment of the saphenous vein, on the other hand, is for ailments in the lower part of the body such as those of the mother, retention of the menstrual fluids, kidney infirmities, old ulcers of the hips and thighs, and similar ailments.
And the quality of phlebotomy is such that one should dip his sick foot into hot water; and he should make friction there until the blood comes up; and he should tie a bandage above the ankle with a strap. And the place of the vein is near the heel, visible towards the thumb; and many branches sprout from it and extend on the face of the foot.
So phlebotomy should be done in one of its main branches, or at the heel where it originates; for it is better and more beneficial.
That if you phlebotomy on the face of the foot, then be careful of the nerves that lie under it on the surface of the foot.
And place your phlebotomy where you want to phlebotomy across from it, as if you didn't want to hit it directly: and let the phlebotomist be seated.
If however the exit of blood is prevented, then turn his foot again into hot water: and let the blood not run in it until it has drained.
That if the phlebotomist's vein is missed in the first attempt, then continue with phlebotomy to some degree higher, for the place is sounder; and do not wait on it with evil intent, when you are drawing from the nerves, as we have said.
And also with the saphenous vein of the other foot equally.
The location of the sciatic veins, as we have said, is near the heel from the sides of the pine tree.
And the treatment of this phlebotomy is for the pain in the ankle, when there is hot blood.
And the quality of this phlebotomy is such that one should dip his sick foot into warm water and walk; and tighten his shin with a string from the ankle up to the heel, four fingers wide, not revealing it for anything else: for it does not appear except for that reason.
When therefore it appears, then cut off the vein in accordance with whatever ability you have, or according to transgression; and it is better, or as if you were to strike it with an incision, or sever it by sectioning. For the site of this is healthier, and itself is a great secret in many people.
For the site of this is healthier, and itself is a great secret in many people. If it is not enlarged and does not appear at all to the sense: then cut off some of its branch, and that which appears on the back of the foot and toward the ear; and cause it to run with a certain quantity of blood that you want.
Then loosen the bandage tightly, and place flesh over the site of phlebotomy, and tighten the spot. For it is quickly healed.
Regarding Ventilation, and quality of use.
The vents are made from horns, and from air, and from heat.
And Ventilation is made in two ways. When with scarring and extraction of blood: and the other is ventilation without scarring.
And this Ventilation which is without scarring, is in two ways. Or indeed is with fire. Or is without fire.
And the ventilations that are administered with scarring and extraction of blood are four-십여 places in the body. Of which one is Ventilation of the Crown, and it is lastly of the head: and Alkhel, and is in the middle of the neck: and ventilations of Al-Hadhdahim, and they are two layers of the neck on both sides simultaneously: and ventilations of the mind, and is under the mandible in the lower mouth: and ventilations of two spatulas: and ventilations of Al-La'il at the end of the tail: and ventilations of two fires, and they are in the middle of the two arms: and ventilations of two chaps: and ventilations of two calves.
And indeed does not extract blood from you from small sparse veins in the flesh, and because of it does not fall virtue from them, such as is the case with phlebotomy. It is not appropriate that the application of tar be done with fire or without fire in any illness that occurs from fullness until the whole body is emptied.
If necessity compels to the application of tar in illness or by custom, we shall administer it at the beginning, end, and middle of the month, and at any time.
That is because a person becomes bald when blood multiplies within him until it needs to be extracted by tar application, and finds himself bald, and does not remain except with shaving.
And among them is he who finds fullness and redness on his face, his head, and his neck. And among them is he who finds itching on his face, his forehead, darkness, and dullness in his eyes.
And among them is he who scratches the place where he applied tar. And among them is he whose laughter multiplies. And among them is he who finds the taste of blood in his mouth, or who spits it out with his tongue, and does not remain except by drinking blood. And among them is he whose sleep multiplies. And among them is he who sees in his sleep blood and redness, and those who have been slain, and plagues, and similar things.
When we see any of them, and especially if it is in the middle of the third month: We order tar application to be done after two or three hours have passed from the day.
But the application of tar on the back is this: because it brings baldness to the head, and it drips down to the eyes. But it is appropriate that it be done after the whole body has been emptied.
And this tar is a place of phlebotomy on the head.
And it is not appropriate that he who has a cold complexions should use it, or in whom there is a croupy cough. For it causes great harm.
Since they are not old enough to use these, nor do they have any diseases of cold in their heads.
But those who become too accustomed to it, lose their memory.
And for this reason, you should tell Ventosator to put his hand down a little when he is blowing on it, out of fear of losing his memory.
Ventosation or Al-Khel is the place of the phlebotomy of Fusca, and the phlebotomy of Basilica, and for this reason it confers asa-mus, and constriction of anhelius, and fissures of the instrument of anhelius, and coughs, and fulfillment.
And it should be that Ventosator is blown a little by Al-Khel, because if it is put down, it generates weakness in the heart and stomach.
Ventosation on the other hand, confers pain on accidental injuries in the head, and on the eyes, and on headaches, and on piercing, and on pain in the roots of the teeth; and it is the place of the phlebotomy of Basilica.
And you should tell Ventosator not to touch the skin with his scarification instrument so that he does not hit an artery and cause a flow of blood.
But Ventosation under the chin, confers alcohol in the mouth, and corruption of the gums, and similar diseases that are in the mouth: and it is the place of a different kind of phlebotomy, which is in the two lips.
But Ventosation with the spatula, confers to Al-Khajah, which is done by a replexion and heat.
Ventosation of the inner parts confers a favor to phlebotomy of the three veins, Basilica, Fusca, and Cephalica: because she herself attracts blood from all those small veins that are in the flesh: and these small veins attract those other larger veins until they reach the attraction of the three.
It is necessary that you do not let the scalpel go too far into the scarification: for the place is stripped of flesh, and under it are nerves and arteries.
But the ventosa which is applied to the anus, it brings hemorrhoids and ulcers of the lower parts.
And you should order the scalpel to be big, and that it is made of iron: because the place needs strong suction, and perhaps the fine scalpel are broken: and let the scarification be done with a big scarification.
But the ventosa of the legs diminishes the visible reduction: because they attract blood from all over the body, and bring old pains in the veins, and membranes, and vesicles: they induce menstruation, and bring fever, and constriction: and stand in the place of phlebotomy of the two saphenous veins, and alhorcobeni.
But they weaken the body very much, and make many people faint.
And the alhorcobeni of the ventosa is a near relationship to the iuuamento of the two legs of the ventosa.
The quality of the position of the ventosa is that you put the ventosa in the first place, and suck with moderate suction: and do not prolong the position of the ventosa, but put them quickly, and move them quickly, so that they go to the place of exudation equally: and do not stop repeating this and continuing, until you see the place already red and swollen, and the blood appears: then therefore scarify, and repeat the suction slowly. Then consider in the disposition of the bodies.
For he who is of tender flesh, and few pores, it should be scarified once only, not more: lest the place be ulcerated.
And order the scalpel to make the scarification bigger, and deeper a little: and moderate the suction in ease, and speed, and smooth motion.
That if there is grossness in the blood, then it should be that you scarify him twice. Indeed, the first incision opens the way for the subtlety of blood, and its watering; and, indeed, the second is for the exquisite examination of the extraction of gross blood.
If the blood is indeed putrid, then let the third incision be made: so that the result may be the last.
And to the end, when we wish to extract blood little by little, or a little at a time, one incision is sufficient for us. That if we wish to extract blood many times, then let us make multiple incisions.
And if we measure, that the blood is thick: then it is necessary so that a deep incision should be made: and the equal term in the incision, is the depth of the skin.
What is that which needs to be administered from oils at the placement of vents, and what does it cause?
IN that which has the skin thick, hard, dark and whose pores are tight, one should anoint the places of the Vents with open, soothing, حل  oils: if it is in the time of summer, such as is a strong oil, or a mild oil, or an almond oil, or a seed oil of cucumber.
And if it is in the time of winter, then olive oil, or violet oil, or chamomile oil, or sage oil: and these are similar.
If the superfluity is thick, cold: then let there be bitter oil, or olive oil, or alburnum oil, or annerbitz oil: and these are similar.
If the wind is of large pores, tender flesh: then one should prohibit from oil, and it should be washed after ventilation with rosy water, or cold water, or sun water, or cucumber water, or portulaca water: and these are similar.
But that which has blood of much moisture, washes the vents with vinegar, or with myrtle water, and sumach: and these are similar.
Whoseever are the fluid excesses, wash them away with old wine, or with water of samshuk, or with a decoction of aniseed, or of chamomile; and for these alike.
And it is necessary that the cooling should be done in a bath or in a foot-bath; and it is necessary also that an administrate after leaving the bath for one hour, or two hours.
And it is not necessary that anyone should sleep after cooling.
What is it, then, for which the treatment of cooling and phlebotomy is administered before cooling?
And after this, it is necessary that you consider first of all: if the person is bilious and his blood is sharp and inflamed, then he should take cooling things, such as granatum muzum; also vinegar and lettuce, with secani-bin and juleb; and similar things.
And put before him the foods that dry up his flesh, and meat of a kind to make him thirsty, and prepared foods with grapes: and similar things.
And if his disposition is cold, he should take in a drink of syrup of honey, or of mulberry, or of secani-bin made from seeds; and he should take medium wine that is sharp, which is between sweet and sour; and let it be commanded that he eat sparingly. And put before him the foods that dry up his flesh, and tarragon; and pigeons, that is, many birds: and let him eat pigeon-meat often baked.
And it is necessary that the drink of the day after cooling and phlebotomy be stronger than food; and it is necessary that a medicine be given in a drink to some men containing tyrrhene or alfaroch, or a remedy made from musk, that is musca-ta, or alselith before cooling: and before phlebotomy, or after it, so as to comfort the main limbs, and subtilize the blood. They should not take it out of a hot pot.
On Ventosis without scarring. But the venesections that are without scarring, are venesections that are put on the skin, and the liver, and the spleen, and on the belly, and places of the ribs, and the anus: for these limbs do not endure the scarification on themselves.
And it is not sought after them, except that the blood flow from one member to another: as we put the venesection on the breasts in a flu of blood from the nose. And we use them, that we solve a cold venesection on one member to another: as we put the venesection on the belly, and the umbilical cord. For it itself tightens the member, and warms it, and moves away the pain, because it has solved the venesection.
Also is put on the kidneys, when it happens to them a deposit, or a stone. For with his virtue of attraction he might perhaps open a deposit, or eradicate a stone from its place.
And also does when it is put on the liver, and the spleen next to a venesection that should heal in them both: for he moves away the pain from them.
And these Venesections are administered with a sharp knife with only a slight cut. And when they are administered with fire.
And sometimes they are administered full of warm water in the case of a pleural illness: and that is so, so that the venesection is large, and there is only warm water, or water in which herbs have been cooked.
Form of administration of the Venesections with fire.
Let the width of his opening be two fingers wide, according to which we made it: and let the quantity of it in the depth be half a palm: and let it be in the back of its side which is near the middle of it, small hole, second to the quantity that it is cooked inside itself: so it is made from brass, or yellow copper, large margin, soft, equal, third: so that it does not hurt the member at its position on itself: and let it be in the middle of it a wire crossing from brass, or iron, where a candle is put with fire.
And this has also been very useful, greater than we have described, and less by a little, according to the disease and age of him who uses it.
For young people, the winds are useful, and others, which weaken, greater than the winds that men use, and for those who have large bodies.
The quality of this wind-making when set on fire on a limb is such, that you kindle the linden wood with fire from off-center linen, or place a small candle made of wax: and put it on the middle of the arm across-way that lies in the middle of the wind-making. so that the fire all around may be lower than the wind-making, so that the body is not burned up.
Then let it be placed on the limb: and let the finger be placed over the opening that I said, as long as we hold the wind-making: while we are holding it, let us take off the finger, and steam will come out over that opening, and the wind-making will immediately cease.
Then set fire to the linden wood in the manner described, and do this again if you can bear it.
But the wind-making that is administered in pleural pain with water has no across-way limb or opening; and it is not administered, unless it fills with water, and is placed on the limb only.
This is its form.
And this wind-making is the better when it is larger, so that it takes in a lot of water, for that is good.
Regarding the suspension of blood-sugar.
Blood-sugar is not administered in many, unless the limbs are unable to take wind-making, because of their smallness, such as the lips, and gums, and things like them. Or in a naked limb, like the finger, and the nose, and things like them.
And the quality of using these is such: that you may come from blood-sugar which are in sweet waters, clean from corruption.
Then they are to be discharged and given sweet water to drink at night until they become hungry, and there is nothing left in their bellies. Then the body is to be evacuated first with bloodletting, and then with vomiting. Then the nurse washes the member with water, until it turns red. Then they place them on top of him.
When therefore they are filled, and fall down, and it is possible to suck the place with a poultice, then it is more final in healing: and if not, then the place is to be washed with vinegar. Then with a lot of water, and it is to be rubbed, and pressed out.
If the course of blood is prolonged after the fall of blood from the wound, and it is that residue: then put a linen cloth in cold water, and place him upside down, until the residue falls off.
If the blood multiplies, then dust is to be sprinkled on him of oak bark, or of hickory, and similar things from a styptic: until the blood falls off.
Or that they are placed on top of the place half with ground oak bark: and they are to be left until the oak bark adheres to the place, for the blood is shed.
And it is necessary if the necessity requires a change of the wound, when it is possible, to change them.
If however they are prohibited from suspension, then the place is to be cleaned with recent blood. Or bind them now on the places, until something exits from the blood. Then they are to be placed, for when they feel some of the blood, they adhere immediately.
When therefore you wish them to fall down, sprinkle on them something from freshly squeezed aloe, or salt, or ash: and they fall down immediately.
This chapter is also very necessary in the art of Medicine, and it is the restoration of fractures, and dislocations of accidents in bones.
Know, O Sons, for this chapter is stolid to the doctors and people, and they have never examined the ancient book, nor read a letter from it.
And for this reason, for that this way of treatment is hidden from the sciences in our land. And I was not satisfied with it at all, and I have not been fully convinced by it unless because of the length of reading the ancient books, and study on their understanding, until I drew out the science of that from them.
Then, after I had come to the conclusion and study of a long life.
And then, I have described to you from that whole what contains my science: and beyond that which passed through my experiment, after I shortened it for you, and freed it from the occupation of elongation, and shortened it end by abbreviation, and showed it end by declination: and I formed in it many forms from forms of instruments which are administered to it, with the addition of a declination, as I did in two preceding Chapters.
Chapter II.
It is necessary that we say in the prolog of this chapter, the summary of the speech, and chapters, to which the understanding of the craftsman on the station of their health: namely, so that you, and who are eager, know, or learn this noble art, and others from you.
I say, then, that when it happens to anyone a fracture, or dislocation, or twist, or fall: then you should prepare first to phlebotomize him, and to solve it itself, or both at the same time: if anything prohibits this, such as weakness of virtue: or he is one whose accidebit something from the boy, or the old man's decrepitude: or is the time of a high fever, or cold very much.
Then be satisfied with his food, cold drinks, and meat of birds and beasts; and prohibit wine, thick flesh, and all food which fills the veins with blood. Until he is completely cured from his fever and does not vomit matter into the limbs: then let the sick one return to his routine care first with which his custom runs.
When the broken jaw begins to be healed, it is necessary that the sick eat food which is very nourishing and thick, in which there is a lot of juice: such as bread made from wheat cooked with water, and rice, and heads, and feet, and livers of animals, and eggs, and recent fish: and strong wine, and similar things. For with this regimen the clotting of the fracture is speeded up, and better.
And know that bones which are broken, when they are in years of senility and decrepitude, cannot continue to heal and harden after their nature always: but they heal and become firm in the end of leniity, like the bones of young boys of few years.
However, nature fixes broken bone from all parts with some kind of glue, in which there is thickness, by which it adheres and tightens to itself, until it joins together, and binds together, until it comes to the end of strength and firmness, as it was at first, until it does not prevent its functions: and for this reason it is necessary that you put nourishing food into the sick person's stomach, in which there are fats, and juice, and thickness, as we have said.
And know that the species of fractures are different, according to the difference of the limbs: for a fracture of the leg is different from a fracture of the head-bone: and a fracture of the breast-bone is different from a fracture of the back-bone: and likewise all other limbs differ from each other: and I come with a reminder of all species of fractures mentioned in their separate chapters from others. They also specified the species of bone fractures and even in themselves.
For the fracture is curved, except that which happens in it, the spines. And when the fracture is according to the length of the bone: and are fractures of his leg, that is to say, thorns, and additions proceeding, such as are in the reed, when it is caught with a knife for writing. And not proceeding: and is the fracture with the ulna and dislocation in the head: and is the fracture small crack.
And all kinds of art are there, or their own instruments for repairing it, according to the memory of it, distinct in its places.
And from that which is known the fracture of the bone, is its bend, and its eminence: and its appearance to the sense, and its sound when you compress it with your hand.
And when there is no bend in place, and the sound does not appear to you at your touch, when you press the bone with agitation, and it finds no great pain: then is not there a fracture, but possible that it be a bend, or small crack: so there is no need for you to move it by hand and compression at all, except put over it from among the physicians, of whose memory has come, after time it that comes to place: and then tighten it with a thin knot.
And know that the place when it bends, and is divided into two parts, except that which happens in it, thorns: but all part is removed from its companion: then you need to begin at your hours to straighten it, making equal before it comes the apoplexy of heat.
But if it happens to him the heat of apoplexy, then you abandon it for a few days, until he rests the apoplexy. Then make equal the bone according to any way you can from its slowness and art.
And know that the restoration of it, and its equality, is easier than the bones, in which happen thorns.
Then tighten it up, according to how you want to remember it.
If, however, the fractures are in the bones of the hand or foot, then it is necessary to extend this broken member from two sides, whether with your hand or with two strings, or with one string and one hand, or with two hands.
And your position should be such that you place the member on an equal location, according to its natural shape, until the parts of the broken member are extended: then strive, so that you can return these additions with all ingenuity, and in any way you can in their places: and carefully, according to your strength, so that pain does not come to the weak through your operation, or injury: and strive, according to your strength, that you apply one or two bones with his partner, according to better shapes.
And it is necessary at that hour for you to try and touch it with your hand. If, then, you see something far away, straighten it out, and make it equal in length to the amount of your strength.
And strive for a smooth extension, and a strong compression, as many do with the stupids. For many times, such a thing has happened to them through their own operation, hot or contracted in the member: as we have already seen this from their operations many times.
Then, after you have made it equal, and the operation is done, and tighten the member, and rest, and peace: and warn the weak about it. And let him try to calm down, so that he does not move himself at the time of his illness, and his sleep during his crisis, and his agitation during his digestion, and all his movements in his last strength. And if he tries to calm down, so that the position of the member is not a position that causes pain. That is, because when he feels pain in the position of the member's injury: then it is necessary that you change it to a different position from which he does not feel pain.
And care with him, that his position may be equal and straight; lest there be curvature of the member when he is restored.
And the quality of a broken bone's stricture is, according to which narrows.
You should know that broken limbs differ in their healing, and in their size and shape.
Which of them are small, such as the arm, and finger, and foot, and the like, then it is necessary that there be a softening of the soft cloth, thin. Which of them are thick, such as the hip and leg, then it is necessary that there be a broad softening, hard.
Since a broad ligament connects the large member, and tightens it with equal stricture, so that it does not enter it spot.
Then begin after you have drained it to place the liniment suitable for it, in a soft spot on the site of the fracture. Then begin to soften the ligament over the site of the fracture four times, or as much as the limb deserves; and grip your hand lightly with the ligament.
Then move it with him to the upper side of the site of the fracture, and grip less than what your own stricture was, which you gripped the broken place. Then lengthen yourself with the softening slightly from the site of the fracture, and soften the stricture gradually, until you take hold of a large object in place of the healthy member.
Then take another, and soften it again over the broken site with the liniment. Then move with it to the lower side of the fracture. And let your operation work on the softening and hardening, according to which we said in the first upper softening.
Then place between the softings a soft cloth, or cloth, with which to equalize the curvature of the fracture, if there is any curvature in it; and if not, do not place anything in it.
Then take off the bandage and examine the wound again. Then immediately remove the bandages that were applied to the wounds, if there is no inflammation or swelling, and check for any signs of infection.
If there is inflammation or a boil: then place something that will help the boil dry up and remove the inflammation; and let it go for a few days. Then tighten the bandage on the wound.
And let the bandages be made of pieces of soft leather, shaped wisely; or of pieces of wood from which are made mesh-like screens, made of pine wood or of splinters, that is to say, of palm branches, or of reeds: and let the size of each bandage be according to this form and figure.
However, it is necessary that the bandage which is placed on the wound should be a little broader and longer than the others; and its length should be determined by the size of the member and its proportion.
Then tighten the bandages with another one, following the first one's shape. Then tie it with loose knots at the top, as we have said before concerning the tightness; and let the tightness be greater than the broken part's location: and to the extent that the break extends, make the tightness less.
And let the middle threads in thickness and fine be made of soft leather.
For if the threads are too thick, as happens when they are made from the tendon-like cord of a sheep's belly after it has been stretched, this is a great mistake; for the tightness falls outside its limit.
And very fine threads do not suit either; for you will not achieve what you want by tying with such thin threads.
And it is not right that there should be less than the distance between a finger and its tip between one bandage and another.
For if a sick person is bound up by the ends of the bandages after the tightness at the healthy places: then place something soft under the bandages, or red wool, until there is no pain from it.
When however there is a fracture with the ulna, and there occurs a rupture of the skin, I will come to it with its consideration in the second chapter on its uniqueness.
And know that not every broken limb needs to be held with splints from the first day. That is, because the limb when it is big, does not need to be put on top of splints, unless after five days, or seven, or more, according to your security from the risk of oozing pus.
And this is the method of splints which the ancients used, which are placed on top of the fracture and dislocation.
The common shortened method of the splint, restoring the fracture, suitable for many complexions, especially women and children; because it is not from that one which hurts heat, nor cold.
And it is so that you take from the meal to be ground, and there is flour that hangs on the walls of the grinder at the movement of the mill; and you put it as it is, except that you comb it with white mortar: and you put its coating not thick, nor thin. Then use it.
The other method of the splint, restoring the fracture, and dislocation, and torsion. Take alum, and olive-tree, and acacia, and goat's hair, and mug; and juice of all 10 myrrh, and aloe of both sexes 5 and alethil 20 let them be mixed with water of alethil, or with white mortar, if the complexion of the wound is warmed. Then use this splint. For this splint is good composition, restores bones quickly, and suits many people.
The other method of the splint, which also suits fractures and torsion. Take mug, and alum, and alethia white, all 10 myrrh, and aloe of both sexes 5 and acacia 6 and bolus of Armenia 20 let them be mixed with a lot of water, or with white mortar, and let them be applied.
The mode of preparing poultices for bandages, and separate bones from their places; it will soothe their pain, injury, bone-cutting, and fracture. Take wet wool and dip it in vinegar and oil-infused wine; and place it on the spot.
And in this (type of poultice) there is no virtue of restoring health, but it is good for soothing boil-like swelling: and it drives away its own pains.
The mode of poulticing, which restores a broken bone. Take leaves from the oak tree and leaves from the plantain tree; and dry them thoroughly, and make a poultice out of both.
The mode of a shortened poultice, applied at the restoration of a bone fracture; and when you wish to resolve a boil-like swelling. Recollect root of the aloes plant, and camomile, and flowers of violets, and herb flour; all in equal parts: dry them thoroughly, and make a paste with wine, if it is not a member that needs to be warmed.
If it (the member) does need to be warmed, then make the paste with water and coriander seed, or with water alone, and use it.
The mode of a stronger poultice for resolving a boil-like swelling during the restoration of a member, rather than this one first, when it occurs. Recollect root of the aloes plant, and flax seed, and poplar bud, and mallows, and water-leaf plant, and flower of violet, and camomile; all in equal parts, dry them thoroughly, and make a paste with oak-water, or with sweet water, or with wine. All this depends on the heat of the member, and the relief from heat.
Hippocrates did not say, in his book, that a poultice should be placed on a broken member for its restoration, except one made from cerates and oil; nothing else: he related, that it should be of an intermediate nature between gruel and lightness.
Galen, however, considered it essential to apply these remedies on a broken limb while restoring its function, where there is drying up of heat, such as myrrh, and aloes and olive resin, and similar substances from those which we have mentioned.
The mode of use of the plaster which is useful for wounds and pain: Take myrrh, and chickpeas, and hair of men's heads, or feathers of birds, and resin, and equal parts of salt: crush them, and pound them, and form them into a plaster.
The quantity however, according to what is necessary, so that the bandage remains on, then dissolves, is such, as you consider then, if no pain does not happen, and itching, and the broken bone does not move from its place: then do not dissolve it over several days. If however it happens to him in the place severe itching, or disturbing pain, or swelling: then proceed, and dissolve at once, and remove the plaster from him: and take a cloth of linen, or sea sponge of linen, wet with water: and dip it into the water, and wash with it the place, until the itching is calm, and the pain subsides.
If however it happens to him in the place severe itching, or disturbing pain, or swelling: then proceed, and dissolve at once, and remove the plaster from him: and take a cloth of linen, or sea sponge of linen, wet with water: and dip it into the water, and wash with it the place, until the itching is calm, and the pain subsides. Then let go of the limb for a rest of one hour. Then put over it a cloth of linen dipped in vinegar and oil, or in oil infused with wine: and bind it on for the night, so that he does not come in contact with any hot thing, and the swelling of the limb subsides, and the pain of his member is calmed.
Then repeatedly apply to him a slight tightening, and a small plaster: and do not tighten him with your own hand first, and fine things, until he is healed.
That if you see that the swelling, and redness, and pain, and swelling, and all accidents are completely gone away, and you do not feel either the plaster or the tightening, then again apply to him as you did before equally:
If any of these things do not happen to a member, then do not remove it, unless after three days, or four, or five, or seven. And when the member is removed after forty days as it appears to you from the removal of the member, as we said, until the fracture is united and the clotting of the flesh over it: add also then more than your first stricture in all its parts: and add also in the increase of food sickness, according as preceded the recollection of it.
But if you see the place of the fracture already drying up and growing less than is necessary: then know that food should be forbidden to reach it. So wrap up the member with warm water at every joint, and let it rest for three days, and allow a little bit of pain.
By this operation runs towards the member food, and heals quickly.
But that which the stupid surgeons do from the fracture of a member, when they do not restore it first, according as it should be restored, and restore it according to the curvature, is an error from their operation, and a great fear: and if it had been right, the ancients in their books would have said so, and would have operated with it.
And I did not see anywhere their trace in that at all, and it is better that it should not be made.
On making an accident in the head.
There are various kinds of fractures and many forms of it: and its causes are separate.
For from the fracture is caused by a blow, and the blow carries away the whole bone as far as it reaches to the socket, which is under the bone, just as the ax does in the wood: and therefore this kind of fracture is called the axial fracture.
Or a blade cuts some bone, and cuts its face, and does not pierce the incision as far as its last part: and is called this kind of fracture the Kayan, that is, an absolute slant.
And it is a break of two fractures, or great, or small.
And from the fracture there is a rupture, or rubbing, and its cause is a blow with a stone, or a fall on a stone, or similar things.
And this fracture is also penetrating, which is beginning to approach the skin, which is under the bone: or it is on the face of the bone: and it is a break of these two fractures as well, either small, or great.
And from the fracture is that which is hidden in the bone in subtlety of a hair: and it is a small crack, and for this reason this kind of fracture is called a capillary fracture.
And from these is a fracture which is made by a fall, or by the impact of a stone, and similar things, which makes it so that a layer of bone is crushed and crushed on the inside: as happens in the case of pot-ash, when it falls upon it and it is crushed on the inside.
And indeed this often happens to that in the heads of moist bones, as are the heads of children.
And all these kinds of fracture separate and I remember them all together in their place.
And we know all these kinds of fractures by detection over them, and by questioning them with probes, and by cutting away the corrupted flesh that is on them.
Indeed this kind of Capillary fracture is recognized when it appears on the bone, and is scrubbed, and is coated on the top with caustics: for a black spot appears.
In the treatment of a fracture, first consider these nursing matters: if you see from these matters that which means a clear meaning on worry, such as cholera breath, and spreading, and loss of intellect, and deafness, and sudden speaking, and high fever, and red eyes, and similar things to these accidents in many dispositions, it is certainly not cured: and if you see that which does not terrify you, and you hope for healing: then begin its treatment.
If he comes to you wounded in the beginning when he is wounded: and that it is on the half-days, then you should study in the removal of bone before the fourteenth day according to all the arrangement.
And if it is on the days of summer, then you should remove the bone before the seventh day before it corrupts what is under the bone from a flap, and those accidents which we have described.
That if the fracture of the bone has already reached the flap touching the brain, and it is with small ones, and by attraction: then you should break off the broken part, crushed, according to what I tell you.
And it is, so that you shave the head of the wounded person: and you should detect above the bone according to any possible way for you: and according to the figure of the wound, and what is light is above the weak.
That if it happens to you in the detection of the bone, the flow of blood or warm pulp: then you should oppose it with that which is necessary. And it is, so that you fill the place with rags soaked in wine, and olive oil: and make the bone rest until the pus stops, and you are safe from the flow of blood. Then begin in the cure of the bone, and in its removal.
And that should be done according to one of two ways.
The way is one, so that you break the bone with a sharp chisel: and this is the form of it.
And there is another way, so that you administer an Incisory other after an Incisory wider by a little bit: and this is the form of it.
Then also administer an Incisory other wider than the second.
And the second way is, so that it is with you a number of Incisors different: some are wider to some, and some of them are shorter to some: and let there be at the end of their acuity their extremities, and let they be made of iron, or oil: and let you use convenience in striking over the Incisor, so that it does not wound the head, and hurts itself.
If the jaw is strong and firm: then you should perform incisions around it before administering incisions with blades that do not cut deep: and they are not called so unless they do not pass beyond the bone to that which is behind it, because the temporal bone is round at its extremities, similar in shape to the tip of the jaw, and a small circle prevents it from sinking and passing through the thickness of the bone.
And it is fitting that you take from these temporals a large number, of which each corresponds to the thickness of the bone, until you have all the cranial Temporals: the extremities of whose sharp ends are in length and brevity according to the thickness of its bone.
And this is the shape of the three types of temporal bones, or craniums.
The quality of the cut around the fractured bone is: when you place the temporal bone on the bone and rotate it with your fingers, until you know that the bone has already penetrated. Then change the temporal bone to another place, and put what is between all the pores of its thickness or around it.
Then cut with the blades between all the pores from the bone, and make it thinner than you can from its edge of lightness, as we have said, until you have cut through the bone, or with your hand, or with any other tool that you have prepared for it: such as scalpel and fine forceps.
And you should be careful not to touch the temporal bone or any of the blades from the skin.
When you have finished cutting around the bone and it is separated from the skin, if it is continuous with it, and you extract it: you should cut, and equalize its end that remains in the bone with another blade similar to the incisor. However, it is fitting that it is thin and subtle rather than other blades.
If there remains anything of the small bones, and of the sagittal bone: then take them easily, with that which is with you from the instruments. Then care for the wound after that with linen, and with the ointment which we have spoken about.
And another mode of the operation is easy, verily far from fear: which said Galen, and praised it highly: and this is his speech. Necessarily it is you in the first place, that you begin to grasp the side of the bone in the place where the fracture is more severe and more manifest: until when you have grasped it, and put this lens-shaped incisor under it, whose this form is.
And the lens-shaped part, gentle does not incise anything: and the acute sides of it rubbing in length, as you see: that the lens-shaped part is placed on the siphum, the face of it incidently acute into the bone.
Then strike over the incisor from one side with a little mallet, until you strike all the bone with ease, as it is turned over: and you are safe from the pannicle, which does not happen to it at all, that there does not occur in it what you fear verily.
And if the medicant is not stupider of men, and more ignorant of it, and is not asleep, then if there remained anything attached to the bone from the pannicle in some places, he would strike him from it with the end of the lens-shaped incisor, and free him from it with ease. Is liber is liber: et sicut diximus, non uel in uellicione, sed in locis illius, cum ossibus paruis ex panniculo:
For it is free and without harm: and as we have said, not in the place of the incisor, but in his place, with the small bones from the pannicle: then, if the fracture of the bone does not penetrate to the pannicle, and that which is separated from the bone is the face of it, and there remain in it roughness and subtle sagittal: then it is necessary, that you rasps this roughness, and plucks out these sagittals with fine razors from which you have prepared a number of diverse quantities, so that it is possible for you to administer them in every place convenient for them, and righter for them, according to the one which leads you to the operation, and the fractured bone, and its form. It is necessary that you cut with your razors, at first, the roots of the teeth widely. Then use a thinner razor after it.
It is necessary that you cut with your razors, at first, the roots of the teeth widely. Then use a thinner razor after it. And do not cease doing that in succession, until you have come to cut them all with the thinner and more slender ones.
In each of the small gaps between the teeth, and in the slender hairs, and in the tiny crack, it is necessary that you exercise care, according to that which brings about its correction.
And it is a thing that does not remain hidden over all, to which in this art is any study, and stands on that which we have written and shown in the large cracks.
If however a little patch is caught and held back when you cut the teeth: then it is necessary that you take a piece of linen cloth, according to the quantity of blood, and dip it into rose oil, and place it over the opening of the wound. Then take another piece of cloth, doubled or tripled, and dip it into wine and rose oil, and place it over the first cloth: and make it so that you can do it as easily as possible over it, so that it does not itch.
Then apply over it a wide bandage: and do not tighten it, unless by the quantity which holds the wound only: and let it go with this cure for one or two days, until you are free from scabs. Then dissolve it, and apply after it the medicines with which dryness is unnecessary: such as the roots of lilies, and the flour of herbs, and the dust of thorns, and the aristicola, and others like them: and it is, that you should make from these medicines a powder, which you spread over the wound like those which are dry.
And apply generally in it all the medicine of the property by which it cleanses and does not bite. And take care, according to your power, that the wound in your cure is clear: and that it is not in it any resin of ointment, or any dirtiness.
And take care, according to your power, that the wound in your cure is clear: and that it is not in it any resin of ointment, or any dirtiness. And do not leave the virus to aggregate therein at all; for when the virus aggregates on the brain's skin, it corroded and rotten, and happened upon the sick one a great evil: and indeed it happened in the head's pit when it was opened from it a mouth, especially when its care was neglected, and blackness appeared on its surface.
Therefore, consider then, if accidents happen to the sick person which we have said, you will know that it is certainly dangerous.
And if blackness does not happen, except if a medicine is placed on it, and it is in the power of that medicine to make it black: then you should take from honey one part, from rose oil three parts, and with them a cloth. Then put the [head] on the pit: then take care of it with cure species which are appropriate, until it heals.
Of restoration of the nose when it is broken.
You know that the nose is not broken unless both of its upper parts break at the same time, or one of them; for it has two bones: indeed, its lower part is cartilaginous, and does not break, nor does it happen to it except for wear, and wrinkling, and stretching.
If one of its two parts breaks, then you should put your little finger in the nose's hole, and align the break with your index finger and thumb, until it returns to its natural shape: and do this with ease. And so, that the pain does not happen to him by your operation,
That if the break is in the upper part of the nose, and does not reach the tip of it with a finger: then you should even out its edge, where there is little thickness.
If, however, the break is in both of its parts, then you should make it similar: and properly take care of its restoration on the first day that it broke, if possible. And if not, then after the seventh day, or tenth day by the heat of apotheosis calm.
Then introduce into the nostril a licineum made of linen cloth if it has been fractured in one part; or introduce two licineums if it has been fractured in two parts: and let the thickness of the licineum be such a quantity as to fill the nostral hole.
And some ancient restorers said, that they should be filled with licineum in butter, and should be changed every day. That is not the truth, but it seems to me that it should be filled with licineum in albinus when it is finely ground with powder for grinding. Then let go of the licineum until the hole has closed up and the cartilage has hardened.
And sometimes when a goose feather is introduced into the nose instead of licineum after it has been wrapped in a soft cloth; and this does so that the fracture in the nose is held more firmly together, and prevents the sick from being prevented from breathing.
This is not necessary. If you want to do this, then do so: and if you want to use licineum, then use licineum.
What if, while you are operating, the nose becomes hot again because of the heat of apotheosis; then fill the nose with hamamelis, or with a little oil infused with rosemary, or with a little diacetylmonosodium.
But if the heat of apotheosis does not occur, then it should be filled with a paste made of sisa flour and a thuris powder mixed with albinus. Then put on the nose a little wooden chip, and do not stick the nose with anything at all.
But if the nasal bones have been broken or crushed, then you should split them open and take out the bone with the instruments that are suitable for this purpose. Then cut off the skin, and take care of the nose when it has been ingrown, and consolidated by the paste that is suitable for this purpose, or with ointment.
If a fracture occurs between the nose and upper jaw, then it is necessary to treat the person with liniments: and administer a lead tube, until healing takes place.
The restoration of the lower jaw, when broken.
When the lower jaw is broken, and the fracture is not with the ulna: examine then if it is only a fracture of the bone, and does not break into two pieces, and treat internally: then it is easy to know.
Therefore, if the fracture is in the right part of the jaw, insert your index finger of the left hand into the hole: likewise, if the fracture is on the left side of the jaw, then insert the index finger of the right hand: and push it towards the outside with ease from the inside with your other hand, and thus adjust it evenly.
If the fracture of the jaw has already separated into two pieces, then it is necessary to administer extension from both parts, according to the straightness: until the adjustment is possible.
But if it has already happened in the teeth, a movement or rupture: then tighten them with a gold wire, or silver, or silk thread. Then put over the broken jaw of the wound. Then put over the wound a doubled cloth, and put over the cloth a large piece of skin cut to fit: or a fragment of sole skin, equal in length to the jaw.
Then bind the wound from above, according to how you prepare your bindings, and the application suits him, until it is not destroyed: and instruct the sick person to use tranquillity and silence: and provide him with soft food.
But if you think that something has changed in some way: then come closer, and unravel it on the third day. Then straighten out what has been changed from it, and patch up the wound with flour ground, mixed with chalk, or with semolina, after you have removed the wound: and put over the patch wool yarn.
While that attachment remains on the wound, and the bone arrangement does not change, release it, do not separate, until healing: or hold the fracture together. For this fracture is often tightened for seven days.
If, however, a fever arises during the time of the compression, then administer to it what I have said frequently in the sedative [treatment], until that apoplexy removes itself.
And if the fracture is with the ulna, consider. Now I separate the little fragment from the bone, or from the saw: then, with this care, remove those fragments of the saw when you have it ready for removal from the instruments.
But if the wound opening is tight, then widen it with the phlebotome in the quantity required by your need.
Then, when you have removed those saws, and there remains none of them, then close the wound opening if it is wide; and if not, cover it with the plasters that suit it and let it be grown in until healing:
As for the restoration of the fork, when it breaks.
The fork is often broken in the front part from the shoulder, and its fracture is made in one of three ways.
Or if it breaks and separates into two, except that they fall into the sawing: and it is easier to restore it.
Or else, so that they happen in the sawed bone: and it is more difficult for restoration.
Or else, so that it is with the ulna.
And the operation in it when the fracture is without the ulna, is, as you make these two ministers hold one of them as an aid that follows the broken fork, and the other extends the neck towards the side.
Then make the length of the fracture of your fingers equal, until it has the right shape, and there is no prominence or protrusion in it;
If you can bear a greater extension, then place under a tickling ball of cloth or wool; and let the size be according to the quantity of your need: and extend, and ease the fork, and grasp the ball in your hand, until the fracture is even, as it should be.
If you cannot bring the end of the fork to the outside because it goes deep in: then let the sick one lie on his/her side: and place under his/her armpit a pillow medium in size; and press the minister of his/her humerus towards the bottom, until he/she lifts up the jaw of the fork that is in the deep to the top: and then, correct the fracture, and make it even with your fingers.
If you feel a bump from the fork, and it moves: then let you find on it, and pull out the bump with ease.
If it is stuck in the bone, then use the incision tool that you prepared for it, after you have placed under the fork an instrument to hold on to it: and this instrument is made of wood or iron. And this is its form:
It is joined to a shell-like one that is not closed.
And its width is according to what you can bear from the size of the bone, and its thickness. Its length also is according to what is possible for you in the operation.
And it has two ends, as you see: and one end is wide, and the other is narrow.
If the wound that you made when you pulled out the bump of the bone is wide, and it dries with warm exudate: then join the two lips of the wound with a suture.
And if the break is small, or the exudate is not warm: then fill the wound with cloth, and dust according to the quantity of the cut of the wound.
If it happens that the exudate is warm, then pour on it cloth in olive oil, and vinegar, and wine, and place on it.
The stricture of the bone is, when it is without the ulna, and without sectioning, such that you put on a bone splint made from flour ground with white lime. And place a wooden stump over the bone. Then place a ball under its tip, if you can endure it. Then take the blood, that is, the roll which the Saracens hold, which is long and great: and let its width be that of a palm or about that. Then place a double layer of felt over the stump and splint. Then take an astil from a thin board, whose width is that of three fingers, and its length similar. Then wrap it in a cloth. Then wrap the cloth with the astil at the Alkemist's place that lies over the fracture and spot. Then place the Alkemist over the fracture as a roll, and wrap it over his neck, and under its tip, healthy and under its tip, sick: and bring it back to all parts, so that you see how the stricture holds the fracture together: and this is so that it does not hide on top of you, and completely, so that it does not move the astil from above the broken bone. And for this, it should be, so that you see the sick one every day. Whenever you see the ligament loosen and the astil move: then straighten it out, and tighten the ligament.
Then place a pillow of medicine on his back, and under its tip put a very thin one by his side at night, so that when he turns it helps him from that side. Then the fracture in the femur is healed by elevation of the shoulder.
Or ligate his arm to his neck: and do not loosen the ligaments, unless an accident happens by scratching, or from a slumber, until twelve days.
Then cut a splint, if you see his face towards that. And add to the contraction, and let him go, until he is healed and coagulated.
And that break of the fork is tightened and strengthened according to many in twenty days: and when it comes to some people, less so.
¶ Of the restoration of the fracture of the spatula.
Rare is it that the Spatula breaks, and in its place a wide piece: and do not break from it except for the edge of it.
When therefore it breaks from that place, and it breaks in the middle of it, and is not known except by touch: then according to what its figure is, prepare the treatment of it. And reduce it over the natural form at all your skill, which is possible for you.
Then put on top of the place powder to be ground with chalk and a wooden stick, and put a flap of cloth above it. Then put on top of it an iron plate from a thin board according to the quantity of the whole Spatula, or wider one than that a little.
But if under the plate is squeezed in some place of the whole Spatula, then make that same squeeze with soft wood, until the plate comes down according to equality.
Then wipe off from above with long-haired cloth, with a constricting pressure coming down, and with the firmness of the plate, until it does not move away from its place.
And consider the ligature every day. Whenever that is softened, tighten it and make the plate equal if it moves away from its place: and lie on his sick side.
And the Spatula is restored in twenty days, or in fifteen.
When therefore that number is completed, then dissolve the ligature: and you are in safety. For that itself is of bones whose connection does not fear, and is not there of their solution.
If however it proceeds from a fragment of bone, and pierces through the skin: now cut above it, and remove it. And do as we have said about a fracture of the jaw from the heat of apoplexy, if anything happens from it.
[On the restoration of a fracture of the breastbone.]
The breastbone is sometimes fractured through and through, and this rarely happens. Its extremities are more frequently broken, and they are destroyed by the accidents which befall it.
When the middle part is broken, which turns downward, and happens to him a violent pain, and difficulty in breathing, and perhaps he spits up blood, and it appears that there is a fracture of the breastbone, and it does not hide the sense, The restoration is this: let him lie down on his back: and put between his shoulders some feathers.
Then press his shoulders together, and press his ribs from both sides with his hands: and make him even by the application of a subtle force, in accordance with all possible ways that it may be made to fit, until he has recovered his shape, according to what is necessary.
Then put over it a plaster and a board, and put under it an axle of a light table, or of similar material, and let it rest on that: for when you have bound it up with cloth. Then make him even by applying a subtle force to the bonding of it over the broken bone, that it may not move: and sometimes turn him with the binding, according to its roundness to his back, and tighten it by a tightening force.
Then consider the bonding at all times, and always tighten it when it becomes soft, and if necessity provokes to solve its problem by itching, or a corruption which happens in that place, or pain, or fever: then approach, and loosen it, and remove the plaster, and set aright what has happened in the way of curing it.
Then reduce the plaster, if you see to that face: and bind it tightly until it is healed.
The restoration of the ribs when they are broken.
You know that a rib fracture does not occur, unless in the places far from the back and from the extremities of them to the front. And they do not suffer wear and tear, except therefore, because they are cartilage. And the knowledge of this does not conceal itself from the sense in inquiry when the fingers touch.
And the restoration is done so that an equal fracture with the fingers in a second possible way, until it is even, because it is necessary to restore it. Then apply the plaster, and tightly bind the broken jaw with the strap, if it needs that.
And if the fracture of the ribs is hidden toward the inside: then a severe pain occurs, and a pricking, like that which occurred to him who had pleurisy; because the jaw stings the windpipe, and also it occurs to him difficulty in breathing, and coughing, and much blood loss: and this is a difficult cure.
And already the ancients have devised many methods for this: and among them are those who say, that you place food to generate inflammation and windiness, so as to inflame the belly, and to spread it out, and to push the fracture toward the outside.
But we dislike, so that it is not made a habit of quickly doing an emetic, if it does not happen. But if it has already happened, then add this to it.
And some of them said: Let him lie on a windy place, and then blow over it with force, and it is similar to reasoning. But it is feared that the windiness will attract superficial fluid toward the place, because of the weakness of disposition.
And some of them said: It is necessary that the place be covered with wool which has already been submerged in hot oil: and let there be placed feathers between the ribs, so that it is filled: so that the binding becomes equal when it is rolled up according to its roundness.
The sick person will recover from pleurisy with food and medicine.
If the person is forced to lie on an infirm bed, which he does not tolerate, and the nose pricks with a piercing wound, hurting the patient, and we are afraid of the sick man: then it should be that we cut him off from the place, and discover the broken ribs. Then let us place over it an instrument that preserves the siffa, whose memory precedes: and we will cut through the nose easily, and we will cut out the same one.
Then let us gather together two lips of the wound, if it is great with a suture: and let us heal him with plasters, until he heals.
If it happens during the period of feverish swelling, then let it approach, and pour oil with rose water onto the place, and put him on: and heal the sick person with it as is suitable for the swelling.
At that time he will also recover from the side where he sleeps, until he heals.
For the restoration of a broken spine of the back and neck.
For the bones of the neck sometimes there is a fracture, and it rarely happens that they are worn out: and also for the spine of the back. So when it has happened to someone, and you do not know whether he will heal or not: then trust it. For if you see his hands already softened, and stupefied, and dead: and cannot be moved, or extended, or squeezed together: and when you squeeze them with your fingers and prick them with a pin, he does not feel it, and does not feel the pain in them: then you know that he is not healed, and is mortal in many dispositions.
If he can move them and feels the constriction with your fingers and the prick: then you know that the spine of the neck is healed, and that the sick person will recover with treatment.
If it is similar to that of the spine of the back, and you do not know whether he will heal or not: then look at his feet: if you see that they are softened, and what happened to his hands has happened to them: then when he lies on his back, he moves and moves without volition: and when he rises on his belly, he moves without volition: and when he rises again on his back, and wants to drink, but cannot: then you know that it is mortal. So do not perform surgery on him.
If, however, he does not suffer from any of those conditions, the matter is less serious.
And the cure for him when he suffers from any of those conditions is such that you should bring him to a state of sedated sweat: in other words, so that you put on him only rosin-oiled cloth; or when he is bathed with warm water.
Place over it several times a day until he sweats; then place over the site one of the supporting splints, drying and tightly wrapped around him with the bandage; and instruct the sick person to rest and remain calm. And let him not lie on the injured side until he is cured of his pain;
If, however, it happens that the bone is separated from its attachment, or something that has already become detached from it; then you should remove the flesh with care and get rid of it. Then take two pieces of leather, if it is a large wound, and join them together with sutures. Then care for the person when he has an infection from the skin, with ointment, until he is cured.
If, however, the bone is finally broken at the end of the lower limb and the foot is cut off: then you should insert the thumb of the left hand into the joint, and with the right hand, according to what can be done, and by equalling it in length.
Then place over him, and remove him; and care for the wound with the cure that preceded it until he is cured.
For the restoration of ankle joints.
Chapter XI.
Rarely do the bones of the ankles break. If they break, then their fracture is not complete; they split at the ends of the bones and decline towards the inside: and a sick person experiences pain in that place, and a burning sensation: and the leg which breaks becomes numb.
And for the restoration of it, you should extend your hand over it, until you stand on the fracture as though it were a pillar.
If the fracture is only in its extremities, then make that fracture equal, according to how you are prepared, until it is similar to its natural figure.
But if the fracture is in length, or has already turned towards the insides: then make the sick one lie on his stomach, until his fracture is prepared for you to restore it. When you have made that equal, then place a plaster over it: and then place over it a wooden or leather splint, and tighten it with such a tourniquet that you do not fear the fracture's movement, nor the removal of the splint.
And with that equal concavity make it full, until it takes that form: and order the sick one to sleep on his back, or on his healthy side.
But if there should happen to be a heat in him: then cease from extending it, and from restoring it, until the heat subsides: and place over him who sits what sits, according to how it has preceded, and then return to its restoration: and tighten him as it should be.
But if it has happened in the bone's shattering, or has been broken, extract it.
For the restoration of the fracture, Assistant.
The assistant is that which is between the trough and the head of a spatula.
But if it is broken, then its restoration is according to two ways.
One of which is: that you take a flat piece of wood of medium thickness, according to this form, which follows.
And bind together in its two extremities with two ligaments.
Then hang it from a raised place: and let the sick one sit on a chair. Then he will put his broken arm over the wood, until it reaches to its tiny bit, into which is attached the wood's smoothness.
Then hang it from above the sick one with something heavy, so that he extends himself towards the lower. Then let the physician treat both hands together until the fracture heals, as it should.
And another way is that he lies down on his chest with his hand suspended from his neck by a bandage. Then command two servants to hold one of them up above the fracture with their hands: and let one hold below it and stretch out his hand on each side.
And if you wish to make the extension stronger, then tie a strong bandage under the fracture and another above it, and stretch out the two servants' hands on each side.
If then the fracture is near the edge of the shoulder, then a bandage should be tied under the collarbone, and another above the fracture towards the hip.
And likewise if the fracture is near the hip: then a bandage should be tied on the spot, and on the hip itself.
Then let the fracture be made equal with ease without effort, until when it is made equal as it should be, and applied with good application: then tie it up, if there is no swelling of heat.
But if a swelling of heat does occur, then let the tightening be loosened until the seventh day. And place on the person a woolen cloth soaked in vinegar and olive oil, until when the swelling is still active: then tie it up: and the way of tying it up is that you place a plaster above the fracture.
Then put a new woolen cloth over the plaster. Then he will stretch out his arm above his aide, and place his hand open on his shoulder.
And then put the cloth on, and tie it above the aide's arm, so that the arm remains in place by the stakes: if it does not prevent you from doing so, and there is no disturbance on you from any broken bone.
That if you wish to use stakes: and it is, so that you place on the fracture a stake which is wider and stronger than the others: and let him who does this work be skilled in using the stakes. And place the width of the hand between all the stars: and let the length of the stars be according to the fracture with the addition of three fingers from every side.
Then bind firmly on top of the stars the constriction that I spoke about at the beginning of this chapter.
And let your binding be tighter than the place of the fracture by that which I have spoken above. And as the fracture grows longer, so let the constriction become less.
If then you see the length of the stars and the constriction, as we have said, at the time when you restore the limb immediately, then do it: and if you wish to let go of the swelling and the coldness, then leave off the constriction and the stars until the seventh day, as we have said.
Then consider the binding on all three days so that there does not remain any itching or swelling, nor does food come to the limb by way of the binding, because of the swelling's tendency to burst. So straighten out all that, according to what we have said.
If then you are not confident, so that nothing comes out of it: then do not let go of the binding until after three days or more.
And let there lie on his back, with his hands on his belly, and put under the pillow a bed filled with wool, even.
Then consider at all times of night or day, so that the broken limb does not go loose, nor do the bindings become soft. So straighten out all that with your skill.
And provide for the nurse food according to the order that we have given, so that there be food of low quality at first, until the mouth begins to heal: then it should be provided, so that it grows heavier.
For the custom of the binding and the arm is that it should be bound for forty days; then therefore let it be loosed, and administered a bath, and treated with an ointment that makes it right.
If then the fracture were foul, ground: then do not let go of the binding and the stars until after fifty days, and until two months.
On restoring fractures of the brachial bone.
The arm consists of two bones called "humeri.
One is small and it is the one that follows the thumb. The other is large and it is the one placed below the little bone.
Perhaps then the larger femur alone breaks, or the smaller one, or perhaps both break at once.
When therefore the smaller femur breaks above, then its restoration is easy, and its healing is easier.
And when the smaller femur breaks below, it is a bad fracture, and its healing is difficult.
And it is worse when both bones break at once.
But if the bone that breaks is the small one above, then it belongs to the physician to restore it with ease by extending the small one until it is even.
But if the broken femur is the large one: then it should be tightly bound with a strong bandage.
And it should be done so that the hand assumes a certain position in restoring it, and that its extension extends beyond the elbow joint. And let the thumb of the hand be placed higher than all the fingers: and let the flexor muscles be extended in full for each finger, or else not; and let the person sit on a square with his feet before him, or straight in front of it, in height so that he does not suffer any pain.
Then extend the arm from below, by hand, or with a bandage. And another minister should extend it from above.
Then the physician should level the bone so that he can reduce it into the best possible position.
If there are any segments broken off in the fracture, then take care to restore them to their places with your own hand.
But if it appears to you that there is a break in the bone and it pricks the skin, and there is no hope of restoring it: then find beneath it, and remove it according to the method which we have described in those preceding this.
If, however, there is a fracture with the ulna, I have already done to that chapter singularly, so take care of him from there.
If, however, there is a fracture with the ulna, I have already done to that chapter singularly, so take care of him from there. Then put on the splints, and let the splint that is put on the fracture be a bit wider, and stronger.
And know that the number of splints for the arm is six in various arrangements: whether it is a fracture in one lock, or in two locks simultaneously.
Then put on your splint in a stronger and more robust place at the site of the fracture, and slightly more with the splint toward the upper part of the fracture, or toward the lower part: or put on a softer splint slightly according to what precedes the memory of it at the beginning of the chapter.
And let there be cloths wrapping around the fracture, soft, wet fabrics; and not let them be hard, rough. And let there be a thread that is tied with linen thread itself, between thin and thick, as we have described.
And consider the member and ligaments after days. If anything needs to be corrected, like an itch that occurs on a member: then one should immerse the member in hot water until the itch subsides, and remove the member not restricted, until it subsides, and then repeat the splint.
If the splint is already softened, and the bone is already removed, and similar things: then correct it completely with your skill, and consider again.
For if the nutrition is prevented from reaching the member due to an excess of splint, then one should make it slightly softer, and leave it for a few days until it heals, and then tie it up.
If, however, none of those things which we have said happens to the sick person, then it is not necessary that he be healed, unless after twenty days or about that time.
Then hang his hand from his neck. And let his neck be kept straight, and let him guard with virtue his own strength from restless movements. And let him sleep on his back.
And know that this fracture is restored in twenty days, or in thirty-two, and perhaps it is restored in fifty. All of this depends on the condition of his constitution, and the condition of virtue.
[Regarding the restoration of broken bones in the hand.]
Know that it is rare for a bone of the hand, or a knuckle of the fingers, to break. And it does not happen to him, unless by frequent rubbing.
When, therefore, a bone is broken, or there is a bruise: then let the sick person sit in a sitting position; and before him let there be a seat on which to sit, with equality. Then put his hand on it, extended.
Then the surgeon shall extend the broken bones and make them equal, until such time as he can join them together with a good joint.
Then let there be applied plaster and a splint, if there does not happen to be a hot swelling. Then let the plaster be applied from above, according to the quantity of the place; and you have already bound it with linen cloth.
If, however, the fracture is lower down, about the wrist-joint, then make a sort of sphere out of linen; and order the sick person to bend over it with his own wrist-joint that has been broken: and then bind it tightly with the linen cloth.
And let there be a soft plate of copper, so that it may apply to the body with ease; and let it be bound tightly, according to what is necessary.
If, however, the fracture is external, then it is necessary that you put a plaster from above, and another beneath in the foot: and let the hand be kept open and straight. Then put on a bandage, as it turns around the hand: and extend between the fingers with a ligament.
If there is a fracture of any of the bones of the fingers, then if it is the thumb, it should be treated according to what needs to be done. Then tie it with a splint: and if you want, put a straight bar, smooth: so that the fracture is held fast, and does not move.
If the fracture is in any of the other fingers, such as the middle finger, index finger, or ring finger, then it should be tied to the finger that follows it: or all of them should be tied together according to their length: and this is better. Or put a splint on top of it, as we have said for the thumb.
And consider in your treatment, and after that arrangement of the bandage with warm water: and oppose it as needed, when anything happens from it, according to what is its story.
On the restoration of a hip fracture.
The hip bone is often broken and can be recognized: because it turns towards the inner and back parts.
And the restoration of it is done so that a bandage is put above the fracture, and another bandage is put under the fracture. And the sick person extends his hand on his face.
Then he should extend all the ligaments to their side according to equality: and this, when there is a fracture of the middle bone.
If the fracture is near the root of the hip bone, then a ligament should be tied to the pigtail side, so that it falls on extension towards the top: and another bandage under the fracture.
And in the same way, if there is a fracture near the knee, then a close ligament should be tied to the knee, so that it falls on extension towards the bottom.
Then the doctor should make the bones of both hands fit together according to their natural shape: and join the bones with a good connection.
Then you should put on a poultice and bind it tightly, if there is not an apostema in the member. If there does happen to be an apostema in it: then let him be absent from his duties for a few days, until the apostema is removed by heat, and then return to your business.
But bind it so that It is necessary that you wrap a cloth around the fracture hard, that is, bind it: and double it up twice, or three times: and let remain from it an excess. Then wrap the leg, until it reaches the heel bone of the grown child.
And insert a long thread between the coxis and the leg close to the knee towards the bottom, and make the two ends of the thread come from the top part of the two parts. Then wrap the leg and the coxis that which is in excess from the cloth.
Then put on the coxis, in the place of the fracture, stars, and put one star on top of the bone of the leg.
Then fill with wet cloths between the leg and the coxis so that it is tight.
Then begin with the strong bandage from the middle of the place of the fracture three times around, or four times. And as much as you increase by stretching the bandage away from the place of the fracture, your bandage is smaller and softer, and gentler.
Then go towards the two ends of the thread, which you have inserted between the coxis and the leg. Bind then with the two stars that are on top. Then move with the two ends of the thread down, until you reach the ankle bone of the leg. And also tighten the ends of the bandage from the other side: so that the bandage does not move away from its place.
Then remove the bandage off of it while it remains on, so that there does not happen to the member corrosion, or an apostema, or swelling, and such things like them. If something happens from it. Therefore proceed carefully with the washing, and adjust it completely as before, as we have said many times.
If, however, there is a fragment of bone that pierces the bone: then it should be made even as before, if you can do so. And if not, find above it, and move that; and care with it whose memory is before it, until it heals.
And when this fracture of the hip joint is tightened, besides the fact that stars are added to it, as we have said in the arm and shoulder.
However, in restoring it, such a fracture does not lead to limping. And if restored alone, besides that an other leg is applied to it, then it is necessary that he who has it should always limp.
And you should know that the hip joint is tightened in fifty days, or added a little, or slightly shortened: all this depends on the difference of the complexions, and the remaining dispositions.
Of restoring the fracture of the knee joint of the leg.
You should know that the knee joint of the leg rarely breaks, but it often occurs by wear and tear.
If a fracture has occurred, then there is either a crack, or a hole, or an opening in its parts. And it is with the ulna, and without the ulna. And stands completely on that side with regard.
And the restoration of it is such that it adjusts what has been broken from its parts with the fingers, until it comes together, and joins together in accordance with what can be done by adjustment and ease, and by making.
Then put on a plaster of rice flour, or to be ground, with egg white: and put over it a round bar, if you can bear that: and tighten from above with a suitable tie that goes to it.
Then consider all the dispositions which we have spoken of in the other broken parts: like heat apoplexia, and similar to them: so that you may oppose every accident with regard to what is suited to it, until it heals over.
Regarding the restoration of fractures of the leg.
Know that there are two bones of the leg, one is large and called "leg bone": and the other is fine and called "shaft".
And it happens to both species of fracture which happens to the two bones of the arm: and for that reason the restoration of this is made like the restoration of the arm evenly, and the operation is one.
If both bones break at the same time, the leg becomes deformed in all parts.
And if the fine bone breaks, the leg is deformed towards the front.
And if the large bone breaks, it injures the lower part: and it is of these which do not hide from you.
Then administer stretching, and equalization, and binding of the joints according to that being even.
However, if the fracture of the leg is a bad one, it has many things: so that there should be less stretching, and gentler relief for you.
And in the leg itself there is some operation similar to that of the arm: and it is, as when you make the joints equal, and complete all your operation, then take two strips from the wood of pine, which is used in making sole pieces which are placed under tables: and they are made from palm leaves: and choose from them which have little thickness, and there are none from the small ones: and let their length be according to the length of the leg from the knee down.
Then sew over a single piece of cloth on two strips of linen, according to its length. And put one side of the leg from one side, and the other from another: and let them be from the knee down to the foot.
Then bind the two strips at three places from the two ends and the middle. Since stricture is prohibited, the leg leans towards the right and left, and stands in a good position.
And already let there be administered a cane from wood according to the length of the leg, and let it be placed in it so that it keeps it from moving.
And indeed it is necessary that you do this for a fracture when it is a simple fracture.
Then consider the bone every day, and study it with great care from apoplexy, or inflammation, or any other thing. But if anything of this happens, then oppose it to him as it should be opposed, until he is healed, if God wills.
Of the fracture of the bones of the foot and the fingers.
The heel does not occur a fracture within.
But the bones of the foot do sometimes occur when a fracture, and the fingers also sometimes occur a fracture, and they do not occur to them unless it is a tearing in many places.
That if a fracture occurs to the bones of the foot, and you see those bones sliding one over another, then let the sick person put his foot on the ground prepared like a walker.
Then stand you, and put your foot on it so that it rises from those bones: then press on it, or trample on it: and make it even, until it comes back to its places.
Then put a plaster on it, and a strap from above: and put under the foot a flat board with two flat heads.
Then tighten it with a band around the foot that is tightly tied down, after you have wrapped it with cloth, and with anything else that it needs.
When therefore they have passed over three or four days, then loosen the ligaments. For you will find the bones even if they are broken, or are out of place. The operation then is on them as you see it.
But if any of the fingers are broken, then restore them, and make them even according to how you have told me in the restoration of finger bones of the hand. Then put your finger on a little splint according to the length of the finger, and make it a little wider: then put under the foot this board that I have told you about, and tighten it with a band that is tightly tied down.
If the fracture is indeed from the bones, two, three, or more, then put a staff of its quantity on all the fingers, rolled up in a cloth: and tighten the board in the lower foot; and stand with one head of the board outside the navel of the foot, so that it holds well with retention.
And it is appropriate for you so that you do not forget, except that you consider all that I have said to you regarding the remaining fractures from the accidents that we have mentioned: and oppose every accident with him that is necessary.
Regarding the fracture of a woman's vulva, and of the bones of the breastbone and spine.
When the vulva of a woman is broken, then let her sit square. Then lean her slightly toward the back of her own side and hold her behind.
Then the midwife fills the woman's vulva with cotton, until she is filled: and let it be made in the vulva from that with which a sphere is made.
Then the woman is shaken, and her back is raised little by little. For that cotton will come out, until it goes before the door of the vulva like a sphere, and the broken jaw returns.
Then put a cotton ball on her back. When she then wants to urinate, let the cotton move with ease, and then urinate: and reduce it according to the way that you put it in at first: and then return it to her first cotton.
Let it be made for seven days, or about, for the jaw itself is restored: for it is made again.
And if you want to, take a white feather, and tighten a reed tube on its hole, and insert the entire feather into her vulva. Then blow into the tube with force, until the feather bends inside the vulva, for the fracture returns.
Then fill it with cotton, and stand a few days, according to what we have said, until it heals.
When the skull of a man or woman is broken, then administer to it the restoration and correction which we have described for the bone of the cheek.
And the rectum is not hidden in those who are close to him, which happens little, especially if he has some study or use.
And understand my book very well, because the fracture itself tells you in many ways about the right way to restore your own health and tighten it: so understand.
But when the man's skull is broken, take a goose's throat; and insert the staff into it. Then put a cloth over the wound and wrap it up; and leave it for three days or so, and it will heal, if God wills.
On the restoration of fractures of bones, when they are joined with a fracture of the bone.
It is appropriate for him who has suffered a fracture of the bone, especially if it is large, such as the hipbone or an aid, or similar to it, as you think fit, and stop the flow of blood: if you are allowed to bleed, as we have described above.
If the blood is flowing, then you should, as you think fit, cut off part of it so that it turns into dust on top of the wound: if you do not have anything else at hand.
Then begin to restore the fracture in the same day: and do not put off doing it, unless there is a bruise.
But if a bruise has become hot, then do not administer the restoration until the ninth day, until it cools down. And do not approach him on the third and fourth days at all, for you would make bad accidents happen to him.
But if a bone is broken and stands out above the skin: then you should seek to reduce it and make it stand firmly with your hands, using a slight force and extension.
If, however, the extension is not prepared and his equinoctium with your hands: then reduce him with this instrument. And it is an instrument that is made of iron, the length of which is the quantity of seven fingers, or eight; and its width is according to the quantity of the wound. And for this reason it is necessary that the doctor should take from them three or four according to the quantity that he needs for the cure of any kind of fracture.
And it should be round: and it should have little thickness so that it does not double itself under pressure on it at the time of the operation: and it should have an acute extremity, which has a rim in its extremities. And it should be above its thickness by a third of its length from its lower end.
This is the shape of it.
It is necessary in this operation that its acute extremity should be placed curved on the end of the prominent bone: and push it with a single blow, until when it returns the bone and equips it with some équation.
Consider therefore to make the ends of the fracture face each other at right angles.
If its ends of the fracture are thin and does not take it with a good grip, then he should, that you hit the end of the bone, until the instrument can get a grip.
But if you cannot reduce them at all with what we have described, then cut him with it from the incision which we said: or saw him with a saw of any kind that is possible for you.
Then pare away what remains in the bone from the roughness and small bark.
But when the bone is reduced and finds itself weak after its reduction, with a painful and annoying pain, then you should know that the bone has not returned to its natural place.
Do this then. For you have a great handicap when your restoration is complete which repairs the bones.
Then dip the cloth in astringent wine, black. And especially if it is in summer. And do not place it on a rotten splint, nor anything where oil is: lest it cause decay and corruption in itself.
Then administer the medicine at the hour of your meal from restoration of bone. And release the nail that is driven in: so, that you do not come to harm with pliers in the event of a second wound according to the quantity of the wound.
And take all precautions, do not tighten the nail with a fracture. For many times the ignorant physicians have done this: and they have caused to happen to their patients or death or corruption or putrefaction, that is, disease. And be your bandage soft, gentle, diverse from the strictures of broken bones.
That if the nail is bad, or is a large nail, and you wait for some misfortune to come that we have described, and suspend pain in the place: then it is not appropriate that you should place the nail on the splint. And make them solutions from tough cloths in the place of the nails, and tighten the nail with them.
When, however, it is after one day, or two days, and you see the nail beginning to form pus, then remove the cloth that you placed on the nail with the wine. Then administer licorice, and oils with which we are accustomed, to heal the wounds: such as the oil of four-fold mixture, and similar to it.
And it will be well with you, so that you release the ligaments. And consider the nail every day, morning and evening, until it is healed, and has healed.
And it should be prepared for the limb so that pus can come out of it with ease to the lower parts.
That if there are many days of wounds and it does not heal, nor does the pus come out of it: then you should know that there are small bones in it. It is necessary to inquire about the fracture with the tendency. How many of those false joints are separated, remove them and pull out the same. And which of those false joints are not separated, and piercing the limb, and causing pain, try to cause it, and remove it in any way possible for you that one.
That if it is a wound that has been chafed, or ekileten, that is, hematoamas, or any other kind of corruption and putrefaction: then you should oppose each one of them with what corresponds to it in healing, the description of which precedes in its own chapter.
And from this, in which it is necessary that my speech should stand, and to which you should pay attention when the jaw is broken, and emerges onto the limb, like the hip bone, and assistants, and similar ones from large limbs, that is, do not suppose attraction of it, because often it happens from it death, but leave it until it putrefies.
Perhaps it will fall by itself after twenty days, or thirty.
Then, therefore, take care of the fracture if you have it: and otherwise, leave it alone.
On the treatment of a nodulation, if there is one: and otherwise, leave it alone.
This nodulation often occurs in the process of healing a fracture. terutama that which is near joints: and it grows out of the shape of the limb. And perhaps prevents the limb from its natural function.
Consider therefore then, if the nodulation is new: administer to it medicines which have a constricting effect, such as aloe, and olive oil, and myrrh, and oak galls, and acacia, and similar ones.
So that you take some of these things, or all of them: and bind them with a bitter wine, or with white of egg, or with vinegar: and put them on the nodulation in a poultice, and tightly bind them with a good constriction.
And loosen the bandage, and do not take it off for many days. Then remove the bandage, and put on a new one, until the swelling goes down.
Or tighten with a lead strip laid斜 across. Lead is good for removing whatever fears the body.
But if the swelling has already settled into the stone, and is fixed, and the need to remove it is urgent: then find on top of it and cut off the surplus: or else saw it off with some chisels, until you remove it: and take care of it, until it heals.
As for the treatment when it is restored, and remains a limb after that, not in accordance with its natural shape.
When a bone fracture is restored, and remains a limb that is weak, then it should not be used for any great cause. Of which one is, a multiplicity of ligatures and their tightening not being in accordance with what should be: or because of the surplus stricture of the ligaments, until food running to the member is forbidden: or because of the multitude of embalmings that are superfluous at the wrong time: or because of the scarcity of blood in the body, and its weakness.
And the treatment for it is, to feed the sick and make the body light: until the blood increases in it. And apply a bath. And introduce joy and gladness to him.
Then place a piece on the limb: so that the piece attracts much food to it. And persistently apply embalmings with hot water, until food runs, and returns to its natural shape.
As for the treatment when broken bones are restored that have been twisted out of shape.
When it happens that a member is restored after its cure, and there is a prominent bone fracture or swelling: and the shape of the limb is altered: but the limb should not be forbidden from its natural function: so you need not object to its breaking again.
There were also many foolish doctors and healers who did this thing on our land.
And yet this operation is most dangerous, leading to death or great fear, as if it were mortal.
But if the claudication and fainting are recent: then it should be soaked with warm water, in which the softening herbs have been boiled, such as the leaves of aloe, and its root, and mallow, and similar ones. And let there be made for him a plaster with a softening plaster, like that of dandelion根
Or take the mucilage of the root of aloe and mix it with chicken fat or oil of sesame: and let it be applied with it.
Or take young fig branches, and pound them with the clay of columbine, and similar ones which are called to reduce consolidation.
And when the fainting has ceased through persistent, ancient, and gentle rubbing, which is done with wet hands. And let the member move in all directions.
But if the curvature has already preceded, and it is strong, and has turned into a rock, and there is a need to treat it with iron: then let it be cut above, the continuation of the bone be removed, and that which exceeds from the curvature be taken away with very fine incisions: and let ease be given to it with care and diligence.
On the treatment of dislocations.
A dislocation is the exit of some joints from their place. Why it is prevented by its own motion, and is fixed in position. And does happen to cause great pain and painful wounds.
But when such a dislocation has happened, then let it hurry to restore it: and do not delay it at all.
For if it is delayed, the place will be infected, and there may well be a recurrence of the dislocation with it.
Therefore, it is not appropriate for him to move or extend himself at the time of examination. Because he often causes a spasm to occur and hurts with his movements.
But when that happens, then you should approach the wound with care. Then he should be dismissed until the swelling subsides.
Then the member is to be warmed with warm water and oil. Then it is to be reduced with ease.
And all members are to be cared for with their respective treatments.
I have already arranged the chapters on dislocations, also regarding the prior fracture, from the upper part of the body to the lower.
§ On the treatment of a dislocation of the lower jaw.
The two jaws are rarely dislocated.
And the dislocation of the lower jaw occurs in one of two ways. Or, on the other hand, they move away from their places by a small distance and become slightly softer. Or they are dislocated with an intact and complete dislocation until they become soft to the breastbone, until they salivate with care, and they cannot hold it, nor can they close their mouth, and their tongue is extended with a hiss.
When, however, the dislocation of his jaw is small, then it returns to its place by itself with a little difficulty.
But if the dislocation is complete and intact: then it should be administered to reduce it quickly, and there should be no delay: and it is as if the doctor held the head with his hand at the base of the jaw's dislocation between its teeth, if the dislocation is from one side. Or introduce two fingers simultaneously, if the dislocation is on both sides. And the remaining fingers of his hand are outside, which makes it even.
And recommend to the sick person that they clean their jaws and allow them to eat fully. And the surgeon should make the jaw equal and push it back to its place.
If it is difficult to reduce it, especially if both jaws are involved: then administer perspiration with warm water and oil until the reduction becomes easy: and do not delay the reduction of the jaws at all, as we have said.
When they have healed and been made equal, and the jaw has closed, and the swelling has not subsided: then place a few cloth pads on them, with a ball of wax that has been made from wax; and oil rosin.
Then it is bound together easily with soft ligaments.
And it should lie down on its back: and the head of the patient should be placed between two cloth pads so that it does not move to one side or the other: and it should not be forced to chew anything: but its food should be soft, so that when the pain goes away, the jaw can open: then it may eat what it wants, and administer it easily.
It should not be troubled by the operation of its mouth during eating and drinking, and whistling, until the jaw has healed and become well.
If it is difficult to reduce the two jaws when they are dislocated at some time, and do not return to their places: then frequent fevers and sodas occur: and perhaps intestinal congestion occurs, and perhaps pure choler is lost.
So when you see this: then know that it is a sign of death, and many times that person dies within ten days.
On the reduction of dislocation of the furrow and the extreme of the arm.
The furrow does not dislocate from the side due to the continuity of its connection with the chest. And it dislocations when and where it goes outwardly: and announces this to the sense.
And its restoration is so that it lies sick on its back, and extends its arms. Then bind the place with your palm and bandage it strongly, for itself will come back.
Then put a plaster on it, and poultices, and tighten it.
The extremities of the leg, which follow the hip, and continue with it, are rarely dislocated, unless by rare chance. If it is dislocated on any day: then let it be reduced and adjusted according to what we have said, and that you be prepared.
Then put a plaster on it, and poultices, and bind it tight. And command the sick person to adhere to peace and calmness until he is healed.
And with this same treatment the limb of the shoulder blade is reduced when it separates from its place as well.
On the Reduction of Dislocation of the Shoulder Blade.
You should know that the shoulder blade is not dislocated unless by three means.
One of which is that it dislocates to the tickling side toward the lower part. The second is that it dislocates to the side of the chest. And perhaps it dislocates to the upper part of the shoulder blade: and this is rare.
And does not dislocate to the rear due to the spatula. And does not dislocate to the front due to the nerves.
Indeed, it is very often that the shoulder blade dislocates and comes out towards the lower part next to the tickling: especially in those whose flesh is scarce. Because it exits them quickly, and enters them quickly.
But in those whose flesh is abundant, the opposite happens to it: that is, because it exits with difficulty, and enters with difficulty.
And perhaps happens to certain people a blow or a fall, and the shoulder blade comes out with heat: and it is thought by them that this is because it has already been dislocated.
Therefore, let it be known to you, so that you do not hesitate about this, until you are completely certain of its state, and then proceed with its treatment.
And it is known that dislocation takes place when it turns downward in relation to the nipple: and you distinguish between a dislocated shoulder and a healthy shoulder. For you can clearly tell the difference between them: and dislocation in the head of the humerus, and under the nipple at the touch of the head of the humerus as if it were itself: and the weak cannot bring his hand to his ear, nor move it in all its movements.
And likewise, if it is dislocated towards the chest or upward: then there is a distinct touch, and it is not hidden.
And of this dislocation, its reduction easily takes place when it is young, or the boy is weak.
And its reduction is, as he raises his hand towards the top. Then put your fingers under its nipple, and raise the joint with strength towards the top to its place: and the boy raises his hand, and extends it upward. Then let him put it downward, for he himself will turn it back quickly.
If he does not turn back through the above-mentioned means, and there have been many days since dislocation took place: then it should be, so that the weak man bathes in warm water, and applies a remedy which softens and relaxes, such as if they were cooked roots of aloes, and fenugreek, and mallow in water, and is applied.
Then the weak man shall lie on his back: and a sphere and wool be placed under its nipple, which is equal between relaxation and constriction.
Then the doctor shall place his heel on the sphere, and raise the head of the humerus with strength, and draw the nurse's hand downward.
And if you wish, reduce him according to this method: and it is as if you are present man who is longer than the weak one, and stands by his side, and places his shoulder under the nurse's nipple: and raise her nipple upward, until the weak one hangs in mid-air. And another assistant should hold the patient's hand at the base of his foot. But if the sick person is light: then it should be that with him something else is suspended so that he does not move it: for the dislocation comes back immediately.
And it is also reduced in another way: and this is that it is fixed on the ground a long piece of wood whose head is round figure: like the sleeve of the mortar: which should not be thick or fine. Then put under the sick person a cloth made of soft material after it is placed on the head of the wood: and let the sick person stand according to the length of the wood.
Then the assistant extends the patient's hand at the lower part of one side, and he extends his body with strength from the other side: for the connection returns to its place with speed.
That if it is difficult to reduce him by all that we have said, then use this care: and this is that you take a piece of wood whose length is the length of two arms, and its width is the width of four fingers, and its thickness is the width of two fingers: whose head is round, so as to relieve the entrance into the hollow, according to this form.
Then they bind on the round head a soft cloth so that it does not hurt the wood of the sick person.
Then put under the tickling assistant so that it extends the hand or arm over the wood to the lower part: and the wood is tied over the assistant's hand and arm and the end of the finger.
Then put the arm over the step by its width, and extend the hand at the lower part, and let the rest of the body be suspended from one side. For the connection enters immediately.
Since then it is finished entering in whatever way possible: then you should put under the tickling sphere of equal quantity of wool. Then place the preparated plaster made of powdered rose with olive oil and white resin on the whole shoulder, as it comes down from above.
Then tighten the bandage under the pressure of the swelling: and return the ligament over the splint above: and join his hand to his neck, and let it be, and do not move his hand for seven days.
And it is necessary that he take a little food for the sickly, until his member is healed: for it is quicker to heal him in this way.
Then it should be placed more widely after seven or five days, and he should be tested with movement. If then it remains stable and does not weaken, then he is now healed.
If on the other hand the joint dislocates many times, because of the moisture that occurs with it, or because of some other cause: then it is necessary, in order to administer cauterization with six pores, as was said in the chapter about cauterization.
What if all of this is done, and the ligament is allowed to heal over seven days, and the joint does not remain dislocated, and the splint and constriction over it are sometimes loosened, and does not firm up, and falls away, and he cannot raise it up again to his shoulder: then you should know that the nerves which are to the shoulder have already been cut, or extended, or weakened: and you should know that the joint will never be set in its place.
But if the dislocation is towards the chest and nipple, or towards the rear, it is done by an impact and extension with the hands: until it stops, and a remaining constriction and care is administered to it, until it heals.
What if after healing a little weight comes on the member, and there is a delay in its movement: then the sick person should take frequent baths, until this weight is softened, and return to its natural state first.
The Treatment of Dislocation of the Elbow.
You should know that the elbow joint dislocates with difficulty, and also heals with difficulty: it actually dislocates in all directions, and especially to the front, or to the back.
And his dislocation is not hidden from you: because it falls by sight and by touch, whatever form it takes. And when you join the dislocated hip with the sound one, that will be evident to you. For the joint will ache, and it cannot duplicate the arm, nor can it touch its shoulder with it.
And you must hurry to reduce the dislocation as soon as possible before the injury swells.
For if the injury swells, it is difficult to reduce it; and perhaps it will not heal at all, especially when it is behind. For every form of dislocation is worse, and the pain from it is more severe; and often death comes with it.
And the restoration of it when it has been reduced as much as possible is, that he extend his hand with two hands; and his arm be stretched out, and his fingers on either side of the hip, or on its root, pushing at the dislocation with the thumbs of his hands until he returns to his place.
Or perhaps the dislocation is forward: then he returns in such a way that he duplicates his hand with his own, striking at the hip which has been dislocated with the root of his palm until it hurts.
Which if it does not obey the reduction, then administer a fierce, sharp extension; and it is as if two ministers extended his arm: and let them hold him too, so that he does not move during the extension.
And then his arm turns around to all parts after it has been wrapped over its hand with a long cloth, or with a broad strap.
And when the doctor touches the dislocation with his own hand, he should wet it with oil so that it is from those things that help to lubricate the joint with ease. Then push the dislocation with a sharp thrust until it returns.
And after its reduction, it should be placed on it a plaster that has the staphyloma and drying with alum, and it should be tightened by a thightening as it goes down. And hang the arm from the neck of the nurse; and let it go for a few days.
Then let it be unbound. But if the joint is secure in its place, then untie the ligament from it, and let it go.
And if you see that the joint is not well tied, then put on more plaster and the ligament, and let it go for a few days until it is tied. Then let it be unbound.
But if it comes to pass that he has lost his weight after the reduction of the joint, and the position is in motion: then administer humidity in the bath, and subtle friction, and compression, until it is healed, or put iliac on the joint, that is, nates arietis pinguem. Then tie it up, and let it go on top of it for a day and night. Then remove it, and let him enter the bath. But when he sweats, then apply friction to the joint with a moderate friction. Then put on top of it oil a single time, and a second time, and a third time with the entrance into the bath, until it is relaxed.
And if there is a wound, put on top of it cow dung, moist, heated with butter, and tie over it.
Perform this several times. The joint is healed, and returns to its position.
This is the treatment of dislocation by Albucasis.
Mahassem sometimes dislocates, that is, the joint between the arm and the hand.
And the reduction of his dislocation is easy. On the contrary, the joints remain in their places. However, it should be that the speed is in the reduction of his dislocation in the hour in which it dislocates, before it has been measured: or happens in it a hot apoplexy.
And the reduction of dislocation is in it, so that you put Mahassem's hand weak on a table, and extends his servant hand: and the doctor puts his palm on the eminence of the joint, and pushes it, until he has set it back.
Indeed, it should be considered that if the palm has already receded to the abdomen of the hand: then the sick person should put his back of the hand on a table at the extension and reduction: and if the dislocation is proceeding towards the back of the hand, then the position of the hand should be placed intrusively over the table, that is, the interior part of the hand over the table should be placed so that the doctor's hand falls upon it with emphasis on the tendon.
If it then returns immediately, it is good: and if not, then bind it with a plaster while the swelling subsides: and let him go, and do not return to it.
For if he does not bear it, and you cannot bring it to reduction after a few days, then the tendon remains according to its curvature: and it does not hurt the sick person unless his hand becomes soft, and he cannot grasp anything: then you should know that the nerves have been cut or worn away.
Therefore, there is no skill in it except to bind it with a wound close to its danger. And perhaps it does not give anything.
But when Albucasis does not return, then put on him a plaster which we have described. Then let it be bound and let it be left for five days: then let it be loosed and let it be exercised.
But if its movement is restricted, and something heavy happens to it: then soften it with warm water and occasional friction, until it becomes soft.
On the treatment of dislocation of the fingers.
When one of the fingers is dislocated completely, or one of them towards the back of the palm, or towards its heel: then extend that finger, and push the dislocation with your thumb until it returns.
Then support the head of the finger and hang it towards the side to which it is dislocated, and let him go for two days.
Then hang him up and extend him, until he is even with his back on that day.
When then the night having come, bind him according to his story: and do not cease to loosen him on that day: and exercise him with movement: and bind him in the night.
Make it for those days, until he is bound.
And also do the same with him, if his hand goes out of place: and bind him to that side, and do your first work with him, until he is healed.
And also do the same with him when his dislocated to other parts.
On the treatment of dislocations of the spine.
When it happens to anyone that the spine is dislocated, or when many of the joints are separated from their places: then there is no cure for it, because death approaches the sick.
And the sign of it is that he who is sickly leaves his bed without choice, and cannot hold it: and often weakens some member of him, or two legs of his, or two arms of his, or one of them; or when one of his spine joints is separated from its place.
For it often happens that they are separated again, since they are separated on the four sides.
So then who is dislocated backward is called a hunchback.
The cure for it however is that you consider then if the hunchback happens from infancy: then there is no cure for it, nor is there at all healing from it.
But in that which happens by fall, or by punch, or similar to those, the ancients have already said long words of ways of cure. Whose most does not return with profit.
I however have shortened that out of it, whose little excuse from a great distance from my nearness to intention: and my exposure which I exposed that, and I shaped an instrument from him in different ways from him so as to show that, and they showed him.
I therefore say that in the deformity which occurs from the anterior part, there is no art and no cure from it.
And likewise in that which happens on both sides as well.
And let it not be cured from them unless that which happens in the back of its own, with what I am telling you: and it is as if a sick person extended on his face on an equal platform near the wall: and spread out under him a wet cloth, so that it does not hurt his chest.
Then let a straight wooden beam be fixed in the ground, at the end of the foot, around the head of it: and another wooden beam around his feet at the other end of the foot: and let the servant hold fast to the beam, and not be firmly planted in the ground. And let another servant hold fast the other one.
Then let the nurse turn round on top of his head and under his chin with a soft band, firm: and spread out the end of the ligament to the wood which is at his head: and bind himself there.
Then let another ligament be tied above his shoulders and above his knees and near his ankles. Then let all the ligaments be gathered together and bound to the other beam which is at his feet.
Then let all the servants extend to the side of the beam and not remove the two beams from their places where they are fixed: however, they should not be firmly planted, as I said.
Then let the doctor place his palms on the spine with strength until he recoups: or let him place it on the board. Then let him join his feet to the board until he recoups.
If however he does not recover by this cure, then take a board whose length is about three arm-lengths. And make a hole in the wall from which I spoke, which is near the sick person, a place to which the end of the board enters. Then let half of the board be placed on the spine. Let the physician set his feet upon the other end. And tie it well, until the backboard is fitted, and return to your own place.
Then if you wish, operate with the turner that is held in your hand: and it is so, to put two pieces of wood on the ground near the head of the bed, whose length are the length of one arm; and near the head of those two pieces of wood.
And the length that is between all the wood be one palm: and there has already been made a hole, in which the turner runs; and all the wood is made firm on the ground so that it does not move at all.
And a round piece of wood be introduced; and there is a turner in which the ligament turns in two holes of the two pieces of wood.
And at its end there is a hole, in which the wood is fixed, whose length is one palm with that in which it turns; and it is the same in the other two pieces of wood.
Then tighten the ligaments that you have tied inside the chest of the turner that is by its head: and the ligaments that you have tied in his legs in the turner that is at his feet.
Then stand by all the turner, who twists his hand with a lever, with which it turns; and the physician adjusts the backboard, according to what we have said.
This is the form of the turner, which follows.
Then, when the backboard has returned and the place is made equal, then you should put dried blood mixed with albumen on the wounds. Then the stain. Then place above the blood a board from a table, whose width is three fingers wide, or about that. And its length to take up the space of the support, and on the healthy side of the backboard.
Then it is tied with a ligament that we have said. Let the sick one be fed with subtle food until he is healed.
If anything remains of a disease in the place at the end of healing: then it is necessary that which softens and makes mild be administered, with the tablet that we mentioned for a long time. And now it is administered in that tin-plate.
And when there is a disease at the very end of the spine: and it is thought through that dislocation, and it is this jaw that has already begun to emerge. Why should not the presumption be made with this medicine: for perhaps such will happen that it may cause death.
On the cure of an ankle dislocation.
You should know that the ankle joint, and the shoulder joint, do not occur unless there is a dislocation only: and they do not occur to them what happens to the other joints because of a small distance, and urgency.
And the ankle joint dislocates according to four parts. Because it dislocates to the front and to the back.
And many times it dislocates inwardly: and little to the front, and to the back.
And the cure of its dislocation inwardly is: because when you join the thigh of the sick with a healthy one, it is longer: and it is the genuflexion of him prominent than healthy, and cannot the sick double his leg by himself: and there is a place that follows the coxa separated apart, for this reason, that the head of the thigh has already reached there.
And the sign of him who has a dislocation to the outside is, that are opposite accidents to these accidents.
And the sign of him who has a dislocation to the front is, that he expands the healthy thigh according to the complement: however, it does not double itself without pain which is in the knee: and if it tries to walk, it cannot pass over that to the front: and it retains his urine, and is separated from the groin of him, and there is a trodden upon his heel when he walks.
The sign of dislocation to the back is that the knee does not bend before doubling the leg and also because the thigh becomes shorter on the other side; and the kneecap is at the place of the hip joint.
The reduction of this dislocation is that you consider then, if the dislocation is old, which now has healed with the one who had it. Then, if you administer the reduction of it, and it remains according to its position: then it is not at all in this treatment. Therefore, it should not be presumed that he has a complete cure.
But in that one whose dislocation is recent, and is of the four types of dislocations: then approach to this, that you rotate it, and extend it towards the inside and outside, and move it with the right and left hand: perhaps it will return, and does not need another treatment.
But if it does not return in this way, then you have to prepare strong medicine, and extend the thigh from its lower part: or with his hands, or with a ligament that is tied above the thigh over the knee: and another servant extend his hand on the inside of his thigh so that he inserts his fingers under the skin of his thigh. Then tie it with a soft ligament over the root of the hip, and hold the end of one of the ligaments.
And let him sit in an extended position or from the front part of the groin to the thigh, or from the back to the spine.
And let all these extended positions be made in one way, until he stands up with his body from the ground, and remains hanging.
This type of extension is a common type among the four types of dislocations.
If this dislocation returns with what I have said, it is good, and if not, then it is necessary to say about each type that I speak of as its own cure.
In the reduction of this dislocation, when the dislocation is towards the inside, it should be, that the sick person lies on his healthy side. Then put the ligament on top of the root of the thigh, in that which is between the head of the thigh, and the place which is under the groin. Then extend the ligament to the top from the part of the groin to the higher part of the body, to the part of the thigh.
Then another strong minister should take his arm, and make small the place of the weak thigh, and extend it to the external extension in a mighty way. For he has already returned to his place.
And this type is easier than the other types of cure, because this limb is reduced in this way.
But if he does not obey you at all with this type of cure: then it should be, that two nurses bind him together with a strong ligament, soft, over the two heels, and over the two knees: and let the length of each from its own place be the same as four fingers: and let the leg be extended by the other quantity of two fingers.
Then the sick person should be hung on top of the ligament, which is in the house: and let his length from the ground be the same as two arms.
Then command a strong man to support the head of the thigh: and another should hang with the sick person: and another should push with strength, because the joint returns to its place with velocity.
In return, however, when it is dislocation to the outside, it should be, that he lies on his back, according to which we have said, having a gibbosity. And let the ligament be stretched over his thigh, his own, and over his chest.
Then two woods should be put, one at his feet, and another at his head. Then a wood should be put in the middle of the foot, firmly fixed: and let there be placed on it moist cloths, so that it does not hurt the sick person: and let the wood be between his thighs, so that it is not drawn toward the lower side at the extension.
Then all the attendants shall go to their respective places, and the doctor shall give the patient a thorough examination with his own hand.
If he complies with the request for reversion, it will be good.
And if not, place a table above it, and press it equally, as we have said in the case of deformity, However, he should lie on his sound side.
And when the dislocation is to the front, then it should be extended quickly with the help of an attendant: and this is according to what we have said about the stand: and the doctor shall place his right hand on the hip of the patient. Then he shall be pulled by the left hand, and with that pulling he shall be made to extend to the lower side of the leg.
And if the dislocation is to the back: then it should not be extended to the lower side, and he should sit on the ground; but it should be placed on a hard surface, as we have said, and this is also what we said about his lying on two backs: and this is on his face, and the extending ligaments: according to what we have just mentioned.
And it is necessary that compression with the table be applied also to the place from which the suture has been taken, when the reduction has been completed in accordance with what is required.
And the sign of his return should not be hidden from you: and this is when you extend the two legs of the attendants: and when you see them equal, and the patient tightens his leg, and opens it without excuse: then you shall know that his limb has returned, according to what is required; then join the two hips, and put a splint, and bind with bandages, that is, with rope: so that it does not move from one part to another: and let him remain quiet for three days, or four.
Then solve the ligaments, and the splint, and bring the legs together: and when you see them equal in position, then you shall know that the dislocation has been固固的。
If you see anything that softens: then return and cover it with a plaster and tighten it according to your first measure: and also let it go for three days.
Then dissolve that and make the person walk a little on both sides for several days, until he is well.
14. Of the dislocation of the knee-joint.
(3) The knee may be dislocated  (3) in three ways: (i.e.  (1) to the outside, (2) to the inside, and (3) to the bottom, i.e., to the back.
(And it is not dislocated (4) to the front.)
And the sign of its dislocation is (that he applies his knee to his hip). (But if it does not attach with the hip), then you shall know that the knee has been dislocated.
(And the restoration of all kinds of dislocations is this: to make the sick sit upright, so that he may stretch out his leg over it and attach his back to his face; and place his foot between your feet.)
Then fasten the knee of the person with the palms of your hands, and keep them straight between your fingers above his knee. Then apply with both palms of your hands to the sides of his knee with determination. (And another person extends his leg), until he brings back the knee to its place.
(The sign of restoration is) when the leg attaches to the hip with ease, not with effort.
Then cover him with a plaster, and make the leg attach to the hip. Then bind them together at the same time (for three or four days). Then dissolve them.
(And do not let the sick person walk a little for several days), until he is healed.
(But if you do not restore its reduction to you), then administer a strong extension with the ligaments, of which there is a report in the healing of ancient ankylosis, until he is restored.
On the treatment of dislocations of the calcaneum.
When the calcaneum is sometimes moved by a slight movement, and when it is sometimes dislocated from the second complement. And this dislocation of its takes place, either towards the insides, or towards the outsides.
And the sign of this dislocation is that you see the calcaneum swollen, protruding towards the side to which it is dislocated.
The treatment for this removal is simple and consists in returning it with ease with the hands, and in making it stable, until it returns to its place.
In the cure for this however, when it is dislocated from the second complement, you should make the sick person sit upright: and hold it firmly by a strong minister from behind its back, in the middle of its own.
Then hold it with your right hand from the upper part of its foot, and with your left hand from the lower part of the foot in the place of the nail.
Then pull the foot towards you with your right hand. Then, with the two joints of your left hand.
Then extend it with the left, and push the chest of the foot towards the leg without working.
Make it do this twice, as we have described.
Then push the chest of the foot towards the leg in a third pull, and you draw the nail in.
If it then returns in a single pull, or in two pulls according to this method, and you see the foot even, it is good; and if not, then repeat the operation on it: for it will return again.
But if it is forbidden to you to return it with that which we have described: then let the sick person lie on his back on the ground, and fix a firm footstool on the ground so that it may fall between its knees: and you may now draw up on top of it by means of a cloth, so that it does not hurt the sick person.
Then let the minister take the knee of the sick person: then extend the other minister's foot, or with its hands, or with a bandage which he ties above the knee of the foot. Then let all the ministers stand against his extension, and a pacifier be standing between two hips holding him back, so that his body is not drawn to the lower ones at the time of extension.
Then let the doctor make his hands equal and the other ministers hold the healthy leg down. For the dislocation returns with speed.
When therefore the dislocation returns, and it is declared to you that the return of health is made: then put on a plaster and a splint, and bind it firmly with ligaments, and tie the foot with a ligament to the leg.
And you should be careful and not fear about the nerves that are above the heel behind, so that there is no crushing of them by the ligament, and they hurt them.
Then let him go for two days, or three. That if the ligament softens, bind him: then solve him on the third day, or fourth: and prohibit the sick from walking for forty days. But if it attempts to walk before that space, there is no security unless the dislocation is dissolved on him, and it corrupts, and does not receive after it any cure.
That if it happens to him a swelling that is hot: then you should administer to him in seduction that which we have mentioned in another place from the cure of a swelling, and a poultice, until it moves away.
Of the dislocation of the fingers of the foot, and its cure.
It should be so that it is dislocated from them with a little extension without work: and this is not difficult, it is even easy.
But if the dislocation is in certain nods of the back of the foot: then it should be so that the sick person puts his foot on an equal place of the ground, or on a table: and he stands as one who walks.
Then you stand still, and put your foot on that which comes out from them by the joint. Then put that stone with your foot with strength, until it returns, and the hernia itself is already even, and does not seem to be outstanding in place.
Then put under the abdomen of that foot a plate which catches the whole foot, which has two heads. Then tighten it with a string to be worn for three days. Then solve it, and let it rest from walking for many days, until the string is tight and secure from the reduction.
As for the species of dislocation with a fracture or break.
When something like this has happened, and the patient is concerned about his cure and recovery, often death follows: and for that reason you should not presume to control his cure, which is of this kind, unless you are prudent in the art of long use, merciful, considerate, slow, not bold, nor presumptuous: and use medicines which sit on the pulse only, and let go of the sick with divine judgment. Except you hope for salvation from destruction with mildness of disease, and in which there seems to be some hope. Therefore consider the reduction of it at once at the beginning of the thing, before a hot poultice has happened.
If then the limb returns, according to our instructions, then administer a regimen which sits on the poultice: and attend to the wound with that which suits it from an ointment of dried herbs.
That if the dislocation is with a fracture, and have happened in bones separated from each other, then consider the removal of them, and make in it what we said in simple diseases because it has preceded in places of them.
And cause according to your strength, and protect yourself from the entrance into a trap of fear: because my prediction has come to you.
For that is better for you with your Creator, and more lasting to your glory, and more healthy to your body with them in your time.
