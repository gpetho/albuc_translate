Chapter Nineteen.
On Cauterizing Fistulas Occurring in the Mouth.
If a swelling appears at the base of the gums, or in the palate, or at the roots of the molars, then it suppurates and bursts, and the flow of pus becomes a fistula, then you treat it but the treatment does not succeed, then you should heat a cautery iron of a size that fits in the fistula.
Then you insert it hot into the opening of the fistula and hold your hand steady until the heated iron reaches its deepest part and its end. You do this once or twice. Then you treat it after that with what we mentioned of the treatment until it heals, God willing.
If the discharge stops and it heals, then [well and good].  Otherwise, it is necessary to examine the area and remove the diseased bone, according to what will come in its chapter, God willing.
