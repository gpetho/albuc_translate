Chapter Thirty-Three
On the restoration of damaged teeth with gold or silver wire.
When the front teeth are concussed and loose due to a blow or a fall, and the patient cannot bite on food, and you have treated it with astringent medicines, and your treatment has not worked, then to prevent them from falling out, they should be bound with gold wire and not silver, because silver turns green and then decays within a few days, but gold never changes.
And the wire should be of such subtlety and thickness according to the quantity that it can fit between the teeth; and the method of its weaving is that you take the wire and pass it twice between two healthy teeth, and then twist it twice between two loose teeth, or between one or many, until it reaches a healthy tooth on the other side.
And then repeat the weaving back to the side from which you started, and tighten it with ease and wisdom so that it does not become loose.
And your tightening should be such that you secure the wire to the roots of the teeth so that it does not slip.
And then cut off the excess ends of the wire with forceps or scissors, and tuck them in at each place with a tool, and conceal them between the healthy tooth and the loose tooth, so that it does not injure the tongue.
And then leave it thus tightened as it is.
But if it becomes loose or broken, tighten it again or them with another wire in such a manner for all time.
And this is the shape of the teeth and the figure of the weaving of two healthy teeth and two loose ones, as these times are bound:
And when it happens that one or two teeth return to their places due to each oneâ€™s fall, and they grow back as we have described, and they remain.
And no one does this but a good and wise craftsman.
And sometimes a piece of cow bone is fitted and shaped like a tooth, and placed in the spot where a tooth is missing, and it is secured as we have said, and remains and serves for a long time.
