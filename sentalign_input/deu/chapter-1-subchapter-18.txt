Chapter Eighteen:
On the Cauterization of Fissures in the Lips.
Fissures often occur in the lips, especially in children's lips.
When you treat these fissures as described in the divisions and your treatment does not succeed, then heat a small knife-shaped cautery as follows:
The concavity of the cautery should match the fineness of a knife.
Carefully place the heated cautery in the fissures until it reaches the base of the fissures.
Then treat it with plaster until it heals.
