Circumcision is not a separation of continuity like other wounds; however, when we perform this operation of our own volition, and specifically on children, it is necessary that we perform the best work, and the easiest for healing.	Circumcision is nothing but a solution of continuity like other wounds: but as it is a result of our deliberate action, and as it is done particularly to boys, we should plan in this case the very best operation, and the easiest way that leads to safety.	0.820328
I say that the ancients did not speak of the circumcision of their children, because they did not practice it in their law, and we only have what we have acquired through experience.	Now the Ancients made no mention of circumcision in any of their books, since it was not practised in their religion; but it is something we have acquired by experience.	0.6791943
For I have seen the majority of masters and healers who performed circumcision around a knife, and forcefully, and with just a razor; thus the heart fled because there are two layers of skin, and perhaps they cut the upper one and leave the lower one.	I have myself seen the common run of practitioners and barbers carry it out with razor and with scissors; they use a spindle-whorl, a ligature of thread, and incision by means of the finger-nail. I have personally tried all these ways and have not found a better than circumcision with scissors and a thread ligature.	0.57810634
Then it must be cut again, and the pain is doubled, and with the cleaning, which is done with a knife, the tip of the member is not safe; and with the cleaning of the nail, perhaps the iron slips, and ruins the work, and often they are born such that they do not need cleaning, and I have seen it.	I have personally tried all these ways and have not found a better than circumcision with scissors and a thread ligature. For circumcision carried out with the razor is often eluded by the skin; for the skin of the prepuce is of two layers; and often the outer skin is incised and the inner is left intact, so that a second incision is needed, and renewed pain; while when the circumcision is done with a spindle-whorl you are in danger of cutting the tip of the penis, since the tip often goes into the aperture of the whorl. As for circumcision by the finger-nail, the nail will often slip off the skin and your operation be spoilt; or the boy's foreskin may be naturally short, for many are born thus, not needing circumcision. I have seen this myself.	0.68208855
Regarding the cleaning which is done forcefully with the thread, I have found the benefit of experience, because the force cuts evenly as well above as below.	I have seen this myself. Experience has taught me the superiority of circumcision with the scissors and the thread ligature.	0.51208127
For when you press your hand, cut evenly in one single motion; but ensure the thread is tightly wrapped around the skin; and the manner of the first procedure is that you make the child think, if he understands, that you are only tying the thread around the penis, and then make him happy in all the ways you can; then make him stand straight between your hands, and hide the tools between your hands or under your feet so the child does not see them, nor any of the instruments; then put your hand on the penis and blow into the catheter, and draw it upwards until the head of the penis is inside; then clean it well of the accumulated filth, then tie the marked place with a double thread, then tie it below in another place with another tie; and hold it with two fingers by the second tie with the thumb and index finger, and cut between the two ties, then quickly lift the catheter and pull the head of the penis; then let the blood flow little by little, for this is the best; and put powder on it and over the powder a cloth soaked in a mixture of cooked egg white tempered with rose water, combined with good fresh rose oil, and leave it on until the next day, and treat it with other treatments until it is healed. The shape of the forceps for cleansing is this: the two ends should be thin and sharp, and the ends should be as large as the handle, equally.	For scissors cut evenly, since the upper edge of the scissors is exactly the same as the lower edge; and so, as you compress your hand, thanks to the correspondence of the two blades you cut equally and simultaneously; and you make the girdle of the thread like a wall all round the skin of the tip of the penis: thus no error can occur. The manner of operating is first to make the boy, especially if he is one who understands a little, imagine that all you are going to do is tie a ligature on the tip of the penis and leave it for another day. Then amuse him and cheer him as much as you can, according to his intelligence; then stand him upright before you, not sitting; and hide the scissors in your sleeve or under your foot and do not let the boy's eye chance upon that or any other instrument. Then with your hand take hold of the tip of the penis, blow into the foreskin, and draw it back till the glans penis is exposed; then cleanse from it all unclean matter that has collected.	0.90467894
The error in the cleansing occurs when the catheter inside flees from the incision; then you must extend it with your fingernail, before the place forms an abscess; and cut it evenly, and if you cannot hold it with your fingernail, hold it with forceps, and then cut it.	So you should at the start draw it out with your finger-nail before the place swell; then make an even incision. And if you are unable to get a hold with your finger-nail then pick it up with a hook and make your incision.	0.7615178
And if three days pass, and what is under the penis is swollen, leave it until the hot abscess subsides, and peel it lightly; then cut it as gently as you can, and be careful of the part of the penis, so it does not harm it.	If after three days there still remains some inflation and swelling of the part below the tip of the penis, let it be until the effusion subsides, and then gently peel it away and cut it as best you may. Be careful of the tip of the penis; though if any of the tip is cut away that will do no harm.	0.85790694
Then treat the area with wound-healing powders, as we have mentioned in the treatise on powders, and if you cut the catheter excessively, and it goes too far, it will not cause harm; then treat it, as we have said, until it is healed.	And dress the wound with stimulating medicaments from among the powders that we described in the treatise on powders. Should more of the skin be cut away than necessary and the skin is wrinkled up, that will do no great harm either. Continue such treatment as we have mentioned, until healed.	0.80225444
