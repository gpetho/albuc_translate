On the incision of the disease.
Chapter 92.
Veins are twisted, thick, and full of melancholic superfluities that appear in various parts of the body: and mostly, they occur in the legs, especially in those who travel, labor, and carry loads.
Therefore, it is necessary to administer an expulsion of black bile from the body with a strong expulsion at times.
Then perform a phlebotomy on the basilic vein of the patient.
Their treatment with iron is in two ways.
One of these is that they should be cut, and black blood should be extracted.
The other way is to elevate the vein and remove it entirely.
The cutting of it is in this manner.
First, soak the leg with a lot of hot water until the thick, foul blood is dissolved.
Then bind the patient's leg from the upper part of the thigh down to the lower part of the knee with a band.
Then cut the vein in one, two, or three places with a wide incision.
Then lift, that is, extract the blood with your hand from the lower part of the leg upward, and from the upper part perform a phlebotomy on the patient initially.
Then cut down to the nail until an amount of blood comes out that you see as sufficient and within the tolerance of the patient's strength.
Afterward, bind it, and instruct the patient to abstain from foods that generate black bile: and repeat the evacuation and phlebotomy when the veins are filled, and this harms the patient.
Its elevation is in this way.
Shave the patientâ€™s leg if there are many hairs on it.
Then immerse it in a bath, or bathe it with hot water on the leg until it reddens and the veins swell, or have the patient engage in vigorous exercise if a bath is not available until the limb is heated.
Then cut the skin along the vein in a longitudinal section, either at its end near the knee or in its lower part near the heel.
Then open the skin with hooks and strip the vein on all sides until it becomes visible to touch: and upon its appearance, you see it red with a blackish tint.
When it thus goes out from the skin, you see it white as if it were a cord.
Then insert a probe beneath it, so that when it is elevated and exits the skin, suspend it with a gentle, blunt hook.
Then make another incision near that incision, three fingers apart.
Then strip the skin from the upper part of the vein until it becomes visible.
Then elevate it with probes as you did before and suspend it with another hook as you did initially.
Then cut another incision, or several incisions, if needed.
Then elevate and cut it with a final incision near the heel.
Then draw it out to the section that is above it.
And do this until you extract it from the section that is higher, or from all the incisions, until it is fully drawn out: then cut it.
But if it does not respond to extraction and elevation, then insert a needle with a strong doubled thread, tie it, and pull it out, or insert a probe beneath it, and turn your hand to every side until it comes out.
And be careful not to cut it.
For if it is cut, it becomes very difficult to elevate, and it causes harm to the patient.
When you have extracted it entirely, place wool soaked in wine and rose oil, or oil, over the wounds, and treat the patient until healed.
But if the vein is contracted, having twists and bends, and is not as we have said in a straight line, then it is necessary to cut it over each twist and bend.
Then suspend it with hooks until you elevate it entirely, and be careful near your incision on it not to cut or injure the vein, for it will become difficult for you to elevate or extract it.
Therefore, maintain your caution.
The form of the incision by which the vein is healed.
The form of the blunt hook.
It does not have the curve like other hooks, nor a sharp end, so as not to wound the vein; it is thick and smooth, for if it were slender, it would cut the vein by its thinness; indeed, let it have extra thickness, as we have said.
