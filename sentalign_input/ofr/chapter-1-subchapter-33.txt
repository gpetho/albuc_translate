of the lessening/reduction
When diarrhea comes from cold and moisture, so much so that the retentive and digestive power which is in the stomach and intestines is weakened, and cannot be treated by ways of treatments;
and you see the patient suffering greatly and with strong constitution, then make a large cautery on the stomach according to what has been discussed previously regarding cautery of the stomach, with the circular cautery;
and four cauteries around the navel, small, with a small key-shaped cautery, and two cauteries on the hips. 
And if you see abundant moisture and the patient suffering, then make a cautery on the spine, and a cautery on each flank, and two small cauteries on the stomach next to the large one, for the treatment is beneficial when there is good assistance/constitution.
