Chapter 12:
Restoration of fractures of the arm.
The arm consists of two bones called the forearm bones; one is small, located near the thumb, and the other is larger, located near the little finger, on the lower side.
The larger bone often breaks alone or with the smaller bone.
When the small upper bone breaks, the restoration and healing are easier.
When the lower bone breaks, the fracture and healing are more difficult.
The worst case is when both bones break together.
If the small upper bone breaks, it is advisable for the doctor to apply gentle extension until it is aligned.
If the larger bone breaks, a stronger extension is needed.
If both bones break together, apply a much stronger extension.
The hand should be positioned with the thumb higher than the other fingers, resting on a cushion, and the patient sitting on a square seat.
Place a cushion in front at the appropriate height to avoid discomfort.
One assistant extends the lower part of the arm with their hand or a bandage, while another does the same for the upper part.
The doctor aligns the bone to restore it to the best possible position.
If there are bone fragments, you must place each piece in its proper location with your skill.
If a fragment appears separated and pierces the skin without hope of restoration, treat it as previously described.
If the fracture involves a wound, refer to the specific chapter on this and follow its treatment.
If an abscess occurs at the beginning of the restoration, apply a cloth with cerate made of rose oil and white wax, moderately thick, and tighten it gently until the abscess subsides; then remove the cerate, apply a plaster made of powdered herbs and egg white, and use the widest and strongest splint over the fracture.
Know that the number of splints for the arm is six in major cases, whether one or both bones are fractured.
Then apply the bandage most tightly over the fracture, loosening it slightly above and below as mentioned earlier.
The cloths wrapped around the fracture should be soft and damp, not hard or rough, and the string used for tightening should be moderately thick, as described.
Check the limb and bandage regularly for a few days.
If an issue requiring correction arises, such as itching, soak the limb in warm water until it subsides.
Leave the limb untightened until it rests, then reapply the bandage.
If the bandage has loosened and the bone is misaligned, correct it with your skill.
Check if the tightness restricts nutrition to the limb; if so, loosen it slightly for a few days to allow nutrition flow, then retighten.
If none of these issues occur, do not loosen the bandage for about twenty days.
Suspend the patient's hand to encourage movement and have them sleep on their back.
Know that this fracture heals in thirty to thirty-two days, or even twenty-eight days, depending on the individual's constitution and vitality.
