of the pustules of the penis
Often these pustules come on the penis, and it is an appearance of ugly flesh; and there are malignant and non-malignant ones; so you must take them with a fine hook, and cut and clean them all, then apply cotton moistened in Egyptian ointment; then treat it with diafinicon ointment until it is healed.
And if the pustule is malignant, of a foul color and suppurating, then you must apply cautery to it.
When you have cut it, and if the pustule is at the tip of the penis, and part of it is inside the skin and part outside, you must first remove the pustule that is inside; and when it is joined, then treat the outside.
For when you treat it all together, the head of the penis is not safe from being pierced, and blackness and corruption come into the penis and into the testicle; so you must shave off everything that is black and corrupted, then apply a plaster of honey and flour made with pomegranate peel and vetches, then treat it with other treatments until it is healed.
And if bleeding occurs, then apply the lunar cautery in this way:
The cautery helps with both conditions: namely, bleeding and corruption; and if the head of the penis is corrupted and retracted, you must insert a lead tube into the urethra, and the patient should urinate through it; and when the skin is tight at the head of the penis, which happens to those who have not been circumcised, or where it occurs because of a wound or an abscess, then you must peel it back with a blunt instrument, until the ligament is released, and the head of the penis is freed on all sides; and if it is difficult to separate this, you must peel it back with a spatula a little from the head of the penis and the skin; then gently separate the two, and place a thin linen cloth soaked in cold water between them, so that it does not become tight again.
