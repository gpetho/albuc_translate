Having completed for you, my children, this book, which is the last of the medical sciences with its completion, and having reached its end in its expositions and declarations, it seemed to me that I should complete it for you with this treatise, which is a part of the operation, that is, surgery by hand.
Since surgery by hand is languishing in our region and in our time, quite private, perhaps its knowledge has perished, and its trace has been severed; and nothing has remained of it except small descriptions in the books of the ancients, which changing hands have altered; and error and hesitation have befallen them, until its intentions have been closed and its power has been estranged: It seemed to me that I should revive it with the ordering of this treatise, in it, according to the way of exposition, declaration, and abbreviation; and that I should come with the forms of cautery instruments and the other instruments of the work: with the addition of declaration and the expedition of that which is necessary.
However, the reason why a good craftsman of it with his hand is not found in this time of ours is this: because the art of medicine is long, and its author needs to be exercised beforehand in the knowledge of anatomy, as Galen recounted, until he knows the helpings of the limbs, and their forms, and their conjunction, and separation, and has knowledge of the bones, and nerves, and muscles, and their number, and their emergence, and of the pulsating and still veins, and their places of exit.
And because of that Hippocrates said that name with name is much, and with work is little, and especially in the art of the hand.
We however have already spoken of that at the beginning of this book.
Because whoever is not knowledgeable in what we have said about anatomy is not prevented from falling into error, by which people are killed; just as I have seen many of those who are formed in this science, and boast of it without knowledge and without experience.
That is, because I saw a foolish physician cut an abscess of the throat on a woman's neck, and cut some arteries in her neck; therefore the woman's blood flowed, until she fell dead in his hands.
And I saw another physician, who presumed to extract a stone from a man who had advanced in age, and the stone was large.
Therefore, he reached it and extracted it with a piece of bladder.
Therefore the man died on the third day.
And I myself had already been called to extract it: and I saw from the size of the stone and the disposition of the sick man that he would die.
And I saw another physician, who was receiving payment from a certain Duke of our land for medicine: and it happened to a black eunuch, who was with him, a fracture in his leg near the heel: and the physician hurried with his ignorance, and bound the fracture over the wound with cushions and splints with strong constriction, and did not allow the wound an exit.
Then he discharged him according to his desires.
Afterwards he dismissed him for some days, and commanded him not to loosen the bandage: and he stood like that until his leg and foot became ulcerated, and he reached ruin.
I was therefore called to him, and I hurried to loosen the bandage, and there followed tranquility, and he escaped from his pains.
However, the corruption had already become firm in the limb, and I could not restrain it.
Therefore, the corruption ceased to wander in the limb until it perished.
And I saw another physician, who perforated the cancerous ulcer: and it ulcerated after days, until its malice was magnified with its owner.
That is because when cancer is pure from melancholic humour, then it should not be reached with iron at all, unless it is in a limb that can tolerate the complete excision of it.
And for that, my sons, it is necessary for you to know that surgery with the hand is divided into two divisions: namely, surgery to which health is associated, and surgery with which there is danger in many dispositions. And I have already roused in every place of this book, where surgery comes, in which there is terror and fear.
Therefore it is necessary for you to beware of that, and to diminish it, so that fools may not find a way to speak ill of it.
Therefore, receive the measure with care and protection, and your patients with ease and firmness, and use the better way leading through the grace of God to salvation and praiseworthy succession: and leave the terrible diseases of difficult healing; and remove your souls from that which makes you afraid, so that hesitation may enter upon your faith and your advantage. For it is more remaining for your glory, and more sublime in this world, and finally to your rewards.
For Galen has already said in some of his admonitions. Do not treat a bad illness, lest you be called bad physicians.

Part I.
Concerning the benefit and harm of the cautery, and to which temperaments it is suitable, and at what time, and if with iron or gold.
Chapter 1.
But before I recount the operations using it, it is necessary to state the nature of its benefits and harms, and in which temperament it should be applied.
I say therefore, that the discourse on the nature of the cautery's benefit and harm is a lengthy and subtle discourse, requiring knowledge and a hidden secret.
Many wise men have spoken on it, and disagreed; but for me, a little from their words suffices, fearing to prolong the discussion.
I say therefore, that the cautery benefits universally every temperament, whether with or without material, except for the two temperaments which are hot without material, and dry without material.
However, in a hot and dry temperament with matter, they disagreed.
For some said that the cautery is beneficial in it.
And others said the opposite, namely that the cautery is not suitable for an illness arising from heat and dryness, because the nature of fire is heat; and it is unsuitable for being healed from a hot and dry illness with heat and dryness.
And he who says the opposite stated that through the cautery benefit is achieved in every hot and dry illness that occurs in human bodies, because when you compare the human body and its humors to the temperament of fire, you find the human body to be cold.
And indeed I say, through his discourse, that experience has revealed this to me several times.
However, it should not be applied to it unless he is already proven and skilled in the final exercise of the cautery chapter, and knows the diversity of human temperaments and the disposition of illnesses within themselves, and their causes and their occurrences, and the duration of their time.
However, there is no fear concerning the remaining temperaments, and especially in illnesses that are cold and moist. For all physicians have now agreed upon them, and they have not disagreed in the benefit of cautery in them.
And know, children, that from the secret of treatment by cautery with fire, and its goodness upon cautery with burning medicine, is that fire is simple, whose action does not reach, unless to the limb that is cauterized; and does not harm another limb joined with it, except for small harm.
However, the action of burning medicine reaches that which is elongated from the limbs; and perhaps causes illness of difficult healing, and perhaps kills, in the limb.
But fire, because of its subtlety and the goodness of its substance, does not do that, unless it overflows.
Now, however, that has become known to us through experiment, because of the length of service and study with the art, and the standing upon the truth of things; and because of that, I am excused from the length of speech.
And know, children, that they disagree on the time in which the cautery should be performed, and they set a better time in the spring.
And I say that cautery is appropriate at any time, because the harm that happens because of the time is submerged in the benefit that is drawn with the cautery.
And especially if the cautery is for pains from necessary, strong, urgent pains, which do not tolerate delay, because it is feared from them that a greater harm may occur than the small harm entering because of the time.
And do not let it fall into your minds, O children, that the common people and foolish physicians fear that the illness cured by cautery does not always return, and they posit that as a consequence, and the matter is not as they think: for cautery is nothing but a place for medicine, which alters the complexion and dries the humours which are the cause why pains occur.
However, cautery excels medicine in the speed of its cure, and the power of its operation, and the vehemence of its dominion: and it is possible that the illness may return at some time, according to the patient's complexion, and the location of their illness, and its power, and what is prepared in their body from the aggregation of superfluities in it, and what arrives in them by their acquisition from foods, and things similar to these causes, unless it is an illness in which cautery is administered. A subtle illness in a limb, of few superfluities and humours, like the cautery of a tooth, because of pain, and things similar to it, for it is possible that that pain will not return in it.
But that happens in few.
But indeed the common people's saying, that cautery is the last resort in medicine, is a correct saying: not according to what they intend by it; because they believe that there is no cure that can compare to medicine, nor to anything else after the cautery has passed.
However, the reality is the opposite of that, and the intention that cautery is the last resort in medicine is not, except that when we administer methods of treatment for some illnesses, and those medicines do not help; then we administer cautery in the end, and it does help; then from this it follows that cautery is the last resort in medicine, not according to the intention that the common people and many simple-minded physicians understand.
However, the ancients said that cautery with gold is better than cautery with iron; and they did not say that unless because of the equal weight of gold, and the excellence of its substance; and they said that the area of the cautery does not form pus. But that is not absolutely so; because I have already tested it, and found that it does not do that in some bodies without others.
And cautery with it [gold] is good, and better than with iron, as they said.
However, when you are heating cautery of gold in fire, it is not clear to you when it is heated according to the quantity you desire, due to the redness of the gold; and when it is quickly cooled, and if you add more heat to it, it melts in the fire, and turns into sheets.
Therefore, the craftsman falls into that occupation [or: predicament] due to that; and because of this, cautery with iron is quicker and closer to us, for the correctness of the procedure.
And I have indeed already arranged this chapter on cautery, according to chapters, and have arranged them from head to foot, so that they alleviate the one who seeks what they want from it. Concerning the method of cauterizing the head at the coronal suture.
Chapter II.
This cauterization contributes to the dominion of moisture and coldness over the brain; these two are the causes of headache, and of a multitude of flows of humors from the head to the eyes and ears, and of much sleep, and toothache, and throat pain; and universally every illness that arises from cold, such as paralysis, and headache, epilepsy, and apoplexy, and similar illnesses.
The method of cauterization is, that you instruct the sick person to be evacuated first with a purging medicine, cleansing the head for three or four nights, according to the strength of the sick person, and their age, and their custom.
Then instruct him to shave his head with a razor.
Then make him sit between your hands square, so that he has already placed his hands on his chest.
Then place the root of your palm on the root of his nose between his eyes. Wherever therefore your middle finger arrives, mark that place with the cautery. Then apply the olive-shaped cautery to the fire: whose shape is this. Then place it upon the place marked with the cautery, with a descent, whereby your hand is gradually tightened, and you will turn it.
Then lift your hand quickly, and look at the place.
If you see now exposed from the bone a quantity of alkiel, or a quantity of zeuherbi, then raise your hand.
And if not, repeat your hand with the iron itself, or with another from it if it cools: until the bones are seen, which I told you.
Then take some salt, and dissolve it in water, and soak the cotum in it, and place it upon the place: and leave it for three days.
Then place the soaked cotum upon butter, and leave it upon the place, until the eschar of fire is destroyed. Then treat it with tetrapharmacon ointment, until it is healed.
They have now said that the more a wound remains open, the more it emits pus: wherefore it is better and more helpful.
And some of them said that the skin should be cauterized down to the bone: and the cautery should be held, until something of the thickness of bone is burned.
Then that which is burned from the bone should be shaved off, then treated.
And others say that it is necessary to reach the ultimate with the cautery, until it presses an impression on the bone, so that the bone falls, which is done as if shaping a kirate; or an instrument that women place on an infused small alphabet: and they think that vapors of the head are exhaled from this place, and that the wound be left open for a long time.
Then it should be treated until it is healed.
However, these two types of cautery do not seem to me to be suitable except in some people, according to the path of caution.
And to leave it, in my opinion, is better with the safety of him.
For the head is weakened by the disruption of its natural continuity, as we have witnessed in other limbs; and especially when the head of the sick person is naturally weak.  And indeed, the first type of cautery is more safe and better in my opinion, and I use it; therefore operate with it for safety.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the head in pain of the whole head.
Chapter III.
When chronic pain occurs in the whole head, and it is prolonged in the sick person, and he uses leeches, and cupping, and head purges, and oils, and poultices.
And especially if it has already been cauterized with the single cautery that we have described, and none of those things helps him, then consider.
For if the head of the sick person is of strong natural constitution, and not weak, and finds a violent cold, then cauterize with another cautery slightly beneath the previous one.
Then cauterize it above every horn of his head with a cautery, so that the skin is not pierced, and a quantity of bone is uncovered, as we have described.
And cauterize it with a single cautery on the back of his head, in the place called the *vas*, which is the place where the cupping glass is placed; and elevate your cautery there, and do not uncover the bone.
For the sick person experiences a violent pain because of it, different from the pain of the other cauterizations of all parts of the head.
And I shall say this: The cautery in its place should be the cautery with which the horns of the head are cauterized, and the back of his head should be cauterized with a finer cautery than that used for the middle of the head.
And this is its form.
Concerning the method of cauterization in a half-headache, both with cauterizing medicine and with iron.
Chapter IV.
When pain and throbbing occur in a part of the head, or the pain extends to the eye, and the head is purged with purifying medicines, and the remaining treatment, which I have described in the divisions of illnesses, is administered, and yet it does not benefit the entire condition: then cauterization is performed in it according to two methods: either by cauterization with a sharp burning medicine, or with iron. The cautery with sharp burning medicine is to take one garlic clove, and peel it, and cut off its ends from both sides.
Then, with a broad lancet, open the painful area for a time, until a space is made beneath the skin, into which the clove is placed.
Then insert it into the space beneath the skin, until it is hidden; then bind it above with a suitable constriction bandage, and leave it for fifteen hours; then remove it, and take out the garlic, and leave the wound for two or three days; then apply to it a poultice soaked in butter, until the place produces pus; then treat it with ointment until it heals.
And if you wish, do it with certain burning medicines, which I have written about in the twelfth treatise, on Burning Medicines.
However, its cauterization with iron is according to this method.
A cautery of fire, whose form is this.
And it is called a "clauilis," because the shape of its head is like that of a nail, in which there is something curved, and in its middle there is a small eminence.
Then place it upon the area, and hold your hand; and you revolve the iron slowly with speed; and let the amount that is burned be, from the thickness of the skin, like its half.
And raise your hand, so that the artery, which is below, is not burned, and a flow of blood occurs.
Then soak the cloth in salt water, and place it over the area, and leave it for three days; then place the cloth with butter; afterwards, treat with ointment until it is healed. And if you wish, cauterize this hemicrania with the second cautery's knife-edge.
And beware of cutting the artery in this hemicrania, not properly an ancient one.
Concerning the method of cauterizing an ancient hemicrania.
Chapter V.
When treating hemicrania, with what we have said from the preceding treatment, and what we have said in the divisions of illnesses, and the treatment does not help: and you see from the illness that what we have said of the first cautery with medicine, or with cautery with fire, is not sufficient for it, then it is necessary to heat the cautery knife until it whitens after having marked the place of pain with a line, whose length is half a finger, or something like that; and place your hand on one side, and squeeze it until you cut the artery, and reach the bone. However, it is necessary for you to beware of the continuation of the jaw, which moves during chewing, lest the side or the nerve which moves it be burned, whence spasm might result.
And be on guard, and cautious about the flow of blood from the artery which has been cut.
For in its cutting is the danger, especially for him who does not know what he is doing, and is not studious, nor experienced: and he abandons the operation with it first of all.
And I will come with a reminder of the regimen of blood flow arising from the artery according to its manner, and in its place in this book.
If you see from the illness that this cautery is not sufficient for him, and you see the body of the sick person tolerating the cautery in the middle of the head, as we have narrated, treat the wound until it is healed.
And if you wish, administer the cautery, which we have said in the chapter on the extraction of the artery with the cautery having two knives.
For cauterization is better than this and more beneficial. Concerning the method of cauterization in earache.
Chapter VI. When earache occurs from cold, and is treated with remedies, and the other treatment which we have said in the division, and the pain is not removed, then apply a cautery to it: and that is what is called the Point, whose shape is this.
Then, after its ignition, touch the points along the entire circumference of the ear, as it revolves; or, along the circumference of each, if the pain is in both at the same time.
And draw back the cautery a little from the root of the ear, after you have marked the places with the marking-ink; and let the amount of the cautery be ten points on each ear, and approximately that.
Then treat the places until they are healed.
Concerning the method of cauterization in torture.
Chapter VII.
Torture that is treated with cauterization is only of the kinds that arise from phlegm, according to what we said in the divisions of illnesses. And avoid cauterization of the type that arises from desiccation and nerve spasm.
When you treat this type of torture with leeches, and head purgings, and gargles, and your treatment is unsuccessful, then you must cauterize the afflicted with three cauteries: one near the base of the ear, and a second a little lower on its temporal part, and a third at the junction of the two lips.
And place your cautery on the opposite side of the afflicted part.
Because softening does not occur unless in the part that appears healthy.
And the form of cauterization is that you cauterize it with a cautery directly at the tip of the upper ear, under the horn of the head a little: and another on the temporal part; whose length should be according to the length of the thumb.
And hold your hand with the cautery until a quantity equal to half the thickness of the skin is burned.
And this is the form of the cautery, and it is a kind of knife, whose form is already described: however, it is not much thinner than that, as you see: and it is necessary that the knife has a little excess thickness in it. Then treat the places, with what preceded, until they are healed.
Concerning the method of cauterization in old apoplexy.
Chapter VIII.
When apoplexy is longstanding, and you have treated it with what we said, and your treatment does not help, and the patient does not have a fever, then cauterize him with four cauteries on each horn of his head, and with a cautery in the middle of the head, as we said, and with a cautery on the back of the head, according to what preceded: and the method of cauterization should be as before.
Also, cauterization is performed with a cautery on the mouth of the stomach; and this is the more ultimate one.
Then let him be treated with what preceded.
Concerning the method of cauterization in forgetfulness.
Chapter IX.
It is necessary that large hyerae and pills that cleanse the brain be given first to the sick person in drink.
Then shave the entire head of the sick person, and place on his/her occiput a plaster of mustard, as described in the treatise on plasters; and apply it several times. For this is the method of cautery; and do it according to the same order that I have said there. If therefore he is healed by it, it is good.
If not, then make three cauteries on the back part of his head, which shall descend from the upper part of the head down to the lower part of the eye; and place the thickness of a finger between each cautery.
Then treat the cautery, with what preceded it.
If however you wish an addition, and the sick person is tolerating it, then make a cautery in the middle.
If you wish an addition, then cauterize him above the two horns.
Then treat him until he is healed; and let the cautery be olive-shaped according to the form that was stated previously.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in paralysis and softening.
Chapter X.
It is necessary that you proceed in the cleansing of the head with hyeres, and with what we have said.
Then shave the head of the sick person; afterwards cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head, and with a cautery on each horn of the head, and with a cautery on its back, and with three on the vertebrae of the neck.
If, however, in the illness there is a need for the softening of the body with more of those, and the sick person is tolerant, and the illness is strong: then cauterize him with four cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, and the last with a cautery, until most of it is burned from the skin, and raise your hand.
Then care for him until he is healed; and thus the cautery of Oliuare.
Concerning the method of cauterization in Epilepsy.
Chapter XI.
An epileptic is not cauterized, unless that one whose epilepsy is from phlegm. Therefore, it is necessary that you first cleanse his brain with leeches, and with the rest of the treatment that we have described in the division: when the sick person is strong, or is tolerant in the taking of medicines.
However, if it is a child, who does not tolerate medicines, then a gargle and cleansing mastications for the brain are administered, many days before, with the improvement of foods.
Then shave his head, afterwards cauterize him with one cautery in the middle of the head, according to what preceded in the manner: and with another cautery in his occiput, and on every horn of his head with a cautery.
If, however, the sick person is strong and tolerant, then cauterize him with the cauteries that I have mentioned for the paralytic, and for the softening of the body on the vertebrae of the neck and vertebrae of the back: and let the olive cautery be in accordance with the manner that preceded. If, however, the sick person is a child, then apply a subtle cautery, according to this manner.
On the method of cauterization in Melancholy.
Chapter XII.
When the causes of melancholy are corrupted humors and thick phlegm, then cauterize him with the cauteries that we have mentioned for the paralytic.
And if the cause of melancholy is a superfluity flowing towards melancholy, and the sick person's body is moist, then give him a drink that will cleanse his brain, according to what has preceded in the division; then shave the head of the sick person, and afterwards make a neatly crafted bandage of linen, like a circle.
Then place it in the middle of the head, and the patient, sitting upright, must be held on all sides.
Then apply the liniment. And it is better made from old sheep's butter.
And heat it over a fire with a moderate amount of heat, which the finger can tolerate when inserted into it.
Then apply it to the middle of his head in a circle, and leave it until it cools.
Do this to the sick person once a week, with the rest of his good regimen, until he is healed.
Or if you wish, cauterize it by making many small punctures in it, apart from which you should hold the cautery: indeed, it should be smelling.
For this type of cautery moistens the brain with quality.
Then place over it a cloth soaked in butter, or hen's fat.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in descending water to the eye.
Chapter XIII.
When the beginning of water in the eye is declared to you by the signs which I have said in the division, then begin and treat the afflicted one, with that which will cleanse his head.
And keep him from all humidities, and make him sit in a bath, in fasting for some days.
Then order him to shave his head, and cauterize him in the middle of his head. Then cauterize him above the two temples with two cauteries, if it is the beginning of the descent of water in both eyes simultaneously; or from one side, if it is the beginning of water in one eye; and cut with the cautery all the veins and arteries that are under the skin; and let the cauteries be as long as the width of the temples; and beware of the flow of blood.
If you see anything from him, then cut it off immediately with whatever medicine is possible; and I will come with the skill that is in extracting arteries, and cutting them, and caution from the flow of blood.
And sometimes it is cauterized on the neck, under the two bones, with two cauteries finally applied.
On the method of cauterizing in ancient lachrymal cases.
Chapter XIV.
When the tears of the eyes are chronic, persistent, and located above the veins and arteries that are on the visible exterior of the head, it is ascertained that it arises from cold, phlegmatic superfluities; then cauterize with the same cautery as I described at the beginning for descending water, using one cautery in the middle of the head, and two cauteries on each temple, and two cauteries on the neck beneath the two bones.
And if it needs further treatment, then cauterize it on every side of the eye carefully, above the edge of the eyebrow with a small cautery.
On the method of cauterizing in nasal foul odor.
Chapter XV.
When you treat it, according to what we said in the division, and the treatment is not effective, then act quickly and give the sick person decoctions in a drink for three nights. Afterwards, shave his head and cauterize it with a medium cautery and an olive cautery.
Then cauterize it with a claw-shaped cautery, using two cauteries, above the two eyebrows under the hair a little.
And guard against the artery, lest you strike it.
And this is the form of the claw-shaped cautery.
Concerning the method of cauterization in the softening of the eyelid.
Chapter XVI.
When the eyelid of the eye is softened by disease or moisture, then cauterize the eyelid with one cautery, using this crescent-shaped cautery.
And if you wish, cauterize it above the two eyebrows with a few cauteries on every side: and let them be distant from the two temples: and let the length of each cautery be according to the length of the eyebrow: and do not place your hand with the cautery at the very end, but according to the amount that is to be burned of the third eyelid.
And this is the shape of the cautery according to this crescent-shaped cautery method.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the eyelid when the hairs are inverted, pricking the eye. Chapter XVII.
The cautery is in it according to two methods: either a cautery with fire, or a cautery with a burning medicine.
In the cautery with fire, beforehand, instruct the sick person to remove their own hairs, if they are among those who remove them, until they are elongated and made even. If, however, they prick him at their origin: then bind his eyes with a bandage, so that they do not move, until they are born.
When therefore they are born and made even, then place the head of the sick person in your bosom; then mark on the eyelid of his eyes with ink, a sign that is according to the shape of a myrtle leaf; and let the beginning of the sign be near the hairs.
Then place a cotton ball soaked in egg white, or in psyllium mucilage, on the eye.
Then apply the cautery, whose shape is this.
Then cauterize over the shape that you marked, gradually in many stages, until the surface of the skin, which is like the shape of a myrtle leaf, is completely burned away.
And the sign of the success of your work is that if you see the eyelid already contracting, and the hairs rising near the puncture of the eye.
Therefore raise your hand then, and leave it for three days.
Then place upon it a poultice with butter, until the scab is removed.
Then treat it with ointment until it heals.
If any hairs return after an hour, and the eyelid softens, then again cauterize that spot, as you did at first.
If however the hairs are in the lower part, then cauterize it until it is raised to its natural place and is even so that the hairs do not prick the eye.
Concerning the method of cauterizing with a burning medicine in the same case.
Chapter XVIII.
You should instruct the sick person to let the hairs fall out until they are elongated and even.
Make a shape of a myrtle leaf from paper on cloth.
Then take from known soap, and from unsoaked lime, each one ounce in weight, or approximately that; then grind them together thoroughly, and do it quickly so that it does not cool down.
Then take some of that from the paste and place it over the paper you made, in the shape of a myrtle leaf, and place it over the eyelid of one eye, or two.
And place under the eye a poultice soaked in egg white: and let the head of the sick person be in your bosom.
And place your index finger on the medicine, and press it for a short time.
And you should move it whenever the sick person feels the medicine's bite: for its bite is found like fire.
As long as he finds that bite, then leave the medicine and move it with your finger.
When the bite subsides, then remove the medicine and wash the eye with water.
And then consider, if you see the eyelid raised, as it is raised upon contraction with fire or with incision, it is well; and if not, then again put medicine upon the place where the medicine does not take hold and does not darken, until your operation is equal and the eye contracts.
Then apply a poultice with butter until the skin of the burn is removed.
Then treat it with diaphanous ointment, or another, until it is healed.
And it is necessary for you in the operation, that you guard the final guard, lest something of the medicine fall into the eye.
If the eyelid softens after days, and something of the hair fights in the eye, then again put medicine on the place which softens from the eyelid properly, as you did at first.
Then treat it until it is healed.
And this is the form of the myrtle leaf.
And know that the eyes of men are diversified in size and smallness.
Therefore according to that let your consideration be: and the way of rectitude is not hidden from him who is diligent in this art.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in a tear duct fistula.
Chapter XIX.
When you treat a fistula, if what we have said in the divisions of illnesses does not help your treatment, then you should cauterize it according to this method.
Tell the sick person to place their head in your lap, and let the attendant hold their head in their hands in such a way that it does not move or shake with their head.
Then place a heated Cotum, soaked in the white of an egg or in psyllium mucilage, over their eye.  Then apply the cautery, whose shape is this.
Let it be concave, like the shape of a vulture's wing feather from one end, with which the cautery is made; and if you wish it to penetrate to the other end, and if you wish it to be held upwards in this way.
However, this concave shape is better for your work.
Then place the cautery, made very hot, upon it.
And hold your hand with the cautery near the eye, towards the nose, so that your hand does not wander or the sick person is not disturbed; and you shall place the cautery on the fat of the eye, and corrupt it.
If therefore you arrive at the beginning of your cautery up to the opening, it will be good.
And if not, then repeat the cautery once or twice, if you need it, and leave it for three days.
Then apply a poultice with butter, and treat it with a drying ointment until it is healed. If forty days have passed and it is not healed, then apply to it a sharp corrosive medicine until the opening is exposed, and scrape it according to what comes in its chapter.
And there is another method of cauterizing fistulas, which some of the first ones said.
Aim at the location of the fistula, and split it open; then place in the fissure a fine camahan, that is, a fine cannula, whose form is this.
And pour into it a drachma of melted lead, and hold your hand with a good retention cannula, and let the sick person not move at all, so that the melted lead does not run or reach his eye.
And it is necessary that you place over the sick person's eye a cloth soaked in egg white, or in water.
For lead burns the location of the fistula, and heals it with a marvelous cure.
If the fistula is cured with what we have said concerning the cautery and treatment, it is good.
And if not, then it is necessary to administer a nasal opening, and to reduce the fistula to the course of the nose, according to where it will be in its proper place.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in lip fissures.
Chapter XX.
Often fissures occur in the lip, which are called hairs, and especially in the lips of children.
Therefore, when you treat these fissures, with what we have said concerning the division of illnesses, and if treatment does not help, then use a small, knife-like cautery with fire, according to this form.
And its concavity should be according to the sharpness of the knife.
Then treat it with a cautery, until it is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing an oral fistula.
Chapter XXI.
When an abscess occurs at the root of the gum, or in the palate, or at the roots of the teeth; then it forms pus, and bursts; afterward it becomes chronic, and pus runs, and a fistula forms; then you treat it, and the treatment is of no avail, then it is necessary to cauterize the fistula with a cautery, according to its size.
Then introduce the heated iron into the opening of the fistula, and hold your hand until the hot iron reaches its depth and its furthest point; do it once, or twice.
Then treat it afterward, with what we said about treatment until it is cured.
If therefore the pus is cut off and it heals, it will be good.
And if not, then it is necessary to expose the place, and remove the corrupted bone according to what will come to its head.
Concerning the method of cauterization in softened gums and teeth.
Chapter XXII.
When the gum softens because of moisture, and the teeth move, and you treat it with medicines, and it does not help, then place the head of the sick person in your bosom.
Then with fire, a cautery, whose form will come after this, so that you place the Cannula on the tooth: and quickly introduce the heated Cautery into it: and hold your hand for a little while, until the sick person feels the heat of the fire already having reached the root of the tooth.
And lift your hand; then repeat the cautery several times, according to your will.
Then let the sick person fill their mouth with salt water, and hold it for one hour: and let them spit it out.
For the moving tooth is strengthened, and the softened gum is tightened, and the corrupt moisture is dried.
Chapter XXIII.
When toothache is due to cold, or there is cold or a worm within, and treatment with medicines is of no avail, then a cautery is applied to it in two ways: either a cautery with butter, or a cautery with fire.
However, its cautery with butter is that you should take cow's butter and boil it in an iron spoon, or in a pan.
Then take a stick, and wrap it around the tip of the probe.
Then immerse it in the boiled butter, and quickly place it on the aching tooth, and hold it until it cools down; then repeat it several times, until the power of fire reaches the root of the tooth.
And if you wish, immerse wool or a stick in cold butter, and place it on the aching tooth; and place burning iron on top of it, until fire reaches the bottom of the tooth's cavity.
Its cauterization with fire is to apply a copper or iron tube. And let there be something of its thickness, so that the sharpness of the fire does not reach the sick person's bone.
Then apply a cautery, whose shape will come: and place it on that tooth: and hold your hand, until the cautery cools.
Do it several times, for the pain will be removed, either on the same day or on another day.
And it is necessary, in the application of that cautery, that the sick person fill his mouth with good butter, and hold it for an hour: then he should spit it out.
And this is the shape of the cautery.
Cauterize with whichever extremity of force as is possible: and this is the form of the Cannula.
Concerning the manner of cauterization in Strophuls.
Chapter XXIV.
When Strophuls are from phlegm and cold humors, and are not obedient to digestion by medicines, and force their digestion quickly: then with a concave Cautery of fire, whose form is this.
Having two open extremities, so that smoke may exit at the cautery from the other extremity; and place it, ignited, upon the abscess once, and a second time, if that is not enough, until it reaches the depth of the abscess.
If the abscess is small, then place the cautery according to the size of the abscess.
Then leave it for three days, and place upon it a poultice infused in butter, until that which the fire burned is removed.
Then treat it with tooth ointment until the form of the cannula is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterization in hoarseness of voice and constriction of breathing.
Chapter XXV.
When humidities overcome the lung's passage, and especially when it is with a cold temperament, then it is necessary that the infirm be evacuated in the first place with loosening medicines.
Then cauterize it at the sore spot near the root of the throat in the depressed place: and be careful not to reach the throat with the cautery, nor the skin, unless something of it.
Then cauterize it with another cautery at the junction of the neck at the last vertebra of it, bringing it to a final end: and let the cautery be narrow according to the manner which preceded.
Then treat it with what preceded until it is healed.
On the method of cauterization in diseases of the Lung and Cough.
Chapter XXVI.
When cough and lung disease are from cold humors, and the sick person does not have fever, nor consumption, and the disease is old, then cauterize him with two cauteries above the fork, in low, smooth, empty places.
And with another cautery in the middle of the chest between the two breasts: and let the cautery be of a cannula according to the form that preceded.
And if your cauterization wishes to be by puncturing with a cautery, called a Point, whose form preceded in the puncturing of ear pain: and let the points be from thirty points up to almost another.
Then treat him with that which preceded, until he is healed. And now let the cautery have three branches: according to this form.
Therefore, the cauterization is alleviated when you do with it in one turn three cauteries.
Concerning the method of cauterization in the Titillico, in the dislocation of the Humerus.
Chapter XXVII.
When the head of the humerus is dislocated due to moisture, and does not settle into its position of return from its dislocation until it is accustomed to returning, then, subsequently dislocated by a slight movement, as we have already witnessed, it is necessary to first reduce the dislocation.
Then the patient is laid supine on his back, or on his healthy side.
Then lift the skin that is within the Titillico towards the top with your left hand: and if the joint is dislocated inwards.
Then take a cautery with two prongs. Whose form is this.
Then cauterize the skin until it penetrates it to the other side, and the figure of the cauterization will come with four cauteries.
And sometimes a cauterization is made with a cautery having three prongs, therefore the figure of the cauterization then is of six cauteries: and the prongs are according to the fineness of the thread.
And this is the form of the cautery having three prongs.
And sometimes one is added above this way, therefore there are eight cauteries.
Then place crushed leeks with salt upon the cautery.
Then cause the infirm person to adhere to tranquility, so that the limb is not moved at any time until it is strengthened.
And if the dislocation is upwards, and that rarely happens, then cauterize it above the shoulder with a clavicular cautery, or with many cauteries by pricking.
For the joint is strengthened, and moisture is removed: and the sick person is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the stomach.
Chapter XXVIII.
When cold and much moisture occur in the stomach, until they draw it out of its complexion, and phlegms multiply within it, and incessant methods of treatment are of no avail, then it is necessary that the sick person be laid on their back, and extend their legs and hands.
Then cauterize with three cauteries, one cautery under the breastbone the size of one finger with a [small?] cautery, and two cauteries below on either side of one cautery, until the shape of the cauteries becomes triangular.
And lengthen [the cauteries] between each so that they do not join, when they will form pus. And the depth of the cautery should be the quantity of two-thirds the thickness of the skin.
And let the shape of the cauteries be according to this form without addition; and if you wish to cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this form, then let the cautery with which this is done be one in the shape of a circle according to this form.
And the stomach is cauterized by puncturing it for the one who is terrified by this cautery; and it is as if you mark a point on the stomach according to the quantity that you wish with ink; then cauterize it with the point cautery; then treat it with the treatment which preceded until it is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing a cold liver.
Chapter XXIX.
When pain occurs in the liver from cold and moisture, or from thick wind, until it departs from its natural complexion by the exit of superfluities, and the patient is treated with what we have said, and it does not benefit him: then it is necessary that the patient be placed supine on his neck, and mark three cauteries with ink according to this figure, and this same quantity on the lower liver from the hypochondria, where the man's elbow reaches; and let the space between each cautery be according to the thickness of a finger; and let the cautery be straight according to the length of the body; and do not press your hand with the cautery too much.
And let the quantity of that which is burned be, in thickness of the skin, the quantity of half of it not added; and let the patient be standing on his feet.
If however he is not standing, then let him be lying, having already extended his legs and raised his arms. This is the form of the cautery.
And it is possible for you, indeed, to cauterize these cauteries with a knife cautery, when there is subtlety and prudence in your skill.
And beware lest you proceed to the utmost in cauterization, and the thickness of the entire skin is burned, wherefore the whole body is burned and it reaches the intestines; for the skin there is delicate, so know that.
Concerning the method of cauterizing liver abscesses.
Chapter XXX.
When an exit occurs, and you wish to know whether the abscess is in the flesh of the liver or in its membrane: then if it is in the flesh of the liver, the patient is afflicted with pain, and heaviness without sharpness; and if it is in the membrane of the liver, there is intense sharpness with the pain; and you see already that the treatment has wearied his physicians.
Therefore, the patient should lie on their back.
Then, mark the location of the abscess with ink; then apply a cautery that resembles a ray.
And this is its shape.
And cauterize with it one cautery, until the entire skin is burned, and it reaches the siphac, until all the pus comes out; then treat it with the treatment for exits until it is healed.
And it is not fitting that one use this type of cautery, unless one whose study in the art of medicine is prolonged, and through whose hands these illnesses have come together with experience many times; then only should one dare on such an operation.
But truly, to leave it alone is better, in my opinion.
Concerning the method of cauterization in Pleurisy.
Chapter XXXI.
The ancients said that cautery with aristolochia roots is for cold pleurisy in this manner.
And it is that you should take from dry, long aristolochia roots, one root longer than the others, which is found among them, and let it be as thick as a finger.
Then immerse it in oil and light it in the fire.
Then cauterize with one cautery in the area between the fork-like junction with the neck and with two small cauteries slightly slanted downward on the area under the chin.
And with two cauteries also on that which is between the fifth and sixth ribs, slanted slightly backward; and with another cautery in the middle of the chest, and another above the stomach.
And with three cauteries from behind: one on that which is between the two shoulder blades; and with two cauteries from the two sides of the chest, below the cautery which is between the two shoulder blades.
And you should not press your hand with the cautery, but rather it should be on the skin in plain view, smelling. And some ancients have said that there are men who use a cautery made of iron similar to a rod: and they ignite it, and insert it into that which is between the ribs, until they reach the abscess with it, and pus emerges: as we have said regarding the abscess of the liver.
But in this perforation with the cautery there is fear that either the weak man dies immediately, or a fistula occurs in the place, with no cure.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the Spleen, Chapter XXXII.
When you treat the illness of the spleen, with what we have said concerning the treatment in the division of illnesses, and your treatment does not help, then the cautery is to be applied in three ways, all of which are correct.
One of these is to make three cauteries, or four, drawing them along the length of the spleen according to the pattern of the liver cauteries, whose figure preceded.
And let there be between each cautery a distance of the width of a finger, or a little more or less.
And let the method of the cautery be as we described for the cautery of the liver, equally.
And do not press your hand with the cautery, and let the infirm person lie supine on their back.
And another method of cauterization is this: that you heat a cautery having two prongs, as we described in the chapter on the dislocation of the humerus, and raise the skin, which is in a direct line with the spleen, where the left arm of the sick person reaches.  And let your raising of the skin be according to the width of the body, so that the cauteries fall along the length of the body.
Then insert the two very hot prongs until with them you penetrate the skin on the other side, then withdraw the cautery; thus four cauteries are made. And if you wish to cauterize with another cautery having three prongs.
Then treat the cautery after you have let it emit pus for many days, for it is more beneficial than all the other preceding treatments.
Concerning the method of cauterization in dropsy.
Chapter XXXIII.
The cautery does not fall upon dropsy unless properly applied.
When you treat a dropsical patient with the methods of treatment, which we have mentioned in the division, and the treatment does not benefit, then it is necessary to cauterize him with four cauteries around the navel, and one cautery above the stomach, and another cautery above the liver, and a cautery above the spleen, and two cauteries behind the back between the vertebrae, and one directly on the chest, and another directly on the stomach: and let the depth of the cautery be close to the thickness of the skin.
Then leave the cautery open, so that it may discharge pus for a long time.
And do not remove the sick person from treatment after the cautery with him: for it is necessary that two intentions be gathered in him, and healing will hasten to him with God's help.
The form of the cautery with which the belly is cauterized should be nail-shaped, according to its previously stated form; and that with which the back is cauterized should be olive-shaped, according to its previously stated form.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the feet and legs. Chapter Thirty-four.
When abscesses occur in a hydrops patient, and they are filled with yellow water, it is necessary to cauterize on the back of the foot, in the space between the auricular and annular bones, and lift your hand with the cautery, and do not twist it; then raise your hand, and do not repeat it at all.
For the yellow water will sweat out, and the cautery should be of this shape.
Then make two cauteries on each leg, and let the cautery be made with the knife-like extremity of the cautery; and let the cautery be made along the length of the leg, one below the knee, and the other below that, approximately in the middle of the leg; and make two cauteries above each thigh; and leave the cautery open without treatment for a long time, so that some water will sweat out from it; then treat it with the other things we have mentioned.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in abdominal distension. Chapter XXXV.
When the distension of the belly is from cold and dampness, until it weakens the retentive and digestive powers which are in the stomach and intestines; and it is treated with the methods of treatment, and is not healed; and you see the sick person tolerating a cautery of exuberant power, then cauterize him with a large cautery above his stomach, according to what preceded in the cauterization of the stomach with a circular cautery, and four fine cauteries in the circumference of the navel, with a fine clavi-shaped cautery; and a large cautery above the hypochondrium, or two cauteries.
And if you see the dampness excessive, and the sick person tolerating it, then cauterize him with a cautery above the breastbone, and with a cautery above each flank; and perhaps you will add two small cauteries to the stomach near the large one.
For it is a beneficial treatment, whose aid does not err.
Concerning the method of cauterizing Hemorrhoids.
Chapter XXXVI.
When in the anus are many old hemorrhoids, or one, and they are from thick, cold humors, or corrupted dampness, and are treated with what we have said in the division, and the treatment does not help: then cauterize with three cauteries above the lower spine of the back a little below the navel triangularly, and with a cautery below the navel as if with two fingers.
And if you think that his stomach is chilled, and his food is not digested, and you see his face become ulcerated, then cauterize him on the stomach with a large cautery, as previously described; and cauterize him on his liver, and another on his spleen, with a key-shaped cautery; and leave the cautery open for a time; then treat him until he is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing althelul after their excision.
Chapter XXXVII.
When you excise althelul, then heat a cautery that resembles a ray.
Then insert it, heated, into the excised althelul; and with the last part of your hand, until the cautery reaches the opening of the vein from which blood flows: do it once, or twice. If therefore the althelul are many, then cauterize each one with the cautery according to what we have recounted.
Then treat them with that which benefits them from ointments, until they are healed.
And if you cauterize it with a large cautery upon the alcatin, it is more effective in helping.
Concerning the method of cauterizing a fistula in the anus.
Chapter Thirty-eight.
When the sick person does not obey the incision and work that we have described in its place, and is frightened by it, perhaps he is cured with a cautery.
When therefore a fistula occurs to someone, and becomes old, pus runs from it, and corrupted humours.
Therefore it is more fitting that you should probe it with a fine probe.
Then ascertain its depth with the probe.
Then heat the cautery, which is similar to a ray.
Then introduce the heated cautery into the fistula itself, and note the amount by which it has penetrated. And repeatedly apply the cautery to it, until all those corrupt bodies are burned, once, or twice, or three times, according to your necessary amount.
And guard yourself from burning the nerve, if there is one there, or a large vein; or if the fistula leads to the bladder, or to the intestine, then guard yourself from these places altogether.
And do not do this unless the fistula is in a fleshy place, and you judge that it is not penetrating.
Then treat the place until it is healed.
If however the place is sealed, and the matter is cut away from it, and remains like that for a long time, then know that it is now completely healed.
And if matter is not cut away from it, then know that it is penetrating, or a corrupted bone is deep within it, or something like that from those things: whose discussion will come in its place.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the kidneys.
Chapter Thirty-Nine.
When pain in the kidneys occurs from cold or from thick wind, and the strength of the sufferer is diminished by it, then it is necessary to cauterize it on the almethen over the kidneys, cauterizing over each kidney with a cautery iron, the description of which has preceded.
And perhaps we cauterize it a second time on the almeidatu itself.
Therefore three lines will come.
Therefore the last will be more helpful.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the bladder.
Chapter XL. When weakness and softening of the bladder occur due to cold and dampness, to the point that the patient cannot retain urine, then cauterize it on the lower part of the summit above the bladder, where the hairs of the pubic bone begin.  Cauterize with one cautery from the right side of the summit, and another from the left: and let the length of this cauterization on each side be according to the width of a thumb's breadth. And cauterize with a lower dorsal cautery, or with two cauteries if that is necessary: and let it be as described previously (or according to what preceded) for the cautery's grip.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the uterus. Chapter XLI.
When cold and dampness affect the uterus, hindering conception, corrupting her menses, delaying their expulsion, and causing pain upon their arrival, then it is necessary to cauterize with three cauteries in a circle around the navel, as we described in the cauterization of the bladder, and with a cautery above on the lower back, or with two cauteries: and let the cautery's grip be as before.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the rectum in dislocation.
Chapter XLII.
When mucous humors are discharged into the rectum, and cause its exit from its proper place; and a sign of this is that one leg is extended over the other when they are compared, and the location of the dislocation is found empty there.
Therefore, it is necessary to cauterize the affected area over the rectum itself with a similar circular cautery; after marking the circumference of the rectum with ink, as it revolves; and the rectum itself should fall in the middle of the circle.
And let the cautery be of the form that preceded in the cauterization of the stomach.
If this cautery is not available to you, then cauterize it with three cauteries, with a large olive-shaped cautery; and let the depth of the cauterization be according to the thickness of the entire skin.
Then treat it until it is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterization in Sciatica. Chapter XLIII.
When pain occurs in the hip socket, and its cause is cold and moisture; and the patient is treated with what we have said in the division, and the treatment does not help, and it becomes chronic: then it is necessary to free the patient from the thick humors with foul pills, or with artificial pills, and similar ones.
Then cauterize it.
And the method of cauterization in it is according to two methods: either cauterization with burning medicines, or cauterization with fire.
Cauterization with fire is according to many methods.
One of which is to cauterize above the hip socket itself with three triangular cauteries, according to this form.
And make them a good, or bad depth.
And let the space that is between each cautery be the quantity of the thickness of a finger: and let the cautery be olive-shaped.
Sometimes however a cautery is made in the middle above the hip itself.
Therefore there are four cauteries.
And if you wish to cauterize with a circle, whose form preceded in the cauterization of the dislocation of the hip, one: so that the circle contains the entire hip.
And burn the thickness of the entire skin.
This is the method of cautery in sciatica, when the pain is adhering to the hip itself, and does not extend to the thigh and leg.
However, if it extends to the thigh and leg, then cauterize it with two cauteries upon the thigh, upon the place to which the sick person there points, where the pain is, and with your cautery upon the calf four fingers towards the wild side for a short time: and let the cautery be a knife-cautery. And let the depth of the cautery be according to the depth of the thickness of the skin.
If the sick person indicates that the pain extends up to near the toes of the foot, then cauterize it there where he indicates with a point cautery, three, or four, or more, if it needs them.
And if he indicates the pain to be below the knee towards the leg, then cauterize it there with one knife cautery.
And beware in all your cauterizations, that you do not finally use the cautery in such a way that you burn a nerve or a large artery, and thereby draw upon the sick person an evil harm or contraction.
And indeed I have already seen one and another, of those who have cauterized above the ankle and have been too thorough in the cauterization, and the leg has swollen until the swelling reached the foot, and the entire foot has been perforated and corrupted; then a dissolution of the belly followed, and death after that.
If the pain is in two parts at the same time, cauterize each according to this method.
And certain wise men said in the cauterization of the buttock, this is the method of the cautery.
Make a similar cautery of iron, whose diameter is half a palm: and let it be at its opening according to the thickness of a date stone, or a little less: and within that cautery let there be a third cautery.
And let the space that is between each cautery be the size of a thumb's knot; and let the cauteries be open on both sides; and let their height be like one knot, or two knots; and make a handle for them of iron, fitting well into the cauteries.
And this is its form.
Then let it be heated in fire, until it glows red and throws off sparks; then let it be placed over the buttock of the sick person lying on their healthy side.
Therefore cauterize him with three round cauteries at one time.
Then leave him for three days.
Afterwards, plaster with butter; and leave the wound open for many days.
Then treat him with ointment, until he is healed.
Albucasis says, "By this sort of cautery, my sons, we have used little, because of the fear of its appearance; and because we found few who would wait upon it.
However, it is a good cautery for the one who suffers, and finds its place with him.
A cautery, however, is with burning medicines, so that you make two samia having a pierced armlet, into which descends the hinge of its door, of bronze or iron, the length of a wall: on whose height there are two knots, or like them.
And let the space that is between each be the width of a finger, and let them be open below and above: and let that contain each other, according to this form.
Then place it upon a box of ashes, the sick person lying on his healthy side.
And press your hand upon the box of ashes strongly.
Then pour between the two circles hot water, which has been heated with fire for a short time, and hold it for a quantity of an hour: and let the sick person tolerate its burning and its cauterization, for he finds burning as if it were fire, until the burning subsides.
Then raise your hand with the instrument, and wash away the hot water from the whole ash with fresh water: then leave it for three days.
And place butter upon it until the blackness of the cauterization is removed: and leave it for several days, and pus will run from it.
For it is the final remedy.
Then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
If the pain extends to the hip or leg, make a poultice on it containing water, just as you did for the ash equally.
And this is the method for hot water; and I have already written it in the treatise on the rectification of medicines.
Take alkali and quicklime, each one part; grind both, and put them in a new pot whose lower part has a small hole, according to the quantity that the radius will enter; and place another glass pot beneath the bottom of the pot; and pour over the alkali and lime sweet water, which submerges both by a finger; after you have compressed them with your hand with good compression; and leave the pot until the sharp water descends to the lower part of the glass pot.
Then collect all that water and pour it over other lime; and strain it until it is renewed.
For then it will be very strong and sharp, which is used in many surgical operations and in cauterizing other limbs.
Because it produces the operation of fire itself.
And among the medicines with which the anca is cauterized, are also like tesisie, and honey of anacard, and lime with soap, so that both are mixed together.
And Galen, indeed, narrating, recounted the cure of a certain man from the ancients, with which the pain of the anca and the sciatic vein were cured; and he magnified it to be very great.
And he said that he did not need any other treatment, and that he was healed in one instance, until he recounted that perhaps he entered a bath carried, and emerged from it already healthy. And it is to be taken from green seitaragi; and if green is not found, let dry, fresh material be taken; and let it be rubbed much with some fat, and placed upon the anca, where the pain is, or the leg, or in the thigh; and let it be bound, and let it be left for the amount of three hours, or for the amount that the sick person feels the sedation of the burning.
Then put him into a bath.
When therefore his body becomes moist, put him on a couch.
For the pain recedes, and he is healed.
And know that it is not necessary for anyone to use a cautery with these remedies, unless after the evacuation of the body.
And Dioscorides, indeed, said that the dung of goats, when a sciatic vein is cauterized with it, helps it: and the cautery is done in this way.
Take wool, and soak it in old oil, and place it over the deep place, which is between the big toe and the heel, and is closer to the heel.
Then take dry goat dung, and inflame it in fire, until it becomes charcoal.
Then place it upon the wool, and leave it until it is extinguished.
Then repeat it.
Therefore do not cease to do this, until sensation reaches the middle up to the ankle, and the pain ceases.
And this method of cautery is called the Vaccine cautery.
Concerning the cauterization of back pain.
Chapter XLIV.
Sometimes pain in the back occurs due to many causes, either from an accident, or a blow, or an evacuation of excess fluids, and similar things, from the infusion of cold and damp matter: and indeed the cautery does not apply except in this single instance, which occurs from the infusion of cold matter.
Therefore, after the patient's evacuation with foul pills and similar remedies, three lines should be made on the back, where the pain is, according to the width of the afflicted area itself.  After marking each line with five cauteries, or more depending on the patient's tolerance and the severity of the case, apply the cauterization using a cautery-pointed instrument.
And if you wish, cauterize with three or four cauteries, using a cautery with a medial point, following this form.
Concerning the method of cauterization in the early stages of a hump.
Chapter XLV.
This illness often occurs in young infants.
And the sign of its beginning in children is that there is a constriction in their breathing upon elevation and movement; and you will find at the end of the thoracic spine and its joints that it has already begun to project beyond the other vertebrae.
Therefore, when you see it, and wish to treat it, then cauterize it with a cautery that is circular in this form.
And let the cautery cover the entire part of the vertebra equally; and if you wish to cauterize the circumference of the vertebra with a pointed cautery, make two or three lines; and let the points be close together.
Then treat the place until it is healed with what we have said.
And beware, that you do not apply the cautery to the hump that arises from nerve spasm.
Concerning the method of cauterization in gout and joint pains. Chapter XLVI.
When the pains in the joints are from cold humours which flow to any part of the body, then when such pains occur in the feet, it is the custom of physicians to properly name it gout.
Therefore, when gout of a cold cause is treated with methods of treatment, and the pains are not removed, then the cautery will remove them.
And it is to cauterize it, after evacuation, around the joint of the feet, with many cauteries: and let the cautery be oily.
Whose this is the form.
And if you need to puncture the surface of the foot, then do so with a pointed cautery.
If the pains ascend to the knees, or other joints, and this often happens, then cauterize it above each knee with three or four cauteries, from every side, with this same cautery, the Claviform. If, however, more cauteries are necessary for you, then cauterize it. And do not immerse your hand with the cautery, rather let it be about the thickness of the skin only.
If, however, the pains ascend to the knees and back, then administer what we said about cautery in its chapter.
If the pains are only in the hands, then puncture in the circumference of the joints, like two lines revolving.
If, however, pain remains in the fingers, then puncture them, over every knot a puncture, and over the palm of the hand.
If, however, the pains ascend after days to the elbows, or to the shoulders, then cauterize both from every part.
And do not remove the sick person from good regimen, from the taking of medicines.
For if a good regimen is made, and phlegm is evacuated, it will be healed with the help of God with this cautery.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in Ruptures.
Chapter XLVII.
When a rupture occurs in the groins, and the intestine, or the spermatic cord, descends toward the testicle, and it is in its early stages and close: then it is necessary to order the sick person to abandon his eating on his particular day.
And let him use laxatives, so that the stool descends from his belly.
Then let him sit between your hands upon his back; and order him to hold his breath until it emerges, or the spermatic cord, or the intestine appears.
Then reduce it with your fingers, and mark with ink under the rupture above the pubic bone, with a mark whose extremity is similar to half a circle towards the upper part of the body.
Then cauterize with an iron cautery, of which this is the shape, until it turns white and throws off sparks.
Then reduce the intestine, or spermatic cord, to its hollow.
Then let the attendant place his hand over the area so that the intestine does not come out; and you have now opened between the patient's legs, and placed a cushion beneath him, and another servant on his thighs, and another on his chest who holds his hands.
Then place the cautery on the mark itself, with your hand holding the cautery straight.
And hold it until you reach the mouth with it; or repeat with it another time, if you have not reached the mouth with it in the first instance.
And prudently observe for the exit of the intestine during your cauterization, lest you burn it, and death or great harm befall the patient through it.
And know that when you do not reach the mouth with the cautery, your operation is not effective.
And the cautery for infants should be fine, according to their size.
Then treat with the other ointments until it heals.
And let the patient lie on his back for forty days, until the wound is sealed.
And it is necessary that you place nourishment for the duration of his healing, which will soothe his stomach, so that the intestines do not expel during straining and defecation.
Then, when he wishes to rise after forty days, then administer a properly made bandage, and let him keep it for another forty days.
For when he uses this regimen, he is thus healed with complete healing.
However, when Ruptures occur in the rest of the belly, and are beginning, and force so that they are not added to, then cauterize the Rupture with a round cautery according to its size: and let that which is burned be from then as its third part.
Then treat him with what we have said: and it will not be added to.
And already some first ones have said that a Rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cautery, according to this shape.
After it is marked with ink, and a line is placed which is across in the upper side of the Rupture, and another line to the lower. And place your hand in the middle with the cautery iron.
But the first cautery is easier and better. Concerning the method of cauterization in pains due to a fall or blow.
Chapter XLVIII.
When in certain limbs pain arises from a fall or blow, and that pain persists for a long time, and treatment with medicines is not effective, then it is necessary to cauterize with a pointed cautery iron.
And let the cautery of every limb be according to its size, and its smallness, and its weakness, and its strength, and the location of the twisting, and the pain from it.
If therefore it is healed by the first cautery, it is well.
If not, then repeat the cautery on it.
Because it is customary for these pains to shift from one limb to that which is near it.
Therefore it is necessary to follow them with cautery until the sick person is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in Leprosy.
Chapter XLIX.
Leprosy patients are sometimes greatly helped by cautery.
And especially the species of leprosy that arises from the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy: therefore, when you wish to cauterize it, consider it.
Therefore, if the leprosy is extensive, and you have treated it with what we said in the division, and it neither recedes nor stops; and you fear that the corruption may encompass the entirety of his constitution; then cauterize him on the head with five cauteries: one in the middle of the noted head, and a second below it towards the forehead near the end of the hair, and two above the two horns, and one behind on the nape of the neck.
And hold your hand with the cautery for a short while, until it imprints a small impression on the bone, and the tissues are loosened from it: so that the expiration of gross vapors from it may be relieved; and cauterize also with the cautery upon the spleen itself, according to what has preceded.
However, if the leprosy has already spread over the patient, and is clearly visible, then it is necessary to cauterize with those cauteries that we have mentioned on the head, and with a cautery on the tip of the nose, and with two cauteries on the two jawbones, and with two cauteries on the vertebrae of the neck, and six on the vertebrae of the back, and one large one on the haunches near the end of the tail and one above it, in the very flesh of the buttocks; and two on the armpits: namely, one on each armpit, and two on the knees: one on each knee, and two on the shoulders, and two on the elbows, and two on the soft parts of his chest; and cauterize him on every joint, from the joints of his fingers and his toes; and cauterize on every heel of his feet, and the soles of his hands.
And beware of the nerves that are upon the heel, so that you do not burn them. And sometimes a cautery is applied to the breastbone, and another to the stomach, and another to the liver.
And know that the more you apply the cautery, the more beneficial and helpful it is.
And know that the sick person does not find pain in the cautery as healthy people do, because his body is already numb.
And there should be cauteries of different sizes, according to the limbs and joints, just as was stated previously in the kinds of instruments.
Chapter L.
When any limb is numb, and is treated with medicines, and oils, and plasters, and is not healed, then cauterize that numb limb with cauteries, according to the deserved size of the limb, or its smallness.
And let your cautery enter the thickness of the skin a little.
Then treat it with ointment, until it is healed.
And sometimes a cautery is applied to something of numbness that happens to the hand and foot, in the vertebrae of the back near the exits of the nerves that move that limb; and the numbness is removed.
But let no one presume upon it, unless he is wise in the anatomy of the limbs and the exit of the nerves moving the body.
Concerning the method of cauterization in Albaras.
Chapter LI.
When Albaras is old, and nothing from the skills of medicine helps it, then cauterize over it itself with a deep cautery for a short time, according to the thickness of the skin, until its whiteness is removed and its color changes.
Then treat it with flour of herbs, and lentils with rose oil, and arnogloss leaves, and dove's blood, and swallow's blood: of each one part; mix all these together, and apply them on a cloth, and let them adhere to the place, until it heals.
Concerning the method of cauterization in Cancer.
Chapter LII.
When Cancer is beginning, and you wish to stop it, then cauterize it with a circular cautery around it, as it revolves.
However, the wise have said that it should be cauterized with the final cautery in the middle.
However, it does not seem right to me, because I fear that it will ulcerate; and I have already seen this happen several times. And it is better that it be cauterized around it with a circle, as we have said; or with many cauteries. Concerning the method of cauterization in Adubelati.
Chapter LIII.
When someone has Adubelati, and it is delayed in maturation, either because of excess causing it, or due to the infirm's age, when he is decrepit with little blood, or due to the time, and the force to hasten the maturation of Adubelati, then cauterize around it with many small cauteries by puncturing.
Then leave it.
For it will hasten with maturation.
If however you wish to perforate it with a cautery, then heat the cautery, whose form is this.
And place it in the middle of Adubelati, until it penetrates the skin; and let the cautery be from that which follows the infirm, so that the course of pus may be relieved.
Then treat it until it is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing a corrosive evil. Chapter LIII.
A corrosive is nothing but corruption walking in a member, and it corrodes it; just as fire consumes dry wood.
If therefore you see a corrosive in a place that can tolerate a cautery with fire, then use many cauteries of fire, small and large, according to what is suitable for the place where the corrosive is.
Then cauterize it from every side until you eradicate the entire corruption, and nothing of it remains at all. Then leave it for three days, and put ground sulphur with oil on the cauterized places, until all the eschars and all corruption are eradicated.
Then treat it with ointments that generate flesh.
If therefore you see that after three days healthy flesh is born in a way where there is no corruption, it is good.
And if not, then repeat the cautery on that which remains of the corrupted places.
And it is sometimes cured by corrosive medicine.
For it itself arises in place of the cautery.
However, cautery with fire is of quicker help; and I have already said that its cauterization with corrosive medicine is in division: so take it there when you need it.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in warts, and corns. Chapter LV.
This ailment often occurs in the lower parts of the feet: and it is a thick, filtered substance that hurts the foot. And cautery in them is indeed according to two methods: cautery with fire, and cautery with hot water.
As for cautery with fire, you should make a concave cautery, similar to a hawk's wing, made of iron, in a size that completely contains the wart on all sides, and with thin edges.
Then place it, heated, over the wart. Then revolve the hand with the cautery in a circular motion around the wart, until the cautery reaches the depth of the wart, and leave it for three days, until it begins to emit pus. Then plaster it with crushed wild mallows and salt, and leave the plaster over it overnight. For it will be eradicated from its roots.
Then treat the area with a generative flesh ointment, until it heals.
If they are not converted, and often occur on the surface of the body, especially on the hands and feet, then apply a cautery to them with warm water.  And take a cannula of bronze, or iron, or of a vulture's wing, and place it on the wart, or corn.
Then pour a small amount of hot water into the cannula, hold your hand, and rotate it with the pressure of your hand for a short time, so that the edge of the cannula presses on the root of the wart, and the hot water finds its way to the depth, to the root of the wart; and the sick person should wait for a while on the mordication of the hot water for an hour.
Then leave it, for the wart is eradicated with its roots.
Do this with each of them one by one, until you have treated all those that are on the body.
Then treat them after they are eradicated, with that which produces flesh from ointments.
Concerning the method of cauterization in Tremor.
Chapter LVI.
When tremor occurs in someone due to cold in a nerve, or from a quartan fever, or otherwise: then it is necessary to cauterize it with four cauteries, or five, over the vertebrae of the back, and between each vertebra with a cautery, and on its chest with a cautery, and on its stomach with a cautery.
For tremor subsides with the cautery of olives, and the health of the cold ailment speeds. Concerning the method of cauterizing Albathir.
Chapter LVII.
Sometimes foul Albathir are expelled in the body, that is, pustules, which are made from corrupted gross matter.
Therefore, it is necessary, first, when they appear, that all pustules on every head be cauterized with a fine cautery of myrtlewood, whose tip has been ignited with fire.
Or with the root of long aristolochia.
Or with a lentil-shaped cautery. And sometimes they are cauterized at the beginning of their expulsion in this way: and they are not increased; and the superfluity which makes them is broken, and they are healed from them.
However, it is necessary that this be done after evacuation with bloodletting.
Concerning the method of cauterization in a blood flow from an artery in a wound.
Chapter LVIII. Often a flow of blood occurs from an artery that has been cut in a wound that occurs externally, or at the incision of an abscess, or cauterization of a limb, and things similar to them: and it is difficult to cut it off.
Therefore, when this happens to someone, then quickly apply your index finger to the opening of the artery, and press it firmly, until the blood is contained under your finger and no more comes out from it. Then place small, olive-shaped cauteries, and many large ones, in the fire: and blow over them, until they become very hot.
Then take one of them, either small or large, according to the wound and place where the artery is broken, and place the cautery on the vein itself, after you quickly remove your finger; and hold the cautery until the blood is cut off.
If it is driven out when you lift your finger from the opening of the artery, and extinguish the cautery, then quickly take another cautery from the cauteries that are prepared in the fire. Therefore, do not cease to do this, one after the other, until the blood is cut off.
And beware, lest you burn the nerve which is there, and cause another harm to the sick person. And know that when blood flows from an artery, it is then not possible to cut it off, especially when the artery is large, unless by one of the four methods.
Or with a cautery, as we have said.
Or with extraction, when it is not extracted. For when it is extracted, its extremities contract, and the blood is cut off.
For when it is extracted, its extremities contract, and the blood is cut off. Or it should be tied with a strong ligature.
Or medicines of a nature to cut off the blood should be placed on it, and it should be bound with a fitting constriction of a pillow.
However, he who performs its excision with a ligature and constriction with a cloth, or with the application of burning things and similar methods, does not truly benefit it, except rarely.
If, however, this should happen to someone, and a physician, nor medicine, be present for him, then let him begin with the placement of the index finger on the opening of the vein itself, as we have described, and with its strong constriction, until the blood is blocked from the upper part of the wound, and above the artery.
And the finger should not be removed, above it with very cold water, continually, until the blood is congealed and thickened, and cut off. And meanwhile, let him consider what it needs in terms of cautery or medicine.
End of the First Part.
Albucasis' Surgical Book, Part II. Concerning incision, perforation, and phlebotomy in wounds, and similar matters.
We have already stated in the first chapter that every illness in which cautery with fire and burning medicine is appropriate, and the occasions for it, its causes, its instruments, and the forms of cauteries. And I have placed there chapters from the head to the foot.
And I shall proceed in this chapter along the same path, so that the seeker may have his question relieved. And before I begin that, it is necessary that you, my children, learn that in this chapter is the terror that is in the first chapter on cauterization.
And therefore it is necessary that there be more caution in it, because in the operation which is in this chapter, evacuation with blood frequently occurs, with which life stands at the opening of a vein, or the incision over an abscess, or the opening of an exit, or the treatment of a wound, or the extraction of an arrow, or the incision over a stone, and similar things: from all of which trepidation and fear are associated, and death falls in many of them.
And I warn you, lest that which causes hesitation befall you, for sometimes in this art the ways of men clash with the ways of illnesses.
For among them is he who is angered by his illness, and death is light to him; because of the intensity he finds in his illness and the length of his malice.
And with illness is the fear that signifies death.
And among them is he who gives his lyre, and enriches you with it, hoping for health, and his illness is harmful. Therefore, you should not agree with him who comes to you from among them, whose manner is such.
And let your caution be stronger than your greed and your rapacity.
And do not presume upon anything from it, unless after certain knowledge, which verifies to you that to which praiseworthy succession has arrived.
And use in the treatment of all your sick, prognostication and indication of that to which health may suitably come.
For in that is help for you in acquiring fame and glory, and memory and praise.
May God inspire you, children, with his understanding, and may he not take away from you direction and inspiration; for it is in his hand.
And I, indeed, have arranged this chapter, distinguishing it by chapters, according to what preceded in the chapter on the cautery, from the neck up to the feet: so that your inquiry, which you desire from it, and of which you have need, may be alleviated.
Concerning the treatment of water that collects in the heads of children.
Chapter 1.
Know that this ailment frequently occurs to children at birth, or when the midwife tightens the child's head without ease.
And sometimes it happens also from a hidden cause that is not known.
And indeed I have not seen this illness in others than in children, and death has hastened to all whom I have seen afflicted by it.  Therefore, it seemed good to me to omit treatment in this case.
And indeed I saw one of them, a child whose head was filled with water, and the head grew larger every day until it could no longer sit upon itself, because of the size of its head; and the moisture increased until he died.
And this moisture, indeed, either collects between the skin and the bone, or collects under the bone above the sinus.
And if, in that case, the moisture is between the skin and the bone, and the abscess is small, then it is necessary to make a single fissure in the middle of the head, with a width: and the fissure's length should be about two spans, until the moisture runs out.
And this is the form of a lancet.
If, therefore, the moisture is more increased, and the abscess is larger, then place two fissures, according to this form.
And if the moisture is under the bone, and its sign is that you see the sutures of the head open from every side, and water is pressed out when you press it with your hand inwards, and that is not hidden from you: then it is necessary to make three fissures in the middle of the head, according to this method.
And after the incision, remove all the moisture.
Then apply a poultice of wine and oil to it until the fifth day.
Then loosen the bandage, and treat the wound with sutures and ointments.
And do not allow the head to be bound with equality.
And feed the sick person all dry foods with little moisture, until the limb strengthens and heals.
And another method of incision is to consider where the size of the abscess and the collection of water appear.
Because sometimes there is more in the occiput, or in the forehead, or in the right, or in the left.
Therefore, proceed with the incision where the abscess and collection of water appear to you: and cut it according to what is possible for you.
And observe, lest you cut an artery, and a flow of blood occur, and the sick person die from that flow with the evacuation of moisture.
Concerning the incision of arteries behind the ears.
Chapter II.
When discharges occur to someone in the eyes or chest, and it is prolonged, and treatment with medicines does not help, then the ultimate treatment in that case is the incision of these two arteries.
Therefore, when you wish to incise them, it is necessary that the sick person shave their head.
Then rub the area with a rough cloth so that the arteries appear.
Then the sick person should tighten their neck with any cloth they have.
Then consider where the vein beats.
And the places of both are the places which are depressed behind the ears: and it is rarely hidden, except in some men.
Then mark with ink each of the two [spots]: and cut each with a lancet on both sides, the incision reaching the bone, and let it be made across the width of the head.
And if you wish, insert the lancet under the artery and cut it upward with the incision.
And let the length of the incision be like two fingers joined together.
For when a vein is cut, blood flows out with a pulsating discharge, which leaps inward with a frequent bound.
If however the artery is not visible to the sense, then it is necessary to measure from the ear a space of three fingers' breadth.
Then mark with ink, and cut to the bone.
And that which must be emitted of blood is six ounces, and perhaps you emit from it more or less. All of that according to the amount which appears to you from the weakness of the sick person and the filling of his artery.
Then consider the wound.
Then if anything remains on the bone from the sifac, then cut it, so that a hot abscess does not occur; then bind the wound with linen strips.
Then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
Concerning the extraction of arteries, which are in the temples.
Chapter III.
When a man experiences chronic hemicrania, or acute catarrhs due to acrid humors and heat in the temporal muscles, or severe chronic pain, and similar afflictions: and if treatment with the methods of medicine does not help: then we are experienced in these illnesses with the extraction of arteries from the temples, or their cauterization, as we have described.
And the method of operating on their extraction is that the infirm person should shave the hairs that are on the temples, and direct himself toward the artery appearing in the temple.
For it indeed shows itself to you by its pulse, and is rarely hidden except in a few people, or by intense cold.
If it is hidden from you, then the infirm person should tie their head with any cloth of theirs; then rub the area with a rough cloth.
Or apply steam to the area with warm water, until a clear appearance is evident to you. Then take the spatula which I have just formed. Then scrape the skin with it easily, until you reach the artery.
Then insert a hook into it, and pull it upwards until you have pulled it out of the skin, and cause it to escape from the tunics that are under it on all sides.
If however the artery is delicate: then wrap it with the end of the hook.
Then cut a part of it according to the amount by which its ends will be lengthened and drawn together, and so that a flow of blood does not occur.
For if it is not cut, and if it is not severed, the blood does not ascend completely. Then evacuate six ounces of blood, up to three.
If the artery is large: then it is necessary to tie it in two places with a strong, double thread, of silk or of strong cords, so that putrefaction does not quickly occur before the wound is consolidated, and a flow of blood occurs.
Then cut away the excess that is between the two ligatures.
Do that at that hour, or after another hour. And if you wish, cauterize it with a cautery up to the bone, with a surgical cautery, until its extremities are cut, and it will remain in place of the same work.
And it is a better operation, unless the patient has a fever or a hot temperament.
Because cautery is among those things that help to end humidities.
Therefore, it is a better aid.
And after the extraction of the arteries, the place should be filled with old linen, and pads properly made should be placed upon it.
And after the removal, treat it with dry medicines that cause flesh to grow, and with bandages, until it is healed.
If meanwhile, during the operation, a flow of blood occurs from an artery, then hurry to cut it with a cautery, or to fill the place with zegi; and bind your hand, until the blood is cut off.
If none of those are present for you, then place your finger on the place, until the blood is congealed.
And embrocate the place with water of great coldness, until the sharpness subsides, and it is bound according to what is necessary.
And from that which is lighter and easier to extract than an artery, is, that you cauterize the vein with this cautery having two knives; and let the sharpness of the two knives be similar to an almond.
However, they are of much less sharpness than two knives.
Because if they are sharp, like two knives, cold comes quickly to both: and they do not cut the flesh with speed.
Therefore, since there is some thickness in them, the heat of the fire is retained in them, and the flesh is cut quickly: with this, therefore, the work is better than any other work, and lighter, and easier.
And let the space between the two knives be the thickness of a finger, after you mark two places with ink; and place both very hot until they reach the bone, and cut the vein in two places: so that that which is between its extremities may be extended.
For they do not consolidate completely with this cautery.
And this is the form of cautery.
Concerning the treatment of acute and persistent running of tears from the eyes.
Chapter IV.
When the tears are constant, and their flow is from the veins that are on the outer surface of the head, and no medical treatment with medicines helps them, and you see the patient's face already red, and he feels a crawling sensation on his forehead, like the crawling of ants, and his eyes are weakened, damp, so that their hairs are already corroded with the corrosion, and his eyelids are inflamed from the intensity of the tears; then the ancients used this operation in their treatment, and they named this treatment with the Knife.
And it is necessary to instruct the patient to shave the hair on his forehead.
Then make three equally spaced incisions on the forehead, following the length of the forehead.  The length of each incision should be about two fingers.  One incision should be equidistant with the length of the nose, in the middle of the forehead; the second, slightly off the temples; and the third, on the opposite side.  Be careful not to cut the arteries which are on either side. Keep your hand away from the area where the two jawbones meet. The distance between each incision should be the equivalent of three fingers placed together.  Prepare a piece of sponge, or many dry cloths, to absorb the blood.
Then introduce a spatula with two sharp ends, whose form is as follows.
From the incision that is on the temple side, up to the second incision, and scrape away all the skin that is between the two incisions, with the spatula, which is above the bone. Then do the same from the middle incision to the second incision.
Then withdraw this spatula, and introduce into the first incision another instrument, called a sharp scalpel, with one smooth side, not sharp, on the other side.
And this is its form.
And place its sharp side towards the flesh attached with skin, and its smooth side towards the bone; and push it, until it reaches the middle fissure; and cut with it all the vessels, which descend from the head to the eyes; except that the incision continues to that which appears of the skin.
Then do that in the middle fissure until another fissure.
And after an equal quantity of blood flows out, express the places from the fragments of clotted blood. Then place in every fissure a linen cloth from old cotton, and place over them cushions soaked in wine, or oil, or vinegar.
And see that a hot abscess does not occur.
And on the third day, loosen the bandage, and administer a plentiful infusion with lukewarm water.
Then treat it with basil ointment, and the other remedies with which wounds are treated, until it is healed.
Concerning the treatment of acute tears and catarrhs to the eyes from internal parts of the head.
Chapter V.
When acute, sharp, persistent catarrhs occur in someone; and you see their eyes weakened, small, and their gaze already weakened; and the eyelids ulcerated, and hairs fall from them, and a sharp, painful headache deep within the head, followed by sneezing; then, understand from these occurrences that these materials, and catarrhs, do not arise unless from many veins.
And the better treatment for them is this.
And it is to order the sick person to shave their forehead.
Then make one incision in the middle of the forehead, or a little wider elsewhere, and begin the incision from the left temple to the right temple; and let the incision reach the bone; and draw your hand away from the temporal muscles, which move during chewing, until the bone is exposed; and you will dry up all the blood with a sponge.
Then separate the two edges of the incision with old linen or linen strips.
Then bind above with pledgets; and soak the pledgets with wine and oil, lest a hot abscess occur.
And when you remove it, and see that the hot abscess is already lessening, then you must rub the bone until flesh begins to grow on it.
Then treat it with a drying regimen that causes flesh to grow; such as if you take two parts of wheat flour and four parts of colophony: and prepare a plaster from them, and apply it to the growth of flesh in these wounds.
Concerning the treatment of that which falls into the Ear. Chapter VI. Everything that falls into the ear is one of four kinds: either a mineral stone, or something like a stone, such as iron and glass; or it is from a plant, such as chickpeas and beans; or it is a fluid substance, such as water, vinegar, and similar things; or some animal.
Therefore, when a stone, or a kind of stone from those which are not added nor grow in the ear, falls into the ear, expose the ear to the sun.  If you then see the stone, then instill into the ear something of violet oil, or sesame oil.
Then administer the extraction of it, and make the person sneeze with condiments, and occlude the nostrils at the arrival of the sneeze, after you have placed around the ear fragments of cloth or wool, and extend the ear upwards.
For often it comes out with this treatment.
If however it does not come out, then administer its extraction with forceps, that is, with fine tweezers: the form of which is this.
If therefore it comes out with the forceps, it is good.
And if not, then administer its extraction with a fine, single-pronged hook. If therefore it does not come out through that, then make a tube of bronze, and insert the end of the tube into the ear cavity deeply, and plug what is around the tube with softened wax mixed with oil, so that there is no passage by wind except through the tube: then extract with your wind by a strong suction. For many times it comes out with what we have recounted.
If however it does not come out in this way, then take a small amount of birdlime, or of glue, that is, prepared glue, with which birds are caught, and place it at the end of a stick after you have wrapped a bandage around it properly; then insert it into the ear cavity with ease, after you have dried the ear from moisture.
If therefore it does not come out with all that we have recounted, then hasten to incision, before a hot abscess or spasm occurs.
And the method of incision is, that you should first open a vein in the cephalic (vein), and draw out some blood according to his strength.
Then make the patient sit between your hands, and turn his ear upwards, and make a small incision at the root of the ear, at its fat, in a depressed area of it; and let the incision be crescent-shaped, until you reach the stone; then remove it with whatever instruments are possible for you.
Then stitch the incision as quickly as you can, and treat it until it heals.
If the thing falling into the ear is one of the small grains that grow and swell, then administer its extraction.
If it does not yield to you, then take a thin, slender spatula, of this form.
And use it to remove that kind of grain that falls into the ear, and do not do so when you think that grain has already been moistened by ear vapor, until you have broken it into many small pieces. Then extract them with hooks, or with a fine probe, or with suction, as we have said, for its removal is thus eased.
However, for water that enters the ear, the patient should use sneezing, at first, with a compress; and now he has filled his ear with some old lint; and lies on the ear in which is the water.
If therefore it emerges through it, it is good.
And if not, then take many stones, the length of a finger, thin, smooth, and heat them a little with fire, and let the patient insert one of them into the opening of his ear; and let him hop on one foot on that side, and strike with another stone the stone which is in the ear.
Therefore, let him not cease to do that with stone and stone until all the water emerges.
And now the water emerges in such a way, that you take one from papyrus, or from reeds, and insert one end of it into the ear; and you set fire to the other end with fire, until the greatest part of it is burned.
Then again another reed, and do that many times, until all the water emerges; and extract it with a cannula according to what has been stated about the stone.
In the extraction of an animal entering it, if it is of small body, like a flea, and similar to it, treat it as I said in the division.
But if it is of large body, which appears to the senses, then administer its extraction with forceps and hooks; and its removal is easier than all those held in the ear.
In the extraction of a worm generated in the ear, when you treat it with what we have said in the division, and in the treatise on distillations, and your treatment does not help, then you should look at the ear in the sun.
If therefore anything of the worms appears there, then extract it with forceps, or with fine hooks.
If, however, nothing appears there, then take a cannula, whose form is this, narrow below, wide above; and introduce the slender end into the ear according to the amount that the sick person tolerates; then suck with it with strong suction.
Do that many times, until all the worms come out.
If, however, they do not obey you to exit, then smear the surrounding area of the cannula with wax, as I said in the stone.
If they do not come out with what we have said, then administer the distillations that the ancients have already experienced in the killing of worms; and you will find it in the treatise on distillations.
And let your pouring, with which you pour oil and medicines into the ear with this instrument, whose form is depicted here.
As you see, make it from silver, or bronze, narrowed below, in which there is a small hole, wide above.
Let the impelling thing, which is in the concavity of the cannula, be made of bronze properly.
And if you wish, take a reed, and wrap a cloth around its end with a suitable wrapping; then pour oil, or juice, or whatever medicine you wish from these into the cannula; and let it be in the ear; then introduce the reed with the cloth from above, and squeeze it with your hand with moderate pressure, until the oil is propelled into the concavity of the hearing, and the sick person feels it internally; and that which is poured into the ear, let it be warmed with fire for a short time; and beware that the thing which is distilled into it is not very cold, for the medicines do not tolerate that.
Concerning the treatment of accidental stoppage of the ear.
Chapter 7.
Sometimes infants emerge from their mothers' wombs unperforated.
And it happens also to some people that the ear passage is obstructed by a wound, or by flesh growing in it.
And this obstruction sometimes occurs deep within the ear cavity, and the sight does not reach it; and sometimes it occurs near the outer part of the cavity, and sight reaches it.
Therefore, that which occurs deep within the ear, and which the sight does not encompass, is in many instances difficult to cure.
And in that which is visible, you should place the patient's ear in the sun, and look at it.  Then if you see the obstruction appearing, open it with a thin spatula, whose form is as follows: its tip has a small width, part of which is pointed; and the rest of the spatula has two smooth sides, so as not to injure the ear.
If therefore the obstruction is from flesh grown in the ear canal, then grasp it with a thin hook and cut it away with a forceful ease until all the flesh is removed.
If the obstruction is deep within the ear, then take a thin, smooth rod and warm it slightly with fire; then introduce it into the ear canal.
If therefore you sense an obstruction, as the patient finds with a difficult hearing, attempt to open it with ease, and be careful not to injure the nerves of the ear.
Then place in the ear a pessary according to the size of the opening, wrapped in Egyptian ointment.  Do this for several days until you are certain of the wound's healing.
Or take a pessary, and steep it in rose water, and sprinkle ground zegi powder on it, and use it.
If you see that the ear has already become abscessed, then it is necessary to remove the pessary, and apply another pessary wrapped in a cloth made with rose oil, until the hot abscess subsides.  Then treat it until it heals.
If, however, a blood flow occurs, then immerse a sponge or cloths in cold water, and place it over the ear. And use the remaining treatment, which cuts off the blood flow, as previously described in the treatise on distillations.
Concerning the treatment of the Altheli of the eyelids.
Chapter VIII. These Altheli that occur in the eyelids of the eye are sometimes moist, and sometimes dry.
Therefore, it is necessary to grasp them with tweezers, or with a hook, and cut them with a scalpel from their roots.
Then place ground zegi upon the affected areas.
If however blood flows from them, then cauterize them with a fine lenticular cautery.
And to cauterize them is better after the incision.
For they often return when something remains from their roots.
And when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned, and they do not return.
Concerning the treatment of eyelid granulations.
Chapter IX.
Often something occurs in the eyelids that is similar to granulations in its strength and hardness, and on account of that it is called granulations: and it is a collection of thick moisture in the upper eyelid and the lower eyelid.
Therefore, the operation on them is, that you consider then, if it is granulation proceeding from that which appears on the eyelid, and they move to every part, and its removal is easy.
Therefore, make a fissure over it across its width.
Then scrape it from every side with ease, until it disappears.
Then suspend it with a hook, and cut it off.
If, however, its excision is not prepared for you unless after you pierce the eyelid with an incision for a short while, then that harms the sick person in some way.
If the fissure is large, then bring it together with sutures, and treat it until it heals.
And if it is small, no harm will come to you from it.
For ointment restores it and causes it to flesh over.
And if the granulation is sloping towards the inner surface of the ear, then invert the eyelid and suspend the granulation with a hook; moreover, you need an incision and press it from every side.
If the eyelid is extended by incision, that will not harm it in any way.
Then wash the eye after the incision of the granulation with salt water, and treat the place with that which causes fleshing, until the sick person is healed.
Concerning the treatment of the affliction of the eyelids.
Chapter X.
Axirnath is a fat that is generated in the membranes of the upper eyelid, and it most often happens to children. It weighs down their eyes, and they have catarrhs in the mornings, and cannot look at the sunlight, because tears rush to them, and because of this you see them lying on their faces always, and they sleep on them, and their eyelids are moist under their eyebrows, which are already covered by swelling.  And the prominence of the Axirnath is visible to the eye, and when you press the area with your fingers, you feel the Axirnath between them.
And the method of its treatment is that the sick person should place their head in your lap.
Then take a linen cloth, and prepare on it strips, and make a circle from that strip according to the amount that Axirnath contains on all sides.
Then place it over it, and press with your fingers on all sides, so that the Axirnath is collected in the middle of the circle.
Then find in the middle of that moisture, with a lancet, slits along the width, and do not let the slit be larger than that which is made in phlebotomy in depth.
Or it is necessary that you cut through the entire skin, until you reach the Axirnath, for in many arrangements the Axirnath proceeds from the slit in the form of a white fat piece.
Therefore extract it with the cloth, which you have folded between your fingers to the outside, and you turn your hand to the right and left until it is dispersed; and beware, do not increase the slit, so that you do not reach the eye with the lancet and wound it.
If however the Axirnath does not appear to you at the beginning of the slit, you shall add a little to the slit with ease, until the Axirnath proceeds.
Then extract it, as we said.
Then immerse cloths in vinegar and water, and place them on the area, and bind it with bandages.
And there are men who rub salt, and place it in the concavity of the slit, so that it liquefies what remains of that moisture.
Then treat it until it heals.
If however it happens in a place with a hot abscess, then treat it with soothing plasters, until it heals.
Concerning the ways of Ataxmir of the eye, that is, when the eyelid of the eye softens, whence it comes to be wrinkled as it should not be.
Chapter XI.
When additional hairs grow in the eyelids, beyond the natural hair course, and they become aged: then they harm the eye, and cause various ailments, such as constant tears, and softening of the eyelids, and cloudiness, until it becomes the cause of the eye's destruction.
And Ataxmir of the eye is indeed treated according to four ways. Or by cautery with fire.
Or with a sharp medicine, according to what has been stated in the chapter on cautery.
Or Ataxmir is treated by incision and suture.
Or by tubes, according to what I will say.
It is necessary that you place the head of the sick person in your bosom.
Then turn the eyelid of the eye with your left hand.
If therefore it turns, it is good.
And if not: insert the needle into it, in which is the thread from the lower part of the eyelid, and make the needle with thread penetrate from above, and let it be near the hairs themselves, that is, near the edge of the eyelid where the hairs grow; and pull the thread upward with the eyelid, and turn it with the radius.
Then find in the inner part of the eyelid under the added hairs with a spatula proceeding from the larger tear duct to the smaller tear duct.
Then pull out the thread, and place under the eyelid a small pad of cotton, or cloth; then mark on the eyelid with ink, which should be like the shape of a myrtle leaf.
However, it is necessary that the shape be made according to the size and elevation of the eyelid, because it is already diversified in humans.
For among them is one who needs a large amount to be cut from the eyelid, according to the amount that softens from the eyelid. Then with a spatula, find above the two lines that you marked, and begin from the larger tear duct to the smaller tear duct, and let the fissure be close to the natural hairs, as is the thickness of a ray.
Then insert the hook into one of the two corners of the skin. Then scrape the whole of it. Then bring together the two lips with a suture, with a needle and fine wool thread; and wipe away the blood, and make the excess thread adhere to the two eyebrows, with certain invisible things, if you wish to do so; and if not, do not worry.
Then leave the suture and threads for up to three or four days; afterwards, care for it. And if you wish, leave the wound without a suture, and care for it with that which dries and constricts it.
For the eyelid is raised at the sealing and bringing together of the wound: but it will be better.
This method of treatment the ancients taught Ataxmir.
However, there is care for the sick person in it, and it is from good operation, and there is no fear in it.
And another method is in Ataxmir also: and it is, that you mark on the eyelid a shape, which is like the shape of a myrtle leaf, as we have narrated.
Then raise the eyelid with three separate hooks, or aggregated, according to this form which follows, then cut what is superfluous with small scissors, according to this form, with equality in the incision.
If however it is not possible for you to hold the hook, and it is not equal to it: then take a needle in which there is a thread, and introduce it into the middle of the shape; and introduce another thread near the larger tear duct, and a second thread near the smaller tear duct; and gather the threads between your fingers with equality.
Then raise your hand with equal elevation, and raise the skin upon which the mark is, as we have narrated.
Then bring together the two lips of the wound with a suture, and care for it until it heals.
If, however, an abscess occurs at your incision, or your fissure: soothe that abscess with a cauterizing agent, and similar things, from soothing ointments.
And sometimes it happens to the eyelid, too, that its hairs are turned.
Concerning the treatment of Ataxmir with reeds.
And it is, that you turn the eyelid, and slit the fissure that is within, according to what I have described.
Then skillfully make two reeds, or two thin pieces of wood, whose length is according to the length of the eyelid, and their width less than the width of the spatula; and you have already incised at the extremities of each from both sides where you hold the threads.
Then carefully place each of them over that which is left over from the eyelid, and tightly bind the two reeds from both sides with a strong constriction, and leave it for several days. For the tight skin will die, and turn black, and putrefy, until it falls off by itself.
If therefore it is delayed, then cut it with scissors.
Then care for it until it heals.
When therefore it is consolidated, the eyelid is raised: and the hairs do not prick.
And this is the form of two canes, which you will make according to this figure, and quantity in length and width.
Concerning the raising of pricking hairs in the eye with a needle.
Chapter XII.
The procedure in that is to take a fine needle, and insert into it a fine, smooth silk thread. Then tie its ends, and make a very small knot on each end: and let the length of the threads be one palm.
Then place in the Alinxotati another fine thread beneath it in brief, and tie its ends if you wish.
Then let the sick person place their head in your lap, and be near the sun so that the operation may be revealed; because it is a subtle, or minute, operation.
Then insert the needle with the alinxotati into the root of the eyelid, and make it penetrate the eyelid quickly until you pull it out above the natural hair.
Then pull the hair up above the alinxotati, and insert that hair into the alinxotati: if it is one, or two, or three, not more.
Then pull your hand with it, until the hair emerges with the alinxotati from the eyelid with the natural hair.
However, if the alinxotati is pulled out, and the hair does not emerge with it: pull the alinxotati downwards, with the thread which you have placed in it, until the alinxotati emerges from the upper opening, and you see it with the vision of the eye: then you will pull the alinxotati and the thread; and remove both, and close the eye; and leave it closed for two days, or three, until the hair adheres to its place, and flesh grows over it.
If the hair is short, then either associate a long hair from the natural hairs with it, and raise it with it; or leave it, until it lengthens after a period, and then raise it.
Concerning the treatment of Alxatrati which occurs in the upper eyelid.
Chapter XIII.
When this Alxatrati happens to the eye, it is called Leporina.
And this Alxatrati is either natural or accidental.
Therefore, the accidental kind results from the healing of a wound, or incision, or cautery, and things similar to them.
And the method of treatment in it is that you find that consolidation, and that you separate its lips, and place in that which is between them a linen pad, and bind it, until it is healed.
And you should not use in its treatment things that dry and constrict; for if you do that, the Alxatrati returns worse than it was: rather, use in it things that soften, such as fenugreek; and embrocate with water in which cooked althea, flaxseed; and with the unguent dyaquilon, which has been liquefied with some oil; and wrap with it a linen pad, and treat it with that.
And the treasure of your treatment is to strive with all your ingenuity that it not consolidate according to the form that it initially had.
And this operation, which we have mentioned, is nothing but a certain rectification of the Alxatrati, so that the form of the place does not return to what it was completely. Concerning the treatment of Alxatrati which occurs in the lower eyelid, and is a wrinkling or contraction upward to the right and left.
Chapter XIV.
This Alxatrati which occurs in the lower part, is the one truly called Alxatrati.
And it is natural, and it is accidental.
And the accidental form results from a wound, or a fissure, or a cautery, and similar things.
And the method of operation in it is that you should take a needle, in which there is a double thread, and dip it into the flesh, and cause it to penetrate from the left tear duct to the right tear duct, until the thread reaches the two ends of the flesh.
Then extend the flesh upwards with the needle, and cut it with a broad spatula.
If therefore the shape of the eyelid returns as it should, it is good.
And if not, take a radius, and place it in the fissure, and turn the eyelid with it: and make two fissures in the inner side of the eyelid, and let the ends of the two fissures be from the two angles of the incision, until they meet and form an angle from them: until when they come together they make their shape this shape, and it is the Greek letter lambda.
Then remove that flesh by the amount that is its sharp lower side, from that which follows the eyelid.
Then bring together the separated parts: sew it with a wool thread.
Then treat them with what we said, of softening medicines, and bandages, until they are healed.
And if an injury occurs from a fissure, or suture, or cautery: then it is necessary that you make a flat fissure under the hairs of the eyelids, also according to what preceded.
Then separate between the two lips with a bandage, according to what we said.
And the summary of the treatment of Alxatrati, when it is on the top or below, is that the operation should proceed according to the form of the Alxatrati.
For it is indeed of many varieties in form: and the skilled craftsman prepares his skill in whatever way is possible for him, until he restores the figure to its natural form, or near to it, and the injured person himself, according to what suits him from the operation and instruments in many arrangements.
Concerning the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or cornea.
Chapter XV.
Sometimes this consolidation happens to many people, so that the upper eyelid becomes consolidated with the white of the eye and prevents it from its natural operations.
Therefore, you should insert the tip of the probe under the eyelid and lift it upwards; or extend it with a hook; then cut the adhesion with a thin spatula, which should not be sharp, but rather slightly blunt, so that the patient is not disturbed during the operation, and the spatula is removed, and does not injure the eye with its sharpness. And your incision should be such that you gently scrape away the adhesion until the eyelid returns to its natural form, and the entire adhesion is healed.
Then pour salt water into the eye, washing it with the water; or distill into it from a sieve made of dissolved zinc with water.
Then separate the eyelid from the eye with linen thread; and place over the eye wool soaked in egg white; and after three days use the sieve, and with consolidants, until it is healed.
Concerning the incision of the toenail and the prominence of the tear-producing flesh.
Chapter XVI.
Know that the toenail is according to two methods. Or it is nervous: and it is similar to hard, fine sifac.
Or it is not nervous, similar to frozen white moisture: which when it touches iron, or you try to grasp it with a hook, is severed, and the hook does not become fixed in it.
And both types do not begin, unless from the greater tear duct, until it goes gradually, until it covers the sight, and hinders the light, and the movement of the eye.
And the method of operating on it is: that the sick person should place his head in your lap.
Then open his eyes, and elevate the eyelid with your hand.
Then collect the nail with a hook of few doublings, and extend it upward.
Then take a needle, and insert into it a hair from the hairs of a horse, or ox, or cow: and let the thread be strong, and double the end of the needle a little, and fix it in the middle of the nail: and pierce it with the needle, and tie the nail with the thread, and extend it upward: and scrape with the hair the side of the nail which follows the pupil, as if you were sawing it with the hair until its end.
Then cut the remainder at the root of the tear duct with a thin spatula, or with small scissors: and leave the natural tear duct tissue, so that an incessant flow of tears does not result from the incision.
And sometimes the nail is extended with a hook alone, or with a thread, as we said.
Then it is scraped with a gentle spatula, of which this is the shape.
And be careful, lest the spatula touch the horny coat, and a rupture occur in it, and the pupil be pierced.
Then, after the incision, put some crushed salt into the eye, or a substance made from ziniar, and leave it until the next day.
Then treat it with what is necessary until it is healed. If the nail is not nervous, and you cannot insert a needle into it, nor is a hook fixed in it, then this type of nail is often treated with medicaments, and is healed as I have described in the division.
If you wish to cut it, then open the sick person's eye, and take a thin, gentle, weakly-sharpened spatula, according to this form.
And scrape the nail from above with care.
If you see that it is becoming thin and breaking, and the scraping is affecting it, then distil from your hour into the eye a sieve made of ziniar, or a red sieve, or crushed salt; and bandage the eye until the next day.
Then repeat the operation until the whole of it is removed.
Unless there is a hot abscess in the eye; for then leave it, and treat the abscess until it is healed. Then repeat the operation on it with scraping, until it is healed.
However, if the fleshy prominence of the tear duct is harmful to the eye with great injury, it should be suspended with a hook, and a portion of it should be cut; and do not make the incision too deep, so that the flow of tears does not occur.
Then instill into the tear duct a red, or one made from ziniari, until it is healed. Concerning the incision of Alguardenic, and the flesh grown in the eye.
Chapter XVII.
Sometimes in some people's eyes, red flesh grows, either composed or superimposed, until it covers the pupil, or approaches it, or presses against the eyelids, and perhaps turns the eyelids outwards; and it resembles a rose-hip.
And the treatment for it is also that the sick person should place their head in your lap.
Then open his eyes, and collect all that flesh with suitable hooks: and hold it with one forceps, or tongs.
Then cut into the flesh at first, until the whole of it is finished with a scalpel.
And be careful of the eye, so that you do not injure it during the operation: and let your incision, with which you cut it, be either with a spatula, which we have described in the incision of the hoof; or with small scissors, with which the asebel is collected, according to how its shape will appear after this chapter.
When, therefore, your incision is complete, and the whole of the alguardenici is removed, then fill the eye with crushed salt: or distill into it red powder, and similar corrosive medicines: and place over the eye externally a cloth with the white of an egg: so that it is safeguarded from a hot abscess.
If any alguardenici remains, and hot blood dominates you, and you fear a hot abscess: then leave the eye, and treat it with that which calms the abscess.
Then repeat the operation on it, until it is healed.
And similarly do with the added flesh which happens in the eye of this kind.
However, it is necessary that you avoid the treatment of every weak eye by natural or accidental means, by operating with iron: and do not put your hand into any of these operations until you see that the limb is tolerant of that operation.
Concerning the collection of Sebel from the eye.
Chapter XVIII. Sebel are red veins that weave over the eye, and hinder the operation of its vision: and weaken the eye with the length of days.
Therefore, you must first consider if the eye in which the Sebel is present is strong, and there is no other ailment in it beyond the Sebel: then collect the Sebel from it.
And it is that you should instruct the sick person to place their head in your bosom.
Then suspend those veins with one hook, or two according to your prudence: and let the hook be a thin double hook, according to this form, or let there be two hooks graduated in one body, according to this form.
Then collect those veins with fine scissors carefully, and wipe away the blood hour by hour, until you see those veins removed from the eye, and are dissolved: and beware that you do not injure the eye with the tips of the scissors.
And let your operation be in the midday sun, and be very firm in your operation: so that you do not injure anything but those veins.
And when you have finished, then instill into the eye green or red juice, that by its sharpness it may corrode what remains of the scab.
If however it is not possible for you to collect it all in that hour, then plaster the eye with that which soothes the pain of the eye, and leave it for a few days, until its pain subsides; and ensure it is free from a hot abscess; then again treat it in the same way, until it is healed.
And this is the form of the scissors.
Concerning the reduction of a nose injury.
Chapter XIX.
Physicians call a nose injury a fistula, which you treat with a cautery, or with a sharply burning medicine, according to what its previous description has indicated.
And if it does not heal, then there is no skill in it, unless you open up the abscess at its origin and remove all the moisture and pus in it until the bone is exposed.
When the bone is exposed, and you see corruption or blackness on it, then scrape it with an instrument, whose shape is this.
And it is called a "rough head".
Make it from tempered iron, and let its head be round like a small pestle, pointed with a file, or with a fine-pointed awl, and place it on the diseased part of the bone. Then revolve it between your fingers, and press your hand a little, until you know that the corruption has been scraped away; and do this several times.
Then revolve it between your fingers, and press your hand a little, until you know that the corruption has been scraped away; and do this several times. Then restore the place with drying, astringent medicines.
Therefore, if the place is consolidated, and flesh grows on it, and the course of pus is cut off; and it remains for forty days, and is not renewed, and does not become a boil, and no accident occurs in it; then know that it is now healed.
And if not, then it has no cure, except to reduce the fistula to the nostril opening, according to this form.
And it is, that you uncover the second bone with iron, or with a sharp medicine; and when the bone is uncovered, then take a drill according to this form, let its iron tip be triangular, and its wood be a tapering pyramid down to the tip, as you see.
Then place it on the bone itself, and let it be near the tear duct, and move your hand away from the eye a little.
Then rotate your hand with the drill, until it penetrates the bone, and the patient feels it: by this that he finds wind exiting from it, when he holds his hand over his nose.
Therefore then restore the place with astringent drying medicines, as I taught you.
When therefore flesh is born, and the place hardens, then the matter that was being discharged outwardly returns to the nose; thus it is easier for the patient.
Concerning the reduction of the prominent eye. Chapter XX.
When the eye protrudes in its entirety, and no harm or diminution occurs in vision, then it is necessary to free the patient; then bleed him; afterward apply cupping glasses to the neck without scarification, but with suction.
Then place on the eye a liniment made from acacia, aloe, frankincense, and sarcocolla.
Then bind the eye from above with many small pads over a plaster.
And the manner of the small pads is: that you take soft cloths, many, and each cloth should be folded over four times; make many of them; then place them one over another, according to the quantity required by the eye; then bind them with a firm bandage over them.
And again apply cupping glasses with suction without scarification.
Then remove the cupping glasses, and leave the eye bound day and night.
However, if the bandage softens again, then it is necessary that it be bound tightly; then remove the bandage after one day and night, as we have said.
If therefore you see the eye has now returned to the condition of its tunic, it is good; and if not, then apply the plaster again, and pads, and bandage, and cupping glasses, until it is healed.
Concerning the incision of the uvea tunic.
Chapter XXI.
When rupture occurs in the uvea tunic, then it protrudes and emerges outside the eyelids like a uvea grain, and disfigures the human form because of it, and the desire is to incise it: then the operation in it is as I narrate: and it is, that you insert a needle into the root of the uvea from the inferior to the superior part.
Then insert another needle carrying a double thread from the lacrimal side, and make it penetrate; and leave the first needle according to its position.
Then cut the place of the double thread, and tie with it the part of the uvea in a circle around the needle; and tighten it much.
Then extract the needle, and place upon the eye wool steeped in the white of an egg; and leave it, until the thread falls with the uvea.
Then treat the eye with that which strengthens it, until the wound is healed.
And sometimes the uvea is tightened from every side with a circle of cloth, until the eye adds great prominence.
Then it is pierced with a fine spatula, which reaches the depth of the eye, and the white fluid runs out, and the eye descends, and enters immediately; then tighten it until it is healed.
Concerning the treatment of Alcomnat.
Chapter XXII.
This illness, called Alcomnati, is nothing but pus that collects in the eye, similar to descending water, and it is not the eye itself.
And the method of operation in it is that you make the infirm person sit on a prepared seat, or upright.
Then take its head in your hands from two sides, and move it until you see the pus descend to your eyes below.
Then let it be fixed, and do not let it descend, and let the light be freed: and let the sick person see things as they saw: and if it does not descend lower, know that it is water.
If, however, the descent of the pus is not prepared with what we have said, then make the sick person sit between your hands. Then take a fine spatula, and split with it above the corneal membrane slightly at the junction of the conjunctiva with the cornea, in the fold, until pus emerges.
When it emerges, then instill warm water in which you have mixed honey into the eye: or water in which you have already boiled fenugreek and honey: then treat with the rest of the treatment, until it is healed.
Concerning the treatment of water that descends into the eye, or cataract.
Chapter XXIII.
We have already discussed the types of water in the division, and what is suitable for piercing, the speaker declaring and explaining.  Then take that same thing according to health.
Then it is necessary to make the sick person sit between your hands, square, facing away from the light, near the sun; and bind his healthy eye tightly; then with your right hand, if the eye in which there is water is the left eye, or with your left hand, if it is the right eye, press the eyelid of his eye.
Then take with your right hand an almagda, if the eye is the left eye, or with your left hand, if the eye is the right eye.
Then place the end of the almagda near the crown, along the thickness of a ray, on the apparent white of the eye near the smaller tear duct; then propel the almagda with force, and you revolve your hand with it, until it penetrates the white of the eye; and you feel that the almagda has now reached the empty thing.
And it is necessary that the measure of the almagda's journey to the depth be the measure of the space from the pupil to the end of the blackness; and it is the crown of the eye.
For you will see them in the very pupil of the eye's vision, because of the clarity of the cornea.
Then place the almagda to the place where the water is.
Then press it downwards one after another.
If therefore the water descends immediately, then the sick person sees that above which he opens his vision immediately, and the almagda in his eye.
Then rest a little.
If therefore the water descends, then put it down a second time, apart from the almagda exiting.
When therefore it is fixed, and does not ascend: then extract the almagda with ease: and you revolve your hand gradually. Then dissolve in water some of the clear gem salt: and wash the eye with it from the inside.
Then place over the eye all the linen, or wool soaked in rose oil, and egg white; and bind the healthy eye with it.
We, and those of our time, place on it pounded cumin with egg white.
If the almagda does not obey you in entering the eye because of its hardness, since it is from people whose eye is very hard: then it is necessary to take a spatula, which is called Alberid, of which this is the shape.
Therefore, gently scrape with it only the conjunctiva, and do not place your hand in the opening: and it is only to make a subtle path to the almagda's location.
Then introduce the almagda, as we have said.
And at the completion of your work, prepare a suitable sleeping area for the sick person, where they sleep on their back in a dark room: and forbid all movements and coughing: and place their food such that it soothes their nature: and they must not move their head to the right or left at all.
And let the bandage remain in accordance with its arrangement until the third day. Then remove it in that dark room, and test his vision: and make him see objects.
Then replace the bandage until the seventh day.
And it is not appropriate to do that at the time of treatment, or immediately after the incision: rather, it is necessary to delay it, because water ascends quickly through violent looking.
If, however, a hot abscess occurs: then it is necessary to remove the eye before the seventh day, and treat it with whatever quiets the abscess, until it subsides; then clear his vision, and apply an oral remedy to his face to regulate his vision under it for some days, while he remains in that dark room.
Then let him gradually emerge from the house, and move about in his own rooms.
And know that in a zaltée, a student is not excused from sight at times; then let him dare to undertake the operation.
And now indeed someone from those who are from Alayrach has come to us, who said that a perforated magdan was made in Alayrach, from which water is drawn.
But truly I have not seen anyone in your land who has done this; nor have I read it in any of the books of the ancients; and it is possible that it is new.
And these are the forms of the species from the magdan, so that he who is ignorant of them may stand upon it.
Let them be made properly of bronze; and let their extremities be triangular with this same fineness, and pointed.
Forms of the magdan.
Concerning the treatment of flesh grown in the nose.
Chapter XXIV.
Sometimes various fleshy growths arise in the nose, among which is something resembling a scorpion with many feet; and from it is cancerous flesh, stony, of a dark color; and from it is flesh that is soft, not of a dark color.
In that therefore which is soft of these fleshy growths, not deceitful nor cancerous, it is necessary that you make the infirm person sit between your hands facing the ground, and open his nostrils, and insert a hook into those growths; then pull them outward, and cut what you have grasped from them with a fine, sharp spatula on one side, until you know that the entire flesh has been removed.
If anything remains from that whose removal is not possible, then scrape it away with one of the fine instruments with ease, until nothing remains of it.
If, however, blood dominates it, or a hot abscess occurs, then apply to it what is appropriate; or if it is from malignant abscesses, then hasten to cauterize it, until the blood is separated, and all flesh is removed.
Then vinegar, and water, or wine, should be applied to the nose after the incision.
If, however, the nose opens, and moisture proceeds from it to the palate, then know that it is now healthy.
If, however, the moisture does not penetrate as it should, then know that within it is flesh grown on the upper nasal bones, to which the instrument did not reach with the incision.
Therefore, it is necessary to insert a linen thread of some thickness, and tie many knots in it; and place between each knot a quantity of a finger's width, or less; and let the infirm person, as much as possible, direct one end of the thread into the nose with a rod, or with whatever is possible for him after he has made it like a needle; and pull his odoriferous thing until it reaches the abscess, and emerges above his throat.
And many times children like Attomi do a similar thing in schools; and it is an easy thing for him who wishes.
Then place the two ends of the thread, one end which emerges above the nose, and the other which remains in the nose.
Then, and with instruments, cut away the flesh with the knots which are on the thread. Do that until you know that the flesh is now with the knots of the thread.
Then pull out the thread; and place in the nose after cleansing the blood, a pledget which you have soaked in Egyptian ointment: do this for three days, or more, until the ointment eats away all that remains of the flesh.
Then place at the end of the matter, into the nose, a lead cannula, for a few days, until it is healed.
If however it needs a treatment that dries it, use that.
To make a nasal douche, with which oils and other medicines are distilled into the nose, make it from silver or bronze: it should be like a small lamp, open like a shell: and its passageway should be similar.
And if you wish, make it a closed cannula, like a tube.
And the shell of the instrument for nasal irrigation should be full, revealed; which has a handle at its end, with which you hold it when you heat oil or whatever you wish from juices and fluid things in it.
And this is the form of the instrument. Of the treatment of nasal warts.
Chapter XXV.
Often a wart is born at the end of the nose, and it grows larger and increases with the days, until its appearance becomes unsightly.
And therefore it is necessary, that in the beginning of its appearance, you should cut it off and eradicate all of it.
Then place on the site either a cautery or a burning medicine that stands in its place.
If, therefore, its incision is delayed until it grows large, then consider, if it is stony, hard, of dark color, and insensitive: then do not touch it with iron, for it is a cancerous abscess.
For I have often seen that when a man cuts an abscess, and great harm results to the one who had it.
And if the abscess is soft to the touch, not dark in color, and you see that its incision is possible throughout, then evacuate the infirmity, and cut it without fear, without apprehension, and treat the site with something that dries and constricts, until it is healed.
Concerning the suturing of the nose, lip, and ear.
Chapter XXVI.
Know that when a separation of continuity occurs in one of these cartilages, little assistance is given in it by operation, except in some individuals.
Therefore, when something of that sort happens to someone, you should consider if it is a fresh wound with its own blood; and then bring the edges of the wound together with suture; afterward, treat it until it heals.
And if the edges of the separation of continuity are already separated, and each part is healthy, then you should scrape away all the part from its apparent skin, until it bleeds.
Then bring the two edges together with suture, and tie them, and powder upon it the blood of the dragon and crushed frankincense; and place upon the powders a piece of diafinicon plaster and some other of the consolidating plasters; and leave it bound for two or three days.
Then untie it, and change the medicine; and leave it until the threads cut themselves off. Then treat it with ointment until it heals.
The method of suturing is, that you bring together the separation of continuity, either with needles, as we have described in the suturing of the belly; or bring together the separation with thread, as I have made known to you.
Concerning the extraction of lip nodes.
Chapter XXVII. Many people often have hard abscesses, similar to the grains of herbs, in the interior of their lips; and some of them are smaller, and some larger.
Therefore, it is necessary to turn back the lip, and to split over every node of it, and to suspend it with a hook, and to cut it from every side.
Then fill the place after the incision with crushed zegi, until the blood is stopped.
Then it should be washed with vinegar, and the place where there is astringency should be treated with it, until the wounds are healed.
Concerning the incision of fleshy tissue on the gums.
Chapter XXVIII. Flesh often grows on the gums, which the ancients called abuluss.
Therefore, you should suspend it with a hook; or grasp it with forceps, and cut it near its root, and allow the pus or blood to run.
Then place on the affected area ground zegi, or other astringent, drying powders.
If that flesh returns after treatment, for it often does, then cut it again and cauterize it; for it does not return after cauterization.
On the extraction of teeth with iron.
Chapter XXIX.
Sometimes rough, foul, and sometimes darkened, yellowish, and greenish, hard crusts collect on the surfaces of the teeth from the inner and outer sides, and between the gums, until the decay reaches the gums, and the teeth become unsightly because of it.
Therefore, you should have the patient sit between your hands, with his head in your lap, and scrape the molar and tooth, where the crusts appear to you, and matter similar to sand, until nothing remains of them, and similarly do with the blackness, greenness, and yellowness, and other such things, until they are cleaned.
If, therefore, the matter that is on them from the beginning of the scraping is removed, it is good; and if not, then repeat the scraping on them another, second, and third day, until finally the desired result is achieved.
And know that a tooth requires scrapers of various shapes and forms, according to how the operation is prepared.  Therefore, the scraper used to scrape the tooth from the bottom is different from the scraper used to scrape between the teeth, according to different shapes.
And have these shapes of scrapers prepared, which you see.
Concerning the extraction of toothache.
Chapter 30.
You ought to treat the tooth from its pain with all ingenuity, and be slow in its eradication.
For there is nothing to replace it when it is eradicated, because it is a lofty substance: until when there is no excuse for its eradication, then it is necessary when the infirm is forced to eradicate it, so that it may be strengthened, and the aching tooth be certified by you.
For often pain deceives the infirm, and they think that it is in the tooth's saha, and they eradicate it: then the pain does not recede, until the infirm's tooth is eradicated.
For we have already seen this from the operation of phlebotomists.
Therefore, when the aching tooth itself is certified by you, then you should scarify around the tooth with a spatula, in which there is something of virtue, until the gum is loosened on all sides: then move it with your fingers, or with delicate forceps at first slowly, until you crush it.
Then place large forceps in a good position on it, and the patient's head between your knees: which you have already held well, so that it does not move: then pull the tooth according to its straightness, so that you do not break it.
If therefore it does not emerge, then take one of those instruments, and insert it under it from every side with ease, and attempt its movement, as you did at first.
If however the tooth is perforated or corroded, then it is necessary that you fill that hole with cloth: and tie it with the end of a thin ray, so that it does not break at the time of your constriction upon it with forceps.
And it is necessary that you act meticulously with the scarification around the gum from every side very much.
And maintain your strength so that you do not break it, and a part of it remains, and returns upon the sick person from that malice which is greater pain to him at first.
And beware, lest you do that which ignorant phlebotomists do in their haste, and their boldness in its eradication, beyond what we have described.
For they often cause great illnesses in men, which are more difficult to break, and the roots of it all remain, or some of them; or to extract it with some of the jawbones: as we have testified many times. Then it should be rinsed after its eradication with wine, or with vinegar and salt. If a flow of blood occurs from the places (for it often happens), then rub some zegi there, and fill the place with it; and if not, cauterize it if the zegi does not help you.
The shapes of the fine forceps with which the tooth is first moved should have long extremities, a short handle, and be thick, so that they do not double when pressed against the tooth; they should be like those with thick handles, so that when you tighten them, they do not yield or double: with short extremities, and made of strong iron, or well-made steel, with straight extremities; and on their extremities there should be teeth, some of which enter others, and grip with a fitting, strong constriction.
And sometimes the extremities are made like the shape of the beak of a bird called a stork, and they are of strong constriction.
Concerning the eradication of teeth, and the extraction of fractured mandibular bones.
Chapter Thirty-one.
When, during the extraction of a tooth, something remains, then it is necessary to apply to the spot a poultice of butter for one or two days, until the area softens; then introduce to it algasti, or forceps, whose extremities are similar to the beak of a bird called a stork.
This, however, is the form of the forceps.
Their extremities should be made like a file from within, or like aliskilfegi.
If, therefore, it does not yield to you for extraction with these forceps, then it is necessary that you carefully approach the root and expose all the flesh, and introduce an instrument called a small lever, whose form is this.
Let it be short in extremity, somewhat thick, and let it not be soaked, so that it does not break.
If, therefore, the root emerges through it, it is good; and if not, it is necessary to assist with other instruments whose forms are these.
The form of the first is triangular in extremity, in which there is a certain thickness.
The form of a triangular, slender extremity.
Also, it is helped with this instrument having two branches, whose form is this. And with other instruments and tools which preceded in the rationale of the teeth.
Also, let there be help with this instrument, which is likened to a large hook, of this form, triangular extremity twisted, in which there is something of thickness, so that it does not break; and let it not be soaked.
And know that there are many instruments for the teeth, and similarly, the remaining instruments are not counted, and the skillful craftsman, subtle in his art, finds for himself the instrument, according to that which operation and the illnesses themselves signify to him.
Since there are illnesses for which the ancients did not say there was an instrument, because of the diversity of their species.
If, however, a bone breaks from the jaw, or from other bones of the mouth, or rots: then probe over it in its place with that which is fitting to it from among the instruments and forceps which I have mentioned in the extraction of roots, and help with a chisel, the shape of which is this.
Let there be something of thickness in it gradually, so that the bone is tightened or held with it, and does not flee and go, until the bone emerges; and restore the place with medicines suitable to it.
If however there is small rot in the bone, then scrape it from its rot, and treat it until it is healed.
Of the sawing of teeth that protrude over others.
Chapter XXXII.
When teeth protrude not according to their natural course, a foul form is made by it; and especially when this happens in women and girls, namely those who are for sale.
For if a tooth has grown after another tooth, and is not in place, or if sawing or filing it is not possible, then extract it; and if it is attached to another tooth, then cut it with this instrument, of which this is the form.
It is similar to a small beak, and is made of tempered iron, with a very sharp tip.
And let your incision be such that you cut it over many days, and because of the hardness of the tooth, and so that another of the teeth is not moved.
If however it is prominent, exposed to its filing: then file it with a file made of tempered iron, of which the form is this.
Let the whole be of tempered iron, and its handle of small, pointed points, like the file with which needles are made; with which the tooth is filed little by little over many days with ease, so that the tooth is not moved and falls; then smooth it, finally scrape it with certain scrapers.
If, however, there is a tooth from which a part breaks off, and it injures the tongue: then it is necessary to file it also, until the roughness of that fracture is removed, and it is made equal; and it is flattened, and it does not injure the tongue, nor corrupt speech.
Concerning the retention of teeth with gold wires.
Chapter XXXIII.
When the front teeth are injured and displaced by a blow or fall, and the patient cannot bite on it without it falling, and you have treated them with astringent remedies and the treatment was not successful: then it is appropriate for them to be bound with gold wire; for silver turns green and rots after days, but gold never changes.
And let the wire be of medium fineness and thickness according to the amount that it needs to span between the teeth.
And the method of retention is to take a wire and insert twice its length between two healthy teeth; then weave the two ends of the wire between the loosened teeth, whether one or more, until you reach with the weaving to a healthy tooth on the other side.
Then repeat the weaving back to the place where you began; and tighten your hand with delicacy and skill until it is firmly held; and let your tightening of the wire be near the roots of the teeth, so it does not slip out.
Then cut the excess ends of the wire with scissors; and bring both ends together and twist them together; and hide them between the healthy tooth and the loose tooth so they do not harm the tongue; then let it be so tight as to remain.
If however it loosens or breaks, tighten them with another wire and it will remain so during the whole time.
And this is the method for teeth, and the shape of retention for two healthy teeth and two loose teeth, as you see.
And sometimes it happens that one or two teeth return after falling out to their places and are retained as we have described, and remain; and only a skilled, prudent, and experienced craftsman can achieve this.
And sometimes a piece of bone is fitted; and it is shaped like a tooth and placed in the socket, whereby the tooth is strengthened and tightened, as we said; and it remains and serves with it for a long time.
Concerning the incision of the ligament which occurs under the tongue and prevents speech.
Chapter Thirty-Four.
If there is something of hardness and knotting in it, and it is from the consolidation of a wound: then apply a hook to it, and split it across its width, until you cut the ligament, and the knotting is released.
If a flow of blood occurs, then place crushed zegi over the area. If, however, blood overcomes you, then cauterize the area with a lentiginous cautery, which is appropriate for it; then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it is healed. Concerning the extraction of a Ranula which occurs under the tongue.
Chapter XXXV.
Sometimes an abscess occurs under the tongue that resembles a small frog, preventing the tongue from its natural function; and perhaps it grows so large that it fills the mouth.
If therefore you see it to be of dark color, or black, hard, to which the sick person has no feeling: then do not touch it, for it is cancer.
And if it is inclined towards whiteness, in which there is moisture, then insert a hook into it, and cut it with a thin spatula, and free it from every side.
If blood overcomes you during your operation, then place powdered zegi upon it until the bleeding ceases; then return to your operation, until you extract it with its entirety.
Then wash it with vinegar and salt, and treat it with the appropriate remaining treatment, until it is healed.
Concerning the treatment of an abscess of the two tonsils.
Chapter XXXVI.
And then either you will pierce it, or it will break open by itself.
And if it is of white colour, round, and its root is thin, then it is necessary to cut it.
And the operation on it is, that you should consider before his operation, if the abscess has quieted, its heat having been completed by rest, or has lessened with some diminution: then therefore make the sick man sit before the sun, and let his head be in your lap: and open his mouth, and let the servant take between his hands, and press down his tongue with an instrument, of which this is the shape. Let it be made of silver, or bronze, which is as thin as a knife.
When therefore you press with it the tongue, and the abscess is shown to you, and your sight falls upon it, then take the hook, and fix it into the tonsil, and pull it outward as much as you can, besides which pull out with it something from the coverings.
Then cut it with an instrument, of which this is the following shape.
It resembles shears: however, let its ends be curved, so that the opening of each of them is in a straight line with the other sharply: therefore take care that it is made of tempered iron, or steeped in alfuled.
If however this instrument is not present, then cut it with a spatula, of which this is the form.
Let it be sharp on one side, not sharp on the other side.
And after you have cut one tonsil, cut the other according to this same type of incision.
Then after the incision, let the sick person gargle with cold water, or with vinegar and water.
If however a flow of blood occurs, let him gargle with water in which the peels of pomegranates have been boiled: or the leaves of myrtle, and similar astringents, until the flow of blood is stopped: then treat him until he is healed.
And sometimes other abscesses arise in the throat, besides the two tonsils.
Therefore, cut it according to what I have said about the incision of the two tonsils equally.
And I myself have already treated a woman from an abscess that arose between her throat, which was drawing to a purple hue, few in senses, which had almost completely closed her throat: and the woman breathed through a narrow passage, and I had already forbidden her from eating and drinking water: and she had already reached death if it had remained for one or two days.
And the abscess had ascended so much that it had emitted two branches, until they emerged above the two nostrils.
I therefore hastened quickly, and fixed a hook in one of them.
Then I pulled it, and a large portion was drawn from it.
Then I cut it off where I grasped it from the nostril.
Then I did the same to that which proceeded from the other nostril.
Then I opened its mouth, and pressed its tongue; and afterwards I fixed a hook in the abscess; then I cut off a part of it, and only a little blood ran from it: therefore the woman's throat was healed, and she immediately began to drink water, then took food.
Therefore I did not cease to cut from that abscess many times for a long time; and the abscess succeeded the place that I was cutting, until it was extended too much and with it that.
Therefore I devised and cauterized the abscess between the throat.
Therefore it remained from the addition; then I went away from that place, and I did not know what God did with her afterward.
Concerning the incision of the abscess of the uvula.
Chapter XXXVII.
When the catarrh descends to the uvula, and it becomes an abscess, and is long, then it is called a perpendicular one; and if it is in the lower part thick, round, then it is called a grape.
When it is treated with what we have said in the division, and the treatment does not help; and you see that the hot abscess has ceased from it, and is subtle; then it is necessary that you should cut it.
And that which is collected round from it, and has no length, and is bloody, or of a brown or black colour, and has no feeling, then it is necessary to avoid its incision.
For there is fear upon the sick person in it.
Therefore, when you see it according to the manner I have described, from its whiteness and length, you must make the sick person sit facing the sun; and press his tongue with the instrument of which the description preceded; then fix the hook into the uvula and pull it downwards; and cut it with one of the two instruments that I have mentioned in the incision of the two tonsils.
And it is necessary that you do not cut from it, except that which is added beyond its natural limit without addition.
For if you cut from it more, you will injure the voice and speech.
Then after the incision, use that which we described in the incision of the two tonsils, and treat it until it is healed.
If, however, the patient is frightened by the incision, then it is necessary that you use ingenuity in cauterizing it without fear and trembling.
And the method of the cautery on it is not, unless with sharp water, and it is that you place the head of the sick person in your bosom.
Then press his tongue with the instrument that we have said.
Then take from the water that I told you about in the chapter on cauterization, and make with it quicklime, not extinguished, and place it neither thick nor thin, and fill with it the concavity of this instrument, of which this is the shape.
Let the concavity in which the medicine is placed be like the concavity of a spoon's radius.
And place the instrument with the medicine upon the uvula itself, and let the sick person lie on their side, so that saliva flows from their mouth from the internal medicine, so that nothing from it descends to their throat and harms them.
Then hold your hand with the medicine.
And you shall apply it to the uvula for a half-hour, until you see that it is already blackened, and the biting of the medicine has settled.
And if you wish to take a pledget, and wrap it around the end of the radius, and instill the pledget with medicine, and insert the radius with the pledget into the cannula from above, until the pledget adheres to the uvula. Do that many times, until you obtain what you want from the cauterization of the uvula.
Then leave it; for it will dry and fall off after three or four days.
If you need to repeat the medicine, repeat it: and after the cauterization, wipe the surrounding uvula with a pledget soaked in butter, and cleanse whatever is around it of medicine; and wash it with cold water.
And treat it externally with embrocations, and internally with gargles, until it is healed.
This method of treatment is therefore healthier and further removed from danger.
And sometimes the uvula is treated with something finer than cautery and incision: it is treated with fumigation, in this manner.
Take calamint, hyssop, oregano, rue, sseah, chamomile, and absinthe, and similar herbs: and gather them all, or some of them, in a pot, and immerse them in vinegar, and boil them: and let the pot be properly plastered with clay; and let there be a hole in the middle of the pot, over which a concave instrument is placed in this way.
Let it be made of silver, or bronze; and let the end, on which is the pomegranate, be inserted into the sick person's mouth, until the vapor ascends to the uvula over the tube, until the uvula is darkened considerably.
Then repeat over it many times, until it dries.
And beware, lest you perform this treatment at the beginning of the abscess's arrival.
For it usually adds to the abscess; and it is not appropriate for you to do it unless at the decline of its hot abscess.
If however this instrument is not present to you, then take a tube, and place on its end the shell of an egg, so that the sick person's mouth is not burned; because the egg shell prevents the vapor from burning the mouth; and this is from good treatment with health.
Concerning the extraction of thorns and bones from the throat.
Chapter XXXVIII.
Often a bone, or a fishbone, or something else adheres in the throat.
Therefore, it is necessary to extract that which is apparent from them upon which the sight falls, after pressing the tongue with an instrument near the sun, and it is declared to you what is in the throat.
And what does not appear to you and is hidden in the throat, it is necessary that you make the weak vomit before the food is digested in the stomach.
For perhaps the attached thing will come out through vomiting.
Or let the weak person swallow a piece of turnip, or a lettuce root, or swallow a piece of dry bread; or let him take a piece of soft dry sea sponge: and tie it to a thread, then let him swallow it.
When therefore it reaches the place where the spines or bone are, and is extracted, then it comes out. If therefore it does not come out with what we have said, then use an instrument of lead according to this form.
Let it be thicker than a radius slightly, and at its extremity let there be a curve, which he should introduce into his throat with ease: and let him hold his head elevated upwards.
And let him beware of touching his epiglottis, so that coughing does not occur to him, and let him push with it the bone or spine, or let the physician introduce it with his hand.
But that the infirm introduce it is better, because of his knowledge of the place of the attached thing: and let him push downwards, or pull his hand with the instrument upwards, all that according to the amount prepared for him, until it emerges.
Concerning the extraction of the Leech.
Chapter XXXIX.
When the leech is medicated with what I have said in the division concerning treatment with medicines, and it does not help, then consider in the throat of the infirm in the presence of the sun, or in the sun after you have pressed his tongue with the instrument which I have told you.
If therefore your sight falls upon the leech, extract it with a small hook, or with slender forceps properly.
If it is not possible with them, then take a concave tube, and introduce it into the throat of the infirm almost to the gullet; then introduce into the concavity of the tube a heated iron with fire.
Do this many times, and let the infirm abstain from water all day.
Then let him take a vessel full of cold water, and open his mouth in it; and let him wash his mouth with it, and not swallow anything from it; and let him move the water one hour after another with his hand.
For the leech immediately, when it feels the water, falls.
If however it does not come out with what we have recounted, then fumigate the infirm person with fleas, or with asa, with the instrument that I have recounted in the fumigation of the uvula.
Do that many times, for it will fall itself.
And the method of operation in fumigation is, that you take a pot, in which there are live prunes with fire; and the pot is covered with a lid, in the middle of which is a hole; and the end of the instrument is placed in that hole.
Then direct the fumigation, and let the sick person put his mouth to the end of the cannula, and close his mouth, so that the fumigation does not escape, until you know that the fumigation has now reached the leech.
For the leech will immediately fall.
If it does not fall, then repeat the fumigation many times.
And let the sick person endure thirst, and eat salt and garlic, and do not drink water. Therefore, it is necessary that it depart with this treatment.
And this is the form of the instrument with which the leech is extracted from the throat, when it falls upon it visibly.
It is similar to forceps, as you see: except that it has this curvature that is inserted into the throat.
And its extremity is like the beak of a bird called a stork, in which there is the roughness of a file: when it grasps something, it does not release it at all.
Concerning the opening of abscesses, and their incision, and care in general.
Chapter XL.
Abscesses have many species, of many kinds, according to the recollection of them, namely one, and one in this book; and they are diverse in their perforation and incision according to two methods.
One of which is from the species of abscess in itself, and because it encompasses humors.
And the second method is due to the locations in which it occurs in the body.
Because an abscess occurring in the head is different from an abscess occurring in the anus; and an abscess occurring in fleshy tissue is different from an abscess occurring in joints; and each of them has its own judgment from the operation.
And of abscesses, some should not be punctured unless after the maturation of the pus in them, and its completion; and of them, some should be punctured while they are raw, and do not mature according to completion.
Like abscesses that are near the joints.
Because when an abscess occurs near a joint, and its duration continues until that which is around it putrefies, perhaps the ligaments or nerves of that joint are corrupted: therefore, it is a more proximate cause of the contraction of that limb.
Or is the abscess in a main limb: because if you delay its puncture until it matures, it will harm either the limb or through the limb the main part.
Or it is near the anus, therefore pierce it immaturely; and it is not fitting to pierce a raw abscess, not of complete digestion, except that which is near the anus, lest it putrefy deeply, and extend to the interior of the anus, and become a fistula, or become in its terminus that which is not healed. It is necessary to know the time of puncturing an abscess that has matured according to its completion: and this is through the calming of pain, the recession of fever, and the decrease in redness, and pulsation, and sharpness of the abscess head, and the rest of the signs. And it is necessary to make the same puncture in the lower place of the abscess, and of more prominent elevation; and let the puncture be penetrating in the length of the body, if the abscesses are in the parts of the hands and feet, and in places of tendons, and chords, and nerves, and arteries, and finally in all equal places where there is no reflection.
In those, however, which are reflected, proceed with the puncture along that limb.
When, however, the abscess is in fleshy places, then it is better to leave its puncture until its digestion is confirmed, as we said according to its completion.
For if you puncture it before that, the course of the virus from it is prolonged, and there is much filth and nastiness, and perhaps its lips are hardened, and its depth.
And some abscesses are punctured according to the breadth of the body in necessity, or according to the need of the limb.
And it is necessary that you administer a small puncture in small abscesses, and a large puncture in large abscesses, or many incisions by similarity of the abscess's size.
And there are abscesses in which it is necessary to hollow out the skin, and to incise when it has already become like a cloth, and it has reached its end, that it is already dead; such as that which happens in many, like carbuncles and buboes.
And some of them are cut with an incision having three angles.
And some of them are incised like the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Like an inguinal abscess.
And among them are those in which a round incision, and a crescent-shaped incision, and similar incisions are administered.
That which does not have a head, such as mild superficial abscesses, should be pierced with a superficial or merely a flat perforation.
And when the abscess is large, and has already collected much pus, and you pierce it, you should not be hasty and extract all the pus at that hour; rather, extract only a part of it.
Then plug the abscess until another day.
Then extract some more of the pus again.
Do this repeatedly according to stages, until it comes out; especially if the sick person is weak in strength, or a pregnant woman, or a small child, or an old decrepit person: for the animal spirit is often resolved from the animal with the expulsion of the pus; and perhaps the sick person dies, and you do not perceive it.
Therefore, beware of this chapter with great caution.
And after your perforation, with which you perforate these abscesses, it is necessary that you cleanse the wound: and consider.
If therefore the wound of the abscess is small, or is a flat incision, then apply bandages of linen, or old cloth.
And if the abscess is large, and the perforations are many, then it is necessary that you insert a bandage into every crevice, until they meet.
And if in the abscess you have cut off a part of the skin, or hollowed it out in a circle: then it is necessary that you fill it with old cloth, or as when a cloth is woven, or shaved with linen fluff without moisture; and bind it tightly until the third day.
Then remove it, and treat it with what is necessary of ointment, until it is healed.
If, however, a flow of blood occurs during your operation, then apply cold water and vinegar, after soaking a cloth in them; and place it repeatedly over the site of the blood flow.
If, however, the flow of blood persists, then it is necessary that you administer the regimen, and the treatment, and the powders, which I have described in many places of this book of ours, and from the division.
If, however, it is during the winter, and the site of the abscess is of many nerves: then it is necessary that you insert pads with warm wine and oil; and place them upon the areas.
And if it is in summer, and the areas are fleshy: then it is necessary that you place pads soaked in water and oil, or in wine and oil, and all of it cold.
Until when the third day shall arrive, as we said, then it is necessary that you open the abscess, and cleanse it, and administer in its treatment what is suitable for it, until it is healed.
This, therefore, is what is necessary from the knowledge of the treatment of abscesses universally.
According to the path of distinction, however, I have already spoken of every abscess, how there is a path to its treatment in particular, chapter by chapter.
Concerning the incision of abscesses that occur on the scalp.
Chapter XLI.
Small abscesses occur on the scalp, and they are of the nature of nodules, which are contained within membranes that are like sacs to them: as if they were the plucked follicles of a hen.
And their kinds are many.
Some are fatty; and some contain moisture like mud; and some contain moisture like crushed foods and gruels; and similar to these; and some are hard and stony.
And in the incision of all of them, and their extraction, there is no fear, as long as in their incision the artery does not oppose.
And the operation in their incision is, that you should test them with an instrument, whose form comes after this, which is called an Intromissum, until you know what they contain.
For if it contains moisture, then cut it with a superficial longitudinal incision, in this form.
And begin with an incision from line b to line g.  When the moisture is evacuated, then scrape the container holding that moisture, and do not leave anything from it at all.
For it often returns if anything remains from it. Then immerse the cotum in Egyptian unguent if it is present; and if not, in water and salt; and fill the wound with it, and leave it until another day.
For it will corrode what remained of the container. Then repeat over the cotum with Egyptian unguent a second, and a third time, and if you need it, until you are confident that nothing remains of the container, for then treat the wound with the unguent until it is healed.
If the abscess contains a fatty tumor, then cut it according to this form, the section having the shape of a cross; and insert hooks between the two sides of the incision, and scrape it from every side; and try your skill in extracting the tunic that contains it.
If however the artery resists you, then do what I will tell you afterwards.
And similarly do in an abscess, if it is stony, by the same incision and treatment, as we said. And the incision on a stony abscess is easier, because there is little blood and moisture.
And sometimes there are some of these abscesses that are on the head of certain people, in which there is no moisture at all.
Or make a perforation of them always from their lower part, so that the flow of pus is eased downwards.
Then treat them with whatever is appropriate for them in terms of treatment.
Concerning the incision of Strophulae on the neck.
Chapter XLII.
These abscesses often occur on the neck, and under the armpits, and in the groin: and sometimes they occur in the rest of the body.
And those that occur in the neck, are single, and multiple: and are generated from each other: and every strophula from them is within the tunic proper to it, as is in the nodes and abscesses of the head, as we have narrated.
And the varieties of these strophulae are many.
And from them are stony ones; and from them are those containing moisture; and from them are malignant ones, which do not yield to treatment.
Therefore, in that one of them which you see of good disposition to the touch, whose proximity to the skin color is manifest, and which moves in every direction, and is not attached to the nerves of the neck, nor to the veins, nor to the artery, nor is deep: it is necessary to remove it by a superficial incision from the upper part to the lower part of the body, from line b to line g, and to scrape it from every side; and stretch the two lips of the skin with a hook, or with many hooks, if you need it, as we said in the abscesses of the head, and extract it gradually.
And it is a precaution that the vein or nerve not be cut.
And let the scalpel not be excessively sharp, lest it injure your hand with the incision, or disturb the sick person, and you cut what is unnecessary.
However, if you cut a vein or artery, or if it prevents you from the operation, then place in the wound crushed zegi, or some powders that stop bleeding, and bind the wound, and leave it until the sharpness of the abscess subsides, and the wound softens: or it starts and wants to rot.
For the blood is stopped then, therefore return to your operation, until you complete it.
Then treat it.
If the entire tumor is cut, then it is necessary to bring together the two edges of the wound and suture it immediately, after you see that no excess remains.
However, if you see that excess remains due to the size of the tumor, then it is necessary to try to cut its root and remove it, and apply the suture we mentioned.
And whatever tumors contain humours, pierce it with a superficial incision, so that the place of its maturation may appear to you, and place the incision from that which follows below the body, as we have said.
Then, after the incision, apply dressings with ointment, and similar things, to corrode what remains of the corruption, until you see the wound is now clean.  Then treat it with a wound-healing ointment until it heals.
Concerning the excision of the epiglottis from an abscess occurring within the throat.
Chapter XLIII.
The ancients spoke of this excision of the epiglottis, and I have not seen anyone in our land who has performed it.  And this is the record of their words.
In those suffering from quinsy, the excision of the epiglottis should be avoided; since no benefit is obtained by it; because all the veins and lungs are weakened.
However, in those who have a hot abscess in the mouth, or throat, or both tonsils, when there is no disease in the channel, the excision of the epiglottis should be used, to avoid the loss caused by suffocation. Therefore, when we wish to do it, we should cut the epiglottis under three, or four, circles of the epiglottis, with a small incision across, in the area between two circles, so that the incision is in the skin, not in the cartilage.  This place is suitable for the incision, since it is devoid of flesh and the blood vessels are distant from it.
If the surgeon is timid, then it is necessary to extend the skin of the throat with a hook.
Then, he should cut the skin, until, when he reaches the channel, he should avoid the blood vessel if he sees any of them.
Then he should cut the skin, as we have described: and the incision of the channel is indicated by the phlegm that comes out of it, along with the rupture of it and the severance of the voice.
And leave the wound open for a time.
When therefore the time when suffocation is feared has passed, bring together the two lips of the wound in the skin, and sew it together itself alone, without the cartilage.
Then administer medicines that cause flesh to grow, until it is healed.
Says Albucasis.
The summary of this account we have given is not applicable except when they see that some of these abscesses have already filled the throat of the sick person: and the sick person is raised up above death, and his breathing wishes to be cut off: they go to cut the epiglottis, so that the sick person may breathe over the wound by some respiration, and be saved from death: and for this reason they ordered the wound to be left open until the malice of the illness is consumed, and its malice is three days, and as if of itself: then they ordered the wound to be sewn up, and to be cared for, until it is healed.
And that which I saw myself is that a certain maid took a knife and thrust it into her throat, and cut a part of the lung's passage with it.
And I was called to treat her, and I found her moaning, like the moan of a dead person.
I therefore explored the wound, and found little blood that had escaped from the wound.
Therefore, I believed that she had not cut a vein, nor a major artery, and wind was escaping from the wound.
I therefore hastened to and treated the wound until it was healthy, and nothing happened to the maid except hoarseness in her voice; and she returned after days to her better state.
Therefore, I say that there is no fear in the cutting of the epiglottis.
Concerning the incision of a hernia of the throat.
Chapter XLIV.
This abscess, called hernia of the throat, is a large abscess, according to the color of the body, and it is very common in women.
And it is in two ways: either it is natural, or it is accidental. In the natural one, certainly, there is no ingenuity.
The accidental one, however, is in two ways, one of which is similar to fatty tumors.
And the other way is similar to the abscess that arises from the knotting of an artery.
And in it there is fear, and it is not fitting that presumption be made towards it with iron, unless it is small; and you should probe it and investigate it with an instrument.
If therefore you find it similar to a fatty tumor, and it is not attached to any vein, then cut it, as tumors are cut, and extract it with what it contains from a cyst, if it is in a cyst; and if not, then examine its entire extent.
Then treat the area with what is appropriate from the treatment, until it is healed.
Concerning the incision on the nature of Tumors.
Chapter XLV. There are many types of tumors, and I have already mentioned all their types in the division; and it is necessary for me to explain here the difference between a tumor and a fistula, since it is a cause of doubt. Therefore, I say that when a fistula is present, there is heat, fever, and severe pain, until the ebullition of the superfluity subsides and putrefaction is complete; then the fever and heat cease.
However, with a tumor, there is no heat, no fever, no pain, and it contains a kind of enclosed cyst, which is a proper sac for them, and it is according to the color of the body; and their beginning is like a chickpea, and it becomes like a batche (or similar object), large or small.
And they are of two types: either fatty or containing moisture.
And the colors of moisture are many, as I have said in the division. Therefore, when you come to treating a tumor, you should examine it and investigate it first with an instrument called an *intromissum*, in the way that its form will be shown in the chapter after this.
And the method of investigating abscesses and all tumors is that you should take this instrument and insert it into the moistest place you find in the abscess; and you should revolve your fingers with it gradually until you know that the instrument has already penetrated the skin.
Then place your hand according to the measure of the size of the abscess.
Then withdraw the *intromissum* and consider what comes out in its wake.
If therefore running moisture of any color comes out, then cut it with a superficial incision, as I said in other abscesses.
And if no moisture comes out in the wake of the *intromissum*, then know that it is fatty; therefore cut over it with a cross-shaped incision, according to this form, as I taught you; and suspend it with hooks, and scrape the skin from all sides easily; and if possible, place a *kistin* upon it, to extract the healthy part along with the tumor.
If, however, the *kistin* is broken during the operation, and it is not possible to extract the healthy part, for this frequently happens, then remove it piece by piece until nothing remains of it.
For if some small or large part of it remains, the tumor will return most of the time.
If it overcomes you, and a little remains, then fill the wound at its completion with certain sharp corrosive powders, and bandage the wound, and place on it what sits warm over the abscess, and treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
If, therefore, the tumor is large, then sew its two lips together, and treat it with what causes it to heal. If, however, a pulsating or non-pulsating vein is contrary to you, then hurry, and fill the place with crushed zegi, and leave it bound for two or three days, until the wound putrefies and the ebullition of blood ceases; then return to cutting that which remained of the tumor.
Concerning the external instruments for cutting and piercing.
Chapter XLVI.
Among them are the forms of probes, and they are of three kinds.
For among them there is a large one, and among them is a medium one, and among them is a small one.
Let them be made of tempered iron, with square ends, so that they readily enter the abscess.
And these are the forms of probes, and, no, that is, perforating ones: and one of them is called a *beris*, that is, a perforator: and they are of three kinds.
For among them there is a large one, and a medium one, and a small one.
They are suitable for investigating abscesses, and openings, and fistulas, and buboes by means of it, that which is between the bones.
And others are made round, smooth, and gentle, like large needles with which saddles are sewn, namely of citron, or of brass, or of iron, or of silver. And the best of them are those made of citron.
And there are also experiences made of black lead, which are suitable for experimenting with fistulas, the concavity of which has reflections, so that they may be reflected with their gentleness with those reflections.
And they are again of three kinds. Because from them some are long, some medium, and some short, according to the quantity of the fistula's width and its constriction. The shape of Hooks, and they are of many kinds. Because some of them are simple, namely those which have a single curve: and they are of three kinds, as you see, Large, Medium, and Small.
And from them are blind hooks; and they are of three kinds.
And from them are hooks having two curves, and they are of three kinds: and from them are hooks having three curves, and they are of three kinds: and all these are necessary in their place.
And these are the forms of scalpels, with which knots and abscesses are cut and scraped: and they are of three kinds: because from them there is a large, medium, and small one.
Their cutting edges are sharp, the other edges are not sharp: and they are not placed thus, except that a benefit is achieved with them in scraping knots, for fear of cutting a vein or nerve: and so that the sick person may be healed by them, and find a little peace from the burning pain they find in the scraping of an abscess.
These are large ones, and are of three kinds.
They are made of metal, and are similar to a ray, with which alcohol is made: and at the broad end there is a hidden point of a spatula: and it runs inward and outward as desired, as you see.
The form of spatulas that are hidden between the fingers during the perforation of abscesses: and the sick do not perceive them: and they are of three kinds, large, medium, and small.
The forms of cupping glasses with which the flow of blood is cut off: and they are of three kinds, large, medium, and small.
They are made of metal or amber, round, a little in length, as you see: and let them be to the degree of thinness.
And it is necessary that these kinds of cupping glasses be large and small with you: so that you may cut off blood with speed when necessary, and then when medicine is not present.
However, do not use them for the cutting of blood in every part of the body, and do not use them except in fleshy places: such as the muscles of the thigh and hip, and the muscles of the arms, and the nipples, and the belly, and the groin, and similar fleshy, moist parts.
And sometimes from them are made other small instruments similar to hazelnuts, according to their form: with which blood is cut off when it flows from a phlebotomy site, or at an incision of a vein or artery: and sometimes they are made round in this shape.
Concerning the treatment of male nipples that resemble female nipples.
Chapter XLVII.
Sometimes the nipples of some men become inflated at the completion of sleep (that is, when they begin to be polluted in sleep) until they resemble female nipples: and they remain foul-looking, ulcerated.
Therefore, whoever abhors it, must cut above the nipples with a crescent-shaped incision, according to this shape from line b. to line g.  Then scrape away all the fat.
Afterwards, fill the wound with a medicament that promotes healing.
Then bring together the two lips of the wound with sutures, and treat it until it heals.
If, however, the nipple inclines downwards and softens due to its size, as happens with women, then it is necessary to slit it on its two upper sides with two similar crescent-shaped incisions, each one meeting the other at the ends of both, until there is a larger line containing a smaller one, according to this shape from line b to line g. Afterwards, scrape away the skin between the two lips, and remove the fat, and apply what we said about sutures and powders, which is necessary for treatment, until it heals.
If, however, you do not complete the incision that you ought to make, because of the patient's discomfort, or because of the flow of blood, then you ought to fill the wound with wool soaked in corrosive ointment, and leave it until it corrodes what remains of the fat.
Then treat it until it heals.
Concerning the perforation of an abscess, which occurs beneath the nipple.
Chapter XLVIII. These abscesses which occur beneath the nipple are of the nature of hard strophules, which contain cysts, and of those which contain humors.
Those of them which contain humors must be incised with a lunate incision, following this form, from line b to line g.  When, therefore, all that is within the abscess is evacuated with pus, then fill it with old wool and leave it until another day.
Then the wool should be removed, and it should be treated with a suitable ointment for it, until it is healed.
If the abscess is of the nature of knotted strophules, then incise over it, as we have said in the section on strophules, equally.
If, however, the wound extends so as to emit pus, then apply a cautery to it, according to what we have said in what has preceded.
Concerning the incision of an abscess that occurs due to artery and vein.
Chapter XLIX.
When an artery bursts, and the skin above it closes, an abscess often results.  And similarly, this happens with veins, so that an abscess and swelling occur in them.
And the signs by which one knows that an abscess and swelling are due to artery and vein are these: for when the abscess is due to an artery, it is long, aggregated deep within the body, and when you press on the abscess with your fingers, you feel as if there is a creaking sound to it.
And that which is due to a vein is round, on the surface of the body.
And incision upon this abscess is an error, and especially that which is under the armpits, and in the groins, and in the neck, and in many places of the body: and it is very large.
Therefore, one should avoid treating it with iron, and that which is also from them in the extremities, or in the head, should be avoided.
Therefore, for that which is from them from the swelling of the artery's opening, make an incision in the skin lengthwise.
Then open the incision with hooks, then the artery; and free it from its coverings, until it is exposed.
Then introduce a needle beneath it, and make it penetrate to the other side, and tie the artery with a double thread in two places, according to what I taught you in the extraction of the two arteries that are in the temples.
Then pierce the place, which is between the two ligatures, with a lancet, until all the blood within it is discharged, and the abscess is resolved.
Then administer treatment that produces pus, until the ligatures fall away; afterwards, treat it with appropriate ointments, until it heals.
If the abscess be due to the incision of a vein, then you should hold with your hand whatever you are able of the abscess with the skin.
Then insert a needle beneath the place you held with your hand, and make it penetrate; and let there be a double thread on it, until you draw it out from the other side.
Then bind the abscess with a good ligature, according to what I told you in the ligature of the grape, with two ends of thread from two sides. If, however, you fear that the thread will be pulled out, then insert another needle with another thread beneath the entire abscess at the incision of the needle; press, and tie your threads in four places.
Then cut the abscess in its middle, until that which is within it comes out; then cut away the excess skin, and leave that which is bound from it.
Then place upon it a poultice which you have soaked in wine and oil.
Then administer the treatment, which is done with bandages and ointments, until it is healed.
Concerning the abscess that arises from the twisting of nerves.
Chapter L.
Just as an abscess occurs in arteries and veins, so also an abscess occurs in nerves: this occurs in them through blows, or through excessive exertion, and similar causes; and it occurs most often in the areas of the helpers [muscles], or the heel, and in every place where joints move; and it is a severe abscess. Its color is similar to the rest of the body, and it is in many cases without pain; and when it is squeezed forcefully, the infirm person feels a sensation similar to numbness in it.
And it is not a deep-seated collected abscess, but rather is under the skin, and it moves to every part, and does not advance forward, or back to the rear.
Therefore, those that are in the joints should not be incised with a knife.
For perhaps contraction will result.
However, in that which is on the head or forehead, split the skin with a spatula.
If therefore it is a small abscess, then hold it with forceps and cut it away from the root.
And if it is large, then suspend it with a hook, and scrape it; then remove it, and close the wound with sutures; and treat it until it heals.
Concerning the incision of an abscess that occurs in the belly.
Chapter LI. Many people frequently have in their bellies, and in other parts of their bodies, growths that are called Fungalia, by reason of their similarity to fungi.
Their root is subtle, and their head is thick, and their lips are turned inward.
And some of them are small, and some of them grow very large.
And indeed I have seen a man, and in his belly there were two growths that were more similar to fungi than to anything else; there was no difference between them, white, with small roots, and their lips turned inward, and split open, and moisture flowed from them constantly.
Therefore, I cut them open, and found one weighing about 10 and 8 ounces and the other about 6 ounces.  And the operation for cutting them is this: if the patient is moist, and the color of the growth is white, moist, with subtle roots, then cut it with a wide scalpel, and have cauteries present in the fire.
For often a great deal of blood is expelled at its incision; therefore, if the blood overwhelms you, then cauterize it quickly.
If you see a weak and fearful patient from the incision with iron, then take a well-made lead thread and bind it with it: the method for which we described, and leave it for two days.
Then add to the lead binding.
Therefore, do not cease binding the lead, whenever it presses on the growth, until it is severed, and falls off by itself without effort.
If however the growth is of thick root, then in its incision there is something of fear and dread, especially that which is in the belly.
However, it is possible to cut half of it.
Then cauterize it, so that it does not return.
Then treat it until the wound heals.
And beware lest you presume to cut a growth that is dark coloured, of few senses, and foul in appearance: for it is indeed a cancerous abscess, and I shall come to a discussion of Cancer after this.
Concerning the treatment of the navel's eminence.
Chapter LII.
The navel's eminence arises from many causes.
Or from fissures of the abdomen, which is above the belly, and something protrudes from it, either wind, or an intestine, as happens in other ruptures.
Or from blood that flows from a vein or artery, as previously mentioned.
Or from wind constricted within it.
If however it is due to a fissure of the abdomen, and the protrusion is of this sort, then the colour of the abscess is similar to the colour of the body, and it is soft, without pain, and appears in various locations.
And if it is due to the protrusion of an intestine, then its location, along with what we have described, is of more diverse variety.
When therefore you press it with your fingers, it hides; then it returns, and perhaps there is a sound with it; and it greatly enlarges at the entrance to the bath and with strenuous exertion.
If however it is due to moisture, it is soft, then it does not hide when you press it with your hand, nor does it contract, nor does it increase.
If however it is due to blood, then with these signs the abscess appears a blackness from the clivus.
If however it is due to generated flesh: then the abscess is severe, large, hard, and fixed to one amount.
If however it is due to windiness, then its touch is soft. And the operation on it is, that you should consider then, if the eminence of the navel is due to blood of the artery, or vein, or windiness: then you ought to abstain from its treatment.
For in it is fear and terror, just as I taught you in the chapter, in which I said abscesses due to artery and vein.
If the eminence of the navel is due to the intestine or zirb, then you should instruct the sick person to hold their breath and stand outstretched.
Then mark with ink around the entire navel.
Thereafter, instruct him to lie on his back between your hands.
Then surround with a broad spatula the area around the navel, over the place you marked with ink.
Then extend the middle of the abscess upwards with a large hook.
Then tie it tightly around with thread, or with silk cord, a strong binding; and let the knot of the ligature be firm.
Then open the middle of the abscess, extended above the ligature.
If you find it already caught by the ligature, then remove the ligature, and insert your index finger into it, and push the intestine back into the belly; and if you find a hernia, then take it with a hook, and cut away its excess.
If however, it is an artery or vein, then go around it a lot.
Then return to your operation.
And take two needles, and insert into them two strong threads; and insert the two needles into the circumference you made around the abscess in the form of a cross, which you make pierce through.
Then tie off the abscess in four places above the needles; and if you wish, remove the needles, and leave the place until the stretched flesh rots; and it falls away by itself; or cut it when it becomes thin and rots.
Then treat it with what is necessary of ointments, until it is healed.
If the eminence of the navel is from flesh that is protruding there, or from moisture, then it is necessary to hollow out the abscess, as we have said.
And extract the blood, or moisture, which you find in it.
Then treat it with what solidifies the place.
Concerning the treatment of CANCER. Chapter LIII.
For I could not cure anyone of it, nor did I see anyone before me who succeeded in doing so.
And the treatment for it, when located as we said, is to proceed and free the afflicted from the black cholera at times.
Then, if you find it with evident fullness, phlebotomize it.
Then prepare the afflicted with the preparation in which they will be positioned for the operation.
Then insert into the Cancer the hooks that suit it.
Afterwards, hollow it out from every side with the skin, according to examination, until nothing remains of its roots: and let the blood run, and do not cut it quickly, but rather squeeze the places, and wipe away all the thick blood with your hand, or with any suitable instrument there.
If, however, a contrary flow of thick blood from the incision of an artery or vein occurs, then cauterize the vein until the blood is stopped.
Then treat it with the remaining treatment until it is healed.
Concerning the treatment of dropsy.
Chapter LIII.
We have already recounted in the division of the species of dropsy, and how the collection of water occurs: and the signs of every species, and its treatment with medicines.
And that which is cured with iron is only the species of ascites alone: and it is not approached with iron for the species of tympanitis: nor for the species of hyposarca at all; for that is mortal.
When you have already treated this species of dropsy, tympanitis, with medicines, and your treatment has not availed: then consider.
For if weakness has already overtaken the sick person, or there is another illness with him besides dropsy, such as if there is coughing, or looseness of the belly, and things similar to them: then beware of treating him with iron; because there is fear of that.
If, however, you see the sick person of exuberant strength, and there is no illness with him besides dropsy alone: and he is neither a child nor an old man: then the method of operation in him is that you raise the sick person standing between your hands, and a servant behind him press his belly with his hand, driving the water to the lower part of the chest.
Then take a pointed, spiny spatula, according to this form.
Let it be of two pointed parts, long, with sharp ends, like a spatula.
However, let there be something of shortness gradually, so that you do not proceed with it in the operation all the way to the intestines, and harm him.
Then consider.
For if the generation of dropsy is from the intestines, then it is necessary that you extend the incision from the navel a quantity of three fingers, downward in a direct line above the pubic bone.
If however the generation of dropsy is because of illness of the liver: then let your incision be to the left of the navel by three fingers.
And if its generation is because of the spleen, then let the incision be on the right side: and it is also not necessary that the incision be on the side on which the sick person wishes to lie, so that superfluities do not run to that weak place.
Then pierce through the entire skin with the instrument.
Then introduce it into that incision, and raise your hand with the spatula between the skin, and if you do, as if you are scraping it, and let the amount that is scraped be the quantity of a fingernail, or approximately that.
Then pierce, if you do so, until the spatula reaches the empty space: and it is the space of water.
Then draw it out, and introduce into the hole the instrument, which has this form.
And it is similar to a cannula: it is made of silver, or bronze, or brass, smooth, polished: to which at its lower part is a small hole, and on its sides are three holes, two on one side, and one on the other side: and the end of it is cut, according to the manner of cutting a reed, as you see: on its upper end is a ring.
For when the instrument arrives at the water, then it itself descends immediately upon the instrument, therefore evacuate from the water in an hour a medium quantity.
Because if you evacuate from it more than is necessary, perhaps the sick person dies in an hour through the resolution of his animal spirit; or a swoon occurs to him which approaches death.
But evacuate from it according to the quantity of its virtue, and according to what the dispositions of the sick person indicate to you by the strength of his pulse, and by his condition.
Then remove the instrument, and retain the water.
That is, because it is immediately retained on account of the skin that retains the opening which is above the sifac; of which I spoke, that you should perforate it according to that manner.
Then again use the instrument on the second day, if you see the sick person tolerate it; and also extract a small quantity from the water. Do this for several days without fear, and guard yourself from error, until only a little remains of the water.
However, if you fear for the sick person, and you leave out a great deal of water, then treat him with burial in hot sand, and much sweat in a bath and sun, and let him endure thirst; and treat him with drying medicines, until he is healed; and cauterize the stomach, liver, and spleen, after the extraction of the water, according to what I have described in that which came before.
Concerning the treatment of infants born with their urinary passages not perforated.
Chapter LV. When someone emerges from the womb of their mother, and the opening of their urethra is not perforated, or is a narrow opening, or is in the wrong place.
Therefore, it is necessary to help with its perforation immediately when it is born, with a very fine Spatumili, according to this method.
Then place a fine leaden nail in the opening, and tie it; and hold it for three days, or four.
When, therefore, it wants to emit urine, it is removed, and it urinates.
Then replace it.
And if you do not place lead, it is now possible that the urine which flows over the place will not allow it to close.
However, the one whose opening is constricted is treated with lead, as we have said, for many days, until it is enlarged.
But those in whom the opening is in an improper place are injured.
Because in those who are born, the opening is at the end of the penis: therefore, they cannot urinate forward until they raise their penis upward with their hand. Nor is there generation for him, because the semen cannot reach the uterus in a straight line: and it is a very foul sickness.
And the method of treatment in him is that the sick person should be placed on his back.
Then extend his penis with a strong pull of your left hand, and cut off the head of the penis from the location of the glans, with a sharp lancet or a pointed scalpel; just as you would cut a reed, or as you would shave something, so that its middle comes out like the head of the penis, and that the opening falls in the middle, as is necessary.
And beware of blood flow during your operation.
For it often happens.
Therefore, apply to it whatever stops the blood, and treat the wound until it is healed.
Concerning matters affecting the foreskin and the head of the penis, and concerning its corruption, blackness, and adhesion.
Chapter LVI.
These affections frequently occur in the penis, and there is an eminence of foul flesh.
And from it there is another that is malignant, and another that is not malignant.
Therefore, the non-malignant one should be suspended with a fine hook, and cut away until the whole is cleansed.
Then place upon it a poultice soaked in Egyptian ointment. Then treat it afterwards with diachylon ointment, until it is healed.
If, however, it is malignant, of foul color, then it is necessary to apply a cautery to it after its incision and scraping.
If, however, the albather is in the foreskin of an uncircumcised captive, and part of the albather is within the foreskin and part outside, then it is necessary to remove the albather that is inside first, until it is consolidated, then treat the external part: because when you treat them simultaneously, the foreskin is not safe from being pierced.
And such things also occur in the testicles, and the foreskin, with blackness and corruption.
Therefore, it is necessary to cauterize all that is already blackened, and that which is about to be corrupted, or is already corrupted.
Then apply a line over it after that with honey that has already been mixed with the flour of pomegranate bark, and ground, sifted herbs.
Then treat it with the rest of the treatment, until it is healed.
If, however, a flow of blood occurs, then apply the cautery with the lunar cautery, according to this form.
For the cautery is helpful for two conditions at once, namely for the flow of blood, and a wound when it becomes corrupted.
If the head of the penis is eroded, and the whole thing is destroyed within an hour, then it is necessary to insert a lead cannula into the urethra, so that the patient may urinate over it.
In the adhesion of the foreskin to the head of the penis, and this adhesion indeed occurs only in one whose foreskin is healthy, and circumcision is not required upon him: and sometimes adhesion occurs because of a wound, or an abscess: therefore it is necessary to exfoliate it with a blunt Spatumili, until the ligament is loosened, and the head of the penis is freed from every part.
If it is difficult to distinguish them exquisitely, then it is necessary to exfoliate somewhat from the head of the penis, and from the foreskin.
This is because when the foreskin is thin, perhaps it is perforated quickly due to its thinness.
Then separate the foreskin and the head of the penis with a thin linen cloth that has already been moistened in cold water, so that they do not adhere again.
Then treat it with astringent wine, until it is consolidated. Concerning the cleansing of infants, and the treatment of errors that befall them.
Chapter LVII.
Circumcision is not a solution of continuity, like other wounds; however, since it is from our operation, by our will, and its use is proper to boys, it is necessary for us to mark it with a better operation and a lighter path leading to health.
Therefore, I say that the ancients did not speak of circumcision in any of their books, since they do not use it in their laws, and it is only what we have acquired through experiment.
This is because I have found the majority of artisans and phlebotomists using cleansing, circumcising with a razor and with scissors; and they use leeches, and ligation with thread, and incision with a nail.
And indeed I have already tested all these methods, and have not found a better cleansing than with scissors, and ligation with thread.
Because in cleansing with a razor, the skin often escapes.
Because the foreskin has two layers: therefore perhaps the upper layer of skin is cut, and the lower layer remains; therefore, it is necessary to make another incision to cut the other, and future pain will result.
And with the cleansing done by leeches, that is, digital, which the surgeons use, the incision of the extremity of the male member is not secured; because perhaps it enters into its opening.
In cleansing with a claw, perhaps the iron slips out and spoils your operation; and the skin of a child is short-lived by nature, and they are often born in such a way that they do not need cleansing; and I have already seen that.
However, cleansing with shears, and ligature with thread, has shown me a good experiment; because shears are proportional to the incision; because the sharpness that is above is like the sharpness that is below.
When therefore you press your hand, the two sharpnesses are proportioned, and they cut according to one operation at one time; and a compression of a similar shape is made, containing the skin of the penis from every side, with which no error falls at all.
And the proper method of operation is, that you make the boy, especially if he is one of those who understand a little, estimate that you do not do anything except tie a thread to his penis only; and you leave him until another day.
Then make him rejoice and be glad in every way possible for you, from that which his understanding receives.
Then introduce your hand into his penis, and blow into the skin, and pull it upwards until the head of the penis emerges.
Then cleanse it of the dirt that has accumulated on it.
Then tie the marked place with a double thread.
Afterwards tie a second ligature a little lower than that. Then hold the place of the lower ligature with your index finger and thumb, applying a good grip, and cut between the two ligatures.
Then quickly lift the skin upward and pull out the head of the rod.
Then allow the blood to run slowly (for this is better) and place powder on top; and over the powder, a cloth on which is spread the yolk of a hard-boiled egg in rose water, stirred with good fresh rose oil: and leave it on top until the next day; and treat it with the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
The shape of the scissors for cleansing is this.
Let the two ends be blunt, and be sloping; so that the branch of the nail does not protrude from them; and let the length of the two sharpened parts be the same as the length of the two handles, equally.
An error, however, occurring in cleansing is: because perhaps the inner skin is entirely or partially escaped at the incision. Therefore, it is necessary to extend it from your hour with your fingernail before the place becomes an abscess; and cut it according to equality.
If you cannot hold it with your fingernail, then pull it out with a hook and cut it.
However, if three days have passed, and that which is under the rod remains swollen, an abscess: then leave it until the abscess is mature, and scrape it off easily, and cut it according to what is prepared for you, and beware of the head of the rod.
For it will not harm it.
Therefore, treat it with that which consolidates a wound from the powders, which we have described in the treatise on powders; and if it is cut from the skin beyond measure, and extends to the upper parts, it will not harm it even then.
Therefore, treat it with what we have said, until it is healed.
On the extraction of retained urine in the bladder.
Chapter LVIII.
Retention of urine in the bladder occurs from an obstruction caused by a stone, or congealed blood, or pus, or a growing flesh, and similar things to those that we have mentioned concerning methods of treatment in the division.
And if the urine is not released, and you see that its retention is due to a stone that is already in the neck of the bladder, then it is necessary that he be weak, bent over on his knees.
Then let his feet be placed on his back, and let him stretch his belly from the upper part of his back, and let the weak man strain his breath as much as possible.
Thus, pressure is applied to the neck of the bladder for the expulsion of the stone to the rear: therefore, the urine is released.
If, however, it is not released with what we have said, and the matter is severe upon the sick person, then it is necessary that you administer its extraction with an instrument, which is called a syringe, of which this is the form: it should be of silver, and be thin, smooth, concave, like the quill of a bird in its thinness, and long like one and a half palms; with a thin tube at its head.
And the method of the urine's exit through it is that you take a doubled thread, and tie wool or tow, a good ligature, to its end; and insert the thread's end into the lower part of the syringe; and cut with scissors if any wool protrudes, but insert it into the tube with force, as if hoisting it up.
Then anoint the syringe with oil, or with butter, and the white of an egg; and make the sick person sit on a seat, and embrocate the bladder and his penis with moist oils, and olive oil, and warm water.
Then insert the syringe into the penis with ease, until it reaches the root of the penis.
Then double it upward from the navel's area. Then drive the syringe within it, until it reaches the bladder, and the sick person senses that it has reached the empty space: and this is not done in this manner unless because the passage, in which it travels, is winding.
Then extend the thread with wool gradually.
For the urine will follow the wool.
Then pull it out, and cause the urine to run through the urinary path: and again use the syringe, and do not cease to do it, until the bladder is emptied, and the sick person finds relief. Concerning the quality of bladder clysterization with a clepsydra.
Chapter LIX.
It is indeed deaf, that is, closed.
And in it are three openings, two on one side and one on the other side, as you see.
And the hollow place, in which that which propels it is situated, should be according to the quantity that fills it without addition, until when something is pulled with it, humidity is drawn out; and when it is propelled, it expels it to a distance; according to which the clepsydra does, by which naphtha, that is, Greek fire, is projected in the battles of war.
Therefore, when you wish to project the moisture into the bladder, introduce the end of the clepsydra into the moisture, and pull with that which propels it upwards, for the moisture is drawn into the concavity of the clepsydra. Then introduce its end into the tube, according to what we have described in the syringe.
Then propel the moisture with that which propels it, for that moisture arrives at the bladder immediately, so that the sick person feels it. The form of a fine enema, by which the bladder is enematized.
Then introduce a strong thread into those openings, as they revolve. Then close the circle, as a flask is closed; after you put in it what you wish of the moistures, and oils, and waters.
Then tie it to the instrument, and do with it as you did with the bladder by pressing with your hand, until the moisture reaches the bladder.
Concerning the extraction of the Stone.
Chapter LX. We have already spoken in the division of the species of Stone, and its treatment with medicines; and I have spoken of the difference between a stone generated in the kidneys and the bladder, and the signs of each of them; and I have spoken of the stone in which operation is done with the hand and incision: and the stone generated in the bladder properly is that which is fixed in the urethra; and I am recounting it with clear explanation and brevity.
Therefore, I say that a stone generated in the bladder happens most often in children.
And among its signs is that the urine departs from the bladder like water in its subtlety, and white sand appears in it, and the infirm person rubs his urethra, and suffers with it, and hangs down often. Then it becomes erect, and the anus emerges with it in many of them.
And the cure is easy for children, as long as they do not reach fourteen years of age.
And it is difficult in the elderly.
However, in young people it is moderate, in that it lies between those two: and the cure is easier for the one whose stone is larger; and if it is small, the cure is conversely more difficult.
Therefore, when we come to the treatment, it is necessary first to cleanse the sick person with an enema, which will remove all the faeces that are in their intestines; for it sometimes prevents the discovery of the stone during the examination. Then let the sick person be taken up with their feet, and shaken, and moved downwards, so that the stone may descend to the depths of the bladder, or jump out of a high place at times.
Then have him sit between your hands prepared, and let his hands be under his thighs, so that the whole bladder may be inclined downwards.
Then examine him and touch him externally.
If therefore you feel a stone in the space, then immediately proceed with the incision over it.
But if it does not fall under your touch at all, then it is necessary that you wipe your index finger with the oil of your left hand, if the sick person is a boy; or the middle finger if he is a full grown youth; and insert it into his anus, and examine for the stone, until it is under your finger; and turn it gradually towards the neck of the bladder.
Then press upon it with your finger, and drive it outwards against the place whose incision you desire; and order a servant to press the bladder with his hand, and order another servant to extend the testicles upwards with his right hand; and with his other hand, to remove the skin that is beneath the testicles in the part near the place where the incision is.
Then insert the Spatumile, which has this shape.
And find it in the space between the anus and the testicles, and not in the middle, towards the left flank; and let the incision be over the stone, and your finger be in the anus; and let the incision be transverse, so that the incision is wide externally and narrow internally, according to the quantity that it is possible for the stone to emerge from it, not larger.
For perhaps the finger, which is in the anus, compresses the stone at the incision, and it emerges without difficulty.
And know that the stone, which has angles and edges, makes its exit difficult because of this.
And if it is smooth, like a gland, and round, its exit is easy.
Therefore, to the one with angles and edges, add a fissure.
If it does not emerge thus, then it is necessary to devise something over it: either to string over it with a well-formed instrument, the tip of which is like the Moon, that it may string over the stone and not escape from it; or to introduce a slender instrument, curved at the end, beneath it.
If however you cannot do so over it, then widen the opening a little.
If something from the blood overcomes you, cut it away with a zegi.
If however the stones are more than one, then drive the largest first towards the bladder's opening.
Then cut over it.
Afterwards, drive the small one after that; and similarly do if there are more than two.
If however it is very large, then it is ignorance to cut over it with a large incision.
For it happens to the sick person one of two things, either that he dies, or that a constant dripping of urine happens to him; because the place does not completely heal.
But administer its expulsion, until it comes out; or devise means for its fracture with forceps, until you extract it piece by piece.
When therefore you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with frankincense, and aloe, and dragon's blood; and bind it, and place over it a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or rose oil, and cold water; as is done for a hot abscess.
Then lay the sick person on his back, and do not loosen the bandage until the third day.
When you have therefore loosened it, embrocate the place with water and much oil.
Then treat it with diapason ointment, and basilicon ointment, until it is healed.
If however a hot abscess, and corrosions, and similar things, happen added to the wound: such as if blood clots in the bladder, and prevents urine from passing; and this is recognized from the passing of blood with the urine.
Therefore insert your finger into the wound, and extract that blood.
For if it remains, it provokes corruption of the bladder and its putrefaction.
Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt, and apply whatever is suitable for treatment, until it is healed.
And it is necessary in the entire course of treatment, to bind the two hips, and apply, because of the medicines that are placed on the place.
If a stone is small, and is in the channel of the penis, and is fixed in it, and the exit of urine is hindered, then treat it with what I described before you reach the incision.
For often you will be spared from incision by this treatment, for I have already tested it. And it is to take a perforator of iron, of which this is the form, triangular end, sharp, fixed in wood.
Then take a thread, and tie the penis with it under the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.
Then introduce the piercing iron into the penis with ease, until the perforator reaches the stone itself: and turn the perforator with your hand on the stone gradually: and try to pierce it, until you make it penetrate from the other side.
For the urine is discharged immediately.
Then press your hand upon that which remains of the stone from the outer part of the penis.
For it breaks, and emerges with the urine, and the sick person is healed.
If however this treatment is not prepared for you, due to something preventing it: then tie a thread below the stone, and another thread above the stone. Then cut above the stone on the penis itself between the two ligatures.
Then extract it.
Afterwards, loosen the ligature, and cleanse the congealed blood that forms in the wound.
And the ligature of the thread below the stone is not necessary, except so that it does not return to the bladder; and the other ligature on top, except so that when the thread is loosened after the stone's exit, the skin returns to its place and covers the wound; and for that reason it is necessary for you to elevate the skin upwards when you tie the upper thread, so that it returns to its proper position and covers the wound, as we have said.
Concerning the extraction of the stone in women.
Chapter LXI.
Little stone is generated in women.
However, if a stone happens to any of them, then the cure is difficult, and it is forbidden due to many methods.
One of them is: that the woman is perhaps a virgin. And the second is, because you do not find a woman who reveals herself to a physician, when she is chaste, or having husbands.
The third is, because you do not find a woman well-knowing this art, especially the operation with the hand.
And the fourth is the distance from the stone's location: wherefore it needs a deep incision, and in that is fear.
If necessity provokes it, then it is necessary that you take a female physician, well-knowing: and little is found.
If truly you keep her private, then seek a chaste, subtle physician, and present a female midwife well-versed in matters of women, or a woman who hints at a part of this art: make her present, and especially to her, let her do all that you command her from the inquiry concerning the stone. First of all, that she should see if the woman is a virgin: then it is necessary that she insert her finger into her anus, and seek the stone.
If therefore she finds it, she should hold it under her finger, and then command the midwife to insert her finger into the weak woman's vagina, and inquire about the stone, after she places her left hand on the bladder, and compresses it with a good compression. If therefore she finds the stone, then it is necessary that she gradually move it from the opening of the bladder downwards with all her strength, until she reaches it with the root of the thigh.
Then let her cut upon it at the midpoint of the vulva near the root of the thigh, from whichever side it is prepared for her, and she feels the stone in that part: and let her finger not be removed from the stone, holding it tight; and let the incision be small at first.
Then let her insert a ray upon that incision.
If therefore she feels the stone, then let her add to the incision according to the proportionate quantity that the stone emerges from it.
And know that the species of stones are many. For among these there is a small one, and a large one, a smooth one and a rough one, a long one, and a round one having branches.
Therefore know its species, so that this may be shown to you about that which you wish.
If therefore the blood overcomes you, then add in the place of the crushed zegi, and hold it for one hour, until the blood is cut off.
If, however, the flow of blood overcomes you, and you know that the expulsion of blood is from the artery that has been cut: then place powder upon the place, and bind it with suitable ligatures: and do not change it: and leave the stone, and do not extract it.
For perhaps the weak woman will die.
Then treat the wound.
When, therefore, the sharpness of the blood subsides after days, and the place putrefies, then return to your operation, until the stone emerges.
Concerning the incision of a watery hernia.
Chapter LXII.
A watery hernia is not present unless there is a collection of moisture in a white sifac, which is under the skin containing the testicle: and it is called sifac. And sometimes it is in its own membrane, which nature has prepared for it in the part of the testicle, until it is corrupted: which is another testicle, and the skin of the testicle is between the white sifac, which we have said: and this does not occur except rarely.
And the generation of this hernia indeed is from the weakness which happens to the testicles: wherefore this matter is poured out upon them.
And sometimes it happens from a blow to the testicles.
And this moisture has many colors. For either its color is sloping toward yellowness, or it is blood-red, or foul, black, or watery white, and that is what is most.
For if it is in the white sifac which we said, then the abscess is round, somewhat the length of an egg; and the testicle is not apparent, since the moisture encompasses it on every side.
And if the moisture is in the proper membrane to itself, then the abscess is round with a part of an egg, and because of this, a man thinks it is another egg.
And if the moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the white sifac, then it falls under the sense.
Therefore, when you wish knowledge of the color of the moisture, then experience the color of the moisture in the abscess with the inserted square, whose form preceded.
Therefore, according to that which emerges in the trace of the Intromiss, judge concerning that which is between it.
When, therefore, we come to treatment with iron, then it is necessary that you instruct the sick person, that he be bled if possible for him, and you see his body full.
Then he shall be laid on his back upon a somewhat high object, and place many cloths beneath him.
Then sit you upon his left side, and instruct the attendant to sit on his right side, who shall extend his rod to one of the two sides of the skin of the testicles, and to the part of the navel of the belly.
Then take a broad spatula, and cut the skin of the testicles from the middle lengthwise, nearly to the pubic bone; and let the incision be according to the straightness of an equidistant line that divides the skin of the testicles, until it reaches the white sifac that contains it; and scrape it and observe it, or beware of this, so that you remove it; and let your scraping, with which you scrape it, be on the part that hangs more with the egg; and subtly examine it with the scraping, to the extent that is possible for you.
Then pierce the sifac full of water with a wide perforation, and extract all the water. Then separate the two lips of the incision with hooks, and extend the sifac upwards, and do not touch the skin of the testicles containing it; and cut the sifac however you are able to cut it, either with its entirety or in pieces, especially its thin side.
For if you do not carefully examine it, there is no security in its incision, lest the water return.
If, however, the egg protrudes outward from its skin during your operation: then when you have completed the incision of the sifac, return it.
Then aggregate the two lips of the testicular skin with sutures.
Then treat it like other wounds, until it heals.
If you find a corrupted egg, black with other discoloration, then you must tie off the vessels, which are the suspensories, fearing a flow of blood.
Then cut off the testicle with the suspensory, and remove the egg: afterwards treat it with what we have said.
If indeed water is aggregated in two parts, then know that there are two branches: therefore cut the other part according to what you did to the other equally.
And if it is equal to you, so that it is one operation, then do so: afterwards wipe away the blood.
And introduce into the incisions wool soaked in oil, or in rose oil: and place outside wool which you have soaked in wine and oil, and spread it over the two testicles, and the belly area: and place over it doubled cloths, and they are cushions: and tie them over with a bandage, which has six according to this form.
Then take two cloths, and sew them together, and fill them with dyed wool, according to this likeness: and make the ends with which they are pressed from cotton, or damp wool: and they are aggregated with a constriction in the lumbar region of the breeches: and one end takes over the anus up to the back, and the second takes to the side of the comb: and two ends over the two thighs below, and two other ends over the two groins, and the whole constriction is aggregated in the lumbar region of the breeches.
And sometimes this branch is artificially treated with a cautery at the incision site with an iron: and it is that you take a thin, knife-like cautery, and cut with it the skin of the testicles: and it is heated, as we have described: until when a whitish substance containing water is revealed: then take the cautery, according to this form.
It resembles the Greek letter.
Then pierce it with it, and it is heated, until all the moisture comes out.
Then stretch the sifac with hooks, and scrape it with a heated fine cautery, and cut it as much as possible, until you remove all of it.
And be careful, from the egg, lest the fire touch it.
And know that this operation is safer, and further from blood flow, and better than the operation with section.
If, however, opposition occurs to you at the time of the section, or a hot abscess at the time of the cautery, or a blood flow, or anything else: then it is necessary that you treat whatever causes opposition to you from it with the treatment that suits it, according to what has been stated before.
If, however, the patient is timid and does not expect this operation because of its horror, then administer the perforation as I describe it: and so it is.
When it is certified to you by what we have said about the signs that the branch is watery, then it is necessary that you make the patient sit on a raised seat.
Then pierce the abscess in its lower part with a broad spatula, and place the perforation along the length of the body, and let the opening be wide until all the water flows out.
Then place a poultice on the location, and bind it, and let it run until the remaining water is discharged; then treat it until the wound heals.
If, however, there is resistance to the outflow of water at the time you pierce it, and that resistance is only because a white cloth creates resistance in the wound opening, and prevents the escape of water, then it is necessary that you insert a pen into the wound, or an instrument with which the water of hydrops is extracted, the shape of which preceded: or add a little to the wound operation.
And know that the water returns and collects after six months, or about that time.
When therefore it collects, then let it be pierced according to the same method, and the sick person will pass their days.
Concerning the treatment of fleshy tumors.
Chapter LXIII.
Know that in the section concerning this tumor, there is a fear leading to destruction in many conditions.
Therefore it seems to me that its removal is saved from it.
And I am remembering the operation on it, and the appearance of the abscess.
I say therefore that many abscesses occur in the bodies from which testicles are composed; and this happens from many causes, namely. Or from a sharp or acrid superfluity that is discharged to the testicles.
Or from a blow.
And the color of the abscess is according to the color of the body, and pain is not found in it; and it is a serious abscess.
And perhaps it is a stony abscess, whose color is dark, and there is no sensation in it.
And sometimes it arises from the knotting of arteries and their inflation; as its recollection has already preceded; or from the inflation of veins.
Therefore, that which is from them, from the inflation of the arteries, is recognized by the disposition of the abscess, when you compress it with your fingers.
And it is not necessary that you touch it completely.
But that which is made from the inflation of the veins, nothing is spread from it by compression with the fingers. And it is possible now that a section be made on this type, and on the remaining flesh; and it is, as to sever the skin of the testicles.
Then extend the egg upwards, and pull it out with a white sifach: and free the suspensorium from the vessels, and tie the vessels; and cut the suspensorium after you have freed it from every part of the egg's parts.
If therefore the egg is consolidated with those born flesh, then it is necessary that you pull the egg and cut it. And if there is an adhesion between something of the siphaket, or in that which is between the vessels, then it is necessary that you free the whole adhesion and cut it with a circular incision.
If however there is a birth of flesh in the place of adhesion which is behind, then it is necessary that you cut the whole of it and extract the egg, as we have said. When therefore your operation is complete, then fill the wound with wool infused in rose oil and wine; then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it is healed.
Concerning the treatment of Ramicis, which is with the Vite.
Chapter LXIV.
Vitis is an abscess enclosed in a certain covering, similar to a bunch of grapes, with a softening of the testicles: and it causes difficulty in movement and exercise, and walking, for the afflicted.
And in the treatment of this illness there is fear, because of that which preceded its remembrance.
But it is necessary, as we say, to perform the operation on it according to what the first ones did. Therefore I say that it is necessary to have the sick person sit on a raised seat.
Then cut with a broad, sharp spatula in a transverse section directly across the vessels, until the vessels are exposed.
Then scrape away from every side, as we told you in the extraction of the arteries that are in the temples.
Then cut it in the middle, in a straight section along the length of the body, and remove that which aggregates from putrid, foul humors.
Then treat the wound with the treatment of other wounds, in which the force of producing pus, so that the vessels that nourish one testicle may fall.
For there is no evil through it.
However, if all vessels in the veins occur, then it is necessary that the testicles be extracted along with the vessels, so that the egg is not deprived of nourishment due to the incision, and it wastes away, or dries up, and there is no benefit with them.
Concerning the treatment of intestinal colic. Chapter LXV.
Why do the intestines descend from that rupture to one testicle.
And this rupture is either from the sifach, or from its extension.
And these two types occur from many causes: either from a blow, or a jump, or a shout, or the lifting of a heavy object, and similar things.
And the sign, when it is from the extension of the sifach.
It is that which happens gradually over a long time, and does not happen suddenly: and it is an abscess equal towards the depth; because the sifach compresses the intestine.
And the sign of it, when it is from the section of the sifach, because it causes a very severe pain to occur immediately at its beginning; and the abscess is different, appearing beneath the skin nearby; and that is because of the exit of the intestine, and its course towards the exterior of the sifach.
And sometimes it emerges with the intestine, a zirb; and this is called a intestinal ramex and zirbia; and sometimes it happens with flatulence.
And sometimes faeces run into the intestine and are retained there; and it is a harm to the sick person, because it causes a mild pain, and especially when pressed.
And in the treatment of these kinds of illnesses, there is fear with iron; therefore, one must be cautious in its use.
And the method of operation is that you should instruct the sick person to draw back the intestine with their hand into the inner cavity if it obeys the withdrawal.
Then let him lie on his back with his neck between your hands, and raise his legs.
Then stretch the skin that follows the skin upwards, and cut the skin of the testicles completely along its length.
Then insert hooks into the two lips of the incision, according to what you need to open the incision with them; and let the incision be, as much as possible, so that an egg can emerge from it.
Then scrape off the siphak and what is beneath the skin of the testicles, until when the white, hard siphak is exposed on all sides; then insert your index finger into that which follows the testicle, into that which is between the white siphak, which is beneath the skin of the egg, and the second siphak, and break off with it the adhesion that is on the posterior part of the egg.
Then move the skin of the testicles inwards with your right hand; and with this, stretch the white siphak upwards with your left hand; and lift the egg with the siphak towards the incision; and command the assistant to stretch the egg upwards; and you break off the adhesion that is behind the complete separation.
And examine with your fingers that there is nothing there of the intestine wrapped in the hard white siphak.
If however you find anything of it: then push it towards the lower belly.
Then take a needle with a thick thread, made of linen from ten threads; and insert it at the last siphak, that is, the tunic, which is under the skin of the testicles that follows the incision; then cut the ends which project from the thread, until there are four threads.
Then arrange some of them over some others with a figure which is in the manner of a cross; and tie them with the alsifach, of which we have spoken, because it is under the skin of the testicles, with a violent ligature, until no vessel which nourishes them can send anything to them; so that a hot abscess does not occur from this.
And place another ligature again outside the first ligature, distant from it by no more than two fingers.
And after these two ligatures, leave out from the sifach, which is under the skin of the testicles, a quantity of the size of a finger; and cut the rest completely around, and remove the egg from it.
Then cut into the lower part of the skin of the testicles, with the incision from which blood and pus run, as we have narrated in that which has gone before.
Then apply wool soaked in oil, and place it in the wound; and apply the ligature which we have narrated.
And sometimes the white sifach which we mentioned is cauterized, after its incision, fearing blood flow.
For this happens many times.
And leave the ligature until it falls away by itself.
If, however, its falling is delayed, then it should be soaked with warm water; and place upon it that which we mentioned, until it falls away.
Then treat the wound with the rest of the treatment for wounds, until it is healed.
About the windy rupture.
Chapter LXVI.
In this rupture, I have not seen anyone who dared to use iron for its treatment.
And indeed the first ones said that it happens as we have described in the rupture that is with the vine.
That is, to tie the vessels after the incision, on them, with ease, below; then cut in the middle, and finally treat with that which opens it, until the vessels fall away; and treat the wound, as we said, until it is healed.
Of the rupture that occurs in the groins.
Chapter LXVII.
When rupture occurs in the inguinal region, as we have said, and the area protrudes, and nothing from the intestines descends to the testicles; and if something does descend, it is little, and returns at all hours; but if time passes with it, a fissure is added to the scrotum, until the intestines descend into the scrotum.
And that occurs from the stretching of the scrotum, which is in the inguinal region, as we have said.
That is, because the scrotum stretches; then the area softens, and the place becomes suppurative, and protrudes.
And its treatment is with a cautery, as its preceding account stated.
And sometimes it is treated with an iron, according to this method: and it is so that the sick person lies on their back between your hands.
Then cut the suppurated and protruding place of the rupture, by a cut across its width, according to the quantity of three fingers.
Then tighten the scrotum and what is under the skin, until when the white scrotum is exposed, which is under the skin that follows it.
Then take a rod, and place it over the protruding place from the scrotum, and press it to the depth of the belly.
Then sew the two protruding places on the end of the rod from the scrotum, and connect one of them with the other with a suture; then withdraw the end of the rod.
And do not cut the scrotum at all, nor stretch the egg, nor anything else, as I have made you know in the treatment of intestinal hernia. Then treat it with the treatment of wounds.
When therefore you cut the threads, cleanse it, and restore the wound, until it is consolidated.
For the scrotum contracts, and the protrusion of the rupture is not added.
And cautery is better in this place, because it is closer to health.
Of the softening of the skin of the testicles.
Chapter LXVIII.
Many times the skin of the testicles in some men is softened, for which reason the flesh which is between them is softened, and its appearance is made foul.
Therefore it is necessary for him who is asked for treatment of it, that he place the sick man on his back, and cut away all the skin that has been softened from the natural skin. Then he shall unite the two lips with sutures: and if you wish, sew first the excess softened skin with three or four sutures, and make the sutures firm.
Then treat the remaining wounds with care, until they are healed, and the threads fall out.
Concerning Castration.
Chapter LXIX.
Know that castration is excommunicated in our law; and because of that, it would be permissible for me not to mention it in this book of mine; and its mention is not necessary except for two methods.
One of which is that it should be in the knowledge of the physician when questioned about it, and so that he may know its treatment for the one who has experienced it.
And the other method is that we often need the castration of certain animals, for our benefit through it, such as rams, boars, and cats, and similar animals.
Therefore, I say that castration is done in two ways. Or by attrition.
Or by fissure and section.
In that which is done by attrition, the method of operation is this: that we make the animal sit in warm water until its testicles are softened and relaxed, and hang down; then rub them with your hand until they are dissolved and no longer appear under the touch.
In castration by fissure and section, it is necessary that you hold the animal and press the skin of its testicles with your left hand.
And this method of castration is better than that which is done by attrition, because attrition perhaps leaves some of the testicles, wherefore the animal desires intercourse.
Then treat the wound until it heals.
Concerning the treatment of a hermaphrodite, there are two methods.
Chapter 70.
A hermaphrodite is from men in two ways.
One of them is that there appears in it, in the space below, or in the skin of the testicles, in the area between the two testicles, a figure like a woman's vulva, with hairs; and sometimes urine flows from what is in the skin of the testicles.
In women, however, there is one form, and it is a woman's vulva on top of the pubis, like very small male testicles protruding outward; one of which is like a man's penis, and two like two testicles.
And the treatment of three types, two from men and one from women, is: because it is necessary to cut away the added flesh until their impression disappears.
Then treat them as with other wounds.
In the second type, however, of men, from which urine emerges, which is in the skin of the testicles, there is no operation, nor is there any treatment at all.
Concerning the incision of the vulvar swelling, and of the protruding flesh in women's vulvas.
Chapter LXXI.
A swelling may perhaps be added to the natural structure, until it becomes disfigured and unsightly in appearance; and sometimes it becomes so large in some women that it expands like that in men and reaches the point of intercourse.
Therefore, it is necessary to hold the excess swelling with your hand, or with a hook, and to cut it; and do not be extreme in the incision, especially in the deep root, so that a flow of blood does not occur.
Then treat it with the treatment for wounds, until it heals.
However, the flesh that grows is flesh that arises in the orifice of the womb, until it fills it; and perhaps it protrudes outwards in the likeness of a tail; and because of that, some of the ancients called the illness "tailed.
Therefore, it is necessary to cut it, as we cut the swelling, and to treat it until it heals.
Concerning the treatment of Alratica, which is a non-perforated woman's vagina.
Chapter LXXII.
Alratica is, as it were, a woman's vagina that is not perforated, or has a small opening.
And it is either natural or accidental.
Accidental is from an illness that preceded: and indeed it comes about either from added flesh growth, or from subtle, or thick syrups: and it comes about either deep within the womb, or on its sides, or at its upper, or lower part: and it hinders intercourse and impregnation, and childbirth, and perhaps hinders menstruation.
And knowledge of it is made through the observation of the midwife, if an apparent obstruction is near.
If however it is not apparent, then seek it with your fingers, or with a rod.
If however the obstruction is from a thin syrup, and is near the two lips, then hurry, and break it apart.
And it is, that you place pads upon the two lips.
Then place your index fingers of both hands together, and let the woman be on her back with her legs spread.
Then spread the two lips with strength, until the thin syrup is broken, and the obstruction is opened.
Then take wool, and soak it in oil, and place it over the place; and let the woman apply it every day, so that the place is not consolidated again.
If however the syrup is thick, dense: then it is necessary to cut it with a broad spatula similar to a myrtle leaf.
If however the obstruction is born of flesh, then suspend it with hooks, and cut it; and have with you medicines that soothe the flow of blood without causing a mordication, such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and frankincense mixed with the white of an egg.
Then administer a wide lead cannula, so that the wound does not heal quickly, hold it for a few days; and administer a bandage of dry linen, then treat the rest with further treatment until it is healed.
And sometimes there arises in the womb a birth of other flesh; it is therefore necessary that they be cut in this way: while it is not a cancerous abscess; for a cancerous abscess that is in the womb, there should be no opposition with iron at all.
Concerning the treatment of hemorrhoids, Athehelil, and Bothor rubeae in women's vulvas.
Chapter LXXIII.
Hemorrhoids indeed are an opening of the veins, until much blood flows from them continually.
Therefore, when hemorrhoids become chronic, they become thelil: and I have already stated their species and their signs in the division; and I will say here which of them receive a cure, and which do not.
Therefore, I say that hemorrhoids which are in the orifice of the womb, and do not appear to the senses, then there is no cure with iron for them.
However, those of them which are in the orifice of the womb over which the senses fall, are those that are cured.
Therefore, it is necessary to put the woman in a cool house.
Then extend the thelil with shears, or with a rough cloth, and cut them from their roots.
Then powder over them, at the flow of blood, from one of the powders of the incisions without mordication, such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and frankincense, and similar to them.
Then let her feet be pressed against the wall for one hour.
Afterwards, place her in cold water.
If the flow of blood persists, then make her sit in a decoction of sumac, and pomegranate bark, and gallnuts, and similar things.
Then take barley flour, and mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a plaster with it on her back.
If the blood is thus cut off with it, it is good; and if not, apply cupping glasses to the back and nipples, without scarification.
Then take wool and immerse it in the juice of tarathit, or the juice of arnoglossa, or the juice of alaulat branches, that is, aglanter, Pontic wine, and apply it to the sore.
When the abscess rests, then treat the area with ointments until it is healed.
Albarth, however, is red, similar to the heads of alhaasse, and is of harsh appearance.
Therefore, it is necessary to incise what appears from it, according to what I said in the thelil equally, and treat it until it is healed.
Concerning the perforation of the exit of the womb.
Chapter LXXIV.
Many types of abscesses occur in the womb, such as cancer, and stony abscess, and ulcers, and adubelati, and alekilati, that is, herpes, boils, and fistulas, and hemorrhoids, and fissures, and thelil, and hot abscess.
And I have already discussed all these illnesses and their types, and their signs, and their cures in the division: it is necessary to discuss in this treatise the hot abscess which occurs in the womb, when it is from the abscesses that collect pus, and you wish to know how its opening is done with iron.
Therefore, it is necessary to consider.
Then if the pain of the abscess in its inception is sharp with its percussion, and heat, and fever: and you see it reddening: if sensitivity falls upon it, then do not hurry with its perforation: and treat it with that which aids maturation, until when the sharpness of the symptoms subsides.
Then it is necessary that you make the woman sit on a seat that slants two seats, and lean back, or be placed upon her back, and draw her feet to the lower part of the belly: and let her thighs be spread out, and let her place her arms under her knees, and tie each with a suitable bandage to it.
Then let the midwife sit on the right side, and administer the instrument with which the opening of the womb is made.
Whose form comes in those that are behind.
And it is necessary, when you wish to administer this instrument, that you probe deeply into the womb of the woman: so that that which enters from the instrument be no more than the depth of the womb, and hurt the delicate one.
If, however, the instrument be more than the depth, then it is necessary that you place cushions on the covering of the womb's depth: so that the entire entrance of the instrument into the depth of the womb may be prevented: and it is necessary that it place the turning which runs on the instrument, from the upper side: and that the attendant hold the instrument, and that the attendant turn the turning, until the depth of the womb be opened.
When therefore the exit appears, and it is touched by hand, and is smooth and soft, then it is necessary to separate it at its head with a broad spatula.
When therefore the pus is evacuated, then it is necessary that you place on the wound a linen cloth soaked in rose oil, or green oil, in which there is some astringency: and place the cloth, and extract the section into the depth of the womb.
And place externally upon the womb, and upon the vulva, clean wool soaked in water in which mulberries have been boiled.
Then treat it after two days with the ointment that is suitable for it, until it is healed.
And sometimes the womb and wound are washed, so that it is injected with water and honey: then with water in which the lily root, or long aristolochia, has been boiled: then return to the ointment.
If the wound is hidden inwardly in the womb, then it is necessary that you refrain from treating it with iron, rather treat it with what we have said in the division.
On the teachings of midwives, how living embryos, born in a non-natural form, are treated.
Chapter LXX.
It is necessary for the midwife to know, first of all, the form of natural birth.
Therefore, among its signs is that when you see a woman pressing downwards, and desiring to smell the air, and relief is upon her from the burden of childbirth, and the embryo's exit is hastened: then know that this birth is in a natural form, and its exit is upon its head, and the afterbirth with it: either hanging or suspended from the navel. Therefore, when you see these signs, then it is necessary that her abdomen be pressed, so that the embryo descends quickly.
Any birth other than this one is unnatural, blameworthy.
For sometimes the fetus emerges upon its feet, and its body emerges before its head, and its feet, and one of its hands, or one of its feet: or its head and one of its hands emerge: or its abdomen emerges: and perhaps it is turned over upon its neck, and similar examples of blameworthy forms.
Therefore, it is necessary for the midwife to be prudent, astute in all these matters, and to guard herself against error and deception: and I am showing every form from them, and how the nature is within it, and how it is signified by it, and how one should act upon it.
When the fetus emerges upon its head in its natural expulsion, and it becomes difficult for the woman, and the birth becomes difficult for her, and you see that her strength is already weakened: then have her sit upon a seat, or let women hold her: and apply vapors to her vulva with decoction of fenugreek and with moist oils.
Then let the midwife insert a small spatula between her fingers, and with it split the afterbirth, and cut it with her fingernail, until that which is in it from moisture runs out: and press the woman's abdomen until the fetus descends.
If, however, it does not descend, then it is necessary for the woman to be given an enema of fenugreek mucilage with sesame oil.
Then order her, after the enema, to compress herself; and make her sneeze with condiments, and hold her mouth and nose for one hour.
For the fetus will emerge immediately.
If two hands of the fetus emerge first, you should gently and gradually draw them back.
If, however, it does not yield in its entry, then place the woman on a stool, and raise her feet upwards; then shake the stool on the ground; and the woman is to be held so that she does not fall during the shaking.
If therefore the hands do not emerge, and the fetus dies, then cut them and extract the remainder of the fetus; and tie its hand with cloth, and extract it with equanimity; for it will emerge.
The exit of the embryo is upon its feet.
When the fetus emerges on its feet, then it is necessary to push them upwards; then turn the fetus gradually; afterward, straighten it.
Then take one of its feet, and extend it gradually.
When therefore they emerge up to the hips, then command him to be pressed, and make him sneeze with concoction; for it will emerge, if God wills.
And if it does not emerge with what we have described, then return the fetus gradually until you place it in its natural form.
For it will then emerge with easy exit.
If it is hindered with all that we have described, then take from marshmallow mucilage, and sesame oil, and dissolved gum: and pound all in a mortar with good pounding; then line with it the woman's vulva, and the lower part of her abdomen.
Then make her sit in warm water, until it reaches the hypochondria.
When therefore you see that her lower parts are now warmed, then make her a poultice of myrrh, and apply it.
When therefore the poultice has held for one hour, then make her sit upon a seat.
Then make her sneeze, and bind her mouth and nose, and press the lower part of her abdomen with gentle pressure.
For the foetus will depart immediately.
The exit of the foetus is upon the knees and hands.
When it emerges according to this form, then gently introduce her hands into it.
Then the woman shall lie upon her back, and her feet shall hang downward; and she shall lie upon the bed, and fold her hands.
Then press gently upon her abdomen.
Then pull out that which is under her feet from the pillows, until it is prepared at the lower part.
If the fetus does not emerge, then take her feet and move them with a forceful motion.
Then press gently on that which is above the hypochondria, until the fetus rises upwards.
Then let her insert her hands, and gently straighten the fetus; and command the woman to bear down, until the fetus emerges.
The exit of the fetus, hanging sideways from the hands.
Let his hand be inserted into the reduction.
If however he cannot reduce it, then lift the woman, and make her walk.
If however she cannot walk, then make her lie down on the bed: and shake her legs with a violent shaking.
Then administer the liniment that you have prepared from mucilages.
If however she receives it in childbirth, then make her sit on a seat.
Then strive in the reduction of the hand, and set the fetus according to its natural form: and make the woman sneeze, and command her to compress herself until it emerges.
The exit of the fetus is upon its neck, with outstretched hands, and its face is toward the back of its mother.
The midwife should hold the hand of the fetus, then gradually turn it around, and adjust it with ease.
When therefore it is adjusted, then place upon its vulva what we have narrated of oil and mucilages.
Then command her to move slowly.
When you have done that, then make her sit upon a seat, and command her to incline to her right side.
Then command her to compress herself; and make her sneeze with seasonings.
The exit of the prepared fetus upon its side.
When it descends to the orifice of the womb in this manner with the afterbirth, then cleave the afterbirth with your nail, until it is evacuated from the moisture.
If therefore it hangs over the face of the fetus, and its neck, then cut it from the navel: so that it may not be retained, and die.
Then urge the fetus inwards, until you place it as it should be; and command the woman to compress herself several times; for it will emerge through a gentle exit.
The exit of twins, or many fetuses.
Know that twins are often born, and sometimes three and four are born.
However, that is unusual and rarely happens.
However, five is unnatural, and they do not entirely live: and though they multiply, they are contained by one placenta; and they are separated by a sort of partition, distinguishing between them, tied to the umbilical cord of each.
And sometimes they emerge like a single fetus emerges with a natural, easy exit; and they emerge with an unpraised exit, as we have recounted. If some of them are difficult at birth, and reach the unnatural forms we have mentioned, then treat them as we have recounted; and let the midwife be skillful, and do what she does with ease and slowness, and devise a strategy according to every form with what is prepared for her from a leading skill towards health.
Sometimes one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and more than ten are formed in the womb; and it has already been verified with me that a woman miscarried seven, and another fifteen, all formed.
That which was done by the measurement of the glorious wise man.
Therefore, all this must be in the knowledge of the midwife. Perhaps something similar to that will come to her; therefore, let her oppose it with what is necessary.
Concerning the extraction of a dead fetus.
When you treat a dead fetus with what I have said in the division from medication, and it does not emerge, and you are forced to use an operation with your hand, then you must consider.
If therefore the woman is of sound constitution, and is not afflicted with any of the accidents from which harm to her is feared, then it is necessary that the woman be laid supine on a bed, on her back, and her head be lowered, and her legs raised; and the attendant should hold her from both sides, or she should be bound to the bed, so that her body is not disturbed during the extraction of the fetus.
Then moisten the os uteri with humid oils, along with the mucilage of marshmallow, fenugreek, and flaxseed. Then the midwife should anoint her hand with these oils and mucilages; then she should gently insert it into the uterus.
Then she should seek, with it, the place where she should fix the hooks from the fetus, and the suitable places for that.
Therefore, consider then, if the fetus is ready to descend with its head: then fix the hooks in its eyes, or in its neck, or in its mouth, or in its palate, or under its chin, or in its fork, or in places close to the ribs, and beneath the hypochondria.
If however the descent is upon its feet, then in its pubic bone and its middle ribs.
And it is necessary that she hold the hook with her right hand; and place its curve in the space between the fingers of her left hand; and she should insert it with her hand gently, and fix the hook in any of those places we have mentioned, until she reaches the empty space.
Then let it be extended with equal extension, and let the extension not be only in a straight line, but rather move in every direction, so that its exit is eased; just as happens with a tooth during its extraction.
And it is necessary in that which is between it, that the extension be softened.
If a part of it remains, then the midwife should anoint some fingers with oil and insert them on the side, to turn around with them what remains.
If therefore a part of the fetus emerges, then the hooks should be moved to another place, which is higher; do this until the entire fetus emerges.
If therefore a hand emerges before the other parts, and it is not possible to return it, due to its constriction, then it is necessary that a cloth be wrapped around it.
Then pull it out until, when the whole emerges, cut it either at the ankle joint or at the elbow; and thus it is necessary that you do for the other hand, and for the two feet.
If however the fetus's head is large, or constriction happens to it in its exit, or water is collected in its head, then it is necessary to insert a spiny Spatumile between the fingers and split the head with it, and remove the water; or break it with the instrument called Almisdac, the shape of which is found with the shapes of the other instruments in the chapter that is after this one.
Similarly, he should do this if the fetus is of a large-headed nature, then it is necessary to separate it with algengematu; or extract it with misdach, as we have said.
Then pull the bones with forceps.
If the head emerges, and is constricted at the fork, then it is to be split, until the moisture that is in the chest is poured out.
If however it does not become entangled, nor yields to exit, then cut the head into pieces, as much as possible for you.
If the lower part of the abdomen is ulcerated, or has dropsy in it, then it is necessary to pierce it, until moisture flows from it.
If however the fetus is over its feet, then its extraction is easy, and its direction to the mouth of the womb is slight.
If however it is constricted at the belly, or chest, then it is necessary to extract it with a cloth which you have wrapped around your hand: and split the belly, or chest, until that which is within them flows out.
If however the remaining limbs are removed, and the head returns, then the Midwife should insert her left hand. If therefore the mouth of the womb is open, then she should insert her hand deep into the womb, and search with it for the head, and pull it with her fingers until it reaches the mouth of the womb; then she should insert one hook, or two hooks, into it, and pull it with that.
If however the mouth of the womb is constricted, on account of a hot abscess which has occurred in it, then it is not necessary to labor upon it, but it is necessary then to administer the effusion of moist, fatty things, and apply plasters; and she should sit in waters that soften and moisten.
If the fetus is on its side, then it is possible to make it straight; then administer what we have said about a living fetus.
If this is not possible, then it should be cut into pieces and extracted.
And it is necessary that you not leave anything of the afterbirth inside at all.
When therefore you have completed your operation, then administer what we have said about hot abscesses that occur in the wombs.
If a flow of blood occurs, then let it descend into astringent waters, and administer the rest of the treatment.
And indeed I have already seen a woman, in whose belly a foetus had died; then she became pregnant again over it, afterwards another foetus also died.
Therefore, after a long time, an abscess occurred in her navel, and it swelled until it opened, and it began to discharge pus.
Therefore, I was called to treat her, and I treated her for a long time, and the wound did not heal.
Therefore, I placed over it certain plasters of strong attraction, and a bone came out of the place.
Then a few days passed, and another bone came out.
Therefore, I was amazed by this, since there is no bone in the belly.
Therefore, I thought that they were from the bones of a dead fetus.
Then I investigated the wound, and removed many bones, the woman being in better condition: and she thus lived a long time, and discharged a little pus from the place.
And I did not consider this extraneous, except because it contains knowledge and help for what the skilled physician administers with his hand in the treatment.
Concerning the forms of necessary instruments in the extraction of a fetus.
Chapter LXXVII.
Here below is the form of a stretcher, by which books are equalized, with two pivots equally placed at the two ends of two pieces of wood.
However, this pivot should be finer than the stretcher, and to make it, either from ebony or from boxwood.
And the width of each piece of wood should be about two fingers, and the margin of each of them is about one finger, and the length of each of them is a palm and a half; and in the middle of the two pieces of wood are two additions of the same kind of wood, which are already fixed on both sides, whose length is half a palm and a little more; and the width of each is about two fingers, or a little more.
And these two additions are inserted into the opening of the matrix, so that it opens with them when you turn the two pivots.
The form of the pivot by which the matrix is opened.
Another form similar to it, finer and lighter.
Let it be made of ebony wood, or boxwood, according to the likeness of forceps.
However, at its end there are two additions, as you see here above: and the length of each of these additions is approximately a palm: and the width of each is two fingers.
Therefore, when you wish to open the matrix with it, then make the woman sit on a bed, with her feet hanging down, opening what is between her legs.
Then introduce these two joined additions into the matrix: and you are holding the lower end of the instrument between her thighs.
Then open your hand with the instrument, as you do with scissors, equally according to the amount you wish to open the mouth of the matrix, until the midwife does what she wants.
Another form of Vertigo, which the ancients called the Impelling Form, by which the fetus is impelled.
The Almisdac form by which the small head is crushed. The form of a hook with one spine.
The form of a hook with two spines.
The form of forceps with saw-like teeth, with which the fetus's head is crushed.
The form of a scalpel with two ends for severing the head.
The form of two broad scalpels.
All these instruments are used, and the more their types multiply, and are prepared by the craftsman, the more swift is his operation, and the higher is he regarded by men, because of their number.
Therefore, do not disdain any instrument, lest it not be prepared with you.
For their necessity is inexcusable.
Concerning the extraction of the Secundine.
Chapter LXXVIII.
When the Secundine is retained during childbirth, then it is necessary that you instruct the woman to hold her breath.
Then make her sneeze with condiments: and grasp your hand over her mouth and nostrils.
If therefore it emerges through this, it is good.
If not, then take a pot, and pierce a hole in the lid: and place in it herbs that open the mother's mouth, such as calamint, rue, dill, chamomile, sseham, cassia wood, and centaury: take all these herbs, or some of them, and immerse them in water, and place them on the fire.
Then place a reed stopper over the hole of the pot's lid, and the other end in the woman's womb: and hold it until the vapor reaches the cavity of the womb.
Then make her sneeze, as we said.
For the afterbirth will emerge with ease.
If however it remains after this treatment, and does not emerge: then order the midwife to immerse her hand in sesame oil, or marshmallow mucilage. Then let her introduce it into the vagina, and seek the afterbirth with it.
When therefore she finds it, then let her take it and extend it gradually.
If however it be attached deep within the womb, then let her introduce her hand, as we have described, until, when she finds the afterbirth, she extracts it gradually in a straight line, so that the womb does not fall away with a sudden pull; rather, it ought to be moved easily to the right and left sides, then an amount of traction should be added.
For it then obeys, and is preserved, and escapes from adhesion.
If the os of the womb is constricted, as we have already described: treat it with sneezing, and with a medication of a pot with herbs.
If however it does not emerge with all that we have described, then beware lest you tire yourself in repeating the extraction.
But it is necessary that whatever emerges from it to the os of the womb be tied to the woman's hip.
Then administer a clyster to her with the tetrapharmacon ointment.
For this will indeed putrefy it after days, and it will dissolve and emerge.
However, when it putrefies, a foul odor rises from it to the stomach and head, and harms the weak one.
Therefore, suitable fumigations must be administered to it.
Some of the ancients have already experienced fumigation with nasturtium and dried figs.
The form of the instrument by which a woman is fumigated during the retention of the Secundinae and menses.
Let it be made of glass similar to a flask, or of bronze: and let the wide end be placed over the fire: and let the fumigation be placed over the prunes: let it hold it, until that fumigation is consumed: and again another.
Concerning the treatment of an unopened anus.
Chapter LXXIX.
Many children are born with their anuses not perforated, which are already obstructed by a thin sifac.
Therefore, the midwife must perforate that sifac with her finger; and if not, let her perforate it with a sharp Spatumili; and let her be careful not to touch the flesh.
Then place upon it wool soaked in wine and oil.
Then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
If however you fear that it will become obstructed, then place a lead cannula in the opening for many days, and let it be removed when the child wishes to evacuate.
And now obstruction of the anus also happens from the consolidation of a wound, or an abscess.
Therefore, it is necessary to cut that consolidation, then treat it with what we have said concerning treatment and lead. Concerning the treatment of fistulas which occur in the lower part.
Chapter Eighty.
Fistulas which occur in the lower part are swellings and thicknesses which occur near the anus externally; or in the space of one part; and it is one fistula or several.
When that swelling has become longstanding, it opens, and watery white moisture or thin pus flows from it.
And sometimes there are penetrating fistulas from these.
And some of those fistulas, when they are penetrating, are in the space reaching to the bladder and to the urethra.
And some of them are penetrating to the hip joint and to the tail bone.
By this, a penetrating fistula to the anus is recognized, even from one that is not penetrating, that you insert your index finger into the anus, and insert a thin probe into the fistula through the air, or iron, when there is no twisting.
If there is twisting in it, then insert into it a thin lead probe, or a horsehair, until you feel the probe, or hair, in your finger.
If you do not feel it completely, nor does anything emerge from the opening in terms of excretion, nor wind, nor worm as I said, then know that it is not penetrating: therefore, hasten to the treatment.
And when the fistula is penetrating to the bladder, or to the urinary meatus, then its sign is the excretion of urine from it, and its prevention from this that the place be consolidated with medicines.
However, if it is penetrating to the hip joint, or to the hip bone, then its sign is that the probe reaches there, if there is no twisting in it to the bone, and the finding of pain in the surrounding area, and that pus emerges from it always, and that treatment does not work in it, nor is it consolidated with ointment.
And in all these penetrating fistulas, there is no cure at all; and their treatment is labor and vanity to him, from foolish physicians, upon whom it is formed. However, in the one that is not penetrating, and not ancient, healing is hoped for with a saw, according to what I tell you, and what I have already tested: and it is so that the sick person lies between your hands on his back, and raise his legs above his hips, and his hips are inclined to his stomach.
Then introduce a lead or copper probe, if there is twisting in the fistula, until you know where the probe reaches.
If, however, the patient feels it around the anus, then it is necessary that you insert your index finger into the anus.
If, therefore, you feel the probe already to have penetrated itself detected, beyond what you feel between your finger and the fistula, or flesh: then you know certainly that it is penetrating: therefore, do not labour on it, for there is no cure of it, as we have said.
They have said, however, that in some men the flesh heals, and that from the medicine by which help is hoped for it is to apply a thin cautery according to the size of the fistula, as previously mentioned, and to insert it heated into the fistula, until it reaches around the anus.
Then repeat it twice or three times, until you know that all those added, filtered flesh, which are like bird's feather quills, have been burned.
Then treat it with lint wrapped in butter, until those burned flesh parts come out; then treat it with ointments that generate flesh and consolidate it.
If, therefore, it heals, it is good.
And if not, then it will never heal with any other treatment.
And if a probe emerges, and it has not reached your finger in the anus, and there is a thick layer of flesh between it and the probe, or if such is the case: and you see a fistula in that which follows the skin's surface, then cut the skin from the beginning of the fistula, and you go on cutting with the probe which is in the fistula, until the incision reaches where the probe's tip reaches, and the probe is released and falls out.
Then cleanse those filtered flesh, which resemble the quill of a bird, so that nothing remains of them.
However, if blood overcomes you, and separates you from your operation so that you cut those flesh: then it is better, and more quickly helpful, to cauterize it with fire, or with a sharp medicine.
Because cautery with fire aggregates good habits, by burning those added flesh, and by cutting off the blood, and drying the moisture.
Then treat it with bandages wrapped in butter, or pounded herbs, until the area discharges pus, and those burnt flesh emerge in the pus.
Then treat the wound with solidifying ointments, which produce firm flesh: and there are medicines in which there is astringency and drying.
For when it is restored, then it is already healed: and you do not fear repetition. If however the fistula has already reached the depth of the anus, and is extended by bodily superfluity: then introduce your finger into the anus, and investigate with it.
If therefore you feel a membrane, and between you and it is a veil of sifac, or flesh, and it is near to penetration: then there is no operation on it, unless according to the path of trust and hope.
For this is because one of three methods is administered in it: either to cauterize it itself, as we said: or to dissect it, until you obtain its concavity, so that it is possible for you to insert ligatures, and healing from close proximity.
And do not proceed too far with the dissection, so that you do not cut the muscle surrounding the anus, and that a spontaneous expulsion of excrement occurs without the patient's will. Then treat it with what we said. For perhaps it will be healed: or you will lengthen the membrane, and cleanse it after you have cut it close to the anus, as we said, either with tongs, or with another instrument of sharp end.
Then cleanse those filtered flesh that are in the incision, until where you can with scrutiny.
Then attempt the restoration of the entire wound with the incision, and the upper opening where it consolidates; and a fistula remains open in the interior part of the anus, and it will be easier on the patient.
And sometimes the fistula is sutured in this way: and it is when you insert a probe into the fistula; and it is in the side of the anus near the body's surface with the skin and the margin of the anus; then take a probe with a perforated end, which is like a needle for preparing hides, according to this form.
And insert into it a thread wrapped in five threads, and about it.
Then insert the probe with the thread into the fistula until it reaches its concavity.
If, therefore, it is penetrating the inner margin of the anus nearby, then pull the thread out of that opening: so that you insert your finger into the anus, and pull out the end of the thread, and join the two ends together; and tie each, and leave it for one or two days; and the more the thread cuts into the flesh, the better tie it, until those flesh which are between the two ends of the thread are cut and fall away; then treat the wound until it consolidates and heals.
For it is not in you to do that on account of the muscle, so as not to injure it.
Then do with it as we have said, until it is healed.
A pointed spatula, by which the fistula is split, whose curvature is very sharp, and the other part is not sharp, so that it does not injure what is not necessary, as you see.
Concerning the suture of hemorrhoids, from which blood flows from their incision: and the treatment of fissures.
Chapter LXXXI.
Hemorrhoids are of two types.
Either they are within the anus, like bags of coal or prunes, or like bunches of grapes themselves.
And of them there are small and large ones; and blood flows from them always, and there is one, and there are many.
And some are outside the anus, and at its extremities.
However, those that are outside the anus are mostly small moist lumps, from which flows yellowish water or little blood with persistent running; and they are according to the color of the body.
And the treatment of that which is within the anus is that you command the sick person to strain: and it is expressed until it emerges from the anus, and you see the atheril for yourself.
Therefore, also suspend them with hooks, or hold them with your fingernail.
Then cut them at their roots.
However, if the hooks do not hold on them, because of their moisture and their softening, then take them with a rough cloth, or with a double-wool cloth, and pull them out with your fingers.
Then cut them, and after the incision, powder over them certain hot powders, so that they may stand in the place of a cautery.
Or cauterize them according to what went before in the chapter on cauterization.
Then treat them with the rest of the treatment, until they are healed.
If the anus does not yield to evacuation, then administer an enema to the sick person containing a small mordicant, so that it may wash away what is in the anus and quickly yield to evacuation when the sick person expels it.
If, however, the piles are external from the anus, then their removal is easy: and it is that you take them with your fingernail, or take them with a hook, and cut them.
Then treat them with what we have said, until they are healed.
And whoever abhors incision with iron, then it is necessary that you administer their suture in this way.
Take a wrapped thread, and insert it into the needle.
Then pull the piles upwards, and make it pierce with the needle at its root on the other side: and wrap the two ends of the thread, at the lower part of the needle, and let them be laterally: and tighten the piles with strong constriction.
Then tie the thread, and remove the needle.
Do that with all the piles, and leave one of them: and do not sew it, so that superfluity of blood runs from it.
Then place over the anus a cloth soaked in rose-oil, or in oil of caper, and place it over the anus: and order the sick person to rest.
Then leave it until it falls.
When therefore the piles fall, treat them with ointments and other treatment until they are healed.
Concerning the treatment of Fissures.
For they often occur from the drying out of excrement and constriction of the nature.
When therefore they become old, and medicine does not work on them, then it is necessary to scrape them with a pointed spatula, or with your fingernail, until they become moist, and the upper crust which prevents their healing is removed.
Then treat them until they heal as is proper.
If however they do not heal, then scrape them again with a more forceful scraping than the first, until they bleed a lot and are scraped off; then treat them until they heal.
Concerning the treatment of inverted and non-inverted almirmar, and of dry athelil and formicae.
Then treat it; and if you wish, cauterize it according to what preceded in its chapter.
From dry athelil, however, one is a small, rough, filtered, round eminence above the surface of the body.
And many times they occur on the hands of children.
And its treatment is to stretch the athelil, and cut it; or to bind it with a silk thread; or with a bristle, until it falls.
And if you wish, cauterize it according to what has been mentioned with fire, or with a sharp medicine; and now the inverted athelil are eradicated, and not the inverted ones with the instrument that I will name. A formica, however, is also a small, filtered, thick eminence above the surface of the body, going deep very much: and when cold finds it, a sensation similar to an ant's bite is felt in it, and it happens throughout the body; and most of it happens in the hands.
And its treatment is to take a cannula from a goose's feather, or a strong vulture's feather; and place that cannula over the Formica until the cannula's circle contains its parts.
Then turn your hand with the cannula, until you separate what is around the Formica; and place it in the depth of the flesh, and eradicate the Formica from its root. And if you wish, do it with a cannula of air, or iron, according to this form.
Let the upper part of the cannula be drawn to a height, so that the grasp of the deaf thing wrapped around it, and its turning, may be eased.
And if you wish, cauterize the Formica according to what is stated in the cauterization of Athelil in the chapter on the cautery.
Concerning the forms of instruments which are administered for enemas in diseases of the anus, and for loosening the belly, and for colic.
Chapter Eighty-three.
Sometimes the clyster is made of silver, or of brass, or of cast bronze, or of hammered bronze.
And sometimes it is made of these instruments small, and large, according to those in which they are administered.
Therefore, that which is administered in the treatment of very young children should be small; and those whose anuses are weak or painful, so too their enemas.
Large clyster.
Small clyster.
Its tube, that is, the upper end to which the bladder is tied, should be wide according to this method; and it should have a distinction so that the bladder may be tied as you see, and its lower end which is introduced into the anus should be closed, that is, not open, smooth, very, drawing to a point; and on one side of it there should be two holes, and on the other side one hole.
And the size of the hole should be according to the thickness of rays, and a little thicker; and let the bladder in which the medicines are placed be made from an animal's bladder, or from parchment, which should be according to the shape of a small asofrat; whose root should be one palm.
When therefore the bladder is placed in it, the head of the enema should be tied at the top between two distinguishing constrictions with a strong tie.
Then administer the enema with it.
And this is the form of the bladder depicted here, and the holes. The method of administering the enema with it is: to fill the bladder, or the vessel, with medicine that is warmed according to the patient's tolerance; and be careful that it is not excessively hot or excessively cold.
Then the sick person should lie on their back, and raise their legs upward; and place beneath them a mat, that is, a hide upon which people lie, or a linen cloth.
Then anoint the end of the clyster with oil, or with egg white, or with the mucilage of fenugreek, or similar things.
Then introduce it into the anus with ease.
Then let the attendant grasp the bladder with both hands together, and squeeze it with force, until all that is in the clyster is evacuated into the intestine. Then remove the clyster, and let the sick person raise their legs to the wall. If the medicine compels him to an outcome, then let him hold it as long as possible.
And if he sleeps with it the whole night, it is more beneficial in helping.
If, however, you administer the clyster in illnesses of the belly's loosening, and his exit is quick: then repeat the clyster until he is healed.
If there are hemorrhoids or ulcerating abscesses in the anus, then let the clyster be very thin, gentle, from the clysters with which children are administered clysters.
And this should be the form of a thin clyster above which there is tight skin.
Concerning the treatment of head wounds without fracture of the bone.
Chapter Eighty-four.
I have already spoken in the division of the treatment of wounds that it was fitting for the book, and I will speak here of their treatment with the hand and with medicines, according to the completion.
Therefore I say that wounds are diversified according to that by which the wounds are made, and according to the place upon which the wound falls.
The things by which wounds are made are often, as the throw of a stone; or the incision of a sword, or knife; or the striking with a lance, or wood, or arrow; and with similar things from many things.
And the wounds that are made according to the places of the body are, such as a wound that falls upon the head, or neck, or breast, or belly, or liver; and similar from those members.
And I am narrating the treatments of certain wounds, so as to place that reasoning and rule over the remaining wounds.
And I will begin with simple wounds of the head, because the remembrance of compounded ones will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
I say therefore.
When a simple wound occurs on the head, and there is no fracture of the bone: consider then, if it is from the throw of a stone, or similar things, and has only broken the skin: and is a large wound, and you fear a bad outcome of a hot abscess: then hurry, and immediately perform a cephalic phlebotomy: and do not delay it: and draw from his blood according to the quantity of his strength: if there is nothing preventing it by phlebotomy, especially if the blood that emerges from the wound is little.
And let the phlebotomy be on the opposite side of the wounded part.
And let the sick person beware of fullness, and wine, and heavy foods.
If, however, something prevents diminution, then lessen food and do not approach meats, nor wines.
And place on the wound, if a hot abscess occurs, a poultice infused in rose oil alone, or with wine in which there is astringency.
If however you are certain of a hot abscess, then place on the wound, if it is fresh with its own blood, and the air has not changed it, the powder which I will describe shortly: and if the air has already changed it, then place on it certain ointments, until it is healed.
If however the wound is large, or is from a sword cut, and similar things: and its edges do not come together by means of pads, then bring them together with sutures, according to what I will describe in wounds of the belly concerning their sutures.
If however the wound has already been separated from the bone, and hangs, and there is no retention of it except in a small suspension: then cut it.
Then treat the wound with medicines, and restore in it firm flesh in place of skin, and command the sick person to be nourished with foods in which there is thickness, such as heads, and cooked wheat, until it is like dough: and things similar to them.
If you find putrefaction in the skin, and it does not adhere to the bone: then cut away the entire putrefied part, and cast it away: then treat it.
If however in these wounds there is an artery, or vein from which blood flows: and it is not severed by medicines, then search over the artery.
If therefore you find it not severed, then sever it with a Spatumili, or tie it.
If necessity prompts when that which we have said does not help, then cauterize it until the blood is severed.
Method of the Flesh-forming Powder.
Take one part of frankincense, and two parts of dragon's blood, and three parts of quicklime:  grind the whole thoroughly, and sieve it: and fill the wound with it, and bind it with a good bandage, until it adheres well to it and coagulates with the blood.
Then bind it over with bandages, and leave it, and do not loosen it while it remains, so that it does not fester.
For the medicine is not eradicated from it until it is healed.
Then treat the remaining part with the other treatment until they heal.
Of wounds of the Neck.
Chapter LXXXV.
If however a wound occurs in the neck, then there is no difference between it in treatment, and between a wound of the head when it is simple.
If however the nerve of the neck, or the artery, is already cut: then if it is a nerve, there is no skill in it, except to avoid its treatment with anything that produces strong astringency, such as ziniar, and zegi, and similar things.
Because they harm the nerves, and contract them.
And do not put anything cold on the wound at all: because the substance of nerves is cold, and its continuation is with the brain, which is higher than the limbs: and let that which is used for treatment be mild from medicines, such as lime washed with sweet water sometimes infused with oil, or with rose oil, and tuttia, when washed also with sweet water: and the remaining mineral stones, in this manner, and moist ointments.
If however the wound is large, then administer sutures: or constrict its lips with pledgets.
Then treat it until it is healed.
If however the wound has depth, or a sinus has occurred in its lower part, in which pus is already collected, then pierce it in the more depressed place in it.
If, however, an artery has already been incised in the wound, and its blood flow has ensued: then separate, or cut it, and tie it: or cauterize it, if necessity calls for it.
If, however, the windpipe has already been cut, or the whole [throat], and the surrounding tissues have been saved, then bring together the skin flaps with sutures over the windpipe, and do not touch the windpipe, rather, equalize it, and restore it to its natural shape.
Then bind it with a proper ligature, and leave it for several days.
Then treat it with ointments containing astringency and desiccation, until it heals.
If, however, the wound has already made an impression on the bone, then explore it: then if there are fragments of bone within it, extract them all, or as many as you can: and that which is not extracted, leave it until the wound suppurates, and the discharge separates and is relieved.
If the wound is recent, then powder it with the powder I have described.
If, however, a bone appears in the wound, and a fistula forms, then treat it with that which is mentioned in its chapter.
Chapter Eighty-Six.
If, therefore, wind emerges from the wound when the sick person breathes heavily from it, then know that the wound is mortal.
If it does not have depth, and is fresh with its own blood: then do not put powder on it from the first hour, nor bind it, so that the blood is not retained in its depth, and returns to the heart, and kills the sick person; but put attracting ointment on it, and dissolve it twice a day.
If, however, ointment is not present for you, then place an old rag in the wound's opening, so that it sucks what emerges from it of humidities; and make the sick person sleep over the wound, so that what is collected in it may run.
If, however, three days or more have already passed since the wound, and no spasm has occurred in the sick person, nor bad tremor of the heart, nor constriction in breathing, and you see the other conditions of him are good: then know that the wound is safe.
Therefore, treat him with bandages and the rest of the treatment, until he is healed.
If, however, his healing is excused, and it is always opening up, then know that it has become a fistula.
Therefore treat it according to its chapter.
And if the wound is from a sword cut or a knife cut, and is simple on the surface of the chest or back, then treat it with what has gone before in terms of sutures, if it is large; or with powder, if it is small.
But if it has already made an impression on the bone, and has cut fragments from it, then examine the wound, and hasten to remove those fragments, if they are separate.
If, however, they are not separate, then leave them until the wound becomes putrid, for their removal will be easier.
However, for other accidental wounds in other limbs, the judgment in treatment is the judgment that we have stated.
Concerning wounds of the belly, and the exit of the intestines, and their expulsion.
Chapter LXXXVII.
A rupture that occurs in the belly is great, medium, and small.
From a great one, therefore, sometimes the intestine, or a number of intestines, emerges.
Therefore, their introduction, and their stitching, is more vehement and more difficult.
And a small rupture also becomes difficult in another way.
It follows, therefore, that their reduction is more difficult if you do not hasten their introduction to their place immediately, because it is inflated, opened, and thickened; wherefore their entrance becomes difficult.
Therefore, a middle rupture is better; because when it occurs, the reduction of the intestine is not difficult, as it is in these two types.
Know that the suturing of the belly is according to four ways.
Two common sutures are found in belly sutures, and in the sutures of other wounds of the body; and two other sutures are proper to other wounds.
However, they are more proper to the suturing of the belly; and I narrate each one to you with explanation and declaration. Therefore, I say that when the wound is small, and something from the intestine protrudes from it, and it is difficult to reduce it, then that is due to one of two ways.
Either because of the smallness of the rupture, as we said, or because there is an inflation in the intestine due to the coldness of the air.
When, therefore, it is thus, then it is necessary that you heat it, so that you immerse a sponge, or a damp cloth, in only lukewarm water.
Or boil it in water with squinanthus, and cyperus, and spike, and apply it to the intestine with it, until the inflation is resolved.
Sometimes wine in which there is astringency does it, and it is better than plain water in resolving the inflation.
When therefore you see the inflation already resolved, then moisten the intestine with water in which mallow or mallow has been boiled.
For through it the entrance of it is relieved with a small thing.
If however its return is excused after this treatment, then cut in the disruption a little, with the instrument with which hemorrhoids are cut.
And the first treatment is better when prepared, than the incision; and no compulsion is made to cut after necessity and the instrument's failure.
Let one part of it which is twisted and sharp, and the other part of it not sharp, and the fine end not be with the fineness of a spatula, but rather somewhat duller: and that is which is similar to a wedge, as you see.
When, therefore, the wound is enlarged, and the intestine enters, then it is necessary that its reduction be according to its natural form in its proper place, if possible over it; for it is better.
When, however, the rupture is wide in the lower part of the belly, then it is necessary that you cause the sick person to lie on his back, and raise his legs higher than his head.
And if it is in the upper part of the belly, then place his head and chest higher than his lower parts.
And similarly if the rupture is in one of the two parts of the belly, then place your intention and your consideration always in this, that the part in which the wound is be higher than the other part.
And thus it is necessary that you administer it in great wounds, and in medium wounds.
In small wounds, however, place it according to what is prepared for you.
Then have a pious minister present between your hands, who holds the entire rupture with his hand, and bring together its lips.
Then uncover from it for him who follows the suture something after something: and this is the mode of a single common suture.
And it is, that you take a needle, or a number of needles according to the amount of the wound's width.
Then release from the extremity of the rupture the amount of a ring finger, that is, a physician's: and fix one needle beyond that into which you insert a thread at both extremities of the skin, with the two extremities similarly done which are beneath the skin from the interior, until you cause it to penetrate from the other side, and you have already brought together the two extremities of the skin, and two extremities of similarly done: and four rows are made.
Then tighten with a double thread in a circular motion of the needle several times from both sides simultaneously, until the two lips of the wound are brought together with a proper joining.
Then release the thickness of a finger also, and fix another needle in them; afterwards draw it through with the thread, as you did with the first needle.
Therefore do not cease to do that with whatever needles you need, until you complete the tightening of the entire wound.
And the needles should be intermediate in thickness and thinness, because very thin needles cut the flesh very quickly, and thick ones are difficult to enter the skin; therefore, they should be intermediate in thinness and thickness.
And it is not necessary to fix the needle in the two closely adjacent skin edges for too long; so that the flesh is not cut quickly, and the wound is opened before its consolidation, and it should not be stretched too far with the suture, so that the wound is not prevented from healing.
Then trim the ends of the needles, so that they do not harm the sick person in their sleep; and place cushions of cloth around them on every side that hold the ends of the needles; and leave them until you know that the wound is already healed.
And this type of suture with needles is indeed more suitable for small wounds.
Because one, or two, or about that many needles are sufficient in their suture.
However, the second common suture is to gather together with the suture four edges: two edges of skin and two edges of a wound, at one time, with a needle on which a thread wrapped around is equal in fineness and thickness.
Then, when you have pierced these four edges with the needle, pull the needle back from the side from which you began, so that the thread drawn back falls from the upper part of the wound, so that it is a suture, like a suture of cloth by which cloths are drawn together, and place between each suture a quantity less than the thickness of a little finger.
However, this suture is known by men.
And with this suture I treated a wound that had happened to a man in his belly, who had been wounded with a knife, and the wound's rupture was greater than one palm: and about two palms of the middle intestine had come out from the intestines, and there was a rupture in the middle of the belly.
Therefore I returned it after his intestine had remained outside the wound for twenty-four hours.
Therefore, the wound was consolidated in a space of about fifteen days: and I treated it, and he was healed; and he lived after that for many years, engaged in his affairs.
And the physicians had judged that it would not be healed.
And it was a miracle that I did not treat it with ointment.
Because I was in a place where there was no ointment, nor any of the medicines.
Therefore, I placed an old bandage over the wound twice a day, and diligently washed it with honey water, until it was healed.
I will now describe two proper types of sutures, according to the account of the discourse.
And it is, that you begin with a sharp suture, and insert the needle from the outer to the inner part.
When therefore the needle penetrates the skin, and going into the muscle along the length and width of the entire body, leave the end in the side in which you inserted the needle, and let it penetrate the other end from the inner to the outer part at the other extremity.
When you have thus caused it to penetrate, then let it penetrate in this same extremity mirach from the outer to the inner part: and leave the end sifac, which is on this side, and let the needle penetrate the other extremity from the inner to the outer part: and let it penetrate with your penetration which you cause it to penetrate into the extremity sifac mirach, which is in its part, until it penetrates the whole thing.
Then begin also from this same side, and sew it with the extremity, which is from sifac on the other side, and withdraw the needle from the skin which it penetrated.
Then reduce it into that skin, and sew the extremity sifac, which is on the other side, with this extremity mirach: and withdraw it from the skin which is on its part, and do it one time, and another: and do it time after time, until you have sewed the whole outside according to that example.
And the summit of this suture is to sew the skin of the skinners in the way they sew skins: so that you sew sifac one time from one extremity of the skin; and that you leave it another time from another part, until you complete it.
The second species of proper suture, which Galen said.
His discourse relates that one should sew it according to the manner in which some physicians sew them, so that they gather every part to its corresponding part naturally: and apply the extremity sifac to its other extremity, and the extremity mirach to its other extremity.
And that is done according to what I tell you.
You should place the needle at the mirach extremity nearest to you on the outside, and make it penetrate to the inside in that sole; and leave the two sifac extremities.
Then turn the needle and make it penetrate from the outside to the inside in the two sifac extremities, namely on both sides.
Then turn both, also making them penetrate from the inside to the outside, into the two other mirach extremities, which are on the opposite side.
And this method of suture is better than the common easy suture, and is a suture whose recollection precedes.
This is therefore also Galen's discourse.
And some said.
The suture of the belly is rectified with two needles.
That is, that you introduce one thread in each of them: and begin with the insertion of the needle, from where it is with you, and cause it to penetrate to the other side, according to the suture of those who stitch hides equally.
And know that when the rupture is in the middle of the belly, then its suture is more difficult than the other parts of the belly.
The judgment of the treatment of a wound is like the judgment of the other wounds.
That is, because when you acquire a fresh wound with its blood, before the air alters it, and you replace the intestine, and mend it, and fit it, then place it upon the incarnating powder.
If the air has already altered the wound, then place certain ointments upon it that are present with you, until they produce pus, and the threads fall away, and the wound is consolidated, and mirach.
Then treat it as is the treatment of other wounds until it is healed.
If, however, the medicines are not present with you, then place on it immediately, from when it begins to emit pus, old cotum; and change it twice a day, as I have taught you, until it is healed.
If, however, you fear that the wound communicates with the main members in the injury, then it is necessary to immerse soft wool in oil of moderate heat, or in rose oil, and place it around the places that are between the groin and under the armpits.
If, however, he feels pain, or pricks, or putrefaction in his intestines (for this often happens) then enema him with astringent, black, warm wine; especially if putrefaction has already reached the intestine, and a penetrating exit has been made to its concavity.
And know that that which is from the large intestine is of easier healing; and that which is from those which are subtle is of more difficult healing.
However, the intestine called the Jejunum does not receive healing from a wound that occurs in it at all; and this is because of its multitude of veins, and their size, and because of the subtlety of its body, and the proximity of its nature to the nerves.
If, however, that which proceeds from the wound is a zirbum, and you obtain it fresh, reduce it according to your reduction, by which you reduce the intestines equally.
If, however, a space has passed and it has already become green or black, then you must tie it with a thread above the place that has blackened from it, so that a flow of blood does not occur.
For in a zirbum are veins and arteries.
Then cut that which is beyond that ligature, and hang the two ends of the thread from the lower part of the wound outside it, so that the pull on it may be relieved for you, and its extraction in the case of a zirbum, and the discharge of pus from the wound.
A recollection of the wound that occurred in the Intestine.
When a rupture occurs in the Intestine, and it is small, then it is possible that it may be restored in some people; for this reason, because I have seen someone who was wounded in his belly by the impact of a lance, and the wound was on the right side of the stomach, and the wound was old; and it became a fistula, and excrement and wind came out of it.
Therefore, I applied a treatment, until I was not confident in its healing; nor did I cease to refine it, until he was healed and the place was consolidated.
After I saw the place already consolidated, I feared for the sick person, lest an evil accident should befall the sick person in his belly; and no such evil accident befell him from that.
And he remained in better dispositions, eating and drinking, and having intercourse, and entered the bath, and exercised in his daily activities.
And now some experimenters have said that when a wound occurs in the Intestine, and it is small, then it should be tied in this manner.
And it is, that you should take ants of large heads.
Then bring together the two lips of the wound, and place one ant of those that have an open mouth upon the two lips of the wound.
When therefore it sits upon them, and tightens its mouth, cut off its head, for it adheres and does not loosen.
Then place another ant near the first, and do not cease to do this with ant after ant according to the quantity of the entire wound.
Then reduce it, and suture the wound.
For those heads remain attached to the intestine, until the intestine is fed, and healed, and no harm befalls the sick person at all. And now it is possible that the intestine be tied also with a thin thread: that which has been scraped from the animal's intestine, attached to it after it is introduced into the needle.
And it is so that you take the extremity of this thread from the intestine, and much of it is scraped off.
Then tie a thin linen thread wrapped around its extremity.
Then introduce that thread into the needle, and sew the intestine with it.
Then return it to the rupture. And this method of suture with ants and intestine is only according to the path of trust and hope.
Know that a wound that is large, wide, especially if it is in one of the small intestines: then there is no ingenuity except for refinement, nor is its healing at all.
Concerning the treatment of ulcers and fistulas.
Chapter LXXXVIII.
Know that any wound or abscess, when it grows old and becomes an ulcer, does not heal, and continually discharges pus, and cannot be cut away: then it is universally called a fistula, wherever in the body it may be, and we call it Zuchemen.
And a fistula, in truth, is a filtered, hard, white knot; with no pain, having the concavity of a bird's feather; and for that reason some call it Risati, that is, feather.
And it is in some hours moist, which discharges pus.
And perhaps the moisture is cut away in some hours.
And sometimes this moisture is abundant, and sometimes scarce; and sometimes thick, and sometimes thin.
And I already mentioned in the division, when I spoke of wounds, that every ulcer which does not heal, nor flesh grows in it, is not due to anything other than one of nine causes.
Of which one is, either because of the scarcity of blood in the body, or because of its bad quality; or because between it and the edges of it is hard flesh, preventing the growth of flesh; or because there is much filth and impurity; or because the ulcer itself is putrid, and the matter that is applied to it is of bad quality; or because the medicine is unsuitable for its treatment; or because the corruption prevailing in the region is a type of pestilence, or by its property in the region, as happens in Caesaraugusta, where the digestion of illnesses is difficult, and the healing of boils is delayed by nature; or because there is one bone, or a number of bones in it.
And I have already shown all these causes and their signs, and their treatments with the medicines in the division; and it is necessary here to make you know the treatment of Fistula and Zuken, which is done by surgical means with the hand.
Know therefore, that Fistula occurs in all members of the body.
For from among them are fistulas that reach large veins and arteries, or nerves, or sinuses; or to the intestine, or to the bladder, or to one of the ribs; or to one of the vertebrae of the back, or to any of the joints of compound structures, such as the hand and foot; and from among them are those that proceed to the proximity of the main limb, and similar ones.
Therefore, which of these fistulas is in this manner, is from among illnesses of difficult healing, and does not receive treatment, and the occupation with it is labor and ignorance.
If, however, there is any fistula whose depth does not reach these places that I have mentioned; and you hope and trust in its cure, and wish to achieve knowledge of it, then take a probe, made of air or iron, if the fistula tends in a straight line, and investigate it with it.
If, however, there is twisting in the fistula, then investigate it with a probe of fine lead.
Since lead, with its gentle body, is alleviated and curved around the twisting.
If the fistula has many openings, it is not possible for you to indicate over it with a probe.
Therefore, irrigate from those openings of its openings.
For the moisture with which you irrigate it goes toward the other openings and runs from them.
Then inquire thoroughly, according to whatever method is possible for you, to ascertain whether there is a bone, or a nerve, and the cavity of the fistula is distant or near; or whether it is a single fistula with many openings, and stand over all of it with your utmost strength, with your questioning, by which you question the sick person, and the discovery of pain upon pressing with your hand upon the location, and similar indications and causes of accidents of the abscess.
When, therefore, you have stood over all of it in this true manner, then proceed to the treatment with confidence: and it is that you should then consider whether the fistula is near, visible, or in a safe place distant from a joint, or from a nerve, or artery, or vein, or one of the places I have told you: then cut the fistula according to what has been said by me before, and remove whatever is in it by filtration and corrupt flesh, that arises within its opening from flesh, or boils, and similar things; and treat it until it is healed.
If, however, the fistula is of deep and distant depth, and is straight, then it is necessary that you cut it in depth as much as possible for you.
Then cleanse it of all its corrupted flesh.
Then apply strips soaked in sharp medicines, and insert them into the cavity of the fistula that you have grasped with the iron. Do this with it several times, until the sharp medicine has corroded everything remaining in the cavity of the fistula from the corruption.
Then restore it with ointments that generate healthy flesh, until it is healed.
If, however, it is not healed by that, then cauterize it according to what we have narrated.
If therefore the cause of the fistula is bone, and it is confirmed to you, then seek it out and cut it according to what I have told you: if nothing prevents you from a vein, or nerve, or major member, as we said.
If therefore bone is found by you, and there is something of corruption and blackness in it, then scrape it until all its corruption is removed.
Then treat it with that which makes it flesh, until it is healed.
If it is not healed, and discharges pus as it did before, then know that you have not achieved the complete eradication of the corruption.
Therefore, expose it again and thoroughly scrape and cleanse it with all your strength.
Then restore it.
If it is healed, then good; and if not, then know that the corruption is in a distant depth of the body, which you have not reached.
Therefore, you have no skill in it, except to leave it to nature.
If a small bone is corrupted, and it is possible for you, extract it with thin forceps suitable for it.
If, however, there are many bones, then carefully extract all of them, and do not leave any of them behind with your strength.
If, however, some moisture creates an obstacle for you, and there is no fear or mistake in cutting them: then cut those moistures and flesh, if there are any there, and free the bones.
If, however, you are not prepared to remove the bones from your time, then place over the wound that which will cause it to fester; and leave it, until that which is surrounding those bones from the flesh and moistures festers.
And guard the wound so that it does not heal.
And constrict the section which you have cut in your operation.
Indeed, place over it, if you fear, a cloth soaked in ground sulfur with oil; or a cloth soaked in Egyptian ointment, or some other green ointments.
For when those moistures, namely, fester, and the bones are separated from them, the removal and extraction of them is made easier.
If however there is one large bone, such as the bone of the leg, or the bone of the hip, and similar to them, and that which is corrupt from it is a large part: then scrape it with the utmost scraping, until that blackness and corruption is removed.
Then restore the wound.
If however that which is corrupt in it is a large part, and the corruption has already reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to saw it, and to cut it all the way to the place where the corruption has reached: then treat it until it is consolidated. And I relate to you the case of a man in his leg, so that you may set it as an example and assistance for your operation.
There was a young man about thirty years of age, who suffered pain in his leg, from a cause that arose within his body, that is, from the interior, until the matters reached the leg, and it became greatly inflamed: and there was no external cause.
Therefore, time passed with the error of the physicians, until the abscess was opened, and many matters rushed in with it.
And his treatment was delayed until the leg became fistulous, and many openings were made in it; all of which discharged pus and bodily humours.
Therefore, a multitude of physicians treated him for about two years, and there was no wise practitioner of the manual art among them, until I was called, and saw his leg and the matters that flowed from those openings with great force; even the entire body of the man was already decaying, and his complexion was yellow.
Therefore, I inserted a probe into one of the openings, and the probe reached the bone.
Then I examined all the openings, and found that they reached each other from all parts of the leg. I then hastened and cut over one of those openings until I uncovered part of the bone; and I found it corrupted; already corroded, and blackened, and rotten, and perforated, until it had penetrated down to the marrow.
I therefore removed what was exposed to me, and prepared it from the corrupted bone.
And I judged that there was nothing in the bone except that corruption which I cut away and removed.
And I had already eradicated it.
Then I placed the restoration of the wound with consolidating medicines for a long time.
And it was not consolidated.
Then I attempted its restoration.
And it was not restored.
Then I restored it with medicines, and it quickly consolidated and healed: and this repetition in its operation and section was not necessary, except on account of the weakened state of the infirm person, and their scant tolerance, and my fear for them of death; since it happened to them at all hours, due to an excess of evacuations, from ill syncopes.
Therefore, they were healed with complete recovery: and hard flesh grew in the place of the bone, and a good condition was established in their body, and their strength returned: and they returned to their normal state: and walking caused them no harm at all.
If, however, a projecting bone in the body has already been fractured, then it is necessary to saw it, according to this method: and it is to take a bandage, and to tighten it on the end of the protruding bone; and to order someone to extend it upwards; and to place another bandage of thicker wool on the first bandage. Then tie it over the flesh which is under the bone; and extend its end, so as to draw the flesh downwards; and you uncover the flesh over the place that you wish to saw, so that the saw does not injure the flesh.
Place wood, or a board, properly beneath the bone below; for when you do this, it does not prevent you from cutting the corrupted flesh.
And it is necessary that the sawing be over the corrupted place for a short time, so that there is no corruption in the hollow of the bone; and it does not appear in its appearance to the senses, and forces a sawing of it another time. If the bone is corrupted, and is not protruding, but rather its part is continuous with another part, and the corruption is in its middle, or in a part of it, then uncover the flesh from all sides completely.
Then place wood underneath.
Afterwards saw it from the first part, where the corruption is, until the sawing is continuous from the other part; and let the sawing be along the length from the corruption for a short while, as we have said.
If the corruption is in the joint, cut the corrupted joint itself, and saw the bone where it is continuous on the other side.
If, however, the corruption is in the continuation of two joints, then there is no remedy in it except abrasion.
If the corruption is in the finger of the hand, or in the finger of the foot: then the matter in it is very difficult.
But you must investigate how the corruption appears to you.
And abrade it, and cleanse it according to whatever arrangement is possible for you, and with whatever remedy rectifies itself for you: when it does not cause you opposition from a vein or nerve.
And know that there are many incisions and saws for cutting these bones, according to the position of the bones, and their preparation, and their thickness and thinness, and their size and smallness, and their hardness and their rarity.
Therefore, it is necessary to prepare a suitable instrument for every kind of operation.
And know that these operations indicate to you the kind of instrument you need, when you have long study with you.
And the knowledge of the methods of this art is a witness to the ways of illnesses; for then you will find for yourself what is appropriate to it from instruments for every sickness.
Saw shape.
Shape of another saw.
Shape of another saw.
Shape of another saw.
This saw shape depicted, should be made properly. Let its upper arch be of sharpness from iron; and its handle of boxwood, and let it be a pyramidally well-made one.
Shape of the razors' joints.
Let the head of this razor be, according to the shape of a star-shaped nail's head; and let its points be according to the shape of the points of an elischetfegi.
And it is not suitable, unless the heads of the joints are rubbed with it, when they become corrupted, or the bone is large and great.
Shape of the larger razor.
Shape of the middle razor.
Shape of the broad razor.
Shape of the razor in which there is a concavity.
Shape of the other, slender razor.
Shape of the other razor with a curved end.
Shape of a small, slender, taut razor.
Shape of the razor with which bones are cut.
Shape of a large razor also.
This is similar to a saw, and the end is like a saw: it is shown in many places by the cutting of bones.
Shape of the razor suitable for the cutting of that which is perforated in bones.
Its end is triangular, with sharp points.
It is made of Indian material.
And similarly, all that we have said concerning razors, and chisels, and saws should be done.
Concerning the incision of extremities, and the sawing of bones.
Chapter LXXXIX.
Extremities putrefy, either from an external or internal cause.
Therefore, if you have treated that corruption with medicinal remedies, and the treatment does not help, and you see the corruption extending into the limb, to which nothing reacts: then it is necessary to cut that limb, to the point where the corruption reaches, so that it escapes from death or from the greater harm that is caused by the loss of the limb.
And the sign of this happening is that the limb darkens until it smells foul: as if fire had burned it, or it rots after the blackness; until that rot is cut into, reaching the limb itself, and creeps throughout the whole body.
Therefore, hasten with its incision, and likewise if the cause of the corruption is from the sting of certain poisonous creatures, such as the sea scorpion, and viper, and rattlesnake, and similar ones.
If, therefore, the corruption or injury is in the extremity of a finger, then cut off the finger, and do not give space to the corruption to spread to the rest of the hand.
And likewise, if it happens in the hand, then cut it off at the root of the forearm, and do not give space to the corruption, until it reaches the forearm.
And if it invades it, then cut off the arm at the elbow joint. If however the corruption passes, and you see it approximately at the elbow, then in that is the death of the sick person.
And to administer beyond that from treatment, is a matter of skill.
And similarly do with the foot, when corruption invades a toe, then cut it off at one of the joints; and if it reaches the sole of the foot, then cut off the entire foot.
If however it ascends to the knee, then cut off the leg at the knee joint.
If however the corruption has already reached above the knee, then there is no remedy in it, except for release, and leaving the sick person to die.
And the method of cutting or sawing off a limb is to tie the ligament below the one you wish to cut, and tie another ligament above the spot.
And let the attendant stretch one ligament downwards, and let the attendant stretch the other ligament upwards.
And separate the flesh that is between the two ligaments with a broad spatula until all the flesh is exposed.
Then it is cut or sawn.
And it is necessary that you place linen cloth on all sides, and that the saw not touch a healthy part; and that the sick person suffer added injury, and a hot abscess.
If, however, an internal bleeding occurs while you are operating, then cauterize the place quickly; or put some powders that stop the bleeding upon it.
Then return to your medication, until it is completed.
Then bind the wounded limb with a bandage suitable to it, and care for it until it is healed.
And I tell you that it happened to a man in his foot, this same happening that I tell you.
That is, because it happened in his foot with a blackness, with a burn resembling the burning of fire: and that corruption first happened in his toe, until it began the whole foot.
Therefore, the man hastened from himself, after he saw the corruption fall upon the limb with its intensity, which he found from its pain and burning: and it fell upon him at the joint, and he was healed.
And after a long time passed, that same corruption happened to him in the index finger of his hand. Therefore, he came to me, and I attempted to recover that superfluity with what I placed upon his hand from medicines after the purification of his body: and the superfluity was not repelled, and it began to proceed to another finger: until the corruption began in the hand.
Therefore, he called me to cut his hand: and I did not want that, hoping from me upon the repulsion of that superfluity: and I also feared for him at the incision of his hand death.
Because the man's strength was over the fall.
Therefore, after he despaired of me, he returned to his land: and it came to me concerning him, that he hastened and cut his entire hand: and he was healed.
And I have not brought forth this narration, except that it may be a help concerning that which falls from the kind of this sickness: and that it may be a signification by which it may be signified, and according to which it may be done.
Concerning the treatment of Sinuses, and the quality of clysterization with medicines.
Chapter 90.
When an abscess occurs in certain fleshy limbs, and the space of the abscess is prolonged, until it forms a collection of pus: then it breaks, or is pierced, and that which is in it of pus comes out, and a hollow place remains as if it were a vessel: and the skin which is over it is like a cloth which has now become thin: and it does not reach its final stage of corruption, nor does it affect the mouth, nor the nerve, nor the ligament: it deserves to be called a Sinus; and it is not called a Fistula: but if its space is prolonged, until the corruption affects any of these members, then it is called a Fistula, or zuken.
And its treatment is to cut that entire skin as it rolls back, and especially when it is thin and made like a cloth; and you are confident that it does not adhere to the place, because of its corruption.
However, if you hope that the skin adheres, and that corruption does not result from that final consequence; and if there is thickness of flesh in the skin, then treat it with a clyster; and it is, that you consider the Sinus.
Then, if it is large, and the pus that is emitted from it has a foul odor, then clysterize it with an Egyptian medicine, which is vinegar, and oil, and ziniar, taking equal parts, to be mixed in a vessel; and let them be boiled over the fire, until the medicine reddens; and it becomes the thickness of honey.
Then take from it what you need, and dissolve it with water and honey, and clysterize the Sinus with it; and constrict its opening, and leave the medicine in it for the amount of two hours.
Then extract it with pressure; do this for so many days, until the Sinus is cleansed, and the foul odor is removed.
And sometimes it is clysterized with ash water, when this medicine is not present to you; and it is, that you take the ashes of vine wood, or the ashes from the trees of the holly, and pour water over it.
Then strain it, and clysterize with it, until you are confident that the Sinus is now washed.
If the sick person does not tolerate Egyptian medicine, nor ash water, then clysterize him with water and honey, to which some crushed ziniar has already been mixed.
Or clysterize him with honey and wine mixed, since the property of honey is to cleanse and wash; and wine causes the sinus to adhere, especially when there is an excess of astringency and dryness in the wine.
When you do this repeatedly, and are confident that the corruption of the Sinus is now removed, then clysterize him with that which causes flesh to grow there.
And it is to take from the dyafinicon plaster, and dissolve it with rose oil and astringent wine; or clysterize him with some medicines and other ointments, whose properties I have written in the treatise on ointments.
If the opening of the Sinus is constricted, so that the clyster tube does not fit: then enlarge it a little with iron; or place in it a linen cloth wrapped in Egyptian ointment, or in basil ointment, until it is enlarged.
And similarly if the opening is also wide, then bring together its lips with suture; and leave in it a quantity into which a clyster may enter without addition.
And similarly if the opening from which pus runs is elevated upwards, then cut it in the lower place which is in it, so that pus runs from it downwards; because when pus is constricted in the depth of the Sinus, it prevents flesh from being generated in it.
If it is not possible for you to cut the Sinus approximately below the place you want, then try to prepare the limb in such a way that pus runs from it with ease, as is prepared for you.
Try to prevent any pus from remaining in it; and take strengthening medicines that are placed on the wound, suitable to what you wish.
And spread them over a linen cloth.
And let the cloth be of such a size that it covers the entire Sinus.
Then cut with scissors a hole in the direction of the Sinus opening, slightly larger than the Sinus opening.
Then spread gentle ointments over another cloth, according to the size of the hole; and place it over the first, at a distance from the Sinus opening, so that the pus may be discharged more easily from it; and do not remove the large cloth, except after some days at a time.
However, the one over the sinus opening is the one you remove every hour, so that what collects in it from pus may exit; and so that you may know whether the matter running from it, is much or little; or digested or undigested.
And with this again consider the location of the sinus itself, whether its master feels pain in it, or whether there is no pain, and whether there is an abscess in it, or not.
Therefore, when your treatment proceeds in this way, and you see the matter that exits from the sinus opening, then know that the sinus is now adhering or is approaching adherence; then dissolve it in the morning, or on the third day; and when you dissolve the wound, then replace the cloth and renew the ointment. However, if thin matter exits from the Sinus after a long time, then do not despair of its adherence, for its healing is near, because there are people whose flesh generation is slow in their wounds, and there are those who act contrary to that.
However, if undigested pus exits from the sinus after many days, then know that the sinus does not adhere.
If, therefore, the adherence of the sinus is delayed and its condition prolonged, then add to the drying of the medicines, but let the physicians make them, so that the medicines are moist in their substance and dry in their power, such as the dyafinicon ointment, when superfluity of addition from zegi is added to it.
And from the last remedies used for treatment, is to take dyafinicon ointment and dissolve it with rose oil, and sprinkle upon it old wine, equal in its substance.
Then mix it with that, and use it.
And it now does a similar action to this, when you do not have dyafinicon ointment present, honey, when you boil it until it thickens, and use it.
Or take myrrh, and aloe, and frankincense: grind the whole, and powder it over honey while it is over the fire.
Then line a cloth with it, and bind it over the sinus; and line with the honey you boiled, until it thickened; and powder spices over it, and place over the cloth, and bind it.
And sometimes long aristolochia, and the roots of the celestial lily, and the lily, and the herb flour, and centaury are administered in it.
Use them, simple or mixed, grind them, and sieve them: and powder them over the honey I spoke of, and use it.
If the sinus condition persists and is not cured by this treatment, then know that there is corruption deep within it; or it is already making an impression on the bones, or on the other hard members, or ligaments; then treat it with the treatment of fistulas, as was previously described. Concerning the treatment of whitlow, and of a worn-down nail, and the incision of a grafted finger, and of the section.
Chapter XCI.
A whitlow is an abscess that arises beneath the nail of the thumb of the hand, or of the foot; and perhaps it arises on the other fingers.
Therefore, when its condition prolongs itself, and its treatment is neglected, and the abscess becomes a hot abscess, or it becomes corrupted and emits pus, until it corrodes the root of the nail; and perhaps it corrupts the whole of it, and perhaps the corruption reaches the bone, until there is a foul odor; and the end of the finger becomes wide, and its color becomes dark.
Therefore, when you treat it, with what we have said in division, and your treatment does not help, then it is necessary to cut with an iron the entire excess that remains from the nail.
Then cauterize the wound after that.
For the cautery is very helpful.
If however the bone is sound, and the nail also healthy, and the empty additions of the nail now press the flesh inwards, and begin to prick it and injure it, then it is necessary that you place a thin radium under the angle of the nail that pricks the flesh, and drive it upwards; and cut the flesh with ease, and put on that which remains of the flesh burning, corrosive medicines, until all of it is removed.
Then treat it with ointments, until it is healed.
If, however, corruption has already impressed itself upon the bone, then it is necessary to cut that bone and extract it, for it will never be healed while corrupt bone remains within.
If you see corrosion and corruption advancing into the finger, then cut it at one of its joints, according to the preceding description of it.
Then treat it until it is healed.
If, however, there is abrasion or impact of the nail, and a severe pain occurs, then it is necessary to first bleed the weak person.
Then cut the nail with a sharp spatula in a transverse cut from above to below.
And be careful that the cut does not reach the flesh beneath the nail, for you will cause severe pain to the afflicted person by that, and it will be a cause of added flesh growing in that place.
Then treat the place with that which soothes the pain.
The extra finger, which is born in some people's hands, is perhaps entirely fleshy, or perhaps contains bones in some of them, and perhaps a nail is on it. And some of them are born at the root of the joint, or their origin is in some of the finger's knots.
Therefore, the one that arises in some knots of the finger does not move; and the one that arises at the joint of the finger perhaps does move.
Therefore, the one that is fleshy among them, its incision is easy.
That is, to cut it at its root with a broad spatula.
But the treatment of the one whose origin is in the root of the joint is difficult.
Therefore, abstain from its incision.
In the one, however, that is born on the finger at the last of the nodes, then it is necessary to cut first its flesh with a round incision up to the bone.
Then saw the bone with one of those saws suitable for it.
Then treat it until it is healed.
The consolidation that occurs between the fingers often happens either by the nature of the human being, that is, it is born with it, or from the consolidation of a wound, or from the burning of fire, and similar things.
Therefore, it is necessary to separate that consolidation until the fingers return to their natural form.
Then place linen strips or cloths soaked in rose oil between them, so that they do not consolidate quickly, and separate them: or place a thin sheet of lead between them, until the place is consolidated as it ought to be.
And similarly, if consolidation occurs between certain fingers and the palm, then cut that consolidation, according to what is prepared and suitable for the shape of the limb.
Concerning the incision of a defect.
Chapter Ninety-two.
Ulcers are veins wrapped, thick, full of melancholic superfluities which occur in many members of the body: and their effect is most often in the legs, especially in the legs of those traveling and working, and carrying burdens.
Therefore, it is necessary to administer a shaking of the body from black bile, sometimes with a forceful shaking.
Then, the patient's veins should be opened.
The treatment of them with iron is according to two methods.
One of them is that they should be cut, and the black blood drawn out.
And the other method is that the vein should be raised, and the entire one drawn out.
However, its incision is according to this method.
First, soak the leg in much hot water until the thick, foul blood is dissolved.
Then bind the patient's leg from the upper part of his thigh, down to the lower part of the knee, with a bandage.
Then cut the vein in one, or two, or three places with a wide incision.
Then cut the nail until further down: until there issues forth from the blood a quantity which you see sufficient, and which the strength of the patient tolerates.
Afterwards tie it: and order him to abstain from foods generating black bile: and repeat the evacuation and phlebotomy, when the veins are filled, and that harms the patient.
Its elevation, however, is according to this method.
Shave the leg of the patient, if there are many hairs on it.
Then introduce him into a bath: or embrocate his leg with hot water, until it turns red, and the veins are prominent: or let him exercise with vigorous exertion, if a bath is not available to him, until the limb is warmed.
Then cut the skin in a straight line along the vein's section: either at its last point near the knee, or at its lower part near the heel.
Then open the skin with hooks, and scrape the vein from all sides until it appears to the senses: and at its appearance, you will see it sloping from red to black.
When it thus emerges from the skin, you will see it white like a string.
Then introduce a probe under it, until when it is lifted and emerges from the skin: suspend it with a blunt, gentle hook.
Then cut another section near that section by three fingers' breadth.
Then scrape the skin from above the vein until it appears.
Then lift it with the probes as you did, and suspend it with another hook, as you did at first.
Then cut another section, or several sections, if you need them.
Then lift, and cut it at the very last section near the heel.
Then pull it out to the section above it.
And do that until you pull it out of the section which is higher, or higher than all the sections, until the whole thing comes out: then cut it.
However, if it does not yield to you for pulling and lifting, then insert an awl with a strong thread doubled, and tie it, and pull it out; or insert a rod beneath it, and revolve your hand in every direction until it comes out.
And be careful not to cut it.
For if it is cut, it becomes very difficult for you to lift it, and a harmful injury enters upon the weak from it.
When therefore you have pulled it out completely, then put on the wound site wool soaked in wine and rose oil, or oil; and treat it until it is healed.
If the vine is contracted, having a twisting to which there is an involvement to the parts, and is not as we have said in a straight manner: then it is necessary to cut into it on every part of its twisting, and its places of involvement.
Then suspend it with hooks, until you lift it all: and be careful at your incision on it not to cut a vein, or wound: for it will be difficult for you to lift, or to extract it.
Therefore preserve your prudence.
Form of the incident by which the vine is healed.
Form of the blind hook.
It does not have a curvature like the other hooks, nor a sharp end, so as not to wound a vein: and it is of a thick, smooth bend, because if it were slender, it would cut a vein by its thinness: indeed, superfluous thickness is in it, as we have said.
Of the extraction of the vein of the leg. Chapter XCIII.
This vein is produced in legs in hot lands, such as the Alizegi and the land of the Arabs, and in arid, hot lands, few in tenderness, that is, in which neither grass nor tree grows.
And perhaps it is produced in other parts of the body besides the legs.
And indeed its generation is from the putrefaction that occurs under the skin, as happens within the bodies of snakes and worms, and worms generated between the skin and flesh.
And the sign of the beginning of this vein's occurrence is that a violent inflammation happens in the leg.
Then the place becomes blistered.
Then the vein begins to emerge from the place of that blistering, as if it were the root of a plant, or an animal.
Therefore, when its extremity appears from it, then it is necessary to wrap a piece of lead, whose weight is from one drachma to two drachmas, around it and tie it: and leave the lead hanging from the leg.
Whenever anything emerges from it to the exterior, wrap that in lead and tie it.
If it extends a great deal, then cut off a portion of it, and wrap the remainder.
And do not cut it off at the root before the whole of it emerges.
For if you cut it, it contracts and enters the flesh; and causes an abscess and putrefaction in the place, and a bad ulcer.
Therefore it must be gently treated and pulled out gradually, until the last part emerges, and nothing remains of it in the body; and from this vein, in some men, it emerges to a length of five palms and ten.
And it has come to my knowledge that it emerged from a man to a length of twenty palms.
However, if it is cut during your time of treatment, then introduce a rod into its opening, and pierce it with a long hole, along with its body, until all the material within is evacuated; and treat the putrefaction of the place with remedies for several days. Then treat it with the treatment for abscesses.
And this vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears at the joint of the foot, or in the foot itself; and many openings occur in it, and a branch emerges from every opening.
Therefore, treat it, as we said in the division, and with what was previously stated.
Concerning the incision on worms generated under the skin, and it is called the Cattle Disease.
Chapter XCIV.
This disease is called in a certain land among us the Cattle Disease; because it often happens to cattle, and is a small single worm that is born between the skin and flesh.
And it goes through the whole body, ascending and descending; and its passage from limb to limb is shown to the senses, until it bursts a place in the skin wherever it bursts, and emerges.
And its generation is from the putrefaction of certain humours.
Just as worms and snakes, that is, roundworms and threadworms, happen in the belly.
And it is feared because of its malice.
Because when it travels in the body, and rises to the head, and reaches a place: then perhaps it bursts there, and emerges, and destroys the eye: and that happens many times.
Therefore, when you wish to cure it and extract it, then it is not done except at its wandering and its appearance to the sense.
Therefore it is necessary to bind that which is above it and that which is below it with a strong constricting bandage.
Then cut above it, and extract it.
If it penetrates into the flesh, and you do not find it, then apply a cautery with fire to the place, until it dies.
And the greater fear is its corruption, by which it corrupts the eye, as we have said. If however you see it already having reached the head near the eye, then bind below it the eyebrow with a good constriction.
Then cut above it, and extract it.
And it is necessary that the sick person use the cleansing of his body, with medicines that dissolve bad, putrid humors.
And let him beware of foods that generate putrefaction.
Concerning the incision above the ailment Nakir.
Chapter XCV.
This ailment is called Nakir in our land: and it is a pain that occurs in certain limbs, then changes from limb to limb.
And I myself have already seen it, as I relate to you.
I was summoned to a woman ill in certain villages.
And she uncovered her arm, and I saw a small swelling in the vein of the arm's cord.
And after I stayed an hour, I saw one swelling move with a quiver, as a worm moves, ascending to her shoulder more quickly than is possible: so that it is like quicksilver, when it runs from place to place.
Therefore, the pain receded from that place, and settled in the shoulder.
Then I sat for an hour, and it ran to the rest of the body, until it reached the other arm.
Then she told me that it was revolving throughout her whole body, as I had seen.
Therefore, I was amazed at the speed of its change from limb to limb.
And indeed, before that I had not seen this illness with my own eyes in such a manner.
However, I saw many who find pain changing from limb to limb, and I did not see it with my eyes, as I saw it in the woman.
And I do not think it is anything other than because she was one of those who are from the dry lands, with detected veins:  therefore, that windiness appears changing to the senses.
And it is necessary that they not appear in this way in those who are delicate, and with moist bodies, of hidden veins.
When, therefore, you wish to cure it, and the patient feels that pain: then if it is apparent to you by sight, as we said, then compress above it and below it quickly, and cut above it until that constrained windiness exits, and cauterize the place.
If, however, you do not see it with your eyes, then treat it with shaking the body, and with things that expel winds, and soothe them with foul pills, and pills of serpent, and similar things.
Concerning the extraction of Arrows.
Chapter XCVI. Arrows are diversified according to their types and according to the locations in which they strike the body.
Their diversity is indeed such, because among them are those which have large points, and small ones: and concave ones, and blunt ones.
And among them are those which have three angles.
And among them are those with tongues.
And among them are those with stars.
Those which are according to the limbs on which they fall are in two ways.
For the members are either from the principal hollow members, such as the brain, and heart, and liver, and lung, and kidneys, and intestines, and bladder, and the like of these.
Therefore, when it falls into any of these members, and the signs of death appear to you, which I tell you afterwards, then you should avoid extracting the arrow from them, for death follows it in whoever it is in, in many situations.
And when these bad signs do not appear to you, and the arrow is not hidden deep within the member, then extract it, and treat the wound.
For the signs of the brain, when an arrow falls into it, and penetrates the bone, and emerges through the membrane that is above the brain, are: because violent headaches, and blindness, and dizziness, and redness in the eyes, and swelling, and redness of the tongue, and spasm, and confusion of the intellect, and vomiting of bile occur from it.
And perhaps blood emerges from the nostrils, or the ears.
And perhaps speech is cut off, and the voice is destroyed.
And a white moisture like gruel emerges from the place of the wound.
And from it exits something similar to the watery part of flesh.
If therefore these signs appear to you, then abstain from treatment, and remove the arrow if it does not emerge.
However, the signs of an arrow when it strikes the heart are: that it is near the left breast; and that one feels as if it is fixed in a hard thing, not in an empty thing.
And perhaps the arrow's movement is similar to the movement of a pulse; and black blood runs from the wound.
And that is followed by coldness of the extremities, and cold sweat, and fainting.
Know therefore, that death descends without a doubt.
And the sign of an arrow when it wounds the lung is the outflow of frothy blood from the wound; and the vessels that follow the neck become inflamed, and the sick person's colour changes.
And he exhales a large, deep breath; and seeks the attraction of cold air.
If the arrow strikes the covering in the chest, then it is near the small ribs; and there is a great gasping with violent pain, with a sigh; and all the members of the shoulders move.
And if the arrow strikes the stomach, then perhaps undigested food will emerge from the wound.
And if the arrow strikes the abdomen and is fixed in it, something of the excrement, or a piece of the zirbum, or an already ruptured intestine, emerges from the wound.
Therefore, there is no hope for its cure, nor in extracting the arrow.
If the arrow strikes the bladder, and urine emerges, and something proceeds from it to the outside, and the pain is stronger than the weakness, then know that it is mortal.
However, the other limbs, such as the face, neck, throat, shoulder blade, arm, the vertebrae of the back, the collarbone, hip, leg, and similar limbs are saved in various ways, when the arrow does not strike an artery or nerve and is not poisoned.
And I tell you what I have seen concerning these arrows, so that you may signify it in your treatment.
Because an arrow struck a man in the tear duct of his eye, at the root of his nose.
Therefore, I extracted it from the other side, under the fat of his ear; and he was healed, and no harm came to his eye.
And I extracted another arrow from a Jew, which struck him in the fat of his eye beneath the lower eyelid; and the arrow was already hidden, and I obtained nothing from it but a small extremity, with which it adheres to its shaft; and it was a large arrow from the bows of the Turks, with soft iron, in which there are no ears.
Therefore, the Jew was healed, and no bad accident happened to his eye. And I extracted another arrow from the throat of a Christian.
And it was an Arabic arrow, and it is the one which has ears.
Therefore, I cut above it between the two guides; and it was already submerged in his throat.
Therefore, I worked on it carefully until I extracted it, and the Christian was healed.
And I extracted another arrow from the man which had fallen into his belly; and we thought that he would die from it.
After therefore thirty days had passed, and nothing had changed concerning his condition, I cut above the arrow; and I worked on it, and I extracted it; and he was healed, and no misfortune happened to him.
And I saw a man on whom an arrow had fallen on his back, and the wound had healed over it.
After therefore seven years had passed, an arrow emerged at the root of his thigh.
And I saw a woman on whom an arrow had fallen into her belly, and the wound had healed over it, and the arrow remained inside her; and no change occurred in her condition, and the woman experienced no harm in any of her natural functions.
And I saw another man, on whose face an arrow had fallen: and the wound healed, and it remained, causing him not much pain; and many similar cases to these.
And I extracted an arrow from a man of the king's leading men, which had fallen into the middle of his nose, and had already inclined slightly to the right side: and the arrow was entirely concealed.
I was therefore summoned for his treatment after the arrow's impact up to three days.
I therefore found the arrow wound to be very tight.
I therefore searched for it with a fine probe, and did not feel it: and indeed he was finding a prick and pain beneath his right ear.
I therefore hoped that that prick was from the arrow's tip.
I therefore plastered the area with a plaster having attractive and digestive power, trusting in myself that the area would become an abscess, and that a sign of the arrow would appear for me to cut upon it: and no event occurred in the area signifying that the arrow had reached the place.
I therefore applied the plaster to it for many days: and no event occurred, and the wound meanwhile healed: and he remained weak from its extraction for a space of days, until on a certain day he felt the arrow within his nose.
And he recounted it to me.
I therefore applied a sharp, corrosive medicine to that wound for many days, until it opened; and when I probed it, I felt a thin arrowhead adhering to the wood.
Then I added to the opening of the wound with that sharp medicine, until the arrowhead became visibly apparent to us; and about four months passed with him during this time.
Then, after the wound had enlarged, and it was possible for me to insert forceps into it and move it, and it did not yield to extraction, I did not cease to refine and devise methods for it, until on a certain day I began to use suitably crafted forceps, in the manner that their form will be described at the end of the chapter, until I extracted it.
Then I restored the wound.
And indeed physicians judge that the cartilage of the nose is not restored.
Therefore I restored it, and the wound was consolidated, and the infirm man was healed with complete health; and nothing at all harmed him.
And I narrate to you the quality of the extraction of certain arrows: so that you may place that as a rule and signification upon that which I have not said.
Since the parts of this art and their distinctions are not encompassed with the narrative, nor does the book encompass it, and a skillful craftsman compares little things to much, and the present to the absent, and discovers a new operation and a new instrument in the descent of the foreign matters of this art when they occur.
I say, therefore, that arrows do not emerge from the limbs in which they are fixed, except according to two ways. Or by extraction from the place from which it entered.
Or by the opposite of another part.
And that which emerges from where it entered is either an arrow proceeding in a fleshy place, and is drawn out, and emerges.
If it does not yield to exit at the hour in which it falls, then it is necessary that you leave it for several days, until the flesh that is around it rots, and its extraction and emergence are eased.
And similarly, if it is fixed in the bone, and does not yield to you for exit, then leave it also for several days, and repeatedly remove it with extraction and movement every day, until it emerges.
If it does not yield to you for exit after days, then it is necessary that you pierce the surroundings of the arrow in the bone itself from every side with a fine drill, until the arrow's path is widened.
Then draw it out and remove it.
If however the arrow is fixed in the bone of the head, and has already penetrated one of the ventricles of the brain, and some of those accidents that I have described appear in the weak person, then refrain from removing the arrow, and leave it, until its condition is equalized after days.
For if the arrow reaches the sifach, then death is not prolonged for him.
And if the arrow is not fixed, except in the body of the bone only, and does not penetrate as far as the sifach; and the weak person remains for several days, and nothing of those accidents happens to him; then proceed with removing the arrow and extracting it.
If however it is very firmly fixed, and does not yield to removal: then administer a drill around the arrow, as I have shown you: then treat the area until it is healed.
If however the arrow is now hidden in a place of the body, and is concealed and hidden from sight, then search for it with probes.
If you feel it, then remove it with certain instruments that are suitable for its extraction.
If however you cannot remove it, due to the constriction of the wound, and due to the arrow's length deep within: and there is no bone, nor nerve, nor vein there: then enlarge it above it, until the wound is widened, and it is possible to extract the arrow.
If however it has ears by which it is held, then free the flesh fixed to them from every side, by every means you can, and if means, if the flesh cannot escape from the fracture of the ears, and their twisting, until it escapes.
And when you perform the extraction of the arrow, wherever it is, then use the twisting of your hand, with forceps to all sides, until you cause it to escape: and use the finest precision, so that the arrow is not broken, and its extraction becomes difficult for you.
If you cannot remove it within one hour, then leave it for several days, until those things surrounding it have rotted.
Then try again; for it will then be easier.  But if a contrary flow of blood hinders you, then use what we have stated in the healing chapter, and preserve your skill from the incision of a vein, or nerve, or tendon.
And use every means possible to extract the arrow; and let it be with ease and calmness, or with slowness and firmness, as I have told you.
And it is necessary, when you pull the arrow, that the patient be positioned according to the manner in which the arrow was lodged.
Because this is more helpful.
If, however, this is not possible for you, then use what is possible for you from the figures.
However, if an arrow emerges from the opposite side, or if something from it is already coming out externally; or if the arrowhead causes a swelling on the skin near the upper part, and you see it protruding; cut over it, and let the incision be according to the amount that the forceps can grip.
Then pull it out; for it will then become easy to extract.
If, however, it is retained in the bone, then turn your hand in a circular motion until the arrow is pressed into the bone and widens its way out; then pull it out.
And if not, leave it for a few days; then try again until it comes out.
If the arrow's shaft is in it, then drive it out with it.
If, however, the shaft has fallen off and you wish to administer an impulse, then introduce a concave instrument, so that its concavity enters the arrow's tail; then drive it out with it.
If the arrow is hollow, then drive it out with an instrument entering it.
For the arrow is relieved by it.
If the arrow is poisoned, then it is necessary to cauterize all the flesh in which the poison is, if it is possible for you to do so.
Then treat it with whatever is suitable for it.
If the arrow is lodged in the chest, or belly, or bladder, or side; and is close to the point you are touching with your probe, and it is possible for you to cut above it: then cut, and be cautious of cutting a vein or nerve, and remove it.
Then suture the wound, if you see fit, and treat it until it heals.
And this is the form of the forceps with which arrows are extracted.
Let the ends be similar to the beak of a bird, made of iron: when they grasp the arrow, they do not release it.
And many types are made from them, large, small, and medium, according to the size and smallness of the arrow, and the width and constriction of the wound.
The shape of the driving force is concave.
And the shape of the dull driver.
This is the blunt end, like a ray, so that its entrance into the concave arrow may be eased, and it may be driven with it.
The end of this concave driver is concave, like a bird's feather, so that the arrow's entry into it and its impetus may be eased.
Concerning the phlebotomy of veins.
Chapter XCVII. The veins to be opened, whose use runs through the body, are thirty.
Of these, sixteen are in the head: two pulsating veins, which are behind the ears, called the two Herbs; and two arteries, which appear in the two temples; and two veins that are in the two tear ducts of the two eyes, which are called the Lookers; and a prepared vein in the middle of the forehead; and the vein that is at the end of the nose.
And two Guidegi, which are in the neck.
And two veins that are in the upper lip of the mouth.
And two veins that are in the lower lip.
And these are the veins called Algecherich.
And two veins that are under the tongue.
The veins, however, which are opened in the arms, are five veins in each arm.
One of them is the Cephalic, and it is from the wild side: and the common people call it the head vein.
And the Fusca.
And is the Middle vein, and is composed of a branch of the Basilic, and a branch of the Cephalic: and the common people call it the body vein.
And the Basilic, and it is situated on the domestic side: and it is also called the Itching vein.
And the common people call it the belly vein.
And the arm cord, and it is placed above the fold: and it is that in which bloodletting is done, and it is that which appears above the thumb with clear manifestation.
And the Salvatella: and it is the vein that is between the ring finger and the little finger: and it has two branches.
And in the leg and in the foot there are three veins.
One of them is that which is under the curve of the thumb on the wild side.
And the second is the Saphena: and its place is at the heel on the domestic side.
And the vein Nesse: and its place is at the heel on the wild side.
And in the other leg there are three veins similar to those.
Concerning the phlebotomy of two veins behind the ears.
Phlebotomies of the two veins behind the ears are helpful for chronic colds, and for hemicrania, and for sahafati, and for old, bad head ulcers.
And the quality of the phlebotomy of it is according to what I relate.
And it is done that the patient's head is shaved, and his nape is rubbed in the place of the two veins with a rough cloth, a good rubbing.
Then the patient should tighten his neck with a bandage until the two veins appear.
And their locations are behind the ears in the two depressed places of the head.
Therefore, seek them with your finger, and where you feel their pulse beneath your finger, mark that spot with ink.
Then take the phlebotomy knife, and it is called the incider.
Then introduce it under the vein in the skin until the phlebotomous reaches the mouth.
Then elevate your hand with the vein and skin upwards, and cut the vein with the skin with an incident incision.
And let the length of the incision be the amount of two joined fingers, or about that: and make as much blood come out as you wish.
Then bind it with bandages, and leave it until it heals.
And already in the beginning of the book there was incision of them and cauterization of them.
Concerning the phlebotomy of two arteries in the temples.
The phlebotomy of the two arteries which are in the two temples is a help for old hemiplegia, and crooked neck, and persistent ophthalmia, and excessive flow of acute tears to the eyes. And the quality of phlebotomizing them is according to what I tell you.
Let the infirm person greatly strain his neck, until two veins become clearly apparent to the senses; and let their pulse be demonstrated beneath your finger.
Then mark the spots with ink.
Then lift the skin above the vein upwards with your index finger, and insert the lancet cutting underneath, and lift the vein upwards.
And cut it, just as you did in the other two veins: and make the blood flow according to your need. Then loosen the constriction of the infirm person, and place your finger on the vein for an hour.
Afterwards place a bandage and pads over it, and bind it tightly above the constriction: and leave it until it heals.
And already the recollection of them, and their incision, and their extraction are in the beginning of the book.
Concerning phlebotomy of the frontal vein after phlebotomy of the cephalic vein.
The benefit of phlebotomy of the frontal vein, after phlebotomy of the cephalic vein, is for old facial ailments: and for migraine, and redness: and foul ulcers.
And its quality of phlebotomy is as I describe to you.
The weak patient tightens his neck with a bandage until the vein appears.
Then take the instrument called a Fossorium.
Its form is this.
Place the prominent point that is on the head of the Fossorium above the very vein, and strike it with a comb, or with something else in its manner, and let the blood run according to the quantity that you wish.
Then release the wound of the sick person, and bind it, until it heals.
And sometimes it is opened with a wide phlebotome.
However, it should not be a phlebotome with a sharp tip, like the other phlebotomes, but rather one with a broad tip.
And lance it across, because the bone is near, and perhaps the phlebotome will break in it when it is slender.
Concerning the lancing of the veins in the two tear ducts.
The aid of the two veins that are in the two tear ducts of the two eyes is for the eye from scabies and redness; and swelling in the eye, and ailments of the face.
And the quality of lancing them is such that a weak person tightens their neck with a bandage.
Then lance them, and you stand over his head.
And the lancing should be made transverse to the length a little, with a small lancet, somewhat broad, for there is no flesh in the place.
For if the lancet is of slender form, perhaps it will break.
Then cause the blood to flow as much as you need.
And place a poultice on them, and bind them for one night, and then remove them.
Concerning the lancing of the veins of the nose.
The lancing of the veins of the nose is helpful in acute fevers, violent headaches, and facial ailments such as migraine and redness, especially when it is chronic.
And the quality of its bloodletting is such that the weak man should bind his neck.
Then hold his nose with your left hand, and take a thin, long lancet, and insert it into the middle of his nostril, between that which separates the nose according to its straightness.
Because the vein is not apparent to the senses there, and because blood begins to flow immediately.
And you should hold your hand with the lancet for a little while, and make the blood flow according to your need.
Then tie it with a bandage at night.
For it will quickly heal.
About the phlebotomy of the veins of Guidegi.
The phlebotomy of the two veins of Guidegi is helpful for the constriction of breathing, and the beginning of leprosy, and melancholic illnesses, and impetigo and bad ulcers, and those that gnaw, that is, shingles.
And the quality of the phlebotomy of them is that the weak person should be held with a bandage under both sides of their neck: and the skilled person should stand over the head of the sick person, and the sick person should be seated on a seat.
Then the phlebotomist should cut the vein to a length of ample phlebotomy for a short time.
Then extract from the blood a moderate quantity, or according to what you see as necessary for that.
Then do likewise with the other vein.
Afterwards, loosen the bandage, and bind the two veins with a middle constriction; so that the sick person is not choked.
And leave it until morning.
For the wound is healed.
Concerning the phlebotomy of veins, Algeberich.
Veins, according to Algeberich, are a help in phlebotomy, because they contribute to the removal of swelling in the mouth, and to the corruption of the gums; and to bad ulcers; and to the fissures of the lips, and to bad ulcers, even those that are on the nose and around it.
And the quality of phlebotomy of them is that you should make the sick person sit before you, and bind his neck with a bandage.
Then turn back his lip, and look at the two veins: of which one is on the right side of the lip, and the second on its left side; and the indication of both is by the blackness of both.
And that is true, because there are small, black veins around them.
Therefore, cut each with a single incision. However, if there is doubt upon you, and you do not know which of them it is, then aim at the incision of the larger of them, and the more evident of them.
And similarly do with the two veins which are in the upper lip: and indeed the custom runs most with it; and cut the two veins which are in the lower lip.
Concerning phlebotomy of the veins under the tongue after phlebotomy of the cephalic veins.
However, the benefit of phlebotomy of the two veins that are under the tongue is that phlebotomy of the cephalic vein is for the suffocations that are in the throat, and the illness of the uvula, and the illnesses of the mouth.
And the quality of phlebotomizing those is such that the sick person sits between your hands before the sun; and raise his tongue, and look under his tongue on one side of it a vein, and on the other side of it a vein; and the color of both is sloping to blackness.
Therefore phlebotomize each; and beware that you do not put your hand in the last stages of phlebotomizing them.
For under them are arteries, and perhaps a flow of blood will occur from those arteries.
Concerning the three veins in the elbow.
The three veins, however, which are phlebotomized in the elbow, are those in whose phlebotomy custom has run in all men.
And their phlebotomy is done according to two methods.
Either by puncturing with a broad myrtle phlebotomize: or olive to the subtlety of the slope: or by cutting with a knife phlebotomize, and it is Alnesil.
And this is its form.
So Alnesil is, what is suitable for the section.
And from them are species broad, and subtle according to the wideness of the veins and their constriction. The form of the myrtle phlebotomize be broad, as you see.
And it is suitable for opening concave, full, proceeding, apparent, large veins, and those that contain thick, turbid blood.
And this phlebotom is of less width, and more subtle extremities.
And it is suitable for the phlebotomy of thin veins, which contain thin, yellowish blood.
Of the phlebotomy of the Basilic vein.
The Basilic vein, which is one of these three veins, is a help in phlebotomy. Because it draws blood from illnesses of the throat and neck, from there following to the chest and abdomen; and it befits the phlebotomist, when phlebotomizing it, to be cautious and to be above fear from it, for beneath it is an artery.
Therefore, if he errs, and adds to the phlebotomy puncture, he will cut that artery, and a flood of blood will result.
Therefore, it is necessary that one not phlebotomize it with a phlebotomy-piercing instrument; rather, one should cut it with an Alnesil.
If the Basilic vein does not appear clearly, then it is necessary that one seek another, or substitute for it another, or seek a branch of it; or one should phlebotomize the brachial vein instead.
For it is manifest, and cut it with the phlebotomy Anesil, as we said.
If, however, you wish to phlebotomize that same one, then it is necessary before the constriction of the arm, that you touch the spot until you know the location of the pulse.
Then mark the spot with ink, afterward the arm, and cut the vein with a concave incision with a phlebotomy Alnesil, as we said.
And be careful that the blow does not fall within the space from the location of the artery.
And when you see, when you tighten the ligature, an inflation in the place you marked with ink, then that inflation is the inflation of the artery: therefore, avoid it.
If you see blood at the phlebotomy leap, like a child's urine, and it is thin blood, red: then know that it is from the artery's blood.
Then quickly place your finger on it for a long space, then remove your finger.
If therefore the blood is cut off (for it is often cut off), then tighten the arm, and release it; and let the sick person beware of its movement; and let it be upon his fear.
And do not move it for several days, until it is healed.
If however the blood is not cut off, and overcomes you; and there is no medicine present to you at your moment, then cut the artery, if it appears to you.
For its extremities are contracted, and the blood is cut off.
Or take a piece of fig bark, and split it; take one half, and bind it over the place of the vein's constriction in a fitting manner, with a bandage and dressings until another day.
Then if the blood is cut off, it is good.
And if not, then treat it with what preceded concerning the place of powders that cut off the flow of blood: and the cutting off of its blood is not difficult in many dispositions, because of the small place of the wound, and the possibility of a bandage from the arm.
Concerning the phlebotomy of the Fusca vein.
The phlebotomy of the Fusca vein is helpful, because it draws blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body, because it is composed of a branch of the Basilica vein and a branch of the Cephalic vein, as we said.
And it befits the phlebotomist that it be above fear from his phlebotomy, for a nerve is beneath it.
If therefore the phlebotomist adds in puncturing, and finds a nerve, there occurs numbness in it, and its healing becomes difficult, and perhaps it is not healed completely.
And this nerve often appears to the senses.
However, if it is hidden in some people, and is subtle, and is not shown: then it is necessary that you place your phlebotomy where you phlebotomize it, a section with Alnesil, and avoid the nerve with your strength.
If however the vein is between two nerves, then split the vein lengthwise.
Concerning the cephalic vein.
Phlebotomies of the cephalic vein are helpful, because they draw blood from the head, and contribute to illnesses of the eyes.
And it is necessary in this vein properly, if you wish, that you phlebotomize it by puncturing with an olive-wood phlebotome, or with a myrtle-wood phlebotome: because it is safer than all the veins, because there is no artery or nerve beneath it. However, it befits you in phlebotomy to avoid with the phlebotome the head of the biceps only, and to seek a gentler place; and it does not harm it if it is not found with the first stroke, so that it may be repeated on it with phlebotomy several times. However, perhaps it becomes abscessed in some people when it is not phlebotomized on the first stroke, but that abscess does not harm them in any way.
Concerning the usefulness of phlebotomy, and the precautions to be observed in it.
The quality of phlebotomy, and its accidents resulting from it, in whose correction you should consider.
First, therefore, it is something you should know that phlebotomy is not administered except in the preservation of health, and its persistence, and caution against the onset of illnesses.
And so that phlebotomy be done in one of the three veins that are in the elbow, namely, the Cephalic, and the Fusca, and the Basilic.
And so that phlebotomy be performed at the beginning of spring on an empty stomach, in spring, and in summer; and in autumn and winter after eating, when signs of fullness appear.
And phlebotomy be performed on the first day, or on the third, after three hours have passed of the day.
However, phlebotomy administered in illnesses does not have a set time; but when the appropriateness and necessity for it arise, at night, or by day, and at every hour, and at every time.
And it is not necessary that children be bled until they reach fourteen years.
Nor should a pregnant woman be bled, unless from the fourth to the seventh month.
Nor should the elderly be bled who have already passed sixty years.
Therefore, when someone wishes to be bled for any reason, it is necessary that they cleanse their bowels beforehand with a gentle clyster, if there is a great deal of retained feces in them, so that the veins during the bleeding do not draw out putrid impurities harmful to the major limbs from the bowels.
Nor should a patient be bled who has a toctina, that is, a sickness of satiety, nor the drunkard, nor someone recovering from drunkenness, until that is removed from them.
Nor the sick with dropsy.
And bleeding should be avoided again after colic, vomiting, diarrhea, and excessive sexual activity, labor, exercise, vigils, fasting, and anything that dissolves strength from the body or animal.
Then consider the subtlety of the humors before that, if the blood is thick with foods and drinks, and medications: if it is possible for him.
Then let him enter a bath, if nothing prevents him: or let him exercise with some exercise, so that the blood is made thinner.
And place his phlebotomy on his chest, around the third day, as we said: and endeavor that his chest be evacuated that day from all evil animal accidents: such as anguish, and anger, and fear: and from all bodily accidents, such as labor, and pain, and excess, and similar things.
And let him have present in his seat things with whose use the custom of men has run from aroma, and odor, and rejoicing, and things similar to them, to the extent possible.
Then let the phlebotomist sit on a cushion which is higher than the cushion of the phlebotomist; afterward let him draw his arm out, and let the phlebotomist rub it with his hand twice, or thrice.
Then tie the ligament with a strap, and wrap it twice.
And let the constriction be moderate, because when constriction is unequal, or by excess in the constriction, it then hinders the course of the blood; or in relaxation, it then also hinders the course of the blood.
Then after the constriction, it is necessary that the phlebotomist rub his hands together until the veins inflate and are evident to the senses.
Then the phlebotomist should wipe the phlebotomized area with a little old oil, properly.
Then he should place his left index finger slightly over the vein itself, under the place where he wants to phlebotomize, so that the vein does not move away and the blow is not missed.
Because there are veins which, like a fleeing chord in phlebotomy, and there are those which are full of airiness; and when you place the phlebotom knife upon them, they contract beneath the phlebotom knife, and the phlebotomist is deceived, and the phlebotom knife does not open the vein; and if it does open it, it is narrow.  Therefore it is necessary for the phlebotomist to be firm and careful in all these matters.
Then he should lay down the phlebotom knife.
And if not, then repeat it another time under that spot a little, or above it quickly, if the place is not already inflamed.
If it becomes inflamed, or the patient trembles, then leave him alone for a day or two, and do not tighten the bandage.
For perhaps it will draw the inflammation.
Nor let him enter a bath.
Then let him repeat phlebotomy, if he wishes.
If the opening is small, or the blood flows subtly, and you fear that not the amount of blood you desire will issue forth, then repeat the phlebotomy in the very aperture itself along the correct path, and add a little in the operation.
And do this quickly, before the place becomes inflamed, for an inflamed place is in many men at a small operation.
If, therefore, you see it already inflamed, then do not repeat on it at all, for it will not excuse anything for you. And place upon it something from the dregs of oil, for it alleviates the flow of blood.
And it is better in this place than the oil itself, and than other oils.
And similarly administer the dregs of oil in all your phlebotomies, whereby you phlebotomize veins against the prohibition of blood flow: and they do this, the *tyriaca alfarach* and *sagzenea*, when placed from one of them upon the place.
For blood is made thinner and resolved when it is thick.
If a large abscess occurs at the site of the phlebotomy, for it often happens, especially to one who is not a phlebotomist except in that instance, or the vein opening is small, then quickly place on the area a sponge soaked in water and salt, warmed slightly: and bind it for one hour: for it is resolved.
And it is necessary that you do this after the exit of blood from the vein itself, with its completion, or from another vein.
And very often abscesses and swellings occur at phlebotomy of the Basilica vein.
Therefore, place your hand upon it; then, if you find softness upon compression with your hand upon it, that swelling is bad.
Therefore, be careful to place something upon it of that which we have said.
For perhaps blood of the artery will flow from it.
But make a plaster for it with that in which there is astringency, so that the place may be hardened.
Then treat it with the rest of the treatment, until it is healed.
And it is necessary that you extract from every man's blood according to the quantity of its strength.
And that which appears from the color prevailing over the blood.
For if the blood is black, then let it go out until it turns red; and similarly if you see it thick, then let it go out until it becomes thin; and similarly if it is sharp, until its sharpness is removed.
And it is necessary for him who is full, strong, and needs bloodletting in one instance, that the phlebotomy of the vein be broadened, and that the phlebotomist be wide; and in him who is weak, let it be the opposite of that.
And it is necessary that he extract it in stages, and that the opening be narrow; and better that which is administered in the phlebotomy of the vein is that it be a transverse section, not a puncture.
And this method of bloodletting is safe from a flow of blood, and from the incision of a nerve; and is more praiseworthy, and safer than bloodletting by width and length.
And to whom it is accustomed to come near to fainting in phlebotomy, it is necessary that he eat before the phlebotomy a little bread soaked in pomegranate water; or secaniabin, if it is warmed; and extract from his blood in three or four stages.
And if he is of a cold complexion, then let him take before the bloodletting bread soaked in mulse syrup, or in a syrup of aromatized honey with spices, or in a fragrant aromatic syrup.
If fainting occurs during bloodletting, and the cause of it is the excessive outflow of blood, then it is necessary that he drink water of meat, and a subtle fragrant syrup; and let him use aromatics with althea, and let his chest be lined with it; and let him use the rest of what we said in the division in the chapter on fainting from evacuation.
Whoever wishes to purge their arm and release their blood a second time, it is necessary for one whose phlebotomy is for great evacuation, and whose strength is weak, to release the blood gradually according to the measure of strength over consecutive days.
Whoever wishes to purge their arm and release their blood a second time, and their body is strong, then let them do so after seven or nine hours from their first bloodletting.
Whoever wishes to draw blood from their body to the opposite part to which it inclines, it is necessary for them to be purged on the second or third day.
In whose body, however, there is much blood already heated and sharpened, and causing fever, it is necessary that blood depart from it in one instance, and that a large quantity be drawn out of it; and the opening be enlarged until fainting occurs; after you have observed all the conditions of bloodletting; and so that you place your hand upon his pulse at the flow of blood, so that death does not occur in place of fainting.
For often that happens, when the bloodletter is unaware and negligence occurs.
And it is not necessary, when wishing to purge an arm and release blood a second time, when the vein's opening is already closed and the blood's exit is difficult, to press upon it with force, and quickly bend or extend it.
For that is very harmful; indeed, leave it alone until it is bled a second time.
Or remove with sharpness the blood clot from the vein's opening, and place upon it some dissolved salt in water.
And place upon it something from the tyriaca alfaroch, or sagzenea, and apply gentle pressure, until blood emerges.
If however the vein is already inflamed, then leave it and do not touch it until the inflammation subsides.
If necessity compels you to release the blood a second time, and there is no excuse, then either bleed it above that spot, or in another vein in the other arm.
However, the arm's vein should be bled at the place of the Cephalic and Basilic veins, if they are not found, and are hidden, since it is composed of them.
And the quality of the bloodletting is such that the weak person should immerse their hand in warm water until the skin reddens and the vein becomes clearly visible.
Then, a ligature should be tightened over it with moderate constriction.
Then, bleed along the vein's cross-section gradually, not laterally, nor lengthwise: and let the opening be wide, and your bloodletting should be above the wrist joint for a short while.
And indeed, the flow of blood is greatly facilitated in warm water during the winter.
And bloodletting from this vein is safer than all veins, because there is no pulse or nerve beneath it.
Bloodletting from the Saluatella vein of the right hand is beneficial for liver ailments.
And the quality of its bloodletting is such that you should grasp the vein of the hand with a bandage, or with your hand, after you immerse it in warm water, until the vein swells and is clearly visible.
Then, the phlebotomist should cut across it.
And if you cut it completely, it will not harm him in any way.
And be careful not to injure your hand with the lancet.
For beneath it are the nerves of the fingers laid bare of flesh.
Then, return the hand to warm water, and let the blood flow in it.
For if you do not return it to warm water, the blood coagulates in the opening of the vein, and is prevented from flowing.
When therefore you have drawn out the necessary quantity of blood, then place oil and salt on the vein: so that it does not quickly solidify.
And similarly it is necessary to do with every constricted branch.
However, the benefit of phlebotomy from the left hand is: because it is beneficial for diseases of the spleen; and similarly do in its phlebotomy as you did in the second equally.
The benefit of saphenous vein phlebotomy is for illnesses located in the lower part of the body, such as uterine ailments, and retention of menses, and kidney ailments, and old sores of the hips and legs, and similar illnesses.
And the method of phlebotomy for it is that the patient put their foot into warm water: and make friction upon it until the veins protrude: and tie above the joint of the foot with a bandage.
And indeed the vein's location is near the heel, appearing towards the big toe: and branches from it into many branches on the front of the foot.
Therefore, phlebotomize it in its larger branch, or near the heel in its aggregation, because it is better and safer.
If you phlebotomize it on the front of the foot, then beware of the nerves that are beneath it on the front of the foot.
And place your phlebotomy instrument so that you phlebotomize it across, as if you wish to cut it: and let the phlebotomist be skilled.
If, however, the flow of blood is obstructed, then repeatedly immerse his foot in warm water, and allow the blood to flow into it until it is evacuated.
If the phlebotomist errs in the first attempt, then repeat the phlebotomy a little higher up, for the location is safe, and you have no fear of harm from it, when you are wary of the nerves, as we said.
And similarly with the Saphena of the other foot equally.
The Sciatic vein's location, as we said, is near the heel on the wild side.
And the relief of phlebotomy is for the pain of the ankle, when it is due to hot blood.
And the quality of its phlebotomy is that the sick person should enter a bath and hurry; and he should bind his leg from the side of the ankle up to above the heel by four fingers, with a long thin strip; for it does not appear except on that account.
Therefore, when it appears, then the phlebotomist should open it according to whatever method is possible for you, or by transverse incision; and it is better either to cut it by incision, or to divide it by section.
For its location is safer, and it is very hidden in many people.
If, however, you do not find it, and it does not appear to the senses at all, then the phlebotomist should open any branch of it, and that one which appears on the back of the foot, and towards the ear: and beware of the nerves, and make the blood run as much as you wish.
Then loosen the binding, and place a skin over the phlebotomy site, and bind the location.
For it heals quickly.
Concerning Cupping, and the nature of its use.
Chapter XCVIII.
Cupping instruments are made of horns, and of air, and of glass.
And cupping indeed is done according to two methods.
With scarification, and the extraction of blood: and the other is cupping without scarification. And this cupping which is without scarification, is according to two methods.
Or indeed it is with fire.
Or it is without fire.
And cuppings which are administered with scarification and blood extraction are fourteen places of the body.
Of which one is, the cupping of the Alnocrati, and it is behind the head; and Alkehel, and it is the middle of the neck; and the cuppings of the Alhagdahim, and they are two blades of the neck at two sides together; and the cuppings of the chin, and it is under the jaw at the lower mouth; and the cuppings of the two shoulder blades; and the cuppings of the Alachosos above the end of the tail; and the cuppings of the two armpits, and they are in the middle of the two arms; and the cuppings of the two thighs; and the cuppings of the two calves.
And cupping indeed does not extract blood from the small veins scattered in the flesh, and because of that no strength is lost from them, as happens with phlebotomy.
Nor should cupping, whether with or without fire, be administered in any illness resulting from fullness until the whole body is emptied.
If necessity prompts cupping from illness or custom, we administer it at any hour at the beginning of the month, at the end of it, and in the middle of it, and at whatever time it may be.
This is because there are men who, when blood multiplies within them to the point of needing extraction by cupping, find heaviness and throbbing in their head.
And among them are those who find fullness and redness in their face, head, and neck.
And among them are those who find itching in their face and forehead, and darkness and dullness in their eyes.
And among them is one who scratches the site of their cupping. And among them is one whose laughter multiplies.
And among them is one who finds the taste of blood in their mouth: or the tongue becomes suppurated, and expels blood.
And among them is one whose sleep multiplies.
And among them is one who sees in their sleep blood and redness, and slain ones, and wounds, and things similar to those. Therefore, when we see something like this, and especially if it is in the third middle part of the month, we then order that a wind-drawing procedure be carried out after two or three hours have passed during the day. The benefit of neck cupping is that it contributes to the heaviness in the head and that which flows to the eyes.
