 CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT.
On the excision of superfluous growths on the gum.
 There often grows on the gum superfluous flesh which the Ancients call 'epulis'.
You should take it up with a hook or grasp it with forceps and cut it at its root and let the pus or blood flow out.
Then put on the place either pounded vitriol or one of the absorbent styptic powders.
And if the growth returns after treatment—for they often return—excise a second time and cauterize; it will not come back after cauterization.
