Chapter Thirty-Four.
On Cauterizing Hemorrhoids of the Anus.
If there are many chronic hemorrhoids in the anus, or one, and they are from thick cold humors or corrupt humidities, and they have been treated with what we mentioned in the division, but the treatment has not been successful, then cauterize the patient three times on the lower vertebrae, slightly below the "table," in a triangular shape.
And cauterize below the navel at a distance of two fingers. And if you estimate that his stomach has become cold, and his food is not being digested, and you see that his face is swollen, then cauterize him on the stomach with a large cauterization, as has been described before, and cauterize his liver.
And another on his spleen, with a nail-shaped cautery iron. And leave the cauterization open for a while. Then treat him until he recovers, God willing.
