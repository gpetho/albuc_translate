Chapter Ten.
On cauterizing for epilepsy.
Only the epileptic whose epilepsy is caused by phlegm should be cauterized.  First, his brain should be cleansed with strong purgatives and all the other treatments that we mentioned in the appropriate section, if the patient is an adult and can tolerate taking the medications.
If, however, he is a child who cannot tolerate medications, he should use gargles and masticatories that cleanse the brain for many days beforehand, along with improving his diet.
Then his head is shaved, and then cauterize him with a single cautery in the middle of the head, as described previously in the instructions, and another cautery at the back of his head.
And on each side of his head, a cauterization. If the patient is strong and can tolerate it, cauterize him with the cauterizations mentioned for the one who suffers from hemiplegia and looseness of the body on the vertebrae of the neck and vertebrae of the back.  The cautery should be olive-shaped, as previously described.
If the patient is a child, make the cautery delicate, in this manner.
