of hermaphrodites	On the treatment of the hermaphrodite.	0.4441322
Hermaphroditism occurs in two ways in men: one is that between the two testicles appears something like the form of a woman's nature, where there is hair, and sometimes urine flows there.	There are two kinds of male hermaphrodite: one has the appearance as of female pudenda with hair in the region of the perineum; the other has the same in the skin of the scrotum between the testes. Sometimes also urine is excreted through that which is in the skin of the scrotum.	0.80119693
And the other way is in women, and they have on the pubis something like a penis and two testicles.	There is also one kind among women, in which there is, above the female pudenda, on the pubes, what resembles the male organs.	0.6621182
And the treatment for the man and the woman is that you cut away all the extra flesh, and treat them like other wounds; in the second type, of men whose urine spurts from the skin of the testicles, there is no cure.	This is the treatment of all three kinds, that is, two male and one female: the superfluous growths must be cut away so that every trace is destroyed; then the usual treatment for wounds should be applied until they are healed. As to the second kind, in man, where the opening is in the scrotum and the urine runs out of it, there is no operation for this, and no cure.	0.7386311
