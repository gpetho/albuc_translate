of hermaphrodites
Hermaphroditism exists in two ways in humans:
one is that between the two testicles appears something like the form of a woman's nature, where there is hair, and sometimes urine flows there.
And the other type is in women, and they have above the pubis something like a penis and two testicles. 
And the treatment for the man and the woman is that you cut away all the added flesh and treat them like other wounds;
in the second type, for men whose urine spurts through the skin of the testicles, there is no cure.
