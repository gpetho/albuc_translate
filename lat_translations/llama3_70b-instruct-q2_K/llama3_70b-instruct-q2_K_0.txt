Praefatio.	Foreword.
Postquam compleui uobis o Filii, librum hunc, qui est postremus scientiae in medicina cum complemento ipsius, et consecutus sum finem in eo, ex expositionibus eius, et ipsius declarationibus, uisum est mihi, ut compleam ipsum uobis cum hoc Tractatu qui est pars operationis, id est, chirurgiae cum manu.	After I had completed for you, my sons, this book, which is the final part of the science in medicine with its complement, and I had reached the end in it, through its explanations and declarations, it seemed to me that I should complete it for you with this treatise, which is a part of the operation, that is, surgery with manual skill.
Quoniam operatio cum manu prostrata est in regione nostra, et tempore nostro priuata omnino: donec fortasse periit scientia eius, et abscissum est uestigium eius: et non remanserunt ex ea, nisi descriptiones paruae in libris antiquorum, quas mutauerunt manus: et accidit eis error et haesitatio, donec clausae sunt intentiones eius, et elongata est uis ipsius: Visum est mihi, ut uiuificem eam cum ordinatione huius Tractatus in ea secundum uiam ex positionis, et declarationis, et abbreuiationis: et ut ueniam cum formis ferramentorum Cauterii, et reliquorum instrumentorum operis: cum fit ex declarationis additione, et ex properatione eius quod est necesse.	Since the operation with manual skill was prostrate in our region and completely deprived of it at that time; so perhaps its science had perished, and its investigation was cut off. And there did not remain from it except small descriptions in ancient books, which were altered by hand. And errors and hesitations occurred, until its intentions were locked up and its utility was prolonged. It seemed to me that I should revive it with the arrangement of this treatise, according to the method of positions, declarations, and abbreviations. And that I should bring it together with the forms of cauterium and other instruments of work; so that it would be fitting from the declarations added, and from its proper preparation, which is necessary.
Caussa autem propter quam non inuenitur bonus artifex eius cum manu sua in hoc nostro tempore, est: quia ars medicinae est longa, et oportet auctorem eius exercitari ante illud in scientia anatomiae, quam narrauit Galenus, donec sciat iuuamenta membrorum, et ipsorum formas, et eorum coniunctionem, et separationem, et habeat cognitionem ossium, et neruorum, et lacertorum, et numerum ipsorum, et eorum egressionem, et uenarum pulsatilium, et quietarum, et locorum exitus earum.	The reason why a good manual skill operator is not found in our time is: because the art of medicine is long and it is necessary for its author to be exercised beforehand in the science of anatomy, as Galen described, so that he may know the juices of the members, and their forms, and their connections, and separations, and have knowledge of bones, and nerves, and tendons, and their number, and their emergence, and of veins, pulsating and quiet, and of the outlets of these.
Et propter illud dixit Hippocrates, quod nomen cum nomine est multum, et cum opere est paucum, et praecipue in arte manus.	And because of that, Hippocrates said that a name with a name is much, and with work is little, and especially in the art of manual skill.
Nos uero iam diximus de illo in introitu huius libri.	We have already spoken about this at the beginning of this book.
Quoniam qui non est sciens, quod diximus de anatomia, non euacuatur, quin iam cadat in errorem, quo interficiuntur homines: sicut ego uidi multos ex illis, qui formantur de hac scientia, et iactant se de ea absque scientia, et sine experimento.	Since one who is not knowledgeable about what we said concerning anatomy will not be cautious, lest he already falls into error, by which people are harmed: just as I have seen many of those who boast about this science and claim to know it without knowledge and without experience.
Quod est, quia uidi medicum stolidum secuisse apostema scrophulosum in collo mulieris, et incidit quasdam arterias in collo: quare fluxit sanguis mulieris, donec cecidit mortua inter manus eius.	What happened was that a foolish doctor cut open an abscessed scrofulous swelling on the neck of a woman, and he severed certain arteries in her neck; as a result, the woman's blood flowed out, until she died in his hands.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui praesumpsit ut extraheret lapidem uiro, qui processerat in aetate, et lapis erat magnus.	And another foolish doctor, who presumed to extract a stone from a man's bladder, which had been tormenting him for years, and the stone was large.
Peruenit ergo ad eum, et extraxit ipsum cum frusto uesicae.	He approached him therefore, and extracted it with a fragment of the bladder.
Quare mortuus est uir in tertio die.	For which reason the man died on the third day.
Et ego quidem iam uocatus fueram ad extrahendum ipsum: et uidi ex magnitudine lapidis, et dispositione infirmi, quod moriretur.	And I was already called in to extract it: and I saw from the size of the stone, and the condition of the sick man, that he would die.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui accipiebat stipem apud quendam Ducum terrae nostrae propter medicinam: et accidit eunucho nigro, qui erat apud ipsum, fractura in crure eius prope calcaneum: et properauit medicus cum ignorantia sua, et strinxit fracturam super uulnus cum puluinaribus, et astellis strictura forti, et non dimisit uulneri expirationem.	And I saw another doctor, who was receiving a stipend from a certain Duke of our land for his medical services: and it happened to a black eunuch who was with him, that he suffered a fracture in his leg near the ankle; and the doctor, with his ignorance, treated the fracture above the wound with poultices, and tight bandages, and did not allow the wound to breathe.
Deinde absoluit eum secundum desyderia sua.	Then he abandoned him according to his despair.
Postea dimisit eum diebus aliquot, et praecepit ei, ne solueret ligamentum: et stetit sic donec apostematum est crus eius, et ipsius pes, et peruenit ad perditionem.	Afterwards he left him for several days, and instructed him not to loosen the bandage: and it remained thus until his leg became abscessed, and his foot as well, and he went to ruin.
Vocatus sum ergo ad eum: et properaui ad soluendum ligamentum: et consecuta est tranquillitas, et euasit a doloribus suis.	I was therefore called in to him: and I approached to loosen the bandage: and calmness followed, and he was freed from his pains.
Verumtamen corruptio iam confirmata erat in membro: et non potui refraenare ipsam.	However, the corruption had already become established in the limb: and I could not restrain it.
Pon ergo cessauit corruptio perambulare in membro, donec periit.	Then the corruption ceased to spread through the limb, until he died.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui perforauit apostema cancerosum: et ulceratum est post dies, donec magnificata est malicia eius cum domino ipsius.	And I saw another doctor, who pierced a cancerous abscess: and it became ulcerated after a few days, until the evil of his disease was magnified with his lord.
Quod est, quia quando est cancer purus ex humore melancholico, tunc non oportet ut perueniatur ad eum cum ferro omnino, nisi sit in membro quod toleret, ut abscindatur totum eius.	What is, because when there is a pure cancer from melancholic humor, then it is not suitable to be cauterized with iron at all, unless it is in a member that can tolerate it, so that the whole of it may be excised.
Et propter illud o Filii, necesse est uobis, ut sciatis, quod operatio cum manu diuiditur in duas diuisiones: scilicet, operationem cui associatur salus: et operationem, cum qua est periculum in pluribus dispositionibus.	And because of that, O sons, it is necessary for you to know that the operation with the hand is divided into two divisions: namely, an operation to which health is associated, and an operation in which there is danger in many dispositions.
Et ego iam excitaui in omni loco huius libri, in quo uenit operatio, in qua est terror et timor.	And I have already warned in every place of this book, where an operation comes, which is accompanied by terror and fear.
Quare necesse est uobis, ut caueatis illud, et dimitatis ipsum: ut non inueniant stolidi uiam ad loquendum, et dehonestandum.	Therefore it is necessary for you to beware of that and dismiss it, so that the stupid ones do not find a way to speak and to deceive.
Accipite ergo mensuram cum sollicitudine et protectione, et infirmos uestros cum facilitate et firmitudine, et utimini uia meliore perducente gratia Dei ad salutem et successionem laudabilem: et dimittite aegritudines terribiles difficilis sanationis: et tollite animas uestras ab eo quod facit uos timere, ut ingrediatur super uos haesitatio in fide uestra et commodo uestro.	Receive therefore the measurement with solicitude and protection, and your patients with facility and firmness, and may you walk in a better way, thanks to the favor of God, for salvation and laudable succession: and dismiss terrible illnesses of difficult healing: and lift up your spirits from that which makes you fear, so that hesitation does not creep into your faith and your comfort.
Est enim magis remanens ad gloriam uestram, et sublimius in mundo isto, et postremo ad quantitates uestras.	For it is more remaining to your glory, and sublime in this world, and finally to your quantities.
Galenus enim iam dixit in quibusdam suis admonitionibus.	For Galen has already said so in certain of his admonitions.
Non medicetis aegritudinem malam: ne nominemini medici mali.	Do not heal the bad illness: lest you be named a bad doctor.
Iam autem diuisi hunc Tractatum secundum tria Capitula. Â¶	Now indeed I have divided this Treatise into three Chapters.
Capitulum primum.	Chapter One.
De Cauterio cum igne, et Cauterio cum medicina acuta, capitulatum, et ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum, et ferramentis Cauterii: et omni quod necessarium est in operatione. Â¶	About Cauterization with fire, and Cauterization with sharp medicine, chaptered and arranged from head to foot, and the forms of instruments, and the tools of Cauterization: and all that is necessary in the operation.
Capitulum secundum.	Chapter Two.
De sectione et perforatione, phlebotomia et uentosis, et uulneribus: et extractione sagittarum, et similibus illius: et totum capitulatum, ordinatum formis instrumentorum. Â¶	About section and perforation, phlebotomy and venesection, and wounds: and the extraction of arrowheads, and similar things: and all chaptered, arranged in forms of instruments.
Capitulum tertium.	The third chapter.
De restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus illius: capitulatum, ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum.	About restoration and dislocation, and the treatment of twisting, and similar things: a chapter arranged from head to foot, and the forms of instruments.
Soli Deo Gloria.	To God alone be glory.
Liber Chirurgici Albucasis.	The Surgical Book of Albucasis.
Pars I.	Part I.
Â¶ De Iuuamento, et Nocumento Cauterii: et quibus complexionibus conueniat, et quo tempore: et si cum ferro, uel auro.	About cauterization and burning: and with which complexions it is suitable, and at what time: and whether with iron or gold.
Caput I.	Chapter I.
Sed Ante Quidem Quam rememorer operationis cum eo, oportet ut dicam qualitatem Iuuamentorum eius, et Nocumentorum ipsius: et in qua complexione exhibeatur.	But before I discuss the operation with it, it is necessary that I describe the quality of its cauterizations and burnings: and in what complexions they are exhibited.
Dico ergo, quod sermo de qualitate iuuamenti Cauterii, et nocumenti eius, est sermo prolixus, et subtilis, scientia, et secretum occultum.	I say therefore that the discourse on the quality of cauterization by burning and its harm is a profound, subtle, scientific, and hidden secret.
Etiam locuta fuit in eo multitudo sapientum, et dissenserunt in eo: et mihi quidem sufficit parum ex sermonibus eorum, timens prolongationem.	Many wise men have also spoken about it, and they have disagreed about it; and for me, a little of their discourses is enough, fearing prolixity.
Dico ergo, quod Cauterium confert uniuersaliter omni complexioni, quae est cum materia, et absque materia: excaeptis duabus complexionibus, quae sunt complexio calida absque materia, et complexio sicca absque materia.	I say therefore that cauterization is universally beneficial to every complexion, which is with matter and without matter; except for two complexions, which are hot complexions without matter and dry complexions without matter.
In complexione autem calida et sicca cum materia dissenserunt.	In hot and dry complexions with matter, they disagreed.
Quidam enim dixerunt, quod Cauterium iuuatiuum est in ea.	For some said that cauterization is beneficial in them.
Et dixerunt alii contrarium illius, scilicet quod Cauterium non est conueniens in aegritudine, quae est ex caliditate et siccitate: quoniam natura ignis est caliditas: et inconueniens est, ut sanetur ex agritudine calida et sicca, cum calido et sicco.	And others said the opposite, namely that cauterization is not suitable for an illness which arises from heat and dryness; because the nature of fire is heat, and it is unsuitable to be cured by a hot and dry cauterization, with hot and dry.
Et dixit ille qui dicit contrarium illius: quod per Cauterium fit iuuamentum in omni aegritudine calida et sicca, quae accidit in corporibus hominum: quoniam quando tu comparas corpus hominis, et humiditates eius, ad complexionem ignis, inuenis corpus hominis frigidum.	And he who said the opposite of this said that through cauterization a cure is made in every hot and dry illness which occurs in the bodies of men; because when you compare the body of man and its humidities to the complexion of fire, you find the body of man to be cold.
Et ego quidem dico per sermonem eius: quia ex perimentum iam detexit mihi illud aliquotiens.	And I certainly say this through his discourse: because it was already discovered by him through experiment, and he showed me that many times.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut ueniat super illud, nisi qui iam probatus est, et exercitatus in capitulo Cauterii exercitio ultimo, et cognouit diuersitatem complexionum hominum, et dispositionem aegritudinum in se ipsis, et caussas earum, et accidentia ipsarum, et spacium temporis earum.	However, it is not suitable to proceed with that unless one has already been tested and exercised in the chapter on cauterization, and has recognized the diversity of human complexions, and the disposition of illnesses in themselves, and their causes, and the accidents that befall them, and the space of time for each.
Ex reliquis autem complexionibus non est super uos timor: et praecipue in aegritudinibus frigidis et humidis.	But among the remaining complexions, there is no fear over these: and especially in illnesses that are cold and moist.
Iam enim conuenerunt omnes medici super eas: et non dissenserunt in iuuamento cum Cauterio in eis.	For all doctors have agreed on these: and they did not disagree with Cauterius in their judgment about them.
Et scitote filii, quod ex secreto curationis per Cauterium cum igne, et bonitate eius super Cauterium cum medicina comburente est: quoniam ignis est simplex, cuius actio non peruenit, nisi ad membrum quod cauterisatur: et non nocet membro alio coniuncto cum eo, nisi nocumento paruo.	And you should know, my sons, that the secret of curing through Cauterium with fire and its goodness is superior to Cauterium with combustible medicine: because fire is simple, whose action does not penetrate except to the member that is cauterized; and it does not harm another member connected to it, unless with a small injury.
Medicinae uero comburentis actio peruenit ad illud quod elongatur ex membris: et fortasse facit accidere in membro aegritudinem difficilis sanationis, et fortasse interficit.	On the other hand, the action of combustible medicine penetrates to that which is extended from the members; and perhaps it causes difficulty in healing the illness in the member, and perhaps it even worsens it.
Ignis autem propter subtilitatem suam et bonitatem substantiae suae, non facit illud, nisi superfluat.	Fire, however, because of its subtlety and goodness of its substance, does not do that, unless it is in excess.
Iam uero innotuit nobis illud per experimentum, propter longitudinem seruitutis et studii cum arte, et stationem super ueritatem rerum: et propter illud excusor a longitudine sermonis.	However, I have made it known to you through experience, because of the length of service and study with art, and standing on the truth of things: and because of that, I excuse myself from the length of the discourse.
Et si non esset, quia non licet huic libro meo, afferrem uobis secretum occultum in igne, et qualitatem operationis eius in corporibus expulsionis suae, qua expellit aegritudines sermone philosophico demonstratiuo, qui acueretur a mentibus uestris.	And if it were not so, because it is not permitted in this book of mine, I would bring to you the hidden secret in fire, and the quality of its operation in expelling bodily illnesses, which drives out diseases through philosophical demonstration, which would be impressed upon your minds.
Et scitote filii, quod ipsi dissentiunt in tempore, in quo conuenit fieri cauterium, et ponunt melius tempus ueris.	And you should know, my sons, that they disagree on the time in which it is suitable to perform cauterization, and they set a better time for spring.
Et ego dico, quod cauterium conuenit in omni tempore: propterea, quod nocumentum accidens propter tempus submergitur in iuuamento, quod attrahitur cum cauterio.	And I say that cautery is suitable at all times; therefore, because the harm which occurs due to the time being submerged in the injury is attracted along with the cautery.
Et praecipue si cauterium est propter dolores ex doloribus necessariis, fortibus, festinis, qui non tolerant tarditatem: propterea quod timetur ex eis, quod accidat malicia quae est maior, quam paruum nocumentum intrans propter tempus.	And especially if the cautery is due to pains from necessary painful affections, strong, urgent, which do not tolerate delay: therefore because it is feared that a greater evil may occur, than a small harm entering through the time.
Et non cadat in mentibus uestris o filii illud, quod non extimant, nisi uulgus et stolidi medici, scilicet quod illi aegritudini quae sanatur per cauterium, non est reditio semper: et ponunt illud consequens, et res non est sicut putant: propterea quod cauterium non est, nisi loco medicinae, quae alterat complexionem, et exiccat humiditates quae sunt caussae, quare accidunt dolores.	And do not let it enter your minds, O sons, that they do not think, unless they are foolish and stupid doctors, namely that those affections which are healed by cautery are not always cured: and they place this consequence, and the thing is not as they think: therefore because cautery is not, unless in place of medicine, which alters the complexion and dries out the humidities which are the causes, whence pains occur.
Verumtamen cauterium superfluit super medicinam per uelocitatem ualetudinis suae, et uirtutem suae operationis, et uehementiam dominii sui: et possibile est, ut redeat aegritudo hora aliqua temporis secundum complexionem infirmi, et locationem aegritudinis suae, et uirtutem eius: et quod praeparatur in corpore eius ex aggregatione superfluitatum in eo: et quod peruenit ad ipsum in acquisitione sua ex cibis, et similibus illis ex caussis, nisi fit aegritudo, in qua administratur cauterium.	However, cautery is superior to medicine due to the swiftness of its healing, and the virtue of its operation, and the vehemence of its mastery: and it is possible that the disease may return at some time according to the complexion of the infirm person, and the location of their disease, and its virtue: and what is prepared in their body from an aggregation of superfluities in it: and what reaches them in their acquisition from food, and similar things from causes, unless there is a disease in which cautery is administered.
Aegritudo subtilis in membro paucarum superfluitatum, et humiditatum, sicut cauterium dentis, propter dolorem, et similia illi, possibile est enim, ut non redeat in eo ille dolor.	A subtle disease in a few members with superfluity and humidity, such as cautery of the tooth, due to pain, and similar things, it is possible indeed that the pain may not return in it.
Sed illud fit in paucis.	But that happens in a few.
At uero sermo uulgi iterum, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, est sermo rectus: non ad illud quod ipsi intendunt in illo: quoniam ipsi credunt, quod non est curatio quae conferat cum medicina, neque cum alio post occasum cauterii.	But truly, the common speech is wrong, that cautery is the last resort of medicine, is a correct speech: not to what they themselves intend in it: because they believe that there is no cure which can be conferred with medicine, nor with anything else after the occasion of cautery.
Res autem est econtrario illius, et intentio, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, non est, nisi quod quando nos administramus modos curationis in aliqua aegritudinum, et non conferunt illae medicinae: deinde administramus in fine rei cauterium, et confert: tunc inde cadit, quod cauterium est postremum mediciuae, non secundum intentionem quam intelligunt uulgus et multistolidorum medicorum.	The truth is the opposite of that, and the intention, which is that cauterization is the last resort in medicine, is not so, unless when we administer methods of treatment in some disease, and they do not contribute to those medicines: then we administer cauterization at the end, and it helps: thus it follows that cauterization is the last resort in medicine, not according to the intention that the common people and many stupid doctors understand.
Antiqui autem dixerunt, quod cauterium cum auro est melius, quam cauterium cum ferro: et non dixerunt illud, nisi propter aequalitatem auri, et sublimitatem substantiae suae: et dixerunt, quod non facit pus locus cauterii.	The ancients said that cauterization with gold is better than cauterization with iron: and they did not say this except because of the equality of gold and the subtlety of its substance: and they said that it does not create pus at the site of the cauterization.
Verum non est illud absolute: quoniam ego iam probaui illud, et inueni, quod ipsum non facit illud in quibusdam corporibus absque aliis.	That is not absolutely true: because I have already tested it and found that it does not do so in certain bodies without others.
Et cauterium cum ipso est bonum, et melius quam cum ferro, sicut dixerunt.	And cauterization with gold itself is good, and better than with iron, as they said.
Verumtamen quando tu ignis cauterium in igne ex auro, non declaratur tibi, quando ignitur secundum quantitatem quam uis, propter rubedinem auri: et quando properat ad ipsum frigus, et si addis super ipsum ignitionem, liquescit in igne, et uertitur in laminas.	However, when you ignite cauterization fire with gold, it is not declared to you, when it is ignited according to the quantity that you wish, because of the redness of the gold: and when it approaches the cold, and if you add ignition on top of it, it melts in the fire and turns into plates.
Quare cadit artifex ex illo in occupationem: et propter illud fit Cauterium cum ferro apud nos uelocius et propinquius, ex rectitudine ad operationem.	Therefore the artisan falls from that into occupation: and because of that, cauterization with iron is more familiar and closer to us, from correctness to operation.
Et ego quidem iam ordinaui hoc Capitulum in Cauterio, secundum capitula: et ordinaui ea a capite usque ad pedes: ut alleuient quaerenti illud quod uult ex eo.	And I have already arranged this Chapter on Cautery, according to chapters: and I have arranged them from head to foot, so that they may alleviate the one seeking what he wants from it.
Â¶ De modo cauterizandi Caput in commissura coronali.	Concerning the method of cauterizing the Head at the crown of the commissure.
Caput II.	Head 2.
Confert hic cauterizatio ad dominium humiditatis et frigiditatis super cerebrum: quae duae sunt caussae sodae, et multitudinis fluxus humorum ex capite ad partes oculorum et aurium, et multitudinis somni, et doloris dentium, et doloris gutturis: et uniuersaliter omnis aegritudinis, quae accidit ex frigiditate, sicut paralisis, et sodae, epilepsiae, et apoplexiae, et similia illis ex aegritudinibus.	Here cauterization is beneficial for dominating humidity and coldness over the brain: which are two causes of swellings, and multitude of fluxes of humors from the head to the parts of the eyes and ears, and multitude of sleepiness, and pain of the teeth, and pain of the throat: and universally all diseases that occur from coldness, such as paralysis, and swellings, epilepsy, and apoplexy, and similar ones from diseases.
Modus cauterizationis est, ut praecipias infirmo: ut euacuetur in primis cum medicina solutiua mundificante caput tribus noctibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod exigit uirtus infirmi, et eius aetas, et consuetudo eius.	The method of cauterization is to warn the patient beforehand: to evacuate with soothing medicine that cleanses the head for three or four nights, according to what the strength of the patient demands, and their age, and their habit.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radi faciat caput suum cum nouacula.	Then advise him to shave his head with a razor.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas quadratum, ita quod iam posuit manus suas super pectus suum.	Then make him sit between your hands in a square shape, so that he has already placed his hands on his chest.
Deinde pone radicem palmae tuae super radicem nasi sui inter oculos suos.	Then place the root of your palm on the root of his nose between his eyes.
Vbicumque ergo peruenerit digitus tuus medius, signa locum illum cum incausto.	Wherever your middle finger has reached, mark that place with a cautery.
Deinde igni Cauterium Oliuare: cuius haec est forma.	Then apply the olive oil cautery, whose form this is.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum signatum cum incausto, descensione, qua constringatur manus tua paulatim, et tu reuolues ipsum.	Then place it (the cautery) on the marked spot with the incision, descending gradually, and you turn it while your hand is contracting slowly.
Deinde leua manum tuam uelociter, et aspicias locum.	Then lift your hand quickly, and look at the place.
Quod si uides iam detegi ex osse quantitatem capitis alkiel, aut quantitatem zeuherbi, tunc eleua manum tuam.	If you see that a quantity of skull or a quantity of zeal has already been detected from the bone, then lift your hand.
Et si non, itera manum tuam ferro ipso, aut cum alio ab ipso si infrigidatur: donec uideantur ossa, quae dixi tibi.	And if not, repeat with the iron itself, or with another from the same if it is chilled: until you see the bones, which I told you about.
Deinde sume aliquid ex sale, et solue illud in aqua, et imbibe in ipso cotum, et pone super locum: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then take something from salt, and dissolve it in water, and soak a dressing in it, and place it on the spot: and leave it for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, et dimitte illum super locum, donec destruatur eschara ignis.	Then put a dressing soaked in butter on top of it, and leave it on the spot until the eschar (scab) of fire is destroyed.
Deinde cura illud cum unguento tetrapharmacon, usquequo sanetur.	Then treat it with Tetrapharmacum ointment until it heals.
Iam dixerunt, quod quanto uulnus plus remanet apertum, emittit pus: quare est melius et magis iuuatiuum.	Now I have said, that as long as the wound remains open, it discharges pus: therefore it is better and more helpful.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum, ut cauterizetur cutis usque ad os: et teneatur Cauterium, donec aduratur quiddam spissitudinis ossis.	And some of them have said that the skin should be cauterized up to the bone: and the cautery should be held until something of the density of the bone is felt.
Deinde radatur post illud quod adustum est ex osse, deinde curetur.	Then scrape off what is adhering to the bone, then cleanse.
Et dicunt alii, quod oportet ut cum cauterio perueniatur ad ultimum, donec imprimat in os impressionem for tem, ita quod cadat os, quod fit sicut forma kirate: aut instrumentum quod mulieres ponunt infuso alphabeti parui: et extimant, quod exspirantur ex hoc loco uapores capitis, et dimittatur uulnus apertum tempore longo.	And others say that it is necessary to burn with a cautery until the end, until it makes an impression on the bone, so that the bone becomes like a shell: or an instrument which women use, inserting a small alphabet infusion; and they think that vapors are exhaled from this place, and the open wound is left for a long time.
Deinde curetur, donec consolidetur.	Then it should be cleansed, until it becomes consolidated.
Mihi autem non uidentur hae duae species Cauterii omnino nisi in quibusdam hominibus secundum uiam timoris.	To me, however, these two types of cauterization do not seem to be suitable except for certain men according to the way of fear.
Et dimittere ipsum, apud me est melius cum salute ipsius.	And to leave it alone is better with me, in accordance with his own health.
Debilitatur enim caput ex solutione continuitatis ipsius naturalis: sicut testificati sumus in reliquis membris: et praecipue quando caput infirmi debile est natura: et species quidem Cauterii prima est magis salua et melior apud me, et ea utor: operare ergo cum ea in salute.	For the head is weakened by the dissolution of its natural continuity; as we have testified to in other members; and especially when the head of the infirm is weak by nature. And indeed the first species of Cauterization is more salutary and better with me, and I use it, operating thus for health.
Â¶ De modo cauterizandi capitis in dolore totius capitis.	Concerning the method of cauterizing the head in pain of the whole head.
Caput III.	Head 3.
Quando in toto Capite accidit dolor chronicus: et prolongatur illud in infirmo, et utitur hyeris, et cochiis, et caputpurgiis, et oleis, et empleumatis.	When chronic pain occurs in the whole head, and it is prolonged in the weak, and they use hiera, and cochia, and purging of the head, and oils, and emplasters.
Et praecipue si iam cauterizatum est cauterio uno, quod narrauimus, et non confert ei aliquid ex illis: tunc considera.	And especially if it has already been cauterized with one cautery, which we have described, and nothing among those things helps it: then consider.
Nam si caput infirmi est fortis creationis natura, et non est debile, et inuenit frigus uehemens: tunc cauteriza cum cauterio alio sub illo parum.	For if the head of the weak person is strong by nature's creation, and it is not weak, and it finds a vehement cold: then cauterize with another cautery under that, a little.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio, do nec pertranseat cutis, et discooperiatur ex osse quantitas, quam narrauimus.	Then cauterize it above every horn of his head with a cautery, so that the skin does not perforate, and a quantity is disclosed from the bone, as we have described.
Et cauteriza ipsum cauterio uno in occipitio capitis sui, in loco qui nominatur uas: et est locus in quo ponitur uentosa: et eleua matum tuam in hoc, et non discooperias os.	And you should cauterize him with a cautery iron on the back of his head, in the place that is called "uas"; and it is the place where a vein is located; and lift your hand from this, and do not uncover the bone.
Infirmus enim inuenit propter illud dolorem uehementem, et diuersum a dolore reliquorum cauteriorum capitis omnium.	For the weak man finds relief from that severe pain, and it is different from the pain of the remaining cauteries on the entire head.
Et ego dicam hoc Cauterium in loco suo: et oportet quod sit cauterium, quo cauterizantur cornua capitis, et occiput eius subtilius cauterio, quo cauterizatur medium capitis.	And I will say that this cautery is in its place; and it is necessary that it should be a cautery, with which the horns of the head are cauterized, and his occiput is more subtly cauterized than the middle of the head.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Â¶ De modo cauterizandi in hemicrania, tam cum medicina adustiua, quam cum ferro.	On the method of cautery on the half-crown, both with dry medicine and with iron.
Caput IIII.	Head 4.
Quando accidit in parte capitis dolor et soda, aut extenditur dolor usque ad oculum, et euacuatur cum medicinis mundificantibus caput, et administratur reliqua curatio, quam dixi in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert illud totum: tunc cauterizatio in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterizatio cum medicina acuta comburente: aut cum ferro.	When pain and swelling occur on the part of the head, or the pain extends to the eye, and it is cleaned with cleansing medicines, and the remaining treatment is administered as I said in the divisions of diseases, and it does not help the entire thing; then cauterization in this case is according to two modes: either cauterization with sharp burning medicine, or with iron.
Cauterium autem cum medicina acuta comburente, est, ut accipias dentem unum allii, et excortices ipsum, et abscindas extremitates eius ex duobus lateribus.	The cautery with sharp burning medicine is, as if you take a single garlic tooth, and burn it, and cut off its extremities from both sides.
Deinde scinde locum doloris in tempore cum phlebotomo lato, donec fiat in eo locus sub cute, in quo dens capitur.	Then open the painful place at the time with a broad phlebotomy, until it becomes a thick spot under the skin, where the density is captured.
Intromitte ergo eum in ipso sub cute, donec occultetur: deinde stringe super ipsum cum puluillo constrictione decenti, et dimitte ipsum quantitate quindecim horarum deinde solue eum, et extrahe allium, et dimitteuulnus duobus diebus, aut tribus: postea pone super ipsum cotum submersum in butyro, donec locus efficiat pus: deinde cura ipsum cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Insert it therefore under the skin, until it is hidden; then bind above it with a decent constricting poultice, and leave it for fifteen hours; then remove it, and extract the garlic, and apply an ointment for two or three days; afterwards put on a submerged cotton dressing in butter, until the place makes pus; then treat it with an ointment until it is healed.
Et si uis fac illud cum quibusdam medicinis comburentibus, quas ego scripsi in tractatu duodecimo, de Medieinis adurentibus.	And if you want to make that with certain burning medicines, which I wrote about in the twelfth treatise, on medicines that burn inwardly.
Cauterizatio uero eius cum ferro, est secundum hunc modum.	Cauterization indeed is with iron, and it is according to this method.
Igni Cauterium, cuius forma haec est.	The branding iron, whose form is this.
Et nominatur Clauilis: quoniam forma capitis eius est sicut forma claui, in quo est quiddam curuitatis, et in medio eius est quaedam eminentia parua.	And it is named a Claw; because the form of its head is like the form of a nail, in which there is a certain curvature, and in its middle there is a small prominence.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum, et retine manum tuam: et tu reuolue ferrum paulatim cum uelocitate: et sit quantitas quae aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, sicut medietas eius.	Then place it on the spot, and hold your hand firmly; and you turn the iron slowly with speed: and let the amount that is burned be according to the thickness of the skin, as its middle.
Et eleua manum tuam, ut non aduratur arteria, quae est inferius, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And raise your hand, so that the artery, which is below, is not burned, and a flow of blood occurs.
Deinde imbibe cotum in aqua salis, et pone super locum, et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus: deinde pone cotum cum butyro: postea cura cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Then soak a cloth in salt water, and place it on the spot, and leave it for three days; then put the cloth with butter: afterwards treat with ointment until it is healed.
Et si uis, cauteriza hanc hemicraniam cum extremitate cultellari secunda Cauterii.	And if you wish, cauterize this hemicrania with the second point of the scalpel's edge.
Et caue ab incisione arteriae in hac hemicrania, non antiqua proprie.	And beware of cutting into an artery in this hemicrania, not in the proper ancient way.
Â¶ De modo cauteriezandi in hemicrania antiqua.	On the method of cauterizing in ancient hemicrania.
Caput V.	Chapter 5.
Quando curas hemicraniam, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione praecedente, et quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio: et uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei quod diximus ex cauterio primo cum medicina, aut cum cauterio cum igne, tunc oportet ut ignias Cauterium cultellare, donec albificetur postquam signas super locum doloris cum linea, cuius longitudo sit medietas digiti, aut quasi illud: et depone manum tuam uice una, et stringe eam donec incidas arteriam, et peruenias usque ad os.	When you treat hemicrania, with what we said from previous treatment, and what we said in the divisions of illnesses, and the treatment does not help: and you see from the illness that it is not sufficient for him what we said from the first cauterization with medicine, or with cauterization with fire, then it is necessary to brand with a scalpel cauterium, until it whitens after applying signs on the spot of pain with a line, whose length is the middle of a finger, or almost that: and put your hand in its place, and hold it firmly until you cut into an artery, and pass through to the mouth.
Verumtamen necesse est tibi, ut caueas a continuatione mandibulae, quae mouetur apud masticationem, ne aduratur latus, aut neruus qui mouet ipsam, unde accidat spasmus.	However, it is necessary for you to be cautious about the continuity of the jawbone, which moves during mastication, lest it should be injured by a blow or a nerve that moves it, whence a spasm occurs.
Et esto super custotiam, et cautelam de fluxu sanguinis arteriae, quae abscisa est.	And this is above the custodian, and caution about the flow of blood in the artery, which has been severed.
In abscisione enim eius est timor, et praecipue ei qui ignorat illud quod facit, et non est studiosus, nec expertus: et dimittit operationem cum eo in primis.	For in the cutting of it there is fear, and especially for him who does not know what he is doing, and is not diligent, nor experienced: and he leaves the operation with it at first.
Et ego ueniam cum rememoratione regiminis fluxus sanguinis accidentis ex arteria secundum modum suum, et in loco suo huius libri.	And I describe with reminiscence of the regulation of the flow of blood that occurs from the artery according to its own method, and in its place in this book.
Quod si uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei hoc Cauterium, et uides corpus infirmi tolerans cauterium in medio capitis, sicut narrauimus, cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	What if you see from the weakness, that it does not suffice for him to apply this cautery, and you see the body of the infirm person tolerating the cautery in the middle of the head, as we have narrated, heal the wound, until he is restored to health.
Et si uis, administra Cauterium, quod diximus in capitulo extractionis arteriae cum Cauterio habente duos cultellos.	And if you wish, administer the cautery, which we mentioned in the chapter on extracting the artery with a cautery having two points.
Est enim cauterizatio melior hac et magis conferens.	For cauterization is better than this and more beneficial.
Â¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Aurium.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in the case of a golden abscess.
Caput VI.	Chapter 6.
Quando accidit in Aure dolor a frigore, et curatur cum solutiuis, et reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione, et non remouetur dolor, tunc igni Cauterium: et est illud quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma est haec.	When an abscess occurs on the golden [part of the body] due to cold, and it is treated with poultices, and other treatments that we mentioned in the division, and the pain does not subside, then apply the cautery: and it is that which is called a Point, whose form is this.
Deinde puncta cum eo post eius ignitionem in circumitu auris totius, sicut reuoluitur: aut in circumitu utriusque, si simul dolor est in utrisque.	Then apply the points with it after its ignition around the entire circumference of the ear, as it revolves; or around both, if there is pain in both.
Et elonga te cum Cauterio a radice auris parumper, postquam signaueris loca cum encaustro: et sit cauterii quantitas decem punctorum in omni aure, et quasi illa.	And extend yourself with the cautery from the root of the ear for a short time, after you have marked the places with ink; and let the quantity of the cautery be ten points on each ear, and similarly there.
Deinde cura loca, donec sanentur.	Then treat the places, until they heal.
Â¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tortura.	On the method of cautery in Torture.
Caput VII.	Chapter 7.
Tortura quae curatur cum cauterizatione, non est nisi ex speciebus, quae accidunt ex phlegmate, secundum quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum.	Tortures that are treated with cautery are not except those species which arise from phlegm, according to what we said in the divisions of diseases.
Et deuita cauterizationem speciei, quae accidit ex exiccatione, et spasmo nerui.	And it is necessary to add cautery to the species which arises from dryness and nerve spasm.
Quando curas hanc speciem torturae cum hyeris, et caputpurgiis, et gargarismis, et non confert curatio tua, tunc oportet ut cauterizes infirmum tribus Cauteriis: uno apud radicem auris, et secundo parum inferius a timpore suo, et tertio apud coniunctionem duorum labiorum.	When you treat this species of torture with rubbings and head-cleansings and garglings, and your treatment does not help, then it is necessary to apply cautery to the weak part in three places: one at the root of the ear, and a second a little below its own time, and a third at the junction of the two lips.
Et pone Cauterium tuum ex contrario partis infirmae.	And place your cautery on the opposite part of the weak area.
Quoniam mollificatio non accidit, nisi in parte quae apparet sana.	Since softening does not occur unless in the part that appears healthy.
Et forma cauterizationis est, ut cauterizes ipsum Cauterio in directo extremitatis auris superioris sub cornu capitis parum: et alio in timpore: cuius longitudo sit secundum longitudinem pollicis.	And the form of cautery is to apply the cautery directly on the upper extremity of the ear, a little below the crown of the head, and another at the temple, whose length should be according to the length of the thumb.
Et depone manum tuam cum cauterio, donec comburatur quantitas medietatis spissitudinis cutis.	And place your hand with the cautery until it burns a moderate quantity of the thickness of the skin.
Et haec est forma Cauterii, et est species ex cultellari, cuius forma praemissa est: uerumtamen non est subtilior ea parum, sicut uides: et oportet ut sit cultellus in eo superfluae grossitudinis parum.	And this is the form of the cautery, and it is a species from the knife, whose form was mentioned before: truly it is not more subtle than that which you see, and it is necessary for the knife to be somewhat above the excessive thickness.
Deinde cura loca, cum eo quod praecessit: donec sanetur.	Then treat the places with what has preceded until they are healed.
Â¶ De modo cauterizandi in Apoplexia antiqua.	On the method of cautery in ancient Apoplexy.
Caput VIII.	Chapter 8.
QUando antiquatur Apoplexia, et curas eam cum eo quod diximus, et non confert medicatio tua, et infirmus non habet febrem, tunc cauteriza eum quatuor cauteriis super omne cornu capitis sui, et cauterio in medio capitis, sicut diximus, et cauterio in occipitio capitis, secundum quod praecessit: et modus cauterii sit secundum quod praecessit.	When ancient Apoplexy is aged and you treat it with what we have said, and your medicine does not help, and the patient does not have a fever, then cautery him with four cauteries on every crown of his head, and a cautery in the middle of his head, as we have said, and a cautery at the back of his head, according to what has preceded: and the method of cautery should be according to what has preceded.
Etiam cauterizatur cum Cauterio super os stomachi: et est magis ultimum.	They are also burned with a branding iron on the belly: and it is a most extreme treatment.
Deinde curetur, cum eo quod praecessit.	Then they are treated, along with what preceded.

Deinde rade caput infirmi totum, et pone super occipitium eius emplastrum de synapi descriptum in tractatu emplastrorum: et pone ipsum aliquotiens.	Then scrape the entire head of the weak person, and apply to his occiput a plaster made from synapic, as described in the treatise on plasters: and apply it several times.
Ipsum namque est modus Cauterii: et fac illud secundum ordinem eundem, quem dixi illic.	This indeed is the method of branding: and do that second treatment in the same order as I mentioned there.
Si ergo sanatur per illud, bonum est.	If therefore they are healed through that, it is good.
Si non: tunc fac ei cauteria tria in posteriori parte capitis sui, quae sint descendentia a superiori parte capitis usque ad inferiorem partem oculi: et pone inter omne cauterium grossitudinem digiti.	If not: then make three branding irons on the back of their head, which descend from the upper part of the head to the lower part of the eye: and apply a thickness of a finger between each branding iron.
Deinde cura Cauterium, cum eo quod praecessit.	Then treat with branding irons, along with what preceded.
Si autem uis additionem, et infirmus est tolerans illud: tunc fac ei Cauterium in medio.	If however you add strength, and the patient is tolerant of that: then make a branding iron in the middle.
Quod si uis additionem: tunc cauteriza ipsum super duo cornua.	Which if you add strength: then brand it above the two horns.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: sitque Cauterium oliuare secundum formam, quae praemissa est.	Then treat him until he is healed: and let the branding iron be oiled according to the previously mentioned form.

Deinde rade caput infirmi: postea cauteriza ipsum cauterio in medio capitis, et cauterio super omne cornu capitis, et cauterio super posterius ipsius, et tribus super spondiles colli.	Then scrape the head of the weak person: afterwards brand it with a branding iron in the middle of the head, and with a branding iron above every horn of the head, and with a branding iron above its back, and three on the vertebrae of the neck.
Si autem indiges in aegritudine mollificatione corporis pluribus illis, et infirmus est tolerans, et aegritudo est fortis: tunc cauteriza ipsum quatuor cauteriis super spondiles dorsi, et ultima cum cauterio, donec comburatur ex cute plurimum eius, et eleua manum tuam.	If however you are weary of the softening of the body in many of those illnesses, and the patient is tolerant, and the illness is strong: then brand it with four branding irons on the vertebrae of the back, and finally with a branding iron, until the skin is thoroughly burned from its cut, and raise your hand.

Oportet ergo ut mundifices cerebrum eius in primis cum hyeris, et cum reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione: quando infirmus est magnus, aut est tolerans in accaeptione medicinarum.	It is necessary therefore to cleanse his brain first with yarrow, and with the rest of the treatment that we have spoken of in the division: when the patient is greatly weakened, or is tolerant of the acceptance of medicines.
Si autem est puer, qui non tolerat medicinas, tunc administratur gargarisma, et masticationes mundificantes cerebrum, ante illud diebus multis cum bonificatione ciborum.	If, however, he is a boy who does not tolerate medicines, then gargling and cleansing mouthwashes are administered to him, and brain-purifying mastichations, for many days beforehand with the benefit of good foods.
Deinde rade caput eius, postea cauteriza ipsum Cauterio uno in medio capitis, secundum quod praecessit in modo: et cauterio alio in occipitio eius, et super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio.	Then shave his head, afterwards brand him with one branding iron in the middle of his head, according to what has been previously mentioned in the method: and with another branding iron on the back of his head, and above all the horns of his head with a branding iron.

Et si caussa melancholiae est superfluitas decliuis ad melancholiam, et est corpus infirmi humectum, tunc da ei in potu quod mundificet cerebrum eius, secundum quod praecessit in diuisione: deinde rade caput infirmi, et fac postea tortellam decenter factam ex lino, sicut circulum.	And if the cause of melancholy is an excessive flow downwards to melancholy, and the patient's body is moistened, then give him a drink that cleanses his brain, according to what has been previously mentioned in the division: then shave the patient's head, and afterwards make a well-made tortellum from linen, like a circle.

Deinde praecipe ei, ut radat caput suum, et cauteriza ipsum in medio capitis sui.	Then instruct him to shave his head, and cauterize himself in the middle of his own head.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super duo timpora duobus cauteriis, si est incaeptio descensus aquae in duobus oculis simul: aut ex latere uno, si est incaeptio aquae in oculo uno: et abscinde cum cauterio omnes uenas et arterias quae sunt sub cute: et sint cauteria in ea longa in latitudine timporum: et caue a fluxu sanguinis.	Then cauterize him on two temporal regions with two cauteries, if there is a downward flow of water in both eyes simultaneously; or on one side, if there is a downward flow of water in one eye; and cut away with the cautery all the veins and arteries that are beneath the skin; and let the cauteries be in length across the width of the temples; and beware of a flux of blood.
Quod si uides aliquid ex eo, tunc abscinde eum statim cum quacumque medicina est possibile: et ego ueniam cum sapientia, quae est in extractione arteriarum, et abscisione earum, et cautela a fluxu sanguinis.	If you see anything of it, then cut away from him immediately with whatever medicine is possible; and I warn with wisdom, which is in the extraction of arteries, and their cutting away, and caution against a flux of blood.

When the tears of the eyes are ancient and frequent: and they are upon the veins and arteries which are on the exterior of the manifest head, it is verified that it is from excessive cold and phlegmatic superfluities: then cauterize with a cauterion as I described in the descent of water in the reception, a cauterion in the middle of the head, and two cauterions above two temples, and two cauterions on the vertebra under two bones.
Et si indiges additione, tunc cauteriza ipsum in omni latere caute oculi, super extremitatem supercilii cum cauterio paruo.	And if you need an additional treatment, then cauterize it on every side of the eye, above the extremity of the eyebrow with a small cauterion.

Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum supra duo supercilia parum duobus cauteriis in omni parte: et elongentur a duobus timporibus: et sit longitudo omnis cauterii, secundum longitudines supercilii: et non ultimes manum tuam cum cauterio, imo secundum quantitatem quod aduritur tertia palpebrae.	And if you wish, cauterize it above two eyebrows slightly with two cauterions on every side: and they will be extended from the two temples: and let the length of every cauterion be according to the length of the eyebrow: and do not apply your hand with the cauterion excessively, but rather according to the quantity that is necessary for the third eyelid.

Cauterium in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum igne: aut cauterium cum medicina comburente.	The cautery in it is according to two methods: either a cautery with fire, or a cautery with combustible medicine.
In cauterio autem cum igne, praecipe infirmo ante illud, ut dimittat pilos suos, si est ex illis qui mundant eos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	In the cautery with fire, however, you should warn the patient beforehand, so that they may remove their own hair, if it is among those that disturb them, until they are prolonged and equalized.
Si autem pungunt eum apud ortum suum: tunc constringe oculos eius cum uitta, ut non moueantur, donec nascantur.	If however they irritate him at his own site: then bind his eyes with a cloth, so that they are not moved, until they are born.
Cum ergo nascuntur et aequantur, tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo: deinde signa super Palpebram oculorum eius cum encaustro, signo quod sit secundum figuram folii myrti: et sit principium signi prope pilos.	When they are born and equalized, then place the head of the patient in your lap: afterwards mark on the eyelids of his eyes with encaustic, a mark that is according to the figure of the leaf of myrtle: and let the beginning of the mark be near the hairs.
Deinde pone cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum.	Then place a cloth imbued with egg white: or in a mucilage of ground psyllium on the eye.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	Then apply the fire cautery, whose form is this.
Deinde cauteriza super figuram, quam signasti paulatim in uicibus multis, donec comburatur superficies cutis, quae est sicut figura folii myrti, totam apparentem proprie.	Then cautery on the figure that you marked gradually in many places, until the surface of the skin is burnt, which is like the shape of the leaf of myrtle, appearing entirely and properly.
Et signum sanitatis operis tui est: ut si uideas Palpebram oculi iam contrahi, et pilos eleuari apud puncturam oculi.	And the sign of the success of your work is this: that you see the eyelid of the eye already contracted, and the hairs elevated at the point of the eye.
Eleua ergo manum tuam tunc: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Lift your hand then: and leave it for three days.

Quod si redeat aliquod ex pilis post horam, et mollificetur palpebra: tunc itera Cauterium super illum locum, sicut fecisti in primis.	If something returns from the hairs after that hour, and the eyelid becomes soft: then repeat the cautery on that place, as you did at first.
Si autem pili sunt in inferiori: tunc cauteriza ipsam, donec eleuetur ad locum suum naturalem: et aequetur ut non pungant pili oculum.	If, however, the hairs are in the lower part: then cauterize it, until it returns to its natural place: and equalizes so that the hairs do not prick the eye.
Â¶ De modo cauterizandi cum medicina comburente in eodem casu.	On the method of cauterizing with a burning medicine in the same case.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter 18.
Est ut praecipias infirmo, ut dimittat pilos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	It is as if you should prescribe for the weak, so that they let go of the hairs, until they are prolonged and equalized.
Fac ex charta de panno formam folii myrti.	Make a shape from a piece of paper in the form of a myrtle leaf.
Deinde accipe ex sapone cognito, et ex calce non imbibita ex unoquoque pondus uncia I aut quasi illud: deinde tere ea simul contritione bona, et fac illud cum festinatione, ut non infrigidetur.	Then take from soap known and from lime not soaked in water a weight of one ounce or nearly that; then rub those together with good compression, and make it with haste, so that it is not frozen.
Deinde ex pande ex eo super chartam quam fecisti sicut formam folii myrti, et pone ipsum super palpebram oculi unius, aut duorum.	Then spread from the mixture upon the paper which you made in the shape of a myrtle leaf, and put it upon the eyelid of one eye or of two.
Et pone sub oculo cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: et caput infirmi sit in sinu tuo.	And place under the eye a small cloth soaked in white egg; and let the head of the weak person be in your lap.
Et pone digitum tuum indicem super medicinam, et preme ipsum parumper.	And put your index finger on the medicine, and press it gently for a short time.
Et tu moueas ipsum quotiens sentit infirmus mordicationem medicinae: quoniam inuenit eius mordicatio sicut ignis.	And you move it as often as the weak person feels the biting of the medicine: because he finds its biting like fire.
Dum ergo perseuerat hoc quod ipse inuenit mordicatio, tunc dimitte medicinam, et moue ipsam cum digito tuo.	Therefore, as long as he perseveres in this, which he finds biting, then remove the medicine, and move it with your finger.
Cum ergo quiescit mordicatio, tunc remoue medicinam, et ablue oculum cum aqua.	When the biting sensation quiets, then remove the medicine, and wash the eye with water.
Et considera tunc, si uides palpebram eleuari, sicut eleuatur apud contractionem cum igne, aut cum incisione, est bene: et si non, tunc itera super ipsam ex medicina super locum, in quo non imprimit medicina, et non denigrat, donec aequetur operatio tua, et contrahatur oculus.	And consider then, if you see the eyelid being lifted, as it is lifted by contraction with fire, or with incision, it is good: and if not, then repeat over the same place from the medicine to where the medicine does not impress, and does not blacken, until your operation is equalized, and the eye is contracted.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur cutis adustionis.	Then put over it a small cloth with butter, until the skin of the burning is eradicated.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento diaphinicon, aut alio, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with a diaphinic ointment, or another, until it heals.
Et necesse est tibi apud operationem, ut custodias ultima custodia, ne in oculum cadat aliquid ex medicina.	And it is necessary for you during the operation to keep a final guard, lest something from the medicine falls into the eye.
Quod si mollificatur palpebra post dies, et pugnat ex capillis aliquid in oculo, tunc itera medicinam super illum locum, qui mollificatur ex palpebra proprie, sicut fecisti in primis.	If the eyelid becomes soft after a few days and something struggles to come out of the eye from the hairs, then you should apply the medicine to that place which has become soft from the eyelid itself, just as you did at first.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it, until it heals.
Et haec est forma folii myrti.	And this is the form of a myrtle leaf.
Et scias, quod oculi hominum diuersificantur in magnitudine, et paruitate.	And know that the eyes of men differ in size and equality.
Ergo secundum illud sit consideratio tua: et non occultatur uia rectitudinis illi, cui est studium de hac arte.	Therefore, according to that, let your consideration be this: and do not hide the way of righteousness from him who has a zeal for this art.
Â¶ De modo cauterizandi in Fistula lachrymali.	On the method of cauterizing in the tear duct fistula.
Caput XIX.	Chapter 19.
Quando curas Fistulam, cum eo quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc, oportet ut cauterizes ipsam secundum hunc modum.	When you treat a fistula, with what we said in the divisions of diseases, and your treatment does not help, then it is necessary to cauterize it according to this method.
Praecipe infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo, et teneat caput eius minister inter manus suas taliter, ut non moueatur, neque agitetur cum capite suo.	Instruct the patient to place their head on your lap, and hold it steady with their hands in such a way that it does not move or get agitated with their own head.
Deinde pone Cotum infusum in albugine oui, aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum eius: deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	Then place a cotton pad soaked in egg white or a poultice of fleawort on their eye: then apply the cautery iron, whose shape is this.
Sit concauum, sicut forma cannae pennae uulturis ab extremitate una, cum qua fit Cauterium: et si uis sit penetrans usque ad extremitatem aliam, et si uis sit sursum sic tenta.	It is a concave shape, like the form of a reed pen from one extremity, with which the cautery iron is made: and if it needs to penetrate to the other extremity, and if it needs to be held thus above.
Verumtamen hoc concauum est melius ad opus tuum.	However, this concave shape is better suited for your work.
Deinde exprime fistulam, si est aperta, et extrahe ex ea saniem, et exicca ipsam: et si non est aperta, tunc aperi eam, et extrahe pus eius.	Then express the fistula, if it is open, and draw out the serum from it, and cleanse it: and if it is not open, then open it, and draw out its pus.
Deinde pone tunc super eam Cauterium, quod fit ignitum ualde.	Then place a cautery on it, which has been ignited with a flame.
Et tene cum eo manum tuam parumper apud Cauterium ab oculo, ad partem nasi, ut non erret manus tua, aut inquietetur infirmus: et ponas Cauterium in adipe oculi, et corrumpas ipsum.	And hold your hand there for a while at the cautery, next to the eye, so that your hand does not slip, or the patient is disturbed: and you will place the cautery on the fat of the eye, and corrupt it.
Si ergo peruenis in principio Cauterii tui usque ad os, erit bene.	If then you apply at the beginning of your cautery up to the bone, it will be good.
Et si non: tunc itera Cauterium semel, aut bis, si indiges illo: et dimitte illud tribus diebus.	And if not: then repeat the cautery once or twice, if it is necessary for that: and leave it for three days.
Deinde pone Cotum cum butyro, et cura ipsum cum unguento exiccatiuo, donec sanetur.	Then put a bandage with butter, and treat it with a drying ointment, until it heals.
Quod si praeterierint ei quadraginta dies, et non sanatur: tunc pone super ipsum medicinam acutam corrosiuam, donec detegatur os: et rade ipsum secundum quod uenit in capitulo suo.	If it has passed forty days and it does not heal: then put on it a sharp corroding medicine, until the bone is exposed: and scrape it according to what is written in its chapter.
Et est modus alius Cauterii fistulae, quem quidam primi dixerunt.	And there is another method of cautery for a fistula, which some of the first authorities have mentioned.
Intende ad locum fistulae, et finde ipsum: deinde pone in ipsam fissuram camahan subtile, id est, Cannulam subtilem, cuius forma haec est.	Direct yourself to the place of the fistula, and find it: then put into the same fissure a subtle cannula, which is called a subtle tube, whose form is this.
Et funde in ipsum quantitatem drachmae ex plumbo liquefacto, et tene manum tuam cum Canna retentione bona, et non moueatur infirmus omnino, ut non currat, uel perueniat plumbum liquefactum ad oculum eius.	And pour into it a quantity of drachmae from melted lead, and hold your hand with a good cannula retention, and the patient should not move at all, so that it does not flow, or the melted lead reaches his eye.
Et oportet ut ponas super oculum infirmi cotum infusum in albumine oui, aut in aqua.	And it is necessary to put on the patient's eye a bandage soaked in white egg, or in water.
Plumbum enim comburit locum fistulae, et sanat ipsam sanatione mirabili.	For the melted lead burns the place of the fistula, and heals it with a marvelous healing.
Quod si sanatur fistula, cum eo quod diximus ex Cauterio, et curatione, est bonum.	If the fistula is healed, along with what we have said about cautery and treatment, it is good.
Et si non, tunc necesse est administrare foramen nasi, et reducere fistulam ad cursum nasi, secundum quod ueniet in loco suo sibi proprio.	And if not, then it is necessary to administer the nasal passage, and reduce the fistula to the course of the nose, according to what is suitable for its own place.

Cum ergo tu curas has fissuras, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio, tunc igni cauterium paruum cultellare, secundum hanc formam.	When therefore you treat these fissures, as we have said in the division of diseases, and the treatment does not help, then you should apply a small cautery iron, according to this method.
Et sit concauitas eius secundum subtilitatem cultelli.	And let it be concave according to the subtlety of the instrument.
Deinde pone ipsum ignitum festinanter in ipsis fissuris, donec perueniat cauterium ad profundum fissurarum.	Then apply the ignited cautery quickly to those fissures, until the cautery reaches the depth of the fissures.

Caput XXI.	Chapter 21.
Quando accidit apostema in radice gingiuae, aut in palato, aut in radicibus dentium: deinde facit pus, et rumpitur: postea antiquatur, et currit pus, et fit fistula: deinde curas ipsam, et non confert in ea curatio, tunc oportet ut ignias cauterium secundum quantitatem, quod capiat in fistula.	When an abscess occurs at the root of the gums, or in the palate, or in the roots of the teeth: then it produces pus, and bursts: afterwards it becomes chronic, and the pus flows, and a fistula forms: then you treat it, and if the treatment does not help in that case, then it is necessary to apply a cautery iron according to its size, which can grasp the fistula.
Deinde intromitte ipsum ignitum in foramine fistulae, et tene manum tuam, donec perueniat ferrum ignitum ad profundum eius, et ultimum eius: fac illud semel, aut duabus uicibus.	Then insert the ignited cautery into the opening of the fistula, and hold your hand steady, until the ignited iron reaches the depth of it and its end: do that once or twice.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud, cum eo quod diximus de curatione usquequo curetur.	Then treat it afterwards, as we have said about the treatment until it is cured.
Si ergo abscinditur sanies, et sanatur, erit bonum.	If therefore the abscess is cut off and healed, it will be good.
Et si non, tunc necesse est detegere locum, et auferre os corrupum secundum quod ueniet in capite suo.	And if not, then it is necessary to lay bare the place and remove the corrupted bone according to what appears in its head.
Â¶ De modo cauterizandi in Gingiuis, et Dentibus mollificatis.	On the method of cauterizing in gums and softening teeth.

When the gums become soft because of moisture and the teeth move, and you treat it with medicines and it does not help: then place the head of the patient in your lap.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma ueniet post haec, ita ut ponas Cannulam super dentem: et intromitte in ea Cauterium ignitum festinanter: et tene manum tuam parumper, donec sentiat infirmus calorem ignis iam peruenisse ad radicem dentis.	Then apply the fire cauterization, whose form you will see afterwards, so that you place a candle over the tooth: and insert into it the ignited cautery hastily: and hold your hand there for a short time, until the patient feels the heat of the fire having already reached the root of the tooth.
Et eleua manum tuam: deinde itera Cauterium aliquotiens, secundum quod uis.	And lift your hand away: then apply the cautery several times, according to what you see fit.
Deinde impleat infirmus os suum aqua salis, et teneat ipsam hora una: et exspuat ipsam.	Then the patient should soak his mouth with salt water, and hold it for one hour: and spit it out.
Dens enim motus firmatur, et gingiua mollificata stringitur, et siccatur humiditas corrupta.	For the tooth that has been moved is stabilized, and the gums that have been softened are tightened, and the corrupted moisture is dried up.
Â¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Dentium.	On the method of cauterizing in painful teeth.
Caput XXIII.	Chapter 23.
Quando dolor dentis est propter frigiditatem, aut in ipso est frigus, aut uermis, et non confert curatio cum medicinis: tunc Cauterium in ipso est secundum duos modos: aut Cauterium cum butyro: aut cauterium cum igne.	When toothache is due to coldness, either there is coldness in it or worm, and treatment with medicines does not help: then cautery on the spot is according to two methods: either cautery with butter, or cautery with fire.
Cauterium autem eius cum butyro est, ut accipias butyrum uaccinum, et bullias ipsum in cochleari ferreo, aut in uenera.	The cautery method with butter is to take melted butter, and boil it in an iron spoon, or in a vessel.
Deinde accipe cotum, et inuolue ipsum super extremitatem tentae.	Then take a cloth, and wrap it around the end of the affected tooth.
Deinde submerge ipsum in butyro bullito: et pone ipsum super dentem dolorosum festinanter, et tene ipsum donec infrigidet: deinde itera ipsum aliquotiens, donec perueniat uirtus ignis ad radicem dentis.	Then submerge it in the boiled butter: and place it quickly on the aching tooth, and hold it until it cools down: then repeat it several times, until the power of fire reaches the root of the tooth.
Et si uis, submerge lanam, aut cotum in butyro frigido, et pone ipsum super dentem dolentem: et pone super ipsum ferrum ignitum, donec perueniat ignis ad profundum concauitatis dentis.	And if you wish, submerge a woolen thread or cloth in cold butter, and place it on the painful tooth: and place ignited iron on top of it, until the fire reaches the deep cavity of the tooth.
Cauterizatio autem eius cum igne est, ut intendas ad cannulam aeris, aut cannulam ferri.	The cautery method with fire is to direct a copper or iron tube.
Et sit in corpore eius quiddam grossitudinis, ut non perueniat acuitas ignis ad os infirmi.	And let there be something of thickness in its body, so that the sharpness of the fire does not reach the patient's mouth.
Deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma ueniet: et pone ipsum super illum dentem: et tene manum tuam, donec infrigidetur Cauterium.	Then apply cautery, whose form is a flame; and put it on the tooth: and hold your hand, until the cautery becomes cold.
Fac illud aliquotiens, nam dolor remouebitur, aut in illo eodem die, aut die alio.	Do that several times, for the pain is relieved, either on that same day or another day.
Et oportet in impressione illius Cauterii, ut impleat infirmus os suum buyro bono, et teneat ipsum hora una: deinde exspuat ipsum.	And it is necessary to apply the impression of that cautery so that it fills the weak bone with good pus, and holds it for one hour; then extracts it.
Et haec est forma Cauterii.	And this is the form of the cautery.
Cauteriza cum quacumque extremitate uis secundum quod est possibile: et haec est forma Cannulae.	Cauterize with whatever extremity you use, according to what is possible: and this is the form of a Cannula.

When Scrofula are from phlegm, and from cold humidities, and they do not obey digestion through medicines, and you want to digest them quickly: then apply a concave cautery flame, whose form is this.
Habens duas extremitates apertas, ut egrediatur fumus apud Cauterium ab extremitate altera: et pone ipsum ignitum super ipsum apostema semel, et secundo, si indiges illo, donec perueniat ad profundum apostematis.	It has two open extremities, so that the smoke exits from the cautery through the other extremity: and put it ignited on the abscess once, and a second time, if you need it, until it reaches the depth of the abscess.
Quod si apostema est paruum: tunc pone Cauterium secundum quantitatem apostematis.	If the abscess is small: then put the cautery according to the size of the abscess.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super ipsum cotum infusum in butyro, donec remoueatur quod combussit ignis.	Then leave it for three days, and put a cotton dressing soaked in butter on top of it, until what the fire has burned is removed.

When humidity settles on the pulmonary canal, and especially when it is with a cold temperament, then it is necessary to evacuate the weak part first with solvent medicines.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum in nocrati apud radicem gutturis in loce depresso: et caue, ne peruenias cum Cauterio ad guttur, neque in cute, nisi quiddam eius.	Then cauterize it in the nostril at the root of the gullet in a depressed place: and be careful, lest you penetrate too far with the cauterization into the gullet, nor on the skin, unless something of it.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum cauterio alio apud iuncturam colli in ultimo spondili eius ultimando: et sit Cauterium clauile secundum modum, qui praecessit.	Then cauterize it with another cautery at the joint of the neck in the last vertebra, ultimately: and let the cautery be according to the method that has gone before.

When coughs and lung diseases are caused by cold humidities, and the patient is not feverish, nor consumptive, and the disease is not chronic: then cauterize it with two cauteries above the elbow in depressed, gentle, and empty places.
Et cauterio alio in medio pectoris inter duas mammillas: et sit cauterium cannulae secundum formam quae praecessit.	And with another cautery in the middle of the chest between the two breasts: and let the cautery be a hollow tube according to the shape that has gone before.
Et si uis sit cauterizatio tua punctando cum cauterio, quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma praecessit in punctatione doloris aurium: et sint puncta ex triginta punctis usque quasi ad alia.	And if it is fitting to use your cautery by pricking with the cautery, which is called a Point, whose shape has gone before in the pricking of the pain of the ears: and let the points be from thirty points up to almost another.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with what has gone before, until it is healed.
Et iam sit cauterium habens tres ramos: secundum hanc formam.	And now let the cautery have three branches: according to this shape.
Quare alleuiatur cum eo cauterizatio, quando tu facis cum eo uice una tria Cauteria.	For it is alleviated with that cautering when you make it as if one of the three Cauteries.
Â¶ De modo cauterizandi in Titillico, in dislocatione Humeri.	On the method of cautering for Gout, and for dislocation of the shoulder.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter 27.
Quando dislocatur caput adiutorii caussa humiditatum, et nonfigitur in hora reditus sui a dislocatione sua, donec sit illud ei consuetudo reditionis, deinde dislocatur a paruo motu, qui accidit sicut nos iam testificauimus illud, tunc oportet ut reducas dislocationem in primis.	When the head of the arm is dislocated due to humid causes, and it does not return to its place in the hour of its return from the dislocation, until it becomes accustomed to that return, then it is dislocated by a small movement, which happens as we have already testified, then it is necessary to reduce the dislocation at first.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, aut super latus sanum.	Then the weak patient is placed on their back, or on their healthy side.
Deinde eleua cutim, quae est in interiori Titillici ad superiora cum digitis manus tuae sinistrae: et si iunctura dislocatur ad interiora.	Then elevate the skin which is inside the thigh towards the top with the fingers of your left hand: and if the joint is dislocated towards the inside.
Deinde igni Cauterium habens duo uerua.	Then hold a cautery iron having two points.
Cuius forma est haec.	Its form is this.
Deinde cauteriza cutim, donec penetret eam usque ad latus aliud, et ueniet figura cauterizationis cum quatuor cauteriis.	Then cauterize the skin until it penetrates to the other side, and there will be a figure of cauterization with four cauteries.
Et quandoque fit cauterizatio cum cauterio habente tria uerua, quare fit figura cauterizationis tunc sex cauteriorum: et sunt uerua secundum subtilitatem tentae.	And when the cauterization is done with a cautery having three points, there will be a figure of cauterization then with six cauteries; and they are points according to the subtlety of the tension.
Et haec est forma cauterii habentis tria uerua.	And this is the form of the cautery having three points.
Et quandoque additur super hunc modum unum, quare sunt cauteria octo.	And when one is added in this way, there are eight cauteries.

Et si dislocatio est ad superiora, et raro fit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super humerum cauterio clauili, aut cauteriis multis punctando.	And if the dislocation is towards the top, and this rarely happens, then cauterize it above the shoulder with a cautery of nails, or by puncturing with many points.

When cold and many humidities occur in the stomach, so that they extract it from its complexions, and multiply catarrhs to it, and constant modes of cure do not help: then it is necessary for the weak patient to be placed on his back, and to extend his legs, and his hands.
Deinde cauteriza cum tribus cauteriis, cauterio sub cochleari pectoris quantitate digiti unius cum cauterio clauili, et duobus cauteriis inferius a duobus lateribus cauterii unius, donec ueniat figura cauteriorum triangulata.	Then cauterize with three cauteries, a cautery under the nipple of the breast in the quantity of one finger, with a nail-cautery, and two cauteries below from the two sides of the cautery of one, until there comes a triangular figure of cauteries.
Et elonga inter utraque ut non coniungantur, quando facient pus.	And let them be extended between both so that they may not adhere together when they make pus.
Et sit profunditas cauterii quantitas duarum tertiarum grossitudinis cutis.	And let the depth of the cauterization be a quantity of two or three times the thickness of the skin.
Et sit figura cauteriorum secundum hanc formam sine additione: et si uis cauteriza cauterio magno in medio stomachi secundum hanc formam: et sit cauterium quo fit hoc cauterium unum secundum figuram circuli secundum hanc formam.	And let the figure of the cauteries be according to this form without addition; and if you wish to cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this form; and let the cautery that makes this cautery be one according to the figure of a circle, according to this form.
Et cauterizatur stomachus punctando ei qui terretur ab hoc cauterio: et est, ut signes super stomachum punctum secundum quantitatem, quam uis cum encaustro: deinde cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio puncti: deinde cura ipsum cum curatione, quae praecessit donec sanetur.	And the stomach is cauterized by pricking it with the point of this cautery; and it is, as you mark a point on the stomach according to the quantity that you wish with an encaustic; then cauterize it with the point of the cautery; then heal it with the treatment that precedes until it is healed.
Â¶ De modo cauterizandi Epar frigidum.	Concerning the method of cauterizing a cold liver.

Quando accidit in Epate dolor ex frigiditate et humiditate, aut ex uentositate grossa, donec egrediatur a complexione sua naturali egressione superflua, et curatur infirmus, cum eo quod diximus, et non proficit in illo: tunc oportet ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam, et signes cum encaustro tria cauteria secundum hanc figuram, et hanc quantitatem eandem super Epar inferius ab hypocundriis, ubi peruenit cubitus hominis: et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium secundum grossitudinem digiti: et sit cauterium secundum longitudinem corporis rectum: et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio multum.	When it happens that the liver causes pain due to coldness and humidity, or due to thick flatulence, until it departs from its natural egress and becomes weak with the aforementioned symptoms, and is not helped by what we have said, then it is necessary for the weak patient to be placed on his back, and marked with an encaustic three cauteries according to this figure, and in the same quantity on the liver below the hypochondria, where the elbow joint reaches; and let there be a space between each cautery equal to the thickness of a finger; and let the cautery be equal to the length of the straight body; and do not press your hand too much with the cautery.
Et sit quantitas eius quod aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, quantitas medietatis eius non additum: et sit infirmus stans super pedes suos.	And let the quantity of it that is touched be from the thickness of the skin, a moderate quantity not added; and let the weak person stand on their feet.
Si autem non est stans, tunc sit iacens, qui iam extendit crura sua, et eleuauit brachia sua.	But if they are not standing, then let them lie down, who has already extended their legs and raised their arms.
Haec est forma cauterii.	This is the form of the cautery.
Et tibi quidem possibile est, ut cauterizes ista cauteria cum cauterio cultellari, quando tecum est subtilitas et prudentia in arte.	And it is certainly possible for you to cauterize these cauterizations with a cautery scalpel, when you have subtlety and prudence in the art.
Et custodi te, ut non ultime procedas in cauterizatione, et aduratur spissitudo cutis totius, quare aduratur corpus totum, et perueniat ad intestina: quoniam cutis illic est subtilis, scias ergo illud.	And be careful, so that you do not proceed to the extreme in cauterization, and the hardness of the entire skin is burned, because the entire body is burned, and it reaches to the intestines: for the skin there is subtle, therefore know that.
Â¶ De modo cauterizandi apostemata Epatis.	On the method of cauterizing apostemes of the liver.
Caput XXX.	Chapter 30.
Quando accidit exitura, et uis scire, si illud apostema est in carne Epatis, aut in tunica eius: tunc si est in carne Epatis, inuadit infirmum dolor, et grauitas absque acuitate: et si est in tunica Epatis, cum dolore est acuitas uehemens: et uides iam, quia fatigauit medicos eius curatio.	When an aposteme occurs, and you wish to know, if that aposteme is in the flesh of the liver or in its tunic: then if it is in the flesh of the liver, it induces a dull pain, and heaviness without acuteness: and if it is in the tunic of the liver, with pain there is acute vehemence: and you see already, because it has wearied out the doctors with its cure.
Oportet ergo ut resupinet infirmus super ceruicem suam.	It is necessary therefore that the weak person rests on his pillow.
Deinde figura locum apostematis cum encaustro: deinde ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	Then figure out the place of the aposteme with an enamel: then ignite a cautery iron that is similar to a star.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et cauteriza cum eo cauterium unum, donec comburatur cutis tota, et perueniat ad siphac, donec egrediatur sanies tota: deinde cura ipsum curatione exiturarum, donec sanetur.	And cauterize with that cautery iron one, until the entire skin is burned, and it reaches to the siphaÃ§, until all the sanies are discharged: then take care of its cure with evacuations, until it is healed.
Et non oportet ut hac cauterii specie utatur, nisi cuius studium in arte medicinae prolongatur: et per cuius manus concurrunt aegritudines istae cum experimento aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super huiusmodi operationem.	And it is not fitting that this species of cautery iron be used, unless one whose study in the art of medicine is prolonged: and through whose hand those diseases converge with experiment many times: then indeed he dares to undertake an operation of this kind.
At uero dimittere ipsam, apud me est melius.	But I do not intend to abandon it, for it is better with me.
Â¶ De modo cauterizandi in Pleuresi.	On the method of cauterizing in Pleurisy.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter 31.
Dixerunt antiqui, cauterium cum radicibus aristolochiae ad Pleuresim frigidam secundum hunc modum.	The ancients said that a cautery iron with the roots of Aristolochia is applied to cold Pleurisy in this manner.
Et est, ut recipias ex radicibus aristolochiae siccae longae, radicem unam longiorem, quae ex ea inuenitur, et sit sicut grossitudo digiti.	And it is, as you receive from the roots of dry long aristolochia, one longer root, which is found in it, and it should be like the thickness of a finger.
Deinde submerge eam in oleo: et accende ipsam in igne.	Then submerge it in oil: and set it on fire.
Deinde cauteriza cauterio uno in eo quod est inter continuationem furculae cum collo, et duobus cauteriis paruis sub guidezi parum decliuibus ad partem, quae est sub barba.	Then cauterize with one cautery at the point that is between the continuation of the furrow with the neck, and with two small cauteries under the guidance of small inclinations towards the part that is under the beard.
Et duobus cauteriis etiam in eo, quod est inter costam quintam et sextam decliuibus ad posteriora parumper: et cauterio alio in medio pectoris, et alio supra stomachum.	And with two cauteries also at the point that is between the fifth and sixth ribs sloping backwards slightly: and with one cautery in the middle of the chest, and another above the stomach.
Et tribus cauteriis a posterioribus: uno in eo quod est inter duas spatulas: et duobus cauteriis a duobus lateribus pectoris, inferius cauterio quod est inter duas spatulas.	And with three cauteries from the back: one at the point that is between the two shoulder blades: and with two cauteries on both sides of the chest, the lower cautery being between the two shoulder blades.
Et non oportet ut comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit in manifesto cutis odorando.	And it is not necessary to compress your hand with the cautery, but rather let it be on the manifest skin, giving off a smell.
Et iam dixerunt quidam antiqui, quod ex hominibus sunt qui utuntur cauterio ex ferro simili radio: et igniunt, et intus mittunt ipsum in eo quod est inter costas, donec perueniatur cum eo ad ipsum apostema, et egrediatur sanies: sicut diximus in apostemate Epatis.	And already some of the ancients have said that there are those who use a cautery made from iron similar to a file: and they set it on fire, and insert it inside what is between the ribs, until they reach with it to the very aposteme, and the sanies flow out: as we described in the case of Epatis' aposteme.
Sed in hac perforatione cum cauterio est ex timore, quod aut moritur infirmus statim, aut accidit in loco fistula, cui non est sanatio.	But in this piercing with a cautery there is fear of either the weak patient dying immediately or a fistula occurring at the site, which has no healing.
Â¶ De modo cauterizandi Splenem Caput XXXII.	On the method of cauterizing the Spleen, Chapter XXXII.
Quando tu curas aegritudinem splenis, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua, tunc cauterium in ea est secundum tres modos, qui omnes sunt recti.	When you treat an illness of the spleen, with what we said about cures in the division of illnesses, and your treatment does not help, then the cautery is in it according to three methods, all of which are correct.
Quorum unus est, ut facias tria cauteria, aut quatuor lineando secundum longitudinem splenis secundum figuram cauteriorum Epatis, quorum praecessit figura.	Of which one is to make three or four cauteries in a line along the length of the spleen, according to the figure of Epatis' cauteries, whose figure has gone before.
Et sit inter omne cauterium quantitas grossitudinis digiti, aut plus parum.	And let there be among all cautery a quantity of thickness of a finger, or a little more.
Et sit modus cauterii, quem diximus in cauterio epatis aequaliter.	And let the method of cautery be that which we mentioned as being equal in the cautery of the liver.
Et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio: et sit infirmus resupinus super dorsum suum.	And do not press your hand with the cautery, and let the patient lie relaxed on their back.
Et modus alius de cauterizatione est: ut ignias cauterium habens duo uerua, quod diximus in capitulo dislocationis humeri: et eleua cutem, quae est in directo splenis, ubi peruenit cubitus infirmi sinister: et sit eleuatio tua qua eleuas cutem secundum latitudinem corporis, ut cadant cauteria secundum longitudinem corporis.	And another method of cauteration is: to hold the cautery with two fingers, as we mentioned in the chapter on dislocation of the shoulder; and elevate the skin which is on the direct spleen, where the bent elbow of the left arm arrives; and let your elevation be such that you elevate the skin according to the width of the body, so that the cauteries fall according to the length of the body.
Deinde intromitte duo uerua ignita ualde, donec cum eis penetres cutem a parte altera: deinde extrahe cauterium: fiunt ergo cauteria quatuor.	Then introduce two ignited fingers deeply, until they penetrate the skin on the other side; then withdraw the cautery; thus four cauteries are made.
Et si uis cauteriza cum cauterio alio habente tria uerua.	And if you want to cauterize with another cautery having three fingers.
Deinde cura cauterium postquam dimittis ipsum emittere pus diebus multis: est enim magis conferens quamque reliqua quae praecesserunt ex curatione.	Then take care to apply the cautery after you have let it cool for many days; for it is more beneficial than all the others that preceded it in terms of treatment.
Â¶ De modo cauterizandi in Hydropisi.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in Hydrophobia.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter 33.
Cauterium non cadit in Hydropisi, nisi ascliti proprie.	The cautery does not fall on the affected part in Hydrophobia, unless the skin is properly prepared.
Quando tu curas Hydropicum cum modis curationis, quos diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, et cauterio uno super stomachum, et cauterio alio super epar, et cauterio super splenem, et cauteriis duobus post dorsum inter spondiles, et uno in directo pectoris, et alio in directo stomachi: et sit quantitas profunditatis cauterii propinqua spissitudini cutis.	When you treat a Hydrophobic patient with the methods of treatment which we mentioned in the division, and the treatment does not work, then it is necessary to cauterize him with four cauteries around the navel, and one on the stomach, and another on the liver, and one on the spleen, and two on the back between the vertebrae, and one directly on the chest, and another directly on the stomach; and let the quantity of the depth of the cautery be close to the thickness of the skin.
Deinde dimitte cauterium apertum, ut emittat pus tempore longo.	Then leave the opened cautery, so that it emits pus for a long time.
Et non euacues infirmum a curatione post cauterium cum eo: quod oportet ut aggregentur ei duae intentiones: et festinabit ad ipsum sanatio cum auxilio Dei.	And it is not fitting for an infirm person to be treated with cauterization after the cure, because two intentions are required for him; and he will hasten towards healing with the aid of God.
Forma uero cauterii cum quo cauterizatur uenter, sit clauilis: secundum quod praecessit forma eius: et illius cum quo cauterizatur dorsum, sit oliuaris secundum quod praecessit eius forma.	Indeed, the form of the cauterized stomach is claw-like, according to what its former shape was; and that of the back, which is cauterized, is oily, according to what its former shape was.
Â¶ De modo cauterizandi Pedes, et Crura.	On the method of cauterizing feet and legs.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter 34.
Quando apostemantur in Hydropico, et replentur aqua citrina: oportet ut cauterizes super dorsum Pedis in nocrati, quae est inter auricularem et anularem: et eleua manum tuam cum cauterio, et non torqueas ipsum: deinde eleua manum tuam: et non iteres ipsum omnino.	When they swell up with hydrops and are filled with citrine water: it is fitting to cauterize on the upper part of the foot at night, which is between the ankle-bone and the ring-finger; and lift your hand with the cauterium, and do not twist it; then lift your hand, and do not repeat it at all.
Resudet enim aqua citrina, et sit cauterium secundum hanc formam.	For the citrine water recedes, and the cauterium should be according to this form.
Deinde fac super duo crura duo cauteria in omni crure, et fiat cauterium cum extremitate cultellari cauterii: et fiat cauterium secundum longitudinem cruris, unum sub genu, et alterum inferius eo, circiter medium cruris: et super omnem coxam cauteria duo: et dimitte cauterium apertum absque curatione tempore longo: ut resudet ex eo aliquod aquae: deinde cura ipsum cum reliquis quae diximus.	Then make two cauterizations on each leg, and let the cauterium be with the extremity of the knife's edge; and let the cauterium be according to the length of the leg, one below the knee, and another lower than it, around the middle of the leg; and above every hip, two cauterizations; and leave the cauterium open without treatment for a long time: so that some water recedes from it; then treat it with the remaining things which we have said.
Â¶ De modo cauterizandi in solutione Ventris.	On the method of cauterizing in cases of abdominal ulcers.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter 35.
Quando est solutio uentris ex frigore et humiditatibus, donec debilitet uirtutes retentiuam et digestiuam, quae sunt in stomacho et intestinis: et curatur illud cum modis curationis, et non sanatur: et uides infirmum tolerantem cauterium exuberantis uirtutis, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio magno super stomachum suum, secundum quod praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi cum cauterio circuli, et quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici subtilibus, cum cauterio clauili subtili: et cauterio super alcatin supra alhosos magno, aut duobus cauteriis.	When there is an ulcer of the stomach from cold and dampness, until it debilitates the retentive and digestive virtues, which are in the stomach and intestines; and it is treated with modes of cure, but not healed: and you see the infirm person tolerating cauterization of exuberant virtue; then cauterize him with a large cauterium on his stomach, according to what preceded in cauterizing the stomach with a circular cauterium, and four subtle cauterizations around the navel, with a subtle claw-like cauterium: and a cauterium above the hip, or two cauterizations.
Et si uides humiditates exuberantes, et infirmum tolerantem illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio super pectinem, et cauterio super omne ilium: et fortasse addes duo cauteria parua super stomachum prope magnum.	And if you see excessive moistness and the patient tolerates that, then cauterize it with a cautery on the pubic area, and with a cautery on every limb: and perhaps you should add two small cauteries on the stomach near the navel.
Est enim curatio proficiens, cuius iuuamentum non errat.	It is a profitable treatment, whose benefit does not fail.
Â¶ De modo cauterizandi Hemorroidas.	On the method of cauterizing hemorrhoids.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter 36.
Quando in ano sunt Hemorroides antiquae multae, aut una, et sunt ex humoribus grossis, frigidis, aut humiditatibus corruptis, et curantur cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: tunc cauteriza tribus cauteriis super inferiorem spondilem dorsi sub almeidati parumper triangulatim, et cauterio sub umbilico quasi duobus digitis.	When there are many old hemorrhoids in the anus, or one, and they are from gross, cold, or corrupted humidities, and they are treated with what we said earlier in the division, but the treatment does not help: then cauterize with three cauteries on the lower vertebra of the back below the alumidation for a short time in a triangular shape, and with a cautery near the navel almost two fingers' breadth.
Et si cogitas, quod stomachus eius infrigidatus sit, et cibus eius non digeratur, et faciem eius uides apostemari, tunc cauteriza eum super stomachum cauterio magno, secundum quod praecessit: et cauterio super Epar eius, et alio super Splenem ipsius, cum cauterio clauili: et dimitte cauterium apertum tempore aliquo: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if you think that his stomach is chilled, and his food is not digested, and you see his face to be affected, then cauterize him on the stomach with a large cautery, according to what came before: and with a cautery on his liver, and another on his spleen, with a cautery of the claw-shaped instrument: and leave the cautery open for some time: then treat him until he is healed.
Â¶ De modo cauterizandi althelul post abscisionem eorum.	On the method of cauterizing ulcers after their excision.
Caput XXXVII.	Chapter 37.
Quando tu abscindis althelul, tunc ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	When you excise ulcers, then ignite a cautery that is similar to a fiery spark.
Deinde intromittite ipsum ignitum in ipsum althelul abscisum: et ultima manum tuam, donec perueniat cauterium ad orificium uenae, ex qua currit sanguis: fac illud semel, aut bis.	Then insert the ignited cautery into the excised ulcer: and hold your hand there until the cautery reaches the opening of the vein, from which the blood flows: do it once or twice.
Si ergo althelul fuerint multa, tunc cauteriza unumquodque cauterio secundum quod narrauimus.	If therefore there are many ulcers, then cauterize each one with a cautery according to what we have narrated.
Deinde cura ea, cum eo quod confert eis ex unguentis, donec sanentur.	Then treat them with what is beneficial to them from ointments, until they are healed.
Et si cauterizas eum cauterio magno super alcatin, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if you cauterize him with a large cautery on the skull, it is more useful in his youth.
Â¶ De modo cauterizandi Fistulam in ano.	On the method of cauterizing a fistula in the anus.
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter 38.
Quando non obedit infirmus sectioni et operi quod narrauimus in loco suo, et terretur ab illo, fortasse sanatur cum cauterio.	When the sick person does not obey the treatment and operation that we have described in its own place, and is terrified by it, perhaps he will be healed with a cautery.
Cum ergo accidit alicui Fistula, et antiquatur, currit pus ex ea, et humiditates corruptae.	When therefore a fistula occurs to someone, and it becomes chronic, pus flows out of it, and corrupted moisture accumulates.
Dignius ergo quod oportet est, ut probes eam cum tenta subtili.	It is more dignified therefore that what is opportune is that he should try it with a subtle probe.
Deinde cognosce quantitatem profunditatis eius cum tenta.	Then he should recognize the quantity of its depth with the probe.
Deinde ignias cauterium, quod est simile radio.	Then he should apply a cautery, which is similar to a red-hot iron.
Deinde intromit te ipsum ignitum in ipsam Fistulam et quantitatem in qua intrauit clauus.	Then he should introduce the ignited iron itself into the fistula and the quantity where the nail went in.
Et itera super eam cauterium, donec comburantur illa omnia corpora corrupta, semel, aut bis, aut ter, secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	And he should repeat the cautery over it, until all the corrupted bodies are burned away, once, or twice, or three times, according to the quantity of your necessity.
Et custodi te ab adustione nerui, si est illic, aut uenae magnae: aut si Fistula uadit ad corpus uesicae, aut ad corpus intestini, tunc custodi te ab istis locis omnibus.	And he should be cautious of burning the nerve, if it is there, or the large veins; or if the fistula leads to the bladder or to the intestine, then he should be cautious of all these places.
Et non facias illud, nisi quando fistula est in loco carnoso: et cogitas, quia non est penetrans.	And he should not do that, unless the fistula is in a fleshy place; and he should consider, because it does not penetrate.
Deinde cura locum usquequo sanetur.	Then he should take care of the place until it is healed.
Si autem sigillatur locus, et abscinduntur ab eo materiae, et remanet sic tempore longo: tunc scias, quia iam sanatus est integre.	If, however, the place is sealed off, and the materials are cut off from it, and it remains thus for a long time; then he should know that it is now fully healed.
Et si non abscindunt ab eo materiae, tunc scias quia est penetrans, aut in profundo eius est os corruptum, aut quasi illud ex illis: quorum rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And if the materials do not cut off from it, then he should know that it is penetrating, or there is a corrupted opening deep within, or almost one of those: whose remembrance will come in its own place.
Â¶ De modo cauterizandi Renes.	On the method of cauterizing kidneys.
Caput XXXIX.	Chapter 39.
Quando accidit in Renibus dolor ex frigore, aut ex uentositate grossa, et minuitur propter illud coius infirmi, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum super almethenem super ipsos renes, cauterio super omnem renem cum cauterio clauili, cuius praecessit rememoratio.	When pain occurs in the kidneys due to cold or gross flatulence, and it is diminished because of that weak condition, then it is necessary to cauterize them above the pubic area, cauterizing each kidney with a cautery iron, whose preceding memory.
Et fortasse cauterizamus ipsum secundo in ipso almeidatu.	And perhaps we will cauterize him a second time in that same pubic area.
Quare uenient tria lineata.	Because three lines come together.
Ergo erunt magis ultima in iuuamento.	Therefore they will be more useful in the healing process.
Â¶ De modo cauteritzandi Vesicam.	On the method of cauterizing the bladder.
Caput XL.	Chapter 40.
Quando accidunt in Vesica debilitas, et mollificatio a frigo re et humiditatibus, donec non retineat infirmus urinam, tunc cauteriza ipsum in inferiori parte suminis super Vesicam, ubi incipiunt pili pectinis, et cauterio a dextra suminis, et alio a sinistra illius: et sit longitudo illius cauterizationis lateris secundum quantitatem nodi pollicis: et cauteriza ipsum cauterio inferiori dorsi, aut duobus cauteriis, si indiges illo: et sit secundum quod praecessit cauterium clauile.	When weakness occurs in the bladder, and softening from cold and humidities, until it does not retain urine, then cauterize it on the lower part of the back above the bladder, where the hairs of the pubic area begin, and with a cautery iron on the right side, and another on the left side: and let the length of that cauterization be according to the size of the node of the thumb; and cauterize it with a lower dorsal cautery iron, or with two cautery irons if it is needed: and let it be according to what precedes the cautery iron of the clavicle.
Â¶ De modo cauterizandi Matricem.	On the method of cauterizing the womb.
Caput XLI.	Chapter 41.
Quando accidunt in Matrice frigus et humiditates, et prohibetur per illud ab impregnatione, et corrumpuntur menstrua eius, et tardatur prouocatio eorum, et accidit ei apud aduentum eorum dolor, tunc oportet ut cauterizetur tribus cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, sicut diximus in cauterizatione uesicae, et cauterio super alcatim inferius dorso, aut duobus cauteriis: et sit cauterium clauile.	When cold and humidity occur in the womb, and it is prevented from conception because of that, and its menstruations are corrupted, and their provocation is delayed, and pain occurs to her upon their arrival, then it is necessary to cauterize with three cautery irons around the navel, as we said in the cauterization of the bladder, and with a cautery iron above the lower back, or with two cautery irons: and let the cautery iron be of the clavicle.
Â¶ De modo cauterizandi Ancham in dislocatione.	On the method of cauterizing the hip in a dislocation.
Caput XLII.	Chapter 42.
Quando effunduntur humiditates mucosae ad pixidem Anchae, et fiunt caussa exitus eius a loco suo: et signum illius est, quod prolongatur crus super alterum, quando comparantur adinuicem: et inuenitur locus dislocationis in eo uacuus.	When the mucous humidities flow to the ankle of Anchae, and they become the cause of its exit from its place; and a sign of this is that one leg is prolonged over the other when compared to the normal: and the location of the dislocation is found in that empty space.
Oportet ergo ut cauterizes infirmum super pixidem Anchae ipsius cauterio simili circulo: postquam tu signas cum encaustro in circumitu pixidis, sicut reuoluitur: et ut cadat ipsa pixis in medio circuli.	It is necessary therefore to cauterize the weak place over the ankle of Anchae with a similar circular cautery of its own; after you mark with an encaustic in the circumference of the ankle, as it revolves: and so that the very ankle falls in the middle of the circle.
Et sit cauterium cuius forma praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi.	And let the cautery be one whose form preceded in the cauteration of the stomach.
Quod si tibi non est praesens hoc cauterium, tunc cauteriza ipsum tribus cauteriis, cum cauterio oliuari magno: et fiat cauterio profunditas secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis totius.	If this cautery is not present to you, then cauterize it with three cauteries, with a large olive-shaped cautery; and let the depth of the cautery be according to the quantity of the thickness of the entire skin.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it, until it is healed.
Â¶ De modo cauterizandi in Sciatica.	On the method of cautery for sciatica.
Caput XLIII.	Chapter 43.
Quando accidit dolor in pixide anchae, et sunt caussa illius frigus et humiditates: et curatur infirmus cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, et antiquatur illud: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum ab humoribus grossis cum pillulis foetidis, aut cum pillulis artificialibus, et similibus.	When pain occurs in the ankle joint, and its causes are cold and humidity; and the weak place is treated with what we mentioned earlier, but the treatment does not help, and it worsens: then it is necessary to free the weak place from gross humors with foul-smelling pills, or with artificial pills, and similar things.
Deinde cauteriza eum.	Then cauterize it.
Et modus cauterii in ea est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum medicinis adurentibus, aut cauterium cum igne.	And the method of cautery in this case is according to two methods: either cautery with adhering medicines, or cautery with fire.
Cauterium cum igne, est secundum multos modos.	Cautery with fire is according to many modes.
Quorum unus est, ut cauterizes super pixidem anchae ipsius tribus cauteriis triangulatis, secundum hanc formam.	One of which is to cauterize over the ankle joint itself with three triangular cauteries, according to this shape.
Et fac eis profunditatem bonam, uel malam.	And make for them a good or bad depth.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium quantitatis grossitudinis digiti: sitque cauterium oliuare.	And let the space that is between all the cauteries be the quantity of the thickness of the finger, and let the cautery be olive-shaped.
Quandoque autem fit cauterium in medio super caput anchae ipsius.	When a cauterization is made in the middle above the anchor-shaped bone of the same head.
Quare sunt quatuor cauteria.	There are four cauterizations.
Et si uis cauteriza cum circulo, cuius praecessit forma in cauterizatione dislocationis anchae, uno: ut sit circulus continens ancham totam.	And if you want to cauterize with a circle, whose preceding form is in the cauterization of the dislocated anchor, one: so that it may be a circle containing the whole anchor.
Et combure spissitudinem cutis totius.	And burn the thickness of the entire skin.
Iste est modus cauterii in Sciatica, quando dolor est adhaerens anchae ipsi, et non extenditur usque ad coxam et crus.	This is the method of cauterization in Sciatica, when the pain adheres to the anchor itself, and does not extend as far as the hip and leg.
Si autem extenditur usque ad coxam et crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis super coxam, super locum ad quem innuit illic infirmus, in quo est dolor, et cauterio tuo super cauillam quatuor digitis ad partem syluestrem parumper: et sit cauterium cultellare.	If it extends as far as the hip and leg, then cauterize it with two cauterizations above the hip, above the place to which the illness reaches, where there is pain, and with your cauterization on the ankle four fingers towards the wooded part for a short time: and let the cauterization be gentle.
Et sit profunditas cauterii secundum profunditatem spissitudinis cutis.	And let the depth of the cauterization be according to the depth of the thickness of the skin.
Quod si infirmus innuit quod dolor extenditur usque prope digitos pedis, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic ubi innuit cum cauterio puncti, tribus, aut quatuor, aut pluribus, si indiget illo.	What if the illness reaches where the pain extends almost to the toes of the foot, then cauterize it there where it reaches with a point-cauterization, three, or four, or more, if that is what it needs.
Et si innuit dolorem esse sub genu uersus crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic cauterio uno cultellari.	And if it reaches where the pain is under the knee towards the leg, then cauterize it there with a gentle single cauterization.
Et caue tibi in omni cauterizatione tua, ut non ultimes cum cauterio ad hoc ut comburas neruum, aut arteriam magnam, et attrahas per illud super infirmum nocumentum malum, aut contractionem.	And take care in every cauterization of yours, so that you do not ultimately harm with the cauterization to the point of burning a nerve or a large artery, and attracting through it a great harmful evil or contraction.
Et ego quidem iam uidi unum et alium, ex eis qui cauterizauerunt supra cauillam, et ultimauerunt in cauterizatione, et inflatum est crus, donec tumor consecutus est pedem, et perforatus est totus, et corruptus est totus pes: deinde accidit solutio uentris, et mors post illud.	And I have indeed already seen one and another, among those who were cauterized above the ankle, and ultimately harmed in the cauterization, and the leg became inflamed, until a tumor followed to the foot, and it was entirely perforated, and the entire foot was corrupted: then there occurred a loosening of the intestine, and death after that.
Quod si dolor est in duabus partibus simul, cauteriza utramque secundum hunc modum.	If there is pain in both parts simultaneously, cauterize each one according to this method.
Et sapientes quidam dixerunt in cauterizatione anchae, cuius cauterii iste est modus.	And some wise men have spoken of a type of cauterization called "anchae", whose method is this cauterization.
Fac simile samio ex ferro, cuius diametrus sit medietas palmi: et sit apud orificium suum secundum grossitudinem nuclei dactyli, aut minus parumper: et intra illud samium sit samium tertium.	Make a similar iron instrument, whose diameter is half a palm: and let it be at its orifice according to the thickness of a finger's knuckle, or a little less: and inside that instrument let there be a third instrument.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne samium per quantitatem nodi pollicis: et sint samia aperta a duabus partibus: et sit altitudo eorum quasi nodus, aut duo nodi: et fac eis manubrium ex ferro decenter aptatum in samiis.	And let there be a space that is between the entire instrument by the size of a thumb's knuckle: and let the instruments be open at both parts: and let their height be like a knuckle, or two knuckles: and make for them a handle from iron, decently fitted to the instruments.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Deinde igniatur in igne, donec rubeat, et proiiciat scintillas: deinde ponatur super pixidem anchae infirmo accubitato super latus sanum.	Then it is heated in the fire until it glows red, and shoots out sparks: then let it be placed on a pad of "anchae" [a type of cauterizing agent] applied to the healthy side.
Cauteriza ergo eum tribus cauteriis rotundis in uice una.	Cauterize him therefore with three round cauters at one time.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then leave it for three days.
Postea emplastra cum butyro: et dimitte uulnus apertum diebus multis.	Afterwards apply a plaster with butter, and leave the wound open for many days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with an ointment until it heals.
Inquit Albucasis, hac specie cauterii o filii, parum usi sumus, propter terrorem aspectus eius: et propterea, quod paucos inuenimus qui expectent super ipsum.	Albucasis said, "We have used this type of cauterization little, on account of the terror of its appearance; and for this reason, we found few who would rely on it.
Verumtamen est ex bonis cauteriis ei qui suffert, et inuenit cum eo locum eius.	However, it is one of the good cauterizations for him who suffers from it, and finds a place for it.
Cauterium autem cum medicinis adurentibus est, ut tu facias duo samia habentia perforatam armillam, in quam descendit cardo portae eius ex aere, aut ferro, longitudo parietis: quorum in altitudinem eorum sint duo nodi, aut quasi ipsi.	The cauterization instrument is with medicinal applications, so that you make two iron instruments having a perforated armlet, in which descends the hinge of its door from copper or iron, with a length of a wall: whose height is two knuckles, or almost so.
Et sit spacium quod est inter utraque quantitas grossitudinis digiti, et sint aperta inferius et superius: et sit quod contineant se adinuicem, secundum hanc formam.	And let there be a space that is between the two quantities of the thickness of the finger, and let it be open below and above: and let it contain itself according to this form.
Deinde depone eam super pixidem anchae, infirmo iacente super latus sanum.	Then place it on a soft pillow, with the injured side lying on the healthy side.
Et comprime manum tuam super pixidem anchae multum.	And press your hand strongly on the soft pillow.
Deinde funde inter duos circulos ex aqua calida, quae sit calefacta cum igne parumper, et tene eam quantitate horae temporalis: et toleret infirmus mordicationem eius, et ipsius adustionem, nam ipse inuenit mordicationem sicut ignis, donec quiescat mordicatio.	Then apply between two circles made of hot water, which has been warmed with fire for a short time, and hold it for the quantity of an hour's timing: and let the injured person endure its biting and its burning, for he finds the biting as fire, until the biting subsides.
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum instrumento, et absterge aquam calidam ab ancha tota cum aqua dulci: deinde dimitte illud tribus diebus.	Then lift your hand with the instrument, and wipe away the hot water from the entire wound with sweet water: then leave it for three days.
Et pone super illud butyrum, donec remoueatur nigredo adustionis: et dimitte illud diebus aliquot, et curret ex eo pus.	And put butter on it, until the blackness of the burn is removed: and leave it for some days, and cleanse away the pus from it.
Est enim ultimum in iuuamento.	For it is the last stage in the treatment.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointments, until it heals.
Quod si extendatur dolor usque ad coxam, aut crus: fac ei statuam in eo quod continet aquam, secundum quod fecisti in ancha aequaliter.	If the pain extends to the hip or leg: make it stable in what contains water, according to what you did in the wound equally.
Et iste est modus aquae calidae: et ego iam scripsi eam in tractatu rectificationis medicinarum.	And this is the method of hot water: and I have already written it in the treatise on medical corrections.
Sume alcali, et calcis non extinctae amborum ana partem unam: tere utraque, et pone ea in ollam nouam, cuius inferior pars sit perforata foramine uno paruo, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum radius: et pone sub fundo ollae ollam aliam uitreatam: et proiice super alcali et calcem ex aqua dulci, quod submergat utraque per digitum: post quam tu comprimas ea manu tua compressione bona: et dimite ollam, donec descendat aqua acuta inferiori parte ollae uitreatae.	Take alkaline and unextinguished lime of both, one part each: grind both, and put them in a new pot, whose lower part is perforated with a small hole, according to the quantity that the radius can enter: and place under the base of the pot another treated pot: and pour over the alkaline and lime from sweet water, which submerges both by a finger's width: after which you press it down with your hand, using good compression: and leave the pot until the sharp water descends to the lower part of the treated pot.
Deinde aggrega illam aquam totam, et proiice eam super aliam calcem: et cola, donec renouetur.	Then gather all that water and pour it over a lime plaster; and strain it until it is renewed.
Ipsa enim erit tunc fortis acuitatis ualde, quae administratur in multis operationibus medicinae, et in cauterizatione reliquorum membrorum.	For it will be a strong solvent then, which is administered in many medical operations and in the cauterization of remaining limbs.
Quoniam efficit operationem ignis ipsius.	Because it produces the operation of fire itself.
Et ex medicinis sunt, cum quibus cauterizantur ancha, etiam sicut tesisie, et mel anacardi, et calx cum sapone, ita quod utraque sint permixta. Â¶	And they are from medicines, with which they cautetrize anch, and also as thesis, and honey of nutmeg, and lime with soap, so that both may be mixed together.
Et Galenus quidem narrando retulit, cuiusdam uiri ex antiquis curationem, qua curatus est dolor anchae et uenae sciaticae: et magnificauit esse eius ualde.	And Galen indeed recounted that a certain man from ancient cures, by which the pain of anch and sciatic vein was cured: and he magnified its value greatly.
Et dixit, quia non indiguit alia curatione, et quia sanatus est ex uice una, donec retulit, quia ipse fortasse intrauit balneum delatus, et exiuit ex eo iam sanus.	And he said that he did not need another cure, and that he was healed from one vein alone, until he recounted that perhaps he himself had entered the delayed bath, and came out of it already healthy.
Et est, ut accipiatur ex seitaragi uiridi: et si non inuenitur uiride, sumatur siccum, recens: et teratur multum cum aliquanto adipe, et ponatur super ancham, ubi est dolor, aut crus, aut in coxa: et ligetur, et dimittatur quantitate trium horarum, aut per quantitatem quod sentiat infirmus sedationem adustionis.	And it is, that it should be received from the green vegetation: and if the green is not found, take dry, fresh: and crush much with some fat, and apply to the anch, where there is pain, or leg, or in the hip: and bind, and leave for three hours, or for as long as the patient feels the soothing comfort of the application.
Deinde intromitte eum in balneum.	Then introduce him into a bath.
Cum ergo roridum fit corpus eius, intromitte ipsum in solium.	When therefore his body becomes relaxed, introduce it into a sunbeam.
Nam dolor recedit, et sanatur.	For the pain recedes, and he is healed.
Et scias, quia non oportet ut utatur aliquis cauterio cum istis medicinis, nisi post euacuationem corporis.	And know that it is not necessary to use any cautery with these medicines, unless after the evacuation of the body.
Et Dioscorides qui dem dixit, quod stercus caprarum, quando cum eo cauterizatur uena sciatica, confert ei: et fit cauterium secundum hunc modum.	And Dioscorides, who said that the dung of goats, when it is cautered with the vein of the sciatic, helps him: and it becomes a cautery according to this method.
Sumatur lana, et imbibatur oleo antiquo, et ponatur super locum profundum, qui est inter pollicem pedis, et inter focile, et est propinquior focili.	Take wool, and soak it in old oil, and apply it to the deep place, which is between the thumb of the foot and the ankle, and it is closer to the ankle.
Deinde accipe stercus caprarum siccum, et inflamma ipsum in igne, donec fiat carbo.	Then take dry goat dung and set it on fire until it becomes a coal.
Deinde pone ipsum super lanam, et dimitte ipsum, donec extinguatur.	Then put it on a woolen cloth, and let it stand until it is extinguished.
Deinde itera illud.	Then repeat that.
Non cesses ergo facere illud, usquequo perueniat sensus super mediatione usque ad ancham, et quiescat dolor.	Do not cease doing that until sensation returns to the affected part and the pain subsides.
Et iste modus cauterii nominatur cauterium Vaccinum.	And this method of cautery is called the Iron Cautery of Cowpox.
Â¶ De cauterizatione doloris Dorsi.	On the cauterization of back pain.
Caput XLIIII.	Chapter 44.
Quandoque accidit dolor in Dorso ex caussis multis, aut a casu, aut a percussione, aut euacuatione superflua, et illis similibus, ex infusione materiei frigidae, et humidae: et cauterium quidem non cadit, nisi in hac specie sola, quae fit ex infusione materiei frigidae.	When pain occurs in the back from multiple causes, either from a fall, or a blow, or excessive evacuations, and similar things, from the infusion of cold and moist material: and indeed cauterization is not applicable, unless in this single case, which arises from the infusion of cold material.
Oportet ergo post euacuationem infirmi cum pillulis foetidis, et eis similibus, ut fiant super Dorsum, ubi est dolor, tres lineae secundum latitudinem almeidati ipsius, postquam signas cum encaustro in omni linea quinque cauteria, aut plura secundum quantitatem quae uenit ex tolerantia infirmi uirtute eius: et fiat cauterizatio cum cauteriopuncti.	It is necessary therefore, after the evacuation of the patient with foul-smelling pills and similar things, to make three lines across the width of the affected part on the back where there is pain, then to mark each line with five cauteries or more according to the amount that comes from the tolerance of the patient's strength: and let the cauterization be done with cautery points.
Et si uis, cauteriza tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor, cum cauterio clauili mediali, secundum hanc formam.	And if you wish, cauterize with three or four cauteries, using the middle claw-shaped cauterization, according to this method.
Â¶ De modo cauterizandi in incaeptine Gibbositatis.	On the method of cauterizing in cases of gibbosity of the nape of the neck.
Caput XLV.	Chapter 45.
Multotiens accidit haec aegritudo infantibus paruis.	This disease often occurs in small infants.
Et signum incaeptionis eius in pueris est: quod accidit super eum strictura in anhelitu apud eleuationem, et motum: et inuenis in ultima spondilium Dorsi et nodorum eius, quod iam incaepit eminere super reliquos spondiles.	And the sign of this disease in children is that a constriction occurs above it with difficulty in breathing upon elevation, and movement: and you find it in the last vertebra of the back and its nodes, which already begin to emerge above the remaining vertebrae.
Cum ergo uides illud, et uis facere illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio quod sit circulus secundum hanc formam.	When you see that, and you want to do it, then cauterize it with a circular cautery according to this method.
Et capiat cauterium super omnem partem spondilis aequaliter: et si uis cauteriza in circumitu spondilis cum cauterio puncti duas lineas, aut tres: et sint puncta propinqua adinuicem.	And let him take the cautery equally over every part of the spine; and if you want to cauterize around the spine with a cautery point, two or three lines, and let the points be close together.
Deinde cura locum, donec sanetur cum eo quod diximus.	Then treat the place until it is healed with what we have said.
Et caue, ne administres cauterium in gibbositate, quae fit in spasmo nerui.	And beware, lest you administer the cautery to a hump, which occurs in a spasm of a nerve.
Â¶ De modo cauterizandi in Podagra, et doloribus iuncturarum.	On the method of cauterizing for gout and joint pains.
Caput XLVI.	Chapter 46.
Quando dolores iuncturarum sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, quae effunduntur ad cuiuslibet membra corporis, tunc quando accidunt dolores in pedibus, de consuetudine medicorum est, ut nominent illud Podagram proprie.	When joint pains are caused by cold and humid influences that flow to any member of the body, then when pains occur in the feet, it is customary for doctors to call it gout specifically.
Cum ergo curatur Podagra frigidae caussae cum modis curationis, et non remouentur dolores, tune cauterium remouet eos.	When therefore gout caused by cold is treated with the methods of treatment and the pains are not removed, then cautery removes them.
Et est, ut cauterizes eum post euacuationem in circumitu iuncturae pedum, cauteriis multis: et sit cauterium Oliuare.	And it is that you should cauterize him after evacuation around the joint of the foot with many cauteries; and let the cautery be oily.
Cuius haec est forma.	This is its form.
Et si indiges ut punctes super faciem pedis, tunc fac cum cauterio puncti.	And if you need to make points on the surface of the foot, then make them with a cautery point.
Quod si ascendunt dolores usque ad genua, aut reliquas iuncturas, et multotiens accidit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super omne genu tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor ab omni parte, cum hoc eodem cauterio Clauili.	What if the pains ascend as far as the knees or other joints, and it often happens that, then cauterize it over every knee with three cauteries, or four from every part, with the same cautery of Clavi.
Si autem necessaria sunt tibi plura hoc cauterio, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	If however more are needed for you with this cautery, then cauterize it.
Et non submergas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit circiter spissitudinem cutis tantum.	And do not immerse your hand with the cautery, but rather let it be around the thickness of the skin only.
Si autem ascendunt dolores ad genua, et dorsum: tunc administra quod diximus ex cauterio in capitulo suo.	If however the pains ascend to the knees and back, then administer what we have said about cautery in its chapter.
Quod si dolores sunt in manibus tantum, tunc puncta in circumitu focilium, sicut reuoluuntur duae lineae.	What if the pains are only in the hands, then make points around the wrists, as two lines revolve.
Si autem remanet ex doloribus in digitis, tunc puncta eos, super omnem nodum punctum, et super pectinem manus.	If however it remains from pains in the fingers, then prick them, above every knot a pricked point, and above the palm of the hand.
Si autem ascendunt dolores post dies ad cubitos, aut ad humeros, tunc cauteriza utrosque ab omni parte.	If however pains ascend after days to the elbows or to the shoulders, then cauterize both from every part.
Et non euacues infirmum ex regimine bono, ex recaeptione medicinarum.	And do not evacuate the weakened place from good regime, from reception of medicines.
Nam si bonum fiat regimen, et euacuetur phlegma, sanabitur auxilio Dei cum isto cauterio.	For if a good regime is made, and phlegm is evacuated, it will be healed with the help of God along with this cautery.
Â¶ De modo cauterizandi in Rupturis.	On the method of cautering for hernias.
Caput XLVII.	Chapter 47.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, et descendit intestinum, aut zirbum ad testiculum, et est illud incipiens propinquum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo dimittere comestionem in die suo.	When a hernia occurs in the groin, and the intestine descends, or the scrotum to the testicle, and it is a beginning nearby: then it is necessary that you should release the constriction of the weakened part on its own day.
Et utatur ex lenientibus, quo descendat stercus a uentre suo.	And let it be treated with gentle remedies, so that the feces may descend from its own belly.
Deinde sedeat inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et praecipe ei, ut teneat anhelitum suum, donec egrediatur, uel appareat zirbum, aut intestinum.	Then sit between your hands on its back: and order it to hold its breath, until it goes out, or the scrotum appears, or the intestine.
Deinde reduc ipsum digitis tuis, et signa cum encaustro sub Ruptura super os pectinis, cum signo cuius extremitas sit similis medietati circuli ad superiora corporis.	Then reduce it with your fingers, and mark with a hot iron under the hernia above the bone of the thigh, with a mark whose extremity is similar to the middle of a circle towards the upper body.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma, donec ueniat album, et proiiciat seintillas.	Then apply the cautery iron, which has this form, until it reaches the white part, and produces a small blister.
Deinde reduc intestinum, aut zirbum ad concauitatem suam.	Then reduce the intestine or scrotum to its concavity.
Deinde ponat minister manum suam super locum, ut non exeat intestinum: et tu iam aperuisti inter crura infirmi, et posuisti sub eo puluinar, et seruiens alius super crura eius, et alius super pectus eius qui tenet manus.	Then the assistant should place his hand on the spot, so that the intestine does not come out: and you have now opened between the thighs of the weakened person, and placed a pillow under him, and one servant is above his thighs, and another above his chest who holds his hands.
Deinde depone cauterium super ipsum signum, manu tua cum cauterio stante recta.	Then place the cautery iron on that mark, your hand with the standing upright cautery iron straight.
Et tene ipsum, donec cum eo consequaris os: aut itera cum eo uice alia, si non consecutus fueris cum eo in prima usque ad os.	And hold it, until you reach the bone: or go around with it to another place, if you have not succeeded with it at first until you reach the bone.
Et prudenter obserua ab exitu intestini in hora cauterizationis tuae, ne comburas ipsum, et eueniat per illud super infirmum aut mors, aut malicia magna.	And wisely observe from the exit of the intestine at the time of your cauterization, lest you burn it, and it may happen through that to the weak or dying, or great evil.
Et scias, quod quando tu non consequeris cum cauterio os, non confert operatio tua.	And know that when you do not succeed with the cautery to the bone, your operation does not help.
Et oportet ut sit cauterium infantium subtile, secundum mensuram eorum.	And it is necessary that the cautery for infants be subtle, according to their measurement.
Deinde cura cum reliquis unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat with the remaining ointments, until they are healed.
Et sit infirmus iacens super dorsum suum quadraginta diebus, donec sigilletur uulnus.	And let the weak person lie on their back for forty days, until the wound is sealed.
Et oportet, ut ponas nutrimentum eius longitudine temporis curationis eius, quod leniat uentrem eius: ut non exeat intestinum apud conamen et egestionem.	And it is necessary to put a nutrient of the same length of time as his cure, which will soothe his stomach: so that he may not vomit and expel the intestine through straining and evacuation.
Deinde quando uult surgere post quadraginta dies, tunc administra ligamentum decenter factum, et teneat ipsum quadraginta diebus aliis.	Then when he wants to get up after forty days, then administer a well-made bandage, and hold it for another forty days.
Et minoretur a labore, et repletione cibi et potus, et uocibus uehementibus.	And he should be moderate in labor, and in the replenishment of food and drink, and in vehement voices.
Nam quando utitur hoc regimine, ita sanatur sanatione integra.	For when he uses this regimen, he will be healed with a complete healing.
Et ego dicam curationem Rupturarum cum incisione in capitulo suo.	And I will describe the treatment of Hernias with an incision in its chapter.
Quando autem Rupturae accidunt in reliquo uentre, et sunt incipientes, et uis ut non addantur, tunc cauteriza Rupturam eius cauterio rotundo secundum quantitatem eius: et sit illud quod aduritur ex tunc sicut tertia eius.	When Hernias occur in the rest of the abdomen, and are incipient, and it seems as if they should not be added to, then cauterize that Hernia with a round cautery according to its quantity: and let what is touched from then on be like a third of it.
Deinde cura ipsum, cum eo quod diximus: et non addetur.	Then treat it, with what we have said: and do not add to it.
Et iam dixerunt quidam primi: ut cauterizetur Ruptura cum cauterio triangulato, secundum hanc formam.	And now some first authorities have said: that a Hernia should be cauterized with a triangular cautery, according to this form.
Postquam signatur cum encaustro, et ponitur linea quae est per latitudinem in latere superiori Rupturae, et linea altera ad inferius.	After it is marked with a cautery, and a line is applied which runs across the width of the upper part of the rupture, and another line below.
Et depone manum tuam in medio cum cauterio clauili.	And place your hand in the middle with a cautery having a clamp.
Sed cauterium primum est facilius et melius.	But the first cautery is easier and better.
Â¶ De modo cauterizandi in doloribus propter casum, aut percussionem.	On the method of cautery in painful areas due to a fall or blow.
Caput XLVIII.	Chapter 48.
Quando accidit in quibusdam membris a casu, aut percussione dolor: et perseuerat ille dolor tempore longo, et non confert in eo curatio cum medicinis: tunc oportet ut cauterizetur cum cauterio Puncti.	When pain occurs in certain limbs due to a fall or blow, and the pain persists for a long time and is not helped by medical treatment, then it is necessary to apply cautery with a pointed cautery.
Et sit cauterium omnis membri cauterium secundum magnitudinem eius, et ipsius paruitatem, et debilitatem eius, et ipsius uirtutem, et locationem torsionis, et doloris ex eo.	And let the cautery be suited to each member according to its magnitude, and its own smallness, and its weakness, and its own virtue, and the location of the twist, and the pain resulting from it.
Si ergo sanatur ex cauterio primo, est bene.	If therefore it is healed by the first cautery, that is good.
Si non: tunc itera super ipsum cauterium.	If not: then repeat over the same cautery.
Quoniam de consuetudine horum dolorum est, ut permutentur ex membro ad illud quod appropinquat ei.	Since it is customary with these pains that they shift from one member to the one that approaches it.
Quare oportet ut consequaris eos cum cauterio, donec sanetur infirmus.	Therefore it is necessary to pursue them with a cautery until the weak part is healed.
Â¶ De modo cauterizandi in Lepra.	On the method of applying cautery for Leprosy.
Caput XLIX.	Chapter 49.
Leprosi autem quandoque iuuantur cauterio iuuamento maximo.	But leprosy patients are sometimes helped by a cautery with the greatest aid.
Et praecipue species Leprae, quae fit propter putrefactionem phlegmatis et melancholiae: cum ergo uis cauterizare ipsam considera.	And especially the type of leprosy which occurs due to putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy; therefore one should carefully consider the power of applying cautery to it.
Si ergo Lepra est ineipiciens, et curasti eam cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non descendit, neque stat: et times super infirmum, quod comprehendat corruptio super totam complexionem eius: tunc cauteriza eum super caput quinque cauteriis: uno in medio capitis noto, et secundo inferius eo uersus frontem apud finem capillorum, et duobus super duo cornua, et uno posterius super nucea ceruicis.	If therefore the leprosy is incurable, and you have treated it with what we said in the division, and it does not recede, nor remain stationary: and at times it spreads over the entire complexion of the patient; then apply cautery to him on the head with five cauteries: one in the middle of the head at the notch, and a second below that towards the forehead at the end of the hair, and two on both horns, and one behind on the nape of the neck.
Et ultima manum tuam cum cauterio parumper, donec imprimat in os impressionem paruam, et dislocentur ex eo cortices: ut alleuietur expiratio uaporum grossorum ex eo, et cauteriza cauterio etiam super ipsum splenem, secundum quod praecessit.	And you should cauterize your hand thoroughly with a branding iron, until it makes a small impression on the skin, and the cortices are dislocated from it: so that the gross vapors may be expelled from it, and the branding iron is also applied above the spleen, according to what has preceded.
Sin autem Lepra iam sparsa est super infirmum, et apparet manifeste: tunc oportet ut cauterizes cum istis cauteriis, quae diximus in capite, et cauterio super extremitatem nasi, et duobus cauteriis super duas maxillas, et duobus cauteriis super spondiles colli, et sex super spondiles dorsi, et uno magno super alhahosos apud gran caudae et uno supra ipsum, in ipso almeidati: et duobus super anchas: scilicet super omnem ancham uno, et duobus super genua: uno super omne genu, et duobus super humeros, et duobus super cubitos, et duobus super teneritudines pectoris sui: et cauteriza ipsum super omnem iuncturam, ex iuncturis digitorum manuum suarum, et pedum suorum: et cauteriza super omnem calcaneum pedum suorum, et focilia manuum suarum.	But if the leprosy has already spread over the patient and is manifestly apparent, then it is necessary to cauterize with those branding irons which we described in the head, and to apply the branding iron above the nose, and two branding irons on each cheek, and two on the vertebrae of the neck, and six on the vertebrae of the back, and one large one at the base of the tailbone and one above it, in the same place; and two on the shoulders: namely, one on each shoulder, and two on the knees: one on each knee, and two on the hips, and two on the elbows, and two on the tenderness of their chest: and to cauterize over every joint, from the joints of their fingers and toes; and to apply the branding iron above every heel of their feet, and to the soles of their feet.
Et caue tibi a neruis qui sunt super postremum calcanei, ut non comburas eos.	And be careful not to touch with those branding irons the veins that are on the back of the heel, lest you burn them.
Et quandoque cauterizatur cauterio super os pectinis, et alio super os stomachi, et alio super epar.	And when it is cauterized with a branding iron above the breastbone, and elsewhere above the stomach, and elsewhere above the liver.
Et scias, quod quanto plus addis cauterium, est magis iuuamentum, et magis conferens.	And know that the more you add to the branding iron, the greater the benefit will be, and the more it will help.
Et scias, quod infirmus non inuenit in cauterio dolorem, sicut inueniunt ipsum sani: propterea, quod corpus eius iam stupefactum est.	And know that the sick person does not find pain in the branding iron, as the healthy ones do: because their body is already numb.
Et oportet ut sint cauteria ex magnitudine, et paruitate secundum membra et iuncturas: secundum quod praecessit ex speciebus ferramentorum.	And it is necessary that the branding irons be of a size and smallness according to the members and joints: according to what has preceded from the types of iron instruments.
Deinde cura cauterium ex farina herbi cum melle, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then treat with a branding iron made from the flour of herbs with honey, and other treatments, until they are healed.
Â¶ De modo cauterizandi in Stupore.	On the method of cauterizing in a stump.
Caput L.	Head 50.
Quando stupet aliquod membrum, et curatur cum medicinis, et oleis, et emplastris, et non sanatur, tunc cauteriza ipsum membrum stupefactum cauteriis, secundum quod meretur magnitudo membri, aut paruitas eius.	When a stump of some member is treated with medicines and oils and plasters, and it does not heal, then one should cauterize the affected member with caustics, according to what the size of the member merits or its smallness.
Et sit cauterium tuum intrans in spissitudinem cutis parumper.	And let your cautery be gentle, not penetrating too deeply into the skin's thickness.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with an ointment until it heals.
Et quandoque cauterizatur ad quiddam stuporis, qui accidit manui, et pedi, in spondilibus dorsi apud exitum neruorum, qui mouent illud membrum: et remouetur stupor.	And when cauterization is applied to a certain kind of numbness that occurs in the hand and foot, in the vertebral column of the back near the exit of the nerves, which move that member; and the numbness is removed.
Verum non praesumat super illud, nisi qui est sapiens in anatomia membrorum, et egressione neruorum mouentium corpus.	But it does not presume to work on that, unless he who is skilled in the anatomy of members and the exit of nerves moving the body.
Â¶ De modo cauterizandi in Albaras.	On the method of cauterizing in Ulcers.
Caput LI.	Head 51.
Quando antiquatur Albaras, et non confert in eo aliquid ex ingeniis medicinae: tunc cauteriza super ipsam cauterio profundo parumper, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis, donec remoueatur albedo, et mutetur color eius.	When an ulcer is antiquated and nothing helps it through the ingenuity of medicine: then one should cauterize on it with a deep cautery, gently, according to the quantity of the skin's thickness, until the whiteness is removed and its color is changed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum farina herbi, et lentis cum oleo rosa, et foliis arnoglossae, et sanguine columbae, et sanguine hyrundinis: de unoquoque sit pars una: misceantur haec omnia, et liniantur super pannum, et adhaereant loco, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with flour of herbs, and lentils with rose oil, and leaves of arnoglossa, and pigeon's blood, and swallow's blood: each one should be a single part: mix all these together, and apply them to the cloth, and adhere to the place, until it heals.
Â¶ De modo cauterizandi in Cancro.	On the method of cauterizing in Cancer.
Caput LII.	Head 52.
Quando Cancer est incipiens, et uis ipsum sistere: tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio circuli in circuitu eius, sicuti reuoluitur.	When a cancer is beginning and one wishes to stop it: then one should cauterize it with a ring-shaped cautery around its circumference, as it turns back.
Sapientes autem dixerunt, ut cauterizetur cauterio ultimo in medio.	The wise men have said that it should be cauterized with the final cautery in the middle.
Mihi autem non uidetur illud: quoniam timeo quod ulceretur: et ego iam uidi illud aliquotiens.	It does not seem to me that it will become an ulcer; because I fear that it will become inflamed: and I have already seen that several times.
Et rectius est, ut cauterizetur in circumitu eius cum circulo, sicut diximus: aut cauteriis multis.	And it is better to cauterize around it with a circle, as we have said: or with many cauterizations.
Â¶ De modo cauterizandi in Adubelati.	On the method of cauterizing in Abu al-Qasim.
Caput LIII.	Chapter 53.
Quando aliquis habet Adubelati, et tardatur in maturatione, aut propter superfluitatem facientem eam, aut propter aetatem infirmi, quando est decrepitus pauci sanguinis, aut propter tempus, et uis festinare in maturatione Adubelati, tunc cauteriza in circumitu eius cum cauteriis paruis multis punctando.	When someone has an abscess and it is slow to mature, either because of excessive superfluous matter or because of the weakness of the patient, when they are decrepit and have little blood, or because of the time, and there is a need to hasten the maturation of the abscess, then one should cauterize around it with many small points, puncturing with multiple small cauterizations.
Deinde dimitte eam.	Then leave it alone.
Nam ipsa festinabit cum maturatione.	For it will hasten the maturation itself.
Si autem uis perforationem eius cum cauterio, tunc igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma.	If you want to make a perforation in it with a cautery, then ignite the cautery, whose shape is this.
Et depone ipsum in medio Adubelati, donec penetret cutem: et sit cauterium ab eo quod sequitur infirmus, ut alleuietur cursus puris.	And place it in the middle of the abscess, until it penetrates to the skin: and let the cautery be away from what follows, so that the flow of pus may be alleviated.
Deinde cura ipsum donec sanetur.	Then treat it until it is healed.
Â¶ De modo cauterizandi in malo corrodente.	On the method of cauterizing a corroding evil.
Caput LIIII.	Chapter 54.
Corrodens non est nisi corruptio in membro ambulans, et corrodit ipsum: sicut ignis comedit ligna sicca.	A corroding evil is nothing but a corruption spreading through the member, and it consumes it, just as fire devours dry wood.
Si ergo uides corrodentem in loco qui toleret cauterium cum igne, tunc igni cauteria multa, clauilia parua et magna, secundum quod conueniet illi loco in quo est corrodens.	If therefore you see a corroding evil in a place that can tolerate a cautery with fire, then ignite many cauteries, small and large nails, according to what is suitable for the place where the corrosion is.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum ab omni parte donec eradices corruptionem totam, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid penitus.	Then cauterize it on every side until you eradicate the entire corruption, and nothing of it remains deeply.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super loca cauterizata sulphur tritum cum oleo, donec eradicentur escharae omnes, et omnis corruptio.	Then leave it for three days, and apply sulfur powder with oil to the cauterized places, until all scabs are eradicated and all corruption.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis generantibus carnem.	Then treat it with ointments that generate flesh.
Si ergo uides, quod post tres dies caro nascitur natiuitate sana, in qua non est corruptio, est bonum.	If therefore you see that after three days a healthy flesh is born without corruption, it is good.
Et si non: tunc itera cauterium super illud quod remansit ex locis corruptis.	And if not, then apply cautery to the remaining corrupted area.
Et corrodens medicatur quandoque cum medicina acuta.	And corroding treatments are applied when needed with acute medicine.
Ipsa namque surgit loco cauterii.	That very thing grows in place of the cautery.
Verumtamen cauterium cum igne est uelocioris iuuamenti: et ego quidem iam dixi cauterizationem eius cum medicina acuta in diuisione: accipe ergo eam illic quando ea indiges.	However, cautery with fire is a very swift remedy; and I have already said that its cauteration with acute medicine is in division; therefore take it there when you need it.
Â¶ De modo cauterizandi in Clauis, et Verucis.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in cases of boils and abscesses.
Caput LV.	Chapter 55.
Multotiens accidit in inferioribus partibus pedum haec aegritudo: et est res grossa, filtrata, quae laedit pedem.	It often happens that this disease occurs on the soles of the feet: and it is a rough, filthy thing that hurts the foot.
Et cauterium quidem in eis est secundum duos modos: cauterium cum igne, et cauterium cum aqua calida.	And indeed, there are two methods of cautery for these cases: cautery with fire and cautery with hot water.
Quantum autem cum igne est, ut ignias cauterium concauum simile pennae uulturis: quod fiat ex ferro, secundum quantitatem quod contineat clauum ab omni parte: et sit subtilium marginum.	As for the cautery with fire, it is like a hollow pointed instrument resembling a bird's feather, made from iron, according to the quantity that it contains, encompassing the boil on all sides; and let its edges be subtle.
Deinde depone ipsum ignitum super clauum.	Then place the ignited instrument on the boil.
Deinde reuolue manum cum cauterio in circumitu claui, donec perueniat cauterium ad profunditatem claui: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, donec incipiat emittere pus.	Then rotate the hand with the cautery around the boil, until the cautery reaches the depth of the boil; and leave it for three days, until it begins to discharge pus.
Deinde emplastra ipsum cum maluis syluestribus, contritis cum sale: et dimitte emplastrum super ipsum in nocte.	Then apply a plaster made with forest moss, mixed with salt; and leave the plaster on it overnight.
Ipse enim eradicabitur ex radicibus suis.	For it will be eradicated from its roots.
Deinde cura locum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then treat the area with an ointment that generates flesh, until it is healed.
Quod si sunt non conuersi, et multotiens accidunt in superficie corporis, praecipue in manibus et pedibus: tunc administres in eis cauterium cum aqua calida: et est, ut accipias cannulam ex aere, aut ferro, aut ex penna uulturis: et depone eam super clauum, aut althelul.	If they are not converted, and often occur on the surface of the body, especially on the hands and feet; then administer to them cautery with hot water; and it is done by taking a cannula made from copper, or iron, or a bird's feather; and place it on the boil, or abscess.
Deinde proiice in cannulam ex aqua calida quantitatem paucam: retine manum tuam, et tu reuolue eam cum compressione manus tuae parumper, ut imprimatur margo cannulae in radice claui, et inueniat aqua calida uiam ad profundum, ad radicem claui: et expectet infirmus parumper super mordicationem aquae calidae hora una.	Then pour into the canal a small amount of warm water: hold your hand back, and you will revolve it with the compression of your hand for a short time, so that the mark of the canal is imprinted on the root of the nail, and the warm water finds its way to the bottom, to the root of the nail: and the weak patient should expect for an hour above the mordication of the warm water.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, nam clauus eradicatur cum radicibus suis.	Then let it go, for the nail is eradicated with its roots.
Ita fac cum eis uno post unum, donec uenias super omnes qui ex eis sunt in corpore.	Do the same with each of them one after another, until you come to all those that are in the body.
Deinde cura eos postquam eradicantur, cum eo quod generat carnem ex unguentis.	Then treat them afterwards when they are eradicated, with that which generates flesh from ointments.
Â¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tremore.	On the method of cauterizing in Tremors.
Caput LVI.	Chapter 56.
Quando accidit alicui Tremor ex frigore in neruo, aut ex febre quartana, aut alio: tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis, aut quinque super spondiles dorsi, et inter omnem spondilem cauterio, et in pectore eius cauterio, et super stomachum eius cauterio.	When a person suffers from Tremors due to cold in the nerve, or from quartan fever, or something else: then it is necessary to cauterize him with four cauteries, or five on the vertebrae of the back, and on each vertebra a cauterization, and on his chest a cauterization, and above his stomach a cauterization.
Tremor enim quiescit cum cauterio oliuari, et festinat sanitas aegritudinis frigidae.	For the Tremor is quieted with an oily cauterization, and health is quickly restored from cold sickness.
Â¶ De modo cauterizandi Albathir.	On the method of cauterizing by Albathir.
Caput LVII.	Chapter 57.
Quandoque expelluntur in corpore Albathir foedae, id est, pustulae, quae fiunt a materiis grossis corruptis.	When there are formed on the body of Albathir foul things, that is, pustules, which come from corrupted gross materials.
Oportet ergo in primis cum apparent, ut cauterizentur super omne caput pustulae cauterio subtili cum ligno myrti, cuius extremitas accensa est cum igne.	It is necessary therefore at first when they appear, to cauterize above every pustule with a subtle cauterization of myrtle wood, whose end has been kindled with fire.
Aut cum radice aristolochiae longae.	Or with the root of long aristolochia.
Aut cum cauterio lenticulari.	Or with a lentricular cauterization.
Et quandoque cauterizantur ademenul, in principio expulsionis suae secundum hunc modum: et non augentur: et disrumpitur superfluitas faciens eos, et sanatur ex eis.	And when they are cauterized to the point of menstruation, at the beginning of their expulsion in this way: and they do not increase: and the superfluous discharge is broken down, making them healthy from it.
Verumtamen oportet ut fiat illud post euacuationem cum phlebotomia.	However, it is necessary that this be done after evacuation with bloodletting.
Â¶ De modo cauterizandi in fluxu sanguins ex arteria in uulnere.	About the method of cauterizing a bleeding artery in the hollow of the elbow.
Caput LVIII.	Head 58.
Multotiens accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, quae incisa est apud uulnus, quod accidit extrinsecus, aut apud incisionem apostematis, aut cauterium membri, et similia eis: et fit difficile abscindere eum.	It often happens that there is a bleeding of the artery which was cut near the elbow, which occurs externally, or at the incision of an abscess, or by cauterization of a limb, and similar things; and it becomes difficult to stop it.
Cum ergo accidit alicui illud, tunc propera cum manu tua ad orificium arteriae, et pone super ipsum digitum tuum indicem: et stringe eum multum, donec obsessus sit sanguis sub digito tuo, et non egrediatur ex eo aliquid.	When it happens to someone in that way, then quickly put your hand over the orifice of the artery, and place your index finger on top of it: and press it strongly, until the blood is stopped under your finger, and nothing comes out of it.
Deinde pone in ignem cauteria oliuaria parua, et magna numero plura: et suffla super ea, donec fiant ignita ualde.	Then put small oil-based cauteries on the fire, and a large number of them: and blow on them, until they are strongly ignited.
Deinde accipe ex eis unum, aut paruum, aut magnum, secundum uulnus et locum, in quo disrupta est arteria, et depone cauterium super ipsam uenam, post quam tu remoues digitum tuum festinanter: et tene cauterium, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then take one of them, either small, or medium, or large, according to the elbow and place where the artery is disrupted, and apply the cautery to the vein, after which you quickly remove your finger: and hold the cautery until the bleeding stops.
Quod si expellatur cum eleuas digitum ab orificio arteriae, et extinguis cauterium, tunc accipe cauterium aliud festinanter, ex cauteriis quae in igne sunt praeparata.	If the bleeding is expelled when you lift your finger from the orifice of the artery, and you extinguish the cautery, then quickly take another cautery, from those that are prepared on the fire.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum uno post aliud, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Do not cease to do this with one after another until the bleeding stops.
Et caue, ne comburas neruum qui est illic, et accidat super infirmum malicia alia.	And be careful, lest you burn the nerve that is there, and another evil malady occurs to the patient.
Et scias, quod quando ex arteria fluit sanguis, tunc non est possibile abscindere ipsum: praecipue quaudo arteria est magna, nisi cum uno quatuor modorum.	And know that when blood flows from an artery, then it is not possible to stop it: especially when the artery is large, unless with one of four methods.
Aut cum cauterio, sicut diximus.	Or with a cautery, as we have said.
Aut cum extractione, quando non est extracta.	Or with extraction, when it has not been extracted.
Nam quando extrahitur, contrahuntur extremitates eius, et abscinditur sanguis.	When it is extracted, its extremities are constricted and the blood is separated.
Aut ligetur cum filo ligatione forti.	Or it is tied with a strong thread of a ligature.
Aut ponantur super ipsum medicinae de proprietate, quarum est abscindere sanguinem, et stringatur cum puluinari constrictione decenti.	Or medicine of special property is applied to it, which is to separate the blood, and it is bound with a decent constriction of a poultice.
Qui autem administrat abscisionem eius cum ligamento, et strictura cum panno, aut positione rerum comburentium, et similium, non confert ei penitus, nisi raro.	Whoever administers its amputation with a ligature and constriction with cloth, or application of burning things, and similar things, does not benefit it thoroughly, unless rarely.
Si autem accidat alicui illud, et non sit ei praesens medicus, neque medicina: tunc incipiat cum positione digiti indicis super orificium uenae ipsius, sicut narrauimus, et constrictione eius ualde, donec obsessus sit sanguis a superiori parte uulneris, et super arteriam.	If it happens to someone in that way, and there is no doctor present, nor medicine: then he should start with the application of the index finger on the opening of the vein, as we have narrated, and constriction, until the blood is stopped from the upper part of the wound, and above the artery.
Et digitus non remoueatur, desuper ipsum cum aqua frigida uehementis frigoris semper, donec congeletur sanguis, et ingrossetur, et abscindatur.	And the finger should not be removed, but rather kept on it with very cold water of vehement cold, until the blood congeals, and coagulates, and is separated.
Et interim consideret in eo, quid indiget ex cauterio, aut ex medicina.	And meanwhile, one should consider what is needed from cauterization or from medicine.
Â¶ Partis Primae Finis.	End of the First Part.
Liber Chirurgici Albucasis Pars II.	The Surgical Book of Albucasis, Part II.
Â¶ De Incisione, Perforatione, et Phlebotomia in uulneribus, et his similibus.	On Incision, Perforation, and Phlebotomy in wounds, and similar things.
Iam Diximus in Capitulo Primo, omnem aegritudinem in qua conueniens est cum igne cauterium et medicina comburente, et occasiones eius, ipsius caussas, et instrumenta eius, et formas cauteriorum.	We have discussed in the First Chapter all the diseases in which it is convenient to use a burning cautery and medicine, and their occasions, their causes, instruments, and forms of cauteries.
Et posui illic capitula a uertice usque ad pedem.	And I have placed chapters from the head to the foot.
Et ego procedam in hoc capitulo illa eadem uia: ut alleuietur super quaerentem quaesitum eius.	And I will proceed in this chapter by the same method, so that it may be alleviated above the seeker of his question.
Et antequam incipiam illud, oportet ut addiscatis o filii, quod in hoc capitulo est ex terrore illud quod est in capitulo primo de cauterizatione.	And before I begin that, it is necessary for you to learn, my sons, what is in this chapter, which is from the fear of that which is in the first chapter about cauterization.
Et propter illud oportet, ut sit cautela in eo uehementior, quoniam in operatione quae est in hoc capitulo, multotiens cadit euacuatio cum sanguine, cum quo stat uita apud apertionem uenae, aut incisionem super apostema, aut apertionem exiturae, aut curationem uulneris, aut extractionem sagittae, aut incisionem super lapidem, et illis similia: ex quibus omnibus associatur tremor, et timor, et cadit in pluribus eorum mors.	And because of that, it is necessary to be cautious in this matter, since in the operations which are described in this chapter, very often a failure occurs with bleeding, whether it be an opening of a vein, or an incision over an abscess, or an opening of an exit wound, or a treatment of an injury, or an extraction of an arrow, or an incision over a stone, and similar things: from all of which there is associated trembling, and fear, and many of them die.
Et ego moneo uos, ne cadat super uos illud in quo est haesitatio, nam quandoque cadunt ad uos in hac arte modi hominum cum modis infirmitatum.	And I warn you, lest that which is hesitation should fall upon you, for when they fall to you in this art of healing men with methods of the sick.
Ex eis enim est qui irascitur cum aegritudine sua, et est leuis apud eum mors: propter uehementiam eius quod inuenit ex infirmitate sua et longitudine eius maliciei.	For there is one who becomes angry with his own illness, and death is easy for him: because of the violence of that which he finds from his own infirmity and the length of his evil.
Et cum aegritudine est ex timore quod significat mortem.	And illness is from fear, which signifies death.
Et ex eis est, qui dat tibicensum suum, et ditat te cum eo, sperans sanitatem, et aegritudo eius est perniciosa.	And there is one who gives his own physician, and he says to you with it, hoping for health, and his illness is pernicious.
Non ergo oportet ut consentiatis ei qui uenit ad uos ex eis, cuius modus est talis.	Therefore it is not necessary to consent to him who comes to you from those whose method is such.
Et sit cautela uestra uehementior, quam cupiditas et uestra rapacitas.	And let your caution be more vehement than your desire and your rapaciousness.
Et non praesumatis super aliquid ex illo, nisi post scientiam certam, quae uerificat apud uos illud ad quod peruenit successio laudabilis.	And do not presume upon anything from that, unless after certain knowledge, which verifies for you that thing to which a laudable success has come.
Et utimini in curatione omnium infirmorum uestrorum, prognosticatione et indicatione de eo ad quod conuenienter sit salus.	And be diligent in the treatment of all your sick ones, in prognosis and indication of that which is convenient for their salvation.
In illo namque est uobis adiutorium super acquisitionem famae et gloriae, et memoriae et laudis.	For in that lies the helper for you to acquire fame and glory, and memory and praise.
Inspiret uobis Deus o filii, intellectum suum, et non auferat uobis directionem et inspirationem: quoniam illud est in manu eius.	May God inspire you, O sons, with His intellect, and may He not take away from you direction and inspiration: for that is in His hand.
Et ego quidem ordinaui hoc Capitulum distinguendo per capitula, secundum quod praecessit in capitulo Cauterii, a ceruice usque ad pedes: ut alleuietur uobis quaesitum quod uultis ex eo, et quo indigetis.	And I have arranged this chapter by distinguishing it into sections, according to what has preceded in the chapter on cauterization, from the head to the feet: so that you may be freed from the inquiry which you wish to make about it, and where you are in need.
Â¶ De curatione Aquae quae aggregatur in capitibus puerorum.	On the treatment of water that accumulates on the heads of children.
Caput I.	Chapter I.
Scias, quod haec infirmitas multotiens accidit pueris apud partum: aut quando stringit obstetrix caput pueri absque leuitate.	You know that this weakness often happens to children at birth: or when the midwife tightly grasps the child's head without gentleness.
Et quandeque accidit etiam ex caussa occulta quae non scitur.	And it also happens sometimes due to a hidden cause that is not known.
Et ego quidem non uidi hanc aegritudinem in aliis quam in pueris: et ad omnem quem ex eis uidi properauit mors: propter illud ergo uisum est mihi dimittere operationem in ea.	And I have not seen this illness in others than in children: and to all whom I saw among them, death hastened; therefore it was advisable for me to abandon the operation on them.
Et ego quidem uidi ex eis puerum, cuius caput impletum erat aqua, et caput magnificabatur in omni die, donec non poterat sedere super seipsum, propter magnitudinem capitis sui: et humiditas augmentata fuit, donec mortuus est.	And I have seen among them a child whose head was full of water, and his head grew magnificent every day, until he could not sit up by himself, because of the greatness of his head: and the humidity increased until he died.
Et haec quidem humiditas, aut aggregatur inter cutem et os: aut aggregatur sub osse super sifac.	And this moisture indeed collects either between the skin and bone: or it collects under the bone above the dura mater.
Et operatio in illo, si est humiditas inter cutem et os, et apostema est paruum, tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis fissura una in latitudine: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo nodi, donec currat humiditas.	And the operation on that, if there is moisture between the skin and bone, and the abscess is small, then it is necessary to make a single fissure in the middle of the head, in width: and let the length of the fissure be almost two nodes, until the moisture flows out.
Et haec est forma spatumilis.	And this is the method of incision.
Si ergo humiditas est magis augmentata, et apostema est maius, tunc pone eas duas fissuras, secundum formam hanc.	If therefore the moisture has increased more, and the abscess is larger, then make two fissures, according to this method.
Et si humiditas est sub osse, et signum eius est, quod uides commissuras capitis apertas ab omni parte: et aqua deprimitur quando comprimis eam manu tua ad interiora, et non occultatur tibi illud: tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis tribus fissuris, secundum hunc modum.	And if the moisture is under the bone, and its sign is that you see the sutures of the head open on every side: and the water is pressed out when you compress it with your hand towards the interior, and it does not hide from you: then it is necessary to make three fissures in the middle of the head, according to this method.
Et post incisionem extrahe humiditatem totam.	And after the incision, extract the entire humidity.
Deinde stringe fissuras cum pannis et puluillis.	Then stitch up the fractures with swaths and plugs.
Deinde embroca illud desuper cum uino et oleo usque ad diem quintum.	Then apply a poultice on top of it with wine and oil until the fifth day.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et cura uulnus cum tentis, et unguentis.	Then loosen the bandage, and care for the wound with tents and ointments.
Et non dimittas stringere caput cum aequalitate.	And do not cease to bind the head with evenness.
Et ciba infirmum omni cibo sicco paucae humiditatis, usquequo confortetur membrum, et sanetur.	And give the patient all dry food of little humidity, until the limb is comforted and healed.
Et modus alius incisionis est, ut consideres ubi apparet magnitudo apostematis, et collectio aquae.	And another method of incision is, that you should consider where the greatness of the abscess appears, and the collection of water.
Quoniam quandoque est in occipitio plus, aut in sincipite, aut in dextra, aut in sinistra.	For when it is more in the back of the head, or in the forehead, or on the right, or on the left.
Ascende ergo cum incisione ubi apparet tibi apostema et impletio aquae: et scinde illud secundum quod tibi possibile est.	Ascend therefore with the incision where you see the abscess and the collection of water, and cut that according to what is possible for you.
Et obserua, ne incidas arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis, et moriatur infirmus ex illo fluxu cum euacuatione humiditatis.	And observe, lest you cut an artery, and a flow of blood occurs, and the patient dies from that flow with evacuation of humidity.
Â¶ De incisione Arteriarum quae sunt post aures.	Concerning the incision of arteries which are behind the ears.
Caput II.	Head 2.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri ad oculos, aut ad pectus, et antiquatur illud, et non confert curatio medicinarum: tunc magis ultima curatio est in illo, incisio harum duarum arteriarum.	When some flux occurs to the eyes, or to the chest, and it becomes chronic, and medical treatment does not help: then the ultimate remedy is in that, the incision of these two arteries.
Oportet ergo quando uis incidere eas, ut radat infirmus caput suum.	It is necessary therefore when you wish to cut them, that the patient shaves his head.
Deinde frica locum cum panno aspero, ut appareant arteriae.	Then rub the place with a rough cloth, so that the arteries appear.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum, cum quolibet panno suo.	Then the patient should bind his neck with any cloth of his own.
Deinde considera, ubi pulset uena.	Then consider where the vein pulsates.
Et loca utriusque sunt loca quae sunt post aures depressa: et raro occultatur, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	And the places of both are depressed places which are behind the ears; and they are rarely hidden, except in certain men.
Deinde signa cum encaustro super utraque: et incide utramque cum spatumili utrimque acuro, incisione perueniente ad os: et fiat illud per latitudinem capitis.	Then mark with a branding iron on both sides; and cut each one with a sharp instrument, making the incision penetrating to the bone, and let it be made along the width of the head.
Et si uis, intromitte spatumile sub arteria, et incide eam ad superiora cum incisione.	And if you wish, insert a spatula-like instrument under the artery, and cut it above with an incision.
Et sit longitudo incisionis quasi duo digiti iuncti.	And let the length of the incision be almost two fingers joined together.
Nam quando inciditur uena, egreditur sanguis egressione pulsatili, qui salit ad interiora saltu frequenti.	For when a vein is cut, blood flows out in a pulsating flow, which leaps inward with frequent jumps.
Si autem arteria non apparet sensui, tunc oportet ut mensures ab aure quantitatem spacii trium digitorum.	If the artery does not appear to the senses, then it is necessary to measure from the golden (surface) a quantity of space of three fingers.
Deinde signa cum encaustro, et finde usque ad os.	Then mark with a branding iron, and open up to the mouth.
Et illud quod oportet emittere ex sanguine, est VI uncia et fortasse emittis ex eo plus, aut minus.	And that which it is necessary to emit from the blood is six ounces, and perhaps more or less will be emitted from it.
Totum illud secundum quantitatem quae apparet tibi ex uirute infirmi et repletione arteriae eius.	All of that according to the quantity which appears to you from the virtue of the weak person and the replenishment of their artery.
Deinde considera ad uulnus.	Then consider the ulcer.
Tunc si remanet ad os ex sifac aliquid, tunc incide illud, ut non accidat apostema calidum: tunc stringe uulnus cum liciniis ex panno lini.	Then if something remains at the mouth of the ulcer, then cut that out, so that a hot aposteme does not occur: then bind the ulcer with a linen bandage.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with an ointment, until it is healed.
Â¶ De extractione arteriarum, quae sunt in timporibus.	Of the extraction of arteries, which are in the temples.
Caput III.	Chapter 3.
Quando accidit homini hemicranea antiqua, aut catarri acuti propter humiditates acrimoniales, et caliditate in lacertis timporum, aut soda antiqua, uehemens, et similia illis: et medicatur cum modis curationis medicinae, et non confert illud: tunc experti sumus in his aegritudinibus extractionem arteriarum ex timporibus, aut cauterizationem earum, sicut narrauimus.	When an old hemicrania affects a man, or acute catarrh due to acidic humidities, and heat in the temples, or an old sore, ulcerous, and similar things: and he is treated with the modes of medical cures, and it does not help: then we have experienced in these illnesses the extraction of arteries from the temples, or their cauterization, as we have narrated.
Et modus operationis in extractione earum, est, ut radat infirmus pilos qui sunt in timporibus, et intendat ad arteriam apparentem in timpore.	And the method of operating in their extraction is that the weak person should shave the hair that are on the temples, and direct himself to the apparent artery in the temple.
Ipsa namque ostenditur tibi ex pulsu suo, et raro occultatur nisi in paucis hominibus, aut uehementia frigoris.	It itself is shown to you by its pulse, and is rarely hidden except in a few men, or due to the weakness of cold.
Quod si occultatur tibi, tunc stringat infirmus caput suum cum quolibet panno suo: deinde frica locum cum panno aspero.	What if it is hidden from you, then the weak head presses its own cloth with whatever cloth it has; afterwards scrub the place with a rough cloth.
Aut uapora locum cum aqua calida, donec appareat tibi apparitione manifesta.	Or pour warm water over the place until it appears to you in clear manifestation.
Deinde accipe spatumile, quod paulo ante formaui.	Then take a spatula, which I had previously formed.
Deinde excoria cum eo cutem cum facilitate, donec peruenias ad arteriam.	Then scrape off the skin with it easily, until you reach the artery.
Deinde proiice in eam uncinum, et extrahe eam ad superiora, donec extrahas eam ex cute, et facias eam euadere ex tunicis quae sunt sub ea ab omni parte.	Then insert a hook into it, and extract it upwards, until you have extracted it from the skin, and make it emerge from the tissues that are beneath it on all sides.
Si autem arteria est subtilis: tunc inuolue eam cum extremitate uncini.	If the artery is subtle: then envelop it with the extremity of the hook.
Deinde incide ex ea partem secundum quantitatem qua elongentur extremitates eius, et contrahantur, et non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Then cut from it a secondary part according to the quantity by which its extremities are elongated and contracted, and so that there is no flow of blood.
Nam si non inciditur, et si non abscinditur, non ascendit sanguis penitus.	For if it is not cut, and if it is not separated, the blood does not ascend deeply.
Deinde euacua ex sanguine ana VI unci, usque ad .III.	Then evacuate the blood with a sixth of an ounce, until there are three.
Quod si arteria est magna: tunc oportet ut liges eam in duobus locis ex filo duplo, forti, ex serico: aut ex chordis alhohod, ut non properet ad ipsam putrefactio ante consolidationem uulneris, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	If the artery is large: then it is necessary to tie it off in two places with double thread, namely, with silk or with cord of Arabic fabric, so that putrefaction does not occur before consolidation of the wound, and a flow of blood happens.
Deinde incide superfluitatem, quae est inter duo ligamenta.	Then cut away the excess, which is between the two ligatures.
Fac illud in illa hora, aut post horam aliam.	Do that at that hour, or after another hour.
Et si uis, cauteriza eam cauterio usque ad os, cum cauterio cultellari: donec incidantur extremitates eius, et stabit loco eiusdem operis.	And if you wish, cauterize it with a cautery up to the mouth, with a cautery of a knife edge: until its extremities are cut off, and it is stabilized in place of the same operation.
Et est melius opus, nisi si infirmus habet febrem, autest calefactae complexionis.	And it is a better work, unless the patient has a fever, or is of a hot constitution.
Quoniam cauterium est ex eis, quae iuuant ad finiendas humiditates.	Since cautery is one of those things that help to end moistures.
Ergo est melius iuuamentum.	Therefore, it is better treatment.
Et oportet post extractionem arteriarum, ut impleatur locus cotto antiquo: et ponantur super ipsum puluilli decenter facti.	And it is necessary after the extraction of the arteries, that the place be filled with old cotton: and that small pillows made from lint be placed on top.
Et post solutionem curetur cum medicinis siccis, quae faciunt nasci carnem, et cum liciniis, donec sanetur.	And after the treatment is completed with dry medicines, which cause flesh to grow, and with bandages, until it becomes healthy.
Quod si interim dum operaris accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, tunc propera ad abscindendum eum cum cauterio, aut ut impleas locum cum zegi: et stringe manum tuam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Because if during the operation a flow of blood occurs from the artery, then you should quickly move to stop it with a cautery, or fill the place with cerate: and bind your hand tightly, until the bleeding is stopped.
Quod si nihil ex illis est tibi praesens, tunc pone super locum digitum tuum, donec congeletur sanguis.	Because if none of these is available to you, then put your finger on the place, until the bleeding congeals.
Et embroca locum cum aqua uehementis frigoris, donec quiescat acuitas, et stringatur secundum quod oportet.	And wrap the place with water and very cold compresses, until the inflammation subsides, and bind according to what is necessary.
Et ex eo quod est leuius et facilius extractione arteriae, est, ut cauterizes uenam cum hoc cauterio habente duos cultellos: sitque acuitas duorum cultellorum similis almagdatem.	And of what is lighter and easier in the extraction of the artery, it is to cauterize the vein with this cautery having two blades: and let the inflammation be similar to that of two-bladed almagdatem.
Verumtamen sunt multo minoris acuitatis, quam duo cultelli.	However, they are much less inflamed than two-bladed ones.
Quoniam si sunt acutae, sicut duo cultelli, properat utrisque frigus: et non incidunt carnem cum uelocitate.	Since if they are sharp, like two-bladed ones, cold should be applied quickly: and they do not cut the flesh with swiftness.
Cum ergo in eis est aliquantulum grossitudinis, tenetur in eis calor ignis, et abscinditur caro uelociter: cum hoc ergo opus est melius omni opere, et leuius, et facilius.	Since therefore there is some roughness in them, heat of fire is retained in them, and the flesh is quickly cauterized: since this is better than any other work, and lighter, and easier.
Et sit spacium quod est inter duos cultellos quantitas grossitudinis digiti, postquam tu signas duo loca cum encaustro: et depone utrosque ignitos ualde, donec perueniant ad os, et incidant uenam in duobus locis: ut elongetur quod est inter extremitates eius.	And let there be a space that is the amount of roughness of a finger's width between two blades, after you have marked two places with ink: and place both ignited cauterizing irons strongly, until they reach the bone, and cut the vein in two places: so that what is between the extremities may be lengthened.
Nam non consolidantur cum hoc cauterio penitus.	For they do not consolidate deeply with this cautery.
Et haec est forma cauterii.	And this is the form of cautery.
Â¶ De cura cursus lachrymarum acutarum assiduarum ab oculis.	On the treatment of chronic and acute tears flowing from the eyes.
Caput IIII.	Chapter 4.
Quando sunt lachrymae assiduae, et est cursus earum ex uenis, quae sunt super craneum capitis exterius: et non confert in eis aliquid curationis medicinae cum medicinis, et uides faciem infirmi iam rubere, et sentit in fronte sua deambulationem, sicut est deambulatio formicarum: et oculi eius sunt extenuati, humidi, ita quod iam corrosi sunt pili eorum cum corrosione: et calefactae sunt palpebrae eius ex acuitate lachrymarum: tunc antiqui indiguerunt in curatione earum hac operatione, et denominauerunt eam curationem, cum Ense.	When there are persistent tears and the flow of them is from the veins that are on the outside of the skull, and nothing seems to help with medical treatment or medicines, and you see the face of the patient already red and weak, and they feel a numbness in their forehead, like the numbness of ants, and their eyes are exhausted, humid, as if already corroded, with the corrosion of their eyelashes; and their eyelids are hot from the sharpness of the tears: then the ancients were in need of a cure for this operation, and they named it "Ense".
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere pilos qui sunt in fronte sua.	And it is, that you should prescribe to the patient to shave the hairs that are on their forehead.
Deinde incide in fronte tres fissuras aequedistantes secundum longitudinem frontis: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo digiti, et fissura una sit aequedistans longitudini nasi in medio frontis, et secunda secundum longitudinem parumper a motu lacertorum, et tertia a parte altera: et caue ab incisione arteriarum quae sunt in duobus lateribus: et elonga manum tuam a continuatione duarum mandibularum, et sit spacium omnis incisionis quantitas trium digitorum coniunctorum: et sit tibi frustum spongiae praeparatum, aut panni siccati multi, cum quibus exsicces sanguinem.	Then make three equal distant incisions in the forehead along its length: and let the length of each incision be about two fingers, and one incision should be opposite the middle of the nose in the forehead, and the second should be along the direction of the movement of the eyebrows, and the third on the other side: and be careful not to cut the arteries that are on both sides: and extend your hand from the continuation of the two jaws, and let the width of the entire incision be three fingers joined together: and have a piece of prepared sponge or many dry cloths ready, with which you will dry the blood.
Deinde intromitte spatumile duarum acutarum extremitatum, cuius mox sequens est forma.	Then insert a cautery iron of two acute extremities, whose following shape is this.
Ab incisione quae est a parte timporis, usque ad incisionem secundam: et excoria cum eo totam cutem, quae est inter duas incisiones, cum sifac, quod est super os.	From the incision that is on the temporal part, up to the second incision: and scrape out with it all the skin that is between the two incisions, together with the sifa, which is above the bone.
Deinde fac illud etiam ab incisione media usque ad incisionem secundam.	Then do the same also from the middle incision up to the second incision.
Deinde extrahe hoc spatumile, et intromitte in incisionem primam iterum instrumentum aliud, quod nominatur cultellare acutum, ab una parte lene, non acutum ab altera parte.	Then extract this spatula-like instrument, and insert it into the primary incision again, another instrument called a sharp scalpel, having one side blunt, not sharp on the other side.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et pone latus eius acutum uersus carnem annexam cum cute, et latus eius lene uersus os: et impelle ipsum, donec perueniat ad fissuram mediam: et abscinde cum eo omnia uasa, quae descendunt a capite ad oculos: praeter quod continuetur incisio usque ad illud quod apparet de cute.	And place its sharp side towards the flesh attached to the skin, and its blunt side towards the bone; and push it until it reaches the middle fissure: and cut with it all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes; except for what is contained in the incision up to what appears from the skin.
Deinde fac illud in fissura media usque ad fissuram aliam.	Then do the same in the middle fissure up to another fissure.
Et postquam currit ex sanguine quantitas aequalis, exprime loca ex frustis sanguinis coagulati.	And after a quantity of blood equal to what has flowed out has accumulated, press the locations with fragments of clotted blood.
Deinde pone in omnem fissuram licinium ex cotto ueteri, et pone super eos puluillos imbibitos in uino, et oleo, aut aceto.	Then put a linen cloth into every fissure, soaked in old wine, and put over them small pads soaked in wine, oil, or vinegar.
Et uide ut non accidat apostema calidum.	And see to it that a hot abscess does not form.
Et in die tertia solue ligamentum, et administra infusionem multam cum aqua tepida.	And on the third day, loosen the bandage, and administer a gentle infusion with lukewarm water.
Deinde cura illud ex unguento basilicon, et reliquis quibus curantur uulnera: usquequo sanetur.	Then treat it with royal ointment, and the other remedies by which wounds are treated, until it is healed.
Â¶ De cura lachrymarum acutarum et catarrorum ad oculos ex interioribus capitis.	Concerning the treatment of sharp eye discharges and catarrhs from within the head to the eyes.
Caput V.	Chapter 5.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri acuti, acres, assidui: et uides oculos eius extenuatos, paruos, et iam debilitatus est aspectus eorum: et palpebrae ulceratae, et cadunt pili ex eis, et in profundo capitis est dolor acutus, laedens, et sternutatio consequens: tunc sume ex istis accidentibus, quod illae materiae, et catarri non ueniunt, nisi ex uenis multis.	When sharp catarrhs occur, bitter, persistent; and you see the eyes of that person strained, small, and already their sight is weakened; and the eyelids are ulcerated, and hair falls out from them, and in the depths of the head there is a sharp, annoying pain, and a resulting sneezing fit: then take it from these symptoms, that those materials and catarrhs do not come unless from many veins.
Et melior curatio in eis est haec.	And the better treatment for them is this.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere frontem suam.	And it is, that you should prescribe to scrape the patient's forehead with a razor.
Deinde incide in eam fissuram unam in medio frontis, aut alterius parumper per latitudinem, et incipe cum fissura a timpore sinistro ad timpus dextrum: et sit incisio usque ad os: et elonga manum tuam a lacertis timporum, qui mouentur apud masticationem: donec quando detegitur os: et exsiccabis totum sanguinem cum spongia.	Then cut into the fissure one in the middle of the forehead, or another somewhat across the width, and begin with the fissure at the left temple to the right temple: and let the incision be up to the bone: and stretch out your hand from the temples that move during mastication: until the bone is detected: and you will dry up all the blood with a sponge.
Tunc separa inter duo labia fissurae cum cotto ueteri, aut cum liciniis ex lino.	Then separate between the two lips of the fissure with a gauze of old cloth, or with a linen thread.
Deinde stringe desuper cum puluillis: et imbibe puluillos cum uino et oleo, ut non accidat apostema calidum.	Then sprinkle on top with powders: and moisten the powders with wine and oil, so that a hot aposteme does not occur.
Et quando soluis illud, et uides quod apostema calidum iam imminuitur: tunc oportet ut frices os, donec incipiat in eo nasci caro.	And when you dissolve that, and you see that a hot aposteme is already imminent: then it is necessary to rub the bone, until flesh begins to grow on it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum regimine exiccatiuo quod facit nasci carnem: sicut si accipias ex farina tritici partes duas, et ex colophonia quatuor partes: et praepares ex eis emplastrum, et administretur ad natiuitatem carnis in istis uulneribus.	Then treat it with a drying regimen that promotes the growth of flesh: as if you take two parts of wheat flour and four parts of rose oil, and prepare an ointment from them, and administer it to promote the growth of flesh in these wounds.
Â¶ De cura eius quod cadit in Aurem.	Concerning the treatment of what falls into the Golden (wound).
Caput VI.	Chapter 6.
Omne Quod in Aurem cadit, est una quatuor specierum: aut lapis mineralis, aut simile lapidi, sicut ferrum, et uitrum: aut est ex planta, sicut est cicer, et fabae: aut est res fluxibilis, sicut aqua, et acetum, et eis similia: aut aliquod animal.	Everything that falls into the Golden (wound) is of one of four species: either a mineral stone, or something similar to a stone, such as iron and glass; or it is from a plant, such as chickpea and beans; or it is a fluid thing, such as water, vinegar, and similar things; or it is an animal.
Quando ergo cadit in aurem lapis, aut genus lapidis ex eis quae non adduntur, neque crescunt in aure, expone Aurem soli: si ergo uides lapidem, tunc distilla in Aurem aliquid ex oleo uiolato, aut sisamino.	When therefore a stone falls into the Golden (wound), or a type of stone from those that do not adhere nor grow in the Golden, expose the Golden to the sun: if you see the stone, then distill into the Golden something from violet oil or sisanmine.
Deinde administra extractionem eius, et fac sternutare cum condisi, et opila nares apud aduentum sternutationis, postquam tu ponis in circumitu auris frusta ex pannis, aut lana, et extendis aurem ad superiora.	Then administer the extraction of it, and make it sneeze with condiments, and block the nostrils at the approach of sneezing, after you place around the ear a wrapping of cloth or wool, and stretch the Golden to the upper parts.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum hac cura.	For many times indeed it is customary with this treatment.
Si autem non egreditur, tunc administra extractionem eius cum Gesti, id est, Pizigarolis subtilibus: cuius forma est haec.	If it does not come out, then administer the extraction of it with gestures, that is, with subtle manipulations: whose form is this.
Si ergo egreditur cum gesti, est bonum.	If therefore it comes out with gestures, it is good.
Et si non, tunc administra extractionem eius cum uncino caeco subtili paucae duplicationis.	And if not, then administer the extraction of it with a subtle curved hook of little duplication.
Si ergo non egreditur per illud, tunc fac cannulam ex aere, et intromitte extremitatem cannulae in foramen auris multum, et opila quod est in circumitu cannulae cum caera mollificata cum oleo, ut non sit uento uia nisi cannulae: deinde extrahe cum uento tuo attractione forti.	If therefore it does not come out through that, then make a tube of copper, and insert the end of the tube into the ear opening, and block what is around the tube with soft wax mixed with oil, so that there may be no passage except through the tube: then extract with your strong attraction.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus.	For many times indeed it comes out with what we have narrated.
Si autem non egreditur hoc modo: tunc accipe ex helkalimbat, aut ex uisco, id est, gluten praeparato, cum quo capiuntur aues, rem modicam: et pone ipsum in extremitate radii postquam tu inuoluis super eam cotum decenter positum: deinde intromitte ipsum in foramen auris cum facilitate, postquam tu exiccas aurem ab humiditate.	If it does not come out in this way: then take from helkalimbat, or from uisco, that is, prepared glue, with which birds are caught, a small amount: and place it on the end of the vein after you have applied a clean cloth positioned over it: then insert it into the ear opening with ease, after you have cleansed the ear from moisture.
Si ergo non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc propera ad scindendum, antequam accidat apostema calidum, aut spasmus.	If therefore it does not come out with all that we have narrated, then proceed to cutting, before a hot aposteme or spasm occurs.
Et modus fissurae est, ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis in cephalica: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum mensuram uirtutis eius.	And the method of cutting is, to make an incision in a weak spot at the beginning on the head: and extract from it blood according to the measure of its strength.
Deinde fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et conuerte aurem eius ad superiora, et finde fissuram paruam in radice auris apud adipem eius in loco depresso ipsi: et sit fissura lunaris figurae, donec peruenias ad lapidem: deinde aufer eum cum eo, quod est tibi possibile ex instrumentis.	Then make the weak spot sit between your hands, and turn its ear towards above, and find a small cutting in the root of the ear at its fatty depression: and let the cutting be a lunar figure, until you reach the stone: then remove it with what is possible for you from the instruments.
Deinde sue fissuram ab hora tua cum uelocitate, et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then sew up the cutting from that time on with speed, and care for it, until it heals.
Quod si res cadens in aurem est ex uno granorum, quae crescunt, et inflantur: tunc administra extractionem eius.	What falls into the ear is from one of the grains that grow and become inflamed: then administer its extraction.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc accipe spatumile tenue, subtile, secundum hanc formam.	If it does not obey you at the outlet, then take a thin, subtle spatula, following this form.
Et administra cum eo abscisionem illius speciei ex granis, quae cadunt in aurem, et non facias illud, quando tu cogitas, quod illud granum iam humectatum est per uaporem auris, donec ponis ipsum frusta multa: deinde extrahe ea cum uncinis, aut cum gesti subtili, aut cum suctione, sicut diximus, nam extractio eius alleuiatur.	And administer with it the cutting away of that type of grain that falls into the ear, and do not make that when you think it has already been moistened by the vapor of the ear, until you apply many vigorous strokes: then extract it with a hook, or with gentle gestures, or with suction, as we have said, for the extraction of those grains is eased.
In aqua autem quae ingreditur in aurem, oportet ut utatur infirmus sternutatione cum condisi in primis: et iam impleuit aurem suam cum aliquanto cotto ueteri: et est iacens super illam aurem, in qua est aqua.	In the water that flows into the ear, it is necessary to use a gentle irrigation with condis at first: and already the ear has been filled with some old cotton: and it lies upon the ear, in which there is water.
Si ergo egreditur per illud, est bonum.	If it comes out through that, it is good.
Et si non: tunc accipe lapides multos, secundum longitudinem digiti, tenues, lenes, et calefac eos cum igne parumper, et intromittat infirmus ex eis unum in foramen auris suae: et saliat super pedem suum unum ex illa parte, et percutiat cum lapide alio super lapidem qui est in aure.	And if not: then take many small stones, according to the length of the finger, thin, smooth, and warm them with fire for a short time, and gently insert one of them into the ear opening: and let it rest on its base from that side, and strike with another stone upon the stone that is in the ear.
Non ergo cesset facere illud cum lapide et lapide, donec egrediatur tota aqua.	Do not cease to do that with stone and stone, until all the water comes out.
Et iam egreditur aqua ita, ut accipias ex parpyro, aut ex iunco unum, et intromittas extremitatem eius unam in aurem: et accendas extremitatem alteram cum igne, donec comburatur plurimum eius.	And now the water comes out thus, that you take one from a small paper, or one reed, and insert one extremity into the ear: and apply the other extremity with fire, until it burns most of it.
Deinde itera iuncum alium, et fac illud multotiens, donec egrediatur tota aqua: et extrahe ipsam cum cannula secundum quod praemissum est in lapide.	Then take another reed, and do that many times, until all the water comes out: and extract it with a cannula according to what has been previously mentioned concerning the stone.
In extractione autem animalis intrantis in eam, si est parui corporis, ut pulex, et ei simile, cura ipsum sicut dixi in diuisione.	In the extraction of an animal that has entered into it, if it is small in body, such as a flea, and similar to it, cure it as I have said in the division.
Sed si est corporis magni, quod appareat sensui: tunc administra extractionem eius cum gesti, et uncinis: et res eius est facilior omnibus, quae tenentur in aure.	But if it is a large bodily thing that appears to the senses, then administer its extraction with gestures and hooks: and its removal is easier for all those things that are held in gold.
In extractione autem uermis generati in aure, quando curas eum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et in tractatu distilationum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut aspicias aurem in sole.	In the extraction of a worm generated in gold, when you treat it with what we said in the division, and in the treatment of distillations, and your cure does not work: then it is necessary to look at the gold in the sun.
Si ergo apparet illic aliquid ex uermibus, tunc extrahe illud cum gesti, aut cum uncinis subtilibus.	If therefore something appears there from the worms, then extract it with gestures or with subtle hooks.
Si autem non apparet illic aliquid, tunc accipe cannulam, cuius haec est forma, stricta inferius, ampla superius: et intromitte extremitatem subtilem in aurem secundum quantitatem quod tolerat eam infirmus: deinde suge cum ea suctione forti.	If however something does not appear there, then take a cannula, whose form is strict below and wide above: and insert the subtle extremity into the gold according to the quantity that the weakened part can tolerate: then suck with a strong suction.
Fac illud multotiens, donec egrediantur omnes uermes.	Do it many times, until all the worms come out.
Si autem non obediunt tibi ad exitum, tunc opila circumitum cannulae cum caera, sicut dixi in lapide.	If however they do not obey you to come out, then grease the circumference of the cannula with wax, as I said in the stone.
Quod si non egrediuntur cum eo quod diximus: tunc administra distillationes quas iam experti sunt antiqui in interfectione uermium: et inuenies illud in tractatu distillationum.	What if they do not come out with what we said: then administer the distillations which the ancient experts have already tried in the treatment of worms: and you will find it in the treatment of distillations.
Et sit effusio tua qua effundis olea et medicinas in aurem cum hoc instrumento, cuius forma depicta est hic.	And let your pouring be where you pour oils and medications into the gold with this instrument, whose form is depicted here.
Sicut uides fac ipsum ex argento, aut aere, inferius strictum, in quo sit foramen paruum, amplum superius.	As you see make it from silver or copper, below strict, where there is a small hole, wide above.
Sit ergo ut impellens quod est in concauitate cannulae, sit ex aere decenter factum.	Let it be thus, that which is in the concavity of the cannula, let it be made from copper, decently crafted.
Et si uis, accipe radium, et inuolue in extremitate eius cottum inuolutione decenti: deinde proiice oleum, aut succum, aut quod uis ex istis medicinis in cannulam: et ipsa sit in aure: deinde intromitte radium cum cotto desuper, et exprime ipsum manu tua compressione temperata, donec impellatur oleum in concauitate auditus, et sentiat ipsum infirmus interius: et illud quod infunditur in aurem, sit iam calefactum cum igne parumper: et caue ne sit res quae distillatur in eam frigida ualde: medicinae enim non tolerant illud.	And if you wish, take a rod, and wrap a cotton thread around its extremity with a decent wrapping: then pour oil, or juice, or whatever you wish from these medications into the cannula: and let it be in the gold: then insert the rod with the cotton thread above, and press it with your hand's tempered compression, until the oil is impelled into the concavity of the audit, and the weakened part feels it inwardly: and what is poured into the gold should already be warmed up with fire for a short time: and beware lest there be something that distills in it, very cold indeed: for medications do not tolerate that.
Â¶ De cura opilationis accidentis Auri.	On the treatment of an injury to the auricle.
Caput VII.	Chapter 7.
Quandoque egrediuntur quidam infantes ex uentribus matrum suarum non perforati.	When some infants are born from their mothers' wombs unopened.
Et iam accidit etiam quibusdam hominibus opilatio in meatu Auris a uulnere, aut carne nata in ea.	And it has also happened to some people that a swelling occurs on the tragus of the ear from a wound or a congenital growth in it.
Et haec opilatio quandoque fit in profundo foraminis Auris, quam non consequitur uisus: et quandoque accidit ad exteriora foraminis parum, et consequitur eam uisus.	And this swelling sometimes occurs deep within the ear canal, which does not affect the vision; and sometimes it occurs at the outer end of the ear canal, and then affects the vision.
Illa ergo quae accidit in profundo Auris, et quam non comprehendit aspectus, est in pluribus dispositionibus difficilis sanationis.	Therefore, that which occurs deep within the ear, and which does not affect the sight, is in many cases difficult to cure.
Et in illa quam consequitur uisus, oportet ut ponas Aurem infirmi in sole, et aspicias in ea: tunc si uides opilationem apparentem, aperi eam cum spatumili subtili, cuius forma est haec quae sequitur, sit extremitas eius in qua sit quaedam latitudo parua, cuius quaedam pars sit acuta: et reliquum spatumile sit duarum laterum lenium: ut non laedat aurem.	And in that which affects the vision, you should place the ear of the patient in a sunny spot and gaze at it; then if you see an apparent swelling, open it with a subtle spatula, whose shape is as follows: its extremity is where there is some small width, part of which is acute; and the rest of the spatula is gentle on both sides, so that it does not harm the ear.
Si ergo opilatio est a carne nata in meatu auris: tunc tene eam cum uncino subtili, et incide eam cum facilitate uehementi, donec auferatur tota caro.	If therefore the swelling is from a congenital growth in the ear canal, then hold it with a subtle hook, and cut into it with gentle violence, until the entire flesh is removed.
Quod si opilatio est in profundo auris: tunc accipe radium subtilem, lenem, et calefac ipsum cum igne parumper: deinde mitte ipsum in meatum auris.	If the swelling is deep within the ear, then take a subtle rod, gentle and warm it with fire for a short time; then insert it into the ear canal.
Si ergo senseris opilationem cum eo, quod inuenit infirmus cum grauitate auditus, conare apertionem eius cum facilitate: et caue, ne uulneres neruos auris.	If therefore you feel the swelling with it, which the patient finds with difficulty of hearing, try to open it gently; and beware, lest you wound the nerve of the ear.
Deinde pone in aurem licinium secundum quantitatem amplitudinis foraminis, quod inuoluisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud aliquot diebus, donec sis securus de consolidatione uulneris.	Then put on the ear a dressing according to the size of the ear canal, which you have wrapped in Egyptian unguent; do this for several days, until you are certain about the healing of the wound.
Aut accipe licinium, et infunde ipsum in aqua rosata, et pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, et utere ipso.	Or take a dressing, and soak it in rose water, and sprinkle on top of it powdered zegi powder, and use it.
Quod si uides aurem iam apostemari: tunc oportet ut extrahas licinium, et permittas ipsum cum licinio alio, quod inuolues in caeroto quod sit factum cum oleo rosato, donec sedetur apostema calidum: deinde cura ipsum usquequo sanetur.	If you see that the golden ointment is about to suppurate, then it is necessary to extract the pus, and let it flow out with another poultice, which you have prepared with rose oil, until the warm aposteme is formed; then treat it until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis: tunc submerge spongiam, aut pannos in aqua frigida, et pone super eam aurem: et utere reliqua curatione, quae abscindit fluxum sanguinis praedicta in tractatu distillationum.	But if a flow of blood occurs: then soak a sponge or cloth in cold water and place it on the golden ointment; and use the remaining treatment that stops the predicted flow of blood, as described in the treatise on distillations.
Â¶ De cura Altheli palpebrarum.	On the treatment of eyelids with Altheli.
Caput VIII.	Chapter 8.
Isti Althelil qui accidunt in Palpebris oculi, quandoque sunt humidi, et sunt sicci.	These are the Altheli that occur on the eyelids of the eye, when they are moist and become dry.
Oportet ergo ut teneas eos cum tenaliis: aut cum uncino, et incidas eos cum spatumili a radicibus suis.	It is necessary therefore to hold them with a bandage: or with a hook, and to cut them off at their roots with a spatula.
Deinde pone super loca zegi tritum.	Then apply powdered zegi to the affected area.
Si autem ex eis fluat sanguis, tunc cauteriza eos cum cauterio lenticulari subtili.	If blood flows from them, then cauterize them with a subtle lentiform cautery.
Et cauterizare eos, est melius post incisionem.	And it is better to cauterize them after the incision.
Multotiens enim redeunt quando remanet ex radicibus suis aliquid.	For they often return when something remains from their roots.
Et quando cauterizantur cum igne, comburuntur illae radices, et non redeunt.	And when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned, and they do not return.
Â¶ De cura Grandinum palpebrarum oculi.	On the treatment of pustules on the eyelids of the eye.
Caput IX.	Chapter 9.
Multotiens accidit in palpebris aliquid quod assimilatur Crandini in fortitudine sua, et sua duricie, et propter illud nominatur Grando: et est aggregatio humiditatis grossae in palpebra superiore, et palpebra inferiore.	It often happens that something occurs on the eyelids which is similar to a Crandino in its strength and hardness, and because of this it is called a Grando; and it is an aggregation of coarse moisture on the upper eyelid and lower eyelid.
Operatio ergo in eis est, ut consideres tunc, si est Grando procedens in eo, quod apparet de palpebra, et mouentur ad omnem partem, et res eius est facilis.	The operation for them is therefore to consider then whether it is a Grando proceeding from the eyelid, which appears on the eyelid and moves to every part, and its treatment is easy.
Finde ergo super eam fissura per latitudinem.	So, find the suture above it along the width.
Deinde excoria eam ab omni parte cum facilitate, donec euadat.	Then clear it from every side with ease, until you reach the cavity.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncino, et abscinde ipsam.	Then hang it with a hook, and cut it off.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi abscisio eius, nisi postquam tu penetras palpebram cum incisione parumper, tunc nocet infirmo illud in aliquo.	If, however, the separation of it is not prepared for you, unless after you have pierced the eyelid with a moderate incision, then it will harm the weakened eye in some way.
Quod si fissura est magna: tunc aggrega ipsam cum sutura: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	If the wound is large: then gather it together with a suture: and care for it, until it heals.
Et si est parua, non superueniet tibi malum ex ea.	And if it is small, no harm will come to you from it.
Vnguentum enim restaurat ipsam, et incarnat eam.	For the ointment restores it, and flesh grows over it.
Et si grando est decliuis ad interiora auris uersus superficiem intrinsecam, tunc inuersa palpebram, et suspende grandinem cum uncino: praeter quod indigeas incisione, et preme eam ab omni parte.	And if the perforation leads deep into the interior of the ear towards the inner surface, then invert the eyelid, and hang the perforation with a hook: besides what you need for an incision, and press it from every side.
Quod si elongatur palpebra per incisionem, non nocet illud in aliquo.	If the eyelid is lengthened by an incision, it will not harm it in any way.
Deinde ablue oculum post incisionem grandinis, cum aqua salsa: et cura locum cum eo quod incarnat, donec sanetur infirmus.	Then wash the eye after the incision of the perforation with salty water: and care for the place with what grows flesh, until the weakened eye heals.
Â¶ De cura Axirnath palpebrarum.	On the treatment of eyelids.
Caput X.	Chapter 10.
Axirnath est adeps qui generatur in tunicis palpebrae superioris: et plurimum quidem accidit illud pueris: et ipsum grauat oculos eorum, et accidunt eis catarri in matutinis, et non possunt intueri lumen solis, propterea, quod lachrymae properant ad eos, et propter illud uides eos discumbere super facies suas semper, et super eas dormiunt, et sunt palpebrae eorum sub superciliis humidae, quas iam cooperuit inflatio: et eminentia quidem Axirnath apparens est oculo, et quando tu premis locum cum digitis tuis, sentis Axirnath inter eos.	Axirnath is a thickening that forms on the upper eyelids: and it mostly occurs in children: and it weighs down their eyes, and they have rheum in the mornings, and cannot gaze at the light of the sun, because tears flow to them, and therefore they seem to lean forward over their faces always, and sleep with them, and their eyelids are humid beneath their eyebrows, which have already been affected by inflammation: and the appearance of Axirnath is evident in the eye, and when you press on the place with your fingers, you feel Axirnath between them.
Et modus operationis eius est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the method of operating is that the patient should place his head on your lap.
Deinde accipe pannum lini, et praepara in eo licinia, et fac ex illo licinio circulum secundum quantitatem quod continet Axirnath ab omni parte.	Then take a linen cloth and prepare the ligatures on it, and make from that ligature a circle according to the quantity that the patient's limb contains.
Deinde pone eum super eam, et preme cum digitis tuis ab omni parte, ut aggregetur Axirnath in medio circuli.	Then place it on top of it, and press with your fingers all around, so that the patient's limb is gathered in the middle of the circle.
Deinde finde in medio illius humiditatis cum spatumili incidente fissuras per latitudinem, et non sit fissura maior illa quae fit in phlebotomia in profundo.	Then find in the middle of that humidity a spot with a thin instrument incident to the fissures along the width, and let there not be a larger fissure than what is made in deep phlebotomy.
Aut oportet ut findas cutem totam, donec peruenias ad Axirnath in pluribus enim dispositionibus procedit Axirnath ex fissura secundum formam frusti pinguedinis albae.	Or it is necessary to find the entire skin, until you reach the patient's limb in many different positions, for the patient's limb proceeds from the fissure according to the shape of a fragment of white pungent fat.
Extrahe ergo eam cum panno, quem infiltrasti inter digitos tuos ad exteriora: et tu reuoluis manum tuam ad dextram et sinistram, donec dispergatur: et caue, ne addas in fissura, ut non peruenias cum spatumili ad oculum, et laedas eum.	Therefore extract it with the cloth, which you have infiltrated between your fingers to the exterior; and you turn your hand to the right and left, until it disperses; and beware, lest you touch the fissure, so that you do not reach with a thin instrument to the eye and harm him.
Si autem non appareat tibi Axirnath in principio fissurae, tu addas in fissura parum cum facilitate, donec procedat Axirnath.	If however the patient's limb does not appear to you at the beginning of the fissure, you should add a little to the fissure with ease, until the patient's limb proceeds.
Deinde extrahe eam, sicut diximus.	Then extract it, as we have said.
Deinde submerge pannos in aceto et aqua, et pone eos super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis.	Then soak the cloths in vinegar and water, and place them on the site, and tie it with bandages.
Et ex hominibus sunt qui terunt salem, et ponunt ipsum in concauitate fissurae, ut liquefiat quod remansit ex illa humiditate.	And there are those who rub salt, and put it in the concavity of the fissure, so that what remains from that humidity may liquefy.
Deinde cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then treat it, until it heals.
Si autem accidat in loco apostema calidum, tune cura ipsum cum emplastris sedatiuis, donec sanetur.	If however a hot aposteme occurs at the site, then treat it with cooling plaster, until it heals.
Â¶ De modis Ataxmir oculi, id est, cum palpebra mollificatur oculi, unde fit ut rugetur sicut non debet.	On the methods of Ataxmir of the eye, that is, when the eyelid becomes soft, whence it happens that it becomes rough as it should not.
Caput XI.	Head XI.
Quando nascuntur in palpebris oculi pili additi praeter cursum sub pilis naturalibus, et antiquantur: tunc ipsi nocent oculo, et faciunt accidere modos aegritudinum, sicut lachrymas assiduas, et mollificationem palpebrarum, et albuginem, donec fit illud caussa destructionis oculi.	When hairs grow in the eyelids beyond their natural course under the natural hairs, and become entrenched: then they harm the eye, and cause various ailments to occur, such as constant tears, and softening of the eyelids, and a whiteness, until it becomes the cause of destruction of the eye.
Et Ataxmir quidem oculi curatur secundum quatuor modos.	And Ataxmir indeed cures the eye according to four modes.
Aut per cauterium cum igne.	Or with cautery by fire.
Aut cum medicina acuta, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo cauterii.	Or with acute medicine, according to what has been mentioned in the chapter on cautery.
Aut curatur Ataxmir per incisionem et suturam.	Or Ataxmir cures by incision and suture.
Aut per cannas, secundum quod ego dicam.	Or with tubes, according to what I will say.
Oportet ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	It is necessary that you put the head of the patient on your lap.
Deinde conuerte palpebram oculi manu tua sinistra.	Then convert the eyelid of the eye with your left hand.
Si ergo conuertitur, bonum est.	If it is thus converted, it is good.
Et si non: intromitte acum in eam, in qua sit filum ab inferiori parte palpebrae, et fac penetrare acum cum filo desuper, et sit illud prope pilos ipsos, id est, prope marginem palpebrae, in quo nascuntur pili: et trahe filum ad superiora cum palpebra, et conuerte eam cum radio.	And if not: introduce a needle into it, where there is a thread from the lower part of the eyelid, and make the needle penetrate with the thread above, and let it be near the hairs themselves, that is, near the edge of the eyelid, where the hairs grow: and draw the thread upwards with the eyelid, and convert it with a straight line.
Deinde finde in interiori parte palpebrae sub pilis additis cum spatumili incidente a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus.	Then find on the inner part of the eyelid beneath the added hairs with a spatula incident from the larger lacrimal to the smaller lacrimal.
Deinde extrahe filum, et pone sub palpebra puluillum paruum ex cotto, aut panno: deinde signa super palpebram cum encaustro, quod sit sicut figura folii myrti.	Then extract the thread, and place under the eyelid a small poultice made of cotton or cloth: then mark on the eyelid with ink, which should be like the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Verumtamen oportet, ut fit figura secundum quantitatem et eleuationem palpebrae: quoniam iam diuersificatur illud in hominibus.	However, it is necessary that the figure be according to the size and elevation of the eyelid: because already it varies among men.
Ex eis enim est, qui indiget ut incidatur ex palpebra quantitas magna, secundum quantitatem quae mollificatur a palpebra.	For there are some who need to have a large quantity of eyelid incised, according to the quantity that is softened by the eyelid.
Deinde cum spatumili finde super duas lineas quas signasti, et incipe a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus, et sit fissura una prope pilos naturales, sicut est grossitudo radii.	Then, when you find the spatula above two lines that you have marked, and cut along the larger lacrimal duct up to the smaller one, and let there be a single fissure near the natural eyelashes, just as is the thickness of the radius.
Deinde intromitte uncinum in uno duorum angulorum cutis.	Then introduce a hook into one of the two angular skin flaps.
Deinde excoria ipsam totam.	Then scrape out the whole thing.
Deinde aggrega cum sutura duo labia, cum acu et filo lana subtili: et absterge sanguinem, et fac adhaerere quod superfluit ex filis super duo supercilia, cum quibusdam rebus inuiscantibus, si uis facere illud: et si non, non cures.	Then bring together the two lips with a suture, using a needle and fine linen thread; and stop the bleeding, and make adhere what is superfluous from the threads above the eyebrows, with certain things that constrict, if you want to do it: and if not, don't worry.
Deinde dimitte suturam et fila usque ad tres dies, aut quatuor: postea cura illud.	Then leave the suture and threads in place until three days, or four: afterwards attend to it.
Et si uis, dimitte uulnus absque sutura, et cura ipsum cum eo, quod exsiccat et constringit.	And if you wish, leave the wound without a suture, and attend to it with that which dries and constricts.
Nam palpebra eleuatur apud sigillationem uulneris et aggregationem eius: sed futura est melior.	For the eyelid is elevated at the sealing of the wound and its aggregation: but the future one will be better.
Hunc modum curandi Ataxmir docuerunt antiqui.	This method of healing was taught by the ancient Ataxmir.
Verumtamen in eo est sollicitudo super infirmum, et est ex bona operatione, et non est in eo timor.	However, there is solicitude over the weak, and it is from good operation, and there is no fear in it.
Et modus alius est in Ataxmir etiam: et est, ut signes super palpebram figuram, quae sit sicut figura folii myrti, sicut narrauimus.	And another method is also in Ataxmir: and it is, as you mark on the eyelid a shape, which should be like the shape of a myrtle leaf, as we have narrated.
Deinde eleua palpebram cum tribus uncinis separatis, aut aggregatis, secundum formam hanc quae sequitur, deinde incide quod superfluit cum forficibus paruis, secundum hanc formam, cum aequalitate incisionis.	Then elevate the eyelid with three separate hooks, or aggregated, according to this shape that follows, then cut away what is superfluous with small forceps, according to this shape, with equality of incision.
Si autem non est tibi possibile tenere uncinum, et non aequatur illud: tunc accipe acum in qua sit filum, et intromitte ipsum in medio figurae: et intromitte filum aliud prope lachrymale maius, et filum secundum prope lachrymale minus: et aggrega inter digitos tuos fila cum aequalitate.	If however it is not possible for you to hold the hook, and it does not equal that: then take a needle in which there is a thread, and insert it in the middle of the shape: and insert one thread near the larger lacrimal duct, and the second thread near the smaller lacrimal duct: and tie together the threads between your fingers with equality.
Deinde eleua manum tuam eleuatione aequali: et eleua cutem super quam est signatum cotum, sicut narrauimus.	Then elevate your hand in elevation equal to it: and elevate the skin above that which is marked with a scar, as we have narrated.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then bring together the two lips of the wound with a suture: and take care of it, until it heals.
Si uero accidat apostema apud incisionem tuam, aut fissuram tuam: seda illud apostema cum caeroto, et his similibus, ex unguentis sedantibus.	If an abscess occurs at your incision, or your fissure: but that abscess with a poultice, and things similar to it, from soothing ointments.
Et quandoque accidit palpebrae etiam, ut conuertantur pili eius.	And when it happens to the eyelids also, so that their hairs may converge.
Oportet ergo ut utaris in ea quod diximus in incisione: sed sutura utrisque magis est artificialis.	It is necessary therefore that you use what we have said about the incision: but a suture on both parts is more artificial.
Â¶ De cura Ataxmir cum cannis.	On the treatment of Ataxmir with canes (or "with a scalpel").
ET Est, ut conuertas palpebram, et scindas fissuram quae est deintus, secundum quod narraui.	And it is, that you should convert the eyelid, and dissect the fissure which is within, according to what I have narrated.
Deinde arte fac duas cannas, aut duo ligna subtilia: quarum longitudo sit secundum longitudinem palpebrae, et latitudo earum sit minor latitudine spatumilis: et tu iam incidisti in extremitatibus utriusque ab utrisque partibus ubi tenes fila.	Then skillfully make two scalpels, or two subtle rods: whose length is according to the length of the eyelid, and their width is less than the width of a spatula: and you have already incised at the extremities on both sides where you hold the threads.
Deinde aggrega utramque cum subtilitate super illud quod superfluit ex palpebra oculi, et stringe duas cannas ab utrisque partibus strictura forti, et dimitte eam diebus aliquot.	Then bring together both with subtlety above that which surpasses from the eyelid of the eye, and bind the two scalpels from both sides with a strong stricture, and leave it for some days.
Cutis enim stricta morietur, et denigrabitur, et putrefiet, donec cadet per se.	For the skin will be tightly mortified, and blacken, and putrefy, until it falls off by itself.
Si ergo tardatur, tunc incide eam cum forficibus.	If it is delayed, then cut into it with forceps.
Deinde cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then treat it, until it heals.
Cum ergo consolidatur, eleuatur palpebra: et non pungunt pili.	When it is consolidated, the eyelid is elevated: and the hairs do not prickle.
Et haec est forma duarum cannarum, quas facies secundum hanc figuram, et quantitatem in longitudinem et latitudinem.	And this is the shape of the two scalpels, which you make according to this figure, and quantity in length and width.
Â¶ De eleuatione pilorum pungentium in oculo cum acu.	On the elevation of pricking hairs in the eye with a needle.
Caput XII.	Head 12.
Operatio in illo est, ut accipias acum subtilem, et intromittas in eam filum ex serico subtile, lene.	The operation is to receive a subtle needle, and to insert into it a thread from fine silk, thin.
Deinde aggreges extremitates eius, et nodes utramque nodo subtili ualde: et sit longitudo filorum palmus unus.	Then you gather the extremities of it, and tie both knots with a subtle knot strongly; and let the length of the threads be one palm.
Deinde compone in Alinxotati filum aliud subtile sub eo in breui, et noda extremitates eius si uis.	Then you put another subtle thread under it in a short space, and tie its extremities if you wish.
Deinde ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo, et sit prope solem ut declaretur operatio: quoniam est operatio subtilis, uel minuta.	Then the patient should place his head on your lap, and it should be near a window so that the operation may be illuminated; for it is a subtle operation, or minute.
Deinde intromitte acum cum alinxotati in radicem palpebrae, et fac eam penetrare in palpebram festinanter, donec extrahas eam desuper pilum naturalem.	Then insert the needle with the thread into the root of the eyelash, and make it penetrate the eyelid firmly, until you extract it above the natural hair.
Deinde trahe pilum usque supra alinxotati: et intromitte in alinxotati illum pilum: si est unus, aut duo, aut tres, non plures.	Then pull out the hair up to the thread: and insert into the thread that hair: if it is one, or two, or three, no more.
Deinde trahe manum tuam cum eo, donec egrediatur pilus cum alinxotati in palpebra cum pilo naturali.	Then pull your hand with it, until the hair emerges with the thread in the eyelid with the natural hair.
Si autem trahatur alinxotati, et non egrediatur pilus cum ea: trahes alinxotati ad inferiora, cum filo quod tu composuisti in ea, donec egrediatur alinxotati ex foramine superiori, et uideas eam uisione oculi: tunc enim trahes alinxotati, et filum: et extrahe utraque, et claude oculum: et dimitte ipsum clausum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec adhaereat pilus loco suo, et nascatur super ipsum caro.	But if the thread is pulled and the hair does not emerge with it: pull the thread downwards, with the filament that you composed in it, until the thread emerges from the superior orifice, and you see it with the vision of the eye: then indeed pull the thread, and the filament: and extract both, and close the eye: and keep it closed for two days, or three, until the hair adheres to its place, and grows above it as flesh.
Quod si pilus est breuis, tunc aut associa ei pilum longum ex pilis naturalibus, et eleuatur cum eo: aut dimitte ipsum, donec elongetur post spacium, et tunc eleua ipsum.	If the hair is short, then either associate a long hair to it from the natural hairs, and elevate with it: or leave it, until it elongates after a space, and then elevate it.
Â¶ De cura Alxatrati quae accidit in palpebra superiori.	On the treatment of a foreign body that happens in the upper eyelid.
Caput XIII.	Head 13.
Quando accidit oculo haec Alxatrati, nominatur Leporina.	When this happens to the eye, it is called a cataract.
Et haec Alxatrati est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	And this cataract is either natural or accidental.
Accidentalis ergo fit ex consolidatione uulneris, aut sectionis, aut cauterii, et similium illis.	The accidental one occurs from the consolidation of a wound, or a incision, or a burn, and similar things.
Et modus operationis in ea est, ut tu findas illam consolidationem, et ut separes labia eius, et ponas in eo quod est inter ea licinium ex lino, et liges eam, donec sanetur.	And the method of operating on it is to make a consolidation, and to separate its lips, and to put between them a thread made of linen, and to tie it, until it heals.
Et non oportet, ut utaris in curatione eius rebus quae exiccant et constringunt: nam si tu facis illud, redit Alxatrati deterior quam fuit: imo utere in ea rebus quae mollificant, sicut foenumgraecum: et embroca cum aqua, in qua cocta sit althea, semen lini: et unguento dyaquilon, quod liquefactum sit cum aliquo ex oleis: et inuolue cum eo licinium, et cura cum eo.	And it is not suitable to use things that dry and constrict in its treatment, for if you do that, the cataract will return worse than it was. Instead, use things that soften, such as fenugreek; and anoint with water in which a little of the decoction of linseed has been mixed, and smear with a dissolving unguent, which has been liquefied with some oil; and envelop with a thread, and take care with it.
Et thesaurus curationis tuae est, ut coneris omni ingenio, ut non consolidetur, secundum formam quae fuit in primis.	And the treasure of your treatment is that you strive with all ingenuity, so that it does not consolidate, according to the form it had at first.
Et haec quidem operatio quam diximus, non est nisi quaedam rectificatio Alxatrati, ut non redeat forma loci secundum quod fuit omnino.	And this operation which we have described is not anything but a certain rectification of the cataract, so that the place does not return to its original form.
Â¶ De cura Alxatrati quae fit in palpebra inferiori, et est rugatio uel contractio sursum ad dextrum et sinistrum.	Concerning the treatment of cataract that occurs in the lower eyelid, and is a wrinkling or contraction upwards to the right and left.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter 13.
Haec Alxatrati quae fit inferius, est quae uere nominatur Alxatrati.	This cataract that occurs below is truly called a cataract.
Et est naturalis, et est accidentalis.	And it is natural, and it is accidental.
Et accidentalis fit ex uulnere, aut fissura, aut cauterio, et illis similibus.	And the accidental one occurs from a wound, or a crack, or a burn, and similar things.
Et uia operationis in ea est, ut accipias acum, in qua sit filum duplum, et tingas eam in carnem, et facias eam penetrare a lachrymali sinistro usque ad lachrymale dextrum, donec perueniat filum in duabus extremitatibus carnis.	And the method of operating on it is to take a needle, in which there is a double thread, and you pierce the flesh, and make it penetrate from the left tear duct to the right tear duct, until the thread passes through both extremities of the flesh.
Deinde extende carnem ad superiora cum acu, et incide eam cum spatumili lato.	Then stretch the flesh upwards with a hook, and make an incision with a broad spatula.
Si ergo redit figura palpebrae secundum quod oportet, est bonum.	If then the shape of the eyelid returns according to what is fitting, it is good.
Et si non, accipe radium, et pone ipsum in fissuram, et conuerte cum eo palpebram: et finde duas fissuras in latere interiore palpebrae, et sint extremitates duarum fissurarum ex duobus angulis incisionis, donec concurrant et fiat ex eis angulus: donec quando aggregantur fiat figura earum haec figura, et est litera lauda graeca.	And if not, take a rod, and place it in the fissure, and convert the eyelid with it: and find two fissures on the inner side of the eyelid, and let the extremities of the two fissures be from two angles of the incision, until they converge and form an angle: until when they combine, this shape will be formed, and it is a praiseworthy Greek letter.
Deinde aufer illam carnem per quantitatem, quod est latus eius acutum inferius, ab eo quod sequitur palpebram.	Then remove that flesh according to its quantity, which is the sharp point below, from what follows the eyelid.
Deinde aggrega partes separatas: sue eam cum filo lanae.	Then gather the separated parts together: sew them with a thread of wool.
Deinde cura eas cum eo quod diximus, de medicinis mollificantibus, et liciniis, donec sanentur.	Then treat them with what we have said, with softening medications and bandages, until they heal.
Et si Alxatrati accidat ex fissura, et sutura, aut cauterio: tunc oportet ut findas fissura plana sub pilis palpebrarum, etiam secundum quod praecessit.	And if a cicatrix forms from the fissure and suture, or cautery: then it is necessary to find a flat fissure under the hairs of the eyelids, also according to what has preceded.
Deinde separa inter duo labia cum licinio, secundum quod diximus.	Then separate between the two lips with a bandage, according to what we have said.
Et summa sermonis de cura Alxatrati, quando est desuper, aut inferius, est, ut currat in ea operatio, secundum quod praeparatur ex forma Alxatrati.	And the summary of the discourse on the treatment of cicatrix, when it is above or below, is that it runs into that operation, according to what is prepared from the form of the cicatrix.
Ipsa namque est multarum diuersitatum in forma: et artifex prudens praeparat ingenium cum quocunque modo est possibile ei, donec redire faciat figuram ad formam naturalem, aut prope eam, et ipsemet infirmus, secundum quod conuenit ei ex operatione et instrumentis in plurimis dispositionibus.	For it is itself many diversities in form: and the skilled craftsman prepares his ingenuity with whatever mode is possible for him, until he makes the figure return to its natural form, or near to it, and the same infirm person, according to what is convenient for him from the operation and instruments in many dispositions.
Â¶ De adhaerentia palpebrae oculi cum coniunctiua, aut cornea.	Concerning the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or cornea.
Caput XV.	Chapter 15.
Quandoque accidit haec consolidatio multis hominibus, ita ut consolidetur palpebra superior cum albedine oculi, et prohibeat ipsum ab operationibus suis naturalibus.	When this consolidation occurs in many people, so that the upper eyelid is consolidated with the whiteness of the eye, and prevents it from its natural operations.
Oportet ergo quod intromittas extremitatem radii sub palpebra, et eleues eam sursum: aut extendas eam cum uncino: deinde incide adhaerentiam cum spatumili subtili, quod non sit cum acuitate incisionis spatumilium, imo sit obtusum parumper: ut non inquietetur infirmus apud operationem, et remoueatur spatumile, et laedat oculum cum acuitate sua: et sit incisio tua quasi tu excories illam adhaerentiam cum facilitate, donec quando redit palpebra secundum formam suam naturalem, et sanetur adhaerentia tota.	Therefore, you should introduce the extremity of the radius under the eyelid, and elevate it upwards: or extend it with a hook: then make an incision with a subtle spatula, which is not sharp, but rather obtuse; so that the patient does not become anxious during the operation, and the spatula is removed, and the eye is annoyed with its acuity: and let your incision be as if you are excavating that adhesion with ease, until when the eyelid returns to its natural form, and the entire adhesion is healed.
Funde tunc in oculum aquam salsam, cum aqua ablue ipsum: aut distilla in ipsum ex sief facto, ex ziniar dissoluto cum aqua.	Then pour salty water into the eye, with water washing it: or distill into it a decoction made from zinc, dissolved in water.
Deinde separa inter palpebram et oculum cum licinio lini: et pone super oculum lanam infusam cum albugine oui: et post diem tertium utere sief, et cum solidatiuis, donec sanetur.	Then separate the eyelid from the eye with a linen thread: and place on the eye a woolen cloth soaked in egg white: and after three days use a decoction, and with solidifying remedies, until it is healed.
Â¶ De incisione ungulae et eminentiae carnis lachrymarum.	On the Incision of the Nail-like Projection and the Prominence of the Tear-producing Flesh.
Caput XVI.	Chapter 16.
Scias, quod ungula est secundum duos modos.	You should know that the nail-like projection is according to two methods.
Aut est neruosa: et est similis sifac duro, subtili.	Or it is nerve-like: and it is similar to a hard, subtle callus.
Aut est non neruosa, similis humiditati congelatae albae: quae quando tangit cam ferrum, aut conaris capere eam cum uncino, abscinditur, et non figitur in ea uncinus.	Or it is not nerve-like, similar to a hardened white humidity: which when touched with iron, or attempted to be grasped with a hook, breaks off, and the hook does not stick into it.
Et utraeque species non incipiunt, nisi a lachrymali maiore, usquequo uadit paulatim, donec cooperit uisum, et prohibet lumen, et motum oculi.	And both species do not begin unless from the greater tear duct, until it grows gradually, until it covers the sight, and prevents the motion of the eye.
Et modus operandi in incisione eius est: ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the method of operating on its incision is: that the patient should place his head in your lap.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et eleua palpebram manu tua.	Then open its eyes and lift the eyelid with your hand.
Deinde collige ungulam cum uncino paucae duplationis, et extende eam ad superiora.	Then collect the nail with a pair of forceps of little duplication, and extend it to the upper parts.
Deinde accipe acum, et intromitte in eam pilum ex pilis equi, et bouis, aut uaccae: et sit filum forte, et duplica extremitatem acus parumper, et fige eam in medio ungulae: et penetra eam cum acu, et liga cum filo ungulam, et extende eam ad superiora: et excoria cum pilo latus ungulae quod sequitur pupillam, ac si tu serres eam cum pilo usque ad postreimnum eius.	Then take a needle, and insert into it a horsehair or ox hair, or of a goat: and let the thread be strong, and double the end of the needle for a short while, and fix it in the middle of the nail: and penetrate it with the needle, and tie with the thread the nail, and extend it to the upper parts: and scrape with the needle the side of the nail that follows the pupil, as if you would serrate it with the needle up to its posterior.
Deinde incide residuum in radice lachrymalis cum spatumili subtili, aut cum forficibus paruis: et dimitte carnem lachrymalis naturalem, ut non accidat ex incisione eius cursus lachrymarum assiduus.	Then cut the remainder at the root of the tear duct with a subtle spatula, or with small forceps: and leave the natural flesh of the tear duct, so that it does not happen from the incision that the flow of tears is continuous.
Et quandoque extenditur ungula cum uncino solo: aut cum filo, sicut diximus.	And when the nail is extended with a single forceps: or with a thread, as we have said.
Deinde excoriatur cum spatumili leni, cuius haec est forma.	Then it is scraped with a gentle spatula, which has this shape.
Et caue, ne tangat spatumile tunicam corneam, et accidat in ea ruptura, et perforetur pupilla.	And beware, lest the spatula touches the corneal tunic, and a rupture occurs in it, and the pupil is perforated.
Deinde post incisionem, proice in oculum aliquid salis contriti, aut ex sief facto ex ziniar, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then after the incision, introduce into the eye something salty and ground, or made from zinc, and leave it until another day.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur.	Then treat it with what is necessary until it is healed.
Quod si ungula est non neruosa, et non potes intromittere in eam acum, neque figitur in ea uncinus, tunc multotiens curatur haec species ungulae cum medicinis, et sanatur sicut narraui in diuisione.	What if the nail is not nervy, and you cannot insert a needle into it, nor is it fastened with a hook, then this type of nail is often treated with medicines, and healed as I described in the division.
Quod si uis incidere eam, tunc aperi oculum infirmi, et accipe spatumile subtile, lene, debilis acuitatis, secundum hanc formam.	What if you wish to incise it, then open the eye of the sick person, and take a subtle, gentle, weak, and precise spatula, according to this shape.
Et rade ungulam desuper rasione cum subtilitate.	And scrape the nail down from above with subtlety.
Quod si uides quod ipsa rarificatur et confringitur, et imprimit in eam rasio, tunc distilla ex hora tua in oculum ex sief facto ex ziniar, aut ex sief rubeo, aut sale trito: et opila oculum usque ad diem alium.	If you see that it is rarified and confringed, and an impression is made on it by the rasp, then distill it from hour to hour in the eye, whether it be from a fact of sinew or from a fact of redness or from trite salt: and apply an ointment to the eye until another day.
Deinde itera super ipsam operationem, donec remoueatur totum eius.	Then repeat the operation over it, until all of it is removed.
Nisi contrarium sit tibi in oculo apostema calidum: tunc enim dimitte ipsam, et cura apostema, donec sanetur.	Unless there is a warm aposteme in your eye: then indeed leave it, and treat the aposteme, until it heals.
Deinde itera operationem super ipsam cum rasione, donec sanetur.	Then repeat the operation over it with the rasp, until it heals.
Eminentia autem carnis lachrymalis, si nocet in oculo nocumento magno, suspendatur cum uncino, et incide ex ea partem eius: et non ultimes incisionem, ut non accidat cursus lachrymarum.	However, the prominence of the tear-producing flesh, if it causes great harm in the eye, should be suspended with a hook, and an incision should be made from that part of it: and not the last incision, so that the flow of tears does not occur.
Deinde stilla in lachrymale sief rubeum, aut factum ex ziniari, donec sanetur.	Then apply a collyrium to the tear-producing [area] with redness from sinew, or made from zinc, until it heals.
Â¶ De incisione Alguardenic, et carne nata in oculo.	On the incision of Alguardenic, and flesh born in the eye.
Caput XVII.	Chapter 17.
Nascitur quandoque in quibusdam oculis hominum caro rubea composita, uel superposita, donec cooperit pupillam, aut appropinquat, aut stringit super palpebras, et fortasse conuertit palpebras ad exteriora: et assimilatur rosae balaustinae.	There is born sometimes in certain eyes of men a red flesh, composed or superimposed, until it covers the pupil, or approaches, or presses on the eyelids, and perhaps turns the eyelids outward: and it resembles a rose-like pustule.
Et operatio in ea etiam est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the operation for this is also to place the weak head on your lap.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et collige illam carnem totam cum uncinis conuenientibus ad illud: et tene illud cum forcipe uno, aut gesti.	Then open its eyes, and gather all that flesh with suitable hooks for that: and hold it with one forceps, or carry it.
Deinde incide carnem in primis, donec finiatur totum eius cum incisorio.	Then cut the flesh first, until everything of it is finished with an incision.
Et caue ab oculo, ut non laedas ipsum apud operationem: et sit incisio tua qua ipsam incidis, aut cum spatumili, quod narrauimus in incisione ungulae: aut cum forficibus paruis, cum quibus colligitur asebel, secundum quod ueniet forma eius post hoc capitulum.	And be careful not to harm the eye itself during the operation: and let your incision be such that you cut with it, or with a spatula, which we described in the incision of the nail: or with small forceps, with which you collect the pus, according to what will be its form after this chapter.
Cum ergo completur incisio tua, et remouetur tota alguardenici, tunc imple oculum ex sale contrito: aut distilla in eum puluerem rubeum, et similia illi ex medicinis corrosiuis: et pone super oculum deforis cottum cum albugine oui: ut securetur ab apostemate calido.	When your incision is complete and the entire gum is removed, then fill the eye with a powder made from rubbed crocus, or distill into it a reddish powder, and apply similar remedies that are corrosive medicines. And put over the eye a linen cloth soaked in albumen water, so that it may be secured from a hot aposteme.
Quod si remanet ex alguardenici aliquid, et dominatur tibi sanguis calidus, et times apostema calidum: tunc dimitte oculum, et cura ipsum cum eo quod sedat apostema.	If something remains from the gum and hot blood dominates you, and a hot aposteme threatens: then leave the eye alone and treat it with what soothes the aposteme.
Deinde itera super ipsum cum operatione, donec sanetur.	Then repeat over it with the treatment, until it is healed.
Et similiter fac cum carne addita quae accidit in oculo ex hac specie.	And do similarly with the flesh that is added to the eye from this kind.
Verumtamen oportet, ut alienes curationem omnis oculi debilis ex uia naturali, aut ex uia accidentali, operando cum ferro: et non intromittas manum tuam in aliqua harum operationum, donec uideas, quod illud membrum est tolerans illam operationem.	However, it is necessary that you avoid weakening the entire eye by natural or accidental causes, while operating with iron; and do not introduce your hand into any of these operations until you are aware that the member is tolerant of that operation.
Â¶ De collectione Sebel ex oculo.	On collecting discharge from the eye.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter 18.
Sebel sunt uenae rubeae quae texuntur super oculum, et prohibent uisui operationem suam: et debilitant oculum cum longitudine dierum.	Discharges are reddish veins that gather above the eye and hinder its natural function; and they weaken the eye over time.
Necesse est ergo tibi in primis, ut consideres, si oculus in quo est Sebel, est fortis, et non est in eo aegritudo aliqua, praeter Sebel: tunc collige Sebel eius.	It is necessary for you to consider first if the eye in which there is discharge is strong and has no other disease besides the discharge; then collect its discharge.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo.	And it is that you should lean on a weak person so that he may put his head on your lap.
Deinde suspende illas uenas cum uncino uno, aut duobus secundum prudentiam tuam: et sit uncinus subtilis duplationis, secundum hanc formam, aut sint duo uncini gradat in corpore uno, secundum hanc formam.	Then suspend those veins with one hook or two, according to your prudence: and let the hook be a subtle duplication, according to this form, or let there be two hooks graduated in one body, according to this form.
Deinde collige cum forficibus subtilibus illas uenas cum subtilitate, et absterge sanguinem hora post horam, donec uideas illas uenas remoueri ex oculo, et resoluuntur: et caue ne laedas oculum cum extremitatibus spatumilis.	Then collect those veins with subtle forceps, and absorb the blood hour after hour, until you see those veins removed from the eye, and are resolved; and beware not to harm the eye with rough extractions.
Et sit operatio tua in meridie coram sole, et sis firmus in operatione tua ualde: ut non incidas nisi illas uenas.	And let your operation be at midday in the presence of the sun, and you should be firm in your operation, so that you do not cut unless it is those veins.
Et cum tu expleueris, tunc distilla in oculum sief uiride, aut rubeum: ut sua acuitate corrodat quod remansit ex sebel.	And when you have made an incision, then distill into the eye a green or red liquid: so that its sharpness may corrode what remains from the putridity.
Si autem non est tibi possibile colligere illud totum in illa hora, tunc emplastra oculum cum eo, quod sedat dolorem oculi: et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur dolor eius: et securetur ab apostemate calido: deinde itera super ipsum secundum modum eundem, donec sanetur.	If however it is not possible for you to collect all that at that hour, then apply a plaster to the eye with what soothes the pain of the eye: and leave it for several days, until the pain is soothed: and protect it from a warm apostema: then repeat the same process again, until it is healed.
Et haec est forma forficis.	And this is the form of a scalpel.
Â¶ De reductione Arissati ad nasum.	On the Reduction of a Fracture to the Nose.
Caput XIX.	Chapter 19.
Nominant medici Arissati Fistulam, quam curas cum cauterio, aut cum medicina acuta comburente, secundum quod praecessit eius narratio.	The physician calls a fracture of the nose a fistula, which is treated with cauterization or with acute burning medicine, according to what has been previously mentioned in his account.
Et si non sanatur, tunc non est ingenium in ea: nisi ut findas super apostema apud natiuitatem eius, et extrahas totam humiditatem quae est in eo et pus, donec detegatur os.	And if it does not heal, then there is no ingenuity in that: unless you make a furtive attempt above the apostema at its birthplace, and extract all the moisture which is in it and the pus, until the bone is uncovered.
Cum ergo detegitur os, et uides in eo corruptionem, aut nigredinem, tunc rade ipsum cum instrumento, cuius forma est haec.	When therefore the bone is uncovered, and you see in it corruption or blackness, then scrape it with an instrument whose form is this.
Et nominatur Asperi capitis.	And it is called a rasp of the head.
Fiat ex ferro indo, et sit caput eius rotundum sicut azir, quod sit punctatum punctatione limae, aut punctatione aliskilferi punctatione subtili: et pone ipsum super locum corruptum ossis.	Let it be made from iron, and let its head be round like a file, which is pointed with the point of a lime or the subtle point of an alembroth: and place it on the corrupted spot of the bone.
Deinde reuolue ipsum inter digitos tuos, et tu preme manum tuam parumper, donec scias quod illa corruptio iam rasa est: et fac illud aliquotiens.	Then turn it around between your fingers, and press your hand firmly for a while, until you know that the corruption has been scraped away: and do this several times.
Deinde restaura locum cum medicinis exiccatiuis stipticis.	Then restore the place with medicines which are drying and styptic.
Si ergo consolidatur locus, et nascitur in eo caro, et abscinditur cursus saniei: et remanet quadraginta diebus, et non renouatur, et non apostematur, et non accidit in eo accidens: tunc scias quia iam sanatus est.	If therefore the place is consolidated, and flesh grows in it, and the flow of sanies is cut off: and it remains for forty days, and does not become inflamed, and does not suppurate, and no accident occurs in it: then know that it has already healed.
Et si non, tunc non est in eo ingenium, nisi reducere fistulam ad foramen nasi, secundum hanc formam.	And if not, then there is no ingenuity in it, unless you reduce the fistula to the nostril opening, according to this method.
Et est, ut detegas ab osse secundo cum ferro, aut cum medicina acuta: et cum detectum est os, tunc accipe terebrum secundum hanc formam, sit extremitas ferrea, triangulata: et lignum eius sit pyramis extenuata usque ad extremitatem, sicut uides.	And it is, that you detach from the bone with a file or with an acute medicine: and when the bone is detached, then take the trephine according to this method, let it be iron, triangular: and its wood should be a pyramid extended to the extremity, as you see.
Deinde pone illud super os ipsum: et sit illud prope lachrymale: et elonga manum tuam ab oculo parum.	Then place that on the bone itself: and let it be near the tear duct: and stretch out your hand a little from the eye.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum terebro, donec penetret os, et sentiat illud infirmus: per hoc quod inuenit uentum exire ex eo, quando tenet manum suam super nasum suum.	Then turn your hand with the trephine until it penetrates the bone, and feels that it is weak: through this, because it finds a way to exit from it, when it holds its hand over its nose.
Ergo tunc restaura locum cum medicinis stipticis exiccantibus, sicut docui te.	Therefore then restore the place with styptic medicines that dry, as I have instructed you.
Cum ergo nascitur caro, et induratur locus: tunc materia quae effundebatur ad exteriora, redit ad nasum: est ergo leuius illud super infirmum.	When therefore flesh grows, and the place hardens: then the matter that was poured out to the exterior returns to the nose: it is therefore lighter on the weak part.
Â¶ De reductione eminentiae Oculi.	Of the Reduction of the Prominence of the Eye.
Caput XX.	Chapter 20.
Quando eminet Oculus cum totalitate sua, et non accidit in uisu nocumentum, neque diminutio: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum: deinde phlebotomes eum: postea ponas uentosas in ceruice absque scarificatione, sed cum suctione.	When the eye bulges out with its entirety, and no harm occurs in the vision, nor diminution: then it is necessary to soothe the weak part: then phlebotomize it: afterwards apply cupping glasses on the neck without scarifying, but with suction.
Deinde pone super Oculum linimentum quod fit ex acacia, et aloe, et olibano, et sarcocolla.	Then put on the eye an ointment that is made from acacia, and aloe, and balsam, and sarcocolle.
Deinde stringe Oculum desuper super emplastrum cum puluillis multis.	Then bind the eye above with a plaster containing many powders.
Et modus puluillorum est: ut accipias pannos lenes, multos, et duplicetur omnis pannus ex eis super quatuor: fac ex eis multos: deinde pone eos unum super alium, secundum quantitatem qua indiget Oculus: deinde stringe super ipsos cum panno duro strictura forti.	And the method of applying poultices is: to take many soft cloths, and to double each cloth over the four; then make many from them; afterwards place one on top of another according to the quantity that the eye requires; then bind them together with a hard bandage, strongly fastened.
Et itera uentosas cum suctione sine scarificatione.	And apply wet poultices with suction without scratching.
Deinde aufer uentosas, et dimitte oculum strictum die et nocte.	Then remove the wet poultices and loosen the eye during the day and night.
Si autem ligamentum iterum mollificatur, tunc oportet ut stringatur multum: deinde aufer ligamentum post diem et noctem, sicut diximus.	If, however, the ligament is again softened, then it is necessary to bind it strongly; afterwards remove the ligament after a day and night, as we have said.
Si ergo uides oculum iam redisse uuae tunicae, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam, et uentosas, donec sanetur.	If, therefore, you see that the eye has now returned to its own tunics, it is good; and if not, then apply again the plaster, and poultices, and bandages, and wet applications, until it is healed.
Â¶ De incisionie Vuae tunicae.	Concerning the Incision of the Eye's Tunics.
Caput XXI.	Chapter 21.
Quando accidit disruptio in tunica Vuea, deinde eminet et procedit extra palpebras sicut granum Vuae, et foedatur forma hominis propter illud, et uis incidere illud: tunc operatio in eo est, secundum quod narro: et est, ut intromittas acum in radice Vuae ab inferiori ad superiorem partem.	When a disruption occurs in the eye's tunics, then it bulges out and proceeds beyond the eyelids like an eyeball, and its shape is disfigured because of that, and vision is obstructed by it: then the operation for it is, according to what I will describe: and it is, that you should insert a needle in the root of the eye from the lower to the upper part.
Deinde intromitte acum aliam in qua sit filum duplum a parte lachrymalis, et fac eam penetrare: et dimitte acum primam secundum dispositionem suam.	Then insert another needle where there is a double thread on the lacrimal side, and make it penetrate; and withdraw the first needle according to its own arrangement.
Deinde incide locum fili dupli, et liga cum eo partem Vuae in circumitu acus: et stringe eam multum.	Then cut the place of the double thread, and tie it with the eye's circumference like a circle; and bind it strongly.
Deinde extrahe acum, et pone super oculum lanam infusam in albugine oui: et dimitte eum, donec cadat filum cum Vua.	Then extract the needle, and place on the eye a woolen cloth soaked in albumen of egg; and leave it, until the thread falls with the eye.
Deinde cura oculum cum eo, quod confortat ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then treat the eye with what comforts it, until the wound is healed.
Et quandoque stringitur Vua ab omni parte cum circulo ex panno, donec addat oculus eminentiam magnam.	And when a bandage is wrapped around the entire circumference with a circle of cloth, until it adds great prominence to the eye.
Deinde perforetur cum spatumili subtili, quod perueniat ad profundum oculi, et currat humiditas albuginea, et descendat oculus, et ingrediatur statim: deinde stringe eum, donec sanetur.	Then it should be pierced with a subtle spatula, which reaches to the depth of the eye, and the albucid discharge flows out, and the eye subsides, and enters at once; then bind it, until it is healed.
Â¶ De curatione Alcomnati.	On the treatment of cataracts.
Caput XXII.	Chapter 22.
Haec Aegritudo quae nominatur Alcomnati, non, est nisi sanies, quae aggregatur in oculo, similis aquae descendenti, et non est ipsa.	This disease which is called Alcomnati is not, however, a real tumor, but rather a turbid fluid that accumulates in the eye, similar to descending water, and it is not itself.
Et modus operandi in ea est, ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem praeparatum, uel directum.	And the method of operating on it is to make the weakened part sit upon a prepared or directed seat.
Deinde accipe caput eius manibus tuis a partibus duabus, et moue ipsum, donec uideas saniem peruenire ad inferiora oculis tuis.	Then take his head with your hands on both sides, and move it until you see the turbid fluid reach the lower parts of your eyes.
Deinde figatur, et non descendat, et absoluatur lumen: et uideat infirmus res sicut uidebat: et si non descendit inferius, scias quia est aqua.	Then it is figured, and does not flow down, and the light is freed: and you will see that the weakened part is as it was seen: and if it does not flow downwards, know that it is water.
Si autem non praeparatur descensus saniei cum eo quod diximus, tunc fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas.	But if the descent of the turbid fluid is not prepared with what we have said, then make the weakened part sit between your hands.
Deinde accipe spatumile subtile, et finde cum eo supra panniculum corneum parumper apud continuationem coniunctiuae cum tunica cornea in corona, donec egrediatur sanies.	Then take a subtle spatula, and find with it the supracorneal panniculus at the point of continuation with the corneal tunic in the crown, until the turbid fluid goes out.
Cum ergo egreditur, tunc distilla in oculum aquam calidam in qua miscuisti mel: aut aquam in qua iam bullisti foenumgraecum et mel: deinde curetur cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When it has gone out, then instill into the eye warm water in which you have mixed honey; or water in which you have already boiled fenugreek and honey; then treat with the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
Â¶ De cura aquae, quae descendit in oculo, uel cataracta.	On the treatment of water that has descended into the eye, or a cataract.
Caput XXIII.	Chapter 23.
Iam Diximus species aquae in diuisione, et quae conuenit ad perforandum sermone declarante et exponente, tunc accipe illud idem secundum sanitatem.	We have now described the types of water in the division, and what is suitable for piercing with a declaring and explaining sermon; then take that same thing according to health.
Tunc ergo oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas quadratum, oppositum lumini, prope solem: et liga oculum eius sanum, et stringe eum ualde: deinde palpebram oculi eius manu tua dextra, si oculus in quo est aqua, est oculus sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then it is necessary to place the injured person sitting between your hands, opposite the light, near a window: and bind their healthy eye, and hold them strongly. Then, with your right hand, if the affected eye is the left one, or with your left hand, if the affected eye is the right one.
Deinde accipe manu tua dextra almagda, si oculus est sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then take with your right hand the clyster, if the affected eye is the left one; or with your left hand, if the affected eye is the right one.
Deinde pone extremitatem almagda prope coronam per grossitudinem radii in ipsa albedine oculi apparente lachrymalis minoris: deinde impelle almagda cum uirtute: et tu reuoluis cum eo manum tuam, donec penetret in albuginem oculi: et sentias, quod almagda iam peruenit ad rem uacuam.	Then place the end of the clyster near the crown through the thickness of the radius in the same whiteness of the eye's smaller tear-duct: then push the clyster with strength: and you turn it around with your hand, until it penetrates into the whiteness of the eye: and you feel that the clyster has now reached the empty space.
Et oportet, ut sit mensura itineris almagda ad profundum, mensura spacii quod est a pupilla usque ad finem nigredinis: et est corona oculi.	And it is necessary that the measure of the journey of the clyster be to the depth, the measure of the space which is from the pupil up to the end of the blackness: and this is the crown of the eye.
Uidebis enim ea in ipsa pupilla uisione oculi, propter claritatem tunicae corneae.	You will see them in the same pupil of the eye's vision, due to the clarity of the corneal membrane.
Deinde pone almagda usque ad locum in quo est aqua.	Then place the clyster up to the place where there is water.
Deinde preme ipsum inferius uice una post aliam.	Then press it downwards with one vein after another.
Si ergo descendit aqua statim, tunc infirmus uidet illud super quod aperit uisum suum statim, et almagda in oculo suo.	If then the water descends immediately, the injured person sees that above what was obstructing their sight immediately, and the clyster in their eye.
Deinde quiescas paululum.	Then rest a little while.
Si ergo descendat aqua, tunc depone eam secundo, praeter quod egrediatur almagda.	If then the water descends, then put it down for a second, except that the clyster should come out.
Quando ergo figitur, et non ascendit: tunc extrahe almagda cum facilitate: et tu reuoluis manum tuam paulatim.	When it is fixed, and does not rise: then withdraw the clyster with ease: and you turn your hand little by little.
Deinde dissolue in aqua aliquid ex sale claro gemmae: et ablue cum eo oculum deintus.	Then dissolve something in water from a clear crystal gem: and wash the inner eye with it.
Deinde pone extra oculum totum stuppam, aut lanam infusam oleo rosato, et albugine oui: et liga cum eo oculum sanum.	Then place the entire poultice outside the eye, or a linen soaked in rose oil and albumen of an egg, and bind it with a healthy eye.
Nos autem, et illi qui sunt nostri temporis, ponimus super eum ciminum tritum cum albumine oui.	We, however, and those who are of our time, place upon him a ground cumin with the albumen of an egg.
Quod si non obedit tibi almagda ad introitum in oculum propter duriciem suam, quoniam ex hominibus est, cuius oculus est durus ualde: tunc oportet ut accipias spatumile, quod nominatur Alberid, cuius haec est forma.	What if the collyrium does not obey you when entering the eye on account of its hardness, because it is from a certain person whose eye is hard: then it is necessary to receive a spatula, which is called Alberid, whose shape is this.
Pefora ergo cum eo ipsam coniunctiuam tantum, et non ultimes manum tuam in foramine: et non est nisi ut facias uiam ad almagda locum subtilem.	Therefore, you should approach with it alone and not put your hand finally into the opening; and it is only so that you may make a way to the collyrium to the subtle place.
Deinde intromitte almagda, secundum quod diximus.	Then introduce the collyrium, according to what we have said.
Et apud complementum operis tui, praeparetur infirmo dormitorium decenter factum, in quo dormiat super dorsum suum in domo tenebrosa: et prohibeatur ab omnibus motibus, et a tussi: et pone cibum eius illud quo lenitur natura eius: et non moueat caput suum dextra, neque sinistra omnino.	And at the completion of your work, prepare for the infirm person a well-made dormitory with a dark chamber, in which they may sleep on their back: and prohibit them from all movements, and from coughing: and place their food, that which soothes their nature: and let them not move their head to the right or left at all.
Et sit ligamentum secundum dispositionem suam usque ad diem tertium.	And let the bandage remain according to its arrangement until the third day.
Deinde solue illud in illa domo tenebrosa, et experire uisum eius: et fac eum uidere res.	Then release it in that dark chamber, and test its strength: and make it see things clearly.
Deinde reduc ligamentum usque ad diem septimum.	Then reduce the bandage until the seventh day.
Et non oportet ut faciat illud in hora curationis, aut post incisionem statim: imo oportet, ut alienes illud: propterea quod aqua ascendit uelociter per aspectum uehementem.	And it is not necessary to do that at the time of treatment, or immediately after the incision: rather, it is necessary to wait for that: because water rises quickly through a violent aspect.
Si autem accidit apostema calidum: tunc oportet ut soluas oculum ante septimum: et rectifica illud cum eo quod sedat apostema, donec sedatur: tunc absolue ipsius uisum, et pone super faciem eius orale quo regatur uisus eius sub eo diebus aliquot, ipso existente in illa domo tenebrosa.	If a hot abscess occurs: then it is necessary to release the eye before the seventh day: and apply what soothes the abscess until it is soothed: then absolutely free from its vision, and place on its face an oral applicator which regulates its vision under that day, while it remains in that dark chamber.
Deinde egrediatur a domo gradatim, et conuersetur in casis suis.	Then he should go out of the house gradually, and turn back to his own cases.
Et scias, quod in zaltea non excusatur discipulus a uisione aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super operationem.	And he should know that a disciple is not excused from the sight of something many times: then indeed he will be aware of the operation.
Et iam quidem peruenit ad nos quidam ex illis qui sunt de Alayrach, qui dixit, quod factum fuit in Alayrach magdan perforatum, quo sugitur aqua.	And now indeed it reaches us from some of those who are of Alayrach, who said that a perforated fontanelle was made in Alayrach, which is stimulated by water.
Verum ergo non uidi aliquem in terra uostra, qui fecerit illud: neque legi illud in aliquo ex libris antiquorum: et est possibile, ut sit illud nouum.	But I did not see anyone in your land who has done that: nor have I read it in any of the ancient books: and it is possible that it may be new.
Et istae sunt formae specierum ex magda, ut stet super ea qui ea ignorat.	And these are forms of species from a fontanelle, so that they stand above those who ignore them.
Fiant ex aere proprie: et sint extremitates eorum cum hac eadem subtilitate triangulatae, et extremitas acuta.	Let them be made from their own material: and let the extremities of them be with the same subtlety of triangular shape, and acute extremities.
Formae magda.	Forms of fontanelles.
Â¶ De cura Carnis natae in naso.	Concerning the treatment of a congenital flesh growth in the nose.
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter 23.
Quandoque nascuntur in naso Carnes diuersae additae, ex quibus est aliquid quod assimilatur scorpioni multorum pedum: et ex ea est caro cancerosa, lapidea, fusci coloris: et ex ea est quae est caro lenis, non fusci coloris.	Sometimes flesh growths are born in the nose, diverse and added, among which there is something that resembles a scorpion with many feet; and from them there is cancerous flesh, stony, of dark color; and from them there is soft flesh, not of dark color.
In ea ergo quae ex istis carnibus est lenis, non fraudulenta, neque cancerosa, oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas oppositum soli, et aperi nares eius, et proiice uncinum in illas carnes: deinde trahe eas ad exteriora, et incide quod comprehendisti ex eis cum spatumili subtili acuto a parte una, donec scias quod caro tota iam ablata est.	In this case, therefore, what is from these fleshes and is soft, not deceitful, nor cancerous, it is necessary to make the weak part sit between your hands opposite the ground, and open its nostrils, and insert a hook into those fleshes: then draw them outwards, and cut what you have comprehended from them with a subtle, acute instrument on one side, until you know that the whole flesh has now been removed.
Quod si remaneret aliquid ex ea cuius abscisio non est possibilis: tunc rade illud cum uno instrumentorum subtilium cum facilitate, donec non remaneat ex eo aliquid.	If something remains from it whose removal is not possible: then scrape that with one of the subtle instruments with ease, until nothing remains from it.
Si autem sanguis tibi dominatur, aut accidat apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei per id quod oportet: aut est ex apostematibus malignis, tunc propera cauterizando eum, donec abscindatur sanguis, et auferantur omnes carnes.	If blood dominates you, or a warm aposteme forms: then apply to it what is necessary; or if it is from malignant apostemes, then prepare for cauterizing him, until the blood stops and all flesh is consumed.
Deinde proiiciatur in nasum post incisionem acetum, et aqua, aut uinum.	Then there should be poured into the nose after the incision vinegar and water, or wine.
Si autem aperitur nasus, et procedat ex eo humiditas usque ad palatum, tunc scias quia iam sanus est.	If the nose is opened and humidity proceeds from it up to the palate, then know that he is already healthy.
Si uero non penetrat humiditas, secundum quod oportet, tunc scias quod intra ipsum est caro nata in superioribus ossibus naris, ad quae non peruenit cum incisione instrumentum.	If humidity does not penetrate, according to what is necessary, then know that there is a born flesh within the upper nasal bones, which did not come forth with the incision of the instrument.
Tunc ergo oportet, ut intromittas filum lini cui sit quaedam grossitudo, et noda in eo nodos multos: et pone inter omnem nodum quantitatem digiti, aut minus: et ingeniet infirmus, ut mittat extremitatem unam fili in nasum cum radio, aut cum quo possibile est ei postquam fecerit ipsum simile azer: et trahat odoratum suum, donec perueniat usque ad caassum, et egrediatur super guttur suum.	Then therefore it is necessary to introduce a linen thread with some thickness and many knots on it; and place between each knot the quantity of a finger or less; and the weak one should ingraft, so that he may put an extremity of the thread into his nose with a rod, or as much as possible after making it similar to a silver (instrument); and draw out its odor, until it reaches the cavity, and emerges above his throat.
Et multotiens quidem faciunt simile huic Attomi pueri in scholis: et est res facilis ei, qui uult.	And many indeed perform something similar to this, the boys of Atto in the schools; and it is an easy thing for him who wants.
Deinde pone duas extremitates fili, extremitatem unam quae egreditur super nasum, et alteram quae remansit in naso.	Then place two extremities of the thread, one that emerges above the nose and another that remains in the nose.
Deinde ac ministra serraturam carnis cum nodis qui sunt in filo.	Then minister to the serration of the flesh with knots which are on the thread.
Fac illud donec scias quod carnes iam sunt cum nodis fili.	Do it until you know that the flesh is already bound with the knots of the thread.
Deinde extrahe filum: et pone in nasum post abstersionem sanguinis licinium quod imbibisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud tribus diebus, aut plus, donec unguentum corrodat totum quod remansit ex carnibus.	Then extract the thread; and put into the nose after the abstraction of blood a linctus which you have imbibed in an Egyptian ointment: do it for three days or more, until the ointment corrodes all that remains from the flesh.
Deinde pone in fine rei in nasum cannulam de plumbo, diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	Then put into the nose at the end of the matter a tube of lead, for some days, until he is healed.
Si autem indiget curatione quae exiccet, utere illa.	If you need a treatment that dries out, use that one.
Ad caputpurgium faciendum, cum quo distillantur olea, et aliae medicinae in nasum, fac illud ex argento, aut aere: quod sit simile lampadi paruae, apertum sicut conchula: et meatus eius similiter.	To make a head-cleansing instrument, with which oils are distilled, and other medicines are administered through the nose, make it from silver or copper, so that it is similar to a small lamp, open like a shell, and its passage similarly.
Et si uis fac cannulam clausam, sicut canna.	And if you want to make a closed cannula, like a reed.
Et conchula instrumenti ad caputpurgium faciendum, sit plena, detecta: cui sit manubrium in postremo eius, cum quo teneas ipsam, quando calefacis in ea oleum, aut quod uis ex succis, et rebus fluxibilibus.	And the shell-shaped instrument to be made for head-cleansing should be full, uncovered: which has a handle at its end, with which you hold it, when you warm it with oil or what you want to extract from juices and fluid matters.
Et haec est forma instrumenti.	And this is the form of the instrument.
Â¶ De cura Thelul nasi.	On the treatment of a nose with a polyp.
Caput XXV.	Chapter 25.
Multotiens nascitur in extremitate nasi Thelul, et magnificatur, et augmentatur cum diebus, donec foedus fit aspectus eius.	A polyp often grows on the edge of the nose and increases and augments with time until its ugly appearance.
Et propter illud oportet, ut in cidas illud in principio apparitionis eius, et eradices totum eius.	And because of this, it is necessary to remove it from the start of its appearance and eradicate it entirely.
Deinde pone super locum, aut cauterium, aut medicinam comburentem quae stat loco eius.	Then apply to the place either a cautery or a burning medicine that stands in its stead.
Si ergo tardatur incisio eius, donec magnificetur, tunc considera, si est lapideum, durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro: quoniam apostema est cancerosum.	If therefore the incision of it is delayed until it grows, then consider whether it is stony, hard, dark-colored, and has little sensation: then do not touch it with iron, for it is a cancerous aposteme.
Multotiens enim uidi, qui incidit hmoni apostema, et accidit ex eo malicia magna super illum qui ipsum habebat.	For I have often seen those who cut into an aposteme and great evil befell them because of it, upon the one who had it.
Et si apostema est lenis tactus, non fusci coloris, et uides quod incisio possibilis est in toto eius, tunc euacua infirmum, et incide ipsum sine timore, absque pauore: et cura locum cum eo quod exiccat et constringit, donec sanetur.	And if the aposteme is of gentle touch, not dark-colored, and you see that incision is possible in its entirety, then evacuate the weak part, and cut into it without fear, without hesitation: and treat the place with what dries out and constricts, until it heals.
Â¶ De sutura nasi, et labii, et auris.	On the stitching of the nose, lip, and ear.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter 26.
Scias Quia quando accidit solutio continuitatis in una harum cartilaginum, parum confert in ea operatio, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	You should know that when a solution of continuity occurs in one of those cartilages, it contributes little to the operation, unless in certain men.
Oportet ergo quando accidit alicui aliquid ex illo, ut consideres, si est uulnus recens cum sanguine suo: et tunc aggrega duolabia uulneris cum sutura: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	It is necessary, therefore, when something happens to anyone from that, that you should consider if it is a fresh wound with its own blood; and then gather the edges of the wound with a suture: afterwards take care of it, until it heals.
Et si solutionis continuitatis labia iam separata sunt, et facta est unaquaeque pars sana: tunc oportet ut excories omnem partem a cute sua apparente, donec sanguinetur.	And if the lips of continuity are already separated, and each part has become healthy: then it is necessary to scrape away every part from its own apparent cut, until it bleeds.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cum sutura, et stringe ea, et pulueriza super ipsum sanguinem draconis, et olibanum trita: et pone supra pulueres frustum emplastri diafinicon, et alicuius alterius ex emplastris consolidatiuis: et dimitte ipsum ligatum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then gather the two lips with a suture, and bind them together, and sprinkle over it dragon's blood powder, and triple-refined olibanum; and place above the powdered emplastic a thin layer of diafinicon, and another of consolidative emplastics: and leave it bound for two days, or three.
Deinde solue ipsum, et permuta medicinam: et dimitte ipsum, donec abscindantur fila per se.	Then loosen it, and change the medicine: and leave it, until the threads separate of themselves.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it with an ointment, until it heals.
Modus autem suturae est, ut aggreges solutionem continuitatis, aut cum acubus, sicut narrauimus in sutura uentris: aut aggrega solutionem cum filo, sicut feci te scire.	The method of suturing is to gather the continuity solution, or with acupuncture needles, as we narrated in the suturing of the belly: or gather the solution with a thread, as I made you know.
Â¶ De extractione nodorum labiorum.	Concerning the removal of lip knots.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter 27.
Multis Quidem hominibus accidunt plaerumque in interioribus labiorum suorum apostemata dura similia granis herbi: et quaedam eorum minora, et maiora.	Many men indeed experience rough, hard growths like seeds of a herb inside their lips, and some of them are smaller, and others larger.
Ergo oportet ut conuertas labium, et findas super omnem nodum eius, et suspendas ipsum cum uncino, et incidas ipsum ab omni parte.	Therefore it is necessary to turn the lip upside down, and to place something over every knot of it, and to hold it with a hook, and to cut around it on all sides.
Deinde impleas locum post incisionem zegi trito, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then fill the place after the incision with warm egg, until blood separates.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto, et curetur locus cum eo, in quo est stipticitas, usquequo sanentur uulnera.	Then it is washed with vinegar, and the place where the stitching was done is treated with it, until the wounds heal.
Â¶ De incisione carnis natae super gingiuam.	About the cutting of the skin grown over the gum.
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter 28.
Multotiens nascitur super gingiuam caro addiat, quam antiqui nominant abuluss.	Flesh often grows over the gum, which the ancients call "abuluss".
Oportet ergo ut suspendas eam cum uncino: aut teneas eam cum forcipibus, et incidas eam apud radicem suam, et dimittas saniem currere, aut sanguinem.	Therefore, you should hang it with a hook; or hold it with forceps, and cut it at its root, and let the sanious fluid flow out, or blood.
Deinde pone super locum zegi tritum, aut alios pulueres stipticos, exiccatiuos.	Then put on the affected place powdered zeig (zedium), or other dry, powdered medicines.
Quod si redit illa caro post curationem, nam multotiens redit, tunc incide eam secundo, et cauteriza ipsam: ipsa namque non redit post cauterium.	But if that flesh returns after the treatment, for it often returns, then cut it a second time and cauterize it; for it will not return after cauterization.
Â¶ De rasione Dentium cum ferro.	About the filing of teeth with iron.
Caput XXIX.	Chapter 29.
Quandoque aggregantur in superficiebus Dentium ab interiori et extetiori parte, et inter gingiuas cortices asperi, turpes, et quandoque denigrantur, et citrini fiunt, et uirides, donec peruenit ex illo corruptio ad gingiuam, et foedi fiunt dentes per illud.	When they accumulate on the surface of teeth from the inner and outer parts, and between the rough, scurfy gums, and when they become black, and turn yellowish, and greenish, until corruption reaches the gum, and the teeth become foul through that.
Oportet ergo ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et caput eius in sinu tuo, et rade molam et dentem, in quo apparent tibi cortices, et res similis arenae: donec non remaneat ex eis aliquid, et similiter fac de nigredine, et uiriditate, et citrinitate, et aliis donec mundentur.	Therefore, you should sit the weak person between your hands, and their head in your lap, and scrape the teeth with a file, on which you see the roughness, and a thing similar to sand; until nothing remains of them, and similarly do for blackness, and greenishness, and yellowness, and other things until they are cleaned.
Si ergo auferatur quod in eis est a principio rasionis, bonum est: et si non, tunc itera super eos rasionem die alio, secundo, et tertio, donec ad ultimum perueniat studium in eo quod uis.	If therefore what is in them from the beginning of filing is removed, it is good; and if not, then repeat the filing on them another day, a second, and a third, until finally the desired result is achieved.
Et scias, quod dens indiget rasoriis diuersarum formarum, multarum figurarum: secundum quod praeparatur operationi tuae: proptera, quod rasorium quo raditur dens ab inferiori parte, est aliud a rasorio quo raditur inter dentes, secundum formas alias.	And know that a tooth requires filings of diverse forms and many figures, according to what is prepared for your operation; therefore, the file with which a tooth is scraped from below is different from the file with which it is scraped between the teeth, according to other forms.
Et istae formae rasoriorum sint apud te praeparatae, quas uides.	And these forms of rasps should be prepared for you, which you will see.
Â¶ De extractione doloris Dentium.	On the extraction of painful teeth.
Caput XXX.	Chapter 30.
Oportet ut cures Dentem a dolore suo cum omni ingenio, et tardes in eradicatione eius.	It is necessary to cure a tooth of its pain with all ingenuity, and to be slow in its eradication.
Non est enim quod uicem eius suppleat quando eradicatur: quoniam est substantia sublimis: donec quando non est excusatio de eradicatione eius, tunc oportet quando cogitur infirmus eradicare ipsum, ut firmetur, et certificetur apud te dens dolens.	For it is not fitting to supply its place when it is eradicated: because it is a sublime substance: unless when there is no excuse for its eradication, then it is necessary to eradicate the weakened tooth, so that it may be strengthened and confirmed as a painful tooth with you.
Multotiens enim decipit infirmum dolor, et putat quia est in dente saha et eradicat ipsum: deinde non recedit dolor, donec eradicetur dens infirmus.	For often the pain of the weakened tooth deceives and seems to be in a healthy tooth, and it is eradicated: then the pain does not cease until the weakened tooth is eradicated.
Nos enim iam uidimus illud ex operatione phlebotomatorum.	We have already seen that from the operation of blood-letters.
Cum ergo certificatur apud te dens dolens ipsemet, tunc oportet ut scarifices in circumitu dentis cum spatumili, in quo sit quiddam uirtutis, donec soluatur gingiua ab omni parte: deinde moue ipsum digitis tuis, aut cum forcipibus subtilibus in primis paulatim, donec concutias ipsum.	When therefore the painful tooth itself is confirmed to you, then it is necessary to scarify around the tooth with a spatula-like instrument, in which there is some virtue, until the gum is loosened on every side: then move it with your fingers or with subtle forceps at first gradually, until you shake it.
Deinde loca tunc in eo forcipes magnos locatione bona, et caput infirmi inter genua tua: quod iam bene tenuisti, ita quod non moueatur: deinde trahe dentem secundum rectitudinem, ut non frangas ipsum.	Then place the large forceps in a good position on it, and hold the head of the weakened tooth between your knees: which you have already held well, so that it does not move: then pull the tooth straight out, so as not to break it.
Si ergo non egreditur, tunc accipe aliquod illorum instrumentorum, et intromitte ipsum sub eo ab omni parte cum facilitate, et conare motionem eius, sicut fecisti in primis.	If therefore it does not come out, then take one of those instruments and insert it under the tooth on every side with ease, and try to move it as you did at first.
Si autem dens est perforatus, aut corrosus: tunc oportet ut impleas illud foramen panno: et stringas ipsum cum extremitate radii subtilis, ut non frangatur in hora constrictionis tuae super ipsum cum forcipibus.	If the tooth is perforated or corroded, then it is necessary to fill that hole with a piece of cloth: and bind it with a subtle root extremity, so that it does not break during the time of your constriction on it with forceps.
Et oportet, ut exquisite agas cum scarificatione in circumitu gingiuae ab omni parte multum.	And it is necessary to act carefully with scarification around the gum on every side, much and often.
Et custodi fortitudinem tuam, ut non frangas ipsum, et remaneat pars eius, et redeat super infirmum ex ea malicia quae sit maior dolore eius primo.	And preserve your strength, so that you do not break it, and a part of it remains, and returns above the weakened area from that greater evil which is its first pain.
Et caue, ne facias illud quod ignorantes faciunt phlebotomatores in festinatione sua, et audacia ipsorum super eradicationem eius, praeter quod administrent illud quod narrauimus.	And beware, lest you do that which ignorant bleeders do in their haste, and the boldness of theirs in eradicating it, beyond what they administer, as we have narrated.
Multotiens enim faciunt euenire super homines infirmitates magnas, quarum difficiliores sunt ut frangantur, et remaneant radices eius omnes, aut quaedam earum: aut ut extrahant ipsum cum quibusdam ossibus mandibulae: sicut testificati sumus multotiens illud.	For they often cause great infirmities to occur in men, whose difficulties are such that they break them, and all the roots of these remain, or some of them: or as they extract it with certain bones of the jaw: as we have testified many times.
Deinde colluatur post eradicationem eius cum uino, aut cum aceto et sale.	Then it is washed out after its eradication with wine, or with vinegar and salt.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis ex locis (multotiens enim accidit) tunc tere aliquid ex zegi, et imple cum eo locum: et si non, cauteriza ipsum si non confert tibi zegi.	What if a flow of blood occurs from the places (for it often happens), then take something from zegi, and fill the place with it: and if not, cauterize it if it does not conduce to zegi.
Formae forcipum subtilium quibus mouetur dens in primis, sint longarum extremitatum, breuis manubrii, grossi, ut non duplicentur quando cum eis premitur super dentem: sint sicut uides grossorum manubriorum, donec quando stringis cum eis, non dent seipsas, neque duplicentur: breuium extremitatum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut ex faled decenter facti, directarum extremitatum: et in eorum extremitatibus sint dentes, quorum quidam ingrediantur in quosdam, et stringant constrictione decenti, forti.	The forms of subtle forceps which are moved densely at first, should be long in their extremities, short in the hand, thick, so that they do not duplicate when pressed with them on a tooth: they should be like the examples of thick manual ones, until when you squeeze with them, they do not slip, nor duplicate: short extremity, and they should be made of iron or forged from decently fashioned straight extremities: and in their extremities there should be teeth, some of which enter into others, and squeeze with a decent constriction, strongly.
Et quandoque fiunt extremitates sicut forma oris auis quae nominatur ciconia, et sunt fortis constrictionis.	And sometimes the extremities are made like the form of a bird's beak, which is called a ciconia, and they are strong in constriction.
Â¶ De eradicatione Dentium, et extractione ossium mandibularum fractorum.	Concerning the Eradication of Teeth, and the Extraction of Jawbone Fractures.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter 31.
Quando remanet apud eradicationem Dentis qui frangitur aliquid, tunc oportet ut ponas super locum cotum cum butyro die uno, aut duobus diebus, donec mollificetur locus: deinde intromitte ad ipsum algasti, aut forcipes: quorum extremitates assimilantur ori auis quae nominatur ciconia.	When something remains after the eradication of a tooth which is broken, then it is necessary to put a compress on the place with butter for one day or two days, until the location softens: then introduce into it an algast, or forceps: whose extremities are similar to a bird's beak, which is called a ciconia.
Forma autem haec est forcipum.	The form of this is a forceps.
Sint extremitates eorum factae sicut lima deintus: aut sicut aliskilfegi.	Their extremities are made like files within, or like polished awls.
Si ergo non obedit tibi ad exitum cum istis forcipibus, tunc oportet, ut caues super radicem, et detegas carnem totam, et intromittas instrumentum quod nominatur Palanca parua, cuius forma est haec.	If it does not obey you at the exit with these forceps, then it is necessary to hollow out above the root, and to detach the whole flesh, and to introduce an instrument which is called a small Palanca, whose form is this.
Sit breuis extremitatis, grossae parumper: et non sit imbibitum, ut non frangatur.	Let the extremity be short, somewhat thick: and let it not be soaked, so that it does not break.
Si ergo egreditur radix per illud, est bonum: et si non, iuuare oportet cum istis instrumentis aliis quorum formae sunt istae.	If the root emerges through that, it is good: and if not, it is necessary to help with these other instruments whose forms are these.
Forma primi triangulatae extremitatis, in qua est quaedam grossitudo.	The form of the first triangular extremity, in which there is a certain thickness.
Forma triangulatae extremitatis subtilis.	The form of the triangular extremity, subtle.
Etiam iuuatur cum hoc instrumento habente duos ramos, cuius haec est forma.	It is also helped with this instrument having two branches, whose form is this.
Et cum aliis instrumentis et ferramentis quae praecesserunt in rasione dentium.	And with other instruments and tools which preceded in the filing of teeth.
Etiam sit iuuamentum cum hoc instrumento quod assimilatur uncino magno, huius formae, triangulatae extremitatis tortae, in qua est quiddam grossitudinis, ut non frangatur: et sit non imbibitum.	It is also a help with this instrument which is similar to a large hook, of this form, a triangular twisted extremity, in which there is some thickness, so that it does not break; and let it not be soaked.
Et scias, quod instrumenta dentium sunt multa: et similiter reliqua instrumenta non computantur, et artifex prudens, subtilis in arte sua inuenit per se ipsum instrumentum, secundum quod significant ei operatio et aegritudines ipsae.	And know that there are many instruments for teeth: and similarly the remaining instruments are not counted, and the skilled artisan, subtle in his art, finds by himself the instrument, according to what the operation and the very illnesses signify to him.
Quoniam ex agritudinibus sunt ad quas non dixerunt antiqui instrumentum, propter diuersitatem specierum earum.	Since they are from painful things which are for those about which the ancient ones did not speak of an instrument, on account of the diversity of their species.
Si autem frangatur os ex mandibula, aut ex aliis ossibus oris, aut putrefit: tunc perscrutare super ipsum in loco suo cum eo quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis et forcipibus quae dixi in extractione radicum, et iuuare cum gesti, cuius forma est haec.	If, however, the bone is broken from the jaw, or from other bones of the mouth, or putrefies: then to thoroughly examine it in its place with that which is suitable for it from the instruments and forceps which I mentioned in extracting roots, and to help with gestures, whose form is this.
Sit in eo quiddam grossitudinis paulatim, ut stringatur, uel teneatur cum eo os, et non fugiat et uadat, donec egrediatur os: et restaura locum cum medicinis conuenientibus ad illud.	Here is the translation:
Si autem in osse est putredo parua, tunc rade ipsum a putredine sua, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	If, however, there is a small amount of decay in the bone, then scrape it away with its decay, and take care of it until it heals.
De serratura Dentium eminentium super alios.	About the extraction of prominent teeth above others.
Caput XXXII.	Chapter 32.
Quando Dentes eminent non secundum cursum suum naturalem, foeda fit per illud forma: et praecipue quando accidit illud in mulieribus, et puellis, scilicet uenalibus.	When prominent teeth do not follow their natural course, a foul appearance is formed through that shape; and especially when this happens to women and girls, namely those of a tender age.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	It is therefore necessary to consider.
Nam si dens est natus post dentem alium, et non locatur, uel est possibilis eius serratura, neque limatura ipsius: tunc eradica ipsum: et si est annexus cum dente alio, tunc incide ipsum cum isto instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	For if a tooth is born behind another tooth and does not take its place, or it is possible to serrate it, nor to file it: then extract it: and if it is connected with another tooth, then cut it with that instrument whose shape is this.
Est simile rostro paruo, et fit ex ferro indo, acutae extremitatis ualde.	It is similar to a small file, and is made from iron, with a very sharp point.
Et sit incisio tua qua ipsum incidis in diebus multis, et propter duriciem dentis, et ut non commoueatur alius ex dentibus.	And let your cutting be thus, that you cut it over many days, and because of the hardness of the tooth, and so that another tooth is not disturbed.
Si autem est eminens expositus limaturae suae: tunc lima ipsum cum lima ex indo, cuius forma est haec.	If, however, it is prominent and exposed to its filing: then file it with a file made of iron, whose shape is this.
Sit totum ex indo, et manubrium eius minutorum punctorum ualdae, sicut lima cum qua fiunt acus: cum quo limetur dens paulatim in diebus multis cum facilitate, ut non commoueatur dens, et cadat: deinde leni ipsum, in fine rade ipsum cum quibusdam rasoriis.	Let it be entirely made of iron, and its handle having small pointed points, like a file with which awls are made: with which the tooth is filed little by little over many days with ease, so that the tooth is not disturbed and falls out: then smooth it, finally scrape it with certain rasps.
Quod si est dens, ex quo frangatur pars, et laedit linguam: tunc oportet ut limes eum etiam, donec auferatur asperitas illius fractionis, et aequetur: et applanetur, et non laedat linguam, neque corrumpat sermonem.	If the tooth is one that breaks off a part and hurts the tongue: then it is necessary to file it also, until the roughness of that fracture is removed, and it is made smooth: and let it be flattened, so that it does not hurt the tongue or corrupt speech.
Â¶ De retatione Dentium cum filis auri.	About the fastening of teeth with golden wires.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter 33.
Quando accidit Dentibus anterioribus concussio et commotio a percussione, aut casu: et non potest infirmus stringere super illud quod comedit ut non cadat: et curasti eos cum medicinis stipticis, et non ualuit curatio: tunc ingenium in eis est, ut stringantur cum filo auri: quoniam argentum fit uiride, et putrefit post dies: sed aurum nunquam mutatur.	When the front teeth receive a concussion and shock from a blow or fall, and are unable to hold on to what they chew so that it does not fall out: and you have treated them with medicines that constrict, and the treatment did not help: then the idea is to fasten them with a golden wire: because silver turns green and decays after days; but gold never changes.
Et sit filum medium in subtilitate et grossicie secundum quantitatem quod capiat inter Dentes.	And let the middle thread be in subtlety and thickness according to the quantity that it takes between the teeth.
Et forma quidem retationis est, ut accipias filum, et intromittas duplum eius inter duos dentes sanos: deinde texeas cum duabus extremitatibus fili inter dentes motos, siue unus sit, aut plures, donec peruenias cum tela usque ad dentem sanum alterius partis.	And the form of retention is thus, that you receive a thread and insert its double between two healthy teeth: then weave with both extremities of the thread between moving teeth, whether one or several, until you arrive with the web up to the healthy tooth on the other side.
Deinde itera texturam usque ad partem a qua incaepisti: et stringe manum tuam cum subtilitate et sapientia, donec non remoueatur prorsus: et sit constrictio tua qua stringis filum, apud radices dentium, ut non euadat.	Then repeat the weaving up to the part from which you began: and tighten your hand with subtlety and wisdom, until it is not removed outright: and let your constriction be where you tighten the thread, at the roots of the teeth, so that it does not come loose.
Deinde incide extremitates fili superfluentes cum forficibus: et aggrega utrumque, et conuerte eas cum gesti: et occulta ipsas inter dentem sanum et dentem motum, ut non laedat linguam: deinde dimittatur ita strictum dum remanet.	Then cut the superfluous extremities of the thread with scissors: and gather both, and convert them into a knot: and hide them between the healthy tooth and the moving tooth, so that they do not harm the tongue: then let it be tightened thus until it remains.
Si autem soluitur, aut inciditur, stringe eos cum filo alio, et stabit cum eo taliter tempore toto.	If however it becomes loose, or is cut, tie them with another thread, and establish it in this way for the entire time.
Et haec est forma Dentium, et figura retationis duorum dentium sanorum, et duorum dentium motorum, sicut uides.	And this is the form of teeth, and the figure of retention of two healthy teeth, and two moving teeth, as you see.
Et quandoque fit, ut redeat dens unus, aut duo post casum urriusque in locis suis, et retentur sicut narrauimus, et remaneant: et non facit illud nisi artifex, prudens, et expertus.	And when it happens that a tooth or two return to their own places after a fall, and are retained as we have described, and remain: and this does not happen unless the craftsman is prudent, experienced, and skilled.
Et quandoque aptatur aliquod ex ossibus uaccinis: et fit ex eo sicut forma dentis, et ponitur in loco, ex quo munitur dens et stringitur, sicut diximus: et remanet, et seruitur cum eo tempore longo.	And when something is prepared from the bones of animals: and it is made into the form of a tooth, and placed in its position, where the tooth is strengthened and tied, as we have said: and it remains, and serves with it for a long time.
Â¶ De incisione ligamenti quod accidit sub lingua, et prohibet loquelam.	Concerning the cutting of the ligament that occurs under the tongue, and prevents speaking.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter 34.
Quandoque ligamentum hoc quod accidit sub lingua, est aut naturale, cum quo nascitur homo, aut accidentale, a uulnere quod iam consolidatum est.	When the ligament that occurs under the tongue is either natural, with which man is born, or accidental, from a wound that has already consolidated.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi in capite eius in sinu tuo, et eleua linguam eius: deinde incide illud ligamentum neruosum per latitudinem, donec soluatur lingua a retentione sua.	And the operation is to open the weak bone in its head in your sinus, and lift up its tongue; then cut through that nerve ligament along the width, until the tongue is freed from its restraints.
Quod si in eo fuerit quiddam duriciei et nodationis, et fuerit illud ex consolidatione uulneris: tunc proiice in illud uncinum, et finde illud per latitudinem, donec incidas ligamentum, et soluatur nodatio.	If there is something hard and knotted in it, and it comes from the consolidation of a wound, then push in that hook, and feel it along the width, until you cut through the ligament, and the knot is freed.
Et caue, ne sit fissura in profundo carnis, et incidas arteriam illic, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And be careful, lest there be a fissure in the deep flesh, and you cut through an artery there, and a flow of blood occurs.
Deinde colluatur in uestigio incisionis cum aqua rosata, aut cum aceto, aut aqua frigida.	Then let it be washed with rose water at the site of the incision, or with vinegar, or cold water.
Deinde pone sub lingua licinium ex lino, quod teneat infirmus in omni nocte: ut non consolidetur secundo.	Then put a linen poultice under the tongue, which holds the weak part throughout the night: so that it does not consolidate again.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc pone super locum zegi tritum.	If a flow of blood occurs, then put powdered zu-gyg (zoug or zu-gyg is an unknown substance, but it seems to be a type of powder or dust) on the spot.
Si uero uincit te sanguis, tunc cauteriza locum cum cauterio lentiginoso, quod conuenit ad illud: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	If the blood flows copiously from you, then cauterize the spot with a gentle cautery, which is suitable for that: then take care of it with the rest of the treatment, until it heals.
Â¶ De extractione Ranulae quae fit sub lingua.	Concerning the extraction of a ranula that forms under the tongue.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter 35.
Quandoque accidit sub lingua apostema quod assimilatur Ranae paruae, prohibens linguam ab operatione sua naturali: et fortasse magnificatur adeo, donec implet os.	When an abscess occurs under the tongue that resembles a small frog, hindering the tongue from its natural function: and perhaps it swells so much, until it fills the mouth.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi coram sole: et considera apostema.	And the operation for this is to open the weak bone before you: and examine the abscess.
Si ergo uides ipsum fusci coloris, aut nigri, durum, cui non inuenit infirmus sensum: tunc non tangas ipsum, quoniam est cancer.	If you see it is of a dark blue or black color, hard, and has no weak sensation: then do not touch it, for it is a cancer.
Et si est decliue ad albedinem, in quo est humiditas, tunc proiice in ipsum uncinum, et incide ipsum cum spatumili subtili, et libera ipsum ab omni parte.	And if it declines to whiteness, in which there is moisture, then push into it a hook, and cut it with a subtle spatula, and free it from all parts.
Quod si uincit te sanguis in hora tuae operationis, tunc pone super ipsum zegi tritum, donec abscindatur sanguis: deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec extrahas ipsum cum complemento eius.	If blood flows out during your operation, then put a compress of triturated zegi on it until the bleeding stops; afterwards return to your operation, until you extract it with its complement.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto et sale: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then let it be cleansed with vinegar and salt; and take care to heal the remaining wound with a suitable treatment, until it is healthy.
Â¶ De curatione apostematis duarum Amigdalarum.	On the treatment of two abscesses on the limbs of the anus.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter 36.
Quandoque accidunt inter guttur godad, id est, glandulae, quae similantur algodad, quae accidunt deforis: et nominantur duae Amigdalae: quas quando curas cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non sanantur, tunc considera.	When there occur among the guttural glands, that is, the glandulae which resemble almonds, which occur before: and they are called two Amigdalae: which when you treat with what we said in the division, and they do not heal, then consider.
Si ergo est apostema durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro.	If it is a hard abscess, of a dark color, with little sensation: then do not touch it with iron.
Et si est rubei coloris, et radix eius est grossa: tunc non tangas ipsum etiam cum ferro, timens fluxum sanguinis, imo dimitte ipsum, donec maturetur.	And if it is of a red color, and its root is thick: then do not touch it with iron either, fearing a flow of blood, but rather leave it alone until it matures.
Et tunc aut perforabis ipsum: aut rumpetur per se.	And then you will either perforate it, or it will burst by itself.
Et si est albi coloris, rotundum, et est radix eius subtilis: tunc oportet ipsum incidi.	And if it is of a white color, round, and its root is subtle: then it is fitting to cut into it.
Et operatio in ipso est, ut consideres ante operationem suam, si quieuit apostema eius calidum quiete completum, aut imminuitur quadam diminutione: tunc ergo fac sedere infirmum coram sole, et caput eius sit in sinu tuo: et aperi os eius, et accipiat seruiens inter manus suas, et premat linguam eius inferius cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	And the operation on it is, that you should consider before your operation, if the abscess has quieted down, completely calm and warm, or has diminished somewhat: then therefore make the patient sit in a comfortable position before a window, and his head should be in your lap: and open his mouth, and receive carefully between your hands, and press his tongue downwards with an instrument, of which this is the shape.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere, quod sit subtile sicut cultellus.	Let it be made from silver or copper, which should be as subtle as a knife.
Cum ergo premis cum eo linguam, et ostenditur tibi apostema, et cadit super ipsum uisus tuus: tunc accipe uncinum, et fige ipsum in amigdalam, et extrahe eam ad exteriora quantum potes, praeter quod trahas cum ea aliquid ex tunicis.	When you press with it the tongue, and the abscess is shown to you, and your gaze falls upon it: then take a hook, and fix it in the tonsil, and extract it as much as possible towards the outside, except that you draw out something from the tissues.
Deinde incide eam cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma quae sequitur.	Then cut into it with an instrument, whose shape is as follows.
Assimilatur forficibus: uerumtamen extremitates eius sint curuatae, ita quod orificium cuiusque earum est in directo alterius acute: unde cura ut sit ex ferro indo, aut alfuled imbibitum.	It is assimilated to a biting forceps: indeed, the extremities of these are curved, so that the orifice of each one is directed at an acute angle; therefore, take care that it be made from iron, or ivory, imbued with.
Si autem non est praesens hoc instrumentum, tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili, cuius haec est forma.	If however this instrument is not available, then cut into it with a spatula, whose shape is as follows.
Sit acutum a parte una, non acutum a parte altera.	It is sharp on one side, not sharp on the other side.
Et postquam incidis amigdalam unam, incide alteram secundum hanc eandem speciem incisionis.	And after you have cut into one vein, cut into the other according to the same type of incision.
Deinde post incisionem gargarizet infirmus cum aqua frigida, aut cum aceto et aqua.	Then after the incision, gargle the affected part with cold water, or with vinegar and water.
Si autem accidat ei fluxus sanguinis, gargarizet cum aqua in qua bulliti sunt cortices granatorum: aut folia myrti, et similia illis ex stipticis, donec abscindatur fluxus sanguinis: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	If, however, a flow of blood occurs, gargle with water in which the bark of granated trees has been boiled: or myrtle leaves and similar things from styptics, until the flow of blood is stopped: then take care of it, until it is healed.
Et quandoque nascuntur in gutture apostemata alia, praeter amigdalas duas.	And when other apostemes appear on the throat, apart from the two tonsils.
Incide ergo ea secundum quod dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum aequaliter.	Cut therefore equally according to what I said about the incision of the two tonsils.
Et ego quidem iam medicatus fui mulierem ex apostemate, quod natum erat inter guttur eius, quod trahebat ad fuscedinem, pauci sensus, quod iam fere clauserat guttur: et mulier respirabat a meatu stricto, et iam prohibuerat ei comestionem, et potum aquae: et iam peruenerat ad mortem, si remansisset uno die, aut duobus diebus.	And I have indeed already treated a woman for an aposteme that was born in her throat, which was drawing her to darkness, little sense, which had almost closed her throat: and the woman was breathing with a narrow passage, and had already prohibited food and drink, and water: and she was already nearing death, if it had remained one day or two days.
Et apostema tantum ascenderat, quod emiserat duos ramos, donec exierant super duo foramina nasi.	And the aposteme had only risen so far that it had sent out two branches, until they issued forth through two nostrils.
Properaui ergo festinanter, et fixi in unum eorum uncinum.	I hastened therefore to seize one of them quickly, and fixed it with a hook.
Deinde traxi ipsum, et tracta ex eo est portio magna.	Then I pulled it out, and a large portion was withdrawn from it.
Deinde abscidi eam, ubi comprehendi ex foramine nasi.	Then I cut it off, where I grasped it from the nostril aperture.
Deinde feci illud ei quod processit ex foramine nasi altero.	Then I did to it what had proceeded from the other nostril.
Deinde aperui os eius, et pressi linguam eius: et postea fixi uncinum in ipsum apostema: deinde abscidi ex eo partem eius, et non cucurrit ex eo nisi sanguis paucus: absolutum est ergo guttur mulieris, et incepit statim bibere aquam, deinde accepit ex cibo.	Then I opened its mouth and pressed its tongue: and afterwards I fixed a hook in the apostema: then I cut off part of it, and only a little blood flowed from it: the throat of the woman was freed, and she began to drink water immediately, then took food.
Non ergo cessaui incidere ex illo apostemate multotiens tempore longo: et apostema succedebat loco eius quod incidebam, donec prolongatum est nimis et cum ea illud.	I did not cease to cut from that apostema many times over a long period: and the apostema succeeded in the place of what I was cutting, until it was prolonged excessively and with it.
Ingeniaui ergo, et cauterizaui apostema inter guttur.	I therefore used ingenuity, and cauterized the apostema within the throat.
Stetit ergo ab additione: deinde ambulaui a parte, et non sciui quid fecit Deus cum ea post me.	It stood still therefore from then on: then I walked away from that part, and did not know what God did with it afterwards.
Â¶ De incisione apostematis uuulae.	On the Incision of a Wart on the Uvula.
Caput XXXVII.	Chapter 37.
Quando descendit catarrus ad uuulam, et apostematur, et est long: tunc ipsa nominatur perpendicularis: et si est in inferiori parte grossa, rotunda, tunc ipsa nominatur uua.	When a catarh descends to the uvula and becomes an apostema, and it is long: then it is called perpendicular: and if it is thick and round on the lower part, then it is called a wart.
Quando curatur cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: et uides quod apostema calidum quieuit ab ea, et est subtilis: tunc oportet ut incidas eam.	When it is treated with what we said in the division, and the treatment does not help: and you see that the hot apostema has quieted down from it, and it is subtle: then it is necessary to cut into it.
Et quae ex ea est aggregata rotunda, et non est ei longitudo, et est sanguinea, aut fusci coloris, aut nigri, et non est ei sensus: tunc oportet ut deuites incisionem eius.	And what is gathered around it is round, and it has no length, and it is bloody, or dark purple, or black in color, and it has no sensation: then it is necessary to avoid cutting into it.
In ea enim est timor super infirmum.	For there is fear of harming the patient.
Oportet ergo quando uides eam secundum modum quem dixi ex albedine, et longitudine sua, ut facias sedere infirmum coram sole: et premas linguam eius cum instrumento, cuius praecessit narratio: deinde fige uncinum in uuam, et trahe eam inferius: et incide eam cum uno duorum instrumentorum quae dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum.	Therefore it is necessary when you see it according to the method that I mentioned, concerning its whiteness and its length, to make the patient sit in front of a light source: and press his tongue with an instrument, whose description has preceded: then fix a hook in the uvula, and draw it downwards: and cut into it with one of the two instruments that I mentioned in the incision of the two tonsils.
Et oportet ut non incidas ex ea, nisi illud quod additur super naturalem terminum sine additione.	And it is necessary that you do not cut except from that which is added above the natural terminus without addition.
Nam si tu incidis ex ea plus, laedes uocem et sermonem.	For if you cut more than that, you will cause harm and speechlessness.
Deinde post incisionem utere eo quod narrauimus in incisione duarum amigdalarum: et cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then after the incision, use what we have described in the incision of the two almond-shaped (organs), and treat it, until it is healed.
Si autem terretur infirmus ab incisione: tunc oportet ut utaris ingenio in cauterizatione eius absque timore et pauore.	If, however, the patient is frightened by the incision, then it is necessary to use artfulness in cauterizing it without fear and trembling.
Et modus cauterii in ea non est, nisi cum aqua acuta: et est, ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	And the method of cauterization in this case is not with sharp water, but rather, so that you place the patient's head on your lap.
Deinde preme linguam eius cum instrumento quod diximus.	Then press their tongue with the instrument we mentioned earlier.
Deinde accipe ex aqua quam dixi tibi in capitulo cauterizandi, et confice cum ea calcem non extinctam, et pone eam non spissam, neque subtilem, et imple ex ea concauitatem huius instrumenti, cuius haec est forma.	Then take the water I told you about in the chapter on cauterization, and mix it with a non-extinguished lime, and make it neither too thick nor too subtle, and fill the concavity of this instrument, which is of this shape.
Sit extremitati eius in qua ponitur medicina concauitas, sicut concauitas cochlearis radii.	Let the extremities of it be where the medicine is placed, curved like the curve of a cochlear radius.
Et pone instrumentum cum medicina super uuulam ipsam: et infirmus sit iacens super latus suum, ut currat saliua ex ore eius ex intrinseca medicina, ut non descendat ex ea ad guttur ipsius aliquid, et laedat ipsum.	And place the instrument with the medicine on the same ulcer: and let the patient be lying on his side, so that saliva flows out of his mouth from the inner medicine, so that nothing descends from it into his throat, and harms him.
Deinde tene manum tuam cum medicina.	Then hold your hand with the medicine.
Et tu ex primas eam super uuulam quantitate medietatis horae, donec uideas eam iam denigratam, et sedatam mordicationem medicinae.	And you apply it first to the ulcer in the quantity of a mid-hour dose, until you see it already darkened and soothed by the biting of the medicine.
Et si uis ut accipias cotum, et inuoluas ipsum super extremitatem radii, et infundas cotum cum medicina, et intromittas radium cum coto in cannulam desuper, donec adhaereat cotum super uuulam.	And if you wish to receive the pus, and wrap it around the extremity of the radius, and pour the pus with medicine, and insert the radius with the pus into a tube from above, until the pus adheres to the ulcer.
Fac illud multotiens, donec consequaris quod uis de cauterizatione uuae.	Do that many times, until you achieve what you want regarding the cauterization of this ulcer.
Deinde dimitte eam: ipsa namque arescit et cadit post tres dies, aut quatuor.	Then dismiss her: for she will then take care of herself and will fall after three days, or four.
Quod si indiges ut iteres medicinam, itera ipsam: et post cauterizationem absterge in circumitu uuae cum coto imbibito in butyro, et mundifica cum eo quod est in circumitu eius ex medicina: et colluatur cum aqua frigida.	What if you intend to administer medicine, administer it thus: and after cauterization, wipe away the area around the wound with a cloth soaked in butter, and cleanse it with what is around it from the medicine; and cool it with cold water.
Et curetur extrinsecus cum embrocis, et deintus cum gargarismis, donec sanetur.	And let it be treated externally with poultices, and internally with gargles, until it is healed.
Haec ergo species curationis est salubrior incisione et longinquior a timore.	This therefore is a more wholesome method of treatment by incision and longer free from fear.
Et quandoque curatur uuula etiam cum eo quod est subtilius quam cauterium et incisio: curatur enim cum suffumigatione, secundum hunc modum.	And when an ulcer is treated also with what is more subtle than cauterization and incision: it is treated indeed with fumigation, in this manner.
Sume calamentum, et hyssopum, et origanum, et rutam, et sseah, et chamomillam, et abrotanum, et similia eis ex herbis: et aggrega ea omnia, aut quaedam eorum in olla, et submergantur cum aceto, et bulliant: et olla sit lutata cum luto decenter: et sit in medio ollae foramen, super quod componatur instrumentum concauum secundum hunc modum.	Take calendula, and hyssop, and origan, and rue, and ssea, and chamomile, and abrotan, and similar ones among the herbs: and gather all of them, or some of them in a pot, and submerge them with vinegar, and boil: and let the pot be well-coated with clay: and let there be a hole in the middle of the pot, above which an instrument concave according to this manner is placed.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere: et intromittatur extremitas, in qua est granatum, in os infirmi, donec ascendat uapor ad uuulam super cannulam, donec obscuretur uuula multum.	Let it be made of silver or copper: and let the extremities be introduced, in which there is a pellet, into the mouth of the weak person, until the vapor ascends to the ulcer through a reed, until the ulcer is much obscured.
Deinde itera super ipsam multotiens, donec arescat.	Then repeat it many times over it, until it takes care of itself.
Et caue, ne facias hanc curationem in principio aduentus apostematis.	And beware, lest you perform this treatment at the beginning of an apostemic disease.
Plaerumque enim addit in apostemate: et non oportet ut facias illud nisi apud declinationem apostematis eius calidi.	For it is added in an aposteme: and it is not suitable to perform that unless at the decline of its warm aposteme.
Si autem non est praesens tibi hoc instrumentum, tunc accipe cannam, et compone in extremitate eius corticem oui: ut non comburatur os infirmi: quoniam cortex oui prohibet uaporem comburere os: et haec est ex bona curatione cum salute.	If you do not have this instrument at hand, then take a reed, and place a layer of cortex on its extremity: so that the mouth of the weak person is not burned: because the cortex prevents the vapor from burning the mouth: and this is part of good treatment with health.
Â¶ De extractione spinarum, et ossium de gula.	On the extraction of spines and bones from the throat.
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter 38.
Multotiens adhaeret in gutture os, aut spina piscis, aut aliud.	Many times a bone sticks in the throat, or a fish bone, or something else.
Oportet ergo ut extrahas quod ex eis est apparens super quod cadit uisus, postquam premis linguam cum instrumento apud solem, et declaratur tibi quod est in gutture.	It is necessary therefore to extract what appears above what has fallen, after you have pressed the tongue with an instrument towards the roof of the mouth, and it will be clear to you what is in the throat.
Et quod non apparet tibi et occultatur in gutture, oportet ut facias uomere infirmum antequam digeratur cibus in stomacho.	And what does not appear to you and is hidden in the throat, it is necessary to make a weak vomiting before food is digested in the stomach.
Fortasse enim egredietur res annexa per uomitum.	Perhaps indeed the attached thing will come out through vomiting.
Aut deglutiat infirmus frustum napi, aut radicem lactucae, aut deglutiat buccellam panis sicci: aut accipiat frustum spongiae marinae siccae lenis: et liga ipsum in filo, deinde deglutiat ipsum.	Or swallow a weak piece of turnip, or the root of lettuce, or swallow a morsel of dry bread: or take a piece of dried marine sponge and tie it with a thread, then swallow it.
Cum ergo peruenit ad locum ubi sunt spinae, aut os, et extrahitur, tunc egreditur.	When it reaches the place where the spines or bone are, and is extracted, then it comes out.
Si ergo non egreditur cum eo quod diximus: tunc utere instrumento ex plumbo secundum hanc formam.	If therefore it does not come out with what we have said: then use an instrument made of lead in this shape.
Sit grossius quam Radius parumper, et in extremitate eius sit curuitas, quam intromittat in guttur suum cum facilitate: et ipse habeat caput suum eleuatum sursum.	Let it be thicker than a radius of a finger, and at its extremity let there be a curvature, which introduces itself into the throat with ease: and let it have its head elevated upwards.
Et caueat a tactu suae epiglotis, ut non accidat ei tussis, et impellat cum eo os, aut spinam, aut intromittat ipsum medicus manu sua.	And let it beware of touching its epiglottis, lest it should cause a cough, and the doctor pushes with his hand, either the bone or spine, or introduces it himself.
Verum quod infirmus intromittat, hoc est melius: propter scientiam suam de loco rei annexae: et impellat inferius, aut trahat manum suam cum instrumento sursum, totum illud secundum quantitatem quae praeparatur ei, donec egrediatur.	However, what the doctor introduces gently is better: because of his knowledge of the place of the attached thing: and he pushes from below, or pulls with his hand and instrument upwards, all that according to the quantity prepared for him, until it comes out.
Â¶ De extractione Sanguisugae.	On the extraction of leeches.
Caput XXXIX.	Chapter 39.
Quando medicatur sanguisuga cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex curatione cum medicinis, et non confert, tunc considera in gutture infirmi coram sole, siue apud solem postquam premis linguam eius cum instrumento quod narraui tibi.	When a leech is treated with what I said earlier in the section on cures with medicines, and it does not work, then consider the throat of the weak patient in front of the sun, or towards the sun after you have pressed his tongue with an instrument as I described to you.
Si ergo cadit uisus tuus super sanguisugam, extrahe eam cum uncino paruo, aut cum gesti subtilibus decenter.	If therefore your vision falls upon the blood vessel, extract it with a small hook or with delicate fingers from below.
Quod si non est possibile cum eis: tunc accipe cannulam concauam, et intromitte eam in guttur infirmi usque prope guttur: deinde intromitte in concauitatem cannulae ferrum ignitum cum igne.	What if it is not possible with these: then take a concave cannula, and insert it into the throat of the injured person up to the throat: then insert the iron rod heated with fire into the concavity of the cannula.
Fac illud multotiens: et abstineat infirmus ab aqua tota die.	Do that many times: and let the injured person abstain from water for a whole day.
Deinde accipiat uitreatam plenam aqua frigida, et aperiat os eius in ea: et colluat os suum cum ea, et non deglutiat ex ea aliquid: et moueat aquam una hora post aliam cum manu sua.	Then let him take a full treatment of cold water, and open his mouth in it: and let him wash his mouth with it, and not swallow anything from it: and move the water one hour after another with his hand.
Sanguisuga enim ilico cum sentit aquam cadit.	For the blood vessel falls out when it feels the water.
Si autem non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc suffumiga infirmum cum cimicibus, aut cum asa cum instrumento quod narraui in suffumigatione uuulae.	If it does not come out with what we have narrated, then fumigate the injured person with bug-losses, or with a bean-like instrument which I described in the fumigation of the ulcer.
Fac illud multotiens, quoniam ipsa cadet.	Do that many times, until it falls out.
Et modus operationis in suffumigatione est, ut accipias ollam, in qua sint prunae uiuae cum igne: et olla sit cooperta cum coopertorio, in cuius medio sit foramen: et componatur in illo foramine extremitas instrumenti.	And the method of operation in fumigation is, that you take a pot, in which there are burning prunes with fire: and the pot is covered with a lid, in the middle of which there is an opening: and the extremity of the instrument is arranged in that opening.
Deinde proiice suffumigationem, et ponat infirmus os suum in extremitate cannulae, et claudat os suum, ut non egrediatur suffumigatio, donec scias quod suffumigatio iam peruenit ad sanguisugam.	Then apply the fumigation, and let the injured person put his mouth at the extremity of the cannula, and close his mouth, so that the fumigation does not escape, until he knows that the fumigation has already reached the blood vessel.
Nam sanguisuga statim cadet.	For the blood vessel will immediately fall out.
Quod si non cadit, tunc itera suffumigationem multotiens.	If it does not fall out, then repeat the fumigation many times.
Et toleret infirmus sitim, et comedat salsa, et allia, et non bibat aquam.	And let the injured person endure hunger, and eat salty things, and garlic, and not drink water.
Necesse est ergo ut egrediatur cum hoc regimine.	It is necessary therefore that it falls out with this regimen.
Et haec est forma instrumenti cum quo extrahitur sanguisuga ex gutture, quando cadit super ipsam uisus.	And this is the form of the instrument with which a blood-sucking worm is extracted from the throat, when it falls upon it with force.
Est simile forcipibus, sicut uides: nisi quia est ei haee curuitas quae intromittitur ad guttur.	It is similar to forceps, as you see: except that it has this curvature which is introduced into the throat.
Et extremitas eius similis ori auis quae nominatur ciconia, in quo est asperitas limae: quando comprehendit aliquid, non dimittit ipsum omnino.	And its extremity is similar to the beak of a bird called a stork, in which there is roughness of a file: when it grasps something, it does not release it at all.
Â¶ De apertione Apostematum, et eorum sectione, et cura in genere.	On the opening of abscesses, and their section, and treatment in general.
Caput XL.	Chapter 40.
Apostematum species sunt multae, multorum modorum, secundum quod uenit rememoratio eorum, scilicet unius, et unius in hoc libro: et sunt diuersae in perforatione eorum, et sectione ipsorum ex duobus modis.	There are many species of abscesses, of many modes, according to what comes to mind about them, namely one, and one in this book: and they differ in their perforation and sectioning, which is from two modes.
Quorum unus est ex specie apostematis in seipso, et eo quod comprehendit ex humiditatibus.	Of which one is of the species of abscesses in itself, and that which it comprehends from humidity.
Et modus secundus est propter loca, in quibus accidit ex corpore.	And the second mode is due to locations, in which it happens from the body.
Quoniam apostema accidens in capite, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in ano: et apostema accidens in loco carnoso, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in iuncturis: et unicuique eorum est iudicium suum ex operatione.	Because an abscess occurring in the head is different from an abscess occurring in the anus: and an abscess occurring in a fleshy place is different from an abscess occurring in a joint: and each of them has its own judgment from the operation.
Et ex apostematibus sunt quae non oportet ut perforentur, nisi post maturationem saniei in eis, et complementum eius: et ex eis sunt, quae oportet ut perforentur, dum sunt cruda, et non maturantur secundum complementum.	And among the abscesses there are those that should not be perforated unless after the maturation of the pus in them, and its completion: and among them there are those that should be perforated while they are raw, and do not mature according to their completion.
Sicut apostemata quae sunt propinqua iuncturis.	Like abscesses which are near the joints.
Quoniam apostema quando accidit prope iuncturam, et prolongatur esse eius, donec putrefit quod est in circumitu eius fortasse corrumpuntur ligamenta, aut nerui illius iuncturae: quare est caussa propior contractionis illius membri.	Because when an abscess occurs near a joint and prolongs its being until it putrefies what is around it, perhaps the ligaments or nerves of that joint may be corrupted: which is the cause of a prior contraction of that limb.
Aut est apostema apud membrum principale: quoniam si tu tardas perforationem eius, donec maturetur, nocebit uel illi, uel per illud membro principali.	Or it is an abscess near a principal member: because if you delay the perforation of it until it matures, it will harm either that member or through that principal member.
Aut est prope anum, perfora ergo ipsum immaturum: et non oportet, ut perfores, apostema crudum, non completae digestionis, nisi quod est prope anum, ut non putrefiat profundum, et longetur ad interiora ani, et fiat fistula, aut fiat in termino eius quod non sanatur.	It is near the anus, so perforate it when it is immature: and it is not fitting to make a perforation, lest an unripe apostema should putrefy, unless it is near the anus, so that it does not putrefy deeply, and it reaches to the interior of the intestine, and it becomes a fistula, or it becomes in its terminus which does not heal.
Oportet ut scias horam perforationis apostematis, quod maturatum est secundum complementum: et est apud sedationem doloris, recessionem febris, et diminutionem rubedinis, et pulsationis, et acuitatem capitis apostematis: et reliqua signa.	It is fitting to know the time of perforation of the apostema, which has matured according to its complement: and it is at the sedation of pain, recession of fever, and diminution of redness, and pulsation, and acuteness of the head of the apostema: and the remaining signs.
Et oportet, ut facias eandem perforationem in inferiori loco apostematis, et uehementioris eminentiae: et sit perforatio uadens in longitudine corporis, si apostemata sunt in partibus manuum et pedum, et locis lacertorum, et chordarum, et neruorum, et arteriarum, et ad ultimum in omnibus locis aequalibus, quibus non est reflexio.	And it is fitting to make the perforation in the inferior place of the apostema, and of the more prominent elevation: and let the perforation be made in the length of the body, if the apostemata are in the parts of the hands and feet, and in the places of the muscles, and tendons, and nerves, and arteries, and finally in all equal places where there is no reflexion.
In illis autem quae reflectuntur, uade cum perforatione secundum illud membrum.	But in those that are reflected, let the perforation be made with the membrane according to that member.
Quando uero apostema est in locis carnosis: tunc melius est ut dimittas perforationem eius, donec confirmetur eius digestio, sicut diximus secundum complementum.	When indeed the apostema is in fleshy places: then it is better to delay its perforation until its digestion is confirmed, just as we said according to its complement.
Quoniam si tu perforas ipsum ante illud, prolongatur cursus uirus ex eo, et est multae sordis et sordiciei, et fortasse indurantur labia eius, et profunditas eius.	Because if you perforate it before that, the course of the virus is prolonged from it, and there are many filths and foulnesses, and perhaps its lips become hardened, and its depth.
Et quaedam apostemata perforantur secundum latitudinem corporis apud necessitatem: aut secundum illud quo indiget membrum.	And some apostemata are perforated according to the width of the body in case of necessity: or according to that member which needs it.
Et oportet, ut administres in apostematibus paruis perforationem paruam, et in apostematibus magnis perforationem amplam: aut sectiones multas per similitudinem magnitudinis apostematis.	And it is fitting to administer a small perforation in small apostemata, and a large perforation in large apostemata: or many sections according to the similarity of the magnitude of the apostema.
Et sunt ex apostematibus, in quibus oportet ut concauetur cutis: et incidatur quando iam facta est sicut pannus, et facta est in termino, quod iam mortua est: sicut illud quod accidit in multis, ut dubelet, et bubonibus.	And there are those among the apostemata, in which it is fitting to sew up the skin: and an incision should be made when it has already become like a pannus, and it has been made at the terminus, which has already died: just as that which happens in many cases, such as dubellae and buboes.
Et ex eis sunt quae secantur sectione habente tres angulos.	And of these are those which are cut with a section having three angles.
Et ex eis est, ex quo inciditur sicut figura folii myrti.	And of these is one, from which an incision is made as the figure of a myrtle leaf.
Sicut apostema inguinum.	Like a groin abscess.
Et ex eis sunt in quibus administratur sectio rotunda, et sectio lunaris: et similes eis ex sectionibus.	And of these are those in which a round incision is administered, and a lunar incision; and similar ones from these incisions.
Illud uero cui non est caput, sicut sunt apostemata lenia superficialia, oportet ut perfores ipsum perforatione superficiali, uel plana tantum.	That one indeed which has no head, like superficial lenient abscesses, it is necessary to perforate them with a superficial perforation, or only with a flat one.
Et oportet, quando apostema est grossum, et iam collegit saniem multam, et perforas ipsum, ut non properes et extrahas pus totum in illa hora: imo extrahe ex ipso partem eius.	And it is necessary, when the abscess is large and has already collected a great deal of pus, and you perforate it, that you do not press too hard and extract all the pus at that time; rather extract from the same part itself.
Deinde opila apostema usque ad diem alium.	Then apply a poultice to the abscess until another day.
Deinde extrahe quiddam ex pus iterum.	Then extract something from the pus again.
Fac illud multotiens secundum gradationem, donec egrediatur: praecipue si infirmus est debilis uirtutis, aut mulier praegnans, aut puer paruus, aur senex decrepitus: spiritus enim animalis ab animali multotiens resoluitur cum egressione saniei: et fortasse moritur infirmus, et tu non percipis.	Do that many times according to the gradation, until it goes out: especially if the patient is weak in strength, or a pregnant woman, or a small child, or an old decrepit person: for the animal spirit is often resolved with the egression of sanies: and perhaps the weak person will die, and you do not perceive.
Caue ergo hoc capitulum cautela magna.	Therefore this chapter requires great caution.
Et post perforationem tuam, qua ista perforas apostemata, oportet ut abstergas uulnus: et considera.	And after your perforation, by which you perforate the abscesses, it is necessary to clean the wound: and consider.
Si ergo est uulnus apostematis paruum, aut est sectio plana, tunc administra licinia ex lino, aut coto antiquo.	If therefore the wound of the abscess is small, or it is a flat section, then administer a dressing made of linen, or an old cloth.
Et si est apostema magnum, et fissurae perforationis multae sunt, oportet tunc ut intromittas in omnem fissuram licinium, donec perueniant adinuicem.	And if it is a large abscess, and there are many perforations with fissures, then it is necessary to introduce a dressing into every fissure, until they reach the adjoining skin.
Et si in apostemate abscidisti partem cutis, aut in circumitu concauasti eam: tunc oportet ut impleas eam coto ueteri, aut sicut quando texitur pannus, aut raditur lanugine lini absque humiditate: et stringe ipsum usque ad tertium diem.	And if you have cut away a part of the skin in the abscess, or concavely hollowed it out around it: then it is necessary to fill it with an old cloth, or as when a fabric is woven, or padded with a layer of linen without moisture: and bind it up until the third day.
Deinde proiice ipsum, et cura illud cum eo quod oportet ex unguento, donec sanetur.	Then apply it, and take care of that with what is suitable from the ointment, until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis in hora tuae operationis, tunc administra aquam frigidam, et acetum, postquam imbibitur in eis pannus: et ponis ipsum super locum fluxus sanguinis multotiens.	But if a flow of blood occurs during your operation, then administer cold water and vinegar, after it has been soaked in those rags; and apply it many times to the place of the flow of blood.
Si autem perseuerat fluxus sanguinis, tunc oportet ut administres regimen, et curationem, et pulueres, quae narraui in locis multis huius nostri libri, et ex diuisione.	But if the flow of blood persists, then it is necessary to administer a regimen and treatment, and powders, which I described in many places of this our book, and from division.
Si autem est in tempore hyemis, et locus apostematis est multorum neruorum: tunc oportet ut infundas puluillos cum uino, et oleo calidis: et ponas eos super loca.	But if it is in winter time, and the place of the apostema is of many nerves: then it is necessary to soak poultices with wine, and warm oil; and apply them to the places.
Et si fuerit in aestate, et loca sunt carnosa: tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos imbibitos in aqua, et oleo, aut eum uino et oleo, et totum illud frigidum.	And if it is in summer, and the places are fleshy: then it is necessary to apply poultices soaked in water, and oil, or with wine and oil, and all that is cold.
Donec quando erit dies tertius, sicut diximus, tunc oportet ut soluas apostema, et abstergas ipsum, et administres in curatione eius quod ei conuenit, donec sanetur.	Until when it will be the third day, as we said, then it is necessary to dissolve the apostema, and wipe it away, and administer in its treatment what is suitable for it, until it heals.
Hoc est ergo quod necessarium est ex cognitione curationis apostematum uniuersaliter.	This is therefore what is necessary from the knowledge of treating apostema universally.
Secundum semitam uero distinctionis, iam dixi de omni apostemate, qualiter est uia ad curationem eius capitulatim singulariter.	According to the path of distinction, I have already spoken about every apostema, and how it is a way to its treatment, chapter by chapter, individually.
Â¶ De sectione apostematum quae accidunt in cute capitis.	Of the apostema that occur on the skin of the head.
Caput XLI.	Head 41.
Accidunt in cute capitis apostemata parua, et sunt ex speciebus Nodorum, quos continent tunicae, quae sunt eis sacci: quasi ipsa sint hausolati gallinae.	There occur on the skin of the head small apostema, and they are from the species of Knots, which are contained in tunics, which are like sacs: as if they were hollowed out by a hen's beak.
Et ipsorum species sunt multae.	And there are many species of them.
Ex eis sunt pingues: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditatem similem limo: et ex eis quae continent humiditatem similem frisatis et pultibus: et eis similibus, et ex eis sunt, quae sunt lapidea dura.	Some of them are fatty; and some contain moisture similar to slime; and some contain moisture similar to frost and pus; and those similar, and some are hard and stony.
Et in sectione omnium, et ipsorum extractione non est timor, dum apud ipsorum sectionem non facit contrarietatem arteria.	And in the cutting of all and their extraction, there is no fear, as long as the artery does not make a contradictory incision at the site of the cut.
Et operatio in sectione eorum est, ut experiaris ea cum instrumento, cuius forma uenit post haec, quod nominatur Intromissum, donec scias quid contineat.	And the operation in their cutting is such that you should experience it with an instrument, whose form is presented afterwards, which is called Intromissum, until you know what it contains.
Nam si est illud quod continet humiditas, tunc seca ipsum sectione secundum longitudinem sectione superficiali: secundum hanc formam.	For if there is that which contains moisture, then dry it with a sectional incision along the length of the superficial section: according to this form.
Et incipe cum sectione ex linea b. ad lineam, g. Cum ergo euacuatur humiditas, tunc excoria kistin quae continet illam humiditatem, et non dimittas ex ea aliquid penitus.	And begin with the incision from line b to line g. When therefore the moisture is evacuated, then scrape out the cyst which contains that moisture, and do not allow anything to penetrate deeply from it.
Multotiens enim redit, si remanet ex ea aliquid.	For it often returns, if something remains from it.
Deinde submerge cotum in unguento aegyptio, si est praesens: et si non, in aqua et sale: et imple cum eo uulnus, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then soak the wound in Egyptian unguent, if it is available: and if not, in water and salt: and fill with it a dressing, and leave it until another day.
Ipsum enim corrodet quod remansit ex kisti.	For it corrodes what remains of the cyst.
Deinde itera super ipsum cotum cum aegyptio secundo, et tertio, et si indiges illo, donec confidas quia non remanserit ex kisti aliquid, tunc enim cura uulnus cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then apply the Egyptian unguent to the wound a second and third time, and if you are uneasy about it, until you are confident that nothing remains of the cyst, then treat the wound with an ointment, until it is healed.
Quod si apostema continet nodum pinguem: tunc seca ipsum secundum hanc formam, sectione habente formam crucis: et proiice uncinos inter duolabia sectionis, et excoria ipsum ab omni parte: et conare uirtutem tuam in extractione tunicae quae continet ipsum.	What if the aposteme contains a fatty node: then dry it according to this form, with an incision having the shape of a cross: and insert a hook between the two labia of the incision, and scrape it out from every part: and strive to extract the tunics that contain it.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi arteria, tunc fac illud quod narrabo tibi post.	If, however, the artery makes a contradictory incision for you, then do what I will tell you afterwards.
Et similiter fac in apostemate, si est lapideum, ex sectione, et curatione eadem, secundum quod diximus.	And similarly, act on the aposteme if it is stony, from the incision and the same treatment, according to what we have said.
Et sectio super apostema lapideum est facilior: quoniam est pauci sanguinis et humiditatis.	And the incision above the stony aposteme is easier: because it has little blood and moisture.
Et quandoque sunt quaedam horum apostematum quae sunt in capite in quibusdam hominibus, cum quibus penitus non est humiditas.	And sometimes there are certain abscesses that are on the head in certain men, with which there is no deep humidity.
Quod est: quia ego secui super apostema in capite mulieris uetulae, et inueni apostema sicut lapis solidus et durus, asper, albus, qui non poterat frangi: et si percuteretur cum eo aliquis proiiciendo, uulnerat ipsum.	This is because I cut above an abscess on the head of a little old woman, and I found the abscess to be like a hard and solid stone, rough, white, which could not be broken: and if someone were to strike it with a projecting point, they would wound themselves.
In aliis uero apostematibus accidentibus in capite, praeter haec scilicet apostemata quae accidunt in capitibus puerorum, et apud radices aurium, sectio eorum omnium sit sectio superficialis.	In other abscesses occurring on the head, apart from these, namely those abscesses that occur on the heads of children and at the roots of the ears, the section of all of them should be a superficial section.
Vel pone perforationem eorum semper ab inferiori parte eorum, ut alleuietur cursus saniei ad inferiora.	Or make a perforation of them always from the lower part of them, so that the flow of sanies may be directed towards the lower parts.
Deinde cura ea cum eo quod conuenit eis ex curatione.	Then treat them with what is suitable for them according to their treatment.
Â¶ De sectione Strophularum in collo.	Of the section of Scrofulous swellings on the neck.
Caput XLII.	Chapter 42.
Multotiens acccidunt ista apostemata in collo, et sub assellis, et inguinibus: et quandoque accidunt in reliquo corpore.	These abscesses often occur on the neck, and under the arm-pits, and in the groin areas: and sometimes they occur in other parts of the body.
Et super illa quae ex eis accidunt in collo, sunt unum, et multa: et generantur ab inuicem: et omnis Strophula ex eis est intra tunicam propriam ei, sicut est in nodis et apostematibus capitis, sicut narrauimus.	And above those which occur on the neck, there are one and many: and they are produced by a humour: and every Scrofula arising from them is under its own tunic, just as it is in knots and abscesses of the head, as we have narrated.
Et species harum Strophularum sunt multae.	And there are many kinds of these Scrofulous swellings.
Et ex eis enim sunt lapideae: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates: et ex eis sunt malignae, quae non obediunt curationi.	And among them there are stony ones: and among them there are those that contain humidity: and among them there are malignant ones, which do not respond to treatment.
In illa ergo quam ex eis uides bonae dispositionis in tactu, cuius manifestum est propinquum colori cutis, et mouetur ad omnem partem, et non est annexa cum neruis colli, neque cum guidegi, neque cum arteria, neque est profunda: oportet ut seces eam sectione superficiali a superiori parte ad inferiorem partem corporis ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. et excoria eam ab omni parte: et extende duo labia cutis cum uncino, aut cum uncinis multis, si indiges illo, sicut diximus in apostematibus capitis, et extrahe eam paulatim.	Therefore, in those that you find to be of good disposition on palpation, whose manifest colour is close to the colour of the skin, and moves towards every part, and is not attached to the nerves of the neck, nor to the glands, nor to the arteries, nor is it deep: it is necessary to separate it by a superficial section from the upper part to the lower part of the body in a line, b. to a line, g., and to excise it from every part: and extend the two lips of the skin with a hook, or with many hooks, if you need it, just as we said in the case of abscesses on the head, and extract it gradually.
Et est super cautelam, ut non incidatur uena, aut neruus.	And it is above the caution, so that a vein or nerve is not injured.
Et sit spatumile non acutum ualde: ut non addat tibi manum tuam cum incisione, aut inquietet infirmum, et incidas quod non est necesse.	And let the instrument be not sharp-pointed, so that it does not add to your hand with an incision, or disturb the weak part, and cut what is not necessary.
Si autem incidis uenam, aut arteriam, aut prohibet te ab operatione, tunc pone in uulnus zegi tritum, aut quosdam pulueres qui abscindunt sanguinem, et stringe uulnus, et dimitte ipsum, donec quiescat acuitas apostematis, et mollificetur uulnus: uel incipit et uult putrefieri.	If you have cut a vein, or an artery, or it prevents you from operating, then apply to the wound some crushed garlic, or certain powders that staunch blood, and bind the wound, and leave it until the acute pain subsides, and the wound softens: or it begins to suppurate.
Nam sanguis abscinditur tuncia Redi ergo ad operationem tuam, donec compleas.	For blood is staunched by the tunic of Redi, therefore return to your operation, until you complete it.
Deinde inquire digito tuo indice, si remansit aliquid ex Strophulis aliis paruis: ergo incide eas, et munda eas.	Then probe with your index finger, if anything remains from the small Strophuli: therefore cut them, and clean them.
Quod si est in radice Strophulae uena magna: tunc oportet ut non incidas illam Strophulam ex radice sua: imo oportet ut liges eam cum filo duplato forti, et dimittas eam donec cadat per se absque nocumento.	What if there is a large vein in the root of the Strophula: then it is necessary that you do not cut that Strophula at its root: rather it is necessary to tie it with a double thread, and leave it until it falls off by itself without harm.
Deinde imple uulnus coto ueteri, quod iam submersisti in unguento aegyptio.	Then fill the wound with old cotton, which you had already soaked in Egyptian unguent.
Deinde cura ipsum.	Then treat it.
Si inciditur Strophula tota, tunc oportet ut aggreges labia duo uulneris: et suas ipsum statim, postquam uides quia prorsus non remansit superfluitas.	If the entire Strophula is cut, then it is necessary to bring together the two lips of the wound: and adjust them immediately, after you see that there remains no excess.
Si autem uides quod remansit superfluitas propter magnitudinem Strophulae, tunc oportet ut intendas ad incidendam radicem eius, et extrahendam eam: et administra suturam quam diximus.	If you see that there remains an excess because of the size of the Strophula, then it is necessary to proceed to cut its root, and extract it: and administer the suture as we have said.
Et quae ex Strophulis continet humiditates, perfora illam perforatione superficiali: ut appareat tibi locus maturitatis eius: et pone perforationem ab eo quod sequitur inferius corporis, sicut diximus.	And what contains moisture from the Strophuli, pierce it with a superficial piercing: so that you see the place of its maturity: and put the piercing below the following part of the body, as we have said.
Deinde administra post perforationem licinia cum unguento, et similia eis, ut corrodat quod remansit ex corruptione, donec quando uides uulnus iam mundatum esse: tunc cura ipsum cum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then administer a linctus with ointment, and similar things, so that it corrodes what remains from the corruption, until you see the wound is now clean: then treat it with a generating ointment of flesh, until it heals.
Â¶ De sectione Epiglotis ab apostemate intra guttur accidente.	About the section of the epiglottis affected by an abscess that occurs within the throat.
Caput XLIII.	Chapter 43.
Dixerunt antiqui hanc sectionem in Epigloti, et non uidi aliquem in terra nostra, qui eam fecerit: et haec est scriptura sermonis eorum.	The ancients spoke of this section of the epiglottis, and I have not seen anyone in our land who has performed it: and this is the writing of their speech.
In habentibus autem synanchiam, oportet ut deuitetur sectio Epiglotis: cum non fiat iuuamentum per illud: propterea, quod omnes uenae et pulmo sunt infirmi.	However, in those having a severe cough, it is necessary to avoid the section of the epiglottis: since no benefit is made through that: because all the veins and lungs are weak.
In illis uero qui habent apostema calidum in ore, aut gutture, aut duabus amigdalis, quando non est aegritudo in cannali, oportet uti sectione Epiglotis, ad fugiendum ex perditione quae fit ex praefocatione.	In those indeed who have a hot abscess in the mouth, or throat, or tonsils, when there is no disease in the canal, it is necessary to use the section of the epiglottis, to flee from the destruction which is made by suffocation.
Oportet ergo quando uolumus illud, ut secemus Epiglotim sub tribus circulis Epiglotis, aut quatuor, sectione parua per latitudinem, in eo quod est inter duos circulos per quantitatem, quod sit sectio in sifac, non in cartilagine: et iste quidem locus est conueniens sectioni, quoniam est priuatus carne, et uasa sanguinis ab eo sunt longinqua.	Therefore it is necessary when we want to do that, to cut the epiglottis under three or four circular folds of the epiglottis, making a small section in width, in what is between two circles in quantity, so that the section is in the sifa, not in the cartilage: and this place is suitable for the section, because it is deprived of flesh, and the vessels of blood are far away from it.
Quod si medicator est timidus, tunc oportet ut extendat cutem gutturis cum uncino.	If the doctor is timid, then it is necessary to stretch the skin of the throat with a hook.
Deinde findat cutem, donec quando peruenit ad cannalem: deuitet uas sanguinis, si uidet ex eis aliquid.	Then he should probe the skin until he reaches the canal: he should avoid the blood vessels, if he sees anything from them.
Deinde secet sifac quod narrauimus: et significatur super sectionem cannalis ex phlegmate quod egreditur ex ea, cum eo quod disrumpitur, et abscisione uocis.	Then he should cut the sifa which we have described: and it is marked above the section of the canal by the phlegm that comes out of it, with what is disrupted, and the separation of the voice.
Et dimitte uulnus apertum tempore aliquo.	And leave the wound open for a certain period of time.
Cum ergo remouetur hora in qua timetur praefocatio, aggrega duo labia uulneris cutis, et sue ipsam solam absque cartilagine.	When therefore the hour arrives at which the prefabrication is feared, bring together the two lips of the wound's skin, and sew it up itself without cartilage.
Deinde administra medicinas quae faciunt nasci carnem, usquequo sanetur.	Then administer medications that promote the growth of flesh, until it is healed.
Inquit Albucasis.	Said Albucasis.
Summa huius sermonis quem narrauimus, expositio non est, nisi quando uident, quod aliquod horum apostematum iam opilauit guttur infirmi: et sublimatus est infirmus super mortem, et uult intersecari anhelitus eius: uadunt ad secandum Epiglotim, ut respiret infirmus super locum uulneris quadam respiratione, et saluetur a morte: et propter hoc praeceperunt dimittere uulnus apertum, donec consumatur malicia aegritudinis, et est malicia eius tribus diebus, et quasi ipsa: tunc ergo praecaeperunt suere uulnus, et curare ipsum, donec sanetur.	The sum of this sermon which we have narrated is not an exposition, unless when they see that some of these apostemes had already putrefied in the throat of the infirm: and the infirm was elevated above death, and wished to intercept his breath; they wanted to dissect the Epiglottis, so that the infirm might breathe over the place of the wound with a certain respiration, and be saved from death: and for this reason they ordered to leave the wound open, until the evil of the disease was consumed, and it was an evil of three days, and almost itself; then therefore they ordered to sew up the wound, and to cure it, until it was healed.
Et illud quod uidi per me ipsum est, quod una ancilla accaepit cultellum, et misit cum in guttur suum, et incidit cum eo partem cannalis pulmonis.	And that which I saw through myself is, that a certain maid grasped a knife, and sent it into her throat, and struck with it a part of the pulmonary canal.
Et uocatus sum ad curationem eius, et inueni eam mugire, sicut est mugitus mortui.	And I was called to her cure, and I found her groaning, as is the groaning of the dead.
Detexi ergo a uulnere, et inueni sanguinem qui egressus fuerat ex uulnere paruum.	I examined therefore the wound, and I found blood which had flowed out from the small wound.
Confisus ergo sum, quod ipsa non absciderat uenam, neque guidegi: et uentus egrediebatur ex uulnere.	I was confused therefore, because she had not severed a vein, nor an artery: and air was escaping from the wound.
Properaui ergo, et sui uulnus, et curaui ipsum, donec sanum est: et non accidit ancillae aliquid, nisi raucedo in uoce: et rediit post dies ad meliorem dispositionum suarum.	I treated it therefore, and sewed up the wound, and cured it, until it was healthy: and nothing happened to the maid, except hoarseness in her voice: and she returned after days to a better disposition of hers.
Hinc ergo dico: quod in sectione Epiglotis non est timor.	Therefore I say: that in the incision of the Epiglottis there is no fear.
Â¶ De sectione Herniae gutturis.	On the surgical incision of the hernia in the throat.
Caput XLIIII.	Chapter 44.
Hoc Apostema nominatum Hernia gutturis, est apostema magnum, secundum colorem corporis: et est in mulieribus multum.	This abscess is called a hernia of the throat, it is a large abscess, according to the color of the body, and it is common in women.
Et est secundum duos modos: aut enim est naturale: aut est accidentale.	And it is according to two modes: either it is natural or it is accidental.
In naturali certe non est ingenium.	In the natural one, certainly there is no ingenuity.
Accidentale uero est secundum duos modos: quorum unus est similis nodis pinguibus.	The accidental one is indeed according to two modes: of which one is similar to fatty knots.
Et modus alter, est similis apostemati quod fit ex nodatione arteriae.	And the other mode is similar to an abscess that occurs from the thickening of the artery.
Et in ipso est timor, et non oportet ut praesumptio fiat ad ipsum cum ferro, nisi in eo quod est paruum: et tu proba ipsum, et inuestiga ipsum cum Intromisso.	And there is fear in it, and it is not fitting to make a incision into it with an iron instrument, unless it is small; and you should test it, and examine it with a probe.
Si ergo inuenis ipsum simile nodo pingui, et non est suspensum cum aliqua uenarum: tunc seca ipsum, sicut secantur nodi: et extrahe ipsum cum eo quod continet ex kisti, si est in kisti: et si non, tunc perscrutare totum eius.	If you find it similar to a fatty knot, and it is not swollen with any veins: then cut it off, just as knots are cut off: and extract it with what it contains from the sac, if it is in a sac: and if not, then probe the entire area.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod oportet ex curatione, donec sanetur.	Then treat the area with what is necessary for healing, until it is healthy.
Â¶ De sectione super species Nodorum.	On the surgical incision of various kinds of knots.
Caput XLV.	Chapter 45.
Nodorum multae sunt species, et ego iam dixi omnes species eorum in diuisione: et oportet ut narrem hic differentiam inter Nodum, et Exituram: cum sit dubitationem faciens.	There are many kinds of knots, and I have already described all their kinds in the division: and it is necessary to relate here the difference between a Knot and an Exitus, since there is a doubt that causes confusion.
Dico ergo, quod cum Exitura est caliditas, et febris, et dolores uehementes, donec sedatur ebullitio superfluitatis, et completur putrefactio: tunc enim quiescunt febris et calor.	I say therefore, that since an Exitus is characterized by heat, and fever, and vehement pains, until the boiling of the surplus is suppressed, and the putrefaction is completed: then indeed the fever and heat cease.
Cum Nodo uero non est caliditas, neque febris, neque dolores, et continet eos kistis sifachin, qui est eis saccus proprius, et est secundum colorem corporis: et est incaeptio eorum sicut cicer, et fit sicut batecha, et maior et minor.	But with a Knot, there is no heat, nor fever, nor pains, and it contains those sacs of sifachin, which are their own proper sacs, and they are according to the color of the body: and they are taken in like a seed, and become like a bubble, and they are greater and lesser.
Et sunt secundum duas species: aut pingues: aut continent humiditatem.	And there are two kinds according to whether they are fat or contain moisture.
Et colores humiditatis sunt multi, secundum quod dixi in diuisione.	And the colors of moisture are many, according as I said in the division.
Oportet ergo, quando peruenis ad curationem Nodi, ut experiaris eum, et inquiras ipsum in primis cum instrumento quod nominatur Intromissum, secundum quod ueniet forma eius in capitulo quod est post hoc.	It is necessary, therefore, when you come to the cure of a Node, that you should try it and examine it first with an instrument which is called Intruded, according as its form will be described in the chapter which is after this.
Et modus inquisitionis apostematum, et Nodorum omnium est, ut accipias hoc instrumentum, et intromittas ipsum in humidiorem locum, quem inuenis in apostemate: et tu reuolue digitos tuos cum eo paulatim, donec scias quod instrumentum iam penetrauit cutem.	And the method of examining abscesses and all nodes is that you should take this instrument and insert it into a moist place which you find in the abscess: and you should slowly rotate your fingers with it until you know that the instrument has already penetrated the skin.
Deinde ultima manum tuam secundum mensuram magnitudinis apostematis.	Then you should finally put your hand according to the measurement of the size of the abscess.
Deinde extrahe Intromissum, et considera illud quod egrediur in uestigio eius.	Then extract the Intruded instrument, and consider that which comes out in its track.
Si ergo egreditur humiditas currens, quicunque color sit: tunc seca ipsum sectione superficiali, secundum quod dixi in reliquis apostematibus.	If therefore a flowing moisture comes out, whatever the color may be: then dry it with a superficial incision, according as I said about the remaining abscesses.
Et si non egreditur humiditas in uestigio Intromissi, tunc scias quia est pinguis: seca ergo super ipsum sectione habente formam crucis, secundum formam hanc, sicut docui te: et suspende ipsum cum uncinis, et excoria cutem ab omni parte cum facilitate: et custodi kistin si potes super illud, ut extrahas ipsam sanam cum Nodo.	And if a moisture does not come out in the track of the Intruded instrument, then know that it is fat: therefore dry over it with an incision having the form of a cross, according to this form, as I taught you: and suspend it with hooks, and excoriate the skin from every part with ease: and keep it still if you can over it, so that you may extract the healthy tissue with the Node.
Si autem disrumpitur kistis apud operationem, et non est possibile extrahere ipsam sanam, multotiens enim accidit illud, tunc extrahe ipsam frustatim, donec non remaneat ex ea aliquid.	If however the stillness is disrupted during the operation, and it is not possible to extract the healthy tissue, for this often happens, then extract it fragment by fragment, until nothing remains of it.
Nam si remanet ex ea aliquid parum, aut multum, redit Nodus secundum plurimum.	For if a little or much of it remains, the Node returns according to its fullness.
Quod si uincit te, et remanet ex eo parum: tunc imple uulnus apud completionem tuam, quibusdam pulueribus corrosiuis acutis: et stringe uulnus, et pone supra ipsum quod sedet apostema calidum, et cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	If it defeats you and a little of it remains: then fill the wound at its completion with certain corrosive powders: and bind the wound, and put above it what sits as a warm abscess, and treat it with remaining cures, until it is healed.
Si ergo est Nodus magnus, tunc sue duo labia eius, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat.	If therefore there is a large knot, then sew up its two lips, and cure it with that which makes flesh.
Si autem est tibi contraria uena pulsatilis, aut non pulsatilis: tunc propera, et imple locum zegi trito, et dimitte ipsum strictum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec putrefiat uulnus, et quiescat ebullitio sanguinis: deinde redi ad incidendum illud quod remansit ex Nodo.	If however there is a pulsating vein opposite you, or not pulsating: then prepare, and fill the place of the wound with a triple dressing, and leave it tightly bound for two days, or three, until the wound putrefies, and the ebullition of blood ceases: then return to cut open what remains of the Node.
Â¶ De foris instrumentorum pro sectione et perforatione.	Concerning the forms of instruments for cutting and piercing.
Caput XLVI.	Chapter 46.
EX Eis sunt formae Intromissorum, et sunt trium specierum.	These are the forms of Instruments for Introduction, and they are of three kinds.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et ex eis est medium, et ex eis est paruum.	For there is a large one among them, and there is a medium one among them, and there is a small one among them.
Fiant ex ferro alfulud quadratarum extremitatum decenter, ut festinent introitum in apostemate.	They are made from iron, with a square, quadrated extremity, so that they may firmly enter into the abscess.
Et istae sunt formae Experientium, et no, id est, perforantia: et unum eorum nominatur beris, idest, peforans: et sunt trium specierum.	And these are the forms of Probing Instruments, and yes, that is, piercing ones: and one of them is called a needle, that is, a perforator: and they are of three kinds.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et medium, et paruum.	For there is a large one among them, and a medium one, and a small one.
Conueniunt, ut inuestigentur per ea apostemata, et exiturae, et fistulae, et bubones ab eo quod inter ea est ex ossibus.	They are suitable for investigating through these abscesses, and ulcers, and fistulas, and buboes from that which is among them, from the bones.
Et aliis fiunt rotunda, tersa, lenia, sicut acus magnae quibus subsellia suuntur, ex citrino scilicet, aut ex aere, aut ferro, aut argento.	And others are made round, smooth, slender, like large needles to which handles are attached, namely from citrine, or from copper, or iron, or silver.
Et meliora eorum sunt quae fiunt ex citrino.	And the better ones among them are those that are made from citrine.
Et fiunt Experientia etiam de plumbo nigro, quae conueniunt ut per ea experiantur fistulae, quarum concauitate sunt reflexiones, ut reflectantur cum lenitate sua cum illis reflexionibus.	And they are made from black lead, which are suitable for probing fistulas, the concavities of which are reflections, so that they may reflect with their own gentleness along with those reflections.
Et sunt iterum trium specierum.	And they are again of three kinds.
Quoniam ex eis sunt longa, ex eis media, et ex eis breuia, secundum quantitatem amplitudinis fistulae et stricturae eius.	Since there are long ones among them, medium ones, and short ones, according to the quantity of the amplitude of the fistula and its constriction.
Forma Vncinorum, et sunt multarum specierum.	The forms of wounds, and they are of many species.
Quoniam ex eis sunt simplices, scilicet quibus est curuitas una: et sunt trium specierum sicut uides, Magni, Medii, et Parui.	Because some of them are simple, namely those with a single curvature, and they are of three species, as you see, Large, Medium, and Small.
Et ex eis sunt Vncini caeci: et sunt trium specierum.	And some of them are jagged wounds, and they are of three species.
Et ex eis sunt uncini habentes duas curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et ex eis sunt uncini habentes tres curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et omnes isti sunt necessarii in loco suo.	And some of them are wounds having two curvatures, and they are of three species; and some of them are wounds having three curvatures, and they are of three species; and all these are necessary in their place.
Et istae sunt formae Scalpellorum, quibus secantur et excoriantur Nodi, et apostemata: et sunt trium specierum: quoniam ex eis est magnum, medium, et paruum.	And these are the forms of scalpels, with which they cut and scrape away nodes and abscesses; and they are of three species: because some of them is large, medium, and small.
Eorum extremitates quibus fit sectio sunt acutae, extremitates aliae sunt non acutae: et non ponuntur taliter, nisi ut cum eis fiat iuuamentum in excoriatione Nodorum apud timorem incisionis uenae, aut nerui: et ut sanetur per ea infirmus, et inueniat tranquillitatem parumper ex adustione quam inuenit apud excoriationem apostematis.	Their extremities with which the section is made are sharp, other extremities are not sharp; and they are not placed thus, unless so that there may be relief in scraping away nodes with fear of incision into the vein or nerve; and so that the weak part may be healed through them, and may find tranquility for a while from the inflammation it finds at the scraping away of an abscess.
Istae sunt Magda, et sunt specierum trium.	These are forceps, and they are of three species.
Fiunt ex aere, et sunt similia Radio, cum quo fit alcohol: et in extremitate lata est puncta Spatumilis occultata: et in ea currit ad interiora, et ad exteriora quando uis, sicut uides.	They are made of copper, and they are similar to a file, with which an abscess is opened; and on the broad extremity there is a hidden pointed spatula: and it runs inward and outward when desired, as you see.
Forma Spatumilium quae absconduntur inter digitos apud perforationem apostematum: et non percipiunt ea infirmi: et sunt trium specierum, magnum, medium, et paruum.	The forms of spatulas that are hidden between the fingers at the perforation of an abscess; and they do not perceive them as weak; and they are of three species, large, medium, and small.
Fomae Ventosarum cum quibus abscinditur fluxus sanguinis: et sunt trium specierum, magnae, mediae, et paruae.	The forms of bleeders with which the flow of blood is stopped; and they are of three species, large, medium, and small.
Fiant ex aere, aut citrino, rotundae, ad longitudinem parumper, sicut uides: et sint ad subtilitatem.	They are made of copper or brass, round, slightly longer, as you see; and they should be to subtlety.
Et oportet ut sint istae species Ventosarum apud te magnae, et paruae: ut abscindas per eas sanguinem cum uelocitate apud necessitatem, et tunc quando non est tibi praesens medicina.	And it is necessary that these species of blood-letting be great and small with you, so that you may quickly draw out the blood through them in case of necessity, and then when no medicine is present to help you.
Verumtamen non utaris eis in abscisione sanguinis in omni loco corporis, et non utaris nisi in locis carnosis: sicut lacertis cruris, et coxae, et lacertis brachiorum, et mammillarum, et uentris, et inguinum, et similibus eis, ex lacertis carnosis, humidis.	However, you should not use them in blood-letting at every location on the body, and you should only use them at fleshy places: such as the veins of the legs, and hips, and the veins of the arms, and breasts, and abdomen, and groin, and similar fleshy places.
Et quandoque fiunt ex eis instrumenta parua alia similia corticibus fisticorum, secundum suam formam: quibus abscinditur sanguis quando fluit ex loco phlebotomiae, aut apud incisionem uenae, aut arteriae: et quandoque fiunt ex eis rotundae secundum hanc formam.	And when they are made from these small instruments similar to those of the fisticulers, according to their own shape: with which blood is drawn out when it flows from the place of phlebotomy, or at the incision of a vein, or artery: and when they are made round according to this shape.
Â¶ De cura Mammillarum hominum quae mammillis mulierum assimilantur.	Concerning the treatment of men's breasts which resemble those of women.
Caput XLVII.	Chapter 47.
Quandoque inflantur Mammillae quorundam hominum apud complementum somni (id est, cum incipiunt pollui in somno) donec similantur mammillis mulierum: et remanent apostemosae foede.	Sometimes the breasts of certain men become swollen at the time of deep sleep (that is, when they begin to be polluted in their dreams) until they resemble those of women; and they remain disgusting and loathsome.
Qui ergo abhorret illud, oportet ut secet super mammillas sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Deinde excoria pinguedinem totam.	Whoever therefore abhors that, it is necessary to make an incision above the breasts in a lunar shape, according to this form from line to line, b. to line, g. Then scrape out all the fatty tissue.
Postea imple uulnus ex medicamine incarnatiuo.	Then fill in with a medicinal poultice of flesh incrustation.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then bring together the two lips of the wound with a suture, and treat it, until it is healed.
Si autem declinat mammilla ad inferiora, et mollificatur propter magnitudinem suam, sicut accidit mulieribus: tunc oportet ut findatur in duobus lateribus suis superioribus duabus sectionibus similibus figurae lunari, quarum unaquaeque continetur cum altera apud fines utriusque, donec sit linea maior continens minorem, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Postea excoria cutem quae est inter duo labia, et aufer pinguedinem, et administra quod diximus de sutura et pulueribus, quod est necessarium ex curatione, donec sanetur.	But if the breast declines to the lower parts and becomes soft due to its size, as happens with women: then it is necessary to make two sections on either side in a lunar shape, each of which is connected with the other at their edges, so that one line contains the smaller, according to this form from line to line, b. to line, g. Then scrape out the skin that is between the two lips, and remove the fatty tissue, and apply what we have said about sutures and poultices, which is necessary for healing, until it is healed.
Si autem non comples incisionem eius quod oportet te incidere, propter inquietudinem infirmi, aut propter fluxum sanguinis: tunc oportet ut impleas uulnus coto submerso unguento corrosiuo, et dimitte ipsum, donec corrodat illud quod remansit ex pinguedine.	If you do not make a complete incision of what needs to be cut, because of the patient's anxiety or because of the flow of blood, then it is necessary to fill in the wound with a corrosive unguent and leave it, until it corrodes away what remains from the pus.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it, until it heals.
Â¶ De perforatione apostematis, quod accidit sub Titillico.	Concerning the perforation of a posternel, which occurs under the nipple.
Caput XLVIII.	Chapter 48.
Ista apostemata quae accidunt sub Titillico, sunt ex speciebus Strophularum dura, quae continet kistis, et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates.	These posternels that occur under the nipple are of the species of hard Strophuli, which contain cysts, and among them are those that contain moisture.
Quae ergo sunt ex eis quae continent humiditates, oportet ut secentur sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam, ex linea b. ad lineam, g. cum ergo euacuatur totum quod est in apostemate ex sanie, tunc imple ipsum coto ueteri, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Those therefore that are among them which contain moisture, it is necessary to section them in a lunar fashion, according to this form, from line b to line g, so that everything that is in the posternel may be evacuated from the blood, then fill it with old cotton, and leave it until another day.
Deinde auferatur cotum, et curetur cum unguento conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then the cotton is removed, and it is treated with a suitable ointment for that, until it heals.
Quod si apostema fuerit ex specie nodorum Strophularum, tunc scinde super ipsum, sicut diximus in sectione super Strophulas aequaliter.	If the posternel was of the species of nodular Strophuli, then split it open above, as we have said in the section on Strophuli, equally.
Si autem extenditur uulnus in hoc ut emittat pus, tunc administra in eo cauterium, secundum quod diximus in eo quod praemissum est.	If, however, the wound extends to this point so that it emits pus, then apply a cautery to it, according to what we have said in the preceding matter.
Â¶ De sectione apostematis quod accidit propter Arteriam et Venam.	Concerning the section of the posternel that occurs due to the Artery and Vein.
Caput XLIX.	Chapter 49.
Quando disrumpitur Arteria, et consolidatur cutis quae est supra eam, tuno multotiens accidit inde apostema: et similiter accidit Venae etiam, ut accidat in ea apostema et inflatio.	When the Artery is ruptured and the skin that is above it is consolidated, then often an apostem (abscess) occurs there; and similarly it happens with the Veins as well, so that an abscess and inflammation occur in them.
Et signa quibus cognoscitur, quod apostema et inflatio sint propter Arteriam et Venam, sunt: quoniam, quando apostema est propter arteriam, est longum, aggregatum in profundo corporis: et quando impellis apostema digits tuis, sentis quasi sit ei stridor.	And the signs by which it is recognized that the abscess and inflammation are due to the Artery and Vein are: because when an abscess is due to an artery, it is long, aggregated deep in the body; and when you press on the abscess with your fingers, you feel as if there is a stridor.
Et illud quod est propter Venam, est rotundum in manifesto corporis.	And that which is because of the Veins, is round in the manifest body.
Et sectio super hoc apostema est error, et praecipue quod est sub ascellis, et inguinibus, et collo, et in locis multis corporis: et est magnum ualde.	And the section above this abscess is an error, and especially that which is under the armpits, and in the groin, and in the neck, and in many places of the body: and it is a great wound indeed.
Oportet ergo ut deuitetur eius cura cum ferro, et quod ex eis etiam est in extremitatibus, aut in capite, oportet ut deuitetur.	It is necessary therefore that his treatment should be undertaken with iron, and what is from them is also in the extremities or in the head, it is necessary that he should be treated.
Super illud ergo quod ex eis est ex inflatione orificii Arteriae, finde in cute sectione in longitudine.	Above therefore what is from them is from the inflammation of the arterial orifice, find in a gentle section in length.
Deinde aperi sectionem cum uncinis, postea Arteriam: et libera eam ex tunicis, donec detegatur.	Then open the section with hooks, afterwards the artery: and free it from its coats, until it is exposed.
Deinde intromitte sub ea acum, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, et stringe Arteriam cum filo duplo in duobus locis, secundum quod docui te in extractione duarum Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then introduce the needle under it, and make it penetrate until it reaches the other side, and tie the artery with a double thread in two places, according to what I taught you in the extraction of the two arteries that are in the temples.
Deinde punge locum, qui est inter duo ligamenta cum spatumili, donec egrediatur sanguis qui est in eo totus, et soluatur apostema.	Then prick the place which is between the two ligaments with a spatula, until all the blood that is in it flows out, and the abscess is dissolved.
Deinde administra curationem quae generat pus, donec cadant ligamenta: postea cura illud cum unguentis conuenientibus ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then administer a treatment that generates pus, until the ligaments fall off: afterwards treat it with suitable ointments, until it heals.
Quod si fuerit apostema propter sectionem Venae, tunc oportet ut teneas manu tua quod tibi possibile est ex apostemate cum cute.	What if there is an abscess because of the section of a Vein, then it is necessary that you hold with your hand what you can from the abscess with the skin.
Deinde intromitte acum sub loco quem tenuisti manu tua, et fac eam penetrare: et sit in ea filum duplum, donec extrahas ipsum ex latere altero.	Then introduce a needle under the place which you held with your hand, and make it penetrate: and let there be a double thread in it, until you extract it from the other side.
Deinde liga cum ipso apostema ligamento bono: secundum quod dixi tibi in ligamento uuae, a duabus partibus cum duabus extremitatibus fili.	Then tie with the same abscess a good ligature: according to what I said to you about the ligature of the vein, from two parts with two extremities of the thread.
Si autem times quod extrahatur filum, tunc intromitte acum aliam cum filo alio sub apostemate toto apud incisionem acus: preme, et stringe fila tua in quatuor locis.	If however the time comes that the thread is extracted, then introduce another needle with another thread under the entire abscess at the incision of the instrument: press, and tie your threads in four places.
Deinde seca apostema in medio sui, donec quando egreditur quod in eo est: tunc incide superfluitatem cutis, et dimitte quod ligatum est ex ea.	Then, dissect the aposteme in its middle, until when it goes out what is in it; then, incise the superficies of the skin, and dismiss what is bound to it from that.
Deinde pone super ipsum puluillum quem submersisti in uino, et oleo.	Then, put on top of it a poultice which you have submerged in wine, and oil.
Deinde administra curationem, quae fit cum liciniis et unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then, administer treatment, which is done with bandages and ointments, until it heals.
Â¶ De apostemate quod accidit ex torsione Neruorum.	Concerning the aposteme that occurs due to twisting of the tendons.
Caput L.	Chapter 50.
Sicut accidit apostema in Arteria et Vena, similiter accidit apostema in Neruis: quod accidit in eis percussio, aut accidit a labore superfluo, et similibus: et fit plurimum illis in locis adiutoriorum, aut calcanei, et in omni loco in quo mouentur iuncturae: et est apostema graue.	Just as an aposteme occurs in the Artery and Vein, similarly an aposteme occurs in the Nerves; which occurs from percussion, or occurs from excessive labor, and similar things; and it happens most often to them in the places of joints, or ankle, and in every place where the joints are moved; and it is a grave aposteme.
Similatur color eius reliquo corpori, et est in pluribus dispositionibus absque dolore: et quando stringitur cum uehementia, sentit in eo infirmus simile stupori.	Its color is similar to that of the rest of the body, and it is in many dispositions without pain; and when it is constricted with violence, it feels in it a weakness similar to numbness.
Et non est apostema aggregatum in profundo corporis, imo est sub cute, et ipsum mouetur ad omnem partem, et non uadit ad anteriora, uel ante, neque retro ad posteriora.	And it is not an aggregated aposteme deep in the body, but rather it is under the skin, and it moves to every part, and does not proceed to the front, nor forward, nor backward to the rear.
Quod ergo ex eis est in iuncturis, non oportet ut inuadatur cum ferro.	Therefore, since it is in the joints, it is not necessary that it be touched with an iron.
Fortasse enim accidet contractio.	Perhaps a contraction occurs.
In illo autem quod ex eis est in capite, aut in fronte, finde cutem cum spatumili.	In that case, since it is in the head or in the forehead, make an incision with a spatula.
Si ergo est apostema paruum, tunc tene ipsum cum forficibus, et abscinde ipsum a radice.	If therefore it is a small aposteme, then hold it with forceps, and cut it off at the root.
Et si est magnum, tunc suspende ipsum eum uncino, et excoria ipsum: deinde aufer ipsum, et aggrega uulnus cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if it is large, then suspend it with a hook, and excavate it; then lift it out, and bring the wound together with a suture; and treat it, until it heals.
Â¶ De sectione apostematis, quod accidit in uentre.	Concerning the excision of an aposteme that occurs in the belly.
Caput LI.	Chapter 51.
Accidunt quibusdam hominibus multotiens in uentribus eorum, et in reliquis corporibus ipsorum, thelil, quae nominantur Fungalia, per similitudinem ipsorum cum fungis.	It happens to certain men that many times there are growths in their intestines and in other parts of their bodies, which are called Fungalia, because of their similarity to mushrooms.
Quorum radix est subtilis, et ipsorum caput est grossum, et conuersa sunt labia eorum.	Whose root is subtle, and their head is large, and their lips are turned inward.
Et est ex eis paruum: et est ex eis quod magnificatur ualde.	And it is small among them: and it is among them what is greatly esteemed.
Et ego quidem iam uidi uirum, et in uentre eius erant duo thelil, quae erant magis quam rebus aliis similia fungis: non erat differentia inter ea, alba, minutae radicis, et inuersabantur labia eorum, et findebantur, et humiditas currebat ex eis semper.	And I have seen a man, and in his belly there were two growths, which were more similar to mushrooms than anything else: there was no difference between them, white, with small roots, and their lips turned inward, and they were covered over, and moisture flowed out of them always.
Incidi ergo ea, et inueni in pondere unius quasi X et VIII uncia et in altero quasi VI uncia Et operatio in incisione eorum est, ut consideres tunc, si infirmus est humidus, et color thelil est albus, humidum, subtilis radicis: tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili lato, et sint in praesentia tua cauteria in igne.	I therefore cut into them, and I found that one weighed almost 10 ounces and the other almost 8 ounces. And the operation of cutting into them is, as you consider then, if the patient is humid, and the color of the growth is white, humid, with a subtle root: then cut into it with a broad spatula, and let your cauterium be present in the fire.
Multotiens enim expellitur apud sectionem eius sanguis multus: propera ergo si te uincit sanguis, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	For often a lot of blood is expelled during the dissection of it: therefore, if you are overcome by the bleeding, then cauterize it.
Quod si uides infirmum pauidum et timidum ab incisione cum ferro, tunc accipe filum ex plumbo decenter factum, et stringe cum eo athelul: cuius modus est quem diximus, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	If you see the patient is pale and timid after the incision with iron, then take a thread made from lead, well-fashioned, and tie it around the vessel: this is the method I mentioned, and leave it for two days.
Deinde adde in strictura plumbi.	Then add to the stricture of lead.
Non ergo cesses stringere plumbum, quotiens imprimit in thelil, donec abscindatur, et cadat per se absque labore.	Do not cease to tie the lead, as often as it is impressed on the growth, until it is cut off, and it falls away by itself without effort.
Si autem thelil grossae fuerit radicis, tunc in incisione eius est quiddam timoris et pauoris: praecipue quod est in uentre.	If, however, the growth is large-rooted, then there is something to fear and be anxious about in its incision: especially because it is in the belly.
Verumtamen possibile est, ut incidas medietatem eius.	Truly, it is possible to cut into half of it.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum, ut non redeat.	Then cauterize him, so that he does not relapse.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then treat him, until the wound heals.
Et caue ne praesumas incidere thelil quod est fusci coloris, pauci sensus, foedi aspectus: ipsum enim est apostema cancerosum: et ego ueniam cum rememoratione Cancri post hoc.	And beware lest you suppose that a hard, fusiform, painless, foul-smelling tumor is anything but a cancerous aposteme; for I have seen it with the memory of Cancer after this.
Â¶ De cura eminentiae Vmbilici.	On the treatment of prominent umbilical hernias.
Caput LII.	Chapter 52.
Fit eminentia Vmbilici ex caussis multis.	Umbilical hernias occur from many causes.
Aut ex fissuris sifac, quod super uentrem est: et exit ex eo althub, aut intestinum, secundum quod accidit in reliquis rupturis.	Or they arise from cracks in the siphac, which is above the navel; and there emerges from it a gut or intestine, according to what happens in other ruptures.
Aut ex sanguine qui fluit ex Vena, aut ex Arteria, secundum quod praemissum est.	Or they arise from blood that flows from the Vein, or from the Artery, according to what has been mentioned before.
Aut ex uentositate coartata in eo.	Or they arise from a constricted flatulence in it.
Si autem est propter fissuram sifac, et exitum thirbi: tunc est color apostematis similis colori corporis: et est lene, absque dolore: et apparet diuersi situs.	If, however, it is due to a crack in the siphac and an emergence of thronging: then it has a color similar to that of the body, and it is smooth, without pain; and it appears to be in different locations.
Et si est propter egressionem intestini, tunc est situs eius, cum eo quod narrauimus, uehementioris diuersitatis.	And if it is due to an emergence of the intestine, then its location is with what we have described, of a more severe diversity.
Cum ergo tu premis ipsum digitis tuis, occultatur: deinde redit, et fortasse est cum eo sonitus: et magnificatur multum apud introitum balnei, et laborem uehaementum.	When you press it with your fingers, it is hidden; then it returns, and perhaps there is a noise with it; and it is greatly magnified upon entering the bath, and a severe labor.
Si uero est propter humiditatem, est lene, tunc non occultatur quando premis ipsum manu tua, neque constringium, neque additur.	If, indeed, it is due to moisture, it is smooth; then it does not hide when you press on it with your hand, nor does it contract, nor does it increase.
Quod si est propter sanguinem, tunc cum istis signis apparet apostema ad nigredinem de cliue.	What if it is due to blood, then with these signs it appears as an aposteme inclining towards blackness from the wound.
Si autem est propter carnem natam: tunc est apostema graue, grossum, durum, et figitur secundum quantitatem unam.	If, however, it is due to a born flesh: then it is a grave, thick, hard, and fixed aposteme, according to one quantity.
Si uero est propter uentositatem, tunc tactus eius est lenis.	If it is due to flatulence, then his touch is gentle.
Et operatio in illo est, ut consideres tunc, si eminentia umbilici est propter sanguinem Arteriae, aut Venae, aut uentositatem: tunc oportet ut prohibearis a curatione eius.	And the operation on it is, as you should consider then, if the prominence of the navel is due to blood of the Artery, or Vein, or flatulence: then it is necessary to refrain from its treatment.
Nam in illo est timor et pauor, sicut docui te in capitulo, in quo dixi apostemata propter arteriam et uenam.	For there is fear and anxiety, as I instructed you in the chapter where I mentioned that abscesses are due to the artery and vein.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est propter intestinum, aut zirbum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, quatenus teneat anhelitum suum, et stet stans extensus.	Since the prominence of the navel is due to the intestine or a swelling: then it is necessary to prescribe for the patient, so that he may hold his breath, and stand upright, extended.
Deinde signa cum encaustro in circumitu umbilici totius.	Then apply signs with an cauterizing iron around the entire circumference of the navel.
Postea praecipe ei, ut resupinetur inter manus tuas super dorsum suum.	Afterwards, instruct him to take a deep breath between your hands on his back.
Deinde circunda cum spatumili lato in circumitu umbilici super locum quem signasti cum encaustro.	Then surround with a broad spatula around the circumference of the navel over the place you signed with the cauterizing iron.
Postea extende medium apostematis ad superiora, cum uncino magno.	Afterwards, extend the middle of the abscess upwards with a large hook.
Deinde liga eum in circumitu forti cum filo, aut cum chorda de serico ligamento firmo: et sit nodus ligamenti alenxotati.	Then bind it around strongly with a thread, or with a firm silk cordage: and let the knot of the ligament be hidden.
Deinde aperi medium apostematis extensum supra ligamentum.	Then open the middle of the abscess extended above the ligament.
Si ergo inueneris ipsum iam captum a ligamento: tunc extrahe alenxotati, et intromitte in ipsum digitum indicem, et impelle intestinum ad interiora uentris: et si inueneris zirbum, tunc accipe ipsum cum uncino, et incide superfluitatem eius.	If you have found it already caught by the ligament: then extract what is hidden, and insert your index finger into it, and push the intestine towards the interior of the belly: and if you find a swelling, then take it with the hook, and cut away its excess.
Si autem contraria est tibi arteria, aut uena: tunc circunda ipsum multum.	If, however, the artery or vein is contrary to you: then surround it greatly.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam.	Then return to your operation.
Et accipe duas acus, et intromitte in eis duo fila fortia: et intromitte duas acus in circumitu quem fecisti circa apostema in modum crucis, quas facis penetrare.	And take two needles, and insert into them two strong threads: and insert two needles around the circumference which you made around the abscess in the shape of a cross, which you make penetrate.
Deinde stringe apostema in quatuor locis super acus: et si uis, aufer acus, et dimitte locum, donec putrefiat caro extensa: et cadat per se: aut incide ipsam quando subtiliatur et putrefit.	Then, the aposteme is strangled in four places above the wound; and if you wish, remove the wound, and abandon the place, until the rotten flesh extends and falls off by itself; or cut it open when it becomes subtle and rots.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then, treat it with what is suitable from ointments, until it heals.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est ex carne nara in eo, aut ex humiditate: tunc oportet ut concaues apostema, sicut diximus.	What if the swelling of the navel is from fatty flesh in it, or from moisture; then it is necessary to concave the aposteme, as we have said.
Et extrahas sanguinem, aut humiditatem, quam inuenis in eo.	And extract blood, or moisture, which you find in it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod solidat locum.	Then, treat it with what solidifies the place.
Â¶ De cura CANCRI.	On the treatment of CANCER.
Caput LIII.	Chapter 53.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Cancri, et qualiter est uia ad curationem eius cum medicinis: et cauendum ab eo cum curatione eius cum ferro, ut non ulceretur: et diximus Cancrum generatum in matrice, et cautelam a curatione eius.	We have spoken in the division of species of Cancer, and how it is a way to its cure with medicines; and beware of that with its cure by iron, lest it ulcerate; and we have spoken of Cancer generated in the matrix, and caution against its cure.
Et dixerunt antiqui, quod quandoque Cancer est in loco, ubi possibilis est eius eradicatio: sicut Cancer qui est in mammillis, aut in coxa, et eis similibus, ex membris locatis ad extrahendum totum eius: praecipue quando est incipiens paruus.	And the ancients said that when Cancer is in a place where its eradication is possible, such as Cancer which is in the breasts, or in the hip, and similar ones, located in members to be completely extracted: especially when it is small and beginning.
Quando uero antiquatur, et est magnus, non oportet ut appropinques ei.	When, however, it has grown old and is large, it is not suitable to approach it.
Ego enim non potui sanare ex eo aliquem: neque uidi alium ante me qui peruenerit ad illud.	For I myself was not able to heal anyone from it; nor did I see another before me who had ventured to tackle it.
Et operatio in eo, quando est locatus sicut diximus, est, ut praecedas, et soluas infirmum ex cholera nigra aliquotiens.	And the operation on it, when it is located as we said, is to cut around it, and to release the weak part from black bile several times.
Deinde phlebotoma ipsum si inuenis cum repletione manifesta.	Then, bleed it if you find it with a manifest fullness.
Deinde praepara infirmum praeparatione, in qua locetur cum operatione.	Then, prepare the weak part with preparation, in which it will be located with the operation.
Deinde proiice in Cancrum uncinos qui conueniunt ei.	Then, apply to the Cancer unguents that are suitable for it.
Postea concaua ipsum ab omni parte cum cute, secundum perscrutationem, donec non remaneat aliquid ex radicibus eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere, et non abscindas ipsum uelociter, imo exprime loca, et absterge sanguinem grossum totum manu tua, aut cum quo possibile est ibi ex instrumentis.	Here is the translation:
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi fluxus sanguinis grossi ex incisione arteriae, aut uenae: tunc cauteriza uenam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If however you make a contrary flow of thick blood from the incision of the artery or vein, then cauterize the vein until the blood is stopped.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with the remaining treatment, until it heals.
Â¶ De cura Hydropisis.	On the treatment of Dropsy.
Caput LIIII.	Chapter 54.
Iam narrauimus in diuisione species Hydropisis, et qualiter fit aggregatio aquae: et signa omnis speciei, et curationem eius cum medicinis.	We will now discuss the division of the species of Dropsy, and how water accumulates, and the signs of each species, and its treatment with medicines.
Et illa quae curatur cum ferro, non est nisi species asclitis sola: et non approximatur cum ferro speciei timpanitis: neque speciei hyposarcae penitus: nam illud mortale est.	And those that are treated with iron are not but a single species of ascites; and it does not approach with iron the species of tympanitis; nor the deeply hidden species of hypochondria; for that is mortal.
Quando tu iam medicatus es hanc speciem Hydropisis timpanitis cum medicinis, et non contulit medicatio tua: tunc considera.	When you have already treated this species of Dropsy, tympanitis, with medicines, and your medication has not been of use, then consider.
Nam si infirmo iam consecuta est debilitas, aut est cum eo infirmitas alia praeter Hydropisim: sicut si sit cum eo tussis, aut uentris solutio, et similia illis: tunc caue ne mediceris ei cum ferro: quoniam est timor illud.	For if the patient has already been weakened by debility, or has another infirmity besides Dropsy, such as if he is troubled with coughing, or looseness of the stomach, and similar things; then beware of medicating him with iron: for that is a source of fear.
Si autem uides infirmum exuberantis uirtutis, neque est cum eo aegritudo praeter Hydropisim solam: et non est puer, neque senex: tunc modus operationis in eo est, ut tu eleues infirmum stantem inter manus tuas, et minister post ipsum exprimat uentrem eius manu sua impellendo aquam ad inferiorem partem pectinis.	If however you see a patient overflowing with vitality, and there is no other illness besides Dropsy alone; and he is not a child, nor an old man: then the method of operation for him is, that you place the patient standing between your hands, and afterwards press his belly with your hand, impelling water towards the lower part of the chest.
Deinde accipe spatumile spinosum, secundum hanc formam.	Then take a pointed instrument, according to this form.
Sit duarum partium acutarum, longum, acutae extremitatis sicut Spatumile.	It is of two acute parts, long, with an acute extremity, like a Spatula.
Verumtamen in eo sit quiddam breuitatis paulatim, ut non pertranseas cum eo apud operationem usque ad intestinum, et laedas ipsum.	However, there should be something of moderation in it, so that you do not penetrate too far with it during the operation, and harm him.
Deinde considera.	Then consider.
Nam si est generatio Hydropisis ex parte intestinorum, tunc oportet ut elongeris cum sectione ab umbilico quantitate trium digitorum, ad inferiora in directo eius supra pectinem.	For if the generation of Dropsy is from the part of the intestines, then it is necessary to extend with an incision from the navel a measure of three fingers, downwards in a straight line above the chest.
Si uero generatio Hydropisis est propter aegritudinem epatis: tunc sit sectio tua sinistra ab umbilico tribus digitis.	If the cause of hydropsy is due to weakness of the liver: then let your left-hand section be three fingers' breadth from the navel.
Et si generatio eius est propter splenem, tunc sit sectio in latere dextro: et non oportet etiam ut sit sectio in latere super quod uult iacere infirmus, ut non currant superfluitates ad illum locum debilem.	And if the cause of it is due to the spleen, then let the section be on the right side: and it is not fitting that there should also be a section above where the patient lies, so that excessive fluxes do not flow to that weak place.
Deinde perfora cum instrumento cutem totam.	Then pierce with an instrument through the entire skin.
Deinde intromitte in illam sectionem, et eleua manum tuam cum Spatumili inter cutem, et sifac, quasi tu excories ipsum: et sit quantitas quae excoriatur quantitas unguis, aut circiter ilud.	Then insert into that section, and lift your hand with a spatula between the skin, and scrape, as if you were excavating it: and let the amount that is excavated be the amount of a fingernail, or about that.
Deinde perfora sifac, donec perueniat Spatumile ad locum uacuum: et est locus aquae.	Then scrape until the spatula reaches the empty place: and it is the place of water.
Deinde extrahe ipsum, et intromitte in foramen instrumentum, cuius haec est forma.	Then extract it, and insert into the opening an instrument, whose shape is this.
Et est simile cannulae: fit ex argento, aut aere, aut aurichalco, lene, tersum: cui in inferiori parte sui est foramen paruum, et in lateribus eius sunt tria foramina, duo ab una parte, et unum a parte altera: et facia est extremitas eius incisa, secundum modum incisionis calami, sicut uides: in extremitate eius superiore est armilla.	And it is similar to a cannula: made from silver, or copper, or gold, smooth, polished: which has a small opening at its lower part, and on its sides are three openings, two on one side and one on the other side: and its extremity is incised, according to the manner of incising a reed, as you see: at its upper extremity there is a ring.
Nam quando instrumentum peruenit ad aquam, tunc ipsa descendit statim super instrumentum, ergo euacua ex aqua in hora quantitatem mediam.	For when the instrument reaches the water, then it immediately descends onto the instrument, thus evacuating from the water at that hour a moderate quantity.
Quoniam si tu euacuas ex ea plus quam oportet, in hora fortasse moritur infirmus per resolutionem spiritus sui animalis: aut accidit ei syncopis quae appropinquat morti.	Because if you evacuate from it more than is fitting, perhaps the patient will die soon due to the resolution of his vital spirit: or a syncope approaching death will happen to him.
Verum euacua ex ea secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius, et secundum quod significant tibi dispositiones infirmi ex uirtute pulsus eius, et ex bonitate eius.	But evacuate from it according to the quantity of its virtue, and according to what is signified to you by the dispositions of the patient from the goodness of his pulse, and from his goodness.
Deinde extrahe instrumentum, et retine aquam.	Then extract the instrument, and retain the water.
Quod est, quia retinetur statim propter cutem quae retinet foramen quod est super sifac: de quo narraui, ut perfores ipsum secundum illum modum.	What is, because it is immediately retained due to the skin that retains an opening which is above the wound; about which I will narrate, so that you may perforate it in accordance with that method.
Deinde itera instrumentum die altero, si uides infirmum tolerare illud: et extrahe etiam ex aqua quantitatem paruam.	Then, take the other instrument, if you see that the patient can tolerate that; and also extract a small quantity from the water.
Fac illud diebus aliquot sine timore, et custodi te ab errore: donec non remaneat ex aqua nisi parum.	Do that for some days without fear, and guard yourself against error: until nothing remains of the water except a little.
Si autem times super infirmum, et dimittis ex aqua rem multam: tunc cura ipsum cum sepultura in harena calida, et sudore multo in balneo et sole, et expectet super sitim: et cura ipsum cum medicinis exiccatiuis, donec sanetur: et cauteriza super stomachum, et epar, et splenem, post extractionem aquae: secundum quod narraui in eo quod praecessit.	But if the time is favorable for the patient, and you let out a great deal of water: then treat it with burying in hot sand, and sweating much in the bath and sun, and wait upon the wound: and treat it with drying medicines, until it is healed: and cauterize above the stomach, and liver, and spleen, after the extraction of water: according to what I narrated previously.
Â¶ De cura infantium qui nascuntur locis urinae eorum non perforatis.	Concerning the treatment of infants who are born with unperforated urinary passages.
Caput LV.	Chapter 55.
Quando egreditur aliquis infantium ex uentre matris suae, et caput mutonis eius est non perforatum, aut est foramen strictum, aut in non suo loco.	When an infant emerges from its mother's womb, and the head of its penis is not perforated, or the opening is narrow, or it is not in its proper place.
Oportet ergo succurrere cum perforatione eius statim cum nascitur cum Spatumili subtili ualde, secundum hanc formam.	It is therefore necessary to provide help with a perforation immediately after birth with a very fine spatula, according to this method.
Deinde pone in foramine clauum subtilem ex plumbo, et liga ipsum: et tene ipsum tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then put a small leaden rod into the opening, and tie it: and hold it for three days, or four.
Quando ergo uult urinam emittere, remoueatur, et mingat.	When therefore it wants to pass urine, it is removed, and the flow is established.
Deinde reduc ipsum.	Then reduce it.
Et si tu non ponis plumbum, iam possibile est, ut urina quae incedit super locum, non permittat ipsum claudi.	And if you do not put in the lead, it is now possible that the urine which flows into the place does not allow it to close.
Ille autem cuius foramen est strictum, medicatur cum plumbo, sicut diximus, diebus multis, donec amplificetur.	That one, however, whose opening is narrow, is treated with lead, as we have said, for many days, until it is enlarged.
Illi autem in quibus est foramen in non suo loco, laeduntur.	Those, however, in whom the opening is not in its proper place, are wounded.
Quod est, quia ex eis qui nascitur, foramen est apud finem capitis uirgae: quare non potest mingere ad anteriora, donec eleuat uirgam manu sua ad superiora.	What is, because it is born from those who are born with a natural opening at the end of the spinal cord: wherefore it cannot move to the front, unless it elevates its spine by hand to above.
Neque est ei generatio, propterea, quod sperma non potest peruenire ad matricem secundum rectitudinem: et est aegritudo foeda ualde.	Nor is it his generation, therefore, because the seed cannot arrive at the womb according to rectitude: and there is a foul and loathsome disease.
Et modus operationis in illo est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum.	And the method of operating on it is, that the weak part should be raised above its back.
Deinde extende caput uirgae eius manu tua sinistra extensione uehementi, et incide caput capitis uirgae ex loco priapi, cum acumine, aut spatumili acuto: sicut est incisio calami, aut sicut tu radis aliquid, ut medium eius ueniat simile capiti uirgae: et ut cadat foramen in medio secundum quod oportet.	Then extend the head of the spine with your left hand by a vigorous extension, and cut the head of the spinal cord from its proper place, with a sharp needle or an acute scalpel: just as it is an incision of a reed, or as you would carve something, so that the middle part comes to resemble the head of the spine: and so that the opening falls in the middle according to what is necessary.
Et caue tibi apud operationem tuam a fluxu sanguinis.	And beware lest you have a flow of blood during your operation.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	For it has often happened thus.
Oppone ergo ei cum eo quod abscindit sanguinem, et cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Therefore, oppose it with what stops the bleeding, and cure the wound, until it is healed.
Â¶ De Albather quae accidunt in praeputio et capite uigae, et corruptione, nigredine, et adhaerentia.	Concerning the ulcers that occur on the spinal cord and head of the spine, and their corruption, blackening, and adhesions.
Caput LVI.	Chapter 56.
Multotiens accidunt istae Albather in uirga, et est eminentia carnis foedae.	These ulcers often occur on the spine, and there is a foul prominence of rotten flesh.
Et ex ea alia est maligna, et alia non maligna.	And among them, some are malignant, and others are not malignant.
Non malignam ergo oportet ut suspendas cum uncino subtili, et abscindas eam, donec mundes eam totam.	You should therefore suspend the non-malignant one with a subtle hook, and cut it off, until you cleanse it entirely.
Deinde pone super eam cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio.	Then put on top of it a covering of ointment made from Egyptian unguent.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud cum unguento dyafinicon, donec sanetur.	Then treat it afterwards with the DYaphinicon ointment, until it is healed.
Quod si Albather est maligna, foedi coloris, tunc oportet ut administres in ea cauterium post incisionem eius et ipsius rasionem.	But if the ulcer is malignant, of foul color, then it is necessary to apply cautery to it after its incision and removal.
Si autem Albather est in praeputio captiui, non circumcisi, et est pars Albather inter praeputium, et pars eius extra: tunc oportet ut auferas Albather, quae est intus in primis, donec quando consolidatur, tunc cura ipsum exterius: quoniam quando tu curas eam simul, non securatur praeputium quin preforetur.	If the albucasis is captured in the foreskin and is not circumcised, and part of the albucasis is within the foreskin and part of it outside: then you should remove the albucassis that is inside first, until it consolidates, then cure the outer one; for when you cure them simultaneously, the foreskin does not become secure unless it is brought forward.
Et iam accidunt etiam in testiculis, et praeputio nigredo et corruptio.	And now also occur in the testicles, and blackening and corruption of the foreskin.
Oportet ergo, ut tu concaues totum quod iam denigratum est, et quod uult corrumpi, aut iam corruptum est.	Therefore, it is necessary that you cut away all that has already become blackened and what wants to corrupt or is already corrupted.
Deinde line super ipsum post illud cum melle quod iam concussum est cum farina corticum granatorum, et herbi tritorum cribellatorum.	Then apply a layer over it with honey that has been mixed with flour of toasted grains and powdered herbs.
Deinde cura illud cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra cauterium cum cauterio lunari, secundum hanc formam.	If a flow of blood occurs, then apply cautery with a lunar cautery, according to this method.
Cauterium enim est iuuatiuum ad duas dispositiones simul, scilicet ad fluxum sanguinis, et uulnus quando corrumpitur.	For cautery is helpful for two conditions at the same time, namely for a flow of blood and when a wound becomes corrupted.
Quod si corroditur caput uirgae, et destruitur totum in hora: tunc oportet ut intromittas in meatum priapi cannulam ex plumbo, ut mingat infirmus super eam.	If the head of the vein is corroded and everything is destroyed in an hour, then it is necessary to insert a small pipe made of lead into the affected part, so that the weakened area can be moistened over it.
In adhaerentia uero praeputii cum capite uirgae, et haec quidem adhaerentia non accidit, nisi in eo cuius praeputium est sanum, et non exigitur super ipsum circumcisio: et quandoque accidit adhaerentia propter uulnus, aut apostema: oportet ergo ut excories eam cum Spatumili obtuso, donec soluatur ligamentum, et liberetur caput uirgae ab omni parte.	In the adhesion of the foreskin to the head of the vein, and this adhesion does not occur unless in one whose foreskin is healthy and does not require circumcision over it; and when adhesion occurs due to a wound or aposteme: therefore it is necessary to excoriate it with a blunt Spatumili until the ligament is loosened and the head of the vein is freed from every part.
Quod si est difficile discernere ea exquisite, tunc oportet ut excories aliquid ex capite uirgae, et ex praeputio.	If it is difficult to discern these things exactly, then it is necessary to excoriate something from the head of the vein and from the foreskin.
Quod est, quia praeputium quando est subtile, fortasse perforatur propter subtilitatem suam uelociter.	This is because the foreskin, when it is subtle, perhaps will be quickly perforated due to its own subtlety.
Deinde separa inter praeputium, et caput uirgae cum panno lini subtili, qui iam madefactus est in aqua frigida, ut non adhereant iterum.	Then separate using a thin linen cloth, which has already been soaked in cold water, so that they do not stick together again.
Deinde curetur cum uino stiptico, donec consolidetur.	Then it should be touched with a stipic wine, until it is consolidated.
Â¶ De mundificatione infantium, et curatione ex errore eis accidente.	On the purification of infants and the cure of their accidents resulting from error.
Caput LVII.	Chapter 57.
Circumcisio non est solutio continuitatis, sicut reliqua uulnera: uerumtamen cum sit ex operatione nostra, uoluntate nostra, et usus eius sit in pueris proprie, est necesse ut signemus in ea operationem meliorem, et uiam leuiorem perducentem ad salutem.	Circumcision is not a solution for continuity, just like other wounds: however, since it is from our operation, our will, and its use is especially in boys, it is necessary that we mark out in this operation a better method, and a lighter way leading to health.
Dico ergo, quod antiqui non dixerunt circumcisionem in aliquo suorum librorum: quoniam non utuntur in legibus suis, et non est nisi quod acquisiuimus per experimentum.	I say therefore that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books: because they did not use it in their laws, and it is only what we have acquired through experience.
Quod est, quia ego inueni maiorem partem artificum, et phlebotomatorum uti mundificatione, circumcidendo cum nouacula, et cum forficibus: et utuntur alfecati, et ligaudo cum filo, et incisione cum ungula.	Which is, because I have found that most artisans and phlebotomists use purification, circumcision with a razor, and with forceps: and they use applying adhesive, and binding with a thread, and incising with a nail.
Et ego quidem iam probaui omnes istos modos, et non inueni meliorem mundificatione cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo.	And I have indeed already tried all those methods, and did not find a better purification than with forceps, and binding with a thread.
Quoniam in mundificatione cum nouacula, multotiens effugit cutis.	Because in purification with a razor, the skin often escapes.
Quoniam cutis praeputii duas habet tunicas: ergo forsitan inciditur cutis superior, et temanet tunica inferior: cogitur ergo ad incisionem ad incidendum alteram, et dolorem futurum.	Because the skin of the foreskin has two layers: therefore perhaps the outer skin is cut, and the inner layer remains: thus it is necessary to make an incision to cut the other, and future pain.
Et cum mundificatione quae fit per alfecati, id est, digitalis, quo utuntur sutores, non securatur incisio extremitatis uirilis membri: quoniam fortasse ingreditur in foramen eius.	And with the purification that is done through adhesions, that is, digital, which surgeons use, they do not ensure an incision of the extremity of the virile member: because perhaps it may enter into its opening.
In mundificatione autem cum ungula, fortasse euadit ferrum, et corrumpit operationem tuam: et cutis quidem pueri est breuis natura, et multotiens nascuntur taliter, quod non indigent mundificatione: et iam uidi illud.	In purification with a nail, perhaps the iron may burst forth and corrupt your operation: and indeed the skin of the boy is brief by nature, and often they are born in such a way that they do not need purification: and I have already seen that.
Mundificationis autem cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo, bonum experimentum detexit mihi: quoniam forfices sunt proportionalis incisionis: propterea, quod acuitas quae est superius, est sicut acuitas quae est inferius.	The dissection with forceps and ligature with a thread has revealed a good experiment to me; since the forceps are proportionate to the incision, therefore, what is above is just like what is below.
Cum ergo premis manum tuam, proportionantur duae acuitates, et incidunt secundum operationem unam in tempore uno: et fit compressio simili figura, continens cutem uirgae ab omni parte, cum qua non cadit error omnino.	When you press your hand, the two edges are proportionate and they meet according to one operation at one time; and a compression is made with a similar figure, containing the skin's vitality from every part, so that no error falls.
Et modus operationis propriae est, ut facias extimare, puerum praecipue, si est ex eis qui intelligunt parumper, quod tu non facis, nisi quod ligas filum in uirga sua tantum: et dimittas ipsum usque ad diem alium.	And the proper method of operation is to make an external examination, especially on a young patient, if he is one of those who understand for a short time, that you do not do anything unless you tie the thread in his own vein only: and you leave it until another day.
Deinde fac eum gaudere et laetari omnimodo quo possibile est tibi illud, ex eo quod recipit intelligentia sua.	Then make him rejoice and be happy in every way possible to you, because of that which he receives with his own understanding.
Deinde fac eum stare inter manus tuas praeparatae staturae, et non sit sedens: et occulta forfices in manica tua, aut sub pede tuo, ne uideat eos puer omnino, neque aliquid ex instrumentis.	Then make him stand between your prepared hands, and not sit: and hide the forceps in your sleeve or under your foot, so that the boy does not see them at all, nor anything of the instruments.
Deinde intromitte manum tuam ad uirgam eius, et suffla in cutem, et trahe eam sursum, donec egrediatur caput uirgae.	Then insert your hand into his vein, and blow on the skin, and pull it upwards, until the head of the vein emerges.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex eo quod aggregatur in ea sordicie.	Then cleanse it from what accumulates in it filthily.
Deinde liga locum signatum cum filo duplo.	Then tie the marked place with a double thread.
Postea liga inferius eo parumper ligamentum secundum.	Afterwards, tie below it another secondary ligature for a short time.
Deinde tene cum indice tuo, et pollice locum ligamenti inferioris retentione bona, et incide inter duo ligamenta.	Then hold with your index finger, and thumb, the place of the lower ligature's good retention, and cut between the two ligatures.
Deinde eleua cutem sursum uelociter, et extrahe caput uirgae.	Then elevate the skin quickly upwards, and extract the head of the vein.
Deinde dimitte sanguinem currere paulatim (est enim melius) et pone puluerem desuper: et super puluerem pannum in quo expansus est uitellus oui decocti in aqua rosata, concussum cum oleo ros recenti bono: et dimitte eum super ipsum usque ad diem alium: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then let the blood flow slowly (for it is better), and put powder on top; and over the powder a cloth in which the yolk of an egg decocted in rose water has been spread, mixed with good fresh rose oil: and leave it on until another day; and take care of it with the remaining treatment, until it heals.
Forma autem forficis ad mundificationem haec est.	The form of a surgical scalpel is this.
Sint hebetes duae extremitates, et sint incidentes: ne egrediatur in eis ramus claui: et sit longitudo duarum acuitatum, sicut longitudo duorum manubriorum aequaliter.	There should be two extensions, and they should be inclined: the shaft of the scalpel should not protrude beyond them; and their length should be like that of two equal arm-lengths.
Error uero cadens in mundificatione est: quoniam fortasse effugit cutis intrinseca tota, aut pars eius apud incisionem.	The error is when the scalpel falls during the incision: because perhaps it has escaped from the entire internal skin, or a part of it at the point of incision.
Ergo oportet, ut extendas eam ex hora tua cum ungue tuo ante apostemationem loci: et incidas eam secundum aequalitatem.	Therefore, it is necessary to stretch it out at that time with your finger before the operation on the site, and to make an incision according to equality.
Quod si non potes tenere eam cum ungue tuo, tunc extrahe eam cum uncino, et incide eam.	But if you cannot hold it with your finger, then extract it with a hook, and make an incision.
Si autem praeterierint ei tres dies, et remanet quod est sub uirga inflatum, apostematum: tunc dimitte illud, donec sedetur apostema calidum, et excoria illud cum facilitate, et incide illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi: et caue tibi a capite uirgae.	But if three days have passed and the swelling under the rod remains inflamed, then leave it until the warm apostem is settled, and excise it with ease, and make an incision according to what is prepared for you; and be cautious at the head of the rod.
Non enim nocebit ei illud.	For it will not harm him.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod consolidat uulnus ex pulueribus, quos narrauimus in tractatu de pulueribus: et si inciditur ex cute supra mensuram, et euadit ad superiora, non nocet ei illud etiam.	Therefore treat it with what consolidates the wound from powders, which we described in the treatise on powders; and if an incision is made from the skin above measure, and it evacuates to the upper parts, it will not harm him either.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod diximus, donec sanetur.	Therefore treat it with what we have said, until it is healed.
Â¶ De extractione Vrinae retentae in uesica.	Concerning the extraction of a urinary stone retained in the bladder.
Caput LVIII.	Chapter 58.
Urinae retentio in uesica, fit ab opilatione facta ex lapide, aut sanguine congelato, aut pus, aut carne nata, et similibus illis ex eis quae diximus ex modis curationis in diuisione.	The retention of urine in the bladder occurs due to an obstruction made from a stone, or congealed blood, or pus, or born flesh, and similar things from those which we mentioned concerning the methods of cure in the division.
Et si non soluitur Vrina, et uides retentionem eius esse propter Lapidem, qui iam est in collo uesicae: tunc oportet ut sit infirmus super genua sua curuatus.	And if the urine is not discharged, and you see that its retention is due to a stone, which is already in the neck of the bladder: then it is necessary for him to be bent over his knees.
Deinde componantur pedes eius super dorsum eius, et extendat uentrem suum ex superiori parte dorsi eius, et stringat infirmus anhelitum suum quantum possibile est ei.	Then his feet are placed on his back, and he stretches out his belly from the upper part of his back, and he tightens his weak breath as much as possible to him.
Cogitur ergo cum collo uesicae ad expulsionem Lapidis ad posteriora: quare absoluitur Vrina.	It is seized therefore with the neck of the bladder for the expulsion of the stone towards the rear: because the urine is freed.
Quod si non soluitur cum eo quod diximus, et uehemens sit res super infirmum: tunc oportet ut administres extractionem eius cum instrumento, quod nominatur siringa, cuius haec est forma Sit ex argento, et sit subtile, lene, concauum sicut cannula pennae auis in subtilitate radii, longum in similitudine palmi unius et medii: cui sit cannula subtilis in capite eius.	Since if it is not dissolved with what we have said, and the matter is severe on the weak person: then it is necessary to administer the extraction of it with an instrument, which is called a syringe, whose form is this: it is made of silver, and is subtle, smooth, concave like a pen cannula, in subtlety of radius, long as a palm and a half: on which there is a subtle cannula at its head.
Et modus exitus Vrinae per ipsum est, ut accipias filum duplicatum, et liges in extremitate eius lanam, aut cotum, ligatura bona: et intromittas extremitatem fili in inferiori parte Siringae: et incide cum forficibus si superfluit aliquid ex lana, uerum intromitte in cannulam cum uehementia, sicut alzer.	And the manner of exit of the urine through it is this, that you take a doubled thread, and tie at its extremity a wool or a knot, a good ligature: and you insert the extremity of the thread into the lower part of the Syringe: and cut with forceps if something overflows from the wool, but insert into the cannula with caution, as an injection.
Deinde inunge siringam cum oleo, aut cum butyro, et albugine oui: et fac sedere infirmum super sedem, et embroca uesicam, et ipsius uirgam cum oleis humidis, et oleo oliuae, et aqua tepida.	Then anoint the syringe with oil, or with butter, and with almond oil: and make the weak person sit on a seat, and embrace the bladder, and his rod with humid oils, and olive oil, and warm water.
Deinde intromitte siringam in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat ad radicem uirgae.	Then insert the syringe into the rod with ease, until it reaches the root of the rod.
Deinde dupla ipsam superius a parte umbilici.	Then double it above at the part of the navel.
Deinde impelle siringam intra ipsam, donec perueniat ad Vesicam, et sentiat eam infirmus iam peruenisse ad rem uacuam: et non fit hoc secundum hunc ordinem, nisi quoniam meatus, in quo uadit, est in quo est tortuositas.	Then push the syringe into it, until it reaches the Bladder, and the weak person feels that it has already reached the empty space: and this does not happen according to this order, unless the passage, through which it goes, is where there is a twisting.
Deinde extende filum cum lana paulatim.	Then extend the thread with the wool little by little.
Vrina enim sequetur lanam.	For the urine will follow the wool.
Deinde extrahe eam, et fac currere Vrinam per uiam urinae: et itera siringam, et non cesses facere illud, donec euacuetur uesica, et inueniat infirmus alleuiationem.	Then extract that and make the urine flow through the way of the urinary passage; and apply a syringe, and do not stop doing that until the swelling subsides, and you find the weak alleviation.
Â¶ De qualitate clisterizationis uesicae cum Clepshydra.	About the quality of theclysterization of the swollen area with Clyster of Hydrangea.
Caput LIX.	Chapter 59.
Quando accidit in uesica ulcus, aut sanguis in ea congelatur, aut coartatur in ea pus, et uis distillare in eam aquas et medicinas: tunc fiat cum instrumento quod nominatur Clepshydra, et haec est forma eius.	When an ulcer occurs on the swollen area, or blood congeals in it, or pus accumulates in it, and you want to distill waters and medications into it; then it should be done with the instrument called Clyster of Hydrangea, and this is its form.
Est enim surda, id est, clausa.	It is stopped up, that is, closed.
Et in eo sunt tria foramina, duo ex parte una, et unum ex parte altera, sicut uides.	And in it there are three openings, two on one side and one on the other side, as you see.
Et locus concauus, in quo est illud quod impellit, sit secundum quantitatem quod opilet ipsum sine additione, donec quando trahitur cum eo aliquid, ex humiditatibus attrahatur: et quando impellitur, cum eo expellatur ad longinquum: secundum quod facit clepshydra, qua proiicitur naphta, id est, ignis graecus in praeliis martis.	And the concave place, where there is that which propels it, should be according to the quantity that it needs without addition, until when something is drawn out with it, it attracts from the humidities: and when it is propelled, it expels afar: according to what the clyster of Hydrangea does, which projects naphta, that is, Greek fire in the praeparations of Mars.
Cum ergo uis proiicere humiditates in uesicam, intromitte extremitatem clepshydrae in humiditatem, et trahe cum eo quod impellit ad superiora, humiditas enim trahitur in concauitatem clepshydrae.	When therefore you want to project humidities into the swollen area, insert the extremity of the clyster of Hydrangea into the humidity, and draw out with it what propels upwards, for the humidity is drawn into the concavity of the clyster.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem eius in uirgam, secundum quod narrauimus in siringa.	Then insert its extremity into the rod, according to what we have described in the syringe.
Deinde impelle humiditatem cum eo quod impellit illa namque humiditas peruenit ad uesicam statim, ita quod sentit eam infirmus.	Then propel the humidity with what propels it, for the humidity immediately reaches the swollen area, so that the weak person feels it.
Forma clisteris subtilis quo clisterizatur uesica.	The shape of a subtle clyster which clysterizes the swollen area.
Fiat ex argento, aut auricalco: cuius caput altius sit simile alcama paruo, et sub eo sinus inter quem cadat ligamentum.	Let it be made of silver or gold alloy: its head should be higher like a small hook, and below that a hollow where the ligament falls.
Deinde accipe uesicam arietis, et pone in ea humiditatem, qua uis clisterizare uesicam.	Then take a vein of a goat, and put humidity in it, by which you can inject the vein.
Deinde liga eam inter duos sinus ligatura forti cum filo duplo: et calefac illam humiditatem parumper super ignem.	Then bind it between two strong ligatures with double thread; and warm that humidity a little over the flame.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem clisteris in uirgam, postea stringe manum tuam super uesicam cum humiditate strictura decenti, donec sentiat infirmus, quod illa humiditas iam peruenit ad uesicam.	Then insert the extremity of the instrument into the vein, afterwards press your hand over the vein with humidity and tight structure, until it feels weak, because that humidity has now reached the vein.
Si autem non est tibi praesens uesica, tunc accipe frustum pergameni, et fac ex eo circulum, et perfora ipsum ab omni rotunditate sua.	If you do not have a vein present, then take a piece of parchment, and make a circle from it, and pierce it throughout its entire roundness.
Deinde intromitte filum forte in illis foraminibus, sicut reuoluuntur.	Then insert a strong thread into those holes, as they revolve.
Deinde aggrega circulum, sicut aggregatur alsofratu: postquam tu ponis in eo illud quod uis ex humiditatibus, et oleis, et aquis.	Then gather the circle, as it is gathered also to a writing tablet; afterwards you put in it what you want from humidity, and oils, and waters.
Deinde liga ipsum in instrumento: et fac cum eo sicut fecisti cum uesica ex expressione cum manu tua, donec perueniat humiditas ad uesicam.	Then bind it to the instrument: and do with it as you did with the vein from the expression with your hand, until the humidity reaches the vein.
Â¶ De extractione Lapidis.	On the Extraction of a Stone.
Caput LX.	Chapter 60.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Lapidis, et curationem eius cum medicinis: et dixi differentiam inter Lapidem generatum in renibus, et uesica, et signa illius totius: et dixi Lapidem in quo cadit operatio cum manu et sectio: et est Lapis generatus in uesica proprie: et ille qui figitur in uirga: et ego sum narrans illud cum expositione manifesta et abbreuiatione.	Now we have spoken in the division of the species of Stone, and its treatment with medicines: and I have said the difference between the Stone generated in the kidneys, and in the veins, and the signs of all of it: and I have said the Stone on which the operation falls with hand and section: and it is a Stone generated in the vein properly: and that which is fixed in the rod: and I am narrating this with clear exposition and abbreviation.
Dico ergo, quod Lapis generatus in uesica, plurimum accidit pueris.	I say therefore, that a Stone generated in the vein, happens most often to boys.
Et ex signis eius est, quod urina egreditur ex uesica similis aquae in subtilitate sua: et apparet in ea harena alba, et fricat infirmus uirgam suam, et laborat cum ea, et multotiens pendet.	And among its signs is, that the urine flows out of the vein similar to water in its subtlety: and there appears in it a white sand, and it rubs weakly against its own rod, and struggles with it, and often hangs.
Deinde erigitur, et egreditur cum eo anus in multis eorum.	Then it is elevated, and an anus is created with it in many of them.
Et est facilis sanatio puerorum, ex eo usquequo consequuntur quatuordecim annos.	And the healing of children is easy, because up to fourteen years old they are susceptible to it.
Et est difficilis in senibus.	And it is difficult in the elderly.
In iuuenibus autem est media, in eo quod est inter illud: et eius cuius Lapis est maior, curatio facilior: et si paruus, est econuerso illius cura.	In the young, however, it is moderate, because it is between that: and whose stone is larger, the treatment is easier; and if small, the care is reversed.
Cum ergo peruenimus ad curationem, oportet in primis, ut mundificemus infirmum cum clisteri, quod extrahat totum stercus quod est in intestinis suis: ipsum enim quandoque prohibet inuentionem Lapidis apud inquisitionem.	When we approach the cure, it is necessary first to cleanse the patient with a cluster, which removes all the feces that are in their intestines; for this prevents the descent of the stone during the operation.
Deinde accipiatur infirmus cum pedibus suis, et concutiatur, et moueatur ad inferiora: ut descendat Lapis ad profundum uesicae, aut saliat de loco alto aliquotiens.	Then the patient is taken by the feet and shaken, and moved downwards: so that the stone descends to the bottom of the bladder or jumps down from a high place several times.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas praeparatum, et manus eius sint sub coxis ipsius, ut fiat uesica tota decliuis ad inferiora.	Then make him sit between your hands prepared, and his hands are under his hips, so that the entire bladder is inclined downwards.
Deinde perquire eum, et tange eum extrinsecus.	Then press on him, and touch him externally.
Si ergo sentis Lapidem in spacio, tunc propera statim cum sectione super ipsum.	If you feel the stone in the space, then be ready at once with the incision over it.
Quod si non cadat sub tactu tuo omnino, tunc oportet ut abstergas digitum indicem cum oleo manus sinistrae, si infirmus est puer: aut digitum medium si est iuuenis completus: et intromittas ipsum in anum suum, et perquire de Lapide, donec stat sub digito tuo: et conuerte eum paulatim ad collum uesicae.	If it does not fall under your touch at all, then it is necessary to anoint the index finger with oil from your left hand, if the patient is a boy; or the middle finger if he is a young adult: and insert it into his anus, and press on the stone until it stands beneath your finger; and guide it slowly towards the neck of the bladder.
Deinde preme super ipsum cum digito tuo, et impelle ipsum ad exteriora aduersus locus, cuius sectionem uis: et praecipe ministro, ut premat uesicam manu sua, et praecipe alii ministro, ut extendat testiculos manu sua dextra ad superiora: et alia manu sua, ut remoueat cutem, quae est sub testiculis in parte a loco in quo est sectio.	Then press on it with your finger, and push it towards the exterior against the place of the incision: and instruct one assistant to press the bladder with his hand, and instruct another assistant to stretch out the testicles with his right hand upwards: and with the other hand to remove the skin that is beneath the testicles in the part from the place where the incision is.
Deinde intromitte Spatumile incidens, cuius forma haec est.	Then introduce the scalpel making an incision, whose form is this.
Et finde in eo quod est inter anum et testiculos, et non in medio, ad latus natis sinistrae: et sit sectio super ipsum lapidem, et digitus tuus sit in ano: et fiat sectio transuersa, ut sit sectio exterius ampla, et interius stricta, secundum quantitatem quod sit possibile egressio Lapidis ex ea non maior.	And find in it what is between the anus and testicles, and not in the middle, towards the left side of the loins: and let the section be above the stone, and your finger should be in the anus: and let the section be transverse, so that the external section is wide, and the internal one is strict, according to the quantity that it is possible for the stone to come out from there.
Fortasse enim comprimit digitus, qui est in ano Lapidem apud sectionem, et egreditur absque difficultate.	Perhaps indeed the finger, which is in the anus, compresses the stone at the section, and it comes out without difficulty.
Et scias, quod ex Lapide est cui sunt anguli et margines, quare fit difficilis exitus eius propter illud.	And know that the stone which has angles and margins is why its exit is difficult because of that.
Et ex eo est lenis, similis glandulae, et rotundus: et fit facilis egressus eius.	And it is smooth, similar to a gland, and rounded: and its exit becomes easy.
Ei ergo cui sunt anguli, et margines, adde in fissura.	To those which have angles and margins, add in the groove.
Quod si non egreditur ita, tunc oportet ut ingenies super ipsum: aut stringas super eum cum gesti decenter, cuius extremitas sit sicut Luna, quae stringat super Lapidem, et non euadat ab ea: aut ut intromittas sub eo instrumentum subtile, curuatae extremitatis.	What if it does not come out thus, then it is necessary to cleverly devise something over it: or to bind over it with a gesture of skill, whose extremity is like the Moon, which binds over the stone, and does not deviate from it: or to introduce beneath it an instrument of subtle curvature.
Si autem non potes super cum, tunc amplifica foramen parumper.	But if you cannot get above it, then enlarge the opening a little further.
Quod si uincit te aliquid ex sanguine, abscinde ipsum cum zegi.	What if something flows from the blood, cut it off with a thread.
Si uero lapis est plus quam unus, tunc impelle in primis magnum ad os uesicae.	If there is more than one stone, then push first the large one towards the mouth of the bladder.
Deinde incide super ipsum.	Then make an incision above it.
Postea impelle paruum post illud: et similiter fac si sunt plures duobus.	Afterwards push the small one after that: and do similarly if there are more than two.
Quod si magnus est ualde, tunc ignorantia est ut seces super ipsum sectione magna.	What if it is very large, then ignorance is to make a large section above it.
Quoniam accidit infirmo una duarum rerum, aut ut moriatur, aut accidit ei distillatio urinae assidua: proptera, quia non consolidatur locus omnino.	Since it happens to the weak one of two things, either that he dies, or that he suffers from continuous dripping of urine: therefore, because the place is not completely consolidated.
Verum administra expulsionem eius, donec egrediatur: aut ingenia in fractura eius cum forficibus, donec extrahas eum frustatim.	Here is the translation:
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc imple uulnus thure, et aloe, et sanguine draconis: et stringe ipsum, et pone super ipsum pannum infusum oleo et uino, aut oleo rosato, et aqua frigida: ut sedetur apostema calidum.	When you have completed the operation, then apply to the wound aloe and dragon's blood, and bind it with string, and put over it a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or rose oil, and cold water, so that a warm aposteme may form.
Deinde resupina infirmum super collum suum, et non soluas ligamentum, usque ad diem tertium.	Then prop up the wounded person on their pillow, and do not loosen the bandage until the third day.
Cum ergo solueris ipsum, embroca locum cum aqua, et oleo multo.	When you have loosened it, bathe the place with water and a great deal of oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dyafinicon, et unguento basilicon, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with dyaphinion ointment and royal ointment until it heals.
Si autem accidit in uulnere apostema calidum additum, et corrosi, et illi similia: sicut si congeletur sanguis in uesica, et prohibeatur ex eo urina: et cognoscitur illud ex egressione sanguinis cum urina.	If, however, a warm aposteme forms on the wound and becomes putrid, and similar things happen, such as if blood congeals in the bladder, and urine is blocked from it, and it is recognized by the flow of blood with urine.
Intromitte ergo digitum tuum in uulnus, et extrahe illum sanguinem.	Insert your finger into the wound and extract the blood from it.
Nam si remanet, prouocat ad corruptionem uesicae, et putrefactionem eius.	For if it remains, it causes corruption of the bladder and its putrefaction.
Deinde ablue uulnus cum aceto, et aqua, et sale: et oppone omni speciei cum eo quod conuenit ex curatione, usquequo sanetur.	Then wash the wound with vinegar and water and salt, and apply all kinds of things that are suitable for its cure, until it heals.
Et oportet in horis curationis totius, ut liges duas coxas, et aggreges, caussa medicinarum quae ponuntur super locum.	And it is necessary during the whole time of treatment to bind two hip-bones together and to assemble the medicinal causes that are applied to the affected area.
Quod si lapis est paruus, et sit in meatu uirgae, et figitur in eo, et prohibetur urinae exitus: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod narro antequam peruenias ad sectionem.	If the stone is small and is in the middle of the vein, and it becomes fixed there, and the passage of urine is blocked: then treat it with what I have described before you reach the cutting.
Multotiens enim a sectione excusaris per hanc curationem, iam enim probaui illud.	For many times indeed one excuses oneself from the cutting through this treatment, now indeed I have tried that.
Et est, ut accipias Perforatorium ex ferro alferico, cuius haec est forma, triangulatae extremitatis, acutum, fixum in ligno.	And it is, to receive a perforator made from iron of Alferic, whose shape is triangular at the pointed end, acute, fixed in wood.
Deinde accipe filum, et liga cum eo uirgam sub lapide ut non redeat ad uesicam.	Then take a thread and tie it with the vein under the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.
Deinde intromitte ferrum perforans in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat Perforatorium ad ipsum lapidem: et reuolue Perforatorium manu tua in ipso lapide paulatim: et coneris perforationem eius, donec facias ipsum penetrare a parte altera.	Then introduce the piercing iron into the vein with ease, until it reaches the perforator to that stone; and revolve the perforator with your hand in that stone slowly; and you will complete its perforation, until you make it penetrate from the other side.
Urina namque absoluitur statim.	The urine is immediately freed.
Deinde preme manum tuam super illud quod remansit ex lapide ab exteriori parte uirgae.	Then press your hand on what remains of the stone from the outer part of the vein.
Ipse enim frangitur, et egreditur cum urina, et sanatur infirmus.	For it is broken off, and comes out with the urine, and the sick person is healed.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi haec curatio, propter aliquid quod prohibet ab illo: tunc liga filum sub lapide, et filum aliud supra lapidem.	If, however, this treatment does not prepare itself for you, because of something that prevents it from that; then tie a thread beneath the stone, and another thread above the stone.
Deinde seca super lapidem in ipsa uirga inter duas ligaturas.	Then cut above the stone on that vein between the two ligatures.
Deinde extrahe ipsum.	Then extract it.
Postea solue ligamentum, et mundifica sanguinem congelatum, qui fit in uulnere.	Afterwards, loosen the ligature, and cleanse the congealed blood that forms in the wound.
Et non est necessarium ligamentum fili sub lapide, nisi ut non redeat ad uesicam: et ligamentum aliud desuper, nisi ut quando soluitur filum post egressionem lapidis, redeat cutis ad locum suum, et cooperiat uulnus: et propter illud necesse est tibi illud quando ligas filum superius, ut eleues cutem ad superiora, ut redeat apud complementum tuum, et cooperiat uulnus, sicut diximus.	And it is not necessary to tie a thread under the stone, unless so that it does not return to the bladder; and another ligature above, unless when the thread is loosened after the removal of the stone, the skin returns to its place, and the wound closes; and for this reason it is necessary for you to do that when you tie the thread above, to elevate the skin upwards, so that it returns to its complement, and the wound closes, as we have said.
Â¶ De extractione Lapidis mulierum.	Concerning the removal of a stone from women.
Caput LXI.	Chapter 61.
Parum generatur Lapis in mulieribus.	A stone is rarely generated in women.
Si autem accidat alicui earum lapis, tunc difficilis est curatio, et prohibetur propter modos multos.	But if it happens to one of them that a stone forms, then the treatment is difficult and is prohibited because of many reasons.
Vnus eorum est: quod mulier fortasse est uirgo.	One of their characteristics is: since a woman is perhaps a virgin.
Et secundus est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem quae detegat seipsam medico, quando est casta, aut ex habentibus maritos.	And the second reason is that you do not find a woman who reveals herself to a physician when she is chaste, or among those having husbands.
Tertius est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem bene scientem hanc artem, praecipue operationem cum manu.	The third is that you will not find a woman who knows this art well, especially in manual operations.
Et quartus est longinquitas a loco lapidis: quare indiget sectione profunda, et in illo est timor.	And the fourth is the remoteness of the location of the stone: because it requires a deep incision, and there is fear in that.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad illud, tunc oportet ut accipias mulierem medicam, bene scientem: et parum inuenitur.	What if necessity leads to that, then it is necessary to take a female doctor, well-versed: and few are found.
Si uero priuaris ea, tunc quaere medicum castum, subtilem, et praesenta mulierem obstetricem bene doctam in re mulierum, aut mulierem quae in hac arte innuit partem artis: fac ergo eam praesentem, et praecipue ei, ut faciat totum quod praecipis ei ex inquisitione super lapidem.	If you indeed possess these things, then seek a chaste doctor, subtle and presenting a well-taught female obstetrician in the matter of women, or a woman who has acquired part of this art: make her present, and especially entrust it to her, so that she does all that you prescribe to her from the inquiry about the stone.
In primis quod est, ut aspiciat si mulier est uirgo: tunc oportet ut intromittat digitum in anum eius, et quaerat lapidem.	Firstly, it is necessary to see if the woman is a virgin: then it is necessary that she inserts her finger into her anus and seeks the stone.
Si ergo inuenit ipsum, coartet eum sub digito suo, et tunc praecipe obstetrici, ut intromittat digitum suum in uuluam infirmae, et inquirat super lapidem, postquam ponit manum suam sinistram super uesicam, et comprimit eam compressione bona.	If she thus finds it, she grasps it under her finger, and then instruct the midwife to insert her finger into the womb of the infirm woman, and inquire about the stone, after placing her left hand on the bladder, and pressing it with a good compression.
Si ergo inuenit lapidem, tunc oportet ut gradatim moueat eum ab orificio uesicae ad inferiora cum summa uirtutis suae, donec perueniat cum eo ad radicem coxae.	If she thus finds the stone, then it is necessary that she gradually moves it from the orifice of the bladder to the lower parts with the utmost strength of hers, until she reaches it at the root of the hip.
Deinde secet super eum apud oppositionem medietatis uuluae apud radicem coxae, ex quacunque parte praeparatur ei, et sentit lapidem in illa parte: et digitus eius non remoueatur a lapide, coartans sub eo: et sit sectio parua in primis.	Then she should press upon it at the opposition of the middle of the womb at the root of the hip, from whichever part is prepared for her, and feels the stone in that part: and her finger does not move away from the stone, grasping under it: and let the incision be small at first.
Deinde intromittat radium super illam sectionem.	Then she should insert a scalpel above that incision.
Si ergo sentit lapidem, tunc addat in sectionem secundum quantitatem proportionatam quod lapis egreditur ab ea.	If she thus feels the stone, then she should add to the second incision a quantity proportional to what the stone emerges from it.
Et scias, quod species lapidis sunt multae.	And know that there are many types of stones.
Ex his enim est paruus, et magnus, lenis et asper, longus, et rotundus habens ramos.	For among them is small and large, smooth and rough, long and round with branching.
Scias ergo species eius, ut significetur tibi per hoc super illud quod uis.	Know therefore its types, that it may be signified to you through this above what you have seen.
Si ergo uincit te sanguis, tunc adde in loco zegi tritum, et tene ipsum hora una, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If therefore the blood overcomes you, then add to the place of the wound a triturated powder, and hold it for one hour, until the blood is staunched.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis: et fac, ut praepares tecum ex instrumentis, quae dixi in extractione lapidis in uiris, ut adiuueris per ea in operatione tua.	Then return to your operation, until the stone comes out: and make ready with you the instruments which I mentioned in the extraction of stones from the veins, so that you may be assisted by them in your operation.
Quod si uincit te fluxus sanguinis, et scis quod expulsio sanguinis est ex arteria quae incisa est: tunc pone puluerem super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis strictura decenti: et non mutes illud: et dimitte lapidem, et non extrahas ipsum.	What if the flow of blood overcomes you, and you know that the expulsion of blood is from the artery which was cut: then put a powder on the place, and bind it with suitable tight bandages: and do not move it: and leave the stone, and do not extract it.
Fortasse enim morietur mulier infirma.	Perhaps the weak woman may die.
Deinde cura uulnus.	Then treat the wound.
Cum ergo sedatur acuitas sanguinis post dies, et putrefit locus, tune redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis.	When therefore the sharpness of the blood has settled down after days, and the place has become putrid, then return to your operation, until the stone comes out.
Â¶ De sectione suiper Herniam aquosam.	About the surgical treatment of a hernia in watery places.
Caput LXII.	Chapter 62.
Ramex aquosa non est, nisi aggregatio humiditatis in sifac albo, quod est sub cute testiculi continente ouum: et nominatur sifac.	A watery hernia is not, unless it is an aggregation of humidity in the white layer, which is under the skin of the testicle containing a egg: and it is called a sifac.
Et quandoque est in panniculo proprio sibi, quem praeparauit ei natura in parte oui, donec putetur: quod est ouum aliud, et est cutis testiculi inter sifac album, quod diximus: et non fit illud nisi raro.	And when it is in its own proper membrane, which nature has prepared for it in the part of the egg, until it is put forth: which is another egg, and it is the skin of the testicle between the white sifac, as we said: and this does not happen unless rarely.
Et generatio quidem huius ramicis, est ex debilitate quae accidit testiculis: quare effunditur ad eos haec materia.	And the generation of this watery hernia is from the weakness that occurs in the testicles: therefore this matter flows out to them.
Et quandoque accidit ex percussione super testiculos.	And when it happens from a blow upon the testicles.
Et haec humiditas est habens colores multos.	And this moisture is having many colors.
Aut enim est color eius decliuis ad citrinitatem, aut est sanguineus rubeus, aut faeculentus, niger, aut est aquosus albus, et est illud quod est plus.	Either its color is inclined towards citrus, or it is red and bloody, or it is filthy and black, or it is watery and white, and it is that which is in addition.
Et signa quibus scitur ubi sit aggregatio aquae, sunt ista.	And the signs by which it is known where the accumulation of water is, are these.
Nam si est in sifac albo quod diximus, tunc apostema est rotundum ad longitudinem parumper sicut figura oui: et non apparet testiculus, quoniam humiditas continet eum ab omni parte.	For if it is in a white skin which we mentioned, then the abscess is round in length for a short time, just like an egg figure; and the testicle does not appear, because the moisture surrounds it on all sides.
Et si est humiditas in panniculo proprio sibi, tunc apostema est rotundum cum parte oui, et propter hoc extimat homo quia est ouum aliud.	And if the moisture is in its own proper membrane, then the abscess is round with an egg-like part, and because of this, a man thinks it is another egg.
Et si humiditas est inter cutem testiculorum et sifac album, tunc cadit sub sensu.	And if the moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the white skin, then it falls under the sense.
Quando ergo uis cognitionem coloris humiditatis, tunc experire colorem humiditatis in apostemate cum Intromisso quadrato, cuius forma praecessit.	When therefore you wish to recognize the color of the moisture, then experience the color of the moisture in the abscess with a square introgression, whose form has preceded.
Secundum illud ergo quod egreditur in uestigio Intromissi, iudica de illo quod est inter ipsum.	According to that which appears in the investigation of the introgression, judge about what is between itself.
Cum ergo uenimus ad curationem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, ut phlebotometur si possibile est ei illud, et uides corpus eius plenum.	When therefore we come to the treatment with iron, then it is necessary to warn the patient, so that they may be phlebotomized if possible, and you see their body full of it.
Deinde resupinetur super dorsum suum super rem altam parum, et pone sub eo pannos multos.	Then he should lean back on his back on a high mattress a little, and put many cloths under him.
Deinde sede tu super sinistram eius, et praecipe ministro, ut sedeat a dextra eius, qui extendat uirgam eius ad unum duorum laterum cutis testiculorum, et ad partem mirach uentris.	Then sit you on his left, and instruct the minister to sit on his right, who should stretch out his arm to one of the two sides of the skin of the testicles, and towards the belly's side.
Deinde accipe spatumile latum, et seca cutem testiculorum ex medio per longitudinem, usque prope pectinem: et fiat sectio secundum rectitudinem aequedistantis lineae quae diuidit cutem testiculorum, donec perueniat ad sifac album comprehendens: et excoria ipsum et obserua, uel caue ex hoc, ut seces ipsum: et sit excoriatio tua qua ipsum excorias, ex parte quae suspenditur cum ouo plus: et subtiliter scrutare cum excoriatione secundum quantitatem quod tibi possibile est.	Then take a broad spatula, and dissect the skin of the testicles from the middle along the length, up to near the perineum; and make an incision according to the straightness of the lines that divide the skin of the testicles, until you reach the white skin encompassing it; and excavate it and observe, or be cautious about this, so that you may dissect it: and your dissection should be where you dissect it, from the part that is suspended with an egg more; and subtly investigate with the dissection according to the quantity that is possible for you.
Deinde perfora sifac plenum aqua perforatione ampla, et extrahe totam aquam.	Then make a perforation full of water with a wide opening, and extract all the water.
Deinde separa inter duo labia sectionis cum uncinis, et extende sifac ad superiora, et non tangas cutem testiculorum comprehendentem: et incide sifac qualitercunque est possibile tibi incidere ipsum, aut cum totalitate sua, aut frustatim, praecipue latus eius subtile.	Then separate between the two labia of the section with hooks, and extend the sifa up to the superior, and do not touch the skin covering the testicles: and incise the sifa as far as possible for you to incise it, either in its entirety or partially, especially on its subtle sides.
Nam si tu non exquisite perscrutaris, in incisione eius non fit securitas, quin aqua redeat.	For if you do not make a thorough examination, there will be no security in the incision, lest water returns.
Si autem procedit ouum exterius a cute sua in hora operationis tuae: tunc quando compleueris sectionem sifac, reduc ipsum.	But if a fluid proceeds from its skin outside during the time of your operation: then when you have completed the section of the sifa, reduce it.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cutis testiculorum cum sutura.	Then bring together the two labia of the skin of the testicles with a suture.
Deinde cura ipsum sicut reliqua uulnera, donec sanetur.	Then treat it as you would other wounds, until it heals.
Quod si inuenis ouum corruptum ex nigredine alia, tunc oportet ut liges uasa, quae sunt suspensorium, timens fluxum sanguinis.	If you find a corrupted fluid from the blackness of something else, then it is necessary to tie up the vessels that are the suspension, fearing a flow of blood.
Deinde abscinde testiculum cum suspensorio, et extrahe ouum: postea cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then cut off the testicle with its suspension, and extract the fluid: afterwards treat it as I have said.
Si uero aqua est aggregata in duabus partibus, tunc scias quia sunt duae ramices: seca ergo partem aliam secundum quod fecisti in altera aequaliter.	If water has accumulated in two parts, then know that there are two branches: therefore cut off the other part equally according to what you did in the other.
Et si aequatur tibi, ut sit operatio una, tunc fac: deinde absterge sanguinem.	And if it is equal to you, so that there is one operation, then do it: then stop the bleeding.
Et intromitte in sectiones lanam submersam in oleo, aut in oleo rosato: et pone deforis lanam aliam quam submersisti in uino et oleo, et expande eam super duos testiculos, et mirach uentris: et pone desuper pannos duplicatos, et sunt puluilli: et liga eos desuper cum ligamento, quod est habens sex secundum hanc formam.	And insert a woolen thread soaked in oil, or in rose oil: and put before it a woolen thread which you have soaked in wine and oil, and spread it over the two testicles, and wonder at the belly: and put above double cloths, and they are poultices: and bind them above with a ligature, which has six knots according to this form.
Deinde sumantur duo panni, et suantur, et impleantur la na carminata, secundum hanc similitudinem: et fiant extremitates quibus premitur ex coto, aut lana humida: et aggregentur cum strictura in lumbari bracharum: et una extremitatum accipiat super anum usque ad dorsum, et secunda accipiat ad partem pectinis: et duae extremitates super duas coxas inferius, et duae extremitates aliae super duo inguina, et aggregetur strictura tota in lumbari bracharum.	Then two cloths are applied, and they are moistened, and filled with woolen threads, according to this likeness: and they are made into extremities which are pressed out of a pot, or humid wool: and they are gathered together with a bandage in the lumbar region of the arms: and one extremity receives above the anus up to the back, and the second receives towards the part of the chest: and two extremities above the two hips below, and two other extremities above the two groin areas, and the entire bandage is gathered together in the lumbar region of the arms.
Et, quandoque artificialiter medicatur haec ramex cum cauterio loco sectionis cum ferro: et est, ut accipias cauterium cultellare subtile, et seces cum eo cutem testiculorum: et est ignitum, secundum quod narrauimus: donec quando detegitur sifac album continens aquam: tunc accipe cauterium, secundum hanc formam.	And when you treat these ramex artificially with a cautery at the site of the incision with an iron; and it is, as if you were to receive a subtle cautery knife, and cut with it into the skin of the testicles: and it is ignited, according to what we have narrated; until when you discover a white album containing water: then take the cautery, according to this method.
Assimilatur literae graecae.	The Greek letters are assimilated.
Deinde perfora cum eo illud sifac, et est ignitum, donec egrediatur humiditas tota.	Then pierce with it that album, and it is ignited, until all the moisture escapes.
Deinde extende sifac cum uncinis, et excoria cum cauterio subtili ignito, et incide ipsum secundum quod possibile est tibi, donec eradices totum eius.	Then stretch out the album with hooks, and scrape it with a subtle, ignited cautery, and cut into it as much as possible for you, until you eradicate all of it.
Et caue ex ouo, ne tangat ipsum ignis.	And beware lest it touches the fire.
Et scias, quod haec operatio est saluior, et longinquior a fluxu sanguinis, et melior quam operatio cum sectione.	And know that this operation is more beneficial, and farther from a flow of blood, and better than an operation with incision.
Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit in hora sectionis, aut in hora cauterii apostema calidum, aut fluxus sanguinis, aut aliquid aliud: tunc oportet ut cures quod contrarietatem tibi facit ex illo cum curatione quae conuenit ei, secundum quod praemissum est.	If however it causes a contradiction to you at the time of incision, or at the time of cautery, or apostema warm, or flow of blood, or something else: then it is necessary that you should cure what causes the contradiction to you from that with a treatment that is suitable for it, according to what has been previously stated.
Si autem infirmus est timidus, et non expectat super hanc operationem, propter horribilitatem suam: tunc administra perforationem secundum quod ego narro illud: et est.	If however the patient is faint-hearted and does not expect to survive this operation, because of its dreadfulness: then administer the piercing according to what I narrate about it: and it is.
Quando certificatur tibi apud te per illud quod diximus de significationibus, quod ramex est aquosa: tunc oportet quod facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	When it is certified to you through what we have said about the signs, that the ramex is watery: then it is necessary that you should make the patient sit on an elevated seat.
Deinde perfora apostema in inferiori parte sui cum spatumili lato: et pone perforationem secundum longitudinem corporis, et sit apertio ampla, donec currat aqua tota.	Then pierce the apostema in its lower part with a broad spatula: and place the piercing according to the length of the body, and let the opening be wide, until all the water flows out.
Deinde pone super locum cotum, et liga ipsum, et dimitte ipsum ut currat residuum aquae: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then put it on a soft place, and bind it, and leave it to flow out the remaining water: then treat it, until the wound is healed.
Si autem contrarietas sit egressioni aquae in hora qua perforas ipsam: et non sit illud nisi propterea, quia panniculus albus contrarietatem facit in orificio uulneris, et prohibet exitum aquae: tunc oportet ut intromittas pennam in uulnus, aut instrumentum cum quo extrahitur aqua hydropicorum, cuius forma praecessit: aut adde in operatione uulneris parumper.	If however there is an obstruction to the flow of water at the time when it perforates it, and it does not happen except for this reason, because the white membrane creates an obstruction in the orifice of the wound, and prevents the exit of water: then it is necessary that you introduce a feather into the wound, or an instrument with which the watery fluid is extracted, whose form has been previously described: or add to the operation on the wound for a short time.
Et scias, quod aqua redit, et aggregatur post sex menses, aut circiter eos.	And know that the water returns and accumulates after six months, or around that time.
Cum ergo aggregatur, tunc pertoretur secundum eundem modum, et pertransibit infirmus dies suos.	When it therefore accumulates, then it should be pierced in the same manner, and the patient will pass through his days of weakness.
Â¶ De cura Ramicis carnosae.	On the treatment of fleshy wounds.
Caput LXIII.	Chapter 63.
Scias, quod in sectione super hanc Ramicem, est ex timore perducente ad perniciem in pluribus dispositionibus.	Know that in the incision above this wound, it is due to a prevailing fear of causing harm in many dispositions.
Quapropter uidetur mihi eius dimissio saluari ex ea.	Therefore, it seems to me that its neglect is more beneficial for its healing.
Et ego sum rememorans operationem in ea, et species apostematis.	And I am mindful of the operation on it, and the type of abscess.
Dico ergo, quod accidunt apostemata multa in corporibus, ex quibus componuntur testiculi: et fit illud ex caussis multis, scilicet.	I say therefore that many abscesses occur in the bodies, from which lumps are composed: and this happens due to many causes, namely.
Aut ex superfluitate acuta, uel acri, quae effunditur ad testiculos.	Or from an acute excess of sharp or sour humor that is poured out into the lumps.
Aut ex percussione.	Or from a blow.
Et est color apostematis secundum colorem corporis, et non inuenitur ei dolor: et est apostema graue.	And the color of the abscess is according to the color of the body, and no pain is found in it: and it is a grave abscess.
Et fortasse est apostema lapideum, cuius color est fuscus, et non est sensus ei.	And perhaps it is a stony abscess, whose color is dark, and there is no sensation in it.
Et quandoque fit ex nodatione arteriarum, et inflatione earum: sicut iam praecessit eius rememoratio: aut ex inflatione uenarum.	And sometimes it occurs from the knotting of the arteries, and their swelling: as I have already mentioned its description: or from the swelling of the veins.
Quod ergo est ex eis ex inflatione arteriarum, cognoscitur per dispositionem apostematis, quando comprimis ipsum digitis tuis.	Which therefore occurs from the swelling of the arteries, is recognized by the arrangement of the abscess, when you press it with your fingers.
Et non oportet ut tangas ipsum prorsus.	And it is not advisable to touch him hastily.
Illud uero quod fit ex inflatione uenarum, non dispergitur ex eo aliquid apud compressionem cum digitis.	That which arises from the inflammation of veins is not dispersed by anything through compression with the fingers.
Et iam possibile est, quod super hanc speciem fiat sectio, et super reliquas carnes: et est, ut seces cutem testiculorum.	And now it is possible that a section be made over this type, and over the remaining flesh: and it is, as if you were to cut the skin of the testicles.
Deinde extende ouum ad sursum, et extrahe ipsum cum sifach albo: et libera suspensorium ex uasis, et liga uasa: et incide suspensorium postquam tu liberas ipsum ab omni parte ex partibus oui.	Then extend the egg upwards, and extract it with a white sifak: and free the suspensory from the veins, and tie the veins: and cut the suspensory after you have freed it from every part of the egg.
Si ergo ouum consolidatum est cum illis carnibus natis, tunc oportet ut attrahas ouum, et incidas ipsum.	If therefore the egg is consolidated with those naturally born flesh, then it is necessary to draw out the egg, and cut it.
Et si adhaerentia est inter aliquid ex siphaket, aut in eo quod est inter uasa: tunc oportet ut liberes totam illam adhaerentiam, et incidas eam incisione rotunda.	And if there is adhesion between something from the sipak or in what is between the veins: then it is necessary to free the whole adhesion, and cut it with a round incision.
Si autem est natiuitas carnis in loco adhaerentiae quae est retro: tunc oportet ut incidas totum eius, et extrahas ouum, sicut diximus.	If, however, there is a nativity of flesh in the place of adhesion which is behind: then it is necessary to cut the whole of it, and extract the egg, as we have said.
Cum ergo completur operatio tua, tnnc imple uulnus in lana infusa in oleo rosato, et uino: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When therefore the operation is complete, then fill the wound with a wool pad infused in rose oil and wine: afterwards treat it with the remaining treatment, until it heals.
Â¶ De cura Ramicis, quae est cum Vite.	On the treatment of fistulae, which are with veins.
Caput LXIIII.	Chapter 63.
Uitis est apostema inuolutum quadam inuolutione, simile botro, cum mollificatione testiculorum: et fit difficilis super infirmum motus et exercitium, et deambulatio.	Ulcers are a hidden aposteme, wrapped in some wrapping, like a Botryos, with softening of the testicles: and it becomes difficult due to weak movement and exercise, and walking.
Et in curatione huius aegritudinis est ex timore, propter illud cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And in the treatment of this illness is from fear, because of that which preceded, namely reminiscence.
Verum oportet, ut dicamus operationem in ea secundum quod fecerunt primi.	It is true, we must describe the operation in it according to what the first ones did.
Dico ergo, quod oportet ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	I say therefore, that it is necessary to make the weak person sit on a raised seat.
Deinde impelle suspensorium testiculorum ad inferiora.	Then apply the supporting bandage to the lower testicles.
Deinde tene cutem testiculorum cum digitis tuis, cum uasis quae sunt propinqua uirgae: et teneat ea minister alius, et extendat ea extensione uehementi.	Then hold the skin of the testicles with your fingers, along with the nearby veins: and let another assistant hold them, and stretch them with a vigorous stretching.
Deinde incide cum spatumili lato acuto sectione transuersa in directo uasorum, donec detegantur uasa.	Then make an incision with a broad, sharp scalpel in a transverse section directly on the veins, until they are exposed.
Deinde excoria ab omni parte, sicut diximus tibi in extractione Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then strip away from every part, as we instructed you in the extraction of arteries that are in the temples.
Postea fige in eis acum in qua sit filum duplum, et liga ipsum in primo locorum quibus accidunt Vites: et liga ipsum iterum in ultimo eorum.	Next, place a thread in them where there is a double filament, and tie it in the first places to which the vitellus adheres: and tie it again at their ends.
Deinde seca ea in media sectione recta secundum longitudinem corporis, et extrahe quod aggregatur ex humiditatibus faeculentis corruptis.	Then cut them off in the middle section straight along the length of the body, and extract what is gathered from the foul, corrupt humors.
Deinde cura uulnus cum curatione reliquorum uulnerum, in quibus uis generari saniem, ut cadant uasa quae nutriunt unum testiculorum.	Then treat the wound with the treatment of other wounds, in which it is desired to generate healthy flesh, so that the vessels that nourish one testicle may fall.
Non est enim malum per illud.	It is not an evil through that.
Si autem accidat Vitis omnibus uasis, tunc oportet ut extrahantur propter hoc testiculi cum uasis: ut non priuetur ouum nutrimento, propter incisionem, et tabescat, uel arescat, et non sit iuuamentum cum eis.	But if the vitellus affects all the vessels, then it is necessary to extract the testicle with its vessels: so that it may not be deprived of nourishment, because of the incision, and it may not wither away, or become dry, and there may not be a remedy with them.
Â¶ De cura Ramicis intestinalis.	Of the treatment of an intestinal hernia.
Caput LXV.	Chapter 65.
Euentus huius Ramicis est ex sectione, quae accidit in sifach extenso super uentrem in parte inguinum ex mirach uentris.	The cause of this hernia is from a rupture, which occurs in the extended siphac above the navel on the inguinal part from the weakness of the belly.
Quare descendunt intestina ex illa Ruptura ad unum testiculorum.	Therefore, the intestines descend from that rupture to one of the testicles.
Et haec Ruptura est aut ex sifach, aut extensione eius.	And this rupture is either from the siphac or from its extension.
Et accidunt istae duae species ex caussis multis: aut ex percussione, aut saltu, aut clamore, aut eleuatione rei grauis, et similibus.	And these two types occur from multiple causes: either from a blow, or a fall, or a shout, or the lifting of a heavy object, and similar things.
Et signum, quando est ex extensione sifach.	And the sign is when it is from an extension of a sifach (fistula).
Est quod accidit paulatim in tempore longo, et non accidit subito: et est apostema aequale uersus profundum: propterea, quod sifach comprimit intestinum.	It is what happens gradually over a long period of time, and does not happen suddenly: and it is an equal abscess opposite the deep (part); therefore, because the fistula compresses the intestine.
Et signum eius quando est ex sectione sifach, quia facit accidere ex principio sui dolorem uehementem subito: et est apostema diuersum, apparens sub cute propinque: et illud est propter exitum intestini, et cursus eius ad exteriora sifach.	And the sign of it is when it is from a section of the fistula, because it causes sudden severe pain from the beginning: and it is a diverse abscess, appearing under the skin nearby; and that is on account of the exit of the intestine, and its course to the exterior fistula.
Et quandoque egreditur cum intestino zirbum: et nominatur haec Ramex intestinalis, et zirbia: et quandoque fit cum uentositate.	And when it goes out with the intestine a mixture: and this is called Intestinal Ramex, and Zirbia: and when it happens with flatulence.
Et quandoque currit in intestinum stercus, et retinetur illic: et est cum eo pernicies infirmi: quoniam facit accidere dolorem prauum, et praecipue quando premitur.	And when feces flows into the intestine and is retained there: and it is with that a grave danger to the patient: because it causes a foul pain, and especially when it is pressed.
Et in curatione specierum aegritudinis huius cum ferro est timor: quare oportet ut caueatur casus in ea.	And in the treatment of this type of illness with iron, there is fear: because it is necessary to beware of accidents in it.
Et modus operationis est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut reducat intestinum manu sua ad interiora concauitatis suae, si obedit reditui.	And the method of operation is, to press on the patient, so that he reduces his intestine with his own hand to its inner concavity, if it has returned to its proper place.
Deinde resupinetur super collum suum inter manus tuas: et eleua crura eius.	Then it should be supported above the neck with your hands: and elevate his legs.
Deinde extende cutem quae sequitur cutem ad superiora, et seca cutem testiculorum totam per longitudinem.	Then stretch out the skin that follows the skin to the upper parts, and separate the entire skin of the testicles along its length.
Deinde fige in duobus labiis sectionis uncinos, secundum quod indiges ad aperiendum sectionem cum eis: et sectio sit secundum quantitatem, quod sit possibile, ut egrediatur ex ea ouum.	Then fix two hooks of the section in the curved lips, according to what you need to open the section with them: and let the section be according to the quantity that is possible, so that an egg may exit from it.
Deinde excoria siphak, et quae sunt sub cute testiculorum, donec quando detegitur sifach album, durum ab omni parte: tunc intromitte digitum tuum indicem in eo quod sequitur testiculum, in eo quod est inter siphach album, quod est sub cute oui, et inter sifach secundum, et absolue cum eo adhaerentiam quae est in posteriori parte oui.	Then scrape away the sipach, and what is under the skin of the testicles, until when the white fistula is detected, hard on every side: then insert your index finger into what follows the testicle, in what is between the sipach and the album, which is under the skin of the egg, and between the fistula, according to what adheres to the posterior part of the egg.
Deinde moue cum manu dextra ad interiora cutem testiculorum: et cum hoc extende sifach album ad sursum, cum manu sinistra: et eleua ouum cum sifach ad partem sectionis: et praecipe ministro, ut extendat ouum ad sursum: et tu solue adhaerentiam, quae est retro solutione completa.	Then, with your right hand, you should reach inside to the inner cut of the testicles; and with this, stretch the sifach album upwards with your left hand; and lift the ovum with the sifach towards the part being sectioned; and order the assistant to stretch it upwards; and you should release the adhesion that is behind, which is a complete solution.
Et quaere digitis tuis, ut non sit aliquid illic ex intestino inuoluto in sifach albo duro.	And feel with your fingers to ensure that there is nothing from the intestine wrapped around the sifach album in a hard lump.
Si autem inuenis ex eo aliquid: tunc impelle ipsum ad uentrem inferius.	But if you find something from it, then push it down towards the lower abdomen.
Deinde accipe acum, in qua sit filum grossum, factum licinium ex decem filis: et intromitte ipsam apud postremum sifach, id est, tunicae, quod est sub cute testiculorum quae sequitur sectionem: deinde incide extremitates quae eminent ex filo, donec sint quatuor fila.	Then take a needle, on which is a thick thread, made into a licinium from ten threads; and insert it beneath the last sifach, that is, the tunica, which is under the cut of the testicles that follows the section; then cut the ends that emerge from the thread, until there are four threads.
Deinde compone quaedam eorum super quaedam cum figura quae sit in modo crucis: et liga cum eis alsifach, de quo diximus, quia est sub cute testiculorum ligamento uehementi, donec non possit aliquod ex uasis, quae nutriunt eos mittere ad eos aliquid: ut non accidat inde apostema calidum.	Then arrange some of them above others in a figure that is in the shape of a cross; and tie them with the sifach, which we mentioned earlier, because it is under the cut of the testicles with a strong ligament, so that nothing from the vessels that nourish them can pass to them or give them something: lest there be an outbreak of hot apostema.
Et pone iterum ligamentum secundum extra ligamentum primum, longinquum ab eo minus duobus digitis.	And place the second ligament outside the first ligament, at a distance of less than two fingers from it.
Et post ista duo ligamenta dimitte ex sifach, quod est sub cute testiculorum, quantitatem magnitudinis digiti: et incide reliquum totum secundum rotunditatem, et aufer ex eo ouum.	And after these two ligaments, release from the sifach, which is under the cut of the testicles, a quantity the size of a finger; and cut the remaining whole part according to its roundness, and remove the ovum from it.
Deinde seca in inferiori parte cutis testiculorum sectione, ex qua currit sanguis, et sanies: sicut narrauimus in eo quod praemissum est.	Then sever the lower part of the cut of the testicles from which blood and serum flow, as we described in the previous passage.
Deinde administra lanam submersam in oleo, et pone in uulnus: et administra ligamentum quod narrauimus.	Then apply a woolen pad soaked in oil and place it on the wound; and apply the ligament that we described.
Et quandoque cauterizatur sifach album quod diximus, post incisionem eius timendo de fluxu sanguinis.	And when the album of sifach is cauterized, which we mentioned earlier, it is afterwards tense from the flow of blood after the incision.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	For it often happens that way.
Et dimitte ligamentum, donec cadat per se.	And let go of the ligament until it falls by itself.
Si autem tardatur casus eius, tunc embrocetur cum aqua calida: et pone super ipsum illud quod diximus, donec cadat.	If, however, its fall is delayed, then it is fomented with warm water; and place on it what we mentioned earlier, until it falls.
Deinde cura uulnus cum reliqua curatione uulnerum, donec curetur.	Then treat the wound with the remaining treatment of wounds, until it is cured.
Â¶ De Ramice uentosa.	Concerning the gas-producing hernia.
Caput LXVI.	Chapter 66.
IN Hac Ramice non uidi aliquem qui ausus fuerit super curationem eius cum ferro.	In this hernia, I have not seen anyone who has dared to attempt its cure with an iron instrument.
Et primi quidem dixerunt, quod fit sicut narrauimus in Ramice quae est cum Vite.	And the first ones indeed said that it happens just as we narrated concerning hernias that are with a vein.
Quod est, ut liges uasa post sectionem super ea cum facilitate inferius: deinde seca in medio, et cura postremo cum eo quod aperit ipsum, donec cadant uasa: et cura uulnus, secundum quod diximus, donec sanetur.	That is, to bind the vessels after the section above them with facility below: then cut in the middle, and treat afterwards with what opens it, until the vessels fall; and treat the wound, according to what we said, until it is healed.
Â¶ De disruptione quae fit in inguinibus.	Concerning the rupture that occurs in the groin.
Caput LXVII.	Chapter 67.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, sicut diximus, et eminet locus, et non descendit ad testiculos aliquid ex intestinis: et si descendit, est illud parum, et redit in omnibus horis: uerum si prolongatur cum ea tempus, additur fissura in sifach, donec descendunt intestina in sifach.	When a rupture occurs in the groin, as we said, and a place bulges out, but nothing from the intestines descends to the testicles: and if it does descend, it is little, and returns at all hours: truly if it is prolonged with that time, a fissure is added in the sifach, until the intestines descend into the sifach.
Et accidit illud ex extensione sifach, quod est in inguinibus, sicut diximus.	And it happens from the extension of the sifach, which is in the groin, as we said.
Quod est, quia extenditur sifach: deinde mollificatur, et apostematur locus, et eminet.	That is, because the sifach is extended: then it becomes soft, and the place becomes inflamed, and bulges out.
Et cura eius est cum cauterio, sicut praecessit eius narratio.	And its treatment is with cauterization, as the preceding narrative has gone before.
Et quandoque curatur cum ferro, secundum hunc modum: et est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum inter manus tuas.	And when it is treated with an iron instrument, according to this method: and it is, as if the weak one lies on his back between your hands.
Deinde seca locum Rupturae apostematum et eminentem, sectione per latitudinem, secundum quantitatem trium digitorum.	Then dissect the place of the ruptured and swollen aposteme, cutting across the width, according to the quantity of three fingers.
Deinde stringe alsifak et, quae sunt sub cute, donec quando detegitur sifach album, quod est sub cute quae sequitur ipsum.	Then strip away the Alsifak and those things which are under the skin, until when the Sifach is detected white, which is under the skin that follows it.
Tunc accipe radium, et pone ipsum super locum eminentem ex sifach, et preme ipsum ad profundum uentris.	Then take a scalpel, and place it upon the swollen spot of the Sifach, and press it deeply into the belly.
Deinde sue duo loca eminentia super extremitatem radii ex sifach, et annecte cum sutura unum eorum cum altero: deinde extrahe extremitatem radii.	Then two swollen spots on the extremity of the radius from the Sifach, and connect one of them with the other by a suture: then extract the extremity of the radius.
Et non incidas alsifach omnino, neque tendas ouum, neque aliud, sicut feci te scire in curatione ramicis intestinalis.	And do not cut into the Alsifak at all, nor stretch a vein, nor anything else, as I have made you aware of in the treatment of the intestinal obstruction.
Deinde cura illud curatione uulnerum.	Then heal that wound with a cure.
Cum ergo incidis fila, mundifica illud, et restaura uulnus, donec consolidetur.	When you have made the incision, cleanse it, and restore the wound, until it becomes consolidated.
Sisach enim contrahitur, et non additur eminentia Rupturae.	For the swelling is reduced, and no prominence of the Rupture is added.
Et cauterium est melius in hoc loco: quoniam est propinquius ad salutem.	And cauterization is better in this place: because it is closer to health.
Â¶ De mollificatione cutis testiculorum.	On the softening of the skin of the testicles.
Caput LXVIII.	Chapter 68.
Multotiens mollificatur cutis testiculorum in quibusdam hominibus, propter quod mollificantur carnes quae sunt inter ea, et foedatur aspectus eius.	The skin of the testicles is often softened in certain men, because the flesh that is between them is softened, and their appearance becomes foul.
Ergo necesse est ei qui rogatur in curatione eius, ut faciat iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et incidat totam cutem quae mollificata est super cutem naturalem.	Therefore it is necessary for the one who is asked to cure him, to make the weak part lie on his back, and to incise the entire skin that has been softened above the natural skin.
Deinde aggreget duo labia cum sutura: et si uis, sue in primis superfluitatem cutis mollificatae tribus suturis, aut quatuor, et firma suturam.	Then bring together the two lips with a suture: and if you wish, first above the excess of the softened skin three or four sutures, and make a firm suture.
Deinde incide inter sututuras.	Then incise between the sutures.
Deinde cura curatione reliquorum uulnerum, usquequo sanetur, et cadant fila.	Then treat the remaining wounds with a cure, until they are healed, and the threads fall out.
Â¶ De Castratione.	About Castration.
Caput LXIX.	Chapter 69.
Scias, quod Castratio in lege nostra excommunicata est: et propter illud liceret mihi, ut non rememorarer eius in libro meo isto: et non est necessaria rememoratio eius, nisi propter duos modos.	You know that Castration is forbidden by our law and because of this it would be permitted to me not to mention it in my book, and there is no need to recall it unless for two reasons.
Quorum unus est, ut sit illud in scientia medici quando interrogatur de ea: et ut sciat curationem eius cui accidit.	One of which is that it should be known by the medical scientist when he is asked about it, and so that he may know the treatment of one to whom it happens.
Et modus alter est, quod nos multotiens indigemus castratione quorundam animalium, propter iuuamenta nostra per illud, sicut arietum, hyrcorum, et gattorum, et similium ex animalibus.	And the other method is that we often need to castrate certain animals for our own benefits through it, such as goats, gazelles, and cats, and similar ones from among the animals.
Dico ergo, quod Castratio fit secundum duos modos.	I say therefore that Castration is done according to two methods.
Aut per attritionem.	Or by attrition.
Aut per fissuram, et sectionem.	Or by fissure and section.
In illa autem quae fit per attritionem, uia operationis est: quod nos faciamus sedere animal in aqua calida, donec mollificentur testiculi eius, et leniantur, et pendeant: deinde attere eos manu tua, donec resoluantur et non appareant sub tactu.	In that one which is done by attrition, the method of operation is this: we make the animal sit in hot water until its testicles soften and relax and hang down; then we massage them with our hand until they dissolve and do not appear to the touch.
In castratione autem per fissuram et sectionem, oportet ut teneas animal, et premas cutem testiculorum eius cum manu sinistra.	In castration by fissure and section, it is necessary to hold the animal, and to press the skin of its testicles with your left hand.
Deinde liga suspensorium, et seca super omne ouum sectione una, donec quando procedunt duo oua: tunc incide ea postquam excoriaueris utrumque, et non dimittas super ea ex sifaket aliquid praeter sifac subtile, quod est super uasa.	Then tie the suspensor, and cut above each ovum in one section, until two ova proceed: then incise after you have excavated both, and do not leave anything on them except a subtle sifa, which is above the vessels.
Et iste modus castrationis est melior eo qui fit per attritonem: quoniam attritio fortasse relinquit aliquid ex testiculis, quare desiderat animal coitum.	And this method of castration is better than the one done by attrition: because attrition perhaps leaves something behind in the testicles, wherefore the animal desires coitus.
Deinde cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Then treat the wound, until it heals.
Â¶ De cura Hermafroditae duorum modorum.	About the treatment of Hermaphrodites of two methods.
Caput LXX.	Chapter 70.
Hermafrodita ex uiris est secundum duos modos.	The Hermaphrodite is treated from men according to two methods.
Vnus eorum est, quia apparet in eo quod sequitur spacium, aut in cute testiculorum, in eo quod est inter duos testiculos, figura quasi uulua mulieris, in qua sunt pili: et quandoque currit urina ex eo quod est in cute testiculorum.	One of them is the vein that appears in it, following a space, or in the cut of the testicles, in what is between the two testicles, having a figure like that of a woman's vulva, in which there are hairs; and sometimes urine flows out from what is in the cut of the testicles.
In mulieribus autem est species una, et est uulua mulieris super pectinem sicut testiculi uiri parui omnino, eminentes ad exteriora: quorum unus est sicut priapus uiri, et duo sicut duo testiculi.	In women, however, there is one type, and it is the vulva of a woman above the pubic bone, just like the small testicles of a man, projecting outward: of which one is like the priapus of a man, and two are like the two testicles.
Et curatio trium specierum, duarum ex uiris, et speciei unius ex mulieribus, est: quia oportet ut incidas carnes additas, donec effugiat impressio earum.	And the treatment of these three types, two from men and one type from women, is: because it is necessary to cut away the extra flesh until the impression of them disappears.
Deinde cura eas curatione reliquorum uulnerum.	Then care for the remaining wounds with the usual treatment.
In specie autem secunda uirorum, ex qua egreditur urina, quae est in cute testiculorum, non est operatio, neque est eius curatio omnino.	In the second type of men, from which urine flows out, which is in the cut of the testicles, there is no operation, nor is there any treatment for it at all.
Â¶ De incisione Tentiginis, et carnis eminentis in uuluis mulierum.	On the incision of the tightness, and of the protruding flesh in the vulvas of women.
Caput LXXI.	Chapter 71.
Tentigo fortasse additur super rem naturalem, donec foedatur et turpis fit aspectus eius: et quandoque magnificatur in quibusdam mulieribus adeo, donec expanditur sicut in uiris, et peruenit usque ad coitum.	Perhaps the tightness is added above the natural thing, until it becomes foul and its appearance is disgusting: and sometimes it grows so much in certain women that it expands like in men, and reaches all the way to copulation.
Oportet ergo ut teneas superfluitatem Tentiginis manu, aut cum uncino, et incidas: et non ultimes in incisione, praecipue in profundo radicis: ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	It is necessary therefore to hold back the excess of the tightness with the hand, or with a hook, and to cut: and not to cut too deeply in the incision, especially at the root: so that there may not be a flow of blood.
Deinde cura ipsam curatione uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then take care to treat the wound with the usual treatment, until it heals.
Caro autem orta, est caro quae nascitur in orificio matricis, donec impleat ipsum: et fortasse egreditur ad exteriora secundum similitudinem caudae: et propter illud quidam primi nominant aegritudinem caudatam.	But the flesh that grows is the flesh that is born in the orifice of the womb, until it fills it: and perhaps it protrudes outward like a tail: and because of this some people first call it a tail-like disease.
Oportet ergo ut incidamus eam sicut incidimus Tentiginem, et curemus eam, donec sanetur.	It is therefore necessary that we cut into it just as we cut into a tenderness, and treat it, until it heals.
Â¶ De cura Alratica, quae est uulua mulieris non perforata.	Concerning the treatment of a varicose vein of a woman's vulva that is not perforated.
Caput LXXII.	Chapter 72.
Alratica est, ut sit uulua mulieris non perforata, aut sit foramen paruum.	A varicose vein is when it is a woman's vulva that is not perforated, or if it is a small opening.
Et est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	And it is either natural or accidental.
Accidentalis est ex aegritudine quae praecessit: et ipsa quidem fit aut ex carne nata addita, aut sifach subtili, aut spisso: et fit aut in profundo matricis, aut in lateribus eius, aut in superiore ipsius, aut inferiori eius: et prohibet a coitu et impregnatione, et partu, et fortasse prohibet menstrua.	The accidental one is from an illness that precedes it, and indeed it becomes either from added flesh born naturally, or from subtle siphach, or from thickness; and it occurs either in the depths of the womb, or on its sides, or on its upper part, or lower part; and it prevents from intercourse and conception, and childbirth, and perhaps prevents menstruation.
Et cognitio illius fit per aspectum obstetricis, si opilatio est apparens propinqua.	And the recognition of it is made through the obstetrician's observation, if the obstruction is apparently nearby.
Si autem non est apparens, tunc quaere eam digitis tuis, aut cum radio.	If, however, it is not apparent, then you examine it with your fingers, or with a probe.
Si autem opilatio est ex sifach subtili, et est propinqua duobus labiis: tunc propera, et disrumpe ipsam.	If, however, the obstruction is from subtle siphach, and it is near the two labia: then you probe, and break it apart.
Et est, ut ponas super duo labia puluillos.	And it is, that you place on the two labial paps.
Deinde pone indices tuos duarum manuum simul, et mulier sit super dorsum suum expansis cruribus suis.	Then put your indices of both hands together, and let the woman sit with her back bent forward, spreading her legs.
Deinde extende duo labia cum fortitudine, donec disrumpatur sifach subtile, et aperiatur opilatio.	Then stretch out the two labia with force, until the subtle siphach is broken apart and the obstruction is opened.
Deinde accipe lanam, et imbibe eam in oleo, et pone ipsam super locum: et coeat mulier omni die, ut non consolidetur locus uice alia.	Then take a thread, and soak it in oil, and put it on the spot: and let the woman sit on it every day, so that the place is not consolidated again otherwise.
Si autem sifach est grossum, spissum: tunc oportet ut seces ipsum cum spatumili lato simili folio myrti.	If, however, the siphach is thick and dense: then it is necessary to cut it with a broad spatula-like instrument similar to a myrtle leaf.
Si autem opilatio est ex carne nata, tunc suspende eam cum uncinis, et incide eam: et sint tecum medicinae quae fluxum sedant sanguinis absque mordicatione, sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus aggregatum cum albugine oui.	If, however, the obstruction is from naturally born flesh, then suspend it with hooks, and cut into it: and have with you medicines that calm the flow of blood without causing biting, such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and thus combined with egg white.
Deinde administra cannulam ex plumbo amplam, ut non consolidetur uulnus uelociter, teneat eam diebus aliquot: et administra licinium ex lino sicco, deinde curetur reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then administer a wide cannula of lead, so that the wound may not close too quickly, and hold it in place for several days. Then apply a dressing made of dry linen, and afterwards proceed with the remaining treatment until healing occurs.
Et quandoque nasciur in matrice natiuitas carnium aliarum: oportet ergo ut incidantur secundum hunc modum: dum non est apostema cancerosum apostemati enim canceroso quod est in matrice, non fiat contrarietas cum ferro omnino.	And when there is a birth of abnormal fleshy growths in the womb: it is therefore necessary to incise them in this manner, provided that it is not a cancerous aposteme, for if it is cancerous and located in the womb, it should not be opposed with iron at all.
Â¶ De cura hemorroidarum, Athehelil, et Bothor rubeae in uuluis mulierum.	On the treatment of hemorrhoids, Athelil, and red swellings on the vulva of women.
Caput LXXIII.	Chapter 73.
Hemorroides quidem sunt apertio orificiorum uenarum, donec currit ex eis sanguis multus assidue.	Hemorrhoids are indeed the openings of the veins, so that much blood flows out from them constantly.
Cum ergo antiquantur hemorroides, fiunt thelil: et iam dixi in diuisione species earum, et signa ipsarum: et dicam hic quae ex eis recipiunt curationem, et quae non.	Since hemorrhoids are ancient, they become habitual: and I have already spoken about the division of their types, and their signs; and I shall say here which ones receive treatment, and which do not.
Dico ergo, quod hemorroides quae sunt in orificio matricis, et non apparent sensui: tunc non est ei curatio cum ferro.	I say therefore that hemorrhoids which are in the opening of the womb and do not appear to the senses: then there is no treatment for them with iron.
Quae autem ex eis sunt in orificio matricis super quas cadit sensus, sunt quae curantur.	But those which are in the opening of the womb and upon which the sense falls, are those that can be treated.
Oportet ergo ut intromittas mulierem in domum frigidam.	It is therefore necessary to introduce the woman into a cold house.
Deinde extende athehelil cum forficibus, aut cum panno aspero, et incide eas ex radicibus suis.	Then extend Athelil with forceps, or with a rough cloth, and cut them out from their roots.
Deinde pulueriza super eas apud fluxum sanguinis ex uno puluerum incisiuorum absque mordificatione: sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus, et similia eis.	Then powder them with a powder made from the blood of one of the powdered ingredients without biting, such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and thus, and similar things.
Deinde impellat pedes eius ad parietem hora una.	Then apply her feet to the wall for one hour.
Postea depone eam in aquam frigidam.	Afterwards, put her in cold water.
Quod si perseuerat fluxus sanguinis: tunc fac eam sedere in decoctione sumach, et corticum granatorum, et gallarum, et similium.	If the flow of blood persists: then make her sit in a decoction of sumach, and cortex of pomegranates, and gallic, and similar things.
Deinde accipe farinam hordei, et confice eam cum melle et aceto, et fac emplastrum cum eo super dorsum eius.	Then take barley meal and mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a plaster with it on his back.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis cum eo, bonum est: et si non, fac adhaerere dorso uentosas, et mammillis, absque scarificatione.	If then the blood is cut off with it, it is good; and if not, make adhere to the back of the ribs and breasts, without scarification.
Deinde accipe lanam, et submerge in succo tarathit, aut succo arnoglossae, aut succo ramorum alaulat, id est, aglanter, uino pontico, et fac adhaerere loeo.	Then take a woolen cloth, and soak it in the juice of tartarite, or the juice of arnoglossa, or the juice of the leaves of agraula, that is, of aglanter, wine of Pontus, and make it adhere to the place.
Cum ergo quiescit apostema, tunc cura locum cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	When then the aposteme (abscess) quiets down, then treat the place with ointments until it is healed.
Albarth uero rubeum est simile capitibus alhaasse, et est asperi aspectus.	The Albarth ulcer is similar to the heads of alhaasse and has a rough appearance.
Oportet ergo ut incidas quod apparet ex eo, secundum quod dixi in thelil aequaliter: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	It is necessary therefore that you cut what appears from it, according to what I said equally in the lil; and treat it until it is healed.
Â¶ De perforatione Exiturae quae accidit in matrice.	Concerning the perforation of the uterus which occurs in the womb.
Caput LXXIIII.	Chapter 83.
Accidunt in matrice species multae apostematum, sicut cancer, et apostema lapideum, et ulcera, et adubelati, et alekilati, id est, herpes, aestiomemus, et fistulae, et hemorroides, et ragadiae, et thelil, et apostema calidum.	There occur in the womb many species of abscesses, such as cancer, and stony abscess, and ulcers, and putrid matter, and corrupt humors, that is, herpes, aestiomemus, and fistulas, and hemorrhoids, and ragadiae, and thelil, and hot abscess.
Et ego quidem iam dixi omnes has aegritudines et species earum, et signa ipsarum, et earum curationes in diuisione: necesse est ut dicam in hoc tractatu apostema calidum quod accidit in matrice, quando est ex apostematibus quae colligunt saniem, et uis scire qualiter fit eius apertio cum ferro.	And I have already said all these diseases and their species, and their signs, and their cures in the division: it is necessary that I speak of hot abscess in this treatise, which occurs in the womb, when it comes from abscesses that gather pus, and you should know how its opening is done with an iron instrument.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	It is necessary therefore that you consider.
Tunc si dolor apostematis in incaeptione sua est acutus cum percussione sua, et flamma, et febre: et uides ipsum rubere: si cadit super ipsum sensus, tunc non properes cum perforatione eius: et cura ipsum cum eo eo quod iuuat super maturationem, donec quando quiescat acuitas accidentium.	Then if the pain of the abscess in its inception is acute with percussion and flame and fever: and you see it red: if sense falls upon it, then do not hasten with its perforation: and treat it with what helps above maturation, until when the sharpness of the accident quiets down.
Tunc oportet ut facias sedere mulierem super sedem quae labeat duo sedilia, et reclinetur, uel appodietur super dorsum suum, et aggreget pedes suos ad partem inferiorem uentris: et sint coxae eius expansae, et ponat brachia sua sub genibus suis, et liget utraque ligamento conueniente ad illud.	Then it is necessary to have the woman sit on a seat with two armrests, and recline or lean back on her back, and bring her feet together at the lower part of her belly: and let her hips be expanded, and place her arms under her knees, and tie them with a suitable ligature for that purpose.
Deinde sedeat obstetrix a latere dextro, et administra instrumentum quo aperitur orificium matricis.	Then the midwife should sit on the right side, and administer the instrument by which the opening of the womb is revealed.
Cuius forma uenit in eis quae sunt post.	Whose form comes into those things that are behind.
Et oportet quando uis administrare hoc instrumentum, ut figas cum Radio profundum matricis mulieris: ut non sit illud quod ingreditur ex instrumento plus, quam profundum matricis, et laedat infirmam.	And it is necessary when you wish to administer this instrument, that you penetrate with the rod to the deep part of the womb of the woman: so that what enters from the instrument is not more than the depth of the womb, and harms the weak woman.
Si autem fuerit instrumentum magis quam profundum, tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos super tecturam profundi matricis: ut prohibeatur introitus instrumenti totius in profundum matricis: et oportet ut ponat uertiginem, quae currit in instrumento, ex latere superiore: et ut teneat instrumentum, et ut reuoluat minister uertiginem, donec aperiatur profundum matricis.	If the instrument is more than the depth, then it is necessary to place small pads on the covering of the deep womb: so that the entrance of the whole instrument into the deep womb is prevented: and it is necessary to place a turning point, which runs on the instrument, from the upper side: and to hold the instrument, and to revolve the minister's turning point, until the deep womb is opened.
Cum ergo apparet Exitura, et tangitur manu, et est lenis et mollis: tunc oportet ut seces ipsam apud caput suum cum spatumili lato.	When therefore the exit appears, and is touched by hand, and it is gentle and soft: then it is necessary to cut it at its head with a broad spatula.
Cum ergo euacuatur sanies, tunc oportet ut ponas in uulnus licinium submersum in oleo rosaceo: aut oleo uiridi, in quo sit quaedam stipticitas: et pone licinium, et extrahe sectionem in profundo matricis.	When therefore the blood is evacuated, then it is necessary to place a clean linen cloth submerged in rose oil or green oil, in which there is some stipingency: and place the linen, and extract the section from the deep womb.
Et pone exterius super matricem, et super pectinem lanam mundam submersam in aqua, in qua bullitae sunt maluae.	And place it outside on the womb, and on the perineum a clean woolen cloth submerged in water, in which there are boiled mallows.
Deinde curetur post duos dies cum unguento quod conuenit ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then it should be treated after two days with an ointment that is suitable for that, until it heals.
Et quandoque abluitur matrix et uulnus, ita quod clisterizatur cum aqua et melle: deinde cum aqua in qua bullita est radix lilii, aut aristolochia longa: deinde redeat ad unguentum.	And when the womb and vulva are washed, so that it is cleansed with water and honey: then with water in which the root of lily or Aristolochia Longa has been boiled: then return to the ointment.
Quod si uulnus absconditum fuerit interius in matrice, tunc oportet ut prohibearis ex curatione eius cum ferro, imo cura ipsum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione.	If a hidden wound is within the matrix, then it is necessary to probe it with an iron instrument during treatment, or to take care of it with what we have mentioned in the division.
Â¶ Doctrinae Obstetricum, qualiter medicentur embriones uiui, secundum figuram non naturalem egressi.	The teachings on obstetrics, how they [doctors] treat embryos that are alive, born against their natural form.
Caput Lxxu.	Chapter 70.
Necesse est Obstetrici, ut cognoscat in primis figuram partus naturalis.	It is necessary for the obstetrician to recognize first the natural form of the fetus.
Ex signis ergo eius est, quod quando uides mulierem comprimi ad inferiora, et desiderat odorare aerem, et alleuiatur super eam quod super ipsam est de partu, et festinat exitus embrionis: tunc scias quod iste partus est secundum figuram naturalem, et est exitus eius super caput suum, et secundina cum eo: aut suspensa, uel pendens ex umbilico.	The sign of this is that when you see a woman pressing down below, and she desires to smell the air, and is relieved above what is on her regarding the fetus, and hastens the exit of the embryo: then know that this fetus is according to its natural form, and its exit is upon its head, and the afterbirth with it: or suspended, or hanging from the navel.
Cum ergo uides haec signa, tunc oportet ut comprimatur uenter eius, ut descendat embrio uelociter.	When you see these signs, then it is necessary to press her womb, so that the embryo may come down quickly.
Nam quando descendit super caput suum, descendit secundina cum eo, et mundatur ex illis superfluitatibus mundificatione bona.	For when it comes down upon its head, the afterbirth comes down with it, and is cleansed of those excessive impurities by a good cleansing.
Qui autem est praeter hunc partum, est innaturalis, illaudabilis.	But one that is beyond this fetus is unnatural, to be condemned.
Quoniam quandoque egreditur foetus super pedes suos, et egreditur corpus eius ante caput ipsius, et pedes eius, et manus eius una, aut pes eius unus: aut egreditur caput eius et manus eius: aut egreditur uentrinus: et fortasse conuertitur super collum suum, et similia ex figuris illaudabilibus.	Because sometimes the fetus comes out feet first, and its body comes out before its head, and one foot or one hand: or its head and one hand come out: or its belly comes out: and perhaps it turns upon its neck, and similar things from unnatural forms.
Necesse est ergo Obstetrici, ut sit prudens, subtilis in istis rebus omnibus, et caueat sibi ab errore et decaeptione: et ego sum ostendens omnem figuram ex eis, et qualiter est ingenium in ea, et significetur per illud, et stetur super ipsum.	It is necessary for the obstetrician to be prudent and subtle in all these things, and to beware of error and deception: and I am showing every form from them, and how it is ingenious in that, and is signified by that, and stands upon it.
Quando egreditur foetus super caput suum egressione sua naturali, et uehemens fit illud super mulierem, et difficilis fit ei partus, et uides uirtutem eius iam debilitatam: tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, aut mulieres teneant eam: et uapora uuluam eius cum foenugraeco decocto, et cum oleis humidis.	When the fetus comes out headfirst in its natural exit, and it is difficult for the woman, and the birth is hard for her, and you see that her strength is already debilitated: then make her sit on a seat, or let the women hold her: and apply warm vapors to her womb with a decoction of fenugreek, and with humid oils.
Deinde intromittat Obstetrix inter digitos suos Spatumile paruum, et findat cum eo secundinam, et secet eam ungue suo, donec currat quod est in ea ex humiditate: et preme uentrem mulieris, donec descendat foetus.	Then the midwife inserts a small spatula between her fingers and feels with it, and touches the second finger of hers, until she feels what is there from the moisture; and she presses on the woman's womb, until the fetus descends.
Si autem non descendit, tunc oportet ut clisterizetur mulier ex mucillagine foenugraeci, cum oleo sisamino.	But if it does not descend, then it is necessary that the woman be anointed with a clyster of fenugreek mucilage, mixed with sesame oil.
Deinde praecipe ei post clistere, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi, et tene os eius et nasum ipsius hora una.	Then advise her to compress herself after the clyster, and make her sneeze with a concoction, and hold her nose and mouth for one hour.
Foetus enim egredietur statim.	For the fetus will come out immediately.
Quod si egrediantur duae manus foetus in primis, iunc oportet ut reducas eas cum facilitate paulatim.	If two hands of the fetus appear first, then it is necessary to reduce them with gentle facilitation little by little.
Si autem non obedit in introitu, tunc pone mulierem super sedem, et eleua pedes eius sursum: deinde concute sedem super terram: et mulier teneatur, ut non cadat apud concussionem.	But if it does not obey at the entrance, then put the woman on a chair, and elevate her feet upwards; then strike the chair against the ground; and let the woman hold herself, so that she may not fall at the concussion.
Si ergo non egrediuntur manus, et moritur foetus: tunc incide eas, et extrahe residuum foetus: et liga manum eius cum panno, et extrahe ipsum cum aequalitate: nam ipse egredietur.	If therefore the hands do not come out, and the fetus dies: then cut them, and extract the remaining part of the fetus; and bind her hand with a cloth, and extract it with equality: for it will itself come out.
Â¶ Exitus embrionis super pedes suo.	The exit of the embryo on its feet.
Quando egreditur foetus super pedes suos, tunc oportet ut impellat eos sursum: deinde conuertat foetum paulatim: postea aequet ipsum.	When the fetus comes out onto its feet, then it is necessary to push them upwards; afterwards, turn the fetus little by little; subsequently, adjust it.
Deinde accipiat unum pedum eius, et extendat eum paulatim.	Then take one of its feet and extend it little by little.
Cum ergo egrediuntur usque ad coxas, tunc praecipe ei, ut comprimatur, et fac eam sternutare cum condisi: egredietur enim, si Deus uoluerit.	When they come out as far as the hips, then advise her to compress herself, and make her sneeze with a concoction; for it will come out, if God wills.
Et si non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc reduc foetum paulatim, donec ponas eum secundum figuram naturalem.	And if it does not come out with what we have described, then reduce the fetus little by little, until you place it according to its natural figure.
Nam ipse egredietur tunc egressu facili.	For it will itself come out then with an easy delivery.
Quod si prohibeatur cum eo toto quod narrauimus: tunc accipe ex mucillagine alteae, et oleo sisamino, et gummi soluto: et percute totum in mortario percussione bona: deinde line cum eo uuluam mulieris, et inferius uentris eius.	If it is prohibited with the entire thing that we have narrated: then take from the mucilage of the altaea plant, and oil of sisaminum, and dissolved gum: and pound everything thoroughly in a mortar with good pounding. Then smear it on the wound of a woman's vulva, and apply it beneath her belly.
Deinde fac eam sedere in aqua tepida, donec consequatur hypocundria.	Then have her sit in warm water until she feels hypochondria.
Cum ergo uides quod iam calefacta sunt inferiora eius, tunc fac ei sief de myrrha: et suppone ipsum.	When you see that the lower parts of hers are already warmed up, then make her a supplication of myrrh; and apply it.
Quando ergo tenet sief hora una, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	When she holds the supplication for one hour, then have her sit on a seat.
Deinde fac eam sternutare: et stringe ipsius os et nasum: et preme inferiorem partem uentris compressione facili.	Then make her sneeze; and press her mouth and nose shut; and press the lower part of the belly with easy compression.
Nam foeus egredietur statim.	For the fetus will come out immediately.
Â¶ Exitus foetus super genua et manus.	The exit of the fetus on its knees and hands.
Quando egreditur secundum hanc formam, tunc ingeniet in intromittendo manus suas paulatim.	When it comes out according to this method, then one should gently introduce their hands little by little.
Deinde resupinetur mulier super collum suum, et pendeant pedes eius ad inferiora: et ipsa sit iacens super lectum, et complicet manus suas.	Then the woman should be raised above her neck, and her feet should hang down below: and she herself should sit on a bed, and clasp her hands.
Deinde preme supra uentrem eius paulatim.	Then press gently above her belly.
Deinde extrahe quod est sub pedibus eius ex puluinaribus, donec sit praeparata in inferiori parte.	Then extract what is beneath her feet from the pillows, until it is prepared in the lower part.
Quod si non egreditur foetus, tunc accipe pedes eius, et moue eos motu uehementi.	If the fetus does not come out, then take her feet and move them with a vigorous motion.
Deinde preme quod est supra hypocundria paulatim, donec ascendat foetus ad superiora.	Then press what is above the hypochondrium gently, until the fetus ascends to the upper parts.
Deinde intromittat manus suas, et aequet foetum paulatim: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimatur, donec egrediatur foetus.	Then introduce their hands and adjust the fetus gently: and instruct the woman to press, until the fetus comes out.
Â¶ Exitus foetus latitudinaliter pendens ex manibus.	The exit of the fetus, hanging widthwise from the hands.
Ingenietur in reductione manus eius.	It is gently introduced into the reduction by her hands.
Si autem non potest reducere eam, tunc eleua mulierem, et fac eam ambulare.	If she cannot reduce it, then raise the woman, and make her walk.
Si uero ambulare non potest, tunc fac eam iacere super lectum: et concute crura eius concussione uehementi.	If he is unable to walk, then make him lie on a bed and strike his hips with a vigorous concussion.
Deinde administra linimentum quod praeparasti ex mucillaginibus.	Then administer the liniment you prepared from poultices.
Quod si accipit eam partus, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	If he receives that treatment, then make him sit on a seat.
Deinde stude in reductione manus, et aequa foetum secundum figuram naturalem: et fac sternutare mulierem, et praecipe ei, ut comprimat se, donec egrediatur.	Then study the reduction of the hand, and adapt the fetid flesh according to its natural shape: and make the woman massage it, and instruct her, that she should press until it comes out.
Â¶ Exitus foetus super collum suum, expansis manibus, et est facies eius ad dorsum matris suae.	The fetus exits over its neck, with hands stretched out, and its face is towards the mother's back.
Oportet ut teneat Obstetrix manum foetus, deinde reuoluat eum paulatim, et aequet eum cum facilitate.	It is necessary that the midwife holds the fetus' hand, then turns it gradually, and adapts it with ease.
Cum ergo aequatur, tunc pone super uuluam eius quod narrauimus ex oleo et mucillaginibus.	When it is adapted, then put on its belly what we have prepared from oil and poultices.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut moueatur paulatim.	Then instruct her to move it gradually.
Cum ergo feceris illud, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, et praecipe ei ut inclinetur ad latus dextrum.	When you have done that, then make her sit on a seat, and instruct her to lean towards the right side.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi.	Then instruct her to press: and make her massage with condition.
Â¶ Exitus foetus praeparati super latus.	The prepared fetus exits onto the side.
Quando descendit ad orificium matricis secundum hunc modum cum secundina, tunc scinde secundinam cum ungue tuo, donec euacuetur ex humiditate.	When it descends to the maternal orifice according to this method with the afterbirth, then separate the afterbirth with your finger, until it is evacuated from the moisture.
Si ergo suspenditur super faciem foetus, et collum eius, tunc incide eam ex umbilico: ut non retineatur, et moriatur.	If it is suspended over the face of the fetus and its neck, then cut it away from the navel: so that it is not retained, and does not die.
Deinde impelle foetum ad interiora, donec ponas eam secundum quod oportet: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimat se aliquotiens: ipse enim egredietur exitu leui.	Then push the fetus towards the interior, until you place it according to what is fitting: and instruct the woman to press herself several times: for it will indeed come out with a gentle exit.
Â¶ Exitus Geminorum, aut foetuum multorum.	The birth of twins, or many fetuses.
Scias, quod Gemini multotiens nascuntur: et quandoque nascuntur tres, et quatuor.	You know that twins are often born: and sometimes three, and four.
Verumtamen illud extraneum est, et raro contingit.	However, that external thing is rare and rarely happens.
Quinque uero est res extra naturam, et non uiuunt penitus: et continet eos, quamuis multiplicentur, secundina una: et separantur per sifach, distinguens inter eos ligatum in umbilico cuiusque eorum.	There are five things beyond nature, and they do not penetrate deeply; and they contain them, although they are multiplied, a secondary one; and they are separated by a suture, distinguishing between them the ligament in each of their navels.
Et quandoque egrediuntur sicut egreditur foetus unus exitu naturali, facili: et egrediuntur exitu illaudabili, sicut narrauimus.	And when they emerge as a fetus emerges by natural exit, easily; and they emerge by unnatural exit, as we have narrated.
Quod si difficiles fuerint quidam eorum apud partum, et perueniunt ad illud quod diximus ex figuris innaturalibus, tunc cura eos sicut narrauimus: et sit ob stetrix subtilis, et faciat quod facit cum facilitate et tarditate, et ingenietur secundum omnem figuram cum eo quod praeparatur ei ex ingenio ducente ad salutem.	If some of them are difficult at the parturition, and they reach what we said from unnatural figures, then treat them as we have narrated; and let there be a subtle and skilled hand, and let it do what it does with facility and tardiness, and let it be ingenious according to every figure with that which is prepared for him from the leading genius for health.
Â¶ Rememoratio eius quod formatur in matrice ex embrionibus, et abortiuntur.	The reminder of what is formed in the womb from embryos, and are aborted.
Quandoque formatur in matrice unus, et duo, et tres, et quatuor, et quinque, et sex, et septem, et plures decem: et iam uerificatum est apud me, quod mulier abortiendo emisit septem, et alia quindecim, omnes formatos.	When one is formed in the womb, and two, and three, and four, and five, and six, and seven, and more than ten: and it has been verified by me that a woman aborting has ejected seven, and another fifteen, all fully formed.
Quod factum est mensuratione gloriosi sapientis.	Which was done with the measurement of the glorious wise one.
Hoc ergo totum oportet ut sit in scientia Obstetricis.	This therefore is entirely necessary for it to be in the science of Obstetrics.
Fortasse enim perueniet ad eam simile illius: opponat ergo ei cum illo quod oportet	Perhaps indeed it will reach that similar thing: therefore, let him oppose it with what is necessary.
Â¶ De extractione foetus mortui.	On the extraction of a dead fetus.
Caput LXXVI.	Chapter 76.
Quando curas foetum mortuum cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex medicatione, et non egreditur, et cogeris uti operatione cum manu, tunc oportet ut consideres.	When you treat a dead fetus with what I said in the division from medication, and it does not emerge, and you are forced to use manual operation, then it is necessary to consider.
Si ergo mulier est sanae uirtutis, et non est cum aliquo ex accidentibus, ex quibus timetur super eam perditio: tunc oportet ut resupinetur mulier super lectum, super dorsum suum, et sit caput eius inclinatum inferius, et crura eius eleuata: et ministra teneat eam a duabus partibus, aut ligetur ad lectum, ut non extrahatur corpus eius apud extractionem foetus.	If the woman is of sane virtue and not with any of the accidents from which loss is feared regarding her, then it is necessary for the woman to be placed on a bed, on her back, and her head is inclined downwards, and her thighs are elevated: and an assistant should hold her from both sides or bind her to the bed, so that her body does not move about during the extraction of the fetus.
Deinde humecta os matricis ex oleis humidis cum mucillagine alteae, et foenugraeci, et seminis lini.	Then moisten the womb of the mother with humid oils of flaxseed and linseed, and of fenugreek.
Deinde inungat Obstetrix manum suam cum istis oleis et mucillaginibus: deinde intromittat eam in matricem cum facilitate.	Then the midwife should anoint her own hand with these oils and flaxseed paste; then she should insert it into the womb with ease.
Deinde quaerat cum ea locum in quo figat uncinos ex foetu, et loca conuenientia ad illud.	Then she should feel for the place where the umbilical cord is attached to the fetus, and find a suitable location for that.
Considera ergo tunc, si foetus est praeparatus ut descendat super caput suum: tunc fige uncinos in oculos eius, aut in collo eius, aut in ore eius, aut in palato ipsius, aut sub barba eius, aut in furcula ipsius, aut in locis propinquis costis, et sub hypocundriis.	Consider therefore then, if the fetus is prepared to descend headfirst: then fix the umbilical cord on its eyes, or on its neck, or in its mouth, or on its palate, or under its beard, or on its armpit, or on the adjacent places of its ribs, and under its hip joints.
Si autem descensus est super pedes eius, tunc in pectine, et costis eius mediis.	But if the descent is feet first, then on its pubic bone, and its middle ribs.
Et oportet, ut teneat uncinum cum manu dextra: et ponat curuitatem eius in eo quod est inter digitos sinistrae manus: et intromittat cum manu cum facilitate, et figat uncinum in aliquo illorum locorum quae diximus, donec perueniat ad rem uacuam.	And it is necessary to hold the umbilical cord with the right hand; and place its curvature between the fingers of the left hand; and insert it with ease, and fix the umbilical cord in one of those places we mentioned, until it reaches the empty space.
Deinde figat in oppositione eius uncinum alium, aut tertium, si indiges: ut sit contractio aequalis, et non declinet ad partem.	Then fix another umbilical cord opposite to it, or a third if necessary: so that the contraction is equal, and does not decline to one side.
Deinde extendatur extensione aequali, et non sit extensio secundum rectitudinem tantum, imo moueatur ad omnem partem, ut alleuietur exitus eius: sicut fit cum dente apud eradicationem eius.	Then it should be extended with equal extension, and not be straightened only in one direction, but rather moved to every part, so that its outcome is alleviated: just as it is done with a tooth during its extraction.
Et oportet in eo quod est inter illud, ut mollificetur extensio.	And it is necessary in this, that the extension be softened.
Quod si retineatur ex eo pars, tunc oportet ut inungat Obstetrix quosdam digitos cum oleo, et intromittat eos ex parte, ut reuoluat cum eis quod retinetur.	If a part of it is retained within, then the midwife should anoint certain fingers with oil and insert them from that side, so that she may revolve what is retained.
Si ergo egreditur pars foetus, tunc permutentur uncini ad locum alium qui sit altior: fac hoc donec egrediatur foetus totus.	If a part of the fetus emerges, then the umbilical cords should be transferred to another place which is higher: do this until the entire fetus emerges.
Si ergo egreditur manus ante alia, et non est possibile reducere eam, propter coartationem eius: tunc oportet, ut inuoluatur super eam pannus.	If therefore the hand protrudes before the others and it is not possible to reduce it because of its stiffness, then it is necessary to wrap a cloth around it.
Deinde extrahe eam donec quando egreditur tota, incide eam aut in iunctura plantae, aut in cubito: et ita oportet ut facias in manu altera, et in duobus pedibus.	Then extract it thus when it protrudes entirely, either by cutting into the joint of the sole or in the elbow; and so it is necessary to do in the other hand and in both feet.
Si autem caput foetus est magnum, aut accidit ei coartatio in exitu, aut est in capite eius aqua aggregata: tunc oportet ut intromittat inter digitos Spatumile spinosum, et findat cum eo caput, et extrahat aquam: aut disrumpat ipsum cum instrumento quod nominatur Almisdac: cuius forma uenit cum formis reliquorum instrumentorum in capitulo quod est post hoc.	If however the head of the fetus is large, or stiffness occurs to it at birth, or there is water accumulated in its head: then it is necessary to introduce a spatula with spiny edges between the fingers and to find the head with it, and to extract the water: or to dissect it with an instrument called Almisdac, whose form is mentioned along with the forms of other instruments in the chapter that comes after this.
Similiter faciat si foetus est magni capitis natura, tunc oportet ut seces algengematu: aut extrahas ipsum cum misdach, sicut diximus.	Likewise, if the fetus is of a large-headed nature, then it is necessary to cut off the cartilage; or extract it with a misdach, as we have said.
Deinde attrahas ossa cum forcipibus.	Then grasp the bones with forceps.
Quod si egrediatur caput, et coartetur apud furculam: tunc findatur, donec effundatur humiditas quae est in pectore.	If the head protrudes and is stiff at the shoulder-blade, then it is found, until the moisture that is in the chest is poured out.
Si autem non complicatur, neque obedit ad exitum: tunc incide caput frustatim, secundum quod possibile est tibi.	If however it does not become entangled and does not obstruct the birth, then cut the head a little at a time, according to what is possible for you.
Quod si inferius uentris est apostematum, aut est in eo hydropisis: tunc oportet ut perfores ipsum, donec currat humiditas ex eo.	If the lower part of the womb is inflamed, or there is dropsy in it, then it is necessary to perforate it, until the fluid flows out from it.
Si uero foetus est super pedes suos, tunc attractio eius est facilis, et directio eius ad os matricis est leuis.	If indeed the fetus is on its feet, then its extraction is easy, and its direction to the mouth of the womb is light.
Si autem coartatur apud uentrem, aut pectus: tunc oportet ut extrahas ipsum cum panno quem inuoluisti super manum tuam: et findat uentrem, aut pectus, donec currat quod est in eis.	If however it is stuck at the womb or chest, then it is necessary to extract it with a cloth that you wrapped around your hand; and explore the womb or chest until what is in them flows out.
Si autem auferuntur reliqua membra, et redit caput: tunc intromittat Obstetrix manum sinistram.	If however the remaining limbs are delivered and the head returns, then the midwife should insert her left hand.
Si ergo os matricis est apertum, tunc intromittat manum in profundum matricis, et quaerat cum ea caput, et attrahat ipsum cum digitis usque ad os matricis: deinde intromittat in eo uncinum unum, aut uncinos duos, et attrahat ipsum cum eo.	If the maternal os is open, then he inserts his hand deeply into the maternal os, and feels with his fingers around the head, and draws it out with his fingers to the maternal os: then he inserts one hook or two hooks, and draws it out with them.
Quod si os matricis coartatur, propter apostema calidum quod accidit ei: tunc non oportet ut laboretur super ipsum, imo oportet tunc administrare effusionem rerum humidarum, pinguium: et administra emplastra: et sedeat in aquis quae mollificant et humectant.	What if the maternal os is constricted, because of a warm aposteme that has happened to it? Then it is not fitting to exert oneself upon it, but rather one should then administer an effusion of humid things, greasy: and apply a poultice: and sit in waters that mollify and humidify.
Quod si foetus est super latus suum, tunc possibile est ut aequetur: tunc administretur quod diximus in foetu uiuo.	What if the fetus is lying on its side, then it is possible to straighten it: then one should administer what we said about a living fetus.
Quod si non est possibile illud, tunc incidatur frustatim, et extrahatur.	What if it is not possible, then the fetus should be dismembered piecemeal and extracted.
Et oportet ut non dimittas aliquid ex secundina intus omnino.	And it is necessary that you do not leave anything of the secondine inside at all.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc administra quod diximus in apostematibus calidis quae accidunt in matricibus.	When you have completed your operation, then administer what we said about warm apostemes that occur in the matrices.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc descendat in aquis stipticis, et administra reliquam curationem.	What if a flow of blood occurs, then one should sit in astringent waters and administer the remaining treatment.
Et ego quidem iam uidi mulierem, in cuius uentre mortuus erat foetus: deinde impregnata est super ipsum uice alia, postea mortuus est foetus alius etiam.	And I have seen a woman, in whose womb a dead fetus was: then she was pregnant with another on top of it, afterwards another fetus also died.
Accidit ergo ei post tempus longum apostema in umbilico suo, et inflatum est, donec apertum est: et coepit emittere pus.	Then a long time afterwards, an aposteme developed on her navel, and it became swollen, until it opened up: and it began to discharge pus.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius, et medicatus sum ei tempore longo: et non consolidatum est uulnus.	I was called therefore to her cure, and I treated her for a long time: but the wound did not consolidate.
Posui ergo super ipsum ex quibusdam emplastris fortis attractionis: et exiuit ex loco os.	I applied therefore upon it certain strong attractant poultices: and it emerged from its place, the os (pelvic bone).
Deinde praeterierunt ei dies aliquot, et exiuit os aliud.	Then several days passed, and another os emerged.
Miratus sum ergo inde, cum in uentre non sit os.	I was astonished therefore, since there is no os in the womb.
Cogitaui ergo, quia erant ex ossibus foetus mortui.	I thought about it, therefore, because they were from the bones of a dead fetus.
Inquisiui ergo uulnus, et extraxi ossa multa, muliere existente in melioribus dispositionibus suis: et iam uixit taliter tempore longo, et mittit ex loco pus parum.	I investigated further and extracted many bones, while the woman was in better positions for herself; and already she had suffered thus for a long time, and a small amount of pus came out from the place.
Et ego non firmaui hic hoc extraneum, nisi quoniam in eo est scientia, et adiutorium ad illud, quod administrat medicus artifex cum manu ex curatione.	And I did not firmly establish this external thing, unless there is knowledge in it, and assistance for that which the medical artisan administers with his hand from the healing.
Â¶ De formis Instrumentorum necessariorum in extractione foetus.	On the forms of necessary instruments for extracting a fetus.
Caput LXXVII.	Chapter 77.
Hic inferius est forma Strictorii, quo aequantur libri, cui aequaliter sunt duae uertigines in duabus extremitatibus duorum lignorum.	Here is described the form of a Stricter, which is equal to books, which have two equal vertigos at the two extremities of the two wooden pieces.
Verumtamen haec Vertigo oportet ut sit subtilior strictorio: et ut fiat, aut ex ebano, aut ex ligno bussi.	However, this Vertigo ought to be more subtle than the Stricter; and so that it may be, either made from ebony or made from boxwood.
Et sit latitudo omnis ligni quasi duo digiti: et margo cuiusque amborum est quasi digitus unus, et longitudo cuiusque eorum est palmus et medietas: et in medio duorum lignorum sunt duo additamenta ex genere eiusdem ligni, quae iam firmata sunt in utrisque, quorum longitudo est medietas palmi et plus parum: et latitudo utriusque est quasi duo digiti, aut plus parum.	And the width of all the wood is about two fingers; and the edge of each of them is about one finger, and their length is a palm and a half; and in the middle of the two wooden pieces are two additions of the same kind of wood, which are already fixed on both, whose length is a half-palm and a little more; and the width of each is about two fingers, or a little more.
Et ista duo additamenta intromittuntur in os matricis, ut aperiatur cum eis quando tu reuoluis duas Vertigines.	And these two additions are inserted into the maternal passage, so that they open with them when you turn the two Vertigos.
Forma Vertiginis qua aperitur matrix.	The form of a Vertigo which opens the womb.
Forma alia ad simile illius, subtilior, et leuior.	Another form similar to that, more subtle and lighter.
Fiat ex ligno ebani, aut bussi, secundum similitudinem forcipum.	Let it be made from ebony wood or boxwood, according to the similarity of forceps.
Verumtamen in extremitate eius sint duo additamenta, sicut uides hic supra: et longitudo omnis additamenti ex eis est quasi palmus: et latitudo utriusque est, duo digiti.	However, at the extremity of it there are two additions, as you see here above; and the length of each addition from them is about a palm; and the width of each is two fingers.
Cum ergo uis aperire matricem cum eo, tunc fac sedere mulierem super lectum, pendentibus pedibus eius, aperto quod est inter crura eius.	When therefore you are about to lay bare the womb with it, then make the woman sit on a couch, hanging her legs, with what is between her thighs open.
Deinde intromitte ista duo additamenta coniuncta in matricem: et tu es tenens extremitatem instrumenti inferius inter coxas eius.	Then introduce these two connected additions into the womb; and you, holding the end of the instrument below, between her hips.
Deinde aperi manum tuam cum instrumento, sicut facis cum forficibus, aequaliter secundum quantitatem quam uis ex apertione oris matricis, donec faciat Obstetrix quod uult.	Then open your hand with the instrument, just as you do with forceps, equally according to the quantity that you wish to open the mouth of the womb, until the obstetrician does what she wants.
Forma Vertiginis alterius quam dixerunt antiqui Forma Impellentis quo impellitur foetus.	The shape of a turning other than which the ancients said is the shape of a pushing force by which the fetus is pushed out.
Forma Almisdac, qua conteritur caput magnum: et assimilatur forcipi, cui sunt dentes in extremitate, sicut uides.	The shape of Almisdac, where the large head is restrained, and it is made similar to forceps, which have teeth at the end, as you see.
Et quandoque fit oblungum, sicut forcipes secundum hanc formam, sicut uides, cui sunt dentes sicut dentes serrae, quo inciditur et conteritur.	And when it is made oblong, like forceps according to this shape, as you see, which have teeth like saw-teeth, by which it is cut and restrained.
Forma Almisdac quo conteritur caput paruum.	The shape of Almisdac, where the small head is restrained.
Forma Vncini habentis spinam unam.	The shape of a ring having one spine.
Forma Vncini habentis spinas duas.	The shape of a ring having two spines.
Forma forcipis cui sunt dentes serrae, cum quo conteritur caput foetus.	The shape of forceps which have saw-teeth, by which the head of the fetus is restrained.
Forma Spatumilis habentis duas extremitates ad abscindendum caput.	The shape of a spatula-like instrument having two extremities for cutting off the head.
Forma duorum Spatumilium etiam latorum.	The shape of two broad spatula-like instruments.
Ista instrumenta omnia exercentur, et quanto plus multiplicantur species eorum, et praeparata sunt apud artificem, est uelocior ad operationem suam, et altior apud homines, propter quantitatem suam.	All these instruments are exercised, and the more their types are multiplied, and they are prepared by the craftsman, it is easier for their operation, and more esteemed by men, because of their quality.
Non ergo despicies ex eis instrumentum, quin sit apud te praeparatum.	Do not therefore despise any of these instruments, as long as it is prepared by you.
Inexcusabilis est enim necessitas eorum.	For the necessity of them is inexcusable.
Â¶ De extractione Secundinae.	Concerning the extraction of the Afterbirth.
Caput LXXVIII.	Head 78.
Quando retinetur Secundina apud partum, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmae, ut retineat anhelitum suum.	When the secondine is retained at the site of the wound, then it is necessary to treat the weakened area, so that it retains its own breath.
Deinde fac eam sternutare cum condisi: et stringe manum tuam super os eius, et nares ipsius.	Then make her sternutate with condiments; and bind your hand over her face, and her nostrils.
Si ergo egreditur per hoc, bonum est.	If it exits through this, it is good.
Si non: tunc accipe ollam, et perfora in coopertorio foramen: et pone in ea herbas aperientes os matricis, sicut calamentum, rutam, et anetum, et camomillam, et sseham, et cassiam ligneam, et centauream: accipe omnes istas herbas, aut quasdam earum, et submerge eas cum aqua, et pone eas super ignem.	If not: then take a pot, and perforate in the covering hole: and put in it herbs that open up the womb's passages, such as calamint, rue, and anise, and chamomile, and sesham, and lignified cassia, and centaury: take all these herbs, or some of them, and submerge them with water, and put them over the fire.
Deinde pone embulam arundinis super foramen coopertorii ollae, et extremitatem aliam in os matricis: et teneat eam donec perueniat uapor ad concauitatem matricis.	Then put a poultice of papyrus over the hole of the pot, and insert another extremity into the womb's passage: and hold it there until the vapour reaches the concavity of the womb.
Deinde fac eam sternutare, sicut diximus.	Then make her sternutate, as we said before.
Secundina enim egredietur cum facilitate.	For the secondine will exit with ease.
Si autem remaneat post hanc curationem, et non egrediatur: tunc praecipe Obstetrici, ut submergat manum suam in oleo sisamino, aut mucillagine alteae.	If however it remains after this treatment, and does not exit: then instruct the Obstetrician to immerse their hand in oil of sissamine or mulberry.
Deinde intromittat in uuluam, et quaerat cum ea Secundinam.	Then introduce it into the womb, and seek out the secondine with it.
Cum ergo inuenerit eam, tunc accipiat eam, et extendat ipsam paulatim.	When it finds it, then take hold of it, and gently pull it out little by little.
Si autem fuerit annexa in profundo matricis, tunc intromittat manum, secundum quod narrauimus, donec quando inuenerit Secundinam, et extrahat eam paulatim secundum rectitudinem, ut non cadat matrix apud attractionem uehementem: imo oportet, ut permutetur cum facilitate ad latera dextra et sinistra: deinde addatur in quantitatem attractionis.	If however it is attached deeply in the womb, then introduce the hand, as we have described, until when it finds the secondine, and pulls it out little by little according to rectitude, so that the womb does not collapse during violent attraction: indeed it is necessary, that it be turned with ease to the right and left sides: then add to the quantity of attraction.
Ipsa enim obedit tunc, et seruatur, et euadit ab adhaerentia.	It will obey then, and be preserved, and will be freed from adhesion.
Quod si os matricis est coartatum, sicut nos iam narrauimus: cura eam cum sternutatione, et ex medicatione ollae cum herbis.	If the maternal wound is constricted, as we have already narrated: treat it with sternutating and medicate it with an ointment made from herbs.
Si autem non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc caue ne fatigeris super eam in iteratione extractionis.	If it does not come out with all that we have narrated, then beware lest you fatigue yourself over it in the repetition of extraction.
Verum oportet, ut quod egreditur ad os matricis ex ea, liges ad coxam mulieris.	It is necessary that what comes out from the maternal wound be tied to the hip of the woman.
Deinde clisteriza eam cum unguento tetrapharmacon.	Then cleanse it with a cluster of Tetrapharmacum ointment.
Ipsum enim putrefaciet eam post dies, et dissoluetur, et egredietur.	For it will putrefy after days and dissolve, and come out.
Verumtamen quando putrefit, eleuatur ex ea odor malus ad stomachum et caput, et laedit illud infirmam.	However, when it putrefies, a bad smell rises from it to the stomach and head, and injures that weak person.
Oportet ergo ut administrentur suffumigationes conuenientes ad illud.	Therefore, it is necessary that suitable fumigations be administered for that.
Quidam autem antiquorum iam experti sunt suffumigationem nasturtii, et ficuum siccarum.	Some of the ancients, however, have experienced the fumigation of watercress and dried figs.
Forma instrumenti quo suffumigatur mulier apud retentionem Secundinae et menstruorum.	The shape of the instrument with which a woman is fumigated at the retention of the secondine and menses.
Fiat ex uitro simile alcama, aut ex zere: et ponatur extremitas ampla super ignem: et suffumigatio sit posita super prunas: teneat eam, donec consumatur illa suffumigatio: et itera aliam.	Let it be made from a small copper vessel or from lead: and let a wide mouth be placed over the fire: and let the fumigation be put over the woman's thighs: hold it there until that fumigation is consumed: and do another likewise.
Â¶ De curatione Ani non perforati.	Concerning the cure of an unperforated anus.
Caput LXXIX.	Chapter 79.
Nascuntur multi puerorum, et Ani eorum sunt non perforati, quos iam opilauit sifac subtile.	Many boys are born, and their anuses are not perforated, whom the subtle siphac has already oppressed.
Oportet ergo, ut obstetrix perforet illud sifac digito suo: et si non, perforet ipsum cum Spatumili acuto: et caueat lacertum, ne tangat eum.	Therefore, it is necessary that the midwife should perforate that anus with her finger: and if not, she should perforate it with a sharp spatula: and let her beware of the surrounding area, lest she touch it.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam infusam in uino et oleo.	Then put on top of it a woolen cloth soaked in wine and oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum ungentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
Si autem times quod opiletur, tunc pone in foramine cannulam de plumbo diebus multis, et auferatur quando puer uult egerere.	If, however, it is what is blocked, then put a pipe of lead in the nostril for many days, and it will be digested when the boy wants to expel.
Et iam accidit opilatio Ani etiam ex consolidatione uulneris, aut apostematis.	And now there occurs a blockage of the nose also from the consolidation of a wound, or an abscess.
Oportet ergo ut secetur illa consolidatio, deinde curetur cum eo quod diximus ex curatione et plumbo.	It is necessary therefore that the consolidation be cut through, then treated with what we mentioned earlier regarding the treatment and lead.
Â¶ De curatione Fistularum quae accidunt in inferiori parte.	Concerning the treatment of fistulas which occur in the lower part.
Caput LXXX.	Chapter 80.
Fistulae quae accidunt in inferiori, sunt Nodatio, et Grossitudo quae accidunt prope anum deforis: aut in spacio unius partium: et est Fistula una, aut plures.	Fistulas which occur in the lower parts are a swelling and a hardness which occur near the anus outside: or in a space of one part: and it is one fistula, or several.
Cum ergo antiquatur illa Nodatio, aperitur, et currit ex ea humiditas aquosa alba, aut pus subtile.	When, therefore, that swelling becomes old, it opens up, and a watery fluid, white and clear, or subtle pus flows out from it.
Et quandoque sunt ex istis Fistulis penetrantes.	And sometimes they are penetrating fistulas from these.
Ergo penetrantes cognoscuntur per illud quod egreditur ex egestione, et uentositate, quando utitur infirmus egestione: et fortasse egreditur ex eis uermis.	Therefore, the penetrating ones are recognized by what comes out from the evacuation and flatulence, when the sick person uses the toilet, and perhaps something worms out from them.
Et sunt ex eis Fistulae quando sunt in spacio penetrantes usque ad uesicam, et usque ad meatum uirgae.	And they are fistulas from these when they penetrate into a space up to the bladder, and up to the passage of the penis.
Et sunt ex eis penetrantes usque ad iuncturam coxae, et usque ad nodum caudae.	And they are penetrating ones up to the joining of the hip, and up to the node of the tailbone.
Ex eo autem quo cognoscitur Fistula penetrans usque ad anum, etiam a non penetrante, est, ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum: et intromittas tentam subtilem in Fistulam ex aere, aut ferro: quando non est tortuositas.	From that which is recognized as a penetrating fistula up to the anus, and also from the non-penetrating one, it is, that you insert your index finger into the anus: and you insert a subtle probe into the fistula through air or iron: when there is no twisting.
Quod si in ea est tortuositas, tunc intromitte in eam tentam ex plumbo subtilem, aut pilum ex pilis equarum, donec sentias tentam, aut pilum in digito tuo.	If there is twisting in it, then insert into it a subtle probe made of lead, or a small iron rod from the rods of the horse, until you feel the probe, or the small rod on your finger.
Quod si non sentis ipsam penitus, neque procedit ex foramine aliquid ex egestione, neque uentositas, neque uermis sicut dixi: tunc scias, quia est non penetrans: propera ergo ad curationem.	If you do not feel it deeply, nor does anything proceed from the nostril during evacuation, nor flatulence, nor worms as I said: then know that it is not penetrating: therefore proceed to treatment.
Et quando Fistula est penetrans usque ad uesicam, aut ad meatum urinae: tunc significatio eius est exitus urinae ex ea, et prohibitio eius ab hoc ut consolidetur locus cum medicinis.	And when a fistula is penetrating up to the bladder or to the urethra, then its indication is the outflow of urine from it, and its prohibition from this so that the place may be consolidated with medicines.
Si uero est penetrans usque ad iuncturam coxae, aut ad os coxae: tunc signum eius est, quod perueniat tenta usque illuc, si non est in ea tortuositas usque ad os: et inuentio doloris in circumitu partis, et quod egreditur pus ex ea semper: et quod non ualeat in ea medicatio, neque consolidatur cum unguento.	If it is penetrating up to the joint of the hip, or to the socket of the hip: then its sign is that it reaches the tendons up to that place, if there is no twisting up to the socket; and the discovery of pain in the surrounding area, and that pus always flows out from it; and that medicine is not effective for it, nor is it consolidated with an ointment.
Et in istis Fistulis omnibus penetrantibus non est curatio omnino: et curatio earum est labor et uanitas ei, ex stultis medicis, super quem formatur.	And in all these penetrating fistulas there is no complete cure: and the treatment of them is toil and vanity for him, from foolish doctors, upon whom it is formed.
In illa autem quae non est penetrans, et non antiqua, speratur sanatio cum serro: secundum quod ego narro tibi, et ego iam probaui: et est, ut iaceat infirmus inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et eleua crura eius usque supra coxas ipsius, et coxae eius sint inclinatae ad uentrem ipsius.	In that one which does not penetrate and is not old, healing is hoped for with a poultice: according to what I tell you, and I have already tried it: and it is so that the patient lies between your hands on his back; and lift his legs up above his hips, and his hips are inclined towards his belly.
Deinde intromittetentam plumbi, aut aeris, si est in Fistula tortuositas, donec scias ubi peruenit tenta.	Then a probe of lead or copper is introduced, if there is twisting in the fistula, until you know where it reaches the tendons.
Si autem sentit eam infirmus circa anum, tunc oportet ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum.	If however the patient feels it around his anus, then it is necessary that you insert your index finger into his anus.
Si ergo sentis in digito tuo tentam iam penetrasse per seipsam detectam, praeter quod sentias inter digitum tuum, et inter ipsum sifac, aut carnem: tunc ergo scias certe, quia est penetrans: non ergo labores in ea, quoniam non est eius sanatio, sicut diximus.	If therefore you feel with your finger the tendons having already penetrated through the detected passage, beyond what you feel between your finger and the anus itself, or flesh: then therefore you know for certain that it is penetrating: so do not labor over it, since there is no healing for it, as we have said.
Dixerunt tamen, quia sanatur in quibusdam hominibus caro, et ex medicatione qua ei speratur iuuamentum, est, ut ignias cauterium subtile secundum amplitudinem Fistulae, sicut praecessit, et intromittas ipsum ignitum in Fistulam, donec perueniat circa anum.	They have said, however, that it is healed in certain men by flesh, and from the medication for which they hope for a remedy, it is to apply a subtle cautery according to the width of the fistula, as mentioned before, and to insert the ignited thing into the fistula, until it reaches around the anus.
Deinde itera illud bis, aut ter, donec scias, quia iam adustae sunt omnes illae carnes additae filtratae, quae sunt similes cannulae pennae auis.	Then you should repeat this twice or three times, so that you may know because those added filter-like fleshy growths which are similar to the quill feathers of a bird are already burned away.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, donec egrediantur illae carnes, quae adustae sunt: deinde cura illud cum unguentis generantibus carnem et consolidantibus.	Then treat it with bandages soaked in butter, until those burned flesh grows out; then treat it with salves that generate and consolidate flesh.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est.	If it is thus healed, it is good.
Et si non, tunc non sanatur cum alia curatione unquam.	And if not, then it will never be healed with another treatment.
Et si egreditur tenta, et non peruenerit usque ad digitum tuum, qui est in ano, et est inter ipsum et tentam uelamen spissum ex carne, aut sifac: et uides Fistulam in eo quod sequitur superficiem cutis, tunc seca cutem ab initio Fistulae, et tu uadis secando cum tenta quod est in fistula, donec perueniat secatio ubi peruenit tentae extremitas, et liberatur tenta et cadit.	And if it comes out as a point, and has not penetrated to your finger, which is in the anus, and there is a thick, fleshy or membranous layer between it and the point, or sieve-like structure: and you see a fistula in that which follows the surface of the skin, then you should cut the skin from the beginning of the fistula, and you would separate by cutting with the point that is in the fistula, until the separation reaches where the point ends, and the point is freed and falls out.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas, quae assimilantur cannulae pennae auis, ut non remaneat ex eis aliquid.	Then cleanse those filter-like fleshy growths which are similar to the quill feathers of a bird, so that nothing remains of them.
Si autem uincit te sanguis, et soluit inter te et inter operationem tuam ut seces illas carnes: tunc melius quod fit, et uelocioris iuuamenti, cauterizare eam cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta.	But if blood overflows and breaks out between you and your operation, separating those fleshy growths: then it is better to do what is done, and for the sake of swift healing, to cauterize it with fire, or with sharp medicine.
Quoniam cauterium cum igne aggregat habitudines bonas, adustionem illarum carnium additarum, et abscisionem sanguinis, et exiccationem humiditatum.	For the cauterization with fire gathers good habits, burning away those added fleshy growths, and stopping the flow of blood, and drying out the moisture.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, aut caulibus tritis, donec locus emittat pus, et egrediantur illae carnes adustae in pus.	Then treat it with bandages soaked in butter, or triturated onions, until the place discharges pus, and those burned fleshy growths come out with the pus.
Deinde cura tunc uulnus cum unguentis consolidatiuis, generantibus carnem duram: et sunt medicinae in quibus sunt stipticitas et exiccatio.	Then treat the wound with consolidating salves that generate hard flesh: and there are medicines in which there are astringents and drying.
Nam quando restaurantur, tunc iam sanatur: et non times iterationem.	For when you restore, then already it is healed; and not at that time an iteration.
Si autem Fistula iam peruenit usque ad profundum ani, et elongatur a superfluitate corporis: tunc intromitte digitum tuum in anum, et inquire cum eo.	If, however, the fistula has already reached to the deep part of the anus, and is prolonged from the abundance of the body: then insert your finger into the anus, and examine with it.
Si ergo sentis tentam, et inter te, et inter eam est uelamen ex sifac, aut carne, et est propinqua penetrationi: tunc non est operatio in illo, nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	If, therefore, you feel a tenderness, and between you and it there is a thin layer of sifac or flesh, and it is near to penetrating: then there is no operation on that, unless according to the way of trust and hope.
Quod est, quia administratur in eo unus trium modorum: aut ut cauterizes ipsam, sicut diximus: aut seces eam, donec consequaris concauitatem eius, ut sit possibile tibi intromittere licinia, et curationem ex proximo.	What is, because it is administered in one of the three modes: either you cauterize it, as we said: or you section it, until you achieve its concavity, so that it may be possible for you to insert a licence and a cure from nearby.
Et non procedas multum cum sectione, ut non incidas lacertum continentem anum, et accidat super infirmum exitus egestionis absque uoluntate.	And do not proceed far with the section, lest you hurt the surrounding tissue of the anus, and cause an unfavorable outcome of evacuation without control.
Deinde cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then treat it with what we said.
Fortasse enim sanabitur: aut elonges ipsum uelamen, et mundes ipsum postquam secas ipsum usque prope anum, sicut diximus, aut cum tenta, aut cum instrumento alio acutae extremitatis.	Perhaps it will heal: or you will prolong the thin layer, and cleanse it after you have sectioned it up to near the anus, as we said, or with a tent or with another acute extremity instrument.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas quae sunt in sectione, usque ubi potes cum perscrutatione.	Then cleanse those filtered flesh wounds that are in the section, until where you can with careful examination.
Deinde conare restaurationem uulneris totius cum sectione, et orificio superiore ubi consolidatur: et remanet Fistula aperta in interiore parte anus, et erit leuius super infirmum.	Then strive for the restoration of the whole wound with the section, and the upper orifice where it is consolidated: and a open fistula will remain in the interior part of the anus, and it will be easier on the weak patient.
Et quandoque suitur Fistula secundum hunc modum: et est, quando intromittis tentam in Fistulam: et est in latere ani circa superficiem corporis cum cute et margine ani: tunc accipe tentam perforatae extremitatis, quae est sicut acus aleskef, id est, praeparantium coria, secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes the fistula follows this method: and it is when you insert a probe into the fistula: and it is on the side of the anus near the surface of the body with skin and margin of the anus: then take the probe of the perforated extremity, which is like a needle, that is, preparing the leather, according to this form.
Et intromitte in eam filum inuolutum ex quinque filis, et circiter ea.	And insert into it a twisted thread made of five threads, and wrap it around.
Deinde intromitte tentam cum filo in Fistulam, donec consequatur concauitatem eius.	Then introduce a thread with a probe into the fistula, until it reaches the concavity of it.
Si ergo est penetrans in margine ani interius prope, tunc extrahe filum ex illo foramine: ita ut intromittas digitum tuum in anum, et extrahas extremitatem fili, et aggreges duas extremitates simul: et stringe utramque, et dimitte illud die uno, aut duobus diebus: et quanto plus incidit filum in carne, stringe ipsum bene, donec incidantur illae carnes quae sunt inter duas extremitates fili, et cadant: deinde cura uulnus, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	If therefore it is penetrating to the margin of the anus inward nearby, then extract the thread from that orifice: so that you introduce your finger into the anus and pull out the end of the thread, and join the two ends together: and tie both tightly, and leave it for one day or two days: and as much as the thread is embedded in the flesh, tie it well, until those fleshes which are between the two ends of the thread are united and fall away: then cure the wound, until it consolidates and heals.
Si autem orificium Fistulae non est penetrans: tunc fac ipsum penetrare quocunque modo praeparatur tibi, nisi sit in profundo multum.	If, however, the orifice of the fistula does not penetrate: then make it penetrate by whatever means are prepared for you, unless it is deeply situated.
Non enim inest tibi, ut facias illud propter lacertum, ut non incidas ipsum.	For it is not fitting for you to do that on account of the ligament, lest you injure it.
Deinde fac cum ea sicut diximus, donec sanetur.	Then do with it as we have said, until it heals.
Forma Spatumilis spinosi quo finditur Fistula, cuius curuitas est acuta ualde, et pars altera est non acuta, ut non incidat illud quod non est necesse, sicut uides.	You should make a spatula for the spiny fistula, whose curvature is acute indeed, and the other part is not acute, so that it does not injure what is not necessary, as you see.
Â¶ De sutura Hemorroidarum, ex quibus currit sanguis ex incisione earum: et cura fissurarum.	Concerning the suturing of hemorrhoids, from which blood flows out after their incision: and the treatment of fissures.
Caput LXXXI.	Chapter 81.
Sunt Hemorroides secundum duos modos.	Hemorrhoids are according to two modes.
Aut enim sunt intra anum, similes uesicis carbonum, uel prunarum: aut quasi ipsae sint grana uuae.	Or they are inside the anus, like little bladders of carbon or pomegranates: or as if they were grains of a vine.
Et ex eis sunt paruae, et magnae: et sanguis currit ex eis semper, et est una, et sunt multae.	And among them are small ones and large ones: and blood flows out from them always, and it is one, and there are many.
Et sunt extra anum, et in extremitatibus eius.	And they are outside the anus, and in its extremities.
Verumtamen istae quae sunt extra anum, sunt secundum plurimum paucae humiditatis, ex quibus currit aqua citrina, aut parum sanguinis cursu assiduo: et sunt secundum colorem corporis.	However, those that are outside the anus are according to a great deal of little humidity, from which flows watery fluid, or a little blood in a steady flow: and they are according to the color of the body.
Et curatio eius quae est intra anum, est, ut praecipias infirmo ut assellet: et exprimatur, donec egrediatur anus, et appareant athelil tibi.	And the treatment of that which is inside the anus is to clean it thoroughly so that it may stick together: and it should be pressed out until the anus comes out and the thread appears on the thigh.
Propterea ergo et suspende cum uncinis: aut tene eos cum ungue tuo.	Therefore, you should hang them with hooks or hold them with your fingernail.
Deinde incide eos apud radices suas.	Then cut them off at their roots.
Si autem non retinentur in eis uncini, propter humiditatem eorum et ipsorum mollificationem: tunc cape eos cum panno aspero, aut cum coto ex diploide lanea, et extrahe eos cum digitis tuis.	But if they are not held back by the hooks, because of their moisture and softness: then seize them with a rough cloth, or with a double-layered linen bandage, and extract them with your fingers.
Deinde incide eos, et pulueriza super eos post incisionem quosdam pulueres calidos, ut stent eis loco cauterii.	Then cut them off, and sprinkle some warm powders over them after the incision, so that they may take the place of a cautery.
Aut cauteriza eos secundum quod praecessit in capitulo cauterizandi.	Or cauterize them according to what was previously described in the chapter on cauterization.
Deinde cura eos cum reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then treat them with the remaining treatment, until they are healed.
Quod si non obedit anus egressioni, tunc clisteriza infirmum clisteri in quo sit mordicatio parua, ut lauetur cum eo quod est in ano, et obediat egressioni uelociter, quando exprimit se infirmus.	If the anus does not obey the exit, then inject a small injection of medicine into the rectum, so that it may be cleansed with what is in the anus, and obey the exit quickly, when the patient presses out.
Si autem athelil sunt extrinseci ab ano, tunc res eorum est leuis, facilis: et est ut capias eos cum ungue tuo, aut capias eos cum uncino, et incidas eos.	But if the threads are external to the anus, then their treatment is easy and simple: and it is as if you were to seize them with your fingernail, or seize them with a hook, and cut them off.
Deinde cura eos cum eo quod diximus, donec sanentur.	Then treat them with what we have said, until they are healed.
Et qui abhorret incisionem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut administres suturam eorum secundum hunc modum.	And those who fear the incision with iron, then it is necessary to administer their suture in this manner.
Accipe filum inuolutum, et intromitte ipsum in acum.	Take a twisted thread and insert it into the point.
Deinde extrahe athelil ad superiora, et fac ipsum penetrare cum acu in radice eius ex parte altera: et inuolue duas extremitates fili, in inferiori parte acus, et sint latitudinaliter: et stringe athelil strictura forti.	Then draw out the thread to the top, and make it penetrate with the point on the other side of its root: and twist the two ends of the thread at the bottom of the point, and let them be wide apart: and tighten the thread with a strong constriction.
Deinde noda filum, et extrahe acum.	Then knot the thread, and draw out the point.
Fac illud cum omnibus athelil, et dimitte ex eis unum: nec suas ipsum, ut currat ex eo superfluitas sanguinis.	Do this with all the instruments and leave one of them out, so that it does not stick to itself, in order that it may be free from excessive blood flow.
Deinde pone super anum pannum infusum in oleo rosato, aut caeroto, et pone ipsum super anum: et praecipe infirmo, ut quiescat.	Then put a bandage infused with rose oil or cerate over the wound, and place it on the wound: and apply pressure to the weak part, so that it may rest.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, donec cadat.	Then leave it until it falls off.
Cum ergo cadunt athelil, cura eos cum unguentis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	When the instruments fall out, treat them with ointments and the remaining treatment, until they are healed.
Â¶ De cura Fissurarum.	On the treatment of fissures.
Multotiens enim accidunt ex exiccatione stercoris, et constrictione naturae.	For they often occur due to dryness of the stool and constriction of nature.
Cum ergo antiquantur, et non ualet in eis medicina: tunc oportet ut radas cum puncta Spatumilis, aut cum ungue tuo, donec fiant humidae, et auferatur ab eis cortex superior qui prohibet eas a consolidatione.	When they become chronic and medicine is of no avail in them: then it is necessary to apply rough sponges with punctures, or with your own ointment, until they become humid, and the superior crust which prevents their consolidation is removed.
Deinde cura eas, donec consolidentur secundum quod oportet.	Then treat them, until they are consolidated according to what is fitting.
Si autem non consolidantur: tunc itera eas cum rasione uehementiori quam prima, donec sanguinentur multum, et excorientur deinde cura eas, donec sanentur.	If they do not consolidate: then treat them again with a more vigorous rubbing than before, until they bleed much and are cleansed, and then treat them until they are healed.
Â¶ De curatione Almirmar inuersorum, et non inuersorum: et Athelil siccorum, et Formicae.	On the treatment of inverted piles, and not of inverted ones: and of dry hemorrhoids, and of wounds like ulcers.
Caput LXXXII.	Chapter 82.
Scias quod Almirmar non est nisi nodus rotundus secundum colorem corporis, similis capiti claui: et fit in toto corpore, praecipue in inferioribus partibus pedum, et digitis: et accidit ex eis dolor apud ambulationem.	You know that Almirmar is nothing but a round node according to the color of the body, similar to the head of a nail: and it occurs throughout the entire body, especially in the lower parts of the feet and toes: and it causes pain while walking.
Oportet ergo ut secetur quod est in circumitu claui, et teneatur cum forficibus, aut cum uncino, et eradicetur ex radice sua.	It is necessary therefore to cut around what is on the circumference of the nail, and to hold it with forceps or with a hook, and to eradicate it from its root.
Deinde cura illud: et si uis cauteriza illud secundum quod praecessit in capitulo suo.	Then treat it: and if you want, cauterize it according to what was previously mentioned in its chapter.
Ex athelil autem siccis unus est eminentia parua, aspera, filtrata, rotunda supra superficiem corporis.	One of them is a small elevated prominence on the surface of the body, rough, filtering, rounded above.
Et multotiens accidunt in manibus puerorum.	And they occur many times on the hands of children.
Et curatio eius est, ut extendas athelil, et incidas ipsum: aut stringas ipsum cum filo de serico: aut cum pilo, donec cadat.	And its treatment is to stretch out the prominence, and to cut it: or to tie it with a silk thread: or with a pill, until it falls off.
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum secundum quod praemissum est cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta: et iam eradicantur athelil inuersi, et non inuersi cum instrumento quod ego dicam.	And if you wish, cauterize it according to what has been mentioned before with fire, or with acute medicine: and now the inverted prominences are eradicated, and not the inverted ones with the instrument that I will describe.
Formica autem est etiam eminentia parua filtrata, grossa, super superficiem corporis, uadens in profundum ualde: et quando inuenit eam frigus, sentitur in ea simile mordicationi formicae, et fit in corpore toto: et plurimum eius fit in manibus.	A formica is also a small elevated filtering prominence, thick, on the surface of the body, penetrating deeply: and when it finds it, cold is felt in it, similar to the sting of a formica, and it becomes painful throughout the whole body: and most of them occur on the hands.
Et curatio eius est, ut accipias cannulam ex penna anseris, aut penna uulturis forti: et pone illam cannulam super Formicam, donec contineat circulus cannulae ex partibus eius.	And its treatment is to take a tube from the feather of a goose or a strong vulture's feather: and place that tube on the formica, until it contains a circle of the tube with its parts.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum cannula, donec seces quod est in circumitu Formicae: et ponas eam in profundo carnis, et eradices Formicam ex radice eius.	Then revolve your hand with the tube, until you extract what is around the formica: and place it deep into the flesh, and eradicate the formica from its root.
Et si uis, fac illud cum cannula aeris, aut ferri, secundum hanc formam.	And if you wish, do it with a tube of copper or iron, according to this method.
Sit superius cannulae ad sublimitatem trahens surdum inuolutum, ut alleuietur super digitum apprehensio eius et ipsius reuolutio.	Let the upper part of the tube be at the limit of the surrounding skin, drawing upwards the involution, so that it is alleviated above the finger, grasping its apprehension and its own revulsion.
Et si uis cauteriza Formicam secundum quod praemissum est in cauterizatione Athelil in capitulo de cauterio.	And if you wish, cauterize the formica according to what has been mentioned before in the chapter on cauterization of Athelil.
Â¶ De formis Instrumentorum quae administrantur ad Clisteria in aegritudinibus Ani, et solutionis uentris, et colicae.	Concerning the forms of instruments that are administered for clusterings in ailments of the anus, and of ventral solutions, and colic.
Caput LXXXIII.	Chapter 83.
Quandoque Clistere fit ex argento, aut ex aurichalco, aut ex aere fuso, aut malleato.	When a probe is made from silver, or from gold alloy, or from fused copper, or from steel.
Et quandoque fit ex istis Instrumentis paruum, et magnum, secundum illos in quibus administrantur.	And when they are made small and large from these instruments, according to those on which they are administered.
Illud ergo quod administratur in curatione puerorum paruorum, sit paruum: et quorum ani sunt debiles, aut dolorosi, sic et clisteria eorum.	Therefore, what is administered in the treatment of young children should be small: and for those whose veins are weak or painful, thus their probes.
Clistere magnum.	Large probes.
Cistere paruum.	Small probes.
Canna eius, id est, caput superius in quo ligatur uter, sit amplum secundum hunc modum: et sit ei distinctio ut ligetur uter sicut uides, et extremitas eius inferior quae intromittitur in anum, sit surda, id est, non aperta, lenis, ualde, trahens ad subtilitatem: et in uno laterum eius sint duo foramina, et in latere altero foramen unum.	The shaft of it, that is, the upper head where the ligature is tied, should be large according to this method: and there should be a distinction so that the ligature is tied as you see, and the lower end which is inserted into the anus, should be smooth, that is, not open, gentle, indeed, drawing towards subtlety: and on one side of it there should be two openings, and on the other side an opening.
Et sit amplitudo foraminis secundum grossitudinem radiorum, et grossius parum, et sit uter in quo ponuntur medicinae ex uesica animalis: aut ex charta ouis, quae sit secundum formam asofrati paruae: cuius radix sit palmus unus.	And the width of the openings should be according to the thickness of the roots, and the thicker the smaller, and there should be a ligature in which medicines are placed from the urine of an animal: or from paper made from the skin of a small animal, which is according to the shape of a small asafoetida: whose root is one palm.
Et perforetur foraminibus multis sicut reuoluitur, et sit spacium quod est inter omne foramen grossitudo digiti.	And it should be perforated with many openings as it revolves, and there should be a space that is between all the openings the thickness of a finger.
Deinde intromitte in illa foramina filum forte ex filo crudo, quod sit ex decem filis, aut circiter ea, et aggrega cum eo utrem sicut asofrati.	Then insert into those openings a strong thread made from raw thread, which is made from ten threads or around that, and tie it together with the ligature like an asafoetida.
Cum ergo ponitur in eo uter, stringatur in capite clisteris inter duo distinguentia constrictione forti.	When therefore a ligature is placed on it, it should be tied at the head of the probe between two distinct constrictions with a strong binding.
Deinde clisteriza cum eo.	Then probe with it.
Et haec est forma circuli utris hic depicta, et foraminum.	And this is the form of the circle, as it is depicted here, and of the openings.
Qualitas autem clisterizandi cum eo, est: ut impleas utrem, aut uesicam ex medicina, quae sit calefacta secundum quantitatem tolerantiae infirmi: et caue ne sit calida ualde, aut frigida ualde.	The quality of probing with it, however, is: that you should fill the ligature, or inject a medicine, which is warmed according to the quantity of the tolerance of the sick person: and take care that it not be too hot or too cold.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et eleuet crura sua ad superiora: et pone sub eo inthaan, id est, corium super quod iacent homines, aut linteamen.	Then the weak patient is placed on their back, and their legs are elevated above them: and a soft cloth, that is, a layer of fabric on which people lie, or a linen bandage.
Deinde inunge extremitatem Clisteris cum oleo, aut cum albugine oui, aut cum mucillagine foenugraeci, aut similium.	Then anoint the extremity with cluster oil, or with albuge oil, or with foam-like mucilage of fenugreek, or something similar.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in anum cum facilitate.	Then introduce it into the anus with ease.
Deinde accipiat minister utrem cum duabus manibus suis simul, et exprimat ipsum cum uehementia, donec euacuet totum quod est in Clisteri in intestinum.	Then the attendant should receive it with his two hands at the same time, and squeeze it out with vehemence, until everything that is in the cluster passes into the intestine.
Deinde extrahe Clistere, et eleuet infirmus crura sua ad parietem.	Then remove the cluster, and raise the patient's legs against the wall.
Quod si medicina cogit eum ad exitum, tunc teneat quantum potest.	What if the medicine thinks it is going to exit, then hold it back as much as possible.
Et si dormit cum ea nocte tota, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if he sleeps with it all night, it will be more useful in the treatment.
Si autem clisterizas eum in aegritudinibus solutionis uentris, et festinat exitus eius: tunc itera clistere, donec sanetur.	If however the clusters are injected into the diseased intestines of the belly, and hasten the exit of them: then repeat the cluster, until he is healed.
Quod si in ano sunt hemorroides, aut apostemata laedentia, tunc sit clistere subtile ualde, lene, ex clisteribus quibus clisterizantur pueri.	What if there are hemorrhoids in the anus, or painful apostemes, then let the cluster be subtle and gentle, mild, from the clusters with which children are treated.
Et haec sit forma clisteris subtilis super quod sit stricta cutis.	And let this be the form of the subtle cluster above, on account of the constricted skin.
Â¶ De curatione Vulnerum capitis sine fractura ossis.	On the treatment of head wounds without fracture of bone.
Caput LXXXIIII.	Head 83.
Iam dixi in diuisione de curatione uulnerum quod conueniebat libro, et ego dicam hic curationem eorum cum manu, et cum medicinis secundum complementum.	Now I have spoken in the division on the treatment of wounds that was suitable for the book, and I shall describe here their treatment with manual operations, and with medicines according to their complement.
Dico ergo, quod uulnera diuersificantur secundum illud quo fiunt uulnera, et secundum locum super quem cadit uulnus.	I say therefore, that wounds are diversified according to the manner in which they are inflicted, and according to the place where the wound falls.
Res ergo quibus fiunt uulnera multotiens, sunt sicut iactus lapidis: aut incisio ensis, aut cultelli: aut percussio cum lancea, aut ligno, aut sagitta: et similibus illis ex rebus multis.	Therefore the wounds that are inflicted many times are like the blows of a stone: or the cut of a sword, or an axe, or the percussion with a lance, or wood, or arrow: and similar to those from many things.
Vulnera autem quae fiunt secundum loca corporis sunt, sicut uulnus quod cadit super caput, aut collum, aut pectus, aut uentrem, aut epar: et similia ex eis membris.	Wounds that are inflicted according to the location of the body are, for example, a wound that falls on the head, or neck, or chest, or belly, or liver: and similar ones from these members.
Et ego sum narrans curationes quorundam uulnerum, ut ponam eam ratiocinationem et regulam super reliqua uulnera.	And I am describing the treatments of certain wounds, so that I may put forth a method and rule for the remaining wounds.
Et ego incipiam a uulneribus capitis simplicibus: quoniam rememoratio compositorum ueniet in principio capituli tertii.	And I begin with simple head wounds, because the recollection of composite wounds comes at the beginning of the third chapter.
Dico ergo.	I say therefore.
Quando accidit in capite uulnus simplex, et non est fractura ossis: considera tunc, si est ex iactu lapidis, aut ei similibus, et iam fregit cutem tantum: et est uulnus magnum, et times super infirmum euentum apostematis calidi: tunc propera, et phlebotoma cephalicam statim: et non tardes illud: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius: si non fuerit prohibens aliquid a phlebotomia, praecipue si fuerit sanguis qui egreditur ex uulnere paucus.	When there is a simple wound on the head, and it is not a fracture of the bone: consider then if it is from a blow of a stone, or something similar, and has only bruised the skin: and it is a great wound, and often an aposteme forms in the following days, hot and inflamed: then hurry, and perform phlebotomy on the head at once: and do not delay it: and draw out from the blood according to the quantity of its strength: if there were no prohibition against phlebotomy, especially if the blood which flows out from the wound is little.
Et sit phlebotomia ex contrario partis uulneratae.	And let the phlebotomy be on the contrary part of the wounded area.
Et caueat infirmus sibi a repletione, et uino, et cibis grossis.	And let the weak person beware of replenishment, and wine, and coarse foods.
Si autem minutionem prohibet aliquid, tunc minoretur ex cibo, et non appropinquet carnibus, neque uinis.	If something prohibits moderation, then it will be diminished from food, and not approach flesh, nor wine.
Et pone super uulnus si accidit ei apostema calidum, cotum infusum in oleo rosato solo, aut cum uino in quo est stipticitas.	And put on the wound if an aposteme forms, a cotton cloth infused with rose oil alone, or with wine in which there is stippticity.
Si autem securus fueris ab apostemate calido, tunc pone super uulnus, si est recens cum sanguine suo, et non mutauit ipsum aer, puluerem quem ego narrabo post paululum: et si iam mutauit ipsum aer, tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, donec sanetur.	If you have been free from the hot aposteme, then put on the wound, if it is recent with its own blood, and has not changed the air, a powder which I will describe soon: and if it has already changed the air, then put on it some ointments, until it is healed.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, aut est ex incisione ensis, et similium: et non aggregantur labia eius per puluillos, tunc aggrega ipsa cum sutura, secundum quod ego narrabo in uulneribus uentris de sutura eorum.	If the wound is large, or it is from a deep incision, and similar: and its lips do not come together through small points, then bring them together with a suture, according to what I will relate about the wounds of the belly regarding their suture.
Si autem uulnus iam detectum est ab osse, et pendet, et non est retentio eius, nisi in suspensorio paruo: tunc incide ipsum.	If the wound is already open to the bone, and it hangs, and there is no retention of it, except in a small suspension: then cut into it.
Deinde cura uulnus cum medicinis, et restaura in eo carnem duram loco cutis, et praecipe infirmo, ut alatur cibis in quibus est grossitudo, sicut sunt capita, et triticum coctum, donec sit ut puls: et eis similia.	Then treat the wound with medicines, and restore to it hard flesh in place of skin, and prescribe to the weak person that they take nourishing foods in which there is richness, such as are heads of cattle, and cooked wheat, until it be as a pulse: and similar things.
Quod si inuenis in cute putrefactionem, et non adhaeret ossi: tunc incide putrefactum totum, et proiice ipsum: deinde cura illud.	If you find putrefaction in the skin, and it does not adhere to the bone: then cut out the entire putrid thing, and throw it away: then treat what remains.
Si autem in his uulneribus est arteria, aut uena ex qua fluit sanguis: et non abscinditur per medicinas, tunc inquire super arteriam.	If however in these wounds there is an artery, or a vein from which blood flows: and it does not stop through medicines, then make an incision above the artery.
Si ergo inuenis eam non sectam, tunc seca eam cum Spatumili, aut liga eam.	If therefore you find it not cut, then dry it with a haemostatic, or tie it off.
Quod si necessitas prouocat quando non confert illud quod diximus, tunc cauteriza eam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If necessity demands it when it does not conduce to what we have said, then cauterize it, until the blood is stopped.
Si autem uulnera ista sunt parua, simplicia, tunc res eorum est facilis, leuis: ita ut puluerizes super ea hunc puluerem: quoniam consolidat ea antequam mutet ea aer.	If however the wounds are small, simple, then their treatment is easy, light: so that you dust them with this powder: because it consolidates them before they change in the air.
Â¶ Modus Pulueris incarnatiui.	The method of powdered incarnative.
Recipe olibani partem unam, et sanguinis draconis partes duas, et calcis non extinctae partes tres: teratur totum multum, et cribelletur: et impleatur ex eo uulnus, et constringatur constrictione bona, donec adhaereat super ipsum bene, et coaguletur cum sanguine.	Take one part of olibanum, and two parts of dragon's blood, and three parts of unextinguished lime: grind everything together thoroughly, and sift it: and fill the wound with it, and constrict it with a good bandage, until it adheres well to it, and coagulates with the blood.
Deinde stringe ipsum desuper cum puluillis, et dimitte ipsum, neque soluas ipsum dum permanet, ita quod non apostemetur.	Then tie it above with threads and leave it, and do not disturb it while it remains, so that it does not become inflamed.
Nam non eradicatur ab eo medicina, donec sanatur.	For it is not eradicated by medicine, until it is healed.
Et quandoque facit illud calx sola, quando non sunt tibi in praesenti olibanum, et sanguis draconis etiam facit eandem operationem in multis ex uulneribus magnis, quando conuenit ut ponatur super ea et stringantur, et sunt uulnera recentia cum sanguine suo, quae non alterauit aer.	And when it makes a hard crust alone, when you do not have turpentine and dragon's blood present, and dragon's blood also performs the same operation in many large wounds, when it is suitable to be applied on them and tied, and they are recent wounds with their own blood, which has not changed its nature.
Quod si iam alterauit ea aer quadam alteratione, praecipue quando est in tempore aestatis, tunc non est in positione huius pulueris intentio: cura ergo ipsum cum eo quod diximus, ita ut ponas super ea quaedam unguenta digestiua: aut ponas super ea pultes ex farina hordei, factas cum aqua et melle, donec emittant pus.	But if it has already changed its nature through some alteration, especially when it is in the summer season, then there is no place for this powder's intention: therefore, treat it with what we have said, so that you apply certain digestive ointments on them: or apply poultices made from barley flour, mixed with water and honey, until they release pus.
Deinde cura ea reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then treat the remaining wounds with treatment, until they are healed.
Si uero accidat cum uulnere fractura in osse, et est parua, tunc extrahe illud cum Gesti: et ego iam dicam curationem fracturarum capitis in eo quod futurum est.	If it happens that a fracture occurs with a wound on the bone, and it is small, then extract it with gestures; and I will now describe the treatment of head fractures in what is to come.
Â¶ De uulneribus Colli.	Of Wounds of the Neck.
Caput LXXXV.	Chapter 85.
SI Autem uulnus accidat in Collo, tunc non est inter ipsum differentia in medicatione, et inter uulnus capitis quando est simplex.	If a wound occurs on the neck, then there is no difference between it and head wounds in terms of treatment, when it is simple.
Si autem iam incisus est neruus Colli, aut arteria: tunc si est neruus, non est in eo ingenium, nisi ut deuitetur curatio eius cum eo quod facit stipticitatem uehementem, sicut ziniar, et zegi, et eis similia.	If the nerve of the neck has been cut, or an artery: then if it is a nerve, there is no ingenuity in it, unless treatment is given to it with what causes vehement constriction, such as zeniar, and zeqi, and similar things.
Quoniam nocent neruis, et contrahunt eos.	Because they harm the nerves and constrict them.
Et non ponas super uulnus aliquid frigidum omnino: quoniam substantia neruorum est frigida, et continuatio eius est cum cerebro, quod est sublimius membrorum: et sit illud quo curatur ex medicinis lene, sicut calx lota cum aqua dulci aliquotiens infusa cum oleo, aut cum oleo rosato, et tuthia, quando abluitur etiam cum aqua dulci: et reliqui lapides minerales, secundum hunc modum, et unguenta humida.	And do not apply anything cold to the wound at all: because the substance of the nerves is cold, and its continuation is with the brain, which is the most sublime of the membranes: and let it be that which is treated with mild medicines, such as lota chalk mixed with sweet water, infused several times with oil, or with rose oil, and tutthia, when it is washed also with sweet water: and the remaining mineral stones, in this manner, and humid ointments.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, tunc administra suturam: aut coarta labia eius cum puluillis.	If the wound is large, then administer a suture; or cauterize its lips with powders.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it, until it heals.
Si uero uulneri est profunditas, aut accidit in eo sinus in inferiori parte eius, in quo iam aggregatur pus, tunc perfora ipsum in magis depresso loco in eo.	If the wound is deep, or if a sinus has formed on its lower part, where pus has already accumulated, then pierce it at the most depressed place.
Quod si iam incisa est in uulnere arteria, et consecutus est sanguinem eius fluxus: tunc separa, uel seca eam, et liga ipsam: aut cauteriza eam, si prouocat necessitas ad illud.	What if an artery has been cut in the wound and its blood flow has followed; then separate, or cut it off, and bind it; or cauterize it, if necessity requires it.
Si autem iam incidit spondiles gutturis, aut totum, et saluatae sunt alhaudegi: tunc aggrega labia cutis cum sutura super cannam gutturis, et non tangas guttur, imo aequa ipsum, et reduc ipsum super figuram naturalem.	If the vertebrae of the throat have been injured, or entirely, and the windpipes are intact; then bring together the lips of the skin with a suture above the cane of the throat, and do not touch the throat, but rather equalize it, and reduce it to its natural shape.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti, et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot.	Then bind it with a suitable stricture, and leave it for several days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis in quibus est stipticitas et exiccatio, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointments that have a stimulating and drying effect, until it heals.
Si autem uulnus iam fecit impressionem in osse, tunc perquire ipsum: tunc si in ipso sunt fragmenta ossis, extrahe ea omnia, aut quae potes ex eis: et quod non praeparatur, dimitte illud, donec putrescat uulnus, et separetur et alleuietur egressio eius.	If the wound has already made an impression on the bone, then investigate it; then if there are fragments of bone in it, extract them all, or as many as you can; and what is not prepared, leave that, until the wound putrefies, and its discharge and exit are separated.
Quod si uulnus fuerit recens, tunc pulueriza super ipsum puluerem quem narraui.	What if the wound is fresh, then powder it with the powder that I described.
Si autem uidetur in uulnere os, et fit Fistula: tunc cura ipsam cum eo cuius rememoratio uenit in capitulo suo.	If a bone is seen in the wound and it becomes a fistula, then treat it with what is mentioned in its chapter.
Â¶ De uulnere in Spatulis.	On wounds of the ribs.
Caput LXXXVI.	Chapter 86.
SI Est percussio lanceae, aut cultelli: et uides eius profunditatem, tunc considera.	If it is a blow from a lance or a dagger, and you see its depth, then consider.
Si ergo ex uulnere egreditur uentositas, quando anhelat ex eo infirmus, tunc scias, quia uulnus est mortale.	If therefore bad air comes out of the wound, when the patient breathes out weakly from it, then know that the wound is mortal.
Quod si non fuerit ei profunditas, et est recens cum sanguine suo: tunc non ponas in eo a prima hora puluerem, neque stringas ipsum, ut non retineatur sanguis in profunditate eius, et reuertatur ad cor, et interficiat infirmum: sed pone in ipso unguentum attractiuum, et solue ipsum in die bis.	If it has not reached great depth and is fresh with its own blood, then do not apply a poultice to it at the first hour, nor bind it tightly, so that the blood is not retained in its depth and returns to the heart, and kills the patient. Instead, apply an attractive ointment to it and soothe it for two days.
Si uero unguentum non est tibi praesens, tunc pone in orificio uulneris cotum uetustum, ut sugat illud quod egreditur de eo ex humiditatibus: et fac ut dormiat infirmus super uulnus, ut currat quod aggregatur in eo.	If you do not have an ointment at hand, then apply a soft cloth to the mouth of the wound, so that it sucks out what flows out from the humidities. And let the patient sleep on the wound, so that what accumulates in it runs clear.
Si uero iam praeterierint uulneri tres dies, aut plures, et non accidit infirmo spasmus, neque tremor cordis malus, neque strictura in anhelitu, et uides reliquas dispositiones eius bonas: tunc scias, quia uulnus est saluum.	If already three days or more have passed since the wound, and no spasm has befallen the patient, nor evil tremor of the heart, nor constriction in the breathing, and you see that all the other dispositions of his are good: then know that the wound is healthy.
Cura ergo ipsum et cum liciniis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with bandages and the rest of the treatment, until it is healed.
Si uero excusatur sanatio eius, et iam aperitur semper, tunc scias, quia iam factum est Fistula.	If indeed the healing of it is excavated, and it has now always opened up, then know that a Fistula has been made.
Cura ergo ipsam ex capitulo suo.	Then treat it from its head.
Et si uulnus est ex incisione ensis, aut cultelli, et est simplex in superficie pectoris, aut dorsi: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit ex sutura, si est magnum: aut cum puluere, si est paruum.	And if the wound is from a thrusting incision, or a knife, and is simple on the surface of the chest or back: then treat it with what has preceded from suture, if it is large: or with powder, if it is small.
Si autem iam fecit impressionem in osse, et incidit ex eo frusta: tunc inquire uulnus, et propera ad extrahendum illa frusta, si sunt separata.	If, however, it has already made an impression on the bone, and a fragment has broken off from it: then investigate the wound, and prepare to extract that fragment, if they are separated.
Si uero non sunt separata, tunc dimitte ea, donec putrefiat uulnus, alleuiatur enim extractio eorum.	If, however, they are not separated, then leave them, until the wound putrefies, for extraction of them is detrimental.
Reliquorum autem uulnerum accidentium in reliquis membris iudicium in curatione, est iudicium eius quod diximus.	The judgment concerning the rest of the accidental wounds in other members is the same as we have said.
Â¶ De uulneribus Ventris, et exitu intestini, et exitura eorum.	About wounds of the abdomen and the exit of the intestines, and their exits.
Caput LXXXVII.	Chapter 87.
Disruptio quae accidit uentri, est magna, et media, et parua.	The disruptions that occur in the abdomen are great, moderate, and small.
Ex magna igitur quandoque egreditur intestinum, aut numerus intestinorum.	From the great ones, it happens when the intestine protrudes out, or a portion of the intestines.
Quare fit intromissio eorum, et eorum sutura uehementior et difficilior.	Therefore, their introduction and their suture is more vehement and more difficult.
Et disruptio parua etiam fit difficilis ex modo alio.	And a small disruption also becomes difficult in another manner.
Sequitur ergo, ut sit reductio eorum difficilior, si non properas in intromissione sua ad locum suum statim: quoniam inflatur, aperitur, et ingrossatur: quare fit difficilis introitus eius.	It follows, therefore, that their reduction is more difficult, if you do not promptly return them to their place immediately during the introduction: because it swells, opens, and enlarges; therefore, their entry becomes difficult.
Propter hoc ergo fit melior disruptionum disruptio media: quoniam cum ea non fit difficilis reductio intestini, sicut fit dissicilis in his duabus speciebus.	On account of this, therefore, a moderate disruption is better: because when it does not make the reduction of the intestine difficult, as it is dissimilar in these two species.
Scias, quod sutura uenris est secundum quatuor modos.	You know that the suture of the abdomen is according to four modes.
Duae suturae communes conueniunt in sutura uentris, et in sutura reliquorum uulnerum corporis: et duae suturae aliae proprie communicant reliquis uulneribus.	Two common sutures are suitable for the suture of the abdomen and for the suture of other wounds of the body; and two other special sutures are proper for communicating with remaining wounds.
Verumtamen sunt magis propriae cum sutura uentris: et ego narro tibi unamquamque cum expositione, et declaratione.	However, they are more proper with the suture of the abdomen; and I will tell you each one with explanation and declaration.
Dico ergo, quia quando uulnus est paruum, et egreditur ex eo aliquid ex intestino, et fit difficile reducere ipsum: tunc illud est propter unum duorum modorum.	I say therefore, that when the wound is small and something protrudes from it out of the intestine, and it is difficult to reduce it; then it is on account of one of two modes.
Aut propter paruitatem disruptionis, sicut diximus: Aut quoniam in intestino est inflatio propter frigus aeris.	Or because of the smallness of the disruption, as we said; or because there is inflammation in the intestine due to the coldness of the air.
Quando ergo illud est ita, tunc oportet ut calefacias ipsum, ita ut submergas spongiam, aut pannum humidum in aqua tepida sola.	When therefore it is thus, then it is necessary to warm it, so that you apply a sponge or a humid cloth in lukewarm water alone.
Aut decoquas in aqua squinantum, et cyperum, et spicam, et embroces cum ea intestinum, donec resoluatur inflatio.	Or you boil in water squinancy, and cypress, and spike, and embroces with it the intestine, until the inflammation is resolved.
Quandoque facit illud uinum in quo est stipticitas: et est melius quam aqua sola in resolutione inflationis.	When it makes that wine in which there is astringency: and it is better than water alone in resolving inflammation.
Cum ergo uides inflationem iam resolui, tunc humecta intestinum cum aqua in qua decocta est altea, aut malua.	Since you see the inflammation is already resolved, then moisten the intestine with water in which has been decocted either marshmallow or mallow.
Nam per illud alleuiatur introitus eius cum re parua.	For through that, its entrance is alleviated with minimal effort.
Si autem excusatur reditus eius post hanc curationem, tunc finde in disruptione parum, cum instrumento quo secantur hemorrhoides.	If, however, its return is excavated after this treatment, then find a small opening in the disruption, with an instrument which cuts into hemorrhoids.
Et curatio prima est melior quando praeparatur, quam sectio: et non fit coactio ad secandum post necessitatem et defectum instrumenti.	And the first treatment is better when it is prepared, than cutting: and there is no need to cut after necessity and failure of the instrument.
Sit pars eius una quae est torta, acuta, et pars eius altera non acuta, et extremitas subtilis non sit cum subtilitate Spatumilis, imo sit obtusior parumper: et est illa quae similatur caiada, sicut uides.	There is one part of it which is twisted, sharp, and another part not sharp, and the extremity should not be with the subtlety of a spatula, but rather more obtuse; and that is what resembles a reed, as you see.
Cum ergo amplificatur uulnus, et ingreditur intestinum, tunc oportet, ut sit reductio eius secundum formam suam naturalem in loco suo sibi proprio, si possibile est super illud: quoniam est melius.	Since the wound is enlarged and enters into the intestine, then it is necessary that its reduction be according to its natural form in its own proper place, if possible, because it is better.
Quando uero disruptio est ampla in inferiori parte uentris: tunc oportet ut facias iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et pone crura sua altiora capite suo.	When the disruption is large in the lower part of the belly: then it is necessary to make the weak person lie on their back, and place their knees higher than their head.
Et si est in superiore parte uentris, tunc pone caput eius, et pectus ipsius altiora quam eius inferiora.	And if it is in the upper part of the belly, then place his head and chest higher than his lower parts.
Et similiter si est disruptio in una duarum partium uentris, tunc pone intentionem tuam, et tuam considerationem semper in hoc, ut pars in qua est uulnus sit altior parte altera.	And similarly, if there is a disruption in one of the two parts of the belly, then place your intention and your consideration always in this, that the part where the wound is should be higher than the other part.
Et ita oportet, ut admimistres illud in uulneribus magnis, et in uulneribus mediis.	And thus it is necessary to administer it in great wounds and in medium-sized wounds.
In uulneribus autem paruis, pone illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	In small wounds, place it according to what is prepared for you.
Deinde fac ut sit praesens inter manus tuas minister pius, qui teneat disruptionem totam manu sua: et aggrega labia eius.	Then make sure that the pious minister is present between your hands, who holds the entire disruption with his hand, and brings together its lips.
Deinde detege ex ea ei qui sequitur suturam aliquid post aliquid: et iste est modus suturae communis unius.	Then, he should remove from it what follows the suture, something after something, and this is the common method of a single suture.
Et est, ut accipias acum, aut numerum acuum secundum quantitatem amplitudinis uulneris.	And it is so that you should receive the needle, or the number of needles secondly according to the quantity of the width of the wound.
Deinde dimitte ab extremitate disruptionis quantitatem digiti anularis, id est, medici: et fige acum unam praeter quod intromittas in eam filum in duabus extremitatibuis cutis, cum duabus extremitatibus sifac quod est sub cute ab interioribus, donec facias eam penetrare ab alia parte, et tu iam aggregasti duas extremitates cutis, et duas extremitates sifac: et fiunt quatuor ordines.	Then, let the measure of the disruption from the extremity be the quantity of the ring finger, that is, of the physician; and fix a needle beyond what you introduce into it, a thread in two extremities of the skin, with two extremities of the suture which is beneath the skin from the inside, until you make it penetrate from the other side, and you have now joined two extremities of the skin, and two extremities of the suture: and there are four orders.
Deinde stringe cum filo duplo in circumitu acus aliquotiens a duabus partibus simul, quousque sint aggregata duo labia uulneris aggregatione decenti.	Then, tie with a double thread around the circumference of the needle several times on both sides simultaneously, until the two lips of the wound are joined together in a decent aggregation.
Deinde dimitte grossitudinem digiti etiam, et fige in eis acum aliam: postea reta eam cum filo, sicut fecisti cum acu prima.	Then, let the thickness of the finger also be measured, and fix another needle in them; afterwards, tie it with a thread, just as you did with the first needle.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum eo quo indiges ex acubus, donec compleas constrictionem uulneris totius.	Do not cease to do that with what you need from the needles, until you complete the constricting of the entire wound.
Et sint acus mediae inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem: quoniam acus subtiles ualde uelociter incidunt carnem: et grossae sunt difficilis introitus in cutem: propter illud oportet ut sint mediae in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	And let the needles be medium between thickness and subtlety: because subtle needles indeed quickly pierce the flesh; and thick ones are difficult to introduce into the skin: on account of this it is necessary that they be medium in subtlety and thickness.
Et non oportet, ut figatur acus in duabus extremitatibus cutis propinquae multum: ut non incidatur caro uelociter, et aperiatur uulnus ante consolidationem sui, et non elongentur etiam cum sutura, ut non prohibeatur uulnus a consolidatione.	And it is not necessary that the needles be fixed in two extremities of the skin close together much: so that the flesh is not quickly pierced, and the wound is not opened before its consolidation, and they are not elongated also with the suture, so that the wound is not prevented from consolidation.
Deinde incide extremitatem acuum, ut non laedant infirmum apud somnum suum: et pone eis puluillos ex pannis ab omni parte, qui teneant extremitates acuum: et dimitte eos, donec scias quod uulnus iam consolidatum est.	Then, cut the extremity of the needle, so that they do not hurt the weak part during their sleep; and put small pads made of cloth on all sides, which hold the extremities of the needle: and let them be, until you know that the wound is already consolidated.
Et haec quidem species suturae cum acubus taliter est conuenientior in uulneribus paruis.	And indeed this type of suture with a needle is more convenient in small wounds.
Quoniam sufficit in sutura eorum acus una, aut duae, aut circiter eas.	Because one or two stitches are sufficient for their closure, or around them.
Sutura autem secunda communis est, ut aggreges cum sutura extremitates quatuor: extremitates, duas cutis, et extremitates duas sifac in uice una, cum acu in qua sit filum inuolutum aequale in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	The second common suture is when you gather four extremities: two skin extremities and two subcutaneous extremities in one vein, with a needle in which there is an equal thread wrapped in subtlety and thickness.
Deinde quando penetraueris cum acu has extremitates quatuor, reduc acum a parte a qua incaepisti eadem, ut cadat filum retatum a superiori parte uulneris: ut sit sutura, sicut sutura panni quo stringuntur panni, et pone inter omnem suturam quantitatem grossitudinis digiti minoris.	Then when you penetrate with the needle these four extremities, withdraw the needle from the part where you inserted it, so that the thread returns to the superior part of the wound: as if it were a suture, like the suture of cloth which is stitched together, and place between the entire suture a quantity of thickness equal to the width of the little finger.
Hanc autem suturam sciunt homines.	Men know this suture.
Et cum hac sutura ego sui uulnus quod acciderat uiro in uentre suo, qui fuerat uulneratus cum cultello, et erat disruptio uulneris maior palmo uno: et exierat ex intestinis circiter duos palmos ex intestino medio, et erat disruptio in medio uentris.	And with this suture I treated a wound that had occurred to a man in his belly, who had been wounded by a knife, and there was a major disruption of the wound the size of one palm, and about two palms of intestine had come out from the middle of the intestines, and there was a disruption in the middle of the abdomen.
Reduxi ergo illud postquam stetit intestinum eius extra uulnus xxiiii horis.	I restored it after the intestine had stood outside the wound for 23 hours.
Consolidatum est ergo uulnus in spacio quod fuit circiter XV dies: et curaui ipsum, et sanatus est: et uixit post illud annis multis, conuersatus in suis dispositionibus.	The wound was consolidated in the space of about 15 days: and I treated it, and he was healed: and he lived many years after that, enjoying his own faculties.
Et medici iudicauerant, quod non sanaretur.	And the physicians had judged that he would not be healed.
Et ex miraculo fuit, quod non curaui illud cum unguento.	And it was a miracle that I did not treat it with an ointment.
Quoniam fui in loco in quo non inueniebatur unguentum, neque aliquid ex medicinis.	For I was in a place where neither ointment nor any medicines were found.
Posui ergo super uulnus cotum uetustum bis in die, et assiduaui ablutionem eius cum aqua mellis, donec sanatum est.	I therefore applied an old cloth over the wound twice a day, and I continually washed it with honey water until it was healed.
Duas autem species suturae proprias dicam secundum narrationem sermonis.	But I will describe two special types of suture according to the narrative of my speech.
Et est, ut incipias cum sutura acuta: et intromittas acum ab exteriori ad interiorem partem.	And it is, as you begin with a sharp suture: and you insert a needle from the outer to the inner part.
Cum ergo penetrat acus in cutem, et in lacertum euntem secundum longitudinem et latitudinem totius corporis: dimitte extremitatem sifac in latere in quo intromisisti acum, et fac penetrare in extremitatem aliam ab interiori parte ad exteriorem in extremitate altera mirach.	When therefore the needle penetrates into the skin, and into the inner part of the body according to the length and width of the whole body: release the extremity of the suture on the side where you inserted the needle, and make it penetrate from the inner part to the outer part in another extremity of the opposite side.
Cum ergo feceris eam penetrare, tunc fac eam penetrare secundum hoc in eadem hac extremitate mirach ab exteriori parte ad interiorem: et dimitte extremitatem sifac, quae est in hoc latere, et fac penetrare acum in extremitatem alteram ab interiori parte ad exteriorem: et fac penetrare cum penetratione tua qua facis eam penetrare in sifac extremitate mirach, quae est in parte eius, donec penetret in ipsum totum.	When therefore you have made it penetrate, then make it penetrate according to this in the same extremity from the outer part to the inner: and release the extremity of the suture, which is on this side, and make the needle penetrate into another extremity from the inner part to the outer: and make it penetrate with your penetration, by which you make it penetrate into the extremity of the suture, which is in that part, until it penetrates into the whole itself.
Deinde incipe etiam ab hoc eodem latere, et sue ipsum cum extremitate, quae est ex sifac in latere alio, et extrahe acum ex cute quam penetrauit.	Then begin also from the same side, and sew it together with the extremity that is on the other side of the suture, and extract the needle from the skin where it penetrated.
Deinde reduc eam in illam cutem, et sue extremitatem sifac, quae est in latere alio, cum hac extremitate mirach: et extrahe eam ex cute quae est ex parte eius, et fac illud uice una, et alia: et fac illud uice post uicem, usquequo suas extrinsecum totum secundum illud exemplum.	Then reduce it into that skin, and sew the extremity of the suture, which is on the other side, with this extremity of the opposite side: and extract it from the skin which is on its part, and make it one, and another: and make it one after the seam, until you have completed the whole thing according to that example.
Et summa huius suturae, est ut suas sutura pellipariorum qua suunt pelles: ita ut suas sifac uice una ex parte una extremitate cutis: et ut dimittas eam uice alia ex parte alia, donec compleas.	And the summary of this suture is that you should sew the skin like a pelliparior, who sews skins: so that you make one seam from one part of the extremity of the skin: and so that you release it from another part, until you complete.
Secunda species suturae propriae, quam dixit Gale nus.	The second type of proper suture, which Galen described.
Iste eius sermo narratus est, ut suas eam secundum similitudinem, qua suunt eas quidam medicantium, ita quod aggregant omnem partem ad comparem suam conuenientem per naturam: et applicant extremitatem sifac ad eius aliam extremitatem, et extremitatem mirach ad extremitatem eius aliam.	This sermon of his is narrated, that you should sew it according to the similarity, by which some physicians sew them, so that they aggregate every part to its suitable natural congruence: and apply the extremity of the suture to its other extremity, and the opposing extremity to its other opposing extremity.
Et illud fit secundum quod narro tibi.	And that is secondary because I will narrate it to you.
Oportet ut figas acum in extremitatem mirach propinquam tibi ab exteriori parte, et facias eam penetrare ad interiorem in eo solo: et dimittas duas extremitates sifac.	It is necessary to place the scalpel on the extremity of the member near to you from the outer part, and make it penetrate to the inner part alone: and let the two extremities of the skin be sewn together.
Deinde reuolue acum, et fac eam penetrare ab exteriori parte ad interiorem in duas extremitates sifac, scilicet utrinque.	Then turn around the scalpel, and make it penetrate from the outer part to the inner part in both extremities of the skin, namely on both sides.
Deinde reuolue utrasque, etiam fac penetrare utrasque ab interiori usque ad exteriorem, in duas extremitates mirach alias, quae sunt in latere opposito.	Then turn around both, and also make them penetrate both from the inner part to the outer part, in two extremities of the member, which are on the opposite lateral side.
Et iste modus suturae est melior sutura communi facili, et est sutura cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And this method of sewing is better than the common easy sewing, and it is a sewing that precedes remembrance.
Iste est ergo sermo Galeni etiam.	This is therefore also the discourse of Galen.
Et dixerunt quidam.	And some people said.
Retificatur sutura uentris cum duabus acubus.	The wound is restored with a suture and two cups.
Quod est, ut intromittas in eis utrisque filum unum: et incipe cum intromissione acus, ex eo quod est apud te, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, secundum suturam eorum qui suunt coria aequaliter.	That is, to introduce into them a single thread: and begin with the introduction of the needle, from what is at hand, and make it penetrate up to the other side, according to the suture of those who sew leathers equally.
Et scias, quod quando disruptio est in medio uentris: tunc sutura eius est difficilior quam reliquorum locorum uentris.	And know that when there is a disruption in the middle of the wound, then its suture is more difficult than those of other places of the wound.
Iudicium uero medicationis uulneris, est iudicium reliquorum uulnerum.	The judgment of the medicine for wounds is the judgment of other wounds.
Quod est, quia quando tu consequeris uulnus recens cum sanguine suo, antequam alteret ipsum aer: et reducis intestinum, et suis ipsum, et aptas ipsum: tunc pone super puluerem incarnatiuum.	That is, because when you treat a fresh wound with its own blood, before it changes into air: and you reduce the inflammation, and soothe it, and adapt it: then put on top an incarnative powder.
Quod si aer iam alterauit uulnus: tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, quae sunt tibi praesentia, donec faciant pus: et cadant fila, et consolidentur sifac, et mirach.	But if the air has already changed the wound: then put on top of it certain ointments that are present to you, until they make pus: and the threads fall out, and the skin is consoled, and the member is restored.
Deinde cura illud sicut est curatio reliquorum uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it as it is the treatment of other wounds, until it is healed.
Si autem non sunt tibi praesentes medicinae, tunc pone super ipsum statim, exquo incipit emittere pus, cotum uetus: et permuta ipsum bis in die, sicut docui te, donec sanetur.	If you do not have medicines present, then apply to it at once, from which it begins to emit pus, an old custom: and change it twice a day, as I have directed you, until it heals.
Nam tu non indiges medicatione alia in pluribus dispositionibus, quando uulnera sunt simplicia.	For you do not need medicines in various preparations when the wounds are simple.
Si autem times, quod communicet uulnus membris principalibus in laesione, tunc oportet ut submergas lanam lenem in oleo temperatae caliditatis, aut in oleo rosato: et pone ipsam in circumitu locorum quae sunt inter inguina, et sub ascellas.	If, however, the wound communicates with principal members in the lesion, then it is necessary to immerse a soft linen cloth in oil of tempered warmth, or in rose oil: and apply it to the surrounding areas which are between the groin and under the arm-pits.
Quod si sentit dolorem, aut punctiones, aut putrefactionem in intestinis suis (nam multotiens accidit illud) tunc clisteriza ipsum cum uino stiptico, nigro, tepido: praecipue si putredo iam peruenit in intestino, et facta est exitura penetrans usque ad concauitatem eius.	If you feel pain, or pricking, or putrefaction in your intestines (for it often happens thus), then clysterize it with a tepid wine, black and sharp: especially if the putrefaction has already reached the intestine, and a penetrating evacuation has been made up to its concavity.
Et scias, quod illud quod est ex intestino grosso, est facilioris sanationis: et quod ex eis est ex subtili, difficilioris sanationis.	And know that what is from the gross intestine is of easier healing: and what is from the subtle ones is of more difficult healing.
Intestinum autem quod nominatur Ieiunum, non suscipit sanationem ex uulnere quod accidit in eo omnino: et illud est propter multitudinem eius, quod est ex uenis, et magnitudine earum, et propter subtilitatem corporis eius, et propinquitatem ipsius naturae neruorum.	The intestine which is called the Jejunum, does not receive healing from a wound that occurs in it at all: and this is because of its multitude, which is from the veins, and their greatness, and because of the subtlety of its body, and the proximity of its natural nerves.
Si autem illud quod procedit ex uulnere est zirbum, et consequeris ipsum recens: reduc ipsum secundum reductionem tuam, qua reducis intestina aequaliter.	If, however, what proceeds from the wound is a flux, and you follow it freshly: reduce it according to your reduction, by which you reduce the intestines equally.
Si uero praeteriit ei spacium, et iam factum est uiride, aut nigrum: tunc oportet ut stringas ipsum cum filo supra locum qui denigratus est ex eo, ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	If, indeed, the space has passed for it, and it has already been made green or black: then it is necessary to tie it with a thread above the place that has been stained by it, so that there may not be an efflux of blood.
In zirbo enim sunt uenae et arteriae.	For in the flux, indeed, there are veins and arteries.
Deinde incide quod est praeter illud ligamentum, et pone duas extremitates fili pendentes ex inferiori parte uulneris extra ipsum: ut alleuietur super te attractio eius, et extractio ipsius apud casum zirbi, et emissionem pus uulneris.	Then cut what is beyond that ligament, and apply two hanging extremities of a thread from the lower part of the wound outside it: so that the attraction of it may be alleviated above you, and the extraction of it may be made at the time of the flux, and the emission of pus from the wound.
Â¶ Rememoratio uulneris quod accidit in Intestino.	The remembering of a wound that occurred in the intestine.
Quando accidit disruptio in Intestino, et est parua: tunc possibile est, ut restauretur in quibusdam hominibus: propterea, quia ego uidi qui fuit uulneratus in uentre suo cum percussione lanceae, et erat uulnus a dextra stomachi, et antiquatum est uulnus: et factum Fistula, et exiuit ex eo egestio, et uentositas.	When disruption occurs in the intestine and it is small, then it is possible that it can be restored in certain individuals; for I have seen a man who was wounded in his belly by a lance's thrust, and the wound was on the right side of the stomach, and an old wound had become fistula, and pus came out from it, and there was flatulence.
Posui ergo curationem, usque quod ego non fui confisus in sanatione eius: neque cessaui subtiliare ipsum, donec sanatus est, et consolidatus est locus.	I therefore applied a treatment until I was not confused about his healing: nor did I cease to carefully attend to him until he was healed and the affected area was consolidated.
Postquam ego uidi locum iam consolidatum, timui super infirmum, quod accideret super infirmum accidens malum in uentre suo: et non accidit ei ex illo accidens malum.	After I saw the affected area was already consolidated, I feared for the weak patient, lest something bad should happen to him regarding his weakened stomach; and nothing bad happened to him from that weakness.
Et remansit in melioribus dispositionibus suis, comedens et bibens, et futuens, et intrauit balneum, et exercitatus est in dietis suis.	And he remained in his better physical condition, eating and drinking, and evacuating, and he took a bath, and he exercised in his usual routines.
Et iam dixerunt quidam experimentatorum, quia quando accidit in Intestino uulnus, et est paruum: tunc oportet ut ligetur secundum hunc modum.	And now some experimenters have said that when a wound occurs in the intestine and it is small, then it is necessary to bind it up according to this method.
Et est, ut accipias formicas magnorum capitum.	And it is so that you should receive the forms of large-headed poultices.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, et pone formicam unam ex eis quae habeant os apertum super duo labia uulneris.	Then bring together the two lips of the wound, and place a poultice, one of those that have an open mouth over the two lips of the wound.
Cum ergo capit super ea, et stringit os suum, abscinde caput eius, adhaeret enim, et non soluitur.	When it thus takes hold on them, and closes its mouth, cut off its head, for it adheres and does not come loose.
Deinde pone formicam aliam prope primam, et non cesses facere illud cum formica post formicam secundum quantitatem uulneris totius.	Then place another poultice near the first one, and do not cease to apply it with a poultice following a poultice according to the quantity of the entire wound.
Deinde reduc ipsum, et sue uulnus.	Then reduce it, and close up the wound.
Illa enim capita remanent annexa in Intestino, donec cibetur Intestinum, et sanetur, et non accidat infirmo nocumentum penitus.	For those heads remain attached in the intestine until the intestine is digested, and it heals, and no harm is done to the weak patient through this method.
Et iam possibile est, ut ligetur Intestinum etiam cum filo subtili: quod abstersum est ex intestino animalis, annexo cum eo postquam intromittitur in acum.	And it is possible to tie off the intestine as well with a subtle thread: which is taken from the gut of an animal, and is attached to it after being inserted into the point.
Et est, ut accipias extremitatem huius fili ex intestino, et excarnetur multum.	And it is, that you take the extremity of this thread from the intestine, and much of its flesh is removed.
Deinde liga in extremitate eius filum lini subtile inuolutum.	Then tie the extremity of the thread with a subtle flaxen cord that is wrapped around.
Deinde intromitte illud filum in acum, et sue cum eo intestinum.	Then insert that thread into the point, and sew the intestine to it.
Deinde reduc ipsum in disruptionem.	Then reduce it into a place of rupture.
Et iste modus suturae cum formicis et intestino, non est nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	And this method of suture with caterpillars and intestine is not relied upon except as a way of trust and hope.
Scias, uulnus quod est magnum, amplum, praecipue si est in uno intestinorum gracilium: tunc non est ingenium nisi subtiliatio, neque est eius sanatio omnino.	You know that it is a great and large wound, especially if it is in one of the slender intestines: then there is no ingenuity except subtlety, nor is its healing complete.
Â¶ De cura Zuchemen, et Fistularum.	On the treatment of Ulcers and Fistulas.
Caput LXXXVIII.	Chapter 88.
Scias, quod omne uulnus, aut apostema quando ueterascit et antiquatur, et fit ulcus, et non consolidatur, et emittit pus semper, et non abscinditur: tunc nominatur uniuersaliter in quocunque membro fuerit Fistula, et nos nominamus ipsum Zuchemen.	You know that every wound or aposteme, when it grows old and chronic, and becomes an ulcer, and does not consolidate, and always discharges pus, and is not separated: then it is universally called a Fistula in whatever member it may be, and we call it Zuchemen.
Et Fistula quidem est secundum ueritatem nodatio filtrata, dura, alba: cum qua non est dolor, cui est concauitas pennae auis: et propter illud nominant eam quidam Risati, id est, pennam.	And indeed a Fistula is a hardened, white, filtering nodulation, according to the truth; when there is no pain, in which case it is called by some people Risati, that is, a wing.
Et est in quibusdam horis humida, quae emittit pus.	And it is at times humid, which discharges pus.
Et fortasse scinditur humiditas in quibusdam horis.	And perhaps the humidity is separated at certain times.
Et quandoque est haec humiditas multa, et est pauca: et est grossa, et est subtilis.	And sometimes this humidity is abundant, and it is slight; and it is coarse, and it is subtle.
Et ego iam praemisi in diuisione, tunc cum dixi uulnera, quod omne ulcus quod non sanatur, neque nascitur in eo caro, non est illud nisi propter unam nouem caussarum.	And I have already mentioned in the division, then when I said wounds, that every ulcer that does not heal, nor is flesh born in it, is not that except on account of one of the nine new causes.
Quarum una est, aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore: aut propter maliciam eius: aut quoniam inter ipsum, et super labia eius est caro dura, prohibens natiuitatem carnis: aut quia est multae sordis et sordiciei: aut quoniam ulcus in seipso est putridum, et materia quae mittitur ei est malae qualitatis: aut quoniam medicina est inconueniens in curatione eius: aut quoniam corruptio cadens in regione est genus pestilentiae, aut per proprietatem in regione, sicut accidit in Caesaraugusta: in qua fit difficilis digestio aegritudinum, et tardatur in ea sanatio apostematum per naturam: aut quoniam in eo est os unum, aut numerus ossium.	There are four reasons why a wound does not heal: either because of the scarcity of blood in the body, or because of its bad quality; or because there is hard, rough flesh between it and the surrounding skin, preventing the growth of new flesh; or because it is full of much filth and corruption; or because the ulcer itself is putrid and the material that is applied to it is of poor quality; or because medicine is inconvenient for its cure; or because a pestilential decay occurs in the region, or through the peculiarity of the region, as happens in Caesaraugusta: where digestion of diseases becomes difficult, and healing of abscesses is slow by nature; or because there is one bone, or the number of bones.
Et ego iam ostendi omnes istas caussas et signa earum, et curationes ipsarum cum medicinis in diuisione: et oportet hic ut faciam te scire curationem Fistulae et Zuken, quae fit per uiam operationis cum manu.	And I have already shown all these causes and signs of them, and their cures with medicines in the division; and it is necessary here that I should make you know the cure for Fistulas and Ulcers, which is done by an operation with the hand.
Scias ergo, quod Fistula accidit in omnibus membris corporis.	Know therefore, that a Fistula occurs in all parts of the body.
Nam ex eis sunt Fistulae quae perueniunt ad uenas magnas et arterias, aut neruos, aut sifac: aut ad intestinum, aut ad uesicam, aut ad aliquam ex costis: aut ad aliquam ex spondilibus dorsi, aut ad aliquam iuncturarum compositarum compositione: sicut manus, et pedis: et ex eis sunt quae uadunt ad propinquitatem membri principalis, et similium.	For among them are Fistulas that reach the large veins and arteries, or nerves, or skin; or to the intestines, or to the bladder, or to some of the ribs; or to some of the dorsal vertebrae, or to some of the composite joints: such as the hands and feet: and among them are those that approach the proximity of the main limb, and similar things.
Quae ergo ex his Fistulis est secundum hunc modum, est ex aegritudinibus difficilis sanationis, et non recipit curationem, et occupatio cum ea est labor et ignorantia.	Therefore, those among these Fistulas that are according to this mode, are from diseases difficult to heal, and do not receive a cure, and the occupation with them is labor and ignorance.
Quod si est ex Fistulis aliqua cuius profunditas non peruenit ad haec loca quae dixi: et speras, et confidis in curatione eius, et uis peruenire ad cognitionem illius, tunc accipe tentam ex aere, aut ferro, si Fistula tendit secundum rectitudinem, et perquire eam cum ipsa.	Because if it is from a Fistula whose depth does not reach those places that I mentioned: and you hope, and trust in its cure, and wish to penetrate to the knowledge of it, then take a probe made of copper or iron, if the Fistula tends according to straightness, and explore it with the same.
Si autem in Fistula est tortuositas, tunc inuestiga eam cum tenta de plumbo subtili.	If there is a twisting in the fistula, then probe it with a lead thread.
Quoniam plumbum cum lenitate sui corporis alleuiatur, et curuatur circa tortuositatem.	Because the lead, with its own softness, adapts to the body and curves around the twisting.
Quod si Fistula est habens orificia multa, non est tibi possibile ut significes super eam cum tenta.	What if the fistula has many openings, it is not possible for you to mark it out with a thread.
Clisteriza ergo ex eis orificium ex orificiis suis.	Therefore, inject through one of its openings, or through its own openings.
Nam humiditas qua clisterizas ipsum, uadit uersus orificia alia, et currit ex eis.	For the moisture that you inject, it flows back out through other openings, and flows out from them.
Deinde exquisite inquire secundum quem modum est tibi possibile: ut cognoscas quod illic est os, aut neruus, et est Fistulae concauitas longinqua, aut propinqua: aut est Fistula una cui sunt orificia multa, et sta super totum illud, cum summa fortitudinis tuae: cum interrogatione tua, qua interrogas infirmum, et inuentione doloris apud compressionem cum manu tua super locum, et similibus ex significationibus et caussis accidentibus apostemati.	Then, you should carefully inquire into the manner in which it is possible for you to know: whether there is a bone, or a nerve, and if the fistula is concave and distant, or near; or if it is a fistula with many openings, and stands over the whole area, with the greatest strength of yours; with your questioning, by which you question the weak point, and in the invention of pain upon compression with your hand over the place, and similar signs and causes of accidental apostemes.
Cum ergo steteris super omnia illa statione uera, tunc uade ad curationem secundum confidentiam: et est, ut consideres tunc, si est Fistula propinqua apparens, aut in loco saluo longinquo a iunctura, aut a neruo, aut arteria, aut uena, aut uno locorum quae dixi tibi: tunc seca Fistulam secundum quod praemissum est ex narratione mea, et aufer quod est in ea ex filtratione, et carnibus corruptis, quod nascitur in orificio eius ex carne, aut thelul, et similibus: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	When you stand over all those true stations, then proceed to the cure with confidence; and it is, as you consider then, if the fistula appears near, or in a safe place far from a joint, or nerve, or artery, or vein, or one of the places which I told you: then sever the fistula according to what has been premised from my narrative, and remove what is in it through filtration, and corrupt flesh, which grows in its opening from the flesh, or fat, and similar things: and cure it, until it is healed.
Si autem Fistula est longinquae profunditatis, et est secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut seces eam in profundo quantum est tibi possibile.	If the fistula is of great depth and is according to straightness, then it is necessary to cut it as deeply as possible.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex omnibus carnibus eius corruptis.	Then cleanse it of all its corrupted flesh.
Deinde administra licinia inuoluta in medicinis acutis: et intromitte ea usque ad concauitatem Fistulae quam comprehendisti cum ferro: fac cum ea illud aliquotiens, donec corrodat medicina acuta totum quod remansit in concauitate Fistulae ex corruptione.	Then administer wrapped-on liniments in acute medicines; and insert them up to the concavity of the fistula which you comprehended with the iron: do it several times, until the acute medicine corrodes all that remains in the concavity of the fistula from the corruption.
Deinde restaura ipsam cum unguentis quae generant carnem sanam, donec sanetur.	Then restore it with ointments that generate healthy flesh, until it is healed.
Si uero non sanatur per illud, tunc cauteriza ipsam secundum quod narrauimus.	If it does not heal through that, then cauterize it according to what we have narrated.
Si ergo caussa Fistulae est os, et certificatur apud te illud: tunc inquire ipsum, et seca ipsum secundum quod narraui tibi: si non prohibet te aliquid ex uena, aut neruo, aut membro principali, sicut diximus.	If the cause of the fistula is bone, and it is certified to you in that: then investigate it, and dissect it according to what I have narrated to you: if nothing prohibits you from a vein, or nerve, or principal member, as we have said.
Si ergo detegitur tibi os, et est in eo quiddam corruptionis, et nigredinis: tunc rade ipsum, donec auferatur corruptio eius tota.	If then a bone is detected by you, and there is in it some decay, and blackness: then scrape it, until the entire corruption is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with that which brings flesh to it, until it is healed.
Quod si non sanatur, et emittat pus sicut faciebat: tunc scias, quod tu non peruenisti ad totam eradicationem corruptionis.	What if it does not heal, and discharges pus as it was doing: then know that you did not achieve the complete eradication of the corruption.
Detege ergo super illud secundo, et exquisite fac rasionem eius, et mundificationem ipsius cum ultima fortitudine tua.	Then detect it again a second time, and make an exquisite examination of its reason, and purification of it with your utmost strength.
Deinde restaura ipsum.	Then restore it.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est: et si non, tunc scias quod illa corruptio est in profunditate longinqua corporis, quam non es consecutus.	If then it is healed, it is good: and if not, then know that the corruption is in a remote depth of the body, which you have not reached.
Non est ergo tibi in ea ingenium, nisi dimittere ipsam naturae.	There is no ingenuity for you in this, except to leave it to nature.
Quod si corruptum est os paruum, et est possibile tibi, attrahe ipsum cum forficibus subtilibus quae conueniunt ad illud.	What if the corrupted bone is small, and it is possible for you, extract it with subtle forceps that are suitable for that.
Si autem sunt ossa multa, tunc exquisite fac attractionem eorum omnium, neque dimittas ex eis aliquid cum tua fortitudine.	If there are many bones, then make an exquisite extraction of all of them, and do not leave anything of them with your strength.
Si uero contrarietatem facit tibi aliquid ex humiditatibus, et non est in incisione eorum timor, uel error: tunc incide illas humiditates et carnes, si sunt illic, et libera ossa.	If however something resists you from the moistures, and there is no fear of incision among them, or error: then incise those moistures and flesh, if they are there, and free the bones.
Si uero non est tibi praeparatio auferendi ossa ex hora tua, tunc pone super uulnus quod putrefaciat ipsum: et dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat quod est in circumitu illorum ossium ex carnibus et humiditatibus.	If however there is no preparation for you to remove the bones at this hour, then place on the wound what will putrefy it: and leave it, until it putrefies what is around those bones from the flesh and moistures.
Et custodi uulnus ut non consolidetur.	And take care that the wound is not consolidated.
Et constringatur sectio quam tu secuisti in operatione tua.	And let the section be constricted as you have cut it out in your operation.
Imo pone super ipsum, si times, cotum submersum sulfure trito cum oleo: aut cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio, aut aliquo unguentorum uiridium.	Put on top of it, if you wish, a cotton pad soaked in sulphur and oil; or a cotton pad soaked in Egyptian ointment, or some other green ointment.
Nam quando putrefient illae scilicet humiditates, et separantur ex eis ossa, alleuiatur ablatio eorum, et ipsorum attractio.	For when those parts putrefy, that is to say become moist, and the bones are separated from them, their removal and their attraction are alleviated.
Si autem est os unum magnum, sicut os cruris, aut os coxae, et similia illis, et quod ex eo corruptum est, est pars magna: tunc rade ipsum rasione ultima, donec auferatur illa nigredo et corruptio.	But if there is one large bone, such as the thigh bone or hip bone, and similar to those, and a large part has become corrupted from it, then scrape that very bone with the last scraping, until that blackness and corruption are removed.
Deinde restaura uulnus.	Then restore the wound.
Si uero quod est in eo corruptum, est pars magna, et corruptio iam consecuta est medullam ossis, tunc necesse est serrare ipsum, et incidere ipsum totum usque ad locum, ubi peruenit corruptio: tunc cura ipsum, donec consolidetur.	But if what is corrupted in it is a large part, and the corruption has already reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to saw it, and cut it entirely up to the place where the corruption reaches; then care for it until it is consolidated.
Et ego narro tibi zuken, quae accidit uiro in crure suo: ut ponas ipsam exemplum et adiutorium super operationem tuam.	And I relate to you the case of a man who had it on his thigh, so that you may put this example and aid upon your operation.
Fuit uir iuuenis aetate circiter triginta annos, cui accidit dolor in crure suo, a caussa quae mota est super ipsum intra corpus, id est, ab interioribus, donec peruenerunt materiae ad crus, et apostematum est apostemate magno: et non fuit ei caussa extrinseca.	There was a young man of about thirty years old, who had pain in his thigh, from a cause that was moved within his body, that is, from the interior, until the matter reached the thigh, and it became an abscess with a large swelling: and there was no external cause for him.
Extensum est ergo cum eo tempus cum errore medicorum, donec apertum est apostema, et concurrerunt cum eo materiae multae.	It was extended therefore over a long time with error of the doctors, until the abscess opened, and many matters concurred with it.
Et postposita est curatio eius, donec fistulatum est crus, et facta sunt in eo orificia multa: quae omnia emittebant pus, et humiditates corporis.	And his treatment was put off until the thigh became fistulous, and many openings were made in it: which all emitted pus and bodily fluids.
Curauit ergo ipsum multitudo medicorum circiter duos annos, et non fuit in eo sapiens in arte manus, donec uocatus sum, et uidi crus eius, et materias quae currebant ex illis orificiis cursu magno: etiam omne uiri corpus iam tabuerat, et color eius citrinus erat.	Many doctors therefore treated him for almost two years, and there was no one skilled in the art of healing among them, until I was called, and I saw his thigh, and the matters that were flowing out from those openings in a great flow: also the whole body of the man was already exhausted, and his color was yellowish.
Intromisi ergo tentam in uno locorum orificiorum, et peruenit tenta ad os.	I will insert a probe into one of the nostrils, and it reaches the passage to the bone.
Deinde perscrutatus sum orificia omnia: et inueni ea peruenire ad se inuicem ex omnibus partibus cruris.	Then I explored all the orifices, and I found them to reach into the hollow of the thigh through all parts of the leg.
Properaui ergo, et secui super unum illorum orificiorum, donec detexi partem ossis: et inueni ipsum corruptum: quod iam corrosum erat, et denigratum, et putruerat, et perforatum erat, donec penetrauerat usque ad medullam.	I probed further, and I cut into one of those orifices, until I detected a part of the bone: and I found it corrupted; which was already corroded, and blackened, and putrid, and perforated, until it had penetrated to the marrow.
Serraui ergo quod detectum est mihi, et praeparatum ex osse corrupto.	I sawed away what was detected by me, and I prepared it from the corrupted bone.
Et deputaui, quod non esset in osse nisi illa corruptio, quam abscidi, et serraui.	And I removed, so that there would be nothing in the bone except that corruption, which I cut away and sawed off.
Et ego iam eradicaueram eam.	And I had now eradicated it.
Deinde posui restaurationem uulneris cum medicinis consolidatiuis spacio longo.	Then I applied a restoration of the wound with consolidating medicines over a long period of time.
Et non est consolidatum.	And it did not consolidate.
Deinde tentaui, et detexi super os secundo supra detectionem primam: et inueni corruptionem continuam cum osse: et serraui quod apparuit mihi etiam ex illa corruptione.	Then I probed, and I detected above the bone a second time above the primary detection: and I found a continuous corruption with the bone: and I sawed away what appeared to me also from that corruption.
Deinde conatus sum restaurationem eius.	Then I attempted its restoration.
Et non est restauratum.	And it was not restored.
Detexi ergo super ipsum iterum, et non cessaui incidere os particulatim, et conari restaurationem eius: et non est restauratum, donec incidi ex osse circiter palmum unum, et extraxi illud cum medulla sua.	I detected therefore above it again, and I did not cease to cut into the bone bit by bit, and to try its restoration: and it was not restored, until I cut out about a palm's width from the bone, and extracted it with its marrow.
Deinde restauraui ipsum cum medicinis, et consolidatum est uelociter, et sanatum: et non fuit necessaria haec iteratio in operatione eius, et sectione ipsius, nisi propter dispositionem debilitatis infirmi, et paucitatem tolerantiae eius, et timorem meum super ipsum de morte: quoniam accidebat ei in omnibus horis ex superfluitate euacuationis syncopis mala.	Then I restored it with medicines, and it consolidated quickly, and healed: and this iteration was not necessary in its operation, and section, except because of the disposition of debility and infirmity, and the paucity of its tolerance, and my fear concerning death: for it happened to him at all hours from an excess of bad evacuation syncopes.
Sanatus est ergo sanatione integra: et nata est in loco ossis caro dura, et bona facta est dispositio in corpore suo, et rediit uirtus eius: et conuersatus est in dispositionibus suis: et non fecit ei contrarietatem in ambulatione nocumentum omnino.	He was therefore completely healed: and flesh grew in the place of the hard bone, and a good disposition was made in his body, and his strength returned: and he was converted into his own dispositions: and he did not experience any opposition in his walking, with no harm at all.
Si autem os eminens in loco corporis iam fractum est: tunc oportet ut serres ipsum, secundum hunc modum: et est: ut accipias ligamentum, et stringe ipsum in extremitate ossis eminentis: et praecipe alicui, qui extendat ipsum ad sursum: et pone ligamentum aliud ex lana grossius ligamento primo.	If the protruding bone in the body is already fractured, then it is necessary to treat it in this way: take a bandage and tie it around the extremity of the protruding bone; and attach something that extends it upwards; and apply another bandage made from thick wool on top of the first one.
Deinde liga ipsum super carne, quae est suh osse: et extende extremitatem eius, ut trahas carnem ad inferiora: et tu detegis carnem super locum quem uis serrare, ut non laedat Serra carnem.	Then tie it above the flesh that is on top of the bone; and extend its extremity so that you draw the flesh downwards; and you should detect the flesh above the place where you want to make an incision, so that the incision does not harm the flesh.
Pone lignum, aut tabulam sub osse inferius decenter: quoniam quando facis illud, non prohibetur quin secet carnem corruptam.	Put a splint or a plate underneath the bone below, because when you do that, it is not prevented from cutting into the rotten flesh.
Et oportet ut sit Serratura super locum corruptum parumper, ut non sit in concauitate ossis corruptio: et non appareat in apparitione sua sensui, et cogat ad Serraturam sui uice alia.	And it is necessary that the incision be above the rotten place for a short time, so that the rottenness of the bone does not collect; and it does not appear in its appearance to the sense, and it directs itself towards the incision instead of another.
Quod si os est corruptum, et non est eminens, imo continuatur pars eius cum parte: et corruptio est in medio eius, aut in parte ipsius: tunc detege carnem ab omnibus partibus totam.	If the bone is rotten and does not protrude, but rather continues with its part; and the rottenness is in the middle of it, or in a part of it: then remove the flesh from all parts entirely.
Deinde pone lignum inferius.	Then put a splint underneath.
Postea serra illud ex parte prima, ubi est corruptio, donec continuetur Serratura ex parte altera: et sit Serratura secundum longitudinem a corruptione parumper, secundum quod diximus.	Afterwards, make an incision from the first part, where the rottenness is, until the incision continues from the other part; and let the incision be according to the length of the rottenness for a short time, as we have said.
Quod si corruptio est in iunctura, incide ipsam iuncturam corruptam, et serra os ubi continuatur ex parte altera.	If the rottenness is in the joint, cut into the rotten joint itself, and make an incision in the bone where it continues from the other part.
Si uero corruptio est in continuatione duarum iuncturarum, tunc non est in ea ingenium nisi abrasio.	If indeed the rottenness is in the connection of two joints, then there is no ingenuity in it except scraping away.
Quod si corruptio est in pectine manus, aut in pectine pedis: tunc res in eo est difficilis ualde.	If indeed the rottenness is in the comb of the hand or in the comb of the foot, then the matter in it is very difficult indeed.
Verum oportet, ut inquiras corruptionem qualiter appareat tibi.	It is necessary, therefore, to investigate the rottenness as it appears to you.
Et abradas eam, et mundes ipsam secundum quamcunque dispositionem tibi possibile est, et cum quocunque ingenio rectificatur tibi: quando non facit tibi contrarietatem Vena, aut Neruus.	And you should anoint it, and dress it according to whatever possible arrangement is for you, and with whatever skill is rightly directed towards you: when it does not cause opposition from the Vein or Nerve.
Et scias quod incisoria, et Serrae ad incidendum ista ossa sunt multa, secundum situm ossium, et praparationem eorum, et ipsorum grossitudinem, et subtilitatem eorum, et magnitudinem, et paruitatem ipsorum, et duriciem ipsorum, et eorum raritatem.	And you should know that incisions and saws for cutting through these bones are many, according to the position of the bones, and their preparation, and their thickness, and their subtlety, and their size, and their smallness, and their hardness, and their rarity.
Quapropter oportet, ut praepares omni speciei operationis instrumentum conueniens ad illam operationem.	Therefore it is necessary that you prepare an instrument of every species suitable for that operation.
Et scias, quod operationes istae significant tibi super speciem instrumenti quo indiges, quando tecum est studium longum.	And you should know that these operations depend on the type of instrument which you need, when you have a prolonged study with it.
Et cognitio modorum huius artis, testimonium modorum aegritudinum: tunc enim iam inuenies per teipsum illud quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis ad omnem infirmitatem.	And knowledge of the methods of this art is a testimony to the methods of health; for then you will already have discovered through yourself what is suitable for it from instruments for every disability.
Et ego sum firmans tibi in ultimo huius capituli numerum instrumentorum, quae pones exempla super quae incides, et probationem qua experiaris super alia.	And I will set out for you at the end of this chapter a list of instruments, which I shall give as examples on which you will cut, and a trial which you will experience with others.
Forma Serrae.	The shape of a saw.
Forma alterius Serrae.	The shape of another saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	The shape of a different saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	The shape of another different saw.
Haec forma Serrae depicta, sit decenter facta.	This shape of the saw depicted is not correctly made.
Fiat arcus eius superior, acuitas eius ex ferro: et manubrium eius ex buxo, et sit pyramidale decenter factum.	Let its upper curve be sharpened from iron, and its handle be of boxwood, and let it be made with a pyramidal shape correctly.
Forma Rasorii iuncturarum.	The shape of a razor for joints.
Sit caput huius Rasorii, secundum formam capitis claui stellati: et puncta eius sint secundum formam punctorum elischetfegi.	Let the head of this razor be according to the shape of a star-shaped key: and its points be according to the shape of Elischef's needle-points.
Et non conuenit, nisi ut fricentur cum eo capita iuncturarum, quando corrumpuntur, aut os amplum, et magnum est.	And it is not suitable unless the joints' heads are rubbed with it when they become corrupt, or the bone is large and great.
Forma maioris Rasorii.	The shape of a larger razor.
Forma medii Rasorii.	The form of the medium razor.
Forma Rasorii lati.	The form of the broad razor.
Forma Rasorii in quo est concauitas.	The form of the razor in which there is a concavity.
Forma Rasorii alterius subtilis.	The form of another subtle razor.
Forma Rasorii alterius curuatae extremitatis.	The form of the razor of the curved extremity.
Forma Rasorii parui, subtilis tentae.	The form of the small razor, subtle in its tendons.
Forma Rasorii cum quo inciduntur ossa.	The form of the razor with which bones are divided.
Forma etiam Rasorii magni.	The form also of the large razor.
Hoc similatur Radio, et extremitas est sicut Serra: exhibetur in locis multis ex rasione ossium.	This is similar to a file, and the extremity is like a saw: it is exhibited in many places for the filing of bones.
Forma Rasorii quod conuenit ad rasionem eius quod perforatum est ex ossibus.	The form of the razor that is suitable for filing what has been perforated from bones.
Extremitas eius triangula, acutarum est extremitatum.	Its extremity is triangular, and it is a pointed extremity.
Fit ex Indi.	It comes from India.
Et similiter oportet, ut fiant omnia quae diximus ex Rasoriis, et Incisoriis, et Serris.	And similarly it is necessary that all things which we have mentioned be made from razors, and incisors, and saws.
Â¶ De incisione extremitatum, et Serratura ossium.	On the incision of extremities, and the sawing of bones.
Caput LXXXIX.	Chapter 89.
Putrefiunt extremitates, aut ex caussa extrinseca, aut intrinseca.	The extremities putrefy, either from an external cause or an internal one.
Cum ergo medicatus fueris illam corruptionem curatione medicinarum, et non confert curatio: et uides corruptionem incidere in membrum, quam non repercutit aliquid: tunc oportet ut incidas illud membrum usque ubi consequitu corruptio, ut euadat infirmus per illud a morte, aut a malicia quae est maior defectu membri.	When therefore you have applied medicinal treatment to that corruption and it does not help, and you see the corruption spreading to a member which cannot be repaired: then it is necessary to cut off that member up to where the corruption has reached, so that the weak person may be freed from death or from the greater evil of loss of a member.
Et signum cui accidit illud est, quod denigratur membrum, donec putetur: quod ignis combussit ipsum, aut putrefit post nigredinem: donec inciditur illa putredo usque ad illud quod sequitur illud membrum, et serpit in totum corpus.	And the sign of this is that the member turns black, until it becomes gangrenous: because fire has consumed it, or it has rotted after turning black: until the rottenness is cut away up to where the healthy part of the member follows, and spreads into the whole body.
Propera ergo cum incisione eius, et similiter si caussa corruptionis est a percussione quorundam uenenosorum: sicut scorpionis marini, et uiperae, et rutellae, et similium.	Therefore it is necessary to cut away with an incision, and similarly if the cause of the corruption is from the bite of certain poisonous animals: such as a sea scorpion, and a viper, and a snake, and similar things.
Si ergo corruptio, aut percussio est in extremitate digiti, tunc incide digitum, et non des spacium corruptioni, ut incedat usque ad reliquam manum.	If therefore there is a corruption or bruise on the tip of the finger, then cut into the finger, and do not leave space for the corrupted part to spread, so that it may be cut up to the remaining hand.
Et similiter si accidit in manu, tunc incide eam ex radice focilis, et non des spacium corruptioni, donec capiat in focili brachii.	And similarly if it happens on the hand, then cut into it from the root of the veins, and do not leave space for the corrupted part to spread, until it reaches the forearm.
Et si inuadit in eo, tunc incide brachium apud cubitum in iunctura sua.	And if it has invaded that, then cut into the arm at the elbow joint in its own articulation.
Si autem pertransit corruptio, et uides eum circiter cubitum: tunc in illo est mors infirmi.	If however the corruption has passed beyond and you see it surrounding the elbow: then in that case there is death of the patient.
Et administrare praeter illud ex curatione, est quantitas uirtus.	And to administer beyond that from the treatment, is a matter of great skill.
Et similiter fac de pede, quando inuadit corruptio in digito, tunc incide ipsum apud unum nodorum: et si capit in pectine pedis, tunc incide pedem totum.	And similarly do with the foot, when corruption has invaded a toe, then cut into it at one of its joints; and if it reaches the arch of the foot, then cut off the whole foot.
Si autem ascendit ad genu, tunc incide crus apud iuncturam genu.	If however it ascends to the knee, then cut into the leg at the joint of the knee.
Quod si corruptio iam peruenit supra genu, tunc non est in ea ingenium, nisi dimissio, et relinquere infirmum morti.	What if the corruption has already passed beyond the knee, then there is no ingenuity in it, except to abandon and leave the patient to death.
Et modus incidendi membrum, aut serrandi ipsum est, ut stringas ligamentum in inferiori, quem uis incidere: et stringe ligamentum aliud supra locum.	And the method of cutting a limb or sawing it off is to tighten a ligature below, which you wish to cut: and tighten another ligature above the place.
Et extendat minister ligamentum unum ad inferiora: et extendat minister aliud ligamentum superius ad sursum.	And the assistant extends one ligature downwards to the lower parts: and the assistant extends another ligature upwards to the upper parts.
Et tu separa carnem quae est inter duo ligamenta, cum Spatumili lato, donec detegatur caro tota.	And you separate the flesh that is between the two ligatures, with a broad spatula, until the entire flesh is uncovered.
Deinde incidatur, aut serretur.	Then it should be cut, or sawed through.
Et oportet, ut ponas ab omnibus partibus pannum lini, et non tangat Serra locum sanum: et accidat infirmo laesio addita, et apostema calidum.	And it is fitting to put a linen cloth from all parts, and not touch the saw to the healthy place; and let the patient's wound be added with a warm poultice.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis interius dum operaris, tunc cauteriza locum uelociter: aut pone super ipsum quosdam pulueres abscindentes sanguinem.	If however a flow of blood occurs internally while you are operating, then cauterize the place quickly; or put some powdered substances that stop the bleeding on top of it.
Deinde redi ad medicationem tuam, donec compleatur.	Then return to your treatment, until it is complete.
Deinde liga membrum uulneratum cum ligamento conueniente ei, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then bind the wounded member with a suitable bandage, and take care of it, until it heals.
Et ego narro tibi quod accidit uiro in pede suo, hoc idem accidens quod narro tibi.	And I will tell you what happened to a man with his foot, which is the same thing that I am telling you.
Quod est, quia accidit in pede suo nigredo, cum adustione quae assimilatur combustioni ignis: et corruptio illa in primis accidit in digito suo, donec coepit pedem totum.	What happened was that a blackening occurred on his foot, with a burning that resembled fire combustion: and the corruption first occurred on his toe, until it affected the entire foot.
Properauit ergo uir ex seipso, postquam uidit corruptionem incidere in membro cum uehementia eius, quod inuenit ex dolore, et adustione eius: et incidit ipsum apud iuncturam, et sanatus est.	Therefore the man was freed from himself, after he saw that the corruption was falling upon his limb with its virulence, which he found from the pain and burning: and it happened to him at the joint, and he was healed.
Et postquam praeteriit ei tempus longum, accidit ei illa eadem corruptio in digito manus suae indice.	And after a long time had passed for him, that same corruption happened to him again on the index finger of his hand.
Venit ergo ad me, et conatus sum recuperare illam superfluitatem cum eo quod posui super manum ex medicinis post mundificationem corporis eius: et non repercussa est superfluitas, et coepit incedere in digitum alium: donec coepit coruptio in manum.	He therefore came to me, and I tried to remove that excess with what I applied on his hand from medicines after purifying his body: and the excess did not recede, and began to spread to another finger: until the corruption began in his hand.
Vocauit ergo me, ad incidendum manum eius: et nolui illud, sperans ex me super repercussionem illius superfluitatis: et timui etiam super ipsum apud incisionem manus eius mortem.	He therefore asked me to cut into his hand: and I did not want that, hoping for a recoil of that excess from myself: and I also feared death itself during the cutting of his hand.
Quoniam uirtus uiri erat super casum.	For the man's strength was against the case.
Postquam ergo desperauit de me, reuersus est ad terram suam: et peruenit ad me de eo, quia properauit, et incidit manum suam totam: et sanatus est.	After he therefore despaired of me, he returned to his homeland: and he came back to me about it, because he was freed, and his entire hand was cut open: and he was healed.
Et non attuli hanc narrationem, nisi ut sit adiutorium super illud quod cadit de genere huius aegritudinis: et ut sit significatio qua significetur, et secundum quam agatur.	And I did not relate this story, unless it would be helpful for that which falls under the category of this illness: and as a signification by which it may be signified, and according to what may be done.
Â¶ De cura Sinuum, et qualitate clisterizationis cum medicinis.	On the treatment of wounds, and the quality of cleansing with medicines.
Caput XC.	Chapter 90.
Quando accidit apostema in quibusdam membris carnosis, et prolongatur spacium apostematis, donec collectionem facit saniei: deinde rumpitur, aut perforatur, et egreditur quod in eo est ex sanie, et remanet locus uacuus quasi sit uas: et cutis quae est super ipsum sicut pannus qui iam subtiliatus est: et non peruenit ad ultimum in corruptione sua, neque imprimit in os, neque in neruum, neque in ligamentum: meretur ut nominetur Sinus: et non nominatur Fistula: uerumtamen si prolongatur spacium eius, donec imprimat corruptio in aliquid horum membrorum, tunc nominatur Fistula, aut zuken.	When an abscess forms on certain fleshy members and the space of the abscess becomes prolonged until it collects pus: then it bursts or perforates and what is in it comes out, and a vacant space remains as if it were a vessel: and the skin that is over it is like a pannus that has already been thinned: and it does not come to an end in its corruption, nor does it impress on the bone, nor on the nerve, nor on the ligament: it deserves to be named Sinus: and it is not named Fistula. However, if its space is prolonged until corruption is imprinted on one of these members, then it is named Fistula or zuken.
Et cura eius est, ut incidas illam cutem totam sicut reuoluitur: et praecipue quando subtiliata est, et facta sicut pannus: et confidis quia non aaehaeret cum loco, propter corruptionem suam.	And its treatment is to cut away the entire skin as it revolves: and especially when it has been thinned out and made like a pannus: and you should be confident because it does not adhere to the place on account of its own corruption.
Si autem speras quod adhaereat cutis, et non consequitur ex eo corruptio illa ultima consecutione: et si in cute est spissitudo ex carne, tunc cura ipsum cum Clisteri: et est, ut consideres ad Sinum.	But if you think that the skin adheres and the final corruption does not follow from it as a consequence: and if there is thickness of flesh in the skin, then treat it with suppositories: and it is, so that you may consider it a Sinus.
Tunc si est magnus, et pus quod emittitur ex eo est foetidi odoris: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum medicamine aegyptio, quod est aceti, et olei, et ziniar, partes recipiens aequales, aggregentur in uase: et decoquantur super ignem, donec rubeat medicamen: et ueniat in spissitudinem mellis.	Then if it is large and the pus that is emitted from it has a foul odor: then inject it with an Egyptian medicine, which is made of vinegar, oil, and zinc, taking equal parts, mixed together in a vase: and they are decocted over fire until the medicine becomes red-hot: and it penetrates into the thickness of the honey.
Deinde accipe ex eo quod tibi necesse est: et dissolue ipsum cum aqua et melle, et clisteriza cum eo Sinum: et stringe orificium eius, et dimitte medicinam in eo ad quantitatem duarum horarum.	Then take from it what is necessary for you: and dissolve it with water and honey, and inject it into the Sinus: and close its orifice, and leave the medicine in it for a duration of two hours.
Deinde extrahe ipsum cum expressione: fac illud diebus tot, donec mundificetur Sinus, et remoueatur foetor.	Then extract it with expression: do this daily, until the Sinus is cleansed and the foul odor is removed.
Et quandoque clisterizatur cum aqua cineris, quando non est tibi praesens hoc medicamen: et est, ut accipias cinerem lignorum uitis, aut cinerem ex lignis ilicis: et proiicias super eam aquam.	And when you enema with water of ashes, when this medicine is not present to you: and it is, that you take the ash of burnt wood or the ash of holm oak: and you cast upon the water.
Deinde cola eam, et clisteriza cum ea, donec confidas quod Sinus iam ablutus est.	Then strain it, and enema with it, until you are confident that the sinus is now cleaned out.
Quod si infirmo non est tolerantia super medicamen aegyptium, neque aquam cineris, tunc clisteriza ipsum cum aqua et melle, cui iam permixtum est aliquid ex ziniar contrito.	What if the patient is not tolerating the Egyptian medicine, nor the water of ashes, then enema him with water and honey, which has already been mixed with something from crushed zuinar.
Aut clisteriza ipsum cum melle et uino permixtis, quoniam de proprietate mellis est, ut mundificet, et abluat: et uinum facit adhaerere Sinum, praecipue quando in uino est superfluitas stipticitatis et siccitatis.	Or enema him with honey and wine mixed together, since it is a property of honey to clean and cleanse; and the wine makes the sinus adhere, especially when there is an excess of dryness and roughness in the wine.
Cum facis illud aliquotiens, et confidis quod Sinus corruptio iam remota est: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum eo quod facit nasci carnem in eo.	When you do that several times, and are confident that the corruption of the sinus is now removed: then enema him with what causes flesh to grow in it.
Et est, ut accipias ex emplastro dyafinicon: et dissoluas ipsum cum oleo rosato, et uino stiptico: aut clisteriza ipsum cum quibusdam medicinis, et unguentis aliis, quorum proprietates scripsi in tractatu unguentorum.	And it is, that you take from the emplaster dyafinicon; and dissolve it with rose oil and stringent wine: or enema him with certain medicines and other ointments, whose properties I wrote about in the treatise on ointments.
Quod si orificium Sinus est strictum, in quo non capit cannula clisteris: tunc amplifica ipsum cum ferro parumper: aut pone in ipso licinium inuolutum in unguento aegyptio, aut in unguento basilicon, donec amplificetur.	What if the orifice of the sinus is constricted, in which case the cannula for enema does not fit: then dilate it with an iron instrument for a short time; or put in the same licinium wrapped in Egyptian ointment, or in basilicon ointment, until it is dilated.
Et similiter si est orificium etiam amplum, tunc aggrega labia eius cum sutura: et dimitte ex eo quantitatem in quam ingrediatur clistere sine additione.	And similarly if the orifice is also wide, then bring together its lips with a suture: and let out from it an amount by which it can be entered with an enema without addition.
Et similiter si orificium eius ex quo currit pus, est eleuatum ad superiora: tunc seca ipsum in depressiori loco qui est in ipso, ut currat ex eo pus usque inferius: quoniam pus quando coartatur in profunditate Sinus, prohibet carnem generari in eo.	And similarly if the orifice from which pus flows is elevated to the upper parts: then dry it in a depressed place that is in it, so that the pus flows out of it downwards: for when pus is confined in the depth of the sinus, it prevents flesh from being generated in it.
Quod si non est tibi possibile secare Sinum circiter inferius eius secundum quod uis: tunc conare, ut praepares membrum praeparatione qua currat ex eo pus cum facilitate secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	What if it is not possible for you to cut the sinus around its lower part according to your wish? Then try, so that you prepare the limb with a preparation by which it flows out easily, as it is prepared for you.
Conare, ut non retineatur in eo aliquid ex pus omnino: et accipe medicinas consolidatiuas quae ponuntur super signum, conuenientes ad illud quod uis.	Try, so that nothing of the pus is retained in it at all; and take consolidating medicines which are applied to the wound, suitable for what you wish.
Et extende eas super pannum lini.	And spread them out on a linen cloth.
Et sit pannus tantae quantitatis, qua fiat communicatio totius Sinus.	And let the cloth be of such a quantity that it makes contact with the entire sinus.
Deinde incide cum forficibus in directo orificii Sinus foramen, amplius orificio Sinus parumper.	Then cut with forceps directly into the opening of the sinus's hole, rather larger than the opening of the sinus itself.
Deinde extende ex unguentis lenibus super pannum alium, secundum quantitatem foraminis: et pone eum super ipsum positione longinqua ab orificio Sinus, ut alleuietur exitus pus ex eo: et non auferas pannum magnum, nisi post dies aliquos uice una.	Then spread out a gentle ointment on another cloth, according to the size of the hole; and place it over the wound at a distance from the opening of the sinus, so that the pus may flow out of it: and do not remove the large cloth, unless after several days or one week.
Ille autem qui est super orificium Sinus, est ille quem remoues in omni hora, ut egrediatur quod aggregatur in eo ex pus: et ut scias, an illud quod currit ex eo uirus, est multum, aut parum: aut digestum, aut indigestum.	That one which is over the opening of the sinus is the one that you remove every hour, so that what accumulates in it from pus may flow out; and so you may know whether what flows out of it is a lot or a little, or digested or undigested.
Et cum hoc iterum considera locum Sinus ipsius, an in ipso sentiat dominus eius dolorem, aut non sit in eo dolor, et an sit in eo apostema, aut non sit in eo apostema.	And when you do this repeatedly, consider the site of the sinus itself, whether the master of it feels pain in it, or if there is no pain in it, and whether there is an abscess in it, or if there is not an abscess in it.
Cum ergo protenditur medicatio tua taliter, et uides materiam quae egreditur super orificium Sinus, tunc scias, quod Sinus iam adhaeret, aut approximat adhaerentiae: tunc ergo solue ipsum in mane, aut in tertio die: et quando soluis uulnus, tunc permuta pannum alium, et renoua unguentum.	When therefore your medication is extended in this way, and you see the material that flows out over the opening of the sinus, then know that the sinus has already adhered, or is close to adhering: then therefore dissolve it in the morning, or on the third day: and when you dissolve the wound, then change the cloth for another, and renew the ointment.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post spacium longum uirus subtile, tunc non desperes de adhaerentia eius, nam sanatio eius appropinquat, quoniam ex hominibus sunt qui tardant generationem carnis in uulneribus suis, et ex eis sunt qui agunt econtrario illius.	But if a subtle, watery discharge flows out of the sinus after a long time, then do not despair of its adhering, for its healing is approaching, since there are people who slow down the generation of flesh in their wounds, and among them are those who act contrary to that.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post dies multos pus indigestum, tunc scias quod sinus non adhaeret.	If, however, a pus that does not digest exits from the wound after many days, then you should know that the wound does not adhere.
Si ergo tardatur adhaerentia Sinus, et prolongatur res eius: tunc adde in exiccatione medicinarum, uerum faciant medici, ut sint medicinae in substantia sua humidae, et in uirtute sua siccae: sicut unguentum dyafinicon, quando additur in eo superfluitas additionis ex zegi.	If therefore the adhesion of the wound is delayed and its healing process is prolonged, then you should add medicinal drying treatments, which truly skilled physicians do, so that the medicines are in their substantial humidity and virtue, dry as is the dyaphinion ointment when an excess of additions from zegi is added to it.
Et ex magis ultimo quo curatur, est, ut accipias unguentum dyafinicon, et soluatur cum oleo rosato, et roretur super ipsum uinum antiquum aequale in substantia sua.	And from the most ultimate treatment that is done, it is to receive the dyaphinion ointment and dissolve it with rose oil, and then return it to the old equal wine in its substantial form.
Deinde confice ipsum cum eo, et utere ipso.	Then mix it with that, and use it thusly.
Et iam facit simile huic actioni, quando non est tibi praesens unguentum dyafinicon, mel, quando decoquis ipsum, donec ingrossetur, et uteris eo.	And now make it similar to this action, when you do not have the dyaphinion ointment present, or when you decoct it, until it thickens, and use it.
Aut accipe myrrham, et aloen, et olibanum: tere totum, et pulueriza illud super mel dum est super ignem.	Or take myrrh, and aloe, and galbanum: grind all of it, and powder it over the honey while it is over the flame.
Deinde line super ipsum pannum, et stringe ipsum super Sinum: et line cum melle quod decoquisti, donec ingrossatum est: et pulueriza super ipsum species, et pone super ipsum pannum, et stringe eum.	Then spread it over the linen cloth, and apply it to the wound: and mix with the honey that you decocted, until it thickens: and powder over it the spices, and put on the linen cloth, and apply it.
Et quandoque administratur in illo aristolochia longa, et radices lilii coelestis, et est lilium: et farina herbi, et centaurea.	And when it is administered with aristolochia longa, and roots of heavenly lily, and it is lily: and flour of herb, and centaury.
Utere eis simplicibus, aut aggregatis, tere ea, et cribella ipsa: et pulueriza super mel quod narraui, et utere eo.	Use them as simples, or aggregated, grind them, and sieve them: and powder over the honey that I narrated, and use it.
Quod si prolongatur res Sinus, et non sanatur hac curatione: tunc scias, quod in profundo eius est corruptio: aut iam facit impressionem in ossibus, aut in reliquis membris duris, aut ligamentis: tunc cura ipsum curatione Fistularum, secundum quod praemissum est.	What if the wound's healing process is prolonged and it does not heal with this treatment: then you should know that there is corruption deep within it: or now it makes an impression in the bones, or in the hard remaining parts, or in the ligaments: then treat it with fistula treatments, according to what has been prescribed.
Â¶ De cura Panaritii et unguis attritae, et incisione digiti additi, et sectione.	About the treatment of gout and worn-out nails, and the cutting of the additional finger, and the severing.
Caput XCI.	Chapter 91.
Panaritium est apostema quod nascitur sub ungue pollicis manus, aut pedis: et fortasse nascitur in reliquis digitis.	A panaritium is an abscess that grows under the nail of the thumb of the hand or foot, and perhaps it grows on the other fingers.
Cum ergo prolongatur res eius, et negligitur curato eius, et apostematur apostemate calido: aut corrumpitur, et emittit pus, donec corrodit radicem unguis: et fortasse corrumpit eam totam, et fortasse peruenit corruptio ad os, donec est ei odor foetidus: et fit extremitas digiti lata, et fit color eius fuscus.	When therefore its matter is prolonged and neglected in its treatment, and it becomes an abscess with a hot apostema, or it suppurates and discharges pus until it corrodes the root of the nail; and perhaps it corrupts the whole of it, and perhaps the corruption reaches to the bone, until there is a foul smell from it; and the extremity of the finger becomes thick, and its color becomes dark.
Quando ergo tu curas ipsum, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut incidas cum ferro totam superfluitatem quae remansit ex ungue.	When therefore you treat it, with what we said previously in the division, and your treatment does not help: then it is necessary to cut away with an iron all the excess that remains above the nail.
Deinde cauteriza uulnus post illud.	Then cauterize the wound afterwards.
Cauterium enim iuuatiuum est ualde.	For cauterization is a very helpful remedy indeed.
Si uero os est sanum, et est unguis etiam sana, et additiones uacuae unguis iam comprimunt carnem ad interiora, et incipiunt pungere ipsam, et laedunt eam: tunc oportet ut ponas Radium subtilem sub angulo unguis quae pungit carnem, et impelle eam sursum: et incide eam carnem cum facilitate, et pone super illud quod remanet de carne ex medicinis comburentibus, corrosiuis, donec remoueatur totum eius.	If indeed the bone is healthy, and the nail is also healthy, and the additional empty nails now press on the flesh inside, and begin to sting it, and hurt it: then it is necessary to place a subtle Radius under the angle of the nail that stings the flesh, and push it upwards: and cut away the flesh with ease, and put on what remains of the flesh from burning remedies, corrosive, until everything is removed.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointments, until it is healed.
Si autem corruptio iam imprimit in os, tunc oportet ut incidas illud os, et extrahas ipsum: non enim sanatur unquam dum permanet in eo os corruptum.	If however the corruption has already spread into the bone, then it is necessary to cut away that bone, and extract it: for it will never be healed as long as the corrupted bone remains.
Quod si uides corrosionem et corruptionem incedere in digitum, tunc incide eum in uno nodorum, secundum quod praemissa est eius rememoratio.	If you see corrosion and corruption advancing into the finger, then cut it off at one of the joints, according to what has been previously mentioned about its removal.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it, until it is healed.
Si autem accidat ungui attritio, aut percussio: et contingit in ea dolor uehemens, tunc oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	But if an attack of inflammation or contusion occurs, and there is excessive pain in it, then it is necessary to bleed the patient at the beginning with a phlebotomy.
Deinde seca unguem cum Spatumili acuto sectione transuersa de sursum ad uisum.	Then dry the nail with a sharp, transverse incision from above downwards.
Et custodi, ne sectio perueniat ad carnem quae est sub ungue, nam tu facies accidere per illud super infirmum dolorem uehementem, et erit caussa ad natiuitatem carnis additae in loco.	And be careful, lest the incision reaches the flesh that is under the nail, for you will cause to happen through that a vehement pain to the patient, and it will be a cause of inflammation added to the location.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod sedat dolores.	Then treat the place with what soothes the pains.
Digitus uero additus qui nascitur in quibusdam manibus hominum, fortasse est carnosus totus: et fortasse sunt in quibusdam eorum ossa, et fortasse est in eo unguis: et quidam eorum nascitur in radice iuncturae, aut est natiuitas eius in quibusdam nodis digiti.	A supernumerary finger which is born on some people's hands is entirely fleshy: and perhaps there are bones in some of them, and perhaps there is a nail in it: and some of them are born at the root of the joint, or its birth is in certain nodes of the finger.
Ille ergo qui nascitur in quibusdam nodis digiti, non mouetur: et ille qui nascitur apud iuncturam digiti, fortasse mouetur.	Therefore, one that is born at certain nodes of the finger does not move: and one that is born at the joint of the finger perhaps moves.
Eius ergo qui ex eis est carnosus, sectio eius facilis est.	Therefore, one that consists of flesh from these, its section is easy.
Quod est, ut incidas ipsum apud radicem suam cum Spatumili lato.	Which is to cut it off at its root with a broad scalpel.
Eius autem cuius natiuitas est in radice iuncturae curatio, est difficilis.	But one whose birth is at the root of the joint, its treatment is difficult.
Abstine ergo ab incisione eius.	Therefore, refrain from cutting it.
In illo uero qui nascitur in digito apud ultimum nodorum, tunc oportet ut incidas in primis carnem eius incisione rotunda usque ad os.	In one that is born on the finger at the last node, then it is necessary to cut the flesh first with a rounded incision up to the bone.
Deinde serra os cum una illarum Serrarum conuenientium ad illud.	Then saw the bone with one of those suitable saws for that purpose.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it, until it is healed.
Consolidatio autem quae accidit digitis adinuicem, multotiens accidit aut ex natiuitate hominis, id est, nascitur cum eo, aut a consolidatione uulneris, aut combustione ignis, et similibus.	But the consolidation that occurs to an additional finger, often occurs either from the birth of a man, that is, born with it, or from the consolidation of a wound, or burning by fire, and similar things.
Oportet ergo ut seces illam consolidationem, donec redeant digiti secundum formam suam naturalem.	It is necessary, therefore, to cut that consolidation, so that the fingers return to their natural shape.
Deinde pone inter eos licinia, aut pannos infusos in oleo rosato: ut non consolidentur uelociter, et separa inter eos: aut pone inter eos laminam plumbi subtilem, donec consolidetur locus secundum quod oportet.	Then place between them a layer of linen or cloth soaked in rose oil, so that they do not consolidate too quickly and separate from each other; or place between them a thin sheet of lead, until the location is consolidated as it should be.
Et similiter si accidat consolidatio quibusdam digitis cum palma, tunc seca illam consolidationem, secundum quod praeparatur et conuenit figurae membri.	And similarly, if a consolidation occurs on some fingers with the palm, then cut that consolidation, according to what is prepared and suits the shape of the limb.
Â¶ De incisione Vitium.	On the Incision of Veins.
Caput XCII.	Chapter 92.
Uites sunt Venae inuolutae, grossae, plenae superfluitatibus melancholicis quae accidunt in pluribus membris corporis: et plurimum euentus earum est in cruribus, praecipue in cruribus iter agentium et laborantium, et portantium.	Veins are twisted, thick, full of superfluous melancholic fluids that occur in many parts of the body; and their most frequent event is in the legs, especially in the legs of those who walk and labour and carry weights.
Oportet ergo ut administres excussionem corporis ex cholera nigra aliquotiens excussione forti.	It is necessary, therefore, to administer a strong evacuation of the body from black bile by frequently repeated evacuations with a strong excitement.
Deinde phlebotoma patientis eas basilicam.	Then perform a bloodletting on the patient in the basilica vein.
Curatio uero earum cum ferro, est secundum duos modos.	The treatment of these indeed with iron is according to two methods.
Vnus eorum est, ut secentur, et extrahatur sanguis niger.	One of them is that they are cauterized and black blood is extracted.
Et modus alter est, ut eleuetur Vena, et extrahatur tota.	And the other method is that the vein is opened and everything is extracted.
Sectio uero eius est secundum hunc modum.	The section of it indeed is according to this method.
Embroca crus in primis cum aqua calida multum, donec resoluatur sanguis grossus faeculentus.	Bathe the leg first with hot water many times, until the thick, filthy blood is dissolved.
Deinde stringe crus infirmi a superiori parte coxae eius, usque ad inferiorem partem genu cum uitta.	Then bind the weak leg from the upper part of its hip to the lower part of the knee with a bandage.
Deinde seca uenam in loco uno, aut duobus, aut tribus sectione ampla.	Then cut the vein in one place, or two, or three sections widely apart.
Deinde eleua, id est, extrahe sanguinem in manu tua ab inferiori parte cruris, usque ad sursum, et a superiori oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	Then elevate, that is, extract the blood with your hand from the lower part of the leg upwards, and it is necessary to perform bloodletting on the weak one first.
Deinde seca unguem cum usque inferius: donec egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uides sufficere, et quam tolerat uirtus infirmi.	Then dry the nail with a bandage as far down as possible, until it draws out from the blood as much as you think is sufficient, and as much as the strength of the weak part can tolerate.
Postea liga eam: et praecipe ei, ut abstineat a cibis generantibus choleram nigram: et itera euacuationem et phlebotomiam, quando implentur Venae, et nocet illud infirmo.	Then bind it with a ligature: and instruct him to abstain from foods that generate black bile; and to repeat the evacuation and bloodletting, when the veins are full, and not to harm the weak part.
Eleuatio autem eius est secundum hunc modum.	The evacuation of it is according to this method.
Rade crus infirmi, si in ea sunt pili multi.	Scrape the affected area, if there are many hairs in it.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in balneum: aut embroca ipsum in crure eius cum aqua calida, donec rubeat, et exuberentur Venae: aut exercitetur exercitio forti, si non est ei praesens balneum, donec calefiat membrum.	Then put him into a bath: or immerse his limb in warm water, until it becomes red and the veins overflow: or exercise strong exertion, if he does not have access to a bath, until the member becomes hot.
Deinde seca cutem in directo uenae sectione per longitudinem: aut in ultimo eius apud genu, aut in inferiori parte eius apud calcaneum.	Then dry the skin along the direction of the vein's section by its length: or at the end of it near the knee, or in its lower part near the heel.
Deinde aperi cutem cum uncinis, et excoria uenam ab omni parte, donec appareat sensui: et est apud apparitionem eius, quod uides eam rubeam ad nigredinem decliuem.	Then open the skin with hooks, and clear the vein from every side, until it becomes visible to the sense: and at its appearance, you will see it turn from redness to blackness.
Cum ergo uadit ex cute, uides eam albam quasi sit chorda.	When therefore it emerges from the skin, you will see it white as if it were a cord.
Deinde intromitte sub ea Radium, donec quando eleuatur et egreditur de cute: suspende eam cum uncino caeco, leni.	Then insert the scalpel beneath it, until when it is lifted and emerges from the skin: suspend it with a blunt hook, gently.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam prope illam sectionem tribus digitis.	Then dry another section near that section by three fingers' width.
Deinde excoria cutem a superiori parte uenae, donec appareat.	Then clear the skin from the upper part of the vein, until it becomes visible.
Deinde eleua eam cum Radiis sicut fecisti, et suspende eam cum uncino alio, sicut fecisti in primis.	Then lift it with a scalpel as you did before, and suspend it with another hook, as you did at first.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam, aut sectiones plures, si indiges illo.	Then dry another section, or multiple sections, if it is necessary for that.
Deinde eleua, et incide ipsam ultima sectione apud calcaneum.	Then lift, and incise the same at the last section near the heel.
Deinde extrahe eam ad sectionem quae est supra eam.	Then extract it to the section which is above it.
Et fac illud, donec extrahas eam ex sectione quae est superior, uel altior sectionibus omnibus, donec quando egreditur tota: tunc incide eam.	And do that, until you extract it from the superior section, or any other sections, until when it is totally removed: then incise it.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad extrahendum, et eleuandum: tunc intromitte acum cum filo forti duplo, et liga eam, et extrahe ipsam: aut intromitte sub ea Radium: et reuolue manum tuam ad omnem partem, donec egrediatur.	If it does not obey you to extract and elevate, then insert a strong double thread, and tie it, and extract it; or insert under the radius; and revolve your hand to every part, until it is removed.
Et caue, ne incidatur.	And be careful, lest it be cut.
Nam si incidatur, fit difficile tibi eleuare eam ualde, et ingreditur super infirmum ex ea nocumentum.	For if it is cut, it will be difficult for you to elevate it strongly, and it will become inflamed above the weak spot from that injury.
Cum ergo extraxeris eam totam: tunc pone super locum uulnerum lanam submersam in uino et oleo rosato, aut oleo: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	When you have removed it entirely: then put on the wounded place a submerged linen cloth soaked in wine and rose oil, or oil; and take care of it, until it is healed.
Quod si Vitis est contracta, habens tortuositatem cui sit inuolutio ad partes, et non est sicut diximus secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut findas super eam ad omnem partem tortuositatis eius, et loca inuolutionis ipsius.	If the vein is contracted, having a twisting to its parts, and it is not as we said according to straightness: then it is necessary to find it above its entire twisting part, and the place of its involution.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncinis, donec eleues eam totam: et caue apud sectionem tuam super eam ne incidas uenam, aut uulneres: nam difficile fiet super te eleuare, uel extrahere eam.	Then suspend it with hooks, until you elevate it entirely: and beware at your section above it lest you cut a vein, or wound; for it will be difficult to elevate or extract it.
Conserua ergo prudentiam tuam.	Therefore preserve your prudence.
Forma Incidentis quo sanatur Vitis.	The method of treating a wounded vein so that it heals.
Forma Vncini caeci.	The method of hooks for removing.
Non est ei curuitas sicut reliquis Vncinis, neque est acutae extremitatis, ut non uulneret uenam: et est grossae flectuositatis, lenis: quoniam si esset subtilis, incideret uenam subtilitate sua: imo sit ei superflua grossitudo, sicut diximus.	It is not curved like the other hooks, nor is it of acute extremity, so as not to wound a vein: and it is of coarse flexibility, gentle: for if it were subtle, it would cut the vein with its subtlety; indeed, its superfluous coarseness is suitable, as we said.
De extractione Venae cruris.	On the extraction of a vein of the leg.
Caput XCIII.	Chapter 93.
Haec Vena generatur in cruribus in terris calidis, sicut Alizegi, et terra Arabum, et in terris aridis, calidis, paucae teneritatis, id est, in quibus non nascitur herba, neque arbor.	These veins are generated in the thighs in hot and dry lands, such as those of Alizegi, and the land of the Arabs, and in hot and dry lands with little moisture, that is to say, in which neither grass nor trees are born.
Et fortasse generatur in locis aliis corporis praeter crura.	And perhaps they are generated in other places of the body besides the thighs.
Et generatio quidem eius est a putrefactione quae accidit sub cute, sicut accidunt intra corpora serpentes et uermes ascarides, et uermes generati inter cutem et carnem.	And the generation of it is from putrefaction that occurs beneath the skin, just as it happens within the bodies of snakes and worms, ascari, and worms generated between the skin and flesh.
Et signum incaeptionis euentus huius Venae est, quod accidit in crure inflammatio uehemens.	And a sign of the inception of this vein is that which occurs in the thigh as an intense inflammation.
Deinde uesicatur locus.	Then the place is ulcerated.
Deinde incipit Vena exire ex loco illius uesicationis, quasi sit radix plantae, aut animal.	Then a vein begins to emerge from that place of ulceration, as if it were the root of a plant or an animal.
Cum ergo apparet ex ea extremitas eius, tunc oportet ut inuoluas super ipsam frustum plumbi, cuius pondus sit ex drachma keil, usque ad drachmas II et noda ipsam: et dimitte plumbum suspensum ex crure.	When therefore the extremity of it appears from it, then it is necessary to apply a poultice made with a piece of lead, whose weight is one drachm and a half, up to two drachms, and to bind it suspended from the thigh.
Quotiens ergo egreditur ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, inuolue illud in plumbo, et noda illud.	Whenever therefore something emerges from it to the outside, apply that to the lead and bind it.
Quod si prolongatur multum, tunc incide partem eius, et inuolue residuum.	If it is prolonged much, then cut off a part of it, and apply a poultice to the remainder.
Et non incidas eam radicitus antequam egrediatur tota.	And do not cut it at the root until everything has emerged from it.
Quoniam si incidis, contrahitur, et ingreditur in carnem: et facit accidere apostema, et putredinem in loco, et ulcus malum.	For if you cut it, it is constricted, and it grows into the flesh; and it causes an abscess to occur, and putrefaction in the place, and a bad ulcer.
Quapropter oportet, ut suauiter tractetur, et extrahatur paulatim, donec egrediatur ex ultimo sui, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid in corpore: et ex hac quidem Vena egreditur in quibusdam hominibus quod est in longitudine sua quinque palmorum et decem.	Therefore it is necessary to treat it gently and extract it gradually, until it emerges from its very end, and nothing of it remains in the body; and this vein emerges in some people as long as five palms and ten.
Et iam peruenit ad me, quia exiuit uiro ex XX palmis.	And now it has reached me, because I have seen a case where it emerged from twenty palms.
Si autem inciditur tibi in hora medicationis tuae: tunc intromitte radium in foramine eius, et perfora eam foramine longo, cum corpore, donec euacuetur totum quod est in ea ex materia: et administra putrefactionem loci cum medicinis diebus aliquot.	If, however, you make an incision during the time of your medication, then introduce a rod into its opening and perforate it with a long rod, together with the body, until everything that is in it from the material is evacuated: and administer putrefaction of the place with medicines for some days.
Deinde cura ipsum curatione apostematum.	Then treat the same apostema with treatment.
Et haec quidem Vena quandoque habet ramos multos, praecipue quando apparet in iunctura pedis, aut in pede ipso: et accidunt ei orificia multa, et egreditur ex omni orificio ramus.	And indeed this vein has many branches, especially when it appears at the junction of the foot, or in the foot itself: and many orifices are connected to it, and a branch emerges from every orifice.
Cura ergo ipsam, sicut diximus in diuisione, et cum eo quod praemissum est.	Treat it therefore, as we have said in the division, and with what has been previously mentioned.
Â¶ De sectione super Vermes generatos sub cute, et dicitur Aegritudo bouina.	Concerning the excision of worms generated beneath the skin, and it is called Bouine disease.
Caput XCIIII.	Head 93.
Haec Aegritudo nominatur in quadam terra apud nos Aegritudo bouina: propterea, quia multotiens accidit bouibus, et est uermis paruus unus, qui nascitur inter cutem et carnem.	This disease is named Bouine disease in a certain land among us: because it often happens to oxen, and there is a small worm, which is born between the skin and flesh.
Et uadit in corpore toto, ascendendo et descendendo: et ostenditur sensui apud ambulationem eius de membro ad membrum, donec disrumpit ubicumque disrumpit in cute locum, et egreditur.	And it wanders throughout the whole body, ascending and descending: and it shows itself to the sense during its walking from limb to limb, until it bursts out wherever it bursts out on the skin, and emerges.
Et generatio eius est ex putredine quorundam humorum.	And its generation is from the putridity of certain humors.
Sicut accidunt uermes et serpentes, id est, lumbrici, et ascarides in uentre.	As worms and snakes happen, that is, earthworms, and ascarids in the belly.
Et timetur ex malicia eius.	And they are feared because of their evil nature.
Quia quando ipse uadit in corpore, et eleuatur ad caput, et peruenit ad locum: tunc fortasse aperit in eo, et egreditur, et destruit oculum: et accidit illud multotiens.	Because when it wanders in the body and rises to the head, and reaches a place: then perhaps it appears in it, and emerges, and destroys the eye: and this happens many times.
Cum ergo uis curare eum, et extrahere ipsum, tunc non fit illud nisi apud ambulationem eius, et apparitionem ipsius sensui.	Since it is necessary to cure him, and to extract it, then this does not happen unless through its walking and the appearance of his sense.
Oportet ergo, ut stringas quod est supra eum, et quod est sub eo cum ligamento constrictione forti.	It is necessary therefore, to constrict what is above it with a strong ligature, and what is beneath it with a binding.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then dry over it, and extract him.
Quod si profundatur in carne, et non inuenis ipsum: tunc pone super locum cauterium cum igne, donec moriatur.	What if it is deep in the flesh and you do not find it: then put a cauterizing iron on the spot with fire until it dies.
Et maius quod timetur, est corruptio eius, qua corrumpit oculum, sicut diximus.	And the greater fear is its corruption, which corrupts the eye, as we have said.
Si autem uides eum iam peruenisse in capite prope oculum, tunc stringe sub eo supercilium strictura bona.	If you see that it has already arrived at the head near the eye, then tie beneath it a good strong bandage over the eyebrow.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then dry over it, and extract him.
Et oportet ut utatur infirmus mundificatione sui corporis, cum medicinis soluentibus humores putridos malos.	And it is fitting that the weak person should use a cleansing of his body with medications dissolving evil putrid humors.
Et caueat sibi a cibis generantibus putrefactionem.	And let him beware of foods generating putrefaction.
Â¶ De sectione super aegritudinem Nakir.	On the surgical treatment of illness Nakir.
Caput XCV.	Chapter 95.
Haec aegritudo nominatur in terra nostra Nakir: et est dolor qui accidit in quibusdam membris: deinde permutatur de membro ad membrum.	This illness is called Nakir in our land, and it is a pain that occurs in certain members; then it is transferred from member to member.
Et ego quidem iam uidi ipsum, secundum quod narro tibi.	And I have seen it myself, according to what I relate to you.
Vocatus sum ad mulierem infirmam in quibusdam uillis.	I was called to a sick woman in certain villages.
Et detexit brachium suum, et uidi inflationem paruam in uena funis brachii.	And she showed me her arm, and I saw a small swelling in the vein of the arm.
Et postquam remansi hora una, uidi unam inflationem incedere cum focili, sicut incedit uermis, ascendendo ad humerum eius uelocius quam esse potest: ut sit sicut argentum uiuum, quando currit de loco ad locum.	And after I stayed for one hour, I saw a swelling increasing with a fluid, as if it were an ascending worm, going up to her shoulder more quickly than could be; so that it was like living silver, when it ran from place to place.
Recessit ergo dolor ex illo loco, et fixus est in humero.	Then the pain receded from that place, and settled in her shoulder.
Deinde sedi hora una, et cucurrit in reliquum corpus, donec perueniret in brachium aliud.	Then I sat for an hour, and it flowed into the rest of the body, until it reached another arm.
Deinde narrauit mihi, quia reuoluebatur in toto corpore suo, secundum quod uidi.	Then she told me that it was revolving throughout her whole body, according to what I had seen.
Miratus sum ergo de uelocitate permutationis eius de membro ad membrum.	I was amazed therefore at the swiftness of its transfer from member to member.
Et ego quidem ante illud non uideram hanc aegritudinem oculis meis taliter secundum hunc modum.	And I certainly did not see this eye affliction before in my eyes in this manner.
Verumtamen uidi multos, qui inueniunt dolorem permutari de membro ad membrum: et non uidi ipsum oculis, sicut uidi eum in muliere.	However, I have seen many who transfer the pain from limb to limb, and I did not see it in their eyes, as I saw it in a woman.
Et ego non cogito illud esse, nisi quod est propterea, quod mulier fuit ex illis qui sunt ex uillis sicci corporis detectarum uenarum: hinc ergo apparet sensui illa uentositas permutata.	And I do not think that it is anything else, but because the woman was one of those who are exhausted by dryness of the body and depletion of veins; hence it appears to the senses that the windiness is transferred.
Et est necesse, ut non appareant secundum hanc rationem in illis qui sunt deliciosi, et corporibus humidis, occultarum uenarum.	And it is necessary, so that they do not appear according to this reasoning in those who are delicate and have humid bodies, with hidden veins.
Cum ergo uis curationem eius, et sentit patiens illud dolorem: tunc si est apparens tibi oculo, sicut diximus, tunc stringe supra ipsum, et sub ipso uelociter: et seca supra ipsum, donec egrediatur illa uentositas coartata: et cauteriza locum.	When therefore you want to cure it, and the patient feels that pain: then if it appears to your eye as we said, then press upon it swiftly, and above it quickly; and dry above it until that constricted windiness goes out: and cauterize the place.
Si autem non uides ipsum oculis tuis: tunc cura ipsum cum excussione corporis, et cum eo quod expellit uentositates, et carminat eas cum pillulis foetidis, et pillulis de serapino, et similibus.	If you do not see it with your eyes: then treat it with bodily exercise, and with what expels windiness, and purify them with foul-smelling pills, and pills made from serapinum, and similar things.
Â¶ De extractione Sagittarum.	On the Extraction of Arrowheads.
Caput XCVI.	Chapter 46.
Sagittae diuersificantur secundum species suas, et secundum loca in quibus cadunt ex corpore.	Arrowheads are distinguished according to their own kinds and according to the places from which they fall out of the body.
Earum uero diuersitas est: quoniam ex eis sunt quae habent cuspides magnos, et paruos: et concauae, et surdae.	Their diversity is such that some have large points, and small ones; and are concave, and rough.
Et ex eis sunt quae habent tres angulos.	And there are those that have three angles.
Et ex eis quibus sunt linguae.	And there are those that have tongues.
Et ex eis quibus sunt astellae.	And there are those that have little stars.
Illae uero quae sunt secundum membra in quibus cadunt, est secundum duos modos.	Those indeed which are according to the limbs from which they fall, are according to two modes.
Aut enim membra sunt ex membris principalibus concauis, sicut cerebrum, et cor, et epar, et pulmo, et renes, et intestina, et uesica, et eis similia.	Or indeed they are from principal concave members, such as the brain, and heart, and liver, and lung, and kidneys, and intestines, and bladder, and similar ones.
Quando ergo cadit in aliquo horum membrorum, et apparent tibi signa mortis, quae ego narro tibi post, tunc oportet ut deuites extractionem illius sagittae ex eis, nam mors consequitur illum in quo est, in pluribus dispositionibus.	When therefore a wound falls on one of the limbs, and death's signs appear to you, which I will describe to you afterwards, then it is necessary to delay the extraction of that arrow from them, for death follows him in whom it is, in many dispositions.
Et quando non apparent tibi ista signa mala, et sagitta non est absconsa in profunditate membri, tunc extrahe ipsam, et cura uulnus.	And when these bad signs do not appear to you, and the arrow is not hidden deep within the limb, then extract it, and cure the wound.
Ex signis enim cerebri quando cadit in eo sagitta, et penetrat os, et egreditur siphac quod est super cerebrum, est: quoniam accidunt ex illo soda uehemens, et scotomia, et uertigo, et rubedo in oculis, et inflatio, et rubedo linguae, et spasmus, et permixtio intellectus, et uomitus cholerae.	From the signs of the brain when an arrow falls on it and penetrates the bone, and the siphac which is above the brain is: because there occur from that wound hemorrhages, and blindness, and dizziness, and redness in the eyes, and swelling, and redness of the tongue, and spasms, and confusion of intellect, and vomiting of bile.
Et fortasse egreditur sanguis ex naribus, aut auribus.	And perhaps blood flows out from the nostrils or ears.
Et fortasse abscinditur sermo, et destruitur uox.	And perhaps speech is cut off and the voice is destroyed.
Et egreditur ex loco uulneris humiditas alba similis pulti.	And there issues from the place of the wound a white humidity similar to pus.
Et exit ex eo simile aquositati carnis.	And there comes out from it something like a watery dissolution of flesh.
Si ergo apparent tibi ista signa, tunc abstine a curatione, et extrahe sagittam si non egreditur.	If therefore these signs appear to you, then desist from cure, and extract the arrow if it does not come out.
Signa autem sagittae quando cadit in corde, sunt: quod ipsa est prope mammillam sinistram: et sentit cum ea quasi ipsa sit fixa in re dura, non in re uacua.	The signs of an arrow when it falls on the heart are: that it is near the left nipple; and one feels as if it were fixed in a hard thing, not in a soft thing.
Et fortasse sagittae est motus similis motui pulsus: et currit ex uulnere sanguis niger.	And perhaps the arrow makes a motion similar to the pulse's motion; and black blood flows out from the wound.
Et sequitur illud frigus extremitatum, et sudor frigidus, et syncopis.	And there follows that numbness of the extremities, and cold sweat, and fainting.
Scias ergo, quod mors descendit procul dubio.	Know therefore, that death is near without a doubt.
Et signum sagittae quando uulnerat pulmonem, est exitus sanguinis spumosi ex uulnere: et uasa quae sequuntur collum, apostematur, et mutatur color infirmi.	And the sign of an arrow when it wounds the lung is the emission of frothy blood from the wound; and the parts that follow the neck become swollen, and the color of the invalid changes.
Et expirat spiritum magnum, altum: et quaerit attractionem aeris frigidi.	And the large spirit expires, high: and it seeks the attraction of cold air.
Quod si cadat sagitta in uelamen, quod est in pectore: tunc est prope costas paruas: et fit anhelitus magnus cum dolore uehementi, cum suspirio: et mouentur omnia membra humerorum.	If the arrow falls on the flesh that is on the chest, then it is near the small ribs; and there is great anxiety with intense pain, with a sigh; and all the members of the shoulder are moved.
Et si cadat sagitta in stomachum, tunc fortasse egreditur ex uulnere ex cibo aliquid indigestum.	And if the arrow falls on the stomach, then perhaps something undigested will emerge from the wound along with food.
Et si cadit sagitta in Ventrem, et figitur in eo: egreditur aliquid stercoris ex uulnere, aut zirbum, aut intestinum quod iam disruptum est.	And if the arrow falls on the belly and is fixed in it: something filthy emerges from the wound, either feces or a fragment of intestine which is now disrupted.
Non est ergo spes in curatione eius, neque in extractione sagittae.	There is therefore no hope for its cure, nor in the extraction of the arrow.
Quod si sagitta cadat in Vesicam, et egrediatur urina: et procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, et fortior sit dolor super infirmum: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	If the arrow falls on the bladder and urine emerges: and something proceeds from it to the outside, and the pain is more severe over the weak spot: then know that it is mortal.
Reliqua autem membra, sicut facies, et collum, et guttur, et spatula, et adiutorium, et spondiles dorsi, et furcula, et coxa, et crus, et eis similia ex membris saluantur secundum plures dispositiones: quando non inuenit sagitta arteriam, aut neruum: et non est sagitta uenenosa.	The remaining limbs, such as the face, and neck, and throat, and shoulder blade, and upper arm bone, and dorsal vertebrae, and forked part of the collar bone, and hip, and leg, and similar ones are preserved according to many dispositions: when the arrow does not find an artery or nerve: and it is not a poisonous arrow.
Et ego narro tibi quod uidi de esse harum sagittarum, ut significes per illud super curationem tuam.	And I tell you what I saw about the nature of these arrows, so that you may understand it through that regarding your cure.
Quod est, quia cuidam uiro cecidit sagitta in lachrymali oculi eius, in radice nasi.	Because an arrow fell on the tear-producing eye of that man, at the root of his nose.
Extraxi ergo eam ipsi ex parte altera, sub adipe auris eius: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei in oculo eius nocumentum.	I therefore extracted it from the other side, under the fat of his ear: and he was healed, and no harm came to his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam Iudaeo, quae cecidit ei in adipe oculi sui sub palpebra inferiori: et sagitta iam occultata erat, et non consecutus sum ex ea nisi extremitatem paruam eius, cum qua adhaeret in ligno suo: et erat sagitta magna ex sagittis arcuum Turcorum, cum ferro leni, in qua non sunt aures.	And I extracted another arrow from a Jew, which had fallen into the fat of his eye under the lower eyelid: and the arrow was already hidden, and I did not reach it except for its small extremity, with which it adhered to his wooden stick: and it was a large arrow from the arrows of the Turkish bow, with smooth iron, in which there are no notches.
Sanatus est ergo Iudaeus, et non accidit in oculo eius accidens malum.	The Jew was therefore healthy, and no evil accident occurred in his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam ex gutture Christiani.	And I extracted an arrowhead from the throat of a Christian.
Et erat sagitta arabica, et est illa cui sunt aures.	And it was an Arabian arrow, and it belonged to him who had golden earrings.
Secui ergo super ipsam inter duas guidegi: et iam submersa erat in gutture eius.	I sewed up over the same area between two guideways: and already it was submerged in his throat.
Subtiliatus sum ergo cum ea, donec extraxi eam: et sanatus est Christianus.	I was subtle with it, until I extracted it: and the Christian was healed.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam uiro quae ceciderat in uentre eius: et cogitauimus, quia moreretur ex ea.	And I extracted an arrowhead from a man whose belly had been struck by it: and we thought that he would die from it.
Postquam ergo praeterierunt ei triginta dies, et non mutatum est super eum aliquid ex dispositionibus eius, secui super sagittam: et ingeniaui super eam, et extraxi eam: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei accidens malum.	After thirty days had passed for him, and nothing of his conditions had changed, I sewed up over the arrowhead: and I applied my ingenuity to it, and extracted it: and he was healed, and no evil accident occurred to him.
Et uidi uirum cui cecidit sagitta in dorso eius, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam.	And I saw a man whose back had been struck by an arrow, and the wound was consolidated over it.
Postquam ergo fuit post septem annos, exiuit sagitta in radice coxae eius.	After seven years had passed, the arrowhead came out at the root of his hip.
Et uidi mulierem cui cecidit in uentre suo sagitta, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam, et remansit sagitta intra ipsam: et non mutata est ex dispositionibus eius aliqua, et mulier non inuenit ei nocumentum in aliqua ex operationibus suis naturalibus.	And I saw a woman who had been struck by an arrow in her belly, and the wound was consolidated over it, and the arrowhead remained inside: and nothing of her conditions changed, and the woman did not find any harm in any of her natural functions.
Et uidi uirum alium, cui cecidit sagitta in facie sua: et consolidatum est uulnus, et remansit, non inueniens ei multum dolorem: et similia istis multa.	And I saw another man who had been struck by an arrow in his face: and the wound was consolidated, and it remained, causing him no great pain: and there were many similar cases to these.
Et extraxi sagittam uiro ex principibus Regis, quae ceciderat ei in medio nasi sui, et iam declinauerat ad partem dextram parumper: et occultata erat sagitta tota.	And I extracted an arrowhead from a man of the king's retinue, which had struck him in the middle of his nose, and had already declined to the right side for a while: and the whole arrowhead was hidden.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius post casum sagittae usque ad tres dies.	I was therefore called to his treatment after the accident of the arrow up to three days.
Inueni ergo uulnus sagittae strictum ualde.	I found that the wound of the arrow was tightly constricted.
Inquisiui ergo eam cum tenta subtili, et non sensi eam: et ipse quidem inueniebat punctionem et dolorem sub aure sua ex parte dextra.	I examined her with a subtle probe, and I did not feel it; and indeed she herself pointed out the painful spot and the ache under her right armpit.
Speraui ergo, quod erat illa punctio ex extremitate sagittae.	I expected therefore that the wound was from an arrowhead.
Emplastraui ergo locum cum emplastro in quo erat uirtus attractiua, et digestiua, confidens apud me, quod apostemaretur locus, et appareret mihi signum sagittae, ut secarem super eam: et non accidit in loco accidens significans quod sagitta consecuta sit locum.	I applied a plaster to the place with an attractive and digestive plaster, trusting that it would bring out the spot and show me the sign of the arrow, so I could cut around it; but nothing happened at the affected spot, indicating that the arrowhead had not touched the place.
Assiduaui ergo cum emplastro super eum diebus multis: et non accidit accidens, et consolidatum est uulnus interim: et remansit infirmus de extractione eius spacio dierum, donec sensit sagittam die quodam intra nasum suum.	I treated it diligently with a plaster for many days, but nothing happened and the wound consolidated in the meantime; and he remained weak from the extraction of that spot for several days, until he felt the arrowhead on a certain day inside his nose.
Et narrauit mihi illud.	And he told me about it.
Posui ergo super illud uulnus medicinam acutam, corrosiuam diebus multis, donec apertum est: et cum tenta tentaui ipsum, et sensi extremitatem sagittae subtilem quae adhaeret in ligno.	I then applied a sharp, corroding medicine to the wound for many days, until it opened up; and when I probed it, I felt the subtle tip of the arrowhead that was stuck in the wood.
Deinde addidi in apertione uulneris per illam medicinam acutam, donec apparuit nobis uisibiliter extremitas sagittae: et praeteriit mihi cum eo spacium temporis circiter quatuor menses.	Then I added to the opening of the wound through that sharp medicine, until the tip of the arrowhead appeared visibly to us; and it took me about four months with him to complete the treatment.
Deinde postquam amplificatum est uulnus, et possible fuit mihi intromittere forcipes in ipsam, et mouere ipsam, et non obediuit ad exitum: tunc non cessaui subtiliare, et ingeniare super eam cum modis ingeniorum, donec coepi super eam die quodam cum forcipibus decenter factis, secundum quod ueniet forma eorum in fine capituli, donec extraxi eam.	Then after the wound had grown larger, and it was possible for me to insert forceps into it, and move them around, but they did not obey for its removal: then I did not cease from cleverly thinking and contriving over it with various contrivances, until I managed to remove it on a certain day with skillfully made forceps, according to the shape of their tips described at the end of the chapter, so that I extracted it.
Deinde restauraui uulnus.	Then I restored the wound.
Et medici quidem iudicant, quod cartilago nasi non restauratur.	And indeed the physicians judge that the cartilage of the nose is not restored.
Restauraui ergo ipsam, et consolidatum est uulnus, et sanatus est infirmas sanitate integra: nec nocuit ei aliquid omnino.	I then restored it, and the wound was consolidated, and he was completely healed with integral health; nor did anything harm him at all.
Et ego narro tibi qualitatem extractionis quarundam sagittarum: ut ponas illud regulam et significationem super illud quod non dixi.	And I will teach you the method of extracting an arrowhead: so that you may apply a rule and indication on what I did not mention.
Quoniam partes huius artis et distinctiones earum non comprehenduntur cum narratione: neque comprehendit illud liber, et artifex prudens comparat cum pauco super multum: et cum eo quod est paesens, super illud quod est absens: et inuenit operationem nouam, et instrumentum nouum apud descensus rerum extranearum huius artis quando accidunt.	Because the parts of this art and their distinctions are not understood with narration: nor does the book comprehend it, and the skilled artisan compares a little with much: and with what is present, about what is absent: and he discovers a new operation, and a new instrument through the descent into extraordinary things of this art when they occur.
Dico ergo, quod sagittae non egrediuntur ex membris quibus sunt fixae, nisi secundum duos modos.	I say therefore, that arrowheads do not come out from the limbs in which they are fixed, unless according to two methods.
Aut per attractionem ex loco ex quo intrauit.	Or by attraction from the place into which it entered.
Aut contrario partis alterius.	Or by counter-pressure of another part.
Et illa quae egreditur unde intrauit, aut est sagitta procedens in loco carnoso: et attrahitur, et egreditur.	And that which comes out from where it entered, or is a proceeding arrowhead in the fleshy place: and it is attracted, and comes out.
Quod si non obedit ad exitum ex hora in qua cadit: tunc oportet ut dimittas ipsam aliquot diebus, donec putrefiat caro quae est in circumitu eius: et alleuietur attractio eius, et eius egressio.	What if it does not obey at the exit from the hour in which it falls: then it is necessary that you let it alone for some days, until the flesh that is around it putrefies: and its attraction is alleviated, and its egress.
Et similiter si figitur in osse, et non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc dimitte ipsam etiam aliquot diebus: et itera eam cum attractione et motione omni die, donec egreditur.	And similarly if it is fixed in a bone, and does not obey you at the exit, then leave it alone for some days as well: and try it with attraction and motion every day, until it comes out.
Quod si non obedit tibi ad exitum post dies, tunc oportet ut perfores in circumitu sagittae in ipso osse ab omni parte cum terebro subtili, donec amplificentur sagittae.	What if it does not obey you at the exit after days, then it is necessary that you perforate around the arrowhead in the bone on every side with a subtle drill, until the arrowheads are loosened.
Deinde attrahe eam, et extrahe ipsam.	Then attract it, and extract it.
Si autem sagitta est fixa in capitis osse, et iam processit in uno uentrium cerebri, et apparent ex infirmo quaedam illorum accidentium quae dixi: tunc abstine ab attractione sagittae, et dimitte eam, donec aequetur esse eius post dies.	If the arrowhead is fixed in a bone of the head, and has already passed into one ventricle of the brain, and certain accidents that I mentioned appear from the weakness: then refrain from attracting the arrowhead, and leave it alone, until its condition becomes equalized after days.
Nam si sagitta peruenit ad sifach, tunc mors non prolongatur ei.	For if the arrowhead penetrates to the sifaÃ§, then the death is not prolonged for him.
Et si sagitta non est fixa, nisi in corpore ossis tantum, et non penetrat usque ad sifach: et remanet infirmus aliquot diebus, et non accidit ei ex illis accidentibus aliquid: tunc ingenia in attractione sagittae et extractione eius.	And if the arrowhead is not fixed, unless it only lodges in a bony part of the body and does not penetrate up to the sifaÃ§; and he remains weak for several days, and none of those accidents befall him: then his ingenuity is in attracting the arrowhead and extracting it.
Si autem est fixa ualde, et non obedit tibi ad attractionem: tunc administra terebella in circumitu sagittae, sicut narraui tibl: deinde cura locum, donec sanetur.	If, however, it is fixed strongly, and does not obey you in attracting it: then administer the trephine around the arrowhead, as I narrated to you; afterwards treat the place, until it heals.
Si autem Sagitta iam absconsa est in loco corporis, et occultatur et absconditur a sensu: tunc inquire eam cum tenta.	If, however, the arrowhead is already hidden in a place of the body, and it is concealed and hidden from sensation: then probe for it with a tent.
Si autem sentis eam, tunc attrahe eam cum quibusdam instrumentis quae conueniunt attractioni eius.	If, however, you feel it, then attract it with certain instruments that are suitable for its attraction.
Si autem non potes super eam, propter constrictionem uulneris, et propter longitudinem sagittae in profundo: et non est illic os, neque neruus, neque uena: tunc finde super eam, donec amplificetur uulnus, et sit possibile extrahere sagittam.	If, however, you cannot reach it, because of the constriction of the wound, and because of the length of the arrowhead in the depth; and there is no bone, nor nerve, nor vein: then enlarge upon it, until the wound is amplified, and it becomes possible to extract the arrow.
Quod si sunt ei aures quibus teneatur, tunc libera carnem fixam in eis ab omni parte, omni ingenio quo potes illud, et ingenia, si non potest super euasionem carnis in fractura aurium, et contorsione earum, donec euadat.	Since there are anchors by which it is held, then liberate the fixed flesh from them on every side, with all the ingenuity you can, and strive, if you cannot overcome the evasion of the flesh in the fracture of the anchors, and their contortion, until it is freed.
Et tu quando administras extractionem Sagittae, in quocumque loco est, tunc utere contorsione manus tuae, cum forficibus ad partes omnes, donec facias eam euadere: et subtilia ultima subtilitate, ut non frangatur Sagita, et fiat difficilis tibi attractio eius, et ipsius extractio.	And you, when you administer the extraction of the arrowhead, in whatever place it is, then use the contortion of your hand, with forceps on all parts, until you make it come out: and be subtle with utmost subtlety, so that the arrowhead does not break, and its attraction becomes difficult for you, and even its extraction.
Quod si non potes super eam ex hora una, tunc dimitte eam diebus aliquot, donec putrefiant quae sunt in circumitu eius.	Since if you cannot overcome it at one hour, then leave it for several days, until what is around it becomes putrid.
Deinde itera eam: alleuietur enim tuncia Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra quod diximus ex curatione in capitulo suo: et custodi uirtutem tuam ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, aut chordae.	Then you should approach it: for if the outer skin is injured, and if it causes a counter-flux of blood to you, then administer what we have said about treatment in its chapter: and preserve your strength from cutting into the vein, or nerve, or cord.
Et administra ingenium omni modo quo tibi possibile est euasionis Sagittae: et sit illud cum facilitate, et tranquillitate, uel tarditate, et firmitate, sicut narraui tibi.	And administer skill in every way that is possible for you to ease the tension of the bowstring: and let it be with facility, and tranquility, or slowness, and firmness, as I have narrated to you.
Et oportet, ut facias cum trahis Sagittam, ut infirmus sit secundum figuram, secundum quam fuit apud casum Sagittae in ipso.	And it is necessary, that you do as you draw the bowstring, so that it may be weak according to its shape, according to what it was at the time of the case of the bowstring itself.
Quoniam est magis iuuatiuum.	Because it is more beneficial.
Si autem non est tibi possibile illud, tunc administra quod tibi est possibile ex figuris.	If however it is not possible for you, then administer what is possible for you from the figures.
Sagitta autem quae egreditur ex contrario partis alterius, aut iam procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora: aut facit gibbositatem extremitas Sagittae per sensum ex superiore parte cutis propinquae, et uides eam eminentem: seca ergo super eam, et sit sectio secundum quantitatem quod capiant in ea forcipes.	The bowstring which emerges from the opposite part of the other, or already proceeds from it to the exterior: or it makes a swelling of the extremities of the bowstring through sensation from the superior part of the adjacent skin, and you see it prominent: therefore cut above it, and let the section be according to the quantity that the forceps grasp in it.
Deinde attrahe eam: ipsa namque fit facilis ad exitum.	Then draw it out: for it itself becomes easy to remove.
Si uero retinetur in osse, tunc torque manum tuam secundum rotunditatem, donec imprimat Sagitta in osse, et amplificet sibiipsi: deinde trahe ipsam.	If it is retained in the bone, then twist your hand according to the roundness, until the bowstring impresses on the bone, and it itself becomes larger: then draw it out.
Et si non: dimitte eam diebus aliquot: deinde itera eam, donec egrediatur.	And if not: leave it for some days: then approach it again, until it emerges.
Quod si lignum Sagittae est in ea, tunc impelle ipsam cum eo.	What if the wood of the bowstring is in it, then push it out with that.
Si autem cecidit lignum, et uis administrare impulsionem: tunc intromitte ad eam instrumentum concauum, ut ingrediatur concauitas eius in caudam Sagittae: deinde impelle eam cum ipso.	If however the wood has fallen out, and you want to administer an impulse: then introduce into it a concave instrument, so that its concavity enters into the tail of the bowstring: then push it out with the same.
Si autem Sagita est concaua, tunc impelle eam cum instrumento intrante in ipsam.	If the arrow-head is concave, then push it out with an instrument inserted into it.
Sagitta enim alleuiatur per illud.	For the arrow-head is extracted through that.
Quod si Sagitta est toxicata, tunc oportet, ut concaues carnem totam, in qua est uenenum: si est tibi possibile illud.	What if the arrow-head is poisoned, then it is necessary to excavate the entire concave flesh where the poison is: if it is possible for you.
Deinde cura eam cum eo quod conuenit ad illud.	Then treat it with what is suitable for that.
Quod si Sagitta est cadens in pectore, aut in uentre, aut in uesica, aut in latere: et est propinqua ex eo quod tangis cum tenta, et possibile est tibi secare super eam: tunc seca, et caue ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, et extrahe eam.	What if the arrow-head is lodged in the chest, or in the belly, or in the bladder, or in the side: and it is close to what you touch with your finger, and it is possible for you to dissect above it: then dissect, and be careful about the incision of the vein, or nerve, and extract it.
Deinde sue uulnus, si uides, et cura illud, donec sanetur.	Then sew up the wound, if you see fit, and treat it, until it heals.
Et haec est forma Forcipum, quibus extrahuntur Sagittae.	And this is the method of forceps, with which arrow-heads are extracted.
Sint extremitates similes rostro auis, quae factae sunt sicut ferra: quando capiunt super Sagittam, non dimittunt eam.	There are extremities similar to a bird's beak, which are made like scissors: when they grasp onto the arrow-head, they do not release it.
Et fiunt ex eis species multae, magnae, et paruae, et mediae, secundum quantitatem magnitudinis Sagittae, et paruitatis eius, et amplitudinis uulneris, et constrictionis eius.	And they are made into many species, large, small, and medium, according to the quantity of the arrow-head's size, and its smallness, and the width of the wound, and its constrictions.
Forma Impellentis concaui.	The form of a concave pusher.
Et forma Impellentis surdi.	And the form of a straight pusher.
Hoc est surdae extremitatis sicut Radius, ut alleuietur introitus eius in sagittam concauam, et impellatur cum eo.	This is a straight extremity like a rod, so that its point is extracted into the concave arrow-head, and it is pushed with it.

Et phlebotoma eam secundum transuersionem: quoniam os est propinquum: et fortasse in eo frangetur phlebotomus quando est subtilis.	And the scalpels are divided according to the transverse cutting: because the bone is near: and perhaps the scalpel will be broken when it is subtle.
Â¶ De phlebotomia Venarum in duobus Lachrymalibus.	Of the venous scalping in two lacrimal veins.

Â¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Algeberich.	On the Phlebotomy of Veins, by Algeberich.
Venae autem Algeberich phlebotomiae iuuamentum est: quia confert ad alcolam in ore, et corruptionem gingiuae: et ulcera mala: et fissuras labiorum, et ulcera mala, etiam quae sunt in naso, et in circumitu eius.	Algeberich's phlebotomy of veins is a remedy: because it helps against inflammation of the mouth, and corruption of the gums: and evil ulcers: and cracks of the lips, and evil ulcers, even those that are in the nose, and around it.

Then turn back the lip, and look at the two veins: one of which is on the right side of the lip, and the second is on its left; and their demonstration is through the dark bluish color.
Et illud uerum est: quia in circumitu earum sunt uenae minutae, nigrae.	And that is true: because in the vicinity of those are small black veins.
Incide ergo utramque incisione incidente.	Make an incision on both sides, making a cut into each.
Si autem dubitatio est super te, et non scis quae earum est: tunc intende ad incisionem maioris earum, et ipsarum manifestiorem.	If you are in doubt and do not know which of them is, then make an incision on the larger one, and it will be more clearly manifest.
Et similiter fac de duabus uenis quae sunt in labio superiore: et plurimum quidem currit consuetudo cum eo: et incide duas uenas quae sunt in labio inferiori.	And do similarly for the two veins that are in the upper lip, and it is mostly customary to do so with them; and make an incision on the two veins that are in the lower lip.
Â¶ De phlebotomia Venae sub lingua post Cephalicae phlebotomiam.	Concerning the bloodletting of the Vein under the tongue, following the Cephalic bloodletting.
Duarum uero Venarum quae sunt sub lingua phlebotomiae iuuamentum: est, quod phlebotomia Cephalicae est ad praefocationes quae sunt in gutture, et aegritudinem uuulae, et aegritudines oris.	The benefit of the two Veins that are under the tongue in bloodletting is this: because the Cephalic bloodletting is for the purification of the things that are in the throat, and the cleansing of the ulcers, and the cleansing of the mouth.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eas est, ut sedeat infirmus inter manus tuas coram sole: et eleualinguam eius, et aspice sub lingua a latere eius uno uenam, et a latere eius alio uenam: et color utriusque decliuis ad nigredinem.	And the quality of performing bloodletting on them is such that the patient should sit between your hands in front of the sun, and elevate his tongue, and look under the tongue on one side for one vein, and on the other side for another vein: and their color will decline towards blackness.
Phlebotoma ergo utramque: et custodi, ne ultimes manum tuam in phlebotomando eas.	Therefore, perform bloodletting on both: and take care, lest you move your last hand while performing bloodletting on them.
Nam sub eius sunt arteriae, et fortasse accidet fluxus sanguinis ex illis arteriis.	For underneath them are arteries, and perhaps a flow of blood may occur from those arteries.
Â¶ De tribus Venis in cubito.	Concerning the three Veins in the elbow.
Venae autem tres quae phlebotomantur in cubito, sunt in quarum phlebotomia cucurrit consuetudo in omnibus hominibus.	The three Veins that are bloodletted in the elbow are those on which customary bloodletting is practiced in all people.
Et phlebotomia earum fit secundum duos modos.	And the bloodletting of them is done according to two methods.
Aut pungendo cum phlebotomo myrtino lato: aut oliuari ad subtilitatem decliui: aut secando cum phlebotomo cultellari, et est Alnesil.	Either by pricking with a Myrtle-shaped lancet: or by draining to subtlety with an olive-shaped instrument: or by cutting with a scalpel-shaped lancet, and it is called Alnesil.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its shape.
Sic Alnesil est, quod conuenit ad sectionem.	Thus Alnesil is, which is suitable for incision.
Et ex eis sunt species latae, et subtiles secundum amplitudinem uenarum et stricturam earum Forma phlebotomi myrtini sit lata, sicut uides.	And from them are broad and subtle species according to the width of the veins and their structure. The shape of the Myrtle-shaped lancet is broad, as you see.
Et conuenit ad aperiendas uenas concauas, plenas, procedentes, apparentes, grossas, et illas quae continent sanguinem grossum, turbidum.	And it is suitable for opening concave veins, full ones, proceeding ones, apparent ones, thick ones, and those that contain thick, turbulent blood.
Et iste phlebotomus est minoris latitudinis, et subtilioris extreminatis.	And this lancet is of smaller width and more subtle at the extremity.
Et conuenit ad phlebotomiam uenarum subtilium, quae continent sanguinem subtilem citrinum	And it is suitable for bloodletting of subtle veins that contain thin, clear yellow blood.
Â¶ De phlebotomia Basilicae.	On the bloodletting of Basilica.
Basilicae autem quae est una harum trium uenarum phlebotomiae iuuamentum est.	Basilica, however, which is one of these three veins for bloodletting, is a benefit.
Quia extrahit sanguinem ex aegritudinibus, quae sunt sub gutture et collo, ex eo quod sequitur pectus, et uentrem: et conuenit phlebotomatori cum phlebotomat eam, ut caueat, et sit super timorem ex ea nam sub ea est arteria.	Because it extracts blood from the diseases that are beneath the throat and neck, since it follows the chest and stomach; and it is suitable for the bloodletter with this bloodletting, so that he may be cautious, and it is above fear because beneath it is an artery.
Si ergo errat, et addit in punctura phlebotomi, incidet illam arteriam, et accidet fluxus sanguinis.	If therefore he makes a mistake, and adds to the puncture of the bloodletter, he will cut that artery, and there will be a flow of blood.
Quapropter oportet, ne phlebotomet eam cum phlebotomo pungente: imo sit secans cum Alnesil.	Wherefore it is necessary not to bloodlet with a pricking lancet; rather, it should be cutting with an Alnesil.
Quod si non apparet Basilica apparitione manifesta, tunc oportet, ut alienes ipsam, et permuteris ad aliam, aut quaeras aliquem ramum eius: aut phlebotomes loco eius Funem brachii.	Which if it does not appear in a clear and manifest appearance of Basilica, then it is necessary to transfer it elsewhere, and you will change it for another, or you will seek some other branch of it; or instead of the bloodletter, the rope of the arm.
Ipsa enim est manifesta, et seca eam cum phlebotomo Anesil, sicut diximus.	For that is clear, and you will cut it with an Alnesil-shaped lancet, as we have said.
Si autem uis phlebotomiam ipsius eiusdem, tunc oportet ante stricturam brachii, ut tangas locum, donec cognoscas locum pulsus.	If however you wish to perform phlebotomy on that same person, then it is necessary before constricting the arm, so that you may touch the place, until you recognize the place of the pulse.
Deinde signa super locum cum encaustro, postea brachium, et seca uenam sectione concaua cum phlebotomo Alnesil, sicut diximus.	Then mark the place with a cautery, afterwards constrict the arm, and cut the vein at a curved section with a phlebotomy knife of Al-Nezal, as we have described.
Et caue ne cadat percussio per spacium a loco arteriae.	And take care that the percussion does not fall through the space to the place of the artery.
Et quando uides, cum tu stringis ligamen, inflationem in loco quem signasti cum encaustro, tunc illa inflatio est inflatio arteriae: deuita ergo eam.	And when you see that, as you constrict the ligament, an inflammation occurs in the place which you marked with a cautery, then that inflation is an arterial inflation: therefore beware of it.
Quod si uides sanguinem apud phlebotomiam salire, sicut urina pueri, et est sanguis subtilis, rubeus: tunc scias, quia est ex sanguine arteriae.	What if you see the blood at the phlebotomy to be salty, like a child's urine, and it is subtle, red blood: then know that it is from an arterial blood.
Tunc ergo propera, et pone digitum tuum super ipsum spacio longo, deinde aufer digitum tuum.	Then therefore press, and put your finger on the same long space, afterwards raise your finger.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis (multotiens namque abscinditur) tunc stringe brachium, et dimitte ipsum: et caueat infirmus a motione eius: et sit super timorem eius.	If therefore the blood is cut off (for it is often cut off), then constrict the arm, and release it: and beware lest the patient be weakened by its motion: and let it be above his fear.
Et non moueat ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	And do not move it for some days, until it is healed.
Si autem non abscinditur sanguis, et uincit te: et non est tibi praesens in momento tuo medicina, tunc incide arteriam, si apparet tibi.	If however the blood is not cut off, and it overcomes you: and there is no remedy present for you at that moment, then incise the artery, if it appears to you.
Nam extremitates eius contrahuntur, et abscinditur sanguis.	For the extremities are constricted, and the blood is cut off.
Aut accipe corticem fistici, et finde eum: accipe medietatem unam, et stringe eam super locum uenae strictura decenti, cum ligamento et puluillis usque ad diem alium.	Or take a small linen cloth, and bind it: take one half, and constrict it over the place of the vein's constriction, with a ligature and soft padding until another day.
Tunc si abscinditur sanguis, est bonum.	Then if the blood is cut off, it is good.
Et si non: tunc cura ipsum cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio ex loco puluerum abscindentium fluxum sanguinis: et abscisio sanguinis eius non est difficilis in pluribus dispositionibus, propter locum paruum uulneris, et possibilitatem ligamenti ex brachio.	And if not: then treat it with the method that preceded, remembering the place of the dust of the cut off blood flow: and the cutting off of his blood is not difficult in many dispositions, because of the small wound location, and the possibility of a ligature from the arm.
Â¶ De phlebotomia uenae Fuscae.	On the bloodletting of the veins of the forehead.
Venae autem Fuscae phlebotomiae iuuamentum est, quod trahit sanguinem ex superiori parte capitis, et inferiore corporis: propterea, quia est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae, sicut diximus.	The veins of the forehead bloodletting is beneficial, because it draws blood from the upper part of the head and lower body; therefore, since it is composed of the basilic branch and the cephalic branch, as we have said.
Et conuenit phlebotomanti eam, ut sit super timorem ex phlebotomia eius, nam sub ea est neruus.	And it is fitting for the bloodletter to open it, so that it may be above the terror from its bloodletting, for beneath it is a nerve.
Si ergo addit in punctura phlebotomi, et inuenit neruum, accidit in ea stupor, et difficilis fit sanatio eius, et fortasse non sanatur penitus.	If therefore the bloodletter adds to the puncture of the bloodletting, and finds the nerve, there occurs in it numbness, and healing becomes difficult, and perhaps it does not heal completely.
Et iste neruus multotiens apparet sensui.	And this nerve often appears to the senses.
Si autem occultatur in quibusdam hominibus, et est subtilis, et non ostenditur: tunc oportet ut ponas phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas, sectionem cum Alnesil, et deuita neruum cum fortitudine tua.	If however it is hidden in certain men, and is subtle, and does not show itself: then it is necessary that you place your bloodletting where you bloodlet, a section with the Alnesil, and divide the nerve with your strength.
Quod si uena est inter duos neruos, tunc finde uenam in longitudine.	What if the vein is between two nerves, then find the vein in its length.
Â¶ De uena Cephalica.	On the cephalic vein.
Phlebotomiae autem uenae Cephalicae iuuamentum est, quia attrahit sanguinem ex capite, et confert ad aegritudines oculorum.	The bloodletting of the cephalic vein is beneficial, because it attracts blood from the head, and relieves the weaknesses of the eyes.
Et oportet in hac uena proprie, si uis, ut phlebotomes eam pungendo cum phlebotomo oliuari, aut cum phlebotomo myrtino: quoniam est saluior uenarum omnium, quoniam non est subea arteria, neque neruus.	And it is necessary in this vein particularly, if you wish, to bloodlet it pricking with an olive-shaped bloodletter, or with a myrtle-shaped one: because it is the most healthful of all veins, since there is no artery beneath it, nor nerve.
Verumtamen conuenit tibi apud phlebotomiam, ut deuites cum phlebotomo caput lacerti tantum, et quaeras locum leniorem: et non nocet ei, si non inuenitur cum percussione prima, ut iteretur super eam cum phlebotomia aliquotiens.	However it is fitting for you to bloodlet with caution, so that you divide the head of the vein only, and seek a smoother place: and it does not harm if it is not found with the first percussion, so that it may be repeated over it several times with bloodletting.
Verumtamen fortasse apostematur in quibusdam hominibus quando non phlebotomatur in percussione prima, sed non nocet ei illud apostema in aliquo.	However perhaps there occurs an abscess in certain men when it is not bloodletted at the first percussion, but that abscess does not harm them in any way.
Â¶ De utilitate Phlebotomiae, et cautelis in ea obseruandis.	On the usefulness of bloodletting and the precautions to be observed in it.
Qualitas autem Phlebotomiae, et accidentia eius ex ea, in cuius rectificatione oportet te cogitare.	However, the quality of bloodletting and its accidental effects resulting from it, which require careful consideration in its correct performance.
Primum ergo illius est de quo oportet ut scias, quod phlebotomia non administratur, nisi in conseruatione sanitatis, et perseuerantia eius, et cautela ab aduentu aegritudinum.	Firstly, it is essential to know that bloodletting should not be administered unless for the conservation of health, its preservation, and caution against the onset of diseases.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in una uenarum trium quae sunt in cubito, scilicet Cephalica, et Fusca, et Basilica.	And that bloodletting should be performed on one of the three veins that are located in the elbow, namely the Cephalic, the Fusca, and the Basilic.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in principio Veris super ieiunium, in uere, et aestate: et autumno, et hyeme post comestionem, quando apparent significationes repletionis.	And that bloodletting should be performed at the beginning of spring, on an empty stomach, and in the summer; and in autumn and winter after digestion, when signs of repletion appear.
Et fiat phlebotomia in die primo, aut in tertio, postquam praeterierint de die tres horae.	And let bloodletting be performed on the first day, or on the third day, after three hours have passed since dawn.
Phlebotomia autem quae administratur in aegritudinibus, non habet horam determinatam: sed quando prouocat conuenientia et necessitas ad illud, in nocte, aut die, et in omni hora, et in omni tempore.	However, bloodletting that is administered for diseases does not have a fixed hour: but rather when convenience and necessity demand it, whether at night, or day, and in every hour, and at all times.
Et non oportet, ut phlebotomentur pueri, donec ueniant super eos quatuordecim anni.	And it is not suitable for children to be bloodletted until they reach fourteen years of age.
Neque phlebotometur mulier praegnans, nisi a mense quarto usque ad septimum.	Nor should pregnant women be bloodletted, unless from the fourth month up to the seventh.
Neque phlebotomentur senes, qui iam pertransierunt sexaginta annos.	Nor should old people be bloodletted who have already passed sixty years of age.
Cum ergo aliquis uult phlebotomari propter quemcumque modum sit: oportet, ut mundificet intestina sua ante phlebotomiam cum clisteri leni, si in eis est stercus multum retentum: ut non attrahant uenae apud phlebotomiam ex intestinis superfluitates putridas nocentes membris principalibus.	When someone wishes to be bloodletted for any reason: it is necessary to cleanse their intestines beforehand with a gentle clyster, if there is much retained feces in them, so that the veins do not draw out putrid and noxious superfluities from the intestines during bloodletting, which harm the principal members.
Neque phlebotometur patiens toctina, id est, satietatem nauseatiuam: neque crapulatus, neque euadens ab ebrietate, donec remoueatur illud ab eis.	Nor should those who are tired or nauseous be bloodletted, nor those who are intoxicated from drinking, until they are freed from that condition.
Neque infirmus cum hydropisi.	Neither weak with dropsy.
Et caueatur phlebotomia iterum post colicam passionem, et uomitum, et fluxum uentris, et multiplicationem coitus, et laboris, et exercitii, et uigiliarum, et ieiunii, et omnis quod dissoluit uirtutem ex re corporea aut animali.	And beware of phlebotomy repeated after a bout of passion, and vomiting, and flux of the stomach, and excessive coitus, and labor, and exercise, and wakefulness, and fasting, and all that which dissolves the virtues from the bodily or animal corpus.
Deinde considera in subtilitate humorum ante illud, si sanguis est grossus cum cibis et potibus, et medicinis: si possibile est ei illud.	Then consider the subtlety of the humors beforehand, if the blood is thick with food and drink, and medicines: if it is possible for him.
Deinde introeat balneum, si non prohibet ipsum aliquid: aut exercitetur aliquo exercitio, ut subtilietur sanguis.	Then let him take a bath, if nothing prohibits it: or let him be exercised by some exercise, so that the blood may be subtly thinned.
Et pone phlebotomiam eius in pectore, circa tertiam diei, sicut diximus: et conare, ut euacuetur pectus eius illa die ex omnibus accidentibus animalibus malis: sicut angustia, et ira, et timor: et ex omnibus accidentibus corporeis, sicut labor, et poena, et superfluicoitus, et illis similia.	And let phlebotomy be applied to his chest, around the third day, as we have said: and take care, so that his chest may be evacuated of all bad animal accidents on that day: such as anxiety, and anger, and fear: and from all bodily accidents, such as labor, and pain, and overexertion, and similar things.
Et sedi suae faciat esse praesentes res cum quarum usu cucurrit consuetudo hominum ex aromaticitate, et odoramento, et tripudio et similibus illis per quantitatem possibilitatis.	And let him have present things with which he is familiar through the use of aromatics, and perfumes, and trips and similar things to those in accordance with the quantity of possibility.
Deinde sedeat phlebotomator super puluinari, quod sit altius quam puluinar phlebotomandi: postea extrahat brachium suum, et fricet ipsum phlebotomator manu sua bis, aut ter.	Then let the phlebotomist sit on a pillow, which is higher than the pillow of the one being phlebotomized: afterwards let him draw out his arm, and rub it with his hand two or three times.
Deinde stringat ligamentum cum corrigia, et inuoluat eam bis.	Then let him tie the ligature with a cord, and wrap it twice.
Et sit strictura temperata, quoniam strictura quando est inaequalis, aut per superfluitatem in strictura, tunc prohibet cursum sanguinis: aut in mollificatione, tunc etiam prohibet cursum sanguinis.	And let the stricture be moderate, because when the stricture is unequal, or excessive in the stricture, then it prohibits the flow of blood: or in relaxation, then also it prohibits the flow of blood.
Deinde post stricturam oportet, ut fricet phlebotomandus manus suas simul adinuicem, donec inflentur uenae, et declarentur sensui.	Then after the stricture it is necessary to rub the hands of the one being phlebotomized simultaneously, until the veins become inflated and declare themselves to the senses.
Deinde abstergat phlebotomator phlebotomum cum pauco oleo, antiquo proprie.	Then the surgeon removes the bloodletting instrument with a little oil, properly and skillfully.
Deinde ponat digitum suum indicem manus sinistrae super ipsam uenam sub loco cuius phlebotomiam uult, parum: ut non fugiat uena, et cassetur percussio.	Then he places his index finger of his left hand on the vein under the location where he wants to perform the bloodletting, gently: so that the vein does not flee and is compressed by the percussion.
Quoniam ex uenis est quam inuenis sicut chordam fugientem apud phlebotomiam: et ex eis est quae est plena uentositate: et quando ponis phlebotomum super eam, contrahitur sub phlebotomo, et decipitur phlebotomator, et non aperit phlebotomus uenam: et si aperit eam, est stricta: propter illud ergo oportet, ut firmetur phlebotomator, et sit sollicitus in his rebus omnibus.	Since the vein is like a fleeing chord during bloodletting: and it is one of those that is full of windiness: and when you place the bloodletting instrument on it, it contracts under the instrument, and the surgeon is deceived, and the instrument does not open the vein: and if it opens it, it is constricted: therefore for this reason it is necessary to steady the instrument, and one should be solicitous in all these matters.
Deinde deponat phlebotomum.	Then he puts down the bloodletting instrument.
Si ergo aperitur uena ex uice una, tunc bonum est.	If then the vein is opened with a single stroke, it is good.
Et si non, tunc itera illud uice alia sub illo loco parum, aut supra ipsum cum festinatione: si non apostematur locus.	And if not, then try that stroke again at another place nearby with gentle pressure, or above it with quickness: if the spot is not missed.
Quod si apostematur, aut expauescit infirmus, tunc dimitte eum die, aut duobus diebus: et non stringat ligamentum.	What if the spot is missed, or the patient becomes weak, then leave him for a day, or two days: and do not tighten the bandage.
Fortasse enim attrahet apostema calidum.	Perhaps indeed it will attract a warm poultice.
Neque ingrediatur balneum.	Nor should he take a bath.
Deinde iteret phlebotomiam, si amat.	Then repeat the bloodletting, if necessary.
Quod si apertio est parua, aut currit sanguis subtiliter: et times ut non egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uis: tunc itera phlebotomum in foramine ipso secundum rectitudinem, et adde in operatione parum.	What if the opening is small, or the blood flows subtly: and sometimes so that the quantity of blood does not flow out as desired: then try the instrument again in the same opening according to the straightness, and add a little to the operation.
Et fac illud cum festinatione, antequam apostemetur locus, apostematus enim locus est in multis hominibus apud operationem paruam.	And do it quickly, before the spot is missed, for a missed spot is frequent in many people during a small operation.
Si ergo uides ipsum iam apostematum, tunc non iteres super ipsum omnino, non enim excusat apud te aliquid.	If you see that it has already been missed, then do not try again at all, for nothing is exempt with regard to you.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex faece olei: quoniam alleuiat cursum sanguinis.	And put upon it something from the dregs of oil: because it alleviates the flow of blood.
Et est melior in hoc loco quam oleum ipsum, et quam reliqua olea.	And it is better in this place than the oil itself, and than other oils.
Et similiter administra faecem olei in omni phlebotomia tua, qua phlebotomas uenas apud prohibitionem cursus sanguinis: et faciunt illud tyriaca alfarach, et sagzenea, quando ponitur ex una earum super locum.	And similarly administer the dregs of oil in all your bloodletting, where the bloodletters prohibit the flow of blood: and they make that tyrical treatment, and sagzeneca, when it is applied from one of them to the affected area.
Sanguis enim subtiliatur et resoluitur, quando est grossus.	For the blood is subtly refined and resolved when it is thick.
Quod si accidat in loco phlebotomiae apostema magnum, nam multotiens accidit, praecipue ei qui non est phlebotomatus nisi uice illa, aut est apertio uenae parua, tunc propera et pone super locum spongiam infusam in aqua et sale, calefacta parumper: et stringe eam hora una: quoniam soluitur.	When a large apostemation occurs at the site of bloodletting, which often happens, especially to one who has not been bled except at that time, or has a small opening of the vein, then apply and place on the area a sponge infused with hot water and salt for a short while: and bind it for an hour: because it is dissolved.
Et oportet, ut facias illud post exitum sanguinis ex uena ipsa, cum complemento sui, aut ex uena alia.	And it is necessary to do that after the blood has flowed out of the vein itself, with a complementary treatment, or from another vein.
Quod si remanet in loco post dies aliquid nigredinis, aut uiriditatis, non nocet illud: et si uis, pone super ipsum aliquid aloe, aut myrrhae solutorum: aut aliquid ex succo menthastri, id est, calamenti aut simile illius.	If something blackish or greenish remains at the site after several days, it does not harm: and if you wish, apply to it something soluble of aloe, or myrrh; or something from the juice of menthastrum, that is, calament or similar to that.
Et multotiens quidem accidunt apostemata et eminentiae apud phlebotomiam Basilicae.	And indeed, apostemations and swellings often occur at the site of bloodletting of the basilic vein.
Pone ergo manum tuam super ipsam, tunc si inuenis molliciem apud compressionem tuam super ipsam, tunc illa eminentia est mala.	Put your hand therefore upon it, then if you find softness at the site of your compression, then that swelling is bad.
Caue ergo, ut ponas super eam aliquid ex eo quod diximus.	Take heed therefore, to apply to it something from what we have mentioned.
Nam fortasse fluet ex ea sanguis arteriae.	For perhaps the blood flows out of the artery.
Sed fac emplastrum ei cum eo in quo est stipticitas, ut induretur locus.	But make an application to it with that which has astringency, so that the site may be dried.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
Et oportet, ut extrahas omni homini ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis suae.	And it is necessary to extract from every man, in proportion to the quantity of his own blood, according to the amount of his vital strength.
Et quod apparet ex colore uincente super sanguinem.	And what appears from the wine-like color above the blood.
Nam sanguis si est niger, tunc dimitte ipsum exire, donec rubeat: et similiter si uides ipsum grossum: tunc dimitte eum, donec subtilietur: et similiter si est acutus, donec auferatur acuitas eius.	For if the blood is black, then let it flow out until it becomes red; and similarly if you see it thick, then let it flow out until it becomes subtle; and similarly if it is acute, until its acuteness is relieved.
Et oportet ei qui est plenus, fortis, et indiget extractione sanguinis uice una, ut amplificetur phlebotomia uenae, et sit phlebotomus latus: et in eo qui est debilis, sit econtrario illius.	And it is necessary for him who is full, strong, and needs the extraction of blood once, that the phlebotomy of the veins be amplified, and the phlebotomist be skilled; and in him who is weak, let it be the opposite of this.
Et oportet, ut extrahat ipsum in uicibus, et ut sit foramen strictum: et melius quod administratur in phlebotomia uenae est, ut sit transuersa sectio, non punctura.	And it is necessary to extract it from the veins, and that the opening be narrow; and what is better administered in the phlebotomy of the veins is a crosswise section, not a puncture.
Et iste modus phlebotomiae est saluus a fluxu sanguinis, et ab incisione nerui: et est laudabilior, et saluior quam phlebotomia per latitudinem et longitudinem.	And this mode of phlebotomy is safe from the flow of blood, and from incision of a nerve; and it is more praiseworthy and more salutary than phlebotomy by width and length.
Et cui consueuit peruenire apud phlebotomiam syncopis, oportet ut cibes ante phlebotomiam modico pane infuso in aqua granati muzi: aut secaniabin, si est calefactus: et extrahas ei ex sanguine in tribus uicibus, aut quatuor.	And he who is accustomed to faint upon approaching phlebotomy, it is necessary that he eats beforehand a moderate bread infused in water of granated muzi: or dates, if he is overheated; and extracts from the blood in three veins, or four.
Et si est infrigidatae complexionis, tunc accipiat ante phlebotomiam panem infusum in syrupo miua, aut in syrupo de melle aromatizato cum speciebus, aut in syrupo aromatizato odorifero.	And if he is of an infrigidated complexion, then let him take beforehand bread infused in syrup of mia, or in syrup of honey aromatized with spices, or in syrup aromatized with fragrant odor.
Quod si accidat syncopis apud phlebotomiam, et est caussa eius exitus sanguinis multi: tunc oportet, ut sumat in potu aquam carnis, et syrupum odoriferum subtilem: et utatur aromaticitate cum algalia, et liniatur pectus eius cum ea: et utatur reliquis quae diximus in diuisione in capitulo syncopis ex euacuatione.	What if syncope occurs upon phlebotomy, and the cause of its abundant blood flow is multiple: then it is necessary that he takes in a drink water of flesh, and subtle fragrant syrup; and let him be treated with aromaticity with galangal, and his chest be lined with these; and let him use the remaining things which we mentioned in the division on syncope from evacuation.
Qui autem uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo: oportet ei cuius phlebotomia est propter euacuationem multam, et uirtus eius est debilis, ut soluat sanguinem paulatim per quantitatem uirtutis in diebus continuis.	Whoever wants to evacuate his arm and release his blood a second time: it is necessary for him whose phlebotomy is due to excessive evacuation, and his strength is weak, so that he releases the blood gradually according to his strength over continuous days.
Qui uero uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo, et est corpus eius forte: tunc faciat illud post septem horas, aut nouem a phlebotomia sua prima.	Whoever wants to evacuate his arm and release his blood a second time, and his body is strong: then he should do it seven hours later, or nine hours after his first phlebotomy.
Qui autem uult attrahere sanguinem ex corpore suo ad contrarium partis ad quam declinat: oportet ut euentetur ei in die secundo, aut in tertio.	Whoever wants to attract blood from his body to the opposite part to which it declines: it is necessary that he be evacuated on the second day, or on the third.
In cuius uero corpore est sanguis multus iam calefactus, et acuitur, et facit accidere febrem: oportet, ut egrediatur ex eo sanguis in uice una, et extrahatur ex eo quantitas multa: et amplificetur apertio usquequo accidat syncopis: postquam tu fueris conseruans omnes conditiones phlebotomiae: et ut ponas manum tuam super pulsum eius apud cursum sanguinis, ut non accidat mors loco syncopis.	In whom there is already much heated blood in his body, and it becomes sharp, and causes a fever to occur: it is necessary that the blood flow out of him at once, and a large quantity be extracted from him; and the opening should be widened until syncopation occurs. After you have observed all the conditions of phlebotomy, and you have placed your hand on his pulse at the course of the blood, so that death does not occur in place of syncopation.
Multotiens enim accidit illud, quando ignorat phlebotomator, et cadit negligentia.	For it often happens thus, when the phlebotomist is ignorant and falls into negligence.
Et non oportet quando uis soluere brachium, et soluere sanguinem secundo, cum iam clausum sit orificium uenae, et fiat difficilis exitus sanguinis, ut prematur super ipsum cum uehementia, et curuatum extendatur uelociter.	And it is not necessary when you want to release the arm and release the blood a second time, since the opening of the vein is already closed, and the exit of the blood becomes difficult, so that you press on it with vehemence, and the curvature is extended more quickly.
Nam illud est malum ualde, imo dimitte ipsum, donec phlebotometur secundo.	For that is a great evil, indeed abandon it, until it can be phlebotomized a second time.
Aut remoue cum acuitate phlebotomi illud quod coagulatum est ex sanguine in orificio uenae, et pone super ipsum aliquid salis dissoluti in aqua.	Or remove with an acute phlebotomy what has been coagulated from the blood in the opening of the vein, and apply to it something salty dissolved in water.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex tyriaca alfaroch, aut sagzenea, et pone ipsum compressione leni, donec egrediatur sanguis.	And apply to it something from tyriaca alfaroch or sagzenea, and apply a gentle compression, until the blood flows out.
Si uero iam apostemata est uena, tunc dimitte eam, et non tegas eam, donec sedetur apostema.	If indeed an abscess has formed a vein, then leave it alone and do not touch it, until the abscess settles.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad soluendum sanguinem secundo, et non est excusatio, tunc aut phlebotoma ipsum supra illum locum, aut in brachio alio in uena alia.	What if necessity provokes to release the blood a second time, and there is no excuse, then either perform phlebotomy at that spot, or on another arm in another vein.
Funis autem brachii phlebotomatur loco Fuscae, et Basilicae, cum non inueniuntur, et sunt occultae, quoniam est composita ex eis.	The veins of the arm are phlebotomized at the place of the Forked and Basilic veins, when they cannot be found, and are hidden, because it is composed from them.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus manum suam in aqua calida, donec rubeat focile, et appareat uena manifeste.	And the quality of that phlebotomy is such that a weak hand is immersed in hot water, until it becomes red and the veins appear manifestly.
Deinde stringatur super ipsam cum ligamento parum constrictione media.	Then let it be bound above it with a ligature of moderate constriction.
Deinde phlebotoma secundum transuersationem paulatim, non latitudinaliter, neque secundum longitudinem: et sit apertio ampla, et sit phlebotomia tua qua eam phlebotomas super iuncturam manus parumper.	Then perform the second phlebotomy transversely, gradually, not latitudinally, nor along the length; and let the opening be wide, and let your phlebotomy be such that you phlebotomize above the joint of the hand somewhat.
Quod si prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera manum in aqua calida, et dimitte sanguinem currere in aqua, donec consequaris necessitatem tuam.	What if the flow of blood is prohibited, then immerse the hand in hot water, and let the blood flow into the water, until you achieve your necessity.
Si autem fueris in diebus aestatis, tunc excusaris ab iteratione manus in aqua calida.	If however you are in the days of summer, then excuse yourself from immersing the hand in hot water repeatedly.
Et plurimum quidem ponitur cursus sanguinis in aqua calida in tempore hyemis.	And indeed the flow of blood is mostly promoted by immersion in hot water during winter time.
Et phlebotomia huius uenae est saluior omnibus uenis, quoniam non est sub ea uena pulsatilis, neque neruus.	And the phlebotomy of this vein is more beneficial than all the veins, because there is no pulsation beneath that vein, nor a nerve.
Phlebotomia uero Saluatellae manus dextrae, est conferens aegritudinibus epatis.	The phlebotomy of the Salvatella vein on the right hand is beneficial for liver diseases.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringas mahason manus cum ligamento, aut manu tua, postquam tu intromittis eam in aquam calidam, donec infletur uena, et demonsteretur sensui ualde.	And the quality of that phlebotomy is such that you bind the hand with a ligature, or your own hand, after you have immersed it in hot water, until the vein becomes inflated and demonstrates its sensation strongly.
Deinde phlebotoma eam transuersando.	Then, he makes an incision across the vein.
Et si incidis eam totaliter, non nocebit ei illud in aliquo.	And if you cut it completely, it will not harm him at all.
Et conserua, ne ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo.	And be careful, lest you ultimately harm your hand with the scalpel.
Sub ea enim sunt nerui digitorum denudati ex carne.	For beneath it are the exposed nerve fibers of the fingers, stripped of flesh.
Deinde itera manum ad aquam calidam, et dimitte currere sanguinem in ea.	Then put your hand into warm water, and let the blood flow from it.
Nam si tu non iteras eam in aqua calida, coagulatur sanguis in orificio uenae, et prohibetur a cursu.	For if you do not soak it in warm water, the blood will clot in the opening of the vein, and be prevented from flowing.
Cum ergo extraxeris ex sanguine quantitatem necessitatis, tunc pone super uenam oleum et sal: ut non consolidetur uelociter.	When you have extracted the necessary amount of blood, then apply oil and salt to the vein: so that it does not close too quickly.
Et similiter oportet, ut facias cum omni ramo stricto.	And similarly, it is necessary to do with every constricted branch.
Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae eius ex manu sinistra, est: quoniam est conferens ad aegritudines splenis: et similiter fac in phlebotomia eius, sicut fecisti in secunda aequaliter.	The treatment of his phlebotomy from the left hand is this: because it is conducive to diseases of the spleen; and similarly do in his phlebotomy as you did in the second one equally.
Saphenae autem phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad aegritudines quae sunt in inferiori parte corporis, sicut aegritudines matricum, et retentionem menstruorum, et infirmitates renum, et ulcera coxarum et crurium antiqua, et similia ex aegritudinibus.	The treatment of the saphena phlebotomy is for diseases that are in the lower part of the body, such as diseases of the womb, and retention of menstruation, and weaknesses of the kidneys, and old ulcers of the hips and thighs, and similar afflictions.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus pedem suum in aquam calidam: et faciat super ipsum fricationem, donec exuberent uenae: et liga supra iuncturam pedis cum corrigia.	And the quality of his phlebotomy is that he should immerse his weak foot in warm water: and make friction upon it, until the veins overflow: and bind above the joint of the foot with a bandage.
Et uenae quidem locus est apud calcaneum, apparens uersus pollicem: et ramificantur ex ea in facie pedis rami multi.	And indeed the vein is located at the heel, appearing opposite the big toe: and many branches radiate from it on the surface of the foot.
Phlebotoma ergo eam in ampliore ramo eius, aut apud calcaneum in aggregatione eius: quoniam est melius et saluius.	Then make an incision on his larger vein, or at the heel in its confluence: because it is better and more healthy.
Quod si phlebotomas eam in facie pedis, tunc caue a neruis qui sunt sub ea super faciem pedis.	For if you make an incision on the surface of the foot, then beware of the nerves that are beneath it on the surface of the foot.
Et pone phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas ex transuerso, quasi tu uelis incidere eam: et sit phlebotomus Nesil.	And place your phlebotomy there where you make incisions transversely, as if you were going to cut into it; and let the phlebotomist be skilled.
Si autem prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera pedem eius in aqua calida: et dimitte sanguinem currere in eam, donec euacuatur.	If the flow of blood is prohibited, then put his foot in warm water, and let the blood flow into it until it is evacuated.
Quod si errat uenam phlebotomator in prima uice, tunc iteret cum phlebotomia ad superiora parumper, nam locus est saluus, et non times ex eo maliciam, quando tu caues a neruis, sicut diximus.	What if the phlebotomist errs in the first instance, then let him repeat with phlebotomy above, for the place is sound, and you do not take evil from it when you cut into a vein, as we have said.
Et similiter cum Saphena pedis alterius aequaliter.	And similarly with the saphenous vein of the other foot equally.
Venae autem Sciaticae locus, sicut diximus, est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	The location of the sciatic veins, as we have said, is at the heel on the lateral side of the forest.
Et iuuamentum phlebotomiae eius est, ad dolorem anchae, quando est propter sanguinem calidum.	And the benefit of his phlebotomy is to alleviate pain in the hip, when it is because of hot blood.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut ingrediatur infirmus balneum, et festinet: et stringe crus eius a latere anchae usque supra calcaneum quatuor digitis, cum uitta subtili longa: non enim apparet nisi propter illud.	And the quality of his phlebotomy is that the weak patient should enter the bath, and be fastened: and let the leg be tied from the side of the hip up to the heel with a four-finger-long thin thread; for it does not appear otherwise except because of that.
Quando ergo apparet, tunc phlebotoma eam secundum quodcumque ingenium est tibi possibile, aut secundum transuersionem: et est melius, aut ut incidas eam incisione, aut seces eam sectione.	When it appears, then make the phlebotomy according to whatever ingenuity is possible for you, or according to the transverse method: and it is better, either to cut into it with an incision, or to section it.
Locus enim eius est saluior, et ipsa est in pluribus hominibus occulta ualde.	For the location of it is more healthy, and it itself is hidden very deeply in many men.
Quod si non inuenis eam, et non apparet sensui omnino: tunc phlebotoma aliquem ramum eius, et est ille qui apparet in dorso pedis, et uersus auricularem: et caue a neruis, et fac currere ex sanguine quantitatem quam uis.	What if you do not find it, and it does not appear to the sense at all: then make an incision on some branch of it, and it is that which appears on the back of the foot, and near the little ear: and cut into a vein, and let flow from the blood as much quantity as you wish.
Deinde solue stricturam, et pone super locum phlebotomiae corium, et stringe locum.	Then loosen the binding, and put a piece of leather over the place of the phlebotomy, and tie the place.
Uelociter enim sanatur.	For a wound, indeed, it is healed.
Â¶ De Ventosatione, et qualitate usus eius.	Concerning the blowing, and the quality of its use.
Caput XCVIII.	Chapter 48.
Uentosae fiunt ex cornibus, et ex aere, et ex uitro.	Ventoses are made from horns, and from copper, and from glass.
Et Ventosatio quidem fit secundum duos modos.	And the blowing is done in two ways indeed.
Cum scarificatione, et extractione sanguinis: et alter est uentosatio sine scarificatione.	With scarification and bloodletting; and the other is blowing without scarification.
Et haec Ventosatio quae est sine scarificatione, est secundum duos modos.	And this blowing that is without scarification is in two ways.
Aut enim est cum igne.	Or it is with fire.
Aut est absque igne.	Or it is without fire.
Et uentosis quae administrantur cum scarificatione et extractione sanguinis sunt quatuordecim loca corporis.	And the blowings that are administered with scarification and bloodletting are fourteen places of the body.
Quorum unus est, Ventosatio Alnocrati, et est postremum capitis: et Alkehel, et est medium colli: et uentosae Alhagdahim, et sunt duae laminae colli a duabus partibus simul: et uentosae menti, et est sub mandibula in inferiori oris: et uentosae duarum spatularum: et uentosae Alachosos super finem caudae: et uentosae duorum focilium, et sunt medium duorum brachiorum: et uentosae duorum crurium: et uentosae duarum cauillarum.	Of which one is the blowing of Alnocrati, and it is at the back of the head; and Alkehel, and it is in the middle of the neck; and the blowings of Alhagdahim, and they are two layers of the neck from both sides together; and the blowings of the mind, and it is under the jawbone in the lower jaw; and the blowings of the two spatulas; and the blowings of Alachosos above the end of the tail; and the blowings of the two thighs, and they are in the middle of the two arms; and the blowings of the two legs; and the blowings of the two hips.
Et Ventosatio quidem non extrahit sanguinem tibi ex uenis minutis sparsis in carne, et propter illud non cadit uirtus ex eis, sicut est casus eius ex phlebotomia.	And indeed the blowing does not extract blood from you through small scattered veins in the flesh, and because of that, virtue does not flow out from them, just as it is the case with phlebotomy.
Neque oportet, ut administretur uentosatio siue cum igne, aut absque igne in aliqua aegritudinum quae fiunt ex repletione, donec euacuetur totum corpus.	Nor is it necessary to administer blowing, whether with fire or without fire, in any disease that occurs due to fullness, until the whole body is evacuated.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad Ventosationem ex aegritudine, aut propter consuetudinem, administramus eam in omni hora in principio mensis, in fine eius, et in medio ipsius, et in quocumque tempore fuerit.	Because if necessity provokes blowing due to illness or because of habit, we administer it at every hour, at the beginning of the month, at its end, and in the middle of it, and at whatever time it may be.
Quod est, quia ex hominibus est qui quando multiplicatur in eo sanguis, donec indiget extractione eius per uentosationem, inuenit in capite suo grauedinem, et sodahan.	What is it, because it is from humans who, when the blood in them multiplies, then it needs to be extracted through venesection, finds a heaviness in its head and swooning.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit repletionem et rubedinem in facie sua, capite suo, et collo suo.	And there are those who find fullness and redness in their face, head, and neck.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit pruritum in facie sua, et fronte sua, et tenebrositatem, et hebetudinem in oculis suis.	And there are those who find itchiness in their face, and forehead, and darkness, and dullness in their eyes.
Et ex eis est qui scalpit locum uentosationis suae.	And there are those who scratch the place of their venesection.
Et ex eis est cuius risus multiplicatur.	And there are those whose laughter is multiplied.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit gustum sanguinis in ore suo: aut apostematur lingua, et expuit sanguinem.	And there are those who find a taste of blood in their mouth: or their tongue becomes blistered, and they spit out blood.
Et ex eis est cuius somnus multiplicatur.	And there are those whose sleep is multiplied.
Et ex eis est qui uidet in somno suo sanguinem et rubedinem, et interfectos, et plagas, et quae sunt similia illis.	And there are those who see in their sleep blood and redness, and wounds, and sores, and things that are similar to them.
Quando ergo uidemus aliquid ex illis, et proprie si est in tertia media mensis: praecipimus tunc uentosationem fieri, postquam praeterierunt de die duae horae, aut tres.	When therefore we see something of those, and it is specifically in the middle third of the month: we order then that venesection be done, after they have passed two days or three hours.
Iuuamentum autem Ventosationis nuchae, est: quoniam ipsa confert ad grauitatem in capite, et quod effunditur ad oculos.	The benefit of venesection on the neck is that it reduces heaviness in the head and what flows out to the eyes.
At uero oportet, ut sit illud post euacuationem totius corporis.	But it is necessary that it be after the evacuation of the whole body.
Et haec quidem Ventosa est loco phlebotomiae Cephalicae.	And this indeed is instead of phlebotomy of the head.
Et non licet, ut utatur ea qui est frigidae complexionis, aut in quo est catarrus.	And it is not permitted that one should use it who has a cold complexion or in whom there is catarrh.
Nam infert ei nocumentum magnum.	For it brings him great harm.
Et propter illud non oportet, ut utantur ea senes, et in cuius capite sunt aegritudines frigidae.	And because of that it is not fitting that the old use it, and in whom there are cold headaches.
Qui autem super eam fit assiduus, generatur super eum obliuio.	Whoever, however, fits frequently over it, forgetfulness is generated over him.
Et propter illud oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut deponat manum suam cum uentosa parumper ad inferiora, timendo ex generatione obliuionis.	And because of that it is fitting that you instruct the Venesectioner to put his hand with the venesection for a short time only on the lower parts, fearing the generation of forgetfulness.
Ventosatio aut Alkehel, est loco phlebotomiae Fuscae, et phlebotomiae Basilicae, et propter illud confert asmati, et constrictioni anhelitus, et fissurae instrumenti anhelitus, et tussi, et repletioni.	The ventilation or Alkehel is the place of phlebotomy of Fuscae, and phlebotomy of Basilicae, and because of that it brings about constriction and narrowing of the windpipe, and fissure of the instrument of the windpipe, and coughing, and replenishment.
Et oportet, ut impellatur Ventosa Alkehel parumper, quoniam si ponitur inferius, generat debilitatem in corde, et stomacho.	And it is necessary that the Ventosa Alkehel is pressed strongly, because if it is placed below, it generates weakness in the heart and stomach.
Ventosatio uero alhagdahim, confert doloribus accidentibus in capite, et obtalmiae, et hemigraneae, et perforationi, et dolori in radicibus dentium: et est loco phlebotomiae Basilicae.	Ventosatio indeed alhagdahim, brings about painful accidents in the head, and opthalmia, and hemicrania, and perforation, and pain in the roots of the teeth: and it is the place of phlebotomy of Basilicae.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne premat manum suam cum scarificatione: ut non incidat arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And it is necessary that you warn the Ventosator, not to press his hand with the scarification: so that he may not cut an artery and cause a flow of blood.
Ventosatio autem sub mento, confert alcolae in ore, et corruptioni gingiuae, et similibus eis ex aegritudinibus quae sunt in ore: et stat loco phlebotomiae alieherich, quae sunt in duobus labiis.	Ventosatio however under the chin, brings about ulcers in the mouth, and corruption of the gums, and similar things from the illnesses that are in the mouth: and it stands in place of phlebotomy of alieherich, which are in both lips.
Ventosatio autem spatularum, confert ad alchafacham, quae fit ex replexione, et caliditate.	Ventosatio however a spatula, brings about a treatment by friction, which is made from repetition and warmth.
Ventosatio uero interiorum partium duorum focilium, confert iuuamentum phlebotomiae uenarum trium, Basilicae, et Fuscae, et Cephalicae: quoniam ipsa attrahit sanguinem ex omnibus illis uenis minutis, quae sunt in carne: et attrahunt illae uenae minutae ex uenis aliis grossioribus eis, donec peruenit attractio ad uenas tres.	Ventosatio indeed the interior part of two veins, brings about an aid to phlebotomy of three veins, Basilicae, and Fuscae, and Cephalicae: because it itself attracts blood from all those small veins that are in the flesh: and those small veins attract from other larger veins, until the attraction reaches the three veins.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne multum procedat in scarificatione: quoniam locus est denudatus carne, et sub eo sunt nerui et arteriae.	And it is necessary that you warn the Ventosator, not to proceed too far in the scarification: because the place is stripped of flesh, and beneath it are nerves and arteries.
Ventosa autem quae uentosatur super alchausos, confert hemorroidibus Ani, et ulceribus inferioribus.	The Ventosa however that ventilates upon the Alchausos, brings about hemorrhoids of the anus, and ulcers of the lower parts.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut sit uentosa magna, et ut sit ex aere: quoniam locus indiget suctione forti, et fortasse franguntur Ventosae subtiles: et scarificetur scarificatione magna.	And it is necessary to make a large incision with a scalpel, so that it may be a large wound, and so that it may be from the air; because the place needs strong suction, and perhaps subtle veins will be broken. And let there be made a great scarification by a great scarification.
Ventosae autem crurium minuunt diminutione manifesta: quoniam attrahunt sanguinem ex toto corpore, et conferunt doloribus antiquis in renibus, et matricibus, et uesica: prouocant menstrua, et conferunt bothor, et ademenul: et stant loco phlebotomiae duarum saphenarum, et alhorcobeni.	The veins, however, diminish with a manifest diminution; because they attract blood from the entire body and contribute to ancient pains in the kidneys, and uterus, and bladder: they provoke menstruation, and contribute to bothor, and ademenul. And they stand in place of phlebotomy of two saphenous veins and alhorcobeni.
Verumtamen debilitant corpus multum, et faciunt accidere syncopim in pluribus hominibus.	However, they weaken the body greatly, and cause fainting to occur in many people.
Et Ventosarum alhorcobeni iuuamentum est propinquum iuuamento Ventosarum duorum crurium.	And the benefit of the saphenous veins is closely connected to the benefit of the two crural veins.
Qualitas positionis Ventosarum est, ut ponas uentosam in primis uacuam, et sugas suctione temperata: et non prolonges positionem uentosarum, sed pone eas uelociter, et remoue eas uelociter, ut ueniant humores ad locum aduentu aequali: et non cesses iterare illud et continuare, donec uideas locum iam rubere et inflari, et appareat rubedo sanguinis: tunc ergo scarifica, et itera suctione paulatim.	The quality of the position of the veins is such that you should place the scalpel in the first empty space, and apply moderate suction: and do not prolong the position of the veins, but rather put them quickly, and remove them quickly, so that they draw humors to the place of arrival equally: and do not cease to repeat it and continue, until you see the place now red and inflamed, and appears red with blood: then indeed scarify, and apply suction gradually.
Deinde considera in dispositione corporum.	Then consider in the disposition of the bodies.
Nam qui ex hominibus est tenerae carnis, rarorum pororum, oportet ut scarifices ipsum semel, non plus: ut non ulceretur locus.	For one who has a tender flesh and rare pores, it is necessary to scarify him only once, not more: so that the place may not become ulcerated.
Et praecipe Ventosatori, ut amplificet scarificationem, et profundet parum: et temperet suctionem in facilitate, et uelocitate, et motu suaui.	And instruct the surgeon to amplify the scarification, and to make it rather deep: and to moderate the suction in ease, and speed, and gentle motion.
Quod si in sanguine est grossitudo, tunc oportet, ut scarifices ipsum bis.	If there is thickness in the blood, then it is necessary to scarify him twice.
In uice quidem prima aperitur uia subtiliationi sanguinis, et aquositati eius: et in secunda quidem perscrutationi exquisitae extractionis sanguinis grossi.	Firstly, indeed, the way is opened to subtlety of blood and its refinement: and secondly, to a precise scrutiny of exact extraction of thick blood.
Si uero sanguis est faeculentus ualde, tunc fiat scarificatio uice tertia: ut consequatur ultimum.	If the blood is foul and thick, then let the scarification be done for the third time, so that it may reach the ultimate.
Et ad ultimum, quando uolumus extrahere sanguinem paulatim, uel parumper, sufficit nobis scarificatio una.	And to the end, when we want to extract blood little by little, or for a short time, one scarification is sufficient for us.
Quod si uolumus extractionem sanguinis multi, scarificamus scarificatione plurima.	Because if we want to extract much blood, we make multiple scarifications with many scarifications.
Et si nos mensuramus, quod sanguis est grossus: tunc oportet, ut scarificetur scarificatione profunda: et terminus aequalis in scarificatione, est profunditas cutis.	And if we measure it, because the blood is thick: then it is necessary that the scarification be deep: and the equal limit in the scarification is the depth of the skin.
Â¶ Quid sit illud quod oportet administrari ex oleis apud positionem Ventosarum, et quid caueat uentosandus.	What is that which needs to be administered from oils at the position of Veinsarum, and what cures a Veinsarum patient.
IN illo quidem cuius cutis est grossa, dura, fusca, et pori eius sunt stricti, oportet ut ungantur loca Ventosare cum oleis apertiuis, lenitiuis, resolutiuis: si est in tempore aestatis, sicut est oleum alkeiri, aut oleum uiolatum, aut oleum de amigdalis dulcibus, aut oleum de semine cucurbitae.	In that case where the skin is thick, hard, dark, and its pores are constricted, it is necessary to anoint the Veinsarum places with open, gentle, and resolvent oils: if it is in the summer season, such as oil of alexandrian siles, or violet oil, or oil from sweet almonds, or oil from cucumber seed.
Et si est in tempore hyemis, tunc oleum narcissinum, aut oleum de lilio, aut oleum camomellinum, aut sarbatinum: et eis similia.	And if it is in the winter season, then narcissus oil, or oil from lily, or chamomile oil, or sabbatine oil: and similar ones.
Si uero superfluitas est grossa, frigida: tunc oleum sit amaracinum, aut oleum de balsamita aut oleum alben, aut oleum anetinum: et eis similia.	If the superfluid is thick and cold: then let the oil be bitter orange, or oil from balsamita, or oil of white lead, or oil of aneton: and similar ones.
Si uero uentosandus est amplorum pororum, tenerae carnis: tunc oportet, ut prohibeatur ab oleo, et oportet ut isti abluant loca Ventosarum earum post uentosationem cum aqua rosata, aut cum aqua frigida, aut cum aqua solatri, aut cum aqua cucurbitae, aut cum aqua portulacae: et similibus eis.	If the Veinsarum patient is of large pores and tender flesh: then it is necessary to prohibit the use of oil, and it is necessary that they wash the Veinsarum places after the Veinsarum treatment with rose water, or cold water, or sun water, or cucumber water, or purslane water: and similar ones.
Ille autem cuius sanguis est multae humiditatis, abluat uentosas cum aceto, aut cum aqua myrti, et sumach: et similibus eis.	But he whose blood is of much humidity, washes the Veinsarum places with vinegar, or with water of myrtle, and sumach: and similar ones.
Cuius autem superfluitates sunt grossae, abluat uentosas suas cum uino antiquo, aut cum aqua samsuci, aut decoctione aneti, aut camomillae: et eis similibus.	These superficial fluxes are gross, washed out with old wine, or with water of Samsuch, or with a decoction of anetum, or camomile; and similarly with similar things.
Et oportet, ut caueatur uentosatio in balneo, aut in uestigio balnei, imo oportet, ut administretur post exitum ex balneo per horam, aut per horas duas.	And it is necessary that the fomentation be made in a bath, or in the heat of a bath, or it is necessary that it be administered after coming out of the bath for an hour, or for two hours.
Et non oportet, ut dormiat aliquis post uentosationem.	And it is not suitable that someone sleeps after the fomentation.
Â¶ Quid est quo oportet ut regatur Ventosandus, aut Phlebotomatus ante uentosationem.	What is it that needs to be regulated, whether inflamed or bleeding, before fomentation?
ET post eam oportet, ut consideres in primis: tunc si Ventosatus, aut Phlebotomatus sit cholericus, et uincunt super sanguinem eius acuitas et inflammatio: tunc oportet, ut accipiat infrigidantia, sicut granatum muzum: et etiam endiuiam cum aceto et lactuca, et secaniabin, et iuleb: et eis similia.	And after that it is necessary to consider first: then if the inflamed or bleeding part is choleric, and they overcome the blood of his acute inflammation: then it is necessary to apply cooling remedies, such as a granulated mum, and also endivia with vinegar and lettuce, and secanabin, and julep: and similar things.
Et pone cibaria eius pullos, et carnes ouium sekebiget, et cibos conditos cum agresta: et eis similia.	And prepare his diet with roasted chicken, and boiled meats, and seasoned foods with herbs: and similar things.
Et cuius complexio est frigida, oportet ut sumat in potu syrupum de melle, aut de almiua, aut alsecaniabin de seminibus factum: et sumat uinum odoriferum medium, quod est inter uetus et nouum: et praecipiatur, ut utatur paucitate cibi.	And whose constitution is cold, it is necessary that he take in drink a syrup made from honey, or from almeua, or an alsecaniabin made from seeds: and he should take a medium wine, which is between old and new: and it is advised, that he use a small amount of food.
Et pone cibum eius pullos, et canebir: et passeres, id est, paruas aues: et pullos columborum issiadebet.	And prepare his food with roasted chicken, and caneberries: and small birds, that is, little birds: and also roasted doves.
Et oportet, ut potus die uentosationis et phlebotomiae plus sit quam cibus: et oportet, ut detur in potu in quibusdam hominibus in horis tyriaca alfaroch, aut medicamen de musco, id est, muscata, aut alesselithe ante uentosationem: et ante phlebotomiam, aut post: ut confortentur membra principalia, et subtilietur sanguis.	And it is necessary that the drink of fomentation and bloodletting be more than food: and it is necessary that there be given in drink to certain men in tyriaca hours Alfaroch, or medicine from musk, that is, muscat, or alesselithe before fomentation: and before bloodletting, or after: so that the principal members may be comforted, and the blood may be refined.
Et non oportet, ut sumant eam in potu calefacto.	And it is not suitable to administer it in a warm potion.
Â¶ De Ventosis sine scarificatione.	Concerning abscesses without scarification.
Uentosae autem quae sunt sine scarificatione, sunt Ventosae quae ponuntur super epar, et splenem, et podagram, et super uentrem, umbilicum, et loca renum, et pixidem anchae: quoniam ista membra non sufferunt scarificationem super se.	Abscesses, however, which are without scarification, are those that form on the chest, and spleen, and hip, and on the navel, and loins, and groin area: because these members do not tolerate scarification upon themselves.
Et non quaeritur per eas, nisi aut attactio ex membro sanguinis ad membrum: sicut ponimus Ventosam super mammillas in aegritudine fluxus sanguinis narium.	And there is no inquiry through them, unless an attraction occurs from a blood vessel to a member: just as we produce an abscess on the breasts in a disease of flux of watery blood.
Et utimur eis, ut soluamus a membro uentositatem frigidam inuiscatam in membro: sicut ponimus uentosam super uentrem, et umbilicum.	And we treat them so that we dissolve the cold, congealed abscess from the member: just as we produce an abscess on the navel and groin area.
Ipsa enim rarificat membrum, et calefacit ipsum, et remouet dolorem propterea, quia resoluit illam uentositatem.	For it rarefies the member, and warms it, and removes the pain for that reason, because it resolves that abscess.
Etiam ponitur super renes, quando accidit in eis opilatio, aut lapis.	It is also applied to the kidneys, when there occurs in them a stagnation or stone.
Uirtute enim attractionis suae fortasse aperit opilationem, aut eradicat lapidem ex loco suo.	For the power of its attraction perhaps opens up the stagnation, or eradicates the stone from its place.
Et similiter facit quando ponitur super epar, et splenem apud uentositatem terendam in eis utrisque.	And it does similarly when applied to the chest and spleen, for drawing out the abscess in both of them.
Et istae Ventosae administrantur uacuae cum sectione tantum.	And these abscesses are administered with evacuating remedies alone.
Et quandoque administrantur cum igne.	And sometimes they are administered with fire.
Et quandoque administrantur plenae aqua tepida in aegritudinibus pleuresis: et illud est, ut impleatur Ventosa, et sit magna, aqua calida sola, aut aqua in qua decoctae sint herbae quae conueniunt.	And sometimes they are administered with full warm water in painful and inflamed sides: and that is, so that the abscess may be filled, and it be large, with hot water alone, or with water in which herbs that are convenient have been decocted.
Â¶ Forma Ventosae administratae cum igne.	The form of abscesses administered with fire.
Sit amplitudo orificii eius duorum digitorum apertorum, secundum quod formauimus: et quantitas eius in profundo sit medietas palmi: et sit in latere eius in loco qui est circiter medium eius, foramen paruum, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum acus: fiat ex aere simul, aut citrino, grossorum marginum, lenium, aequalium, tersorum: ut non laedat membrum apud positionem suam super ipsum: et sit in medio eius uirga transuersa ex aere, aut ferro, ubi ponitur candela cum igne.	The width of its orifice should be two fingers open, according to what we have formed: and its quantity in depth should be half a palm: and it should be on the side, in the place that is around the middle, a small opening, according to the quantity that enters the needle: let it be made from copper simultaneously, or tin, of thick margin, smooth, equal, polished: so that it does not hurt the member at its position upon it: and let there be in its middle a transverse rod from copper, or iron, where the candle is placed with fire.
Et iam fit haec uentosa magna, maior ea quam narrauimus, et parum minor illa, secundum aegritudines et aetatem eius qui utitur.	And now this great wound is fitting, larger than we have described, and a little less than that, according to the weakness and age of the one who uses it.
Ventosae enim puerorum, et extenuatorum sunt aliae, quam uentosae uirorum, et grossorum corporum.	For there are other wound dressings for boys and for thin people, which are different from those for men and corpulent bodies.
Qualitas autem ponendi hanc uentosam cum igne super membrum, est, ut accendas licinium cum igne ex lino decenter, aut candelam paruam ex caera: et pone eam super medium uirgae transuersae quae est in medio uentosae: ut sit accensus ignis circiter inferiorem partem uentosae, ut non comburatur corpus infirmi.	The quality of applying this dressing with fire over the limb is that you should attach a linen cloth with fire to the linen thread decently, or a small candle from wax: and place it on the middle of the transverse vein which is in the middle of the wound: so that the fire may be applied around the lower part of the wound, so that the weak body does not burn.
Deinde ponatur super membrum: et digitus sit super foramen quod dixi, donec quando tenemus uentosam: dum indigemus, auferamus digitum, et egredietur uapor super illud foramen, et soluetur uentosa statim.	Then it should be placed over the limb: and a finger should be on the opening that I mentioned, until when we hold the dressing: while we are in need, we lift the finger, and the vapor goes out through that opening, and the dressing is immediately loosened.
Deinde igni licinium secundum modum suum, et itera eam, si indiges illa.	Then a linen cloth should be applied with fire according to its own method, and it should be repeated, if that is needed.
In Ventosa autem quae administratur in aegritudine pleuresis cum aqua, non est uirga transuersa, neque foramen: et non administratur, nisi quia impletur aqua, et ponitur super membrum tantum.	But in the dressing that is administered in weakness of the lungs with water, there is no transverse vein, nor an opening: and it is not administered, unless it is filled with water, and placed on the limb only.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et haec Ventosa quanto plus est magna, ut capiat aquam multam, est melior.	And this dressing, because it is larger, can hold a lot of water, is better.
Â¶ De suspensione Sanguisugarum.	Of the hanging of blood-sucking [or bleeding] cups.
Caput XCIX.	Chapter 99.
Sanguisugae non administrantur in pluribus, nisi in quibus membris non est possibilis positio uentosarum, propter paruitatem eorum, sicut labium, et gingiua, et eis similia.	Blood-sucking cups are not administered on many parts, unless on those members where it is not possible to apply wound dressings, due to their smallness, such as the lip and gums, and similar ones.
Aut in membro denudato a carne, sicut digitus, et nasus, et eis similia.	Or on a member deprived of flesh, such as a finger, and nose, and similar ones.
Et qualitas utendi eis est: ut ueneris ex Sanguisugis quae sunt in aquis dulcibus, mundis a putredinibus.	And the quality of using them is: that they should be cleaned with blood-sucking cups that are in sweet and pure waters, free from putridness.
Deinde dimittantur die et nocte in aqua dulci, donec famelicae sint, et non remaneat in uentre earum aliquid.	Then they are left in sweet water day and night until they are soft, and nothing remains in their belly.
Deinde euacuetur corpus in primis cum phlebotomia, et cum uentosis.	Then the body is evacuated first with bloodletting, and with cupping.
Deinde absterge membrum infirmi, donec rubeat.	Then the membrane of the affected part is cleared away until it becomes red.
Postea ponantur super ipsum.	Thereafter they are applied above it.
Cum ergo implentur, et cadunt, et est possibilis suctio loci cum uentosa, tunc est magis ultimum in iuuamento: et si non, tunc ablue locum cum aceto.	When therefore they are filled, and fall, and it is possible to suck the place with cupping, then it is almost the last resort in healing: and if not, then cleanse the place with vinegar.
Deinde cum aqua multa, et fricetur, et exprimatur.	Then with much water, and it is rubbed, and pressed out.
Quod si prolongatur cursus sanguinis post casum Sanguisugarum, et est illud resudando: tunc infunde pannum lini in aqua frigida, et pone ipsum desuper, donec abscindatur resudatio.	What if the flow of blood is prolonged after the fall of a bleeding vessel, and it is that which is being pushed back: then soak a linen cloth in cold water, and put it above, until the pushing back ceases.
Quod si multiplicatur sanguis, tunc pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, aut gallas, et similia eis ex stipticis: donec abscindatur sanguis.	What if the blood increases, then powder over it powdered zeolite or haematite, and similar things from astringent powders: until the blood ceases.
Aut ponantur super locum medietates fabarum excorticatarum: et dimittantur, donec adhaereant fabae in loco, nam sanguis abscinditur.	Or apply to the place half-peeled beans, and leave until they adhere to the place, for the blood ceases.
Et oportet si necessaria est iteratio Sanguisugarum, quando est possibile, mutare eas.	And it is necessary, if repetition of bleeding vessels is necessary, when it is possible, to change them.
Si autem prohibentur Sanguisugae a suspensione, tunc abstergatur locus cum sanguine recenti.	If, however, the bleeding vessels are prohibited from suspending, then the place is cleansed with fresh blood.
Aut fige acum in locis, donec egrediatur aliquid ex sanguine.	Or apply a cup to the places, until something goes out of the blood.
Deinde ponantur, nam ipsae quando sentiunt aliquid ex sanguine, adhaerent statim.	Then they are applied, for they themselves, when they feel something from the blood, adhere at once.
Quando ergo uis ut cadant, pulueriza super eas aliquid ex aloe trito, aut salem, aut cinerem: et cadent statim.	When therefore they are about to fall, powder over them something from triturated aloe, or salt, or ashes: and they fall at once.
Â¶ Partis Secundae Finis.	Â¶ End of the Second Part.
Â¶ Liber Chirurgici Albucasis Pars III.	Â¶ Book of Surgery by Albucasis, Part III.
Â¶ Sermo uniuersalis de restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus.	A general treatise on restoration and dislocation and curing of twisting and similar things.
Caput I.	Chapter 1.
Hoc Capitulum etiam multotiens est necessarium in arte Medicinae, et est restauratio fracturae, et dislocationis accidentium in ossibus.	This chapter is often necessary in the art of Medicine, and it is the restoration of fractures and dislocations that occur in bones.
Scitote o Filii, quia iactant se de hoc Capitulo stolidi medicorum et uulgi, et qui non inspexerunt unquam antiquorum librum, neque legerunt ex eo literam.	Know, O sons, that they boast of this chapter, foolish medics and the common folk, who have never looked into an ancient book, nor read a letter from it.
Et propter hanc caussam fit, quod iste modus ex scientiis in terra nostra est priuatus.	And because of this cause, it happens that this method is deprived of science in our land.
Et ego non obuiaui in eo unquam bono omnino, et non adeptus sum ex eo illud, quod sum adeptus nisi propter longitudinem lectionis librorum antiquorum, et studium super intellectum eorum, donec extraxi scientiam illius ex eis.	And I did not find any good in it at all, and I did not acquire anything from it, except because of the length of reading ancient books, and study above the understanding of them, until I extracted the science from them.
Deinde adhaesi experimento et studio longitudine uitae meae.	Then I adhered to experience and lengthy study throughout my life.
Et iam descripsi uobis ex illo in hoc Capitulo totum quod continet scientia mea: et super quod praeteriit experimentum meum, postquam abbreuiaui illud uobis, et liberaui illud ex occupatione elongationis, et abbreuiaui illud fine abbreuiationis, et ostendi illud fine declinationis: et formaui in eo formas multas ex formis instrumentorum quae administrantur in eo, cum sit ex additione declinationis, sicut feci in duobus Capitulis praecedentibus.	And now I have described to you from that in this Chapter all that contains my science: and about what has gone before my experience, since I abbreviated it for you, and freed it from the occupation of lengthiness, and abbreviated it at the end of abbreviation, and showed it at the end of declination: and I formed in it many forms out of the forms of instruments which are administered in it, with the addition of declination, just as I did in the two preceding Chapters.
Â¶ Summae, et collectiones ex esse fracturae ossium, ex eis quarum praemissio necessaria est, antequam incipiamus rememorationem membrorum fractorum, et diuersorum, si uniuscuiusque.	A summary and collections from the existence of fractures of bones, from those whose preliminary permission is necessary, before we begin the reminiscence of broken members, and diverse others, if there are any singular ones.
Caput II.	Chapter 2.
Oportet, ut dicamus in prologo huius Capituli, summas sermonis, et capitula, ad quarum intellectum cogitur in primis artifex ad stationem super earum ueritatem: scilicet ut uos, et qui sunt prompti, sciant, uel addiscant hanc artem nobilem, et alii a uobis.	It is fitting, as we say in the prologue of this Chapter, to summarize the sermon and chapters, for whose understanding the artificer is moved first to station himself over their truth: namely that you, and those who are prompt, may know or learn this noble art, and others from you.
Dico, ergo, quod quando accidit alicui fractura, aut dislocatio, aut torsio, aut casus: tunc oportet, ut properes in primis ad phlebotomandum eum, et soluendum ipsum, aut utraque simul: si non prohibeat aliquid, sicut debilitas uirtutis: aut est ille cui accidit aliquid ex illis puer, aut senex decrepitus: aut est tempus uehementis caloris, aut uehementis frigoris ualde.	I say, therefore, that when a fracture or dislocation or torsion or fall occurs, then it is necessary to bleed him first and to loosen him, or both at the same time: if nothing prevents it, such as weakness of virtue; either he to whom something happens from those, a boy or a decrepit old man; or it is a time of intense heat or intense cold.
Deinde sit contentus in cibo suo, oleribus frigidis, et carnibus auium, et haedorum: et prohibe uinum, et carnes grossas, et repleri ex cibis et omni cibo qui replet uenas sanguine.	Then he should be content with his usual food, cold drinks, and birds' meat, and game; and avoid wine, and thick flesh, and fill up on foods and all food that fills the veins with blood.
Donec quando securus sis ex apostemate calido, et non times effusionem materiei ad membrum: tunc redeat infirmus ad regimen suum primum cum quo cucurrit consuetudo eius.	Until when he is secure from the hot aposteme, and there is no flow of matter to a limb: then the weak man returns to his first regime with which his habit was accustomed.
Cum ergo incipit os fractum restaurari, tunc oportet, ut cibetur infirmus cibis nutrientibus nutrimento multo, grosso, graui, in quibus sit uiscositas: sicut cibaria facta ex tritico cocto cum aqua, et rizum, et capita, et pedes, et uentres uaccarum, et oua, et pisces recentes: et uinum grossum, et similia illis.	When therefore the fractured bone begins to be restored, then it is necessary for the weak man to be fed with nourishing foods of much nutrition, thick, heavy, in which there is richness: such as food made from toasted wheat with water, and rice, and heads, and feet, and innards of cattle, and eggs, and fresh fish: and thick wine, and similar things.
Cum hoc enim regimine fit coagulatio fracturae uelocius, et melius.	For with this regime the consolidation of the fracture happens more quickly and better.
Et scias, quod ossa fracta, quando sunt in uiris qui sunt in prima senectute, et decrepitis, non est possibile, ut continuentur et consolidentur secundum naturam suam semper, propter exiccationem membrorum eorum: et consolidantur et continuantur quae ex eis sunt in fine lenitatis, sicut ossa puerornm paruorum.	And you should know that fractured bones, when they are in people who are in old age and decrepit, it is not possible for them to be continued and consolidated according to their natural order forever, because of the dryness of their members; and they are consolidated and continued which are from them in the end of gentleness, like the bones of small children.
Verumtamen natura annectit super os fractum ex omni parte aliquid simile glutino, in quo est grossitudo, quo adhaeret et stringit ipsum, donec conglutinantur adinuicem, et ligantur adinuicem, donec uenit in fine fortitudinis et firmitudinis, sicut fuit in primis, donec non prohibet ipsum aliquid ab operationibus suis: et propter hanc caussam est necesse, ut ponas nutrimentum infirmi cibaria, in quibus sunt grauitas, et uiscositas, et grossitudo, sicut diximus.	However, nature adds to the fractured bone from all parts something similar to glue, in which there is thickness, by which it adheres and binds, until they cohere and are tied together, until they come to a state of strength and firmness, as they were at first, until nothing prevents them from their operations; and for this reason it is necessary to put nourishing food of the weak man, in which there are heaviness, richness, and thickness, as we said.
Et scias, quod fracturae species sunt diuersae, secundum diuersitatem membrorum: quoniam fractura cruris, est diuersa a fractura ossis capitis: et fractura ossis pectoris, est diuersa a fractura ossis dorsi: et similiter reliqua membra omnia diuersa existunt adinuicem: et ego ueni cum rememoratione omnis speciei fracturae expositae in Capitulo suo distinctae ab alia.	And know that the species of fractures are diverse, according to the diversity of members; because a fracture of the thigh is different from a fracture of the skull bone: and a fracture of the chest bone is different from a fracture of the back bone: and similarly all remaining members are diverse in their union: and I have come with remembrance of every species of fracture exposed in its distinct chapter, separated from others.
Et diuersificantur species fracturae ossis etiam in seipsa.	And the species of fractures of bones are also differentiated even in themselves.
Quoniam fit fractura eius arcuata, praeter quod accidant in ea astellae.	Because it happens to be an arc-shaped fracture, apart from what occurs in its ridges.
Et quandoque fit fractura eius secundum longitudinem ossis: et sunt fracturae eius satagiae, id est, astellae, et additiones procedentes, sicut sunt in calamo, cum aptatur cultello ad scribendum.	And when it happens to be a fracture along the length of the bone: and there are jagged fractures, that is, ridges, and additions proceeding, just as they are in a reed, when it is fitted with a knife for writing.
Et non procedentes: et est fractura cum uulnere et disruptione in capite: et est fractura fissura parua.	And not proceeding: and it is a fracture with a wound and disruption in the head: and it is a fracture of a small fissure.
Et omni speciei est ingenium, uel instrumentum proprium in restauratione eius, secundum quod ueniet rememoratio eius, distincta in locis suis.	And every species has its own ingenuity, or proper instrument in its restoration, according to what comes into remembrance of it, distinct in their own places.
Et ex eo quo cognoscitur fractura ossis, est tortuositas eius, et ipsius eminentia: et apparitio eius sensui, et sonitus eius quando comprimis ipsum manu tua.	And from the fact that a bone fracture is recognized, there is its tortuousness, and its own prominences: and its appearance to the sense, and its sound when you press it with your hand.
Quando ergo non est in loco tortuositas apparens, neque sonitus apud tactum tuum cum tangis os cum agitatione, neque inuenit infirmus magnum dolorem: tunc non est illic fractura, imo possibile est, ut sit tortuositas, aut fissura parua: non ergo oportet, ut moueas ipsum cum manu et compressione omnino, imo pone super ipsum ex medicinis, quarum uenit rememoratio, post momentum illud quod conuenit loco: deinde stringatur strictura subtili.	When therefore there is no apparent tortuousness in the place, nor sound upon your touch with agitation, nor does the weak one find great pain: then there is no fracture there, or it is possible that there is a tortuousness or small fissure: not therefore is it necessary to move it with hand and pressure altogether, but rather put on it from medicines, whose remembrance comes after the moment that suits the place: then let the strict structure be tightened.
Et scias, quod locus quando arcuatur, et scinditur in duo, praeter quod accidant in eo satagiae, uerumtamen remouetur omnis pars a compari sua: tunc oportet tibi, ut incipias ab hora tua ad rectificationem eius, aequando ipsum antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And know that the place when it is bent and divided into two, apart from what occurs in its ridges, but truly every part removes itself from its comparison: then it is necessary for you to begin from your hour to rectify it, making it equal before a hot aposteme occurs.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum, tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec quiescat apoestema.	If a warm aposteme happens to him, then leave it alone for some days until the aposteme subsides.
Deinde aequa ipsum secundum quemcunque modum potest ex lenitate et ingenio.	Then treat it equally according to whatever method he can from gentleness and ingenuity.
Et scias, quod restauratio eius, et ipsius aequatio, est facilior quam ossis, in quo accidunt satagiae.	And know that its restoration and its equalization are easier than those of bones, in which splinters occur.
Deinde stringe ipsum, secundum quod ueniet tibi rememoratio eius.	Then bind it, according to what seems good to you for remembering it.
Si uero in osse sunt satagiae, tunc necessaria est extensio huius membri fracti ex duabus partibus, si manus sit, aut pes: aut cum manu tua, si membrum est paruum: aut cum duobus funibus, aut cum fune et manu.	If there are splinters in the bone, then extension of this fractured member is necessary from two parts, whether it be hand or foot; or with your hand if it be a small member; or with two ropes, or with rope and hand.
Et sit positio tua qua ponis membrum super locum aequalem, secundum figuram suam naturalem, donec quando extenduntur partes membri fracti: tunc conare, ut redire facias illas additiones omni ingenio, et secundum quemcunque modum potes in locis suis: et caue secundum fortitudinem tuam, ne accidat super infirmum per operationem tuam dolor, neque laesio: et conare secundum fortitudinem tuam, ut applices unum duorum ossium cum socio suo, secundum meliores formas.	And let your position be where you place the member above an equal spot, according to its natural shape, until when the parts of the fractured member are extended: then try, that you may restore those additions with all ingenuity, and according to whatever method you can in their places: and beware according to your strength, lest pain or harm occur to the weakened part through your operation: and try according to your strength, so that you apply one of the two bones with its companion, according to better forms.
Et oportet in illa hora, ut tentes et tangas ipsum manu tua.	And it is necessary at that hour, that you touch and feel it with your hand.
Si ergo uides illic aliquid diuersum, rectifica ipsum, et aequa illud per quantitatem tuae uirtutis.	If therefore you see something different there, correct it, and equalize it according to the quantity of your virtue.
Et caue extensionem uehementem, et compressionem fortem, sicut faciunt multi stolidorum.	And beware of vigorous extension and strong compression, as many unskillful ones do.
Multotiens enim faciunt accidere per operationem illam suam apostema calidum, aut contractionem in membro: sicut iam uidimus illud ex operationibus eorum multotiens.	For they often cause a warm aposteme to occur through their operation, or a contraction in the member: as we have already seen that from their operations many times.
Deinde annecte post aequationem, et decentem operationem, et stricturam illius membri, et quietem, et tranquillitatem: et mone infirmum super ipsum.	Then connect after equalization, and perform the decent operation, and the stricture of that member, and quietness, and tranquility: and warn the weakened part about it.
Et fac ipsum cauere, ne moueat ipsum in hora suarum uigiliarum, et somni sui apud reuolutionem suam, et agitationem suam, et apud egestionem suam, et omnes motus suos ultima uirtute sua.	And make it beware, lest it move in its hour of watches, and its sleep at its revolution, and its agitation, and at its evacuation, and all its motions with its ultimate virtue.
Et ut caueat, ne sit positio membri positio cum qua sequatur dolor.	And beware lest the positioning of the member be a positioning that follows with pain.
Quod est, quia quando sentit in dispositione positionis membri dolorem, aut laesionem: tunc oportet, ut permutes ipsum ad dispositionem aliam ab illa cum qua non sentiat dolorem.	Because it is, that when he feels pain in the positioning of the member or a lesion: then it is necessary, to change it to another positioning where he does not feel pain.
Et caue cum illo, ut sit positio eius illa aequalis, recta: ut non accidat in membro tortuositas, quando restauratur.	And beware with that, so that its positioning is equal and straight: lest crookedness occurs in the member when it is restored.
Et qualitas stricturae membri fracti est, secundum quod narro.	And the quality of the stricture of the fractured member is, according to what I relate.
Scias, quod membra fracta diuersificantur in paruitate sua, et eorum magnitudine, et ipsorum forma.	You know that fractured members are differentiated in their smallness, and in their magnitude, and in their form itself.
Quae ergo ex eis sunt parua, sicut brachium, et digitus, et focile, et similia eis, tunc oportet, ut sit inuolutio panni mollis, subtilis.	Those therefore which are small among them, such as the arm, and finger, and neck, and similar things, then it is necessary that there be an involvement of soft, subtle cloth.
Quae autem ex eis sunt grossa, sicut coxa, et crus, oportet ut sit in eis inuolutio lata, dura.	Those however which are large among them, such as the hip, and leg, it is necessary that there be an involvement of broad, hard cloth.
Quoniam ligamentum latum, connectit membrum magnum, et stringit ipsum ab omni parte strictura aequali, ita quod non ingreditur ipsum macula.	Because a wide ligament connects a large member, and binds it from every part with equal stricture, so that no swelling occurs in it.
Deinde incipe post euacuationem tuam ab aequatione ponere linimentum conueniens ad illud, in stuppa leni super locum fracturae ipsius.	Then afterwards you should put a suitable linen bandage on the equalizing poultice over the place of the fracture itself.
Deinde incipe inuoluere ligamentum super locum fracturae ipsius tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod meretur membrum: et stringe manum tuam parumper cum ligamento.	Then begin to involve the ligament over the place of the fracture itself with three or four involutions, according to what the member deserves: and bind your hand firmly with the ligament for a short time.
Deinde uade cum eo ad partem superiorem a loco fracturae, et stringe minus quam fuit strictura tua, qua strinxisti locum fractum.	Then go up with it to the upper part above the place of the fracture, and bind less than was your previous stricture, where you bound the fractured place.
Deinde elonga te cum inuolutione a loco fracturae parumper, et mollifica stricturam paulatim, donec capias ex loco sano rem magnam.	Then extend yourself with the involutions at the place of the fracture for a short time, and gradually soften the stricture, until you grasp the great remedy from the healthy place.
Deinde accipe uittam aliam, et inuolue eam iterum super locum fractum inuolutionibus.	Then take another poultice, and involve it again over the fractured place with involutions.
Postea uade cum inuolutione ad partem inferiorem a fractura.	Then apply with an enveloping bandage to the lower part of the fracture.
Et sit operatio tua in strictura inuolutionis, et mollificatione eius, secundum quod diximus in inuolutione prima superiore.	And let your operation be in the tightening of the enveloping bandage and its softening, according to what we have said in the first upper enveloping bandage.
Deinde pone inter inuolutiones ex stuppa leni, aut panno, cum quo aequetur tortuositas fracturae, si est in ea tortuositas: et si non, non ponas in ea aliquid.	Then put between the enveloping bandages a piece of clean linen or cloth, which will equalize the twistedness of the fracture, if there is twistedness in it; and if not, do not put anything in it.
Deinde inuolue super ipsam uittam aliam.	Then envelop over that same withe another.
Postea aequa super has inuolutiones astellas decenter factas statim, si non est in loco inflatio, neque apostema calidum.	Then place equal stars of plaster on the enveloping bandages, made straight away, if there is not in that place an inflammation, nor a warm abscess.
Si autem in ea est inflatio, aut apostema: tunc pone super eam quod sedet illud apostema, et auferat inflationem: et dimitte eam aliquot diebus.	If there is an inflammation or abscess in it, then put on it what will soothe that abscess and reduce the inflammation; and leave it for several days.
Deinde stringe super ipsam tunc astellas.	Then bind over it then the stars of plaster.
Et sint Astellae ex medietatibus cannae latae, rasae, formatae sapienter: aut sint ex ligno unde fiunt cribra, quae fiunt ex pino, aut geraid, id est, ramis palmae, aut calingi: et sit amplitudo omnis Astellae, secundum hanc formam, et hanc eandem figuram.	And let the stars of plaster be made from broad, smooth, and skillfully prepared reeds; or let them be made from wood, where they are made into latticework, which is made from pine or cedar, that is, palm branches, or reed sticks: and let the width of all the stars of plaster be according to this form and this same shape.
Verumtamen oportet, ut Astella quae ponitur super ipsam tracturam, sit grossior et latior parumper, quam reliquae Astellae: et longitudo Astellae sit secundum quod licet membro ex magnitudine et paruitate.	However, it is necessary that the star of plaster which is placed over the tracture be slightly thicker and broader than the other stars of plaster; and the length of the star of plaster should be according to what is permitted by the size and smallness of the member.
Deinde stringe super Astellas cum uitta alia, secundum stricturam primam eandem.	Then bind over the stars of plaster with another withe, according to the first binding.
Deinde liga desuper cum filis decenter, secundum quod diximus de strictura: et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae plus: et quanto plus elongatur a fractura sit, strictura minor.	Then tie over with threads straight away, according to what we have said about the binding; and it is that your binding should be more over the place of the fracture; and however much it extends from the fracture, the binding should be less.
Et oportet, ut sint fila media in grossitudine et subtilitate, et sint ex lino molli.	And it is necessary that the threads be moderate in thickness and fineness, and be made of soft flax.
Quoniam si fila sunt grossa, sicut uidi ex operatione stolidorum ponentium fila sua ex chordis lini tortis, est error magnus: quoniam cadit strictura cum eis extra qualitatem.	Since the threads are thick, as is seen from the operation of stupid practitioners who place their own threads made of twisted flax, it is a great mistake: for the structure falls with them beyond what is proper.
Et fila subtilia iterum non conueniunt: quoniam tu non consequeris per stricturam cum eis illud quod uis.	And thin threads do not fit again, because you cannot achieve through the structure with them that which you wish.
Et non oportet, ut sit inter astellam et astellam minus quam digitus.	And it is not suitable, so that it should be less between the star-shaped (suture) and the star-shaped (suture) than a finger.
Quod si laeditur infirmus per extremitates astellarum post stricturam in locis sanis: tunc pone sub eis ex stuppa leni, aut lana carminata, donec nihil laedatur ex illo.	What if the weakened part is injured through the extremities of the star-shaped (sutures) after the structure at healthy places: then put under them a soft padding or combed wool, until nothing is injured by that.
Quando autem est fractura cum uulnere, et accidit disruptio in cute, ego ueniam cum rememoratione eius in capitulo secundum singularitatem.	When there is a fracture with an ulcer, and disruption occurs in the skin, I will discuss it with remembrance of its singularity in the second chapter.
Et scias, quod non omne membrum fractum oportet ut stringatur cum astellis a primo die.	And know that not every fractured member needs to be sutured with star-shaped (stitches) from the first day.
Quod est, quia membrum quando est magnum, non oportet ut ponas superipsum astellas, nisi post quinque dies, aut septem, aut plus, secundum securitatem tuam ab euentu apostematis calidi.	That is, because when the member is large, it is not suitable to place star-shaped (stitches) on top of it, unless after five days, or seven, or more, according to your security from the event of a warm aposteme.
Et iste est modus emplastrorum, quibus restaurabant antiqui, quae ponuntur super fracturam et dislocationem.	And this is the method of plastering, which the ancients used to restore, which are placed on top of fractures and dislocations.
Â¶ Modus Emplastri communis abbreuiati, restaurans fracturam, conueniens pluribus complexionibus, praecipue mulieribus, et pueris: quoniam est ex eo super quod non uincit calor, neque frigus.	The common method of plastering, abbreviated, restoring fractures, suitable for many complexions, especially for women and children: because it is based on that which neither heat nor cold overcomes.
Et est, ut accipias ex puluere molendini, et est medulla farinae quae pendet in parietibus molendini apud motum molae: et conficias ipsum sicut est, praeter quod cribelles ipsum cum albugine oui: et pone confectionem eius non spissam, neque subtilem.	And it is, that you take from the dust of the mill, and it is the marrow of the flour which clings to the walls of the mill at the movement of the millstone: and you mix it as it is, except that you sieve it with a thin layer of egg white: and you put its confection not thick, nor subtle.
Deinde utere eo.	Then use it.
Â¶ Modus Emplastri alius, restaurantis fracturam, et dislocationem, et torsionem.	Another method of applying a plaster for restoring a fracture, and a dislocation, and a twisting.
Recipe almess, et laudani, et acaciae, et enulae, et mugath: et suc, omnium ana Ê X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana Ê V et alethil Ê XX terantur omnia, et cribellentur, et misceantur cum aqua alethil: aut cum albugine oui, si complexio infirmi est calefacta.	Take mess, and laudanum, and acacia, and enula, and mugath; and juice, of all one X myrrh, and of aloes two V and of alethil XX, to be dissolved thoroughly, and they are strained, and mixed with water of alethil: or with albugin oil, if the injured place is warm.
Deinde utere hoc emplastro.	Then apply this plaster.
Nam ipsum est bonae compositionis, restaurat ossa fracta uelociter, et confert pluribus hominibus.	For it is of good composition, it restores a fractured bone quickly, and helps many people.
Â¶ Modus Emplastri alius, quod etiam confert fracturae et torsioni.	Another method of applying a plaster, which also helps fractures and twisting.
Recipe mugath, et mess, et alteae albae, omnium ana Ê X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana Ê V acaciae Ê VI boli armeni Ê XX terantur omnia contritione multa, et cribellentur, et conficiantur cum aqua, aut albugine oui: et administrentur.	Take mugath, and mess, and white alteae, of all one X myrrh, and of aloes two V, acacia six, and Armenian bole twenty, to be dissolved thoroughly, and they are strained, and mixed with water, or with albugin oil: and it is administered.
Â¶ Modus Emplastri ad iuncturas, et ossa separata ex locis suis: et sedat dolorem accidentem eis, et scissuram ossis, et fracturam.	Another method of applying a plaster for joining and separating bones from their proper places: and it soothes the accidental pain in them, and a split bone, and a fracture.
Sumatur lana succida, et submergatur in aceto, et oleo decocto: et ponatur super locum.	Take a woolly poultice, and dip it in vinegar, and oil decoction: and apply it to the affected area.
Et in hoc quidem Emplastro non est uirtus restaurationis, sed est bonum in sedatione apostematis calidi: et expellit dolores proprie.	And in this plaster indeed there is no virtue of restoration, but it is good for soothing a hot abscess: and it expels the proper pains.
Â¶ Modus Emplastri, quod restaurat os fractum.	Another method of applying a plaster that restores a broken bone.
Sume folia fici surdi, et folia papaueris syluestris: et tere omnia, et fac emplastrum ex utrisque.	Take leaves of fig tree, and leaves of silvan papauer: and bruise all, and make a plaster out of both.
Â¶ Modus Emplastri abbreuiati, administrati apud restaurationem fracturae ossis: et quando tu uis resolutionem residui apostematis.	Another method of applying an abbreviated plaster, administered for the restoration of a bone fracture: and when you wish to resolve the remaining abscess.
Recipe radicis alteae, et camomillae, et florum uiolarum, et farinae herbi, omnium ana partem unam: terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum uino, si non est membrum calefactum.	Take root of altea, and chamomile, and flowers of violet, and herb powder, all in one part: they are thoroughly dissolved, and mixed with wine, if the member is not warm.
Si uero est calefactum, tunc confice illud cum aqua coriandri humidi, aut cum aqua, et utere eo.	If it is inflamed, then apply that with water of coriander humidified, or with water, and use it thus.
Â¶ Modus Emplastri alius fortioris in resolutione, quam istud primum, quando accidit apostema durum apud restaurationem membri.	Another mode of plastering for a stronger resolution, which is first used when a hard aposteme occurs during the restoration of a limb.
Recipe radicis alteae, et seminis lini, et balaustiae, et melliloti, et samsuci, et floris uiolarum, et camomillae, omnium ana, partem unam, terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum aqua salicis, aut cum aqua dulci, aut cum uino.	A recipe of dock root, and flaxseed, and balsam, and honey, and marsh mallow, and violet flowers, and chamomile, all taken in equal parts, they are ground together, and mixed with water of willow, or with fresh water, or with wine.
Totum illud secundum caliditatem membri, et quietem caloris eius.	All that follows the warmth of the limb, and the stillness of its heat.
Hippocrates uero non dixit in libro suo, quod ponatur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius, nisi caerotum factum ex caera, et oleo: non aliud: et narrauit, ut sit medium inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem.	Hippocrates did not say in his book that anything should be applied to a fractured limb during its restoration, unless it is a cerate made from wax and oil; nothing else; and he narrated that it should be a medium between grossness and subtlety.
Galeno autem uisum est, ut ponantur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius res, in quibus est exiccatio caliditatis, sicut myrrha, et aloes et olibanum, et similia eis ex eis quae narrauimus.	But to Galen it seemed best that things should be applied to a fractured limb during its restoration which have an evacuation of heat, such as myrrh, and aloe, and frankincense, and similar things from those which we have narrated.
Â¶ Modus Emplastri quod confert ad laesionem et dolorem.	A mode of plastering that is suitable for a wound and pain.
Recipe mugath, et ciceris, et capillorum hominis incisorum, aut pennae auis, et alteae, et salis partes aequales: terantur, et cribellentur, et conficiantur: et fiat ex eo emplastrum.	A recipe of mugwort, and chickpeas, and hair from a man's eyebrows, or bird's feathers, and dock, in equal parts; they are ground, and sieved, and mixed together; and an plaster is made from it.
Quantitas autem secundum quam oportet, ut remaneat ligatura, deinde soluatur, est, ut consideres tunc, si non accidit infirmo dolor, neque pruritus, neque mouetur os fractum a loco suo: tunc non resoluas ipsum diebus multis.	The quantity, however, is according to what is necessary, so that the bandage remains in place, and then it is dissolved; it is, as you consider then, if there is no occurrence of weakness, nor pain, nor itching, nor movement of the broken bone from its place: then it is not resolved for many days.
Quod si accidat ei in loco pruritus uehemens, aut dolor inquietans, aut inflatio: tunc propera, et solue in hora ipsum, et aufer emplastrum ab eo: et accipe pannum lenem, aut spongiam marinam lenem, humidam: et submerge eam in aqua tepida, et ablue cum ea locum, donec quiescat pruritus, et sedetur dolor.	If there occurs to it in its place a vehement itching, or disturbing pain, or inflammation: then quickly, and dissolve it in that hour, and remove the plaster from it: and take a soft cloth, or a gentle marine sponge, moistened: and submerge it in tepid water, and wash the place with it, until the itching is quieted, and the pain is assuaged.
Deinde dimitte membrum quiescere una hora.	Then let the member rest for one hour.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam succidam, submersam in aceto et oleo, aut oleo rosato: et liga super ipsum nocte una, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido, et quiescat inflatio membri, et remoueatur dolor eius.	Then put on it a dressing of soothing lanolin, submerged in vinegar and oil, or rose oil: and bind on it at night for one day, until you are secure from the aposteme's heat, and the inflammation of the member quiets down, and its pain is removed.
Deinde itera ipsum ad stricturam subtilem, et emplastrum paruum: et non stringas ipsum constrictione tua prima, et subtilia cum eo, donec sanetur.	Then apply a subtle stricture to it, and a small plaster: and do not bind it with your first constriction, but subtly with it, until it is healed.
Quod si uides, quod apostema, et rubedo, et dolor, et inflatio, et omnia accidentia iam remota sunt penitus, et indiges emplastro et strictura, tunc itera illud sicut fecisti in primis aequaliter.	If you see that the aposteme, and redness, and pain, and inflammation, and all the accidents are now entirely removed, and you have applied the plaster and stricture, then apply it as you did at first equally.
Quod si non accidit membro aliquid ex eis quae diximus, tune non soluas ipsum, nisi post tres dies, aut quatuor, aut quinque, aut septem.	If nothing happens to the member from those things which we have spoken of, then do not release it, unless after three days, or four, or five, or seven.
Et quando que dimittitur uiginti diebus totum illud, secundum quod apparet tibi ex solutione membri, sicut diximus, donec quando adhaeret fractura, et approximat coagulatio carnis super eam: adde etiam tunc in strictura plus quam strictura tua prima tota: et adde etiam in ingrossatione cibi infirmi, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius.	And when it is released after twenty days, the whole of that, according to what appears to you from the solution of the member, as we have said, until the fracture adheres and the coagulation of flesh approaches over it: also add then in the stricture more than your first entire stricture: and also add in the thickening of food for the infirm, according to what precedes its remembrance.
Si autem uides locum fracturae iam exiccari, et extenuari plus quam oportet: tunc scias, quod nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad ipsum.	But if you see the place of the fracture is already drying out and withering more than it should: then know that nourishment is prevented from reaching it.
Embroca ergo ipsum cum aqua tepida apud omnem uicem qua soluis ipsum, et sit illud in omnibus tribus diebus, et alleuia stricturam parumper.	Bathe it therefore with warm water at every joint where you release it, and let it be so for three days, and loosen the stricture a little.
Per hanc ergo operationem currit ad membrum nutrimentum, et sanatur uelociter.	Through this operation, nourishment will flow to the member, and it will heal quickly.
Illud autem quod faciunt stolidi restauratores ex fractura membri uice alia, quando non restauratur in primis, secundum quod oportet, et restauratur secundum tortuositatem, est error ex operatione eorum, et timor magnus: et si esset rectum, dixissent illud antiqui in libris suis, et operati fuissent cum eo.	But what foolish restorers do, when they restore a fractured member at another joint, not according to what is proper, and restore it according to their own tortuous method, is an error in their operation, and great fear: and if it were right, the ancients would have written it in their books, and would have operated with it.
Et ego non uidi alicubi eorum uestigium in illo omnino, et rectius est, ut non fiat illud.	And I have not seen anyone of them who has experienced that symptom in everything, and it is better, so that it does not happen.
Â¶ De factura accidente in capite.	Concerning the accidental fracture in the head.
Caput III.	Head 3.
Species fracturae sunt diuersae, et figurae eius multae: et caussae eius sunt distinctae.	The types of fractures are diverse, and their figures are many: and their causes are distinct.
Nam ex fractura est quae fit a percussione cum ense: et percussio aufert os totum usquequo peruenit ad siphac, quod est sub osse, sicut facit axia in ligno: et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Axialis.	For there is a fracture that occurs from a blow with a weapon: and the blow affects the whole bone up to where it reaches the siphac, which is beneath the bone, just as an axis does in wood: and on account of this, this type of fracture is named Axial.
Aut ensis incidit quiddam ossis, et incidit faciem eius, et non penetrat incisio usque ad ultimum eius: et nominatur haec species fracturae Kalaan, id est, Leuatio absolute.	Or the weapon strikes something of the bone, and it strikes its surface, and the incision does not penetrate to the end of it: and this type of fracture is named Kalan, that is, Absolute Levation.
Et est uulnus duarum fracturarum, aut magnum, aut paruum.	And there is a wound of two fractures, either large or small.
Et ex fractura est, quae est contritio, aut attritio: et caussa eius est percussio cum lapide, aut casus super lapidem, aut eis similia.	And there is a fracture that is a crushing or a rubbing away: and its cause is a blow with a stone, or a fall on a stone, or similar things.
Et haec fractura est etiam aut penetrans, quae iam appropinquat panniculo, quod est sub osse: aut est in facie ossis: et est uulnus harum duarum fracturarum etiam aut paruum, aut magnum.	And this fracture is also either penetrating, which already approaches the membrane, which is beneath the bone: or it is on the surface of the bone: and there is a wound of these two fractures also, either small or large.
Et ex fractura est, quae est occulta in osse in subtilitate capilli: et est fissura parua, et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Capillaris.	And there is a fracture that is hidden in the bone in the subtlety of hair: and it is a small fissure, and on account of this, this type of fracture is named Capillary.
Et ex eis est fractura, quae fit a casu, aut percussione lapidis, et eis similium, quae faciunt ingredi laminam ossis ad interiora, et fit loco concauitas: sicut accidit caldariis aeris, quando occurrit eis percussio, et ingreditur pars eorum ad interiora.	And there is a fracture that occurs from a fall or a blow with a stone and similar things, which cause the lamina of the bone to cave in at the interior: just as it happens to the walls of an air-filled vessel, when they receive a blow, and part of them caves in at the interior.
Et plurimum quidem fit illud in capitibus humidorum ossium, sicut sunt capita puerorum.	And this indeed happens very often in the humid bones of the head, such as are the skulls of children.
Et fiunt omnibus istis speciebus fracturae satagiae separatae, et ego ueniam cum rememoratione illius totius in loco suo.	And there are separate fractures for each of these types of wounds, and I describe them with reminiscence of the entire thing in its proper place.
Et cognoscimus omnes has species fracturae per detectionem super eam, et inquisitionem earum cum tentis, et ablationem carnium corruptarum, quae sunt super eas.	And we recognize all these types of fractures through examination on them, and inquiry into them with tension, and removal of corrupted flesh that is upon them.
Species uero Capillaris cognoscitur per hoc, quod detegitur super os, et abstergitur, et linitur super ipsum cum encaustro: fractura enim apparet nigra.	The species of hairline fracture is recognized by this, that it is detected on the bone, and wiped away, and anointed over it with a hot cauterization: for the fracture appears black.
In curatione autem fracturae, considera in primis accidentia infirmi: tunc si uides ex accidentibus quod significet significatione manifesta super timorem, sicut uomitus cholerae, et extensio, et amissio intellectus, et abscisio uocis, et syncopis, et febris acuta, et egressus oculorum, et rubedo eorum, et similia eis ex accidentibus in pluribus dispositionibus, proculdubio non sanatur: et si uides accidentia non terrentia te, et speras salutem: tunc incipe curationem eius.	In the treatment of a fracture, consider first the accidents of the patient: then if you see from the accidents what is signified by manifest signs on the fear, such as vomiting of bile, and extension, and loss of intellect, and loss of voice, and fainting, and acute fever, and protrusion of the eyes, and their redness, and similar things from accidents in many dispositions, it is not doubted that they are not healthy: and if you see non-terrifying accidents, and hope for health: then begin the treatment.
Quod est, si uenit ad te uulneratus in primis cum uulneratur: et est illud in diebus hyemis, tunc oportet, ut studeas in ablatione ossis ante diem quartumdecimum secundum omnem dispositionem.	It is that, if the wounded person comes to you at first with a wound: and it is in winter days, then it is necessary that you should strive for removal of bone before the fourteenth day according to every disposition.
Et si est in diebus aestatis, tunc oportet, ut properes remouere os ante diem septimum, antequam corrumpatur quod est sub osse ex panniculo, et accidant illa accidentia quae narrauimus.	And if it is in summer days, then it is necessary that you should hasten to remove the bone before the seventh day, lest it becomes corrupted by the pus under the bone, and those accidents occur which we have narrated.
Quod si fractura ossis iam peruenit ad panniculum tangentem cerebrum, et est cum minutiis, et attractione: tunc oportet, ut incidas partem comminutam, et attritam, secundum quod narro tibi.	What if the fracture of the bone has already reached the membrane touching the brain, and it is with smallness, and attraction: then it is necessary that you should cut away the comminuted part, and the attracted one, according to what I relate to you.
Et est, ut radas caput uulnerati: et detege super os secundum quemcunque modum possibile est tibi: et secundum figuram uulneris, et quod leue est super infirmum.	And it is that you should shave the head of the wounded person: and examine on the bone in whatever possible way is possible for you: and according to the shape of the wound, and what is lightly upon the patient.
Quod si accidat tibi apud detectionem ossis fluxus sanguinis, aut apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet.	If it happens to you during the dissection of a bone flux with bloody discharge, or a warm aposteme: then apply to it what is suitable.
Et est, ut impleas locum cum pannis infusis in uino, et oleo rosato: et facias quiescere uulnus, donec sedetur apostema, et sis securus a fluxu sanguinis.	And it is, that you fill the place with cloths soaked in wine and rose oil: and let the wound rest until the aposteme settles, and you are safe from the bloody discharge.
Deinde incipe in curatione ossis, et ablatione eius.	Then begin with the treatment of the bone, and its removal.
Et illud fit secundum unum duorum modorum.	And that is done according to one of two methods.
Modus quidem unus est, ut incidas os cum Incisorio strictae aciei: et haec est forma eius.	One method indeed is, that you cut the bone with a straight edge incisor: and this is its form.
Dende administra Incisorium aliud post Incisorum latius eo parumper: et haec est forma eius.	Then administer another instrument after the incisors, broader than it for a short while: and this is its form.
Deinde administra etiam Incisorium aliud latius etiam quam secundum.	Then administer also another instrument, even broader than the second one.
Et modus secundus est, ut sit apud te numerus Incisoriorum diuersorum: quorum quaedam sint latiora quibusdam, et quaedam eorum breuiora quibusdam: et sint in ultimo acuitatis extremitatum suarum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut fuled: et utere facilitate in percussione super Incisorium, ut non concutiat caput, et laedat ipsum.	And the second method is, that you have a number of different incisors: some of which are broader than others, and some of them shorter than others: and they should be at the end sharpened to a point, and made of iron or steel: and use them with ease in percussion on the incisor, so that it does not strike the head, and hurts itself.
Si autem os est forte, durum: tunc oportet, ut perfores in circumitu eius, antequam tu administres Incisoria, cum Terebris quae nominantur Terebra non profundantia: et non nominantur ita, nisi quoniam ipsa non pertranseunt terminum ossis carnei ad illud, quod est post ipsum: propterea, quod Terebro est extremitas rotunda super illud, quod est sub capite eius acuto, similis margini, et circulus paruus prohibet submergi, et pertransire spissitudinem ossis.	But if the bone is strong and hard: then it is necessary, that you perforate around it, before you administer incisors, with boring instruments which are called non-penetrating Terebra: and they are not so named, unless because they do not transcend the boundary of the fleshy bone to that which is beyond it: for this reason, since the Terebra has a rounded extremity above what is under its sharp head, like a margin, and a small circle prevents submersion, and transgresses the density of the bone.
Et conuenit tibi, ut accipias ex istis Terebris numerum multum, quorum unumquodque conueniat quantitati spissitudinis ossis, donec praesens sit tibi omni craneo Terebrum: cuius extremitatis acutae quantitas in longitudine et breuitate sit, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis illius cranei.	And it is fitting for you to take from these Terebra a large number, each of which is suitable to the quantity of density of the bone, until there is present to you an entire set of Terebra: whose sharp extremity's quantity in length and breadth is, according to the quantity of density of that skull.
Et haec est forma trium specierum Terebrorum, uel Trepanorum.	And this is the form of three types of trephines, or of saws.
Qualitas autem perforandi in circumitu ossis fracti, est: ut ponas Terebrum super os, et reuoluas ipsum digitis tuis, donec scias, os iam penetratum esse.	The quality of perforating around the circumference of a fractured bone is as follows: you should place the trephine on the bone and turn it with your fingers until you know that the bone has been penetrated.
Deinde permuta Terebrum ad locum alium, et pone quod est inter omne foramen quantitatem grossitudinis radii, aut circiter illud.	Then move the trephine to another place, and put what is between all the holes in a quantity of the thickness of the radius or around that.
Deinde incide cum Incisoriis quod est inter omne foramen ex osse: et fac illud subtilius quam potes super illud ex fine leuitatis, sicut diximus, donec eradices os, aut manu tua, aut cum aliquo alio ex quibusdam instrumentis, quae parasti ad illud: sicut tenaliae, et forpices subtiles.	Then cut with the incisors what is between all the holes in the bone: and make it as subtle as you can above that from the line of fineness, as we have said, until you eradicate the bone, or with your hand, or with some other instrument which you have prepared for that: such as forceps, and subtle saws.
Et oportet, ut caueas omni cautela, ne tangat Terebrum, aut Incisorium aliquid ex siphac.	And it is necessary to beware with all caution, lest the trephine or incisors touch something of the vitals.
Cum ergo circumieris os perforando, et separatum fuerit a siphac, si fuerit continuum cum eo, et extraxeris ipsum, oportet ut radas, et aeques extremitatem eius quod remanet in osse cum instrumento alio simili Incisorio.	When you have circumcised the bone by perforating, and it has been separated from the vitals, if it was continuous with them, and you have extracted it, it is necessary to scrape, and equally to remove the remaining extremity of that which remains in the bone with another similar instrument like an incisor.
Verumtamen oportet, ut sit tenuis et subtilis magis aliis Incisoriis.	However, it is necessary for it to be thin and more subtle than other incisors.
Quod si remanet aliquid ex ossibus paruis, et satagiae: tunc accipe ea cum facilitate, cum eo quod est apud te ex instrumentis.	If something remains of the small bones, and fragments: then take them with ease, along with what you have among your instruments.
Deinde cura uulnus post illud cum liciniis, et unguentis quae diximus.	Then treat the wound after that with bandages, and ointments which we have mentioned.
Et modus alius operationis est facilis, prorsus longinquus a timore: quem dixit Galenus, et laudauit ipsum laude magna: et iste est sermo eius.	And another mode of operating is easy, far removed from fear: which Galen said and praised with great praise: and this is his statement.
Necese est tibi in primis, ut incipias detegere partem ossis ex loco, in quo fractura est uehementior, et manifestior: donec quando detexeris illam partem, et posueris sub eo extremitatem huius Incisorii lenticularis, cuius haec est forma.	It is necessary for you first to begin to uncover the part of the bone from the place where the fracture is most violent and most evident: until when you have uncovered that part, and placed under it the extremity of this lenticular incisor, whose shape this is.
Et pars lenticularis, lenis non incidit aliquid: et pars acuta eius in duabus lateribus eius uadens in longitudinem, sicut uides: ut sit pars lenticularis innixa ad siphac, facie eius incidente acuta in osse.	And the lens-shaped part does not cut into anything, and its pointed part on both sides of it extends in length, as you see; so that the lens-shaped part is attached to the siphach, with its pointed end meeting the bone.
Deinde percute super Incisorium a parte una cum malleo paruo, donec incidas totum os cum facilitate, sicut reuoluitur: et tu sis securus ex panniculo, quod non accidat in eo accidens, quod timeas prorsus.	Then strike above the incisor on one side with a small hammer, until you cut through the whole bone with ease, as it revolves; and you should be careful with the flap of skin, so that what happens does not happen, which you fear may occur.
Et si medicans non esset stultior hominum, et magis ignarus eius, nec esset dormiens, tunc si remaneret aliquid annexum ossi ex panniculo in quibusdam locis, incideret ipsum ab eo cum extremitate incisorii lenticularis ipsius, et liberaret ipsum ab eo cum facilitate.	And if the surgeon were not more foolish than men, and more ignorant of it, nor asleep, then if something remained attached to the bone from the skin flap in certain places, he would cut it away from there with the extremity of the lens-shaped incisor, and free it from there with ease.
Liberatur enim ab eo sine nocumento, et absque timore.	It is freed from there without harm, and without fear.
Et si fractura ossis non penetret usque ad panniculum, et illud quod abscinditur ab osse est facies eius, et remanent in ipso asperitas et satagiae subtiles: tunc oportet, ut radas illam asperitatem, et eradices illas satagias cum rasoriis subtilibus ex quibus praeparasti numerum diuersarum quantitatum, ut sit tibi possibile administrare ex eis in omni loco conuenientiora eorum, et rectiora ipsorum, secundum illud ad quod perducit te operatio, et ipsum os fractum, et figura eius.	And if the fracture of the bone does not penetrate to the skin flap, and that which is cut away from the bone is its surface, and roughness and subtle ridges remain in it: then it is necessary, so that you scrape off that roughness, and erase those ridges with subtle rasps which you have prepared in a diverse quantity of measures, so that it may be possible for you to administer from them in every place more convenient and more correct ones, according to what the operation leads you to, and the fractured bone itself, and its shape.
Et oportet, ut administres in rasione tua, qua in primis radis os, latius illorum rasoriorum.	And it is necessary, that you administer in your scraping, where first you scrape the bone, more broadly with those rasps.
Deinde utere post ipsum subtiliore eo.	Then use afterwards a more subtle one.
Et non cesses facere illud secundum continuitatem, donec peruenias ad administrandum tenuius, et subtilius eorum omnium.	And do not cease to do that according to continuity, until you arrive at administering the most subtle and finest of all.
In unaquaque autem fissurarum reliquarum paruarum capillarium, et fractura subtili, oportet ut administres curam, secundum illud quod perducit ad rectificationem eius.	In every small remaining crack or fine hairline fracture, it is necessary to administer care, according to what leads to its correction.
Et est res quae non occultatur super omnem, cui in hac arte est quodlibet studium, et stetit super illud quod scripsimus, et ostendimus in fracturis magnis.	And it is a thing which is not hidden from everyone, to whom in this art there is whatever study, and stands over that which we have written, and we have shown in great fractures.
Si autem panniculus detectus retinetur, quando tu eradicas os: tunc oportet, ut accipias pannum lini, secundum quantitatem uulneris, et submerge ipsum in oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super orificium uulneris.	If however the little skin flap is detected and retained, when you excavate the bone: then it is necessary, that you take a linen cloth, according to the quantity of the wound, and submerge it in rose oil, and put it over the opening of the wound.
Deinde accipe pannum alium duplicatum, aut triplicatum, et submerge ipsum in uino et oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super pannum primum: et fac illud quam facilius potes super illud, ut non grauetur siphac.	Then take another cloth, doubled or tripled, and submerge it in wine and rose oil, and put it over the first cloth: and do that which you can most easily over that, so that it does not become inflamed.
Deinde administra supra ipsum ligamentum latum: et non stringas ipsum, nisi per quantitatem quae teneat uulnus tantum: et dimitte ipsum cum hac cura die uno, aut diebus duobus, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido.	Then apply a wide bandage over it: and do not bind it tightly, unless by the amount that holds the wound together only: and leave it with this care for one day, or two days, until you are secure from a hot aposteme.
Deinde solue ipsum, et administra post illud medicinas cum quibus est superflua siccitas: sicut radices lilii, et farina herbi, et puluis thuris, et aristolochia, et similia eis: et est, ut facias ex istis medicinis puluerem, qui puluerizetur super uulnus sicut sunt siccae.	Then loosen it, and apply afterwards medicines with which there is excessive dryness: such as lily roots, and herb flour, and powder of frankincense, and aristolochia, and similar things: and it is, that you make from these medicines a powder, which is powdered over the wound as they are dry.
Et uniuersaliter administra in illo omnem medicinam de proprietate cuius est ut abstergat, et non mordicet.	And universally apply to it all medicine of the property that it is to clean and not to bite.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, ut uulnus in curatione tua sit limpidum: neque sit in ea sordes unguenti, neque sordicies.	And take care according to your skill, that the wound in your treatment is clear: neither should there be filth of ointment, nor dirtiness.
Neque dimittas uirus aggregari in eo omnino: quoniam quando uirus aggregatur super panniculum cerebri, corrumpit eum, et putrefacit ipsum, et accidit super infirmum post illud malicia magna: et iam accidit in siphac capitis, cum mundificatur ab eo os, praecipue quando negligitur cura eius, nigredo in superficie eius.	Nor should you allow pus to gather in it at all: because when pus gathers over the brain's little skin flap, it corrupts it, and putrefies it, and great evil happens to the sick person after that: and now it happens in the siphac of the head, when the bone is purified from it, especially when its treatment is neglected, blackness appears on its surface.
Considera ergo tunc, si accidunt infirmo accidentia quae diximus, scias, quia est pernitiosum proculdubio.	Consider therefore then, if accidents befall a weak patient which we have mentioned, you should know that it is perilous to procrastinate.
Et si nigredo non accidit, nisi a medicina quae ponitur super ipsum, et est in uirtute illius medicinae, ut faciat illam nigredinem: tunc oportet, ut accipias ex melle partem unam, ex oleo rosato partes tres, et linias cum eis pannum.	And if blackness does not occur, unless from the medicine that is applied to it, and it is in the virtue of that medicine, so as to produce that blackness: then it is necessary to take one part from honey, three parts from rose oil, and a bandage with them.
Deinde pone ipsum super siphac: postea cura ipsum cum speciebus curationis quae conueniunt, donec sanetur.	Then put it on the wound; afterwards treat it with the methods of healing that are suitable, until it is healed.
Â¶ De restauratione Nasi quando frangitur.	On the restoration of the nose when it is fractured.
Caput IIII.	Chapter 4.
Scias, quod non franguntur ex Naso nisi duae partes eius superiores simul, aut una earum: propterea, quod ipse sunt duo ossa: quoniam inferius eius est cartilaginosum, non frangitur, et non accidit ei nisi attritio, et tortuositas, et simitas.	You should know that the nose is not fractured except for its two upper parts together, or one of them: because they are two bones; since its lower part is cartilaginous, it is not fractured, and it does not happen to it except for bruising, twisting, and similarity.
Si frangitur una duarum partium eius, tunc oportet, ut intromittas digitum paruum in foramen Nasi, et aeques illam fracturam digito tuo indice, et pollice deforis, donec redeat Nasus super figuram suam naturalem: et fiat illud arte, cum facilitate.	If one of its two parts is fractured, then it is necessary to introduce a small finger into the nostril and gently adjust that fracture with your index finger and thumb, until the nose returns to its natural shape; and this should be done with skill and ease.
Et caue, ne accidat per operationem tuam illam super infirmum dolor.	And take care, lest you cause that weak part to become painful through your operation.
Quod si fractura est in superiore parte Nasi, et non perueniat ad illam digitus: tunc oportet, ut aequetur extremitate radii, in quo sit grossitudo parua.	If the fracture is in the upper part of the nose and does not reach to the finger: then it is necessary to adjust the extremity of a rod, on which there is a small thickness.
Si uero fractura est in duabus partibus, tunc fac simile illius: et propera cum restauratione eius in die primo fracturae, si est possibile.	If the fracture is in two parts, then do similarly; and take care to restore it on the first day of the fracture, if possible.
Et si non, tunc post diem septimum, aut decimum apud quietem apostematis calidi.	And if not, then after the seventh or tenth day, at a time of quiet and calm application of warm poultices.
Deinde intromitte in extremitate Nasi licinium ex panno lini, si fractura est in parte una: aut intromite duo licinia si fractura est in duabus partibus: et sit in licinio grossitudo tantae quantitatis, quae impleat foramen Nasi.	Then introduce into the extremity of the nose a thread made from a linen cloth, if the fracture is in one part; or introduce two threads if the fracture is in two parts: and let there be in the thread a thickness of such quantity as fills the nostril.
Et dixerunt quidam antiquorum restauratorum, ut infundantur licinia in butyro, et permutentur omni die.	And some of the ancient restorers said that they should be poured into a mixture of butter, and that they should be changed every day.
Illud uero non uidetur mihi, imo oportet, ut infundatur licinium in albugine oui, confecto cum puluere molendini.	That is not seen by me, but rather it is fitting that the mixture should be poured into a concoction of egg whites, mixed with powder of millet.
Deinde dimitte licinium, donec firmetur os, et induretur cartilago.	Then let the mixture set until the bone is strengthened and the cartilage is hardened.
Et quandoque intromittitur in Nasum loco licinii penna anseris, postquam inuoluitur super ipsam pannus lenis: et fit, quod ipsa tenet fracturam Nasi uehementius, et ut non prohibeatur infirmus ab inspiratione.	And when the mixture is inserted into the nose in place of the mixture, a soft cloth is wrapped over it: and it is done so that it holds the fracture of the nose strongly, and so that it does not prevent the injured person from breathing.
Et non est haec res necessaria.	And this is not a necessary thing.
Si uis, fac illud: et si uis, fac licinia.	If you want, do that; and if you want, make a mixture.
Quod si accidat Naso iterum dum operaris apostema calidum, emplastra nasum cum caeroto, aut cum coto infuso in oleo rosato, aut modico ex dyaquilon.	What if the nose becomes infected again while you are operating with a hot apostemum, apply to the nose a plaster made with rose oil, or with oil infused into rose petals, or a moderate amount of dyachelon.
Si autem non accidit apostema calidum, tunc oportet, ut emplastres ipsum cum farina sisami, et puluere thuris confecti cum albugine oui.	But if the hot apostemum does not occur, then it is fitting to apply a plaster made with flour of barley, and powder of frankincense mixed with egg whites.
Deinde pone super ipsum stuppam lenem, et non liges Nasum cum aliquo omnino.	Then put a soft padding over it, and do not bind the nose with anything at all.
Si uero franguntur ossa Nasi fractura parua, aut comminuuntur, tunc oportet, ut scindas super ea, et extrahas ipsa cum instrumentis quae conueniunt eis.	If the bones of the nose are broken into small fragments, or are shattered, then it is fitting to separate them above, and to extract them with instruments that are suitable for this.
Deinde sue scissuram, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat, et consolidat ex emplastris conuenientibus ad illud, uel unguentis.	Then sew up the wound, and care for it with that which brings flesh together, and consolidate it with suitable plasters or ointments.
Quod si accidat inter Nasum uulnus, tunc oportet, ut cures ipsum cum liciniis: et administres cannulam de plumbo, donec sanetur.	What if a wound occurs within the nose, then it is fitting to treat it with mixtures; and administer a pipe of lead, until it is healed.
Â¶ De restauratione Mandibulae inferioris, quando disrumpitur.	On the restoration of the lower jaw, when it is dislocated.
Caput V.	Chapter 5.
Quando disrumpitur Mandibula inferior, et fractura eius non est cum uulnere: conspice tunc si est fractura eius deforis tantum, et non frangitur in duo, et curuatur ad interiora: tunc cognitio eius est facilis.	When the lower jawbone is dislocated and its fracture does not occur with a wound, observe then if its fracture is only external, and it is not broken into two pieces, and it curves inward; then its recognition is easy.
Oportet ergo, si est fractura eius in parte dextra, ut intromittas digitum indicem sinistrae in os infirmi: similiter si fractura est in mandibula sinistra, tunc intromitte indicem manus dextrae: et impelle cum eo gibbositatem fracturae deintus cum facilitate ad exteriora cum manu tua altera ab interiori parte ossis decenter, et cum eo aequa ipsam.	Therefore, if the fracture is on the right side, you should insert the index finger of your left hand into the mouth of the injured person; likewise, if the fracture is on the left jawbone, then insert the index finger of your right hand. And push with it the prominence of the fracture inward with ease towards the outside, while guiding it with your other hand from the inside of the bone, and adjust it accordingly.
Quod si fractura mandibulae iam separata est in duo, tunc oportet, ut administres extersionem a duabus partibus, secundum rectitudinem: donec possibilis sit aequatio eius.	If the fracture of the jawbone is already separated into two pieces, then it is necessary to apply extension from both parts, according to straightness, until its adjustment becomes possible.
Si autem iam accidit in dentibus commotio, aut disruptio: tunc stringe illos de quibus speras quod remaneant cum filo auri, aut argenti, aut seta.	If, however, a concussion or disruption has occurred in the teeth, then bind them together with a thread of gold, or silver, or silk.
Deinde pone super mandibulam fractam caerotum.	Then put a compress over the fractured jawbone.
Deinde pone super ipsum pannum duplicatum, et pone super pannum astellam magnam decenter factam: aut frustum cutis soleae aequale, in longitudinem mandibulae.	Then put over it a double layer of cloth, and place over the cloth a large star-shaped bandage made from the center, or a piece of sole leather equal in length to the jawbone.
Deinde liga ipsum desuper, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ligatura eius, et conuenit ipsius applicatio, donec non destruitur: et praecipe infirmo, uti tranquillitate et quiete: et pone cibum eius sorbitiones lenes.	Then bind it above, according to the preparation you have made for its binding, and apply it in a way that is suitable for it, until it does not become dislocated. And advise the patient to keep stillness and quiet; and give them gentle, easily digestible food.
Si autem estimas, quod iam alteratur aliquid figurae aliquo modorum: tunc propera, et solue ipsum in die tertio.	If you think that something has already changed in some way of shape or form, then take care and loosen it on the third day.
Deinde rectifica quod alteratum est ex eo, et emplastra ipsum ex puluere molendini, cum albugine oui, aut cum farina sisami, postquam tu abstuleris caerotum: et pone super emplastrum lanam lenem.	Then correct what has been altered from it, and apply a plaster made of mill dust, with egg white, or with sesame flour, after you have removed the compress; and put a soft woollen cloth over the plaster.
Dum ergo permanet annexum illud emplastrum super ipsum, et non alteratur ossis dispositio, dimitte ipsum, ne soluas, donec sanetur: aut stringe fracturam.	So while that plaster remains applied over it, and the arrangement of the bones is not altered, leave it, lest it becomes dislocated, until it heals; or bind up the fracture.
Multotiens enim stringitur haec fractura in tribus septimanis.	For this fracture is often bound up for seven days.
Quod si interim accidat apostema calidum, tunc administra illud quod diximus multotiens in sedatione eius, donec remoueatur illud apostema.	What if during that time a hot abscess occurs, then administer what we have said many times in its treatment, until that abscess is removed.
Et si fractura est cum uulnere, considera.	And if the fracture is with an ulcer, consider.
Namsi iam separatur ex osse frustum, aut a satagie: tunc subtilia te in hoc, ut auferas illa frusta satagiae cum eo quod conuenit tibi in ablatione eorum ex instrumentis.	For now the fragment is separated from the bone, or from a splinter; then be subtle in this, so that you may remove those fragments of the splinter with what is convenient to you in their removal by instruments.
Si uero orificium uulneris est strictum, tunc amplifica ipsum cum phlebotomo secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	If indeed the orifice of the wound is constricted, then enlarge it with a scalpel according to the quantity of your necessity.
Deinde quando abstuleris illa satagie, et non remanserit ex eis aliquid, sue tunc orificium uulneris, si est amplum: et si non, pone super ipsum ex emplastris quae conueniunt ad illud, et incarnant illud, donec sanetur.	Then when you have removed the splinters, and nothing remains of them, then the orifice of the wound, if it is large: and if not, put over it from plasters that are suitable for it, and they will heal it, until it heals.
Â¶ De restauratione Furculae, quando frangitur.	On the restoration of the Cranium, when it is fractured.
Caput VI.	Head 6.
Plurimum quidem frangitur Furcula ab anteriore parte ex parte humeri, et fractura eius fit secundum unum trium modorum.	The Cranium is indeed most often fractured from the front part near the shoulder, and its fracture occurs in one of three ways.
Aut enim frangitur et separatur in duo, praeter quod accidant in ea satagiae: et est facilius ad restaurationem eius.	Or it is fractured and separated into two, apart from what happens in those splinters: and it is easier to restore it.
Aut ita, quod accidunt in osse satagiae: et est difficilius ad restaurationem.	Or thus, which happens in the bony splinters: and it is more difficult to restore.
Aut ita, quod est fractura cum uulnere.	Or thus, which is a fracture with an ulcer.
Et operatio in ea quando fractura est absque uulnere, est, ut facias praesentes esse duos ministros, ut teneat unus eorum adiutorium quod sequitur Furculam fractam, et alter extendat collum uersus partem.	And the operation in this case when the fracture is without an ulcer is to have two assistants present, so that one of them holds the instrument that follows the fractured Cranium, and the other stretches out his neck towards that part.
Deinde aequa fracturam digitis tuis, donec fiat forma eius, secundum quod oportet: et non sit in ea eminentia, neque concauitas.	Then make an equal fracture of your fingers, so that its shape may be according to what is needed, and there should not be any prominence in it, nor concavity.
Quod si indiges extensione plus, tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico infirmi spheram ex panno, aut lana: et sit magnitudo eius secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae: et extende, et eleua Furculam, et coarta spheram manu tua, donec aeques fracturam, secundum quod oportet.	What if you need more extension, then it is necessary to place a small sphere under the cloth or wool: and its size should be according to your necessity: and extend, and elevate the forearm, and bind the sphere with your hand, until an equal fracture, according to what is needed.
Quod si non potes trahere extremitatem Furculae ad exteriora: propterea, quia peruenit ad profundum: tunc oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et ponas sub humero eius puluinar medium in magnitudine, et premat minister humerum eius ad inferiora, donec eleuetur os Furculae quod est in profundo ad sursum: atque tunc rectifica fracturam, et aequa eam digitis tuis.	What if you cannot draw out the forearm to the exterior: because it has penetrated deeply: then it is necessary that the weak one be raised above his cervix: and place a medium-sized cushion under his shoulder, and press his ministering arm downwards, until the bone of the forearm which is deep down is elevated upwards: and then rectify the fracture, and make it equal with your fingers.
Si autem sentis sathaiatum ex Furcula, et mouetur: tunc oportet, ut findas super illud, et extrahas ipsum alsathaiatum cum facilitate.	If you feel a splinter from the forearm and it moves: then it is necessary to bind above that, and extract the same splinter with ease.
Si autem est retentum in osse, tunc ingenia in incisione eius cum uno Incisoriorum quae praeparasti ad illud, postquam tu posueris sub Furcula instrumentum quod seruat sifach: et est instrumentum ex ligno, aut ex ferro.	If it is held fast in the bone, then make an incision with one of the prepared Incisors, after you have placed under the forearm an instrument that holds a splint: and the instrument is made of wood or iron.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its shape.
Assimilatur cochleari cui non est concauitas.	It is assimilated to a spoon which has no concavity.
Et sit latitudo eius secundum illud quo indiges eo ex magnitudine ossis, et paruitate eius.	And its width should be according to what you need for it, from the size of the bone and its smallness.
Longitudo uero eius etiam secundum quod possibile est tibi ad operationem.	Its length also is according to what is possible for you in the operation.
Et habeat duas extremitates, sicut uides: et extremitas una sit ampla, et altera stricta.	And it should have two extremities, as you see: and one extremity should be wide, and the other narrow.
Si autem disruptio uulneris quod scidisti quando extraxisti sathaiatum ossis, est ampla, et securaris ab apostemate calido: tunc aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura.	If the disruption of the wound that you made when you extracted the splinter from the bone is wide, and it is septic with a hot aposteme: then bring together the two lips of the wound with a suture.
Et si disruptio est parua, aut times apostema calidum: tunc imple uulnus cum pannis, et puluillis secundum quantitatem scissurae uulneris.	And if the disruption is small, or a warm apostemation: then fill the wound with cloths, and apply poultices according to the quantity of the wound's separation.
Quod si accidat apostema calidum, tunc infunde pannum in oleo rosato, et aceto, et uino, et pone super ipsum.	What if a warm apostemation occurs, then soak a cloth in rose oil, and vinegar, and wine, and put it on top.
Strictura uero ossis quando est absque uulnere, et absque sectione, est, ut ponas super os emplastrum factum ex farina molendini cum albugine oui.	A stiffness of the bone occurs when there is no wound and no cutting, it is in order to apply a plaster made from mill flour with egg white over the bone.
Et pone stuppam lenem super ipsum.	And put a soft cushion on top of it.
Deinde pone spheram sub titillico eius, si indiges illa.	Then put a bandage under the lid of it, if it is inflamed.
Deinde accipe himematem, id est, rotam quam tenent Saraceni, quae sit longa ualde: et sit latitudo eius palmi unius, aut circiter illud.	Then take a bandage, that is, a strap which the Saracens hold, which should be quite long: and its width should be one palm or about that.
Deinde pone puluillum duplicatum super stuppam et emplastrum.	Then put a double poultice over the cushion and plaster.
Deinde accipe astellam ex tabula subtili, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, et in longitudine similiter.	Then take a splint from a subtle table, whose width is three fingers, and similarly in length.
Deinde inuolue eam in panno.	Then wrap it in a cloth.
Deinde inuolue pannum illum cum astella in loco alhimemati qui cadit super fracturam et locum.	Then wrap the cloth with the splint in place of the bandage which falls on the fracture and site.
Deinde pone alhimemati super fracturam sicut reuoluiur, et inuolue eam super collum eius, et sub titillico eius sano, et sub titillico eius infirmo: et reduc eam super omnem partem, et quomodo uides quod strictura tenet fracturam strictura decenti: et est illud, quod non occultatur super te, et totum, ut non remoueatur astella desuper os fractum.	Then put the bandage on the fracture as it is revolved, and wrap it around the neck of the bone, and under the healthy lid, and under the diseased lid: and reduce it over every part, and as you see that the stiffness holds the fracture in a decent arrangement: and this is what is not concealed from you, and the whole, so that the splint does not move away from the broken bone.
Et propter hoc oportet, ut aspicias infirmum in omni die.	And for this reason it is necessary to examine the diseased part every day.
Quotiens ergo mollificatur ligamentum, et uides astellam iam remoueri: tunc rectifica illud, et stringe ligamentum.	As often as the ligament becomes soft, and you see the splint is already being removed: then straighten it, and tighten the ligament.
Deinde pone somnum infirmi super dorsum eius, et pone sub titillico eius apud somnum eius puluinar paruum in nocte, ut cum eo eleuetur adiutorium eius a latere ipsius.	Then put the sleep of the diseased part on its back, and put under its lid at night a small pillow near its sleep, so that with it there may be raised an aid to its side.
Eleuatur ergo fractura furculae per eleuationem humeri.	Therefore, a fracture is treated through elevation of the shoulder blade.
Aut liga brachium eius ad collum ipsius: et non soluas ligamentum, si non accidat in loco accidens ex pruritu, aut ab apostemate, usque ad duodecim dies.	Or tie his arm to his neck: and do not loosen the bandage, unless it becomes inflamed at the site of the injury, or from an abscess, until twelve days.
Deinde renoua emplastrum, si uideris faciem eius ad illud.	Then renew the plaster, if you see his face is turning towards that.
Et adde in strictura, et dimitte ipsum, donec restauretur et coaguletur.	And add to the bandage, and leave it, until it is restored and congealed.
Et fractura quidem furculae stringitur et confortatur secundum plurimum in uigintiocto diebus: et quandoque fit in quibusdam hominibus in minore illo.	And indeed a fracture of the shoulder blade is strengthened and comforted according to the greatest part in twenty-eight days: and sometimes it happens in certain people in less than that.
Â¶ De restauratione fracturae Spatulae.	On the restoration of a fractured shoulder blade.
Caput VII.	Chapter 7.
Raro frangitur Spatula, et in loco lato eius: et non franguntur ex ea nisi margines eius.	A shoulder blade is rarely fractured, and at its broad part: and they are not fractured except for their edges.
Quando ergo frangitur ex eo locus, et frangitur in medio eius, et non cognoscitur illud nisi per tactum: tunc secundum quod est figura fracturae conare praeparationem eius.	When therefore it is fractured at that place, and it is fractured in the middle of it, and it is not recognized except by touch: then according to the shape of the fracture prepare its treatment.
Et reduc eam super figuram naturalem omni modo ingenii, quod est tibi possibile.	And reduce it to its natural shape in every way of ingenious skill, as is possible for you.
Deinde pone super locum puluerem molendini cum albugine oui, et stuppam lenem, et pone desuper puluillum ex panno duplato.	Then put on the place a powder of millstone with egg whites, and a soft padding, and put above it a small pillow from folded cloth.
Deinde pone super ipsum astellam latam ex tabula subtili secundum quantitatem Spatulae totius, aut ampliorem ea parum.	Then put on it a flat plate of thin wood according to the size of the entire shoulder blade, or slightly larger than it.
Si uero sub astella est concauitas in aliquo locorum Spatulae, tunc aequa illam concauitatem cum stuppa leni, donec descendat astella secundum aequalitatem.	If indeed it is concave under the plate at some place of the shoulder blade, then equalize that concavity with soft padding, until the plate descends according to equality.
Deinde ftringe desuper cum alhimemati longa, constrictione decenti, et firmitudine astellae, donec non remoueatur a loco suo.	Then bind above with a long bandage, with decent constriction and firmness of the plate, until it is not dislocated from its place.
Et considera ligamentum in omni die.	And consider the bandage every day.
Quotienscunque ergo mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum, et aequa astellam si remoueatur a loco suo: et iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	As often as the bandage becomes softened, bind it again, and equalize the plate if it is dislocated from its place: and let the injured person lie on his healthy side.
Et Spatula quidem restauratur in uiginti diebus, aut in uigintiquinque diebus.	And the spatula is indeed restored within twenty days, or within twenty-five days.
Quando ergo completur iste numerus, tunc solue ligamentum: et tu sis in securitate.	When therefore this number is complete, then loosen the ligature: and you will be in safety.
Nam ipsa est ex ossibus quorum communitio non timetur, neque eorum solutio.	For it is from bones whose union is not feared, nor their separation.
Si autem procedat ex osse frustum, et pungit sub cute: tune scinde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum.	If however a fragment proceeds from the bone, and becomes inflamed under the skin: then split above it, and remove it.
Et fac quod diximus in fractura furculae ex sedatione apostematis calidi, si accidat ex eo aliquid.	And do what we said about the fracture of the ankle joint from the application of a warm poultice, if something happens to it.
Â¶ De restauratione fracturae Pectoris.	On the restoration of a fracture of the chest.
Caput VIII.	Chapter 8.
Pectus quandoque frangitur in medio sui, et raro accidit illud.	The breastbone when it is fractured in its middle, and that rarely happens.
Extremitates eius quidem plurimum franguntur, et comminuuntur ex accidentibus eius.	Its extremities are indeed often fractured, and are dislocated from its accidents.
Quando frangitur eius medium, quod declinat ad inferiora, et accidit ei dolor uehemens, et difficultas in anhelitu, et tussis: et fortasse euomit sanguinem, et declaratur concauitas in osse fracto, et non occultatur sensui, Restauratio eius est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et pone inter Spatulas eius puluinar.	When its middle is fractured, which declines to the lower parts, and there happens to it severe pain, and difficulty in breathing, and coughing: and perhaps it vomits blood, and a cavity is declared in the broken bone, and it is not hidden from the senses. The restoration of it is, that the weakened person should be raised on their back: and put between the spatulas of its pillow.
Deinde preme humeros eius, et aggrega costas a duabus partibus uel lateribus cum manibus: et subtiliare in aequatione eius, secundum omnem modum quo possibile est illud et conuenit, donec redeat figura ossis, secundum quod oportet.	Then press his shoulders, and gather the ribs from both sides or flanks with your hands: and adjust them in their equality, according to every method by which it is possible and convenient, until the shape of the bone returns, according to what is fitting.
Deinde pone super ipsum emplastrum et stuppam, et pone desuper astellam ex tabula subtili ex salice, aut chalingi, et ex eis similibus in leuitate, postquam tu inuoluis eam in panno.	Then put on it a plaster and padding, and put above it a small plate from a smooth board of willow or hazel, and from similar things in lightness, after you have wrapped it in cloth.
Deinde subtiliare in ligando eam super os fractum, ut non remoueatur: et uade cum ligatura secundum rotunditatem ad dorsum aliquotiens, et stringe ipsum strictura decenti.	Then adjust by binding it above the broken bone, so that it is not dislocated: and be careful with the binding according to the roundness of the back several times, and tighten it with a suitable compression.
Deinde considera ligaturam in omni hora, et quotienscumque mollificatur, stringe eam: et si necessitas eius prouocat ad solutionem eius apud pruritum, uel corrosionem quae accidit in loco, aut dolorem, aut apostema: tunc propera, et solue eam, et eradica emplastrum, et rectifica quod accidit cum modo curationis eius.	Then consider the ligature at every hour, and whenever it becomes soft, tighten it: and if its necessity calls for solution to the itching, or corrosion that occurs in the place, or pain, or aposteme: then prepare, and dissolve it, and remove the plaster, and rectify what happens with the method of its cure.
Deinde reduc emplastrum, si uides ad illud faciem: et annecte ei stricturam, donec sanetur.	Then reduce the plaster, if you see it is going towards that appearance: and apply a stricter bandage to it, until it heals.
Â¶ De restauratione Costarum, quando franguntur.	On the restoration of ribs, when they are fractured.
Caput IX.	Chapter 9.
Scias, quod Costarum fractura non accidit, nisi in locis grossis quae sequuntur dorsum, et ex extremitatibus earum ab anteriori parte.	You should know that a fracture of the ribs does not occur unless in thick places that follow the back, and extend from their extremities towards the front.
Et non accidit eis attritio, nisi propterea, quia sunt cartilaginosae.	And it does not happen to them by attrition, unless because they are cartilaginous.
Et cognitio ipsius non occultatur sensui apud inquisitionem cum digitis.	And the knowledge of it is not hidden from the sense during the examination with the fingers.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, ut aeques fracturam cum digitis secundum modum possibilem, donec aequetur figura, secundum quod oportet.	And its restoration is done in such a way that you equalize the fracture with your fingers according to the possible method, until it assumes its shape, according to what is necessary.
Deinde emplastra, et stringe os fractum cum astella, si indiget illo.	Then apply a plaster, and tie the fractured bone with a splint, if it needs it.
Et si fractura Costarum est decliuis ad interiora: tunc accidit infirmo dolor uehemens, et punctura, sicut punctura illa quae accidit illi qui habet pleuresim: propterea, quod os pungit uelamen, et etiam ei accidit difficultas anhelitus, et tussis, et uomitus sanguinis multi: et haec est difficilis curationis.	And if the fracture of the ribs is inclined towards the interior: then it happens that a severe and vehement pain occurs, and punctures, like the puncture that happens to one who has pleurisy: therefore, because the bone is severely painful, and also difficulty in breathing, and coughing, and vomiting of much blood occurs: and this is a difficult cure.
Et iam ingeniati sunt antiqui in ea cum ingeniis multis: et ex eis sunt qui dicunt, ut ponas cibos infirmi qui generent inflammationem et uentositatem, ut inflammetur uenter, et extendatur, et impellatur fractura ad exteriora.	And now the ancients have been ingenious in this matter with many ingenuities: and among them are those who say that you should apply foods to the injured person that generate inflammation and flatulence, so that the belly becomes inflamed, and swells, and pushes the fracture outward.
Nos uero abhorremus, ut non fiat caussa uelox ad faciendum apostema calidum, si non accidit.	We, however, reject this, so that it does not become a cause of a bad abscess, if it should happen.
Si autem iam accidit, tunc addit in eo.	If it has already happened, then he should add it there.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: ponatur super locum uentosa, deinde sugatur cum fortitudine, et est similius ratiocinationi.	And some of them said: let it be placed on the windy spot, then let it be sucked with force, and it is more like a rational consideration.
Verumtamen timetur, quod attrahat uentosa superfluitates ad locum, propter dispositionem debilitatis.	However, it is feared that the windy spot attracts superfluities to the location, due to the disposition of weakness.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: oportet ut cooperiatur locus cum lana quae iam submersa est in oleo calido: et ponantur puluilli inter Costas, donec impleatur: ut sit ligatura aequalis quando inuoluis eam secundum rotunditatem.	And some of them said: it is necessary that the place be covered with wool that has already been soaked in hot oil: and let poultices be placed between the ribs, until it becomes full: so that there may be an equal binding when you bind it according to its roundness.
Deinde curetur infirmus curatione pleuresis ex cibo et medicina.	Then the weakened patient should be treated with a treatment of blisters, derived from food and medicine.
Quod si coartat infirmum res uehemens, quam non tolerat, et os pungit uelamen punctura laedente, et timemus super infirmum: tunc oportet, ut scindamus super locum, et detegamus a Costa fracta.	Because if it constricts the weakened part severely, which it cannot tolerate, and the bone is painful from a piercing wound, and we fear for the weakened patient: then it is necessary to cut above the place and detach from the fractured rib.
Deinde ponamus super ea instrumentum quod conseruat sifac, cuius rememoratio praecessit: et incidamus os cum facilitate, et incidamus ipsum.	Then let us put on it an instrument that preserves the sifac, whose memory has preceded: and let us cut into the bone with ease, and let us cut into it.
Deinde aggregemus duo labia uulneris, si est magnum cum sutura: et curemus ipsum cum emplastris, donec sanetur.	Then let us bring together the two lips of the wound, if it is large with a suture: and let us treat it with plasters, until it heals.
Quod si accidat interim apostema calidum, tunc propera, et infunde puluillos in oleo rosato, et pone super locum: et curetur infirmus cum eo quod conuenit apostemati.	Because if a hot aposteme occurs meanwhile, then let it be treated promptly, and let poultices soaked in rose oil be applied to the place: and let the weakened patient be treated with what is suitable for the aposteme.
Interim etiam resupinetur super latus super quod dormit, donec sanetur.	Meanwhile, also let it be raised above the affected part where he sleeps, until it heals.
Â¶ De restauratione fracturae Spondilium dorsi et colli.	Of the restoration of fractures of the dorsal spine and neck.
Caput X.	Chapter 10.
Ossibus quidem colli quandoque aduenit fractura, et raro accidit eis attritio: et similiter Spondilibus dorsi etiam.	Indeed, when a fracture of the neck vertebrae occurs, and rarely does it happen to them with bruising, and similarly with the dorsal spine as well.
Cum ergo accidit illud alicui, et uis scire, an sanetur, an non sanetur: tunc confidera.	When it happens to someone, and you want to know whether they will be healed or not: then consider.
Nam si uides manus eius iam mollificatas, et stupefactas, et mortuas: et non potest mouere eas, neque extendere eas, neque constringere eas: et quando constringis eas cum digitis tuis, et pungis eas cum acu, non sentit illud, et non sentit in eis dolorem: tunc scias, quia non sanatur, et in pluribus dispositionibus est mortale.	For if you see his hand is already softened and numbed and deadened, and he cannot move it, nor extend it, nor constrict it; and when you constrict it with your fingers and prick it with a needle, he does not feel it, and does not feel pain in it: then know that he will not be healed, and in many cases it is mortal.
Quod si mouet eas, et sentit in eis constrictionem cum digitis et puncturam: tunc scias, quia nucha ossis salua est, et quod infirmus sanabitur cum curatione.	But if he moves it, and feels the constriction with your fingers and the prick; then know that the marrow of the bone is sound, and that the injured person will be healed with treatment.
Quod si eueniat Spondilibus dorsi simile illius, et uis scire, an sanetur etiam, an non: tunc considera ad pedes eius: tunc si uides quod mollificati sunt, et accidit in eis illud quod accidit in manibus: deinde quando iacet super dorsum suum, egreditur uentositas et egestio absque uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super uentrem suum, egreditur egestio sine uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super dorsum suum, et uult mingere, et non potest: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	But if it happens to the spine of his back in a similar way, and you want to know whether he will be healed or not; then consider his feet: then if you see that they are softened, and the same thing happens to them as happened to his hands; afterwards when he lies on his back, wind and evacuation occur without his will; and when he turns onto his belly, evacuation occurs without his will; and when he turns onto his back, and wants to urinate, but cannot: then know that it is mortal.
Non ergo labores in curatione eius.	Do not therefore labor in his treatment.
Si uero non accidit ei aliquid ex illo, res est leuior.	If nothing happens to him from that, the case is lighter.
Et curatio eius quod accidit ex illo est, ut coneris sedationem apostematis calidi: ita, ut ponas super Spondilem attritam oleum rosatum solum: aut cum uitellis oui assati.	And the treatment for what happens to him from that is, as you try a gentle sedation of a warm poultice: thus, so you put rose oil alone on the affected spine; or with egg whites sat in wine.
Pone super ipsam illud aliquotiens in die, donec quando sedatur apostema calidum: tum pone super locum unum ex emplastris confortantibus, exiccantibus, et stringe super ipsum cum ligamento: et praecipe infirmo, ut utatur quiete et tranquillitate.	Put on it that thing several times a day, until when the warm poultice has calmed; then put on one of the comforting, drying, and constricting plasters, and bind over it with a ligature: and command the sick person to use quiet and tranquility.
Nec dormiat super partem cum qua inuenit dolorem, donec sanetur.	And let him not sleep on the side with which he finds pain, until he is healed.
Quod si accidit apud attritionem ossis sathaiatum, aut aliquid quod iam separatum fit ex eo: tunc oportet, ut seces super cutem, et auferas illud.	What if it happens because of the rubbing of a broken bone or something that is already separated from it: then it is necessary to sew up over the skin and remove that.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, si est magnum, cum sutura.	Then bring together the two lips of the wound, if it is large, with a suture.
Deinde cura ipsum cum aliquo incarnatiuo, ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with some kind of ointment, from unguents, until it is healed.
Si uero frangitur postremum ossis alhausos, et est finis caudae: tunc oportet, ut intromittas pollicem manus sinistrae in anum, et aeques os fractum manu altera, secundum quod possibile est, et secunda aequatione.	If indeed the end of the bone is fractured, and it is the tip of the tail: then it is necessary to introduce the thumb of the left hand into the anus, and to straighten the broken bone with the other hand, according to what is possible, and in a secondary adjustment.
Deinde pone super ipsum, et aufer ipsum: et cura uulnus cum curatione quae praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then put on it, and remove it: and treat the wound with the treatment that came before, until it is healed.
Â¶ De restauratione Anchae.	On the restoration of the anchovy (or anchor).
Caput XI.	Chapter 11.
Raro franguntur ossa Ancharum.	The anchor-shaped bones are rarely fractured.
Quod si franguntur, tunc fractura eorum non est, nisi comminutio in extremitatibus ipsorum: et scinduntur in longitudine, et declinantur ad interiora: et accidit infirmo dolor in loco, et punctura: et stupescit crus quod frangitur.	What if they are fractured, then their fracture is not, unless there is a comminution at the extremities of the same: and they split along the length, and decline towards the interior: and there occurs a weak pain in the place, and a puncture: and the leg that is fractured becomes numb.
Et restauratio quidem eius est, ut extendas manum tuam super ipsum, donec stes super fracturam qualiter est figura eius.	And its restoration is indeed, to extend your hand over it, until you stand over the fracture as it is in its shape.
Quod si fractura est in extremitatibus eius tantum, tunc aequa illam fracturam, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ex aequatione, donec assimiletur figurae suae naturali.	What if the fracture is only at the extremities of it, then equalize that fracture, according to what is prepared for you from the adjustment, until it is conformed to its natural shape.
Si autem fractura est in longitudine, aut iam declinat ad interiora: tunc fac iacere infirmum super uentrem suum, donec praeparetur tibi restauratio illius fracturae.	If, however, the fracture is along the length, or has already declined towards the interior: then make the weak part rest on its belly, until the restoration of that fracture is prepared for you.
Quando ergo aequaueris ipsam, pone super ipsam emplastrum: deinde pone super ipsam astellam ex ligno, aut ex cute: et stringe strictura super quam non timeas permutationem fracturae, neque remotionem astellae.	When you have equalized it, put a plaster on it: then put a splint of wood or leather on it, and bind with a tight bandage over which you do not fear the displacement of the fracture, nor the removal of the splint.
Et aequa concauitatem illorum cum eo quod impleat eam, donec capiat eam strictura secundum aequalitatem: et praecipe infirmo, ut dormiat super dorsum suum, aut super latus suum sanum.	And he should unite the concavity of those with what fills it, until it takes on a straight structure according to equality: and especially in the case of the weak, so that they sleep on their back or on their healthy side.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc cessa ab extensione eius, et ipsius restauratione, donec sedetur apostema calidum: et pone super ipsum quod sedet ipsum, secundum quod praecessit, deinde redi ad restaurationem eius: et stringe ipsum sicut oportet.	If, however, a hot abscess occurs to him: then cease from extending it, and its restoration, until the hot abscess settles: and put on it what settles it, according to what has gone before, then return to its restoration: and bind it as is necessary.
Si uero accidit in osse satagie, aut comminuitur, extrahe.	If, however, it occurs in a broken bone, or is dislocated, extract.
Â¶ De restauratione fracturae Adiutorii.	On the restoration of fractures of the helpers.
Caput XII.	Chapter 12.
Adiutorium est illud, quod est inter cubitum usque ad caput Spatulae.	The helper is that which is between the elbow and the head of the spatula bone.
Si ergo frangitur, tunc restauratio eius est secundum unum duorum modorum.	If therefore it is fractured, then its restoration is according to one of two modes.
Quorum unus est: ut accipias lignum planum mediae grossitudinis, secundum hanc formam, quae sequitur.	One of which is: that you take a flat piece of wood of medium thickness, according to this shape, which follows.
Et ligentur in duabus extremitatibus duo ligamenta.	And two bands are tied at the two extremities.
Deinde suspendatur ex loco eleuato: et sedeat infirmus super sedem.	Then it should be suspended from an elevated place: and the weak person should sit on a seat.
Deinde proiiciat brachium suum fractum super lignum, donec perueniat ad titillicum eius, in cuius medio sit annexa curuitas ligni.	Then he should place his fractured arm on the wood, until it reaches the joint of his elbow, where the curvature of the wood is attached.
Deinde suspende desuper ipsum aliquid graue, ut extendat ipsum minister ad inferiora.	Then hang something heavy above it, so that it stretches out to the lower parts.
Deinde aequet medicus fracturam manibus suis simul, donec redeat fractura, secundum quod oportet.	Then the physician should adjust the fracture with his hands, until the fracture is restored, according to what is necessary.
Et modus alter est, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et suspende manum eius a collo ipsius cum ligamento.	And another mode is, that the weak person should be raised up on his back: and his hand should be suspended from his neck with a band.
Deinde praecipe duobus ministris, ut teneat unus eorum illud quod est supra fracturam cum manibus suis: et ut alter teneat inferius eius, et extendat unusquisque eorum ad partem suam.	Then instruct two assistants, so that one of them holds what is above the fracture with his hands: and so that the other holds below it, and each of them stretches to their own side.
Et si uis, ut sit extensio fortior, tunc stringe sub fractura cum ligamento, et supra ipsam cum ligamento alio: et extendat ea unusquisque duorum ministrorum ad duas partes suas.	And if you wish to make the extension stronger, then bind below the fracture with a bandage, and above it with another bandage; and each of the two attendants will stretch it towards their respective sides.
Si ergo fractura est propinqua extremitati humeri, tunc oportet, ut ponatur unum ligamentum sub titillico, et alterum sub fractura uersus cubitum.	If the fracture is near the shoulder joint, then it is necessary to place one bandage under the armpit and another under the fracture towards the elbow.
Et similiter si fractura est propinqua cubito: tunc oportet, ut ponatur ligamentum super illum locum, et super cubitum ipsum.	And similarly if the fracture is near the elbow, then it is necessary to place a bandage over that spot and over the elbow itself.
Deinde aequa fracturam cum facilitate absque labore, donec quando aequatur fractura secundum quod oportet, et applicatur applicatione bona: tunc stringe eam, si non accidit apostema calidum.	Then make the fracture even with a gentle touch without strain, until the fracture is aligned as it should be, and apply a good application; then bind it, if no hot aposteme occurs.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam usque ad diem septimum.	If a hot aposteme occurs, then loosen the binding until the seventh day.
Et pone super ipsum lanam succidam imbibitam in aceto et oleo rosato, donec quando quiescit apostema: tunc stringe eam: et modus stringendi eam est, ut ponas emplastrum super fracturam.	And place on it a soft wool cloth soaked in vinegar and rose oil, until the aposteme subsides; then bind it; and the way of binding it is to apply a plaster over the fracture.
Deinde pone inuolutionem ex panno nouo super emplastrum.	Then put a wrapping of new cloth over the plaster.
Deinde aggreget brachium super adiutorium ipsum, et ponat manum suam apertam super humerum suum.	Then add the arm to the support, and place his hand open on his shoulder.
Et pone pannum, et stringe super adiutorium brachium, ut brachium stet loco astellarum: si non prohibet te ab illo aliquid, neque alteretur super te aliquid ex osse fracto.	And put on a cloth, and bind over the support to hold the arm in place, so that the arm stands firm; if nothing prevents you from it, nor is anything altered concerning you because of the broken bone.
Quod si times, quod alteretur super te ex osse fracto aliquid, tunc utere astellis: et est, ut ponas super fracturam ipsam astellam quae sit latior et fortior reliquis astellis.	If something changes concerning you because of the broken bone, then use a splint; and it is to place on the fracture itself a splint that is wider and stronger than other splints.
Et ponas inter omnem astellam latitudinem digiti: et sit longitudo astellarum secundum fracturam cum additione trium digitorum ab omni parte.	And place it across the entire width of a finger; and let the length of the splints be according to the fracture with an additional three fingers' breadth on each side.
Deinde stringe super astellas strictura quam dixi in principio capituli.	Then bind over the splint with the binding that I mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.
Et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae strictior.	And it is, that your compression above the place of fracture should be stricter.
Et quanto plus elongatur fractura, sit strictura minor.	And as much as the fracture is elongated, the compression should be less.
Si ergo uides situm astellarum et stricturam, sicut diximus, in hora qua restauras membrum statim, tunc fac: et si times apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam et astellas usque ad diem septimum, sicut diximus.	If you see the site of the stars and the compression, as we have said, at the hour when you restore the member immediately, then do it: and if you apply a warm poultice, then remove the compression and the bandages until the seventh day, as we have said.
Deinde considera ligamentum in omnibus tribus diebus, ut non accidat in loco pruritus, aut inflatio, aut prohibeatur cibus peruenire ad membrum, propter dispositionem superfluitatis stricturae.	Then consider the bandaging for three days, so that there may not occur itching at the site, or inflammation, or be prevented from receiving nourishment to the member, due to the excessive tightness of the compression.
Rectifica ergo illud totum, secundum quod diximus.	Correct everything then, according to what we have said.
Si uero es super fiduciam, ut non accidat ex illo aliquid: tunc non soluas ligamentum, nisi post tres dies, aut plus.	If you are confident in the healing, so that nothing happens to it from that: then do not remove the bandage, unless after three days, or more.
Et sit dormitio infirmi super dorsum suum, et manus eius super stomachum suum: et pone sub adiutorio culcitram plenam lana aequaliter.	And let the injured person sleep on their back, and their hand on their stomach: and place a full cushion of equal lanolin under their support.
Et considera in omni hora noctis, aut diei, ut non soluatur figura membri fracta, aut mollificetur ligamentum.	And consider at every hour of the night or day, that the shape of the fractured member is not disarranged, or the bandage loosened.
Rectifica ergo illud totum uirtute tua.	Correct everything then with your virtue.
Et pone cibum infirmi secundum ordinem quem praemisimus, ita ut sit cibus subtilis in primis, donec incipiat os stringi: tunc oportet, ut ingrosses cibum eius.	And give food to the injured person according to the order we have mentioned, so that the food is subtle at first, until the wound begins to consolidate: then it is necessary to increase their food.
De consuetudine enim adiutorii et cruris est, ut stringatur in quadraginta diebus: tunc ergo oportet, ut soluatur, et administretur balneum, et medicetur cum unguentis quae rectificant illud.	For it is customary for the helper and the knee to be consolidated in forty days: then therefore it is necessary, that it be loosened, and a bath be administered, and medicine be applied with ointments that correct it.
Quod si fractura fuerit foeda, attrita: tunc non soluas ab ea ligamentum et astellas usque ad quinquaginta dies, et usque ad duos menses.	If the fracture was dirty and bruised: then do not remove the compression and bandages from it until fifty days, and until two months.
Â¶ De restauratione fracturae Brachii.	Concerning the restoration of a fracture of the arm.
Caput XIII.	Chapter 13.
Brachium est compositum ex duobus ossibus, quae nominantur duo focilia.	The arm is composed of two bones, which are called the two forearm bones.
Quorum unum est paruum: et est illud quod sequitur pollicem.	One of them is small and it is the one that follows the thumb.
Et alterum est magnum, et est illud quod est positum sub paruo ab inferiori parte.	And the other is large, and it is the one that is placed under the small bone from the lower part.
Fortasse ergo frangitur focile maius solum, aut paruum: et fortasse franguntur simul.	Perhaps therefore only the larger forearm bone is fractured, or the smaller one; and perhaps they are both fractured together.
Quando ergo frangitur focile paruum superius, tunc restauratio eius est facilis, et sanatio eius est facilior.	When the smaller forearm bone above is fractured, then its restoration is easy, and its healing is easier.
Et quando frangitur focile inferius, est fractura eius mala, et sanatio eius difficilis.	And when the lower forearm bone is fractured, its fracture is bad, and its healing is difficult.
Et deterior ea est, quando franguntur duo ossa simul.	And it is even worse when both bones are fractured at the same time.
Si ergo os quod frangitur est focile parum superius, tunc conuenit medico apud restaurationem eius, ut ponat extensionem paruam cum facilitate, donec aequet ipsum.	If therefore the bone that is fractured is the smaller forearm bone above, then it is fitting for the doctor to use a small extension with ease during its restoration, until he makes it equal.
Si uero focile magnum est illud quod fractum est: tunc oportet, ut ponat stricturam fortiorem ualde.	If indeed the larger forearm bone is the one that is fractured: then it is necessary to apply a stronger compression with great force.
Et oportet, ut ponat figuram manus apud restaurationem eius, et ipsius extensionem extensam super puluinar.	And it is necessary to apply the shape of the hand during its restoration, and also extend the extension itself above the pillow.
Et sit pollex manus ad superiora altior omnibus digitis: et sit articularis inferior omnibus digitis, uel reliquis: et infirmus sedens quadratus super seipsum, et sit puluinar coram eo, uel in directo eius, in altitudine, ut non incurrat infirmus laborem.	And let the thumb of the hand be higher than all the fingers above: and let the joint below be inferior to all the fingers, or the remaining ones: and let the weak patient sit squarely on himself, and let the pillow be in front of him, or in a straight line with him, at an elevation, so that the weak patient does not incur labor.
Deinde extendat minister Brachium ab inferiori parte, aut manu sua, aut cum ligamento.	Then the assistant extends the arm from the lower part, or with his hand, or with a bandage.
Et minister alius extendat desuper similiter.	And another assistant extends it similarly from above.
Deinde aequet medicus os, donec reducat ipsum secundum meliorem figuram quam potest.	Then the doctor adjusts the bone until he reduces it to its better shape as much as possible.
Quod si in fractura ossis sunt satagiae, tunc conare reducere omne frustum in loco suo uirtute tua.	If there are splinters in the fracture of the bone, then try to reduce all the fragments to their place with your strength.
Si uero apparet in eo sathaiatum separatum, et pungit cutem, et non est tibi spes in restauratione eius: tunc finde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum secundum modum quem diximus in eis quae praemissa sunt.	If indeed a separated and useless thing appears in it, and it causes pain to the skin, and there is no hope for its restoration: then place something over it, and remove it according to the method which we mentioned in those things that were previously said.
Si autem fractura est cum uulnere, ego iam feci ad illud capitulum singulare, ergo accipe curationem illius inde.	If the fracture is with a wound, I have already made a separate chapter for that, so accept the treatment of it from there.
Quod si accidat in principio tuae restaurationis apostema calidum, tunc line pannum cum caeroto facto ex oleo rosato, et caera alba, et sit medium inter spissitudinem et subtilitatem: et stringe pannum super ipsum strictura subtili, donec quando sedatur apostema: tunc remoue caerotum, et pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum albumine oui.	If a warm aposteme happens at the beginning of your restoration, then apply a compress made with a mixture of rose oil and white wax, and let it be a medium between thickness and subtlety: and bind the compress over it with a subtle strapping, until the aposteme is cooled down: then remove the compress, and put on an emplaster prepared from flour mill dust with egg white.
Deinde pone astellas, et sit astella quae ponitur super fracturam ipsam latior parumper, et fortior.	Then put on a splint, and let the splint that is placed over the fracture itself be somewhat wider and stronger.
Et scias, quod numerus astellarum Brachii est sex in pluribus dispositionibus: siue sit fractura in focili uno, aut in duobus focilibus simul.	And know that the number of splints on the arm is six in various arrangements: whether there is a fracture in one forearm or in two forearms at the same time.
Deinde pone stricturam tuam super locum fracturae fortiorem et uehementiorem, et aliquanto plus cum strictura ad superiora fracturae, aut ad inferiora eius: aut pone stricturam molliorem strictura eius parumper, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius in principio capituli.	Then put your strapping over the place of the fracture stronger and more tightly, and somewhat more with the strapping above the fracture or below it: or put a softer strapping around it somewhat, according to what was mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.
Et sint panni qui inuoluuntur super fracturam, panni lenes, humidi: et non sint duri, asperi.	And let the bandages that envelop the fracture be soft and humid: and not rough or harsh.
Et sit filum quo stringitur ex lino proprie, medium inter subtile et grossum, sicut narrauimus.	And let the thread with which it is bound be of linen properly, a medium between subtle and coarse, as we have narrated.
Et considera membrum et ligamentum post dies.	And consider the member and ligament after some days.
Quod si accidat aliquid cuius rectificatio sit necessaria, sicut pruritus qui accidit membro: tunc oportet, ut embroces membrum cum aqua calefacta, donec quiescat ille pruritus, et dimittas membrum non constrictum, donec quiescat, deinde itera stricturam.	If something happens which requires rectification, such as itching that occurs in the member: then it is necessary to apply a compress to the member with warm water, until the itching subsides, and to release the member unbound, until it subsides; then reapply the strapping.
Quod si strictura iam mollificata est, et os iam remotum, et similia illis: tunc rectifica illud totum uirtute tua, et considera iterum.	What if the stricture is already softened and the bone is already removed, and similar things: then straighten everything with your strength, and consider it again.
Nam si nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad membrum, propter superfluitatem stricturae, tunc oportet, ut mollifices ipsum parumper, et dimittas ipsum aliquot diebus, donec currat ad ipsum nutrimentum, deinde stringe ipsum.	For if the nutrient is prevented from reaching the member because of the excess of the stricture, then it is necessary to soften it for a short time, and let it be for some days, until it runs towards the nutrient, then constrict it.
Si autem non accidit infirmo aliquid eorum quae diximus, tunc non oportet, ut soluatur, nisi post uiginti dies, aut circiter hos.	If however none of those things we mentioned happen to the patient, then it is not necessary to loosen it until after twenty days or around that.
Deinde suspendatur manus infirmi ad collum eius.	Then let the hand of the patient be suspended at his neck.
Et sit collum eius aequale, et custodiatur uirtute sua a motibus agitatiuis.	And let his neck be equal and guarded by its strength against agitated movements.
Et fac eum dormire super dorsum suum.	And make him sleep on his back.
Et scias, quod haec fractura in triginta diebus, aut in triginta duobus diebus restauratur: et fortasse restauratur in uigintiocto diebus.	And know that this fracture is restored in thirty days, or in thirty-two days; and perhaps it will be restored in twenty-eight days.
Totum illud est secundum dispositiones complexionum, et dispositiones uirtutis.	All of that is according to the dispositions of complexions and the dispositions of strengths.
Â¶ De restauratione fracturarum Manus.	On the restoration of fractures of the hand.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter 13.
Scias, quod pectini Manus, et nodis digitorum raro accidit fractura.	Know that fracture of the metacarpal bones and joints of the fingers rarely occurs.
Et non accidit ei, nisi attritio multotiens.	And it does not happen to them unless there is repeated trauma.
Quando ergo accidit plantae fractura, aut attritio: tunc oportet, ut sedeat infirmus quadratus: et coram eo sit sedes secundum aequalitatem.	When therefore a fracture of the sole occurs, or trauma: then it is necessary for the patient to sit squarely: and let his seat be in front of him according to equality.
Deinde pone Manum eius super eam extensam.	Then put his hand on it extended.
Deinde extendat minister ossa fracta, et aequet ea medicus, donec quando coniunguntur coniunctione bona.	Then the assistant extends the broken bone, and the physician adjusts it, until they are joined with a good union.
Tunc oportet, ut ponat emplastrum et stuppam, si non accidat apostema calidum.	Then it is necessary to apply an emplaster and a poultice, if there is no hot aposteme.
Deinde pone astellam desuper secundum quantitatem loci: et tu iam inuoluisti eam in panno lini.	Then put the splint on top according to the quantity of the location: and you have already wrapped it in a linen cloth.
Si autem fractura est ad inferiora circiter uentrem plantae, tunc fac simile spherae ex panno: et praecipe infirmo, ut coartet super eam cum planta sua fracta: deinde stringatur cum panno longo.	If the fracture is around the lower part of the sole of the foot, then make a similar sphere out of cloth: and place it under the injured person, so that it presses upon the fractured sole with its own plantar surface: then bind it with a long cloth.
Et sit astella ex corio, in quo sit lenitas, ut applicetur corium cum corpore plantae: et stringe eam, secundum quod oportet.	And let there be a thin layer of leather, in which there is gentleness, so that the leather may be applied to the body of the sole with its own flesh: and bind it, according as it is necessary.
Si autem fractura est ad exteriora, tunc oportet: ut ponas astellam desuper, et astellam aliam ab inferiori in planta: et sit manus aperta recta.	If the fracture is on the outer side, then it is necessary: to place a thin layer above, and another thin layer below on the sole of the foot: and let the hand be open and straight.
Deinde pone stricturam, sicut reuoluitur manus: et extende inter digitos cum ligamento.	Then put on a bandage, as the hand is revolved: and extend it between the toes with a ligature.
Quod si accidat fractura alicui nodorum digitorum, tunc si est pollex, aequetur secundum quod oportet.	If a fracture occurs in any of the nodes of the fingers, then if it is the thumb, it should be equalized according to what is necessary.
Deinde stringatur cum planta: et si amas, pone ei astellam rectam, paruam: ut eleuetur fractura, et non moueatur.	Then bind it with a splint: and if you wish, put on it a straight, small thin layer: so that the fracture may be elevated, and not moved.
Si autem fractura est reliquis digitis, sicut medio, et indici, aut auriculari, et anulari, tunc aequetur, et ligetur cum digito sano qui sequitur eum: aut ligentur omnes secundum continuationem: et est melius.	If the fracture is in the remaining fingers, such as the middle, and index, or ring, and little finger, then it should be equalized, and bound with a healthy finger that follows it: or all of them may be bound together according to continuity: and this is better.
Aut pone super ipsum astellam paruam, sicut diximus in pollice.	Or put on top of it a small thin layer, as we said regarding the thumb.
Et considera in restauratione tua, et post ipsam dispositionem apostematis calidi: et oppone cum eo quod oportet, quando accidit aliquid ex illo, secundum quod iteratur eius narratio.	And consider in your restoration, and after the disposition of the warm poultice: and oppose with it what is necessary, when something happens from that, according to how its story is repeated.
Â¶ De restauratione fracturae Coxae.	On the Restoration of Fractures of the Hip.
Caput XV.	Chapter 15.
OS Coxae multotiens frangitur, et declaratur sensui: quoniam conuertitur ad interiorem et posteriorem partem.	The hip bone is often fractured and is declared by sensation: because it is turned inward towards the inner and posterior parts.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, quod stringitur ligamentum supra fracturam, et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	And its restoration is done thus, that a bandage is bound above the fracture, and another bandage below the fracture.
Et infirmus prostretur super faciem suam.	And the wounded person is laid out on their face.
Deinde extendat omne ligamentum minister ad partem suam secundum aequalitatem: et hoc, quando est fractura in medio ossis.	Then every ligament is extended to its own equal part: and this, when there is a fracture in the middle of the bone.
Si autem est fractura propinqua radici Coxae, tunc sit ligamentum ad partem pectinis, ut cadat extensio ad sursum: et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	If, however, there is a fracture near the root of the hip, then the ligament should be to the part of the thigh, so that extension falls upwards: and another ligament beneath the fracture.
Et sic similiter si est fractura propinqua genu, tunc sit ligamentum propinquum genu, ut sit extensio ad inferiora.	And similarly, if there is a fracture near the knee, then the ligament should be near the knee, so that the extension is towards the lower parts.
Deinde aequet medicus os utriusque manibus suis, donec reducat ipsum secundum similitudinem figurae naturalis: et coniugatur os coniunctione bona.	Then the physician equals the bone with both his hands, until he reduces it according to the similarity of its natural shape: and joins the bone with a good conjunction.
Tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum et stricturam, si non accidit membro apostema.	Then it is necessary to apply an emplaster and bandage, if there does not occur an abscess in the limb.
Quod si accidat in eo apostema: tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur apostema calidum, deinde redi ad curationem tuam.	If an abscess occurs in it: then leave it for some days, until the hot abscess subsides, and then return to your treatment.
Strictura autem eius ita sit.	The bandage should be thus placed.
Oportet ut inuoluas super fracturam imema duram, id est, bindam: et dupla eam bis, aut ter: et remaneat ex ea superfluitas.	It is necessary to put a soft wrapping over the fracture, that is, to bind it: and double or triple it: and remove the excess from it.
Deinde inuolue crus, donec perueniat calcaneus apud radicem natis.	Then wrap the leg, until the heel reaches the root of the hip.
Et intromitte filum longum inter Coxam et crus prope genu ad inferiora, et ueniant extremitates fili a superiori parte duarum partium.	And insert a long thread between the hip and leg near the knee down below, and tie the ends of the threads at the upper part of the two limbs.
Deinde reuolue super Crus et Coxam quod superfluit ex alimema.	Then roll back over the leg and hip what is excessive from the wrapping.
Deinde pone super Coxam in loco fracturae ipsius astellas, et pone ex eis astellam unam super os cruris.	Then put on the hip at the place of the fracture itself a little stick, and put one of them on the bone of the leg.
Deinde imple uacuitates inter crus et coxam cum pannis lenibus, ut aequetur strictura.	Then fill in the empty spaces between the leg and hip with soft cloths, so that the bandage is equalized.
Deinde incipe cum strictura forti a medio super locum fracturae tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor.	Then start with a strong bandage in the middle over the place of the fracture, three or four wraps.
Et quanto plus elongaris cum ligamento a loco fracturae, sit strictura tua minor et mollior, et lenior.	And as much as it is more elongated with a bandage at the place of the fracture, your structure will be smaller and softer, and weaker.
Deinde intende ad duas extremitates fili, quod tu intromisisti inter coxam et crus.	Then turn to the two extremities of the thigh, which you inserted between the hip and leg.
Liga ergo cum utrisque tres astellas quae sunt desuper.	Bind it therefore with three splints that are above.
Deinde uade cum duabus extremitatibus fili ad inferiora, donec peruenias ad cauillam pedis.	Then wrap with two extremities of the thigh down to the foot, until you reach the heel of the foot.
Et cum utrisque stringe etiam extremitates astellarum a parte altera: ut non remoueatur ligamentum ex loco suo.	And tie with three strings, also the extremities of the splints from the other side: so that the bandage is not removed from its place.
Deinde dimitte stricturam super illud, dum permanet, ita quod non accidat membro corrosio, neque apostema, neque inflatio, et similia eis.	Then leave the structure on that, while it remains, so that there is no corrosion of the limb, nor abscess, nor inflammation, and similar things.
Quod si accidat aliquid ex illo.	If something happens from that.
Propera ergo cum solutione eius, et rectifica illud quod accidit inde totum, secundum quod diximus multotiens.	Provide therefore with its treatment, and correct what has happened there altogether, according to what we have said many times.
Si uero in osse est frustum ex osse quod pungat: tunc oportet, ut aeques illud, si est tibi possibile.	If indeed there is a splinter of bone that pierces: then it is necessary, to equalize that, if it is possible for you.
Et si non, finde super illud, et remoue illud: et cura cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio, donec sanetur.	And if not, find over that, and remove that: and take care with what preceded the treatment, until it is healed.
Et quandoque stringitur haec fractura Coxae, praeter quod addantur ei astellae, sicut diximus in adiutorio et brachio.	And when this fracture of the hip is bound, besides what splints are added to it, as we said concerning the assistant and arm.
Verumtamen in restauratione eius taliter fracta, non accidit infirmo claudicatio.	However, in the restoration of that fracture, there does not occur a weak limping.
Et si restauratur sola, praeter quod applicetur ei crus alterum, tunc necesse est, ut claudicet ille cuius est, semper.	And if it is restored alone, besides what the other leg is applied to it, then it is necessary, that he who is lame will always limp.
Et scias, quod Coxa stringitur in quinquaginta diebus, uel additur parum, aut minuitur parum: totum illud est secundum diuersitatem complexionum, et reliquarum dispositionum.	And know that the hip is bound for fifty days, or a little more or less: all of that is according to the diversity of complexions and remaining dispositions.
Â¶ De restauratione fracturae Rotulae genu.	Concerning the restoration of a fracture of the knee joint.
Caput XVI.	Chapter 16.
Scias, quod Rotulae genu raro accidit fractura, sed accidit ei attritio multotiens.	You should know that a fracture of the kneecap rarely occurs, but it often undergoes a lot of wear and tear.
Si uero accidit ei fractura, tunc non nisi aut fissura, aut foramen in partibus suis.	If a fracture of it does occur, then it is not except as a result of either a crack or a hole in its own parts.
Et est illud cum uulnere, et absque uulnere.	And this is with a wound, and without a wound.
Et statur super illud totum cum sensu.	And it stands upon the entire thing with sensation.
Et restauratio eius est ita, ut aequetur quod disruptum est ex partibus eius cum digitis, donec aggregetur, et coniungatur secundum quod possibile est ex aequatione et facilitate, et fabricatione.	And its restoration is thus, that it is equalized with what has been disrupted from its parts with fingers, until it is aggregated and reunited as much as possible through equality and facilitation, and fabrication.
Deinde pone emplastrum ex farina sisami, uel molendini, cum albumine oui: et pone super ipsum astellam rotundam, si indiges illa: et stringe desuper strictura conueniente ad illud.	Then put a plaster made from flour of barley or millet, with the white of an egg: and place above it a rounded bandage, if you need it: and tie above it a suitable constriction to hold it in place.
Deinde considera omnes dispositiones quas narrauimus in reliquis fracturis: sicut apostema calidum, et similia illi: ita, ut opponas omni accidenti cum eo quod conuenit ei, donec sanetur.	Then consider all the arrangements that we have mentioned in other fractures: such as a warm poultice, and similar things: so, that you may oppose every accident with what is suitable for it, until it heals.
Â¶ De restauratione fracturae Cruris.	On the Restoration of Fractures of the Leg.
Caput XVII.	Chapter 17.
Scias, quod Cruri sunt duo ossa, quorum unum est grossum, et nominatur nomine Cruris: et alterum subtile, et nominatur Focile.	You should know that there are two bones in the leg, one of which is thick and is called by the name "Crur" (of the leg), and the other is subtle and is called "Fibula".
Et accidit utrisque ex speciebus fracturae quod accidit duobus ossibus brachii: et propter illud fit restauratio eius, sicut restauratio brachii aequaliter, et operatio est una.	And it happens that both of them (the bones in the leg) suffer from types of fracture that happen to the two bones in the arm; and because of this their restoration is like the restoration of the arm, equally, and the operation is one.
Quod si franguntur duo ossa simul, conuertitur Crus ad omnes partes.	When both bones are broken at the same time, the leg is bent towards all its parts.
Et si frangitur os subtilius, conuertitur Crus ad anteriorem partem.	And if the subtle bone is broken, the leg is bent towards the front part.
Et si frangitur os grossius, inuenis illud inferius: et est ex eis quae non occultantur tibi.	And if the thick bone is broken, you will find it lower down: and it is one of those things that do not hide from you.
Deinde administra extensionem, et aequationem, et ligationem astellarum secundum illud aequaliter.	Then administer extension, and adjustment, and ligature of the stellar bones according to that equality.
Verumtamen oportet, si fractura Cruris est fractura foeda, habens sethagie multa: ut sit extensio minor, et lenior alleuiatione tua.	Indeed it is opportune, if the fracture of the thigh bone is a foul fracture having many septic characteristics: so that there may be lesser extension and a more gentle alleviation of yours.
Et in Crure quidem est ex operatione quiddam super brachium: et est, ut quando tu aequas astellas, et comples omnem operationem tuam, tunc accipe duas fascias ex ligno pini, quod administratur in fabricatione solariorum quod ponitur sub tabulis: et fiunt ex spatulis palmae: et elige ex eis quibus est grossitudo parua, et neque sint ex minutis: et sit longitudo earum secundum longitudinem Cruris a genu usque inferius.	And in the thigh indeed there is something extra from the operation on the arm; and it is, when you adjust the stellar bones and complete your entire operation, then take two fascias of pine wood, which are administered in the fabrication of solar appliances that are placed under the tables; and they are made from palm spatulas: and choose from them which has small thickness, and not from minute ones; and let their length be according to the length of the thigh from the knee down to below.
Deinde inuolue super unamquamque pannum duabus inuolutionibus secundum longitudinem eius.	Then wrap over each bandage with two wrappings according to its length.
Et pone unam partem Cruris a parte una, et alteram a parte altera: et sint ex genu usque inferius pedis.	And place one part of the thigh on one side, and another on the other side; and let them be from the knee down to the bottom of the foot.
Deinde liga duas fascias in tribus locis ex duabus extremitatibus et medio.	Then tie two fascias in three places, from the two extremities and the middle.
Cum enim strictura prohibetur, Crus declinat ad dextram et sinistram, et stat statione bona.	For when the structure is prohibited, the thigh declines to the right and left, and stands in a good position.
Et iam quidem administretur cunabulum ex ligno secundum longitudinem Cruris, et ponatur in eo Crus, ut conseruet ipsum a motu.	And now indeed administer a splint of wood according to the length of the thigh, and place the thigh in it, so that it may conserve it from motion.
Et plurimum quidem oportet, ut facias illud in fractura quando cum ea est uulnus proprie.	And it is especially opportune to do this in the fracture when there is a wound properly belonging to it.
Deinde considera Crus in omni die, et stude cum eo studio ultimo ab apostemate, aut inflatione, aut reliquis aliis.	Then consider the thigh every day, and strive with utmost effort to prevent aposteme, or inflammation, or other such things.
Si ergo accidit aliquid ex illis, tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur, si Deus uoluerit.	If therefore something of those things happens, then oppose it with what is opportune, until it is healed, if God wills it.
De fractura ossium Pedis, et Digitorum.	On the fracture of the bones of the Foot and Toes.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter 18.
Calcaneo quidem non accidit fractura penitus.	Indeed, a fracture does not occur in the heel bone deep within.
Ossibus uero Pedis accidit quandoque fractura, et Digitis parum etiam accidit fractura: et non accidit eis nisi attritio in pluribus dispositionibus.	A fracture sometimes occurs in the bones of the foot, and a small fracture also occurs in the toes; and it does not occur unless there is inflammation in many different positions.
Quod si accidit ossibus Pedis fractura, et uides illa ossa sublimari super se adinuicem, tunc ponat infirmus Pedem suum super terram praeparatam, sicut ambulans.	When a fracture occurs in the bones of the foot, and you see those bones elevated above their normal position, then the patient will place his foot on the prepared ground as if walking.
Deinde sta tu, et pone Pedem tuum super illud quod eleuatur ex illis ossibus: postea preme, uel calca eam: et aequa ipsam, donec redeat in locis suis.	Then stand there, and place your foot on what is elevated from those bones; afterwards press, or tread on it; and equalize it, until it returns to its proper places.
Deinde pone emplastrum, et stuppam desuper: et pone sub uentre Pedis tabulam paruam, cui sint duo capita plana.	Then apply a plaster, and padding on top; and place under the foot a small flat board with two flat heads.
Deinde stringe eam cum Pede strictura decenti, postquam tu inuoluis eam cum pannis, et reliquis quibus indiget.	Then bind it with a suitable strapping to the foot, after you have wrapped it with cloths and other things that it needs.
Cum ergo praetereunt ei tres dies, aut quatuor, tunc solue ligamentum.	When therefore three days or four have passed, then loosen the bandage.
Nam tu inuenies ossa aequata, siue sint fracta, aut sint dislocata.	For you will find the bones equalized, whether they were fractured or dislocated.
Operatio ergo in eis est, sicut uides.	The operation therefore is successful, as you see.
Si autem franguntur aliqui digiti, tunc restaura eos, et aequa ipsos secundum quod narraui tibi in restauratione digitorum manus.	If however some toes are broken, then restore them, and equalize them according to what I narrated to you about the restoration of the fingers of the hand.
Deinde pone digito tuo astellam secundum longitudinem digiti, et sit latior eo parumper: deinde pone sub Pede hanc tabulam quam narraui tibi, et stringe eam strictura decenti.	Then place your finger on the awl according to the length of the toe, and let it be a little wider; then place under the foot the board that I narrated to you, and bind it with a suitable strapping.
Si uero quod frangitur ex ossibus est duo, aut tria, aut plus, tunc pone super omnem digitum astellam suae quantitatis, inuolutam in panno lini: et stringe tabulam in inferiori Pedis: et sit stans super unum capitum tabulae extra uentrem Pedis, ut teneat retentione bona.	If however what is broken from the bones is two, or three, or more, then place on each toe an awl of its own quantity, wrapped in a linen cloth; and bind the board to the lower foot; and let it stand on one flat head of the board outside the belly of the foot, so that it holds with good retention.
Et conuenit tibi, ut non obliuiscaris, quin consideres omnia quae dixi tibi in reliquis fracturis ex accidentibus quae diximus: et oppone omni accidenti cum eo quod oportet.	And it is fitting for you, lest you forget, to consider all the things that I have told you about the remaining fractures from the accidents that we have mentioned; and oppose every accident with what is proper.
Â¶ De fractura Vuluae mulieris, et ossis pectinis, et uirgae uiri.	About the fracture of a woman's pubic bone, and of the os pubis, and of a man's virga.
Caput XIX.	Chapter 19.
Quando frangitur Vulua mulieris, tunc fac eam sedere quadratam.	When the woman's pubic bone is fractured, then have her sit squarely.
Deinde inclina eam ad partem dorsi ipsius parumper, et teneatur retro.	Then lean her back towards the same dorsal part, and let it be held back.
Deinde impleat obstetrix Vuluam eius coto, donec impleat eam: et fiat in Vulua ex eo sicut sphera.	Then fill the woman's pubic bone with its bandage, until you fill it: and let it be made spherical in the pubic bone from that.
Deinde concutiatur mulier, et eleua dorsum eius paulatim.	Then the woman is shaken, and her back is raised little by little.
Illud enim cotum egreditur, donec fiat ante portam Vuluae sicut sphera, et os fractum redit.	For that bandage comes out, until it becomes a sphere before the gate of the pubic bone, and the broken bone returns.
Deinde pone puluillum super dorsum eius.	Then put a small pillow over her back.
Quando ergo uult mingere, remoueat cotum cum facilitate, deinde mingat: et reduc ipsum secundum modum, quo intromisisti ipsum in primis: deinde redeat ad puluillum suum primum.	When therefore she wants to urinate, remove the bandage with facility, then let her urinate: and reduce it according to the method by which you introduced it at first; then let it return to its original pillow.
Faciat illud septem diebus, aut circiter, os ipsum enim restauratur.	Let her do that for seven days, or around that, for the bone itself is restored.
Et si uis, accipe uesicam ouis, et stringe super foramen eius cannulam arundinis, et intromitte uesicam totam in Vuluam eius.	And if you wish, take a bladder of goat skin, and tie above the opening of its canal a reed tube, and insert the whole bladder into her pubic bone.
Deinde suffla in cannulam cum uirtute, donec infletur uesica intra Vuluam, fractura enim redit.	Then blow into the tube with force, until the bladder is inflated within the pubic bone, for the fracture returns.
Deinde impleatur cum coto, et stet aliquot diebus, secundum quod narrauimus, donec sanetur.	Then it is filled with a bandage, and let it stand for some days, according to what we have narrated, until she is healed.
Et quando frangitur os Pectinis uiri, aut mulieris, tunc administra in restauratione eius, et ipsius aequatione illud quod narrauimus in osse Anchae.	And when the bone of the man's or woman's pubis is fractured, then administer in its restoration, and equalize it according to what we have narrated in the bone of the ankle.
Et non occultatur rectum in his fracturis propinquis, quae parum contingunt, praecipue cui est quiddam studii, uel usus.	And it is not hidden that the straightness in these closely adjacent fractures, which barely touch, especially if there is something of a stud or usage.
Et intellige librum meum istum multum, quoniam fractura ipsa significat tibi in pluribus dispositionibus uiam rectam in restauratione sui, et strictura sui: intellige ergo.	And understand my book, this much, because the fracture itself shows you in many arrangements the straight way of its restoration and its structure: understand therefore.
In Virga autem uiri quando frangitur, accipe guttur anseris: et intromitte uirgam in ipso.	When a branch is broken, take a gutture of a goose: and insert the twig into it.
Deinde pone super ipsum inuolutionem ex panno, et inuoluatur, et dimittatur tribus diebus, aut circiter eos, et sanabitur, si Deus uoluerit.	Then put a dressing of cloth over it, and bandage it, and let it be for three days or around that time, and it will heal, if God wills it.
Â¶ De restauratione fracturae ossium, quando est cum uulnere.	Concerning the restoration of a fracture of bones, when it is with an ulcer.
Caput XX.	Chapter 20.
Conuenit ei cui accidit fractura cum uulnere, praecipue si est magnum, sicut os coxae, aut adiutorii, aut simile illi, ut properes, et phlebotomes ipsum statim: si attestantur tibi conditiones phlebotomiae, sicut praemisimus.	It is fitting for him to whom a fracture with an ulcer has occurred, especially if it is large, such as the hip bone, or the helper, or similar to that, so that he may be prepared, and the bloodletters stand by immediately: if the conditions of bloodletting are testified to you, as we have previously mentioned.
Quod si uulnus effluit sanguinem, tunc oportet, ut properes ad abscisionem eius, ita ut puluerizes super ipsum zegi tritum: si non est tibi praesens aliud.	If the ulcer flows with blood, then it is necessary, so that you may be prepared for its excision, in order to sprinkle powdered zinc oxide over it: if there is not another remedy present to you.
Deinde incipe restaurare fracturam in illo eodem die: et non postponas illud, si non accidit apostema.	Then begin to restore the fracture on the same day: and do not put it off, if there is no abscess.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte restaurationem eius usque ad diem nonum, donec sedetur apostema.	If a hot abscess occurs, then postpone the restoration of it until the ninth day, until the abscess subsides.
Et non appropinques ei in die tertio, et quarto omnino, nam tu faceres ei accidere accidentia mala.	And do not approach him on the third and fourth days at all, lest you cause bad accidents to happen to him.
Si autem os fractum est eminens super cutem detectum: tunc oportet, ut coneris reducere ipsum, et aequare ipsum manibus tuis cum facilitate et extensione parua.	If the broken bone is prominent above the detected skin: then it is necessary, that you should strive to reduce it, and adjust it with your hands using gentle and slight extension.
Si autem non praeparatur extensio eius, et ipsius aequatio manibus tuis: tunc reduc ipsum cum isto instrumento.	If the extension of it is not prepared, and its adjustment with your hands: then reduce it with that instrument.
Et est instrumentum quod fit ex ferro, cuius longitudo est quantitas septem digitorum, aut octo: et eius latitudo est secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And it is an instrument made of iron, whose length is the measure of seven fingers, or eight: and its width is according to the size of the wound.
Et propter illud necesse est medico, ut accipiat ex eis tria, aut quatuor secundum quantitatem qua indiget ad illud ex curatione in omni specie fracturae.	And therefore it is necessary for the doctor to take from them three or four according to the size which he needs for that cure in every kind of fracture.
Et sit rotundum: et sit in eo grossitudo parua, ut non duplicetur apud compressionem super ipsum in hora operationis: et sit acutae extremitatis, cui sit margo in extremitatibus suis.	And let it be round: and let there be a small thickness in it, so that it is not doubled over during compression on it at the time of operation: and let it have a sharp extremity, which has an edge at its extremities.
Et sit superius eius ad grossitudinem ex medietate eius usque ad inferiora.	And let its upper part be in thickness from its middle to its lower parts.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its shape.
Oportet in Hac Operatione, ut ponatur extremitas eius acuta curuata super extremitatem ossis eminentis: et impelle ipsum cum eo uice una, donec quando redit os et aequatur quadam aequatione.	It is necessary in this operation that the acute curved extremity of it be placed over the prominent bone extremity: and press it with the vice of one, until when the bone returns and is equalized by a certain equalization.
Conare ergo aequare extremitates fracturae adinuicem.	Therefore, make the extremities of the fracture even.
Quod si extremitates eius fracta est subtilis, et non accipit eam instrumentum accaeptione bona, tunc opotet, ut incidas extremitatem illius ossis, donec instrumentum potestatem habeat eius.	If the extremity of the fracture is subtle and does not receive the instrument with good reception, then it is necessary to cut into the extremity of that bone, until the instrument has power over it.
Si uero non potes reducere eos cum eo quod narrauimus omnino, tunc incide ipsum cum eo quod conuenit ei ex Incisoriis quae diximus: aut serra ipsum cum una serrarum quocunque modo possibile est tibi.	If indeed you are not able to reduce them with that which we have described entirely, then cut into it with that which is convenient for it from the incisions which we have mentioned: or saw it with one of the saws in whatever way possible to you.
Deinde rade illud quod remanet in osse ex asperitate et corticibus minutis.	Then rasp what remains in the bone from roughness and small cortical prominences.
Cum ergo reducitur os, et inuenit infirmus post reductionem eius dolorem uehementem laedentem, tunc scias, quod os non rediit ad locum suum naturalem.	When therefore the bone is reduced, and after its reduction it finds a weak and vehemently painful lament, then know that the bone did not return to its natural place.
Fac ergo illud.	Do it therefore.
Nam tu confers infirmo iuuamentum magnum, cum completur restauratio tua quam facis ossi.	For you confer great benefit on the weak, when your restoration is completed, which you do to the bone.
Tunc submerge pannum in uino stiptico, nigro.	Then soak a piece of cloth in a black styptic wine.
Et proprie si est in aestate.	And especially if it is in summer.
Et non ponas super uulnus caerotum, neque aliquid in quo sit oleum: ut non faciat accidere in ipso putredinem et corruptionem.	And do not place it on a bruised wound, nor anything in which there is oil: so that it does not cause decay and corruption.
Deinde administra astellas in hora complementi tui a restauratione ossis.	Then administer the staples at the time of your recovery for the restoration of bone.
Et dimitte uulnus detectum: ita, ut incidas cum forficibus foramen in inuolutionibus secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And uncover the wound: so that you may thrust with forceps into the openings of the wound according to the size of the injury.
Et caue omni cautela, ne stringas uulnus cum fractura.	And beware of all caution, lest you constrict the wound with a fracture.
Multotiens enim fecerunt istud stolidi medici: et fecerunt accidere super infirmos suos aut mortem, aut corrosionem, aut zuchem, id est, saniem.	For many foolish physicians have done this: and they have caused harm to their patients, either death or decay, or corruption, that is, putridity.
Et sit strictura tua mollis, lenis, diuersa stricturae fracturarum reliquarum.	And let your constriction be soft, gentle, and a different constriction for the remaining fractures.
Quod si uulnus est malum, aut est uulnus magnum, et times super ipsum quaedam accidentia mala quae narrauimus, et inuenis dolorem in loco suspensum: tunc non oportet, ut ponas super ipsum astellas.	Because if the wound is bad, or it is a great wound, and certain evil accidents happen to it, which we have described, and you find pain in the suspended location: then it is not suitable to place staples on it.
Et fac eis inuolutiones ex pannis duris in loco astellarum, et stringe ipsum cum eis.	And make wrappings out of hard bandages in the place of staples, and constrict it with them.
Cum autem est post diem unum, aut dies duos, et uides uulnus iam incipere, ut in eo generetur pus: tunc aufer desuper ipsum pannum quem posuisti super ipsum cum uino.	When, however, it is after one day, or two days, and you see the wound has already begun to generate pus: then remove from above the cloth which you placed on it with wine.
Deinde administra licinia, et unguenta cum quibus de consuetudine nostra est, ut medicemur uulnera: sicut unguentum tetrapharmacon, et similia illi.	Then administer the ligatures, and ointments with which we are accustomed to treat wounds: such as the four-drug ointment, and similar to that.
Et conuenit tibi, ut soluas ligamentum.	And it is fitting for you to loosen the ligature.
Et considera uulnus in omni die mane et uespere, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	And examine the wound every morning and evening, until it is consolidated and healed.
Et oportet, ut praeparetur membrum taliter, ut currat ex eo pus ad inferiora cum facilitate.	And it is necessary to prepare the membrane in such a way that pus flows out from it easily downwards with facility.
Quod si praetereunt uulneri dies multi, et non consolidatur, neque abscinditur pus ab eo: tunc scias, quod illic sunt satagie ossis parua.	If many days pass over the wound and it does not consolidate, nor is pus separated from it, then you should know that there are small fragments of bone stuck.
Quare oportet, ut inquiras uulnus cum tenta.	It is necessary to examine the wound with a probe.
Quot uero ex illis alsatagie sunt separata, remoue ea, et extrahe ipsa.	However, if there are separated fragments, remove them, and extract those as well.
Et quae ex eis sunt non separata, et pungunt membrum, et faciunt accidere dolorem, conare incidere ea, et auferre ea omni modo quo possibile est tibi illud.	And those that are not separated and pierce the membrane and cause pain to occur, try to cut around them, and remove them in every way possible for you.
Quod si accidat uulneri zuchen, aut ekileten, id est, estiomenus, aut species alia corruptionis et putrefactionis: tunc oportet, ut opponas unicuique ex eis cum eo quod conuenit ei ex curatione, cuius praecessit narratio in capitulo suo.	If there happens to be a wound that suppurates, or becomes foul-smelling, that is, putrid, or another kind of corruption and decay: then it is necessary to oppose each one of them with what is suitable for its cure, the preceding narration being in its own chapter.
Et ex eo in quo oportet ut stet sermo meus, et cui facias praesentem mentem tuam quando frangitur os, et eminet super membrum, sicut os coxae, et adiutorii, et similia eis ex membris magnis, est, ut non praesumas attractionem eius, multotiens enim accidit ex illo mors, imo dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat.	And from that which is necessary to stand as my discourse, and you should make your present thought when a bone is fractured, and protrudes above the membrane, such as the hip bone, and the helpers, and similar ones among the large members, it is so that you do not assume an attraction of it, for it often happens from that disease, or rather, abandon it, until it putrefies.
Fortasse enim cadet per se post uiginti dies, aut triginta.	Perhaps indeed it will fall off by itself after twenty days, or thirty.
Tunc ergo cura uulnus, si uidetur tibi: et sinon, dimitte ipsum.	Then therefore cure the wound, if it seems possible to you; and if not, abandon it.
Â¶ De curatione Nodationis in uestigio fracturae.	Concerning the Cure of a Knot in a Fracture of the Vertebrae.
Caput XXI.	Chapter 21.
Multoties accidit haec Nodatio in uestigio sanationis fracturae.	This knot often occurs during the healing of a fracture of the vertebrae.
Praecipue, quae est prope iuncturas: et foedatur ex ea figura membri.	Especially when it is near the joints and is formed into that shape of a member.
Et fortasse prohibet membrum ab operatione sua naturali.	And perhaps it prevents the member from performing its natural function.
Considera ergo tunc, si nodatio est recens: administra in ea medicinas quae stipticitatem habent, sicut aloe, et olibanum, et myrrha, et sarcocolla, et acacia, et similia eis.	Consider therefore then, if the knot is recent: administer to it medicines that have a drying quality, such as aloe, and frankincense, and myrrh, and sarcocola, and acacia, and similar ones.
Ita, ut accipias ex istis quasdam, aut omnes eas: et confice eas cum uino stiptico, aut cum albumine oui, aut cum aceto: et pone eas super nodationem in stuppa, et stringe eas super ipsam strictura bona.	So, that you may receive some of these or all of them, and mix them with wine styptic, or with egg white, or with vinegar; and apply them to the swelling in the poultice, and bind them on with a good tight bandage.
Et dimitte stricturam, nec soluas eam diebus multis.	And leave the bandage on, without loosening it for many days.
Deinde solue eam, et itera aliam, donec remoueatur nodatio.	Then loosen it, and apply another, until the swelling is removed.
Aut stringe super ipsam laminam plumbi decenter.	Or bind a plate of lead over it, centered.
Plumbo enim est proprietas remouendi omne quod timetur ex membris.	For lead has the property of removing every swelling that is feared from the limbs.
Si autem nodatio iam in lapidem conuersa est, et stricta est, et festine prouocat necessitas ad auferendum eam: tunc finde super eam ex superiori parte eius, et incide superfluitatem eminentem: aut rade eam cum quibusdam rasoriis, donec remoueatur: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	But if the swelling has already turned to stone, and is hard, and necessity urgently demands its removal: then make an incision above it, and cut away the prominent excess; or scrape it off with certain scrapers, until it is removed: and take care of it, until it is healed.
Â¶ De curatione quando restauratur, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, non secundum naturam suam.	Concerning the cure when it is restored, and the limb remains subtle after that, not according to its own nature.
Caput XXII.	Chapter 22.
Quando restauratur fractura ossis, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, debile: tunc non fit illud nisi propter caussas multas.	When a fracture of the bone is restored, and the limb remains subtle and weak after that, then it does not become sound unless due to many causes.
Quarum una est, multitudo solutionis ligamenti et ligationis eius non secundum quod oportet: aut propter superfluitatem stricturae ligamentorum, donec prohibeatur nutrimentum currere ad membrum: aut propter multitudinem embrocationis superfluae in non sua hora: aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore infirmi, et debilitatem eius.	Of which one is, the multitude of solutions of the ligament and its binding not according to what is fitting; or because of the excess tightness of the ligaments, until it prohibits nourishment from flowing to the limb; or because of the multitude of superfluous embrocations at an unseasonable time; or because of the scarcity of blood in the weak body, and its debilitation.
Et curatio illius est, cibare infirmum, et tenerum facere corpus eius, donec multiplicetur sanguis in eo.	And the cure for it is to nourish the weak person, and to make their body tender, until the blood is multiplied in them.
Et administra balneum.	And administer a bath.
Et intromitte gaudium et laeticiam super eum.	And bring joy and cheerfulness upon him.
Deinde pone picem super membrum: ut attrahat pix ad ipsum nutrimentum multum.	Then apply pitch to the limb, so that it attracts much nourishment to itself.
Et assiduet embrocationem eius cum aqua tepida, donec currat nutrimentum, et redeat ad figuram suam naturalem.	And you should repeatedly apply a warm poultice of it with lukewarm water until it provides nourishment and returns to its natural shape.
Â¶ De curatione ossium fractorum quando restaurantur tortuose.	Concerning the treatment of fractured bones when they are restored to their proper alignment.
Caput XXIII.	Chapter 23.
Quando accidit membro iam restaurato post sanationem eius tortuositas, et eminentia ossi fracto, aut nodatio: et foedatur per illud forma membri, uerumtamen membrum non prohibetur ab operatione sua naturali: tunc non oportet ut recipias sermonem eius, qui existimat, ut frangatur membrum denuo.	When a member is restored after its healing, and its twistedness or prominence of the fractured bone or knot is evident, and it is deformed by that shape of the member, yet the member is not hindered from its natural operation: then it is not necessary to accept the advice of one who thinks that the member should be broken again.
Et iam fuerunt multi stolidorum medicorum et restauratorum, qui fecerunt illud in terra nostra.	And already there have been many foolish doctors and restorers who have done that in our land.
Et haec quidem operatio est uituperabilis ualde, perducens ad mortem, uel timorem magnum, ut scilicet sit mortalis.	And this operation is indeed detestable, leading to death or great fear, as it is mortal.
Verum si claudicatio et nodatio sunt recentes: tunc oportet, ut embrocetur cum aqua tepida, in qua decoctae sint herbae mollificantes, sicut folia alteae, et radix eius, et mellilotum, et illis similia.	But if the stiffness and knotting are recent: then it is necessary to apply a warm poultice with lukewarm water, in which are decocted softening herbs, such as the leaves of altea, and its root, and mellilotum, and similar things.
Et fiat ei emplastrum cum emplastro mollificatiuo, sicut dyachilon decenter factum.	And let a plaster be made for him with a softening plaster, such as a well-made diachylon.
Aut sumatur mucilago radicis alteae, et concutiatur cum adipe gallinae, aut oleo sisamino: et emplastretur cum eo.	Or let there be taken a mucilage of the root of altea, and let it be mixed with the fat of a hen or sesame oil: and let it be plastered on with that.
Aut sumantur ficus pingues, et terantur cum fimo columbino, et similibus eis quae nominantur ex medicinis diminuentes consolidationem.	Or let there be taken rich figs, and let them be crushed with dove's dung, and similar things which are named among medicines diminishing consolidation.
Et quandoque soluitur nodatio cum fricatione assidua, antiqua, et leni, quae fit cum manibus humidis.	And when the knot is loosened with gentle, prolonged, and gentle friction, which is done with moist hands.
Et administretur motus membri ad omnem partem in horis omnibus.	And let movement of the limb be administered to every part at all hours.
Si autem tortuositas iam antecessit, et fortis facta est, et conuersa est in lapidem, et prouocata est necessitas ad curatonem eius cum ferro: tunc oportet, ut secetur superius eius, et soluatur continuatio ossis, et incidatur quod superfluit ex nodatione aut osse cum Incisoriis subtilibus: et administretur facilitas in illo cum sollicitudine et studio.	If, however, the twistedness has already preceded and become strong, and has turned into a hardness, and necessity has been provoked to treat it with iron: then it is necessary to cut above it, and to release the continuity of the bone, and to remove what is superfluous from the knot or bone with subtle incisions: and to administer ease in that with solicitude and study.
Â¶ De sermone in Dislocatione.	On the treatment of dislocations.
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter 24.
Dislocatio est exitus alicuius iuncturarum a loco suo.	A dislocation is the exit of a joint from its proper place.
Quare prohibetur a motu suo, et foedatur figura membri.	Because it is prohibited from its movement, and the form of the limb is deformed.
Et facit accidere super infirmum dolores, et laesiones uehementes.	And it causes severe pains to occur in the weak parts, and violent injuries.
Quando ergo accidit alicui dislocatio, tunc oportet festinare ad restaurationem eius: neque tardet eam omnino.	When therefore a dislocation occurs, then it is necessary to hasten to its restoration: and not to delay it at all.
Nam si tardatur, apostematur locus, et fortasse cum eo reductio dislocationis.	For if it is delayed, the place becomes putrid, and perhaps with that the reduction of the dislocation will be more difficult.
Propter illud ergo non oportet, ut moueatur, neque extendatur in hora apostemationis eius.	On account of this, therefore, it is not fitting to move or stretch it during the time of its putridity.
Quoniam multotiens facit accidere spasmum, et dolores laedentes.	Since it often causes spasms and painful wounds.
Verum quando accidit illud, tunc oportet, ut properes ad phlebotomiam infirmi.	But when that happens, then it is necessary to resort to bloodletting of the affected part.
Deinde dimittatur, donec quiescat apostema.	Then it should be left alone until the putridity subsides.
Deinde embrocetur membrum cum aqua calida et oleo.	Then the limb should be anointed with warm water and oil.
Deinde reducatur cum facilitate.	Then it should be reduced with ease.
Et curetur omne membrum cum eo cuius rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And the whole limb should be treated with that which will bring its memory back to its proper place.
Ego quidem iam ordinaui capitula dislocationis, etiam secundum quod praecessit in fractura, a superiori parte corporis usque ad inferiorem eius.	I have now arranged the chapters on dislocations, and also according to what has been said previously about fractures, from the upper part of the body down to its lower part.
Â¶ De cura dislocationis Mandibulae inferioris.	On the treatment of dislocation of the lower jawbone.
Caput XXV.	Chapter 25.
Parum dislocantur duae Mandibulae nisi raro.	The two jawbones are rarely dislocated.
Et dislocatio ambarum fit secundum unum duoru modorum.	And the dislocation of both is done according to one of two methods.
Aut enim remouentur a locis suis remotione parua, et mollificantur parumper.	Or they are removed from their places with a small removal, and are softened for a short time.
Aut dislocantur dislocatione integra, completa, donec mollificentur ad partem pectoris, donec currat saliua infirmi, et non possit tenere eam, neque possit claudere os suum, et inuoluatur lingua eius cum sermone.	Or they are dislocated with a complete dislocation, until they become soft towards the chest part, until the saliva of the affected part flows, and it cannot hold it, nor can it close its mouth, and its tongue is entwined with speech.
Quando autem dislocatio eius est parua, tunc redit in pluribus dispositionibus per se cum paucitate.	When the dislocation of it is small, then it returns into many positions by itself with a few.
Si uero est dislocatio completa, integra: tunc oportet, ut administretur reductio eius uelociter, et non tardetur penitus: et est, ut teneat minister caput infirmi: et intromittat medicus pollicem manus suae unius in radicem Mandibulae dislocationis inter os eius, si dislocatio est a parte una.	If the dislocation is complete and entire: then it is necessary that the reduction of it should be administered quickly, and not delayed at all; and it is, as if to hold the head of the weak patient: and the physician inserts the thumb of his hand into the root of the jawbone at the point of the dislocation, if the dislocation is on one side.
Aut intromittat duos pollices suos simul, si dislocatio est a duabus partibus.	Or he inserts both thumbs together, if the dislocation is on both sides.
Et reliqui digiti manuum eius sint extra, quibus aequet.	And his remaining fingers of his hands are outside, which equalize.
Et praecipe infirmo, ut mundificet Mandibulas suas, et absoluat eas ad manducandum ad omnem partem.	And instruct the patient to clean their jawbones, and free them for chewing on all sides.
Et medicus aequet Mandibulam, et impellat Mandibulam, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And the physician equalizes the jawbone, and pushes the jawbone, until it returns to its place.
Quod si difficilis sit reductio eius, praecipue si sunt ambae Mandibulae simul: tunc administra uaporationem cum aqua calida, et oleo, donec fiat facilis reductio ambarum: neque tardes reductionem ambarum omnino, sicut diximus.	If the reduction of it is difficult, especially if both jawbones are together: then administer a fumigation with warm water and oil, until the reduction of both becomes easy: nor delay the reduction of both at all, as we have said.
Cum ergo redeunt et aequantur, et clauditur os infirmi, et non mollificantur: tunc pone super eas puluillos pannorum, cum ceroto quod sit factum ex cera: et oleo rosato.	When they return and are equalized, and the patient's mouth is closed, and not loosened: then put over them small pillows of cloth, with a cerate made from wax: and rose oil.
Deinde ligetur cum facilitate cum ligamentis mollibus.	Then bind it with ease using soft bandages.
Et sit somnus infirmi super dorsum suum: et caput eius sit stans inter duo puluinaria, ut non moueat ipsum ad dextram et sinistram: neque conetur, uel cogatur masticare aliquid: imo ponatur cibus eius sorbitio lenis, donec quando remouentur dolores, et nodatur Mandibula: tunc comedat quod uult, et administretur illud cum facilitate.	And let the patient sleep on their back: and his head should be positioned between two pillows, so that it does not move to the right or left: nor is it disturbed, or cogitated to chew anything: rather, let his food be given in a soft sorption, until when the pains are removed, and the jawbone is restored: then he can eat what he wants, and it should be administered with ease.
Non laboret super operationem oris sui apud comestionem et potum, et oscitationem, donec nodetur Mandibula, et sanetur.	He should not strain over the operation of his own mouth during eating and drinking, and kissing, until the jawbone is restored, and healed.
Quod si difficilis fiat reductio duarum Mandibuiarum, quando dislocantur in hora aliqua, et non conuertuntur ad loca sua: tunc multotiens accidunt inde febres, et soda assidua: et fortasse soluitur uenter infirmi, et fortasse uomit choleram puram.	What if the reduction of the two jaws becomes difficult when they are dislocated at some hour and do not return to their places: then often fevers and constant pains occur; and perhaps the weakened stomach is relaxed, and perhaps it vomits pure bile.
Cum ergo uides illud: tunc scias, quia est perditio, et multotiens moritur ille cui accidit illud in decem diebus.	Since you see that: then know that it is a loss, and often he dies who suffers that within ten days.
Â¶ De reducione dislocationis Furculae, et extremitatis humeri.	On the reduction of dislocation of the elbow, and of the extremity of the shoulder.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter 26.
Furcula quidem non dislocatur ex latere intrinseco, propter continuationem suam cum pectore.	The elbow indeed is not dislocated from the inner side, on account of its continuity with the chest.
Et dislocatur quandoque ad exteriora: et declaratur illud sensui.	And it is dislocated sometimes to the outer sides, and that is made clear by sensation.
Et restauratio eius est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat brachia sua.	And its restoration is, so that the weak person lies on his back, and stretches out his arms.
Deinde coarta locum cum palma tua coartatione forti, nam ipsa redibit.	Then you should bind the place with a strong bandage of your palm, for it will return to its position.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stringe eam.	Then put on top of it an emplaster, and poultices, and bind it tightly.
Extremitates uero eius quae sequuntur cubitum, et continuantur cum eo, non dislocantur, nisi raro.	The extremities that follow the elbow, and are continued with it, are not dislocated, unless rarely.
Quod si dislocatur die aliquo: tunc oportet, ut reducatur et aequetur secundum quod diximus, et quod praeparatur tibi.	What if it is dislocated at some time: then it is necessary that it be reduced and adjusted according to what we have said, and what has been prepared for you.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam.	Then put on top of it an emplaster, and poultices, and a strapping.
Et praecipe infirmo, adhaerere tranquillitati et quieti, donec sanetur.	And instruct the weak person to adhere to tranquility and quiet, until they are healed.
Et cum hac eadem curatione reducitur extremitas Humeri, quando separatur etiam a loco suo.	And with this same treatment, the extremity of the shoulder is reduced when it is separated from its place as well.
Â¶ De reductione dislocationis Humeri.	On the reduction of dislocation of the shoulder.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter 27.
Scias, quod Humerus non dislocatur, nisi secundum tres modos.	Know that the shoulder is not dislocated, except in three ways.
Quorum unus est, ut dislocetur ad partem titillici ad inferiora.	One of them is to be dislocated towards the lower part of the perineum.
Secundus est, ut dislocetur ad partem pectoris.	The second is to be dislocated towards the chest.
Et fortasse dislocatur ad superiorem partem Humeri: et illud fit raro.	And perhaps it is dislocated towards the upper part of the shoulder, and that rarely happens.
Et non dislocatur ad posteriora, propter spatulam.	And it is not dislocated towards the back, because of the blade.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora, propter neruos.	And it is not dislocated towards the front, because of the nerve.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur et egreditur ad inferiora uersus titillicum: praecipue in illis, quorum carnes sunt paucae.	And it is most often dislocated and protrudes towards the lower part near the perineum: especially in those whose flesh is sparse.
Quoniam egrediur in eis uelociter, et ingreditur uelociter.	Because it protrudes quickly in them, and is reduced quickly.
In illis autem quorum carnes sunt multae, est econtrario illius, scilicet quia egreditur cum difficultate, et ingreditur cum difficultate.	But in those whose flesh is abundant, it is the opposite of that, namely because it protrudes with difficulty, and is reduced with difficulty.
Et fortasse accidit quibusdam hominibus percussio, aut casus, et apostematur Humerus apostemate calido, et putatur propter illud, quia iam dislocatus est.	And perhaps it happens to some men that they receive a blow or a fall, and the shoulder is bruised by a hot aposteme, and it is thought because of that, that it was already dislocated.
Oportet ergo, ut experiaris illud, donec stes super certitudinem eius, et tunc procedas in curatione eius.	It is necessary, therefore, to examine it until you stand on certain knowledge of it, and then proceed with its cure.
Et cognoscitur dislocatio, quando est ad inferiora uersus titillicum: et distinguas inter Humerum dislocatum, et humerum sanum.	And the dislocation is recognized when it is towards the lower part near the perineum: and you distinguish between a dislocated shoulder and a healthy one.
Nam tu inuenis inter eos diuersitatem manifestam, et inuenis in capite Humeri concauitatem, et sub titillico apud tactum caput humeri quasi ipsum sit ouum: et non potest infirmus reducere manum ad aurem suam, neque mouere eam omnibus motibus.	For you find a clear difference between them, and you find concavity in the head of the shoulder, and under the perineum upon touching the head of the shoulder as if it were a socket: and the weak one cannot reduce his hand to his ear, nor move it with all its movements.
Et similiter, si dislocatur uersus pectus, aut ad sursum: tunc inuenis manifestum tactum, neque occultatur.	And similarly, if it is dislocated towards the chest or upwards: then you find a clear palpation, and it does not hide.
Et huius quidem dislocationis fit facilis reductio, quando est recens, aut infirmus est puer.	And of this dislocation, reduction is easy when it is recent, or the patient is a weak child.
Et reductio eius est, ut eleuet minister manum suam ad superiora.	And its reduction is to elevate the minister's hand towards the upper parts.
Deinde pone tu pollices tuos sub titillico eius, et eleua iuncturam cum fortitudine ad sursum ad locum suum: et minister eleuet manum suam, et extendat eam ad sursum.	Then place your fingers under the eyelid and join them with force upwards to their proper place: and let the hand serve and stretch it upwards.
Deinde ponat eam inferius, ipse enim redit uelociter.	Then put it downwards, for it returns quickly itself.
Si autem non redit per illud quod diximus, et sunt a principio quo accidit dislocatio dies multi: tunc oportet, ut balneetur infirmus in aqua calida, et administretur embrocatio quae mollificat et lenit, sicut si decoquantur radices alteae, et foenugraecum, et mellilotum in aqua, et administretur.	If it does not return through what we have said, and there are many days since the beginning of the dislocation: then it is necessary that the weakened part be bathed in warm water, and an embrocation which softens and soothes should be applied, such as if one were to decoct roots of altea, and fenugreek, and melilot in water, and apply it.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et ponatur sub titillico eius sphera et lana, quae sit aequalis inter lenitatem et stricturam.	Then the weakened part should be raised above its back: and a sphere and wool should be placed under the eyelid, which is equal between gentleness and tightness.
Deinde ponat medicus calcaneum suum super spheram, et eleuet caput humeri cum uirtute, et attrahat manum infirmi ad inferiora.	Then the doctor should place his heel on the sphere, and lift the head of the shoulder with force, and pull the weakened hand downwards.
Et minister alius teneat caput infirmi, ut non moueatur ad inferiora: ipse namque redit statim.	And another person should hold the weakened head, so that it does not move downwards: for it will return immediately.
Et si uis, reduc eum secundum modum hunc: et est, ut facias esse praesentem uirum qui sit longior infirmo, et stet a parte lateris, et intromittat humerum suum sub titillico infirmi: et eleuet titillicum eius ad superiora, donec sit infirmus suspensus in aere.	And if you wish, reduce him according to this method: and it is, that you should make the strong man present who is longer than the weakened one, and stand at his side, and insert his shoulder under the eyelid of the weakened one: and lift the eyelid upwards, until the weakened one is suspended in the air.
Et minister alius trahat manum infirmi ad inferiora uentris eius.	And another person should pull the weakened hand downwards towards his belly.
Si autem infirmus est leuis: tunc oportet, ut suspendatur cum eo aliquid aliud, ut grauet ipsum: nam redit dislocatio statim.	If the weakened one is light: then it is necessary that something else be suspended with him to weigh him down: for the dislocation returns immediately.
Et reducitur etiam secundum modum alium: et est, ut figatur in terra lignum longum, cuius caput sit rotundum figura: sicut manica mortarii: quod non sit grossum, neque subtile.	And it is reduced also according to another method: and it is, that a long wooden stick is fixed in the ground, whose head has a round figure: like a mason's hand protector: which should not be thick, nor too subtle.
Deinde ponatur sub infirmo postquam ponuntur super caput ligni panni lenes: et infirmus sit stans secundum longitudinem ligni.	Then soft cloths should be placed under the weakened part after they are placed on top of the wooden head, and the weakened one should stand according to the length of the wood.
Deinde extendatur manus eius ad inferiora a parte altera, et extendatur corpus eius ab altera parte cum fortitudine: nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then his hand is extended to the lower part of another, and his body is strengthened from the other side with force: for the joint returns to its place with swiftness.
Quod si difficilis sit eius reductio per omnia quae diximus, tunc utere hac cura: et est, ut accipias lignum cuius longitudo sit quantitas duorum brachiorum, et eius latitudo quantitas quatuor digitorum, et grossitudo eius quantitas duorum digitorum: cui sit caput rotundum, ut alleuietur introitus eius in profundum titillici, secundum hanc formam.	What if his reduction is difficult through all that we have said, then use this care: and it is, to take a stick whose length is the measure of two arms, and its width the measure of four fingers, and its thickness the measure of two fingers: which has a round head, so that its entrance into the deep wound may be alleviated according to this form.
Deinde ligentur super caput rotundum panni lenes, ut non laedat lignum infirmum.	Then fine linen cloths are tied over the round head, so that they do not harm the weakened limb.
Deinde ponatur sub titillico infirmi, ut extendatur manus, aut brachium super lignum usque ad inferiora: et ligetur lignum super adiutorium et brachium et extremitatem manus.	Then it should be placed under the weakened limb, so that the hand or arm is extended over the stick up to the lower parts: and the stick is tied over the assistant and arm and extremity of the hand.
Deinde ponatur brachium super gradum scalae per latitudinem, et extendatur manus ad inferiora, et dimittatur reliquum corpus suspensum a parte altera.	Then the arm should be placed on a step of a ladder by its width, and the hand is extended to the lower parts, and the rest of the body is suspended hanging from the other side.
Iunctura enim ingreditur statim.	For the joint indeed grows strong immediately.
Cum ergo completur introitus eius secundum quemcunque modum possibile est: tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico spheram aequalis quantitatis ex lana.	When therefore the entrance is completed according to whatever method is possible: then it is necessary to place under the limb a ball of equal size made from wool.
Deinde pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum olibano, et albumine oui super humerum totum, sicut reuoluitur desuper.	Then place the prepared plaster made from mill dust with olive oil, and egg whites over the entire shoulder, as it revolves from above.
Deinde stringe sub titillico strictura decenti: et reuoluatur ligamentum super emplastrum desuper: et annectatur manus eius ad collum ipsius, et dimittatur, neque moueatur manus eius septem diebus.	Then bind underneath the limb a suitable bandage: and the ligament is revolved over the plaster from above: and his hand is attached to his neck, and let it be left untouched, so that his hand is not moved for seven days.
Et oportet, ut ponatur cibus infirmipaucus, donec confortetur membrum: quoniam est uelocius ad sanationem eius.	And it is necessary to put nourishing food in small amounts, until the limb is comforted: because it is faster for its healing.
Deinde ponatur amplior post septem dies, aut quinque, et ex ercitetur cum motu.	Then a larger one should be placed after seven days, or five, and exercised with movement.
Si ergo firmatur et non mollificatur, tunc iam sanatus est.	If it is then strengthened and not softened, then he is already healed.
Si uero iunctura dislocatur multotiens, propter humiditatem quae accidit ei, aut propter caussam aliam: tunc oportet, ut administretur in ea cauterium cum tribus foraminibus, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo de cauterio.	If the joint is dislocated many times, either because of the humidity that happens to it, or because of another cause: then it is necessary to apply a cautery with three openings, according to what was previously stated in the chapter on cautery.
Quod si fiat hoc totum, et soluatur ligamentum post septem dies, et non confirmetur iunctura, et reducatur emplastrum et strictura super ipsum aliquotiens, et non firmetur, et cadat, et non possit eleuare ipsum ad superiora: tunc scias, quod nerui eius qui sunt ad caput humeri, iam incisi sunt, aut extensi, aut mollificati: et scias, quod iunctura nunquam figetur in loco suo.	If this whole thing is done, and the ligament is released after seven days, and the joint is not strengthened, and the plaster and bandage are applied many times over it, and it does not become firm, and it falls, and cannot be lifted up to its original position: then know that the nerves which are at the head of the humerus have been cut, or stretched, or softened: and know that the joint will never be fixed in its place.
Dislocationis autem quae fit uersus pectus et mammillam, aut ad posteriora reductio, fit cum impulsione et extensione cum manibus: donec redeat, et administretur in ea reliqua strictura et cura, donec sanetur.	Dislocations which occur towards the chest and nipple, or towards the back, are reduced with a thrust and extension using the hands; until it returns to its place, and the remaining bandage and care are applied, until it is healed.
Quod si accidat post sanationem grauitas in membro, et tarditas in motu eius, tunc utatur infirmus balneo multotiens, donec leniatur illa grauitas, et redeat ad naturam eius primam.	If after healing there occurs heaviness in the limb and slowness in its movement, then let him use a warm bath many times, until that heaviness is alleviated, and it returns to its original natural state.
Â¶ De curatione dislocationis Cubiti.	Concerning the treatment of dislocations of the elbow.
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter 28.
Scias, quod iunctura Cubiti dislocatur cum difficultate, et similiter redit cum difficultate etiam: et ipsa quidem dislocatur ad omnes partes, et praecipue ad anteriorem, aut ad posteriorem.	Know that the joint of the elbow is dislocated with difficulty, and similarly returns with difficulty also: and it itself indeed dislocates to all parts, and especially to the front or to the back.
Et eius dislocatio non occultatur tibi: quoniam est cadens sub uisu, et sub tactu, secundum quamcunque figuram dislocetur.	And its dislocation is not hidden from you: because it is evident under observation and under touch, according to whatever shape it has been dislocated.
Et quando coniungis cubitum dislocatum cum sano, declaratur tibi illud manifeste.	And when you compare the dislocated elbow with a healthy one, that becomes clearly evident to you.
Concauatur enim iunctura, et non potest duplicare brachium, neque tangere cum eo humerum suum.	For the joint is concussed, and it cannot bend the arm, nor touch its own shoulder with it.
Et oportet, ut properes, et reducas dislocationem statim, antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And it is necessary, so that the swelling subsides, and you reduce the dislocation immediately, before a warm aposteme develops.
Nam si accidit ei apostema calidum, difficilis fit eius reductio: et fortasse non sanatur omnino, praecipue quando est ad posteriora.	For if a warm aposteme develops, its reduction becomes difficult: and perhaps it will not be fully healed, especially when it is on the back.
Est enim deterior omnibus speciebus dislocationis, et uehementioris doloris eis: et multotiens descendit cum ea mors.	For it is worse than all kinds of dislocations, and more severe pain accompanies them: and many times it ends in death with them.
Et restauratio eius quando est ex eis quae possibile est reducere, est, ut extendatur manus eius cum duabus manibus: et brachium eius sit expansum, et manus medici sint supra cubitum et sub eo, et ipse impellat iuncturam cum pollicibus manuum suarum simul, aut cum radice palmae suae, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And its restoration, when it is one of those that can be reduced, is to extend his hand with both hands: and his arm should be stretched out, and the doctor's hands should be above the elbow and below it, and he himself presses the joint with his thumbs or with the heel of his palm, until it returns to its place.
Aut uero dislocatio est ad anteriora: tunc redit ita, ut duplicet manum cum manu sua, donec percutiat cum radice palmae suae cubitum qui est dislocatus.	Or indeed the dislocation is to the front: then he returns thus, that he doubles his hand with his own hand, until he strikes with the heel of his palm the elbow that is dislocated.
Quod si non obedit dislocatio ad reductionem, tunc administra extensionem uehementem, fortem ualde: et est, ut extendant brachium duo ministri: et teneant ipsum duo ministri etiam, ut non remoueatur apud extensionem.	What if the dislocation does not obey the reduction, then administer a strong and forceful extension: and it is, that two assistants stretch out the arm: and two assistants hold it also, so that it is not moved away during the extension.
Deinde reuoluatur brachium ad omnem partem postquam inuoluitur super manum eius pannus duplicatus longus, aut ligamentum latum.	Then the arm is wrapped around to every part after a long, doubled cloth or a broad bandage is applied over his hand.
Et quando tangit medicus manu sua iuncturam, inungat ipsam cum oleo: ut sit illud ex eis quae adiuuant in lubricitate iuncturae cum facilitate.	And when the doctor touches the joint with his hand, he anoints it with oil: so that it is one of those things that help to lubricate the joint and facilitate its movement.
Deinde impellat iuncturam impulsione uehementi, donec redeat.	Then he presses the joint with a strong impulse, until it returns.
Et post reductionem eius oportet, ut ponatur super ipsam emplastrum, in quo sit stipticitas, et exiccatio cum albugine oui: et stringatur strictura decenti.	And after its reduction, it is necessary to apply a plaster over it, on which there is a stiptic, and an extract with albumen of egg white: and a suitable bandage should be tightly bound.
Et suspendatur brachium a collo infirmi: et dimitte diebus aliquot.	And the arm should be suspended from the neck of the patient: and left for some days.
Deinde soluatur.	Then it is dissolved.
Si ergo firmatur iunctura in loco suo, tunc solue ligamentum ab ea, et dimitte ipsam.	If then it becomes firm in its place, then dissolve the ligament from it, and let it go.
Et si uides iuncturam non bene stringi, tunc itera emplastrum, et ligamentum, et dimitte ipsam diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	And if you see the joint is not well strung, then apply an emplaster, and a ligament, and let it go for some days, until it becomes strung.
Deinde solue ipsam.	Then dissolve it.
Si autem accidit ei grauitas post reductionem iuncturae, et dispositio sit in motu: tunc administra humectationem in balneatione, et fricationem subtilem, et compressionem, donec liniatur, aut pone super iuncturam iliati, id est, natem arietis pinguem.	If however a heaviness occurs to it after the reduction of the joint, and the arrangement is in motion: then administer humidification in bathing, and subtle friction, and compression, until it becomes thin, or place over the affected joint a thick and greasy ointment, that is, a rich and fatty one.
Deinde ligetur, et dimitte ipsam super eam die et nocte.	Then bind it, and let it go on it for a day and night.
Deinde aufer eam, et intromitte ipsum in balneum.	Then remove it, and introduce it into a bath.
Cum ergo sudat, tunc frica iuncturam fricatione temperata.	When it sweats, then rub the joint with moderate friction.
Deinde itera super ipsam aleliati uice una, et secunda, et tertia cum introitu balnei, donec leniatur.	Then apply an ointment over it one day, and a second, and a third, when entering the bath, until it becomes thin.
Et si uis, pone super ipsam stercus uaccinum, humidum, calefactum cum butyro, et stringe super ipsum.	And if you wish, place over it a warm, moist, and heated poultice with butter, and bind it above.
Fac illud aliquotiens.	Do that several times.
Ipsa namque lenitur, et redit ad dispositionem suam.	It becomes thin, and returns to its own arrangement.
Â¶ De curatione dislocationis Almahassem.	On the treatment of dislocations by Almahassem.
Caput XXIX.	Chapter 29.
Mahassem manus multotiens dislocatur, id est, iunctura quae est inter brachium et manum.	Almahassem's hand is often dislocated, that is, the joint which is between the arm and the hand.
Et reductio dislocationis eius est facilis.	And the reduction of its dislocation is easy.
Econtrario reliquarum iuncturarum.	Unlike other joints.
Verumtamen oportet, ut uelocitas sit in reductione dislocationis eius in hora in qua dislocatur, antequam apostemetur locus: aut accidat in eo apostema calidum.	However, it is necessary that there be speed in the reduction of its dislocation at the hour in which it becomes dislocated, before the place becomes inflamed; or else a hot abscess occurs.
Et reductio dislocationis in eo est, ut ponas Mahassem manus infirmae super tabulam, et extendat minister manum eius: et ponat medicus palmam suam super eminentiam iuncturae, et impellat eam, donec redeat.	And the reduction of the dislocation in it is, that you place the weak hand of Mahassem on a table, and extend the serving hand; and the physician places his palm over the prominence of the joint, and presses it, until it returns to its place.
Verumtamen oportet, ut consyderetur, si palma iam recessit ad uentrem manus: tunc ponat infirmus dorsum manus suae super tabulam apud extensionem et reductionem: et si dislocatio est procedens ad dorsum manus, tunc sit positio manus eius intrinsece super tabulam, id est, interior pars manus eius super tabulam ponatur, ut cadat manus medici super ipsam eminentiam iuncturae.	However, it is necessary to consider if the palm has already receded to the ventral part of the hand: then the weakened back of the hand should be placed on a table at the point of extension and reduction: and if the dislocation progresses towards the back of the hand, then the hand itself should be placed on the table internally, that is, the inner part of the hand should be placed on the table, so that the doctor's hand falls onto the same prominence of the joint.
Si ergo redit statim, bonum est: et si non, tunc stringe eam cum emplastro sedante apostema: et dimitte ipsum, neque iteres illud.	If it returns immediately, that is good: and if not, then bind it with a plaster, applying a poultice to the affected area: and leave it alone, do not disturb it again.
Nam si non tolerat, neque potes super reductionem eius, postquam praetereunt ei dies, uerumtamen iunctura remanet secundum tortuositatem suam: et non nocet infirmo aliquid, nisi quod mollificatur manus, et non potest stringere aliquid: tunc scias, quod nerui sunt abscissi, aut attriti.	For if it does not tolerate, nor can you put it back into reduction after the days have passed, yet truly the joint remains according to its own twisted nature: and it does not harm the weakened part unless the hand is softened, and cannot grasp anything: then know that the nerves are cut off or worn away.
Non est ergo ingenium in ea, nisi ut stringatur cum cauterio prope casum eius.	There is no ingenuity in it, except to bind it with a cautery near the fracture itself.
Et fortasse non confert illud aliquid.	And perhaps it does not help at all.
Cum ergo non redit Almahassem, tunc pone super ipsum emplastrum, quod narrauimus.	Since therefore Almahassem's method did not work, then put on it the plaster that we have described.
Deinde stringatur, et dimittatur quinque diebus: postea soluatur et dimittatur, et exercitetur manus.	Then bind it, and leave it for five days: afterwards unbind it and leave it, and exercise the hand.
Si autem priuatur motus eius, et accidat in ea aliquid grauitatis: tunc leni eam cum aqua calefacta, et fricatione aliquotiens, donec leniatur.	If, however, the motion of it is impaired, and some heaviness occurs in it: then soothe it with warm water, and rub it gently several times, until it is soothed.
Â¶ De curatione dislocationis Digitorum.	On the treatment of dislocations of the fingers.
Caput XXX.	Chapter 30.
Quando dislocatur ex eis Digitus ad omnem partem, uel ex eis Digitus ad dorsum palmae, aut uentrem eius: tunc extende Digitum, et impelle dislocationem pollicibus tuis, donec redeat.	When a finger is dislocated from its place, whether from the back of the hand or from the palm, then extend the finger and push the dislocation back into place with your thumbs, until it returns to its proper position.
Deinde sustenta caput Digiti, et suspende ipsum uersus partem ad quam dislocatur, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	Then hold the tip of the finger and suspend it towards the part from which it was dislocated, and leave it for two days.
Deinde suspende eum, et extende ipsum, donec aequetur rectus in illo die suo.	Then hang him upside down and stretch him out until he becomes straight on that day.
Cum ergo fuerit nox, liga ipsum secundum narrationem ipsam: et non cesses soluere ipsum in die: et exerce eum cum motu: et liga ipsum in nocte.	When therefore the night has become calm, bind him according to that same narrative; and do not cease to release him during the day; and exercise him with movement; and bind him at night.
Fac illud diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	Do that for several days, until it is strengthened.
Et similiter fac cum eo, si dislocatur ad uentrem manus: et liga eum ad partem ipsam, et fac cum eo operationem tuam primam, donec sanetur.	And do likewise with him, if the hand is dislocated towards the belly; and bind him to that same part, and perform your first operation on him, until he is healed.
Et similiter fac cum eo quando dislocatur ad reliquas partes.	And do likewise with him when it is dislocated towards the other parts.
Â¶ De curatione dislocationis Spondilium dorsi.	Concerning the treatment of a dislocation of the vertebrae of the back.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter 31.
Quando accidit alicui Spondilium dorsi, aut colli dislocatio completa, aut remouentur Spondiles multae a locis suis: tunc non est in ea curatio, quoniam mors properat infirmo.	When it happens to someone that the vertebrae of the back are completely dislocated, or many vertebrae are removed from their places: then there is no cure for it, because death quickly follows the sick person.
Et signum illius est, quod egestio infirmi egreditur absque uoluntate, neque potest tenere eam: et multotiens mollificantur ex eo quaedam membra eius, aut duo crura eius, aut duo brachia ipsius, aut unum eorum: aut remouetur Spondilis una de loco suo.	And the sign of this is that the sick person's excrement comes out without their will, nor can they hold it in; and often certain members of theirs become weak because of it, such as one of his legs, or two arms, or one of them; or a vertebra is removed from its place.
Multotiens enim remouetur, quod multotiens fit remotio earum ad quatuor partes.	For often it happens that they are removed, because often the removal occurs to four parts.
Illa ergo quae remouetur ad posteriora, nominatur Gibbositas.	Therefore, those which are removed towards the back are called Humpbackedness.
Curatio uero eius est, ut consyderes tunc, si Gibbositas accidit a puericia: tunc non est in ea curatio, neque ex ea est sanatio omnino.	The treatment of it is, that you should consider then, if Humpbackedness occurs from childhood; then there is no cure for it, nor is there any healing from it at all.
In illa autem quae accidit a casu, aut percussione, aut similibus illis, iam dixerunt antiqui modos curationis sermone prolixo.	But in those cases which occur from a fall, or a blow, or similar things, the ancient authorities have already spoken of methods of treatment in a lengthy discourse.
Cuius plurimum non redit cum proficuo.	Whose benefit does not return with profit.
Ego uero iam abbreuiaui ex illo, cuius parum excusat a multo eius ex propinquitate mea ad intentionem: et expositione mea qua exposui illud, et formaui instrumentum eius diuerso modo ab eo quo ostenderunt illud, et exposuerunt ipsum.	I have already abbreviated it from that which excuses little of its multitude by reason of my proximity to the intention, and I have set forth my explanation in a way different from what they showed and explained.
Dico ergo, quod in gibbositate quae accidit ab anteriori parte, non est ingenium, neque sanatio ex ea.	I say therefore that which happens in the case of a gibbosity that occurs from the front part, it is not an ingenuity, nor a healing from it.
Et similiter in illa quae fit ad duo latera etiam.	And similarly in that which happens to both sides as well.
Et non curatur ex eis, nisi illa quae accidit in dorso proprie, cum eo quod ego narro: et est, ut extendatur infirmus super faciem suam super podium aequale prope parietem: et expandatur sub eo stramentum humidum, ut non laedatur pectus eius.	And it is not treated from them, unless that which happens in the back proper, as I describe: and it is that the weak person is stretched out on their face on a level podium near a wall; and a humid cloth is spread under them, so that their chest is not harmed.
Deinde ponatur lignum rectum fixum in fouea in terra, in extremitate podii, circiter caput eius: et lignum aliud circiter pedes eius in extremitate altera podii: et minister teneat lignum, et sit non firmatum in fouea.	Then a straight stick is placed fixed in the ground at the end of the podium, around their head: and another stick around their feet at the other end of the podium: and the attendant holds the stick, and it should not be fixed to the ground.
Et minister alter teneat alterum.	And another attendant holds the other one.
Deinde inuolue super caput infirmi, et sub titillicis eius ligamentum lene, firmum: et extende extremitatem ligamenti ad lignum quod est apud caput eius: et liga ipsum in eo.	Then a soft cloth is wrapped around the head of the weak person, and under their eyelids a gentle bandage, firm: and stretch out the extremity of the bandage to the stick that is by their head: and tie it there.
Deinde stringe ligamentum aliud supra anchas eius, et supra genua ipsius, et apud cauillas eius.	Then tie another bandage above their ankles, and above their knees, and at their calves.
Deinde aggrega ligamenta omnia, et liga ea in ligno altero quod est apud pedes eius.	Then gather all the bandages together, and tie them to the other stick that is by their feet.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem ligni ligamentum, et non remoueantur duo ligna ex locis suis in quibus sunt fixa: uerumtamen non sint firmata, sicut diximus.	Then all the attendants stretch out to the part of the stick with the bandage, and the two sticks are not removed from their places where they are fixed: however, they should not be fastened, as we said.
Et medicus ponat palmas suas super Spondilem cum fortitudine, donec redeat: aut ponat super eam tabulam.	And the doctor should place their hands on the vertebra with strength, until it returns to its place: or he should place it on a tablet.
Deinde annectat super tabulam pedes suos, donec redeat.	Then he attaches his feet to the tablet, until it returns to its place.
Si autem non redit per hanc curationem, tunc accipe tabulam cuius longitudo sit circiter tria brachia.	But if it does not return to its place through this treatment, then take a tablet whose length is around three arm's spans.
Et caua in pariete de quo diximus quod est prope infirmum, locum in quem ingrediatur extremitas tabulae.	And let it be attached to the wall that we mentioned, which is near the weak person, a place where the extremity of the tablet can enter.
Deinde pone medium tabulae super Spondilem.	Then place a middle layer on the vertebrae.
Et ponat pedes suos medicus super extremitatem alteram.	And let the physician place his feet on the other extremity.
Et stringat bene, donec coartetur Spondilis, et redeat ad locum suum.	And bind well, until the vertebra is straightened, and returns to its place.
Deinde si uis, operare cum torno quod inuoluitur cum manu tua: et est, ut figas in terram apud caput infirmi in postremo podii duo ligna, quorum longitudo sit brachii unius: et apud caput eius in postremo podii duo ligna.	Then if necessary, operate with a turning instrument that is wrapped around your hand; and it is, as you fix two wooden rods on the ground at the head of the patient, near the end of the bed, each the length of one arm; and similarly, at the head of the patient, near the end of the bed, two wooden rods.
Et sit longitudo quae est inter omne lignum palmus unus: et iam factum est in omni loco foramen, in quo currit tornum: et firmetur lignum omne in terra multum, ne moueatur omnino.	And let the length between each wooden rod be one palm; and now a hole has been made in every place where the turning instrument runs; and all the wood is firmly fixed to the ground, so that it does not move at all.
Et intromittatur lignum rotundum: et est tornum in quo reuoluitur ligamentum in duobus foraminibus duorum lignorum.	And a round wooden rod is inserted; and it is a turning instrument where the bandage revolves in two holes of the two wooden rods.
Et in extremitate eius est foramen, in quo firmatur lignum, cuius longitudo est palmus cum eo quod reuoluitur: et in duobus lignis aliis est similiter illius.	And on the extremity of it there is a hole where the wood is fastened, whose length is one palm with that which revolves; and similarly, on the two other wooden rods there are those like it.
Deinde stringe ligamenta quae strinxisti in pectore infirmi torno quod est apud caput eius: et ligamenta quae strinxisti in cruribus eius in torno quod est apud pedes eius.	Then bind the bandages that you fastened on the chest of the patient with the turning instrument that is at his head; and the bandages that you fastened on his legs with the turning instrument that is at his feet.
Deinde stet apud omne tornum minister, qui torqueat manum suam cum licinio, cum quo reuoluitur tornum: et medicus aequet Spondilem, secundum quod diximus.	Then stand beside each turning instrument, the assistant who twists his hand with a cloth, with which the turning instrument revolves; and the physician sets the vertebrae straight, according to what we have said.
Haec est forma torni, quae sequitur.	This is the form of the turning instrument, which follows.
Deinde postquam redit Spondilis, et aequatur locus, tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum exiccatiuum cum albumine oui.	Then after the vertebra has returned and the place is set straight, then it is necessary to apply an evacuating plaster with egg white.
Deinde stuppam.	Then a poultice.
Postea pone supra emplastrum astellam ex tabula, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, aut circiter eos.	Afterwards, place above the plaster a small plate made of wood, whose width is three fingers, or around that.
Et longitudo eius quantitas quae capiat locum Gibbositatis, et super partem Spondilis sanae.	And its length is a quantity that occupies the space of Gibbosity, and above the healthy part of the spine.
Deinde ligetur cum ligamento quod diximus.	Then it should be tied with a ligament that we have mentioned.
Et utatur infirmus nutrimento subtili, donec sanetur.	And let the weak person be nourished with subtle food, until he is healed.
Quod si remaneat quiddam eminentiae in loco in fine sanationis: tunc oportet, ut administrentur medicinae quae mollificant, et leniunt, cum administratione tabulae quam narrauimus tempore longo.	What if something remains prominent in the place at the end of healing: then it is necessary to administer medicines that soften and alleviate, with the administration of a regimen which we have described for a long time.
Et iam administratur in illo lamina plumbi.	And now let it be applied on that plate of lead.
Et quandoque accidit eminentia in postremo Spondilium dorsi: et putatur per eam dislocatio, et est illud os quod iam eminet.	And when there occurs a prominence on the posterior vertebrae of the back: and it is thought to be a dislocation through that, and it is that bone which now protrudes.
Quare non oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei cum hac medicina: fortasse enim accidere faciet mortem.	Therefore it is not suitable to make a supposition with this medicine: perhaps indeed it may cause death.
Â¶ De curatione Anchae dislocatae.	Concerning the treatment of a dislocated ankle.
Caput XXXII.	Chapter 32.
Scias, quod iuncturae Anchae, et iuncturae humeri, non accidit, nisi dislocatio tantum: neque accidit eis quod accidit reliquis iuncturis ex remotione parua, et concauitate.	You know that the joints of the ankle and the joints of the shoulder do not occur unless there is a dislocation only: nor does it occur to them what occurs to other joints from a small removal and concussion.
Et iunctura quidem Anchae dislocatur secundum quatuor partes.	And indeed, the ankle joint is dislocated according to four parts.
Quod est, quia dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	Which is, because it is dislocated forward and backward.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur ad interiora: et parum dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	And indeed it is most often dislocated inwardly: and less often dislocated forward and backward.
Et curatio dislocationis eius ad interiora, est: quia quando tu coniungis crus infirmi sanum cum infirmo, est longius: et est genu eius eminens plus quam sani, et non potest infirmus duplicare pedem suum apud inguen: et est locus qui sequitur inguen apostematus apostemate calido, propterea, quod caput coxae iam peruenit illic.	And the treatment of its inward dislocation is this: because when you join the weak leg with the healthy one, it is longer: and the knee of that one is more prominent than the healthy one, and the weak one cannot bend his foot at the groin: and there is a place that follows the groin, which is affected by a warm poultice, therefore, because the head of the hip has already reached there.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad exteriora est, quod sunt accidentia eius contraria istis accidentibus.	And the sign of one who suffers from outward dislocation is that its symptoms are contrary to these symptoms.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad anteriora, est, quia expandit crus sanum secundum complementum: uerumtamen non duplicat ipsum absque dolore qui est in genu: et si conatur ad ambulandum, non potest super illud ad anteriora: et retinetur urina eius, et apostematur inguen eius, et apud ambulationem est calcatio eius super calcaneum.	And the sign of him to whom it happens that there is a dislocation to the front is that he stretches out his healthy leg according to its complement; however, he does not duplicate it without pain which is in his knee. And if he tries to walk, he cannot step over it towards the front; and his urine is retained, and his groin is afflicted, and during walking there is bruising on his heel.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad posteriora est, ut non expandat genu, neque possit duplicare ipsum antequam duplicet inguen: et est crus eius etiam breuius altero: et inguen est mollificatum, et est caput coxae apud locum ilii.	And the sign of him to whom it happens that there is a dislocation to the back is that he does not stretch out his knee, nor can he duplicate it before he duplicates his groin; and his leg is also shorter than the other; and his groin is softened, and the head of his hip joint is at the place of the ilium.
Reductio uero huius dislocationis specierum est, ut consyderes tunc, si dislocatio est uetusta, quae iam antiquatur cum habente ipsam.	The reduction of this type of dislocation is thus, that you should consider then, if the dislocation is old, which has already become habitual with its possessor.
Deinde si tu administres reductionem eius, et remanet secundum dispositionem suam: tunc non est in ea curatio omnino.	Then if you administer its reduction, and it remains according to its own disposition: then there is no cure at all in that.
Non ergo oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei penitus.	Therefore it is not fitting, that a deep supuration should be formed for him.
In illo autem cuius dislocatio est recens, et est ex una specierum quatuor dislocationis: tunc propera ad hoc, ut uoluas iuncturam, et extendas ipsam ad interiora et ad exteriora, et moueas eam dextra et sinistra: fortasse enim redit, et non indiget alia cura.	In that case where the dislocation is recent and is one of the four species of dislocations, then it is proper to proceed thus, so that you may join the ends together, and extend it to the interior and exterior, and move it to the right and left: for perhaps it will return to its place, and does not require another treatment.
Si autem non redit hoc modo, tunc oportet, ut praepares ministrum fortem, et extendat crus eius ab inferiori parte: aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento, quod ligetur super crus eius supra genu: et minister alius extendat manum eius desuper, ita ut intromittat manus suas sub titillicis eius.	If, however, it does not return in this way, then it is necessary to prepare a strong assistant, and to extend his leg from the lower part: either with his own hands, or with a bandage, which is tied above his knee; and another assistant extends his hand from above, so that he may insert his hands under his buttocks.
Deinde stringat cum ligamento leni super radicem coxae, et teneat extremitatem ligamenti alterius.	Then he should bind with a soft bandage around the root of the hip, and hold the end of the other bandage.
Et sit extensio eius aut ab anteriori parte inguinis ad partem furculae, aut a posteriori ad partem dorsi.	And let the extension be either from the front of the groin to the part of the flank, or from the back to the part of the back.
Et sit extensio eorum omnium uice una, donec eleuetur infirmus cum corpore suo a terra, et remaneat pendens.	And let there be an extension of all their fibers together, until the weak part is lifted with its body from the ground, and remains hanging.
Et haec enim species extensionis est species communis specierum quatuor.	For this indeed is a type of extension, which is a common type of the four types.
Si ergo redit dislocatio cum eo quod diximus, est bonum: et si non, tunc necesse est omni speciei illud quod dicam de curatione propria.	If therefore the dislocation returns with what we have said, it is good; and if not, then it is necessary for every type of that which I will say about its proper cure.
In reductione quidem eius propria quando dislocatio est ad interiora, oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super latus suum sanum.	In the reduction of this very thing, when the dislocation is inward, it is necessary that the weak part be placed upon its healthy side.
Deinde ponat ligamentum super radicem coxae, in eo quod est inter caput coxae, et locum qui est sub inguine.	Then a bandage should be placed over the root of the hip, where it is between the head of the hip and the place that is beneath the groin.
Deinde extende ligamentum ad sursum a parte inguinis ad altiorem partem corporis, ad partem furculae.	Then extend the bandage upward from the part of the groin to the higher part of the body, to the part of the fork (of the thigh).
Deinde accipiat minister alius fortis brachia eius, et minuat locum grossum coxae infirmae, et extendat ad exteriora extensione uehementi.	Then another strong assistant should take his arms, and reduce the thick place of the hip that is weak, and stretch it outward with a vigorous extension.
Iam enim redit ad locum suum.	Now indeed it returns to its own place.
Et haec species est facilioris reliquis speciebus curationis, qua reducitur hoc membrum.	And this type is easier than the remaining types of cure, in which this limb is reduced.
Si autem excusatur super te, et non obedit tibi ad introitum cum hac specie curationis omnino: tunc oportet, ut ligentur duo pedes infirmi simul cum ligamento forti, leni, super duos calcaneos, et super duo genua: et sit longitudo cuiusque a compare suo quantitatis quatuor digitorum: et sit crus infirmum extensum plus altero quantitate duorum digitorum.	But if it is elevated above you and does not obey you at the entrance with this type of cure altogether: then it is necessary that two weak feet be bound together with a strong, gentle bandage, over the two heels, and over the two knees; and let the length of each be equal to its own quantity of four fingers; and let the weak leg be extended more by the quantity of two fingers.
Deinde suspendatur infirmus super caput ligni, quod sit in domo: et sit longitudo eius a terra quantitas duorum brachiorum.	Then the weak one should be suspended over a beam of wood, which is in the house; and let its length from the ground be the quantity of two arms.
Deinde praecipe iuueni forti, ut muniat caput coxae: et suspendatur cum infirmo inuenis alius: et impellat iuuenis alius, muniens coxam cum fortitudine, nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then order a strong youth to support the head of the hip; and let him be suspended with the weak one; and another youth should push, strengthening the hip with force, for the joint returns to its own place with speed.
In reditione autem eius propria, quando est dislocatio ad exteriora, oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super podium, secundum quod narrauimus in habente gibbositatem.	In the reduction of it [the bone] to its proper place, when there is a dislocation to the outside, it is necessary that the weak person should be placed on a stool, according to what we have described in the case of one having a hump.
Et stringatur ligamentum super crus eius, infirmum proprie, et super pectus eius.	And let the bandage be tightened over his leg, the weak person's own, and over his chest.
Deinde ponantur duo ligna, unum apud pedes eius, et alterum apud caput ipsius.	Then two wooden boards should be placed, one at his feet and another at his head.
Deinde ponatur lignum additum in medio podii, fixum bene: super quod inuoluti sint panni humidi, ut non laedat infirmum: et sit lignum inter coxas eius, ut non attrahatur ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then a wooden board should be placed in the middle of the stool, fixed well: upon which wet cloths are wrapped, so that they do not hurt the weak person: and let the board be between his hips, so that it does not attract to the lower parts during extension.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem suam, et medicus aequet reductionem manu sua.	Then everyone assisting should pull to their own part, and the doctor should complete the reduction with his hand.
Si ergo obedit ad reuersionem, erit bonum.	If it thus obeys to reversion, it will be good.
Et si non, pone super ipsam tabulam, et preme ipsam, sicut diximus in gibbositate, aequaliter.	And if not, place on that table, and press it, as we have said in the case of a hump, equally.
Verumtamen oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	Truly it is necessary, that the weak person should lie on his healthy side.
Et quando dislocatio est ad anteriora, tunc oportet, ut extendatur crus infirmi uelociter: et est secundum hanc eandem narrationem super podium: et ponat medicus palmam manus suae dextrae super inguen infirmum.	And when the dislocation is to the front, then it is necessary that the weak person's leg should be extended quickly: and it is according to this same narrative on the stool: and let the doctor place the palm of his right hand on the groin of the weak person.
Deinde coartet ipsum cum manu altera, et cum illa coartatione pone ipsum extensum ad inferiora ad partem genu.	Then he should grasp it with his other hand, and with that grasping place him extended to the lower part of the knee.
Et si dislocatio est ad posteriora: tunc non oportet, ut extendatur infirmus ad inferiora, et sit eleuatus super terram: imo oportet, ut sit positus super rem duram, sicut oportet, ut fit etiam si dislocatur ancha eius ad exteriora, secundum illud quod diximus de accubitu eius super duas anchas: et est super faciem eius, et ligamenta extensa: secundum quod diximus nuper.	And if the dislocation is to the back: then it is not necessary that the weak person should be extended to the lower part, and let him be raised from the ground: rather it is necessary that he should be placed on a hard thing, as it is necessary, even if his ankle is dislocated to the outside, according to what we said about his lying on two ankles: and it is on his face, and the extended bandages: according to what we said recently.
Et oportet, ut administretur compressio cum tabula etiam super locum ad quem egreditur iunctura, cum completur reductio secundum quod oportet.	And it is necessary that compression be administered with a tablet also over the place to which the joint leads, with completion of reduction according to what is necessary.
Et signum reditionis eius non occultatur tibi: et est, ut extendas duo crura infirmi: et quando uides ea aequalia, et infirmus stringit crus suum, et expandit ipsum absque excusatione: tunc scias, quia iam redit membrum, secundum quod oportet: tunc coniunge duas coxas, et pone emplastrum, et stringe cum imemati, id est, rota: ita, ut non moueatur ancha ad aliquam partium: et adhaereat infirmus quieti tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	And the sign of its reduction is not hidden from you: and it is, that you stretch out the two legs of the injured person: and when you see them equal, and the injured person draws in their leg, and expands it without excuse: then know, because now the limb has returned according to what is necessary: then join the two hips together, and apply a plaster, and bind with a strap, that is, a wheel: thus, so that it does not move to any part: and let the injured person remain quiet for three days or four.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et emplastrum, et compara crus cum altero: tunc si uides ea aequalia in statu, tunc scias, quod dislocatio iam firmata est: absolue ergo infirmum ad ambulandum.	Then loosen the bandage and plaster, and compare the leg with the other: then if you see them equal in state, then know that the dislocation is now fixed: therefore let the injured person go freely.
Et si uides aliquid mollificationis: tunc redi, et emplastra illud, et stringe illud secundum stricturam tuam primam: et dimitte illud etiam tribus diebus.	And if you see any softening: then return and apply a plaster to that, and bind it according to your first bandage: and let it be for three days as well.
Deinde solue illud et fac ipsum tardare in ambulatione super utrumque aliquot diebus, donec confortetur bene.	Then loosen it and make it slow in walking on both feet for several days, until it is comforted well.
Â¶ De dislocationis Genu.	Of Dislocations of the Knee.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter 33.
Genu dislocatur secundum tres modos.	The knee is dislocated in three ways.
Dislocatur ad exteriora, ad interiora, et ad inferiora, scilicet ad posteriora.	It is dislocated outward, inward, and downward, that is, to the back.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora.	And it is not dislocated forward.
Et signum dislocationis eius, est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut applicet crus suum ad coxam suam.	And the sign of its dislocation is that you will find the injured person applying their leg to their hip.
Si autem non adhaeret cum coxa: tunc scias, quod Genu est dislocatum.	If it does not adhere to the hip: then know that the knee is dislocated.
Et restauratio omnium modorum dislocationis eius est, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum, ita ut iam extendat crus suum si potest super illud, et adhaeret dorsum tuum ad faciem eius: et pone pedem eius inter pedes tuos.	And the restoration of all modes of its dislocation is to make the injured person sit upright, so that they may stretch out their leg if they can over it, and adhere your back to their face: and place their foot between your feet.
Deinde adhaerere fac Genu eius cum palmis tuis, et recta eas inter digitos tuos super Genu eius.	Then adhere to his knee with your palms and hold them straight between your fingers over his knee.
Deinde applica cum palma tua duo latera Genu eius cum fortitudine.	Then apply both of your palms to the sides of his knee with strength.
Et minister alius extendat pedem eius, donec redeat Genu ad locum suum.	And another person should stretch out his foot until his knee returns to its place.
Et signum reditionis est, ut adhaereat crus cum coxa in lenitate, non laboriose.	And the sign of reduction is that the leg adheres to the hip with gentleness, not painfully.
Deinde emplastra ipsum, et adhaerere fac crus cum coxa.	Then apply a plaster to it, and make the leg adhere to the hip.
Deinde liga ea simul cum uitta tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then bind them together with a bandage for three days or four.
Deinde solue ea.	Then loosen it.
Et non utatur infirmus ambulatione aliquot diebus, donec sanetur.	And the patient should not use his limb for walking for several days, until he is healed.
Si autem recusatur tibi reductio eius, tunc administra extensionem fortem cum ligamentis, quorum praecessit narratio in curatione anchae, donec redeat.	But if the reduction does not succeed for you, then administer a strong extension with bandages, whose description has preceded in the treatment of dislocations, until it returns to its place.
Â¶ De curatione dislocationis Calcanei.	Concerning the treatment of dislocation of the ankle bone.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter 34.
Calcaneus quandoque remouetur remotione parua, et quandoque dislocatur secundum complementum.	The ankle bone is sometimes removed with a small removal, and sometimes it is dislocated according to its natural alignment.
Et dislocatio eius fit, aut ad interiora, aut ad exteriora.	And the dislocation of it occurs either inward or outward.
Et signum dislocationis eius est, quod uides Calcaneum inflatum, procedentem ad partem ad quam dislocatur.	And the sign of its dislocation is that you see the ankle bone swollen, proceeding to the part towards which it is dislocated.
Curatio autem remotionis eius, est facilis reditionis: et est, ut extendatur cum facilitate cum manibus, et aequetur, donec redeat.	The treatment of its removal, however, is an easy reduction: and it is, that it should be extended with ease by hand, and adjusted until it returns to its place.
In curatione autem eius quando dislocatur secundum complementum, oportet, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum: et teneat ipsum minister fortis ualde a posteriori parte dorsi eius, in medio ipsius.	In the treatment of it when it is dislocated according to its natural alignment, it is necessary that you make the patient sit upright: and another strong person should hold him firmly from behind, at the middle of his back.
Deinde tene tu cum manu tua dextra pedem eius a superiori parte eius, et cum manu tua sinistra ab inferiori parte pedis eius loco cauillae.	Then you should hold with your right hand his foot at the upper part of it, and with your left hand from the lower part of his foot at the ankle.
Deinde trahe pedem ad tecum manu tua dextra.	Then pull the foot towards you with your right hand.
Deinde cum sinistra duabus uicibus.	Then with the left two fingers.
Deinde extende cum sinistra, et impelle pectus pedis cum dextra uersus crus absque labore.	Then stretch out with the left, and strike the sole of the foot with the right, turning the leg without effort.
Fac illud bis, sicut narrauimus.	Do that twice, as we have narrated.
Deinde impelle pectus pedis ad crus in uice tertia, et tu trahis cauillam.	Then strike the sole of the foot towards the leg with a third thrust, and you will draw out the vein.
Si ergo redit in uice una, aut in duabus secundum hunc modum, et uides pedem aequatum, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera operationem super ipsum: quoniam ipse redit.	If then it returns to its place, either in one vein or in two according to this method, and you see the foot is equalized, it is good: and if not, then repeat the operation upon it, for it itself will return.
Si autem prohibetur tibi reductio eius cum eo quod narrauimus: tunc fac iacere infirmum super dorsum suum super terram, et fige paxillum in terra firmatum ualde, ut cadat inter coxas eius: et tu iam inuoluisti super ipsum pannum, ut non laedat infirmum.	If however the reduction of it is prohibited to you with what we have narrated: then make the weak part rest on its back on the ground, and fix a small peg firmly in the earth, so that it falls between its hips: and you have now enveloped it with a cloth, so that it does not hurt the weak part.
Deinde accipiat minister coxam eius: postea extendat minister alter pedem, aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento quod liget super collum pedis.	Then let the assistant take its hip: afterwards the assistant stretches out the other foot, either with his hands or with a bandage that binds above the ankle.
Deinde extendat omnis minister contra extensionem comparis sui: et paxillus sit stans inter duas coxas infirmi retinens eum, ut non attrahatur corpus eius ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then let the assistant stretch out against the stretching of his equal: and let the peg stand between the two hips of the weak part, holding it, so that its body is not drawn downward towards the lower parts during the stretching.
Deinde aequet medicus dislocationem manibus suis, et minister alter teneat crus sanum ad inferiora.	Then let the doctor adjust the dislocation with his hands, and the assistant hold the healthy leg downwards.
Nam dislocatio redit cum uelocitate.	For the dislocation returns with swiftness.
Quando ergo redit dislocatio, et declaratur tibi sanitas reditionis eius: tunc pone emplastrum et stuppam, et stringe ipsam cum ligamentis firmiter, et liga pedem cum ligamento ad crus.	When then the dislocation returns, and the health of its reduction is declared to you: then put on an plaster and a bandage, and bind it firmly with ligaments, and tie the foot with a bandage to the leg.
Et oportet, ut caueas uel timeas de neruis, qui sunt supra calcaneum posterius, ut non sit ligamentum super eos uehemens, et laedat eos.	And it is necessary to beware lest you tighten the nerves that are above the posterior heel, so that the bandage does not press upon them violently and hurts them.
Deinde dimitte ipsum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then leave it for two days, or three.
Quod si mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum: deinde solue ipsum in die tertio, aut quarto: et prohibe infirmum ab ambulatione quadraginta diebus.	If the bandage is softened, tighten it; then loosen it on the third or fourth day; and forbid the patient from walking for forty days.
Si uero conatur ambulare ante illud spacium, non fit securitas quin dissoluatur super ipsum dislocatio, et corrumpatur, et non recipiat post illud curationem.	If indeed the patient walks too soon before that time, there is no safety lest the displacement be dissolved upon it, and it becomes corrupted, and does not receive a cure afterwards.
Quod si accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc oportet, ut administres in sedatione eius illud, in quo praecessit narratio nostra in alio loco ex curatione, et embrocationem, donec remoueatur.	If a hot abscess happens to him: then it is necessary to administer to him the treatment mentioned earlier in our discussion elsewhere on cures and embrocations, until it is removed.

Caput XXXV.	Chapter 35.
Oportet, ut aequetur quod dislocatur ex eis cum extensione pauca absque labore: et illud quidem non est difficile, imo est facile.	It is necessary to adjust what is dislocated with a few extensions without effort, and indeed it is not difficult, but rather easy.
Si autem dislocatio est in quibusdam nodis dorsi pedis: tunc oportet, ut faciat sedere infirmus pedem suum super locum aequalem terrae, aut super tabulam: et est stans sicut ambulans.	If the dislocation is in certain nodes of the back of the foot, then it is necessary that the patient sits with his foot on an equal level with the ground, or on a stool, and stands as if walking.
Deinde tu sta, et pone pedem tuum super illud quod eminet ex illis iuncturis.	Then you stand, and place your foot on what emerges from those joints.
Deinde calca illud cum pede tuo cum uirtute, donec redeat, et uideas ipsum iam aequatum, et non appareat in loco eminentia.	Then press it with your foot with force, until it returns, and you will see that it is already adjusted, and does not appear prominent in its place.
Deinde pone sub uentre pedis eius tabulam quae capiat pedem totum, cui sint duo capita.	Then put under the sole of his foot a board that takes the whole foot, which has two ends.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti tribus diebus.	Then bind it with a suitable bandage for three days.
Deinde solue ipsum, et fac quiescere eum ab ambulatione diebus multis, donec stringatur et securetur a reductione.	Then loosen it, and make him rest from walking for many days, until it is strengthened and secured from the reduction.

Caput XXXVI.	Chapter 36.
Quando accidit aliquid ex illo, et conaris curationem eius, et ipsius restaurationem, multotiens succedit mors: et propter illud non oportet, ut praesumat super curationem eius, quod est huiusmodi, nisi qui est prudens in arte longi usus, misericors, pius, tardus, non audax, neque praesumptuosus: et ut utatur in incaeptionce medicinis quae sedant apostemata calida tantum: et dimittat infirmum diuino iudicio.	When something happens from that, and you strive for its cure, and its restoration, death often succeeds; and because of this, it is not fitting to presume over its cure, which is of this kind, unless one is prudent in the art of long practice, merciful, pious, slow, not rash, nor presumptuous: and so that he may use medicines that soothe hot abscesses only: and let him leave the patient to divine judgment.
Nisi uideas, aut speras salutem a perditione cum lenitate aegritudinis, et in quo apparet quiddam spei.	Unless you despair, or hope for health with gentle treatment of the disease, and in which something of hope appears.
Conare ergo reductionem eius statim in principio rei, antequam accidat apostema calidum.	Take care therefore to reduce it immediately at the beginning of the disease, before a hot abscess forms.
Si ergo redit membrum, secundum quod uolumus, tunc administra regimen quod sedat apostema: et cura uulnus cum eo quod conuenit ei ex unguentis desiccatiuis.	If therefore the limb returns to a condition according to what you wanted, then administer a regime that soothes the abscess; and take care of the wound with what is suitable for it from drying ointments.
Quod si dislocatio est cum fractura, et accidunt in osse satagiae separatae, tunc conare ablationem earum, et fac in illo quod diximus in aegritudinibus simplicibus ex eo quod praecessit in locis earum.	What if the dislocation is with a fracture, and it occurs in separated bones of the joint, then take care to ablate them, and do in that what we have said in simple diseases from what has preceded in their places.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, et custodi teipsum ab introitu in uiam timoris: secundum quod praecessit praedicatio mea tibi.	And beware according to your ability, and guard yourself from the entrance into the way of fear: according to what has preceded my warning to you.
Nam illud est melius tibi apud Creatorem tuum, et magis permanens ad gloriam tuam, et magis saluum tuo corpori apud illos in tuo tempore.	For that is better for you with your Creator, and more permanent for your glory, and more healthy for your body among those in your time.
