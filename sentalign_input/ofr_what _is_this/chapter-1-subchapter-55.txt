Of/about stinking pustules/boils/sores
Sometimes swellings or stinking pustules appear outside the body, which come from large corrupted matters.
So it is necessary, at first when they appear, to make a cautery on each head of the pustule: a subtle cautery of myrtle wood, the tip of which is set on fire, or of long birthwort root, or with a lenticular cautery.
And sometimes they are cauterized at the beginning when they appear, in this manner, and they cannot grow from then on, but the superfluity from which they come is broken, and they are healed; but this must be done after bloodletting.
