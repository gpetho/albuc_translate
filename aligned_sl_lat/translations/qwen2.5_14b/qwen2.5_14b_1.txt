After I have completed this book for you, my Sons, which is the last part of medical science with its supplement, and after I have reached the end in it through its explanations and declarations, it seemed to me that I should complete it for you with this Treatise, which is the practical part, that is, surgery, including manual techniques.
Since the practical aspect of surgery has been neglected in our region and time, to the point that perhaps its knowledge was lost and its traces erased: and there remain from it only brief descriptions in the books of the ancients, which have been altered by hands: errors and hesitations occurred until intentions were closed off and understanding diminished. It seemed to me that I should revive it with the organization of this Treatise according to the way of positions, explanations, and abbreviations: and to bring forth forms of cautery instruments and other tools of the trade, which come about through additions in explanation and the necessity for proper operation.
The reason why a good practitioner skilled in manual surgery is not found in this time of ours is that the art of medicine is long and its author must be trained in anatomy as Galenus described it before engaging in it, until he knows the aids for members, their forms, and their connection and separation. He must also have knowledge of bones, nerves, muscles, their number, and where they originate, as well as arteries and veins, their pulsating ones and stationary ones, and the places from which they exit.
And for this reason, Hippocrates said that knowledge by name alone is much, but with practice it is little, especially in the art of manual surgery.
We have already said this at the beginning of this book.
Since those who are not knowledgeable about what we have said regarding anatomy do not avoid falling into error through which people are killed: just as I saw many of those who claim to be formed by this science and boast about it without knowledge and without experience.
That is, I saw a foolish doctor cut into a scrofulous abscess on the neck of a woman, and he cut some arteries in her neck: wherefore the woman bled until she died in his hands.
And I saw another doctor who presumed to remove a stone from a man who had advanced in age, and the stone was large.
He therefore proceeded to do so and extracted it along with part of the bladder.
Thus the man died on the third day.
And indeed I had been called to remove the stone: and I saw, from the size of the stone and the condition of the patient, that he would die.
And I saw another doctor who was receiving payment from one of the Dukes of our land for his medical services: and it happened that a black eunuch in his service broke his leg near the heel: and the doctor, with his ignorance, hurried to bandage the fracture on top of the wound with bandages and tight bindings, and did not allow any release for the injury.
Then he discharged him according to his own wishes.
After a few days, he told him not to loosen the bandage: and he stood like that until his leg abscessed, and his foot became infected, and it led to his ruin.
I was therefore called to him: and I hurried to loosen the ligature: and peace followed, and he was freed from his pains.
However, the corruption was already established in the member: and I could not restrain it.
Therefore, the corruption ceased to spread in the member until it was destroyed.
And I saw another doctor who pierced a cancerous abscess: and it became ulcerated over time, until the evil increased with his lord.
Which means that when the cancer is pure from a melancholic humor, then it is not necessary to approach it with iron at all, unless it is in a member that can tolerate having the entire part removed.
And for that reason, my children, it is necessary for you to know that the practice with the hand is divided into two divisions: namely, the operation associated with health; and the operation involving danger in many circumstances. And I have already indicated throughout this book, wherever the practice occurs, in which there is fear and terror.
Therefore, it is necessary for you to be cautious about that and leave it aside: so that the foolish do not find a way to speak of it and disgrace it.
Therefore, take the measure with care and protection, and treat your patients with ease and firmness, and use a better way leading by God's grace to salvation and commendable succession: and leave behind terrible illnesses difficult to heal: and remove from yourselves that which causes fear, so that hesitation does not enter into your faith and benefit. For it remains more for your glory, and is higher in this world, and finally for your quantities.
For Galen has already said in some of his admonitions. Do not treat illness badly; do not be called bad doctors.

Part One.
Concerning the Benefit and Harm of Cauterization: and with which temperaments it is suitable, and at what time: and whether with iron or gold.
Chapter I.
But before I recall the procedure with him, it is necessary for me to say what are his instruments and their defects: and in which constitution they appear.
I say then, that the discourse on the quality of the cautery and its harm is a lengthy and subtle discourse, a science and a hidden secret.
Moreover, many wise people have spoken about it, and they have disagreed on the matter: and for me, a few of their discourses are enough, fearing to be too lengthy.
I say then, that the cautery is generally applicable to all constitutions, whether they are material or not: except for two constitutions, which are the hot and dry constitution without material.
However, in the hot and dry constitution with material, they disagreed.
Some have said that the cautery is beneficial in it.
And others have said the opposite, namely that the cautery is not appropriate for a disease arising from heat and dryness: for the nature of fire is heat; it is inappropriate to treat with heat and dryness a condition that arises from heat and dryness.
And he who says the opposite has stated that through the cautery there is benefit in every disease characterized by heat and dryness that occurs in human bodies: for when you compare the body of a person and its moistures to the nature of fire, you find the human body to be cold.
And I indeed say from his discourse: because through experience it has revealed this to me on several occasions.
However, it should not come to that except for one who has already been tested and trained in the last chapter of cautery exercises, and who knows the diversity of human complexions, and the disposition of diseases within themselves, and their causes, and their accidents, and the duration of time for them.
However, there is no need for fear from the other complexions; especially in cold and moist diseases. Now all the doctors have agreed on them: and they do not disagree about their improvement with Caustics in these cases.
And know, my children, that from the secret of healing through Cautery with fire, and its goodness compared to Cautery with burning medicine is clear: for fire is simple, whose action does not reach beyond the member being cauterized: and it does no harm to a connected adjacent member, except for minor injury.
The action of burning medicine, however, reaches what is distant from the members: and it may cause a difficult-to-treat illness to occur in the member, and perhaps even cause death.
Fire, however, because of its subtlety and the goodness of its substance, does not do that unless it is excessive.
Now it has become clear to us through experience, due to the length of service and study with the art, and standing upon the truth of things: and for that reason I excuse myself from the length of speech.
And know, my children, that they disagree about the time when it is appropriate to perform cautery, and they place a better time for the true one.
And I say that cautery is appropriate at all times: therefore, because the harm caused by the time is outweighed by the healing drawn with the cautery.
And especially if the cautery is for pains caused by necessary, severe, and urgent conditions that do not tolerate delay: therefore, because it is feared that from them a greater evil may occur than the slight harm incurred due to waiting for the proper time.
And do not let it enter your minds, my children, what is not considered except by the common people and foolish doctors, namely that to the illness which is cured by cautery there is never a relapse: and they place this as a consequence, but the matter is not as they think: because cautery is nothing other than in the place of medicine that alters the complexion and dries up the humidities which are the cause of why pains occur.
However, cautery is unnecessary above medicine due to the speed of recovery and the power of its operation and the strength of its control: and it is possible for illness to return at some time according to the condition of the sick person, and the location and nature of their illness: and what is prepared in their body through the accumulation of excesses within them: and what reaches them through their diet and similar causes, unless an illness occurs in which cautery is administered. A subtle illness in a member due to a few excesses and humidities, such as the cautery of a tooth for pain, and similar cases, it is possible that the pain may not return.
But that is done in a few [steps].
However, the common talk about cautery being the last resort in medicine is correct: not in what they intend by it; for they believe that there is no cure that competes with medicine, nor with anything else after the use of cautery.
The matter is contrary to that belief, and the intent that cautery is the last resort in medicine is only this: when we administer methods of treatment for certain illnesses, and those treatments do not provide relief; then at the end we administer cautery, which does provide relief. From this it follows that cautery is considered the last resort of medicine, not according to the understanding intended by common people and many foolish physicians.
The ancients said that cautery with gold is better than cautery with iron: and they did not say this except because of the equality and superior quality of gold: and they stated that the place where cautery is applied does not produce pus. However, this is not true absolutely: for I have now tested it and found that it does not hold true in certain bodies without the influence of other factors.
And cautery with gold is good, and better than with iron, as they said.
However, when you heat gold for cautery in fire, it does not become clear to you how much to heat it according to your desire, due to the redness of the gold: and when it quickly reaches a cool state, if you add more heat to it, it melts in the fire and turns into sheets.
Therefore, the craftsman falls into difficulty with it: and because of this, cautery with iron is quicker and more convenient for us, being straightforward in its application.
And I have now arranged this chapter on cauterization according to the chapters, and I have arranged them from head to foot, so that he who seeks may find what he wants from it. Chapter on the method of cauterizing: The head at the coronal suture.
Chapter II.
Here cauterization is applied to the domain of humidity and coldness above the brain: there are two causes for soda, and an abundance of fluid flow from the head to the eye and ear regions, and an abundance of dreaming, and pain in the teeth and throat: and generally all illnesses that arise from coldness, such as paralysis, soda (soda probably refers to a condition), epilepsy, apoplexy, and similar illnesses.
The method of cauterization is that you instruct the patient to first evacuate with dissolving and cleansing medicine for three nights, or four, depending on the strength of the patient, their age, and their habit.
Then instruct him to shave his head with a razor.
Then have him sit between your hands in a square position, so that he places his hands on his chest.
Then place the root of your palm on the root of his nose between his eyes. Wherever your middle finger reaches, mark that place with a cautery. Then heat the olive-shaped cauterization tool; this is its form. Then place it on the marked spot with a cautery, and as your hand is gradually restrained by its weight, you will turn it.
Then quickly move your hand, and look at the place.
If you see that the quantity of alkiel or the quantity of zevherbi is now exposed from the bone, then raise your hand.
And if not, continue using your hand with the iron itself, or with another if it has cooled: until the bones appear, which I told you about.
Then take some salt and dissolve it in water, and apply it to the wound, and place it on the affected area: and leave it for three days.
Then place on the wound a dressing soaked in butter, and leave it on the affected area until the burnt tissue falls off. Then treat it with the tetrapharmakon ointment until it is healed.
They have said that the more a wound remains open, the more it discharges pus: therefore, it is better and more beneficial.
And some of them said that the skin should be cauterized down to the bone: and the cautery should be held until a portion of the bony tissue is burned.
Then scrape away what is burnt from the bone, and then treat it.
And others say that with the cautery one must proceed to the very end until it leaves an impression on the bone, so that the bone falls out, which happens as if in the shape of kirate: or a tool that women use for small engravings. They believe that vapors from the head are expelled by this, and the wound should be left open for a long time.
Then it should be treated until it is healed and firm.
But to me these two types of cauterization do not seem appropriate except for certain individuals due to fear.
And to let him go is better with him in good health.
For the head weakens from the dissolution of its natural continuity, as we have testified with other limbs; and especially when the sick person's head is naturally weak. The first type of cauterization appears to be safer and better to me, and I use it: therefore, work with it for the benefit of health.
Regarding the method of cauterizing the head when there is pain throughout the entire head.
Chapter III.
When a chronic pain occurs throughout the entire head and it persists in the sick person, they use hot irons, decoctions, purgatives for the head, oils, and emplastries.
And especially if it has already been treated with one type of cauterization that we have mentioned and none of those methods help: then consider the situation.
For if the sick person's head is of strong natural constitution and is not weak, and if it feels intense cold: then cauterize with another type of cautery under that one slightly.
Then cauterize it over the entire circumference of the head with the cautery, but do not penetrate the skin, and expose a quantity of bone as we have described.
And cauterize it with one cautery on the back of the head at a place called vas, which is where cups are placed: and raise your hand in this area, but do not expose the bone.
For this causes him great pain, and a pain different from that of the other anterior nerves of the head.
And I will call this Caustic in its place: and it is necessary that there be a caustic with which the horns of the head are cauterized, and its back part more subtly with a caustic with which the middle of the head is cauterized.
And this is its form.
Regarding the method of cauterizing for hemicrania, both with burning medicine as well as with iron.
Chapter IV.
When pain and swelling occur in a part of the head, or the pain extends to the eye, and is evacuated with purifying medicines for the head, and the remaining treatment that I mentioned in the divisions of diseases is not sufficient: then cauterization is applied in two ways: either with sharp burning medicine, or with iron. Cauterization with sharp burning medicine is done by taking one tooth of bulrush, stripping it, and cutting off its extremities from both sides.
Then cut the place of the pain with a broad lancet until you create an opening under the skin where the tooth can be placed.
Insert it under the skin until it is concealed, then bind it with a bandage of appropriate constriction. Leave it in place for fifteen hours, then remove it and extract the bulrush. Allow two or three days, then apply a poultice soaked in butter until pus forms in the area. Afterward, treat it with ointment until it heals.
And if you wish to do this with certain burning medicines, which I wrote about in the twelfth chapter, on Burning Medicines.
But cauterization of it with iron is done in this manner.
A cautery tool shaped like this.
And it is called a Clavus because the shape of its head resembles that of a key, which has some curvature, and in the middle of it there is a small protrusion.
Then place it on the location and hold your hand steady: turn the iron gradually with speed: and let the amount that is burned be according to the thickness of the skin, as its middle part.
And raise your hand so that the artery below is not burned, and thus avoid excessive bleeding.
Then soak a cloth in salt water and apply it to the location, and leave it for three days: then apply a cloth with butter: afterward treat it with ointment until it heals. And if you wish, cauterize this headache using the second cutting edge of the cautery tool.
And be careful not to cut the artery in this headache, especially if it is not an old one.
Regarding the method of cauterizing in an old headache.
Chapter V.
When treating a headache, follow what we have said about previous treatments and the divisions of diseases, and if treatment is not effective: and you see from the condition that what we said about the first cauterization with medicine or with fire is insufficient, then it is necessary to heat the cautery tool until it whitens. After marking the location of pain with a line, which should be half the length of a finger or approximately so: place your hand once and hold it steady until you cut the artery and reach the bone. However, you must be careful not to damage the joint of the lower jaw, which moves during chewing, so that either the side or the nerve that moves it is not burned, from which spasms may result.
And be careful about the preservation and protection of the blood flow of the artery that has been cut.
For there is fear in cutting it, especially for one who does not know what they are doing, and who is neither diligent nor experienced, and leaves the procedure to others primarily because of this.
And I will provide with the recollection of the management of blood flow from an artery according to its manner and in its place in this book.
If you see from the illness that this cautery is not sufficient for the patient, and you see that the patient's body can tolerate a cautery in the middle of the head, as we have described, treat the wound until it heals.
And if you wish, administer the cautery that we mentioned in the chapter on the extraction of the artery with a cautery having two knives.
For this cautery is better and more beneficial. Concerning the method of cauterizing for pain in the Ears.
Chapter VI. When pain in the Ear occurs due to cold and is treated with solutives and other treatments as we described in the division, but the pain does not subside, then apply cautery with fire: this is called a punctum, and its form is as follows.
Then make punctures around it after its burning, circling the entire ear, as it revolves: or around each one, if pain is felt in both at the same time.
And move away from the base of the ear for a moment with the cautery after marking the places with sealing wax: and let the quantity of the cauteries be ten punctures in each entire ear, or so.
Then treat the places until they heal.
¶ On the method of cauterizing in Torture.
Chapter VII.
A torture that is treated with cauterization is not otherwise than from types that occur due to phlegm, as we said in the divisions of illnesses. And avoid cauterization for the type that occurs due to dryness and spasm of the nerve.
When you treat this type of torture with herbs, and head purgatives, and gargles, and if your treatment is not effective, then it is necessary to cauterize the patient three times: once near the base of the ear, and second slightly below its usual position, and third at the junction of the two lips.
And place your cautery on the opposite side of the affected part.
Since softening does not occur except in the part that appears healthy.
And the form of cauterization is such that you should cauterize with the cautery directly at the upper extremity of the ear near the horn of the head slightly: and another at the temporal area: its length should be according to the length of the thumb.
And place your hand with the cautery until a quantity equal to the medium thickness of the skin is burned.
And this is the shape of the Cautery, and it is a type made from a knife, whose shape has been described: however, it should not be much thinner than that, as you see: and it must be somewhat thicker than a knife. Then treat the areas with what has been described until they heal.
§ On the Method of Cauterizing in Chronic Apoplexy.
Chapter VIII.
When chronic apoplexy occurs, and your treatment with what we have mentioned does not improve the condition, and the patient does not have a fever, then cauterize him four times on each corner of his head, and once in the middle of the head, as we said, and once at the back of the head, as described before: and the method of cauterization should be as previously stated.
It is also cauterized with the Cautery over the mouth of the stomach: and this is more of a last resort.
Then treat it as described previously.
§ On the Method of Cauterizing in Case of Oblivion (Amnesia).
Chapter IX.
It is necessary to give the patient large doses of hysreae (hysroe) and pills that purify the brain.
Then shave the patient's head completely, and apply a mustard plaster to the back of his head as described in the chapter on plasters: do this several times. For this is the method of Cauterization: and perform it according to the same order which I mentioned there. If it heals through that method, it is good.
If not: then perform three cauterizations on the rear part of his head, which should run from the upper part of the head down to the lower part of the eye; and place each cauterization with the distance of a finger's width between them.
Then proceed with the Cauterization as described previously.
If you wish to add more, and the patient can tolerate it: then perform a cauterization in the middle.
If you wish to add more: then cauterize him above two points [cornua].
Then treat him until he is healed: let the cauterization be olive-shaped according to the form that was mentioned previously.
¶ On the method of cauterization for Paralysis and for Softening [mollification].
Chapter 10.
It is necessary to proceed with the cleansing of the head using hysodes and as was mentioned previously.
Then shave the head of the patient: afterwards cauterize him in the middle of the head, and on each horn [corner or point] of the head, and on the posterior part of it, and three times on the vertebrae of the neck.
If you need to soften the body in a severe illness with more treatments, and the patient can tolerate it, and the illness is strong: then cauterize him four times on the vertebrae of the back, and the last one until much of the skin burns away, and raise your hand.
Then care for it until it is healed: and thus apply the olive caustic.
Regarding the method of using cauterization for epilepsy.
Chapter XI.
An epileptic should not be cauterized except in the case where epilepsy is caused by phlegm. Therefore, you should first cleanse his brain with hyle and with the remaining care that I mentioned in the division: when the patient is severe or can tolerate medication.
If it is a boy who does not tolerate medicines, then a gargle and cleansing chewings to purify the brain are administered, before this for many days with the improvement of food.
Then shave his head, afterwards cauterize it with one cautery in the middle of the head, as previously described in the method: and with another cautery on the back of his head, and above all horns of his head with a cautery.
If the patient is strong and tolerant, then cauterize him with the cauteries I described for one suffering from paralysis, and apply relaxation to the vertebrae of the neck and the vertebrae of the back: and let the Cautery be olive-based according to the method previously described. If the patient is a boy, then apply a fine cautery according to this method.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in Melancholia.
Chapter Twelve.
When the cause of melancholy is corrupted humors and thick phlegm, then cauterize him with the cauteries we described for one suffering from paralysis.
And if the cause of melancholy is an excess leaning towards melancholia, and the patient's body is moist, then give him to drink what will purify his brain, as previously described in the division: then shave the patient’s head, and afterwards make a properly formed bandage of linen, like a circle.
Then place it in the middle of the head: and the patient, sitting squarely, should be held from all sides.
Then present the ointment. And it is more appropriate from old sheep's butter.
And warm it over a moderate fire, to a temperature that can be tolerated by the finger when inserted into it.
Then empty it in the middle of their head in a circle, and let it remain until it cools.
Do this for the patient once every week, along with the rest of their good regimen, until they are healed.
Or if you wish, cauterize it by making many small points on it, except that you should hold the cautery above it: let it be smelt.
For this type of cauterization moistens the brain with its quality.
Then place on it cloth soaked in sheep's butter, or chicken fat.
¶ On the method of cauterizing with water descending to the eye.
Chapter XIII.
When the beginning of water in the eye is revealed to you by the signs I mentioned in the division, then begin and have the patient drink, along with cleaning their head.
And keep the patient away from all humidity, and have them sit in a bath, fasting for several days.
Then instruct them to shave their head, and cauterize it in the middle of their head. Then cauterize it on both temples with two cauteries, if the beginning of water descending into the eyes is simultaneous in both eyes: or from one side, if the beginning of water is in one eye: and cut with the cautery all veins and arteries that are under the skin: and let the cauteries be long in width across the temples: and beware of blood flow.
If you see something that needs to be removed, then cut it immediately with whatever medicine is possible: and I give permission with wisdom, which is in the extraction of arteries, and cutting them, and caution against the flow of blood.
And sometimes it is cauterized on the neck, between two bones, with two cauterizations finally applied.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in ancient lacrimal conditions.
Chapter XIV.
When the lacrimal conditions of the eyes are chronic and persistent: and they are above veins and arteries that are on the external surface of the head, it is confirmed that this is due to excess cold and phlegm: then cauterize with the same cautery as I described at the beginning for descending water, a cautery in the middle of the head, and two cauteries above both temples, and two cauteries on the neck between two bones.
And if you need to add more treatment, then cauterize it on all sides of the eye carefully, above the extremity of the eyebrow with a small cautery.
Concerning the method of cauterizing for nasal odor.
Chapter XV.
When you treat it as we said in the division, and the treatment does not take effect: then hurry and give infusoria cochlias in drink for three nights: then shave his head, and cauterize it with a medium cautery, using an olive oil cautery.
Then cauterize it with a needle cautery using two cauteries above both eyebrows under the hair slightly.
And guard against the artery, lest you cut it.
And this is the form of the cautery called Clauilis.
Regarding the method of using the cautery for softening the Eyelid.
Chapter XVI.
When the eyelid is softened due to illness or moisture, then cauterize the eyelid once with this lunar cautery.
And if you wish, cauterize it above both eyebrows with two applications in every part; and extend them from both temples: and the length of each cautery should be according to the length of the eyebrow: and do not apply your hand too far with the cautery, but rather according to the extent that the third part of the eyelid is burned.
And this is the form of the cautery according to this method of the lunar cautery.
Regarding the method of cauterizing the eyelid when the hairs turn and irritate the eye. Chapter XVII.
The cautery is used in two ways: either with fire, or with a burning medicine.
In the cautery with fire, however, instruct the patient to let his hairs grow if he is one who usually trims them, until they grow out and even up. 但如果它们在他刚长出的地方刺痛他：那么用带子固定他的眼睛，使其不要移动，直到新的毛发生长出来。
When they are born and have grown, then place the patient's head in your lap; then mark above their eyelids with a cautery, marking it according to the shape of a myrtle leaf: and let the beginning of the mark be near the hair.
Then place a piece of cotton soaked in egg white: or in fenugreek mucilage over the eye.
Then apply the cautery, which has this shape.
Then cauterize gradually over the shape that you marked, in many passes, until the surface of the skin, which is like the shape of a myrtle leaf, is properly burned throughout.
And the sign of your work being successful is: when you see the eyelid already contracting, and the hair lifting up around the puncture of the eye.
Then raise your hand at that time: and leave him for three days.
Then place cotton with butter on it, until the scab falls off.
Then treat him with ointment until he is healed.
If any of the hairs return after an hour, and the eyelid becomes soft: then repeat the cautery on that place, as you did initially.
If the hairs are on the lower lid: then cauterize it until the hairs rise to their natural place: and equalize so that the hairs do not irritate the eye.
Regarding the method of cauterizing with a burning medicine in the same case.
Chapter Eighteen.
You should instruct the patient to remove the hairs, until they lengthen and become even.
Make on paper or cloth a pattern of a leaf of the myrtle tree.
Then take from known soap and from lime that has not absorbed water one ounce each or something like it; then grind them together well, and make this quickly so that it does not cool.
Then spread it out on the paper you made in the shape of a myrtle leaf, and place it over the eyelid of one or both eyes.
And place a piece of cloth soaked in egg white under the eye; and have the patient's head in your lap.
And place your index finger on the medicine, and press it gently.
And you should move it whenever the patient feels the medicine stinging, for the sensation of the sting is like fire.
While the patient continues to feel the stinging sensation, then remove the medicine and move it with your finger.
When the stinging sensation subsides, then remove the medicine and wash the eye with water.
And observe if you see the eyelid rise, as it does when contracted with heat or incision; this is good. If not, then apply the medicine to a place where it has not been previously applied and does not darken, until your treatment is even and the eye contracts.
Then place on it a poultice of cotton with butter until the burnt skin is removed.
Then treat it with an ointment of diaphinicon or another suitable ointment until it is healed.
And it is necessary for you during the procedure to be extremely careful that nothing from the medicine falls into the eye.
If the eyelid softens after several days and something from the lashes causes irritation in the eye, then apply the medicine again to that place which is softened by the eyelid, as you did initially.
Then treat it until it is healed.
And this is the form of the leaf of the myrtle.
And know that the eyes of people differ in size and smallness.
Therefore, let your consideration be according to this: the way of righteousness is not hidden from one who has a keen interest in this art.
Regarding the method of cauterizing in a lacrimal fistula.
Chapter XIX.
When you treat a fistula, even though what we have said about the classifications of diseases does not apply to your treatment: then you must cauterize it according to this method.
Instruct the patient to place his head in your lap, and have an assistant hold the patient's head between their hands in such a way that it does not move or shift with the head.
Then apply Cotton infused in egg white or in mucilage of linseed to his eye; then a cautery with fire, which has this shape.
Let it be concave, like the shape of an eagle's feather shaft from one end, with which the cautery is made: and if you wish for it to penetrate all the way to the other end, and if you want it to go up in this manner.
However, this concave shape is better for your work.
Then apply the cautery to it afterward, which is made to burn very strongly.
And hold your hand near the cautery from the eye to the side of the nose for a moment, so that your hand does not wander or disturb the patient: and place the cautery on the fatty part of the eye, and destroy it.
If you therefore reach the beginning of your cautery to the socket, it will be well.
And if not, then repeat the cautery once, or twice, if you need it: and leave it for three days.
Then apply cotton with butter, and treat it with an astringent ointment until it is healed. If forty days pass and it does not heal, then apply a sharp corrosive medicine to it until the socket is exposed: and scrape it as described in its chapter.
And there is another method of cauterizing fistulas, which some of the first [surgeons] said.
Attend to the location of the fistula and find it: then place in that cleft a fine camel hair tube, that is, a fine cannula, whose form is as follows.
And pour into it the quantity of a drachma of melted lead, and hold your hand with good retention tube, and let the patient not move at all, so that the melted lead does not run or reach his eye.
And you must place a cloth infused in egg white or in water over the patient's eye.
For the lead burns the place of the fistula and heals it with remarkable healing.
If the fistula is healed as we have said with cauterization and treatment, it is good.
And if not, then it is necessary to administer the nostril opening and redirect the fistula along the course of the nose, according to where it will come to its own proper place.
Regarding the method of cauterizing in cracks of the lips.
Chapter XX.
Fissures often occur on the lip, which are called Pili, and particularly in the lips of children.
When you treat these fissures, as we have said in the division of illnesses, and if treatment does not suffice, then prepare a small knife-shaped cautery with fire, according to this form.
And let its concavity be according to the sharpness of the knife.
Then treat it with pitch until it is healed.
¶ On the Method of Cauterizing in a Fistula of the Mouth.
Chapter XXI.
When an abscess occurs at the root of the gum, or on the palate, or at the roots of the teeth: then it becomes filled with pus and bursts; afterwards it decays, and the pus runs, forming a fistula; then you treat it, but if the treatment is not effective, you must heat the cautery according to its size so that it fits into the fistula.
Then insert the heated cautery into the opening of the fistula and hold it there until the red-hot iron reaches the bottom and end of the fistula; do this once or twice.
Then treat it after that with what we have said about treatment until it is healed.
If the pus is thus removed and heals, it will be good.
And if not, then it is necessary to expose the area and remove the decayed tooth as it comes to its root.
¶ On the Method of Cauterizing in Gums and Softened Teeth.
Chapter XXII.
When the gum softens due to moisture and the teeth become loose, and treatment with medicines is ineffective: then place the patient's head in your lap.
Then place the burning cautery, whose form will be described below, so that you put the tube over the tooth: and quickly insert the ignited cautery into it: and hold your hand for a little while, until the patient feels the heat of the fire has already reached the root of the tooth.
Then raise your hand: then insert the cautery several times as you wish.
Then let the patient fill his mouth with salt water and hold it for one hour: and then spit it out.
For the tooth is strengthened, the gums, which have been softened, are constricted, and corrupted moisture is dried up.
Chapter XXIII.
When the pain of a tooth is due to coldness, or there is coldness in it, or a worm, and treatment with medicines does not help: then the cautery should be applied in two ways: either with butter, or with fire.
The cautery with butter is as follows: take cow's butter and heat it in an iron spoon or on a metal plate.
Then take a piece of cloth and wrap it around the handle of the instrument.
Then dip it in the boiled butter: and quickly place it on the painful tooth, and hold it until it cools: then repeat this several times until the effect of the heat reaches the root of the tooth.
And if you wish, dip a piece of wool or cloth in cold butter, and place it on the painful tooth: then place an ignited iron over it until the fire reaches the deepest part of the tooth cavity.
However, cauterization of it with fire is done by directing toward a tube of air, or a tube of iron. And if there is something thick or obstructive in the body such that the sharpness of the fire cannot reach the mouth of the diseased area.
Then take the cauterizing fire, which will be in the shape of a tube, and place it on that tooth: and hold your hand until the cautery cools.
Do this several times, for the pain will be removed either on that same day or the following day.
And it is necessary when applying that cauterization that the patient fill his mouth with good butter and hold it for one hour; then he should spit it out.
And this is the form of the cautery.
Cauterize with whichever end you wish, as is possible: and this is the form of the tube.
¶ On the method of cauterizing in strophulus.
Chapter XXIIII.
When strophuli are caused by phlegm and cold humidities, and do not respond to digestion through medications, and you wish to digest them quickly: then use a concave cauterizing fire, whose form is as follows.
Having two open ends, so that smoke can exit from the cauterizing fire at one end: and place it ignited upon the abscess once, and a second time if necessary, until it reaches the depth of the abscess.
If the abscess is small, then apply cauterization according to the size of the abscess.
Then leave it for three days and apply cotton soaked in butter until what the fire burned away is removed.
Then treat it with tooth ointment until it heals to the shape of a tube.
Regarding the method of cauterizing for hoarseness of voice and constriction of breath.
Chapter XXV.
When the humidity overpowers the channel of the lungs, and especially when it is accompanied by cold temperament, then it is necessary for the patient to be evacuated first with soluble medicines.
Then cauterize it at night near the root of the throat in a depressed area: and be careful not to reach with the cautery to the throat, nor on the skin, except slightly.
Then cauterize it with another cautery near the joint of the neck at the last vertebra: and let the cautery be needle-like according to the method that has been described.
Then treat it with the method that was described until it is healed.
Regarding the method of cauterizing for ailments of the lungs and cough.
Chapter XXVI.
When cough and illness of the lungs are caused by cold humidity, and the patient does not have fever nor consumption, and there is no old illness: then cauterize it with two cauteries above the clavicle in depressed, gentle, and empty areas.
And with another cautery in the middle of the chest between the two nipples: and let the cautery be in the shape of a tube as described previously.
And if you wish for your cautery to be done by pricking with a cautery called Punctum, whose shape was described previously in the section on piercing for ear pain: and let there be points from thirty pricks up to nearly twice that number.
Then treat it with what was described previously until it is healed. And now let the cautery have three branches: in this shape.
Therefore, the cautery is lightened when you do it in one application with three cauterizations.
¶ On the method of cauterizing for Titillico, in case of shoulder dislocation.
Chapter XXVII.
When the head of the helper bone is dislocated due to moisture and does not return to its proper position at the time of its return from dislocation until it becomes accustomed to the act of returning, then it is dislocated by a slight movement as we have already testified. Then you must reduce the dislocation first.
Then the patient should be laid supine on their back, or on their healthy side.
Then raise the skin that is on the inner side of the arm near the shoulder joint with your left hand fingers: and if the joint is dislocated towards the inside.
Then take the cautery with two tongues heated by fire. Here is the translation:
Then cauterize the skin until it penetrates to the other side, and the figure of the cauterization will come with four cauterizations.
And sometimes the cauterization is done with a cauterizing tool having three points, so the figure of the cauterization then has six points: and these points are according to the fineness of the tissue.
And this is the form of the cauterizing tool having three points.
And sometimes one is added to this method, so there are eight cauterizations.
Then place crushed leeks with salt on the cauterized area.
Then ensure the patient remains calm so that the affected limb is not moved for some time until it strengthens.
And if the dislocation is upwards, and this rarely happens, then cauterize it above the shoulder with a nail cauterization or by multiple punctures with cauterizations.
For the joint is strengthened, and the moisture is removed: and the patient is healed.
¶ On the Method of Cauterizing the Stomach.
Chapter XXVIII.
When cold and excessive moisture occur in the stomach, such that they do not yield to its nature, and catarrhs increase and persistent methods of treatment are ineffective: then the patient must lie supine on their back, stretch out their legs, and extend their arms.
Then cauterize with three cauterizations: one with a cauterizing tool the size of the breadth of one digit below the chest level, and two cauterizations below on either side of the first cauterization, until the figure of the cauterizations forms a triangle.
And keep them apart so that they do not join together, when they produce pus. And let the depth of the cautery be the quantity of two-thirds the thickness of the skin.
And let the shape of the cauteries be according to this form without addition: and if you wish to cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this form: and let the cautery by which this cautery is made be one according to the shape of a circle according to this form.
And the stomach is cauterized by puncturing it for the person who is troubled by this cautery: and you should mark a point on the stomach according to the quantity you wish with pitch: then cauterize it with the puncture cautery: then care for it with the treatment that precedes until it heals.
¶ On the method of cauterizing Epar frigidum.
Chapter XXIX.
When pain occurs in the epigastrium due to cold and moisture, or from thick wind, until the excesses depart from its natural constitution by their normal evacuation and the patient is cured as we have said, but it does not improve: then the patient should lie on his back with his neck raised, and mark three cauteries with pitch according to this figure, and of the same size above the epigastrium near the hypochondria, where a man's elbow reaches: and let there be a space between each cauterium equal to the thickness of a finger: and let the cauterium extend straight along the length of the body: and do not press your hand much with the cautery.
And let the amount that is burned be of a thickness equal to half the thickness of the skin without addition: and let the patient stand on his feet.
If it is not standing, then let it be lying down, who now stretches out his legs and raises his arms. This is the form of cautery.
And it is possible for you to use these cautery instruments with a cautery knife when you have the skill and prudence in the art.
And be careful not to proceed too far with the cautery, so that the thickness of the entire skin is burned, and consequently the whole body is burned, reaching the intestines: for the skin there is thin; therefore, be aware of this.
Concerning the method of cauterizing abscesses of the liver.
Chapter XXX.
When an exit occurs and you wish to know whether the abscess is in the flesh of the liver or in its capsule: if it is in the flesh of the liver, the patient experiences a constant pain and heaviness without sharpness; and if it is in the capsule of the liver, there is intense sharpness along with the pain. You will see that its treatment has already exhausted his doctors.
Therefore, the patient should lie supine with his neck raised.
Then shape the area of the abscess with a probe; then heat the cautery, which should resemble a rod.
And this is its form.
And cauterize with it once, until the entire skin is burned and reaches the underlying tissue, until all the pus is expelled; then treat it as you would an abscess that has burst, until it heals.
And he must not use this type of cautery unless his study of the art of medicine has been prolonged, and through whose hands these illnesses have come with experience on several occasions; then indeed he may dare to perform such an operation.
However, to release it is better in my opinion.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in Pneumothorax (or Pleurisy).
Chapter XXXI.
The ancients said that a cautery with the roots of aristolochia should be applied to cold pleurisy in this manner.
And it is such that you should take one root from dried aristolochia roots, which is longer than the others and as thick as a finger.
Then immerse it in oil, and light it on fire.
Then cauterize once in the area between the junction of the collarbone and the clavicle, and with two small cauteries slightly inclined under the chin, on the part that is below the beard.
And with two cauteries inclined slightly towards the back between the fifth and sixth rib: and with another cautery in the middle of the chest, and one above the stomach.
And with three cauteries from the back: one in the area between the two scapulae: and with two cauteries on both sides of the chest, below the one between the two scapulae.
And you must not press the cautery with your hand, but it should be evident on the skin, emitting smoke. And certain ancient ones have said that there are men who use cautery with iron similar to a rod: and they ignite it, and put it inside where the ribs are, until it reaches the abscess with it, and pus comes out; as we said about the abscess of Epatus.
But in this perforation with cautery there is fear that either the sick person dies immediately, or it results in a place where a fistula occurs, which cannot be cured.
Chapter XXXII: On the Method of Cauterizing the Spleen Head.
When you treat an illness of the spleen, as we have said concerning treatment in the division of illnesses, and if your treatment does not help, then cautery is used in it according to three methods, which are all correct.
One of these methods is to make three or four cauterizations by drawing lines along the length of the spleen according to the shape of the cauteries used for the abscess of Epatus, as described in its figure.
And there should be a space between each cautery of the thickness of a finger, or slightly more.
And the method of the cautery, which we mentioned for the cautery of Epatus, should be done equally.
And do not press your hand with the cautery: and let the patient lie supine on their back.
And another method of cautery is as follows: ignite a cautery with two prongs, which we mentioned in the chapter on dislocation of the shoulder: and raise the skin that lies directly over the spleen, where the left elbow of the patient reaches: and your lifting should be such that you lift the skin according to the width of the body, so that the cauteries fall along the length of the body.
Then insert two burning threads very deeply until they penetrate the skin from the other side; then remove the cautery. Thus, four cauterizations are performed. And if you wish to cauterize with another cautery having three threads.
Then take care of the wound after allowing the cautery to discharge pus for many days, for this is more beneficial than any other methods that precede in treatment.
Regarding the method of cauterization in cases of dropsy.
Chapter XXXIII.
Cautery should not be used in cases of dropsy except in proper ascites.
When treating cases of dropsy with the methods of treatment that we have described in the division, and if the treatment is not effective, then it is necessary to cauterize the patient four times around the navel, and once above the stomach, and once above the pubis, and once above the spleen, and twice between the shoulder blades at the spine, and once directly on the chest, and once directly on the stomach: and the depth of the cautery should be close to the thickness of the skin.
Then allow the cautery to remain open so that it discharges pus over a long period of time.
And do not evacuate the patient from treatment after the cautery; it is necessary to combine two intentions for him: and with God's help, he will recover more quickly.
The shape of the cautery used to cauterize the abdomen should be nail-shaped, as previously described; and the shape of the cautery used to cauterize the back should be olive-shaped, as previously described.
On the Method of Cauterizing Feet and Legs. Chapter XXXIIII.
When abscesses form in a person with dropsy and become filled with yellowish fluid: you should cauterize above the dorsal part of the foot at night, which is between the space of the second and third toes: raise your hand with the cautery and do not twist it: then raise your hand again: and do not repeat this procedure at all.
The yellowish fluid will drain, and the cautery should be performed in this manner.
Then perform two cauteries on each leg, covering the entire leg: use the sharp end of the cautery and make the cauterizations along the length of the leg, one below the knee and the other lower down, around the middle of the leg: also perform two cauteries on each hip: leave the cautery open without treatment for a long time so that some fluid may drain from it: then treat it as we have described.
On the Method of Cauterizing for the Relief of Abdominal Distension. Chapter XXXV.
When there is abdominal distension due to cold and humidity, which weakens the retaining and digestive powers in the stomach and intestines: and it does not heal with conventional methods of treatment: and you see that the patient can tolerate a cautery of great strength, then cauterize them with a large cautery on their stomach as previously described for stomach cauterization using the circular cautery, and four fine cauteries around the navel area with a fine needle-shaped cautery: and one large cautery above the alata or two cauteries.
And if you see excessive moisture and the patient can tolerate it, then cauterize it with a cautery on the labia majora, and with a cautery on all of it: and perhaps you will add two small cauteries near the stomach above the large one.
For the treatment is successful, whose aid does not err.
¶ On the Method of Cauterizing Hemorrhoids.
Chapter XXXVI.
When there are many old hemorrhoids in the anus, or one, and they are from thick, cold, or corrupted humors, and they are treated as we have said in the division, but the treatment is not effective: then cauterize with three cauteries on the lower vertebra of the spine slightly triangularly, and with a cauterization below the navel by about two fingers.
And if you think that his stomach is chilled, and his food is not being digested, and you see his face becoming diseased, then cauterize him on the stomach with a large cautery as mentioned before: and with a cautery above his navel, and another on his spleen with a nail-shaped cautery: and leave an open cautery for some time: then treat him until he is healed.
¶ On the Method of Cauterizing After the Removal of Hemorrhoids.
Chapter XXXVII.
When you remove a hemorrhoid, then ignite a cautery that resembles a rod.
Then insert the ignited cautery into the removed hemorrhoid: and move your hand until the cautery reaches the opening of the vein from which the blood flows: do this once or twice. If therefore there are many small protrusions, then treat each with a cautery as we have described.
Then treat them with ointments that benefit them until they are healed.
And if you treat it with a large cautery over alum, it is more of a last resort in treatment.
Regarding the method of cauterizing a fistula in the anus.
Chapter XXXVIII.
When the patient does not comply with the procedure and operation that we have described in its place, and is afraid of it, perhaps he can be healed with a cautery.
When therefore a fistula occurs in someone and persists, pus runs from it, and corrupted humors accumulate.
It is therefore appropriate that you examine it with a fine probe.
Then determine the depth of the fistula with a probe.
Then heat the cautery, which is shaped like a rod.
Then insert the heated cautery into the fistula, and determine how far it goes inside. And apply the cautery to it repeatedly until all the corrupted tissues are burned away, once, twice, or three times, according to your need.
And be careful not to burn the nerve, if it is there, or large vessels: or if the fistula goes towards the bladder or the intestine, then be cautious of all these locations.
And do not do it unless the fistula is in fleshy tissue: and you consider that it does not penetrate.
Then treat the area until it is healed.
If the area is sealed and material is removed from it, and it remains this way for a long time: then you know that it is now completely healed.
And if no material is removed from it, then you know that it is penetrating, or there is a corrupted opening within it, or something like those mentioned: the memory of which will come at its place.
¶ On the Method of Cauterizing the Kidneys.
Chapter XXXIX.
When pain occurs in the kidneys due to cold or from thick wind, and it decreases because of this for the sick person, then you should cauterize above the almethen above the kidneys, using cautery over each kidney with a needle-shaped cautery, whose predecessor's method is recalled.
And perhaps we should cauterize it a second time in the same almeidatus.
Therefore, three lines will appear.
Therefore, they will be more effective for healing.
¶ On the Method of Cauterizing the Bladder.
Chapter XL. When debility and softening occur in the bladder due to cold and humidity, to the point that the sick person cannot retain urine, then cauterize it at the lower part on both sides above the bladder, where the hairs of the pubic region begin, and use one cautery from the right side and another from the left: and let the length of this cautery be as long as the width of the joint of your thumb: and cauterize it with an inferior back cautery, or with two cauteries if you need that: and let it follow the previous needle-shaped cautery.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the womb. Chapter XL I.
When cold and humidity occur in the womb, preventing impregnation, corrupting her menstrual cycle, delaying its provocation, and causing pain upon their arrival, then it is necessary to cauterize three times around the navel, as we said regarding the cauterization of the bladder, and with a cautery above the pubic region below the back, or with two cauteries: and let the cautery be clavile.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the ankle in dislocation.
Chapter XL II.
When the mucous humidities flow to the ankle region and become the cause of its displacement from its proper place; and the sign of this is that one leg is extended over the other when they are compared side by side: and the location of the dislocation is found to be empty.
Therefore, you should cauterize the affected area above the ankle region with a cautery similar to a circle: after marking it with pitch around the perimeter, as it revolves: and let the pitch fall in the center of the circle.
And let the cautery be of the form that preceded in the cauterization of the stomach.
If you do not have this cautery available to you, then cauterize it three times with a large olive-based cautery: and the depth of the cautery should be according to the thickness of the entire skin.
Then treat it until it heals.
Regarding the method of cauterization for sciatica. Chapter XLIII.
When pain occurs in the buttocks due to cold and humidity, and treatment according to what we have mentioned in the division does not help and the condition persists: then it is necessary to free the patient from thick humors using fetid pills, or with artificial pills, and similar remedies.
Then cauterize him.
And the method of cauterization is in two ways: either with cautery using burning medicines, or with fire.
Cautery with fire is in many ways.
One of which is to cauterize above the affected buttock with three triangular cauteries, in this form.
And make their depth good or bad.
And the space between each cautery should be the width of a finger. Let the cautery be olive-shaped.
Sometimes the cautery is made in the middle above the affected buttock.
Therefore, there are four cauteries.
And if you wish to cauterize with a circle, whose form has been described for the cauterization of hip dislocation: let it be a circle enclosing the entire buttock.
And burn the thickness of the entire skin.
This is the method of cauterization for sciatica when the pain adheres to the buttock itself and does not extend up to the thigh and leg.
If it extends as far as the hip and thigh, then cauterize it with two cauteries above the hip, at the place which the patient indicates where there is pain, and with your cautery on the wooden board four digits toward the wooded part slightly: and let the cautery be knife-shaped. And the depth of the cautery should be according to the thickness of the skin.
If the patient indicates that the pain extends as far as near the toes, then cauterize it there where he points with a pointed cautery, three, four, or more times if necessary.
And if he indicates that the pain is below the knee towards the thigh, then cauterize it there with one knife-shaped cautery.
And be careful in all your cauterizations that you do not use the cautery to burn a nerve or large artery, and thereby cause harm or contraction through it for the patient.
And indeed I have already seen one and another of those who cauterized on a wooden board and pushed too hard during the cauterization, causing the thigh to swell until the swelling reached the foot, which became perforated and completely corrupted: then there followed a rupture of the abdomen, and death thereafter.
If the pain is in both parts at the same time, cauterize each one according to this method.
And certain wise men have said that in the cauterization of an abscess, this is the method of the cautery.
Make a cautery like one made of iron, whose diameter is half the width of a palm: and let it be at its opening as thick as the core of a finger, or slightly less: and inside that cautery should be a third small cautery.
And let the space between each clamp be the width of one thumb joint: and let the clamps be open on both sides: and let their height be about one or two thumb joints: and make a handle for them from appropriately fitted iron on the clamps.
And this is its form.
Then heat it in the fire until it turns red and sparks: then place it on a tray while the patient lies on their healthy side.
Cauterize him with three round cauteries at once.
Then let him go for three days.
Afterwards apply plasters with butter: and let the wound remain open for many days.
Then treat him with ointment until he is healed.
Albucasis says, we have used this type of cautery only rarely because of the terrifying appearance of it: and also because few can endure it.
Nevertheless, it is one of the good cauteries for those who can endure it and find its place appropriate.
However, for the cautery with burning medicines, you should make two clamps having a perforated ring, into which descends the hinge of its door made of brass or iron, the length of the wall: their height should be two thumb joints, or about that.
And let the space between each be the width of a finger, and let them be open both below and above: and let them fit together in this manner.
Then place it on the box of pitch, with the patient lying on their healthy side.
And press your hand strongly on the box of pitch.
Then pour warm water, heated briefly with fire, between two circles, and hold it for a period of time: the patient should tolerate the burning sensation and scalding, as they will feel it like fire, until the burning subsides.
Then raise your hand with the instrument and wipe the warm water off the pitch completely using cool water. Then leave it for three days.
And place butter on it until the blackness of the scorching is removed: leave it for several days, and pus will flow from it.
For this is the final step in the treatment.
Then treat it with ointments until it heals.
If the pain extends to the hip or leg: make a poultice for it in the affected area as you did with the pitch, equally.
And this is the method for warm water: I have already written about it in the chapter on the preparation of medicines.
Take one part of alkali and one part of unslaked lime: grind both and place them in a new pot with a small hole in the bottom, sized according to how much the radius will fit through. Place another earthenware pot underneath the first pot. Pour water over the alkali and lime until they are submerged by about a finger's width. Then press them well with your hand: leave the pot until the sharp water has drained into the lower earthenware pot.
Then pour that water completely over another dressing: and strain it until it is renewed.
For it will then be very strongly sharp, which is used in many medical operations and in the cautery of other limbs.
Because it accomplishes the work of fire itself.
And among the medicines with which the thighs are cauterized are also like decoctions of tares, and mango fruit, and a dressing with soap, such that both are thoroughly mixed. �帔请注意，"mel anacardi"在原文中指的是芒果果酱或含有芒果的蜜膏，但直译为“安卡迪蜂蜜”可能不够准确。考虑到上下文，“mango fruit”可能是更贴近原意且易于理解的翻译。
And Galenus indeed reported in his writings the treatment of an ancient man for the pain of the thigh and sciatic vein: and he highly praised its effectiveness.
And he said that it did not require any other treatment, and since he was cured in one attempt, he mentioned that perhaps the patient was carried into a bath and emerged from it already healed. And it should be taken from green myrtle: and if the green one is not found, take the fresh dry one: and grind it much with some fat, and apply it to the thigh or leg or hip where there is pain: and bind it, and leave it for three hours, or until the patient feels a soothing sensation of burning.
Then introduce him into the bath.
When his body becomes moist, introduce him into the tub.
For the pain retreats, and he is healed.
And know that one must not use cauterization with these medicines unless after the evacuation of the body.
And Dioscorides said that goat dung, when used to cauterize the sciatic vein, is beneficial; and it is made into a cautery in this way.
Take wool, soak it in old oil, and place it on a deep spot located between the thumb of the foot and the webbing, closer to the webbing.
Then take dried goat dung and burn it in fire until it becomes charcoal.
Then place the charcoal on the wool and leave it until it extinguishes.
Then repeat it.
Do not stop doing this until the sensation reaches as far as the joint, and the pain subsides.
And this method of cauterization is called Vaccinum Cauterium.
¶ On the Caution of Cauterizing Back Pain.
Chapter XLIIII.
Pain in the back sometimes occurs due to many causes, such as from an accident, a blow, excessive evacuation, or similar factors, resulting from the infusion of cold and moist matter. However, cauterization is applicable only to this specific case, which results from the infusion of cold matter.
Therefore, after the patient has been evacuated with foul pills and similar medicines, three lines should be made on the back where the pain is, following the width of the area. After marking with encaustic in each line five or more points according to the strength and tolerance of the patient: cauterization should be performed using cautery needles.
And if you wish, cauterize three times or four, with a middle nail cauterization, in this form.
Concerning the method of cauterizing at the beginning of Knob Disease.
Chapter XLV.
This illness often affects very young children.
And the sign of its onset in children is that it occurs during restricted breathing at inhalation and movement: and you will find in the last vertebra of the spine and its nodes that they have already begun to protrude above the other vertebrae.
When you see this and wish to treat it, then cauterize it with a cauterization that is circular in this form.
And apply the cautery evenly over all parts of the vertebrae: and if you wish, cauterize around the vertebrae with a pointed cautery in two lines or three: and let the points be close to each other.
Then treat the area until it heals as we have said.
And be careful not to administer cauterization in a hunchback condition that is caused by nerve spasm.
Concerning the method of cauterizing for Gout and joint pains. Chapter XLVI.
When pains in the joints are caused by cold humidities that flow to any part of the body, then when pains occur in the feet, it is customary among doctors to call this condition Gout properly.
When therefore podagra caused by cold is treated according to methods of treatment, and pains are not removed, then the cautery removes them.
And it is such that you should cauterize him after evacuation around the joint of the foot with many cauteries: and let the cauterization be olive-based.
This is its form.
And if you need to puncture the surface of the foot, then do so with a pointed cautery.
If the pains ascend to the knees or other joints, and this often happens, then cauterize it above both knees with three cauteries, or four from all sides, using this same Caelius's cautery. If you need to use this cautery more than once, then cauterize it. And do not immerse your hand with the cautery, but let it be about as thick as the thickness of the skin.
If the pains ascend to the knees and back, then administer what we have said about the cautery in its appropriate section.
If the pains are in the hands only, then puncture around the joints, as two lines are revolved.
If pain remains in the fingers, then puncture them over every knot and along the palm of the hand.
If the pains ascend after days to the elbows or shoulders, then cauterize both from all sides.
And do not evacuate the patient from good regimen, from receiving medicine.
For if good treatment is given and the phlegm is evacuated, with this cautery God's help will heal it.
Regarding the method of cauterizing in ruptures.
Chapter XLVII.
When a rupture occurs in the inguinal region and the intestine or gut descends to the testicle, and it is close to the beginning: then you must instruct the patient to abstain from eating on that day.
And let him use laxatives so that the feces may descend from his stomach.
Then let him sit between your hands on his back: and instruct him to hold his breath until it comes out, or the gut or intestine becomes visible.
Then push it back with your fingers, and mark it with a cautery below the rupture above the pubic bone, with a mark whose end is similar to half of a circle towards the upper part of the body.
Then heat the cautery, which has this shape, until it turns white and sparks.
Then return the intestine or gut to its concavity.
Then let the assistant place his hand on the location to prevent the intestine from coming out: and you now open between the patient's legs, and place a cloth under him, and another servant on his legs, and another on his chest holding his hands.
Then place the cautery on that mark, holding it straight with your hand.
And hold it until you reach the mouth with it; or try again in another way if you did not succeed in reaching the mouth with it at first.
And carefully observe from the exit of the intestine during your cautery time, so that you do not burn it, and thus cause either death or great harm to the patient.
And know that when you do not reach the mouth with the cautery, your procedure is ineffective.
And it is necessary for the cautery instrument of children to be fine, according to their measure.
Then treat with the remaining ointments until it is healed.
And let the patient lie on his back for forty days until the wound is sealed.
And it is necessary to provide nourishment for the duration of his treatment, which will soothe his stomach: so that nothing exits through the intestines during efforts and bowel movements.
Then when he wishes to rise after forty days, administer a properly made bandage and let him wear it for another forty days.
For when he follows this regimen, he is healed completely.
When ruptures occur in other parts of the abdomen and are just beginning, and you wish to prevent them from worsening, then cauterize the rupture with a round cautery according to its size: and what is burned should be as thick as a third of it.
Then treat it as we have said: and nothing shall be added.
And some of the earliest ones have said: to cauterize the Rupture with a triangular cautery, in this form.
After marking it with encaustic, and placing a line which is across the width on the upper side of the Rupture, and another line to the lower side. And place your hand in the middle with the cautery nail.
But the first cautery is easier and better. ¶ On the method of cauterizing for pains caused by an accident or impact.
Chapter XLVIII.
When pain occurs in certain members due to an accident or impact, and that pain persists for a long time without being alleviated by medication: then it is necessary to cauterize with the puncture cautery.
And the cautery should be of the same size as the member to be cauterized, according to its magnitude, and its condition, and its weakness, and its strength, and the location of the twist, and the pain from it.
If therefore it is healed by the first cautery, it is well.
If not: then repeat the cautery on it.
For it is common with these pains to shift from one member to the adjacent one.
Therefore, it is necessary to follow them with the cautery until the patient is healed.
Of the method of cauterizing in Leprosy.
Chapter XLIX.
Lepers are sometimes benefited greatly by cautery.
And especially the type of leprosy that occurs due to the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy: when you wish to cauterize it, take care to consider it carefully.
If the leprosy is beginning and you have treated it as we described in the division, and it neither descends nor remains stable: and you fear that corruption will spread over the entire complexion of the patient: then cauterize him on top of his head with five cauteries: one in the middle of the head, a second below it towards the forehead at the end of the hairline, and two on each of the two temples, and one posteriorly above the nape of the neck.
And hold your hand with the cautery for a short time until it leaves a small impression and the tissues are slightly displaced: so that the expulsion of thick vapors may be alleviated, and cauterize the spleen as well, according to what has been mentioned previously.
If, however, the leprosy has already spread over the patient and is clearly apparent: then you must cauterize with these cauteries that we mentioned for the head, and one cautery on the tip of the nose, and two cauteries on each jaw, and two cauteries on the vertebrae of the neck, and six on the vertebrae of the back, and one large cautery near the coccyx, and another above it at the midpoint: and two on each hip bone, that is, one on each side of every hip bone, and two on each knee: one on each knee, and two on each shoulder, and two on each elbow, and two on each armpit: and cauterize him over every joint, from the joints of his fingers and toes: and cauterize over every heel of his feet, and the palms of his hands.
And be careful not to burn the nerves that are above the heel. And sometimes it is cauterized with one cautery over the pubic bone, and another over the navel, and another over the epigastrium.
And know that the more you add cautery, it is more beneficial and more effective.
And know that the sick person does not feel pain from the cautery as healthy people do: because his body is already numb.
And it is necessary for the cauteries to be sized and shaped according to the limbs and joints: as determined by the types of tools.
Chapter 50.
When a limb is numb and is treated with medicines, oils, and plasters but does not heal, then cauterize the numb limb with cauteries according to the size of the member or its shape.
And let your cautery penetrate the thickness of the skin for a short while.
Then treat it with ointment until it heals.
And sometimes cautery is applied to relieve numbness that occurs in the hand or foot at the vertebrae of the back near the exit of the nerves that move that limb: and the numbness is removed.
But let no one undertake that who is not wise in the anatomy of the limbs and the emergence of the nerves moving the body.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in Albaras.
Chapter LI.
When Albaras is old and does not benefit from any medical ingenuity: then cauterize on it deeply for a little while, according to the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness is removed and its color changes.
Then treat it with flour of the herb, lentils with rose oil, and leaves of arnoglossa, and dove's blood, and swallow's blood: let there be an equal part of each. Mix all these together and apply to a cloth, which should adhere to the area until it is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in cases of cancer.
Chapter LII.
When cancer is beginning, and you wish to stop its progress: then cauterize it with a circular cautery around it, as it spreads.
The wise have said that it should be cauterized with the ultimate cautery in the middle.
I do not think that is advisable: because I fear it will ulcerate: and I have already seen this happen several times. It is better to cauterize around it with a circle, as we said: or with multiple cauteries. Concerning the method of cauterizing in cases of Adubelati.
Chapter LIII.
When someone has an abscess that is slow to mature, either due to excess moisture causing it, or due to the patient's old age with little blood, or because of the time and you wish to hasten its maturation, then cauterize around it with many small cauterizations by puncturing.
Then leave it.
For it will hasten in its maturation.
But if you wish to pierce it with a cautery, then heat the cautery, which has this form.
And place it in the center of the abscess until it penetrates the skin: and let the cautery be from that which follows, so that the flow of pus may be relieved.
Then care for it until it heals.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in a corrosive wound. Chapter LIV.
A corrosive is nothing but corruption moving within a member and it consumes it, just as fire eats dry wood.
If you see a corrosive in a place that can tolerate cautery with fire, then heat many cauteries, small and large tweezers, as is appropriate for the place where the corrosive is.
Then cauterize it from all sides until the entire root of the corruption is eradicated, and nothing remains of it internally. Then leave it for three days, and apply ground sulfur with oil to the cauterized areas, until all the scabs are removed and all corruption is eradicated.
Then treat it with ointments that generate flesh.
If therefore you see that after three days healthy flesh begins to grow, in which there is no corruption, it is good.
And if not: then apply cautery to what remains of the corrupted areas.
And a corrosive is sometimes treated with sharp medicines.
For it rises in the place of the cauterization.
Indeed, cautery with fire is quicker for healing: and I have already mentioned the cautery with sharp medicine in the division; therefore, take it when you need it.
¶ On the method of applying cautery to Warts and Corns. Chapter 55.
This illness often occurs in the lower parts of the feet: it is a thick, hard substance that injures the foot. And cautery for these conditions is performed in two ways: with fire and with hot water.
When it comes to cautery with fire, make the cautery hollow, resembling the tip of a vulture's feather: this should be made of iron according to the size that will contain the wart from all sides: and have thin edges.
Then place the heated cautery on the wart. Then rotate the hand with the cautery around the circumference of the wart until the cautery reaches the depth of the wart: and leave it for three days until it begins to discharge pus. Then apply plasters made with harmful forest herbs, crushed with salt: and leave the plaster on it overnight. For he will be uprooted from his roots.
Then treat the area with a flesh-generating ointment until it is healed.
If they do not turn and often occur on the surface of the body, especially on the hands and feet: then apply cauterization with hot water: and it is as if you take a tube made of metal, or iron, or from a vulture's feather: and place it over the nail, or thorn.
Then pour a small amount of hot water into the tube: hold your hand and rotate it with pressure from your hand for a short while, so that the edge of the tube imprints on the root of the nail, and the hot water finds its way to the depth, to the root of the nail: and the patient should wait for about one hour over the scalding of the hot water.
Then leave it alone, for the nail is uprooted with its roots.
Do this one after another until you have treated all of them on the body.
Then treat them after they are removed, with flesh-generating ointments.
¶ On the Method of Cauterizing in Tremor.
Chapter LVI.
When tremor occurs in someone due to cold in the nerve, or from quartan fever, or other causes: then it is necessary to cauterize it four or five times over the vertebrae of the back, and between each vertebra with a cautery, and on the chest with a cautery, and above the stomach with a cautery.
For trembling is alleviated by olive oil cautery, and health hastens from cold illness. On the method of cauterizing by Albucasis.
Chapter LVII.
Sometimes ugly blemishes are expelled from the body by Albucasis, that is, pimples, which are caused by corrupted thick substances.
Therefore, when they first appear, they must be cauterized over the entire head of pimples with a fine cautery using a branch of myrtle, whose end is ignited with fire.
Or with the root of long aristolochia.
Or with a lentil-shaped cautery. And sometimes they are cauterized at the beginning of their expulsion according to this method: and they do not increase; and the excess that causes them is disrupted, and they heal from them.
However, it must be done after evacuation with phlebotomy.
On the method of cauterizing when blood flows from an artery in a wound.
Chapter LVIII. Often it happens that blood flows from an artery that is cut near a wound, which occurs externally, or near the incision of an abscess, or a cautery of a limb, and similar cases: and it becomes difficult to stop it.
When this happens to someone, then quickly go with your hand to the opening of the artery, and place your index finger upon it: and press it tightly until the blood is trapped under your finger and nothing comes out from it. Then put small olive wood cauteries and a larger number of large ones into the fire, and blow on them until they burn very strongly.
Then take one of them, either a small or large one, according to the wound and the place where the artery is ruptured, and place the cautery on top of it; then quickly remove your finger: hold the cautery until the blood is severed.
If it is expelled when you raise your finger from the opening of the artery and extinguish the cautery, then quickly take another cautery from those which are prepared in the fire. Do not then stop doing it with one after another until the blood is severed.
And be careful not to burn the nerve that is there, so that another evil does not happen to the patient. And know that when blood flows from an artery, then it is not possible to sever it, especially when the artery is large, unless with one of four methods.
Or with a cautery, as we have said.
Or with extraction, when it has not been extracted. For when it is extracted, its extremities contract, and the blood is severed.
For when it is extracted, its extremities contract, and the blood is severed. Or it may be tied with a strong thread.
Or medicines with the property of severing blood may be applied to it, and it should be compressed with a suitable bandage.
He who performs the cutting of it with a ligature, and constriction with cloth, or placement of burning substances, and similar treatments, does not fully benefit him, except rarely.
If it should happen to someone and there is no doctor present nor any medicine: then he should begin by placing the index finger upon the opening of the vein itself, as we have described, and constricting it very tightly until blood is obstructed above the wound, and over the artery.
And the finger should not be removed, but kept above it with very cold water continually, until the blood freezes, thickens, and is severed. And meanwhile he should consider what it needs from cautery or medicine.
End of the First Part.
Book of Surgery by Albucasis, Part II. On Incision, Piercing, and Phlebotomy in Wounds and Similar Cases.
In the First Chapter, we have already discussed any ailment in which it is appropriate to use fire with cautery and burning medicine, along with its occasions, causes, instruments, and forms of cauterization. And there I placed chapters from the head down to the foot.
And I will proceed in this chapter along the same path: so that what is sought may be made clear to the seeker. And before I begin that, it is necessary for you to learn, my sons, what is in this chapter regarding the fear of what was discussed in the first chapter about cauterization.
And for that reason one must be especially cautious, since in the operation described in this chapter, evacuation often occurs with blood, which affects life at the opening of a vein, or incision over an abscess, or opening an exit wound, or treating a wound, or extracting an arrow, or incision over a stone, and similar actions: from all these is associated trembling, and fear, and death falls in many of them.
And I warn you, do not fall into that which causes hesitation, for sometimes different types of people with various illnesses come to you in this art.
For among them is one who becomes angry because of his illness, and for him death is near: due to the severity he feels from his illness and the length of his suffering.
And there is sickness from fear, which signifies death.
And among them is one who gives his money to you and enriches you with it, hoping for health, and his illness is deadly. Therefore, you should not agree to the one who comes to you from among them, whose manner is such.
And let your caution be stronger than your desire and greed.
And do not assume anything about it unless after certain knowledge, which confirms for you that to which a commendable succession leads.
And use prognosis and indication in the treatment of all your patients to determine what is most appropriately beneficial for their health.
For in that lies your help for acquiring fame and glory, and memory and praise.
May God inspire you, children, with His understanding, and may He not take from you direction and inspiration: for it is in His hand.
And indeed, I have organized this Chapter by dividing it into sections, as it proceeded in the chapter on Cauterization, from the neck down to the feet: so that you may be eased in seeking what you want from it, and what you need.
Concerning the treatment of water that accumulates in the heads of children.
Chapter I.
Know that this illness often occurs in children at the time of birth: or when the midwife presses the child's head without gentleness.
And it also happens at times for an unknown reason that is not understood.
And indeed, I have not seen this illness in anyone but children: and death hastened towards all whom I saw suffering from it. Therefore, it seemed to me to abandon the practice of operating on them.
And indeed, I saw among them a child whose head was filled with water, and his head grew larger each day until he could not sit on his own, because of the size of his head: and the swelling increased until he died.
And this swelling occurs either between the skin and bone, or beneath the bone near the surface.
And if the swelling is between the skin and bone and the abscess is small, then you should make a single cut in the middle of the head with a width of about one finger, and its length should be approximately two fingers wide, so that the fluid can drain.
And this is the form of spatumilis.
If the humidity is more increased, and the abscess is larger, then place those two incisions according to this form.
And if the humidity is beneath the bone, and its sign is that you see the sutures of the head open from all sides: and when you press it with your hand, water is forced inward, and this is not hidden from you: then it is necessary to cut in the middle of the head with three incisions, according to this method.
And after the incision, remove all the humidity.
Then apply a dressing to it from above with wine and oil until the fifth day.
Then remove the bandage and treat the wound with strips and ointments.
And do not bind the head too tightly.
And feed the patient with all dry food of little moisture until the limb is strengthened and healed.
And there is another method for the incision, which involves considering where the size of the abscess appears and the collection of water.
Because sometimes there is more in the back of the head, or at the top, or on the right, or on the left.
Therefore, make the incision where you see the abscess and the accumulation of water, and cut it as much as possible.
And be careful not to cut the artery, and let there not be a flow of blood, and let the patient not die from that flow with evacuation of humidity.
§ On cutting arteries which are behind the ears.
Chapter II.
When catarrh occurs in the eyes or chest and persists without improvement from medicinal treatment, then as a last resort, cutting these two arteries is considered.
Therefore, when you wish to cut them, the patient should shave his head.
Then rub the area with a rough cloth so that the arteries become visible.
Then the patient should compress his neck with any cloth available.
Then observe where the pulse beats.
And the locations of both arteries are in the areas behind the depressed part of the ears; they are rarely hidden, except in some individuals.
Then mark with wax on each side and cut both arteries using a sharp spatula, making the incision reach the bone: and ensure this is done across the width of the head.
And if you wish, insert the spatula under the artery and cut it upwards with an incision.
And the length of the incision should be about two joined fingers.
For when the artery is cut, blood exits in a pulsating flow, which jumps to the interior with frequent leaps.
If the artery does not appear to the senses, then you must measure a space of three fingers from the ear.
Then mark with melted wax and find until you reach the opening.
And what needs to be released from the blood is six ounces, and perhaps you will release more or less from it. All of this according to the quantity that appears to you from the strength of the sick person and the fullness of their artery.
Then examine the wound.
Then if there remains something to do near the opening of the wound, cut it so that a hot abscess does not occur; then dress the wound with cloths made of linen fabric.
Then treat it with ointment until it heals.
¶ On the extraction of arteries that are in the temples.
Chapter III.
When a person suffers from chronic headaches or acute catarrh due to acrid humors and heat in the temples, or severe chronic pain similar to these conditions: and they are treated with methods of medical care without improvement: then we have found it useful in such ailments to extract arteries from the temples or cauterize them, as we have described.
And the method of operation in extracting them is to shave the hair that is on the temples and then focus on the visible artery in the temple.
Indeed, it is shown to you by its pulse, and it is rarely hidden except in a few people or extreme cold.
If it is hidden from you, then let the sick person bind his head with any of his cloths; then rub the place with a rough cloth.
Or rinse the area with warm water until it becomes clearly apparent to you. Then take the spatula that I formed a little while ago. Then scrape off the skin with it easily until you reach the artery.
Then throw the hook into it and pull it up, until you pull it out of the skin and make it emerge from the layers beneath it on all sides.
If the artery is fine: then wrap it with the tip of the hook.
Then cut from it a portion according to the amount by which its ends are extended and drawn together, so that there is no loss of blood.
For if it is not cut and separated, the blood does not rise fully. Then draw out six ounces of blood, up to three times.
If the artery is large: then it is necessary to tie it in two places with double strong silk thread or with alhohod cords, so that it does not rot before the wound heals, and there is no loss of blood.
Then cut away the excess tissue that is between the two ligatures.
Do this at that hour, or after another hour. And if you wish, cauterize it with a cautery up to the mouth, using a knife-shaped cautery: until its extremities are cut, and it will stand in place of the same work.
And this is better work, unless the patient has a fever, or if the patient has a heated temperament.
Since cautery is one of those things that help to finish off humidities.
Therefore, it is a better remedy.
And after the arteries have been extracted, it is necessary for the place to be filled with an old clot: and decently made poultices should be applied to it.
And after the treatment is applied, it should be cured with drying medicines that help flesh to grow, and with pitch, until it is healed.
If during the operation a flow of blood occurs from an artery, then hurry to cut it with a cautery, or fill the place with lint: and press your hand until the blood is stopped.
If none of those things are present for you, then place your finger on the wound until the blood clots.
And apply a compress of water of extreme cold to the area until the sharpness subsides, and press as necessary.
And because it is lighter and easier to extract the artery, it is preferable to cauterize the vein with this cautery having two knives: let the sharpness of both knives be similar to that of an alloy.
However, they have much less sharpness than the two knives.
For if they are sharp, like two knives, both require cold: and do not cut flesh with speed.
Therefore, when there is some thickness in them, the heat of fire remains within them, and flesh is cut off quickly. This work is therefore better than all others, lighter, and easier.
And let the space between the two knives be the thickness of a finger where you mark two places with wax: and place both very hot until they reach the mouth, and cut the vein at two places: so that what is between the extremities may be lengthened.
For they do not consolidate completely with this cautery.
And this is the form of the cautery.
Concerning the treatment of continuous sharp tears from the eyes.
Chapter IV.
When the tears are continuous and their flow comes from veins that are on the outer surface of the skull: and medicine does not help in treating them with remedies, and you see the patient's face already red, and they feel a crawling sensation in their forehead, as if ants were crawling there: and their eyes are weakened, moist, to the point that the hair around them is corroded: and their eyelids are heated due to the sharpness of the tears: then the ancients used this operation for treating them, and they called it treatment with a knife.
And you should instruct the patient to shave the hair that is on their forehead.
Then cut three grooves in the forehead equidistant along its length: let each groove be about two fingers long, and one groove should be equidistant from the length of the nose at the middle of the forehead, and the second a little above the movement of the larynx, and the third on the other side; and beware of cutting into the arteries that are in both sides: and keep your hand away from the continuation of the two jaws, and let the space of all incisions be the length of three joined fingers: and have a piece of sponge prepared or many dried cloths with which to dry the blood.
Then insert two sharp-pointed probes, the following is its form.
From the incision on the side of the temple to the second incision: and remove with it all the skin that is between the two incisions, as if you were doing so above the eye. Then do the same from the middle incision to the second incision.
Then remove this probe and insert again into the first incision another instrument called a sharp spatula, which is blunt on one side and not sharp on the other.
And this is its form.
And place its sharp side towards the flesh attached with the skin, and its blunt side towards the bone: and push it until it reaches the middle groove: and cut away with it all vessels that descend from the head to the eyes: except that the incision continues until it appears through the skin.
Then do this from the middle groove to another groove.
And after an equal amount of blood has flowed out, press the areas from clotted pieces of blood. Then place old pottery shards in every fissure, and put poultices soaked in wine, oil, or vinegar on them.
And see that it does not result in a hot abscess.
And on the third day, remove the bandage, and administer much infusion with warm water.
Then treat it with basilicum ointment and other remedies used for wounds until it is healed.
Concerning the treatment of sharp tears and catarrhs to the eyes from the interior of the head.
Chapter 5.
When sharp, acrid, and persistent catarrhs occur to someone, and you see their eyes weakened, small, and already showing a debilitated appearance: and the eyelids are ulcerated, and hair falls from them, and there is a sharp pain deep in the head, accompanied by sneezing: then determine from these symptoms that such materials and catarrhs do not come unless from many veins.
And the better treatment for them is this.
And it is that you instruct the patient to shave their forehead.
Then make an incision in the forehead either one down the middle or slightly across, and begin with the incision from the left temple to the right temple: and let the cut go all the way to the bone: and keep your hand away from the temples, which move during chewing: until when the bone is exposed: and dry all the blood with a sponge.
Then separate between the two lips of the fissure with an old pot shard, or with lint from linen.
Then bind from above with poultices: and moisten the poultices with wine and oil, so that a hot abscess does not occur.
And when you loosen it, and see that the hot abscess is already diminishing: then you must treat the wound, until flesh begins to grow in it.
Then treat it with a drying regimen that promotes flesh growth: as if you take two parts of wheat flour and four parts of colophony: and prepare an ointment from them, to be applied at the beginning of flesh formation in these wounds.
Regarding the Treatment of an Injury to the Ear. Chapter 6. Anything that falls into the ear is one of four types: either a mineral stone, or something like a stone, such as iron and glass: or it comes from a plant, such as peas and beans: or it is a fluid substance, such as water, vinegar, and similar liquids: or it is an animal.
When a stone or something like it falls into the ear and does not adhere to or grow within the ear, expose the ear to light: if you see the stone, then drip something from violet oil or sesame oil into the ear.
Then administer the extraction of it, and make the person sneeze with something spicy, and plug the nose at the onset of a sneeze, after you place scraps of cloth or wool around the ear, and pull the ear upwards.
For often he goes out with this care.
But if he does not go out, then administer his removal with Gisti, that is, fine Pizigalore: its form is as follows.
If therefore he goes out with Gisti, it is good.
And if not, then administer his removal with a fine blunt hook of few foldings. If therefore he does not come out through that, then make a tube of copper, and insert the end of the tube into the hole of the ear much, and remove what is around the tube with softened wax mixed with oil, so that there be no passage except that of the tube: then extract it by means of your breath with strong suction. For often he goes out with what we have narrated.
But if he does not come out this way: then take a small amount of helkalimbat or flax, that is, prepared gluten with which birds are caught, and place it on the end of a thread after you have properly wrapped cotton around it: then insert it into the ear canal with ease after you have dried the ear of moisture.
If therefore he does not come out with all that we have narrated, then hurry to cut it open before a hot abscess or spasm occurs.
And the method of cutting is to have phlebotomists bleed the patient first in the head arteries: and let blood from him according to the measure of his strength.
Then have the patient sit between your hands, and turn his ear upwards, and make a small incision in a depressed area at the root of the ear near the fat: let the incision be crescent-shaped until you reach the stone: then remove it with whatever is possible for you using instruments.
Then proceed with speed and care to treat the wound from the time it occurs until it heals.
If something like a grain that grows and swells is lodged in the ear, then proceed with its removal.
但如果它不听从你的处理准备出来，那么取一根细小的探针，按照这种形状。
并且用它来移除那些掉进耳朵里的谷粒的特定部分，不要在你以为那颗谷粒已经被耳内的蒸汽湿润时就进行处理，直到将其切成许多小块；然后用钩子、细棒或吸力将其取出，如前所述，因为这样可以减轻其取出的难度。
当水进入耳朵时，病人应首先通过打喷嚏来尝试排出水分，并且他应该用一些煮过的盐填充受影响的耳朵；然后躺在那一侧，让水流出。
如果因此它能够排出，那是好的。
如果不能排出，那么取一些长度与手指相当的细小、柔软的石头，并用火稍微加热它们；病人应将其中一块放入耳朵的孔中，然后跳起并用另一块石头轻轻敲打进入耳朵中的那块石头。
不要停止用石头这样操作，直到所有的水都排出为止。
此时，水会排出，你可以取一根芦苇或类似的材料，将其一端放入耳朵中，然后点燃另一端，直到燃烧掉大部分材料。
Then take another piece of rush, and do this many times until all the water comes out: and remove her with the tube as was stated on the stone.
In the extraction of an animal entering into it, if it is of small body, like a flea and similar to it, take care of it as I said in the division.
But if it is of large body, which appears to the senses: then administer its removal with hooks and forceps: and its treatment is easier than all those that are held in the ear.
In the extraction of a worm generated in the ear, when you treat it as we said in the division and in the chapter on distillation, and your treatment is not effective: then you must look at the ear in sunlight.
If therefore something appears there from the worms, then extract it with forceps or with fine hooks.
If however nothing appears there, then take a tube which has this form, narrow below and wide above: and insert the slender end into the ear according to the amount that the patient can tolerate: then suck with strong suction.
Do this many times until all the worms come out.
If however they do not obey you and come out, then scrape around the tube with a curette, as I said on the stone.
If they do not come out as I have said: then administer distillations which the ancients have already used for killing worms: and you will find this in the chapter on distillations.
And let your pouring be with this instrument when you pour oil and medicines into the ear, as its form is depicted here.
As you see, make it of silver or brass, narrower below, with a small hole, and wider above.
Let the part that pushes what is inside the concavity of the tube be made of brass, properly fashioned.
And if you wish, take a rod and wrap its end with cloth appropriately. Then pour oil, juice, or any of these medicines into the tube; place it in the ear. Then insert the rod with the cloth above and press it gently with your hand until the oil is pushed into the concavity of the hearing area, so that the patient feels it internally. And what is poured into the ear should be warmed slightly over a fire, and beware that what distills into it is not very cold, for medicines do not tolerate this.
¶ On the Treatment of Blockage of the Ear.
Chapter VII.
Sometimes infants emerge from their mothers' wombs with the ear canals not perforated.
And it also happens to some adults that blockage occurs in the ear canal due to an injury or flesh grown within it.
And this blockage sometimes occurs deep within the ear canal, where it cannot be seen; and at other times it affects the outer part of the ear canal slightly, and can be seen.
That which occurs deep within the ear and which is not visible to the eye is generally difficult to treat in many cases.
And when you come to what the eye sees, you must place the sick person's ear in the sun and look at it. If you see a visible discharge, open it with a fine probe whose shape is as follows: its tip should be slightly wide but with one sharp point, while the rest of the probe should have two smooth sides so that it does not injure the ear.
If the discharge is caused by flesh grown in the ear canal, then hold it with a fine hook and cut it away with great ease until all the flesh is removed.
If the discharge is deep within the ear, then take a fine, smooth probe and heat it slightly with fire. Then insert it into the ear canal.
If you feel the discharge when the patient complains of a heaviness in hearing, try to open it with ease, and be careful not to injure the nerves of the ear.
Then place a piece of wax in the ear according to the size of the opening, which you have wrapped in Egyptian ointment. Do this for several days until you are sure that the wound has healed.
Or take wax and mix it with rose water, then sprinkle finely ground sugar over it, and use it.
If you see that the ear has become abscessed, then it is necessary to remove the wax and treat it with fresh wax wrapped in a cloth made with rose oil until the abscess softens. Then continue treating it until it heals.
If there is a flow of blood, then soak a sponge or cloth in cold water and apply it to the ear. Use the remaining treatment that stops the bleeding, as described in the chapter on distillations.
On the treatment of cataracts of the eyelids.
Chapter VIII. These cataracts that occur in the eyelid of the eye are sometimes moist and sometimes dry.
Therefore, you should hold them with forceps: or with an hook, and cut them with a knife from their roots.
Then apply ground wheat to the affected areas.
If, however, blood flows from them, then cauterize them with a fine lentil-shaped cautery.
And cauterizing them is better after the incision.
For they often return when something remains of their roots.
And when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned up, and they do not return.
On the treatment of granulation in the eyelid of the eye.
Chapter IX.
Often something occurs in the eyelids that resembles granulation in its strength and hardness, and because of this it is called a granuloma: and it is an aggregation of thick moisture in the upper eyelid and the lower eyelid.
The procedure for treating them is to check whether the granuloma that appears on the eyelid moves to all parts and if its condition is easy.
Therefore, find a fissure across its width.
Then scrape it from all sides with ease until it comes out.
Then suspend it with a hook and cut it away.
If, however, it is not prepared for removal unless you penetrate the eyelid with a slight incision, then this harms the patient in some way.
If the split is large, then stitch it together and care for it until it heals.
And if it is small, no harm will come from it.
For ointment restores it and causes it to heal.
And if a stone has shifted toward the inner ear towards the inner surface, then turn the eyelid inside out, and suspend the stone with a hook; moreover, you will need an incision and press it from all sides.
If the eyelid is extended by an incision, it does no harm.
Then wash the eye after the incision with salt water, and treat the area with something that promotes healing until the patient is healed.
Concerning the treatment of styes on the eyelids.
Chapter 10.
Axirnath is a fatty substance that forms in the inner folds of the upper eyelid. It most commonly affects children: it burdens their eyes and causes them to have catarrhs in the mornings, so much so that they cannot look at the light of the sun because their tears flow quickly towards them. As a result, you see them lying down with their faces on the bed, and they sleep with it, and their eyelids under the eyebrows are wet, which has already been covered by swelling. The prominence of Axirnath is visible to the eye, and when you press the area with your fingers, you can feel the Axirnath between them.
And the method of the procedure is that the patient places his head in your armpit.
Then take a linen cloth and prepare licorice in it, and make a circle of that licorice according to the quantity that an Axirnath contains on all sides.
Then place it on her, and press with your fingers on all sides so that the Axirnath aggregates in the center of the circle.
Then find in the middle of that moisture with a spatula small cracks across their width, and let there not be a crack larger than that which occurs in phlebotomy at its depth.
Or you must cut the skin entirely until you reach the Axirnath, for in many conditions the Axirnath emerges from a crack in the shape of a piece of white fat.
So extract it with the cloth you have infused between your fingers to the outer parts: and you turn your hand to the right and left until it disperses: and be careful not to add anything in the crack, so that you do not reach with a spatula to the eye and damage it.
But if the Axirnath does not appear to you at the beginning of the crack, you should add a little to the crack with ease until the Axirnath comes forth.
Then extract it as we have said.
Then soak the cloths in vinegar and water, place them on the area, and bind it with poultices.
And there are those who rub salt and place it in the hollow of the crack, so that it liquefies what remains of that moisture.
Then treat it until it is healed.
但如果在一个部位发生热性脓肿，那么用止痛膏药治疗它，直到愈合。
关于Ataxmir的眼病，即当眼睑变得柔软时，导致眼睛不应有的磨损。
第十一章。
当眼睛的眼睑上生长出超出正常范围的额外毛发，并且这些毛发随着时间变得老化时，它们会对眼睛造成伤害，导致各种疾病的发生，如持续流泪、眼睑变软和白膜形成，最终可能导致眼睛的破坏。
阿塔克米尔的眼病根据四种方法进行治疗。 或者使用火灼疗法。
或者使用锐利的药物治疗，如前文所述的章节中关于火灼疗法的部分所描述的。
或者通过切开和缝合来治疗阿塔克米尔眼病。
或者通过使用导管，如我将要描述的那样。
必须让病人把头放在你的怀里。
然后用你的左手翻开眼睑。
如果因此翻开了，那就很好。
如果翻不开，就用针从眼睑的下部插入，让针和线一起穿过，使线靠近睫毛本身，即靠近睫毛生长的眼睑边缘，并将线拉向上方，同时翻开眼睑。
Then find in the inner part of the eyelid among the added hairs with the spatula touching from the larger tear duct to the smaller tear duct.
Then remove the thread, and place a small piece of cotton or cloth under the eyelid; then mark on the eyelid with wax, which should resemble the shape of a myrtle leaf.
However, it is necessary that it be shaped according to the size and elevation of the eyelid: since this now varies among people.
For there are those who need a large portion of the eyelid to be cut according to the amount that is softened by the eyelid. Then with the spatula find along the two lines that you marked, and begin from the larger tear duct to the smaller tear duct, and let the incision be close to the natural hairs, as thick as the width of a hair.
Then insert the hook into one of the two corners of the skin. Then remove the entire piece of tissue. Then sew together the two edges with a needle and fine wool thread. And clean the blood, and make it adhere so that any excess thread does not protrude above both eyebrows, if you wish to do this: and if not, do not worry about it.
Then leave the stitches and threads for three days or four: after that, take care of it. And if you wish, leave the wound without stitches and treat it with something that dries and contracts.
For the eyelid should be raised at the sealing of the wound and its union; but it will be better in the future.
This method of treatment was taught by the ancients to Ataxmir.
Nevertheless, there is concern for the sick person, and it comes from good practice, and there is no fear in it.
And there is another method used by Ataxmir as well: it involves marking a figure on the eyelid that resembles the shape of a myrtle leaf, as we have described.
Then raise the eyelid with three separate or joined hooks, following the shape described below. Then cut away what is superfluous using small forceps, following this shape, with equal precision in the incision.
但如果无法使用钩子或不能保持平衡，那么取一根带有线的针，将其插入形状的中央。再在较大的泪腺附近插入一根线，在较小的泪腺附近插入另一根线，并均匀地将这些线夹在你的手指之间。
Then raise your hand with an even lift: and raise the skin on which the mark is made, as we have described.
Then bring together the two lips of the wound with stitches: and take care of it until it heals.
但如果你的切口或伤口裂开处出现脓肿，用含有止痛成分的软膏和类似药物来缓解它。
有时也会发生睫毛倒生长的情况。
Concerning the treatment of Ataxmir with canes.
And it is necessary to turn the eyelid and cut the cleft that is inside, as I have described.
Then skillfully make two canes or two thin sticks: the length of which should be according to the length of the eyelid, and their width should be less than the width of a thread: and now cut at the ends of each from both sides where you hold the threads.
Then attach each one carefully over what protrudes from the edge of the eyelid, and tie the two canes tightly from both sides with a firm stitch, and leave it for several days. For the tightened skin will die, turn black, and putrefy until it falls off on its own.
If it is delayed, then cut it with forceps.
Then treat it until it heals.
When it has thus healed, the eyelid will be raised: and the hairs will no longer sting.
And this is the shape of the two canes, which you will make according to this figure, and in quantity regarding length and width.
Concerning the raising of stinging hairs in the eye with a needle.
Chapter XII.
The procedure is to take a fine needle and insert a thin, soft silk thread into it. Then join the ends together, and tie a very fine knot at each end: and let the length of the thread be one palm.
Then place another fine thread beneath it at a short distance, and if you wish, tie the ends of this thread.
Then let the patient place his head in your lap, and position him near the sun so that the operation can be clearly seen: for the operation is subtle or delicate.
Then insert the needle with the thread into the root of the eyelid, and make it penetrate quickly into the lid until you pull it out from above a natural hair.
Then pull the hair up over the thread: and insert this hair into the thread: if it is one, or two, or three, not more.
Then pull your hand with it until the hair comes out with the thread from the eyelid along with a natural hair.
If, however, the thread is pulled and the hair does not come out with it: pull the thread downwards, along with the thread you prepared for it, until the thread exits from the upper opening, and you see it with your eye: then you will pull both the thread and the filament; remove them both, and close the eye: and leave it closed for two days or three, until the hair adheres to its place, and flesh grows over it.
If the hair is short, then either attach a longer hair from among the natural hairs to it and pull it up with that one: or leave it as it is, until it grows longer over time, and then pull it up.
On the treatment of al-xatrati, which occurs in the upper eyelid.
Chapter XIII.
When this al-xatrati occurs in the eye, it is called Leporina.
And this al-xatrati is either natural or accidental.
The accidental al-xatrati is caused by the healing of a wound, cutting, cauterization, or similar treatments.
The method of treatment is to cut through that hardened tissue, separate its edges, place a piece of linen between them, and bind it until it heals.
And you should not use drying and constricting substances in its treatment; for if you do that, the al-xatrati will be worse than it was. Rather, use substances that soften, such as fenugreek: and apply it with water in which mallows and flax seeds have been boiled: and anoint it with dyaquilon ointment, which has been melted with some oil: and wrap it with linen and treat it thusly.
And the key to your treatment is to try by every means to prevent it from hardening, according to its original form.
And this operation that we have described is merely a correction of the al-xatrati, to prevent it from returning to its original form completely. On the treatment of al-xatrati which occurs in the lower eyelid, and it is a wrinkle or contraction upward to the right and left.
Chapter XIV.
This is what is done below and is truly called Alxatrati.
And it is natural, and it is accidental.
And the accidental occurs from a wound, or a crack, or cauterization, and things similar to these.
And the way of operation in it is to take a needle, on which there is double thread, and dip it into the flesh, and make it penetrate from the left lachrymal bone to the right lachrymal bone until the thread reaches both extremities of the flesh.
Then stretch the flesh towards the upper part with a needle, and cut it with a thin blade.
If the shape of the eyelid thus returns as it should, it is good.
And if not, take a probe and place it in the crack, and turn the eyelid with it: and make two cuts on the inner side of the eyelid, and let the ends of both cuts be from the two corners of the incision until they meet and form an angle: until when they come together, they form this shape, which is the Greek letter lambda.
Then remove that piece of flesh in the quantity of what is its sharp lower side from where it follows the eyelid.
Then join the separated parts: or sew them together with thread.
Then treat them with what we have said about softening medicines and applications until they heal.
And if Alxatrati occurs from a split, and stitching, or cauterization: then it is necessary that you make the split even among the hairs of the eyelids, also according to what preceded.
Then separate between the two lips with a lancet, as we have said.
And the summary of the discussion on the treatment of Alxatrati, when it is above or below, is that the procedure should proceed swiftly according to how it is prepared from the form of Alxatrati.
For it is indeed of many varieties in form: and the prudent artisan prepares his method in whatever way it is possible for him, until he restores the figure to its natural form or close to it, and even the sick person himself, according to what befits him from the operation and instruments in numerous circumstances.
Concerning the adherence of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or cornea.
Chapter XV.
This adhesion sometimes occurs in many people, such that the upper eyelid adheres to the white of the eye and prevents it from performing its natural functions.
Therefore, you must insert the tip of a probe under the eyelid and lift it up: or extend it with a hook. Then cut the adhesion with a blunt spatula, which should not be sharp for cutting but slightly rounded: so that the patient is not disturbed during the operation, and remove the spatula without harming the eye with its sharpness: and make your incision as if you are gently peeling off the adhesion until the eyelid returns to its natural form, and the entire adhesion is healed.
Then pour salty water into the eye and wash it with water: or distill into it from a sieve made of ziniar dissolved in water.
Then separate between the eyelid and the eye with lint made of flax: and place on the eye wool soaked in egg white: and after three days use a sieve, and with hardeners, until it is healed.
Concerning the cutting of the nail and the protruding flesh of the eyelids.
Chapter XVI.
Know that the nail is in two ways. Or it is nervous: and it is similar to a thin, hard shell.
Or it is not nervous, similar to frozen white moisture: which when you touch with iron, or try to grasp it with a hook, it breaks off and the hook does not hold onto it.
And both types do not begin except at the larger tear duct, gradually spreading until they cover the vision, and obstruct the light and movement of the eye.
And the method of operation in cutting it is: the patient should place his head in your lap.
Then open his eyes and lift the eyelid with your hand.
Then grasp the nail with a small hooked instrument and extend it upwards.
Then take a needle and insert into it a hair from horse or cow fur, and the thread should be strong, and double the tip of the needle slightly, and fix it in the middle of the nail: and pierce it with the needle, and tie it with thread, and extend it upwards: and scrape with the hair the side of the nail that follows the pupil, as if you were cutting it with the hair to the very end.
Then cut the remainder at the root of the lacrimal with a fine scalpel or small forceps: and leave the natural lacrimal tissue untouched, so that a constant flow of tears does not result from cutting it.
And sometimes the flap is extended with just a hook: or with a thread, as we have said.
Then it is scraped off with a gentle scalpel, which has this form.
And be careful that the scalpel does not touch the cornified membrane, so that it does not rupture and cause a perforation of the pupil.
Then after the incision, put some ground salt or a lotion made of zinc into the eye, and leave it until another day.
Then treat it with what is necessary until it heals. If the flap is not nerve-filled and you cannot insert a needle into it, nor does a hook hold in it, then this type of flap is often treated with medications and heals as I have described in the division.
If you wish to cut it, then open the sick person's eye and take a fine, gentle scalpel with slight sharpness, in this form.
And carefully scrape the flap from above with delicacy.
If you see that it becomes thin and breaks, and the scraper presses upon it, then drip from your lotion made of zinc, or red lotion, or ground salt into the eye: and treat the eye until another day.
Then repeat the procedure on the same area until everything is completely removed.
Unless there is a warm abscess in your eye: then let it be left alone, and treat the abscess until it heals. Then repeat the procedure on it with caution, until it is healed.
However, if the prominence of the lacrimal flesh causes great harm to the eye, suspend it with a hook and cut a part from it: and do not proceed too far with the cutting so that the flow of tears is not impaired.
Then apply drops of red myrtle juice, or one made from cinnabar, until it heals. Concerning the incision of an alguardenic and flesh growth in the eye.
Chapter XVII.
At times, a red flesh growth or overlay may develop in some people's eyes, covering the pupil, approaching it, or stretching over the eyelids, and sometimes turning the eyelids outward: it resembles a rose bud.
And the treatment for this condition also requires that the patient place their head in your lap.
Then open the patient's eyes and remove that flesh entirely using suitable hooks: and hold it with one forceps.
Then cut the flesh initially, until the entire growth is removed with scissors.
And be careful around the eye so that you do not injure it during the operation: and let your cutting instrument, whether spatulated or with small forceps used for extracting hairs, be appropriate to its form as described after this chapter.
When your incision is complete and all the bandages are removed, then fill the eye with powdered salt: or pour onto it red powder and similar medicines that corrode: and place a cloth soaked in egg white over the eye externally: to secure it from a hot abscess.
If some of the bandages remain and hot blood dominates you, and you fear a hot abscess: then leave the eye as it is, and treat it with what calms the abscess.
Then repeat the treatment on it until it is healed.
And similarly treat added flesh that occurs in the eye from this type of condition.
However, it is necessary that you handle the treatment of any weak eye either naturally or accidentally by using iron: and do not introduce your hand into any of these operations until you see that the member can tolerate that operation.
Paragraph on draining pus from the eye.
Chapter Eighteen. Sewels are red veins that form over the eye and prevent vision from functioning properly: and they weaken the eye over time.
Therefore, you must first consider whether the eye with the sewel is strong and does not have any illness other than the sewel: then drain the sewel from that eye.
And you should instruct the patient to place their head in your lap.
Then suspend those veins with one or two hooks according to your discretion: and the hook should be fine and double, in this shape, or there should be two hooks gradually in one body, in this shape.
Then collect with fine tweezers those veins with care, and remove the blood hour by hour until you see those veins removed from the eye, and they resolve: and be careful not to injure the eye with the extremities of the fine forceps.
And let your work be at noon in the presence of the sun, and be very firm in your work: so that you do not cut anything but those veins.
And when you have finished, then let drops of green or red silk be applied to the eye: so that with its sharpness it may dissolve what remains from the operation.
But if it is not possible for you to collect all of that at that hour, then apply a poultice to the eye with something that relieves pain: and leave it for several days until the pain subsides: and secure it from hot inflammation: then proceed upon it in the same manner, until it heals.
And this is the form of the tweezers.
¶ On the Reduction of the Deviated Septum to the Nose.
Chapter XIX.
Doctors call the Deviated Septum Fistula, which you treat with cauterization or with sharp medicine, depending on its previous condition as described.
And if it does not heal, then there is no ingenuity in it other than to cut into the abscess near its origin, and extract all the moisture and pus that are within it until the bone is exposed.
When the bone is exposed and you see decay or blackness in it, then scrape it with an instrument whose form is as follows.
And it is called Rough Head.
Make it from smooth iron, and let its head be round like a dirham, which is marked with fine engravings like those of a file or a chisel, and place it on the corrupted part of the bone. Then rotate it between your fingers and press it briefly with your hand until you know that the corruption has been scraped away: do this several times.
Then rotate it between your fingers and press it briefly with your hand until you know that the corruption has been scraped away: do this several times. Then restore the place with drying and astringent medicines.
If the place then consolidates, and flesh grows in it, and the pus flow stops; and for forty days it does not recur, does not abscess, and no accident occurs to it: then know that it is healed.
And if not, then there is no option but to reduce the fistula to the nasal passage, following this method.
And it is such that you should expose the second bone with iron or with sharp medicine: and when the bone is exposed, then take a drill in this form, with an iron tip shaped like a triangle: and its wooden part should be slender until the tip, as you can see.
Then place it on the bone itself: and let it be near the lacrimal bone: and keep your hand a little away from the eye.
Then rotate your hand with the drill until it penetrates the bone, and let the patient feel it: by this when the patient feels air coming out of it, as they hold their hand over their nose.
Therefore then restore the place with astringent drying medicines as I have taught you.
When flesh is formed and the area becomes hardened, then the substance that was flowing outward returns to its origin; therefore, this is less burdensome for the patient.
Concerning the Reduction of a Prominent Eye. Chapter 20.
When an eye protrudes along with the entire surrounding tissue, and there is no harm to vision or reduction in size, then you should relieve the patient: bleed them; afterwards, apply cupping vessels to the neck without incisions but with suction.
Then apply a poultice to the eye made from acacia, aloes, frankincense, and succonium.
Then bind the eye above with a plaster covered in many small poultices.
The method for the poultices is as follows: take soft cloths, many of them, and fold each cloth over four times; make many of these. Then place them one on top of another according to the size needed for the eye. Finally, bind them tightly with a tough cloth bandage.
And repeat the cupping without incisions but with suction.
Then remove the cupping vessels and leave the eye bound day and night.
If the ligament becomes loose again, then it must be bound tightly once more; afterwards, remove the binding after one day and night, as we have said.
If you see that the eye has already returned to its socket, it is good; and if not, then apply the poultice again, and the powder, and compression, and suction cups, until it is healed.
Concerning the Incision of the Eyelid.
Chapter XXI.
When a tear occurs in the eyelid and protrudes beyond the eyelids like a grain of sand, disfiguring the person's appearance because of it, and you wish to cut it: then the procedure is as I describe: it involves inserting an instrument at the base of the eyelid from the lower to the upper part.
Then insert another needle with double thread from the lacrimal side, and make it penetrate: and release the first needle according to its position.
Then cut the place where the double thread is, and ligate with it the part of the eyelid around the needle: and compress it tightly.
Then remove the needle, and place a woolen cloth soaked in egg white over the eye: and leave it until the thread falls out with the eyelid.
Then treat the eye with something that strengthens it until the wound heals.
And sometimes the eyelid is compressed from all sides with a circular bandage made of cloth until the eye becomes significantly swollen.
Then it should be perforated with a very fine probe that reaches the depth of the eye, allowing the moisture to flow and the eye to settle; then compress it until it heals.
Regarding the treatment of Alcomnati.
Chapter XXII.
This ailment called Alcomnati is not actually a discharge, but rather a collection of pus in the eye, similar to water dripping down, and it is not that discharge itself.
And the method of treating it is to have the patient sit on a prepared chair or a straight seat.
Then take the patient's head in your hands from both sides and move it until you see the pus coming down to the lower part of the eye.
Then apply pressure to keep it from descending, and clear the light: and have the patient see things as they did before. And if it does not go down below, know that it is water.
但如果脓液没有按照我们所说的那样下降，那么让患者坐在你的双手之间。 然后取一根细探针，在角膜与结膜连接处的巩膜上轻轻刺入，直到脓液排出。
当脓液排出后，滴入温水中混合了蜂蜜的水进入眼睛；或者滴入已经煮沸过希腊草和蜂蜜的水中。然后按照其余的治疗步骤进行治疗，直到痊愈。
关于治疗流入眼睛的水，或白内障的护理。
Chapter XXIII.
我们现在已经讨论了水的种类和区分，以及哪些适合通过言语来描述和解释，然后按照健康的标准采取相应的措施。
Then have the patient sit between your hands facing away from the light, near the sun: and bind his healthy eye tightly: then press with your right hand the eyelid of the affected eye if it is the left eye: or with your left hand if it is the right eye.
Then take with your right hand the almond, if the eye is the left one: or with your left hand, if the eye is the right one.
Then place the tip of the almond near the cornea, at the thickness of a radius on the white part of the eye near the lower tear duct: then push the almond with force: and you rotate your hand with it until it penetrates into the whites of the eye: and you feel that the almond has now reached the empty space.
And it is necessary that the measure of the almond's travel be to the depth, the measure of the space from the pupil to the end of the blackness: and this is the circumference of the eye.
For you will see it in the pupil of the eye itself, due to the clarity of the corneal tissue.
Then place the almond until it reaches the place where the water is.
Then press it below once after another.
If the water descends immediately, then the patient will see it as soon as their vision opens, and the almond in his eye.
Then rest for a little while.
If the water descends, then place it second, except that the almond should come out.
When it is therefore fixed and does not rise: then remove the almond with ease: and you turn your hand gradually. Then dissolve something of clear salt crystals in water: and wash the eye with it from within.
Then place over the eye a poultice of flax or wool soaked in rose oil, and egg white: and bind the healthy eye with it.
We, and those of our time, place over it ground cumin with egg white.
If the almond does not obey you upon entering the eye due to its hardness, since it comes from humans and whose eye is very hard: then you must take a small piece of what is called Alberid, which has this form.
Therefore, use the pefora with it just to connect it, and do not insert your hand into the opening: and it is only meant to make a narrow path for the almond.
Then insert the almond as we have said.
And at the completion of your work, prepare for the patient a decently made bedroom in which he may sleep on his back in a dark room: and prevent him from all movements and from coughing: and give him food that soothes his nature: and do not let him move his head right or left at all.
And let the bandage remain in place according to his condition until the third day. Then remove it in that dark room and test his vision: and have him look at objects.
Then reduce the ligature until the seventh day.
And it is not necessary for him to do this at the time of treatment or immediately after cutting; rather, he should wait, because water rises quickly due to a strong gaze.
But if a hot abscess occurs, then you should release the eye before the seventh day and treat it with something that calms the abscess until it is soothed. Then free his vision and place an occlusive on his face to regulate his sight for several days while he remains in a dark room.
Then he should gradually leave the house and return to his own rooms.
And know that in zalta (a type of medicine or procedure), the student is not exempt from vision exercises; then he may dare to undertake the operation.
And indeed, one of those who came from Alayrach has told us that a perforated jar was used in Alayrach to draw water.
Therefore, I have not seen anyone in your land who has done this, nor have I read about it in any of the ancient books. It is possible that this is something new.
And these are the forms of signs from the jar, so that those who do not know it will recognize them.
They should be made of pure copper: and their extremities should be finely triangular, with sharp points.
Forms of the jar.
¶ On the Treatment of Flesh Growths on the Nose.
Chapter XXIV.
Sometimes flesh of various kinds is born in the nose, from which there arises something that resembles a many-footed scorpion: and from it there is a cancerous piece of hard, dark-colored flesh: and from it there is also a softer piece of flesh that is not dark-colored.
In the case of that which is soft and not deceitful or cancerous among these pieces of flesh, you should have the patient sit between your hands facing away from the sun, and open his nostrils. Then throw in an uncus (hook) into those fleshes: then draw them outward, and cut what you have grasped with a fine sharp spatula on one side until you know that all the flesh has now been removed.
If any part remains of that which cannot be cut away: then scrape it with one of the fine instruments with ease until nothing more remains.
But if blood overpowers you, or a hot abscess occurs: then apply what is necessary to it: or if it is from malignant abscesses, then hasten to cauterize it until the blood is cut off, and all the flesh is removed.
Then vinegar, water, or wine should be poured into the nose after the incision.
But if the nose is opened and moisture proceeds from it to the palate, then you know that it is now healed.
But if the moisture does not penetrate as it should, then you know that within there is flesh born on the upper bones of the nose, to which the instrument did not reach with the incision.
Then it is necessary to insert a linen thread of some thickness, with many knots in it: and place between each knot the length of a finger or less: and the patient will devise how to send one end of the thread into the nose with a probe, or whatever he can use after which he should do as has been described: and pull out his smelly matter until it reaches the throat and exits through his mouth.
And indeed, many times they do something like this for the boy Attom in schools: and it is an easy thing for one who wants to do it.
Then place the two ends of the thread, one that comes out over the nose, and the other that remains in the nose.
Then, as the attendant cuts the flesh at the knots that are in the thread. Do this until you know that the flesh is now with the knots of the thread.
Then remove the thread: and place into the nose after cleaning the blood a linen strip that has been soaked in Egyptian ointment: do this for three days or more, until the ointment wears down everything that remains of the flesh.
Then place a lead tube in the nose for several days until it heals.
If, however, treatment that dries [the wound] is needed, use it.
For making the purging solution for the head, when olive oil and other medicines are to be dripped into the nose, make it of silver or copper: let it be like a small lamp, open like a shell: and its nozzle similarly.
And if you want to make a closed tube, like a tube.
And the shell of the instrument for making the purging solution for the head should be full and open: it should have a handle at its end with which you hold it when heating oil or anything you want from decoctions and liquids in it.
And this is the form of the instrument. ¶ On the Treatment of Nasal Ulcers.
Chapter XXV.
Often, ulcers arise at the end of the nose, and they grow larger and increase with days until their appearance becomes unsightly.
And for this reason, it is necessary to treat it at the onset of its appearance and to remove its root completely.
Then apply either a cautery or a burning medicine that will stay in its place.
If therefore the incision of it is delayed until it has become enlarged, then observe if it is stony, hard, dark in color, and insensitive to touch: then do not cut it with iron, for it is a cancerous abscess.
For I have often seen that when one incises such an abscess, it results in great harm to the one who has it.
And if the abscess is soft to the touch, not dark in color, and you see that it can be incised all around, then evacuate the patient's fluids, and cut it without fear, without hesitation: and treat the area with something that dries and contracts it until it heals.
¶ On sewing up the nose, lip, and ear.
Chapter XXVI.
Know that when there is a disruption of continuity in one of these cartilages, surgery is not very effective, except in certain individuals.
Therefore, when someone sustains an injury from that, you must observe if it is a recent wound with bleeding: then bring the edges of the wound together with stitches, and treat it until it heals.
And if the edges of the wound are already separated and each part is clean and healthy: then you must remove all parts down to the visible skin until it bleeds.
Then bring the two edges together with stitches and secure them, and dust over it powdered dragon's blood and ground frankincense: and place a piece of soft pliable dressing soaked in diafinicon, and another from consolidating plaisters: and leave it bound for two or three days.
Then loosen it, and change the medicine: and leave it until the threads come off by themselves. Then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
The method of sewing is to bring together the separated parts, either with stitches, as we have described for abdominal surgery; or to join the edges with thread, as I have taught you.
§ On the Extraction of Knots from the Lips.
Chapter XXVII. Many people experience hard growths inside their lips, similar to grains of grass seeds; some are smaller, and others are larger.
Therefore, you must turn the lip inside out, cut along every knot, and use a hook to suspend it, then cut it away from all sides.
Then fill the place after the cut with powdered rue until the bleeding stops.
Then wash it with vinegar, and treat the area with it where there is astringency until the wounds heal.
§ On the Incision of Flesh Grown Over the Gum.
Chapter XXVIII. Flesh often grows over the gum, which the ancients called abuluss.
Therefore, you must suspend it with a hook: or hold it with forceps and cut it at its root, allowing pus to drain or blood to flow.
Then place over the affected area ground zegi, or other astringent powders.
If that flesh returns after treatment, for it often does return, then cut it a second time and cauterize it: for it does not return after cauterization.
¶ On the Reason for Treating Teeth with Iron.
Chapter XXIX.
At times, aggregates form on the surfaces of teeth both from the inner and outer parts, and between the gums, there are rough, unpleasant, and sometimes darkened areas that turn yellow or green until the corruption spreads to the gum, and the teeth become foul because of it.
Therefore, you must have the patient sit between your hands, and place their head in your lap. Scrape the molars and teeth where you see rough coatings that resemble sand, until nothing remains of them. Do the same for black spots, greenish discolorations, yellowing, and other such issues until they are cleaned.
If what needs to be removed is taken away from the beginning according to reason, it is good. But if not, then repeat the procedure on them another day, a second time, and a third time, until ultimately you achieve your goal through persistent effort.
And you should know that a tooth requires scraping with tools of various shapes and forms, depending on the preparation for your procedure: therefore, the scraper used to scrape the tooth from its lower part is different from the one used between the teeth, according to other forms.
And you should have these forms of scrapers prepared, which you see.
Concerning the Extraction of Tooth Pain.
Chapter XXX.
One must treat a tooth of its pain with all skill and delay its extraction.
For there is nothing that can replace it once it is extracted: for it is a lofty substance. However, when there is no excuse for its extraction, then it must be done when the patient is forced to extract it, so that it may be strengthened, and you should confirm with the patient the painful tooth.
For often the pain deceives the patient, and they think there is decay in the tooth and extract it. Then the pain does not subside until the diseased tooth is extracted.
For we have already seen this from the practice of bloodletters.
When you have confirmed the painful tooth with the patient, then it is necessary to make an incision around the tooth using a spatula that has some medicinal properties until the gums are separated on all sides. Then move it with your fingers or with fine forceps initially gradually, until you agitate the tooth.
Then place the patient's head between your knees, so that you hold it securely and it does not move. Then pull the tooth straight so as not to break it.
If it does not come out, then take one of those instruments and insert it under the tooth from all sides with ease, and try to move it as you did initially.
If the tooth is perforated or corroded, then it is necessary to fill that hole with a cloth and compress it with the tip of a fine probe so that it does not break when you grasp it with forceps.
And you must act carefully with incisions around the gums on all sides.
And guard your strength so that you do not break it and leave a part of it behind, which could return to harm the patient with greater pain than at first.
And be careful not to do what ignorant bleeders do out of haste and their own boldness in removing it, other than what we have described.
For they often cause great illnesses in people, which are difficult to cure, leaving all or some of its roots behind, or extracting it along with certain bones of the jaw, as we have testified many times. Then rinse after removing it with wine, or with vinegar and salt. If bleeding occurs from the area (this often happens), then crush some zegi and fill the place with it. And if you do not have zegi, cauterize it if zegi is not available to you.
The forms of fine forceps used to move a tooth should have long ends, short handles, and be thick so that they do not bend when pressing on the tooth. The handles should be wide enough that they do not pinch your fingers or bend when you squeeze them. They should have short ends and be made of pure iron or well-made steel with straight ends: and at their ends there should be teeth, some of which fit into others to grasp firmly with proper constriction.
And sometimes the ends are shaped like the beak of a bird called a heron, and they provide a strong grip.
Concerning the removal of teeth and the extraction of fractured jawbones.
Chapter XXXI.
When some of the tooth that is being removed breaks off, then you should place on the site a poultice with butter for one or two days until the area softens. Then insert into it an instrument similar to the beak of a bird called a heron, either an algastum (a surgical tool) or forceps.
The shape of the forceps is as follows.
Their tips should be made like the inside of a file: or like an aliskilfegi.
If these forceps do not suffice for the extraction, then you should dig around the root and expose all the flesh, and insert an instrument called a small lever, whose shape is as follows.
Let the tip be short and somewhat thick: and let it not be too flexible, so that it does not break.
If the root comes out with it, that is good: and if not, you should assist with these other instruments whose shapes are as follows.
The shape of the first instrument has a triangular tip, with some thickness.
The shape of the triangular tip is fine and slender.
Also, you may use an instrument with two branches, whose shape is as follows. And with other instruments and tools that have been mentioned previously in relation to teeth.
Also let there be a helper with this instrument which resembles a large hooked claw, of this shape, with a twisted triangular end, where there is something thick, so that it does not break: and let it not be absorbent.
And you should know that there are many instruments for teeth: and similarly the rest of the instruments are not counted, and a clever artisan invents an instrument for himself according to what the operation signifies to him and according to the ailments themselves.
Since there are ailments for which the ancients did not describe instruments, due to the diversity of their types.
If a bone from the jaw or from other bones of the mouth breaks, or if it becomes rotten: then carefully examine and work on it in its place with what is suitable from the instruments and forceps which I mentioned for extracting roots, and assist as I have described, whose form is this.
Let there be something thick gradually applied to draw it out, or to hold the bone with it, so that it does not retreat and go away until the bone comes out: and restore the place with medicines suitable for it.
If there is only a small amount of rot in the bone, then scrape it away from the decay, and treat it until it heals.
On cutting prominent teeth that protrude over others.
Chapter XXXII.
When teeth protrude not according to their natural course, it makes the appearance ugly because of this, especially when it happens to women and girls, namely those who are prostitutes.
For if a tooth is formed after another tooth and does not fit or it is not possible to file or polish it: then remove it. And if it is attached to another tooth, then cut it with this instrument, which has the following form.
It is like a small beak and is made of hard iron with a very sharp tip.
And the cutting should be done over several days when you cut it, and because of the hardness of the tooth, and so that another tooth is not dislodged.
But if it is prominent and in need of filing, then file it with an iron file, which has this form.
It should be entirely made of iron, and its handle should consist of small sharp points, like a file used to make needles. With this, the tooth should be filed gradually over several days easily, so that it is not dislodged and falls out: then smooth it, and at the end, shave it with some razors.
If a tooth is fractured in such a way that it hurts the tongue: then you must file it until the roughness of the fracture is removed, and it is evened out: and smoothed, so that it does not hurt the tongue or impair speech.
Regarding the repair of teeth with gold wire.
Chapter XXXIII.
When the front teeth are subjected to concussion or movement due to impact or accident, and the patient cannot bite on them without causing them to fall out, even after treatment with astringent medicines has been ineffective: then there is a method to secure them with gold wire: for silver turns green and corrodes over time, but gold never changes.
And let the thread be of medium fineness and thickness according to its quantity so that it may fit between the teeth.
The method of threading is such that you should take a thread and insert twice its length between two healthy teeth; then weave with both ends of the thread among the moving teeth, whether one or more, until you reach the other side with the needle and thread up to the next healthy tooth.
Then weave the thread back to the part where you began; and pull your hand with subtlety and wisdom until it is completely secure; and let your binding of the thread at the roots of the teeth be such that it does not come loose.
Then cut the excess thread ends with forceps; and bring them together and tuck them in as you work, so that they are hidden between a healthy tooth and a moving tooth, so as not to irritate the tongue: then let it remain tightly secured.
但如果松动或断裂，则用另一根线重新绑紧，它将这样长时间保持稳定。
And this is the form of the teeth and the figure of threading two healthy teeth and two moving teeth as you see.
And it sometimes happens that one tooth or two return to their proper places after an injury, and are retained as we have described, and remain so: and this is done only by a skilled and experienced artisan.
And sometimes a piece of bone from an ox is shaped to fit like a tooth, and it is placed in the socket where it supports the tooth and is secured, as we said: and it remains and serves for a long time.
Of cutting the ligament that occurs under the tongue, and prevents speech.
Chapter XXXIIII.
If there is something hard and knotted in it, and this is due to the healing of a wound: then hook into it with a hook, and cut it horizontally until you sever the ligament and release the knot.
If however bleeding occurs, then apply powdered zechar (a type of plant) to the wound. If the blood overpowers you, then cauterize the area with a speckled cautery, which is suitable for it: then treat it with the remaining methods of treatment until it heals. Of extracting a ranula which occurs under the tongue.
Chapter XXXV.
Sometimes an abscess occurs under the tongue that resembles a small frog, preventing the tongue from performing its natural functions: and it may grow so large as to fill the mouth.
If you see that it is dark in color or black, hard, and the patient has no feeling in it: then do not touch it, for it is cancer.
And if it tends towards a whitish color with moisture, then attach an hook to it and cut it with a sharp knife, and free it from all parts.
If blood overpowers you during the hour of your treatment, then apply ground zechar (a type of powder or paste) to it until the bleeding stops: then return to your treatment until you remove it completely.
Then wash it with vinegar and salt: and treat it with appropriate remedies until it is healed.
Concerning the treatment of an abscess in the two tonsils.
Chapter XXXVI.
Then either you will pierce it, or it will rupture on its own.
And if it is of a white color, round, and its root is slender, then it must be cut open.
And the procedure is such that you should consider before performing it whether the abscess has become quiet and fully warm at rest, or if there has been some reduction: then have the patient sit facing the sun, and place his head in your lap; open his mouth, and let the assistant take between his hands an instrument whose shape is as follows, and press the patient's tongue with it below. It should be made of silver or copper, and it should be thin like a small knife.
When you press with it on the tongue and the abscess becomes visible to you, and your vision falls upon it: then take a hook and insert it into the tonsil, and extract it as far outward as you can, except that you pull out some of the surrounding tissue with it.
Then cut it with an instrument whose shape follows as described.
It resembles scissors: however, its extremities should be curved, such that the opening of each is directly opposite the other at an angle; therefore, ensure it is made of polished iron or aluminum.
If this instrument is not available, then cut it with a scalpel, which has the following shape.
Let it be sharp on one side, not sharp on the other side.
And after you cut one almond-shaped area, cut the other following the same kind of incision.
Then after the incision, the patient should gargle with cold water, or with vinegar and water.
But if bleeding occurs, the patient should gargle with water in which bark of pimento trees has been boiled: or myrtle leaves, and similar astringents, until the flow of blood stops: then treat it until it heals.
And sometimes other abscesses arise in the throat besides the two tonsils.
Cut them accordingly as I said regarding the equal incision of the two tonsils.
And I indeed treated a woman who had an abscess that had arisen between her throat, which was causing darkening of the complexion, loss of senses, and almost closing off her throat: she was breathing through a narrow passage, and eating and drinking water were already prohibited for her: and she had reached a state where death would have ensued within one or two days if left untreated.
And the abscess had risen so much that it extended two branches until they emerged above the two nostrils.
I hurried quickly and fixed an uncinum (hook) in one of them.
Then I pulled it, and a large portion was extracted from it.
Then I cut it where it could be grasped through the nostril.
Then I did that for him which protruded from the nostril on the other side.
Then I opened his mouth and pressed his tongue. After that, I attached a hook to the abscess. Then I removed part of it, and only a little blood came out. The woman's throat was thus cleared, and she immediately began to drink water, then she started eating food.
So I did not stop cutting from that abscess many times over a long period: and the abscess would regrow in the place that I had cut, until it became too prolonged with it.
Therefore, I devised a way and cauterized the abscess between the throat.
She thus abstained from adding anything: then I walked away on one side, and did not know what God did with her after me.
Concerning the cutting of the throat abscess.
Chapter XXXVII.
When the catarrh descends to the throat and forms an abscess, and it is long, then it is called perpendicular. And if it is thick and round at the lower part, then it is called a uvula.
When it is treated as we said in the division, and the treatment does not help: and you see that the warm abscess has subsided but remains subtle: then you must cut it.
And if what is aggregated from it is a round mass, and does not have length, and is of a bloody or dark color, or black, and has no sensation: then you must avoid cutting it.
For in it there is fear upon the sick.
Therefore, when you see it as I described, white and of a certain length, make the patient sit facing the sun. Press his tongue with the instrument that was mentioned earlier, then attach the hook to the object and pull it down. Cut it with one of the two instruments that I mentioned for cutting the two tonsils.
And you should not cut from it except what has grown beyond its natural limit without any addition.
For if you cut from it more than necessary, you will harm the voice and speech.
Then after the cut, use what we have described for cutting the two tonsils: and take care of it until it heals.
But if the patient is afraid of the cut, then you should use your ingenuity in cauterizing it without fear and without causing alarm.
And the method of cauterization in this case is not to be done without sharp water: and you should place the patient's head in your arm.
Then press his tongue with the instrument that I mentioned.
Then take some of the water that I told you about in the chapter on cauterizing, and mix it with unextinguished coals, and place it not too thick nor too thin, and fill the concavity of this instrument, which has the following form.
Let the extremity of it where the medicine is placed be concave, like the concavity of a spoon.
And place the instrument with medicine upon the wound itself: and let the patient lie on his side so that saliva may run from his mouth due to the internal medicine, so that nothing from it descends into his throat and harms him.
Then hold your hand with the medicine.
And you should apply it to the wound for a quantity of half an hour, until you see it turn black and the pain be alleviated by the medicine.
And if you wish to take a cloth, and wrap it around the upper part of the arm, and pour medicine onto the cloth, and insert the arm with the cloth into a tube above, until the cloth adheres to the wound. Do this multiple times until you achieve what you desire from the cautery of the wound.
Then leave it; it will dry up and fall off after three days or four.
If you need to repeat the treatment with medicine, do so: and after the cautery, clean around the wound with a cloth soaked in butter, and purify what is around it with medicine: and wash it with cold water.
And treat it externally with applications and internally with gargles until it is healed.
This method of treatment is therefore healthier than cutting and is safer from fear of complications.
And sometimes the wound is treated even more gently than with cautery and cutting: it is treated with fumigation, in this manner.
Take a container, and add hyssop, origanum, rue, savory, chamomile, southernwood, and similar herbs; and gather all of them or some of them in a pot, and immerse them with vinegar, and let it boil: and the pot should be sealed with clay properly: and there should be an opening in the middle of the pot through which place a concave instrument in this manner.
Make it of silver or brass: and insert the end where the grenade is into the mouth of the sick person, until the vapor rises to the cloth on top of the tube, until the cloth becomes very dark.
Then do this repeatedly over it, until it dries.
And be careful not to perform this treatment at the beginning of the onset of an abscess.
For it usually adds to the abscess: and you should not do this unless the abscess is beginning to show signs of heat.
But if this instrument is not available to you, then take a tube and attach a piece of cork at its end so that it does not burn the mouth of the sick person: for the cork prevents the vapor from burning the mouth: and this is part of good treatment with safety.
¶ On the Extraction of Spines and Bones from the Throat.
Chapter XXXVIII.
Often, a fishbone or spine, or something else, adheres to the throat.
Therefore, you should remove what is apparent above and visible after pressing the tongue with an instrument near a light, so that what is in the throat becomes clear to you.
And what does not appear to you and is hidden in the throat, you must have the sick person vomit before the food is digested in the stomach.
Perhaps the object will come out attached through vomiting.
Or let the sick person swallow a piece of turnip, or the root of lettuce, or a morsel of dry bread; or take a small piece of dry sea sponge and tie it to a thread, then let him swallow it.
When it reaches the place where there are spines or bones, and it is extracted, then it comes out. If it does not come out with what we have said, then use an instrument made of lead in the following shape.
Let it be thicker than a radius for a little while, and at its end let there be a curvature, which he should insert into his throat with ease: and he should have his head raised up.
And be careful not to touch his epiglottis, so that he does not cough and push out with it the bone or spine, or let the physician insert it with his own hand.
But what the sick person inserts is better: because of his knowledge of the location of the attached object: and he should push it downward, or pull his hand with the instrument upward, all of this according to the quantity that is prepared for him, until it comes out.
Concerning the Extraction of a Leech.
Chapter XXXIX.
When the leech is treated with what I said in the division of treatment with medicines and it does not help, then examine the throat of the patient in the sunlight, or near the sun after you have pressed his tongue with the instrument that I told you about.
If therefore your sight falls upon a leech, remove it with a small hook or with fine forceps properly.
If it is not possible with them, then take a hollow tube and insert it into the throat of the patient up to near the throat: then insert a heated iron into the hollow of the tube with fire.
Do this multiple times: and let the patient abstain from water for the entire day.
Then let him take a vessel filled with cold water and open his mouth in it: and let him gargle with it and not swallow any of it: and stir the water one hour after another with his hand.
For when the leech feels the water, it falls immediately.
If, however, it does not come out as we have described, then fumigate the patient with chaff, or with wormwood with the instrument that I described for vulvar fumigation.
Do this multiple times, for it will fall.
And the method of operation in fumigation is to take a pot in which there are live coals with fire: and the pot should be covered with a cover, in the middle of which there is a hole: and arrange it so that the end of the instrument is positioned in that hole.
Then release the fumigation, and let the patient place his mouth at the end of the tube, and close his mouth so that the smoke does not escape until you know that the fumigation has reached the leech.
For the leech falls immediately.
And if it does not fall, then repeat the fumigation many times.
And if the patient can tolerate thirst, let them eat salted foods and garlic, and do not drink water. It is necessary therefore that he follow this regimen.
And this is the form of the instrument with which the leech is removed from the throat when it falls there.
It is like forceps, as you can see: except that it has this curvature which is inserted into the throat.
And its end is like the beak of a bird called a heron, in which there is the roughness of a file: when it grasps something, it does not let go at all.
Concerning the incision of Abscesses, and their division, and general treatment.
Chapter 40.
The types of abscesses are many and varied, as they come to mind, namely one kind at a time in this book: and they differ in their incision and division into two methods.
One type is from the nature of the abscess itself and what it contains of moisture.
And the second method is due to the locations where they occur in the body.
Because an abscess occurring in the head is different from one occurring in the anus: and an abscess occurring in a fleshy area is different from one occurring in joints: and each has its own judgment based on the procedure.
And there are abscesses which should not be pierced until after the pus within them has matured and reached completion; and among these are those that should be pierced while they are raw, without waiting for full maturity.
Just as abscesses that are near joints.
Because when an abscess occurs near a joint and remains there until the surrounding tissue putrefies, it may corrupt the ligaments or nerves of that joint, causing a closer reason for the contraction of that limb.
Or the abscess is near a principal limb; for if you delay piercing it until it matures, it will harm either the part itself or the principal limb through which it is connected.
Or if it is near the anus, pierce it even when it is immature. And you should not pierce an unripe abscess that has not completed its digestion, except for one that is near the anus to prevent it from putrefying deeply and extending into the interior of the anus, thereby causing a fistula or becoming chronic and unsanable. You should know the time for piercing an abscess that has matured according to its completion: this is when the pain subsides, the fever recedes, and there is a reduction in redness, pulsation, and acuteness at the head of the abscess, along with other signs. And you should make the same incision at the lower part of the abscess and at its highest prominence. The incision should follow the length of the body if the abscesses are in the parts of the hands and feet, and in areas such as the arms, tendons, nerves, arteries, and ultimately in all flat areas without reflexion.
In those that are reflected, proceed with the puncture according to that limb.
When an abscess is in fleshy areas, it is better to postpone its puncture until its digestion is confirmed, as we said according to the supplement.
For if you puncture it before that time, the course of the pus will be prolonged, and there will be much dirt and foulness, and its lips may become hardened, and its depth increased.
And some abscesses should be punctured according to the width of the body when necessary: or according to what the limb needs.
It is necessary to administer a small puncture for small abscesses, and a large puncture for large abscesses: or multiple incisions according to the size of the abscess.
There are abscesses in which it is necessary to hollow out the skin: and to incise when it has become like cloth, and has reached a point where it is already dead: as often happens with dubia and buboes.
And among them are those that are incised in a triangular shape.
And there is one from which an incision is made in the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Like the groin abscess.
And among them are those in which a circular incision and a crescent-shaped incision are administered: and similar ones from other types of incisions.
For those that do not have a head, such as soft superficial abscesses, it is necessary to puncture them with a superficial puncture, or simply a flat one.
And when an abscess is large and has already collected much pus, and you pierce it, do not hurry to extract all the pus at that time: rather, extract only part of it from it.
Then let the abscess be opened on another day.
Then extract some of the pus again.
Do this repeatedly in stages until the pus is completely expelled: especially if the patient is weak, or a pregnant woman, or a young child, or an old and frail person: for the vital spirit is often dissolved from the body with the expulsion of pus, and the patient may die as a result, and you might not understand why.
Therefore, be very careful with this chapter.
And after your puncture, with which you pierce abscesses, it is necessary to clean the wound: and pay attention.
If the wound of an abscess is small or the incision is shallow, then apply a dressing made of linen or old cloth.
And if the abscess is large and there are many openings from the puncture, then it is necessary to insert dressings into every opening until they reach each other.
And if you have removed a part of the skin in the abscess or hollowed it out around it: then it is necessary to fill it with old cloth, or as when a fabric is woven or linen is carded without moisture: and press it until the third day.
Then remove it, and treat it with what is necessary from ointment until it heals.
If blood flow occurs during your time of operation, then administer cold water and vinegar; after they are absorbed by a cloth, place the cloth on the site of bleeding multiple times.
If the bleeding persists, then it is necessary to administer treatment, care, and powders, which I have described in many places throughout this book, and according to the division.
If it is during winter and the site of the abscess is near many nerves, then you should pour warm powder mixed with wine and oil onto the affected areas.
And if it is during summer and the areas are fleshy, then you should place powders soaked in water and oil, or in wine and oil, and make sure that everything is cold.
On the third day, as we have said, it is necessary to open the abscess, clean it, and administer appropriate treatment for its care until it heals.
This is what is necessary to know universally about the treatment of abscesses.
According to the path of distinction, I have already spoken about every abscess, how the way to its cure is laid out chapter by chapter individually.
Concerning the incision of abscesses that occur in the skin of the head.
Chapter XLII.
Small abscesses occur in the skin of the head and they are of the types of nodules, which are contained within membranes that act as sacs, much like they are the pouches of a hen.
And their kinds are many.
Of these, some are fatty; and of these, there are those that contain a moisture similar to mud; and of these, there are those that contain a moisture similar to that in boiled cereals and porridges; and among them are those that are hard like stone.
And in the cutting of all of them and in their removal there is no fear, as long as the artery does not cause opposition during their cutting.
And the procedure in cutting them is to try them with an instrument whose form comes next, which is called "Intromissum," until you know what it contains.
For if it is that which contains moisture, then dry it by cutting along its length with a superficial cut, in this manner.
And begin the cut from line b to line g. When the moisture is evacuated, then peel off the cyst that contains this moisture, and do not leave anything inside.
For it often returns if anything remains from it. Then immerse cotton in Egyptian ointment if it is available; and if not, in salt water. Fill the wound with it and leave it until another day.
For it will dissolve what remains of the cyst. Then repeat the process with cotton and Egyptian ointment secondly, thirdly, and as many times as needed until you are confident that nothing remains of the cyst. Then treat the wound with ointment until it heals.
If an abscess contains a soft knot, then cut it according to this shape, the cut having the form of a cross: and insert hooks between the two lips of the section, and excise it from all sides: and try your strength in extracting the membrane that contains it.
If an artery causes difficulty for you, then do what I will tell you next.
And do the same for an abscess that is hard, from the cutting and curing in the same way, as we have said. And the cutting over a hard abscess is easier: because it contains little blood and moisture.
And sometimes there are some of these abscesses that occur in the head in certain individuals, in which there is no moisture at all.
Or make the puncture always from the lower part of them, so that the flow of pus is directed downward.
Then treat them with what is appropriate for them from the methods of treatment.
Concerning the cutting of strophulas on the neck.
Chapter XLII.
These abscesses frequently occur in the neck, under the armpits, and in the groin: and sometimes they occur in other parts of the body.
And concerning those that occur in the neck among them, there is one type and many types: and they generate each other: and every Stricture among them is within its own membrane, as it is in nodes and abscesses of the head, as we have described.
And there are many types of these Strictures.
And among them are those that are stony: and there are those that contain moisture: and there are harmful ones that do not respond to treatment.
For the one among them that you see to be of good disposition upon touch, whose color is close to that of the skin and moves freely in all directions, and which is not attached to the neck's nerves or tendons, nor arteries, nor deep: it should be cut superficially from the upper part to the lower part of the body along a line from b to g, and scrape it away entirely: and stretch the two edges of the skin with hooks, or multiple hooks if needed, as we mentioned for abscesses of the head, and extract it gradually.
And it is important to be cautious not to cut a vein or nerve.
And let the blade not be very sharp: so that it does not slip from your hand during cutting or disturb the patient, and cut what is not necessary.
However, if you cut a vein or artery, or if it prevents you from performing the operation, then apply crushed seeds or certain powders that stop bleeding to the wound, and bandage it, and leave it alone until the sharpness of the abscess subsides and the wound softens: or until it begins to show signs of putrefaction.
For the vein is severed; Return then to your work, until you complete it.
Then take care of it.
If the strophula is entirely cut out, then you must bring together the two lips of the wound: and close it immediately once you see that there is no remaining excess.
If however you see that there is remaining excess due to the size of the strophula, then you must proceed to cut and extract its root: and apply the suture as we have described.
And for those strophuli that contain moisture, pierce them with a shallow incision: so that the site of its maturity may appear to you: and place the incision from where it follows below the body, as we have said.
Then apply licinia with ointment and similar substances after the perforation, to corrode what remains from the corruption, until you see that the wound is now clean: then care for it with flesh-generating ointment, until it heals.
Concerning the incision of the Epiglottis in the event of an abscess within the throat.
Chapter XLIII.
The ancients said that this procedure should be performed on the Epiglottis, and I have not seen anyone in our land who has done it: and this is the text of their speech.
However, in cases of hydrothorax, the procedure on the Epiglottis must be avoided, as it does not provide help through that method: because all veins and the lung are weakened.
In those who have a hot abscess in the mouth, throat, or both tonsils, when there is no illness in the windpipe, the procedure on the Epiglottis should be used to avoid the danger of death that results from suffocation. Therefore, when we wish to perform it, we should cut the Epiglottis below three circles of the Epiglottis or four, with a small incision horizontally, in the part that is between two circles, by the amount that the incision is made in soft tissue, not in cartilage: and this place is suitable for the incision, since it is away from muscle, and blood vessels are far from it.
If the surgeon is timid, then he should stretch the skin of the throat with a hook.
Then he should cut the skin until he reaches the windpipe: he should avoid blood vessels if he sees any of them.
Then he should cut the soft tissue as we have described: and it is indicated above that through this incision comes phlegm that exits from it when it breaks, and by the interruption of voice.
And leave the wound open for some time.
When therefore the time is past in which suffocation is feared, bring together the two lips of the wound of the skin, and sew them up alone without the cartilage.
Then administer medicines that promote flesh growth until it is healed.
Albucasis says.
The summary of the discussion we have narrated has no explanation unless they see that one of these abscesses has already obstructed the patient's throat: and the patient is elevated to a condition near death, and they wish to relieve his breathing: they go to cut the Epiglottis so that the patient can breathe at the wound site with some respiration, and be saved from death: and for this reason they have ordered to leave the wound open until the malice of the illness is consumed, and its duration is about three days, and almost exactly such: then they order to sew up the wound and treat it until it heals.
And what I saw for myself is that a servant girl took a knife and sent it into her throat, and with it cut part of the windpipe.
And I was called to treat her, and found her moaning as one who is dead might moan.
I examined the wound and found a small amount of blood that had come out from it.
I concluded that she had not cut an artery or the windpipe, and air was coming out of the wound.
I acted quickly, sewed up the wound, and treated it until it healed: and nothing serious happened to the servant girl except hoarseness in her voice: and she returned to her usual condition after a few days.
Therefore, I say that there is no fear in the section of the Epiglottis.
Concerning the Section of a Hernia of the Throat.
Chapter XLIV.
This swelling is called a hernia of the throat, it is a large swelling, according to the color of the body: and it occurs frequently in women.
And it occurs in two ways: either naturally, or accidentally. In the natural case, there is no need for intervention.
The accidental case occurs in two ways: one of which is similar to fatty tumors.
And the second way is similar to a swelling that occurs due to constriction of an artery.
And there is fear in this condition, and one should not attempt to treat it with a knife unless it is small: and you should examine it carefully using an instrument.
If you find it similar to a fatty tumor and it is not connected to any veins, then cut it out as tumors are cut: and remove it along with what contains it from the sac, if it is in a sac: and if not, then thoroughly examine all of it.
Then treat the area as necessary for healing until it is healed.
Concerning the Section on Types of Nodes.
Chapter XLV. There are many types of nodes, and I have already described all their kinds in the division: and it is necessary for me to describe here the difference between a Node and an Exiture, as there is some ambiguity. I say then that when External Heat is inflammation, and fever, and severe pains, until the boiling over of excess is calmed, and completion of putrefaction occurs: for then the fever and heat subside.
When it comes to a Knot, there is neither heat nor fever nor pain, and they contain them in kistis sifachin, which is their own sack, and it matches the color of the body: and its beginning is like a chickpea, and it becomes like batecha, larger and smaller.
And they are of two kinds: either fatty, or retaining moisture.
And the colors of the moisture are many, as I said in the division. Therefore, when you come to the treatment of a Knot, you must examine it and search for it first with an instrument called Intromissum, as its form will appear in the chapter that follows this one.
The method of examining abscesses and all Knots is to take this instrument and insert it into a moister place that you find in the abscess: and you should move your fingers with it gradually until you know that the instrument has now penetrated the skin.
Then extend your last hand according to the measure of the size of the abscess.
Then remove the Intromissum and examine what comes out with it.
If moisture comes out flowing, whatever the color may be: then dry it with superficial incision, as I said regarding other abscesses.
And if the moisture does not come out in the trace of the insertion, then you know that it is fatty: therefore dry it with a cross-shaped section as shown here, as I have taught you: and suspend it with hooks, and strip the skin from all sides easily: and keep a box ready if possible, to extract it whole with the knot.
But if the cyst bursts during the operation and it is not possible to extract it whole, for this often happens, then remove it piece by piece until nothing of it remains.
For if even a small or large part remains, the knot will return according to the majority of cases.
If it overcomes you and a small part remains, then at the completion of your treatment, fill the wound with certain corrosive sharp powders: and cauterize the wound, and place something warm that sits atop an abscess above it, and treat it with the remaining methods until it heals.
If the knot is large, then sew together its two lips, and treat it with what causes flesh to grow. But if there is a contrary pulsating vein or non-pulsating vein, then hurry and fill the place with powdered oak bark, and leave it tightly wrapped for two days, or three, until the wound putrefies and the blood stops boiling: then return to cutting away what remains of the knot.
¶ Regarding the outer instruments for cutting and piercing.
Chapter XLVI.
These are the forms of probes, and they are of three kinds.
For among them is that which is great, and among them is that which is medium, and among them is that which is small.
Let them make from iron small squares with pointed ends so that they may quickly enter the abscess.
And these are the forms of instruments, that is, those which pierce: and one of them is called beris, that is, piercing: and they are of three kinds.
For among them is that which is great, and that which is medium, and that which is small.
They come together so that they may be investigated through them the abscesses, exits, fistulas, and buboes from what is between them of bones.
And others are made round, smooth, and gentle, like large needles, to which bases are attached, of lemon wood, or brass, or iron, or silver. And the best of them are those which are made from lemon wood.
And there are instruments made of black lead which come together so that they may be used to examine fistulas, whose concavity has reflections, so that they can be gently reflected with those concavities.
And they are again of three kinds. For among them are long ones, among them medium ones, and among them short ones, according to the quantity of width of the fistula and its constriction. The shape of hooks, and they are of many kinds. For among them are simple ones, that is, those which have one curve: and they are of three kinds as you see, Great, Medium, and Small.
And there are five blind hooks: and they are of three kinds.
And there are hooks having two curves, and they are of three kinds: and there are hooks having three curves, and they are of three kinds: and all these are necessary in their place.
And these are the forms of knives with which nodes and abscesses are cut and scraped: and they are of three kinds: for there is a large one, a medium one, and a small one.
Their sharp ends with which the cutting is done are acute, other ends are not acute: and they are not used in this way unless to provide assistance in scraping nodes when there is fear of cutting a vein or nerve: and to heal the patient through them and allow temporary tranquility from the burning sensation found during the scraping of an abscess.
These are forceps, and they are of three kinds.
They are made of copper, and they resemble a ladle used to stir alcohol: and at the broad end there is hidden a point of fine iron: and it runs to the interior and to the exterior when you wish, as you see.
The form of the fine needles which are hidden between the fingers during the puncturing of abscesses: and the patient does not feel them: and they are of three kinds, large, medium, and small.
The forms of suction instruments with which the flow of blood is stopped: and they are of three kinds, large, medium, and small.
They are made of copper or citron wood, round, to a certain length, as you see: and they should be fine.
And it is necessary that these types of leeches be both large and small among you, so that you may quickly remove blood when needed, and then when medicine is not present.
However, do not use them to cut the blood from every part of the body, and use them only on fleshy areas: such as the thighs, hips, arms, breasts, abdomen, groin, and similar fleshy, moist areas.
And sometimes they are made into small instruments similar to the rinds of figs according to their shape: with which blood is cut when it flows from a phlebotomy site, or at an incision of a vein or artery; and sometimes they are made round according to this form.
§ On the treatment of human mammary glands that resemble women's breasts.
Chapter XLVII.
At times, the breasts of some men become swollen at the onset of nocturnal pollution until they resemble women's breasts, and they remain unpleasantly abscessed.
Whoever wishes to treat this should make an incision in a crescent shape over the breasts, following this form from line b to line g. Then remove all the fat tissue.
Afterwards, fill the wound with a flesh-restoring medicine.
Then bring together the two lips of the wound with stitches, and care for it until it heals.
If the breast sags downward and softens due to its size, as happens with women: then it is necessary to make two incisions on each of its upper sides in a shape similar to that of a crescent, each connected at their ends so that one line contains the other, following this form from line b to line g. Afterwards, remove the skin between the two lips, take away the fat, and apply what we mentioned about stitches and powders as is necessary for the healing process until it is healed.
If you do not complete the incision that you ought to make because of the patient's restlessness or due to blood flow: then you should fill the wound with lint soaked in a corrosive ointment and leave it, until what remains of the fatty tissue is corroded.
Then care for it until it is healed.
¶ On the Piercing of an Abscess that Occurs under the Scrotum.
Chapter XLVIII. These abscesses that occur under the scrotum are of the varieties of hard Strophulus, which contains pouches, and among them are those that contain moisture.
Those that contain moisture should be cut with a lunar incision according to this shape, from line b to line g. Once everything inside the abscess that is pus has been evacuated, then fill it with old lint and leave it until another day.
Then remove the lint and treat it with an appropriate ointment until it is healed.
If the abscess is of the variety of knotted Strophulus, then cut into it as we said regarding an even incision above the Strophulus.
If the wound extends so that it discharges pus, then apply a cautery to it as we said in what was mentioned before.
¶ On the Incision of an Abscess that Occurs Due to an Artery and Vein.
Chapter XLIX.
When an artery is ruptured and the skin above it becomes consolidated, gangrene often results; and similarly with veins, as gangrene and swelling may occur.
The signs by which it is known that gangrene and swelling are due to an artery or a vein are as follows: when the gangrene is due to an artery, it is long and aggregated deep within the body; and when you press on the gangrene with your fingers, you feel a kind of hissing sound.
And that which is due to a vein is round and on the surface of the body.
And surgery on such gangrene is an error, especially when it is under the armpits, in the groin, on the neck, and in many places on the body; it is a very great mistake.
Therefore, treatment of it with a knife should be avoided, and this applies even to cases where it is located in the extremities or on the head; such treatment should also be avoided.
Therefore, for that which comes from the swelling of the artery opening, make an incision in the skin along its length.
Then open the incision with hooks, and then expose the artery: free it from its sheaths until it is fully exposed.
Then insert a needle under it and make it penetrate to the other side, and tie off the artery with double thread at two places, as I have taught you in extracting two arteries that are in the temples.
Then puncture the area between the two ligatures with a spatula until all the blood that is there is expelled and the gangrene dissolves.
Then administer treatment that generates pus until the tissues fall off; afterwards treat it with ointments suitable for it until it heals.
If it is an abscess due to the cutting of a vein, then you must hold with your hand as much as possible of the abscess with the skin.
Then insert a needle under the place which you held with your hand, and make it penetrate: and attach a double thread to it, until you extract it from the other side.
Then tie the abscess with a good ligature: as I told you about tying a grape stem, from both sides with the two ends of the thread. If you fear that the thread will be extracted, then insert another needle with a different thread under the abscess near the needle incision: press it, and secure your threads in four places.
Then dry the abscess in the middle of it until what is inside comes out; then cut away the excess skin and leave what has been tied from it.
Then apply a piece of lint that you have soaked in wine and oil.
Then administer treatment with lint and ointments until it heals.
Concerning an abscess that occurs due to the twisting of nerves.
Chapter 50.
Just as an abscess can occur in an artery or vein, so too can an abscess occur in nerves: it happens due to a blow or from excessive labor and similar causes; it most frequently occurs in places of assistance, such as the heel, and in any place where joints move; and this abscess is severe. Its color resembles the rest of the body, and it is usually found in various conditions without pain: and when it is compressed with force, the patient feels something like a state of numbness in it.
And it is not a swelling aggregated deep within the body, but rather it lies beneath the skin and moves to every part, neither going forward nor backward.
Therefore, what is found among the joints should not be treated with iron.
Perhaps a contraction may occur.
In the case of what is found in the head or on the forehead, make an incision in the skin with a spatula.
If it is a small swelling, then hold it with forceps and cut it from the root.
And if it is large, then suspend it with a hook and scrape it; then remove it and close the wound with stitches: and treat it until it heals.
Concerning the incision of a swelling that occurs in the abdomen.
Chapter LI. Occasionally, certain people develop growths in their abdomens and other parts of their bodies, which are called Fungalia, named by analogy with mushrooms.
Their root is delicate, and their head is large, and their lips are inverted.
Some of them are small, and some become very large.
I have indeed seen a man who had two growths in his abdomen that were more similar to mushrooms than to other things: there was no difference between them, they were white, had fine roots, their lips were inverted, and they constantly produced moisture.
I therefore cut them open and found one weighing about ten and eight ounces and the other about six ounces. The operation in cutting these is such that you should then consider whether the patient is humid, and if the color of the pus is white and the fluid is humid and thin-rooted: then cut it open with a broad scalpel, and have cautery irons ready over the fire.
For often much blood is expelled during its cutting: so hurry if you are overwhelmed by blood, then cauterize it.
If you see the patient frightened and timid at the incision with iron, then take a lead thread properly made, and tie up the pus with it: its method is as we have said, and let it remain for two days.
Then add to the constriction of lead.
Do not therefore cease to tighten the lead whenever it presses on the pus, until it is separated and falls by itself without effort.
If however the pus has a thick root, then there is something to fear and be wary of when cutting it, especially if it is in the abdomen.
Nevertheless, it is possible to cut through half of it.
Then cauterize it so that it does not return.
Then care for it until the wound heals.
And be careful not to presume to cut pus that is of a dark color, with little sensation and an unpleasant appearance: for it is a cancerous abscess. And I will discuss cancer later in this treatise.
Of the Treatment of an Eminent Umbilicus.
Chapter LII.
An eminent umbilicus occurs for many reasons.
Or it arises from fissures above the navel: and either pus or intestine comes out of it, depending on what happens in other similar ruptures.
Or it arises from blood that flows from a vein or an artery, as previously mentioned.
Or it arises from compressed gas within it.
If it is due to a pus-filled fissure and the discharge of pus: then the color of the swelling is similar to the color of the body: it is mild, without pain: and its appearance varies.
And if it is due to the protrusion of an intestine, then its appearance will be much more varied as we have described.
When you press it with your fingers, it retreats: then it returns, and perhaps a sound is heard: and it greatly enlarges at the entrance of a bath or during severe effort.
If it is due to moisture, it is mild, then when you press it with your hand, it does not retreat, nor does constriction or addition occur.
If it is due to blood, then the swelling appears with these signs turning towards blackness or bruising.
If it is due to newly grown flesh, then the swelling is severe, large, hard, and fixed in one quantity.
If it is due to flatulence, then its touch is soft. And the procedure there is to consider then whether the protrusion of the navel is due to arterial blood, venous blood, or flatulence; then you must refrain from treating it.
For there is fear and caution in that case, as I taught you in the chapter where I discussed abscesses due to arteries and veins.
If the protrusion of the navel is due to the intestine or the colon, then you must instruct the patient to hold his breath and stand with his body extended.
Then mark around the entire circumference of the navel with cerese wax.
Then instruct him to lie supine between your hands on his back.
Then encircle with a slender band around the navel above the place you marked with cerese wax.
Then extend the middle of the abscess towards the upper part with a large hook.
Then tie it tightly around the circumference with thread or with a strong silk cord; and let the knot of the ligature be secure.
Then open the middle of the abscess that has been extended above the ligature.
If you find it already caught by the ligature: then remove the ligature and insert your index finger into it, and push the intestine towards the interior of the abdomen: and if you find the colon, then take it with a hook and cut away its excess.
If, however, a vessel opposite to you is an artery or vein, then tie it up tightly.
Then return to your task.
And take two needles, and insert into them two strong threads: and insert the two needles into the ligature you have made around the abscess in a cross shape, which you make to penetrate.
Then tie the abscess in four places above the needles: and if you wish, remove the needles and leave the area open until the extended flesh rots and falls off by itself: or cut it when it has become thin and rotten.
Then treat it with what is necessary from ointments until it heals.
If the protrusion of the navel is from flesh or moisture, then it is necessary to hollow out the abscess as we have said.
And remove the blood or moisture that you find there.
Then treat it with what consolidates the area.
### On the Treatment of Cancer. Chapter LIII.
For I was not able to heal anyone from it; nor have I seen anyone before me who has succeeded in dealing with it.
And the procedure when it is located as we said is to precede and release the patient from black cholera several times.
Then if you find the phlebota itself with obvious congestion, proceed to bleed it.
Then prepare the patient with a preparation in which he will be placed for the procedure.
Then apply hooks that are suitable for the tumor.
Then hollow out the tumor from all sides with the skin, according to the examination, until nothing remains of its roots: and let the blood flow, and do not cut it off quickly, but press the areas and wipe away all the thick blood with your hand or with whatever is possible among the instruments.
但如果动脉或静脉切开后流出的血液过于浓稠，阻碍了手术进行：那么你应该烧灼血管，直到止血。
Then treat it with the remaining treatment until it heals.
¶ On the Treatment of Dropsy.
Chapter LIIII.
We have now described the types of dropsy and how water accumulates, as well as the signs of each type and its treatment with medicines.
And that which is treated with iron is only the type of scirrhous: and it does not approach the type of tympanites with iron: nor of the deep-seated hyposarca; for that is fatal.
When you have already treated this type of hydrops tympanites with medicines and your treatment has not been effective, then consider the following.
For if the patient has already become weakened, or is suffering from another illness in addition to hydrops: such as if there is also coughing or diarrhea, and similar conditions: then be cautious not to treat them with iron: for there is danger in doing so.
But if you see that the patient is of robust strength, and there is no other illness besides hydrops alone: and he is neither a child nor an elderly person: then the method of treatment should be such that you lift the patient standing between your hands, and have an assistant behind him press his belly with their hand to expel the water toward the lower part of the ribcage.
Then take the spinal needle, in this form.
Let it be of two pointed parts, long, with sharp ends like a needle.
However, it should gradually become shorter so that you do not penetrate too far during the procedure and injure the intestine.
Then consider carefully.
For if the cause of hydrops is from the intestines, then you should extend the incision by a length of three fingers from the navel, directed downward above the pubic bone.
If generation of hydrops (edema) is due to liver disease: then your incision should be three fingers to the left from the navel.
And if its generation is due to the spleen, then the incision should be on the right side: and it should not be made on the side on which the patient wishes to lie, so that the excess fluids do not flow to a weakened part.
Then pierce with the instrument the entire skin.
Then insert into that incision and raise your hand with the spatula under the skin, and scrape as if you were removing it: and let the amount scraped be the quantity of a nail, or thereabouts.
Then scrape with the spatula until it reaches an empty space: and this is the place of the water.
Then remove it, and insert into the incision an instrument, which has this form.
And it is like a tube: it is made of silver, or copper, or bronze, smooth and polished: at the lower part of it there is a small hole, and on its sides are three holes, two on one side, and one on the other side: and its end is cut in the manner of the tip of a reed, as you see: at the upper end there is a ring.
For when the instrument reaches the water, it immediately flows over the instrument, so evacuate a medium quantity of water at that time.
For if you evacuate more than is necessary, the patient may die suddenly due to a loss of vital spirit, or suffer syncope which approaches death.
Indeed, empty it according to its strength, and according to what the patient's condition signifies to you from the quality of his pulse, and from its goodness.
Then remove the instrument, and retain the water.
Which is to say, it should be retained immediately because of the skin which holds the opening that is above the cheekbone: about which I have spoken, so that you may pierce it according to that method.
Then insert the instrument on the second day, if you see that the patient can tolerate it: and also extract a small amount from the water. Do this for several days without fear, and guard yourself from error: until there remains only a little of the water.
But if you fear for the patient and remove a large amount from the water: then treat him with dry heat burial in warm sand, and much sweating in a bath and sun, and let him endure thirst: and treat him with drying medicines until he is healed: and cauterize above the stomach, liver, and spleen after removing the water: as I have narrated in what precedes.
¶ On the treatment of infants who are born with their urinary passages not perforated.
Chapter 55. When a newborn emerges from the womb of its mother and the opening of its urinary passage is not perforated, or is narrow, or is in an improper place.
Therefore, it is necessary to assist with the perforation of its urinary passage immediately upon birth using a very fine probe, following this method.
Then place a fine key made of lead into the hole and bind it there: and hold it there for three days, or four.
When he wants to urinate, it should be removed, and he should urinate.
Then replace it.
And if you do not place the lead, it is possible that the urine flowing over the area will not allow it to close.
He whose hole is narrow is treated with lead, as we said, for many days, until it enlarges.
Those in whom the hole is not in its proper place are injured.
This is because in those who are born, the hole is at the end of the shaft near the back: therefore, they cannot urinate forward until they lift the shaft with their hand upward. Nor is there generation for him because sperm cannot reach the uterus in a straight line: and it is a very foul illness.
And the method of operation in that case is for the patient to lie supine on his back.
Then extend the head of his shaft with your left hand forcefully, and cut off the head of the shaft from the location of the penis with a sharp point or a small knife, as you would cut reed stems or radish roots, so that its middle becomes like the head of the shaft: and so that the hole falls in the middle as it should.
And be careful of blood flow during your operation.
For it often happens that.
So oppose him with the argument about cutting off blood, and treat the wound until it heals.
Concerning diseases that occur in the foreskin and head of the penis, and regarding corruption, blackening, and adherence.
Chapter LVI.
These albather conditions often occur in the penis, and it is a prominence of foul flesh.
And some of them are malignant, and others are not malignant.
Therefore, you should not suspend and cut it with a fine hook until you cleanse it entirely if it is not malignant.
Then apply a piece of cloth soaked in Egyptian ointment to it. Then treat it afterward with diaphinicon ointment until it heals.
If the albather is malignant and of foul color, then it is necessary to apply a cautery after cutting it and treating it accordingly.
但如果包皮未割的俘虏的包皮中，阿尔巴特的部分在里面，而部分在外面：那么你应该首先去除内部的阿尔巴特，直到它开始愈合，然后再治疗外部的部分；因为当你同时治疗内外时，包皮可能会受到损害。
And blackening and corruption can also occur in the testicles and foreskin.
Therefore, you should hollow out everything that is already blackened and that tends to become corrupted or is already corrupted.
Then place a bandage over it after applying honey that has been mixed with ground wheat flour and crushed gillyflower bark.
Then treat it with the remaining care until it is healed.
If, however, bleeding occurs, then apply a cautery using a lunar cauterizing method, as follows.
For the cautery is beneficial for two conditions at once, namely bleeding and when the wound becomes corrupted.
If the head of the tube is eroded and the entire thing is destroyed within an hour: then it is necessary to insert a lead tube into the urethra so that the patient can urinate through it.
In the case of adhesion between the foreskin and the head of the penis, and this adhesion does not occur except in a person whose foreskin is healthy and who has not undergone circumcision: and sometimes it happens due to a wound or abscess: therefore, you must remove it with a blunt spatula until the ligament breaks and the head of the penis is freed from all parts.
If it is difficult to distinguish and remove them precisely, then you must remove some part from the head of the penis and from the foreskin.
This is because when the foreskin is thin, it may be punctured quickly due to its thinness.
Then separate the foreskin from the head of the penis with a thin linen cloth that has already been soaked in cold water to prevent them from adhering again.
Then it should be treated with astringent wine until it is healed and firm. On the cleaning of infants and the treatment of injuries accidentally inflicted upon them.
Chapter LVIΙ.
Circumcision is not the separation of a continuity, like other wounds; however, since it is performed by our action and at our will, and its use is specifically for children, it is necessary to mark in it a better operation and a gentler path leading to healing.
I say therefore, that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books; for they do not use it in their laws, and we know it only through experience.
This is because I have found that a larger part of craftsmen and phlebotomists use cleansing by circumcising with a razor and scissors, and they use astringents, ligature with thread, and incision with a nail.
And indeed, I have already tested all these methods and did not find a better cleansing method than using scissors and ligature with thread.
Because in the cleansing with a razor, the skin often tears.
Because the foreskin has two layers of skin: therefore, it may happen that only the upper layer is cut, while the lower layer remains intact. This forces a second incision and causes future pain.
And with the cleansing method using alum, which is used by tailors, the cutting of the extremity of the male member is not secure; because it may enter its opening.
In cleansing, however, with a probe, the iron may slip out and spoil your work. And the skin of a boy is short in nature, and often they are born such that they do not need cleansing. And I have already seen this happen.
In cleansing with forceps and a ligature with thread, a good method was revealed to me: because the forceps are proportionate to the incision; therefore, what is sharp above is like what is sharp below.
When you press your hand, the two sharp points align and fall into place according to one procedure at the same time: and a compression of similar shape occurs, containing the skin of the rod from all sides, with no mistake whatsoever.
And the method of the proper procedure is that you make the boy, especially if he understands a little, believe that you do nothing but tie thread to his own rod and leave him until another day.
Then make him rejoice and be glad in every way that is possible for you, because of what he understands.
Then insert your hand onto his rod, blow on the skin, and pull it up until the head of the rod comes out.
Then cleanse it from the dirt that has accumulated on it.
Then tie the marked place with double thread.
Then tie below that a small piece of bandage for a little while. Then hold with your index finger and thumb the place of the lower bandage properly, and cut between the two ligaments.
Then quickly raise the skin upwards, and extract the head of the rod.
Then let the blood flow gradually (for it is better), and apply powder on top: and above the powder place a cloth in which egg yolks boiled in rose water have been mixed with rose oil. Apply fresh dressing to it: and let it remain on until another day: and care for it with the remaining treatment until it is healed.
The shape of the forceps for cleaning is as follows.
The two ends should be blunt and should meet: so that the claw does not come out of them: and the length between the two points should equal the length of two handles equally.
However, an error occurring during cleaning is that the inner skin might entirely escape or a part of it may come out at the incision. Therefore, it is necessary to stretch it out with your fingernail at your convenience before the area becomes abscessed: and cut it according to its equality.
If you cannot hold it with your fingernail, then pull it out with a hook, and cut it.
但如果超过三天，且杆下的部分仍然肿胀并形成脓肿，那么让它继续发展，直到脓肿变热：然后轻松地剥除它，并按照准备的情况进行切割：并且要小心杆的头部。
For it will not harm him.
Therefore, treat it with what consolidates the wound from powders, which we have mentioned in the chapter about powders: and if it extends beyond the skin above the measure, and reaches the upper parts, it will not harm him either.
Therefore, treat it with what we have mentioned until it is healed.
Concerning the extraction of retained urine in the bladder.
Chapter L VIII.
Retention of urine in the bladder occurs due to an obstruction caused by a stone, or frozen blood, or pus, or flesh grown, and similar things from what we have mentioned among the methods of treatment in the division.
And if the urine is not expelled and you see that its retention is due to a stone that is already in the neck of the bladder: then it is necessary for the patient to be bent with his knees raised.
Then place his feet on his back, and have him stretch out his abdomen from the upper part of his back, and let the patient strain his breath as much as possible.
Therefore, with the neck of the bladder pressing against the stone for its expulsion towards the rear: thus, the urine is relieved.
If it is not resolved as we have said and the condition is severe for the patient: then it is necessary to administer its extraction with a tool called a siringa, whose form is as follows: It should be made of silver, and be fine, smooth, and concave like the tube of a bird's feather in fineness, about the length of one and a half palms: it should have a fine tube at its head.
And the method of discharging pus is as follows: take doubled thread and tie wool or cotton at one end with a good knot; then insert the free end of the thread into the lower part of the syringe; if there is excess material from the wool, cut it back with scissors, but insert it firmly into the tube just as you would draw.
Then anoint the syringe with oil or butter and egg white; and have the patient sit on a chair, and apply pressure to the bladder, and lubricate his member with moist oils and olive oil and warm water.
Then insert the syringe into the member with ease until it reaches the base of the penis.
Then double it above from the part of the navel. Then push the syringe inside until it reaches the bladder, and let the patient feel that it has reached an empty space; and this is not done according to this order unless because the passage through which it goes is one of twists and turns.
Then gradually extend the thread with wool.
For the pus will follow the wool.
Then remove it and allow the pus to flow along the urine pathway: and insert the syringe again, and do not cease doing this until the bladder is emptied, and the patient finds relief. ¶ On the nature of bladder irrigation with a clepsydra.
Chapter LIX.
For it is sealed, that is, closed.
And it has three openings, two on one side, and one on the other side, as you can see.
And the concave place where there is what pushes should be of a size that fits it without addition, so that when something is drawn with it, moisture is attracted: and when it is pushed, it expels it to a distance: as a clepsydra does when it projects naphtha, that is, Greek fire in battles.
When you wish to project moisture into the bladder, insert the end of the clepsydra into the moisture, and draw with it what is pushing towards the upper part; for the moisture will be drawn into the concavity of the clepsydra. Then insert its extremity into the rod, as we have described for the syringe.
Then push the moisture with what pushes it; for that moisture reaches the bladder immediately, so that the patient feels it. The form of a fine enema by which the bladder is cleansed.
然后将一根坚固的线穿过这些孔，就像它们旋转一样。 然后将圈连接起来，就像alsofratu一样连接：在你把它放在你想用的液体、油和水中之后。
Then tie it to the instrument: and do with it as you did with the bladder by squeezing with your hand until moisture reaches the bladder.
§ On the Extraction of Stones.
Chapter 60. I have already discussed in the division the types of stones and their treatment with medicines, and I have explained the difference between stones generated in the kidneys and those in the bladder, as well as the signs of all of them. I have also described the stone on which the operation is performed by hand and its sectioning: it is a stone properly formed in the bladder, and one that adheres to the penis: and I am narrating this with clear exposition and abbreviation.
I say therefore, that stones generated in the bladder most often occur in children.
And from the signs of this condition, it is evident that urine exits from the bladder similar to water in its fineness: and sand appears in it, which is white; and the patient rubs his penis, and struggles with it, and often hangs (from it). Then the anus protrudes along with it in many cases.
And the treatment is easier for children from the time they first experience it until they reach fourteen years of age.
And it is difficult in elderly individuals.
In young adults, it is of intermediate difficulty between the two extremes: and the treatment is easier for one whose stone is larger, whereas if it is small, the treatment is more difficult for that case.
When we come to the treatment, it is necessary first to clean the patient with enemas to remove all feces from their intestines: for this sometimes prevents the discovery of the stone during examination. Then let the patient stand on his feet and be shaken and moved downward so that the stone may fall to the bottom of the bladder or jump from a high place several times.
Then have him sit between your hands which are prepared, and place your hands under his thighs so that the bladder is entirely tilted downward.
Then examine him and touch him externally.
If you feel the stone in the space, then proceed immediately with the incision on him.
If it does not fall entirely within your touch, then you must wipe your left index finger with oil if the patient is a boy: or the middle finger if he is a full youth: and insert it into his anus and examine for the stone until it stands under your finger: and gradually turn it toward the neck of the bladder.
Then press upon it with your finger and push it outward towards the place where you intend to make the incision: and instruct one attendant to press the bladder with his hand: and another attendant to lift the testicles with his right hand upward: and with his other hand, to remove the skin that is under the testicles on the side of the place intended for the incision.
Then insert the incising probe, which has this shape.
And locate it between the anus and the testicles, not in the middle but to the left side: and let the incision be made over the stone, with your finger in the anus: and make a transverse incision so that the external part is wide and the internal part narrow, according to the size necessary for the passage of the stone out of it without being too large.
Perhaps the finger, which is in the anus at the time of the incision, is pressed upon by the knife and comes out without difficulty.
And you should know that it is difficult for the stone, which has corners and edges, to come out because of them.
And it is soft, similar to a gland, and round: and its exit is easy.
For the one who has corners and edges, add something to the incision.
If it does not come out this way, then you must devise something above it: or place something with a gentle grip over it, whose end is like a crescent moon, which grips the stone without slipping away; or insert an instrument below it that is thin and curved at the end.
但如果无法从上方将其取出，那么稍微扩大孔洞。
如果有什么东西被血液阻碍了，用纱布将其移除。
如果结石不止一个，那么首先将较大的推至膀胱口。
然后在其上方进行切开。
随后将较小的推到较大结石之后：如果超过两个也是如此操作。
如果结石非常大，那么需要在较大的切口上方进行切割。
因为病人会出现两种情况之一：要么死亡，要么出现持续的尿液渗漏：因此，因为该部位无法完全愈合。
Indeed, administer its expulsion until it comes out: either use instruments in the fracture with pincers, until you remove it bit by bit.
When you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with thuja, aloe, and dragon's blood: and tighten it, and place over it a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or rose oil, and cold water: so that an abscess may sit warm.
Then have the patient lie on his back with his neck on the pillow, and do not loosen the bandage until the third day.
When you have loosened it, wash the area with water and a lot of oil.
Then treat it with the ointment dyafinicon and the ointment basilicon until it is healed.
If an abscess with heat and corrosion occurs in the wound, and similar conditions arise: as when blood clots in the bladder, preventing urine from passing; this is known by the passage of blood with the urine.
Insert your finger into the wound and extract that blood.
For if it remains, it provokes the corruption of the bladder and its putrefaction.
Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt: and apply all appropriate treatments for its healing until it is healed.
And during the entire period of treatment, you should bind both thighs together for the sake of the medicines that are applied to the area.
If the stone is small and is in the passage of the penis, and it lodges there and impedes the flow of urine: then treat it as I have described before you proceed to cutting.
For you will often avoid the need for cutting through this treatment, as I have already proven. And you should take a perforating instrument made of soft iron, which has this shape: it is triangular at the end and sharp, fixed in wood.
Then take thread and tie the penis below the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.
Then insert the piercing iron into the penis easily until the perforating instrument reaches the stone. And rotate the perforating instrument with your hand on the stone gradually: and attempt to pierce it, until you make it penetrate from the other side.
The urine is immediately relieved.
Then press your hand on what remains of the stone from the outer part of the penis.
It will break apart and come out with the urine, and the patient will be healed.
但如果这种治疗对你来说不可行，由于某些原因阻止了它：那么就在石头下面绑一根线，在石头上面再绑一根线。 然后在阴茎上两处绑扎之间干燥处理石头所在的部位。
然后取出它。
之后解开绑带，并清洁伤口中形成的凝血。
And it is not necessary to place a ligature of thread below the stone unless to prevent its returning to the bladder: and another ligature above, unless so that when the thread dissolves after the passage of the stone, the skin returns to its proper place and closes the wound: and for this reason you must raise the skin upwards when you tie the upper thread, so that it will return at the time of healing and close the wound, as we have said.
¶ On the Extraction of Women's Stones.
Chapter LXI.
Stones are rarely formed in women.
If, however, a stone does form in one of them, then the treatment is difficult, and it is prohibited due to many methods.
One of them is this: that perhaps the woman is a virgin. The second is that you do not find a woman who will reveal herself to a doctor when she is chaste or married.
The third is that you do not find a woman well versed in this art, especially the practice with her hand.
The fourth is the distance from the place of the stone: therefore, deep incision is needed, and there is fear in that.
If necessity compels one to do that, then you must take a female doctor who is well-versed; and such are rarely found.
But if you remove that, then seek a chaste male doctor who is subtle, and find a midwife well-educated in matters of women, or a woman who has shown knowledge in this art: make her present, and especially instruct her to do everything you tell her after examining the stone. First, it is necessary to see if the woman is a virgin: then it is required that she insert her finger into the anus and search for the stone.
If she finds it, let her press the stone under her finger, and then instruct the midwife to insert her finger into the patient's wound and search for the stone, after placing her left hand on the bladder and pressing it with good pressure. If she finds the stone, then it is necessary for her to gradually move it from the opening of the bladder downwards with all her strength until it reaches the root of the thigh.
Then cut above him at the midpoint of the navel near the root of the thigh, from whichever side he prepares himself and feels the stone in that part: and his finger must not be removed from the stone, compressing it beneath; and let the incision be small at first.
Then insert the probe above that incision.
If he then feels the stone, let him extend the incision according to a proportional amount so that the stone can come out of it.
And know that there are many types of stones. From these, there is a small one and a large one, a smooth one and a rough one, a long one, and a round one with branches.
Therefore, know the type of it, so that it is made clear to you by this regarding what you wish.
If blood overwhelms you, then add ground wheat to the place, and hold it for one hour until the bleeding stops.
If the flow of blood overwhelms you and you know that the bleeding is from an artery that has been cut, then put powder on the place and bind it with suitable bandages: and do not change this: and leave the stone, and do not extract it.
For the woman may die if she is weak.
Then treat the wound.
When the sharpness of the blood is thus alleviated after days, and the place becomes putrid, then return to your procedure until the stone comes out.
Paragraph on performing a hernia surgery for a hydrocele.
Chapter LXII.
A hydrocele is not something else, but an accumulation of moisture in a sac, which is beneath the white skin covering the scrotal contents that contains the egg, and this sac is called sifac. And sometimes it occurs in its own fatty tissue, which nature has prepared for it in the area of the scrotum until it is perceived; this is a different type of sac, and it is located between the skin of the testicle and the white sac that we mentioned: and this does not happen often.
The generation of this condition indeed stems from weakness that affects the testicles; therefore, this material is discharged to them.
And sometimes it happens due to a blow on the testicles.
And this moisture has many colors. The color of this moisture may vary: it can be tinged toward a yellowish hue, or it can be blood-red, or it can be dirty and black, or it can be clear and white, and the last one is more common.
If it is in the white sac that we mentioned, then the swelling is round in length somewhat like the shape of a scrotum: and the testicle does not appear, because the moisture contains it from all sides.
And if there is moisture in the skin of its own kind, then the abscess is round with a part like an egg, and for this reason the person suffers because it is another kind of swelling.
And if the moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the white membrane, then it falls under the category of hydrocele.
When you wish to determine the color of the moisture, then observe the color of the moisture in the abscess using a square probe whose form has been described previously.
According to what emerges when the probe is inserted, judge about what is between it.
When we come to the treatment with iron, then it is necessary that you instruct the patient to have phlebotomy if it is possible for him, and you should see if his body is full [of moisture or blood].
Then have him lie on his back on something raised slightly, and place many cloths under him.
Then sit on his left side, and instruct the assistant to sit on his right side, who will extend his leg to one of the sides of the skin of the testicles, and to the part near the navel.
Then take a broad scalpel and cut the skin of the testicles lengthwise from the middle down to near the pubic region; make the incision along a straight line that divides the skin of the testicles until it reaches the white membrane: and dissect this carefully, or be cautious not to cut into it. Your dissection should be on the side where the skin hangs more with the egg-shaped part, and examine it thoroughly according to its size as much as possible.
Then pierce the bladder full of water with a wide incision, and remove all the water. Then separate between the two lips of the section with hooks, and lift up the bladder toward the upper area, and do not touch the skin covering the testicles: and cut the bladder wherever it is possible for you to cut it, either entirely or in pieces, especially its thin side.
For if you do not examine it carefully, there will be no security from the water returning in the cutting of it.
But if the egg protrudes externally from its skin during the time of your operation: then when you have completed the cutting of the bladder, return it.
Then join the two lips of the skin of the testicles with stitches.
Then treat it as you would other wounds until it heals.
If you find the egg corrupted by some blackening, then it is necessary to ligate the vessels, which are the suspensory muscles, fearing a flow of blood.
Then cut off the testicle with the suspensory muscle, and remove the egg; afterwards treat it as we have said.
If, however, the water has gathered in two parts, then you know there are two branches: cut therefore the other part as you did the first one equally.
And if it is equal for you to have one operation, then do this: afterwards remove the blood.
And insert into the incisions wool soaked in oil, or in scented oil: and place outside another piece of wool that you have soaked in wine and oil, and spread it over both testicles and the lower abdomen: and put a double cloth on top, and use bandages to secure them above with a ligature, which should be six fingers wide in this form.
Then two pieces of cloth are taken and soaked, and filled with red camphor: and they are made into edges which press from a board or wet wool: and they are gathered together tightly around the waist: and one edge takes it above the anus to the back, and the second takes it to the groin area: and two edges take them below onto both thighs, and two other edges above onto both groins, and the whole tight gathering is made around the waist.
And sometimes this branch is treated artificially with a cautery at the place of the cut with iron: and take a thin knife-like cautery, and cut with it the skin of the testicles: and heat it as we have described: until when the white moist tissue containing water becomes visible: then take the cautery in this manner.
It is assimilated to the Greek letter.
Then pierce it with that white moist tissue, and heat it until all the moisture is expelled.
Then stretch the tissue with hooks, and scrape it with a thin heated cautery, and cut it as much as possible until all of its roots are removed.
And be careful, lest the fire touch it.
And know that this procedure is safer, farther from blood flow, and better than the procedure with cutting.
But if opposition arises for you at the hour of cutting or at the hour of cauterizing, such as a warm abscess, blood flow, or something else: then it is necessary to treat what opposes you with the treatment suitable for it, as was mentioned before.
If the patient is fearful and does not await this procedure due to its horror: then administer the puncture as I describe it: and that is all.
When you have determined by what we have said about the signs that the humor is watery: then it is necessary for you to seat the patient on a raised chair.
Then puncture the abscess at its lower part with a thin blade: and place the puncture along the length of the body, and let the opening be wide, until all the fluid runs out.
Then place a cup over the puncture site and ligate it, allowing the remaining fluid to flow out: then treat it until the wound heals.
If, however, there is an obstacle to the exit of the fluid when you puncture it: and this is only because the white membrane causes obstruction at the wound opening and prevents the outflow of fluid: then it is necessary to insert a feather into the wound, or a tool used to extract water from hydropic patients, which has been described previously: or add this procedure temporarily during the treatment of the wound.
And know that the fluid returns and accumulates after six months, or thereabouts.
When it accumulates, then it should be treated in the same manner, and the patient will spend their days until recovery.
¶ On the Treatment of Carnous Humors.
Chapter LXIII.
Know that in the treatment of this Carnous Humor, fear often leads to danger in many cases.
Therefore, it seems to me that its discharge can be salvaged from it.
And I am recalling the procedure for it, and the appearance of the abscess.
I say then that many abscesses occur in the body parts from which the testicles are composed: and this happens for many reasons, namely. Or from an acute excess, or something sharp and acrid that is discharged to the testicles.
Or from a blow.
And the color of the abscess is according to the color of the body, and there is no pain found in it: and the abscess is severe.
And perhaps it is a stone-like abscess, whose color is dark, and there is no sensation in it.
And sometimes it happens due to the constriction of arteries and their swelling: as has already been mentioned in the previous recall: or from the swelling of veins.
What is caused by the swelling of arteries can be recognized by the condition of the abscess when you press it with your fingers.
And there is no need to touch it entirely.
That which is caused by the swelling of veins does not dissipate when pressed with your fingers. And now it is possible to perform surgery on this type and on other parts of the body: and you should cut the skin of the testicles.
Then extend the egg upward, and remove it with a white cloth: and free the spermatic cord from the vessels, and ligate the vessels: and cut the spermatic cord after you have freed it from all parts of the testicle.
If therefore the egg is consolidated with the flesh that has grown, then it is necessary to pull out the egg and cut it open. And if there is an adhering part among the siphon-like structures or in what lies between the vessels, then it is necessary to free the entire adhering part and cut it with a circular incision.
If there is a growth of flesh in the adhering place that is behind, then it is necessary to cut away all of it and extract the egg, as we have said. When your work is completed, then fill the wound with wool infused in rose oil and wine; then care for it with the remaining treatment until it heals.
¶ On the Treatment of Swellings That Are Like Grapes, Which Occur with the Vessel.
Chapter LXIIII.
A boil is a concealed swelling, wrapped in some manner, resembling a bunch, with softening of the testicles: and it makes movement and exercise difficult for the patient, as well as walking.
And in the treatment of this illness is due to fear, because of the anticipation of what has preceded.
However, it is necessary to say that the procedure for this should be as those who came first did it. I say therefore that you should have the patient sit on a raised seat.
Then cut with a sharp wide blade in a transverse direction along the course of the vessels until the vessels are exposed.
Then remove the skin from all parts as we have told you when extracting the arteries that are in the temples.
Then cut them in the middle section straight along the length of the body, and remove what has aggregated from foul, corrupted moistures.
Then treat the wound with the care given to other wounds where you wish pus to form, so that the vessels that nourish one of the testicles may fall.
For it is not harmful through that.
If all the vessels are affected, then it is necessary to remove the testicles with the vessels: so that the sperm is not deprived of nourishment due to the incision, and does not waste away or dry up, and thus be of no use.
¶ On the Treatment of Intestinal Ulcers. Chapter LXV.
Therefore, the intestines descend due to that rupture to one of the testicles.
And this rupture is either from a sword cut or from the extension of it.
And these two kinds occur for many causes. Or from a blow. Or from jumping. Or from shouting. Or from lifting a heavy object and similar activities.
And the sign is when it is from the stretching of the sinew.
It happens gradually over a long period of time and does not happen suddenly: and it is an abscess equal in depth: therefore, because the sinew compresses the intestine.
And the sign of it when it is from the cutting of the sinew, because it suddenly causes intense pain from its beginning: and it is a different kind of abscess, appearing under the skin nearby: and that is due to the exit of the intestine and its course to the outer surface of the sinew.
And sometimes it protrudes with the small intestine, and this is called an intestinal hernia or bulge, and it sometimes happens due to gas.
And sometimes feces move into the intestine and are retained there: and this is harmful to the patient: for it causes severe pain, especially when it is compressed.
And in the treatment of the types of this illness with iron there is danger: therefore it is necessary to be cautious about mishaps in that regard.
And the method of treatment is to instruct the patient to return the intestine to the interior of the cavity with his own hand, if it obeys the return.
Then he lies back onto his neck between your hands: and raise his legs.
Then extend the skin that follows above, and cut the entire skin of the testicles along its length.
Then fix hooks in both lips of the incision, as needed to open the incision with them: and let the incision be of such a size that it is possible for the egg to come out from it.
Then strip the siphak and what is under the skin of the testicles until the white, hard siphak is exposed from all sides: then insert your index finger into what follows behind the testicle, into what is between the white siphak under the skin of the scrotum and the second siphak, and sever the attachment that is at the rear part of the scrotum.
Then move with your right hand towards the inner skin of the testicles: and while doing this, extend the white siphak upwards with your left hand: and lift the egg with the siphak to the part of the incision: and instruct the assistant to extend the egg upwards: and you release the attachment that is at the rear when the procedure is complete.
And search with your fingers to ensure that there is nothing from the wrapped intestine in the white hard siphak.
但如果发现有肠子在里面：则将其推向下腹部。
Then take a needle with thick thread made of licium from ten threads: and insert it at the last siphak, that is, the tunic, which is under the skin of the testicles following the incision: then cut the ends that protrude from the thread until there are four threads.
Then arrange some of them above with a figure in the shape of a cross: and bind it with alsifach, of which we have spoken, because it is a strong ligament under the skin of the testicles, until none can pass from the vessels that nourish them to them anything: so that no hot abscess may occur there.
And place another ligature outside the first ligature, at a distance of less than two fingers from it.
And after these two ligatures, let loose from the sifach, which is under the skin of the testicles, a quantity equal to the size of a finger: and cut away the rest entirely according to its roundness, and remove the egg from it.
Then dry the lower part of the skin of the testicles where blood and pus flow, as we have described in what was said before.
Then apply wool soaked in oil to the wound: and apply the ligature as we have described.
And sometimes the white sifach that we mentioned is cauterized after cutting it, to prevent bleeding.
For this often happens.
And leave the ligature in place until it falls off on its own.
If, however, it does not fall off on its own, then apply it with warm water: and place upon it what we have mentioned, until it falls off.
Then treat the wound with the usual care for wounds until it is healed.
Of the Windpipe.
Chapter LXVI.
In this matter of the windpipe, I have not seen anyone who has dared to treat it with iron.
And the first ones said that it is done as we have narrated for the windpipe that is with a vine.
This means that you should tie vessels above the section with ease below it; then dry in the middle, and treat finally with what opens it until the vessels fall off: and treat the wound as we said, until it heals.
Of the rupture that occurs in the groin.
Chapter LXVII.
When a rupture occurs in the groin, as we said, and a place protrudes but nothing from the intestines descends to the testicles: and if it does descend, it is little, and returns at all hours; however, if it extends over time, the fissure in the scrotum increases until the intestines descend into the scrotum.
And this happens due to the stretching of the scrotum, which is in the groin, as we said.
This means that the scrotum is stretched; then it softens, and a place becomes inflamed and protrudes.
And the treatment for it is with cautery, as was previously described.
And at times it is treated with iron in this manner: and it is done by having the patient lie on their back with you between their hands.
Then dry the place of ruptured abscesses and elevations, cutting across the width, according to a quantity of three fingers.
Then pull the al-sifak and what is beneath the skin until the white sifach, which is under the skin that follows it, becomes visible.
Then take the rod and place it on the elevated area of the sifach, and press it down into the depth of the abdomen.
Then sew the two elevated areas above the end of the rod from the sifach together, and connect them with a stitch; then remove the end of the rod.
And do not cut the al-sifach completely, nor stretch it, nor do anything else as I have shown you in the treatment of intestinal hernias. Then treat it as you would treat a wound.
When you cut the thread, clean it and treat the wound until it heals.
For the sisach contracts, and does not add to the elevation of the rupture.
And cautery is better in this case: for it is closer to providing healing.
¶ On the softening of the skin of the testicles.
Chapter LXVIII.
The skin of the testicles often softens in some men, because of which the flesh between them also becomes softened, and the appearance is spoiled.
Therefore, it is necessary for the one who is asked to treat this condition to have the patient lie on his back and to cut away all the softened skin down to the natural skin. Then join the two lips with a stitch: and if you wish, first soften any excess skin with three stitches or four, and then make a firm suture.
Then treat it as you would other wounds until it heals and the stitches fall out.
¶ On Castration.
Chapter LXIX.
Know that castration is excommunicated in our law: and because of this, it would be fitting for me not to recall it in this book of mine: and there is no need to recall it unless for two methods.
One of these is that it should be known to the medical practitioner when asked about it: and so that he knows its treatment for one who has undergone it.
And the other method is that we often require castration of certain animals for our livestock purposes through it, such as rams, boars, and cats, and similar animals.
I say, then, that castration is performed according to two methods. Or through abrasion.
Or through a cut and section.
In the method that is performed through abrasion, the way of the operation is: we place the animal in warm water until its testicles soften and become loose and hang down; then rub them with your hand until they dissolve and do not appear to the touch.
In castration, however, through a slit and section, you must hold the animal, and press the skin of its testicles with your left hand.
And this method of castration is better than the one that is done by abrasion: because abrasion might leave some part of the testicles, hence the animal desires copulation.
Then care for the wound until it heals.
¶ On the Treatment of Hermaphrodites in Two Methods.
Chapter 70.
A hermaphrodite of the male type is considered in two ways.
One of them is because it appears in the space between the testicles, or on the skin covering the testicles, in a place that is between the two testicles, with a shape like the genitalia of a woman, where there are hairs: and sometimes urine runs from that area on the skin covering the testicles.
In women, however, there is one form, and it is the genitalia of a woman on the pubis like small male testicles, protruding outward: one of them resembles the penis of a man, and two resemble the two testicles.
And the treatment for the three types, two of which are from males, and one type from females, is as follows: because it is necessary to cut away the added flesh until the impression of it recedes.
Then treat them with the treatment of other wounds.
In the second kind of injury to men, which comes from where urine exits, in the skin of the testicles, there is no operation, and it requires no treatment at all.
Concerning the cutting of scars and protruding flesh in women's wounds.
Chapter LXXI.
A scar may be added above the natural place until it becomes disfigured and unattractive in appearance: and sometimes it enlarges in some women to such an extent that it spreads out like in men, and reaches even to intercourse.
Therefore, you must hold the excess of the scar with your hand or with a hook, and cut it: and do not go too deep in cutting, especially at the root: so that bleeding does not occur.
Then treat it with the treatment of wounds until it heals.
However, the flesh that arises is the flesh that grows in the opening of the womb until it fills it: and sometimes it protrudes to the exterior like a tail: and because of this some call the illness "tailed.
Therefore, we must cut it as we would a scar, and treat it until it heals.
Concerning the treatment of the Alratica, which is an unpenetrated wound in women.
Chapter LXXII.
The Alratica is when there is a wound in women that has not penetrated, or the opening is small.
And it is either natural or accidental.
The accidental is due to a disease that preceded it: and this indeed arises either from flesh naturally added, or from a thin or thick membrane; and it occurs either in the deep parts of the uterus, or on its sides, or above or below it: and it prevents intercourse, impregnation, and childbirth, and perhaps also menstruation.
And the knowledge of it is gained through the examination of midwives if there is an apparent obstructive condition that is close to the opening.
But if it is not apparent, then seek it with your fingers, or with a probe.
But if the obstruction is due to a thin membrane and is close to the two lips: then hurry and rupture it.
And you should place small pieces of cotton on the two lips.
Then place the index fingers of both hands simultaneously, and have the woman lie on her back with her legs spread.
Then spread the two lips with force until the thin membrane is ruptured and the obstruction is opened.
Then take wool, soak it in oil, and place it on the area: and let the woman have intercourse every day so that the area does not heal in another way.
But if the membrane is thick and dense: then it is necessary to cut it with a sharp instrument similar to the leaf of a myrtle tree.
But if the obstruction is due to flesh that has grown, then suspend it with hooks and cut it: and have medicines that stop blood flow without causing pain, such as acacia, dragon's blood, and frankincense mixed with egg white.
Then administer a wide lead tube so that the wound does not heal too quickly; let him hold it for several days. Then apply lint made from dry linen, and treat the rest with regular care until it is healed.
And sometimes the birth of other flesh occurs within the womb. Therefore, it is necessary to proceed with an incision in this manner: when there is no malignant abscess, do not make any opposition with iron for a malignant abscess that exists within the womb at all.
¶ On the treatment of hemorrhoids, Athelhil, and red boils on women's wounds.
Chapter LXXIII.
Hemorrhoids are indeed the dilation of venous openings, allowing blood to flow out from them in large quantities continuously.
When hemorrhoids become old, they form ulcers: and I have already mentioned their types and signs in the division. Here, I will say which of them receive treatment and which do not.
I say that hemorrhoids which are in the opening of the womb and do not appear to the senses: then they cannot be treated with iron.
Those of them that are in the opening of the womb and can be detected by the senses are those that can be treated.
Therefore, it is necessary to bring the woman into a cold room.
Then extend the hemorrhoids with forceps or with a rough cloth, and cut them from their roots.
Then powder should be sprinkled on them near the flow of blood from powdered substances without any alteration: such as acacia, dragon's blood, frankincense, and similar items.
Then urge his feet against the wall at one o'clock.
Then place her in cold water.
If the flow of blood persists: then have her sit in a decoction of sumac, pomegranate bark, gallnuts, and similar ingredients.
Then take barley flour, mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a plaster with it to apply to her back.
If the blood is cut off with it, that is good: and if not, apply suction cups to the back and breasts without making incisions.
Then take wool and soak it in the juice of tarathom, or the juice of arnoglossa, or the juice of alaulus branches, which is also called aglantine or Pontic wine, and apply it to the wound.
When the abscess has subsided, then treat the area with ointments until it heals.
However, the white variety is similar to the red heads of alhaasse, but has a rough appearance.
Therefore, you must cut away what appears to be affected, as I described for the treatment of thelil, equally: and treat it until it heals.
Regarding the puncturing of the Exiture which occurs in the uterus.
Chapter LXXIV.
Many types of abscesses can occur in the uterus, such as cancer, stone abscess, ulcers, adubelati, and alekilati, which is herpes, aestiomemus, and fistulas, hemorrhoids, ragadia, thilil, and hot abscess.
And I have already mentioned all these diseases and their kinds, and the signs of them, and their treatments in the division: it is necessary for me to say in this tractate about a hot abscess that occurs in the womb, when it is one of those abscesses which gather pus, and you wish to know how its opening is made with iron.
Therefore, you should consider this.
Then if the pain of the abscess at its onset is sharp with a throbbing quality, and there is heat and fever: and you see it becoming red: if sensation falls upon it, then do not hurry with its perforation: and treat it with what aids maturation until when the acuteness of the symptoms subsides.
Then you should have the woman sit on a seat that has two footrests, and recline or lean back onto her back, and draw her feet towards the lower part of her abdomen: and let her hips be spread apart, and place her arms under her knees, and secure them with a suitable ligature.
Then the midwife should sit at the woman's right side and administer the instrument with which the opening of the womb is made.
The form of which comes in those that follow.
And when you wish to administer this instrument, it is necessary to insert it deeply into the woman's womb with a rod: so that what enters through the instrument does not go beyond the depth of the uterus and injure the patient.
If the instrument is longer than necessary, then you should place small wheels on the part that goes deep into the uterus: to prevent the entire instrument from entering too deeply into the uterus: and it is necessary to put a spiral on the upper side of the instrument: and for the assistant to hold the instrument and rotate the spiral until the depth of the uterus is opened.
When it is apparent that the protrusion is present and can be touched by hand, and it is soft and pliable, then it should be cut off at its base with a narrow blade.
When the pus has been evacuated, it is necessary to place a lint pad immersed in rose oil or green oil, which has a certain acridity. Place the lint and remove the pad deep into the wound cavity.
And place externally on the wound and on the pubis clean wool immersed in water in which figs have been boiled.
Then treat it after two days with an ointment that is appropriate for it until it heals.
And sometimes the womb and wound are washed so that they are enemaed with water and honey; then with water in which the root of the lily or Aristolochia longa has been boiled, and then return to using ointment.
If the wound is concealed inside the womb, then you must avoid treating it with iron; instead, treat it as we have described in the division.
Obstetric Practice: How to treat living embryos that have emerged in a position other than the natural one.
Chapter LXXIV.
It is necessary for the obstetrician to first know the natural position of the fetus during birth.
From these signs, it is evident that when you see a woman pressing down and desiring to breathe fresh air, and feeling relieved of what is on her concerning the birth, and the exit of the embryo hastens: then know that this birth is in its natural position, and its exit will be head-first, and the afterbirth with it; or suspended or hanging from the umbilical cord. When you see these signs, then it is necessary to compress the abdomen so that the fetus descends quickly.
However, any delivery other than this is unnatural and disapproved of.
For sometimes the fetus comes out feet first, and its body emerges before its head, with one foot or hand coming out first, or perhaps the head and one hand; or it is a breech birth, and possibly it turns around its neck, and similar cases of disapproved positions.
Therefore, it is necessary for the obstetrician to be prudent and discerning in all these matters, and to guard against error and deception. I am showing every position among them, and how one should proceed with each, and what they signify, and how to act upon them.
When the fetus comes out head first in its natural position, but becomes violent against the woman, and the labor becomes difficult for her, and you see that her strength is weakening: then have her sit on a seat, or let the women hold her, and vaporize the area with fenugreek decoction and moist oils.
Then the midwife should insert a small spatula between her fingers and use it to separate the afterbirth, cutting it with her fingernail until all the moisture within flows out; and press the woman's abdomen so that the fetus descends.
If it does not descend, then the woman should be given an enema made of fenugreek mucilage mixed with sesame oil.
Then instruct her after the enema to compress it: and make her sneeze with prepared material, and hold her mouth and nose for one hour.
For the fetus will come out immediately.
If two hands of the fetus come out first, it is necessary to gently guide them back gradually.
If it does not obey at entry, then place the woman on a seat and raise her feet upwards: then shake the seat on the ground: and hold the woman so that she does not fall during the shaking.
If the hands do not come out and the fetus dies: then cut them, and remove the rest of the fetus: tie its hand with cloth, and remove it gently: for it will come out.
The exit of the embryo occurs with its feet first.
When the fetus comes out with its feet first, then it is necessary to push the feet upwards: then gradually turn the fetus: afterwards adjust it.
Then take one of its feet and gradually extend it.
When they come out up to the hips, then instruct her to compress it, and make her sneeze with prepared material: for it will come out if God willing.
And if it does not come out as we have described, then gradually guide the fetus back until you place it in its natural position.
For it will then come out with an easier delivery.
If what we have described is prohibited, then take mucilage of linseed, and sesame oil, and dissolved gum: and pound all well in a mortar: then apply it to the woman's wound, and below her abdomen.
Then have her sit in warm water until she achieves relaxation of the lower abdomen.
When you see that her lower parts are now warm, then give her a decoction of myrrh to apply.
When she has held the decoction for one hour, then have her sit on a seat.
Then have her sneeze: and pinch her mouth and nose: and gently press the lower part of her abdomen.
For the object will come out immediately.
¶ The fetus exits over the knees and hands.
When it exits in this manner, then gently insert your hands gradually.
Then have the woman lie back on her neck, and let her feet hang downward: and she should be lying on the bed, and clench her hands.
Then gently press above her abdomen gradually.
Then remove what is under her feet from the coverings, until she is prepared at the lower part.
If the fetus does not come out, then take her feet and move them vigorously.
Then gently press above the lower abdomen gradually, until the fetus rises to the upper part.
Then insert his hand and gradually turn the fetus: and instruct the woman to push until the fetus comes out.
The fetus exits horizontally held in the hands.
He will devise a method for reducing the hand.
If he is unable to reduce it, then lift the woman and have her walk.
If she is unable to walk, then have her lie on the bed: and shake her legs vigorously.
Then administer the ointment that you prepared from mucilages.
If she begins the labor, then have her sit on a chair.
Then strive to reduce the hand, and align the fetus according to its natural shape: and make the woman sneeze, and instruct her to push until it comes out.
The fetus exits with its hands extended and its face toward the mother's back, lying over its own neck.
The midwife must hold the hand of the fetus, then gradually turn it, and align it with ease.
When it is aligned, then place on its membrane what we have mentioned made from oil and mucilages.
Then instruct her to move it gradually.
When you have done this, then have her sit on a chair, and instruct her to lean to the right side.
Then instruct her to hold it compressed: and make her sneeze when you have prepared it.
The preparation of the fetus exiting on the side.
When it descends to the mouth of the womb in this manner with the afterbirth, then cut the afterbirth with your nail until it is cleared of moisture.
If it is suspended over the face of the fetus and its neck, then cut it from the navel so that it is not retained and the fetus does not die.
Then push the fetus inward until you position it as necessary: and instruct the woman to compress herself several times, for it will then emerge with a gentle expulsion.
The delivery of twins or multiple fetuses.
Know that twins often are born: and sometimes three, and four are born.
However, that is uncommon and rarely happens.
Five is beyond nature, and they do not survive completely: and despite their number, there is one afterbirth that contains them: and they are separated by a membrane, distinguishing between them the umbilical cord of each.
And sometimes they emerge as a single fetus would with a natural and easy delivery: and they can also emerge through an unpraiseworthy expulsion, as we have described. If some of them are difficult during delivery and reach what we have mentioned regarding unnatural positions, then treat them as we have described: and the midwife should be subtle, and act with ease and deliberation, and devise solutions according to every figure necessary for their preparation, guided by skill toward safety.
Sometimes one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and more than ten are formed in the womb: and it has been confirmed to me that a woman miscarried seven, and another fifteen, all of them formed.
This was done through the measurement by the renowned wise one.
Therefore, all of this must be known by the obstetrician. Perhaps something similar to that will come before her; she should therefore be prepared with what is necessary.
On the extraction of a dead fetus.
When you are caring for a dead fetus, after using the methods I described in the division on medication and it does not emerge, and you must resort to an operation with your hand, then you should carefully consider.
If the woman is of healthy constitution and does not have any conditions that might cause concern for her safety: then she should be laid on her back on the bed, face up, with her head tilted downward and her legs raised. The attendant should hold her by both sides or secure her to the bed so that her body does not be pulled out during the extraction of the fetus.
Then moisten the mouth of the uterus with oils that are moist and have added mucilage from barley, fenugreek, and flaxseed. Then the obstetrician should anoint her hand with these oils and mucilages, then gently insert it into the uterus.
Then let them seek a place where they may implant hooks from the fetus, and places suitable for that.
Therefore, consider if the fetus is prepared to descend upon its head: then fix the hooks in its eyes, or in its neck, or in its mouth, or in its palate, or under its beard, or in its clavicle, or in places near the ribs, and below the navel.
But if the descent is upon its feet, then fix the hooks in its hip bone and in its middle ribs.
And it is necessary that he hold the hook with his right hand: and place its curve between the fingers of the left hand: and insert it with ease, and fix the hook in one of those places we mentioned, until it reaches the empty space.
Then it should be extended equally, and not just in a straight line, but moved to all sides, so that its exit is eased: as is done with a tooth during its extraction.
And it is necessary between those parts that the extension be made gently and gradually.
If a part is retained within, then the midwife should anoint some fingers with oil and insert them to turn what is retained with them.
If a part of the fetus comes out, then move the hooks to a higher position: do this until the entire fetus is delivered.
If therefore the hand comes out before other [parts], and it is not possible to reduce it, because of its constriction: then it must be wrapped with cloth.
Then extract it until it comes out completely, cut it either at the joint of the foot or at the elbow: and thus you must do for the other hand, and for both feet.
If, however, the fetus's head is large, or constriction occurs during delivery, or water has accumulated in its head: then it is necessary to insert between the fingers a sharp object called Spatumile spinosum, and cut with it the head, and extract the water: or break it with an instrument called Almisdac: whose form comes with the forms of the other instruments in the chapter that follows this one.
Similarly, if the fetus has a naturally large head, then it is necessary to cut with algengematu: or extract it with misdach, as we have said.
Then pull the bones with forceps.
If the head comes out and is constricted at the collarbone: then it must be cut until the moisture that is in the chest is released.
If, however, it does not curl up and does not submit to delivery: then cut the head in pieces, as much as is possible for you.
If there are abscesses below the belly, or if there is water accumulation in it: then it is necessary to puncture it until the moisture runs out.
If the fetus is above its feet, then extracting it is easy, and directing it toward the mother's birth canal is smooth.
If it is constricted at the abdomen or chest, then you must extract it with a cloth that you have wrapped around your hand and cut open the abdomen or chest until what is inside runs out.
If the remaining limbs are removed and the head returns, then the midwife should insert her left hand. If the mouth of the womb is open, then insert the hand deeply into the uterus and search for the head with it, and pull it with your fingers until it reaches the mouth of the womb: then insert a hook or two hooks and pull it with them.
If the mouth of the womb is constricted due to a hot abscess that has occurred: then do not attempt labor upon it, but rather administer an infusion of moist and fatty substances, and apply plasters: and let her sit in waters that soften and moisturize.
If the fetus is positioned on its side, then it can be corrected: administer what we have said about a living fetus.
If it is not possible to correct it, then cut it in pieces and extract it.
And you must ensure that none of the afterbirth remains inside at all.
When you have completed your procedure, then administer what we have said about hot abscesses that occur in the uterus.
If bleeding occurs, then have her sit in aromatic baths and administer the remaining treatment.
And I have indeed seen a woman in whose womb a fetus had died; she became pregnant again afterward, but another fetus also died later.
Therefore, after a long time, an abscess formed in his navel, and it became swollen until it burst open: and it began to discharge pus.
I was summoned to treat him, and I treated him for a long time: but the wound did not heal.
I applied some strong adhesive plasters to him: and the opening came out from the place.
Then after several days passed, another opening came out.
I was therefore surprised by that, since there is no opening in the abdomen.
I therefore thought that they were from the bones of a dead fetus.
I examined the wound and extracted many bones, with the woman being in better condition: and she has lived this way for a long time, and now only discharges a little pus from the place.
And I did not strengthen this foreign matter here, except because there is knowledge and assistance with it, which the skilled physician administers by hand in treatment.
¶ On the Forms of Instruments Necessary for the Extraction of a Fetus.
Chapter LXXVII.
Here below is the form of the Spreader, which books describe, to which are equally two spirals at the extremities of two pieces of wood.
However, this spiral should be finer than the Spreader itself: and it should be made either from ebony or boxwood.
And the width of the entire piece of wood should be about two fingers: and each side's edge is like one finger, and the length of each of them is a palm and half: and between the two pieces of wood there are two additional parts of the same kind of wood, which are now fixed in both, whose length is half a palm and a little more: and the width of each is about two fingers, or a little more.
And these two additional parts are inserted into the opening of the matrix so that it opens when you turn two screws.
The shape of the screw with which the matrix is opened.
Another form similar to that one, finer, and lighter.
It should be made of ebony wood or boxwood, according to the similarity of the forceps.
However, at its end there should be two additional parts as you see here above: and the length of each of these additions is about a palm: and the width of each is two fingers.
When you want to open the matrix with it, then have the woman sit on a bed with her feet hanging down and what is between her legs opened.
Then insert those two connected additional parts into the matrix: and you should hold the end of the instrument below between her hips.
Then open your hand with the instrument as you do with forceps, evenly according to the amount you want from the opening of the matrix's mouth, until the midwife achieves what she wants.
The shape of the second screw, which the ancients called the Shape of the Pusher with which the fetus is pushed.
Shape of the Almisdac with which the small bone is crushed. Shape of pincers having one spine.
Shape of pincers having two spines.
Shape of forceps with saw-like teeth, with which the fetal bone is crushed.
Shape of the Spatumilis having two ends for cutting off the bone.
Shape of two Spatumilis that are also holders.
All these instruments are exercised, and the more their varieties are multiplied and prepared by the craftsman, the quicker they are to perform their function, and the more highly regarded among people due to their quantity.
Therefore, do not despise any of these instruments so that it is not prepared for you.
Their necessity is indeed inexcusable.
¶ On the Extraction of the Afterbirth.
Chapter LXXVIII.
When the afterbirth is retained by the mother after childbirth, then you must instruct the woman to hold her breath.
Then make her sneeze when you have prepared it: and press your hand over her mouth, and her nostrils.
If therefore it comes out this way, it is good.
If not: then take a pot, and pierce a hole in the cover: and put in it herbs that open the womb, such as rush, rue, and dill, and chamomile, and caraway, and lignum cassia, and centaury: take all these herbs, or some of them, and soak them with water, and place them over fire.
Then place a tube of reed over the hole in the pot's cover, and the other end in the mouth of the womb: and hold it until the vapor reaches the concavity of the womb.
Then make her sneeze, as we said.
For the secundine will come out with ease.
If however it remains after this treatment, and does not come out: then instruct the midwife to immerse her hand in sesame oil, or barley jelly. Then insert it into the womb, and search for the secundine with it.
When she has found it, then let her take it and gradually extend it.
If however it is attached deep within the womb, then insert her hand as we have described, until she finds the secundine, and gradually extract it along a straight line so that the womb does not collapse due to strong traction: rather, it should be gently guided to the sides right and left: then add according to the amount of traction required.
For then it sticks, and is preserved, and escapes from adhering.
If the mouth of the womb is constricted, as we have already described: treat it with sneezing, and by means of a pot filled with herbs.
But if it does not come out with all the methods we have described, then be careful not to exhaust her through repeated attempts at extraction.
However, what comes out to the mouth of the womb should be tied to the woman's hip.
Then administer an enema with the four-ingredient ointment.
For it will decay after days, and dissolve, and come out.
However, when it putrefies, a foul smell from it will rise to the stomach and head, and harm the patient.
Therefore, appropriate fumigations should be administered for it.
Some of the ancient experts have already used fumigations of watercress and dried figs.
The form of the instrument with which a woman is fumigated for the retention of afterbirth and menstrual disorders.
It should be made of glass like an alcama, or of ceramic: and place the wider end over fire: and the fumigation should be placed on embers: let her hold it until that fumigation is consumed: then use another one.
Regarding the treatment of an imperforated anus.
Chapter Seventy-Nine.
Many children are born with their foreskins not perforated, which should be carefully treated with fine silk thread.
Therefore, the midwife should pierce it with a fine silk thread with her finger; and if that is not possible, she should use a sharp spatula. She must be careful not to touch him roughly.
Then place wool soaked in wine and oil over it.
Then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
但如果担心它再次闭合，那么就放置一个铅制的小管在开口处多天，直到孩子需要排泄时再移除。
而且肛门闭合也可能由于伤口愈合或脓肿形成而发生。
因此，必须切开已经愈合的部分，然后按照我们所说的用治疗伤口和铅管的方法进行处理。 关于发生在下体部位瘘管的治疗。
Chapter Eighty.
发生在下体的瘘管表现为肛门外靠近肛门处或两部分之间的肿块和结节，可能是单个瘘管或多发性瘘管。
当这种结节老化时，它会开口，并从中流出清澈的水样液体或稀薄的脓液。
有时这些瘘管是穿透性的。
And there are among them fistulas when they are in the space penetrating up to the bladder, and up to the urethra.
And there are among them those that penetrate up to the joint of the hip, and up to the tailbone.
From what is known to distinguish a fistula that penetrates up to the anus from one that does not penetrate is this: insert your index finger into the anus: and insert a thin probe into the fistula made of air or iron: when there is no curvature.
If there is a curvature in it, then insert into it a thin probe made of lead or a hair from the tail of a horse, until you feel the probe or hair on your finger.
If you do not feel it thoroughly, and nothing comes out of the hole in evacuation, nor flatulence, nor a worm as I said: then know that it is not penetrating: hurry therefore to its treatment.
And when a fistula is penetrating up to the bladder, or to the urethra: then its indication is the discharge of urine from it, and preventing this so that the area may heal with medicines.
If it is penetrating up to the joint of the hip, or to the socket of the hip: then its sign is that a probe reaches there, if there is no curvature up to the socket: and the discovery of pain around the area, and that pus comes out from it always: and that treatment does not work in it, nor does it heal with ointment.
And in these penetrating fistulas there is no cure at all; and their treatment is effort and vanity for those foolish doctors who are formed upon them. In that which is not penetrating and not old, healing is hoped for with thread: as I tell you, and I have already tested it: and let the patient lie between your hands on his back: and raise his legs up to his hips, and let his hips be inclined toward his stomach.
Then insert a probe of lead or iron, if the fistula is tortuous, until you know where it reaches.
But if the patient feels it around the anus, then you must insert your index finger into the anus.
If you then feel the probe has penetrated by itself between your finger and either the sinus or the flesh, then you will certainly know that it is penetrating: do not therefore labor on it, because its cure is not possible, as we have said.
They say, however, that the flesh heals in some people, and from the medication which is hoped to be helpful, there is a way to use a fine cautery heated according to the width of the fistula, as was mentioned before, and insert it into the fistula until it reaches near the anus.
Then repeat this two or three times until you know that all the added flesh, which is like the hollow tube of a bird's feather, has been cauterized.
Then treat it with lint wrapped in butter until the cauterized flesh comes out; then treat it with ointments that generate and consolidate flesh.
If it is thus healed, it is good.
And if not, then it will never be healed with any other treatment.
And if the probe exits and does not reach your finger, which is in the anus, and there is a thick layer of flesh between it and the probe: and you see a fistula that follows the surface of the skin, then cut the skin from the beginning of the fistula, and proceed to cut with the probe that is inside the fistula until the incision reaches where the tip of the probe has gone, and the probe will be released and fall out.
Then clean those flesh fibers that resemble the quill of a bird's feather, so that nothing remains of them.
但如果血液占了上风，在你和你的手术之间造成了不便，以至于无法切割那些肉：那么最好用火或锐利的药物进行烧灼。
因为用火进行烧灼可以很好地聚集那些附加肉组织的焦化，止血，并使湿气干燥。
然后用包在黄油里的绵梨叶包裹治疗，或用研磨过的芜箐叶进行治疗，直到伤口排出脓液，并且那些烧焦的肉组织转化为脓液。
然后用促进愈合、生成坚韧肉组织的药膏治疗伤口：这些药物具有收敛和干燥的作用。
因为当它开始愈合时，就意味着已经痊愈：不必担心复发。 If, however, the fistula has already reached the deep part of the anus and extends from excess in the body, then insert your finger into the anus and investigate with it.
If you then feel a tenderness, and between you and it there is a covering of pus or flesh, which is close to penetrating: then there is no operation for that except according to the way of trust and hope.
This is because one of three methods is applied to it: either you cauterize it, as we said; or you cut it until you reach its concavity, so that it is possible for you to insert a probe and treat it from nearby.
And do not proceed far with the cutting so that you do not cut the muscle surrounding the anus, and thus cause involuntary loss of stool to occur in the patient. Then treat it as we have said. Perhaps it will heal: or you may lengthen that covering and clean it after cutting it close to the anus, as we said, either with a probe or with another sharp instrument.
Then cleanse those filtered tissues that are in the cut area as thoroughly as possible with examination.
Then attempt the healing of the entire wound with the cut and at the upper opening where it consolidates: and let the fistula remain open on the inner part of the anus, and this will be easier for the patient.
And sometimes the fistula is treated in this manner: it occurs when you insert a probe into the fistula: and it is on the side of the anus near the surface of the body with skin and edge of the anus: then take a perforated probe, which is like an awl used for preparing leather, in this form.
And insert into it a thread wound from five threads, and wrap it around.
Then insert the probe with thread into the fistula until it reaches its concavity.
If it penetrates near the inner margin of the anus, then remove the thread from that opening: insert your finger into the anus and pull out one end of the thread, and join both ends together: tie them tightly, and leave it for one or two days: and as much as the thread cuts into the flesh, tie it well, until the flesh between the two ends of the thread falls off: then treat the wound until it consolidates and heals.
It is not for you to do this merely to avoid cutting it.
Then proceed with it as we have said, until it is healed.
Shape the spathomilis with thorns to cut the fistula, one end is very sharp and the other is not sharp, so as not to cut what does not need to be cut, as you can see.
Regarding the stitching of hemorrhoids from which blood flows due to their incision: and treat the fissures.
Chapter LXXXI.
There are hemorrhoids according to two methods.
They are either inside the anus, resembling coal bladders or cherry stones: or they are like the pits of grapes.
And there are small ones and large ones: and blood runs from them always, and there is one, and there are many.
And they are outside the anus, and at its extremities.
However, those which are outside the anus are mostly few in moisture, from which clear water or a little blood flows continuously; and they are according to the color of the body.
And the treatment for that which is inside the anus is to instruct the patient to strain, and it should be expressed until the anus protrudes, and the veins become visible to you.
Therefore, suspend them with hooks: or hold them with your nail.
Then cut them at their roots.
If, however, the hooks are not retained in them due to their humidity and softness: then grasp them with a rough cloth, or with a piece of double woolen cloth, and extract them with your fingers.
Then cut them, and sprinkle certain hot powders on them after the cut, so that they remain in place of cautery.
Or cauterize them as was described previously in the chapter on cauterization.
Then treat them with the remaining methods of treatment until they heal.
If the anus does not yield to evacuation, then administer an enema that contains a mild irritant, so that it cleans out what is inside the anus, and yields quickly to evacuation when the patient expels it.
If they are outside the anus, then their removal is light and easy: and you should grasp them with your fingernail, or hook them with a hook, and cut them off.
Then treat them as I have described until they heal.
And for those who recoil from cutting with iron, then you must administer stitches to them in this manner.
Take thread that is rolled up, and insert it into the needle.
Then pull the growth upward and make it penetrate with the needle to its root from the other side: and tie both ends of the thread around the base of the needle, horizontally: and tighten the growth firmly with the stitch.
Then knot the thread, and withdraw the needle.
Do this with all the growths, and leave one of them untouched: so that it can serve to drain excess blood.
Then place a cloth infused in rose oil or cerate on the anus, and put it over the area: and instruct the patient to rest.
Then leave it in place until it falls off on its own.
When the growths fall off, treat them with ointments and other forms of care until they heal.
### On the Treatment of Fissures.
They often occur due to the drying of feces and the constriction of natural passage.
When they become old and medicine is no longer effective on them: then it is necessary to scrape them with the points of Spatumilis or with your nail until they become moist, and remove the upper layer which prevents their healing.
Then care for them until they heal as is necessary.
但如果它们没有愈合：那么再次处理它们时使用比第一次更强烈的刮除方法，直到它们大量出血并剥落，然后继续护理，直到它们痊愈。
关于阿勒·马尔卡尔治疗内外伤的方法，以及阿泰利干性和蚁咬的治疗方法。
然后对其进行护理：如果你想用烙铁处理它，可以按照之前章节中描述的方法进行。
然而，阿泰利干性损伤是一种小而粗糙、颗粒状的圆形突出物，出现在身体表面。
这通常发生在儿童的手上。
其治疗方法是拉伸阿泰利干性损伤，并将其切割掉：或者用丝线或毛发紧紧绑住它，直到它脱落。
And if you wish, cauterize it as mentioned before with fire, or with sharp medicine: and now the inward and outward adhelia are eradicated with the instrument which I call. However, there is also a small raised area that is fine but thick, running deep beneath the surface of the body: and when it encounters cold, it feels like an ant bite within it, and this can occur throughout the entire body, but most often appears in the hands.
And its treatment is to take a tube from the feather of a goose or a strong vulture's feather: and place that tube on the ant bite until the circle of the tube covers parts of it.
Then rotate your hand with the tube until you cut what is around the ant bite: and place it deep into the flesh, and eradicate the ant bite from its root. And if you wish, do this with a tube of copper or iron, in this manner.
Let there be at the top of the tube a loop that is pulled tight and silent, so that its grip on the finger is lighter and its rotation easier.
And if you wish, cauterize the ant bite as mentioned before in the chapter on cauterization regarding adhesion.
¶ On the forms of instruments used for enemas in diseases of the anus, and for relieving abdominal distension and colic.
Chapter LXXXIII.
An enema is sometimes made of silver, or brass, or cast copper, or hammered copper.
And sometimes it happens that from these instruments a small one and a large one are made, according to those in which they are used.
Therefore, what is used in the treatment of small children should be small: and for those whose anus is weak or painful, their enemas should be such as well.
Large enema.
Small enema.
The tube of the enema, that is, the upper part where it is tied off, should be wide according to this method: and there should be a distinction so that the bag can be attached as you see, and the lower end which is inserted into the anus should be blunt, that is, not open; it should be soft, very fine, drawing toward subtlety: and on one side of it there should be two holes, and on the other side one hole.
And the size of the holes should be according to the thickness of reeds, slightly thicker, and there should be a bag in which medicines are placed made from an animal bladder, or from sheepskin rolled up in the shape of a small asofrati: whose base is one palm wide.
When the bag is placed on it, it should be tightly secured at the top of the enema between the two distinguishing constrictions.
Then administer an enema with it.
And this is the form of the circle as depicted here, and of the holes. The quality of administering an enema with it is as follows: fill a bladder or bag with medicine that has been warmed according to the patient's tolerance level. And be careful that it is not too hot or too cold.
Then the patient should lie supine on their back and raise their legs upwards. Place a cushion, that is, leather or cloth under them on which people recline.
Then anoint the tip of the enema with oil, or egg white, or fenugreek mucilage, or something similar.
Then insert it into the anus gently.
Then the attendant should take the bag with both hands and press it forcefully until everything in the enema is evacuated into the intestine. Then remove the enema, and have the patient raise their legs towards the wall. If the medicine tends to come out, then he should hold it back as much as possible.
And if he sleeps with it throughout the night, it is more beneficial for his recovery.
但如果你在他腹痛等疾病的治疗中给他做灌肠，且排泄迅速：那么应反复进行灌肠，直到他康复。
If hemorrhoids or ulcerative sores are in the anus, then a very fine and mild enema should be used, such as those given to children.
And this is the form of a fine enema, for which the skin should be taut.
Concerning the Treatment of Head Wounds Without Fracture of the Bone.
Chapter LXXXIV.
I have already mentioned in the division on the treatment of wounds that it is appropriate to include this with the book, and here I will describe their treatment by hand and with medicines according to the necessary complements.
I say therefore, that wounds differ according to the cause by which they are made, and according to the place upon which the wound falls.
The causes by which wounds are often made are like a stone thrown: or a cut from a sword, or a knife: or a blow with a spear, or wood, or an arrow: and similar things from many objects.
Wounds that are made according to the parts of the body are such as a wound that falls on the head, or neck, or chest, or abdomen, or back: and similar ones from these members.
And I am describing the treatments of certain wounds in order to set down this reasoning and rule for other wounds as well.
And I will begin with simple head wounds: for the description of compound injuries will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
I say therefore.
When there is a simple wound in the head and it is not a fracture of the bone: consider then if it is from being struck by a stone or something similar, and now it has only broken the skin: and this is a large wound, and you fear for the patient's outcome with regard to a hot abscess: then hurry and immediately perform cephalic phlebotomy: and do not delay in doing so: and extract from his blood according to the extent of his strength: if there be nothing prohibiting phlebotomy, especially if little blood is coming out from the wound.
And let the phlebotomy be performed on the opposite side of the wounded part.
And let the patient beware of overeating, wine, and heavy foods.
But if something prohibits phlebotomy, then let the patient reduce intake from food, and do not approach meats nor wines.
And apply to the wound if it develops a hot abscess, a poultice infused in rose oil alone, or with wine that has an astringent quality.
But if you are free from a hot abscess, then apply to the wound if it is fresh with its own blood and has not been altered by the air: a powder which I will describe shortly. And if it has already been altered by the air, then apply some ointment to it until it heals.
But if the wound is large, or is from a cut by a sword or similar instrument: and its edges do not come together with powder, then join it with stitches as I will describe concerning stitching for wounds of the abdomen.
But if the wound is now exposed to the bone and hangs open, and there is no retention of its edges except with a small suspension: then cut it away.
Then treat the wound with medicines, and restore tough flesh in place of skin, and instruct the patient to nourish himself with foods that are nutritious, such as bread and boiled wheat, until he is well-fed: and similar things.
If you find putrefaction in the skin that does not adhere to the bone, then cut out all of the putrefied part and discard it; then treat the wound.
If there is an artery or vein from which blood flows in these wounds and it does not stop with medicines, then probe around the artery.
If you find it uncut, then cut it with a scalpel, or ligature it.
If necessity requires and what we have said does not suffice, then cauterize it until the bleeding stops.
Method of Preparing Flesh-Colored Powder.
Take one part of frankincense, two parts of dragon's blood, and three parts of unslaked lime: grind all of it thoroughly and sift it: then fill the wound with this mixture, and bind it tightly with bandages until it adheres well to the wound and coagulates with the blood.
Then cover it with powdered materials and leave it as is, without removing the dressing, so that it does not become an abscess.
For medicine is not removed from it until it is cured.
Then care for them with the remaining treatment until they are healed.
Concerning Wounds of the Neck.
Chapter LXXXV.
If a wound occurs on the neck, then there is no difference in treatment between it and a simple head wound.
If, however, a nerve or artery of the neck has already been cut: then if it is a nerve, there is no skill in its treatment except to avoid methods that cause strong styptics, such as zinc ore and zegi, and similar substances.
For they harm the nerves and contract them.
And do not place anything cold on the wound at all: for the substance of the nerves is cold, and its continuation is with the brain, which is higher than other members; and let what is used to treat it from medicines be mild, such as lime lota infused several times with sweet water or with rose oil, and tuthia, when washed also with sweet water: and other mineral stones in this manner, and moist ointments.
但如果伤口很大，那么就使用缝合：或者用粉末将其边缘紧密闭合。
然后治疗它，直到痊愈。
但如果伤口有深度，或者在其下部形成了一个脓肿聚集的凹陷部位，那么就在那个更低的位置穿刺它。
如果动脉已经在伤口中被切开，且其血液开始流出：那么就将其分离或绑紧，并结扎它；或者在必要时用烙铁处理它。
但如果已经切到了喉骨，或者整个切割但其他部分完好：那么用缝线将皮肤边缘与喉部的管状结构连接起来，并不要触碰喉部，而是将其保持在自然位置上，恢复其自然形状。
然后适当紧缩它，并让它休息几天。
然后用具有收敛和干燥效果的药膏治疗它，直到痊愈。
但如果伤口已经影响到骨头，那么检查它：如果其中含有骨碎片，取出所有你能取出来的碎片；对于无法处理的部分，让它自行腐败，直到伤口腐烂并自然分离减轻。
If the wound is recent, then powder the aforementioned powder upon it.
If an opening is seen in the wound and a fistula forms, then treat it as described in its respective chapter.
Chapter LXXXVI.
If wind (gas or air) exits from the wound when the patient breathes heavily, then you will know that the wound is fatal.
If the wound does not have great depth and is fresh with its own blood, then do not apply powder to it from the first hour, nor should you bandage it tightly so that the blood does not remain in its depth and return to the heart to kill the patient. Instead, apply an attracting ointment and loosen it twice a day.
If you do not have ointment available, then place old leather over the wound opening so that it absorbs what comes out from it due to moisture. And make sure the patient rests with the wound elevated so that any accumulation is drained.
If three days or more have passed since the wound occurred, and the patient does not experience spasms, nor a bad tremor of the heart, nor constriction in breathing, and you see that their other conditions are good: then you will know that the wound is safe.
Treat it with lint and other forms of care until it heals.
If, however, healing does not occur and it remains open, then you know that a fistula has been formed.
Therefore, treat it according to its chapter.
And if the wound is from a sword cut or knife, and it is simple on the surface of the chest or back: then treat it with stitching if it is large: or with powder if it is small.
But if it has already made an impression on the bone and pieces are broken off: then examine the wound and hurry to remove those fragments if they are separated.
But if they are not separated, then leave them alone until the wound becomes gangrenous, for their removal will be easier then.
For the treatment judgment of other accidental wounds in other limbs is the same as what we have said.
Concerning wounds of the abdomen, and the protrusion of the intestines, and their treatment.
Chapter LXXXVII.
The disruption that occurs to the abdomen is either great, medium, or small.
From a great disruption, the intestine sometimes protrudes, or even multiple sections of the intestines.
Therefore, there is a need to replace them, and the stitching required is more severe and difficult.
And even a small disruption becomes difficult to handle in a different manner.
It follows, then, that the replacement of them becomes more difficult if you do not hurry to return them to their proper place immediately: for they swell, open further, and become enlarged: hence, it becomes difficult to put them back.
Therefore, a median dissection is better for disruptions: since it does not make the reduction of the intestine difficult, as it does in these two types.
Know that the suture of the vein is according to four methods.
Two common sutures meet in the suture of the abdomen and in the suture of other wounds of the body: and two other sutures are specifically used for other wounds.
However, they are more proper with the suture of the abdomen: and I will tell you each one with an explanation and clarification. I say therefore, that when a wound is small, and something from the intestine protrudes from it, and it becomes difficult to reduce it: then this is due to one of two methods.
Either because of the smallness of the disruption, as we said: or because there is inflation in the intestine due to the cold air.
When therefore it is so, then you must warm it, so that you dip a sponge or a wet cloth in warm water alone.
Or boil it in water with sage, and bulrushes, and grain, and small sprigs along with the intestine, until the inflation is resolved.
Sometimes it is done with wine that has astringent properties: and it is better than water alone for resolving the inflammation.
When you see that the inflammation has resolved, then moisten the intestine with water in which dittany or mallows have been boiled.
For by that it is alleviated when a small thing enters.
If however its return is prevented after this treatment, then make a small incision with the instrument used to cut hemorrhoids.
And the first treatment is better when it is prepared than cutting: and there should be no forcing to cut after necessity and deficiency of instruments.
Let one part of it be twisted, sharp, and the other part not sharp, and let the tip not be as fine as that of a Spatumilis, but rather slightly blunt: and it is like a cautery, as you see.
When the wound enlarges and enters the intestine, it is necessary that it be reduced according to its natural form to its own proper place, if possible: for it is better.
When there is a wide incision in the lower part of the abdomen: then it is necessary to have the patient lie on their back, and place their legs higher than their head.
And if it is in the upper part of the abdomen: then place their head and chest higher than their lower parts.
And similarly if there is an incision in one of the two parts of the abdomen: then direct your attention and consideration always towards this, that the part where the wound is should be higher than the other part.
And thus it is necessary to administer this for large wounds and medium-sized wounds.
For small wounds, place it as you prepare it.
Then have a pious attendant present in your hands, who holds the entire wound with his hand: and bring together its lips.
Then show to the one who follows you the suture bit by bit: and this is the method of a common suture.
And you should take an awl or several awls according to the width of the wound.
Then leave from the edge of the wound a length equal to the width of the ring finger, that is, of the physician's: and insert one awl beyond which you pass thread through both ends of the skin, along with both ends of the sifac, as it lies beneath the skin on the inner side, until it emerges from the other side, and now you have joined together two ends of the skin, and two ends of the sifac: and thus four rows are formed.
Then tie with double thread around the needle several times from both sides simultaneously, until the two lips of the wound are properly joined.
Then leave the thickness of a finger as well, and insert another needle into it: then tie it with thread as you did with the first needle.
Do not cease doing this with as many needles as you need, until you complete the closure of the entire wound.
And the needles should be of medium thickness between thin and thick: for very thin needles pierce flesh too quickly, and thick ones are difficult to insert into the skin: therefore they should be of medium fineness and thickness.
And it is not appropriate to insert the needle too close together at both ends of the skin: so that the flesh does not be pierced too quickly and the wound does not open before it has healed, and they should not be stretched out too much with the suture, so that the healing of the wound is not prevented.
Then cut the extremities sharply so that they do not injure the patient during sleep: and place small plugs made of cloth around them on all sides, which hold the sharp ends: and leave them until you know that the wound has already healed.
And this type of stitch with needles is particularly suitable for small wounds.
Since one or two needles, or about that many, are sufficient for stitching them.
The second type of stitch is common for joining four ends together: two skin ends and two suture ends at once, using a needle with a thread wrapped around it that is equal in fineness and thickness.
Then when you have pierced with the needle these four ends, withdraw the needle from the side where you started, so that the thread falls back from the upper part of the wound: so that the stitch is like a seam in cloth by which pieces of cloth are sewn together, and place between each stitch an amount equal to the thickness of the smallest finger.
This type of stitch is known by people.
And with this stitch, I treated a wound that had occurred in a man's abdomen, who had been stabbed with a knife, and the tear of the wound was about one palm wide: and part of the intestine, about two palms long from the middle intestine, had protruded, and there was a tear in the middle of the abdomen.
I therefore returned it after his intestine had been outside the wound for twenty-four hours.
The wound therefore healed within about fifteen days: and I treated him, and he was cured: and he lived for many years after that, living according to his circumstances.
And the doctors had judged that it could not be healed.
And it was miraculous that I did not cure it with ointment.
Since I was in a place where ointment could not be found, nor anything from medicines.
So I placed an old cloth on the wound twice a day, and I frequently washed it with honey water until it was healed.
However, I will describe two types of stitches according to the account of the discourse.
And it is such that you start with an acute stitch: and insert the needle from the outer to the inner part.
When the needle penetrates the skin and moves along the length and width of the entire body: release the end if you did so on the side where you inserted the needle, and make it penetrate from one end to another from the inner part to the outer part on the other side.
When you have made it penetrate, then make it penetrate in this same end from the outer part to the inner: and release the end if you did so, which is on this side, and make the needle penetrate the other end from the inner part to the outer: and make it penetrate with your penetration as you do it at the end if you did so, which is on its side, until it penetrates throughout.
Then begin from this same side as well, and sew it with the end that is from the ifac on the other side, and withdraw the needle from the skin where it penetrated.
Then reduce it to that skin, and shape its extremity as if it were on the other side, with this extremity opposite; and extract it from the skin which is on its part, and do this once, and again: and do this after one another, until it has been entirely shaped according to that example.
And the goal of this suturing is that the seams of the skins should be like the natural seams where the skins are joined: so that you make one shape at a time from one side of the skin’s edge: and let it lie aside in turn from the other side, until you complete it.
The second type of proper suture, which Gale named.
This description is given so that it should be done according to the likeness by which certain surgeons join them, such that they bring together every part to its corresponding counterpart by nature: and they apply one extremity as if it were to another extremity of its own, and an opposite extremity to another opposite extremity.
And that is done as I tell you.
You must pierce the opposite extremity near to you from the outer part with a needle, and make it penetrate to the inner side: and let both extremities lie as if they were ready to be joined.
Then rotate the needle and make it penetrate from the outer part to the inner side in both extremities as if they were ready to be joined, that is, on both sides.
Then rotate both extremities, and make them penetrate from the inner to the outer part, into the two opposite extremities which are on the opposite side.
And this method of stitching is better than the common and easy stitch, and it is a stitch whose predecessor has been recalled.
This is therefore the statement of Galen as well.
And some said.
The stitching of the abdomen is corrected with two needles.
Which means, insert one thread into both: start by inserting the needle from what is near you and make it penetrate all the way to the other side, following the stitching of those who ensure equal layers of tissue.
And you should know that when the rupture is in the middle of the abdomen, then its stitching is more difficult than that of other parts of the abdomen.
The judgment of the treatment of the wound is the same as that of other wounds.
Which means, when you attend to a fresh wound with its blood before the air has altered it, and you return the intestine to its place and set it properly, then apply powder of incarnate root.
If the air has already altered the wound, then apply some ointments that are present to you until they produce pus, and let the threads fall out, and allow it to heal as it will.
Then treat it as you would treat other wounds until it heals.
But if you do not have medicines at hand, then apply old lint as soon as it begins to produce pus, and change it twice a day, as I taught you, until it heals.
But if you fear that the wound may affect the principal limbs in case of injury, then it is necessary to soak a soft piece of wool in oil of moderate heat, or in rose oil: and place it around the areas between the thighs and under the armpits.
If he feels pain, pricking, or putrefaction in his intestines (for this often happens), then administer an astringent, black, warm enema to him: especially if the putrefaction has already reached the intestine and there is an opening penetrating as far as its cavity.
And know that what comes from the large intestine is easier to heal: and what comes from the small intestine is harder to heal.
However, the intestine called the Jejunum does not heal at all from a wound that occurs in it: and this is due to its multitude of veins and the size of them, and because of the fineness of its body, and the closeness of its nature to nerves.
But if what comes out of the wound is pus, and you encounter it fresh: reduce it according to your method, by which you equally reduce the intestines.
But if time has passed and it has become green or black: then you must constrict it with a thread above the place that has turned black from it, so that bleeding does not occur.
For in pus there are veins and arteries.
Then cut what is beyond that ligament, and place two ends of thread hanging from the lower part of the wound outside it: so that the pull on you may be lightened, and its extraction in the case of a boil, and the discharge of pus from the wound.
¶ Recall of the wound that occurred in the intestine.
When a rupture occurs in the intestine and it is small, then it is possible for it to be restored in some people: because I have seen someone who was wounded in his abdomen with a lance thrust, and the wound was from the right side of the stomach, and the wound became old and formed a fistula, and there was discharge and flatulence coming from it.
I therefore provided treatment until I was no longer confident in its healing: nor did I cease to care for it carefully until he was healed and the place had become firm.
After I saw the place already healed and firm, I was concerned about the patient, fearing that something bad might happen in his abdomen: but nothing bad happened to him from that.
And he remained in better health, eating and drinking, and engaging in sexual activity, and taking baths, and exercising as usual.
And some experienced practitioners have said that when a wound occurs in the intestine and it is small, then it must be treated in this manner.
And you should take ants with large heads.
Then bring together the two lips of the wound, and place one of those ants that have an open mouth on top of the two lips of the wound.
When it therefore catches on it, and he clenches his mouth, cut off his head, for it adheres and is not released.
Then place another ant near the first one, and do not stop placing ants after each other according to the quantity of the entire wound.
Then reduce it, and heal the wound.
For those heads remain attached in the intestine until the intestine is nourished and healed, and no harm comes to the patient thoroughly. And now it is possible to ligature the intestine even with a fine thread: which is taken from the intestine of an animal and attached to it after it is introduced into the needle.
And you should take the end of this thread from the intestine and remove much of the flesh from it.
Then tie a fine linen thread wrapped around its end.
Then insert that thread into the needle, and heal with it the intestine.
Then reduce it to the site of the injury. And this method of suturing with ants and intestine is nothing but according to the way of trust and hope.
Know that a large and wide wound, especially if it is in one of the thin intestines: then there is no remedy except for suturing, nor is its healing possible at all.
§ On the Treatment of Abscesses and Fistulas.
Chapter LXXXVIII.
Know that every wound or abscess when it becomes old and chronic, and turns into a sore that does not heal, and continually discharges pus, and cannot be removed: then it is generally called in whatever part of the body it may be a Fistula, and we call it Zuchemen.
And a fistula indeed is in truth a filtered hard white knot: with which there is no pain, it has the concavity of a bird's feather: and because of this some call it Risati, that is, feather.
And at certain times it is moist, which discharges pus.
And perhaps the moisture may split open at certain times.
And sometimes this moisture is abundant, and at other times it is scarce: and it is thick, and it is thin.
And I have already mentioned in the division, then when I said wounds, that every sore which does not heal, nor does flesh grow in it, is none other than due to one of nine causes.
One of these causes is either due to a lack of blood in the body, or because the blood is bad quality, or because there is hard flesh between it and above its lips preventing the growth of new flesh, or because there is much dirt and filth, or because the sore itself is putrid and the matter expelled from it is of poor quality, or because the treatment applied is inappropriate, or because corruption falling into the region is a type of pestilence, or due to local properties in the region as happened in Caesaraugusta: where there is difficult digestion of illnesses, and healing of abscesses is delayed by nature, or because there is one bone, or a number of bones within it.
And now I have shown all these causes and signs of them, and the treatments for them with medicines in the division: and it is necessary here to make you know the treatment of fistulas and tumors, which is done through a way of operation with the hand.
Therefore, you should know that fistulas occur in all parts of the body.
For there are fistulas that reach the major veins and arteries, or nerves, or windpipe; or to the intestines, or to the bladder, or to any of the ribs: or to any of the vertebrae of the back, or to any complex joint such as the hand or foot: and among them are those that go near the main limb and similar parts.
Therefore, any of these fistulas that occur in this manner are from illnesses difficult to heal, and they do not receive treatment, and dealing with them is a matter of labor and ignorance.
If there is any fistula whose depth does not reach the places I mentioned: and you hope and trust in its treatment, and wish to understand it, then take a probe of air or iron, if the fistula runs straight, and investigate it with it.
但如果瘘管呈曲折状，那么用细铅探针来探测它。
因为铅以其轻巧的身体可以轻松漂浮，并且可以围绕曲折弯曲。
如果瘘管有多处开口，你无法用探针在其上进行标记。
因此，从这些开口中选择一个进行灌肠治疗。
For the moisture with which you enema him goes towards other openings and runs out from them.
Then inquire carefully how it is possible for you to know whether there is a hole or a nerve there: whether the fistula's concavity is long or short; whether the fistula has many openings. Stand over all of this with your utmost strength, questioning the patient and discovering pain by compressing the area with your hand, and similar signs and causes that happen to the abscess.
Therefore, when you stand over all of these things with true attention, proceed to treatment with confidence. Consider whether the fistula is near and visible, or if it is in a safe location far from joints, nerves, arteries, veins, or any of the places I have mentioned to you. Then cut the fistula as described in my narration, remove what is inside through filtration and by taking out corrupted flesh that has grown at its opening, whether it be flesh or a polypus, and similar growths. Treat it until it heals.
但如果瘘管深度较深且呈直线状，那么你应该尽可能深入地切割它。
然后清除所有腐败的肉组织。
然后用包有锐利药物的丝线进行处理，并将其插入你用铁具探查到的瘘管凹陷处。多次重复这个过程，直到锐利的药物腐蚀掉所有残留在瘘管凹陷处的腐败组织。
然后用能够生成健康肉芽的药膏治疗它，直到它完全愈合。
If it is not healed by that, then cauterize it as we have described.
If the cause of the fistula is a bone, and you are certain of this: then search for it, and cut it as I have described to you; if nothing such as a vein, nerve, or main limb prevents you, as we said.
If a bone is exposed to you and there is some corruption and blackening in it: then scrape it until all the corruption is removed.
Then treat it with something that promotes healing and flesh growth until it is healed.
If it does not heal and continues to discharge pus as before: then you will know that you have not completely removed all the corruption.
Examine it again carefully, and thoroughly clean and treat it with your utmost effort.
Then restore it.
If it heals, that is good; and if not, then you will know that the corruption is deep within the body where you could not reach.
Therefore, it is not within your skill to treat it further, except to leave it to nature.
If the corrupted bone is small and it is possible for you, remove it with fine forceps that are suitable for it.
If there are many bones, then carefully remove all of them, and do not leave any of them out with your effort.
If the moisture and tissues hinder you and there is no risk or error in cutting them: then cut through those moist tissues and any flesh present, and free the bones.
If you do not have the preparation to remove bones at that time, then place something over the wound that will cause it to rot; and leave it until what is around those bones of flesh and moisture rots.
And guard the wound so that it does not heal.
And bind the section which you cut during your operation.
Instead, place over it, if you fear, cotton dipped in ground sulfur with oil: or cotton dipped in Egyptian ointment, or some green ointment.
For when those moist parts rot and the bones separate from them, the removal of them is lightened, and their extraction is facilitated.
但如果是一块大的骨头，如腿骨或髋骨，以及类似这些的骨头，并且从它腐烂的部分很大：那么用刮刀将其彻底刮除，直到那黑色和腐烂的部分被去除。
Then restore the wound.
但如果腐烂的部分很大，且腐烂已经蔓延到骨头的髓腔，那么必须锯开它，并将其完全切开直到达到腐烂的部分：然后治疗它，直到它愈合。 我告诉你一个发生在一个人腿上的案例，称为zuken：你可以将其作为例子和指导来帮助你的手术操作。
有一个大约三十岁的年轻男子，他的腿上出现了疼痛，原因是体内深处的问题，即从内部开始的，直到物质到达腿部并形成了一个大的脓肿：并且这不是由外部原因造成的。
Therefore, a long time passed with the error of the physicians until the abscess was opened, and many materials accumulated with it.
And the treatment was postponed until the leg became ulcerated, and many openings were formed in it, which all discharged pus and bodily fluids.
A multitude of physicians treated him for about two years, and there was no skilled practitioner among them in the art of hands, until I was called and saw his leg, and the materials that were flowing from those openings in great quantity: and his entire body had already wasted away, and its color was citron.
I inserted a probe into one of the openings, and the probe reached the cavity.
Then I examined all the openings and found that they connected to each other from all parts of the leg. I acted quickly and cut around one of those openings until I exposed a part of the bone: and I found it corrupted; it was already decayed, blackened, and rotten, and perforated until it had penetrated to the marrow.
I removed what was exposed to me and prepared it from the corrupted bone.
And I separated what was not part of the bone except for that corruption which I cut away and removed.
And I had now eradicated it.
Then I applied the restoration of the wound with healing medicines over a long period.
And it did not heal.
Then I attempted its restoration.
And it was not restored.
Then I restored it with medicines, and it healed quickly and was consolidated: and this repetition in its operation and section was not necessary, except due to the disposition of the patient's weakness, and his lack of tolerance, and my fear for him regarding death: for he suffered fainting spells at every hour from an excess of evacuation.
He therefore healed completely: and flesh grew in the place of the bone, and a good disposition was formed in his body, and his strength returned: and he resumed his usual activities: and walking caused him no harm at all.
If, however, a protruding bone in a part of the body is already fractured: then you must cut it according to this method: and it is as follows: take a ligature and tie it at the end of the protruding bone: and instruct someone to pull it upwards: and place another ligament made of coarser wool over the first ligament. Then bind it above the flesh that is near the bone: and extend its end so as to pull the flesh downward: and you expose the flesh at the place you wish to cut so that the blade does not injure the flesh.
Place a stick or board under the lower bone appropriately: for when you do this, it does not prevent you from cutting away the corrupted flesh.
And it is necessary that there be a groove above the corrupted area for a little while, so that the corruption does not appear in a hollow of the bone: and it should not appear to the senses and compel another person to make the groove instead. If the bone is corrupted and is not prominent, but rather its part continues with another part: and the corruption is in the middle of it or in one of its parts: then uncover the flesh from all sides entirely.
Then place a stick below.
Then cut it from the first side where the corruption is, until the groove continues on the other side: and let the groove run parallel to the corruption for a little while, as we have said.
If the corruption is in the joint, cut open the corrupted joint, and groove the bone where it continues on the other side.
If the corruption is in the connection of two joints, then there is no skill involved except scraping it away.
If the corruption is in the web of the hand or in the web of the foot: then the task in this case is very difficult.
However, you must examine how the corruption appears to you.
And you scrape it away, and clean it according to whatever arrangement is possible for you, and with whatever skill suits you: when a vein or nerve does not make it difficult for you.
And you should know that there are many cutting instruments and saws for cutting these bones, according to the position of the bones, their preparation, their thickness, fineness, size, curvature, hardness, and porosity.
Therefore, it is necessary to prepare an appropriate instrument for each type of procedure for that particular operation.
And you should know that these procedures will indicate to you the type of instrument you need when you have studied them for a long time.
And knowledge of the methods of this art is a testimony to the methods of diseases: then you will find for yourself what is suitable from the instruments for every illness.
Shape of the Saw.
Shape of another Saw.
Shape of Another Saw.
Shape of a Different Saw.
This depiction of the shape of the saw should be properly done. Let its upper part be curved, its sharpness made of iron: and let its handle be made of boxwood, and be properly shaped like a pyramid.
Shape of the Razor for Joints.
Let the head of this razor be in the shape of the head of a star-headed nail: and let its points be in the shape of the points of an elischetfegi.
And it is not appropriate unless they are rubbed with it when the joints are damaged, or there is a large and wide opening.
The form of the larger razor.
The form of the medium razor.
The form of the broad razor.
The form of the razor with a concavity.
The form of another fine razor.
The form of another curved-end razor.
The form of the small, fine, delicate razor.
The form of the razor with which bones are cut.
The form also of the large razor.
This is similar to a file, and its end is like a saw: it is shown in many places due to the reason of bones.
The form of the razor that is suitable for the purpose of what is perforated from bones.
Its end is triangular, with sharp points.
It is made from India.
And similarly, all that we have mentioned should be made from razors, knives, and scissors.
Concerning the cutting of extremities and the sawing of bones.
Chapter LXXXIX.
The extremities become putrid either from an external cause or an internal cause.
When you have treated that corruption with medicine and the treatment does not help, and you see the corruption affecting a limb that is not irritated by anything: then it is necessary to cut off that limb as far as the corruption extends, so that the patient may escape death or a greater evil due to the loss of the limb.
And the sign that this has occurred is that the limb turns black until it seems to have been burned by fire or to rot after turning black, until that corruption spreads to what follows that limb and creeps over the entire body.
Hasten with the incision if this is the case, and similarly if the cause of the corruption is from being struck by some venomous creatures such as a sea scorpion, viper, rattlesnake, or similar.
If the corruption or strike is at the end of a finger, then cut off the finger and do not give the corruption time to spread to the rest of the hand.
And similarly if it happens on the hand, then cut it off from the root of the wrist, and do not give the corruption time to spread until it reaches the forearm.
And if it invades there, then cut the arm at the elbow joint. If the corruption spreads and you see it around the elbow: then death is imminent for the patient.
And in addition to that treatment, the amount of care given is also important.
And do the same for the foot when corruption invades a toe; then cut it at one joint. And if it attacks the ball of the foot, then cut off the entire foot.
But if it ascends to the knee, then cut the leg at the joint of the knee.
If the corruption has already advanced above the knee, then there is no skill in it except to give up and leave the sick person to death.
And the method of cutting or sawing a limb is such that you should clamp the ligament below where you wish to cut, and clamp another ligament above the place.
And let the assistant extend one ligament downward: and let the assistant extend another ligament upward.
And you should separate the flesh that is between the two ligaments with a spatula until all the flesh is exposed.
Then it should be cut or sawed.
And it is necessary to place linen cloth around all parts so that the saw does not touch healthy areas: and additional injury should not be inflicted on the patient, nor should a hot abscess occur.
But if bleeding occurs internally while you are working, then cauterize the area quickly: or apply certain powders that stop the blood.
Then return to your treatment until it is complete.
Then bind the wounded limb with a suitable bandage, and care for it until it heals.
And I tell you what happened to a man with his foot, the same thing that I am telling you.
This is because blackness occurs in his foot, with a burning that resembles the combustion of fire: and that corruption first happens in his toe, until it begins to affect the entire foot.
Therefore, the man himself intervened after seeing the corruption affect his member with its severity, which he felt from the pain and burning: and it affected him at the joint, and he was healed.
And after a long time had passed, that same corruption happened to his middle finger. He came to me, and I tried to recover the excess by placing medicines on his hand after cleansing his body: but the excess did not return to its proper place, and it began to spread to another finger: until the corruption started affecting his entire hand.
He called upon me to amputate his hand: and I refused, hoping that the excess fluid would return to its proper place: and I also feared for his life if I were to cut his hand.
For the man's strength was great in bearing the situation.
After losing hope in me, he returned to his own land: and came back to me because he had hurried and amputated his entire hand: and he healed.
And I have not brought this story forward except to be of assistance regarding what falls under this kind of illness: and to serve as an indication by which it may be recognized and acted upon.
Regarding the treatment of sinuses, and the quality of enemas with medicines.
Chapter XC.
When an abscess occurs in certain fleshy members and extends over a period of time until it forms a collection of pus: then it bursts or is perforated, and what is inside it comes out as pus, leaving an empty space like a vessel: and the skin that is above it becomes thin like cloth: and if it does not reach its final stage of corruption nor spreads to the bone, nor to the nerve, nor to the ligament, it deserves to be called a Sinus: but if it extends over time until the corruption spreads to any of these members, then it is called a Fistula or zuken.
And the treatment for it is to cut away all that skin as it peels off: and especially when it has become thin like cloth: and you can be confident that it will not adhere to the place because of its corruption.
But if you hope that the skin will adhere and it does not reach that final stage of corruption as a result: and if there is thickness in the skin from flesh, then treat it with enemas: and proceed as if treating a Sinus.
Then if it is large and the pus that comes out of it has a foul odor: then administer an enema with Egyptian medicine, which consists of equal parts of vinegar, oil, and zinziberi (ginger), mixed together in a container: and boil them over fire until the medicine turns red: and becomes as thick as honey.
Then take what you need from it: and dissolve it with water and honey, and administer the enema with this for the Sinus: and plug its opening, and leave the medicine inside for a duration of two hours.
Then remove it after expressing it: do this for so many days until the sinus is cleansed and the odor removed.
And sometimes it is cleansed with water mixed with ashes, when you do not have this medicine at hand: take the ashes of vine wood or oak wood and mix them with water.
Then cleanse it and use it for enemas until you are confident that the sinus is now cleansed.
If the patient cannot tolerate Egyptian medicine or ash water, then give an enema with water and honey to which a little of crushed zinc ore has been mixed.
Or give an enema with honey and wine mixed together, since honey has the property of cleansing and washing, and wine helps the sinus adhere, especially when the wine has a surplus of astringency and dryness.
When you do this several times and are confident that the corruption in the sinus has been removed: then give an enema with something that promotes flesh growth.
And you should take some diascordium from a plaster and dissolve it with rose oil and astringent wine: or give an enema with certain medicines and other ointments whose properties I have written about in the chapter on ointments.
If the opening of the sinus is narrow and does not allow the enema tube to enter: then slightly expand it with iron: or apply licorice wrapped in Egyptian ointment or basilicon ointment until it expands.
And similarly, if the opening is also too wide, then close its edges with stitches: and leave it open only enough for the enema to enter without adding more.
And similarly, if the opening from which the pus flows is raised upwards: then cut it in a lower place that is within it, so that the pus can flow from it downwards: for when pus is compressed in the depth of the sinus, it prevents flesh from being generated there.
If it is not possible for you to cut the sinus around its lower part as you wish: then try to prepare the limb in such a way that the pus can flow from it with ease according to how it is prepared for you.
Try to ensure that nothing from the pus is retained within it at all: and apply medicines that are used for healing, which are appropriate for what you wish.
And extend them over a linen cloth.
And let the cloth be of such quantity that it covers the entire sinus.
Then cut with forceps directly at the opening of the sinus, making a hole slightly larger than the opening of the sinus.
Then apply a layer of soft ointments on another cloth according to the size of the hole: and place it above it at a distance from the opening of the sinus, so that the exit of pus is eased: and do not remove the large cloth until once after several days.
The cloth that is placed over the opening of the sinus is the one you remove at every hour to allow what accumulates from the pus to exit: and so that you know whether what flows out from it is much or little: or digested or undigested.
And while doing this, again examine the location of the sinus itself to see if the patient feels pain there, or if there is no pain, and whether there is an abscess present, or if there is no abscess.
When therefore your treatment proceeds thus, and you see the material that comes out over the opening of the sinus, then you know that the sinus is already adhering or approximates to adhesion: then dissolve it in the morning, or on the third day: and when you open the wound, then change another cloth, and renew the ointment. If, however, a thin fluid comes out from the sinus after a long period of time, then do not despair of its adherence, for its healing is approaching, since there are people who delay the generation of flesh in their wounds, and among them there are those who act contrary to this.
If, however, indigested pus comes out from the sinus after many days, then you know that the sinus does not adhere.
If the adherence of the sinus is delayed and its condition is prolonged: then add to the drying medications, but let the doctors ensure that the medicines are moist in their substance and dry in their power: such as ointment dyafinicon, when an excess addition is made from zegi.
And from the most recent treatment method, it is to take ointment dyafinicon and dissolve it with rose oil, and sprinkle over it an equal amount of old wine by substance.
Then prepare it with that, and use it.
And now it acts similarly to this method when you do not have ointment dyafinicon at hand; use honey instead, and boil it until it thickens, then use it.
Or take myrrh, aloes, and frankincense: grind all of it, and powder it over honey while it is on the fire.
Then place a bandage over the cloth, and secure it to the armpit. And soak thread in honey that you have boiled until thickened: and sprinkle powdered medicine on it, and place it over the cloth, and secure it.
And sometimes aristolochia longa is administered there, and roots of the celestial lily, which is a type of lily, and flour of the herb, and centaury.
Use them simple or in combination, grind them, and sieve them: and mix the powder with the honey as I have described, and use it.
If the condition of the armpit persists and is not cured by this treatment: then you should know that there is corruption deep within it: either it has already affected the bones, or other hard parts of the body, or the ligaments. Then treat it with the method for Fistulas as previously described. Regarding the treatment of Panaritium and worn nails, and the cutting of an added finger, and sectioning.
Chapter XC I.
Panaritium is an abscess that arises under the nail of the thumb of the hand or foot: and it may also arise in other fingers.
When the condition persists and is neglected in its treatment, and it becomes an abscess with heat: or it corrupts and emits pus until it destroys the root of the nail: and perhaps it corrupts the entire nail, and perhaps the corruption reaches the bone, until there is a foul odor: and the end of the finger becomes swollen, and its color turns dark.
When you treat it with the method we described in the division and it does not improve: then you must cut with a knife all the excess that remains from the nail.
Then cauterize the wound after that.
For cauterization is very beneficial.
If the bone is sound and the nail is also healthy, but empty spaces under the nail are pressing on the flesh toward the interior and begin to irritate it and injure it: then you should place a thin piece of lead under the angle of the nail that presses on the flesh, and push it upwards: and cut away the flesh with ease, and apply medicines that burn and corrode until all of it is removed.
Then treat it with ointments until it heals.
If the corruption has already spread to the bone, then you must cut out that bone and remove it: for it will never heal while the corrupted bone remains.
If you see the corrosion and corruption spreading to the finger, then cut it at one of the joints, as was previously described.
Then treat it until it heals.
If the nail is worn down or receives a blow and there is severe pain in it, then you should first bleed the patient.
Then dry the nail with an acute cross-sectional piece of Spatumil from top to bottom.
And be careful that the cut does not reach the flesh under the nail, for doing so will cause severe pain to the patient and will result in the addition of new flesh in that place.
Then treat the area with something that alleviates pain.
However, the extra finger that is born on some people's hands may be entirely fleshy; and sometimes there are bones in them, and sometimes there is a nail in it: and some of them are born at the root joint, or their birth is in certain nodes of the finger.
Therefore, the one that is born at certain nodes of the finger is not moved: and the one that is born near the joint of the finger may be movable.
Therefore, for those among them that are fleshy, cutting it is easy.
Which means, cut it at its root with a broad Spatumilis knife.
However, the treatment for one whose origin is at the root joint is difficult.
Therefore, abstain from cutting it.
In the one that is born on the finger at the last node, then you must cut the flesh around it with a round incision down to the bone.
Then锯断骨头使用合适的夹板。注意，这句话的拉丁文原文中“serra”通常指的是某种切割工具而非夹板，可能是用于描述一种特定的手术操作。更准确的翻译应该是：
Then treat it until it is healed.
However, the fusion that occurs between fingers is often present either from birth, that is, it exists at birth, or results from the healing of a wound, burning by fire, and similar causes.
Therefore, you must cut that fusion until the fingers return to their natural form.
Then place between them licorice or cloths soaked in rose oil to prevent them from fusing too quickly and keep them separated; or place a thin sheet of lead between them until the area heals as needed.
And similarly, if a fusion occurs between certain fingers and the palm, then cut that fusion according to what is prepared and fits the shape of the limb.
¶ On the Incision for a Defect.
Chapter XCII.
Veins are wrapped, thick, and full of excess melancholic humors that occur in many parts of the body: and most often these affect the legs, especially the legs of those who walk and work and carry loads.
Therefore, you should administer body purging with black bile several times with strong purging.
Then let the physician bleed the patient from the basilic vein.
However, the treatment of these conditions with iron is according to two methods.
One method is to cut them and extract black blood.
And another method is to lift the vein and extract it entirely.
But its division is according to this method.
First, apply hot water abundantly to the leg with a syringe until the thick, foul blood is dissolved.
Then bind the patient's leg tightly from the upper part of the hip to the lower part of the knee with a bandage.
Then cut the vein in one place, or two, or three with a wide incision.
Then let the blood until the quantity that you see is sufficient and which the patient can tolerate.
After that, bind it: and instruct him to abstain from foods generating black bile: and repeat the evacuation and bloodletting when the veins are full, and if this harms the patient.
And its lifting out is according to this method.
Shave the patient's leg if there are many hairs on it.
Then immerse him in a bath: or apply hot water to his leg with a syringe until it becomes red and the veins swell: or exercise him vigorously if a bath is not available, until the limb warms up.
Then dry the skin directly along the vein's course lengthwise: or at its end near the knee, or at its lower part near the heel.
Then open the skin with hooks, and strip the vein from every part until it appears to the eye: and at its appearance, you will see it turn from red to black.
When it comes out of the skin, you will see it white as if it were a cord.
Then insert the hook under it and lift it up until it comes out of the skin; suspend it with a blunt hook gently.
Then dry another section near that section, about three digits away.
Then strip the skin from the upper part of the vein until it appears.
Then lift it up with hooks as you did before, and suspend it with another hook as you did initially.
Then dry another section, or several sections, if you need to do so.
Then lift it up and cut it at the last section near the heel.
Then remove it to the section above it.
And do this until you remove it from the upper section, or the highest of all sections, until it comes out completely; then cut it.
但如果它不听从你，无法取出和提起：那么插入带有坚固双线的针，并将其绑住并取出；或者在它下面插入钩子：然后转动你的手到每一部分，直到完全取出。
And be careful that it is not cut.
For if it is cut, it becomes difficult for you to lift it up strongly, and harm enters upon the sick person from it.
When you have therefore extracted it completely, then place on the wound site wool soaked in wine and rose oil, or just oil, and take care of it until it heals.
If the vine is contracted, having a curvature with winding parts and not as we said straight, then you must cut along its entire length of curvature and at the places where it is wound.
Then suspend it with hooks until you lift it up entirely: and be careful at your cut not to injure a vein or wound on it, for it will become difficult for you to lift or extract it.
Therefore, preserve your prudence.
The Form of Treatment to Heal the Vine.
The Form of a Blind Hook.
It does not have a curve like other hooks, nor does it have a sharp tip so as not to wound the vein: and it has a pliable thickness, gentle in nature: for if it were delicate, its delicacy would cut the vein. Rather, it should have an excess of thickness, as we said.
On the Extraction of the Thigh Vein. Chapter XCIII.
This vein is generated in the legs in warm lands, such as Alizegi and the land of Arabs, and in dry, warm lands with little fertility, that is, where no grass or tree grows.
And perhaps it is generated in other places of the body besides the legs.
And its generation is from putrefaction which occurs beneath the skin, just as snakes and worms like ascarids occur within bodies, and worms are generated between the skin and flesh.
And the sign of the beginning of this Vene (likely referring to an illness or condition) is that a violent inflammation occurs in the leg.
Then the area is let blood from or vesicated.
Then the Vene begins to emerge from the place of the vesication, as if it were the root of a plant or an animal.
When therefore the end of it appears from there, then you should wrap a piece of lead over it, whose weight should be one Keil drachma, up to two drachmas and tie it: and let the lead hang from the leg.
Whenever therefore something emerges from it to the exterior, wrap it in lead and tie it.
If it extends too much, then cut part of it and wrap the remainder.
And do not cut it off at the root before it has emerged entirely.
For if you cut it, it contracts and enters the flesh: and it causes an abscess, putrefaction in the place, and a bad ulcer.
Therefore, it is necessary to treat it gently and extract it gradually until it comes out completely from its origin, and nothing of it remains in the body: and this Vene emerges in some people to a length of five palms and ten.
And now it has come to me, for a woman came out from twenty palms.
If it happens to you during your time of treatment: then insert a probe into the opening, and pierce it with a long hollow instrument until everything that is inside from the material is evacuated: and apply poultices to the area with medicines for several days. Then treat it as you would treat an abscess.
And this vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears at the joint of the foot or on the foot itself: and it has many openings from which branches emerge.
Therefore, treat it as we said in the division, and along with what was mentioned before.
Regarding the treatment of worms generated under the skin, and it is called Bovine Disease.
Chapter XCIV.
This disease is called Bovine Disease in a certain place among us: because it often happens to cattle, and it is a small worm that is born between the skin and flesh.
And it moves throughout the body, ascending and descending: and its presence is felt through the sensation during its movement from one member to another, until it breaks out wherever it does so in the skin and emerges.
And its generation is from the putrefaction of certain humors.
Just as worms and snakes, that is, earthworms and roundworms, occur in the belly.
And it is feared because of its maliciousness.
Because when it goes into the body, and rises to the head, and reaches a place: then perhaps it opens there, and exits, and destroys the eye: and this happens often.
Therefore, when you wish to treat it and extract it, then it is not done except during its movement, and when it becomes apparent to the senses.
Therefore, you must bind what is above it and what is below it with a strong ligature.
Then dry the area above it, and extract it.
If it penetrates deep into the flesh, and you cannot find it: then apply a cautery with fire to the area until it dies.
And what is more feared is its corruption, which corrupts the eye, as we have said. If you see it has already reached the head near the eye, then bind below it above the eyebrow with a good ligature.
Then dry the area above it, and extract it.
And the patient must use cleansing of their body with medicines that dissolve foul and putrid humors.
And he should beware of foods that generate putrefaction.
¶ On the incision concerning the illness of Nakir.
Chapter XCV.
This illness is called Nakir in our land: and it is a pain that occurs in certain limbs, then it shifts from one limb to another.
And I myself have already seen it, as I tell you.
I was called to a sick woman in certain villas.
And he exposed his arm, and I saw a small swelling in the vein of the forearm.
And after I had stayed for one hour, I saw a swelling move with heat, like a worm crawling, ascending to his shoulder faster than can be imagined: it was like living silver as it moved from place to place.
The pain therefore receded from that place and fixed itself in the shoulder.
Then I sat for one hour, and it moved through the rest of the body until it reached the other arm.
Then he told me that it revolved throughout his entire body, as I saw.
I was amazed at the speed with which it changed from one limb to another.
And I myself had never before seen this illness with my own eyes in such a manner as this.
Nevertheless, I have seen many who experience pain moving from one limb to another; and I have not witnessed it with my own eyes as I did in the woman.
And I do not think it is anything other than because the woman was one of those who are from dry-bodied villages with exposed veins; thus, this windiness moving about appears to the senses.
And it is necessary that they do not appear in this manner in those who are delicate and have moist bodies with hidden veins.
When you wish to treat it, and the patient feels pain: then if it is apparent to your eye, as we said, then apply astringents above it, and below it quickly: and cut above it until that trapped wind escapes: and cauterize the place.
But if you do not see it with your own eyes: then treat it with body shaking, and with what expels wind, and soothes it with foul-smelling pills, and pills of serapin, and similar remedies.
Paragraph on the Extraction of Arrows.
Chapter XCVI. Arrows differ according to their types, and according to the places where they fall from the body.
However, their diversity is as follows: there are those which have large and small points: and concave, and blunt.
And among them are those which have three angles.
And there are those among them which have tongues.
And there are those among them which have barbs.
However, those that depend on the limbs in which they fall are in two ways.
Either the members are from the main concave parts, such as the brain, heart, liver, lung, kidneys, intestines, bladder, and similar organs.
When an arrow falls into any of these parts and signs of death appear to you, which I will tell you about later, then you must avoid extracting that arrow from them, for death follows it in the one where it is, in many cases.
And when you do not see these bad signs, and the arrow is not hidden deep in the body, then remove it, and treat the wound.
For when an arrow falls on the head and penetrates the bone and exits through the soft part above the brain, the following signs occur: violent headaches, scotoma (loss of vision), vertigo, redness in the eyes, swelling, redness of the tongue, spasms, confusion of thought, and vomiting of bile.
And perhaps blood may exit from the nose or ears.
And speech may be impaired, and the voice destroyed.
And a white moist substance like gruel exits from the wound site.
And something similar to the moisture of flesh exits from it.
If you see these signs, then refrain from treating the wound, and remove the arrow if it does not exit on its own.
The signs when an arrow falls on the heart are: it is near the left nipple, and the person feels as if it were fixed in a solid part, not in an empty space.
And the arrow may move like the motion of a pulse, and black blood flows from the wound.
And it is followed by coldness in the extremities, cold sweat, and fainting.
Therefore, know that death is certainly approaching.
And the sign when an arrow wounds the lung is the exit of frothy blood from the wound: and the glands that follow the neck become abscessed, and the color of the patient changes.
And he exhales a great, deep breath: and seeks the attraction of cold air.
If an arrow falls on the tent in the breast: then it is near the small ribs: and there is a great gasp with severe pain, with sighing: and all the shoulder members are moved.
And if an arrow falls on the stomach, then perhaps something undigested will come out of the wound with the food.
And if an arrow falls on the abdomen and is embedded there: something comes out of the wound, either feces, or a twisted part, or an intestine that is already ruptured.
There is therefore no hope for his cure, nor for the removal of the arrow.
If an arrow falls on the bladder, and urine comes out: and something proceeds from it to the outside, and the pain is greater than before: then you know that it is fatal.
The remaining limbs, such as the face, neck, throat, shoulder blades, back muscles, collarbone, hip, leg, and similar parts of the body are healed according to various conditions: when the arrow does not encounter an artery or nerve: and the arrow is not poisonous.
And I tell you what I have seen about these arrows, so that it may indicate to you regarding your treatment.
It happened that an arrow fell on the tear duct of a man's eye, at the root of his nose.
I therefore extracted the arrow from the other side, under the fat of his ear: and he was healed, and no harm came to his eye.
And I removed another arrow from a Jew, which had fallen into the fat of his eye under the lower eyelid: and the arrow was already hidden, and I only followed it to a small part of its tip, which adheres to its wooden shaft: and it was a large arrow from Turkish bows, with soft iron, in which there are no fletchings.
Therefore, the Jew recovered, and no harm came to his eye. And I removed another arrow from the throat of a Christian.
And it was an Arabian arrow, and this one has fletchings.
Therefore, I cut above it between two cartilages: and it was already submerged in his throat.
I carefully worked with it until I removed it: and the Christian recovered.
And I removed an arrow from a man who had it embedded in his abdomen: and we thought that he would die from it.
After thirty days had passed and there was no change in his condition due to the arrow, I cut above the arrow: and I manipulated it, and removed it: and he recovered, and no harm came to him.
And I saw a man to whom an arrow had fallen into his back, and the wound had healed around it.
After seven years had passed, the arrow emerged at the root of his thigh.
And I saw a woman to whom an arrow had fallen into her abdomen, and the wound had healed around it, and the arrow remained inside her: and there was no change in her condition, and the woman did not find any harm in any of her natural functions.
And I saw another man to whom an arrow fell on his face: and the wound healed, and remained without causing him much pain: and many things like these.
And I removed an arrow from a prince of the king, which had fallen into the middle of his nose and had slightly shifted to the right side: and the arrow was completely hidden.
I was summoned for his treatment after the arrow incident for three days.
I found the wound from the arrow very narrow.
I examined it with a fine probe and did not feel the arrow: and indeed, he himself felt a puncture and pain under his right ear.
I hoped that the puncture was from the tip of the arrow.
I applied a plaster with drawing and softening properties to the area, confident that the spot would abscess and show me a sign of the arrow, so I could cut above it: but nothing happened in the area indicating that the arrow had followed the path.
I continued to treat him with the plaster for many days: and no event occurred, and the wound healed in the meantime: and he remained ill from the extraction for a space of days until one day he felt the arrow inside his nose.
And he told me about it.
I applied a sharp, corrosive medicine to the wound for many days until it opened: and when I probed it with a probe, I felt the tip of the arrow, which was stuck in the wood.
Then I added the sharp medicine in the opening of the wound until we could see visibly the tip of the arrow: and that period of time passed with it for about four months.
Then, after the wound had enlarged and it was possible for me to introduce forceps into it and move it, but it did not obey to come out: then I did not cease to refine and devise methods with ingenuity upon it, until on a certain day I succeeded in removing it using well-made forceps, as their form will appear at the end of the chapter.
Then I restored the wound.
And indeed, doctors judge that the nasal cartilage cannot be restored.
I therefore restored it, and the wound healed, and the patient was completely cured: nothing harmed him at all.
And I tell you about the quality of extracting some arrows: so that you may put it as a rule and explanation for what I have not mentioned.
Since the parts of this art and distinctions thereof are not encompassed in the narration: nor is it contained within the book, and a prudent craftsman compares little with much: and that which is at hand with that which is absent: and finds a new operation and new instrument among the descent of foreign things of this art when they occur.
I say therefore that arrows do not come out of the limbs in which they are fixed except according to two methods. Or by pulling from the place from which it entered.
Or rather of the other part.
And that which comes out where it entered, or is an arrow proceeding in fleshy tissue: and it is drawn, and comes out.
If it does not come out within the hour in which it falls: then you must leave it for several days until the flesh around it becomes rotten: and its attraction is reduced, and then it will come out.
And similarly if it is fixed in bone, and does not come out when you try to remove it, then leave it for several days as well: and attempt to extract it with pulling and motion every day until it comes out.
If it does not come out after days when you try to remove it, then you must bore around the arrow in the bone from all sides with a fine drill, until the arrow enlarges.
Then pull it and remove it.
If the arrow is fixed in the skull bone and has already penetrated one of the ventricles of the brain, and certain symptoms that I mentioned appear due to injury: then abstain from pulling the arrow, and leave it alone for several days until its condition stabilizes.
For if the arrow reaches the brain, then death is not delayed for them.
And if the arrow is not fixed except in the body of the bone only, and does not penetrate to the brain: and the injured person remains for several days without any of those symptoms occurring: then proceed with pulling and extracting the arrow.
If it is fixed very firmly and does not respond to your attempts to pull it: then apply drills around the arrow as I have described: then treat the area until it heals.
If the arrow is now hidden in a part of the body and is concealed from perception, then search for it with a probe.
If you feel it, then draw it out with instruments suitable for its removal.
If you are unable to reach it due to the constriction of the wound and because the arrow is deep inside, and there is no bone, nerve, or vein in that area: then let the wound be enlarged until it is possible to extract the arrow.
If there are parts by which it can be held, then free the flesh fixed to them from every part with all means available, and use these methods even if it cannot be released without dislocation of the joints and twisting them until it comes out.
And when you administer the extraction of the arrow, in whatever part it is, then use twisting motions of your hand with pincers to reach all parts until you make it come out: and for delicate work use fine tools, so that the arrow does not break, making its removal difficult for you.
If you are unable to remove it within one hour, then leave it for several days until the surrounding tissue begins to decompose.
Then try again later: at that time the task will be easier. However, if the flow of blood hinders you, then administer what we have mentioned in the treatment chapter, and be careful not to cut a vein, nerve, or tendon.
And use every possible means to extract the arrow: do so with ease, calmness, slowness, and firmness, as I have told you.
And you must make sure that when you are drawing out an arrow, the patient is positioned according to the figure in which the arrow was lodged in him.
For it is more beneficial.
But if you are unable to do that, then administer what is possible for you according to the figures.
An arrow that exits from the opposite side or has already proceeded somewhat to the exterior: either it causes a prominence at the tip of the arrow through feeling from the upper part of the nearby skin, and you see it protruding: cut above it, and let the incision be in proportion to how much the forceps can grasp.
Then draw it out: for it becomes easy to extract.
But if it is lodged in the bone, then rotate your hand according to the roundness until the arrow presses against the bone and enlarges itself; then draw it out.
And if not, leave it for several days: then attempt to draw it out again until it comes out.
If the shaft of the arrow is still attached to it, then push it out with that.
But if the shaft has fallen off and you wish to push it, then insert a concave instrument so that its concavity enters the tail of the arrow: then push it with that.
But if the arrow is concave, then push it with an instrument entering into it.
For the arrow is supported by that.
If the arrow is poisoned, then it is necessary to hollow out all the flesh in which the poison is, if it is possible for you to do so.
Then treat it with what is appropriate for that.
If the arrow is lodged in the chest, or in the abdomen, or in the bladder, or in the side: and it is near what you touch with a probe, and it is possible for you to cut over it: then cut, and be careful not to incise a vein or nerve, and extract it.
Then treat the wound if you see it, and care for it until it is healed.
And this is the form of the forceps with which arrows are extracted.
Let the tips be like the beak of a bird, which are made like iron: when they grasp the arrow, they do not let it go.
And they are made in many varieties, large and small and medium, according to the size of the arrow and its thickness, and the width of the wound and its tightness.
The shape of the pusher is concave.
And the shape of the pusher is blunt.
This is the blunt end like a radius, so that it may ease its entry into a concave arrow and push it along with it.
The concave end of this pusher is curved like a bird's feather: so that it may ease the entry of the arrow into it and facilitate its movement.
On Phlebotomy of Veins.
Chapter XC VII. There are thirty veins that are accustomed to be opened for phlebotomy in the body.
Of which there are sixteen in the head: two pulsating veins, which are located behind the ears and are called the two Herbs; and two arteries, which appear in both temples; and two veins that are in the tear ducts of both eyes, which are called Aspicientes; and a vein prepared in the middle of the forehead; and a vein which is at the tip of the nose.
And two veins called Guidegi, which are in the neck.
And two veins that are in the upper lip of the mouth.
And two veins that are in the lower lip.
And these are the veins which are called Algecherich.
And two veins that are under the tongue.
The veins that are opened for phlebotomy in the arms are five veins in each arm.
One of them is the Cephalic vein, and it is on the lateral side of the arm: and the common people call it the head vein.
And the Blue vein.
And there is the Median vein, and it is composed of a branch of the Basilic vein and a branch of the Cephalic vein: and the common people call it the body vein.
And it is placed at the side of the house, and it is also called Titillicaris.
And the common people call it the vein of the abdomen.
And the Funis of the arm, and it is placed above the hearth: and that is where phlebotomy is performed, and it is visible above the thumb clearly.
And the Saluatella: and it is a vein that is between the ring finger and the little finger: and it has two branches.
And in the thigh and in the foot there are three veins.
One of them is the vein that is under the curvature of the big toe on the outer side.
And the second is the Saphena: and its location is near the heel on the inner side.
And the vein of Nesse: and its location is near the heel on the outer side.
And in the other thigh there are three veins similar to those.
Concerning the phlebotomy of two veins behind the ears.
However, the phlebotomy of the two veins that are behind the ears is helpful for treating chronic catarrhs, migraines, and old wounds of the head.
And the method of performing phlebotomy on them is as I describe.
And it is done by shaving the head of the patient: and rubbing the back of their neck in the area of the two veins with a rough cloth vigorously.
Then the patient should bind his neck with a cord until two veins appear.
And their locations are behind the ears in two depressed areas of the head.
Search for them with your finger, and where you feel their pulse under your finger, mark it with a hot iron.
Then take a short surgical knife, and it is called the Incisive.
Then insert it under the vein in the skin until the surgical knife reaches the opening.
Then raise your hand with the vein and skin towards the upper part, and cut the vein with the skin in a slicing manner.
And the length of the incision should be the amount of two joined fingers, or around that much: and let as much blood out as you wish.
Then bind it with poultices, and leave it until it heals.
And now the cutting of these and their cauterization have been discussed at the beginning of the book.
¶ On bleeding the two arteries in the temples.
The bleeding of the two arteries which are in the two temples is beneficial for chronic headache: and for painful sinuses, and for continuous ophthalmia: and for the discharge of excessive sharp humors to the eyes. And the method of bleeding these arteries is as I have described to you.
The patient should strain his neck greatly until two veins appear clearly; and demonstrate the pulse of these veins under your finger.
Then apply signs with cerement.
Then raise the skin above the vein with your index finger, and insert the lancet from below, and raise the vein upwards.
And cut it as you did with the other two veins, and let the blood flow according to your need. Then loosen the patient's constriction, and place your finger on the vein for one hour.
Then apply cotton and powder to it, and bind it tightly with a strong bandage; and leave it until it heals.
And now there has been a mention of them, and their cutting, and their extraction at the beginning of the book.
Concerning the bloodletting of the frontal vein after cephalic bloodletting.
The remedy for bloodletting of the frontal vein after cephalic bloodletting is for chronic facial ailments: and for headaches on one side, and redness: and foul ulcers.
And the quality of its bloodletting is as I shall tell you.
The patient should compress his neck with a cloth until the vein appears.
Then take the instrument called Fossorium.
This is its form.
Place the sharp point that is on top of the forceps over the vein, and strike it with a comb or something similar in manner: and let the blood flow according to the amount you wish.
Then treat the patient's perforation and apply pressure to it until it heals.
And sometimes it is opened with a wide lancet.
However, it should not be sharp at the end like other lancets, but rather broad at the end.
And use the lancet acrosswise: since it is near an opening: and perhaps the lancet may break if it is delicate.
Concerning the incision of Veins in the Two Lacrimal Glands.
The treatment of the two veins that are in the two lacrimal glands of both eyes is for eye conditions such as itchiness and redness: and pain in the eye, and facial ailments.
And the nature of incising those veins is such that the patient should compress their neck with a bandage.
Then incise them: and you should stand over his head while doing so.
And the incision should be made acrosswise for a short length, using a small lancet that is slightly broad, as there is little flesh in the area.
If the lancet is delicate at the end, it may break.
Then let it be necessary for you to allow as much blood to flow as is needed.
And place gauze over them, and bind them for one night, and then remove them.
Concerning the Phlebotomy of the Nasal Veins.
Phlebotomy of the nasal veins is applicable for acute fever, violent headache, and facial ailments such as migraine, and redness that occurs on the face: especially when it is chronic.
And the quality of its phlebotomy is such that the patient should tighten his neck.
Then hold his nose with your left hand, and take a fine, long phlebotomy needle, and place it in the middle of the nasal septum.
Since the vein is not visible there, and because the blood begins to flow immediately.
And it is necessary to hold your hand with the phlebotomy needle for a short while: and let the blood flow according to your need.
Then bind it for one night.
For it heals quickly.
Concerning the Phlebotomy of the Guidegi Veins.
The phlebotomy of the two Guidegi veins is helpful for constricting breathlessness, the onset of leprosy, melancholic ailments, impetigo and bad sores, and corrosive conditions, such as scabies and eczema.
And the quality of phlebotomy for them is that the patient should tie something under both sides of his neck with a bandage: and the practitioner should stand over the head of the patient, and the patient should be sitting on a seat.
Then let the phlebotomy needle be made to a length somewhat wide for phlebotomy.
Then draw from the blood a moderate quantity, or according to what you see is necessary for that.
Then do the same with another vein.
Then loosen the bandage, and apply a medium tourniquet to the two veins: so that the patient is not choked.
And let her go until morning.
For the wound is healing.
¶ On Phlebotomy of Veins by Albucasis.
The veins are beneficial for Albucasis's phlebotomy because they help with alcohol on the mouth, and gum corruption: and bad sores: and splits of the lips, and bad ulcers, even those which are in the nose, and around it.
And the quality of phlebotomy for them is that you should have the patient sit before you: and tie his neck with a bandage.
Then roll back his lip and look at the two veins: one is on the right side of the lip, and the other is on the left: and the appearance of each is indicated by the darkness of both.
And it is true: because around them are small veins, black.
Therefore cut both with an oblique incision. But if you are in doubt and do not know which one it is: then pay attention to the larger of the incisions, and the more apparent of them.
And similarly do this for the two veins that are on the upper lip: and indeed custom most often agrees with this. And cut the two veins that are on the lower lip.
Regarding Phlebotomy of the Vein Under the Tongue Following Cephalic Phlebotomy.
The benefit of the phlebotomy of the two veins that are under the tongue is that cephalic phlebotomy helps with suffocations that occur in the throat, and inflammation of the gums, and illnesses of the mouth.
And the manner of phlebotomizing them is that the patient should sit between your hands facing the sun: and lift his tongue, and look under his tongue from one side for a vein, and from the other side for another vein: and the color of both tends towards blackness.
Therefore phlebotomize both veins: and be careful not to go too far with your hand when phlebotomizing them.
For arteries lie under them, and it may happen that blood will flow from those arteries.
Regarding the Three Veins in the Elbow.
The three veins that are phlebotomized in the elbow, which are phlebotomized according to custom in all people.
And phlebotomy of them is performed in two ways.
Or by pricking with a broad myrtle lancet; or with an olive lancet for fineness: or cutting with a pocket lancet, and it is called Alnesil.
And this is its form.
Thus Alnesil is, which is suitable for cutting.
And from these there are broad and fine types according to the width of the veins and their tightness. The shape of the myrtle lancet is broad, as you see.
And it is suitable for opening concave, full, protruding, visible, thick veins, and those that contain thick, cloudy blood.
And this lancet is of narrower width and finer at the tip.
And it is suitable for bleeding fine veins that contain thin, yellowish blood.
Concerning the Phlebotomy of the Basilic Vein.
The basilic vein, which is one of these three veins, is beneficial for phlebotomy. Because it extracts blood from illnesses that are below the throat and neck, following the chest and abdomen. It is appropriate for the phlebologist to be cautious when performing phlebotomy with this vein, as there is an artery beneath it, so one should proceed with care due to this concern.
If therefore he makes a mistake and adds too much to the puncture of the lancet, he will cut that artery, and there will be a flow of blood.
Therefore, one should not use a sharp lancet for phlebotomy; rather, use a scalpel with Alnesil.
If the basilica is not clearly visible, then you should move away from it and switch to another one, or seek a branch of it: or in its place, perform phlebotomy on the funiculus brachii.
For it is clearly visible, and you should cut it with the Anesil lancet, as we have said.
If you wish to perform phlebotomy on it, then before tightening the arm, touch the area until you find the pulse location.
Then mark the area with a hot iron, then hold the arm and cut the vein with a concave incision using the Alnesil lancet, as we have said.
And be careful that the blow does not fall in the space between the artery location.
And when you see that as you tighten the ligature, there is swelling in the place you marked with a hot iron, then that swelling is arterial swelling; therefore, avoid it.
If you see the blood rising during phlebotomy like a child's urine, and it is fine and red, then you know that it is arterial blood.
Then hurry and place your finger on that space for a moment, then remove your finger.
If the blood is cut off (it often does get cut off), then tighten the arm and leave it as is: and the patient should avoid moving that area and be cautious of it.
And let him not move for several days until it is healed.
But if the blood does not stop and overcomes you, and there is no medicine available to you at that moment, then cut the artery, if it appears necessary to you.
For its extremities contract, and the blood is cut off.
Or take the peel of a date stone, and burn it; take half of it and apply it to the site of the vein constriction with a bandage and powder until another day.
Then if the blood is stopped, it is good.
And if not, then treat it with what was mentioned before regarding places that stop the flow of blood: and stopping the blood is not difficult in many cases, due to the small area of the wound and the possibility of applying a bandage from the arm.
Concerning the Phlebotomy of the Dark Vein.
Phlebotomy of the Dark Vein is beneficial in drawing blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body: because it is composed of the branch of the Basilic vein and the branch of the Cephalic vein, as we have said.
And it is appropriate for the phlebotomy practitioner to be without fear during the procedure, as there is a nerve under this vein.
If therefore the practitioner adds pressure during the phlebotomy and finds a nerve, there will be numbness in that area, and healing becomes difficult, and it may not heal completely.
And this nerve often appears to the senses.
If it is hidden in some people and is subtle and not revealed, then you must apply your phlebotomy as you perform it, the cut with Alnesil, and avoid the nerve with all your strength.
If the vein is between two nerves, then find the vein along its length.
Concerning the cephalic vein.
Phlebotomy of the cephalic vein is helpful because it draws blood from the head and benefits ailments of the eyes.
And if you wish to perform phlebotomy on this vein properly, you should do so by piercing it with an olive phlebotomoy knife or a myrtle phlebotomy knife, for it is safer than all other veins because there is no delicate artery or nerve near it. However, when performing phlebotomy, you should avoid the head of the biceps with the phlebotomy knife just slightly, and seek a softer area. It does no harm if it is not found on the first percussion, and you can repeat the procedure several times with the phlebotomy. However, it may become inflamed in some people when not phlebotomed on the first percussion, but such inflammation does no harm.
Concerning the usefulness of Phlebotomy and the precautions to be observed in it.
The quality of phlebotomy and the accidents arising from it, which you must consider for its proper execution.
Therefore, it is important to know that bloodletting is not administered except for the preservation of health, and its maintenance, and caution against the onset of diseases.
And to perform bloodletting on one of the three veins in the elbow, namely the Cephalic, the Median Cubital, and the Basilic.
And to perform bloodletting at the beginning of spring after fasting, in spring and summer: and in autumn and winter after eating, when signs of fullness are apparent.
And bloodletting should be performed on the first day, or on the third day, after three hours have passed since dawn.
However, bloodletting administered for illnesses does not have a fixed time; it is performed when circumstances and necessity require it, day or night, at any hour and at any time.
And it is not appropriate to perform bloodletting on children until they reach fourteen years of age.
A pregnant woman should not be bled except from the fourth month until the seventh month.
And those who have passed sixty years of age should not be bled.
When someone wishes to undergo bloodletting for any reason, it is necessary to cleanse their intestines before bloodletting with a gentle enema if there is much retained feces in them: so that the veins near the bloodletting site do not attract noxious putrid substances from the intestines and draw them towards the principal parts of the body.
The patient should not be bled when they are too full, that is, when they feel nausea from overeating; nor should they be drunk or recovering from drunkenness, until those conditions are removed from them.
Nor should an ill person with dropsy be bled.
And bleeding should be avoided after an attack of colic, vomiting, diarrhea, excessive sexual activity, labor, exercise, wakefulness, fasting, and anything that dissipates strength from the bodily or vital fluids.
Then consider the subtlety of the humors before doing so; if the blood is thick due to food and drinks, and medicines: if it is possible for him to do that.
Then enter the bath if nothing prohibits it; or engage in some exercise to refine the blood.
And perform the bloodletting on his chest around the third day, as we said: and strive to ensure that on that day his body is free from all animal evils such as distress, anger, and fear: and from all bodily ailments such as labor, pain, excessive sweating, and similar conditions.
And ensure that at his place, there are present things whose use has become customary among people due to their aromatic qualities, and pleasant smells and celebrations, in proportion to what is possible.
Then the bloodletter should sit on a cushion that is higher than the cushion used for bleeding: afterwards, he should extend his arm and rub it twice or thrice with his hand.
Then tie the vein with a ligature and wrap it twice.
And let the ligature be moderate, for when it is uneven, either by excess in the ligature, then it impedes the flow of blood; or in softening, then also it impedes the flow of blood.
Then after the ligature, it is necessary that the phlebotomist should rub his hands simultaneously until the veins swell and become apparent to the senses.
Then the phlebotomist should clean the vein with a little oil, properly and carefully.
Then he should place his index finger of the left hand on the vein slightly above the place where he wishes to perform the phlebotomy, so that the vein does not escape and be struck effectively.
Because the veins are like a fleeing chord at the time of phlebotomy: and they are full of windiness: and when you place the lancet on them, they contract under the lancet, and deceive the phlebotomist, and do not open for the lancet: and if it does open them, it is constricted. Therefore, it is necessary that the phlebotomist be firm and diligent in all these matters.
Then remove the lancet.
And if not, then repeat it at another place nearby or above it quickly: if the area has not become inflamed.
If it becomes inflamed, or the patient weakens, then leave him for a day or two: and do not apply a ligature.
For perhaps it will attract a hot abscess.
Nor shall he enter a bath.
Then let bloodletting be repeated, if desired.
If the incision is small, or the blood flows thinly, and you fear that the amount of blood you wish to extract will not come out: then repeat the bloodletting at the same point along the straight line, and add a little more to the procedure.
And do this with haste, before the place becomes inflamed, for an inflamed area is common around a small procedure in many people.
If you see that it is already inflamed, then do not repeat the procedure on it at all, for nothing excuses this. And place something from oil residue on it, for it alleviates the flow of blood.
And it is better in this case than the oil itself and other oils.
And similarly, administer oil residue in all your bloodletting procedures where you restrict the flow of blood. And this is done with electuaries of alfa herbs and sage, when one of them is applied to the site.
For blood becomes finer and dissolves when it is thick.
If an abscess occurs at the site of bloodletting, which often happens, especially for those who are not accustomed to bloodletting or whose incision is small, then hurry and place a sponge soaked in warm water and salt on the site: and press it for one hour, for it dissolves.
And you should do this after the blood has come out of the vein itself, when it is full, or from another vein.
And abscesses and swellings often occur near the venesection site at the Basilica.
Place your hand on it, then if you find softness upon pressing it, then that swelling is harmful.
Be careful, therefore, not to apply anything to it as we have mentioned.
For perhaps blood may flow from that artery.
But apply a plaster to it with something astringent to harden the area.
Then care for it along with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
And you should draw blood from every person in an amount according to their strength.
And what appears from the color dominating the blood.
For if the blood is black, then let it flow until it turns red; and similarly, if you see it to be thick, then let it flow until it becomes thin; and similarly, if it is sharp in nature, let it flow until that sharpness is removed.
And it is necessary for a person who is full, strong, and needs bloodletting, that the venesection be enlarged and on the side; and for one who is weak, it should be the opposite.
And it is necessary that he extracts it with forceps, and the hole should be tight: and better than what is used in phlebotomy of veins is a transverse cut, not a puncture.
And this method of phlebotomy is safe from excessive blood flow and from cutting the nerve: and it is more praiseworthy and safer than phlebotomy by length and width.
And for those who are prone to fainting during phlebotomy, it is necessary that they eat a little bread infused in pomegranate juice before phlebotomy: or scallion, if it is heated: and extract from the blood in three squeezes, or four.
And if they have a cold complexion, then let them take bread infused in mithridate syrup, or in aromatic honey syrup with spices, or in fragrant aromatic syrup before phlebotomy.
If fainting occurs during phlebotomy and the cause is excessive loss of blood, then it is necessary that they drink water mixed with meat and a subtle fragrant syrup: and use aromatics with almond oil, and apply it to their chest: and use other remedies as we have mentioned in the chapter on fainting due to evacuation.
Whoever wishes to bleed their arm and release their blood gradually: should do so for one whose phlebotomy is necessary due to a large evacuation and whose strength is weak, by releasing the blood little by little according to their strength over consecutive days.
Whoever wishes to bleed their arm and release their blood again, and has a strong body: then let them do so seven or nine hours after their first phlebotomy.
However, if one wants to attract blood from their body towards the opposite side to which it tends to flow: it must be done for him on the second day, or on the third.
In a body where there is already much heated and sharp blood, which causes fever to occur: it must be that the blood exits from it all at once, and a large amount should be drawn out: and the incision should be enlarged until syncope occurs; after you have maintained all the conditions of phlebotomy: and place your hand on his pulse near the flow of blood, so that death does not occur due to syncope.
For this often happens when the phlebotomist is ignorant and fails due to negligence.
And it is not appropriate when you wish to release the arm and draw blood a second time, if the vein orifice is already closed and the blood's exit is difficult, to press upon it with force and quickly straighten the bent area.
For that is very bad; indeed, leave it until the second phlebotomy.
Or remove with sharpness from the vein's orifice what has coagulated from the blood, and place upon it some salt dissolved in water.
And place something from Alfarach or Sagzena treacle upon it, and apply light compression until the blood flows out.
But if the vein is already inflamed, then leave it and do not cover it until the inflammation subsides.
If necessity compels drawing blood a second time and there is no excuse to avoid it, then either perform phlebotomy on that same spot or on another vein in the other arm.
However, the vein of the arm is phlebotomized at the Fusaea and Basilica, where they are not found, and they are hidden, because it is composed of them.
And the quality of phlebotomy is such that the patient should insert his hand into warm water until it turns red and the vein becomes clearly visible.
Then tie a ligature with moderate tightness over it in the middle.
Then make the incision gradually across the vein, neither too wide nor along its length; and let the opening be wide enough, and when you perform the phlebotomy, do it for a short time above the joint of the hand.
And indeed, the flow of blood into warm water is most significant during the winter season.
And the phlebotomy of this vein is safer than that of all other veins, because there is no pulsating vein or nerve under it.
However, the phlebotomy of the Saluatella vein on the right hand relieves ailments of the liver.
And the quality of this phlebotomy is such that you should tie a ligature or squeeze the hand with your hand after immersing it in warm water until the vein swells and becomes clearly visible to the touch.
Then cut it across with a scalpel.
And if you cut it completely, it will not harm her in any way.
And keep it so, without using your hand with the scalpel.
Below it, the nerves of the fingers are exposed from the flesh.
Then place your hand in warm water, and allow the blood to flow into it.
For if you do not place it in warm water, the blood will coagulate in the vein opening and hinder its flow.
Therefore, when you have extracted the necessary amount of blood, then apply oil and salt on the vein: so that it does not heal too quickly.
And similarly, you must do this with every tight branch.
However, the venesection for that vessel should be performed with your left hand, as it relates to diseases of the spleen: and similarly, perform the venesection on it as you did equally in the second one.
The venesection of the saphenous vein is beneficial for ailments in the lower part of the body, such as ovarian disorders, retention of menstruation, kidney diseases, old ulcers of the thighs and legs, and similar illnesses.
And the procedure for its venesection is that the patient should immerse his foot in warm water: and rub it until the veins become prominent: and tie above the joint of the foot with a bandage.
And the location of the vein is at the heel, visible towards the big toe: and branches from it extend across the surface of the foot.
Therefore, phlebotomy should be performed on the larger branch of it, or at the heel where the vein converges: for this is better and safer.
If you perform phlebotomy on the surface of the foot, then be careful not to cut the nerves that lie beneath it.
And place your incision for phlebotomy as if you want to cut across it: and let the phlebotomy be shallow.
但如果血液流出受阻，那么将脚放入温水中：让血液流入其中，直到它被排空。
但如果放血者在第一次误切了静脉，那么再次进行放血时稍微向上一些，因为那个位置是安全的，当你小心避开神经时，不必担心由此产生的不良后果，正如我们所说的。
同样地，对于另一只脚的大隐静脉也应同等处理。
然而，如前所述，腓静脉的位置是在脚跟的外侧。注意这里的"Sciaticae"可能是指与位置相近的静脉，翻译时可根据上下文理解调整为更合适的术语。如果指的是大隐静脉或小隐静脉在脚跟附近的部分，则可以表述为："然而，如前所述，隐静脉的位置是在脚跟的外侧。" 具体取决于原文的具体指代。
并且，对其进行放血可以缓解疼痛，当疼痛是由于热性血液引起时尤其有效。
并且，对其进行放血的方法是，病人应尽快进入浴缸：用细长的绷带从疼痛部位侧边紧压到脚跟上方四指处，这样做只是为了达到这个效果。
When it is therefore apparent, then use the phlebotome to cut it in whatever manner is possible for you, either across or lengthwise: and it is better to make an incision with a knife or to cut it with scissors.
For its location is safer, and it is very hidden in most people.
If you do not find it and it does not appear at all to the senses: then cut with a phlebotome one of its branches, and that which is visible on the back of the foot near the heel: be careful of the nerves, and let the blood flow in the quantity you desire.
Then loosen the constriction, and place leather over the site of the incision, and secure the area.
It is healed quickly.
Regarding Venesection, and the Quality of Its Use.
Chapter XC VIII.
Ventose cups are made from horns, and from copper, and from glass.
And venesection is indeed performed in two ways.
One involves scarification and the extraction of blood, and the other is venesection without scarification. And this venesection which is without scarification is performed in two ways.
One involves the use of fire.
The other is without the use of fire.
And the ventose cups that are applied with scarification and the extraction of blood are fourteen locations on the body.
One of them is Ventosatio Alnocrati, and it is the last of the head. And Alkehel, and it is in the middle of the neck. And ventose plates of Alhagdahim, and they are two plates on both sides of the neck simultaneously. And ventose of the chin, and it is under the jaw below the mouth. And ventose of the two spatulas: and ventose of Alachosos at the end of the tail. And ventose of the two elbows, and they are in the middle of the two arms. And ventose of the two thighs: and ventose of the two heels.
And indeed, Ventosatio does not draw blood from you through the small veins scattered in the flesh, and because of this, their power does not diminish as it would with phlebotomy.
Nor should ventosation be administered, whether with fire or without fire, in any illnesses that arise from congestion, until the entire body is evacuated.
If necessity prompts ventosation due to illness or out of habit, we administer it at any hour at the beginning of the month, at the end of it, and in the middle, and at whatever time it may be.
This is because there are people who, when the blood multiplies within them to the point where it needs to be extracted through ventosation, find that they have heaviness and swelling in their head.
And there are those among them who find congestion and redness in their face, head, and neck.
And there are those among them who experience itching in their face and forehead, as well as darkness and dullness in their eyes.
And there is one who scrapes the site of his wound. And among them is he whose laughter is multiplied.
And there is one who finds the taste of blood in his mouth: or his tongue becomes swollen, and he spits out blood.
And among them is he whose sleep is multiplied.
And there is one who sees in his sleep blood and redness, and the slain, and wounds, and things similar to these. When we therefore see any of these things, and especially if it is on the fifteenth day of the month: we then order the wound to be treated, after two or three hours have passed. The support for neck ventosity is that it contributes to heaviness in the head, and what is discharged affects the eyes.
