of dropsy
We have already discussed in the division the different types of dropsy, and how the accumulation of water occurs, and the signs of each type, and the treatment that is done with medicines, and that which is treated with iron:
if it is only superficial;
and one should not touch with iron in these two types:
that is to say, tympanites and ascites, because it is a fatal thing;
Therefore, when you treat this type of dropsy which is called "anasarca" with medicines, and the treatment is not effective, then see if the patient is weak, or if they have another illness besides dropsy, such as coughing and diarrhea and similar things;
do not touch it with iron, because there is danger;
and if you see the patient is of strong constitution, and they have no other illness than just dropsy, and they are not too young nor too old, then you should proceed as follows:
Lift the patient upright with your hands, and an assistant should press the belly, pushing the water to the lowest part of the abdomen, then take the thorned spatula made in this way:
And let it be sharp on both sides.
with a point, and yet not so penetrating that it can reach the intestine when inserted, and not be able to wound it; 
then see if the dropsy originates from near the intestines:
then you must cut above the navel three fingers directly below, towards the pubic bone;
and if the dropsy is due to liver disease, let your incision be three fingers to the left of the navel;
and if it's because of the spleen, let it be on the right, and the patient should not lie on the incision so that the excess fluids don't flow to that weak spot;
then pierce all the skin with the instrument, push it in, and lift your hand with the spatula between the skin and the superficial fascia as if skinning, about the size of a fingernail or thereabouts;
then pierce the superficial fascia until the spatula reaches the empty space, and that is the location of the fluid, then pull it out, and insert this instrument of which here is the form:
And it is similar to a thin silver tube, and it is made of light brass or bronze, and has a small hole in the lower part;
and on one side, three holes;
and two on the other side, and one on the other;
and the head is cut like a pen, and this is the shape of the incision with which the scribe cuts the pen:
at the top is the wing, so that when the instrument comes to the point, it immediately descends onto the instrument;
then empty half or a third, for if you empty more than is necessary at that time, perhaps the patient will die from the release of his spirit from the soul, or he will faint, or he will approach death;
but empty it according to the quantity of his strength, and according to what the dispositions of the patient's strength indicate, and his pulse;
then withdraw the instrument and hold the needle, and it is held immediately by the core that plugs the hole that is on the syfac, of which I have spoken, which you pierce in this way; 
then start the instrument again the next day, if you see the patient tolerating it, and draw out a small amount of fluid;
do this for a few days, and be careful not to drain so much that nothing remains but a small amount of fluid. 
And if you are concerned about the patient, and you leave a lot of fluid, treat him with burial in warm sand, and with much sweating or baths and in the sun, and let him abstain from drinking;
and treat him with drying medicines until he is healed, and cauterize over the stomach and over the liver and over the spleen after the extraction of the fluid, as I have said before.
