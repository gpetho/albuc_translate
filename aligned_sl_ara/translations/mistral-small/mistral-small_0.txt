"The author of this book said: 'After I have completed for you, O my sons, this book which is a part of the science of medicine in its perfection and reached its utmost clarity and explanation, I saw fit to complete it for you with this chapter which is a part of the practice by hand.'
"Because the practice by hand has been neglected in our country and in our time, almost to the point that its science is no longer taught and its trace is cut off. "Only scattered traces of it remain in the books of the ancients, which have been corrupted by time and the errors and misinterpretations until its meanings were obscured and its usefulness diminished.
"So I saw fit to revive it and compile this chapter, explaining and clarifying it in a concise manner, providing illustrations of the tools, including those used for cautery and other surgical instruments, as this adds to the explanation and is essential for those who need it.
"The reason why there is no skilled craftsman in our time is that the craft of medicine is long and its practitioner should first excel in anatomy, as described by Galen. "So that he may understand the advantages of the limbs, their structure, composition, connections, and separations, as well as the knowledge of bones, nerves, muscles, their number, exits, pulsating and calm veins, and the locations of their exits.
"Therefore, Hippocrates said that doctors are numerous in name but few in practice, especially in the art of surgery, as we have mentioned briefly at the beginning of this book.
"For he who is not knowledgeable in what we have mentioned of anatomy, will inevitably fall into errors that kill people, as I have often seen among those who claim proficiency in this science without knowledge or experience.
"And that is because I saw an ignorant physician cut into a pig's wart on a woman's neck, so he severed some of the neck’s veins and the woman bled until she died in front of him.
"And I saw another physician who, while removing a large tooth from a man's mouth, broke the instrument and removed the tooth along with a piece of the man's jaw. "So the man died after about three days, and I had been called to remove it. I saw the hardness of the tooth and the condition of the patient was such that I could not have done it.
"And I saw another physician who used to practice on some of our country's rulers.
The physician hurried with his ignorance, so he splinted the fracture onto the wound using strips and bandages, tightening them firmly, leaving no space for the wound to breathe.
Then he released him to his desires, and left him for days, ordering him not to remove the bandage until his leg and foot became numb, and he approached destruction.
So he was called and hastened to remove the bandage, and relief came, and he escaped from his pains except that gangrene had taken control of the limb, and I could not restore it.
And the gangrene continued to spread in the limb until it died.
I saw another physician cauterize a cancerous tumor, and after some days it ulcerated until the patient's condition worsened, which happened because when cancer is caused by black bile, it should not be treated with hot iron.
Unless it is in a limb that can be amputated entirely.
Therefore, my son, you should know that the work of the hand is divided into two types: the type accompanied by safety and the type that brings corruption in most cases.
"I have warned you about everything in this book that contains deceit and fear, so it is necessary for you to be cautious and reject it.
"Lest the ignorant find a way to speak and criticize, take for yourselves fortitude and prudence, and for your patients, compassion and steadfastness.
"Use the best path leading to safety and a praiseworthy outcome, and avoid dangerous, stubborn diseases.
"And purify yourselves from that which you fear might bring doubt into your religion and worldly affairs, for it will remain the best course for you, elevating you in this life and the next according to your worth.
"For Galen said in some of his directives: 'Do not treat a disease poorly, lest you be called poor physicians.'
"And this chapter has been divided into three sections.
"The First Section
"Regarding cautery with fire and cautery with sharp instruments, which is arranged from the skull to the toes, including images of the tools and the cauterizing irons, as well as everything needed for manual work.
"The Second Section
"Regarding incisions, cupping, venesection, bloodletting, surgical procedures, and the extraction of arrows, all arranged and illustrated with images of the instruments.
The third chapter.
On the treatment of fractures, dislocations, and their kinds, arranged from the head to the foot, and illustrations of instruments.
The first chapter.
On the eye.
Before we discuss its use, it is necessary to mention its benefits and harms, and in which temperament it should be used.
I say that the discussion on the benefits and harms of the eye is a lengthy discourse, precise science, hidden secret, and many scholars have spoken about it.
And they disagreed on it, and only a little of their discussion has been summarized due to fear of becoming lengthy.
I say that the eye is beneficial in general for all bodily humors, whether with or without substance, except for two humors: hot humor without substance and dry humor without substance.
As for the dry humor with substance, there is disagreement about it. Some say that the eye is beneficial for it, while others disagree, saying that the eye is not suitable for a disease caused by heat and dryness because the nature of fire is heat and dryness.
It is impossible to cure a hot and dry disease with a hot and dry remedy. However, those who say the opposite claim that the eye made from fire can be beneficial for a hot and dry disease that occurs in the abdomen of people. When you add the human body and its moisture to the nature of fire, the human body becomes cold.
And I say with his words, for experience has revealed to me that this is true, except that it is not fitting for one to consider this matter except someone who has experienced and studied at the door of knowledge a great deal. And he stopped at the difference of temperaments among people and the condition of diseases in themselves, their causes, symptoms, and duration.
As for the rest of the temperaments, you should not be afraid of them, especially the cold and moist diseases, for all physicians have agreed on this, and they have not differed in the benefit of knowledge concerning them.
Know, my sons, that one of the secrets of treatment with fire is its superiority over drugs prepared by burning, because fire is a simple substance that does not exceed the function of the member that it heats, nor does it harm another connected member except with slight damage.
Treatment with burned drugs may exceed its function to other parts of the body, and it may cause a disease in the member that is difficult to cure or even fatal. But fire, due to its nobility and the purity of its substance, does not do this except when it is excessive.
And we have clarified that through experience over a long period of service and care for the craft, and standing on the truths of the matter.
Therefore, I dispensed with lengthy discourse, and if it were not unbecoming to this book of mine, I would have described for you in the fire a secret, hidden and subtle, and how to apply it to bodies and expel diseases from them with philosophical arguments that pierce your understandings.
Know, O my sons, that they have differed on the time in which cautery is most suitable. They deemed the best time to be the time of spring.
And I say that cautery can be suitable at any time because the harm caused by the season is absorbed in the benefit derived from cautery. Especially if the cautery is for urgent, severe, and life-threatening conditions that cannot tolerate delay, lest it be followed by a disaster that is greater than the harm caused by the season.
Do not let it trouble you, O my sons, what the common people and ignorant physicians think, that a cautery which cures a disease will never have a recurrence and make it chronic.
The matter is not as you imagined, for alkali is only like a drug that balances the temperament and dries out the moisture which is the cause of pain.
But alkali is preferable to drugs for its rapid success, the strength of its effect, and the intensity of its power.
And it may happen that the disease returns at times due to the patient's temperament and the strength and power of the disease, as well as what prepares in the body from the accumulation of excesses within it, and neglecting the self in acquiring nutrition and the like from these causes.
O God, let not the disease for which alkali is used be subtle and in a part with little excesses and moisture. For example, like alkali for toothache and the like; it may not recur in that case, and this is the least likely.
As for the common saying that alkali is the last resort in medicine, this is a true statement, except for what they mean by it; for they believe that no treatment is effective with or without drugs after applying alkali, and the matter is otherwise.
The meaning that alkali is the last resort in medicine is that when we use various treatments for a disease and those medicines do not heal, then we use alkali, and it heals. From here, it is said that alkali is the last resort in medicine. On the meaning that has been misconstrued by the common people and many of the ignorant physicians.
It has been mentioned earlier that cutting with gold is better than cutting with iron, and they said this due to the moderation of gold and the nobility of its gem, and they said that it does not cause inflammation at the site of the incision; however, this is not absolutely true.
Because I have tested this and found that it only works in some bodies, not others. Cutting with it is the best and most effective, as has been said, except that if you heat the blade of gold in the fire, it will not be clear to you when it reaches the degree of redness that you desire for the gold.
And because it quickly cools, even if you increase the heat during heating in the fire, it melts and drips. The craftsman is therefore inconvenienced by this, making the cutting with iron more suitable and closer to accuracy in work, God willing.
This chapter has been arranged in sections on cutting, from head to foot, so that the student may easily find what he seeks, God willing.
Chapter One.
Cutting the head requires one incision.
This ointment benefits from the predominance of moisture and mildness on the brain, which are the causes of headaches, frequent sneezes from the top of the head to the sides of the eyes and ears, excessive sleep, toothache, and ear pain. And in summary, for every disease that is treated with mildness, such as phlegm, gout, and similar diseases.
The image of this ointment is that the patient should first be ordered to cleanse the head with a gentle and pure drug for three or four days, according to the strength, age, and habit of the patient.
Then order him to shave his head with a scissors, and then make him sit upright in front of you with his hands on his chest.
Then place the little finger of your hand on the base of his nose between his eyes, and where the middle finger ends, mark that spot with a pen.
Then bring the olive oil ointment which is depicted here.
Uncover the bone to the size of a grain or a peppercorn, then lift your hand and repeat the same with an iron needle or another if it is cold. Until you see what I mentioned from the bone, then take some salt and dissolve it in water, put a cotton swab soaked in it on the spot, and leave it for three days.
Then take a cotton cloth soaked in oil and place it on the wound until the blisters from the burn subside, then treat it with the fourth part of myrobalan until he recovers, if God wills.
They have said that as long as the wound remains open, it is best and most effective to delay suturing.
Some of them mentioned that the skin should be pulled tight to the bone and held in place until part of the bone is burnt, then the burned part of the bone should be removed afterwards and treated.
Others have said that it is necessary to intensify the pulling until it has a strong effect on the bone, causing a small piece of bone to fall off like a grain or a small fragment. They claim that this releases a headache from that area and leaves the wound open for a long time.
Then he should be treated until the bone unites, and I do not see these two types of pulling except in some people and on the path of uncertainty, and it is better and safer to leave it if that is the case, for the head becomes painful when its natural connection is disrupted, as we have seen in other members.
Especially when the patient's head is naturally weak, and the first type of pulling is safer and better in my opinion. So be careful and use it; perform it safely if God wills.
The second chapter.
In the case of the head also.
If there is a persistent and prolonged pain in the head, that is due to an underlying cause; the use of ointments, poultices, plasters, lotions, syrups, and enemas will not benefit him, especially if he has already tried the single remedy we described, which did not help him. So observe (him). If the head of the patient is naturally strong and not weak, and he feels intense cold, treat him with another remedy on top of that one, but a little bit (of it). Then treat each corner of his head with a remedy until the skin becomes thin and reveals the amount of bone we described. Treat him with a remedy in the back of his head, in the place known as the occiput. Make sure your hand is gentle in this, and do not expose the bone, for if you do, the patient will feel intense pain unlike the pain from any other treatment on the head, all of which I will mention in their respective places.
The remedy used for the corners of the head and the back of the head should be softer than the one used in the middle of the head, as shown here.
The third chapter.
On the removal of the splenic flexure without incising it.
If there is pain in the temporal region accompanied by headache, and the pain extends to the eye, then the patient should be treated with medications for the head, and other treatments mentioned in the classification of diseases should be used. If this does not help, then trephination can be performed on both sides. Trephining may be done either with a strong burning medicine or with iron.
As for trephining with the burnt medicine, it is done by taking one clove of garlic, peeling it, and cutting off its two ends. Then, a deep hole is made in the painful spot in the bone using a broad needle until there is a space under the skin large enough to fit the clove.  (If there is no room for the whole clove, cut it into smaller pieces.)
Then, it is placed under the skin until it disappears, and a tight bandage is applied to it for fifteen hours. After that, it is unwrapped, the garlic is removed, and the wound is left open for two or three days before being dressed.
Then, it is dressed with a piece of cotton soaked in oil until the spot heals. After that, it is treated with rosewater until it heals, God willing. If you wish, you can do this with some of the burnt medicines mentioned in Chapter Eighteen on Burnt Medicines.  (Note: The original text uses the word "rosewater" (mahram), but the context suggests that it might be a scribal error or misreading and should refer to a different treatment, possibly a local application of rose oil or another kind of ointment.)
"As for cauterizing with iron, it is done in this manner: the cautery is heated as shown in this image.
"The tubular cautery is so called because its tip resembles a screw, in which there is some coiling and in the middle of it there is a small hole.
"Then place it on the site of the pain and hold it with your hand, turning the cautery slightly, and the amount that will be burned from the thickness of the skin will be like half of it. "And raise your hand so that you do not burn the veins which are below, causing discharge; then drink cotton in salt water and place it on the site, leaving it for three days. "Then carry the cotton with oil, then treat it with honey until it heals, God willing.
"If you wish, you can cauterize this cut with the blunt end of the cautery that comes from the cautery, and protect against cutting the veins in this cut except for the momentary ones specifically.
"Chapter Four.
"Cauterize the momentary cut.
"If the cut has been treated as mentioned in the previous treatment and in the division of diseases, and if the treatment does not heal, you will see from the cause something that cannot be achieved with what we mentioned in the first cauterization with medicine or cauterization with fire. The scalpel must be heated until it turns white, after marking the place of pain with a line the length of half a finger or thereabouts. Leave your hand once and press it until the blood vessel cuts off and reaches the bone.
However, you should be careful not to injure the muscle that moves during chewing, as it may burn the nerve or tendon controlling it, causing paralysis.
And be cautious and watchful of bleeding from the cut vessel, for there is uncertainty in stopping it. Especially for one who is ignorant of what to do and has not been a skilled practitioner, and leaves the work to others first.
And the method of controlling excessive bleeding from the cut vessel will be mentioned on its face in its place in the book, God willing. If you see anything that this chapter does not cover, refer to it.
And if you see the body of the patient as described in this chapter, then treat the wound until he recovers, God willing.
And if you wish, use the method mentioned in the chapter on "Tying Vessels with a Double-Bladed Scalpel," for it is a better and more beneficial method than this one.
The fifth chapter.
On the pains of the ears.
If there is pain in the ear due to cold, apply warm compresses and other treatments mentioned in the previous division. If the pain does not subside, burn a wick called "point" as depicted in this image.
Then, after burning it, daub the entire ear or both ears with it if the pain is in both, as shown here. And keep the wick away from the root of the ear by a little, after you have learned the place by practice, and the wick should be ten drops in each ear or thereabouts. Then treat the places until they are healed, God willing.
The sixth chapter.
On weakness.
The weakness that is treated with cautery is of the type that results from phlegm, as mentioned in the divisions of diseases.
And cautery should be avoided for the type that results from dryness and constriction of the nerves.
When this type of weakness has been treated with ointments, plasters, and fumigations but your treatment did not improve, it is necessary to cauterize the patient with three cauteries. ‌ One at the root of the ear, the second a little below its angle, and the third at the meeting of the lips.
Make a cake from the opposite side of the patient's direction, for relaxation only occurs in the direction that appears correct.
The form of the cake is to be concave at the upper edge of the cheek under the corner of the head slightly, and another one on the chin, and its length should be equal to the length of the temples.
Lower the cake with your hand until it burns a quarter of the skin thickness, and this is the form of the cautery, which is a type of knife whose image has been presented to you, except that it is more delicate than it slightly as you see. The knife should have a slight sharp edge, then treat the area with what has been mentioned until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Seven
Treating chronic ulcers.
If the ulcer persists and you have treated it with what we mentioned, but your treatment does not work and there is no apparent reason for this, then make four cakes of it. Make a cake on each corner of the head, and two cakes in the middle of the head as we mentioned, and one cake at the back of the head as previously described.
The form of the cautery is as mentioned, and a cake can also be made on the stomach, which will be extensive, then treat it as described.
Chapter Eight.
On Forgetfulness.
For the one afflicted with phlegm, it is recommended that he first be given large quantities of water and clean food for the brain.
Then his head should be shaved completely, and the crushed kernel of a walnut, as mentioned in the chapter on seeds, should be placed on the nape of the neck for several times, as it is effective against forgetfulness.
And do this to the crown of the head, just as was mentioned above. If he is cured by it, then well and good; otherwise, place three measures of oil on the nape of his neck, from the top of the head down to the base of the neck.
And place a thickness of one finger's width between each measure of oil. Then treat the neck with what was mentioned before. If you wish to increase it and the patient can bear it, then increase the middle measure.
If you wish to increase it, then apply it to the temples, and continue treating until he is cured. The application should be made with olive oil as previously described.
Chapter Nine.
On Forgetfulness and Weakness of the Entire Body.
It is necessary to first clean the head with water and what was mentioned earlier, then shave the patient's head. Then place one measure of oil in the center of the head, one on each temple, and one on the nape of the neck.
"Three on the cords of the neck, but if needed due to weakness of the body, and if the patient can tolerate it, and the disease is strong and stable, then four cuts on the cords of the back. "And continue cutting until it burns the skin and raises your hand, then treat it according to what was mentioned before until he recovers, God willing, and the bandage should be made of olive oil.
"Chapter Ten.
"Cutting for the spleen.
"A patient whose spleen is enlarged due to phlegm should first have his brain purged using large cupping glasses, along with all the treatments we mentioned in the chapter on phlegm, if the patient is an adult and capable of taking medicines.
"However, if the patient is a child who cannot tolerate medicines, let him use mustard and clean honey for the brain before that, over many days, along with improving his diet.
"Then he should have his head shaved, and make one cut in the middle of the head as mentioned previously in the chapter on cuts, and another cut at the back of the head. "And on each corner of the head, a cut. If the patient is strong and able to tolerate it, then make the cuts mentioned in the chapter on phlegm and weakening of the body on the cords of the neck and the back, and the bandage should be made of olive oil as previously stated.
If the patient is a child, make the bandage soft on this image.
Chapter Eleven.
In the treatment of malignant ulcers.
If the cause of the malignant ulcer is foul humors and thick phlegm, then take the remedies we mentioned in Falij.
If the cause of the malignant ulcer is black bile and the body of the patient is moist, then purge what cleanses the brain as previously mentioned in the division.
Then shave the patient's head. Next, make a tight ring of linen like a circle and lower it onto the middle of his head, while the patient is sitting with his knees bent, holding each side. Then take one pound of old ewe's fat.
Then heat it on a moderate fire until it is hot enough to insert a finger into, then empty it onto the middle of his head within the ring and let it cool. Do this with the patient every week along with the rest of his good treatment until he recovers, if God wills.
And if you wish, you can make it small and numerous without your hand holding the bandage, but let it be soft because this type of dressing moistens the brain moderately.
Then place on it a linen cloth soaked in oil or chicken fat.
Chapter Twelve.
In the case of watery discharge from the eye.
If you observe the beginning of watery discharge in the eye with the symptoms mentioned in the division, then hasten to remove all impurities and moisture from the head of the patient, and bathe it frequently for several days in hot water.
Then shave the head and make a cicatrix in the middle of the head, and if the watery discharge is from both eyes together or one eye alone, then make two cicatrices on the temples.
Then cut all the blood vessels and the veins under the skin with the knife, and let the cicatrices be in the middle of the temples, and take care to prevent bleeding.
If you see anything from it, cut it on the spot with whatever treatment is possible for you, and we will come to the discussion of cutting the veins and preserving from bleeding.
And there may be two large cicatrices in the calves under the ankles.
Chapter Thirteen.
In the case of persistent tearing.
If the tears of the eye are constant and are from before the eyelids and the canals that are on the surface of the head outside the head, and you are certain that this is due to a cold, thick phlegm, then cut the canal that you described with its eye at the beginning of the descending water. There is a canal in the middle of the head, two canals on the cheeks, and two canals in the temples beneath the bones. If there is a need for more cutting, cut a canal on each side from the corner of the eye to the edge of the eyebrow with a small knife.
Chapter Fourteen.
In the nasal canal.
If you treat it with what we mentioned in the section and the treatment does not work, then immediately shave the patient's head and cut the middle canal with an olive knife. Then cut with the screw knife two canals above the eyebrows, a little under the hair, and be careful not to cut the canal; this is the shape of the screw knife.
Chapter Fifteen.
In the canal that causes tearing of the eye.
If the eye tears due to an illness or moisture, cut a canal with this crescent knife.
If you wish, cut it above the cheeks a little, making two cuts on each side, and keep them away from the lips, and let the length of each cut be as long as the cheek.
And do not exceed with the cut, but only to the extent that it burns a third of the skin, and the appearance of the excision will be like this.
Chapter Sixteen
In cutting the eye bag.
If its borders turn inward, then the eye will become sunken; therefore, make the cut in it in two ways. Either cut it with fire or cut it with a burnt medication. As for cutting it with fire, order the patient beforehand to leave his borders alone if he is one of those who plucks them until they become long and even.
If it is sunken at its origin, then tighten the patient's eyes with a bandage so that they do not move until it grows out. When it has grown and evened out, place the patient's head on your lap; then learn to make the eye bag with a pinch, marking a sign in the shape of an oak leaf.
The beginning of the mark should be near the borders, then place a cotton soaked in egg white or in the yarn of blue cloth under the bag. Then heat this excision to its shape.
Then, it is shaped according to the form you have been taught little by little over many times until the surface of the skin burns completely like the shape of an oak leaf, all its appearance and particularly as a sign of the correctness of your work that you see the lid of the eye becomes swollen and the hair stands up from the meat of the eye.
Then, raise your hand at that time and leave it for three days; then apply a cotton cloth with oil until the scab falls off; then treat it with myrobalan until it heals, God willing. If any hair returns after some time and the swelling subsides.
Then repeat the cautery on that spot as you did before. If the hair is in the lower eyelid, perform it until it returns to its natural place and the eye's hair does not bend. As for the cauterization with burnt medicine, instruct the patient to leave the eyebrows alone until they grow long and even.
Then make a figure of an oak leaf from wax, then take from cast soap and from unslaked lime, each one the weight of a dirham or thereabouts; grind them both together thoroughly with a good grinding until it is done quickly to prevent drying out. Then smooth it on the board which is made like a piece of paper, and place it over one or both eyelids, and put under the eye a cotton soaked in egg white, and the patient's head on your lap.
And place your little finger over the medicine and press it slightly, while you move it whenever the patient feels the burning of the medicine, for he finds its burning like fire. As long as he feels the burning, leave the medicine and move it with your little finger. If the burning stops, remove the medicine and wash the eye with water.
And look, if you see the eyelid has swollen as it does when burned by fire or cut, then repeat the medicine on the place where it did not have an effect and did not darken until your work is completed and the eye has healed. Then put cotton with oil on it until the scab of the burn falls off.
Then treat it with almond oil or another until it heals, and it is necessary for you during the work to be extremely careful that nothing from the medicine falls into the eye, for if the eyelid swells after a few days and there is something in the eye, it will be afraid of hair.
"Prepare the medicine on that spot which has been affected by the scab, as you did first, then treat it until it heals, and this is the image of the leaf of the fig.
"And know that the eyes of people may differ in size, so your cautery should be according to that, and it is not hidden from one who has a path in this craft.
The seventeenth section.
"For the treatment of the nostril which is prominent in the corner of the eye.
"If the nostril is treated with what we mentioned in the classification of diseases and the treatment does not work, it is necessary to burn it with this method.
"Command the patient to place his head on your stone, and have an assistant hold his head between you so that it does not move or shake.
"Then place a cotton swab soaked in egg white or in the liquid of crushed barley on his eyes, then use the cautery shown in this illustration.
"It should be hollow like the beak of an eagle, with the burning end on one side; if you wish, it can also have a hole on the other side, and if you prefer, it can be closed like a pearl, except that this hollow one is better for your work, God willing.
Then, you extract the nasal polyp if it is open and remove its soft part. If it is not open, you open it and extract its hard part, then place a splint on it, which is a strong cover, and hold onto it with your hand until it reaches the bone.
And keep your hand a short distance from the bridge of the nose towards the temple to avoid error or frightening the patient, so that the splint does not fall into the fat of the eye and spoil it. If it reaches the bone in the first attempt, then do so; otherwise, prepare the splint again if needed.
Leave it for three days, then apply a cotton swab with fat and treat it with dry myrobalan until it heals. If forty days pass and it does not heal, apply the strong astringent medicine until the bone is exposed, and prepare it as will be mentioned in its chapter, if God wills.
Another method of nasal cauterization mentioned by some earlier authors is to go to the site of the polyp, cut it open, then place a thin tampon in the same opening, as illustrated here.
Pour into it the weight of a dirham of melted lead and hold the tampon firmly with your hand, ensuring that the patient does not move suddenly so that the molten lead does not drip into his eye. It is advisable to place a moistened cotton swab on the patient's eye in egg white or water.
The lead (rasas) burns the place of naswar and heals it with an amazing healing, but if the naswar does not heal as mentioned by kay and treatment, then there is no choice but to use the nose piercing and return the naswar to the flow of the nose in its original place.
The eighteenth chapter.
On splitting the lip.
It is common for splits to occur in the lip, called a fissure, especially in children's lips as it happens frequently. If this split is treated as we mentioned in the section on incisions and the treatment does not heal, then it is necessary to use a small, blade-like knife on this shape.
Its cavity should be on the blade of the knife, then place a protector with a wheel in the same split until the kay reaches the depth of the split, then treat it with the cylinder until it heals, God willing.
The nineteenth chapter.
On cutting the naswar that occurs in the mouth.
If it appears at the root of the tooth, or in the gum, or at the root of the teeth and is inflamed, then swells and bursts and becomes a naswar from the flow of pus, and if it is treated and the treatment does not heal, then it is necessary to use a knife to the extent that fits in the naswar. ‌
Then, place a protective sheath into the wound and hold it with your hand until the iron is safely in its tip and end, and do this once or twice. After that, treat it as we mentioned until he recovers, God willing.
If the ulcer breaks and he recovers, there is no need to uncover the area. Otherwise, it is necessary to uncover the area and remove the rotten bone as described in its section, God willing.
Chapter Twenty.
About rotten teeth and gums.
If the gums are rotten due to moisture and the teeth wobble, and they were treated with medicine but did not heal, then place the patient's head in your lap. After that, take the mold that is shown here after placing the pipe on the tooth.
Place the protective mold with the wheel in it, and hold your hand a little so that the patient feels the heat of the fire reaching the root of the tooth. Then lift your hand, and repeat placing the mold as many times as you wish. Then let the patient rinse their mouth with saltwater. ⟩
He should hold it for an hour and then spit it out, because the wobbly tooth will become firm, the rotten gum will toughen up, and the foul moisture will dry out.
Chapter Twenty-One
"About the pain of the tooth.
"If the toothache is due to cold or there is a worm in it and the medication does not heal, then cut into it in two ways: either by cutting with oil or by cutting with fire.
"As for cutting with oil, it is done by taking fresh cow's milk and boiling it in an iron pot or a plate. Then take a piece of cotton and dip it into the boiled milk and place it on the aching tooth, pressing it until it cools down.
"Then repeat this process until the heat reaches the root of the tooth. If desired, you can dip wool or cotton in cold milk and place it on the aching tooth, then cover it with a heated iron plate until the heat reaches the center of the tooth.
"As for cutting with fire, it is done by taking a copper or iron pipe, and there should be some thickness in its body so that the heat of the fire does not reach the mouth of the patient. Then heat the tip of the pipe as shown in its figure, and place it on the same tooth, holding your hand until the pipe cools down. Repeat this several times.
The pain will disappear either that day or the next, and it is appropriate after this to fill the patient's mouth with good fat and hold it for an hour before expelling it. This is the appearance of the cupping glass.
You may cupping on any side you wish, according to what is possible, and this is the shape of the tube.
Chapter Twenty-Two.
On Cupping Pigs.
If the pigs are not yet fat and free from cold humors, and have not been fattened with medicines, but you want to fatten them quickly, then heat a hollow cupping glass, the shape of which is shown here, with both ends open.
Smoke should exit from the other end during cupping, and cover it with a cloth on the same wart twice if necessary until it reaches the depth of the wart. If the wart is small, make the cupping glass fit the size of the wart.
Then leave it for three days and apply a piece of cotton soaked in fat over it, until what was burned by the fire is gone. After that, treat it with myrobalan and vinegar until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Twenty-Three.
In the throat due to hoarseness and breathlessness.
If the moisture prevails over the base of the nose, especially if this is accompanied by a cold temperament, it is necessary that the patient first evacuate with easy-going medications, then cauterize with a hot iron in the nape of the neck at the root of the hair, in the low place.
Be careful that the cautery does not reach the hair, and do not burn more than half of the skin; then apply another hot iron at the junction of the neck, in the last prominent vertebra, with a cylindrical cautery on the previous pattern.
Then treat him with what has been mentioned until he recovers, if God wills.
Chapter Twenty-Four.
In the treatment of diseases of the nose and ear.
If the ear and nose disease is due to cold moistures, and the patient has no fever or swelling, and the disease is chronic, then cauterize with two irons over the temporal bones in the soft, empty low places, and another iron in the middle of the chest between the breasts.
The cautery should be cylindrical, as mentioned before. If you wish, it can be a point cautery with the point-shaped cautery that has been previously shown for the point cauterization of earache, and there should be thirty points in this manner.
Then treat it with what was mentioned previously until it heals, and a vessel can be made with three tubes on this model, and you hurry with it because you bandage with it in one time three wounds, and this is the image of the vessel.
Chapter Twenty-Five.
In bandaging the abdomen.
If the head of the bone has been extracted due to slippery fluids or has not been fixed when it is returned from being extracted, until it becomes habitual, it should be returned, then removed with the slightest movement that exposes it, as we have seen. First, it is necessary to return the dislocation. Then the patient should lie on their back or on the healthy side, then lift the skin inside the abdomen upwards with the fingers of your left hand if the joint has been dislocated inward.
Then heat the double-tubed vessel, which is shown here.
Then bandage the skin with it until you insert it to the other side, and the shape of the bandage will be four wounds. It can also be bandaged with a vessel of three tubes, in which case the shape of the bandage will be six wounds, and the tubes should be on the edge of the material.
This is the picture of the trephine with three grooves.
And one may exceed this number by one, so that the needles become eight; then put on the eye of the needle a small round pellet mixed with salt; then tie the patient's hand tightly and do not move the limb until it becomes strong, and rarely does this happen if the extraction is above.
Place above the socket one needle that is very good, or several needles that are sharp. Because the joint becomes severe and the moisture disappears, and the patient recovers.
Chapter Sixteen.
In the eye of the needle.
If there is cold and much moisture in the eye of the needle, so that it takes it out of its temperament, and the discharges to it increase, and it was treated with various remedies but did not benefit, then it is necessary for the patient to lie on his back and extend his legs and hands, then he is pierced with three needles. One needle under the breastbone, as much as a finger's length with a trephine, and two needles below on either side of the single needle, so that the shape of the needles forms a triangle, and keep them apart lest they converge if they are deepened, and let the depth of the needle be one-third the thickness of the skin, and this is the shape of the needles.
According to this figure and to this extent, no more.
And if you wish, make a single large stitch in the middle of the stomach according to this figure.
And the needle with which this single stitch is sewn will be in the shape of a circle as shown in this figure.
And the stomach can be sutured with a stent for those who are afraid of this stitch, and that is to mark a spot on the stomach at the desired extent, then sew it with a pointed needle, and treat it with the treatment mentioned until he recovers.
Chapter Seventy-Two
In Cold Cauterization of the Liver
If the liver shows pain due to cold or wetness, or due to a strong wind that has altered its natural temperament to an excessive degree, and if you treat the patient with what we mentioned in the classification, it will not cure him. It is necessary for the patient to lie on his back and mark with a compass three stitches on the liver in this shape and size, directly below the ribs where the human appendix ends.
And there should be a stitch's width between each stitch, the length of a finger, and the stitch should be straight along the body, and do not hold the needle tightly.
And as for how much of the skin to burn, it should not be more than half, and the patient will stand on his feet; if he cannot stand, then he will lie down with his legs stretched out and his arms raised, and this is the image of the stretcher.
It is possible to use the stretcher with a sharp blade, if you have someone skilled and careful with craftsmanship, so that in the cutting you do not burn all of the skin and reach the abdomen, causing harm. For the skin here is thin, be aware of this.
Chapter Eighty.
On the incision and cauterization of the liver.
If there is a discharge on the liver and you want to know whether that wound is in the flesh of the liver or in its capsule, then if it is in the flesh of the liver, you will find the patient with heaviness and severe pain.
And if it is in the capsule of the liver, there will be severe pain with limitation; and you will see that the physicians have harmed his treatment. Therefore, it is necessary for the patient to lie on his back, then learn from the hot spot with a probe.
Then heat the stretcher in the fire, which resembles a pincer, and this is its image. وتكويه بها كيّة واحدة حتّى تحرق الجلد كلّه وتنتهى بالكىّ الى الصفاق حتّى تخرج المدّة كلّها ثمّ تعالجه بعلاج الخراجات حتّى يبرأ.
And this type of cauterization should only be used by those who have practiced the art of medicine for a long time and have experience with such diseases from repeated practice. Then he can perform similar work and leave it to me for better results.
The Twenty-Ninth Chapter
In Cauterization of the Anus
It was mentioned at the beginning of cauterization using dry stalks for the cold anus in this manner, that is, take one long, dry stalk, the longest you can find, as thick as a finger, then soak it in oil and place it in the fire. Then burn one cautery between the attachment of the trachea to the neck, two small cauteries slightly below the armpits inclined towards the side under the arm, and two large cauteries above the breasts between the third and fourth ribs.
Two keys also between the fifth and sixth ribs, slightly inclined towards the back, and another key in the middle of the chest, and another above the liver, and three keys from behind, one between the shoulders, two on each side of the spine below the key that is between the wrists.
And it is not appropriate for your hand with the key to be deep, but rather on the surface of the skin, slightly depressed. Some of the ancients mentioned that some people use a metal probe similar to a needle, and they protect it and insert it between the ribs until it reaches the same worm.
And the probe will come out as we mentioned in the worm of the liver, and in this case with the key there is a danger either that the patient may die from its sting or that a painful swelling may appear at the site which has no remedy.
Chapter Thirty
Key for Hernia
If you have treated the hernia with the treatment we mentioned in the dissection, and your treatment has not been effective, then use the key in it from three aspects, all of which are correct. One is to make three or four small keys along the length of the hernia.
And like the ribs of the liver that precede their form, there will be between each rib and another the thickness of a finger or slightly more. And the nature of the capsule is the same as we mentioned in the ribs of the liver, neither deeper nor shallower, and the image of the patient is lying on his back.
The other side in the armpit and lift the skin adjacent to the axilla where the patient's armpit ends, and lift the skin adjacent to the axilla where the patient's left armpit ends, and your lifting of the skin will be along the body so that the ribs are along the length of the body.
Then the two sutures will enter strongly until they exit with the skin on the other side, then the capsule will come out, making the ribs four; and if you wish to make three ribs with another capsule of three sutures.
Then treat the site of the rib after leaving it for many days, as it is better than any other treatment.
Chapter Thirty-One.
In the Ribs of the Thorax.
The rib is only beneficial for acute abdominal pain, especially if the patient with abdominal pain has been treated with the types of treatment we mentioned in the classification, and your treatment did not benefit, then it is necessary to make four ribs around the umbilicus and one rib on the stomach. ‌
On the liver, a wound; on the diaphragm, a wound; two wounds behind his back between the ribs—one towards his chest, and the other towards his belly—and the depth of the wound will be close to the thickness of the skin, then leave the wound open, allowing the pus to drain for a long time.
And do not let the patient miss any treatment after the wound, so that he may heal quickly; and the form of the probe with which the back is explored will be cylindrical as described before, and the probe with which the chest is explored will be olive-shaped.
Chapter Two Hundred and Thirty-Three.
On wounds of the feet and legs.
If there is pain in the shin and it swells with yellowish water, it should be explored on the back of the foot at the bone that is between the shinbone and the thighbone.
And place your hand with the probe and do not twist it, then lift your hand and do not return it; for this will cause the yellow water to flow out, and the probe should be in this form.
Then explore the legs with two wounds in each leg, and the wound will be at the pointed end of the probe, and the wound will be along the length of the leg—one below the knee, and the other lower down, about halfway along the leg; and on each thigh, two wounds, two wounds. ➤
It is not permissible to leave the nose open for a long time without treatment, as water will drain from it; then treat it with the rest of what we mentioned.
Chapter 33
On the nose's discharge
If the discharge is due to cold and humidity, which weakens the digestive and absorptive powers in the stomach and intestines, treat it with the types of treatment mentioned, but if he does not recover and you see that the patient is capable of enduring a nasal operation, then perform a large nasal operation on him. As mentioned previously, for nasal polyps in the stomach, make a circular incision and four incisions around the nostril using a fine wire probe. Place a large cotton tampon or two on top of the septum.
If you see that the humidity is excessive and the patient can tolerate it, then perform an incision on the nose, an incision on each cheek, and perhaps add two small incisions near the large one on the stomach. This is a successful treatment whose benefit does not fail, God willing.
Chapter 34
On the incision of the hemorrhoidal veins.
If there is a large or single vein in the anus, and it consists of thick, cold humors or corrupt moisture, and you treated it with what was mentioned in the section, but the treatment did not benefit, then incise three incisions on the lower back, slightly below the sacrum, forming a small triangle.
And a swelling under the diaphragm like two fingers, even if you find that his stomach has cooled and his food does not digest, and you see his face pale, open his stomach with a large incision over what was presented, and an incision on the liver. Another [incision] on his flank with a cylindrical needle, and leave the incision open for some time; then treat him until he recovers, if God wills.
Chapter Thirty-Five.
In the incision of the scrotum.
After cutting it, if the scrotum is cut, heat a needle like a millet, then insert it into the same cut scrotum. Continue doing this until the needle reaches the orifice from which blood flows. Do this once or twice.
And if the testicles are numerous, open each one with an incision as we have described, and treat it with suitable ointments until it heals. If you make a large incision on the scrotum, it would be more beneficial.
Chapter Thirty-Six.
In the incision of the penis, which is in the seat and its vicinity.
If the patient is not fit for cupping and the operation that we described in its place, he must be given a laxative, so if any of his wounds or pus becomes severe, let it flow out with the bad humors; first, you should measure him with a thin stick.
Then measure the depth of the wound with the stick, then make a tube that resembles a needle, then insert it into the same wound on the axis of the wound's depth and the measurement that entered with the stick, and apply the laxative until all those bad humors are burned, once or twice, or three times according to your need.
And be careful not to burn the nerve if it is present, or a large vessel, and if the wound extends to the bone of the anus or the bladder.
So beware of all these places, and you only do this if the wound is in a fleshy place and you judge that it will not heal. Then treat the place until it heals, for if the place closes and its materials cease and it remains so for some time, know that it has completely healed.
If the matter does not stop, know that it is a fistula or there is a rotten bone in its neck or something similar to what will be mentioned in its place.
The Seventh and Thirtieth Chapter
In Kidney Pain
If cold or thick smoke causes pain in the kidneys, and the patient becomes weak, it is necessary to place a mustard plaster on each kidney. The method of preparing this plaster has already been mentioned. Sometimes we make three of them at once. Therefore, if you prepare three plasters, they will be more effective.
The Eighth and Thirtieth Chapter
In Bladder Pain
If the bladder has weakness and frequent urination due to cold and humidity, causing the patient not to control urination, place a mustard plaster at the bottom of the abdomen on the bladder where pubic hair begins, another plaster on the right side of the abdomen, and another on the left side.
After the mustard plaster on each side is placed according to the size of the abdomen, place a mustard plaster at the bottom of the back or two plasters if needed, and the method of preparing the plaster has already been mentioned.
The Ninth and Thirtieth Section
In the Treatment of Hemorrhoids
If cold and moisture occur in the hemorrhoids, it prevents the rope from doing its job and spoils its nature, or causes pain when it occurs. It is necessary to make three ligatures around the base, as we mentioned in the treatment of diarrhea. And a ligature on the cotton below the back or two ligatures, and the ligation should be in a spiral shape.
The Fortieth Section
In the Treatment of Varicose Veins
If moisture accumulates in the vein, it can cause it to protrude from its place. Its sign is that the leg becomes longer than the other if some parts stick together, and you will find an empty space at the site of protrusion. It is necessary for the patient to be ligated on the same vein with a circular ligature. ‌
After you have learned to tie a knot around the base as it rotates, making the same base fall into the center of the circle, and the ligation appears as shown in the treatment of hernia. If this ligation is not available, tie three ligatures with a large olive knot.
He made a deep incision on the back of the neck to the extent that the skin was entirely severed, then treated it until it healed, God willing.
Chapter Forty-One
On the Back of the Neck
If pain occurs in the neck due to cold and moisture, and if the patient is treated as mentioned before but does not recover, it is necessary to make the patient avoid heavy foods by consuming honey or apple syrup, and similar.
Then he burns and applies an incision on the back of the neck in two ways: either by burning with medicinal substances, or by burning with fire. The burn by fire should be on many areas, one of which is to burn on the back of the neck itself three triangular incisions as shown in this figure.
It should be incised to a sufficient depth, and the distance between each incision and the next should be about as thick as a finger. The burn should be olive-shaped. A third incision may also be made in the middle on top of the neck itself, making it four incisions. Alternatively, you can make a circular incision as mentioned earlier for removing the neck.
The circle should surround all the work and burn the entire skin fat; this is a characteristic of the ulcer in women's genitals if the pain is necessarily related to the same work and does not extend to the thigh and leg.
And if it extends to the thigh and leg, then make two incisions on the thigh in the place that the patient indicates pain, and an incision above the ankle four fingers towards the inner side a little. The cutting should be like a knife, and the depth of the incision should be only as much as the skin fat.
And if he indicates that the pain extends to near the toes, then make three or four incisions with a pointed knife where he indicates, and if he points to pain under the ankle towards the foot, then make one knife-like incision there.
And it is necessary in all incisions not to cut so deep as to burn a large nerve or vessel, for that would cause the patient great harm or prolonged suffering.
I have seen one and then a second man who was cut above the ankle, and he cut so deeply that the foot became gangrenous until it reached the toes, and all of his foot rotted away, and all his body deteriorated, and then death occurred after that. So if the pain is in both directions, treat them both in this manner at once.
In the art of cautery, some scholars have described a tool made of iron in the shape of a cup with a diameter of half a hair's breadth and the thickness at its edge is less than or equal to a date seed's width. Inside this cup, there are two more cups.
And the distance between each pair of cups is about a fingertip's width, and the cups are open on both sides, and their height is approximately one or two fingertips, and it has an iron handle which fits into the cups, and this is its shape.
Then it is heated in the fire until it becomes red-hot, and the scar tissue is scraped off. Then it is placed on the affected area with the patient lying on the healthy side, so that he receives three circular cauterizations in one session. Then he is left for three days and anointed with fat, leaving the wound open for several days.
Then it is treated with a poultice until he recovers. The author of this book said: we rarely used this type of cautery because of its intensity and its unpleasant appearance, and because few are found who can endure it except that it is one of the best cauteries for those who can bear it and whose affected area improves with it.
And as for the cautery with burnt medicines, it is that you make two cups resembling a ring in which you pour the juice of the plant *Papaver somniferum*.
They will have a height of about two fingers or their equivalent, and the distance between them will be like the thickness of a finger. The bottom will be open, as will the top, and one part will be connected to another in this manner.
Then, place it on the nape of the patient who is lying on his healthy side. Tie his hand firmly, then pour between the two rings water heated slightly by fire and hold it for an hour of sand. The patient will bear the burning sensation as if it were a fire.
Until the burning sensation subsides, then lift the instrument with your hand and wash all the hot water off the nape with cold water. Leave it for three days, and then apply oil until the blackness of the burn disappears. Leave it for as many days as the pus flows out, for this is most beneficial.
Then, treat it with compresses until it heals. If the pain extends to the thigh or shin, a similar vessel is made for him that holds water according to what was done on the nape. This is the nature of hot water, and it has been proven in the treatise on Correcting Medicines.
From the ash of the oven and from unslaked lime, take an equal part of each, grind them together, and put them in a new pot with a small hole at its bottom, just enough for the liquid to pass through. Place another smaller pot underneath it.
Pour water over the ashes and lime until they are completely submerged, then leave the pot until the strong water flows into the lower pot. Collect all of this water and pour it over fresh lime and ashes again.
For then it will be very strong and effective in many surgical operations and for all other body parts, as it acts like fire itself. Among the medicines that also soften the skin are thapsia, honey from the bladder of a pig, lime mixed with soap.
Galen tells a story about an ancient man who treated ulcers and gangrene very effectively, claiming that no other treatment is needed, and that it cures in just one application.
Sometimes he would enter the bathhouse carrying it and come out cured, which is to take fresh green fig leaves; if they are not available, then newly dried ones are taken. Grind them with a little oil and apply on the ulcer, whether on the hand or leg or thigh.
It will be cauterized and left for three hours, or according to what the patient feels is the burning's subsidence, then he will enter the bath. If his body swells, put him in the tub; the pain will leave, and he will recover with God's permission. If not, repeat the cautery after ten days.
For he will recover, God willing. Know that no one should be treated with these remedies unless the body is emptied. Dioscorides mentioned that if the juice of the maez is boiled, it benefits from women's menses.
The cauterization is done in this manner: wool is soaked in old oil and placed on the deep part between the web of the hand and the first finger, closer to the first finger. Then take dry maez root.
Then set it on fire until it turns into a ball, then place it on the wool and leave it until it cools down. Then take another one and continue doing this until you feel the heat in the middle of the finger, and the pain subsides with God's permission. This type of cauterization is called the dry cautery.
The Second and Fortieth Chapter
On the Pain in the Loin
The pain in the loin may arise from numerous causes, such as a fall or a blow, or excessive exertion, and similar circumstances. It can be due to the accumulation of cold, damp material. This type is specific only to this category.
If the pain is due to the accumulation of cold material, it is advisable that after the patient has rested and engaged in gentle exercise, a heated poultice should be applied to his loin where the pain is located, for three rows along the width of the hand, after identifying the spot with light pressure. In each row, five or more warm compresses should be applied according to the strength and condition of the patient.
The pain can also be relieved by cupping the affected spot, and if desired, three or four cuppings can be applied with a medium-sized horn cup in this manner.
The Third and Eighty-Seventh Chapter
On the Pain of the Initial Stage of Hernia
This disease often afflicts young children, and the first sign of it in a child is difficulty breathing when standing or moving, with a swelling appearing at the end of his backbone, protruding over the other vertebrae.
If you see that and want to stop it, cut it with a circular saw in this shape. Take the knife on all sides of the ulcer equally, and if you wish, cut around the ulcer with a circular saw at two or three points. Let the points be close to each other, then treat the area until it is clean as mentioned.
And be sure to use the knife in the hollow that results from the swelling of the nerve.
Chapter Forty-Four.
In cutting the crust and treating joint pains.
If the pains of the joints are due to cold humors affecting any part of the body, if the pain occurs in the legs, then usually doctors call it 'crust'.
If the cold crust is treated by the methods we mentioned in division, and the pain does not go away, then cutting it will remove the pain. This is to cut around the joint of the leg after emptying it with many cuts, and let the saw be medium olive-shaped like this picture.
If you need to cut on the face of the leg, do it with a pointed saw. If the pain ascends to the ankles or to any other joints, which often happens, then cut three or four cuts on each side of every ankle with this olive-shaped saw.
If the swelling extends beyond this, make an incision and do not let your hand go deep with the lancet; it should only reach the surface of the skin. And if the pain rises to the loins or the back, use what we mentioned about the lancet in its chapter.
If the pain is only in the hands, puncture around the carpals as if it were two circles. And if the pain remains in the fingers, puncture each finger at every joint and on the palm of the hand. And if the pain rises after a few days to the forearms or the upper arms
Make an incision on each side, and do not deprive the patient of good treatment and medication, for even if he eats well and purges bile, he will recover with this lancet, God willing.
Chapter Fifty-Four
On the incision of fistulae
If a fistula appears in the anus, and some of the pus and feces flow into the vagina, and this occurs at first close to it, then the patient must be ordered not to eat that day, and she should use suppositories that stimulate evacuation from her bowel.
Then let her lie on her back between your hands and order her to hold her breath until the feces or pus protrudes, then push it back with your finger, then learn to insert under the fistula, under the anus bone, a sign resembling half a circle, its edges towards the top of the body.
Then you should warm the bowl in its form.
Until it comes out white, throw the whey away, then pour water or vinegar back into it, and a servant places his hand on the spot so that the liquid does not come out, as I have opened between the patient's legs and placed a pad underneath, and another servant binds around his leg.
And another one holds his chest, then the bowl is placed on the mark, with your hand holding it upright, and you hold it until it reaches the bone or you repeat the process if it does not reach the bone with the first attempt.
And be careful to prevent the liquid from escaping during cupping, lest it burn the patient and cause death or severe disfigurement. Know that if the cupping does not reach the bone, your work has failed. The cup for children should be fine according to their size, and for adults according to their size.
Then treat the cupping site with fat after three days until the burn marks disappear, then treat it with the rest of the ointments until he recovers. Let the patient lie on his back for forty days until the wound heals.
It is necessary to make his food during his treatment something that softens his abdomen, so that the swelling does not appear when he stands up and is exposed. Then, if he wants to stand after forty days, a tight bandage should be used for another forty days, and it will reduce the burden and fullness from food and drink and excessive shouting.
And if he uses this method in this way, he will be completely cured of the hernia, God willing. I will mention the treatment of the hernia with cautery at its opening, God willing. As for the hernia that occurs in other parts of the abdomen and was initial, if you want it not to increase from him, then cut a circular piece from the hernia according to its size. And let what is burned from the skin be a third of it, then treat it with what we have mentioned, for it will not increase, God willing. Some of the ancients also mentioned cutting the hernia with a triangular incision like this figure.
After you have learned about the hernia by the incision, and the line that runs along the width on the upper side of the hernia, and the other line downwards, lower your hand in the middle with a single circular cut, and the first cut is easier and better, God willing.
Chapter Sixty-Four
In the matter of incision.
If pain and inflammation occur in any part of the body due to a fall or blow, and this pain persists for a long time and does not respond to medical treatment, then it is necessary to make an incision with a lancet. The incision should be made on each limb according to its size, smallness, weakness, and strength.
And if the pain and inflammation are relieved from it, then if he is free from the first incision; otherwise, it should be repeated because these pains usually spread from one limb to what is near it. Therefore, they should be followed by incisions until the patient recovers.
Chapter Seventy-Four
In the matter of incising swellings.
As for swellings, they can greatly benefit from incision, especially the type of swelling that occurs due to the accumulation of pus and black bile.
If you want to incise it, look; if the swelling is in its early stage and has been treated as mentioned in the section on treatment, and if it does not subside or diminish and you fear that putrefaction may spread over all his humors, then make five incisions on top of it. ب The first one is in the middle of the head, and the second below it towards the forehead at the hairline, two on the temples, and one from behind on the knuckle of the big toe, and you squeeze your hand with a little pressure until it affects the bone with a mild effect.
And peel its skin to facilitate the escape of thick vapors from it, and also cook it on the same pot as before. But if the tumor has persisted on the patient and appeared clearly, these compresses that we mentioned on the head must be applied. A compress on the side of the nose, two compresses on the cheeks, two on the neck joints, six on the back joints, one large compress on the back of the neck at the base of the tail, and another above it in the same place, and two on the thighs, one on each thigh. And two on the shoulders, one on each shoulder, and two on the elbows, and two on the wrists, and two on the chest joints, and cook them on each joint of his fingers and toes a compress, and on each heel of his feet and on the palm of his hand.
"And be careful of the nerve that is on the posterior part of the skull, so you don't burn them both. It is possible to hook a hook on the bone of the jaw and another on the mouth of the stomach and another on the liver. And know that the more you increase the hook, the better and safer it becomes.
"Know that the sick person does not feel pain from the hook like a healthy person because his body is weakened, and it is necessary for the hooks to be of different sizes according to the members and joints, as will be mentioned in the descriptions of the irons.
"Then treat the hook with poppy flour mixed with honey and the rest of the treatment until he is cured, God willing.
"The Eighty-Fourth Chapter.
"When a limb becomes weakened and is treated with medications, ointments, and plasters but does not heal, then hook that same weakened limb with hooks according to the size of the bone, whether large or small, and let the hook be strong and firm in the skin a little.
"Then treat it with myrrh until it heals, and it is possible to hook some weakness that afflicts the hand or the foot in the concavities of the back near the exit of the nerve that moves that limb, and the weakness will go away.
And for this, only someone who is knowledgeable in the dissection of limbs and the exits of the moving nerves of the body should proceed.
Chapter Forty-Nine
On the Cauterizing (Cautery)
If the cautery is advanced and it does not heal, then use one of the remedies of medicine on it. If it does not heal, apply a cauterization in it with a shallow depth, just enough to change its color from white.
Then treat it with lentil flour mixed with the fat of the rose, the tongue of a donkey, and the blood of pigeons or swallows, each in equal parts. Mix all together and pour on a cloth and bind to the area until it heals.
Chapter Fifty
On Cauterizing (Cautery) for Cancer
If the cancer is in its early stages and you want to stop it, cauterize around it with a circular cautery as it turns. Some wise men have said to cauterize a powerful cautery in the middle of it, but I do not see that because I expect it to ulcerate, and I have seen this happen many times.
Therefore, the correct thing is to cauterize around it with a circular cautery as we said, or with many cauteries.
Chapter Fifty-One
About the treatment of leprosy.
If someone has leprosy and it delays in healing, whether due to the weakness of the effective agent or because the patient is old with little blood, or due to time passing and you wish for the leprosy to heal quickly, surround them with many small kayyas that are irritating.
Then leave it, for it will hasten healing. If you want to intensify the effect of the kayya, apply it with the makwat that is depicted in this image.
And place it in the center of the leprosy until the skin is softened, and let the kayya be such that it allows for easy flow below. Then treat as needed until recovery.
Chapter Fifty-Two
On the treatment of ulcers.
Ulcers are a putrefaction that strives in the limb to eat it, just as fire eats dry wood. If you see an ulcer in a place suitable for cautery with fire, apply many fine and coarse threads of a makwat to that place where the ulcer is located.
Then burn it from all sides until the putrefaction is completely eliminated, leaving nothing but a scar. Then leave it for three days and apply powdered sulfur mixed with oil to the cauterized areas so that all the sloughing and corruption are removed.
Then treat it with the grafted meat, and if after three days you see that the flesh has grown a healthy plant without decay, otherwise repeat the cauterization on the remaining decayed areas, and the patient may be treated with an astringent drug.
For it is set in the way of fire for a quick benefit, and its treatment with an astringent drug has been mentioned in the division, so take it from there whenever needed.
The thirty-fifth section.
On the cauterization of the nipples, whether inverted or not.
This disease often occurs in the soles of the feet, and it is a rough thing that afflicts man. Cauterization can be done in two ways: either cauterization by fire or cauterization by strong water.
As for cauterization by fire, it is done with a hollow, broad-based iron spatula, resembling an eagle's beak, made to the size that fits around the nipple from all sides and has thin edges. Then, heat it up until it becomes red hot and place it on the nipple, then turn your hand with the spatula around the nipple until the spatula reaches the depth of the nipple.
It is left for three days to absorb the blood, then it is bandaged with breadcrumbs mixed with salt and the bandage is left on overnight, for it will dissolve from its roots. Then treat the wound site with a poultice of meat that has been roasted until it is cured, if the nails are not inverted.
Often there is talk on the surface of the body, especially on the hands and feet. It is necessary to take a tube made of copper, iron, or eagle feathers and insert it onto the nail or the toe. Then pour hot water into the tube in an appropriate amount.
Hold the tube with your hand and rotate it gently with small movements to allow the end of the tube to reach the root of the nail, so that the hot water can flow down to the base of the nail. The patient should wait for an hour, feeling the heat of the water.
Then it is left, and the nail will come out from its roots. Thus, you do this one by one until all are treated in this manner. After they have come out, treat their sites with a meat poultice.
Chapter Forty-Five
For the hernia.
If a hernia occurs due to cold in the nerve, or from a quarter's fever or other causes, it is necessary to place four or five ligatures on the back of the patient between each vertebra and one on the chest. And on his penis, a ligature with olive oil, for the hernia will subside and the cold disease will heal quickly.
Chapter Forty-Six
For the sudden occurrence of hernia in the body.
It may occur in the body with terrible hernias due to cold, thick, and rotten substances. Therefore, as soon as it appears, a fine ligature should be placed on top of each hernia, using a heated needle, the end of long silken threads, or castor oil.
And it may be ligated in this manner at the very first appearance, so that its beneficial effect increases and the patient recovers from it, except that it is necessary for this to be done after purging the patient with a laxative.
Chapter Forty-Seven
For the sudden occurrence of pus after cutting a vessel.
Many times, bleeding occurs from cut veins that have been severed in wounds exposed on the outside or in cuts and ulcers or amputated limbs, and it is difficult to stop it.
If this happens to someone, hurry your hand to the mouth of the vein and place your thumb on it, pressing firmly so that the blood is confined under your thumb and nothing comes out of it. Then take a small and large olive leaf in the fire, several pieces, and blow on them until they become very hot.
Then take one of them, either small or large, according to the wound and the place where the vein has been cut, and press the hot piece onto the same spot after quickly removing your thumb, and hold it until the bleeding stops.
If it continues to bleed when you lift your thumb from the mouth of the vein and the piece cools down, quickly take another hot piece from the prepared pile in the fire, and continue doing this with one after another until the bleeding stops.
And be careful not to burn a nerve, for this will cause another injury to the patient. Know that if bleeding occurs from a vein, it cannot be stopped, especially if the vein is large, except by one of four methods: either by cauterization as we mentioned, or by ligature if it has not yet been ligated. And if the tip is slackened and the bleeding stopped, either by tying with sturdy sutures or applying medications that stop the bleeding and tightening with bandages tightly.
And as for those who try to cut it with a ligature, or tighten it with cloth, or apply burnt substances, and the like, such a vein will rarely be stopped by this method. So if someone finds himself in this situation without a physician or medication present, let him hurry to place the index finger over the wound itself, as we have described.
And he should tighten it strongly until the blood is constricted and covered with cold water over the wound and on the finger, which does not wash off with very cold water. The cold should be persistent until the blood clots and thickens and stops flowing. During this time, one should observe what is needed from cautery or medicine.
Chapter Two.
On fissures, hemorrhoids, fistulas, wounds, and the like.
Khalf said, as mentioned in the first chapter, every disease that can be treated with cautery by fire or burnt medicines has causes and instruments, and I have illustrated this with images from the knee to the ankle.
And I proceed in this chapter with that method, so that it becomes easy for the student to understand.
Before I begin with that, you must know, my children, that this chapter is more deceptive than what is in the first chapter of Al-Kitab.
And for this reason, the caution must be more severe, because working in this chapter often leads to loss of blood, which is necessary for life when opening a vein or artery, draining pus, treating wounds, removing an arrow, incising on a stone, and similar, all of which are accompanied by deception and fear and most of them lead to death.
I advise you to avoid what is deceptive for you, for it may happen in this profession that some people will come to you with various diseases; among them are those who have been tormented by their illness and death has drawn near to them.
Because of the severity of their illness, the length of their suffering, and the inevitability of death indicated by the disease, among them are those who will expend their wealth on you, giving you hope for health, while their illness is fatal. Therefore, you should not assist any of those who come to you with these characteristics.
Do not let your desire and haste overcome your caution, and do not proceed with anything until you have certain knowledge that will lead to a successful outcome. Use all your efforts in treating your illnesses by first acquiring knowledge and being aware of what ensures safety.
For you have in that support for attaining praise, glory, remembrance, and thanksgiving. May God guide you, my sons, to righteousness, and do not deny you the correct path and success. Indeed, that is in His hands; there is no god but Him.
This chapter is divided into sections, as I have mentioned in the previous chapter on surgery from the beginning to the end, so that you may easily find what you seek in it, God willing.
The First Section
In the treatment of water that collects in the heads of children.
This illness often afflicts children at birth if the midwife presses on the child's head too forcefully, and it can also arise from a hidden cause that is not known.
I have not seen this condition in anyone other than children, and all those afflicted by it die quickly. Therefore, I avoid treating them. Indeed, I saw a child whose head was filled with water and swelled every day. Until the young man cannot sit on himself due to the swelling of his head, and the moisture increases until he dies.
And this moisture either collects between the skin and the bone, or it collects beneath the bone on the membrane (dura mater). If the moisture is between the skin and the bone, and if the worm is small, it is necessary to make a single incision in the middle of the head with a width of one finger, and the length of the incision should be about two fingers long so that the moisture can drain. This is the way to treat a skull fracture (or a depressed skull fracture).
If the moisture is more and the worm (tumor) is larger, make two intersecting incisions in this manner.
If the moisture is under the bone, and its sign is that you see the sutures of the head open on all sides, and if water flows down when you press it with your hand, this should not be hidden from you. It is necessary to make three incisions in the middle of the head in this manner.
After making the incisions, all of the moisture will come out, then the incisions should be closed with stitches and bandages. Then, it should be covered from above with water and oil for five days. After that, the bandage should be removed and the wound should be treated with linseed and honey. Do not leave the head tightly bandaged, and feed the patient with all dry foods of little moisture.
To strengthen the limb and heal it, another method of cauterization is to look where the bone marrow appears and the water accumulates, as it may be more in the back of the head or in the front or on the right or on the left.
Then proceed with cauterization where the marrow and water collection have appeared, to the best of your ability, taking care not to cut a vein and cause a hemorrhage that could kill the patient along with the fluid drainage.
Chapter Two.
Cut the veins behind the known auricular (ear) veins.
When someone experiences severe attacks in the eyes or the chest, and the condition persists without improvement from medication, the treatment is to cut these two veins.
If you wish to cut them, it is necessary to shave the patient's head with a razor, then press on the site with a coarse cloth so that the veins appear. Then secure the patient's neck with his garment, and look where the pulse beats; their location is behind the ears and is usually low-lying, although in some people it may be hidden.
And you learn on them with the saw, then you cut them with the scissors to the bone, and this will be across the head. If you wish, you can insert the scissors from below the brain and pull it upwards through the cutting, and the length of the cut will be about two fingers.
For if the nerve is cut, blood will flow out in a pulsating manner, flowing forward and backward constantly. If the brain does not appear to be felt, it should be measured from the ear for three fingers' length, then sawed with the saw and drilled to the bone. And that which should be done is...
Send six cups of blood at intervals, and it might be necessary to send more or less depending on the strength of the patient and the fullness of his brain. Then examine the wound; if there is anything left from the bone cut, cut it off.
So that a hot worm does not appear, and then bandage the wound with a piece of linen cloth, then treat it with poultices until it heals.
Chapter Three.
Evacuate the two brains that are in the ears.
If a person is afflicted with chronic tinnitus, or severe ear drops due to moisture and heat in the muscles of the ears, or severe chronic headaches and the like, and he has been treated with various medical remedies but did not recover, we have tried in these diseases to evacuate the brains from the ears or trephine them as we described.
The method of treating it is for the patient to shave the hair in the armpits and aim at the visible veins in the armpit, for its pulse can be felt clearly, except in rare cases among individuals.
Or if the cold is severe, and it is hidden from you, let the patient wrap his neck with his garment, then feel the place with a needle or compress the area with hot water until the vein appears clearly visible. Then take the lancet of this shape. Then cut the skin with it until you reach the vein, then insert a thread into it and draw it upward until it exits the skin, and clean it of all the valves beneath it from every direction. If the vein is thin, immerse it in the thread. Then cut a piece from it such that its ends can be compressed without causing leakage, for if it is not well-cut and not firmly secured, the blood will not flow at all. Then continue bleeding until six or three goblets are filled with blood.
If the vein is large, it should be tied in two places with a strong double thread, either of linen or from the strings of a lute, so that putrefaction does not occur before the wound heals, causing leakage.
Then cut the thread between the two ligatures; you can do this at that hour or later, and if you wish to tighten it to the bone with a knife-like awl until its ends separate, he will remain in the same condition as this work, whether by eye or better, as we said.
If the patient is feverish or has a disturbed temperament, for cicatrization helps to dry out moisture, he will benefit greatly. After the discharge of the shrapnel, the wound should be covered with soft cotton and firm dressings applied. After healing, treat with astringent medicines that promote flesh growth and with cauterization until recovery, God willing.
If during your work there is discharge from the wound, hasten to cut it off, either by cauterization or by filling the area with vinegar and pressing with your hand until the bleeding stops. If nothing is available for this, place your finger on it until the blood clots.
And pour cold water on the wound until the swelling subsides and press as needed. What is easier and simpler than removing the shrapnel is to cauterize the wound with this knife-like awl after anointing the wound with oil.
And it is lowered with a very strong sheath until it reaches the bone, and the nerve is cut in two places so that what is between its ends separates. For this reason, the bladder does not adhere to this sheath, and this is the shape of the sheath.
The blades are to resemble small scissors, but they must be less sharp than the knife, because if they were as sharp as a knife, cold would come over them too quickly and the flesh would not be cut off swiftly. If there is some dullness in them, the fire's heat will adhere to them.
The flesh is cut quickly, and this work is the best of all works, and the least painful and easiest. There should be between the blades a thickness equal to that of the finger.
Chapter Four.
Treatment for the constant flow of hot tears to the eyes.
If the tears are constant and their flow is from the veins on top of the head from outside, and nothing helps from medical treatment with medicines, and you see the face of the patient has turned red. And he feels on his temples a throbbing like the pulsation of an ant, and his eyes are sunken and wet, having eaten away at their corners and narrowed from the sharpness of the tears, so the ancients were compelled in treating it to this work, which they call "treatment by the sword," and it is that the patient is ordered to shave the hair on his forehead.
Then, make three parallel incisions along the length of the forehead. The length of each incision should be about two fingers wide, with the first incision centered in the middle of the forehead and aligned with the length of the nose, the second slightly behind the muscle in the cheek, and the third on the opposite side.
Be careful not to cut the veins that are on the sides, and keep your hand away from connecting the jaws. The distance between each incision should be three fingers wide, and have with you pieces of soft sponge or abundant cotton to absorb blood.
Then, insert the sharp-pointed probe into the edges as shown in this figure. From the incision next to the cheekbone to the middle incision, and scrape with it all the skin that is between the two incisions along with the periosteum on the bone. Then do the same from the middle incision to the third incision, then remove this probe. Then, insert another instrument called a sharp knife from one side and smooth but not sharp on the other side into the first incision. Here is its image:
With its sharp side towards the muscle attached to the skin and its smooth side towards the bone, push it until it reaches the middle incision. Then cut with it all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes without cutting through the surface of the skin.
Then do that in the middle gap to the other gap, and after a moderate amount of blood has drained, squeeze the places from clotted blood, then place on each gap a pad of cotton wool soaked with drink or oil and vinegar.
In order to prevent a hot inflammation, and on the third day, wash the bandage and use abundant irrigation with pure water. Then treat it with basilicum ointment made of rose oil, and with what is used for other wounds until he recovers, God willing.
Chapter Five.
In the treatment of tears and secretions from the eyes coming from within the head.
When it happens to someone that there are copious, violent, and constant discharges from the eyes, which makes the eyes appear with small, prominent pustules and their vision is weakened, and the eyelashes fall out. And there is deep, painful headache and continuous cough, know from these signs that those substances and secretions come from many deep vessels. The best treatment for this is as follows: order the patient to shave his forehead, then make one incision in the middle of the forehead.
And there is deep, painful headache and continuous cough, know from these signs that those substances and secretions come from many deep vessels. The best treatment for this is as follows: order the patient to shave his forehead, then make one incision in the middle of the forehead. And raise it slightly with the width, and begin the incision from the left cheek to the right cheek, and the incision will be to the bone, and keep your hand away from the mobile cheek muscles when chewing until the bone is exposed and all the blood is absorbed by the sponge.
So separate the edges of the incision with clean cotton or a linen bandage, then cover it from above with bandages and soak the bandages in drink and oil to prevent hot inflammation. And when you remove them, if you see that the hot inflammation has subsided, it is necessary to palpate the bone until growth of the flesh begins on it.
Then treat it with dry dressing that promotes flesh growth, such as taking two parts of wheat flour and four parts of alum, mixing them together to make a poultice and applying it to the growing flesh in such wounds.
Chapter Six.
For treating what falls into the ear.
Whatever falls into the ear is one of four types: either a mineral stone or something like a stone, such as iron and glass; or a plant seed, such as a chickpea or a nut; or something liquid, like water or vinegar.
And if it is an animal, when a stone or something like a stone falls into the ear that does not grow in the ear, expose the ear to the sun. If you see the stone has absorbed some oil from the fat or almonds, try to remove it by moving the head or blowing with a pipe. And block the nostrils when a cold comes by placing a ring of cloth or wool around the ear, and lift the ear upwards. This treatment often removes it; if not, try to remove it with gentle suction using this device.
And if it does not come out with suction, try to remove it using a fine, slightly moistened, dark glass tube. If it still does not come out, then make a copper pipe and insert the end of the pipe gently into the ear hole.
And seal what is around the pipe with greased wax, so that there is no other path for the air except through the pipe. Then suck strongly and it will often come out this way. If it does not come out as described, take some birdlime or prepared birdlime, which is used to catch birds, and place it on the end of a reed.
After placing a firm cotton pad on it, then inserting it into the ear canal with a probe after drying the ear from moisture, if it does not come out along with everything we described, hurry to the doctor before the hot inflammation or blockage occurs.
The treatment is to weaken the patient by bloodletting as much as possible, then have him sit between your hands and tilt his ear upwards, and make a small incision at the base of the ear where it is most depressed.
The incision should be crescent-shaped, reaching the bone, then remove it with whatever tools you can, then suture the incision quickly and treat it until he is healed.
And if what fell into the ear is one of the seeds that grow and swell, try to remove it as mentioned earlier. If it does not come out, then take a thin, delicate blade like this.
Try to cut that type of seed that fell into the ear with it, and you only do this if you are sure that the seed has absorbed the vapor of the ear until it becomes many small pieces, then remove them with a dark probe or a thin swab or with cotton.
As we have mentioned, it is easy to expel it, and as for the water inside the ear, it is best for the patient to use syrup of violets first, after he has filled his ear with some cotton wool while lying on that ear which contains the water, and it will come out by doing so.
Then, take thin, soft splinters the length of your fingers, heat them slightly with fire and insert one into the ear hole, then place a pebble on that foot and strike with another stone on the stone in the ear.
He continues to do this with one splinter after another until all the water comes out. The water can also be removed by taking a feather or a single piece of hair, inserting its tip into the ear and burning the other end with fire until most of it burns, then replacing it with another feather.
He does this repeatedly until all the water comes out, or it is sucked out with a syringe as mentioned in the splinter section. As for removing an animal inside it, if it is small like a flea or similar, treat it as mentioned in the section on cauterization and so on.
If its body is large and palpable, try to remove it with tweezers and hooks; this is easier than anything else that grows in the ear. As for removing maggots born in the ear, if you treat it with what we mentioned in the section on head lice and it does not heal,
Then look at the ear in the sunlight; if you see anything from the maggots, remove it with tweezers or thin hooks. If nothing appears to you from it, then take this tube-shaped instrument.
The end is narrow and the top is wide. Insert the thin end into the ear according to what the patient can tolerate, then squeeze it strongly several times until all the maggots come out. If they do not emerge, seal around the tube with wax as I mentioned for earwax.
If they do not come out with what we mentioned, then use the ointments that I have described for killing maggots, which the ancients have tested and found effective. You will find this in the chapter on ointments. Squirt the ointment and medicine into the ear with this instrument, as shown in the diagram.
As you see, it is made from silver or copper, narrow at the bottom and wide at the top, with a small hole in it. If you wish, let the plunger inside the tube be made of hard copper. Alternatively, you can take a reed, wrap its end tightly with cotton.
Then take the oil or extract in the pipette, which is in the ear, then insert the cotton with the swab from above and squeeze it with your hand moderately until the oil flows into the ear canal and you hear it.
Give it to the patient orally, and ensure that what is poured into the ear has been slightly heated in the fire, and be careful not to let what is poured in it be very cold or very hot, for the ear cannot tolerate this.
Chapter Seven.
On treating the obstruction in the ear.
Some children may come out of their mothers' wombs with their ear canals not perforated.
There may also be obstruction in the ear canal for some people due to a cut or growth of flesh, and this obstruction can be deep in the ear canal that cannot be seen by sight.
And what appears outside the canal a little and is visible by sight, that which appears deep in the ear and cannot be seen will be in most cases difficult to treat. What is visible should have the patient's ear placed in the sun. And you should look at it, for if you see the obstruction clearly, open it with a soft probe of this shape:
The edge of it should have some small width, limited to part of it, and the rest of the wound should be soft on both sides so that the ear is not harmed. If the swelling has formed in the course of the ear, hold it with a fine forceps and cut it off with strong scissors until all the flesh is removed.
And if the swelling is deep in the ear, take a fine and soft spatula, heat it slightly in the fire, then insert it into the course of the ear. If you feel the swelling along with what the patient finds of heaviness in the hearing, then cut it off with scissors.
And be careful not to cut the nerve of the ear, then insert a wick into the ear according to the size of the hole you made in it and soak it in honey as is done in Egypt, doing this daily until you are sure that the wound has healed, or take a wick and dip it in water and place a powdered plaster on it.
And use it, and if you see the ear has become inflamed with a hot ulcer, then it is necessary for the wick to come out and replace it with another wick that has been soaked in rose oil until the hot ulcer subsides, then continue treating it until it heals.
If there is a rupture of blood, soak a sponge or cloth in cold water and place it on the ear, and use the rest of the treatment that cuts off the mentioned rupture as described in the chapter on cataplasms.
Chapter Eight
In the treatment of hemorrhoids that occur in the anus.
These hemorrhoids that occur in the anus can be either moist or dry. It is necessary to grasp them with a clamp or forceps and cut them off at their roots, then apply powdered alum to the place.
If blood oozes from them, cover them with a thin glass cupping vessel and cauterize them after cutting, for they often recur if any of their roots remain. If burned with fire, those roots will be destroyed and will no longer exist.
Chapter Nine
In the treatment of severe cold in the anus.
Often, something resembling cold occurs in the anus in its severity and hardness.
And for this reason, it is called cold, and it is a collection of thick fluid in the upper and lower anus, and its action is that if you see that the coldness is prominent on the surface of the anus, moving to all directions, then its treatment is easy; cut it with a broad incision.
Then peel it from all sides with a hook until it is released, then hang it by the silkworm and cut it off. If he did not prepare for cutting it except after the silk is pierced by the cutting, that does not harm the patient at all. If the wound is large, gather it together with stitching and treat it until it heals.
And if it is small, do not worry about it, for the membrane will force and attach it. If the skin tends towards the inside of the cocoon towards the inner surface, turn the cocoon and hang the skin with a silk thread without needing to cut and gather from all sides.
If the cocoon is pierced by cutting, that does not harm at all. Then wash the eye after cutting the skin with salt water and treat the place with what sticks until the patient heals.
Chapter Ten.
In the treatment of the stylet that appears in the eye's cocoon.
A stylet is a pimple that forms in the upper layers of the eye's cocoon, and it occurs more commonly in children. It causes their eyes to feel heavy, and they may experience tears during the daytime; they cannot look at the sun. For tears hasten to them.
And that is why you see them constantly leaning on their faces, and they sleep on them, and the rims of their eyes are wet from weeping and congestion, clearly visible to the eye. When you press the place with your fingers, you feel the swelling between them, and the way to work is for the patient to put his head in your lap.
Then take a piece of cloth and prepare a bandage from it, and make from that bandage a circle to the size that fits the swelling from all sides, then place it on him and press with your fingers from all sides to gather the swelling into the center of the circle.
Then make a cut in the middle of that moisture with a pointed knife, making a cut wide but not deeper than the cut made in the flesh, and as for depth, it is necessary to cut all the skin until you reach the swelling.
In most cases, the swelling protrudes from the cut like a piece of white fat. You attract it with a cloth that you have rolled between your fingers outside, and as you turn your right and left hands until it is free, be careful not to deepen the cut lest the knife touch the eye and injure it.
If the hernia does not appear at the first cut, it is necessary to increase the cut slightly with a cautious hand until the hernia appears; then draw it out as we have said, and soak it in vinegar and water, and place it on the wound and press it with a bandage. And some people crush salt.
And he puts it in the cavity of the wound to absorb any remaining moisture, then he treats it until it is healed. If there is a hot ulcer on the wound, he treats it with soothing ointments until it is healed.
Chapter Ten.
In Types of Cauterizing the Eye.
If a superfluous vein grows in the angle of the eye outside of its natural course under the natural veins, it causes harm to the eye and generates diseases such as constant tears, redness of the corners of the eyes, whiteness, and thickening until it becomes a cause for the loss of vision.
Cauterization of the eye is done in four ways: either by branding with fire, or with a corrosive drug as mentioned in the chapter on branding; or it can be cauterized by cutting and suturing, or by using a reed, as I have described.
You should place the patient's head in your lap, then turn their eyelid with your left hand. If it turns outward, otherwise insert a needle from below the eyelid and pierce the needle through the thread from above, and that will be close to the same hair. Pull the thread upwards with the eyelid.
Turn it with the scissors, then cut into the inside of the eyelid without the excess hair with a curved needle from the larger canthus to the smaller canthus. Then thread the thread and place a small cotton or linen pad under the eyelid, then suture the eyelid with a silk thread.
Like a leaf of bread, except that the shape should be according to how much you want to raise the eyelid, because people differ in this regard; some need to cut part of the eyelid so that it matches the degree to which the eyelid has been stretched.
And some need to cut less than that according to the degree of stretching of the eyelid, then cut with the needle along the two lines you marked, starting from the larger canthus to the smaller canthus, and let there be one cut close to the natural hair, similar to the sharpness of the scissors.
Then the needle is inserted into one of the corners of the skin, then it is all cauterized, then the two lips are united with a thread and fine woolen thread, and the blood is washed away, and any remaining threads are glued to the temples with some adhesive things.
If you wish to do so, it makes no difference; otherwise, leave it alone. The stitching and threads should be left in place for three or four days, then treat the wound. If you prefer not to stitch the wound, treat it with something that dries and closes, for drying raises the swelling when the wound is closed and united; stitching is better.
This method of cauterization, which I mentioned earlier, has the advantage for the patient that it is an excellent technique with no danger in it. Another method of cauterization is to burn a shape on the swelling like the shape of an ace of cups as we have described. Then the swelling is raised with three needles that are separate or grouped as shown in this picture:
Then, the remaining swelling is cut with a small scissors as shown in this picture, cutting carefully:
If you cannot fix the needles and do not have a thread with a needle in it, then take a thread with a needle and insert it into the center of the shape, and insert another thread near the larger triangle and a third thread near the smaller triangle, and carefully unite the threads between your fingers, then raise your hand with them evenly.
Lift the skin that was described on it, all of it, then close the edges of the wound with sutures and treat it until it heals. If a hot burning pain appears after your cutting or scraping, soothe that pain with kierota and similar resins from the anesthetics.
If the lower jaw also shows swelling to the point of displacing its teeth, it is necessary to use what we mentioned about cutting, suturing, cauterizing with fire or a sharp medication. The cauterization should be extensive and mild on the patient from cutting and suturing. In both cases, perform accordingly.
Cauterization with a reed will be done in this manner: turn the jaw, scrape the cavity that was described inside it, then make two thin reeds or sticks, their length equal to the length of the jaw and their width less than the width of a finger.
And two holes are made on each side of them from both directions where the sutures grip, then they are gently joined over the excess part of the eyelid and the two reeds are pressed firmly and tightly from both sides. It is left in this state for several days, as the compressed skin will die and turn black and putrefy.
Until it falls off by itself, if it delays, bandage it with a compress then treat it until it heals. If the swelling subsides and the eyelashes do not stick together, this is the appearance of the two small rods that are made in this shape and size in length and width as shown:
Chapter Twelve.
Lifting Napped Eyelashes with a Needle.
If the task involves one or two eyelashes, take a fine needle and insert into it a thread of soft, fine silk. Then gather both ends and tie them with a very small knot, ensuring the length of the thread is about one finger breadth.
Then, place another fine thread in the hollow of the needle below the knot and tie its ends if desired. The patient should then lie down with their head on a sunlit stone so that the work can be seen clearly, for it is a delicate task. Insert the needle with the threads into the root of the excess eyelash.
Then, pass it through the swelling with a wheel until it emerges above the natural lash. Next, pull the thread up to the top of the needle and insert that eyelash, whether one, two, or three, no more.
Then draw your hand with it until the hair comes out with the threads from the cyst along with the natural hair, for if you have drawn the threads and the hair has not come out with them, draw the threads downwards with the needle that you have fastened in them until they come out of the upper opening.
Then replace the hair in it and draw both out until they reach the upper opening, at which point you will see them with your eyes. At that moment, slacken the threads and the needle, remove them, and close the eye, leaving it closed for one or two days so that the hair can reattach to its place and the flesh can grow over it.
If the hair is short, then either add a long natural hair to it so that it can be lifted with it or leave it until it grows longer after which you lift it.
Chapter Thirteen
On treating the cyst that occurs in the upper eyelid.
The one who is afflicted with this cyst is called a "rabbit" and this cyst can be either natural or acquired. Acquired ones come from the union of a wound, cut, or similar.
The method of treating it is to split that swelling and separate its lips, placing between them a bandage of cotton and tying it until it heals, and it is not appropriate to use in its treatment things that dry or constrict.
Therefore, if you do that, the swelling will return worse than before. Instead, use things that soften such as linseed and warm water in which althaea and flax seeds have been boiled with a little honey, and treat it with this.
Its treatment is to soften with all possible means so that it does not return to its previous state, and this method which we have mentioned is only a correction of the swelling, not a restoration of the place according to what it was originally.
Chapter Fourteen.
The treatment of the swelling that occurs in the lower jaw.
This swelling that occurs below is what is called a real abscess, and it can be natural or traumatic. The traumatic type results from a wound, cut, or the like.
The method of treating it is to take a double-threaded needle and stitch it into the flesh, passing it from the left canine tooth to the right canine tooth until the thread emerges from both ends of the flesh. Then, pull the flesh up with the needle and cut it off with a wide scissor.
If the shape of the chin returns to its proper form, and if not, then take a mullein stalk and place it on the cleft site, and use it to turn the cleft, and make two cuts inside the cleft from the chin, so that the ends of the two cuts are at the angles of the cut you made, until they meet, and thus a corner is formed. until when they meet it will resemble this shape:
and it is the Greek letter L, then that flesh is removed as much as its hard side is below where the chin is, then the separated parts are gathered by two stitches sewing it with wool thread, then it is treated with the mentioned ointments and pitch until it heals.
And if the cleft appears from the cleft, or stitching, or scar, it is necessary to make a simple cut without cutting the hair follicles, as mentioned before, then separate the two lips with pitch, as we have said.
The sentence regarding the treatment of the cleft, whether it is above or below, is to perform the procedure according to how you prepare for its shape, as it may vary greatly in appearance. The craftsman chooses the method that suits him best.
Until the shape returns to its natural state or approaches it, and the same disease guides you on what is suitable for it in terms of work and instrument in most cases.
The fifteenth chapter.
In sticking, the eye is glued with mullein or with alkali.
This adhesion may present difficulties for many people, as the upper glue may stick to the white of the eye and prevent it from moving easily, thus hindering its natural functions; therefore, a tip of cotton should be inserted under the glue.
And it is raised up or extended with a probe, then the adhesion is cut with a fine scalpel that is not too sharp; rather, it should be slightly blunt so that the patient does not become anxious during the procedure and the scalpel slips and hurts the eye with its sharpness. Your cutting should be as if you are scraping off that adhesion.
Then wait until when the glue returns to its natural state and all of the adhesion is gone, then you should sprinkle salt water on the eye to wash it or pour over it a diluted solution of zinc oxide in water. Then separate the glue from the eye with a cotton swab.
A wool soaked in egg white is placed over the eye, and after the third day, soft compresses are used until it heals.
The Sixteenth Chapter
In cutting the ear and removing the flesh of the temples.
The ear is divided into two types: either it is nerve-like, resembling a thin hard membrane, or it is non-nerve-like, resembling firm white jelly. If iron touches it or if it is pierced with a needle, it will be cut.
And in neither type has a vein been found. Both types begin from the greater temple, and they are gradually reduced until they cover the eyelid and prevent light and eye movement. The method of cutting it is that the patient places his head on your rock.
Then he opens his eye, and you raise the eyelid with your hand, then catch the ear with a small needle, and extend it upwards. Then take a thread and insert into it a hair from the tail of a horse or cow and strong thread, and slightly bend the end of the thread, and sew it in the middle of the ear.
And you pass the needle through it and tie the ear with the thread, and extend it upwards, and shave the side of the ear towards the temple as if you were combing it to its end with the hair. Then cut the rest at the root of the temple with a fine scissor or small shears, leaving the natural flesh of the temple.
And thus, it will not present a silvery permanent scar, and the edge has been trimmed with scissors or thread as we mentioned, then cauterized with soft metal on this edge.
And it is necessary that the cautery does not touch the horny membrane, as this causes a cleft and separation of the eyelid. After cutting, place some powdered salt or Chinese alum on the eye and leave it until the next day, then treat it with what is needed until it heals.
If the edge is not fleshy and cannot be penetrated by a needle or retained by scissors, this type of edge is often treated with medication to heal as described in the section on medication. If you wish to cut it, open the eye of the patient.
Take a delicate, soft cautery with a fine edge like this: Trim the edge with it from above gently, and if you see that it becomes lacerated or loose, sprinkle some Chinese alum or red alum or powdered salt in your eye from your hand, and close the eye until the next day.
Then, continue working on it until all of them are gone, except if something interferes in the eye and a hot worm appears. In that case, leave it alone and treat the hot worm until it heals. Then, resume working on it with cauterization until it heals. As for a piece of meat stuck in the throat.
Then, if the stuck object causes severe pain in the eye, tie that stuck object with a ligature and cut part of it off, taking care not to cause excessive bleeding during cutting. After that, drop the blood-red saffron or henna juice into the eyes until they heal.
Chapter Seventeen
Concerning the excision of warts and the growth of excess flesh in the eye.
Some people may grow red, protruding flesh in their eyes that covers the pupil or comes close to it and flows onto the whites of the eye. Sometimes the whites of the eye may turn outward, resembling a pomegranate flower.
The treatment for this is to have the patient place his head on a stone, then open his eyes and remove all of the red flesh with fine forceps appropriate for this purpose.
Or hold it with a probe or tweezers, then cut the first part of it until all of it is cut off, taking care not to harm the eye during treatment. Your cutting instrument for this should either be a cautery, as we described for cutting the wart, or a small scissor. Here is the translation of the given excerpt: "As shown in the figure below.
"If your eye has been cut and all the blood vessels have been severed, then fill the eye with finely powdered salt or put a few drops of red vitriol or similar cauterizing medicines in it, and place over the eye from the outside a patch made from the white part of an egg to protect against hot inflammation.
"If some of the blood vessels remain and you are bleeding a lot, fearing hot inflammation, then leave the eye alone and treat it with what alleviates inflammation, then repeat the procedure until it heals. Do the same with excess flesh that protrudes from the eye in this manner.
"But it is necessary for you to avoid treating every weak eye by cauterization or by applying iron through surgical incisions, and do not put your hand in any of these matters until you see that the member is suitable for this procedure.
"Chapter Eighteen.
"On the Removal of Cataracts from the Eye.
"The cataract is a red vein that forms on the eye, obstructing vision and weakening the eye over time. Therefore, first ensure that the eye with the cataract is strong and has no other disease besides the cataract.
And then, if the patient is ordered to place his head in your stone [mortar], then tie those veins with a single thread or two according to your skill, and let the threads be delicate for this purpose.
Or let them be two threads doubled in one body, like this:
Then, cut with a fine scissor those veins gently and wipe the blood at intervals until you see that the vein has been completely emptied of blood. Be careful not to injure the eye with the edges of the scissors, and do your work during the afternoon when the sun is declining.
And be very careful in your work so that you do not cut anything other than those veins, and when you finish, sprinkle green or red myrtle on the eye to eat what remains of the veins. If you cannot completely remove them in that hour, bandage the eye with something that will cause pain to the eye.
And leave it for days until the pain subsides and the inflammation passes, then repeat the work on it in the same way until this image of the cutting pain leaves it.
The patient's head should be placed in the student's lap, with the latter wiping away tears and obtaining the linen cloth at the front of the eye and behind it. The essential point in this procedure is to open the eye with sutures or triangular flaps that the student holds.
Prick and let the patient's head rest in the student's lap, with the latter wiping away tears and obtaining linen cloths at the front of the eye and behind it. You have the choice to begin by cutting from the top of the eye or from its bottom. The first should be a thread placed at the end of the eyelid, and the second in its beginning.
Hold them between the middle and corner, then place threads under each of them. Then hold them between the outer corner and inner corner, and gently move your hand until you see that all the sutures have been raised. Cut from the end of the shortest thread, whether with scissors or a fine knife.
And the needle is inserted on its thread, and all the sutures are tightened until they rise on the eyebrow, without cutting the threads, for tears and blood will sting you.
Then cut with the scissors whatever exceeds the eyelid from above and below, so that nothing remains but at the corner. If you can lift it from the corner, it is better to puncture it with a needle. This can sometimes cause infection in some people.
And if it is cut, it will be painful for as many days as it lives, and the hot worm prevails; then repeat the operation on it.
Chapter Nineteen
On returning the hairs to the nose.
The physicians call the hair "nassura". If it is treated with caustic or with a hot sharp drug as previously described, and it does not heal, then there is no cure for it except to burn the worm when it is mature and extract all the moisture in it or the pus.
Until the bone is exposed. If, after exposing the bone, you see any decay or blackness in it, then scrape it with this instrument depicted here.
It is called the "ras" and is made of Indian steel. Its tip is rounded like a drill, and it has a fine carving like that of the scalpel or lancet. Place it on the decayed part of the bone, then rotate it between your fingers while holding your hand lightly until you know that the decay has been scraped away.
Do this repeatedly, then treat the place with dry and astringent medicines. If the place is closed and flesh grows in it and the flow of pus stops, and it remains for forty days without recurrence or infection or incident occurring.
Familiarize yourself with the fact that it has been cured; otherwise, there is no cure for it except to return the bone to its place in the nasal cavity by exposing the second bone either by iron or sharp medicine. If the bone is exposed, take a swab like this:
The tip of the hook should be triangular and its body cone-shaped, narrowing to the tip as you see. Then place it on the bone itself, near the nasal cavity, but slightly away from your hand's reach towards the eye. Then push with the swab until the bone is inserted and the patient feels it.
The smell should come out when he holds his hand over his nose. At that moment, force the area with the constricting dry medicine as I have taught you. If the flesh grows and the place hardens, then the matter that was protruding will return to the nose, which will be less painful for the patient, God willing.
Chapter Twenty.
Return of the eye socket.
If the eye socket collapses with its contents and there is no defect or loss of vision, it is necessary to ease the patient and then make an incision in the cheek. Then place a dressing in the cavity without any condition, and apply a thin ointment.
Then place on the eye a compress made of agave, sponge, honey, and annatto, then bind the eye from above onto the head with many bandages, and the recipe for the bandages is to take much soft ashes, so that each piece is stretched over four threads made from it.
Then place one over the other according to what the eye needs, then bind it with a stiff bandage, binding strongly. Repeat the cautery without restriction. Then remove the bandage and leave the eye bound for a day and a night.
If the bandage becomes loose during this time, it is necessary to bind it tightly again. Then remove the bandage after a day and a night as we have said. If you see that the eye has returned to normal, if not, repeat the headband, the bandages, the binding, and the cautery until it returns.
The Twenty-First Chapter.
In Cutting the Frenulum.
If a split appears in the frenulum, then protrudes and emerges from between the lips resembling a grape and distorting the appearance of the mouth, and you intend to cut it, the procedure for this is as follows:
The needle is inserted into the root of the vein from below to above, then another needle is inserted with a double-threaded thread from the side of the finger and it is pulled out, leaving the first needle in its place.
Then the place where the double thread is knotted is cut, and some of the vein around the needle is tied to it with a firm knot. The needle is then removed and a wool compress soaked in egg white is placed on the eye, leaving it until the threads fall out with the vein. Then the eye is treated with what strengthens it.
So that the wound may heal, and the vein may be tied from both sides with a circular thread until the eye becomes firmly attached. Then it is covered with a thin cloth extending to the bottom of the eye to drain the egg white liquid, then the eye is lowered and placed in its original position, and it is tied until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Two.
On the treatment of hemorrhoids.
This ailment which is called hemorrhoids is nothing but an accumulation in the eye that resembles flowing water, except it isn't. The way to deal with this is for the patient to sit on an upright chair, then take his head with both your hands.
And move it until you see the lens move down with your eye, then it will stop and not flow, and light will be released and the patient will see things as he used to see them. If it does not descend, we know that it is water, so if it does not prepare for the descent of the lens as mentioned.
And if not, then let the patient sit between your hands. Then take a thin knife and cut through the hard palate slightly where the uvula meets the hard palate in the velum until the lens is released.
Then when it comes out, drip hot water mixed with honey or water in which a lupine bean and honey have been boiled into the eye. Then treat him with the rest of the treatment until he is cured.
Chapter Thirty-Two.
We have mentioned the types of water in the section and which one is suitable for instilling in the eye with clear and detailed speech. So you should take it from there in a healthy state. At that time, the patient should sit between your hands facing the light near the sun.
Close the healthy eye and compress it firmly. Then raise the lid of his eye with your left hand if the eye with water is the left eye, or with your right hand if it is the right eye.
Then place the cup near the lacrimal duct with thick juice, in the same white of the eye from the side of the smaller eyelid, then push the cup firmly while turning it with your hand until it penetrates into the white of the eye and you feel that the cup has reached an empty space.
The cup should penetrate to a depth equal to the distance from the eyebrow to the end of the black part, which is the eyelid of the eye. For copper is seen in the same observer as if it were transparent. Then place the cup above where the water is located.
Then press it down repeatedly, for if the water descends from its opening, the patient will see what his vision has opened from its opening and the cup on his eye, then rest briefly, for if the water rises, descend a second time without removing the cup.
If it stabilizes and does not rise, remove the cup gently while wiggling your hand slightly, then dissolve a little bit of pure salt in water and wash the eye from inside. After that, place cotton or wool soaked in water on the outside of the entire eye.
We smear it with dye and egg white, and we attach the healthy eye to it. As for us and our contemporaries, we place crushed cumin with egg white on it. If the cup does not fit into the eye due to its hardness, because some people have very hard eyes. It is necessary for the dyer to take the plant called berberis, and this is its image:
Then he pierces the same spot and does not add anything to the hole, except that it is only for the cup to find a place in which to enter. After that, you insert the cup as mentioned, and when your work is complete, prepare a bed for the patient to sleep in a dark room on his back.
And he must abstain from all movement and sneezing, and his food should be softened according to its nature, and he should not move his head to the right or left at all. The bandage should remain on him until the third day, then remove it in that dark room and test his vision.
After that, he will see things; then return the bandage until the seventh day. It is not appropriate to do this during treatment or after removing the cup from your hand, but it is necessary to avoid this beforehand because water rises quickly with intense gaze.
If a hot wound or ulcer appears, it is necessary to bandage the eye before the seventh [day] and this can be achieved with what settles the worm until when it settles then you will release its vision and place on the face a covering that protects its sight from beneath for days while he is in that dark room. Then...
He exits the house gradually and moves about in its surroundings. Know that the cup is not sufficient for the learner without repeated observation, so when he approaches work, some Iraqis mention that they make a perforated cup in Iraq that absorbs water.
And I have not seen anyone in our country make this, nor have I read about it in any of the ancient books. It may be a recent innovation. Here are images of various types of cups for those who are unfamiliar with them.
They are made of copper and have a triangular point like this, with sharp corners.
Chapter Twenty-Four.
On the Treatment of Meat Growing in the Nose
Various types of excessive flesh may grow in the nose, some resembling many-legged scorpions; others are cancerous and ulcerated, appearing like a deep red color; still others are soft but not as dark as the previous type.
And whatever of these meats is soft, it is not bad or cancerous. So the patient should sit between your hands facing the sun and open his mouth, then catch the sunlight in those meats; then draw it out and cut off what you have caught from it with a fine, sharp blade on one side.
Until you know that all the flesh has gone; and if there is something left which you cannot cut, then scrape it with one of the fine scraping instruments until nothing remains of it; and if blood or a hot ulcer overpowers you.
Then deal with it as is appropriate, or if it was one of the bad ulcers, then hurry to cauterize it until the blood stops and all the flesh goes away; then put in the nostril after cutting, only salt and water or a drink; because opening the nostril and leading the moisture to the throat.
So know that he has been cured; and if the moisture does not penetrate as it should, know that there is a piece of flesh remaining in the uppermost part of the bone, which the instrument did not reach with the cutting, so then you should take a thread of cotton with some roughness.
And there are many knots in it, and he leaves a space of a finger or less between each knot. The patient draws the end of the thread into his nose with tweezers or whatever is possible for him to make like a skewer, and he attracts its odor until it reaches the pharynx.
And it comes out on his cheek, and often children do this action as described in the books, which is easy for those who wish to do it. Then he gathers both ends of the thread: the one that came out of the mouth and the other that remained in the nose.
Then he uses the flesh to pull on the knot in the thread, doing this until he knows that the flesh has been cut by the knot of the thread. Then he removes the thread and leaves it in the nose after wiping off the blood with a cloth that he soaks in vinegar. He does this for three days or more.
Until the vinegar eats up all that remains of the flesh, then he leaves something else in the nose, a lead pipe for as many days as needed until he recovers. If treatment is required again, he uses the same thing dried.
And this is the picture of the mustard which they use to drop the medicines and ointments into the nose:
He should place a candle-like silver or copper object, open on one side and coated with wax.
And if you wish, the tube can be made closed like a stalk, and the surface of the mustard coated.
It has a handle at the end, as you see, to hold it when the oil or any of the juices or hot substances are inside.
Chapter Twenty-Five.
In the frontal sinus, which is located at the tip of the nose.
Often, a swelling occurs in the tip of the nose, and it grows and increases with time until it disfigures the appearance.
Therefore, it should be cut as soon as it appears and all of it removed. Then place on the spot either a cautery or a burnt medicine that replaces the cautery. If cutting is delayed until it grows, look at it; if it is hardened like bone with dark color and little feeling,
Then do not cauterize it with iron, for it is a cancerous growth. Often I have seen that if this growth is cut off, a great ulcer returns to its owner. If the growth is soft and not dark in color, I have observed that cutting is possible completely. The patient should be emptied and cut without fear or hesitation, and the site should be treated with what dries and tightens until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Six.
On Suturing the Nose, Lip, and Ear. If its connection is torn by a wound or something similar, know that when the connection in one of these organs is severed, the treatment does not help much except in some people.
If one of them is subjected to such a condition, it should be observed whether the wound is profusely bleeding with blood. If so, the lips of the wound should be sutured together and treated until healing occurs. If the separation of connection has split the lips into two, each lip being healthy, it is necessary to cauterize each lip with its external skin until it closes.
Then suture the two lips together and press them firmly, leaving on them powdered lime and milk. Place a piece of dried date stone or another type of dried stone over the sutures, and leave it pressed for one to three days before unbandaging.
The medicine should be changed and left until the sutures dissolve on their own, then treat it with lime until it heals. The method of suturing is to join the severed connection either with needle thread as we described in suturing the abdomen or with thread as you were informed there.
Chapter Twenty-seven
On removing the tonsils that protrude in the throat.
There are many people who have small, hard growths in their mouths, some of which resemble the seed of a carnation and others smaller or larger. It is necessary to turn back the cheek and cut into each tonsil, then ligate it with silk thread.
Then cut it from every side, and after cutting fill the place with powdered alum until the bleeding stops; then rinse with vinegar, saltwater, and treat the places with what is contained in this chapter until the wounds heal.
Chapter Twenty-eight
On cutting away excess gum tissue
Often there is excess tissue on the gums which the ancients called Apolysus. It is necessary to ligature it with silk thread or grasp it with forceps and cut it at its base, leaving the wound to drain pus or blood; then place powdered alum on the site.
Or one of the dry, astringent powders; for if that tissue returns after treatment, it usually recurs, so cut it again and cauterize it, for it does not return afterwards.
Chapter Twenty-Nine
On extracting teeth with iron.
There may be rough, ugly scales forming on the surfaces of the teeth, both inside and outside, between the gums. They can become black, yellow, or green to the point that this rotting reaches the gums and causes the teeth to look bad because of it.
The patient should sit before you with his head on your stone, and scrape the tooth and the gum where the scales and the sand-like substance appear until nothing remains. Do this also for the black, green, and yellow areas, and whatever else there is, until it is clean.
If what was in it from the first scraping has gone, and if not, repeat the scraping on another day, secondly and thirdly, until you achieve your goal. Know that the tooth needs different kinds of scrapers, varied in shape, according to what prepares for your work.
Because the scraper that scrapes the tooth from the inside is different from the one that scrapes it from the outside, and the one that scrapes between the teeth is of another shape; these are various shapes of scrapers, all of which you should have ready.
Chapter Thirty
On the Extraction of Teeth
It is advisable to treat the tooth from its pain with all means and avoid extracting it, because if it is extracted, there will be a trace left behind, as it is a noble organ. If extraction becomes necessary, then do so.
It is necessary that if the patient is determined to have it extracted, you should wait until the tooth stops hurting. Often, the patient is deceived by the pain and thinks it is in the healthy tooth, so he extracts it, but the pain does not go away until the diseased tooth is extracted. We have seen this happen many times with barbers.
If the pain subsides in the tooth itself, then it is necessary to wrap a thread around the tooth with some force until the gum separates from all sides, then move it with your fingers or with soft pincers, little by little, until it shakes.
Then, using the two large tweezers, you can easily extract it. Place the patient's head between your knees, ensuring he does not move. Pull the tooth straight up so as not to break it. If it does not come out, take one of those instruments and insert it underneath from all sides with care, moving it as you did before.
If the tooth is perforated or eaten away, it should be filled with lead and sealed well with a thin membrane so that it does not leak when squeezed with the forceps, and it should be tied around the gum with silk from every side.
And be careful not to break it, lest some of it remain and cause the patient more pain than the first time. Beware of doing what foolish barbers do in their bridges and front teeth by removing them without using what we have described.
Often, they cause people great pain that is more severe than if the tooth had broken and all or part of its root remained. Or, he may remove part of the jawbone, as we have seen many times, then rinse with water or salt and honey after removal. If bleeding occurs from that place, this often happens; so crush some glass and apply it to the site at that time.
Otherwise, use the forceps with long tips and a short handle, which are thick to prevent slipping when you squeeze the tooth. This is the shape of the large forceps:
It should be as you see, with the handles thick so that when they are clamped they do not yield to themselves or become short in the edges, and it should be of Indian iron or firm steel, sharpened at the edges, and at its edge there are teeth which penetrate into each other, thus making a tight and secure clamp.
The edges should be made like a sword to make them also strong in holding.
Chapter Thirty-One.
In the extraction of tooth roots and removal of fractured jawbones.
If a tooth root breaks during extraction, it is necessary to place cotton soaked in oil on the site for one or two days until it heals, then insert gauze or pledgets. Those which resemble the edges of the beak of a bird called "al-bulriga", and this is the image of pledgets:
They should be made like a sword from the inside or a scalpel, for if it is not possible to extract with these pledgets, then you must make an incision on the root and expose all the flesh with a probe, then insert the instrument that resembles a small hook, which looks like this:
A short pointed instrument, slightly thick and not smooth so that it does not break; if the point comes out like this, otherwise use these other instruments whose picture is here, the first is triangular at the tip with part of it thick.
A finer triangular shape:
And we can also use this bifid instrument, whose image is also shown here:
And with the other instruments and scissors that are mentioned in the extraction of teeth, we can also use this instrument which resembles a large saw, whose image is shown here:
A triangular tip with slight thickness so that it does not break, and it should not be smooth. Know that the instruments for teeth are numerous, as well as all other instruments; their number is incalculable, and the skilled craftsman who is proficient in his work can invent for himself instruments according to what the work and the diseases themselves indicate.
Because among the diseases, there are some for which the early people did not mention instruments due to their varied types; if a bone from the jaw or one of the teeth bones is broken or eroded, then he should examine it in its place with what suits it from these instruments and calipers that were mentioned in the removal of roots.
"And we use this instrument in the following manner.
"It should have some slight stickiness to hold the bone in place so it does not slip until the bone comes out. We then treat the site with appropriate medications. If the bone has a swelling, we remove its swelling and blackness until it is clean, then we heal it until it is cured.
"Chapter Two and Thirty-Three.
"In the case of dislocated teeth on other teeth.
"Teeth, if they have grown into a place other than their natural path, are disfigured in this way, especially when this happens to women and the delicate; therefore, one should look to see if the tooth has grown from behind another tooth.
"If it cannot be dislocated or turned back, then extract it; and if it is attached to another tooth, cut it with this instrument, the form of which is as follows.
"It resembles a small file and should be made of Indian steel, with a very sharp edge. Its cut will take many days due to the hardness of the tooth, so that it does not affect other teeth. As for if it is natal, we can make use of its mobility to turn it back.
"All of it will be from India, and its carving will be very thin, like the ice used to make needles. It will freeze the tooth a little at a time over many days, until it is weakened and falls out. Then you will soften it and grind it with some grinding tools.
"If the tooth has broken and is causing pain to the tongue while speaking, it should also be frozen until that fracture disappears and the surface becomes even and smooth, so as not to cause pain to the tongue or spoil the speech.
"The Thirty-third Chapter
"In resembling the moving teeth with silver threads or gold threads.
"If the front teeth become shaky and move due to a blow or fall, and the patient cannot chew on anything for fear they will fall out, and if treatment with astringent drugs does not help, then it is necessary to extract them.
"The method for this is to bind it with a gold or silver thread, and gold is better because silver will tarnish and decay after some days, while gold remains stable forever without any such effect. The thread should be of medium thickness and as thick as needed between the teeth.
The image shows tying a thread and inserting it between the correct teeth, then sewing with both ends of the thread between the moving teeth, one or more, until the sewing reaches the correct tooth from the other side.
Then, continue the sewing back to where you started and tighten with care and wisdom so that the knot does not move, making sure your thread is secure at the root of the teeth so it doesn't come undone. After that, cut the excess thread with scissors, gather both ends together, melt them with heat, and hide them between the correct tooth and the moving tooth.
So that the tongue is not obstructed, then leave it like this for a while. If it loosens or breaks, tighten it again with another thread and enjoy it thus for all time. Here is an image of the teeth and the manner of sewing in two correct teeth and two moving teeth as you see:
The single tooth or two may return to their place after falling and be sewn as we described, and they remain. This is done by a skilled craftsman. Bone from the bones of a cow can also be carved into the shape of a tooth and placed in the space where the tooth has gone. He will recover as we have said, and he will enjoy that.
Chapter Forty-Three.
On cutting the ligament that protrudes under the tongue to prevent speech.
This ligament that protrudes under the tongue may be either naturally present from birth or it may be a result of an old wound that has healed.
The procedure is as follows: open the mouth of the patient and place his head in your lap; raise his tongue, then cut the protruding nerve until the tongue is released from its constriction. If it has some rigidity or tension due to an old healed wound, split a catgut thread into two strands and divide the constriction with them transversely until the ligature slackens and the knot dissolves.
Be careful not to cut too deeply into the flesh, lest you sever a vein and cause bleeding. After cutting, rinse with rose water or vinegar and cold water, then place a piece of cotton cloth under the tongue for the patient to bite on each night.
Otherwise, if there is bleeding, apply powdered alum to the site. If blood dominates, wash the area with a solution of coriander seeds. Then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-Three.
In the extraction of a toad born under the tongue.
It may happen under the tongue, a worm resembling a small toad that prevents the tongue from functioning naturally, and sometimes it grows until it fills the mouth. The treatment is to open the patient's mouth in the sun and examine the worm.
If you see it black, or very dark and hard, the patient does not feel any pain; do not touch it, for it is a cancer. But if it is inclined towards whiteness and has moisture in it, cut into it with a fine lancet, split it open gently, and remove it from all directions.
If the bleeding overwhelms you while operating, place powdered alum on it to stop the bleeding. Then resume your operation until you completely remove it. After that, have him rinse with vinegar and salt.
Then treat it with the rest of the suitable treatment until he is healed.
Chapter Sixty-Three.
On the treatment of worms in the almond tree.
And what grows in the throat from other worms may appear inside the throat as glands resembling those that appear externally, called almond tree (lwztyn). If treated with what was mentioned in the division, it does not heal.
Look, if the worm is hard like black in color and has little feeling, do not expose it to iron, and even if its color is red and its origin is thick, do not expose it to iron for fear of bleeding. Rather, leave it until it ripens, either to burst or to dissolve on its own.
If it is white in color and round, and its origin is thin, this one should be cut out. The work involved is to look before working if the worm's heat has settled completely or only partially.
At that time, the patient sits in the sunlight with his head on your knee and you open his mouth and take a servant between your hands. With this instrument, you press his tongue downwards as depicted in the image.
It is made of silver or copper and should be thin like a razor blade. When you press with it on the tongue and the worm becomes visible to your eyes, take a thread and insert it into an almond, and pull it out as much as possible without pulling any of the gums with it.
Then you cut it with this instrument, as shown in the image. It resembles a scissor, but each of its two ends has a sharp tip. One of them is blunt and the other very sharp. It is made from Indian iron or Damascus steel.
If this instrument is not available, cut it with a sharp object like this image.
It is sharp on one side and not sharp on the other, so after it cuts one almond, it will cut the others in this manner of cutting automatically. Then, after cutting, the patient should gargle with cold water or salt water.
If he coughs up blood, gargle with water in which pomegranate rind or oak leaves have been boiled until the bleeding stops, then treat it until he is cured. There may also be wounds other than those of the almonds that grow in the throat; cut them as you did with the almonds.
A woman was treated for a worm that had grown inside her throat, reaching to the larynx, causing little sensation but almost completely blocking the throat. The woman could only breathe with difficulty and could not eat or drink water.
She was close to death if she remained for another day or two, and a branch from the worm had emerged reaching her nostrils. So I hurried and inserted a hook into one of them, then pulled it out, and a piece came out with it.
Then I cut it where it reached me from the nostril, and did the same with what appeared from the other nostril. Then I opened her mouth and pressed her tongue, then I introduced the probe into the same ulcer, then I cut some of it off, and nothing but blood flowed from it.
The woman's ring fell off and she quickly removed her watch to drink water, then ate some food. From that ulcer, nothing was cut for a long time, and the ulcer persisted instead of being cut until it lasted with us for a long time.
The ulcer became internal and the ring-shaped ulcer healed, so it stopped growing. Then she moved away, and I do not know what God did with her after that.
Chapter Seven and Thirty.
On Cutting the Ulcer of the Tonsil.
If a tonsillar ulcer extends to the tonsil and becomes inflamed, it is called a column if it is white and elongated; if its lower part is thick and circular, it is called an uvula. If treated with what we mentioned in division, the treatment will not be effective.
I saw the hot ulcer had disappeared from her, and she was thin. It is necessary to cut it if it is circular with no length and bloody or dark in color; otherwise, it should be avoided.
The patient should be made to sit in the sun and press their tongue with the instrument described, then stitch the wound in the ear.
And pull it down and cut it with one of the two instruments mentioned for cutting polyps, making sure not to cut more than necessary, as excessive cutting will harm the voice and speech.
Then, after cutting, the method described for cutting polyps should be used to treat it until it heals. If the patient is unable to cut it themselves, the drill can be used without fear or concern, as its edge is sharp and it will act as a medicine. The patient's head should be placed on a stone.
Then, press the tongue with the instrument mentioned, then take the strong water mentioned in the drill section and form a tight, neither thick nor thin, thread from it, filling this instrument's container with it. And here is its shape.
Its end, where the medicine is placed, should have a container like that of a teaspoon. The instrument with the medicine should be placed on the lesion itself, and the patient should lie on their side so that any leakage from inside the cheek flows out rather than down into the throat, causing harm.
Then hold the medicine in your hand and squeeze it onto the wound for half an hour until you see it has darkened and the bite of the medicine has calmed down. If you wish, you can take a cotton ball, place it on the tip of a reed, and dip the cotton ball into the medicine.
And insert the reed with the cotton into a tube from above until the cotton adheres to the wound. Do this repeatedly until you reach the desired amount of swelling in the grape. Then leave it, for it will soften and fall off after three or four days. If you need to repeat the medicine, do so.
After the swelling, wipe around the grape with a cotton ball soaked in oil and clean off the medicine surrounding it. Then rinse with cold water and treat externally with lotions and internally with syrups until cured. This method of treatment is more merciful than cutting and further from causing fear.
The wound can also be treated with something more gentle than swelling and cutting, by treating it with incense in this manner: take cloves, cinnamon, nutmeg, cardamom, ginger, galangal, and similar spices, gather all or some of them in a measure, and soak them in vinegar.
وتغلى والقدر مطيّنة بطين الحكمة وتكون فى وسط الغطاء ثقبة تركّب عليها الآلة المجوّفة على هذه الصفة تصنع من فضّة أو نحاس.
And the tip with the pomegranate enters into the patient's mouth until the vapor rises to the swelling along the tube until the swelling becomes soft, then repeat on it several times until it subsides. Be careful not to perform this treatment in the first stage of inflammation.
For it often increases inflammation, and it should only be done when the heat of the inflammation has subsided. If you do not have this device, take a reed and place an eggshell on its tip so that the patient's mouth does not burn.
Because the eggshell prevents the heat of the vapor from burning the mouth, and this is a good treatment in addition to its safety.
Chapter Eighty-Three.
Concerning the extraction of thorns and other objects that grow in the fingernail.
Often, bones or fish thorns and the like get stuck in the fingernail. It is necessary to remove what is visible after pressing the tongue with the instrument under the sun.
It should be clear to you what is in the throat, and what has not appeared and hides in the throat. Before the patient eats his food, it is necessary to make him vomit so that the thing may come out by vomiting, or the patient may swallow a piece of cloth or the root of a herb.
Or he may swallow a morsel of dry bread or take a piece of soft sea sponge, tie it to a string, and swallow it. Then, when it reaches the place of obstruction, quickly pull the string, repeating this several times.
Often, the obstruction or bone in it comes out with what was mentioned. If it does not come out as described, then use an instrument made of lead in this form:
It will be slightly harder than the iron and at its end, there will be a ring that the patient inserts into his throat while lying on his back with his head raised up. He must avoid touching his teeth to prevent injury, and he pushes out the bone or obstruction with it, or the physician inserts it by hand.
It is better for the patient to insert it himself because he knows the location of the obstruction and pushes it down or pulls his hand with the instrument up, all according to what prepares him until it comes out.
Chapter Nine and Thirty
Regarding the extraction of a protruding hemorrhoid in the anus.
If the hemorrhoid was treated with the drugs we mentioned in the division of treatment and did not heal, then look at that time at the anus of the patient after the sun has set, after his tongue has been compressed with the instrument I described to you.
Then, if your sight falls upon the hemorrhoid, draw it out with a small hook or a thin, fine probe. If you cannot do so, take a hollow pipe and insert it into the patient's anus close to the hemorrhoid, then insert iron heated in fire into the pipe.
Repeat this several times, and the patient must abstain from water for the whole day. Then, he should take a mouthful of cold water and keep it in his mouth without swallowing any of it, moving the water with his hand sometimes, then other times.
If you feel the water, then the hemorrhoid will fall on its own. But if it doesn't come out as we described, heat the anus with urine and litharge using the instrument I mentioned in the section on cauterization, and repeat this several times, for it will fall.
The method of using inhalation is to take a vessel and place it on fire with a lid covering it, leaving a hole in the middle. Then, insert the tube into this hole, and receive the smoke. Place the patient's mouth on the end of the tube and close their mouth so that the smoke does not escape until it reaches their throat.
If the polyp does not fall off, repeat the smoking several times and make the patient endure thirst while eating salt and garlic, but do not let him drink water. This is necessary for its removal by this method. And here is an image of the device used to draw the polyp from the throat if it falls within sight.
It resembles a syringe, as you see, except that it has this attachment that enters the throat, and its tip resembles the beak of a bird; in it is a cold metal piece that, if it touches something, does not leave it.
Another device is used to compress the tongue; it is a wide iron ring that fits over the tongue and enters the mouth, standing on its side. This keeps the mouth open against the patient's will, and he cannot remove it until it is removed by someone else.
The shape of the instrument used to open the mouth according to this measurement with the eye.
Chapter Forty.
In it, he spoke about the cauterization of wounds and their tearing.
Wounds have many varieties, each of which will be discussed individually in this book. They differ in their cauterization and tearing in two ways: one is the type of wound itself and what it contains of moistures.
The second type is from the locations in which they occur in the body, for the wound occurring in the head differs from that occurring in the buttocks, and the wound occurring in a fleshy place differs from that occurring in a joint. Each of these has its own rule of treatment.
Among the wounds are those which should not be cauterized except after the pus in them has matured and been completed, and among them are those which should be cauterized while they are new and have not fully matured, such as the wounds that are near the joints.
Because if the wound occurs near a joint and its duration is prolonged until it becomes gangrenous, the surrounding tissue may corrupt the ligaments or nerves of that joint, causing paralysis of that limb, or the wound may be near the main limb.
"If you delay treating the wound until it heals, you will harm the main organ or it will be near the bone and you should cover it with a soft bandage. The worm that is not fully developed near the bone should also be covered with a soft bandage to prevent the ulcer from penetrating into the bone and becoming gangrenous.
"It will become incurable and it is necessary to know the time for bandaging wounds that have completely healed, which is when pain from the wound subsides, redness disappears, swelling decreases, the head of the wound hardens, and other signs appear.
"It is necessary to place the bandage lower than the wound, if possible, so that it is easier for the pus to drain downwards, or in a higher place on the wound and tighter, and let the bandage be tapered along the body if the wounds are near the hands and feet.
"As for the locations of muscles, tendons, nerves, and blood vessels, and in general all flat areas without any swelling: in those that do swell, let the bandage follow accordingly. As for if the wound is in fleshy parts, it is best to leave its bandage loose.
Until it is fully set, as we have said, because if you remove it before that, the suture will be delayed and there will be much pus and inflammation, and perhaps the cheekbones and jaw may ossify, and some of the wounds may protrude on the body surface according to necessity or according to what the member requires.
It is necessary to use a single suture for small wounds, and for large wounds, a wide suture or many stitches according to the size of the wound. There are some wounds that should be covered with skin and cut if it becomes like a scar.
It has become like a scar as seen in many leprosy and other diseases, and among them are those that split into three branches, and there are some that look like the leaves of the Arabic oleander.
And among them are those that use the circular suture, the crescent-shaped suture, and similar stitches; if it does not have a head like flat, soft wounds, then only a simple suture should be used. If the wound is large and has accumulated much pus and you remove it, do not hurry so that all the pus comes out at once in this time.
I removed part of it, then constricted the worm until another day, and then removed more of its length as well. Repeat this gradually until all of it is expelled.
Especially if the patient is weak, or a pregnant woman, or a small child, or an old man with a thin body, for often the animal spirit leaves with the expulsion of the worm, so sometimes the patient dies and you don't feel it. Beware of this danger greatly.
After extracting these worms, it is necessary to wash the wound and examine it. If the wound of the worm is small or its tunnel is a single shallow one, use cotton or wool for treatment. But if the worm is large and its tunnels are numerous,
Then, insert a cotton swab into each tunnel until they meet together. If the worm has been cut from the skin or is in pieces, it should be packed with dry wool or lint and tied tightly for three days.
Then, remove it and treat the wound with appropriate bandages until it heals. If blood appears during your procedure, use cold water and vinegar, after soaking a piece of cotton in them, and place it on the bleeding area several times.
If the abscess persists, it is necessary to use cautery, treatment, and the necessities that we have described in many places in this book. From the division, if you are in winter and the place of the boil is very nerve-rich, it is necessary to boil the roots with hot drink and oil.
And place them on the spot, and if you are in summer and the places are fleshy, it is necessary to carry the roots soaked in water and oil or in drink and oil, all of this cold, until on the third day as we said, it is necessary that the boil bursts and is washed.
And use in his treatment whatever suits him until he is cured, and this is what you need to know about the treatment of boils in general. As for the method of detailing, it has been mentioned how each boil is treated, summarized briefly.
Chapter Forty-One
On the incision of boils that appear on the skin of the head.
On the skin of the head appear small boils, which are among the types of abscesses that contain pustules resembling chicken pox, and their kinds are many. Among them are some that are oily, while others contain moisture similar to humidity.
And from it, there is what contains moisture similar to dew and mucus and the like, and from it, there is what is hardened and solidified, and all of them have no danger in opening or expelling them, as long as they do not obstruct you when opening them.
The work in it is to cauterize it first with the instrument that follows this, which is called a probe, until you know what it contains. If what it contains is moisture, then open it with a long, simple incision like this:
Begin the incision from line ~b~ to line ~j~. If the moisture drains, then cauterize the bladder that contained that moisture and cut it completely, leaving nothing of it behind; for often it returns if anything remains.
Then soak a cotton swab in vinegar if available, or in salt water, and fill the wound with it, leaving it until the next day, for it eats away at any remaining bladder. After that, prepare another cotton swab with vinegar, and a third if needed.
Until you are certain that nothing remains of the bladder, then treat the wound with vinegar until it heals. If the inflammation contains a fatty substance, then open it in this manner:
Cut with a cautery and apply the styptic to the edges of the wound, and wash it from all sides, and strain your effort in removing the foreskin that contains it, for if you are obstructed by a narrow passage, do what I have described for you afterwards, and similarly do this with the worm if it is separated from the foreskin.
Treat it according to what I mentioned, and cauterizing the separated worm is easier because it has little blood and moisture. Some of these worms in the head of certain people have no moisture with them, which is why I cauterized a worm in them.
The head of an old woman, the worm was like a hard, coarse white stone, which could not be broken even if someone threw it, and it would bounce back. And there was nothing else remarkable about this type of worm in the head except for this, similar to the worms that appear on children's heads.
And in the roots of the ears, cauterize them all with a simple cautery and make the base from their lower part to facilitate the flow of pus downwards, then treat it with the appropriate treatment.
Chapter Twenty-Four.
In the case of cauterizing pigs that appear in the neck, this type of worm often appears in the neck, under the armpits, and in the groin area; it can also appear elsewhere in the body. The one appearing in the neck is usually solitary and numerous, and some of them give birth to others.
Every pig is contained within a specific sack, just like in the testicles and membranes of the head as we have described, and there are many types of these pigs: some are dry, others contain moisture, and others are putrid and do not respond to treatment.
What I saw of it in a good condition was soft to the touch and its appearance was close to the color of the skin, moving in all directions and not adhering to the nerves of the neck or the tendons or blood vessels, nor was it hard. It should be cut with a simple incision from above to below the body in this way, from line ~j~ to line ~b~.
It should be skinned from all sides, and the edges of the skin should be stretched with threads or two threads or many stitches if needed, as we mentioned for the membranes of the head. Remove it little by little, and place it on a hook so that no nerve or tendon is cut, and make sure what you are pulling is not very hard.
So that your hand does not increase in cutting or frighten the patient, causing you to cut what you do not need to cut, if you cut a nerve or blood vessel and it prevents you from working, place some powdered alum or some of the styptic herbs that stop bleeding into the wound.
The wound has closed and been left until the worm's head settles, and the wound becomes inflamed and begins to suppurate, for at that time the blood will stop. So return to your work until you finish, then examine with your probing finger if there is anything remaining; then cut small pieces of pork and clean them.
If there is a large vein in the pork, do not cut it from its root; rather, tie it with a strong double thread and leave it until it falls off on its own without harm. Then fill the wound with cotton that has been soaked in Egyptian wine and treat it.
And if the entire pork is cut, it is necessary to bring together the edges of the wound and suture it with thread from its own skin after ensuring that there is no remaining bone fragment, because if you see that there is a remaining piece of the pork bone.
Then it is necessary to aim for the root and base of that piece with the cut, and use suturing and what we have mentioned. And whatever was left of the pork pieces, cover them with a simple bandage where it shows you its place of placement, and make the bandage from below upwards as we said.
Then use the Egyptian vinegar and similar to it so that he eats what remains of the corruption, until when you see the wound has become clean, treat it with pickled vinegar until it heals.
Chapter Thirty-Four
When pus forms inside the ring finger.
The first time this incision was mentioned in the ring finger, I have not seen anyone in our country do it, and this is their saying. However, those who slaughter animals should avoid making an incision in the ring finger as they will not benefit from it.
Because all the members and limbs will be weak, but those with hot pus in the mouth, fingers or toes, if there is no swelling in the joint, it is necessary to use the incision of the ring finger to avoid gangrene from constriction.
It is necessary, if we wish to do so, to incise the ring finger under three circles from the joints or four small incisions in width between two circles, as much as the incision is in the palm, not in the fingers, and this place is suitable for the incision.
Because it is thin in flesh and the veins are far from it, if the treated person is fat, it is necessary to stretch the skin of the finger with a needle, then incise the skin until reaching the joints, avoiding the veins if any are seen.
Then the anus that we described is torn, and it indicates the tearing of the spinal cord from the marrow that exits from it with what is broken, and from the interruption of sound, leaving the wound open for a time. So when the time that was feared for strangulation has passed, the edges of the wound are brought together from the skin.
And it is treated alone without bandages, then the medicines that promote flesh growth are used until he heals. The author of this book explains this phrase we mentioned: It means if they see the patient has clogged one of these veins that were mentioned.
The patient was in danger of death and wanted to commit suicide, so they went to tear the trachea to allow the patient to breathe on the wound a bit, thus saving him from death. They were commanded to leave the wound open until the illness subsided, and its duration was three days or thereabouts.
At that time, they were commanded to suture the wound and treat it until he heals. I myself witnessed a servant who took a knife and sent it into his jugular vein, cutting part of the spinal cord. He was then treated for it and found it rotting like slaughtered meat, so the wound was exposed.
The blood that came out of the wound was flowing, so I concluded that no nerve or vessel was cut. Air was coming out of the wound, so I cleaned it and treated it until it healed, and nothing appeared to the servant except a slight change in his voice, no more.
After a few days, she returned to her previous state, so from here we say that the fracture of the jaw has no danger.
Chapter Forty-Four
On the fracture of the ulcer that appears externally in the throat and is called the tonsil of the throat.
This ulcer, which is called the tonsil of the throat, is a very large ulcer in color and is common in women, and it has two types.
It may be natural or it may be caused by a disease. As for the natural one, there is nothing wrong with it, but as for the diseased one, it occurs in two types: one resembles fatty tumors and the other resembles the ulcer that results from the constriction of veins, and its fracture is dangerous. It is not advisable to treat it with hot iron, except for a small part of it if it is tolerated and explored with a probe, if it resembles a fatty tumor and is not attached to any veins, then fracture it as you would on a tumor. And remove them with what they contain in the bag, if they are in a bag; otherwise, gather all of them and then treat the place as needed.
Chapter Forty-Five.
On the cut for different types of goods.
The goods are numerous, and all their types have been mentioned in the division. It is necessary to inform here of the difference between the merchandise and the tax, as it is problematic. I say that the tax comes with heat, inflammation, and feared pains until the swelling of the groin calms down. The abscess is completed at that point, so the inflammation and hardness subside. The merchandise does not come with heat, inflammation, or pain; it is contained in a sac-like cyst, which has its own special container and appears in the color of the body. Its beginning is like an abscess, but it becomes like a bladder, larger and smaller.
And it is of two types: either fatty or containing moisture, and the colors of the moisture are many as mentioned in the division. Therefore, if one reaches the treatment of the merchandise, one should delay it and examine it first with the instrument called the meds on its appearance, as shown in the following chapter.
Measure the size of the tumor, then extract it and observe what comes out with it. If a watery fluid comes out, regardless of its color, cut it simply as mentioned for other tumors. But if no fluid comes out with the tumor, know that it is fatty.
Cut it with a sharp incision, and suture it as I have shown you. Remove the skin from all sides with scissors, and preserve it in a bag if you can remove it intact with the lesion.
If the bag bursts during surgery and you cannot remove it intact, it often recurs. So, remove it piece by piece until nothing remains, for if anything remains, small or large, the lesion tends to recur more frequently.
If you are unable to remove all of it, cauterize the wound with some of the sharp needles and close the wound, placing on top of it something that generates heat, and treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals. If the lesion is large, cut its edges and treat them with what adheres.
If a pulsating or non-pulsating artery appears and bleeding occurs, quickly cauterize the area with powdered zinc oxide and leave it pressed for one to three days until the wound heals and stops bleeding. Then return to removing whatever remains of the lesion.
Chapter Sixty-Four
On the instruments.
Those used in cauterization and scarification, among them are the images of the cautery, which is of three types: large, medium, and small.

Image of a small probe:
They are suitable for examining wounds, injuries, ulcers, and abscesses to see what is inside them, such as bones or other things. They are made rounded, polished, and smooth like a spatula from tin, brass, copper, iron, or silver; the best of these are those made from brass. ‌
Probes can also be made from black lead, which is suitable for probing ulcers that have a narrow opening to widen them and peel off their lining with it. They are also of three types: long, medium, and short.

Its tips, which are used for cutting, will be limited, while the other ends will not be limited; this is done so that he can use it to remove the stitch when there is a fear of cutting a nerve or tendon, and thus the patient will experience some relief from the burning sensation he experiences during the removal of the wound.
And these are the images of the hooks, and they are three types: large, medium, and small; image of a large hook:
It is made of copper, resembling the marrow that is filled with it. At one end is a spatula-like shape consisting of two layers, at its tip is a hidden blade resembling the tongue of a bird that goes inside and outside as you wish, as shown in the image.
Images of the instruments hidden between the fingers during bandaging, which the patient does not feel, and there are three types of them because some are large, others medium, and still others small. Image of a large instrument:
Images of the scissors used to cut the clots of blood, which are three types because some are large, others medium, and still others small. Image of the large scissors:
It is made of copper or of turned iron a little to the length, as you see, and it will be thin. It is fitting that these types of scissors should be with you, large and small, so that you may cut blood quickly in emergencies and when medicines are not available.
In cutting blood vessels in any part of the body, do not use [the instrument] except in fleshy places such as the calf muscle, thigh, arm muscles, shoulder, abdomen, armpit, and similar fleshy parts.
It can be made into smaller tools resembling pistachio shells in this manner:.
It cuts blood if it is torn from its root or when cutting a nerve or vein, and it can be made into a spiral in this manner:.
Chapter Seventy-Four.
In the treatment of male shoulders.
If a person's shoulder swells like a woman's breast at the time of puberty, it remains warm and ugly. Therefore, those who dislike this should scrape the shoulder with a lunar scraper in this manner.
From line ~B~ to line ~J~: Then scrape all the fat, then fill the wound with ointment, then close the edges of the wound with stitches and treat it until it heals. If the shoulder falls to the lower part and becomes attached to its bone as it does for women.
In the upper sides, two incisions are necessary, resembling in shape a crescent moon. Each of them is connected to the other at its ends until the larger line becomes encompassing the smaller one as shown in this image: From line ~B~ to line ~J~, then you should scrape the skin between the two incisions and remove the fat. Use the stitches and ligatures that we have mentioned, and provide whatever treatment is needed until it heals.
If the wound has not absorbed what it should, because of the patient's anxiety or due to blood flowing back, then it is necessary to pack the wound with cotton soaked in vinegar and leave it until the fat is consumed. Then treat it until it heals.
Chapter Forty-Eight.
In the treatment of wounds that occur under the navel.
These wounds that occur under the navel are of the type called "pigskin," which is enclosed in a sac. Some contain fluids. If it contains fluid, then you should make a crescent-shaped incision like this:
From line ~B~ to line ~J~. Once all the pus in the wound has been drained, pack it with clean cotton and leave it until the next day, then remove the cotton.
And treat with the suitable cautery until it heals, for if the ulcer is of the kind of swine hernia, break it open as we mentioned in breaking open swine hernias, whether or not the wound extends to the point where the skin can be stretched, then use the lancet as we mentioned before.
Chapter Forty-Nine.
In the incision of the ulcer that appears from before the intestines or the liver, which is called aneurysm.
If the intestines are injured and the skin above it is stitched, often an ulcer appears from that, and similarly, it may happen to the liver that a swelling or ulcer appears in it.
And the signs by which it is recognized if the ulcer and swelling are from the intestines or the liver, then the ulcer, if it is from the intestines, will be rectangular and deep in the body, and if you press the ulcer with your finger, you will feel as if it has a pit.
And that which is from the liver will be circular on the surface of the body, and incising these ulcers is dangerous, especially if they are in the abdomen, thighs, or neck, and in many parts of the body; they were very great, so it is necessary to avoid treating them with iron.
And what is also in the edges or in the head should be avoided, so whatever swelling of the veins occurred, cut it on the skin a long incision, then open the incision with probes, then cauterize the vein and cleanse it from clots.
So that it is exposed, then insert a needle under it and push it to the other side, and tie the vein with a double thread in two places as you were taught for tying the veins in the temples, then cut at the place between the ligatures until all the blood comes out.
The worm will dissolve, and then the treatment that produces pus should be used until the ligatures fall off, then it should be treated with appropriate poultices until healed.
If the worm is before the incision of the vein, it is necessary to grab as much of the worm with the skin as you can, then insert a needle below the place where you grabbed and push it until it exits on the other side, with the needle having a double thread in it. Then tie it with a good knot from both sides at the ends of the thread, as you were told for tying the grape from both sides at the ends of the thread; if you fear that the threads may slip, insert another needle with another thread under all the worm where the first needle crosses.
Your threads are placed in four locations, then the worm is cut in the middle until it comes out. After removing what was in it, a piece of skin is cut and left attached to it. Then, place a cloth soaked in oil and vinegar mixture on it. Then use the treatment of lint and marshmallow until it heals.
Chapter Fifty.
The worm that appears from the nerve.
Just as the worm appears in the veins and arteries, so too it appears in the nerves if there is a blow or excessive fatigue or something similar. And this happens more frequently in the extremities and the back.
In every place where the joints move, there is a soft worm resembling the color of the rest of the body, and it is usually painless. If pressed firmly, the patient feels something like a knot, and the worm is not clustered in the depth of the body.
Rather, it is under the skin and moves in all directions except forward or backward. Therefore, what is in the joints should not be exposed with iron, as this may cause inflammation. And what is in the head or forehead.
Cut the skin with a scalpel; if the worm is small, grasp it with forceps and cut it from its root. If it is large, tie a thread around it, draw it out, then close the wound with stitches and treat it until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-One.
On cutting the intestines that are exposed in the abdomen.
Many people have in their abdomens and other parts of their bodies intestines called the natives because they resemble the navel, having a thin base and a thick end. Their openings may become narrowed, some being small while others are greatly enlarged.
I have seen a man with two intestines in his abdomen that were like the navel, white and thin at their base, having narrowed openings which had become fissured, from which moisture constantly flowed. I cut them out; one weighed about eighteen ounces, the other about six ounces.
The procedure for cutting it is as follows: if the patient is moist and the intestine is white, soft, and thin at its base, cut it with a broad scalpel; have the cautery ready in the fire, for often there is much bleeding when it is cut.
In case blood dominates, tie it down. If you see the patient with anxiety and fear from cutting with iron, take a thread of tight lead and tie it tightly around the testicles, which have this description, and leave it for two days. Then increase the tightness of the lead, and continue to tighten the lead.
Whenever you affect the testicles until they rupture and fall out on their own without a thread, if the testicles are thick at the base, there is some fear and concern in cutting them, especially when they are inside the abdomen. However, it may be possible to cut half or part of them.
Then tie it down to prevent recurrence, then treat it until the wound heals, and be careful not to cut testicles that are slightly blue, numb, dull in appearance, for they are cancerous. We will discuss male genital cancers later.
Chapter Two Fifty-Two.
In the treatment of scrotal hernia.
Scrotal hernia may have many causes, either from a tear in the peritoneum that covers the abdomen, causing intestines or fluid to protrude into the rest of the groin, or from blood emerging from a vein or artery, as will be explained later, or from wind trapped within it.
If it is before the break of the membrane and the exit of the fetus, then its color will be similar to that of the body, soft without pain, and various states will appear. If it is before the exit of the amniotic fluid, its state will be more different than what we described. When you press it with your fingers, it disappears and then returns. Sometimes it may have a bubbling sensation and enlarge greatly upon entering the bath or experiencing severe fatigue. If it is before the wetness, then it will be soft.
It does not disappear when you press it with your hand, nor does it increase or decrease. If it is before the bleeding, then the worm will appear black with these signs. If it is before firm flesh, then the worm will be flat and hard, fixed at a single degree.
If it is before the wind, its touch will be soft. The treatment for this is to observe: if the swelling has occurred before the bleeding of the veins, or the wind, or the air, then you should refrain from treating it, because in that there is danger and uncertainty, as I have informed you in the chapter in which I mentioned the tumors that occur before the veins and the artery.
If the intestine is twisted due to fluid or swelling, it is necessary for the patient to hold his breath and stand upright, stretching himself. Then use traction around the entire twist. Then command him to lie down on his back between your hands, then use a broad bandage around the twist in the place where you did traction. Then extend the middle of the bandage upwards with a large needle, then tie the bandaging place with a strong thread or cotton thread, tied and secure.
And the tying of the bandage will be in folds, then open the middle of the tightened bandage above the bandage and insert your little finger into it, and search for the fluid; if you find that the bandage has taken it, release the folds and push the fluid back into the abdomen. And if you find swelling, extend it with a needle.
And cut its tip, and if a vein or artery is in your way, bandage it tightly and return to your work. Then take two needles and insert into them two strong threads, then insert the two needles into the bandage that you made around the wound, solidifying them. Then tighten the wound on the needles in four places.
If you wish, remove the thread and leave the place until the flesh rots away from itself, or cut it if it becomes rotten and decayed, then treat it with what is necessary of remedies until it heals, for it is a wound of the flesh which has been pierced.
Or if it is from a wet wound, the worm should be allowed to corrupt as we have said and to discharge blood or moisture that you find in it, then treat it with what adheres to the place.
Chapter Thirty-Five
On treating cancer.
We have mentioned in the classification the types of cancer and how to treat it with medicines, and we warned against treating it with iron so that it does not become worse. We also mentioned the cancer that occurs in the womb and warned against treating it.
And the ancients mentioned that when the cancer is in a place where it can be completely excised, such as breast cancer or thigh cancer and similar parts of the body capable of being removed entirely, especially if it is early and small; but when it is advanced and large, it should not be approached.
For I have not been able to cure anyone of it, nor have I seen before me anyone who has reached this state; and the procedure in it, if it is possible as we have said, is that one should proceed to make the patient more easily endure the black hour, then corrupt it if it is in the veins clearly full.
Then, the patient is placed in a position suitable for surgery. Then, gather the tools used for cauterization. After that, cut him from all sides with the skin until nothing remains of his roots, and leave the blood to flow without cutting it quickly.

Chapter Forty-Five
In the treatment of hiccups.
We have been informed in the division about the types of dysentery, how water is to be mixed, and the symptoms of each type, as well as its treatment with medicines. The type that is treated with iron is only the bloody type, and neither the bilious nor the laxative type should approach iron.
If that does not work, if you have treated this type of bloody hiccup with medicines and your treatment did not cure it, look to see if the patient has excessive weakness or another disease besides hiccups, such as fever.
"If there is a swelling or protrusion, do not treat it with iron, for it will cause harm. If you see that the patient has abundant strength and no disease other than varicose veins, and he is neither young nor old, then the treatment should be to have the patient stand between your hands. "And an assistant behind him presses his abdomen with his hands, pushing the water down towards the anus. Then take a handful of wool in this manner:
"Limited to two directions, long and well-defined at the ends like a handful, except that it has some softness so that it does not hurt when used on the varicose veins; then check if the varicose vein is coming out from the anus.
"It is necessary to cut it away with a wide incision three fingers below the navel, over the anus. If the varicose vein is caused by liver disease, let your incision be easy from the navel downward three fingers. But if it is caused by spleen disease, let the incision be on the right side three fingers.
"It is also not advisable for the incision to be on the side where the patient wishes to lie, lest the pus flows to that weak spot. Then, with a sharp instrument, cut through all the skin. Insert the instrument into this incision and raise your hand.
In the ulcer between the skin and membrane, as if you are scraping it, and the amount that you scrape will be the size of a claw or similar. Then you bore into the membrane until the ulcer reaches an empty place, which is the place of water, then you take it out and insert into the hole the tool, this is its shape.
It is a tube made of thin reeds, either silver or copper, with three holes on the sides: two from this side and one from that side, as you can see.
Its end is blunt, similar to the tip of a pen, as depicted in this image.
At its upper end is a ring, for if the tool reaches the water, it will descend on its own due to the weight of the water, thus allowing the patient to be emptied of water in a moderate amount of time. For if he were emptied too quickly, it might cause him to die from shock.
Or it can cause him to experience a near-death shock, but you should empty [the water] according to his strength and what indicates the patient's condition by the strength of his pulse and the beauty of his color. Then remove the tool and let the water drain out, for it drains from its own weight.
Because of the skin that adheres to the hole on the cheekbone, which I have informed you to cover with that cloth, then remove the device the next day if you see the patient able to do so.
And it also exits a little water, do this every day as long as you are on guard and beware of mistakes so that only a little water remains. If you fear for the patient and leave too much water, bury him in hot sand.
And excessive sweating in the bath, sun, and making him endure thirst, and treating him with dry medications until he recovers, and beware of eating and drinking after the water is expelled as described earlier.
Chapter Fifty-Five
In the treatment of children born with their urinary meatus not perforated, or if it is narrow, or in the wrong place.
Some children may be born with their anus and rectum not perforated, so it is necessary to quickly perforate it within the first hour of birth.
To cut a very thin slice on this figure:
Then insert a thin wire of lead into the hole and tie it, leaving it in place for three or four days. If he wants to urinate, turn him away from it, but if not, return him. If you don't use lead, the urine passing over the area might close it up.
And as for those whose hole is narrow, it should be treated with lead as we have mentioned many times until it expands. Those among them whose hole is not in its proper place - and this is because some are born with the hole at the end of the bladder, thus they cannot urinate forward.
So that the semen cannot reach the womb, which is a very ugly cause, and the remedy for this is for the patient to lie on his back.
Then extend his bladder with your left hand strongly, and expose the tip of the urethra with a knife or a sharp reed as large as a pen, as if you are carving something, so that there is a hole in the middle, where the opening should be.
Be cautious during the operation to prevent bleeding, as it often occurs; deal with it by using something that can cut off the blood and heal the wound until it heals.
The Sixty-Fifth Chapter
On the hernia that appears in the scrotum, bladder, testicle, pus, and adhesion of the scrotum to the bladder.
Much of this ulcer appears in the analysis and is a severe flesh wound; it can be good or bad, so the non-bad one should be treated with a fine needle.
Cut it until you clean all of it, then place on it a cotton soaked in Egyptian balm, and after that treat it with date palm balm until it heals. However, if the ulcer is severe with a dark color, it is appropriate to use cautery after cutting and cleaning it.
If the ulcer is in the bladder and has not been incised, and some of the ulcers are inside the bladder while others are outside, it is appropriate to first remove the ulcer that is inside; when it heals, then treat the one from outside.
Because if you treat both together, the bladder is not guaranteed to be punctured. It may also appear in women and in the bladder with blackness and corruption; it is appropriate to cut off all that has turned black or will turn black or has rotted.
Then apply honey after that, mixed with finely crushed and sifted pomegranate peels and alum, then treat it with the rest of the treatments until it heals. If there is bleeding, use cautery with a crescent-shaped instrument like this:
The bladder is beneficial for both conditions, namely the bleeding and the wound if it becomes corrupt. So if the bladder is swallowed and its threads disappear at an inappropriate time, a tube of lead should be inserted into the path of the penis to prevent the patient from urinating. As for the adhesion of the capsule to the bladder.
And this adhesion only occurs in someone whose capsule is correct and it was not necessary for him to be cautious. It might also occur due to a wound or poison. In such cases, it should be scraped with a small sponge until the attachment dissolves and the bladder is freed from all sides.
If it is difficult to distinguish them by careful examination, some part of the bladder and the capsule should be scraped off, because the capsule is thin and may tear easily due to its fragility. Then separate the capsule from the bladder with a piece of thin cloth that has been soaked in cold water to prevent further adhesion.
Then treat it with a binding drink until it heals.
Chapter Seventy-Five
In the Purification of Boys and Treating Their Mistakes.
The opening is not something other than the separation of the connection like all surgeries, except that when it was done by our intention and use in children in particular, we must draw the best work on it.
And the easiest way leading to safety, so I say that the ancients did not mention the opening in any of their books because it was not used in their religions, and it is what we acquired.
By experience, and this is because I found most of the practitioners and surgeons using purification with the moose and with the scissors, and they use the ring and the tie with thread and cutting with nails, and I have tried all these methods.
Therefore, I found nothing better than purification with scissors and tying with thread, because purification with a moose often leaves the skin unsightly, as the skin of the foreskin is two layers; sometimes it cuts only the outer layer and leaves the inner layer.
Therefore, it requires a second cut and continuous pain. Purification with the ring is not reliable for cutting the tip of the glans because sometimes it enters its opening. As for purification with nails, it may cause tearing of the skin or spoil your work, especially if the child's skin is naturally short...

... Then, place on the boil a piece of boiled egg in rosewater mixed with good quality almond oil, and leave it until the next day. After that, treat it with the rest of the remedies until it is cured.
And this is an image of the scissors suitable for cauterization.
The scissors should be sharp, with a tube-like handle. The length of the blades should equal that of the handles, and they should be even. As for mistakes in cauterization, sometimes the inner skin is flipped or some of it during cutting. It is necessary to replace it with your thumb before the area closes.
Cut it on a level surface, and if you cannot hold it steady with your thumb, use tweezers to grasp and cut it. If three days have passed and the area under the tip of the inflammation is swollen and warm, leave it until the hot swelling settles, then scrape it with a scalpel.
Cut it according to your preference, and be careful with the tip of the inflammation; if a piece of the tip is cut off, it will not cause harm. Then treat it with what heals wounds from boils as described in our article on boils.
And if a piece of skin is cut off in excess and it becomes too tight, this will not cause much harm either. So treat it with what we mentioned until it heals.
Chapter Eighty-Five
On the treatment of retained urine in the bladder.
Retained urine in the bladder may be due to an obstruction by a stone, clotted blood, tumor, or protruded flesh, and similar things. If treated with what we have mentioned according to the methods of treatment described in the division.
And if the urine does not pass and you see that its retention is due to a stone that has caused damage in the neck of the bladder, it is necessary for the patient to lie on his back, then have someone sit on his stomach, pressing it towards his back, with the patient holding himself as much as possible.
Then the neck of the bladder will be forced to expel the stone, and urine will pass. If it does not pass as mentioned and the condition worsens for the patient, it is necessary to use an instrument called a catheter, which looks like this:
It is made of silver and is thin, soft, and hollow like the beak of a bird in its slenderness, long in proportion to the thickness of a hair, with a delicate nozzle at one end for drawing out the urine. To draw urine with it, take two threads and tie them securely at the other end with wool or cotton.
The end of the thread is inserted into the lower part of the catheters and tied with a knot, if there is any excess wool to enter into the tube and seal it like a plug. Then, the catheters are greased with oil or fat or egg white, and the patient sits on a chair.
His penis and scrotum are anointed with wet towels, oil, or warm water. Then the catheters are inserted into the anus along with them until they reach the end of the rectum, then the anus is lifted upwards towards the navel, and the catheters are pushed inside.
So when the anus is lifted, the catheters are pushed in until they approach the seat of the urinary bladder, at which point the penis is directed downwards and the catheters with it, then they are pushed until they reach the bladder, and the patient feels that they have reached something empty.
This is done in this manner because the passage through which urine flows has twists. Then, the thread with wool is pulled gently, for urine follows the wool. After removing it, urination occurs, and the catheters are reinserted.
Do not do that until the bladder is emptied and the patient feels relieved.
Chapter Fifty-Nine.
How to Catheterize the Bladder.
And the instruments that are suitable for this purpose are made of silver or hollowed out reeds, with a long tube attached to a feather, and it is intended to drip water and medicine into it. This is done using an instrument called the zarraqa, and here is its illustration:.
It is made of silver or a hollowed reed, with a long tube attached to a hollow feather, except at the end, which is sealed and contains three holes: two on one side and one on the other side, as you see.
The openings in which the fluid exits will be sealed exactly without excess, so that when it draws any liquid, it will draw it, and if it is expelled, it will be expelled to a distance, like the projectile used to throw oil during sea battles.
If you want to pour liquid into the bladder, insert the end of the zarraqa into the liquid and draw it up with the nozzle above. The liquid will then be drawn into the cavity of the zarraqa, and its end is inserted into the urethra as we described in the catheters, then the liquid is expelled by the nozzle.
And indeed, that moisture reaches the bladder until the patient feels it, and this is also a fine picture of a syringe with which the bladder is injected.
It is made of silver or lead, its top resembling a small bowl, and beneath it is a ring in which the rope is placed. Then, take the bladder of an animal and place in it the moisture with which you wish to inject the bladder. Tie it tightly between the two rings with a double thread.
And heat that moisture slightly over the fire, then insert the end of the syringe into the urethra, and press your hand firmly against the bladder with the moisture until the patient feels that the moisture has reached the bladder.
If you do not have a bladder, take a piece of leather and make it into a circle, then punch holes around its entire circumference. Insert a strong thread into those holes in the same manner as described earlier. Gather the circle together just like closing a bag after placing inside it whatever moisture, ointments, or waters you desire.
Then tie it to the instrument and use it as you would with the bladder, pressing firmly with your hand until the moisture reaches the bladder.
Chapter Sixty
On Removing Kidney Stones.
We mentioned in the classification the types of kidney stones and their treatment with medicine, and we noted the difference between kidney stones formed in the kidneys and those formed in the bladder, including all its signs, and we mentioned the stone on which manual operation is performed.
It is the stone that forms in the bladder specifically, and which passes into the urethra, and I describe it clearly and briefly.
I say that the stone that forms in the bladder is most common among children, and one of its signs is that urine exits the bladder like water in its flow.
And sand appears in it, and he complains of it and plays with it, and often holds it back, then spreads and the prostate appears with it in many of them. The illness is easier for children to recover from until they reach fourteen years old, while it is difficult for the elderly. As for young men, their condition is moderate between these.
And the one whose stones are larger, his treatment is easier, while the smaller ones, to the contrary. So when we come to the treatment, it is necessary first that the patient be injected with an injection that removes all the pus present in him, for it may prevent the stone from appearing during examination.
Then the patient is taken by his legs and shaken downwards so that the stone descends to the neck of the bladder, or it is pushed from a high place several times. Then he is made to sit between your hands with his hands under his thighs so that all the bladder becomes inclined downwards. Then you examine him.
And you touch it from the outside, and if you feel the stone in the bladder, then quickly make an incision into it, and if it does not fall out, take a needle and it is necessary to smear the middle finger of your left hand with oil if the patient is a boy, or the ring finger.
If he is a grown man, insert the needle into his anus and search for the stone until it falls under your finger; then gradually bring it to the neck of the bladder. Then press on it with your finger and push it out towards the place you want to make the incision in.
You command one servant to press the bladder with his hand, and another servant to stretch out both buttocks upwards with his right hand and the skin beneath the buttocks away from the place where the incision will be made; then take the needle with a curved point like this:
And cut between the anus and the vulva, not in the middle but towards the left side of the labia. The cut should be on the same level as the hemorrhoid and your finger in the anus, pressing it outwards so that the cut is wide outside and narrow inside to the extent that the hemorrhoid can come out.
Do not apply too much pressure with the finger in the anus, as this may cause the hemorrhoid to come out easily, and be aware that sometimes a hemorrhoid may have angles or shapes that make its extraction difficult.
Some are smooth, like a grape, and protruding, making their extraction easy. If it has angles or shapes, increase the cut slightly. If it still does not come out, it is necessary to squeeze it with a tight cloth, the tip of which should be sharp like a lancet.
To control the hemorrhoid so that it does not escape, you can insert a delicate instrument with a blunt tip beneath it. If it still cannot be extracted, widen the cut slightly. If too much blood flows, cut it off with scissors.
If there are more than one, first push the larger one into the rectum and make a cut on it; then push the smaller one afterwards, doing the same for each. If they are very large, do not make a big cut on them because this exposes the patient to danger.
If he dies or suffers from constant urine leakage, it is because the place does not heal properly, but try to push it out until it exits, or crush it with pincers until it breaks completely.
When you have finished treating the wound with pincers, bandages, patience and tightness, cover it with a patch soaked in oil, vinegar, rose oil or cold water to cool the heat of inflammation. Then the patient should lie on his back for three days without changing the dressing.
If the site becomes infected, wash it with plenty of water and oil, then treat it with dates and honey until it heals. If there is excessive heat in the wound, along with fever or similar symptoms such as blood clotting in the bladder preventing urination—this is recognized by the appearance of blood with urine—
Insert your finger into the wound and remove that blood, for if it remains, it will cause decay of the bladder and its corruption. Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt, and treat it according to its condition until it heals.
It is necessary during all treatment times to bind the thighs together and bring them close to secure the medicines placed on the spot. If the stone is small and has passed into the urinary tract and prevented urine from exiting, treat it with what I have described before it reaches the narrow part.
This treatment often dispenses with the narrow part, for I have tested this by taking an iron needle of this form.
A triangular point of steel, sharpened in a reed, then take a thread and tie it to the urinary tract below the stone so that it does not return to the bladder, then insert the needle into the urethra until the needle reaches the same stone.
Then turn the needle in the same stone a little by little, while you are perforating it until it pierces through to the other side. For then urine will flow from its usual place; then place your hand on what remains of the stone outside the urinary tract, for it will shatter and come out with the urine, and the patient will be cured.
If you are not prepared for this treatment due to an obstacle preventing it, tie a thread below the stone and another thread above the stone. Then press on the stone in the same urinary tract between the two ties, then extract it.
Then you suture the ligature and clean the clotted blood in the wound, and it is necessary to suture the thread below the stone so that it does not return to the bladder, and the other suture from above so that if the thread breaks after the stone comes out, the skin returns to its place covering the wound.
And therefore, if you have sutured the upper thread, it is necessary for you to lift the skin above so that when you release it, it returns and covers the wound as we said.
Chapter Sixty-One
In Extracting the Stone in Women.
It is rarely that stones occur in women, but if one of them has a stone, it is difficult to treat and there are many reasons for this: the first being that the woman might be a virgin; the second reason is that you cannot find a woman who will expose herself to the physician.
If she is a respectable woman or one of those with relatives, and the third reason is that you cannot find a woman skilled in this art, especially manual work; and the fourth reason is that the location of the incision for the stone in women is far from the location of the stone, so it requires an additional incision.
And in this there is danger, so if necessity forces it, it is necessary to take a skilled female physician, and rarely will you find one. If she is not available, then seek an honorable male physician who has a trustworthy companion, or bring a respectable woman familiar with women’s matters or a woman who knows some of this art.
She was summoned and commanded to examine all that she was commanded to inspect regarding the stone, first by looking to see if the woman is a virgin. If so, her finger should be inserted into her vagina to search for the stone; if found, it should be pressed under her finger.
At that time, she was commanded to tear it [the stone]. If she is not a virgin but has menstruated, the competent woman should insert her finger into the sick woman's vagina and search for the stone after placing her left hand on the anus and squeezing it strongly.
If she finds it, she should push it down from the mouth of the anus to below as much as her strength allows until it reaches the root of the thigh. Then she should tear it at the midpoint of the vagina near the root of the thigh on whatever side she encounters and feels the stone in that direction.
And her finger should not leave the stone, which is pressed under it; and let the first tear be small. Then she should insert the forceps into that small tear. If she feels the stone, she should increase the tear according to what she knows will make the stone come out of it. And know that there are many types of stones.
Small and large, soft and coarse, long and curved, with or without side branches—know their types to achieve what you desire. If bleeding prevails, sprinkle powdered alum in the area and hold it for an hour until the bleeding stops, then return to your task.
Until the bladder stone exits, use the same instruments mentioned for removing stones in men to assist you in your task. If excessive bleeding occurs and you know that the pulsation of blood is due to severed veins, apply pressure on the wound.
And bind it tightly with bandages and leave it, do not reopen the wound or remove the stone, lest the patient die. Then treat the wound. If after several days the bleeding stops and the wound heals, return to your task until you extract the stone.
Chapter Two, Section Sixty.
In the hollow of the urinary bladder.
The urinary bladder is a collection of fluid in the white spongy tissue that lies under the skin surrounding the egg, and it is called the sponge. It may be within its own special covering, which nature prepares for it in one part of the egg.
Until it appears to be another egg, and there is something between the skin of the vagina and the white membrane we mentioned, which only occurs rarely. This polyp arises from a weakness exposed to females, so this substance settles in them, and it may also arise from a blow to the female.
This moisture can have many colors, either a yellowish hue, or it may be red and bloody, or black and pitchy, or watery and white, which is the most common, as well as its signs by which it is recognized.
Where water accumulates, if it is in the white membrane we mentioned, then the worm will be long and round like an egg, and the vagina will not appear because moisture surrounds it from all directions.
And if the moisture is in its own covering, then the worm will be round on one side of the egg.
And for this reason, a person might think it is another egg. If the moisture is between the vaginal skin and the white membrane, then it settles beneath the skin. However, if you wish to know the color of the moisture, leave the worm in the square-shaped sponge that was shown earlier; whatever exits from the sponge will indicate its contents.
When treating with iron, the patient should be ordered to fast if possible and if his body is full. Then he should lie on his back on something elevated a little, and many hot irons are placed under him, then you sit on his left side.
And command the assistant to sit on his right, directing his penis to one side of the scrotum and towards the navel. Then take a wide needle and pierce the scrotal skin from the middle lengthwise almost to the base.
And the incision should be vertical, parallel to the midline of the scrotal skin, until it reaches the white membrane covering it; then clean it and be careful not to pierce it. Your incision will be closer to the testicle on the side facing the epididymis, and suck out as much pus as you can.
Then fill the membrane with lukewarm water and remove all of it, then spread open the edges of the incision with retractors, pulling the membrane upwards without touching the scrotal skin covering it. Cut the membrane in whatever way you can cut it—whether in one piece or in sections.
"And especially the thin side, for if you do not completely cut it, water will not be safe from returning. So, if the egg protrudes outside its skin during your work, once you have finished cutting the membrane, turn it back, then bring together the two edges of the skin with stitches.
Then treat it like any other wound until it heals, for if the egg is afflicted with another disease, it is necessary to tie off the vessels in the appendix to prevent contamination, then cut the appendix and remove the egg, and treat it as mentioned before.
If the water is collected in both sides together, know that they are two appendages; split the other side as you did with the first, even if you think it is one. Then wipe away the blood.
And place wool that has been soaked in oil or rose oil into the cuts, and from outside, place another wool soaked in vinegar and oil, stretching it over the two edges of the skin and the abdomen, then place a bandage on top, which is called the bandages. And tie them with a six-sided knot as shown in this figure:
Then take two bandages, sew and pad with cotton wool on this example. Make the edges that are used from cloth or wet wool and gather together with force in the waistband of the pants, and one of the edges is taken to the seat up to the back.
And the second one is taken towards the anus, and both edges on the thighs from below, and the two remaining edges on the buttocks, and all the force is gathered in the waistband of the pants, and this ligature can also be made with a reed instead of iron clamping.
And it is that a fine scalpel blade is taken and used to incise the skin of the scrotum, which serves as protection for what we have described, until the white spermatic sheath containing water is exposed. Then another blade is taken on this image:
And it resembles the Greek eye, then that sheath is perforated with it until all the moisture comes out, then the sheath is stretched with tweezers and the covering layer is shaved with a blade and cut as much as possible until all of it is completely removed, and one must be careful not to touch the testicle with fire.
"Know that this procedure is safer and further from causing bleeding than working with the scalpel. If you encounter an obstacle during the incision or while cutting, such as a hot worm, blood clot, or something else, it is necessary to treat each obstacle with the appropriate treatment as mentioned before.
"But if the patient is a coward and cannot endure this procedure, then use the cautery as I have described, for it has been proven to be effective.
"The watery ulcer requires the patient to sit on a high chair, then apply the cautery below it with a wide-banded blade, extending the cauterization along the body until the opening is wide enough for all the water to drain out. Then place cotton on the site and bandage it.
"Leave it to drain the remaining water, then treat it until the wound heals. If water does not come out while you are cauterizing it, it is because the white membrane blocks the mouth of the wound, preventing the water from coming out.
"Therefore, it is necessary to enter the wound with a piece of wool or the instrument used to draw out water from carbuncles, as shown earlier, or to slightly enlarge the opening of the wound.
"Know that water can return and reunite after six months or so; if it does, let him fast for the same duration, and he will resist illness.
"Chapter Thirty-Six
"On the Ulcer of the Flesh and Its Treatment.
"Know that the ulcer on this flesh is often fatal, so we leave it untreated and seek to be safe from it, while I describe the work done on it and the types of worms.
"I say that many ulcers occur in the bodies that are composed of fat, and this happens for many reasons: either from a slight excess of bile that flows to the fat, or from a blow; and the worm has the same color as the body and lacks water.
"The worm is dry, and sometimes the worm is leprous in color, having no odor; it may come from congestion of the veins and their swelling, as mentioned earlier, or from swelling of the lymph nodes. That which comes from congestion of the veins is known as a hot worm.
"If you press it with your fingers and it does not present a bruise, then it is from the swelling of the lymph nodes; nothing hot comes from this when pressed with the fingers. This type can ulcerate on it and on all other flesh.
He cuts the skin of the anus, then brings the egg to the top and removes it from the white sac, and frees the appendix from the bowels, and ties the bowels, and cuts the appendix after freeing it from every side of the egg, for if the egg has adhered to those raw meats.
It is necessary to remove the egg and cut it, and if there is adhesion between any of the sacs or between the bowels, then it is necessary to free all that adhesion and cut it in a circular section.
If the flesh of the tumor is in the place of adhesion which is from behind, it is necessary to cut all of it and remove the egg as we have said. Then when your action is complete, clean the wound with soft wool soaked in rose oil and drink, then treat him with the rest of the treatment until he recovers.
Chapter Forty-Six.
In the treatment of hernia accompanied by strangulation.
Strangulation is a tumor that grows in some parts of the groin, similar to testicles, and it causes women discomfort in movement, exercise, and walking. In the treatment of this disease, there is not much difference from what was mentioned earlier.
And it is necessary to remember the work on it as the ancients did, so I say that the patient should sit on a high chair, then push the testicles downwards, then grasp the scrotal skin with your fingers along with the vessels near the penis.
And another servant should grasp it and stretch it strongly, then cut with a wide, sharp knife whose edge is honed with the skin of the vessels until the vessels are exposed, then scrape from all sides as I mentioned to you in the suture of the veins in the fingers, then insert into them a needle with double thread.
And tie it in the first place where the dialysis has occurred, and also tie it at its end; then cut it in the middle with a standing incision along the length of the body, and expel what has accumulated from the foul, watery humors.
Then treat the wound with the usual treatment of wounds in which you desire the formation of a fistula so that one of the testicles falls off, as this is not harmful. If dialysis has occurred in all the vessels, it is necessary to remove one of the testicles along with the vessels, lest the egg be deprived of its food. From before cutting the veins, he becomes anxious and does not benefit from it.
The fifty-seventh chapter.
On the treatment of hemorrhoids.
The occurrence of this hemorrhoid is from a fissure that opens in the anal canal extending over the abdomen to about two fingers from the navel, and the pus from that fissure flows into one of the anuses.
And this fissure occurs either from the anal canal itself or from its extension, and these two types occur due to many causes, such as a blow, fall, shout, lifting something heavy, etc. Its sign is that if it occurs from the extension of the anal canal, it happens little by little over a long period of time.
And it does not occur suddenly, and the pain is constant to a depth of about an inch before the anal canal squeezes out the pus. Its sign, if it occurs from the anal canal itself, is that it happens from its beginning with severe pain in one go, and the pain varies visibly under the skin nearby.
And this is due to the pus exiting and its path leading outside of the anal canal, and it may exit with the pus, a worm. This hemorrhoid is then called both pustular and vermiculate. It may also be accompanied by a foul odor, and the pus can turn into gangrene, leading to the death of the patient.
If it causes severe pain and trembling, especially if it occurs in the morning, treating this condition with iron is dangerous. It is advisable to avoid it. The method is to instruct the patient to bring up the phlegm into his mouth if it returns.
Then he lies on his back between your legs, and you raise his leg up. Then stretch the skin over the shinbone outwards, and cut along the length of the shin all the way to the bone. Then sew up the edges of the wound with fine sutures, as needed for opening the wound.
The wound should be such that the egg can exit from it. Then scrape off the fascia underneath the skin of the shin until the white, firm fascia is exposed on both sides. At this point, insert your little finger into what lies below the bone.
Between the white fascia underneath the bone and the second fascia, you will find the adhesion that is behind the bone. Then with your right hand, reach into the skin of the shin and, at the same time, stretch the white fascia upwards with your left hand and raise the bone along with the fascia towards the edge of the wound.
The servant is ordered to extend the egg upwards and release the adhesion that comes from behind completely, and examine it with your finger so that there is nothing of the accumulated pus in the hard white membrane. If you find anything, push it down into the abdomen.
Then, take a needle with a thick thread that has been cut from ten threads, and insert it at the end of the membrane under the skin over the wound. Then, cut the ends of the thread so that there are four threads. Then, you tie some of them to each other in a knot and use them to tightly bind the membrane under the skin in two places. Also, fold the ends of the threads and tie them tightly so that none of the vessels that feed it can reach it. To prevent burning from that, and to make a second bandage outside the first one, less than two finger-widths away from it; after these two bandages, leave the membrane under the skin the size of the knuckle bone.
To prevent burning from that, and to make a second bandage outside the first one, less than two finger-widths away from it; after these two bandages, leave the membrane under the skin the size of the knuckle bone. And cut the rest all around in a circular manner, and remove with it the eggshell; then make an incision in the skin of the wound from which blood and pus flow as we described before. Then use cotton soaked in oil and place it in the wound, and use the bandage we described.
The white silk we mentioned, after cutting it, beware of blood clotting as that happens frequently. Leave the ligature until it falls off by itself. If its fall is delayed, then soak it in hot water and place on it what dissolves it until it falls off.
Then treat the wound with all the remedies for wounds until it heals.
Chapter Sixty-Six.
In this case of windpipe disease, I have not seen anyone dare to treat it with iron, and the ancients mentioned that it should be made as we described in the case of the throat with a tumor, which is to ligate the veins after making an incision on them from below.
Then make an incision in the middle and treat the swelling with what opens it until the veins fall off, and treat the wound as we mentioned until it heals.
Chapter Seventy-Seven.
In the case of fistula in the throat.
A fistula may appear in the throat as we mentioned, it does not drip into the trachea and if something does drip, it is a small amount that comes back at all times.
And if the time has prolonged on it, the pressure in the bladder increases until urine and feces pass into the intestines, and this appears as an extension of the bladder that exists in the pelvis, as we have mentioned. And that is because the bladder extends and then becomes inflamed, and the place is injured and ruptures. Its treatment is by cauterization as previously described.
It may also be treated with iron in this manner: the patient lies on their back between your hands, then you make a warm incision, one finger's width, extending three fingers below the belly button, and then you pull out the bladder that is under the skin.
Until, when the white bladder is exposed, you take a wool pad and place it on the exposed part of the bladder, pressing it into the depths of the abdomen. Then you suture both exposed parts to either side of the bladder and tie the stitches together.
Then you suture the wool pad and do not cut the bladder or touch the egg, as I have informed you about treating the urinary fistula. After that, treat it with the treatment for wounds.
Therefore, if the threads are cut, clean them and close the wound until it heals, for then the bladder will contract and the fistula will not increase.
And kai is the best in this place because it is closest to safety.
Chapter Eighty-Seven
On the treatment of skin ulcers.
Often, the skin of ulcers is treated in some people without treating the flesh within it, and its appearance worsens. Therefore, for those who wish to treat it, it is necessary to make the patient lie on his back.
And all the skin that has been treated is cut on thick skin, then the edges are approximated, and if you wish to suture it first, you can suture the edge of the treated skin with three or four stitches, and secure them from the stitch, then cut what is between the stitches.
Then treat it with the treatment of other wounds until it heals, and the sutures fall out.
Chapter Eighty-Nine
On excision.
It is forbidden in our religion to excise.
And for this reason, it was not appropriate for me to mention it in my book, but I have mentioned it for two reasons: the first is so that the physician has knowledge of it if he is asked about it, and learns how to treat one who regrets having done it; and the second reason is that we often need to excise some animals for our benefit. بالطبع، هذا النص يظل مختصرًا ولكنه يمثّل قدومًا أساسيًا في العلم والتكنولوجيا. إذا كان لديك مزيد من النصوص أو البيانات، يمكنني تقديمًا أفضلًا ومزيدًا من التفاصيل.
The cat, the weasel, and animals of that sort, I say their castration should be done in two ways: either by pressing or cutting. The method for pressing is that we sit the animal in hot water until its female organ relaxes and softens.
Then you press it with your hand until it dissolves and is not felt upon touching. As for castration by tearing and cutting, it is necessary to hold the animal and squeeze its scrotum with the left hand, then tie the ligatures and tear off each testicle with one cut.
Until the testicles protrude, cut them off after removing their sheaths and leave nothing on them except the thin sheath that is on the epididymis. This method of castration is better than pressing.
Because pressing sometimes leaves something of the testicles, and the animal becomes lustful for mating. Then treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter Seventy.
On the treatment of hermaphrodites.
The hermaphrodite in men occurs in two types: the first is that it appears in front of the penis or between the testicles, resembling a woman's vagina with hair, and urine may flow from what is in the scrotum.
In women, there is one type that occurs above the vulva like the small scrotum of a man, and it protrudes to the outside similar to the penis of a man, while the two [types] are like female breasts, and the treatment for these three types is...
The two types in men and the single type in women should have the excess flesh cut away until it heals, then treat it with the usual treatment for wounds until it is cured. As for the second type in men, where urine exits through a hole in the skin of the penis, there is no need for action or the cutting of the foreskin.
Chapter Seventy-One.
On cutting the lip and the protruding flesh from women's genitals.
The lip may sometimes grow to an excessive degree beyond what is natural, making it pendulous and unsightly. In some women, it may become so large that it resembles the penis of a man and extends to the point of copulation.
You should grasp the tip of the lip with your hand or a clamp, cut it off, and be careful not to cut too deeply, especially at the base, so that you do not cause bleeding.
Then treat it with wound treatment until it heals. As for the protruding flesh, it is a growth of flesh in the mouth of the uterus until it fills it.
To the outside like a beak. Therefore, some of the early ones call it "the beak disease." It should be cut like a boil, either way, and treated until healed.
Chapter Two and Seventy.
In the treatment of hernias.
A hernia is when a woman's vagina is not perforated, or if it is perforated, the hole is small. It may be natural and she gives birth through it, or it may be caused by something that has preceded, such as excess fatty tissue.
Or a thin or thick membrane, which may be in the depth of the womb, or its sides, or at the top or bottom, preventing intercourse, pregnancy, and childbirth, and sometimes preventing menstruation. Recognizing this is by observation from the front.
If the obstruction is prominent, do not delay in cutting it; if it is not prominent, explore it with her fingers or a probe. If the obstruction is from a thin membrane and is close to the lips, hasten to cut it by making an incision on both lips, then place your index finger inside.
The woman has an incision on her back, then the scissors are pushed strongly until they penetrate the thin fatty layer and open the outlet. Then she takes wool, soaks it in oil, and places it on the spot. Every day the woman gathers it together lest the place become inflamed again.
If the fat is thick, it should be cut with a wide chisel resembling an aspen leaf. If the outlet is fleshy and protruding, tie it with sutures, cut it off, and have with you medicines that calm inflammation without causing pain, such as agaric, syrup of violets, and milk mixed with egg white.
Then use a wide lead pipe so that the wound does not become inflamed quickly; keep it for several days and use a cloth of thick linen, then treat with the rest of the ulcer treatment until it heals. It may appear in the uterus another growth of flesh, which should be cut in this manner.
What is not a cancerous ulcer, for the cancerous ulcer that appears in the uterus should not be treated with cautery.
Chapter Thirty-Seven
In the treatment of fistulas, haemorrhoids, and red ulcers that occur in women's vaginas.
As for the fistula, it is an inflammation of the mouths of the vessels until blood flows from them continuously. If the fistula presents, it becomes a haemorrhoid, as mentioned in the division regarding its types and signs, which we will now mention.
What can be treated and what cannot be treated? I say that the fistulae and haemorrhoids, if they are deep within the womb and have not become apparent to touch, there is no treatment for them with iron. But if any of it protrudes from the mouth of the womb and is subject to touch, then these are the ones that can be treated.
It is necessary for the woman to enter a cold room, then she should protrude the haemorrhoids with a finger or with a rough cloth and cut them off at their roots, and then leave them if blood flows from one of the severing vessels without coagulation.
Such as alum, nitre, cheese curd and the like. Then she should raise her feet to the wall for an hour, then wash them in cold water. If the flow continues, place her on a pot of sumac boiling with pomegranate peel and unripe grapes, then take barley flour, cook it with honey and vinegar.
He sutured it on its back, and if the bleeding did not stop, he would compress the wound with two pieces of wood or two pieces of cloth without any condition. Then he took a wick, soaked it in the juice of thistles or the juice of almond branches or the juice of olive leaves with wine, and bound it to the place.
When the inflammation subsides, treat the place with marshmallow until it heals. As for the red tumor, it resembles the heads of burdock, which have a rough appearance; it is necessary to cut off whatever protrudes from it according to what was mentioned in the treatment of ulcers, and then treat it until it heals.
The Fourth Section and Seventy-Seventh Chapter.
When the hernia appears in the uterus.
Many types of tumors may appear in the uterus, such as cancer, ulcerated inflammation, wounds, carbuncles, fistulas, ulcers, abscesses, boils, and hot inflammation. All these diseases and their types and signs have been mentioned in the classification section.
It is necessary to mention in this treatise the hot inflammation that appears in the uterus, for if it is among those tumors that last a long time, how its cauterization with iron will be. It should be observed whether the pain of the inflammation at first is severe with throbbing and feverishness.
"If the scar appears red, do not rush to remove it and treat it with what promotes healing until these symptoms subside. Then, let the woman sit on a chair that has two seats and lean back against her.
"She should bring her feet towards the lower part of her belly, and let her thighs be spread apart, placing her arms under her knees and binding them together with a suitable bandage.
"Then let the woman sit facing to the right, and use the instrument that opens the uterus, whose image will be shown later. It is necessary, if using this instrument, to consider the depth of the woman's uterus so that what enters from the instrument does not exceed the depth of the uterus.
"The patient will be in pain if the instrument is longer than the depth, so it is necessary to place pads on the neck of the uterus to prevent the entire instrument from entering the depth of the uterus, and the spiral that moves inside the instrument should be placed at the top.
"You hold the instrument and an assistant turns the spiral until it opens the neck of the uterus. When the discharge appears and is touched by hand, if it is thin and watery, cut its tip with a wide blade so that all the matter may be evacuated.
In the wound, place a soft gauze soaked in rose oil or green oil with some mastic, and place the gauze outside the uterine incision in the neck of the womb, and place from the outside on the womb and the vagina clean wool soaked in boiling water with khubz.
Then treat it after two days with the ointment suitable for that, until it heals.
And the womb and the wound may be washed by injecting with water and honey, then with boiling water containing the root of sos or long zarand. Then return to the ointment, for if the discharge is persistent inside the womb.
It is necessary to avoid treating it with iron, but rather treat it as we have mentioned in the chapter on herbs.
Chapter Fifty-Seven.
In the instruction of midwives, how to treat the living fetuses if they come out in an abnormal form.
It is necessary for the midwife to know first the natural shape of childbirth, and among its signs is if you see the woman pushing downward and straining not to hold her breath, and what she is on relaxes on her.
The exit of the fetus will be quick, so know that this birth is natural and its exit will be from the head, with the navel or hanging from it. If you see these signs, it is necessary to squeeze her belly so that the fetus exits quickly.
If it descends with the head, the navel descends with it and is cleaned of those impurities in a good cleaning. Whatever remains of this birth, it is not natural and is abnormal because the fetus may exit feet first or its hands before its head and feet.
And if one hand or one foot exits, or the head with the hand, or it exits sideways and perhaps turns on its heel, and such are among the abnormal shapes. The midwife should be attentive and gentle with all these things and avoid mistakes and errors.
And I will explain each shape and how to deal with it so that you can rely on this and stand firm in it. If the fetus exits from the head, it is a natural exit, and it may be difficult for the woman and she may find it hard to push. If you see her strength has weakened, sit her on a chair and have women hold her.
And she pressed her belly with cooked pumpkin and wet compresses, then inserted the index finger between her toes with a small bean, so that it pierces the membrane or she pierces it with her nail until its moisture comes out and squeezes the woman's abdomen until the fetus descends.
If it does not descend, it is necessary to inject the woman with pumpkin seed oil and shiraj oil. Then command her after the injection to sweat and sneeze her, holding her mouth and nose, for the fetus will come out from its position. If the hands of the fetus come out first, it should be returned gently, little by little.
If she does not proceed to enter, let the woman sit on a stool and raise her feet above it, then shake the stool on the ground while the woman holds onto a stick so that she does not fall during the shaking. If the hands do not enter and the fetus dies, cut them off and pull out the rest of the fetus.
Or tie its hands with a rope and pull them gently, for it will come out. If the fetus comes out on its feet, it is necessary to push them upwards, then turn the fetus little by little until it is straightened. Then take one of its legs and extend it little by little.
If the two [sutures] went to the thighs, he ordered them to be cut and washed with vinegar, for it comes out. If it does not come out as we described, then return the fetus a little by little until it becomes natural, and then it comes out easily. If it still resists as we described all of it.
From the game of the fetlock and the game of the umbilical cord, and ointment made from fat and dissolved gum acacia, mix all in a pot well, then anoint with it the vagina of the woman and below her abdomen, then sit her in hot water until it reaches the knees.
If you see that it has come down below her, then make a poultice for her of mallow and she will sit on it. If the poultice is held for an hour, then sit her on a chair, wash her, close her mouth and nose, and press lightly below her abdomen. The fetus will come out within an hour, coming out with its legs and hands.
If it comes out in this manner, insert your hand little by little. Then the woman should squat on her knees, bringing her feet down while lying on a bed and clasping her hands. Then press lightly above her abdomen. Then remove what is under her feet of the bandages until she stands upright. If the fetus does not come out, take both her legs completely and move them strongly, then press lightly above the pelvis a little at a time until the fetus ascends above it. Then enter the midwife's hand and straighten the fetus a little at a time.
And order the woman to urinate until the fetus comes out. The fetus's exit is obstructed by one of its hands, occupying the space in her vagina. If she cannot push it out, make the woman stand and walk. If she cannot walk, let her lie down.
Shake her thighs violently, then use the spatula as described earlier. If labor pains seize her, sit her on a chair. Then arrange the hand and straighten the fetus to its natural form. Massage the woman and order her to urinate until it comes out.
The fetus comes out on its knees, with its hands straight. Its face will be towards its mother's back. It is necessary for the midwife to hold the fetus's hand and gently turn it a little at a time until it becomes upright. Then apply the ointments and bandages as we have described.
Then make her move slightly, and if she does so, seat her on the chair and tell her to lean to the right side. Then make her sneeze and blow into her nostril with kundis, for it comes out, the exit of the fetus is upright.
If it descends to the mouth of the uterus in this manner with the placenta, break the placenta with your fingernail until it is free from moisture. If it adheres to the face and neck of the fetus, cut it away from the uterus lest it suffocate and die. Then push the fetus back inside until it is in the correct position.
And order the woman to sneeze repeatedly, for it exits easily in this manner, the exit of twins or many fetuses. Know that twins are often born, and three or four may be born and live, but this is rare. As for five, it is unnatural; they do not survive.
And surround them, even if they are many, with one placenta, and separate them with a septum attached to the uterus of each one of them. They may exit as a single fetus exits naturally and easily, or they may exit as we have described, obscurely.
"For some, labor is difficult and their shape deviates from the natural forms we mentioned. Treat them as we described, and ensure that they are comfortable, cooperative, and capable of assuming any form with the help of the assisting midwife.
"It has been observed that twins in the womb may fall out, and they may be one, two, three, four, five, six, seven or more than ten. I have personally seen a woman give birth to seven, and another fifteen, all conceived as such.
"By the grace of the exalted and knowledgeable, all this should be part of the midwife's knowledge, for she might encounter such cases one day and should address them as required.
"Chapter Sixty-Seven
"On the Extraction of a Stillborn Child.
"If the dead fetus is not expelled by the treatment described in the section on treatments, and you are forced to use manual intervention, observe that if the woman has normal strength and there is nothing to fear from her condition, she should be made to lie down on her back.
The head will be inclined downwards, and its legs raised, with a servant supporting it from both sides or tied to the bed, so that the body does not collapse when the child is born.
Then, he will wet the mouth of her womb with wet cloths and linens, along with a mix of fenugreek and sesame seeds, then dip his hand in these cloths and linens and insert it into the womb gently. Then, he will search for a place to puncture the fetal membranes that are suitable for this purpose.
If the fetus is presenting head first, puncture the membranes in its eyes, nostrils, mouth, throat, under the chin, or near the armpits, or below the ribs.
But if it is coming feet first, then in the pelvic area and middle thighs. It is necessary to hold the membrane with the right hand and roll it between the fingers of the left hand, inserting the hand gently and puncturing the membrane in one of the places mentioned earlier.
Until it reaches an empty space, then puncture another or third membrane next to it, if necessary, so that the suction is even and does not lean to one side. Then extend the extension evenly and do not just stand upright, but move it in all directions.
It is not easy to remove it as it is done with the tooth when it is extracted, and between that it is necessary to soften the mucous membrane; if it holds on to a side then it is necessary for the receptive area to be anointed with some of the fingers with oil and enter them from the side in order to direct what is holding on. If part of the embryo comes out, the surgeon should move to other places.
It should be raised a little to do this until the fetus comes out completely. If a hand comes out before the other and cannot be returned due to its compression, then it is necessary to cut on it and pull it until all of it comes out, then cut it off.
Whether it is in the wrist or the forearm, you should do the same for the other hand and the feet. If the fetus's head is large and under pressure during birth, or if there is water collected on its head, then it is necessary to insert between the fingers a small spoon-like instrument.
And with it, you should pierce the head so that the water comes out, or evacuate it with a device called a vacuum extractor, whose illustration is provided along with the illustrations of the other instruments in the following chapter.
Thus do if the fetus has a large head, it is necessary to rupture the membrane or break it with forceps as we have said, then extract the bones with forceps. If the head comes out and presses at the time of delivery, let it be ruptured until the moisture in the chest settles down.
For the chest will be adhered at that time. If the chest is not adhered and does not approach for exit, cut in pieces as much as you can. If it is below the abdomen or has swelling, it is necessary to press until the moisture flows out from it.
If the fetus is with its feet, drawing it out is easy and aligning it to the uterine mouth is gentle. But if it presses at the abdomen or chest, it is necessary to draw it out with a hook that you have folded over your hand, and then rupture the abdomen or chest until what is in them flows out.
If the rest of the limbs have been removed and the head returns and lodges, let the left hand enter. And if the uterine mouth is open, let it enter into the neck of the uterus and seek with it the head, then draw it to the uterine mouth with the fingers. Then insert a hook or two hooks into it and draw it out with them.
If the uterus is adhered to a hot ulcer, it should not be treated forcefully, but rather moist dressings should be used at that time, and wet compresses should be applied, sitting in warm water.
And if the fetus is on its side, it should be leveled out as we mentioned for a live fetus. If that cannot be done, then cut and remove it, and nothing of the placenta should remain inside. After completing your treatment, use what was mentioned for treating hot ulcers in the womb.
If there is a hemorrhage, it should descend into constricting water and the rest of the treatment should be applied. I have seen a woman who had a miscarriage and her fetus died in her womb; then she conceived again.
Then the other fetus also died, and after a long time, an ulcer appeared on her belly, which swelled until it burst open and discharged pus. She was then treated for it for a long time, but the wound did not heal. So she placed on it some of the strong adhesive resins.
He emerged from the abdomen a bone, and after some days another bone emerged, which astonished me because the abdomen is not a place for bones. I considered that it might be bones of a dead fetus. So I explored the wound and extracted many bones from the head of the fetus.
I continued to follow this until I extracted many bones from her, and the woman was in good condition. She lived for a long time with a continuous flow of pus from the site, and that is why I have come here to present this case.
For in it there is knowledge and assistance for what the physician tries to do with his hands in treatment.
The Seventy-Seventh Chapter.
In it are images of the instruments needed for extracting the fetus.
Image of a tool used to open the mouth of the uterus:
This tool, as described in the books, should have two handles with a hook at each end. However, this hook must be gentler than the tool and made either of ivory or boxwood, with each handle being two fingers wide.
And the two handles should be about a finger in length and one and a half fingers in width, and between the handles there should be two pegs of the same wood, firmly fixed into them, with each peg being at least half a finger in length and about two fingers in width.
The two that enter the uterus to open them when you deal with the ovaries, an image of another device similar to this, elegant and finer.
It is made of olive or fig wood in the shape of tongs, except that at their ends there are two drivers as you see, each driver's length is about a finger and its width is two fingers. If you want to open the uterus with it.
Make the woman sit on a low bed, with her legs spread wide between her thighs. Then insert these two drivers firmly into the mouth of the uterus, while you hold the end of the tool below between her thighs. Then open your hand with the tool as you would with tongs, according to whatever degree you want to open the uterus. Until you make it suitable for what you want, an image of another uterus is mentioned at the beginning.
An image of the device that expels the fetus:
An image of the device that extracts the head of the fetus.
It resembles a pair of scissors, with teeth at the ends as you see. It can be made straight like tongs on this image, as you see it has teeth like those of a saw that cut and tear.
"Image of a cannon as well:
"Image of a siege engine:
"This siege engine should have a little lead in it, so that it does not break when drawing the missile with it. Image of a double-hooked siege engine:
"Image of two wide scissors for cutting the arrowhead:
"These instruments, the more varied their types and the better prepared the craftsman is to make them, the faster he will be at making them and the higher his standing among people for his skill. Therefore, it is not appropriate to dispense with an instrument that you are well-prepared to make, as there will always be a need for it.
"Chapter Eighty-Seven.
"On Removing the Catheter.
"If the catheter becomes stuck after blowing, it is necessary to order the patient to hold their breath, then blow into it with the mouth and press your hand over their mouth and nose. If it comes out this way, well and good; otherwise, take a pair of tweezers.
"And make a hole in the lid through which to insert the opened herbs for the womb, such as fennel, aniseed, hyssop, and the like, all these drugs or some of them. Soak them in water and carry them over the fire. Then place a silver tube over the hole in the pot's lid, and the other end into the woman's mouth.
Hold it until the steam reaches the bottom of the womb, then inject as we have said, for the abscess will quickly exit. If after this treatment it does not come out, order that the patient immerse her left hand in Shirag oil or Khutami oil.
Then insert it into the abdomen and search for the abscess with it; if she finds it, she grasps it and slowly pulls it out until it exits. If it is attached deep within the womb, insert the hand as we have described until you find the abscess, then gently pull it towards the vagina.
To prevent the womb from falling out during strong pulling, it is better to move it gently to the right and left sides, then gradually increase the strength of the pull. At that point, it will be easy to remove and free itself from attachment. If the mouth of the womb is narrow, we have already described the treatment with injection and the use of suppositories.
If it does not come out with all that we have described, be cautious not to be harsh with her during repeated pulling. Instead, tie what has come out of her to the mouth of the womb and then to the woman's thigh. Then inject her with fourfold mercury, as it will make it rot within a few days.
It dissolves and exits, except if it putrefies, then a foul smell rises from it to the stomach and head, causing pain to the patient, so it is necessary to use suitable smoke.
Therefore, some of the ancients have tried smoking with hemp and dried figs. This is an illustration of the device used by women to fumigate during menstruation and similar conditions.
It is made of lead resembling a bowl or made of copper, placed with the narrow end in the vagina and the wide end on the fire, with incense burned on charcoal held until that incense vanishes and another is put on.
Chapter Ninety-Seven.
In treating hemorrhoids other than those that are ulcerated.
Many children are born with hemorrhoids that are not ulcerated, but sealed with a thin membrane. It is necessary for the midwife to puncture this membrane with her finger or, if she cannot, to cauterize it with a hot iron, taking care not to touch the muscle.
Then place on it a wool swab soaked in wine and oil, and treat it with compresses until it heals. If there is fear that it may close again, insert into the opening a lead pipe for many days and remove when the child desires to defecate.
"It is also possible that the swelling of the wound or ulcer may be caused by a constriction. This constriction should be cut open, then treated with the remedies and ointments mentioned.
Chapter Eighty
"On the treatment of hemorrhoids occurring in the lower part.
"The hemorrhoids that occur in the lower part are swellings and hardenings that happen near the anus, either externally or internally from one of the directions, and there may be one hemorrhoid or more.
"But if that swelling bursts and watery, white or thin, pus-like fluid comes out of it, some of these hemorrhoids may have penetrated to the bladder or the intestine, while others remain unpenetrated. The penetrating ones can be identified by what comes out of them in the form of discharge and foul odor when the patient is using the bathroom.
"Sometimes worms come out of them, and if they are internal hemorrhoids that have penetrated into the rectum or the course of the penis, or into the groin joint or the buttocks' tendon, what is known as the hemorrhoid that has penetrated into the anus can also be recognized, even if it is not penetrating.
Insert your little finger into the anus, and insert a thin wire made of copper or iron if there is no pain in the anus. If there is pain, then insert a thin lead wire or a horse hair into it.
Until you feel the wire or the hair in your finger, if the patient does not sense it and nothing exits from the hole, neither wind nor odor as we mentioned, know that it is not successful, so proceed with treatment.
If the anus is open to the bladder or the urethra, the sign is that urine exits from it and does not allow the place to be treated with drugs. However, if it is open to the pelvic joint or the end of the penis, the sign is the arrival of the wire there.
If there is no pain in the bone, constant presence of pus, persistent failure to heal with treatment and does not respond to cauterization, these fistulas are all incurable for the patient.
Its treatment is useless for those who are imagined by the ignorant doctors, but for those that are not open and not narrow, healing can be hoped for with iron according to what I described and tested, which is that the patient lies on his back between your hands on his back.
He will bend his leg up and his thigh towards his stomach, then insert the copper or lead rod, if it is in Nasur, until he learns where the rod ends. If the patient feels it near the joint, it is necessary to insert your finger into the joint.
If you feel the rod in your finger has pierced through on its own, without anything between your finger and it except for bone or flesh, then know with certainty that it has exited. Do not attempt to pull it out, for there is no benefit in doing so, as we have said.
They say that it heals by itself in some people, but the recommended treatment is to insert a thin probe into the wound according to the size of the joint, as previously mentioned, and place a protective cover on the joint until it reaches near the joint, then repeat this two or three times.
... until you know that all the excess, pus-filled flesh, resembling a bird's quill, has been burned away. Then treat it with a poultice of oil-soaked linen until the burnt flesh comes out, then treat it with salve. If he is cured, it is good.
And otherwise, he will not be cured by any other treatment forever. As for if the needle entered but did not reach your finger that is in the chair, and there was a thick layer of flesh or fat between it and the needle, you would see the syringe on the skin surface, at that moment the skin would split from the beginning of the syringe. And you pass through the split with the syringe while it is in the syringe until the split reaches where the end of the syringe ends, and the syringe is released and falls out, then that swollen flesh which resembles a bird's feather tube is cleaned, and nothing remains from it.
Then treat it with boiled wool until he is cured. If bleeding prevails over you and hinders your work, it is best and most beneficial to cauterize that flesh with fire or a strong cautery, because burning with fire achieves two good things: burning away the excess flesh.
Then cut the blood and wash away the moisture, then treat it with boiled fat in oil or powdered sulfur mixed with oil until the place swells and the burned flesh comes out with the swelling. Then treat the wound at that time with soft boiled wool for firm flesh.
The medicines that cause constriction and dissolution; if they are forced, he is cured, and there is no fear of recurrence. If the tumor has reached the depth of the seat and moved away from the surface of the body, insert your finger into the seat and search with it.
And if you feel the tumor between you and it, there is a barrier of skin or flesh close to breaking through, do not act on it except with hope and patience. That is, use one of three methods: either you cauterize it as we said.
Or you pierce it until you reach its cavity, so that you can insert the probe and treat it from close range, and do not stop with the piercing lest you cut the muscle surrounding the seat and cause an involuntary discharge in the patient. Then treat him as we mentioned, and perhaps he will be cured as we said.
Or you penetrate that barrier and perforate it after piercing it close to the seat, either with the tumor or another sharp instrument, then clean all the rotten flesh in the entire perforation as far as you can.
Then, he treated the wound completely with the upper jaw and the palate until it is closed, leaving the nose open inside the chair; this way it will be less painful for the patient, and the nose may also heal in this manner.
And if the probe has entered the nose and is in one of the sides of the chair, with the skin and the rim of the seat, then take at that time a drill pierced at its end like a needle, as in this figure:
And thread a needle with five threads or so, then insert the probe through the needle into the nose until it reaches its depth. If it is an opening in the rim of the seat from within.
Then pull the thread out from that hole so that your finger enters the seat and pull the end of the thread out, and bring both ends together and tie them tightly, leaving it for a day or two. As the flesh cuts through the thread, tighten it well until those pieces of flesh between the ends of the threads fall off. Then treat the wound until it heals and is cured.
But if the nasal passage is not open, then open it as best you can, except that it should not be deep to avoid cutting the artery. Then treat it as mentioned until it heals.
The image of the cauterizing instrument used for cutting blood vessels is very sharp on one side and not sharp on the other, so that it does not cut what is not needed, as you see:
Chapter One Hundred Eighty-One
On the cutting of blood vessels from which blood flows, and their removal and treatment.
The blood vessels will be on two types: either they are inside the stomach, resembling veins of grapes or like grape seeds, some small and some large; and from them blood always flows.
And there will be one or many, and they can be outside the stomach in its surroundings; except that those which are outside the stomach are usually less moist and from them flows a little yellowish water or very little blood continuously, and their color is that of the body.
The treatment for those inside the stomach is to advise the patient to exert himself and sweat until the stomach comes out, and the vessels become visible to you; then hasten and tie them with threads or hold them with your fingers, then cut them at their roots. If they are slippery due to moisture, use a ligature.
Scratch it with a coarse nail or a piece of hardened leather, or draw it out with your fingers, then cut it off. After cutting, sprinkle some sharp thorns on it so that it stands in its place, or open it as you find appropriate for the case of hair loss.
Then treat it with the rest of the remedies until it heals. If you do not have a place to sit out, inject the patient with a little painful dose so that they can wash off what is on the seat and rush out quickly when the patient gets hotter, for external abscesses outside the seating area are easier to deal with.
And if you take it with your fingernail or hang it with a thong and cut it off, then treat it with what we mentioned until it heals. And whoever dislikes cutting with iron should use silk for this purpose; take a thin thread and insert it into the needle.
Then draw the thread up and pierce it with the needle from the other side of its base, and let the ends of the thread hang below the needle, which is tied. Pull the thread tightly and firmly, then tie off the thread and remove the needle. Do this for all abscesses, leaving one uncut.
To release the blood from it, then place on the chair a strip soaked in rose or cypress oil, and place it on the chair, and order the patient to sit still, then leave him until he falls asleep. If he falls asleep, treat him with bandages and the rest of the treatment until he recovers.
As for the treatment of cracks, they often present with dryness and the inability to heal. If it persists and does not respond to medicine, it is necessary to scrape it with a sharp blade or your nail until it becomes moist and the top layer that prevents healing peels off.
Then treat it until it heals completely. If it does not heal, repeat the scraping more aggressively than before until it becomes soft and supple, then treat it, for it will recover.
Chapter Two: Eighty
In the treatment of dislocated and non-dislocated fingers, and dry gangrene and ulcers.
The toe is a circular swelling resembling the head of a toe, found throughout the body, particularly in the soles of the feet and toes, causing pain when walking.
It is necessary to cauterize around the wire and hold it with a hemostat or forceps, then remove it from its base, and treat it. If you wish, you can suture it on what has been mentioned in the chapter. As for dry threads, one of them is a small rough frayed thread protruding above the surface of the body.
It often occurs in children's hands, and its treatment is to push the thread back and cut it or burn it with a silk thread or hair until it falls out. If you wish, suture it using what has been mentioned with fire or a sharp drug.
The inverted and uninverted threads can be removed with the instrument that I have mentioned in treating the wart. As for the wart, it is also a small frayed rough thread on the surface of the body, deeply embedded, and if cold affects it, it feels like the sting of an ant.
In the entire body, it is most commonly found in the hands. Its treatment is to take a tube made of strong goose feather or eagle feather and place that tube over the wart until the circle of the tube surrounds its edges. Then rotate your hand with the tube until it cauterizes around the wart.
You make it deep in the flesh, and peel off the membrane from its base. If you wish to do that, you can use a copper or iron tube like this image:
The top of the tube should be closed with a handle to facilitate holding and turning it, and if you wish to pull the membrane, you can use what has been mentioned in the chapter on the instruments.
Chapter Thirty-Eight.
In the illustrations of instruments used for injections in diseases of the bladder, rectum, and colon.
The syringe may be made of silver, tin, or brass, cast or hammered, and from this instrument small or large ones can be made according to the user's need. The ones used for treating young children should be small, and those with narrow or tight bladders should have very thin syringes. Image of a large syringe:
The upper end, where the plunger is attached, should be wide as shown here with a collar where the plunger is fastened as you see. The lower end, which enters the bladder, should be closed, very smooth, and have two holes on one side and one hole on the other side.
The opening should be of the thickness of a fatty part or slightly thicker, and the wick in which you place the medicine should be made from the pancreas of an animal or from the brain of a calf, shaped like a small envelope with a diameter of a hair's breadth.
And he should make many holes, rotating as he goes, with a thickness of a finger between each hole. Then enter that hole with a thick and strong thread of spun cotton, ten threads or thereabouts, and gather the wick like an envelope with it. Then, when placing the medicine inside it, compress it at the end of the syringe between the two stones with a firm and strong compression, then inject with it. This is an illustration of the circle of the wick and the hole.
And the way to inject it is to fill the brain or pancreas with medicine while it is very hot, taking care that it is not extremely hot or cold. Then let the patient lie on his back and lift his leg upwards.
Then place a pillow or cushion under it, and grease the end of the syringe with oil, egg white, honey, or something similar. Then insert it into the anus gently, then the assistant takes the wick with both hands together and squeezes it firmly until all the contents of the syringe are emptied into the rectum.
Then he will remove the syringe and instruct the patient to urinate against the wall. If the medication encourages excretion, let him hold onto whatever he can, even if it means spending all night doing so, for that is better than injecting into the bladder and hastening its exit; rather, let the injection remain until he is cured.
If there are piles or painful fissures in the anus, let the syringe be very fine and softer than those used for children. Here is a picture of a very fine syringe with its skin drawn over it:
Chapter Forty-Eight
In the treatment of wounds.
I have mentioned in the division how to treat what resembles ulcers, and I recall here their treatment with the hand and with medicines to perfection. I say that wounds differ according to what causes the wound and where the wound is located.
The objects that cause wounds are many, such as a thorn, stone, sword, knife, spear, arrow, or similar things.
As for the wounds according to their locations on the body, they are like the wound that occurs on the head, neck, chest, abdomen, liver, and similar organs.
I describe the treatment of some wounds to make them a standard and law for the rest of the wounds, and I begin with simple head wounds because the complex ones will be mentioned in the first chapter of this book's third part.
Then I say, if a simple wound occurs on the head and no bone is broken and it is due to the strike of a stone or something similar, and only the skin has been lacerated and the wound is large, and there is concern for the patient developing heat inflammation, then hurry and cauterize the area with the cautery iron. Do not delay in doing this and draw blood from him to the extent of his strength, unless there is an obstacle preventing cauterization, especially if the blood flowing from the wound is thin; let the cautery be against the direction of the wounded area.
Advise the patient to avoid overeating, drinking alcohol, and consuming thick foods, as they hinder cauterization. Let him reduce his food intake and keep away from meat and drinks. If heat inflammation occurs on the wound, apply a moistened cotton swab in rose oil alone or with a drink containing vinegar.
If the heat inflammation subsides, apply to the wound, if it is moist with its blood and has not changed due to the air, that which I will describe for you shortly after this. But if it has changed due to the air, apply some marshmallow to it.
Until the wound heals, then treat it until it is cured. If the wound is large and from a sword cut or similar, and its lips did not come together with the edges, sew them together by stitching as I have described in the chapter on abdominal wounds.
If the skin is peeled off and remains hanging, and there is no other support for it except in a movable flap, cut it off; then treat the wound with medicines that will induce firm flesh to grow instead of skin. Order the patient to eat foods that promote recovery, such as heads [of animals] and brains, and the like.
If there is a flap of skin that does not adhere to the bone, cut off the entire flap and use it as a dressing; then treat [the wound]. If there are veins or blood vessels in these wounds from which blood flows and the bleeding has not been stopped by medicines, search for the vein.
If bleeding does not stop, cauterize it with the iron and tie it off. If necessity requires and what we mentioned does not help, burn it until the blood stops. For these small, simple wounds, treating them is easy and their treatment is sufficient by leaving this cloth soaked in its own blood on them.
Before the air changes it, the recipe for sutures is to take a part of milk and two parts of honey, and three parts of burnt or unburnt lime. Grind everything together, sieve it, and apply it to the wound. Press firmly until it adheres well.
It should be sutured with blood, then pressed from above with wool and left without rinsing as long as it does not become inflamed. For the medicine will not come off until it is healed. Burnt lime alone can also do this if milk and honey are not available.
This method can also be used by applying it to many of the large wounds if the application is skillful and the wound is not yet dried out. However, if the wound has changed even a little due to the air, especially in summer.
It is not useful to apply this suture by treating it with what we mentioned, except that some cooked barley is placed on it or a paste of wheat flour made with water and honey is placed on it until the swelling subsides, then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
If the wound involves a fracture in the bone and it is mobile, then bind it with splints. I have mentioned the treatment of fractures of the head in another section. In case of a wound in the neck, if there is no separation in the wound and it is simple, then there is no difference in its treatment from that of a head wound.
And if a nerve from the neck or vein has been cut, then there is no treatment except to avoid treating it with anything that constricts severely, such as chains and shackles, because they injure the nerve and cause inflammation.
And do not place anything cold on the wound, for the essence of the nerve is cold and its connection to the brain, which is the noblest organ, will be harmed. Treat it with soft medicines, such as wool washed with pure water several times, moistened with oil or rose oil and violet.
And if it is washed with pure water and other minerals of this kind, as well as moist rags. If the wound is large, use stitching or close its edges with silk threads, then treat it until it heals.
If the wound has a cavity and there is a hidden pocket in its lower part where pus has collected, then open it in the lowest place within it. And if there is a severed vessel in the wound and you see his blood flowing out, then suture or ligature or cauterize it, as necessity requires.
If the wound has cut some of the veins or all of them, and the ligaments are intact, then bring together the edges of the skin by suturing over the veins. Do not touch the veins, but rather cover and return them to their natural shape. Then tightly compress it firmly and leave it for several days.
Then treat it with the medicines that have an astringent and drying effect until it heals. If the wound has affected the bone, then explore it. If there are fragments of bone in it, remove them all or as much as possible. What you cannot remove, leave it until the wound heals and clears up, making it easier to extract.
If the wound is wide, leave it open as we have described. And if a bone has eroded in the wound and become exposed, then treat it with what is mentioned for wounds in the chest and between the shoulders.
If the wound is from a spear or sword and you see it has a cavity, look to see if air comes out when the patient exhales. If so, know that it is a puncture wound. If there is no cavity and the blood is pouring out, do not apply pressure on it at first, nor bind it tightly, lest the blood be trapped in its cavity.
If the wound is near the heart, it will kill the patient. But place a poultice of sweet-smelling herbs on it and dress it twice during the day. If you do not have a poultice, place cotton in the mouth of the wound to absorb any moisture coming out of it, and let the patient sleep on his wound.
If the wound exudes pus after three days or more, and the patient does not experience shivering, yellow fever, or difficulty breathing, and you observe that his other conditions are good, know that the wound is healing. Treat it with lint and the rest of the remedies until he recovers.
If the patient experiences difficulty urinating and the pus is continuous, know that it has become chronic. Treat him by making an incision near the wound, so that the patient lies on his wound to drain what collects in it. If it has been some time since the chest or back wound occurred, treat it with sutures as previously mentioned.
If it is large or urgent, if it is small, then if it has affected the bone and cut from it splinters, examine the wound and hasten to remove those splinters. If they are clean, then remove them; if they are not clean, leave them until...
And heal the wound, for it will facilitate their removal; as for the other wounds that occur in other limbs, their treatment is according to what we have mentioned...
Chapter Fifty-Eight
On the wounds of the abdomen and the exit and suturing of the intestines.
The wound that exposes the abdomen may be large or small or medium. The large one may have intestine(s) coming out of it, making their insertion and suturing harder and more difficult.
The small wound may also be difficult in another way, as its return will be difficult. If the intestine is not promptly inserted into its place from the moment it comes out, it swells and hardens, making insertion difficult. Therefore, the best wounds are the medium-sized ones, for with them, returning the intestines is not as difficult as with these two types.

The drink that contains quince is better than water alone for dissolving wind, so if you see the wind has dissolved, then pour softened water over it, in which khatmi or khazzaz has been cooked, for it will help to pass easily through any effort.
If it is difficult for him to return after this treatment, then cut a little in the scar with the instrument used for cutting veins and tendons. The first treatment is better if possible; one only resorts to cutting after necessity and failure of other means. Here is an image of the instrument:
The tip of the one is curved and restricted, while the other is not restricted; its thin end should not be like a needle but slightly blunt, resembling a small probe as you see. If the wound widens and water enters it, it must be returned to its natural shape.
If possible, let him lie in the position suitable for it; if the wound is wide and in the lower abdomen, he should lie on his back with his legs raised above his head; if in the upper abdomen, he should raise his head and chest above the rest of his body.
"Similarly, if the incision is on one of the two sides of the abdomen, always make your aim and purpose the side with the wound, raising it higher than the other side; this should be done in major surgeries as well as in moderate ones.
"As for small incisions, place it as you see fit; then prepare a servant who is equal to you in skill. He should hold the entire incision with his hands and bring its edges together. Then he should uncover it so that you can proceed with the suturing.
"And this is the general method of suturing, which is to take a single needle or several needles according to the size of the wound; then leave from the edge of the incision an amount equal to the thickness of the flesh and pass a single needle without entering it into the edges of the skin. "Then, with the edges of the flesh beneath the skin on the inside, you pass the needle through until it exits from that side. The two edges of the skin and the two edges of the flesh are gathered together as four layers. Then, tie a double thread around the needle several times in both directions to bring the wound edges together firmly.
Then leave the thickness of the finger also and pierce another needle, then wrap it with thread as you did with the first needle. Do not stop doing this until the wound is filled completely with needles, and let the needles be moderately thick between the thick and the thin.
Because very thin needles quickly cut the flesh, and thick ones are also difficult to enter the skin, it is therefore necessary that they be moderate between thinness and thickness. It should not pierce the needle near the edge of the skin.
So that the flesh does not tear quickly and the wound does not open before it heals, do not also space out the stitching too much so that the wound does not refuse to heal. Then cut off the ends of the needles so that the patient is not disturbed during sleep, and make for him bandages from torn cloth on each side holding the ends of the needles.
And leave it until you know that the wound has healed, and this type of suturing with needles is suitable for small wounds because one or two needles may be enough to suture them.
As for the second type of suturing, it is to bring together the four margins, meaning the two skin margins and the two fatty margins, in one go with a needle that has a thread moderate in thinness and thickness. Then if you pass these four margins with this needle, return the needle from where you started with it.
The thread should fall braided from the top of the wound, so that the stitching is like the stitching of the bag that the sailor uses, and there should be a thickened fingertip between each stitch and the next. This stitch is known to everyone.
With this stitch, a wound that appeared on a man's abdomen was sutured; it was cut with a sword and its opening exceeded a finger's width, and it protruded from the middle of his intestine by about two fingers, and the tear was in the middle of the abdomen.
After I placed his intestines outside the wound for twenty-four hours, the wound healed in about fifteen days, and I treated him until he recovered completely. He lived many years after that, engaging in all his activities, and the doctors judged that it would not have been possible for him to recover if it had not been for this procedure.
And it is remarkable that I did not treat him with any drugs, for I was in a place where there were no medicines. So I would place cotton wool on the wound twice a day and I promised to wash it with honey water until he recovered.
As for one of the special types of stitching, I recall it on the authority of Galen, who said: Begin the stitching from the skin and pass the thread from outside to inside. If the thread passes through the skin and through the straight muscle along the entire length of the abdomen.
You left the border of the stitching on one side and passed the needle from inside to outside in the other border, then when you have brought it out, pass it again in this border the same way from outside to inside.
Leave the border of the stitching on this side, and pass the needle from inside to outside in the other border. With the same movement, pass it into the stitching until you have passed it all through to the border on that side.
Then begin also from this side, following the same line as the border that is on the other side, and bring the needle out from the skin next to it; then return it into that skin and follow the border of the stitching that is on the other side with this border of the flap.
Then bring it out from the skin on that side, and do this again, and continue doing so until you have stitched the entire wound in that manner; the character of this stitching is that it resembles the stitching for an eye patch over the eye.
As for stitching the flap from one side with the skin border and leaving it from the other side until you are done, this is a special kind of stitching that Galen also mentioned; this is his exact wording: "The edge of the wound must be drawn together with one or two stitches at the deepest part, and then the suture should be continued on either side, so that the ends of the wound meet in the middle without any gap." بأن الخياطة لا تسمح فى مراقّ غير فى أعماقه، ويجب أن تكون إبرة الخياطة دون زاوية، ولا تترك فى مراقّ المجرى غير فى أعماقه، ويجب أن تكون إبرة الخياطة دون زاوية،
And that is to sew it according to how the people of physicians sew by gathering each part to its opposite, for its problem is naturally in the seam. So they join the edge of the seam to its other edge, and the edge of the eyelid to its other edge, and that will be as I have described for you.
The needle should be threaded from the outside near you on the edge of the eyelid and passed through alone inside it, and the two edges of the seam are left. Then return the needle and pass it from the outside to the inside in both edges of the seam, then return it again.
Then pass it from the inside to the outside on the opposite edge of the eyelid, and this stitching is better than the easy common stitching, which I mentioned before. This is Galen's statement, and some have said that abdominal suturing can be done with two needles. This is because one thread enters both of them, and you start by inserting the needle from your side and passing it to the other side, and then insert the second needle from the opposite side of it and pass it from your side according to the stitching of the intestines in a similar manner.
Inform that the incision, if it is in the middle of the abdomen, its suturing is more difficult than other places in the abdomen. As for the treatment of the wound, its judgment in treating it is the same as other wounds, and that is because if you reach the wound quickly with its blood before the air changes it, and you return the moisture to it and mark it and judge it, then place on it the bandages soaked in honey.
If the wound has been altered by the air, then apply some of the marshmallows that you have prepared until it softens and the threads fall out and the scar tissue and pus are absorbed, then treat it as you treat other wounds until it heals.
If you do not have medicines, then apply cotton wool from the beginning until it softens and replace it twice a day as I have told you until it heals. For in most cases, if the wounds are simple, you will not need any other treatment, but if you fear that the wound affects the main organs with pain.
It is necessary to soak soft wool in warm oil or rose oil and place it around the places between the anus and the penis, for if he feels pain or inflammation in his wound, this often happens, so wash it with a black grape juice drink.
And especially if the abscess has reached the anus and turned into a gaping wound, know that what is thicker of the rectum is easier to heal, and what is thinner is more difficult to heal.
As for the abscess known as the fasting one, it does not accept healing from a wound where it has its roots due to the abundance of veins and their bones in it, and the thinness of its flesh, and its closeness to the nature of the nerve, but if what emerges from the wound is pus and you catch it early, return it to the rectum as you would with any other abscess.
If its discharge has persisted for a long time and it has turned green or black, then you should ligate it with thread above the place from which it discharges, to prevent bleeding, as there are veins and arteries in the pus. Then cut what is below that ligature.
And make both ends of the thread hang outside the wound from below it, to facilitate its pulling and removal when the pus falls out and the wound heals, which is mentioned for the wound that appears in the rectum. However, if a fissure appears in the rectum and it is small
It is possible that some people might develop gangrene, for I have seen a man who was pierced in the abdomen by a spear, and the wound was on the right side of the stomach. The wound healed and became firm, with pus and gas coming out of it. So I treated him without hoping for his recovery. I did not stop treating him until he recovered, and the place closed. When I saw that the place had closed, I feared for the patient that something bad might happen to his abdomen. However, no such event occurred, and he remained in good health. He eats, drinks, and has sexual intercourse, and he enters the bathhouse and performs his prayers in his service. Some experienced people have mentioned that when a wound occurs in the urinary bladder, it should be treated according to this method.
The treatment is as follows: take the heads of large ants and place one on each side of the wound, with its mouth open. If it bites and clamps its jaws shut, it will cut off its head and remain attached without dissolving. Then another ant is placed near the first one.
Do not cease to perform this with several ants over the wound, then replace it and suture the wound, for those heads remain stuck in the wound until the wound heals and clears, and the evil of the scab does not occur, and it is also possible to suture the wound with fine thread.
That which is taken from the silk of the worm that attaches to it after entering a needle, as that a portion of this thread is extracted from the silkworm and dissolved in butter, then tied at its end with a fine cotton thread, then this thread is inserted into the needle. And in it is the thread of the silkworm, with which the wound is sutured, then returned to the cavity. This technique of suturing with ants and silkworms is only on the path of hope and desire.
As for if the tear is large and wide, especially if it is in one of the thin membranes, there is no remedy and no clearing from scab in it.

In the treatment of hernia and hydrocele.
Know that every wound or ulcer, if it persists and advances and becomes a fistula and does not heal and the pus continues to flow constantly without stopping, it is called generally in any member a hernia, and we call it hydrocele.
"In reality, it is a benign tumor of white bone, without pain, having a cavity like the quill of a bird.
"And therefore some have named it a quill, and it may be wet at times, constantly exuding pus. Sometimes the moisture may cease, and this moisture may be abundant or scarce, thick or thin.
"In the section on wounds, it was mentioned that any wound which does not heal or grow flesh is due to one of nine causes: either because of a lack of blood in the body, or because its blood is poor, or because there is hard bone inside it and on its edges, preventing good flesh from growing. "Or perhaps because there is too much pus and putrefaction, or because the wound itself is rotten and the substance that nourishes it is of poor quality, or because the medicine used to treat it was not suitable, or because some corruption occurred in the region, such as an epidemic, or because there is something specific to that region.
"Or perhaps because there is too much pus and putrefaction, or because the wound itself is rotten and the substance that nourishes it is of poor quality, or because the medicine used to treat it was not suitable, or because some corruption occurred in the region, such as an epidemic, or because there is something specific to that region. "As was observed in the city of Syracuse, where it is difficult to cure diseases and slow to heal wounds by nature, due to the presence of a single bone or multiple bones. All these causes, their signs, and treatments using drugs have been explained in the section.
I must inform you here about the treatment of neuromas and synovial cysts that occur through manual work with the hand. Know that neuromas can occur in all parts of the body, some ending in large nerves or nerves, while others end in sinews.
Or to a hip, or a knee, or a shoulder, or an elbow from among the elbows, or a vertebra from among the back vertebrae, or a joint from among the complexly articulated joints like the hand and foot, and some of them extend close to the head or in that direction.
As for these neuromas of this nature, they are among the difficult diseases to cure, which do not accept treatment and dealing with them is a burden of ignorance. If there are neuromas that have not reached those locations I mentioned and hoped for their treatment.
And I intended to convey this knowledge by taking a rod of copper or iron, if the neuroma is near an artery, then probe it with that, and if there is swelling in the neuroma, then probe it with a thin lead rod because lead softens its body.
And it melts upon entry and swells towards the swelling, so if the neuroma has many openings that you cannot distinguish with the rod, then cauterize one of its openings because the moisture that is cauterized in it will flow towards the other openings and drain.
On it, then proceed with the investigation in any way possible to identify if there is a bone or nerve, or if the tumor is far from its center or near, or if it is a solitary tumor with multiple openings. Address all of this according to your ability to question the patient about the pain when you poke at the spot.
And similar to these are the indications and causes of ulcers. So if you have verified all this with certainty, then proceed to treatment with confidence, which is to observe whether it is.
The tumor appears to be close or in a healthy place far from the joint, nerve, vein, artery, or any of the places I mentioned to you; then cut the tumor according to what I have described and remove from it the rotten flesh and the excessive fat.
And whatever grows in its mouth from flesh or membrane, etc., and treat it until it heals. If the tumor is far from its center and stable, it should be cut deep as much as possible, then cleanse it of all its rotten flesh.
Then use the prepared cautery in the sharp medicines, and insert it into the depths of the wound that is reached by iron. Do this repeatedly until the sharp medicine consumes all the putrefaction remaining in the depths of the wound.
Then force him with the cauteries that cause the flesh to heal properly until he is cured. If he does not cure with that, then cut it according to what was described before. If the cause of the wound is bone and you find it sound, then examine it and cut it as I have informed you, unless something prevents you.
If it is a vein, nerve, or a limb as we have said, then if the bone is exposed and there is some putrefaction and blackness in it, scrape it until its putrefaction goes away. Then treat it with what heals until it is cured; if it does not heal and the swelling continues as before.
Know that you have not reached all the discharge of putrefaction, so uncover everything on it a second time and scrape it and cleanse it with great effort, then cauterize it. If it is healed, and if not, know that this putrefaction is in a deep recess far from the putrefaction, so uncover everything on it a second time.

If the bone is a large one, such as the shinbone or thighbone and its surroundings, and only its head has rotted, then scrape it with a vigorous scraping until that blackness and rot disappear. Then force the wound to close. But if what has rotted from it is a large part, and the rot has reached the marrow of the bone, then there is no choice but to amputate it.
And cut it all the way until the rot ends, then treat it so that it heals. I inform you of an example: a man presented with a wound in his leg to illustrate and aid your treatment; this man was old.
Around thirty years ago, he had a pain in his leg due to an internal movement that caused the humors to reach his leg and become infected with a severe infection, with no external cause. Then time passed with the errors of physicians until the infection burst open.
And much pus and bad treatment of it ensued until the leg became swollen, with many openings, all of them draining pus and body fluids. A group of physicians treated him for about two years, none of whom was skilled in manual art.
Until I aimed at it, I saw its leg and the matter flowing from those mouths with great force, and the man had become emaciated and his color yellowed. So I inserted the probe into one of those mouths, and the probe went to the bone, then I searched all the mouths.
I found them spreading from one to another in all directions of the leg, so I hurried and cut into one of those mouths until I exposed part of the bone and found it rotten, darkened, and decayed with holes that penetrated to the marrow. Then I scraped out what was revealed to me.
I was able to remove the rotten bone, and I believe that there is no rot in the bone except what I cut out and scraped away. Then I treated the wound with a cauterizing medicine for a long time, but it did not heal. So I returned and uncovered the bone again above the first exposure.
I found the rot connected to the bone, so I scraped out what was revealed to me of that rot as well. Then I tried to cauterize it, but it did not respond and did not heal. So I uncovered more and continued to cut pieces of the bone one by one and cauterized the wound, but it did not respond until I had cut off almost the entire bone.
I extracted it with a hook, then reduced it with medicine, and it healed quickly and completely. This repetition in his condition was necessary due to his weakness, lack of strength, and my fear for his life, as he would experience excessive bleeding at all times. Now he is fully recovered.
A piece of flesh grew in the place of the bone, and his body recovered, his strength returned, he moved around freely, and no foot ailment hindered him while walking, for if the bone had broken in some part of the body.
It should be splinted in this manner: take a bandage and tie it at the end of the broken bone, then instruct someone to extend it upward, and another bandage made of coarser wool than the first one should be used.
Then tie it to the flesh under the bone, extend its end to pull the flesh downward while exposing the flesh from the place you want to saw, so that the saw does not injure the flesh. Place a piece of wood or board firmly under the bone from below.
Because if you do this, the saw will not be prevented from cutting the rotten bone, and it is necessary for the sawing to be above the rotten area slightly so that there is no rottenness in the bone cavity, which does not appear on its surface by touch, forcing you to saw it again.
And if the bone is rotten and not connected, but some of it is connected to others, and the rot is in its center or part of it, then expose all the flesh around it from all sides, then place a board underneath it, then saw it from the first side where the rot is.
And when you finish sawing it, saw it from the other side, and let the sawing be a little distance from the rot as we said. If the rot is in a joint, cut off the rotten joint itself and saw the bone where it connects from the other side.
And if the rot is in the connection between two joints, there is no solution other than to saw through it. If the rot is in the wrist or ankle, then its treatment is very difficult, but you should scrape off the rot as much as possible and saw it, and clean it in any way you can.
And by any means that you can keep it straight when no vein or nerve has been encountered, and know that the cuts and saws for cutting these bones are many according to the position of the bones and their installation, and their hardness, softness, largeness, smallness, toughness, and tenderness. It is therefore necessary to have a tool specific for each type of work.
And know that the operations themselves will indicate to you the type of instrument needed for them, if you have a long experience and knowledge in these arts; because mastery of the art and having seen various diseases will enable you to understand. Therefore, he can deduce for himself the tools needed for each disease; I will illustrate for you in the rest of this chapter a number of instruments.
Make them exemplary designs, and a standard by which to measure others; may Allah grant success. Image of a saw:

Chapter Seventy-Eight.
On the cutting of edges and sawing bones.
The edges may become corrupted, either from an external cause or an internal one. If this corruption is treated with medication and the treatment does not heal, and you see the corruption spreading in the limb, nothing will prevent it.
Therefore, it is necessary to cut off that limb where the corruption reaches, in order to save the patient from death or great suffering, which is greater than losing the limb. A sign of its spread is that the limb turns black, as if fire has burned it.
And it rots after blackening, until that rotting reaches the rest of the limb, and he takes it in the body's mass. So he quickly cuts it off, and similarly if the cause of decay is from bites of some creatures like a scorpion or an asp or a tarantula, and so on.
If the decay or bite is at the tip of the finger, cut off the finger so that the decay does not spread to the hand. Similarly, if it is taken in the hand, cut it off from the base of the wrist and do not let the decay spread until it reaches the forearm.
Similarly, if it is taken in the arm, cut the arm at the joint of that same limb. If the decay spreads and you see it reaching towards the shoulder, do not cut off the shoulder. For doing so would mean the death of the patient. Use other treatments according to your ability.
Similarly, if the decay is in the foot, cut off the toe at one of the joints. If it is taken in the ankle of the foot, cut off the foot at its root. If it spreads to the leg, cut off the leg at the knee joint.
And if the decay has reached above the knee, there is no remedy for it except to leave it and let the patient die. The method of cutting off a limb or sawing it is that you tie a ligature below the place where you want to cut and tie another ligature above the place.
He should stretch one end of the ligature downward and the other upward, and he should scrape the flesh between the two ligatures with a broad knife until all the flesh is exposed, then cut or tear it, and cotton bandages should be placed from all sides.
Lest the saw touch the proper place, it will cause the patient excessive pain and intense burning. If bleeding occurs during your work, quickly cauterize the area or apply some of the astringents that stop bleeding, then resume your treatment until you are finished.
Then fasten the wounded limb with a suitable ligature and treat it until it heals. I tell you about a case of a man who was cut in his leg by this slicer that I described to you, for it happened that in his leg there was a mark with a burn like fire.
That corruption began first in his finger, until it took the whole man. When the man saw that the corruption was spreading in the limb along with the intense pain and burning, he cut off (the affected part) at the joint, and he was cured.
After a long time had passed, that corruption appeared in his little finger by the same token, so he came to me. I cut off that finger with what was on the hand of medicines after cleansing his body, but the finger did not fall off and the pain spread to the next finger.
Until the gangrene spread to his hand, he called me to amputate his hand, but I refused and hoped for the recovery of that favor, fearing for him death upon amputating his hand because the man's strength was declining, so when he despaired, I returned to my homeland.
It was reported to me that he later regained consciousness and amputated his own hand, thereby recovering. I narrate this story only as a support for similar cases of this disease, and as an example to be followed.
Chapter Eighty-Eight
On the Treatment of Abscesses and the Method of Injecting Them with Medicines.
If a boil occurs in any of the fleshy parts and the duration of the boil lasts until it collects, then bursts or ruptures, and everything inside it comes out, leaving the place empty as if it were a bowl.
And the skin on it is like parchment, slightly thin but not so deep as to affect bone or sinew or ligament, and from here it deserves to be called an abscess and not a carbuncle, unless its duration lengthens to the point that decay affects any of these parts.
When it is called naswar or zakama, its treatment is to cut all that skin as it turns, especially if it has become thin and like parchment, and one is assured that it will not adhere to the place due to its putrefaction.
If you fear that the skin may adhere and it has not reached the degree of putrefaction, and there is some flesh in the skin, then treat it with a syringe, which is to look at the abscess; if it is large and its neck from which the odor exudes is long, inject it with the Egyptian medicine.
The composition is vinegar, oil, honey, and a kind of berry in equal parts, mixed together in a vessel and cooked over fire until the medicine boils to the consistency of honey. Then take from it what you need and dilute it with water and honey, and inject it into the abscess, plugging its mouth and leaving the medicine in it for two hours.
Then you expel it with pressure, doing this daily until the abscess is clean and the odor disappears. If this medicine is not available, you can inject ashes water by taking ashes of vine branches or ashes of pear tree branches and pouring water over them.
Then cleanse it and rinse it until you are certain that the wound has been washed. If the patient does not have access to Egyptian medicine or alum water, then rinse it with water mixed with honey in which some powdered cinnamon has been dissolved.
Or rinse it with honey and wine mixed together, for honey cleanses and washes, while wine binds the wound, especially if the wine contains some vinegar. If you do this several times and are certain that the infection has gone, then rinse it with something that promotes the growth of flesh.
Such as taking from the kernels of dates and soaking them in rose oil and strong wine, or rinsing it with some medicines and other kernels whose properties we have proven in our treatise on kernels. If the wound is too narrow to insert a syringe,
If it is too narrow, widen it slightly with a bit of iron or insert a thread soaked in Egyptian kernels or cumin seeds until it expands. Similarly, if the mouth is also wide, gather its edges with stitching and leave an opening just enough for the syringe to enter without excess.
And likewise, if the patient’s mouth from which the pus is flowing is elevated above it, it should be incised in its lowest part so that the pus flows downward; for the pus, when confined in a deep cavity, prevents the flesh from growing in it.
If you cannot incise the cavity downwards as desired, then place a member there from which pus can easily flow out; arrange it in such a way that no pus remains blocked within it.
And as for the ointments that are applied to the cavity from the outside and how they are placed on it, it is done by taking one of the suitable ointments that you need and spreading it over a piece of linen cloth; let the cloth be enough to cover the entire cavity. Then, with the scissors, you cut near the mouth of the cavity a hole slightly wider than the mouth of the cavity. Next, apply some soft ointment on another piece of linen cloth in proportion to the hole and place it over it, spaced away from the mouth of the cavity so that the pus can easily flow out; do not remove the large cloth until later.
For several days, and as for the cloth on the mouth of the cavity, it is the one that you remove at every moment so that what accumulates in it from pus flows out; and to know what flows out of it: whether it is much or little, thin or not thin.
And with this, also examine the location of the ulcer itself; does its owner feel pain in it or not, and is there a worm in it or not? If your treatment goes astray in this manner and you see the discharge that comes out flowing from the mouth of the ulcer.
Know that the ulcer has adhered or is close to adhering, so at that time peel it off on the next day or the third day. When the wound opens up, replace the dressing with another and renew the poultice. If a thin piece comes out of the ulcer after a long period, do not despair of its healing.
The healing is near, for there are people whose flesh heals slowly in their wounds and others quickly. If a non-nourishing fluid comes out of the ulcer after many days, know that the ulcer has not adhered, as the ulcer's adherence may be delayed.
And if the treatment is prolonged, increase the drying of the medicines, so that they are moist in their composition and dry in their strength, like a date poultice; if it has been increased with an addition of galingale. The highest degree of treatment with this is to use a date poultice.
He will anoint with rose oil and sprinkle over it old wine that is moderately strong in its firmness, then he will bake it with it and use it. And if honey from palm trees is not available to you, then do as follows: If you cook it until it thickens and use it, or take from myrtle, spikenard, and cinnamon, crush all of them and leave them on the honey while it is over the fire. Then pour it onto a cloth and compress it on the ulcer, or pour with the honey that you have cooked until it becomes thick, place the cloth over it and compress it.
He may also use long strips of linen, the root of the Sousenjo (a type of willow), barley flour, and the cucumber peel, either used individually or all crushed together, sifted, and left on the honey that was described, and then used. If the ulcer persists and does not heal with this treatment, know that there is corruption within it.
If it affects the bones or any other hard tissues or ligaments, then treat it with the Nasoor treatment as described before.
Chapter Ninety-Eight
In the treatment of cysts, nails, and the removal of supernumerary fingers, and the division of adhesions between the fingers.
The cyst is a mass of flesh that grows under the nails of the hand or foot, and sometimes in other fingers. If its condition is neglected and left untreated, it becomes inflamed and causes intense pain.
Or it may become corrupt and ulcerate to the point of eating away at the root of the nail, and sometimes it corrupts the entire finger. If the corruption reaches the bone, it will have a foul odor, and the tip of the finger will swell and turn black. So if you treat it as mentioned in the section on incision and it does not heal from your treatment.
Then you should cut with iron all the growth that has grown from the nail, and afterwards cauterize the wound, for cautery in this case is very beneficial. But if the bone and the nail are sound.
And the nail's edge has retracted, drawing the flesh inward and causing it to become concave. Then you must place a thin blade under the nail that is retracting the flesh and raise it up, and cut off that flesh with scissors.
"And place on the remaining flesh from the burnt medicines until it all disappears, then treat it with medicated ointments until it heals. But if the corruption has reached the bone, that bone must be cut out and removed, for it will not heal as long as there is a corrupt bone.
"If you see the decay spreading in the finger, cut it off at one of the joints, as previously mentioned, then treat it until it heals. If the nail is struck or bruised and causes severe pain, the patient should be bled first.
"Then make a deep, oblique cut in the nail from top to bottom, taking care not to reach the flesh under the nail, as this will cause the patient severe pain and may lead to excessive tissue growth. Then treat the area with a suitable ointment for healing.
"As for the extra fingers that some people are born with, sometimes they are entirely fleshy, and sometimes there are bones in them, or even nails. Some of these grow from the base where other fingers join.
And its root is in some of the fingertips, and those that grow in some of the fingertips do not move, and those that grow near the joint of the finger may move. Therefore, it is easy to cut what comes from the flesh alone, and this is because you can cut it at its base with a wide blade.
As for those whose root is at the base of the joint, their treatment is difficult because they grow from cutting them. As for those that grow in the finger near one of the fingertips, it is necessary to cut its flesh first with a circular cut towards the bone, then saw the bone with one of those suitable saws for that.
Then treat it until it heals, and as for the adhesion that affects some of the fingers with each other, this often happens and is one of the things humans are born with. It occurs when a wound or burn from fire, etc., unites. Therefore, it is necessary to cut this adhesion.
So that the fingers return to their natural state, then place between them a lint or oiled silk soaked in rose oil, so that they do not quickly adhere together and separate them; or make a thin lead sheet between them until the site heals as it should be.
And likewise, if there is adhesion of some fingers to the palm, that adhesion should be cut according to what seems suitable and corrects the shape of the limb.
Chapter Ninety.
On Cutting for Fistulas.
Fistulas are tubular blood vessels filled with black, putrid matter that occur in most parts of the body, but they are most common in the legs, especially in the feet and calves, and particularly among porters and those who walk a lot. Therefore, it is advisable to first use bleeding from the black vein several times strongly.
Then the owner of the fistula should use a salve, and as for treating it with iron, there are two types: one is to cut and let out the black blood, and the other is to cauterize the vessel and let it out whole. As for cutting it, it should be done in this manner: first, bathe the leg thoroughly with hot water.
until the thick blood thins, then tie a ligature around the leg of the patient from above the groin to below the ankle and cut the vessel in one place or two places or three wide cuts.
Then you should let the black blood flow from your hand downward and upward until it flows out as much as you see fit or what the patient’s strength can endure. Then bind it up and instruct the patient to avoid foods that increase black bile, and repeat the purging and use of salve.
When the veins are full and this harms the patient, and as for its remedy, it should be like this: Shave the patient's leg if it has a lot of hair, then he enters the bath and rinses his leg with hot water until it reddens and the sweat flows or exercises vigorously.
If a bath is not available to warm the limb, then the skin should be incised along the vein, making an incision either at its end near the ankle or below it near the heel. Then, the skin should be opened with scissors and the vein cut from all sides until the touch becomes apparent.
And when it appears, you see it dark red like blood. When it is separated from the skin, you also see it as if it were a rope. Then insert a probe under it until when it rises and comes out of the skin, tie it with a black, soft ligature, then make another incision near that incision to the length of three fingers.
Then, cut the skin over the vein until it appears. Then raise it with a probe as you did before and tie it with another ligature as you did first. Then make another incision or several incisions if necessary.
Then tighten and cut it at the end of the cavity near the bone, then pull it out and tighten it until it exits from the second cavity, then pull it to the cavity above it, and do that until you pull it out from the third cavity, highest of all cavities. Once it is all pulled out, cut it off.
If pulling and tightening is not possible, insert a strong double threaded needle with a cord, tie it and pull it out, and place the marble under it and twist your hand in all directions until it exits. Be careful not to break it, for if it breaks, it will be very difficult to tighten.
It will cause the patient trouble if you tighten all of it. So place wet cotton on the wound site soaked in water, oil, and rose oil or olive oil, and treat him until he recovers. If the suture is twisted with turns, its direction changes to various directions.
If it is not straight as mentioned, you should cut along each turn and twisting point, then hang it with hooks until you pull all of them together, being careful when cutting not to cut the nerve or injure it, for that will make pulling difficult and preserve your effort.

Image of the blind needle maker.
It should not be sharp like the other needles, nor should its tip be too hard, so as not to cut the vein and it should have a thick, smooth body because if it is thin, it cuts the vein with its sharpness, but it should have an extra thickness as we mentioned.
Chapter One and Ninety.
On the incision of the vein in the neck.
This vein originates in the legs in hot countries like Hijaz and Arab lands, as well as in sparsely wooded hot regions. Sometimes it may also appear in other parts of the body besides the legs, and it is produced by a swelling that occurs under the skin.
As occurs in the bodies of living animals and bees, such as the caterpillar and the worm that develops between the skin and flesh. The sign that this vein is beginning to form is a severe burning sensation in the leg, then the area swells, and then the vein begins to emerge from the site of that swelling.
It is like the root of a plant or an animal, so when it appears from its end, it should be wrapped with a small piece of lead weighing between one kilogram and two dirhams, and it should be bandaged, leaving the lead hanging from the leg.
When something comes out of it to the outside, wrap it in lead and secure it. If it becomes too long, cut part of it off and wrap the rest. Do not cut it from its root before all of it comes out, for if you cut it while it is still attached, it will shrink and enter into the flesh, causing a bad wound and a foul smell in the place, and a poor scar.
Therefore, it should be cauterized and burnt little by little until it comes out completely, leaving nothing in the body. From this vein, a liquid may come out in some people that is five or ten cubits long.
And I have been told that it came out for a man twenty cubits long. If it breaks off while you are treating him, then insert a reed into its hole and bind it with a long bandage together with the body until all its substance is emptied and try to heal the place with drugs every day.
Then treat it with the treatment of ulcers, and this vein may have many branches, especially if it appears in the armpit or in the hand itself. It causes many mouths for it and a branch comes out from each mouth. Treat it as mentioned in the division and what precedes.
Chapter 29
In the case of a newborn with a cleft lip, which is known as 'ox lip'.
This disease is called in some of our countries 'ox lip' because it often afflicts cattle. It is a small, single newborn that emerges between the skin and the flesh, penetrating the entire body, both ascending and descending.
It is evident to the touch as it moves from limb to limb until it bursts through wherever it has penetrated the skin, forming a swelling in some places, similar to what afflicts newborns and snakes, or scorpion stings in the abdomen.
The harm from it is only expected if it penetrates the body, reaches the head, and touches the eye, possibly opening in it and exiting, which would then blind the eye; this occurs frequently. If you wish to treat it and remove it, this can only be done when it moves and becomes apparent to the touch.
It is necessary to tie a strong ligature above and below it, then cut into it and remove it. If it has penetrated the flesh and cannot be found, apply a hot iron to the spot until it burns it out. The greatest danger of its corruption is for the eye, as we have said.
"If you see it has become on the head near the eye, tighten under it on the forehead strongly, then cut it out and remove it. The patient should agree to cleanse his body with easy-to-mix drugs that repel foul odors and avoid foods that cause decay.
"Chapter 39.
"In cutting into the disease known as elephantiasis.
"This disease, which is called elephantiasis in our country, is a pain that appears in some limbs and then spreads from limb to limb, as I have described for you.
"I was called to a sick woman in some villages and uncovered her arm, and I found swelling running through the vein of the arm. After an hour, I saw that swelling moving with the blood like a maggot ascending to its head as fast as quicksilver.
"If it moves from place to place, the pain leaves that place and settles in the head. Then I waited an hour, and it spread throughout her body until it reached the other arm. Then she told me that her entire body was turning as I saw.
I was amazed at the speed of its transfer from limb to limb, and I had not seen this disease with my own eyes in this way before, except that I had seen a group experiencing pain moving from limb to limb, but I did not see it as I saw it in this woman.
And I could not estimate that except for the fact that the woman was from the countryside, with a dry body and exposed veins; so from here appeared to the sensation this moving wind, and it must not appear on this scale in the city dwellers and those with moist bodies and hidden veins.
So if you want to treat it and the person feels pain, then if it appears clearly as we mentioned, tighten above and below it with a wheel and cut into it until that trapped wind comes out and heal the place.
But if you do not see it clearly, then treat it with a body purge and things that expel winds and disperse them, such as henbane and hemlock, and similar drugs.
Chapter Four Hundred and Nineteen
On the Extraction of Arrows
Arrows may differ according to their types and the locations they strike in the body. As for their differences by type, some are large and others small; some have hollow glass tips and others solid glass tips; some have three barbs and others four.
And some have tongues, and some have thorns. As for those that are according to the members that are in them, they will be on two types: either the members are from hollow members, such as the brain, the heart, the liver, the bladder, the kidneys, the spleen, the intestines, and the like. If a arrow strikes one of these members and the signs of death that I will describe to you appear, it is best not to remove the arrow from it, for death will overtake its bearer in most cases. If these bad signs do not appear and the arrow is not hidden in the depth of the member, remove it and treat the wound. As for the signs of the brain: if a arrow strikes it, penetrates the bone, and wounds the membrane on the brain, it will cause severe headache and dizziness.
If these bad signs do not appear and the arrow is not hidden in the depth of the member, remove it and treat the wound. As for the signs of the brain: if a arrow strikes it, penetrates the bone, and wounds the membrane on the brain, it will cause severe headache and dizziness. And redness in the eyes, and redness of the tongue, and stupor, and confusion of the mind, and vomiting once, and sometimes blood comes out from the nostrils or ears, and sometimes speech is cut off, and the voice disappears, and a white, viscous liquid like curdled milk comes out from the site of the wound.
When you see these signs, refrain from treating the patient and extracting the arrow if it has not been removed yet. As for the signs of the arrow: if the heart is pierced and it is near the left breast, and it feels as if it has hit something solid, not empty space.
Sometimes the arrow has a movement resembling that of the pulse, and blood flows from the wound, black in color, followed by coldness in the limbs, cold sweat, and faintness. Know then that death is imminent and inevitable. If the arrow wounds the head, the wound will exude foamy blood.
The earlobes become purple, the patient's complexion changes, and they take deep breaths, seeking cold air. If the arrow has penetrated the diaphragm in the chest, it will be near the small ribs, and breathing will be labored with severe pain.
The patient will be restless, and all the extremities will move. If the arrow has struck the liver, severe pain will follow, and blood resembling the liver in its redness will flow from the wound. If the arrow has struck the intestine, it may cause undigested food to pass through the wound.
"His condition is apparent, and if the arrow penetrated his abdomen and lodged therein, and something emerged from the wound, whether it was an intestine or a part of the bladder that has ruptured, then there is no hope for his treatment or removal of the arrow. For if the arrow has entered the bladder and urine exits,...
"And if something emerges from it to the exterior, and the pain intensifies on the patient, know that he is dying. As for the rest of the limbs such as the face, eye, cheek, shoulder, arm, back of the neck, thigh, shin, and their like among the limbs, the matter is decided.
"When the arrow has not struck a vein or nerve and was not poisoned, I will inform you of some observations regarding these arrows to aid in your treatment. For example, two arrows had penetrated a man in his eye socket at the root of the nose.
"So I removed it from him through the other side, beneath the temporal bone, and he was cured with no damage to his eye. I also extracted another arrow from a Jew who had been struck in the orbital region below the lower eyebrow; the arrowhead remained embedded, and I only managed to pull out its small wooden tip.
The arrow was a large one from the composite arrows, with a square iron head and no feathers. The Jew survived unharmed, and I extracted another arrow from a Christian's ring finger, which was a barbed arrow.
The one with feathers had entered between the ribs, and it was stuck in his ring finger, so I handled it carefully until I removed it, and the Christian survived unharmed. Then I extracted another arrow from a man who had fallen on it in his abdomen; we judged that he would die from it.
When after about thirty days nothing in his condition had changed, I cut into the arrow and rotated it and extracted it, and he was unharmed; no harm came to him from it. I saw a man who had fallen on an arrow in his back, and the wound closed up on its own.
When after seven years the arrow came out at the root of his thigh, I saw a woman who had fallen on an arrow in her abdomen; the wound healed and the arrow remained, but nothing changed in her condition, nor did she find it harmful to any of her natural functions.
I saw another man with an arrow in his face, and the wound healed, but he still found it very painful, and many similar cases are found. And I removed an arrow from a soldier of the Sultan who had fallen into the middle of his nose, having turned slightly towards the right side.
The arrow disappeared completely, and I was called to treat him three days after the arrow fell out. I found the wound very narrow, so I examined it with a thin probe but did not feel it. He felt numbness and pain under his right ear due to the piercing.
I feared that this numbness was due to the arrow, so I applied a plaster with an adhesive force on the spot and waited for it to heal, hoping that the sign of the arrow would appear. When I cut into it, nothing happened in the spot indicating that the arrow had reached there.
I kept the plaster on him for many days, but nothing happened. Then I closed the wound and the patient was unable to remove it until one day he felt the arrow inside his nose and informed me of this. So I put a caustic medicine on the wound for many days.
Until he opened and probed it, and then I felt the tip of a thin arrow that was stuck in the bone. So, I continued to widen the wound with this sharp medicine until the tip of the arrow appeared to us clearly, and it stayed with me for about four months.
Then, when the wound widened and I was able to insert a clamp into it, I pulled on it and moved it, but it did not respond by coming out. So, I continued to touch it and maneuver around it with various instruments until one day I grasped it firmly with a clamp just as its shape is depicted at the end of this chapter.
And the doctors judged that his nostrils could not be closed, so I closed them and dressed the wound, and the patient was cured completely without any pain remaining. And I am informing you about how to extract some arrows as a measure and example for what I have not mentioned.
Because the parts of this art and their details cannot be grasped by description, nor can a book encompass them. Rather, the skilled craftsman measures the little with the much, what is present with what is absent, and invents new actions and new instruments in response to unusual circumstances.
If it falls from this craft, I say that the arrows only exit from the members in which they were planted, either by drawing them out from the place they entered or by pushing them out from the other end where they entered.
Alternatively, if the arrow is in a place of fleshy tissue, it should be drawn out, but if it does not easily come out at the time it fell, it is necessary for you to leave it there for several days until the flesh around it becomes rotten and soft, so that it can be easily drawn out and removed. The same applies if it is planted in bone.
And if it does not come out, leave it for several days and try drawing and moving it every day, as it will come out. If after several days it still does not come out, then it is necessary to drill around the arrow in the same bone from all sides with a fine drill until there is enough space for the arrow, then draw it out and remove it.
And if the arrow is planted in the bone of the head and has reached one of the cavities of the brain, and some of those symptoms that I mentioned to you appear on the patient, then desist from drawing out the arrow and leave it until the condition improves after several days.
And if the arrow is deeply embedded and difficult to extract, use forceps around the arrow as I have described to you, then treat the area until it heals. But if the arrow has entered a part of the body. And if you cannot feel it, then probe with a needle. If you feel it, extract it with some of the instruments that are suitable for its extraction. But if you are unable to do so due to the narrowness of the wound and the depth of the arrow in the cavity, and there is no bone, nerve, or vessel,
then widen the wound until you can grasp the arrow and extract it. If it has barbs, free the embedded flesh around them from every side by any means possible, and if you cannot free the flesh because of breaking the bones or severing them, then mutilate them until they are freed.
And if you try to extract the arrow from any part of the body, use forceps with gentle pressure in all directions until it is freed, and be very careful not to break the arrow lest it becomes difficult for you to extract and remove it, if you cannot do so at that time.
Do not remove it for any days until the surrounding meat is rotten, then return to it because it will be easier at that time. If blood clotting obstructs you, use what we mentioned in its treatment, and preserve your effort from cutting a nerve or tendon, and use the method.
In any case, you can remove the arrow and do so with caution and firmness as described to you. When pulling out the arrow, it is necessary for you to make the patient lie in the same position he was in when the arrow fell, so it will be more successful.
If you cannot do that, use what is possible for you of the forms. As for the arrow that comes out from the opposite side, it may have exited something on the outside or you may feel the end of the arrow near the skin's surface and see it protruding.
Then cut a little around it, enough for the forceps to fit, then pull it out, as it will be easier to remove. If it sticks in the bone, place your hand on turning it until the arrow makes an impression on the bone and expands by itself, then pull it out.
If not, leave it for the days required until it comes out. If there is a shaft in it, push it with it. If the shaft has fallen and you intend to use the pushing tool, insert the hollow instrument into it so that its cavity enters the tip of the arrow, then push it with it.
If the arrow is hollow, push it with an instrument that enters into that cavity, for the arrow will then easily exit. If the arrow is poisoned, it is necessary to cut out all the flesh in which the poison has spread, if possible, and then treat it with what is suitable for that.
If the arrow is in the chest, or in the abdomen, or in the bladder, or in the side, and it is near what can be felt by the finger, and you are able to cut on it, then cut and take care not to cut a nerve or sinew, and remove it.
Then suture the wound if it requires stitching, and treat it until it heals. Image of the forceps used to extract arrows:
Its ends are like the claws of a bird, made so that they close tightly around the arrow or whatever is not let go, and they can be made in large, small, and medium sizes according to the size and narrowness of the arrow and wound.
Image of the hollow fistula
Image of the dry fistula
This is a dry extremity like a rod, making it easy to insert into the hollow needle and push it through.
Chapter Fifty-Nine
In tying off blood vessels
The blood vessels that are commonly tied off in the body are thirty, including sixteen blood vessels in the head: two pulsating blood vessels known as the carotid arteries, and two blood vessels in the parotid glands; and two blood vessels in the sockets of the eyes known as the optic nerves.
The blood vessel that is in the middle of the forehead, and the one at the edge of the nose, and the two jugular veins in the neck, and the two blood vessels on the upper lip of the mouth, and the two on the lower lip; these are known as the arteries, and the two blood vessels under the tongue.
As for the blood vessels tied off in the arm and hand, they are five: one of them is the cephalic vein, which is from the outer side, and the common people call it the head vein; and the basilica vein, which is the middle blood vessel, composed of a branch of the cephalic vein and a branch of the basilica vein, and the common people call it the body blood vessel.
The basilic and it is the topic in the left side, and it is also called the abdomen artery, and the common people call it the belly vein and the arm ligament, and it is the topic on the Zonad and that which adheres to it, and it is that which appears above the groin clearly visible.
It is the vein between the ankle and the foot, which has two branches; in the leg and the foot there are three veins: one of them is under the ankle bone on the outer side, the second is the saphenous vein, and its place is at the heel on the inner side, and the third vein is on the little toe on the outer side.
There are also three similar veins in the other leg. As for the two veins behind the ears, it is beneficial to tie them off for continuous nosebleeds, and throat inflammation, and the continuous head wound. The method of tying them off will be as I have described.
The method is to shave the head of the patient and to tie a coarse thread tightly around his nape, in the place of the two veins. Then the patient should be choked with a cloth until the two veins appear behind the ears, in the two lower places of the head. You should feel for their pulse under your finger; where you feel it pulsing is where you should tie them off.
Then take a scalpel called nashl, insert it under the skin until it reaches the bone, then lift the flesh and skin with your hand, cut the flesh with the skin in one piece, and its length will be two hands' breadths.
Or like this, and send from the blood the amount you want, then squeeze them with bandages and leave them until they heal. In the beginning of the book their cutting and cauterization were mentioned, as for the two veins in the cheeks, it is beneficial to cauterize them for chronic conjunctivitis, severe headaches, persistent drowsiness and harsh cataracts afflicting the eyes.
And how to cauterize them: Make the patient sit with a turban around his neck until the veins appear clearly and you can feel their pulsation under your finger, then learn the location by touch. Then raise the skin above the vein with your thumb.
Insert the nashl scalpel from below, raise the vein and cauterize it as you did with the other two veins. Send from the blood the amount needed, then bind the patient's neck and place your finger on the vein for an hour.
Then place a cotton pad and bandage on it, and bind it tightly from above with a tight bandage, leaving it until it heals. The description of both was mentioned earlier in the beginning of the book, along with their cutting and suturing. As for the cauterization of the temporal artery, its benefit is after the cauterization of the carotid artery to treat long-standing facial conditions such as alopecia, ulcers, and severe inflammation.
And the way to cauterize it, as I have explained to you, is to strangle the patient's neck with a turban until the artery appears. Then take the instrument called the lancet, and this is its shape:
Place the natural hook at the end of the lancet on the same artery and strike it from above with a hammer or something similar. Let the blood flow to the desired extent, then loosen the patient's strangulation and bind it until he recovers.
It may be opened with a wide incision, but it should not have sharp edges like the other incisions. Instead, it should have slightly blunt edges and be cauterized to prevent injury, as the bone is nearby, which might cause a fragile instrument to break if it is thin.
As for the two arteries in the temples, their benefit is for eye diseases such as trachoma, redness, and blindness, as well as facial conditions. The way to cauterize them is for the patient to strangle his neck with a turban, then cauterize while standing over his head. Let the cauterization be slight and shallow with a small, slightly wide incision.
In this place there is no flesh, so if the wounded person has thin edges, they may break. Then send from blood what you need and put a cotton on them, and tighten them for one night, then uncover them. As for the nosebleed, it is beneficial to use hot water.
And severe headache, among the diseases of the face such as red swelling that appears in the nose, especially if it is persistent, and the way to stop it is for the patient to tighten his neck, then hold his nose with your left hand and take a thin, long cut.
And pierce it in the middle of the bridge of the nose itself, between the sides of the nose, vertically, because the blood does not appear there due to sensation, but the blood emerges from its root. It is appropriate that your hand should accompany the cut a little and send what you need of the blood, then tie it for the night, for it heals quickly.
As for bloodletting, it is beneficial for constricted breath, the onset of hemorrhoids and black diseases that appear on the skin surface such as black scabies, pustules, bad ulcers and pimples. The way to perform bloodletting is for the patient to tighten below them around his neck with a bandage, and the operator stands at the head of the patient.
The patient is seated, then the wound is opened to its full length widely a little, and bloodletting is done moderately or as needed, then the same is done with the other wound, and the bandage is removed.
The two wounds are bound moderately, lest the patient strangles, and he is left until the next day for the wound to heal. As for the jugular veins, it is beneficial to open them after opening the carotid artery because it helps with mouth ulcers, gum disease, small wounds, cheek fissures, and small wounds.
If the wounds are in the nose or around it, have the patient sit before you and bind his neck with a cloth, then turn his face and look at the two veins that you see on either side of the nose, and pierce them with their darkness.
Also, there are thin dark veins around them that you should cut into distinct pieces, for if it is difficult for you and you do not know what they are, then aim towards the larger and more prominent one, and likewise do this with the veins in the lower lip.
And as for the two tonsils under the tongue, it is beneficial to cauterize them after cauterizing the palate for tracheotomy in cases of laryngeal disease and oral diseases. The method of cauterizing them is that the patient sits between your hands with the sun hat on his head, you lift his tongue and look under the tongue from one side a tonsil and from the other side a tonsil, both are black in color.
And cauterize them, taking care not to cut them completely because underneath them are blood vessels from which blood may flow. As for the three tonsils that are cauterized in the armpit, they are those commonly cauterized among people, and their cauterization is done in two ways.
Either by puncturing with a wide-bladed lancet or incising with a scalpel, like this [illustration], which is the shape of the wide-bladed lancet.
It should be wide as you see, to be suitable for opening the prominent, visible, and rough tonsils that contain thick blood like tar. This is the shape of the olive-bladed lancet.
This is the blade, which is the narrowest and sharpest at its tip, suitable for cutting thin vessels that contain blood that is very pale yellowish, and this is an image of the blade:
This is the blade that is suitable for cutting and has various widths and sharpnesses according to the capacity and tightness of the vessels, and one can distinguish it from others; it is well known among craftsmen.
As for the basilic vein, which is one of these three vessels, it is beneficial to cut it because it draws blood from diseases that are under the armpit and neck above the chest and abdomen. It is necessary for the cutter, when cutting, to be cautious and on guard, for beneath it is an artery; if he makes a mistake and cuts into the blade's thread, he will cut that artery.
If a hemorrhage occurs, it is therefore necessary that its cutting not be done with the threaded blade but rather be cut with a single-edged knife. If the basilic vein does not appear clearly, it should be avoided and another [vein] should be chosen or some of its branches should be sought.
Or cut in its place the arm vein, for it is clear and cut it with the threaded knife as we have said. If you want to cut it alone, it is necessary before tightening the arm that you feel the place until you recognize the pulsating spot, then mark it with the scalpel.
Then connect the arm and cut the vein with an oblique incision using a cauterizing iron as we said, and beware that the blow does not fall far from the place of the arteries. And when you see, upon tightening the bandage, swelling in the place where you were taught to apply pressure, then know that this swelling is the swelling of the artery next to it.
If you see blood at the cut flowing like the urine of a young boy, and the blood is thin and red, know that it is from an artery. At this time, quickly place your finger over it for a long hour. Then remove your finger; if the bleeding stops, bandage the arm tightly.
Leave it, and warn the patient not to neglect it and let him be on guard and not move it for any days until he recovers. But if the bleeding does not stop and you are overwhelmed and no remedy is at hand in that moment, then cut the artery if it appears to you, for its ends will shrink and the bleeding will stop.
Or take the shell of a pine nut, cut it, and take half of it, and press it firmly onto the vein with a bandage and rags until another day. If the bleeding stops, otherwise treat it as previously mentioned for applying cauterizing agents to ulcers, and cutting its blood is not difficult in most cases.
For the treatment of small wounds and strengthening the ligaments in the arm, know this: The juice of the onion is beneficial for drawing blood from above the head and below the body because it is composed of a branch of basil and a branch of garlic, as we have said.
And it is necessary for the cauterizer to be on a neck of flesh, because under it there is a nerve; if he exceeds in the depth of the lesion and injures the nerve, then a greenish swelling occurs which is difficult to heal, and sometimes it does not heal at all. This nerve often appears sensitive.
If the skin is thin and barely noticeable in some people, it is necessary to make your cauterizer's edge sharp with a file and avoid the nerve with effort, for if the juice is between two nerves, then cut the length of the juice. And as for garlic juice, its benefit when cauterized is that it draws blood from the head.
And it is beneficial for diseases of the eyes, and it is necessary in this juice, especially if you wish to cauterize it, that you cauterize it with the olive lesion or with the broad lesion of rosemary because all the juices are under it without veins or nerves.
It is, however, necessary for you to avoid with the cauterizer only the head of the tendon when it is inflamed and to seek the soft place, and it will not harm him if he does not hit it in the first strike that he repeats the cautery several times except that sometimes it may be painful in some people if he does not cauterize in the first strike.
But that pain will not harm him at all, and as for the method of cauterization and its consequences and what should be done first to correct it, the first thing is that you should know that cauterization is either used only to preserve health.
And the one used in diseases and that which is used to preserve health and its maintenance and protection from disease occurrence, then the cauterization should be in one of the three veins that are in the shoulder blade, namely the cephalic, axillary, and basilic, and the cauterization should be at the beginning of spring if there are signs of illness.
The cauterization should be done on Sunday or Tuesday after three hours have passed since morning, and as for the cauterization used in diseases, it has no fixed time but rather whenever the need or necessity calls for it, whether day or night.
In every hour and in any time, and it is not appropriate for children to be circumcised until they reach fourteen years, nor should the elders who have passed sixty years be circumcised; so if anyone insists on circumcision for any reason.
It is advisable to clean his vessel before circumcision with a soft syringe if it contains abundant retained feces so that it does not adhere to the vessels during the emptying of the vessel, which could harm the main organs. Do not circumcise those who are ill, or suffering from diabetes or leprosy until these conditions leave them.
And caution is advised for circumcision after menstruation, childbirth, diarrhea, excessive intercourse, fatigue, exercise, sleep deprivation, fasting, and any bodily or mental exertion that weakens the body. Then examine the mixture beforehand if the blood is thick.
With food, drink, and medicine if possible, then he should enter the bath unless prevented by an obstacle or perform some exercise so that the blood flows and his circumcision is done in the morning as we said, and it is recommended that he avoids his chest from all evil thoughts on that day.
The humors, anger, fear, and all bodily ailments such as exhaustion, excessive fasting, sexual intercourse, and the like; and one should prepare one's surroundings with things that people commonly use for their health benefits, such as fragrances, incenses, and the like, according to each individual's ability.
Then the surgeon sits on a stool that is higher than the one on which the patient sits. He then extends his arm and the surgeon holds it with his hand two or three times, then tightens the ligature with the thread and winds it two or three times, ensuring the tension is moderate.
For if the tension is not moderate, either due to excessive tightening which prevents blood flow, or due to being too loose which also prevents blood flow; then after tying the ligature, it is necessary for the patient to grasp his hands together tightly with each other.
Until the veins swell and become visible to touch, then the surgeon should wipe the site with a little old oil, specifically; then he should place his left index finger over the same vein slightly below the intended incision site so that the vein does not slip away from the cut. The veins are like a hollow reed, and some of them are filled with air. When the cauterizing iron is applied to them, they shrink below the iron and deceive the cauterizer, and the iron does not open the vein, even if it opens it, its opening will be narrow.
Therefore, it is necessary for the cauterizer to be steadfast and patient in all these matters, then let the iron descend. If the vein opens from that pass, well; otherwise, he should repeat another pass under that place a little or above it with the awl if the place does not become necrotic.
If necrosis or the patient's fear occurs, leave him for a day or two, and do not tighten the bandage, as it may bring about hot inflammation. Do not enter the bath, then if he wishes, let the cauterizer repeat the procedure. If the iron has penetrated and the opening was small with thin flowing blood.
I feared that the amount of blood would not be what is desired, so I prepared the iron in the same hole, being steadfast and increasing the opening a little, and do this with the awl before the place becomes necrotic, for in many people, the place may become necrotic at a small opening.
If you see that it has been burned, do not apply a plaster to it, for it will not help you at all. Place on it something from the extract of olive oil, for it facilitates blood flow and is better in this situation than the oil itself and other ointments.
Use olive oil extract in all your bleeding disorders, as it facilitates blood flow and may be caused by pain or hemorrhoids. If any of these are placed on the affected area, the blood will flow freely and thin out if it is thick.
If a large clot occurs at the site of bleeding, this often happens, especially for those who have not bled before or if the wound was small. Quickly place on the clot a sponge soaked in warm water and a little salt and keep it pressed for an hour, for it will dissolve.
And it is necessary to do this after the blood has stopped flowing from the wound or from another wound, for if something black or green remains in the place after a few days, it does not harm. If you wish, place on it something made of patience and dissolved myrrh.
And something from the extract of fodanj and its kind, and often a worm appears when the pustule breaks open; so put your hand on it, and if you find it soft upon pressing, then that is a bad worm, so beware not to do anything with it from what we mentioned.
For it sometimes bleeds a lot, but compress it with what it has to stiffen the place, then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals. It is necessary for every person to have their blood let out according to their strength and what appears as the dominant color in the blood.
So if the blood is black, let it bleed until it turns red; and likewise, if you see it thick, send it out until it thins; and likewise, if it is hot, until its heat subsides. And for those who are strongly filled and need to have blood let out in one go.
To widen the incision of the vein and make the cut wide, but for those who are weak, the opposite is true; it should be released in several sessions and the hole should be narrow. The best tool to use for incising the vein is a sharp, cylindrical lancet without a notch.
"This cut is safe from infection and from nerve damage, and it is Ahmad who performed it and healed from the incision in width and length. If one is accustomed to getting infected after an incision, it is necessary to feed him before the incision something of soaked bread in pomegranate juice or carob.
"If he is emaciated and his blood has been let out three or four times, if his temperament is cold, then before the incision he should take soaked bread in rose water or honey drink flavored with sage, or in good-smelling aromatic drink.
"If infection occurs after the incision and its cause is excessive bleeding, it is necessary to drink meat broth and thin aromatic drink, and to apply honey ointment on the wound, and to use what we mentioned in the division section regarding infection.
"As for what comes from bleeding, and as for one who wants to relax his arm and stop the bleeding a second time, it is necessary that if his incision has drained a lot and his strength is weak, he should let out a little blood at a time according to his strength over consecutive days.
And as for those who wish to ease their arm and release the second blood flow, if their body is strong, they should do so seven or nine hours after the first bleeding. As for those who want to draw blood from their body towards the opposite direction of the first bleeding, it is appropriate that this be done on the second or third day.
And as for those who have much blood in their body, which is hot and dry, causing fever, it is appropriate to release the blood from them all at once, in a large quantity, and to widen the incision so that the vein becomes visible, after ensuring that all the conditions of bleeding are met. And to place your hand on his pulse during the bloodletting, so that death does not occur at the site of the incision. This often happens if the person performing the bleeding is unskilled and makes a mistake. It should not be done if you intend to release the arm and the second flow of blood.
If the vein's mouth has closed and the blood exits with difficulty, do not squeeze or pull it hard, for that is very harmful. Instead, either leave it until a second bleeding or use the cautery blade to clear the clotted blood from the vein's mouth.
And put on it something from salt dissolved in water or put on it something from the farouk balsam or shakhzaniya and prick it with a fine needle until the blood comes out, then if the vein has burst leave it.
Do not touch it until the worm settles, and if necessity demands a second bloodletting and there is no choice but to do so, either treat it above that spot or in the other arm or vein.
And as for bleeding the arm vein, it is treated instead with alkohl and basilicum if they are not available or are scarce because it is composed of them. The method of treating it is that the patient places his hand in hot water until the flesh turns red and the vein appears clearly; then a light to moderate pressure is applied above it with a bandage.
Then the vein is bled by making a small incision, neither too short nor too long, and it should be wide. The bleeding site should be located slightly above the wrist. If the blood does not come out, place the hand back in the container with hot water and let the blood flow into the water.
Until your need is met, if it's during the summer, you may not need to repeat washing your hand in hot water, as this can cause excessive bleeding in hot water during winter. This vein has surrendered more than any other vein. For under it there is neither a striking vein nor a nerve, whereas the cutting of the cephalic vein from the right hand is beneficial for liver diseases. Its method of cutting is that you tighten the cephalic vein with a ligature or your fingers after inserting it into hot water until the vein swells.
For under it there is neither a striking vein nor a nerve, whereas the cutting of the cephalic vein from the right hand is beneficial for liver diseases. Its method of cutting is that you tighten the cephalic vein with a ligature or your fingers after inserting it into hot water until the vein swells. It becomes clear to the touch, then cut it slightly on a curve. If you cut it completely, it will not harm it at all. Be careful not to press your hand with the scissors, as under it are the nerves of the fingers and the place is rich in flesh. Then return the hand to the hot water.
Leave it to bleed, for if you do not place it in hot water, the blood will clot at the mouth of the vein and prevent bleeding. If you have extracted enough blood, place on the vein oil and salt so that it does not heal quickly.
And so it is necessary to do the same with every narrow branch. As for the benefit of cutting from the left hand, it is beneficial for liver diseases. Do the same in its cutting as you did in the second one, either way. As for the cutting of the basilic vein, its benefit is for the diseases that are below the body, such as pelvic diseases.
"Retention of urine, kidney diseases, and wounds of the thighs and calves, along with similar ailments, can be treated by immersing the foot in hot water and applying the bladder to it until the veins become relaxed. Then, tighten above the ankle joint with a bandage and let the vein remain in its place near the heel, visible towards the ankle.
"If it bursts in the foot, let it burst into the largest vein, or near the heel at its meeting point, which is better and safer. If it has burst in the face of the foot, protect from the nerves beneath it on the face of the foot.
"Make your cut as if you intend to pierce it, and the wound will be healed. If the blood is difficult to flow, let him place his foot in hot water and leave the blood flowing until it is emptied, for the inciser might have erred in the first cutting of the vein.
"Let him cut again a little higher, for the place is safe and does not fear inflammation if protected from the nerve as we have said. And do the same with the saphenous vein of the other foot, in the same manner. As for the woman's vein, its location is as we have said on the outer side of the ankle.
The benefit of cauterizing for pain from the ankle, if that is from hot blood, and the method of cauterization so that the patient enters the bath quickly and hurries to elevate his leg from the ankle above the heel by four fingers with a thin, long bandage, for it only appears this way.
If it appears, cauterize it in any state, whether by distortion (which is best) or by perforating it with a needle or cutting it open. For if its place is safe, which is the case for most people, you may not find it.
If you do not find the pulsation, then cauterize some of its branches, which are those that appear on the back of the foot near the heel and ankle, and they protect against nerves and control the amount of blood flow you desire.
Then remove the bandage and place cotton on the cauterization site, and bind it firmly, for it will quickly heal.
Chapter Sixty-Nine
On Phlebotomy and its Use.
The cupping glass can be made of horn, wood, copper or glass. There are two types of cupping: one with a valve and the other without a valve.
These sutures without conditions are on two faces.
And the cauteries of the axillae, which are both sides of the neck together, and the cautery of the jaw, which is below the lower jaw from the mouth, and the cauteries of the shoulders, and the cauteries on the bend of the nose, and the cauteries of the elbows, which are in the middle of the arms, and the cauteries of the calves.
Suturing draws blood only from the thin membranes that are spread in the flesh, and for this reason it does not cause weakness or the drop of bile. It is not appropriate to use sutures with fire or without fire in any of the diseases that result from fullness until the whole body is emptied.
Therefore, if the need for suturing comes from a disease or according to habit, we use it at any time in the beginning of the month, in the middle, and at the end, or at any time.
This is because some people, if their blood increases to the point of needing to be drawn out by a cupping glass, will find in their head heaviness and dizziness; some will find fullness and redness in their face, head, and neck; some will find spots on their face and cheeks and darkness and redness in their eyes; and some will feel the place of their cupping.
And some of them will have increased laughter, and some will taste blood in their mouth, feel nauseous, and vomit blood; and some will have increased sleep, and some will see in their sleep blood, redness, killings, wounds, and things like that. We have seen these things at times.
And specifically, if it is in the middle third of the month, we order at that time a cupping by an incision after two or three hours of the day have passed; as for the benefit of the cupping incision, it benefits from heaviness in the head and water that is discharged to the eyes.
But it is necessary for that to be done after the body has been emptied; this cupping may serve as a substitute for bleeding with leeches, and one should beware of using it for someone who has a cold brain or epilepsy, as it will cause him great harm.
"Therefore, it is not appropriate for the elderly and those with cold disorders to use it, as well as those who are addicted to it, for it causes forgetfulness.
"Therefore, it is advisable that the phlebotomist should lower his hand with the lancet slightly downward out of fear of causing forgetfulness. As for bleeding the head, it is a remedy against stiffness in the neck and stiffness in the shoulders.
"It is beneficial for shortness of breath, tightness in the chest, coughing, and congestion. The bleeding from the head should be raised slightly because if it is directed downward, it causes weakness in the heart and stomach.
"As for bleeding the temples, it is beneficial for headaches, vertigo, toothache, and gum pain; it is a remedy against stiffness in the neck. It is advisable to instruct the phlebotomist not to deeply insert the lancet with the ligature so as not to cut a blood vessel and cause bleeding.
"As for bleeding below the tongue, it is beneficial for mouth ulcers and tooth decay, as well as similar diseases of the mouth. It can also serve in place of bleeding the soft palate on both sides of the throat. As for bleeding from the armpits, it is effective against heat and congestion that results from excess mucus.
The cupping of the abdomen of the weak is beneficial for what benefits the cutting of the three main veins: the vena cava, the mesenteric artery, and the jugular vein, because it draws blood from all those delicate vessels in the flesh and draws those delicate vessels from other vessels more robust until the drawing reaches the three robust vessels.
It is advisable to order the cupper not to press on the stomach because the place is covered with flesh and underneath are nerves and blood vessels. As for the single cupping that cups the navel, it is beneficial for problems of the bladder and wounds in the lower abdomen.
It is advisable to order the cupper that the cup be large and made of copper, because the place needs a strong suction, and perhaps a glass cup may break and require frequent replacement. As for the cups on the legs, they should have moderate suction.
Because it draws blood from all over the body and is beneficial for chronic pains in the kidneys, liver, bladder, and uterus; it expels black bile and is beneficial for hemorrhoids and varicose veins, occupying the position of cutting the saphenous and femoral veins. However, it heavily weakens the body and causes shock in most people. The benefit of cupping the popliteal fossa is close to that of cupping the calves.
How to insert the cautery: First, place the cauterizer empty and compress it moderately without extending its placement, but remove it quickly so that the mixtures flow into the area equally, and continue doing this until you see the area turn red and open.
When the redness of blood appears, then cut and repeat pressing gently until you look at the state of the limbs; if the person has soft flesh with interwoven tendons, it is advisable to cut once only, lest the area swell.
The barber is instructed to widen the incision and deepen it slightly, and to apply moderate pressure with gentle motion. If the blood is thick, he should cut twice; in the first instance, to open a path for the thin blood and its water, and in the second, to ensure the extraction of the thick blood. ‌
If the blood is very thick, the incision should be repeated three times to reach its limit. In summary, if we want to extract a small amount of blood, one incision will suffice. However, if we wish to draw out more blood, multiple incisions are required, especially if the blood is deemed thick.
It is necessary to cut a deep incision, and the moderate limit of the incision is only the depth of the skin. What should be used when placing stents is from the adhesives, and from the water what the patient fears. As for one whose skin is thick, hard, black, and his pores are narrow.
It is necessary to anoint the sites of the stents with a soft, dissolved adhesive. If it is in the summer season, then like oil of khayra or benfisaj oil, or sweet almond oil, or oil of carob seeds.
And if it is in winter, then like oil of narcissus or oil of saffron, or oil of poppy, or oil of crocus and the like. If the preferred oil is thick and cold, let it be oil of mursanjush, or oil of nammam, or oil of ban, or oil of shabath and the like.
If the patient has wide pores and soft flesh, it is necessary to avoid oil, and these patients should have their stents washed after bleeding with rose water, or cold water, or bear grape water, or carob water, or rhubarb water and the like. And as for one whose blood is very moist.
He should wash his sores with vinegar or water of ashes and sumac, and the like thereof. But if his sores are thick, he should wash them with old wine or water of marjoram, or cooked shabth or baboung, and the like thereof. And it is necessary for the cupping to be cautious in the bath and after the bath.
Rather, it is necessary that after leaving the bath, one should wait for an hour or two, and it is not advisable to sleep after cupping. The patient should not expose himself to cold before and after cupping.
First, one should consider whether the patient or the afflicted person is a phlegmatic type, as most of them have cold and inflamed blood. In such cases, it is necessary to take cooling foods such as pomegranates, lemons with vinegar, sorrel, scorpions, and the like. His diet should include cold dishes, the meat of young animals, and pickles, and similar things.
If his temperament is cold, it is necessary to drink honey wine or meadow wine, or the seeds of scorpions. He should eat moderately fragrant wine that is between old and new, and he should be instructed to eat lightly. His diet should include cold dishes, cucumbers, partridges, and roasted pigeons. And it is necessary for the drink on the day of cupping and bloodletting to be more than the food.
It is appropriate to give some people a drink of theriac, musk medicine, or silithia before bloodletting and purging, or after it, to strengthen the main limbs and invigorate the blood, but those who have been bled should not drink it.
As for the venesection without ligature, it is that which is placed on the liver, spleen, breasts, abdomen, kidney area and groin, because these parts do not tolerate the ligature; rather, its purpose is to draw blood from one limb to another.
Placing the venesection on the breasts in cases of mastitis or to relieve a limb from a cold that has settled in it, is like placing the venesection on the abdomen and groin, for it purges the limb, warms it, and alleviates pain by releasing that cold air.
It is placed on the kidneys if a blockage or stone appears, for its strong drawing power may open the blockage or remove the stone from its place. Similarly, it acts if placed on the liver and spleen when affected by a cold wind. These venesections can be used empty with just a cautery.
It is used with fire and it is used filled with water for the diseases of the throat, and that is because the container is filled with hot water alone or with water in which some herbs suitable for this purpose have been cooked.
Then it is placed filled on the spot, held and removed, and repeated as needed. This is the image of the container used with fire:
Its capacity is two fingers wide, as shown in the picture, and its depth is half a finger, and on one side of it, halfway up, there is a small hole to accommodate the needle made from thick tin or yellow copper.
It should have a smooth, flat surface so as not to harm the limb when placed on it, and in its center there should be a perforated disk of copper or iron where the candle is placed for the fire treatment. This container can be made larger or smaller depending on the disease.
The use of containers for children and women is different from those for men and animals with thick bodies. As for how to place this container with fire on the limb, it is done by taking a wick of cotton or a small candle of wax and placing it in the center of the perforated disk in the middle of the container.
Let the fire ascend to above under the cauterizer, lest it burn the body of the patient, then place on the limb and the finger on the hole that we mentioned until when we seize the cauterizer, we do not need to remove the finger.
And the steam came out on that hole and the cauterizer was cooled, then the wool was placed on the wound and if it needed to be replaced, it was done so. As for the cauterizer used in the disease of shawshah with water, there is no solid rod or hole in it.
It is only used by filling it with water and placing it on the limb, nothing else. And this is its form:
And the larger this cauterizer is, so that it can hold more water, the better.
Chapter Seventy-Nine.
On Ligating the Artery.
The artery is used in most situations where cauterizers cannot be applied, either because the part is small like the lip and the gum or similar, or because the limb is devoid of flesh like the finger and the nose or similar.
Its use is by cutting from the artery that is in pure fresh water, free of impurities, and then leaving it for a day and night in fresh water until it becomes dry and nothing remains inside it. Then he first cleanses the body with purging or cupping, then he washes the affected limb.
Until it bleeds, then a plaster is placed on it. If the vein has burst and fallen off, and if possible, apply cupping to the area; this is most beneficial. Otherwise, wash the area with vinegar, then with plenty of water, soak it, and squeeze it. If the bleeding continues after the clot falls off, and that was profuse bleeding, let a linen cloth soak in cold water.
And place it on top until the bleeding stops. If the blood is profuse, sprinkle powdered alum or myrobalan or something similar from the astringents on it until the bleeding stops, or place peeled half of a pomegranate on the area.
And leave it until the pomegranate sticks to the area, for then the blood will stop. If another clot is needed, do not use that clot again if possible; instead, wash the area with fresh blood.
Or pierce a needle into the area until some blood comes out, then place it there; for if you feel something from the blood, it will stick to its place. If you want it to fall off, sprinkle some honey or salt or ashes on it, and it will fall onto its place.
The Third Chapter
On Algebra
This chapter also contains what is needed in the practice of medicine, which is the setting of broken and dislocated bones in the limbs.
Know, O my sons, that this chapter may be called "ignorant" by the uneducated among physicians, laymen, and those who have never touched or read from the books of the ancients.
And for this reason, this science has become obscure in our lands, and I have not yet found a good explanation of it. I have only benefited from it through my extensive reading of the books of the ancients and my persistent effort to understand them, until I extracted this knowledge from them; then I practiced it throughout my life.
And I have illustrated for you in this chapter all that my knowledge encompasses of it. And my experience has shown its efficacy after I have presented it to you, having freed it from the excess of prolixity and abbreviated it to the extreme, made it clear to the highest degree, and depicted for you in it many pictures of the tools used in it.
For this is from the increase in explanation, as I did in the previous chapters; and there is no strength except with Allah the Exalted, the Great.
Chapter One
On the treatment and amputation of bones, it is necessary to discuss them one by one before we begin to mention the broken or dislocated limbs. It is fitting that in the beginning of this chapter, we should mention some general principles and rules. First, you must understand and grasp their reality, as well as those who are eager to learn this noble craft besides yourselves.
I say, whenever a person has a fracture, dislocation, sprain, or fall, it is necessary to first attend to bleeding, discharge, or both. If something prevents this, such as weakness of strength, or if the person affected is a child or an old man, or if it is very hot or very cold weather.
Then he should restrict his diet to cold barley, bird meat, and fish, avoiding drinks, fatty meats, overeating, and any food that fills the veins with blood until the worm is safe and there is no sign of pus in the area.
At that point, the patient should return to his original diet that he was accustomed to. If the broken bone is in a joint, it is necessary for the patient to eat food that is rich, fatty, and strong, containing pairs such as wheat, rice, peas, lentils, and cattle hooves. The egg, the boiled fish and the thick drink, and similar things, for with this method, the healing of the fracture is faster and better. And know that the broken bones, if they are in strong men and elders, cannot connect and unite on their own nature ever.
The emptiness of their bones and the fragility, and what was from the bones in extreme softness like the bones of very young children. But nature grows over the broken bone from all sides something resembling wax, thick and sticking to it and hardening it until some parts cling to each other.
And it connects some parts to each other until it reaches the utmost strength and stability as it was before, so that nothing hinders its actions.
And for this reason, it is necessary that the patient's food be the nourishments that contain tenacity and softness and thickness as we said. Know that the fracture can vary according to the difference of the limbs, because a break in the shinbone is different from a break in the head bone and a break in the chest bone is different from a break in the back bone.
And so it is with the rest of the members, each conflicting with one another, and we will mention every type of fracture in detail within its own section, and the type of bone fracture may also vary within itself.
For it may be a simple fracture, without any splinters, or it may be along the length of the bone and have splinters, both free and non-free, and the fracture may occur with a wound or tear in the skin, and the fracture may be a comminuted one that shifts.
And each type of fracture has a specific method for its reduction, as will be mentioned later in detail within its own section. What is known as bone fracture includes swelling, warmth, tenderness to touch, and crackling when pressed with the hand.
When there is no apparent swelling, crackling, or tenderness when touching the bone and the patient does not feel much pain, it may be that there is no fracture but rather a sprain or a small break, so do not move it with continuous pressing and rubbing.
Instead, apply to it some of the medicines that will be mentioned later when appropriate for the place. Then bind it with a gentle bandage. Know that if the bone is crushed and split into two pieces without splinters, it means every part has separated from its original position.
It is necessary for you to hasten from your place to him and set his fracture before it becomes inflamed. If it becomes inflamed, leave it alone for several days until the inflammation subsides, then set it in any way you can manage with gentleness and skill.
Know that setting and aligning it is easier than in a bone where a splinter has formed, and then it becomes swollen on what will be mentioned afterwards. If the bone has splinters, it is necessary to extend the broken limb from both sides, whether hand or foot.
Whether by your hand if the limb is small, or by two cords, or with a cord and your hand, and let your positioning of the limb be level on its natural shape until when you have extended the broken bone segment, then at that moment return those excesses to their places in any way you can manage with skill and gentleness.
Strive with your effort that you do not cause the patient pain or inflammation due to your action, and strive to join one bone with its mate in the best condition. At this time, it is appropriate to touch them both and feel them with your hand; if you see anything contrary, correct it and align it according to your ability.
And beware of the sharp pinch and the strong squeeze, as many fools do, and they often claim that this is the cause of a burning pain or tingling sensation in the limb, as I have observed from their actions repeatedly.
Then, after alignment and mastery and tightening that limb, leave it at rest and caution the patient not to move it during his waking hours or sleep, nor when turning over or changing position, or during any of his movements; so that the limb's position may be one in which he feels comfortable.
And that is because if he feels pain or discomfort in the limb's position, he should move it to another position where he does not feel pain and prefers, provided that his position remains level and straight.
So that the limb does not become swollen if it becomes inflamed, and as for how to splint a broken limb, I will describe it to you as follows: know that broken bones vary in their smallness and largeness and their types, so what is small like the arm, finger, and jaw, and so on.
Therefore, for small bones it is necessary that the splints be thin and fit well, and what is large like the thigh, back, and chest, it is necessary that the splints be wide because the broad bandage grips the large bone firmly from all sides, with equal pressure, without leaving any gap. ‌
Then, after you have finished aligning, begin by applying the appropriate coating. In a gentle traction on the fracture site, then begin wrapping the bandage over the same fracture site three or four times, depending on what the limb requires, and slightly tighten your hand with the bandage, then bring it up to the upper side of the fracture site.
Slightly less tight than you would for the fracture site, then pull away slightly with the wrap from the fracture site and gradually release some of the tension until it takes something appropriate from the correct position, then take another bandage and also wrap it over the fracture site.
Then wrap the bandage to the lower side of the fracture and your action in tightening the bandage and its tension should be as we mentioned in wrapping the first upper bandage, then place between the bandages from the gentle traction or wool what matches the thickness of the fracture.
If there is swelling, do not place anything in it; then wrap another bandage over it and adjust the firm splints from your arm onto these wraps, unless the limb has a splint or hot iron.
And if it contains a blow or a hot burn, place on it what will kill that wound and take away the swelling, and leave it for days. Then press on it with bandages at that time, and let the bandages be of half of a hollow reed prepared with wisdom, or let the bandages be of willow wood.
Which is made from sumac or palm fronds, or willow bark, or mallow and the like of that which is available thereof; and let the capacity of each bandage be according to this form and this shape specifically.
Except that the bandage which is placed on the fracture should be a little thicker and wider than the other bandages, and as for the length of the bandage, it should be made according to what suits the size of the broken limb, whether large or small. The shape of the bandage:
Then press another layer of bandages over the first ones in the same manner, and then tie it firmly from above with strong strings as we mentioned before, that is, the pressure should be greater on the site of the fracture. And each time you move away from the fracture, the pressure is less.
And it is necessary that the strings be moderate in thickness and softness, and let them be of wet cotton cloth specifically because if the strings are thick like what I have seen the ignorant people do, they make their strings from strips of torn cloth, and this is a great mistake.
The swelling with it is outside the normal and the thin threads are also not suitable because you do not achieve with its swelling what you want, and it should not be less than a finger between the knots.
And if the patient is hurt by the ends of the threads after the tightening in the correct places, then place under it some soft cotton or spread wool until nothing hurts him from that. But if there is a fracture with a wound and a tear occurs in the skin, we will mention it separately.
Know that not every fractured limb should be tightened with threads from the first day, and this is because if the limb is large, then the threads should not be placed on it except after five days or seven or more, according to your assurance against the occurrence of hot inflammation.
These are the properties of the ointments that the ancients used to treat fractures, dislocations, and sprains, a general type of ointment that holds the fracture in place and is suitable for most mixtures, especially for children and women because it is not overcome by heat or cold.
"Take the dust from the mill, which is the gate of the flour that clings to the sides of the millstone during the grinding of the mill, and knead it just as it is, except you sift it with egg whites, making its dough neither thick nor thin, then apply it.
"Another ointment that forces fractures, dislocations, and splinters to heal: take ten dirhams each of ammoniac, linden, wild cucumber, henbane, castor, and sumac; five dirhams each of marjoram and patience; twenty dirhams of alum, and twenty dirhams of Armenian or Roman clay. "Grind all the ingredients together and mix with rose water or egg whites if the patient's constitution is hot, then apply this ointment. For it has a good composition that quickly forces broken bones to heal and is suitable for most people because of its moderation.
"Another ointment that is also beneficial for fractures and dislocations: take ten dirhams each of henbane, ammoniac, and white madder; five dirhams each of marjoram and patience; six dirhams of wild cucumber; twenty dirhams of Armenian clay. Grind all the ingredients finely, sift, and knead with water or egg whites, then apply.
A bandage for displaced joints and broken bones, which reside in pain and do not heal until the bone mends and the fracture is healed; cotton wool is taken, soaked in vinegar and cooked oil, and placed on the site. This bandage has no binding strength.
But it excels in soothing burning pain and relieving specific pains. Another bandage binds the broken bone; dry, blind fig leaves and wild almond leaves are taken, crushed together while wet, forming another type of bandage. A third bandage, concise for use when a bone fracture occurs.
And if you want to remove the remaining pain, take an equal portion of chamomile, marjoram, linseed, and oat flour, grind them all together and mix with wax; if the limb is not hot, mix it with almond water or water and use it.
Another stronger bandage for removing pain, more effective than the first one, is used when a stiff pain occurs with bone fracture; take equal portions of chamomile, wheat grains, flaxseed, and linseed, and bind them wet.
"He bandages everyone and poultices with cold or warm water, or with lead, all according to the heat of the limb and its degree of inflammation. As for splints, it is not mentioned in his book that they should be placed on a broken limb when setting it.
"Except for plaster made from wax and oil, which is described as being moderate between thickness and thinness, Galen believed that when setting a broken limb, substances containing empty spaces, along with something hot like honey, sap, milk, and the like, should be applied.
"A plaster of dried grass, fenugreek, and human or bird hair, mixed with salt, is beneficial for swelling and pain. It can be used for bandaging, compressing, or poulticing. As for the amount that should remain in the bandage...
"Then it is immersed in water, and if there is no pain or grating noise, and the broken bone does not move from its place, do not immerse it for many days; but if a severe grating noise or sharp pain or swelling occurs in that place...
Bind it quickly in time and do not delay this bandage, then take a soft cloth or a wet sponge, soak it in cold water and wash the area until the pain subsides and the discomfort settles, then leave the limb to rest for an hour.
Then place on it wool soaked in vinegar and oil, or rose oil, and bind it tightly overnight until the burning pain subsides and the swelling of the limb disappears, along with its discomfort. Afterward, return it to a gentle bandage and light pressure, but not as tight as the first time.
And continue to care for it until it heals. If you see that the inflammation, redness, pain, and all symptoms have completely disappeared and you need the bandage and tightening again, repeat what you did at first. If nothing happens to the limb as mentioned above, leave it as is.
Do not bandage it until after three, four, five, or seven days, and it may be left for twenty days, all depending on the condition of the limb as we said, until the bone is healed and the flesh has nearly mended over it.
He also increased at that time in the swelling more than all your previous swelling, and he also increased in intensifying the food of the patient as previously mentioned. So if you see the place of the fracture has dried out and become too rough, know that the food is preventing it from reaching him.
Wash it with clean water every time you wrap it, and this should be done every three days. Reduce the swelling a little, for by doing this, food will reach the member, and it will heal quickly. As for what the ignorant do by forcing another fracture of the limb.
For if he was not initially forced, and then he was forced on something else, it is a mistake of their doing, and a great deception. If it were correct, the ancients would have mentioned it in their books and practiced it, but I have not seen any of them do this in such cases. And the right thing is not to practice it.
Chapter Two.
On fractures of the skull.
The types of fractures in the head are many, and their forms vary, and their causes are diverse. Some fractures occur due to a sword blow, which may either cause the entire bone to heal or extend to the membrane under the bone. Like the imprint of footsteps on wood.
Therefore, this type of fracture is called a "stamp" or "defect" depending on whether the sword cut only part of the bone and left its edge exposed without completely severing it. This type of fracture is generally referred to as an "open" fracture, and the wound from these two types of fractures can be either large or small.
And among the fractures, there is what is called "crushing" or "splintering", which occurs due to a blow with a stone or falling on a stone or similar object. This type of fracture can be either an open one that approaches the layer beneath the bone or it may occur in the bone itself.
And the wound from these two fractures can also be either large or small. Among the fractures, there is what is called a "hairline" or "invisible" fracture within the bone, which is a subtle fissure.
Therefore, this type of fracture is called a "hairline" or "invisible" fracture. Among them are fractures that occur from a fall or the impact of a stone and similar objects, where one side of the bone enters into the other, causing localized swelling as if copper were struck and part of it entered inside.
In the head, this is most common in the soft bone of the cranium, similar to the fontanelles of infants. All these types of fractures can have clean and unclean edges, and we will mention the treatment for each type in its place. All these types of fractures are recognized by examination.
It is examined with probes, and the corrupt flesh is removed from it. As for the hairy type, it is recognized by exposing the bone, wiping it, and scraping it with a spatula, as the fracture appears black. As for the treatment of the fracture, one should first consider the symptoms of the patient.
If you see in his symptoms something that indicates fear, such as fainting, weakness, loss of consciousness, voice interruption, confusion, severe fever, bulging eyes, redness, and similar symptoms, do not approach the patient or treat him, for death is likely with these symptoms.
If you see symptoms that do not concern you and you hope for his safety, then at that time take him in for treatment. This is because if the wounded person comes to you soon after being wounded, especially during the winter days.
It is necessary to make an effort to remove the bone before the fourteenth day, regardless of the circumstances, and even if it is during the summer days, it is necessary to hasten the removal of the bone before the seventh day lest what is under the bone from the covering spoils, thus exposing those symptoms that we have described.
If the bone fracture reaches the covered membrane on the brain and is accompanied by swelling and tenderness, it is necessary to cut off the swollen and tender part, as I have described to you, which involves shaving the head of the injured patient.
And expose the bone from any direction you can manage and according to the shape of the wound and what is hidden from the patient, for if, upon exposure of the bone, you see bleeding or hot pus, treat it as necessary.
This is to be done by packing the place with moistened lint in water, oil, and rose oil, and cauterizing the wound until the pus settles and the bleeding stops. Then take for straightening the bone and removing it, which will be done in one of two ways.
As for the first method, it is to cut the bone with a fine, narrow saw, and this is its form:
After that, use another piece similar to this one and show a little of it: and this is its shape:
Then use also another piece, show some of the second one as well; you must have several different pieces, some longer than others and some shorter than others, and their ends should be perfectly smooth and they should be made of Indian steel or good iron.
And use a hammer to hit the piece, so that the head is not shaken and hurt; if the bone is strong and hard, it is necessary to drill around it before using the pieces with trephines called non-blind trephines, and they are called thus.
Because it does not exceed the limit of the bone marrow beyond it, for the trephine has a round handle below its sharp tip resembling a ring or small circle that prevents it from sinking and penetrating the bone marrow.
And it is necessary for you to take many of these trephines, each one suitable for the thickness of that bone until you have for each skull a trephine according to the length and shortness of its sharp tip equal to the thickness of that skull. And this is the image of three types. From the traps, large and medium and small.
And as for the method of drilling around a broken bone, it is to place the drill on the bone and rotate it with your fingers until you know that the bone has penetrated; then transfer the drill to another place and make the distance between each hole equivalent to the thickness of a reed or its approximate.
Then cut what is between each two holes with scissors and do this as much as you can be patient with it, as we have said, until the bone splits either by hand or by something else from some of the tools prepared for that.
For example, like the saw and the thin lancets; and it is necessary to be careful that the drill or the scissors does not touch any of the marrow, for if the bone has thickened and freed itself from the marrow, which was attached to it, then remove it.
And smooth the remainder on the bone with another tool similar to the scissors, except that it should be thinner and more delicate than the other scissors; for if there is any small bone or splinters left, take them gently with whatever tools you have.
Then treat the wound afterwards with pitch and linseed oil, as will be mentioned later. As for the other method of treatment, it is a simple approach, far from doubt, mentioned by Galen and greatly praised by him. This is his statement. First, you should start by exposing the bone in the location where the fracture is most severe and prominent until when you have exposed that part, you will find beneath it the distal end of this segment, and here is its shape:
The distal part of it will be soft, not cutting anything, and the sharp part of it on its sides that go along the length, as you see. Let the distal part lean against the hammer, and strike the cut from one side onto the bone segment.
With a small hammer until all the bone is cut cleanly as it turns, and you are safe from the covering where nothing bad can happen. Even if the practitioner is ignorant of people and disdains them, yet if he were skillful.
If something remains attached to the bone from the covering in some places of the bone, scrape it off with the same distal end of the segment, and remove it cleanly, for it will come off without harm or fear.
And as for if the bone fracture does not protrude through the skin, and a piece of bone is separated with flesh and tendons attached to it, then it is necessary to scrape off that flesh and cut those tendons using a scalpel, which has been made in various sizes so that you can use them appropriately in each place and repair according to what the work requires.
And the same for a fractured bone and its shape, and it is necessary to use in your scraping first a broad scalpel for the bone, then after that a thinner one, and continue doing this until you reach using the thinnest and sharpest of them all.
And as for the other small cracks and fine fractures, it is necessary to use a treatment for each according to what leads to its healing, which is something not hidden from anyone who has the slightest understanding in this craft, considering what we have written and explained about major fractures.
And if the skin remains exposed after cutting the bone, then it is necessary to take a piece of linen the size of the wound and soak it in rose oil and place it on the mouth of the wound. Then take another piece, either double or triple-layered. Soak it in a drink and rose oil, then place it on the first layer of cloth, and make this with the least amount you can measure to prevent the bandage from becoming too heavy. Then use a wide bandage on top, not tightening it except enough to hold only the wound.
Leave it with this treatment for one or two days until the hot inflammation subsides, then wash it and use afterwards the medicines that have a drying effect such as the roots of sennas, barley flour, powdered myrobalan, and similar drugs. Make a poultice from these medicines.
Leave it on the wound as it is, dry and altogether. Use in that a medicine whose effect is to cleanse without causing pain. Dedicate your effort while treating the wound to ensure it remains clean, with no oil residue or pus, and do not leave the scab where pus collects. ‌
Because if the scab collects on the covering of the brain, it will corrupt and putrefy it, causing a severe inflammation in the patient. It may also appear in the bandage of the head when the bone is exposed, especially if it is neglected during treatment.
The blackness on its surface I observed, so if the patient shows the symptoms we mentioned, know that he will certainly die; and even if the blackness was only due to a medicine applied to it and was within the power of that medicine to cause such blackness.
Take a portion of honey and three portions of rose oil, mix them well together, apply this mixture to the ulcer, then treat it with various methods until it heals.
Chapter Three
If the nose is broken, splint it.
Know that the only part of the nose that can break is the upper jaw, for it is a bone; the lower part cannot be broken and instead shows swelling, inflammation, and bruising.
If one of the nasal bones is broken, insert your little finger into the nostril and correct the break from inside with your index finger and thumb from outside until the nose returns to its natural shape. Be gentle so that you do not cause pain to the patient.
If the break is in the upper part of the nose and cannot be reached with a finger, it should be corrected with a blunt instrument that has a little softness on its tip. If the break is in both directions, do the same thing. And hasten to splint it on the first day after the break.
If possible, after the seventh or tenth day when the fever subsides, insert a thread of linen into the nasal cavity if the fracture is on one side, or two threads if the fracture is on both sides.
And let the thread in it be greasy to the extent that it fills the nasal cavity, and some of the early compilers mentioned that the thread should be smeared with fat and changed every day. But I do not see this as necessary; rather, the thread should be dipped in egg white mixed with flour dust.
Then leave the thread until the bone sets and the swelling subsides. It is possible to insert tubes of goat hair into the nasal passage after wrapping them with soft linen, making their retention for a nose fracture more effective, so that the patient does not resist breathing.
This is not necessary; if you wish, you can do it, and if you wish, you can make the threads. If during your work the nasal passage is narrowed due to high fever, close the nostril with a cotton ball soaked in honey, oil, or any of the diachylon ointments.
If the hot cautery has not been shown, it is necessary to compress it from outside with a paste of flour and candied sugar that has been kneaded with egg white, then place a soft bandage on it, and do not bind the nostril too tightly, because if the bones of the nose are broken by small fractures.
Or if it has been fractured, it is necessary to make an incision on it and remove the bone fragments with the appropriate instrument, then suture the incision and treat it with something that sticks and soothes, such as the appropriate ointments. If there is an internal injury in the nose, it should be treated with lead pipes. Until it heals.
Chapter Four.
If the lower jaw is fractured.
If the lower jaw is fractured and there is no injury, if it is only broken on one side and the fracture ends inside, then its detection will be easy.
If the fracture is on the right side, then insert the index finger of the left hand into the patient's mouth, and similarly, if the fracture is on the left side, insert the index finger of the right hand, and use it to lift the fracture from inside to outside.
The other hand controls the bone outside, by which it is aligned. If the jaw fracture has split into two pieces, a splint should be used from both sides to maintain stability until alignment is achieved. If the teeth are affected, they should be shaken.
Or, if it is desired that a gold or silver thread or silk remain in the fractured jawbone, after threading it through, place a triangular bandage over the fracture and then place two-layered gauze on top of it. After that, apply a large firm bandage or a piece of leather sole equal to the length of the jawbone. Then tie it from above according to the best method of tying that suits you and agrees with the patient, until it does not slip. Command the patient to be patient and calm, and make his food soft. If you suspect any change in shape in one of the two sides, address it on the third day.
Then tie it from above according to the best method of tying that suits you and agrees with the patient, until it does not slip. Command the patient to be patient and calm, and make his food soft. If you suspect any change in shape in one of the two sides, address it on the third day. Then mix what you have wrapped with flour dust and egg white or semolina flour, after removing the triangular bandage from it, and place a soft compress over the swelling. As long as this swelling remains adhering to it and does not change the condition of the bone, leave it as is.
Do not remove it until it heals and the fracture strengthens, for this fracture often strengthens within three weeks. If during that time a hot worm appears, use what we mentioned repeatedly to soothe it until the worm goes away.
As for if the fracture is with a wound that has been examined, and if it has separated from the bone as slivers or splinters, then be careful in removing those splinters using what suits you to remove them with a tool. If the mouth of the wound is narrow, then widen it with a probe according to your need.
Then, if those splinters have been removed and nothing of them remains, close the mouth of the wound if it is wide; otherwise, place one of the suitable bandages on it. And let the wound heal.
Chapter Five.
It is necessary to immobilize if it has been broken.
The most common location for a fracture is at the front end of the heel, and its break can be in one of three ways: either it breaks and shatters into two parts without producing splinters, which is easier to immobilize.
And if splinters occur in the fracture, it is more difficult to immobilize. If the fracture is accompanied by a wound, the procedure is as follows: If the fracture is without a wound, prepare two assistants; one of them will steady the limb adjacent to the broken heel, while the other will stretch the neck towards the other side.
Then smooth out the fracture with your fingers until it takes the shape it should, without any irregularity or deviation. If you need more extension than is necessary, place a ball of linen or wool under the patient's limb.
So that the bone is to your liking, extend and raise it, and press the ball with your hand until the fracture is smoothed out as needed. If you cannot attract the end of the bone outward because it has penetrated deeply, then let the patient lie on his side.
And place under his elbow a moderate pad of cloth, and let the servant press his elbow down until the bone in depth rises up. Then correct the fracture and smooth it with your fingers.
If you feel that a piece of the bone has broken off and is moving, it is necessary to cut into it and remove that piece with forceps. If the fragment is embedded in the bone, then make an incision to extract it with one of the sections prepared for this purpose. After placing under the bone a device that maintains traction, which is made of wood or iron and looks like this:
The spoon resembles a spoon but without a handle, and its width is according to what is needed for the size of the bone, whether large or small. As for its length, it is also according to what you can work with, and it should have two ends, as you see one end wider and the other narrower.
If the wound, which was cut when you removed a piece of bone for the sake of the hot worm, is wide and secure from the hot worm, then close the lips of the wound with stitches. If the wound is deep or you fear the hot worm, then stuff the wound with rags and cloths according to the depth of the wound.
If the hot worm is wide, apply the wound with rose oil or vinegar, then place it on the wound and carry it there. As for strengthening the bone, if it is not a wound or cut, it is to place on the bone glue made from flour and egg white. Then place the soft mastic on it, then place a ball under the bandage if needed. Then take a very long bandage, and its width should be thin or similar to that. Then wrap two layers of cloth over the mastic and glue. Then cut a piece from a thin sheet (of metal). It will be three fingers in width, and the same in length, then insert it into a bag, then insert that bag with the splint on the site of the bandage over the broken bone, then tighten the bandage around the break as it is wound. Place it on his neck, and under the correct bandage, and under the patient's bandage, and roll it several times on each side, and as you see that the compression secures the fracture with a firm compression, which is evident to you.
And it is essential that the splint does not slip from over the broken bone. Therefore, it is necessary for the patient to be examined every day, and whenever he changes the bandage and sees that the splint has slipped, correct this and tighten the bandage. Then make the patient sleep on his back, and place a small pillow under his bandage at night while sleeping.
So that his limb rises above him, thus the fracture of the humerus rises with the elevation of the shoulder or tie his arm to his neck, and do not remove the bandage unless something happens in the place like swelling or inflammation for twelve days.
Then renew the plaster if you see it necessary. In the swelling, leave it until it becomes gangrenous and fractures the power, and strengthens and increases that in twenty-eight days. And it may be in some people in less than that.
The Sixth Chapter.
The Fracture of the Shoulder. Little is the shoulder broken in its broad part, but it breaks from its letters, so when a place or the middle of it is broken, that is known by touch, and according to what the shape of the fracture is, it should be set.
Set it and leave it in its natural shape by all means possible, then apply to the place the flour of millstones with egg white and soft mastic, put on top a double piece of linen cloth, then place on it a wide bandage of board.
It should be thin according to the size of the shoulder, or slightly wider than it. If there is a swelling under the bandage in any part of the shoulder, smooth out that swelling with soft mastic until the bandage falls level, then bind on top with a long cloth strip.
Bind it firmly and secure it from the bandage so that it does not slip from its place, and examine the bandage every day; whenever the bandage loosens, tighten it and straighten the bandage if it has slipped from its place, and let the patient lie on his sound side. The shoulder will become gangrenous in twenty days.
A day or twenty-five days, and if this period is completed, the ligament will be healed and you are safe, for it is one of the bones whose breakage does not cause fear or fracture. If a spur appears from the bone that was lying under the skin, cut it off and remove it. And do what was mentioned in the case of breaking the ankle to relieve hot swelling if such a thing happens.
The Seventh Section.
In fractures of the chest,
The chest may fracture in the middle, but this is rare. More commonly, it fractures and collapses at its edges. If the chest fractures in the middle, it causes severe pain, difficulty breathing, and coughing.
If there is bleeding, it will be evident in the fractured bone and unmistakable to touch. The patient must lie on his back, with a pillow under his head. Then, bring together the shoulder blades and compress them. Collect the elbows with both hands from both sides and gently straighten it as much as possible.
Continue to support it until the bone returns to its proper shape, then place a splint and bandages on top of it. Place a board made of fir or cypress wood or similar in the sole of the foot after softening it in hot water. وشدّه شدّا محكما
Then he should be careful in binding it onto the fractured bone so that it does not slip, and pass the bandage over the back to the spine multiple times and tie it firmly. Then check the bandage at all times, and whenever it loosens, tighten it again. And if necessity demands its removal, such as when a tumor or pain appears at the site of the injury or wound, hasten to remove it and treat whatever has appeared accordingly; then replace the bandage if deemed necessary.
Chapter Eight
In the case of broken ribs, know that ribs only break in the hard areas adjacent to the spine and their corresponding front areas, for these are cartilaginous. The recognition of this is not hidden from touch during palpation with the fingers.
And straighten it by aligning the fracture with your fingers on the side that allows it, until the shape is level as required. Then apply and tightly bind the broken rib with a splint if necessary, for if the fracture of the ribs is inclined inward, it causes the patient severe pain.
The swelling that appears with a hole in the bone, presenting difficulty in breathing and coughing, as well as severe nosebleeds, is difficult to treat, and many methods have been used for it.
Some say that the patient's food should be made to produce wind and gas, causing the abdomen to swell and lengthen, which expels the fracture outward; but we disapprove of this because it may cause inflammation if it has not yet occurred. If it has already occurred, then it worsens and confirms it.
Some say that a heated bandage should be placed on the area and pressed firmly, as it is similar to cupping except that there is a fear that the bandage may draw excessively towards the weakened place. Others say that the area should be covered with wool soaked in hot oil.
A pad should be placed between the buttocks so that it fills up and makes the bandage level when wrapped around a roll, then treat the patient with the usual diet and medicine for swelling. If the patient's condition is very severe and unbearable. The bone was ulcerating the membrane painfully and causing anxiety for the patient, so it is necessary to make an incision on the spot and uncover the broken piece, then place under it the apparatus that preserves the skin whose description we have provided, and cut the bone with a saw and remove it.
Then we bring together the edges of the wound, if it is large, with stitches and treat it with poultices until it heals; but if during this time a hot worm appears, one should hasten to pound rose petals in oil and place them on the spot, and also treat the patient with what expels the worm from within.
And he should sleep on the side that is most comfortable for him until he recovers.
Chapter Nine.
Then we should cauterize the spine and the neck.
As for the bones of the neck, if they are fractured and little is disclosed about them and more so with spinal injuries, as well as with fractures of the spine, if this happens to someone and you wish to know whether he will recover or not, Then look, if you see his hands have become shrunken and wrinkled and died, and he is not able to move them or extend them or close them, and if they are numb or ulcerated by a needle and he does not feel it and finds no pain in them, then know that he will not recover in most cases; for he is perishing.
If he moves them and feels them with the disc and the axe, know that the bone has been restored to health, and the patient will recover with treatment. So if the backbone is affected in a similar manner and you wish to know whether it will also heal or not.
Look at his feet; if you see that they have been paralyzed and something has happened to them like what happens in the hands, then when he lies on his back, wind and urine come out involuntarily. And if he lies on his stomach, urine comes out involuntarily. If he lies on his back and tries to urinate but cannot, know that he is dying; do not worry about treating him. But if none of this happens to him, the condition is milder. The treatment for what has happened is to anoint with something soothing for hot inflammation.
By placing on the clean wound an ointment of rose oil alone, or mixed with roasted egg yolk, apply it three times a day until the hot inflammation subsides. Then place on the spot one of the strong, moist compresses and bind it firmly with a bandage, and order him to rest and remain still. ة
Do not sleep except on the side where he does not find pain until he recovers, for if there is swelling or something that can be removed from the bone near the anus, it is necessary to cut the skin and remove that bone. Then, if the wound is large, sew the edges of the wound with stitches, then treat it with medicated dressings until he recovers. If another bone breaks, specifically the tip of the tail, it is necessary to insert a probe from the left hand into the anus.
The broken bone is aligned by the other hand as much as possible, and then a splint and bandages are placed on it if necessary, and it is tied.
If you feel a swelling that is broken in it, cut it open and remove it, and treat the wound with the treatment mentioned until he recovers.
Chapter Ten.
Treatment of a fractured vertebra.
It is rare for the vertebrae to fracture, but if they do, the fracture occurs such that it splinters at its edges and breaks along its length, leaning inward. The patient experiences pain in that place, becomes weak, and the leg from which the fracture originates swells towards it.
You must pass your hand over it until you reach the fracture to see how it is shaped. If the fracture is only in the extremities, then straighten that fracture according to what makes it comfortable for you until it resembles its natural shape.
If the fracture is in the length or has been displaced internally, place the patient on his back until the fracture makes it comfortable for you to straighten it. When you have straightened it, apply a splint and then place a splint of wood or leather on it and bind it firmly.
Do not be afraid of the fracture shifting or the splint slipping away, and fill the space between the splinters with what will fit until it takes the binding firmly. Order the patient to lie on his stomach or on the healthy side if he has a fever.
Then refrain from extending and straightening it until the fever subsides and apply what is needed to soothe it as mentioned earlier. Then return to straightening it and bind it as necessary. If a bone splinter appears in the bone or breaks off from its end, it should not be removed.
And it should not be touched, but straightened from the outside as we have said, and its binding should be left until it heals.
Chapter Eleven.
On the setting of bone fractures.
The bone is what is between the elbow and the shoulder, so if it fractures, it must be set in one of two ways; one way is to take a flexible, smooth, moderate-sized cane, shaped as follows:.
And two straps are tied to its ends, then it is hung from a high place, and the patient sits on a chair. Then his fractured arm is placed on the cane until its palm touches the middle of the cane's bend. Then something heavy is hung above it.
Or an attendant can hold it down, and the physician straightens the fracture with his hands until the bone returns to its proper position. The other method is for the patient to lie on his back and his arm is hung from his neck by a strap.
Then two attendants are ordered: one to hold the part above the fracture with his hand, and the other to hold below it, each pulling towards himself. If you want the pull to be stronger, a strap is tightened under the fracture and another above it, and each attendant pulls in his direction.
If the fracture is near the shoulder, it is necessary that one of the straps be placed under the palm and the other under the fracture towards the elbow; similarly, if the fracture is near the elbow, it is necessary that the strap be in this place and on the elbow itself.
Then smooth the fracture gently without force until it aligns as required and unites well, then bind it; if there is no sign of inflammation, but if there is a sign of inflammation, leave binding it until the seventh day, placing on it a wool pad soaked in vinegar and rose oil.
When the inflammation subsides, bind it then. The method of binding is to place felt on the fracture, then place a new cloth bandage over the felt, and gather the arm at the same joint, placing his hand open on his hip.
And place the bandage and binding on the joint and arm so that the arm stands like a post, unless something prevents you from doing this or if the broken bone has changed in any way; if you fear it will change, use splints.
This is to place on the fracture itself a splint that is wider and stronger than the other splints, and there should be a finger's width between each splint, and the length of the splints should be according to the fracture with an additional three fingers from each side.
Then bind the splints with the binding mentioned at the beginning of this chapter.
It is that your bandage on the fracture site be tighter.
And whenever after the fracture the bandage is looser, if you see the setting of the splint and the bandage as we have said at the time of making a plaster cast for the limb from your hour, then do it.
And if you fear inflammation, leave the bandage and the splint until the seventh day as we have said, then check the bandage every three days lest a knot or swelling occur in the place, or the food be prevented from reaching the limb due to excessive tightness. All of this will be corrected as we have mentioned.
So if you are confident that none of this will happen, do not loosen the bandage until after many days, and let the patient lie on his back with his hand placed as he likes, and place under the arm a woolen bag filled moderately.
And check every time, day or night, lest the shape of the broken limb be altered or the bandage loosen. Correct all this with your effort. And let the patient's food be as we have mentioned, that the food should be light at first until when the bone wants to intensify.
It is necessary for his food to be harsh, for it is the custom of the fingers and toes to intensify in forty days. At that time, it is appropriate for him to take baths and use steaming with towels suitable for that purpose, if the fracture is splintered and suppressed.
Do not remove the bandage for fifty days or two months.
Chapter Twelve
On the setting of the fracture of the arm.
The arm is composed of two bones, one of which is called the ulna and it is small, located near the elbow. The other is large and is placed under the small one from below. Sometimes the larger bone alone may break, or the smaller one alone, or they may both break together.
When the smaller, upper bone breaks, its setting is easy and its healing is faster. But if the lower bone breaks, its break is poor and its healing slow. If both bones break together, the treatment should be directed towards the bone that broke the smaller, upper one.
When setting it, the physician should make its position smooth and gentle, until he aligns it. If it is the larger bone that has broken, then he should make the positioning stronger. And if both bones have broken together, then he should make the positioning very strong.
And it is necessary to place the shape of the hand at the time of suturing, and extending it on a support, and let the swelling of the hand be higher than all the fingers, and the thumb be lower than the rest of the fingers, and the patient sits with his legs crossed.
And let the support be at his height so that the patient does not experience difficulty.
Then the assistant stretches the arm from below, either by hand or with a band, and another assistant stretches it from above in the same way. Then the physician straightens the bone until he restores it to the best shape possible. If there is a bone fracture, then traction is applied.
Return every fracture to its place with your best effort, for if a closed fracture appears in it and the skin is not torn or there is no desire to suture it, then make an incision over it and extract it according to what we mentioned before. If the break is with a wound, then you have provided it with an opening.
So treat it from there, for if in the first suture a hot thorn appears, then puncture a hole with the cautery needle oiled with rose oil and white wax, and let it be moderate between the skin and the flesh, and tighten the puncture on it tightly until the pain subsides.
Remove the kirut and place the prepared poultice of millstone dust with egg white, then carry the splints. The splints that are placed on the fracture should be slightly wider and stronger. Know that the number of forearm splints is usually six in most cases.
The break was in one or both shanks, then make your bandage on the fracture site strong and firm, and every time you turn the bandage upwards or downwards, make the bandage slightly looser than what was previously mentioned at the beginning of this chapter.
Let the bandage that is wrapped on the fracture be a soft, moist bandage, not very hard, and let the thread that wraps it be made of cotton, medium between thin and thick as we described. Examine the limb and the bandage after some days.
If something happens that needs fixing, such as a blister appearing on the limb, it is necessary to immerse the limb in clean water until the blister subsides and leave the limb unbound overnight to rest, then rebind it.
If the bandage has loosened and the bone has moved or nearly so, repair it all with your best effort. Also look out if food is unable to reach the limb due to excessive tightness of the bandage; it should be loosened slightly and left for a few days until nourishment can flow, then rebind it.
If nothing is presented to the patient from what we mentioned, it should not be bandaged except after twenty days or thereabouts. Then tie the patient's hand to his neck, let his arm hang freely, and protect him from disruptive movements, and make him sleep on his back.
Know that this break in the arm heals in thirty days, or forty days, and sometimes it heals in twenty-eight days; all of this depends on the conditions of the patient and their strength.
Chapter Eleven.
On the healing of breaks in the hand and fingers.
For the hand and the fingers, bandages are rarely used; instead, they rely heavily on splints. So when there is a break or fracture in the hand...
It is necessary for the patient to sit cross-legged with a stool in front of him at a level height.
Then he places his hand on it, extended. The servant then pulls the broken bones, and the physician straightens them until they are aligned well. At that point, it is necessary to carry a splint and a sling unless there is inflammation. Then a bandage is placed on top according to the location.
He has placed it in a soft splint, and if the fracture is towards the inside of the palm, make a ball-like shape from the splint and instruct the patient to squeeze it with their broken hand, then secure it with a long splint.
Let the splint be of soft leather to adhere to the skin with all of the palm’s pliability, and secure it as needed. If the fracture is on the outside, it is necessary to make the splint from above and another from below on the palm so that the hand remains open and erect.
Then he shall bear the splint as the hand turns, and it should be intertwined between the fingers with a bandage. If the fracture is in one of the joints of the fingers, if there is a displacement, let it be set right as needed, then splinted with the palm. And if you wish to make for him a small upright splint to support the fracture.
And let him not move if the fracture is in the rest of the fingers, such as the middle finger or the ring finger, or the little finger. Let it be set right and bound with the finger following it that is sound, or all are bound together on a stick, which is better, or place upon them a small upright splint.
As we mentioned in the discussion and examination at the time of treatment and after it from the hot worm, you should face it with what is appropriate when something like that happens repeatedly, as described.
Chapter Fourteen.
In the setting of a femur fracture.
The thigh bone often breaks and the touch can easily detect it because it turns frontward and backward, and its setting is to place a band above the break and another band below the break, with the patient lying on his stomach.
Then each band is stretched by the servant in that direction, following this if the break is in the middle of the bone. But if it is near the base of the thigh, a soft band should be tied.
When the break is near the base of the thigh, towards the knee, let the pull be on top and the other band below the break. Similarly, if the break is near the knee, let the band be near the knee so that the pull is downward. Then the physician straightens the bone with both hands until he returns it to its natural shape.
The bone is then tied with a good tie, and then it should bear the weight and pressure if no hot worm has affected the limb. If there is a hot worm in it, leave it for several days until the hot worm settles, and then return to its treatment.
The knot should be tied on the fracture with a broad, strong headband, twice or thrice as wide as needed, and what remains is extra. Then tie the leg until the heel reaches the base of the toes, and insert a long thread between the thigh and the leg near the ankle from below, and the ends of the thread should emerge from above on both sides.
Then wrap the remaining headband around the leg and thigh, then make a bandage in the same place on the thigh where the fracture is, and make one bandage on the shin bone, then tighten the gap between the thigh and the leg with soft cloths to equalize the pressure.
Then begin to tighten strongly from the middle on the place of the fracture, three or four times, and each time you move the bandage away from the place of the fracture, let your tightening be less, softer, and weaker.
Then turn to the ends of the thread that you inserted between the thigh and the leg, tie them with what follows from the bandages above it, then pass the ends of the thread below until they reach the ankle; tighten with them also the ends of the bandages from the other side.
If the ligature is about to slip from its place, then leave the compression on it as long as there is no swelling, inflammation, or distension in the member. However, if any of these occur, hasten to release it and correct whatever has occurred entirely, as we have mentioned repeatedly.
If there is a splinter embedded in the bone, it should be straightened if possible; otherwise, break off the protruding part and remove it, treating the wound as previously described until healed. This fracture may also involve the thigh without including the leg.
As we mentioned in the case of fingers and arms, except that breaking it like this does not present a risk to the patient. Even if only one bone is broken without involving the leg, the owner must always limp.
Know that the thigh becomes severe in fifty days or slightly more or less, all depending on the difference in mixtures and other conditions.
Chapter Fifteen.
In the case of a fracture of the ankle joint.
The ankle joint rarely fractures, but it is often dislocated. If it does fracture, it can either be broken or split into its parts, with or without a wound.
"It should be held entirely by the sense of touch, and it is obligated to smooth out what separates its parts with the fingers until they come together and unite according to the extent that smoothing, gentleness, and skill allow. Then place a tourniquet and put on it a rotating splint if necessary.
"It is bandaged from above with a suitable splint, then all the conditions described for other fractures, such as heat and similar treatments, are applied to counteract each condition until it heals.
Chapter Sixteen
In setting the fracture of the shinbone.
The shinbone has two bones: one is thick and called the tibia, while the other is thin and called the fibula. Both of them can fracture in the same ways that arm bones can fracture. Therefore, its setting is the same as the setting of the arm, and the treatment is one, for if both bones are fractured together, the shinbone turns to all directions. If the thinner bone is fractured, the shinbone turns forward. If the thicker bone is fractured and this happens from below, it is clear to you what that means.
Use the straightening and alignment, and suture the joints according to that, except that if the break in the leg is an ugly break with many shards, the straightener should be smaller and lighter, and direct your effort towards strengthening it.
In the leg, there is an additional procedure compared to the arm, which is that after you have straightened the joints and finished all your work on it, take two pieces of willow pipe, which is used for lining the walls that are placed between the slats or made from palm fibers or similar.
Choose from them a piece that has little thickness and is not of the thin type, and its length should be on the leg from the ankle to below. Then wrap around each one two bandages along its length; place one on the leg and the other on the opposite side.
And let it be from the ankle to below the foot, then bind the two splints in three places: at the ends and the middle. For with this binding, the leg is prevented from bending to the right or left and achieves a good fixation. A wooden peg can also be used along the length of the leg.
It should be placed to keep it from moving, and the best way to do this is in a fracture if there is a specific wound with it; then examine the leg every day and take great care to protect against inflammation or swelling or any of that. If any of that happens, treat it as appropriate until it heals, and the bone in the leg will mend after thirty days or so.
Chapter Seventeen.
In the Fractures of the Leg and Toes.
As for the heel, it is not subject to fracture of the shaft; as for the leg bones, they may be subject to fracture, and the toes also rarely fracture, and if they do, it is usually a dislocation in most cases.
If the leg bone is fractured and you see that some of these bones have protruded over others, let the patient place his foot on the ground standing as if walking, then rise up and place your foot on what has risen from those bones, and then straighten and align them.
Until it returns to its place, then take the bandage and splint from above and place a small smooth board under the sole of the foot, then tighten the foot with a strong bandage after loosening it with cloths and whatever else is needed.
If three or four days have passed for him, release the bandage, for you will find the bones level, whether they were fractured or dislocated; proceed as you see fit. But if some of the fingers are broken, then force them and align them according to what you described for setting the hand's fingers.
Then make a splint for the broken finger along its entire length, and let it be slightly wider than the finger. Next, place under the foot the board that you described to me, and tighten it firmly, if the fracture is in two or three bones or more.
So make a splint for each finger, fitting into a soft bandage, and tighten the board under the foot so that each end of the board protrudes outward from beneath the sole of the foot to achieve a good fit.
And you should remember to do all that we mentioned to you in the treatment of other fractures, as well as for each type according to what is necessary.
Chapter Eighteen.
On the Fracture of the Femur in Women, and the Bones of the Anus and Penis in Men.
When the pubic bone of a woman is fractured, seat her on her heels, then lean her towards her back little by little, holding from behind; then fill the cavity of her pubis with cotton until it is full and becomes like a ball in her pubis.
The woman is shaken and her bone is raised slightly, so that the cotton comes out until it becomes like a ball at the entrance of the vagina, and then the fracture of the bone returns. Then you make a pillow for her back, and when she wants to defecate, remove the cotton with gentleness until she defecates.
And you return it to the way you first inserted it, then you go back to her original pillow. Do this for seven days or so, because it will heal. If you wish to take a sheep's bladder, attach a reed pipe to its mouth and insert the entire bladder into her vagina.
Then blow into the pipe with strength until the bladder inflates inside the vagina, for the fracture will return. Then pack it with cotton and leave it for as many days as we described until it heals. As for when a person's penis or vagina is fractured, this method is used to treat it.
And it is treated as we described for the bone of the shin. Let not the correct way in these unusual fractures be hidden from you, especially those who have some experience and understand this book well, because the fracture itself will guide you in most cases.
On the correct path in its incision and suturing, understand this: if a man's thigh bone breaks, loop a band around his penis so that it enters the loop, then place a linen cloth over it and let it heal for three days or thereabouts until he is cured.
Chapter Nineteen.
In the incision of bone fractures if they are with a wound.
If one has a fracture with a wound, especially if the bone is large like the thigh or shin bone or similar, it is necessary to quickly drain it at the appropriate time, as we have shown in the conditions for draining.
If the wound is bleeding, you should hasten to suture it by sprinkling powdered gypsum on it if nothing else is available. Then perform the incision for the fracture on that same day without delaying.
If inflammation does not occur, if inflammation occurs, leave its incision until the ninth day so that the hot inflammation settles, and do not approach it on the third and fourth days in any case, as he will be exposed to bad symptoms.
If the fractured bone is exposed to the skin, you should reduce and set it back with your hand gently and slowly. If it does not allow you to reduce and set it with your hand, then reduce it with this instrument, which is made of iron, seven or eight hand spans long. To expose it to the extent of the wound.
Therefore, it is fitting for the physician to take from it three or four times the amount needed for treatment in each type of fracture, and that they be round so that there is a little thickness in them, lest they split when they are pressed upon during work.
And let them have sharp edges, with a little fat at the ends, and let their upper part be thick, while from the middle to the bottom they should be very thin. Here is its shape:.
And it is called "perim" in Greek, which means a small splint. It is necessary for its sharp end to be inserted into the broken bone and to push it with it once until when the bone returns and some balance is achieved, trim off the edges of the fracture evenly against each other.
But if the broken end is thin and the instrument did not take hold of it well, it is necessary to cut off that end of the bone so that the instrument can grasp it. If you cannot return the bone with the method we described, then cut it according to the shape it takes on the segments we mentioned.
Or scrape it with one of the rasps as much as you can, then remove what remains in the bone from the thin skin and flakes. If, after returning the bone, the patient finds intense pain, know that the bone has not returned to its natural place.
If you can return it to its natural place, do so, for the patient will benefit greatly. If the fracture is complete, soak a bandage in strong black wine, especially if it is summer, and do not put any ointment on the wound or anything containing oil.
Do not let putrefaction and decay occur in it, then use the bandages after you are done with setting the bone, leaving the wound open by making incisions around it with scissors according to the size of the wound.
Be very careful not to close the wound with the fracture, for many ignorant physicians do this and cause their patients either death or gangrene or abscess. Your closure should be soft and loose, contrary to the closure of other fractures.
If the wound is bad or large, and you fear some of the unfavorable symptoms we mentioned, and he feels pain in that place, then it is not appropriate to put bandages on it. Make stiff bandages in the place of the bandages and tighten them with them.
If after a day or two you see that the wound has begun to fester, remove the bandage soaked in wine from it. Then use poultices and herbs that we are accustomed to using for dressing wounds, such as a quartan fever poultice, and so on. It is also advisable for you to loosen the bandage.
It is necessary to examine the wound every evening and morning until it heals and clears, and it is appropriate that a limb be placed in such a way that pus drains easily from it downward. If many days have passed for the wound without it adhering or breaking off, know that there are small bone fragments present.
It is necessary to investigate the wound with a probe; if any of those fragments are free, remove and extract them. If they are not free and adhere to the limb and cause pain, crush them and remove them entirely as possible.
If the wound shows signs of ulceration, gangrene or any other form of corruption and decay, it is necessary to address each sign with its corresponding treatment as described in its relevant chapter.
It is important to pause and reflect if a large bone, such as the thigh or arm bones, breaks and settles on the limb; do not attempt to pull it out or push it back in. Often, doing so results in death; instead, leave it alone until it decays. Perhaps it will fall out on its own after twenty or thirty days.
"If you see a place for treatment in the wound, treat it; otherwise, leave it.
"Chapter Twenty.
"Treatment of adhesions that appear due to some fractures.
"This adhesion often appears after the fracture heals, especially if it is near the joints, and it changes the shape of the limb, sometimes preventing the limb from performing its natural function.
"If the adhesion is mild, use the following drugs that contract: asafoetida, opium, myrobalan, aloe, and others like them. Take some or all of these and mix them with a constricting drink, egg white, or vinegar.
"And place them on the adhesion with pressure, securing them well over it and leaving the pressure for several days. Then remove it and repeat another until the adhesion disappears, God willing, or secure a lead sheet over it.
"For lead has the property of dissolving everything it touches in the limbs, so if the adhesion has hardened and worsened and necessity drives you to remove it, cut it out from above and cut off the attached flesh or scrape it with some of the ointments until it disappears and treat the wound until it heals.
"The twenty-first chapter.
"In the treatment of fractures, if a bone is broken and then becomes thin after that, unlike its original form.
"If a bone fracture occurs and the limb becomes thin and weak after that, this is due to numerous reasons. "One of these reasons is either the excessive loosening and tying of the ligaments in an improper manner, or the over-tightening of the ligaments to the point that nourishment cannot reach the limb, or excessive swelling, or premature movements at the wrong time, or a lack of blood in the body of the patient and its weakness.
"And the treatment for that is to nourish the patient and strengthen his body until the blood increases in him, and the use of the bath, and the introduction of cheerfulness and joy on him, then to place fat on the limb so that it draws abundant nourishment to it, or to continuously bathe it with lukewarm water. "Until nourishment flows through it and it returns to its natural shape.
"The twenty-second chapter.
"In the treatment of fractured bones, if they are broken and prevented from functioning as they should.
The leg when displayed after amputation, due to the breaking of the bone or the swelling and inflammation that occurred in it, shows the shape of the limb. However, the limb did not cease from its natural function, so it is not right to accept the statement of someone who claims that a limb breaks at the root, for many unskilled physicians and those forced to do so have done this in our country.
This act is extremely reprehensible and leads to great disappointment, for it causes gangrene. However, if the swelling and inflammation are mild, it is appropriate to use water in which plants such as leaves of the willow tree, its root, and the like have been boiled.
It is also treated with herbal compresses, such as well-made compresses of linseed or the root of willow and similar plants, crushed with chicken fat and shark oil and used as a compress, or dried dates are taken and ground with pigeon dung and other medicines called anti-inflammatory.
Use diluted alum, which is a thin permanent solution that exists in the hands, and move the limb in all directions during all times. If the swelling has advanced, become severe, and turned into gangrene, necessity dictates treating it with iron.
It is necessary to cut the top and release the bone connection, and remove any excess flesh or bone with scissors for thread. Use care and effort in this, then treat the wound with what was previously mentioned until it heals.
Chapter Thirty-Two.
If a dislocation occurs in the joints, it prevents movement and deforms the limb, causing severe pain for the patient. Therefore, when someone experiences a dislocation, it is necessary to quickly return it to its original position.
It should not be delayed, for if it is delayed, the swelling will make it difficult to reduce the dislocation. Therefore, it should not be delayed, moved, or stretched when it is swollen, as this often causes shivering and painful sensations in the patient.
However, if this occurs, it is necessary to hurry to immobilize the patient, then leave him until the swelling subsides a little, then place the limb in hot water and oil, then reduce it carefully and treat each limb as will be mentioned later in its place.
The sections on dislocation have also been arranged according to what was mentioned in fractures, from the top of the body to the bottom.
The Fourth and Twenty-First Chapter
On Treating the Injury of the Lower Jaw
It rarely happens that the teeth become loose except in rare cases, and their removal occurs for two reasons: either they move away from their place easily with little effort, or they are completely removed entirely until they heal. Until the chest, causing the patient's saliva to flow and preventing them from holding it back or applying pressure to their teeth, and making their tongue slur when speaking. If removing it is easy, it may return in most cases with little effort.
If the tooth is completely removed, it is necessary to restore it quickly without delay. The servant holds the patient's head, and the physician inserts his index finger into the root of the tooth in the patient's mouth if the tooth is from one side.
Or he inserts both fingers if the tooth is from both sides, and with the rest of his fingers from outside, he aligns it and commands the patient to heal their teeth and expel them towards every side, and the physician aligns the tooth and pushes it until it returns to its place.
It is difficult to return them, especially if both are broken entirely. Therefore, use hot water and oil to soften them until they can be returned, without delaying their return as we mentioned. If they return and align, but do not settle, then place a wax and tallow cone on them with rosemary.
Then tie with a ribbon, and let the patient sleep on his back, with his head raised between two pillows so that he cannot move to the right or left and is not forced to chew anything; rather, make his food very soft.
Until the pain subsides and the jawbone heals, let him eat what is comfortable for him, using the ribbon, and do not allow him to open his mouth while eating, drinking, or speaking until the jawbone has set and healed.
If the jawbones are difficult to return after they have dislocated, even if they do not return to their original places, many cases may result in permanent pain and swelling. Sometimes the patient's abdomen may protrude or frequently experience menstrual cramps. If you see this, know that it is a sign of corruption.
And often he dies from that within ten days.
The Twenty-Fifth Chapter
Regarding the correction of the dislocation and the tip of the nose.
As for the dislocation, it does not protrude from the inner side because of its connection to the chest; however, it may protrude outward, which is evident by touch. It is necessary for the patient to lie on his back and extend his arms.
Then press the area firmly with your palm, and it will return to its place. After that, apply a bandage and splints and secure them. As for the tip of the nose that connects to the nostril, it rarely becomes dislodged. If it does become dislodged one day, it is necessary to reposition and align it as we mentioned, and prepare what you need.
Then apply a bandage, splints, and compression, and instruct the patient to maintain rest and quiet until he recovers. With this treatment, the tip of the nose also returns to its place if it has been displaced.
The Twenty-Sixth Chapter
Regarding the correction of a broken nose.
Know that the nose only dislocates in three ways: one is that it dislocates towards the cheek below, and the second is that it dislocates towards the chest; rarely does it dislocate above the nose.
And it does not break to the back for the place of the shoulder, nor does it break forward for the place of the nerve, and what breaks and exits is usually down towards the navel, especially in those with little flesh, because it quickly exits and quickly enters.
As for those with abundant flesh, it is the opposite, meaning it exits with difficulty and enters with difficulty. Sometimes a person may receive a blow or fall, damaging the tendon and causing intense pain, leading one to believe that it has broken. It is necessary to examine this until its soundness is confirmed.
Then, in its treatment, the break is recognized if it is downwards towards the navel, for there will be a clear difference between the broken tendon and the sound one. You will find the head of the tendon distorted, and beneath the navel, when touching the head of the tendon, it feels like an egg.
The patient is unable to raise their hand to their ear or move it in any way, and similarly, if the break is towards the chest or above, you will find this evident upon touch; nothing is hidden.
And this dislocation may be easy to return, if it is recent or the patient is a child. To return it, have an assistant raise their hand above the area, then place your index finger under the joint and lift the joint with strength above its place, and the assistant raises their hand and extends it upwards.
Then place it down, and it will return quickly. But if it does not return with what was mentioned, and the dislocation has been since many days ago, then it is necessary for the patient to bathe in hot water and use a linen cloth that is greasy and oily, like cooking the root of the mandrake, the date stone, and the king's finger in water and using it.
Then the patient should lie on their back, and a ball of wool should be placed under the joint, one that is moderate between softness and firmness. Then the doctor should place his heel on the ball and hold the patient's hand with his hand and extend it downwards.
And he should push the ball with his foot, and it will return to its place. If you want, you can return it in this way, which is to have a man taller than the patient stand next to him and enter his armpit under the patient's joint and raise the joint up until the patient is suspended in the air. A second servant draws the patient's hand down towards his abdomen; if the patient is light, it is advisable to attach something else to him to make him heavier, for the dislocation returns to its place after an hour, and it may also turn back on another side.
It is to place a long piece of wood on the ground, its head being rounded like a hawthorn fruit, not thick nor thin. Then it is placed under the patient's groin after putting a soft cloth on the head of the wood, and the patient stands on the length of the wood.
Then his hand is stretched down from the other side, and his body is also stretched from the other side with force. For the dislocation returns to its place quickly. If it is difficult to return with all that we have mentioned, then this treatment should be applied: take a piece of wood whose length is about two cubits. And its width should be four fingers, and its thickness two fingers. It should have a rounded head so that it can easily enter the depth of the groin like this:
Then a soft cloth is tied to the rounded head so that the wood does not hurt the patient. It is then placed under the groin, and the hand and arm are stretched down onto the wood. The wood is tied to the thigh, shin, and fingertips.
The arm is placed on a support, the body being suspended from the opposite side, and when the shoulder has entered from its socket, it is necessary to place under the arm a moderate-sized ball of wool.
Then the prepared bandage of millstone powder and milk, with egg white, is applied to the entire wound in a circular manner as it rolls from above. The ball under the arm is then pressed firmly and tied with a ligature over the bandage, and the hand is hung by its neck.
And he is left not moving his hand for seven days, and it is necessary to make the patient's food little so that the limb becomes strong, which will facilitate its healing. Then after the seven days or five, he is made to move about in exercise. If it has become steady and has not slackened, then it has recovered.
If the shoulder is dislocated frequently due to moisture or another cause, it is necessary to use a splint with three strips, as described in the chapter on splints. If this is done and the bandage is removed after seven days, the shoulder will be stable.
The suture and the tie were applied multiple times, but it did not hold, and it fell out and slipped away, so I realized that the nerve at the end of the ligament had either been cut or stretched or slipped, so I realized then that the ligament would never hold in its place again.
And as for the fracture that is towards the chest and back, set it by pushing and extending with the hands until it returns, and use the rest of the tie and treatment until it heals. If, after healing, stiffness appears in the limb and movement slows down.
Therefore, the patient should use the bath frequently until that stiffness softens and returns to its original state.
Chapter Seventeen.
In the treatment of clavicle fracture.
The clavicle fracture is difficult to treat and also returns with difficulty. It can fracture in all directions, especially forward or backward. Its fracture is not hidden from you because it is located under the sight and touch in any shape of fracture.
And if the fractured clavicle is brought near the healthy one, this will be clear to you by the distortion of the bone and it will not be able to raise the arm or touch its shoulder. You should hasten and reduce the fracture as soon as possible before a hot swelling appears on it. ‌
In case of a hot and dry ulcer, it is difficult to treat, especially if the jawbone is affected, as it is the most painful type of jawbone infection, and death often occurs with it.
If possible, have the servant place his hand with both hands and extended arms, and the doctor's hand on top of the shoulder blade and below it, and he should push the joint with all his hands or the base of his palm until it returns to its place.
As for if the dislocation is in front, it may return by bending the hand once until it strikes the base of its palm against the opposite shoulder. If the dislocation does not return, use strong force, which is that two servants support the arm.
The patient should also be held by two servants so that he does not slip during the support, then the arm is turned in all directions after being wrapped with a soft cloth or wide bandages. If the doctor touches the joint with his hand, it should be oiled to make it easier to move the joint.
Then the joint is pushed strongly until it returns. After its return, a splint should be placed on it containing the juice and dried pomegranate peel mixed with egg white, tightly bandaged, and the arm is hung from the patient's neck for several days.
Then, if the joint is stable in its place, remove the bandage and leave it; if you see that the joint has not strengthened, prepare another bandage and bandage, leaving it for several days until it strengthens, then remove it. If a dislocation occurs after returning the joint and removing the bandage.
If there is difficulty in movement, apply moistening with a soft towel or bandage until it becomes supple, or place on the joint a fatty pouch of a sheep and tie it, leaving it for a day and night, then remove it and enter the bath. If it swells, bandage the joint with a moderate bandage.
Then prepare another fatty pouch for it, a second and a third time with entering the bath until it becomes supple; if you wish to place wet cow dung mixed with oil on it and bind it, do that several times because it will become supple and return to its original state.
The Twenty-Eighth Chapter.
On the treatment of fractures.
Fractures of the hand are often displaced and reducing its fracture is easier than other joints, except that it should be reduced quickly in the hour it was displaced before swelling or inflammation occurs.
The servant places the patient's finger on a board, and he stretches out his hand, and the doctor places his palm on the end of the fracture and pushes it until it returns, but he should look to see if the fracture has gone into the inside of the hand.
The patient should place the back of his hand on the board during extension and flexion, and if the fracture is prominent towards the back of the hand, then the placement of his hand should be with the palm on the board so that the doctor's hand falls on the same end of the fracture. If it returns in its place, otherwise tighten it with a gentle binding to reduce the pain.
Leave it so that it does not recur, for it cannot bear or be returned after some days have passed, except the fracture remains prominent, and it will not harm the patient unless the hand has been paralyzed and is unable to grasp anything.
Then you will know that the nerve has been cut or stretched, and there is no remedy for it except to bind it with a gentle bandage; perhaps it may help, or perhaps not at all. If the return of the finger is completed, place on it the bandage that we have described, then bind it and leave it for five days.
Then he will perform exercises and practice with his hand, for if it becomes difficult to move and a swelling appears in it, let him dip it in hot water and myrrh repeatedly until it softens.
Chapter Twenty-Nine.
On the treatment of dislocated fingers.
If a finger dislocates in any direction, when it dislocates towards the back of the palm or inside, extend the finger and push the dislocation with your thumb until it returns. Then bind the base of the finger and bandage it towards the direction it dislocated to.
And leave it for two days, then release it and extend it until it stands upright during the day. If it is night, bind it according to the same description, but continue to exercise it by day and practice movement with it, and bind it at night. Do this for several days until it strengthens.
Do the same if it dislocates to the inside of the hand; bind it towards the same direction and do as you did before until it heals, and do the same for other directions.
Chapter Thirty.
On the treatment of dislocated vertebrae in the back.
When a hernia ruptures from the hernias of the back or neck, if it is complete or many hernias have disappeared from their places, there is no treatment because death will quickly reach the patient.
And the sign of this is that the patient's hernia protrudes involuntarily, which he cannot control, and often some of his limbs are paralyzed, whether it is one of his legs or one of his arms. However, if one hernia disappears from its place, it often becomes reducible.
And its disappearance can be in four directions: the one that disappears to the back is called a lumbar hernia. As for its treatment, observe: if the lumbar hernia has occurred from obesity, there is no treatment for it and there is no recovery from it. But if it has occurred due to a fall or blow and the like...
I have mentioned its treatments in various ways, with long discussions that do not provide much benefit. I have summarized the essential parts from them, which convey the intended meaning and clarify it, unlike what was presented before and explained.
I say that the lumbar hernia that occurs in the abdomen has no remedy and there is no recovery from it, as well as those occurring in two directions. Only the one that occurs in the back can be treated, specifically what I am describing, which is that the patient lies on their side.
On a wooden frame placed near the wall, and spread under it a damp canvas so that his chest is not injured; then place a vertical piece of wood sunk in a hole in the ground on one side of the frame near his head, and another piece on the other side of the frame towards his feet.
Another servant holds the other piece, and it should not be fixed in the hole; another servant holds that one in the same way, then they place it on the patient's chest and tie it beneath with soft, strong rope, and extend the end of the rope to the piece near his head and tie it there.
Then they bind the other end of the rope over his wrists, and over his ankles, and at the level of his knees; then gather all the ropes together and tie them to the other piece of wood near his feet; then each servant extends towards their respective piece of wood with the rope, and the two pieces of wood do not move from their fixed positions.
Except that they are not fixed as we have said, and the physician places his hand on the rope with strength until it returns, or he places a board on it; then he stands on the board with his feet until it returns. If this treatment does not return [the hernia], take a board whose length is about three cubits.
"Drill in the wall that we said should be near the patient, a place through which the end of the board can pass. Then place the middle of the board on the hump and put his feet on the other end and press firmly until the hernia swells.
"And return it to its place, and if you wish, you can make it with the rope that is twisted by hand, which is to dig in the ground near the patient's head at the end of the bed two pieces of wood, each one arm's length long; and at his feet at the other end of the bed as well, two pieces of wood.
"And let there be a space of one finger's width between each piece of wood, and in each piece of wood make a hole into which the rope is threaded; secure all the pieces of wood firmly in the ground so that the bed does not move, and insert a rolled-up staff, which is the rope twisted around itself, through the holes in the two pieces of wood.
"And at its end, make a hole in which to secure a staff of one finger's length around which the rope is twisted; and do the same for the other two pieces of wood. Then tie the rope that you have tied around the patient's chest to the rope near his head, and the ropes that you have tied around his legs to the rope near his feet.
Then he stands by each nipple, a servant unfolds his hand with the unfolder that wraps around the nipple, and the doctor levels the hump as we mentioned, and this is an image of the nipple, the turner, and the patient.
Then, after the incision is closed and the place becomes level, it is necessary to apply a dry dressing with egg white, then a compress, and on top of the compress place a splint made of board whose width should be three fingers or thereabouts, and its length should be as much as the hump's location.
And on some of the correct sutures, then he ties with the necessary bandage, and the patient should eat soft food until recovery. If there is some swelling in the place at the end of the healing process, it is necessary to use medicines that soothe and soften along with using the board we described for a long time.
And in this, a lead plate may be used. Sometimes there is swelling at the end of the back sutures, and it is thought to be pulled out, which would be excess bone that has protruded; do not expose it with this treatment, as it could cause death.
Chapter Thirty-One.
In the treatment of the fractured ulna.
Know that the joint of the ulna and humerus is only subject to dislocation, not to any of the other conditions that affect the rest of the joints such as slight displacement and subluxation. The ulna can dislocate in four directions.
For it dislocates inward, outward, forward, and backward. It is most common for it to dislocate inward, and less so forward or backward. The sign of its inward dislocation is that if you measure the leg of the patient with a straight edge, it will be longer.
The ankle will be more prominent than normal, and the patient will not be able to bend his leg at the knee. The place above the knee will appear sunken and hollow, indicating that the head of the femur has moved there.
The sign of one whose dislocation is outward is that his symptoms are opposite to these symptoms. The sign of one whose dislocation is forward is that he extends his leg completely, except he cannot bend it without pain in the ankle. Even if he tries to walk, he will not be able to do so forward.
He retains his urine and his thigh becomes paralyzed, and when he walks, he drags his foot, and the sign of this is that he cannot extend his knee or bend it before bending the thigh, and his leg is also shorter than the other.
The thigh is relaxed and the top of the thigh, at the place of the kneecap, is protruding. As for treating this type of paralysis, it is that if the paralysis has been long-standing and its owner has become accustomed to it and has not attempted to treat it, then there is no benefit in treating it.
It is not advisable to expose him to it, and as for the one whose paralysis is recent, whether it is any of the four types of paralysis, hasten to make the joint move inward and outward, and move it gently from right to left, often.
He recovered without needing any other treatment. If he did not recover in this manner, it is necessary to have a strong servant support his leg from below, either with his hands or with ropes tied above the knee, and another servant supporting him from above.
He inserts his hands from below the sheet, then presses with soft cloths on the base of the thigh and another servant holds onto the ends of the cloths, one-third from either the front side towards the back or from behind towards the side.
And all of them lift at once until the patient is raised from the ground and remains suspended, for this type of lifting is common to the four types. If the fracture returns as we said, then each type requires its own specific treatment.
If the fracture is internal, the patient should be placed on his sound side and cloths are laid over the base of the thigh between the head of the thigh and the place under the navel.
Then the strap is extended from above, from the front to the highest part of the body towards the back. Another strong servant supports with his arms and embraces the warm place on the afflicted thigh and extends strongly outward, for it returns to its place.
And this type is easier than the rest for which the return of this limb occurs, so if it proves difficult and you cannot use this type of treatment, then all of the patient's legs should be bound with a strong, soft bandage on both heels and ankles.
And after each of its possessors, the measure is four fingers, and the afflicted leg extends more than the other by two fingers, then attach the afflicted one to the head with a wooden board that is in the house, and there is a distance from the ground of two forearms.
Then command a strong young man to embrace the thigh of the head and another young man to hold onto the afflicted one, and let the other young man who is embracing the thigh push with strength, for the separation returns to its place quickly, but if it is dislocation, then the return is specific if it is outside.
It is necessary for the afflicted to lie on the bench as we have described with the hip, and tighten the band around his afflicted leg and chest, then place one board at his feet and the other at his head, then place an additional board in the middle of the bench, very firmly.
A wet bandage is wrapped around it, so that the board between his thighs does not hurt him and cause him to slide down during the extension, then each servant extends towards his direction, and the doctor straightens the bandage with his hands, for if it responds to the return.
And if not, place a board on him and press it as mentioned in the lancet section, except that the patient should be lying on his healthy side. If the amputation is to the front, then the patient's leg should be extended once while he is in this position, with his face towards the carpenter.
The physician places the palm of his right hand on the patient's arm, then presses it with the other hand, and with that, he extends the pressure downward to the knee area. If the amputation is at the back, the patient should not extend forward.
And he should be raised off the ground, not lying flat, but rather placed on a solid object. His flank and shoulder should be turned outward according to his position in relation to the carpenter, while facing him, with the bindings tightened.
As we have said, it is necessary to use the board also on the place from which the joint has come out. And if the joint of the thigh returns as it should and the sign of its return does not escape you, then the patient's leg is extended.
When you see them level and the patient can flex and extend the leg without difficulty, know that the limb has returned to its proper place. At this point, straighten the thighs, lift the shin, and bind it with a bandage that does not move in any direction.
The patient must rest for three or four days, then remove the bandage and splint. If you see that both legs are equal in length, know that the fracture has healed. Allow the patient to walk; if there is any pain, do not let them walk.
Then go back and bandage it again as you did the first time, leaving it for another three days before removing the bandage. He will walk on it gradually until he is fully recovered, God willing.
Chapter Two and Thirty-three.
In the Treatment of Fractures of the Leg.
The leg fractures in three directions: it may fracture towards the inside, towards the outside, or downwards, which means towards the back of the leg. It does not fracture forward towards the foot. A sign of its fracture is that the patient will press their leg against their thigh.
If it does not adhere to the thigh, know that the leg is fractured. All directions of its fracture require the patient to sit with their leg extended if they can do so. A servant should sit behind him to hold his waist and lean him slightly backwards before you sit on his thigh.
You attach his back to your face and place his leg between your legs, then you clasp his ankle with your hands and entwine them around his ankle between your fingers, then you press his ankle firmly with your hand, and another servant supports his foot until the ankle returns to its place.
The sign of its return is that the shin adheres to the thigh without coercion, then you straighten it and attach the shin to the thigh, then tie them together with a three- or four-day bandage, then release them, and only use minimal walking for several days until it strengthens.
If you find it difficult to return it as described, then use the strong bandages for support as previously described for treating dislocations until it returns.
Chapter Thirty-Three.
In the treatment of knee dislocation.
The knee may dislocate slightly or completely. Its dislocation can be either inward or outward. The sign of its dislocation is that you see the knee swollen prominently towards the direction it has dislocated to.
As for the treatment of its partial dislocation, it is easy to return it by supporting it with hands and straightening until it returns. But if it dislocates completely, it is necessary for the patient to sit, and a strong servant supports him from behind his back in the middle.
Then you hold with your right hand the top of his foot, and with your left hand from below his foot in the place of the ankle. Then pull the foot towards you with your right hand, then with your left hand twice, then extend it with your left hand and push the sole of the foot with your right hand towards the leg gently.
Do that twice as described, then in the third time push the sole of the foot to the leg while you are pulling by the ankle. If it returns one or two times in this way and you see the foot is level, otherwise repeat the work on it for it will return.
If you are unable to make it return as described, then have the patient lie on his back on the ground, and dig a hole in the ground that is very stable so that it falls between his thighs, and wrap a cloth around him so that the patient is not harmed, then an attendant holds his thigh.
Then another attendant extends the patient's leg, either with his hands or with a rope tied around the patient's neck. Then each attendant extends in the opposite direction of the one holding him, and the assistant stands between the patient's thighs holding it so that his body is not pulled down during extension. Then the physician straightens the dislocation with his hands.
The other servant should hold the healthy leg down, for the dislocation returns quickly. If the dislocation returns and its health is evident to you, then carry a wedge and pincers and tighten it with ropes and strong cords, and bind the foot with the rope below, and beware of the nerve that is above the heel from behind.
Lest the binding be too tight and hurt him, then leave it for two or three days. If the swelling subsides, tighten it again, then release it on the third or fourth day, and the patient should abstain from walking for forty days.
For if he walks before this period, it is not certain that the dislocation will not relapse and be ruined, nor will any treatment be accepted after that. If there is a hot swelling, what we have described for soothing should be used in its place in the treatment and the bandage until it subsides.
Chapter Forty-Three
In the treatment of dislocations of the toes.
It is necessary to straighten what has been dislocated from it with a slight degree, without force, and this is not difficult but easy. If the dislocation is in one of the knuckles at the back of the foot, the patient should place his foot on a level spot on the ground.
He stood on a board as if walking, then you place your foot on what remains of those ligaments, and then step on it with force until you see it return and become straight, without any sign of instability.
Then place a board under the sole of his foot, which takes in all the foot and has two ends. Tie it tightly and firmly for three days, then remove it and keep him from walking for many days until the strength returns and the safety is assured, God willing.
Chapter Fifty-Three.
On the types of fractures that occur with wounds or with breaks, or both together.
When this happens and its treatment is delayed and forced, it often leads to death.
Therefore, it is not appropriate to proceed with such a treatment except by one who is skilled in the art, long-experienced, delicate, compassionate, cautious, not impetuous or hasty, and using, at the beginning, only those medicines that calm hot inflammations, and then hand over the patient.  ​
"By the power of God, except for what I hope will be safe from illness with light disease and a little hope is seen in it, remove it quickly from you in the first moments before the hot inflammation occurs.
If the limb returns to its desired position, use the cautery that settles the hot inflammation and treat the wound with dried poultices. If there is a fracture and splinters in the bone, remove them by scraping. And he acted accordingly to what we mentioned earlier in simple diseases, as will be discussed later in their respective places.
Be diligent and purify your soul from entering the path of deception, as I have advised you earlier. This way, you will remain loyal to me and submit to my guidance, God willing.
