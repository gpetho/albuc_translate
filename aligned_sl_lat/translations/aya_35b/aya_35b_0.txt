After I have completed for you, O sons, this book which is the last of the sciences of medicine with its complement, and have come to an end in it through expositions and declarations, it seemed good to me that I should complete it for you with this Tractate which is a part of operation, that is, surgery by hand.
For since operation by hand is prostrate in our region and altogether private in our time until perhaps its science has been lost and its trail blazed, and nothing remains of it but small descriptions in the books of the ancients which have been altered by hands, and error and hesitancy have befallen them until their intentions are sealed and their vision prolonged. It seemed good to me that I should revive it with the arrangement of this Tractate according to the way of exposition, declaration and abbreviation, and that I should come to it with the forms of cautery tools and other instruments of work with an addition from declaration and its necessity.
And the cause why a good craftsman of it is not found with his hand in this our time, is because the art of medicine is long and its author must exercise himself before that in the science of anatomy which Galen narrated until he knows the joints of the members and their forms, and their connection and separation, and have knowledge of the bones and nerves and sinews and number them and know their exit and the pulsing of blood vessels.
And because of that Hippocrates said that the name with the name is much and with work it is little and especially in the art of the hand.Et quia multum mihi placet, quod Galenus in libro suo de anatomia, et alibi saepe dixit, ut medicus non debet esse artifex operis cum manu, neque debet mederi omnia: sed illud est optabile, ut sit ueterinarius, qui curat omnia.
We have already spoken of him in the introduction to this book.
For he who is not learned in anatomy, as we have said, will not be able to operate without falling into error and killing his patients; just as I have seen many of those who profess this science, and boast of it without knowledge or experience.
This is because I saw a stupid doctor following a scrofulous swelling on a woman's neck and cutting certain arteries in the neck; so that the woman's blood flowed until she fell dead in his hands.
And I saw another doctor who presumed to extract a stone from a man which had grown with age; and the stone was large.
So he came to him, and extracted it with a knife.
And so the man died on the third day.Et multas alias inuenta et uaria medicorum stultitia, qui non habent experientiam in scientia anatomiae.
And indeed I myself had already been called to extract it; and seeing the size of the stone and the condition of the patient, I knew he would die.Et dixi medicis ista uerba:
And I said to the doctors these words: "And I saw another doctor who was receiving a bribe from one of our dukes for medicine; and it happened to a black eunuch who was with him, that he had a fracture in his thigh near the ankle. And the doctor with his ignorance came quickly, and bound the fracture over the wound with poultices and strong bandages tightly, and did not allow breathing space to the wound.
Then he discharged him according to his desires.Postea autem per tres dies uenit ad me: et dixi medicis ista uerba, qui posuerant astellas super fracturam:
Afterwards he came to me on the third day; and I said to the doctors who had put bandages over the fracture:  "Then he left him for a few days, and commanded that the bandage should not be loosened; and he was thus until it became infected in his leg and foot, and he came to destruction.
I was called to him therefore; and I came quickly to loosen the bandage; and then followed quietness, and he escaped his pains.Et multas alias uidi medicorum ignorantia stultitiebus: qui tamen magnam habent famam apud homines qui non sciunt nisi solum medendi speciem.
However, the gangrene had already set in on the limb; and I could not check it.
So the gangrene stopped wandering in the limb until it perished.
And I saw another physician who punctured a malignant ulcer; and it festered for days until the evil of it was magnified with its lord.
Which is, because when there is a cancer pure of the melancholic humour, then one must not pierce it with iron altogether, unless it be in a limb that can endure it, so that all of it may be cut off.Quod autem est ex humore sanguini, et sanguis non currit, sed suppurat, ut antea diximus: hanc oportet ut perueniatur cum ferro ad mortem mali, quia non potest aliter curari.
But because it is of the sanguine humour, and blood does not run but suppurates, as we said before; this one must pierce with iron to the death of the evil, for it cannot be cured otherwise.And because of that, O Sons, you need to know that surgery is divided into two parts by hand: namely, surgery which is associated with safety, and surgery with which there is danger in many dispositions.Quam primam operationem, quae est cum saluate associata, oportet, ut faciat medicus per se, scilicet non per alium. The first operation, which is associated with safety, the physician should do by himself, not through someone else.And I have already awoken in every place of this book where surgery comes, in which there is fear and terror.Et tamen uobis dico: Si in omni operacione non potest medicus facere per se, sed necesse est ut faciat per alium, quod facit per se; nam non debet remuersi a hoc, sed debet procedere cum prudentia et timore Dei.
And yet I tell you: If the physician cannot do every operation by himself, but must do it through another, what he does to himself; for he ought not to turn away from this, but he ought to proceed with prudence and fear of God.Therefore, you need to beware of this, and forsake it: so that stupid people may not find a way to speak, and dishonour you.
Take therefore your measure with solicitude and protection, and your sick with facility and firmness, and use a better way leading to grace of God to health and praiseworthy succession: and forsake terrible sicknesses of difficult healing; and lift up your souls from that which makes you fear, so that hesitancy may enter into you in faith and benefit. It remains that your glory is greater and more sublime in this world, and finally in your quantities.
Galen has indeed already said in some of his admonitions. You will not heal the sick; so that you are not called bad physicians.

Part I.
Of cauterization and harm it may cause; what complexion it suits and in what time; whether with iron or gold.
Chapter 1.
But before I remind the operation with it, it is necessary that I say the quality of its cauteries and its harms; and in what complexion it is displayed.
I therefore say that the speech about the quality of cauterization and its harm is a prolonged speech and subtle, knowledge, and hidden secret.Et tamen, quoniam non possumus procedere nisi pro hac via, accipiamus qualitates Iuuamentorum Cauterii: et nocumenti eius.
And indeed many wise men have spoken about it, and they disagreed about it; and for me indeed I am satisfied with a little of their speeches, fearing prolongation.Quo igitur modo loquatur de iuamento cauterii?
In what way then shall he speak about cauterization?I therefore say that cauterization confers universally upon every complexion which is with matter and without matter: excepting two complexes which are the complex of heat without matter and the complex of dryness without matter.Sed quae sunt illae duae complexiones, quae non conferunt cum iuamento Cauterii?
But in complexions that are hot and dry they disagree with the matter.
Some have said indeed that cautery is useful in it.
And others have said the contrary of this, namely that cautery is not fitting for a disease which is from heat and dryness; for the nature of fire is heat; and it is unfitting that one should be healed from a disease hot and dry by something hot and dry.
And he who says the contrary of this says that cautery is useful for a remedy in any hot and dry disease which has befallen the bodies of men; because when you compare the body of man and its moisture to the nature of fire, you will find the body of man cold.
And indeed I say this from his words; for experience has already shown me that several times.Et sicut caliditas in se omnia iuuat, sic etiam cauteria in se omnia iuuat.
However, he must not undertake this unless he has already been tested and trained in the latest cautery exercise chapter and knows the different complexions of men and the disposition of diseases within themselves and their causes and the accidents of them and their time span.
You need not fear, however, about other complexions; especially those involving cold and moist diseases. All physicians are indeed agreed on these, and they have not disagreed with cautery when used for them.
And you shall know sons, that from the secret cure by cautery with fire and its goodness is above cautery with medicine burning, because fire is simple whose action does not pass except to the member which is cauterized; and it does no harm to a member joined with it unless by slight harm.
However, the action of medicine burning reaches to that which is drawn out from members, and perhaps it causes disease in the member difficult for healing, and perhaps it kills.
But because of its subtlety and goodness of its substance, fire does not do that unless it goes to excess.Quare si in eis quae superant per Cauterium cum medicina comburente uideretis, quod fuit ab omni medicina debita periculum, et periculum mortis praecipue, facite cauterium cum igne solum.
I have indeed found this to be the case from my experience over so many years of practice and study of the art, and from standing by and observing the truth of things; therefore I excuse myself for being prolix in speech.
And know ye sons that they disagree about the time when cauterization should be performed, and they put forward a better time to prove their truth.
And I say that cauterization is suited at any time; for the accidental damage due to time is submerged in the oath which is taken with the cautery.
And especially if cauterization is for pains from necessary, strong, hasty pains which do not tolerate delay; because one fears greater wickedness might occur than a little damage from waiting for the right time.
And do not let this fall into your minds, o sons, that which common and foolish physicians think, namely that the disease healed by cauterization does not always return; and they put forward consequences and it is not as they think: for cauterization is not, unless in place of medicine, which alters complexion and dries out humidities which are causes, because pains occur.
Nevertheless cauterization is superior to medicine by the swiftness of its strength and the power of its action and the vehemence of its lordship; and it is possible for disease to return at some time according to the complexion of the sick person and the location of the disease and its strength: and that which is prepared in his body from accumulation of superfluitates in him, and that which reaches him in his acquisition from foods, and similar causes, unless there is a disease in which cauterization is administered. It is possible for a subtle disease of the limb from few superfluities and humors, such as a tooth extraction, because of pain, and its like, that this pain not return.
But it happens in few cases.
Indeed the common speech that cautery is the last medicine, is right speech not according to what they mean by it. For they believe there is no cure that works with medicine or any other after cauterization has ceased.
But the reality is the opposite of their claim; and the reason why cautery is the last medicine is not that when we apply methods of curing for some diseases, and they do not work; then at the end we use cauterization, and it works; thus from this it follows that cautery is the last medicine, not according to what the common people and many foolish doctors understand.
The ancients also said that cautery with gold is better than cauterization with iron; and they did not say this unless for the equality of gold and the subtlety of its substance: and they said that it does not cause pus in the site of cauterization. But this is not true absolutely; for I have already proved it and found that cautery does not cause pus in some bodies without other causes.
And cauterization with itself is good, and better than with iron as they said.
However when you cauterize with gold it does not appear to you, when it burns according to the amount that you wish due to the redness of gold; and if you add fire to it, it melts into fire and turns into thin sheets.And cautery with itself is good, and better than with iron as they said.But when you cauterize with gold by fire, its redness does not appear to you, when it burns according to the amount that you wish; and if you add fire to it, it melts and turns into a liquid in the fire.
Therefore the artificer falls from that into practice; and because of this cautery with iron is faster and closer to us, from rectitude into action.And cauterization with itself is good, and better than with iron as they said.But when you cauterize with gold by fire, its redness does not appear to you, when it burns according to the amount that you wish; and if you add fire to it, it melts and turns into a liquid in the fire.Therefore the artificer falls from that into practice; and because of this cautery with iron is faster and closer to us, from rectitude into action.
And I have indeed already arranged this Chapter in cautery, according to the chapters: and I have arranged them from head to foot, that he who searches may find from it what he will. On the way of cauterizing the Head in the Coronal Suture.
Chapter 2.
It confers cauterization to the dominion of moisture and coldness over the brain; which two are causes of a flow of humors from the head into the parts of the eyes and ears, and of multitude of sleep, and of pain of teeth, and of pain in the throat; and universally of all sickness, which happens from coldness, as paralysis, and of soddeness, epilepsy, and apoplexy, and similar to these of sicknesses.
The way of cauterization is, that you give order to the infirm: that he may be evacuated in the first place with a cleansing medicine of solution for the head three nights, or four, according to as the strength of the infirm requires, and his age, and custom of him. Et postea tege caput cum oleo, et applica super crucem cauterium, quod praecipio tibi in capitulo de cruentijs.
Then tell him to make his head a point with the razor.
Then have him sit between your hands square, so that he has already placed his hands on his chest.
Then place the root of your palm on the root of his nose between his eyes. Wherever therefore your middle finger comes to, mark that place with the stigmatiser. Then light cautery fire of olive oil: whose shape this is. Then put it on the marked place with the stigmatiser, descending, as your hand gradually tightens and you wind him up.
Then lift your hand quickly, and look at the spot.
What if you see now is peeled from the bone amount of head or amount of zayherbi, then lift your hand.Deinde de novo pona digitum medium super locum illum.
And if not, renew your hand with the same iron, or with another from him if he is cooled down: until you see the bones that I told you.
Then take something of salt, and dissolve it in water, and moisten with it the patch, and leave it for three days.Deinde trahe digitum medium tuum, et fac ut non perueniant alibi digiti, sed quod uellet caput.
Then put on the patch moistened with butter, and leave it over the spot, until the fire scab is destroyed.Deinde cum salte et aqua purgetur: et super locum stetit cotum, fac ut pono super locum. Then cleanse it with salt and water: and let the patch stand over the spot, do so I put on the spot.Then care for it with ointment tetrapharmacon, until it heals.
I have already said that the more open wound remains, pus is discharged: therefore it is better and more easy to cure.Quod si in aliquo loco percutiat, ut non possit percutere alibi: tunc debet faciendi quod dictum est tibi.
And some of them said that the skin should be cauterized all the way to the bone; and the cautery should be held in place until something of the thickness of the bone has been burned away.
Then it is scraped after that which has been burned from the bone, then it is healed.
And others say that the cautery should reach to the very end, until it marks on the bone a print so deep that the bone falls down as if it had been cut with a chisel or a tool which women use when they apply kohl; and they think that vapours from the head escape through this opening and the wound is left open for a long time.
Then it is healed until it is consolidated.
But to me these two kinds of cautery seem absolutely unsuitable for any kind of men except those who are afraid.
And it is better in my opinion to let him go away with his health.
For the head is weakened by the removal of its natural continuity; as we have witnessed in other limbs, and especially when the patient's head is naturally weak by nature; and indeed the first kind of cautery is safer and better in my opinion, which I use to operate with it for the sake of health.
¶ On the method of cauterizing the head in the case of a headache affecting the whole head.Quemadmodum autem cauteria faciunt, quod est faciendo etiam cum cauterio caput: sed non debet esse faciens cauteria per omnes partes capitis, ut suprascribimus, sed debet operari primum in medio capite, ubi est nervus medianus.
Now as for the cauterization of the head when it is painful all over.In performing a cautery on the head, you must not cauterize all parts of the head, as described above; you must operate first in the middle of the head where the median nerve is located.CHAPTER 3
When there is a chronic headache and it persists on the patient, and he uses hellebore, and cocklebur, and head-cleansing, and oils, and fomentation.Et si non recedat, tunc debet facere cauteria, quoniam multum est bonum Cauterium.
And especially if it has already been cauterized with a single cautery, which we have described, and does not bring about any improvement for him: then consider.
For if the head of the sick person is of a strong constitution by nature, and not weak, and finds the cold painful: then cauterize with another cautery under that one a little.
Then cauterize him over all the horns of his head with the cautery, so that it does not penetrate the skin, and a small amount is uncovered from the bone, as we have described.
And cauterize him with a single cautery on the occipital of his head, in the place that is called the "vas," and it is the place in which the blood vessels are placed: and raise your cautery to this, and do not uncover the bone.
For the sick person finds because of that a vehemnt pain, and different from the pain of all the other cauteries of his head.
And I say that this cautery is in its place; and it is appropriate that it be the cautery with which the horns of the head are cauterized, and his occiput more subtly with a cautery with which the middle of the head is cauterized.Et postea qui habet dolorem et uenam, et ex hoc non est in illo dolore: et per totum diem non eleuat matum suam super eum, nisi necessitas ei faciat.
And this is its form.
On cautery for headache, using hot medicine or iron.
CHAPTER 4.
When there is a headache and the pain extends to the eye, or comes out with cleansing medicines, then the rest of the treatment which I mentioned above, under sections on diseases not helping, cautery must be performed in two ways, either with burning hot medicine, or with iron. But cautery with burning hot medicine is to take a tooth of another person, strip the bark off it and cut its ends off on both sides.Et haec est forma eius.
Then cut the place of pain with a broad bloodletting instrument until it comes to just under the skin where the tooth is caught.Et haec est forma eius.
Then insert the tooth under the skin where it is hidden: then bind above it with decent compression and leave for fifteen hours; then loosen it, and extract the other one and leave them for two or three days; then put a bandage over it soaking in butter until pus is formed: then treat it with ointment until it heals.Et haec est forma eius.
And if you want to do it with some burning medicines which I wrote about in the 12th treatise, of Burning Medicines.Et haec est forma eius.
The cauterization of it with iron is in this way.
Cautery with fire, whose form is as follows.
And it is named Claw: because the form of its head is like that of a claw, there being something curved in it, and in the middle of it is some small protuberance.
Then place it on the spot, and hold your hand steady; and gradually turn up the iron with speed, and let the amount that is burnt be according to the thickness of the skin, as its middle.
And raise your hand so that the artery which is below may not be burnt and there be a flow of blood.
Then soak the cloth in salt water and place it over the wound for three days; then put a poultice with butter on the wound; lastly, treat with ointment until it is healed. And if you wish, cauterize this half-scalp with the second end of the dagger-point of cautery.
And beware about cutting into the artery in this half-scalp which is not the old one properly speaking.Quamvis enim arteria, quae adscinditur per uirginem prima, in hanc partem hemicraniae, qua non est uirgo propria, si caute non incideatur, multum sanguinis exuit, et periculosa uel uti mortua est.
For the artery which is cut through the virgin part of the scalp into this part of the half-scalp where it is not the virgin one, if not cautiously cut, much blood is lost and is dangerous or even deadly.¶ Of the mode of cauterizing in the old half-scalp.
Head 5.
When you are treating the half-scalp, inasmuch as we have said out of the preceding cure and what we have said in the divisions of diseases, and if the cure does not confer relief: and you see out of the sickness that it is not sufficient for him that we say out of the first cautery with medicine or out of the cautery with fire, then you ought to use a cauterizing dagger, until it becomes white after you mark over the place of pain with a line whose length is half a digit, or almost that. However, you must take care to avoid the jaw, which moves during chewing, or the nerve that moves it, lest a spasm occur.
And pay attention to the bleeding of the artery that was cut.
For there is fear in cutting it, especially for one who does not know what he is doing and is inexperienced and incompetent; and he leaves the procedure with that first.
And I will come with the reminder of the bleeding of the artery according to its way and in its place in this book.
If you see from the disease that this cautery is not sufficient for him, and you see the sick body tolerating cautery in the middle of his head, as we related, treat the wound until it heals.Quod si per accidens cadunt ossa de caeteris locis super faciem, uel maxillae, vel super arcadas, vel super nasum, vel super oculum, vel super latus faciei; vel si per accidentem cadit os super oram superiorem labris, et cadit super oram inferiorem:
And if you see, administer the cautery, which we said in the chapter on the extraction of the artery with cautery having two knives.
For cauterization is better for this and more beneficial.Et si uides ossa cadere in locum, qui non est utilitas Cauterio: ¶ On the way of cauterizing in pain of ears.Ego dixi tibi de modo cauterizandi in dolore aurium: quod si uides dolorem esse ad modum phlegmatis, qui est in oribus et in maxillis, et in arcadibus, et non est in aere faciei:
Head VI.Ego dixi tibi de modo cauterizandi in dolore aurium: which if you see the pain being to the manner of phlegm, which is in the gums and in the jaws, and in the arches, and not in the air of the face:et si uides dolorem esse ad modum anginis, qui ex plerunque cause, ut diximus, procedit: And if you see the pain being to the manner of anginites, which from most causes, as we said, proceeds:When pain happens in the ear from coldness, and is cured with solutius, and other cure that we said in division, and pain is not removed, then burn cautery: and that one is what is called Punctum, whose form is this.Et si dolor non est in oribus, sed in arcadibus et in aere faciei, quod nominatur dolorem anginis, quoniam procedit de maxillis et de arcadibus per aerem faciei:
Then after it has been cauterized, make pricks around the whole ear as you have been taught; or around both if there is pain in both ears at the same time.
Then make a small cut with the cautery from the root of the ear after you have marked the spots with a hot iron; and see to it that there are about ten pricks on each side of the ear, and not more.
Then heal up these cuts until they are well.
Of the manner of cauterizing for torture.
Chapter 7.
Torture which is treated with cautery is not of any account, as we said above when dealing with diseases by kind. And cauterization that comes from the nature of phlegm, and from drying up and tension of nerve.
When you treat this kind of torture with hellebore and head-purges, and gargles, and your treatment does not avail to effect a cure, then you must cauterize the sick man in three places: in one place at the root of his ear, in another place a little below the drum, and in the third place where there is a joining of the two lips.
And put your cautery on the opposite side of the sick part.
For softening does not take place unless it be in that part which appears to be healthy.
And the manner of cauterizing is that you cauterize with your cautery tool directly at the upper end of the ear, beneath the temple near the top of the head a little; and you must cauterize in the timpani: whose length is according to the length of your thumb.
And take away your hand with the cautery tool until half the thickness of the skin has been burned.
And this is the manner of cautery; and it is of bronze, whose form has been described above; but its edge must not be too sharp, as you see, but there should be a little roughness on the edge.Et debet esse cultellus, si necessitas accidit, ut possit excidere et carnem ad radicem, quod est in parte supremi temporis. Then treat the wounds, with that which went before: until they are healed.
On cautery for old apoplexy.
Chapter 8.
When apoplexy becomes old, and you have treated it as we have said, and your treatment does not work, and the patient does not have a fever, then cauterize him with four cauteries over each horn of his head, and with one cautery in the middle of his head as we have said before, and with one cautery on the back of his head, according to what was said. And the size of the cautery should be according to what was said.
He is also cauterized with a cautery on the bone of his stomach; and that is more final.
Then it is treated with what went before.
On cautery for oblivion.Antiquum est, et novum: sed non proficit multum:
Chapter 9.
First in a drink, there must be given the leaf of the great hellebore, and the purifying pills for the brain.
Then shave the head of the sick person all over; and place on his nape the plaster made with sesame seeds as described in the book on plasters, and apply it frequently. For that is the manner of cauterisation; and make this according to the same order as I said there. If therefore he is healed by that, it is good.Si autem non, fac eum pedes lavare cum aqua calida, et pone super pedes illius unguentum de ligno aloës, ut dixi antea: et fac illum ambulare pedes nudos super lacum calidum.
If not, let him wash his feet with hot water, and place on his feet the ointment of aloe wood as I said before, and let him walk bare-foot over a hot bath. If not, then make three cauterisations for him in the back part of his head, which run from the upper part of the head to the lower part of the eye; and between each cauterisation place a finger's thickness.
Then heal the cautery with that with which it was preceded.Et postea fac super eum emplastrum de rose, et de cerussis, et de ligno aloës, et de lino.
Then after that make over him the plaster of rose and chalk, and aloe wood, and flax. If however you wish to add anything more, and the sick person can bear it, then cauterise him in the middle.Et postea fac super eum emplastrum de synapi, et de lino, et de cerussis, et de rose.
If you wish an addition: then cauterize it over the two horns.
Then heal it until it is cured: let the cautery be olive oil according to the shape that was prescribed.
¶ Of the manner of cauterizing in Paralysis and softening.
Chapter X.
It is necessary to proceed with cleansing the head with hyssop, and with what we have said above.Et postea facies unctionem olei ad caput: et per omnes noctes in locis ubi est necessitas: et laveres omnes osse quae sunt super capitis cum oleo, donec omnia sanentur.
Then anoint the head with oil, and do this every night as long as necessary; and wash all the bones of the head with oil until everything is healed. Then shave the head of the sick person: then cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head, and with a cautery over each horn of the head, and with a cautery over its back, and three cauteries on each of the neck vertebrae.Et postea cum oleo ollere spondiles eorum usque ad cor: et postea clysteris caput, et omnia laves oleo quod praemiserit.
And then anoint the vertebrae with oil all the way to the heart: and then clysterize the head, and wash everything with the oil that you have prescribed. But if in this disease of softening of the body there are many more of them, and the sick person can tolerate it, and the illness is strong: then cauterize him with four cauteries over the vertebrae of the back, and with the last cautery burn as much of his skin as possible, and raise your hand.Et si postea intra quattuor dies non curat se: facias sibi plura cauteria super spondiles dorsi, et in medio eius donec comburatur ex cute plurimum eius, et eleua manum tuam.
Then treat it until it heals, and so with cautery with olive oil.
¶ How to cauterize in epilepsy.
Chapter 11.De cauteriis diversibus.
The epileptic is not cauterized unless he whose epilepsy is from phlegm. Therefore the brain of such a person must be cleansed first with hyssop and with the other remedies we mentioned earlier about division; when the illness is great or he is bearing up under the medication.
But if he's a child who cannot endure medicines, then let him be given a gargle and purifying chewing remedies to cleanse the brain, before that for many days with the good food.
Then shave his head; afterwards let him be cauterized with one cautery in the middle of his head according to what was said before about its mode and with another cautery on his occipital and above every horn of his head.
If the patient is strong and enduring, then let him be cauterized with those cauteries that I said about the one who has paralysis and softening of his body over the vertebrae of the neck, and of the back; and let the cautery be olive oil according to the mode that was mentioned. But if he's a child, then put on a thin cautery according to this mode.Quod si post diem tertium, vel quartum, post illum, superiuenit: et non curat, sed est in eadem conditione, vel peius, tunc ponitur sub capite eius, et super omne cornu capitis cauterium oliuare subtile.
Of the way of cauterizing in Melancholy.
Chapter 12.
When the cause of melancholy is corrupt humors and thick phlegm, then cauterize it with the cauteries which we said to be used for him that hath a paralysis.
And if the cause of melancholy is the superfluity of the declining to melancholy and the body of the sick person is moistened, then give him to drink that which cleanses his brain, according to what was said in the division: then grind the head of the sick person, and make a bandage of linen, well made as a circle.And lay this bandage upon the head of the sick person, and apply thereto a hot cautery until he be scalded, and let him have another cautery also about the nape.
Then place it in the middle of his head, and the sick person sitting square must be held on every side.Et si cadat ad unum latus, ponito super eum ponderem in latere opposto, donec redderit se ad quadraturam: et iterum cauterizat caput cum cauteriis.
Then apply the ointment. And it is more worthy of ancient mutton butter.
And heat it over a fire moderate heat, as much as the finger can tolerate when it is inserted into it.
Then empty it in the middle of his head in a circle, and leave it until it cools down.
Do that to the invalid once every week with the rest of his good treatment, until he is healed.
Or if you wish, cauterize it by making many small punctures in it, except for the part that you hold with the cautery; let it smoke.
For this kind of cautery moistens the brain with its quality.
Then place on it a pad soaked in butter, or chicken fat.
¶ Of the way of cauterizing in descending water towards the eye.Et si non possit subire, velit illuc mittere oculus suus.
Chapter 13.
When it is clear to you from the signs which I mentioned earlier that there is an out-flow of water in the eye, then begin and give to the patient something that will cleanse his head.
And keep him away from all moisture, and let him sit in a bath for several days of fasting.
Then order him to shave his head, and cauterize it in the middle of his skull.Et si aqua non perierit, sed maneat intra oculum, quod non poterit tollere oculus suus, tunc trahe eam per lacrimas seseque lavet. Then cauterize the two eardrums with two cauteries, if there is a discharge of water from both eyes at the same time; or from one side only, if it is from one eye only: and cut off with the cautery all the veins and arteries that are under the skin. Let the cauteries be long enough to cover the width of the eardrum. And beware of bleeding.
If you see anything coming out of it, then cut it off immediately with whatever medicine is possible; and I will come with wisdom, which is in the extraction of arteries, and the cutting off of them, and cauterization against bleeding.
And when cauterized in the neck, under the two bones, let there be finally two cauteries produced.
Of the manner of cauterizing the tear-ducts.
Chapter 14.De modo trahere lachrymas ad nasum per punctura, et cauteria.
When the tear-ducts are old and constant; and are upon the veins and arteries which are in the exterior of the head, it is verified that this is from the superfluities of cold and phlegmatic humours: then cauterize with the same cautery as I narrated in the beginning about the discharge of water, a cautery in the middle of the head, and two cauteries upon the two eardrums, and two cauteries in the neck under the two bones.Et postea debuet trahere lachrymas ad nasum per puncturas quoque: et sic trahitur lachrima ad nasum, cum poma et cauteria sunt sub cutem impressa super uenas, et arterias.
And if you need to add something, then carefully cauterize it on both sides of the eye, above the eyebrow with a small cautery instrument.
A method for cauterization of a nose ulcer:
Chapter 15.
When you treat it with what we have said and the treatment does not work, then hurry and give three nights of enemas: then lightly scrape the head of it and cauterize it with a medium cautery instrument, with an oil cautery.
Then cauterize it with a nail cautery, two cauteries above the two eyebrows under the hair a little.Et si indiges additione, tunc cauteriza ipsum in omni latere caute oculi, super extremitatem supercilii cum cauterio paruo.
And if you need to add something, then carefully cauterize it on both sides of the eye, above the eyebrow with a small cautery instrument. And be careful not to cut an artery.
And this is the shape of the nail cautery.Figura cauteris clauialis
A method for cauterization on the softening of the eyelid:Caput XVI.
Chapter 16
When the eyelid is swollen from illness or moisture, then cauterize the eyelid with one cautery, with this lunar cautery.
And if you wish, cauterize the same above two eyebrows slightly with two cauteries on each side: and they will be elongated from two temples: and let the length of all cauteries, according to the lengths of the eyebrow: and do not touch your hand with the cautery, rather according to the quantity that is scorched in the third eyelid.
And this is the shape of the cautery according to this mode of lunar cautery.
§ On the mode of cauterizing the eyelid when hairs are ingrown and sting the eye. Chapter 17.
The cautery is in two modes, either cautery with fire or cautery with a burning medicine.First, let the cautery be done with fire in this way: take a cautery made of silver or lead, which are soft metals, and heat it in the fire until it glows, and apply it to the eyelid, and do not withdraw your hand from the cautery until you have cauterized all around the eyelid.
But with cautery with fire, instruct the patient beforehand to remove the hairs if he is one of those who remove them, until they are prolonged and evened out.And if the hairs are ingrown in the eyelid so that when you apply the cautery there is pain from them, then take a medicine which is called "mucilaginous liniment", and make the patient's eye water with it beforehand, so that when you cauterize the eye, you will not feel any pain. But if they sting him at their base: then constrict the patient' s eyes with a bandage so that they do not move until they are born.And when you see them in the eyelid, take a pair of tweezers and pull out each hair by itself.The cautery is also done with medicine in this way: take an iron needle and heat it in the fire and dip it in a medicine which burns and cauterizes, and when the iron is hot, apply it to the eyelid around the hairs until they are cauterized, and do not withdraw your hand from the cautery until you have cauterized all around the eyelid.
When they are born and evened out, then put the patient' s head in your lap, then make a sign on the eyelid of his eyes with encaustic, a sign that is according to the figure of a bay leaf: and let the beginning of the sign be near the hairs.And when he sees it, take a pair of tweezers and pull out each hair by itself.And when you have taken them all out, cauterize the place around the hair with a cautery made of silver or lead, so that no more hairs grow there.And if this cautery does not cure him, then do this: cut off his eyelashes on both sides up to his eyebrows with a pair of small scissors, and let the patient apply to his eyes for three days an ointment made from linseed oil and honey in equal parts, or from linseed oil and vinegar, or from linseed oil and milk, in equal parts.And when you have applied it for three days, then stop applying it so that they grow back.
Then put a poultice soaked in white of egg or in psyllium mucilage over the eye.
Then with fire brand, whose form is this.
Then brand over the figure which you have marked little by little with many turns, until the surface of the skin is burnt, which is as a fig leaf, all apparent proper.
And the sign of health of your work is: if you see the eyelid of the eye now contract, and hairs come out at the piercing of the eye.
Pull away then your hand then: and leave it for three days.Deinde si uelletur, faciuntur super oculum cotta olei roseo, aut mox omnium oleorum.
Then if it is peeled, they are made over the eye poultices of rose oil, or immediately of all oils.Then put over it a poultice with butter, until the eschar is eradicated.Deinde si eschara tota eradiatur, et facies omnia illa, quae dicta sunt: et dimitte cotum super oculum.
Then if the eschar is all eradicated, and do all those things which are said; and leave the poultice over the eye.Then heal it with ointment until it heals.
If hair comes back again after an hour, and the eyelid softens: then repeat cautery over that place, as you did at first.
But if there are hairs in the lower one: then brand it, until they come out to their natural place; and are equal so that the hairs do not sting the eye.
Of the mode of branding with medicine burning in the same case.
Chapter 18.De modo cauterizandi per se solum.
Let the sick person shave off his hair until it has grown again and has evened out.
Make a template out of cloth in the shape of a bay leaf.
Then take an ounce of well-known soap and an ounce each of unslaked lime; then grind them together well and knead the mixture to a good paste without cooling it down.
Then spread some of this over the template you have made in the shape of a bay leaf and place it over the eyelid of one or both eyes.
And place an egg white-soaked cotton ball under the eyelid, and have the patient's head on your lap.Fac ut infirmus non moveat oculum suum: sed statim post remedia, quae posui super palpebras oculorum: et post quaecunque aguntur cum cotis imbibitis in albumine oui, neque sine causa, aut per pauca verba.
Have the patient keep his eye still and not move it; but soon after applying the remedies to the eyelids, and also doing the same with the egg-white-soaked cotton balls (not for long, or with many words) place your index finger on top of the medicine and press gently.Fac ut infirmus non moveat oculum suum: sed statim post remedia, quae posui super palpebras oculorum: et post quaecunque aguntur cum cotis imbibitis in albumine oui, neque sine causa, aut per pauca verba.
Have the patient keep his eye still and not move it; but soon after applying the remedies to the eyelids, and also doing the same with the egg-white-soaked cotton balls (not for long, or with many words) move your finger around on top of the medicine whenever the patient feels its bite; because he finds this biting like fire.Fac ut infirmus non moveat oculum suum: sed statim post remedia, quae posui super palpebras oculorum: et post quaecunque aguntur cum cotis imbibitis in albumine oui, neque sine causa, aut per pauca verba.
Have the patient keep his eye still and not move it; but soon after applying the remedies to the eyelids, and also doing the same with the egg-white-soaked cotton balls  (not for long, or with many words) while the patient continues feeling that biting, then leave off the medicine, and move your finger over it.Fac ut infirmus non moveat oculum suum: sed statim post remedia, quae posui super palpebras oculorum: et post quaecunque aguntur cum cotis imbibitis in albumine oui, neque sine causa, aut per pauca verba.
Have the patient keep his eye still and not move it; but soon after applying the remedies to the eyelids, and also doing the same with the egg-white-soaked cotton balls   (not for long, or with many words) when the biting stops, then remove the medicine, and wash the eye with water.Fac ut infirmus non moveat oculum suum: sed statim post remedia, quae posui super palpebras oculorum: et post quaecunque aguntur cum cotis imbibitis in albumine oui, neque sine causa, aut per pauca verba.
And then consider, if you see the eyelid is swollen, as it is when there is swelling with fire, or with incision, it is good; and if not, then apply again over it from the medicine over the place where the medicine does not press, and does not blacken, until your work is even, and the eye is contracted.
Then put over it cotton with butter, until the burned skin is removed.
Then treat it with diaphanic ointment, or another, until it heals.
And it is necessary for you in the operation, that you beware of the last custodia, lest something from the medicine falls into the eye.
If the eyelid becomes soft after a few days and something from the eyelashes goes into the eye, then apply the medicine again over that place which is made soft from the eyelid itself, just as you did at first.Et si oculi post operationem non contrahuntur, sed mollificatur et dilabitur, quod est in palpebra super oculum, et non tollitur, tunc scito quod malus est in oculis, aut quod non habet palpebram bene, et fac eam eleuari cum medicinis.
Then care for him until he is healed.
And this is the shape of the myrtle leaf.
And you should know that men's eyes differ in size and shape.
Therefore, according to this, your consideration should be: and the way of righteousness should not be hidden from him who has a desire for this art.
¶ Of the manner of cauterizing the tear duct.
Chapter 19.
When you are curing a fistula, and your treatment has no effect, as we said in the classification of diseases; then, it is necessary to cauterize it in the following manner.
Have the patient lie on his back, and hold his head in your lap, and let an assistant hold his head between his hands so that it does not move or turn from side to side.Et tu stetist in pedibus eius, qui te sustinet, et propinquis oculo ad auriculem, et tangis eum cauterio taliter, ut non moueatur, nec agitetur cum capite suo: quoniam si moveatur, aut agitetur cum capite suo, non potes adflictare locum eius, qui necesse est.
Then stand at his feet, and lean over towards his ear, and touch him with the cautery tool so that he does not move or turn from side to side; for if he moves or turns from side to side, you cannot affect the place which it is necessary to affect.Then apply cotton soaked in egg white or psyllium mucilage over his eye; then apply the cautery, of which the shape is as follows.Fiamma enim Cauterii sit ad modum lunae, et igni sit lieve, qui non trahat sanguinem: et tangat locum super lacrimalem, ubi non est os: nam si tangatur os, et omnia ossa sint bene, tamen inflammatur, nec curatur.
For the flame of the cautery tool should be shaped like a crescent moon, and its heat should be moderate, so that it does not draw blood; and it should touch the place above the tear duct where there is no bone, for if it touches the bone, and all the bones are healthy, yet it will become inflamed, and will not be cured.It should be hollow, in the shape of a reed pen, with its point at one end, with which the cautery tool is made; and if you wish, let it penetrate all the way to the other end, and if you wish, let it be drawn upwards thus far.Et si uis sit concauum usque ad extremitatem aliam: nam si concauitas eius non sit ad modum cannae pennae uulturis, sed sit ad modum cannaae rigidae, qui est ad modum tubi: et fiat latus eius taliter, ut possit intrare in oculum.
Nevertheless this hollow one is better for your work.
Then put on it a cautery which has been made very hot.
And hold with it your hand for a little while over the cautery by the eye, towards the side of the nose, lest your hand wander or move unsteadily; and put the cautery into the fat of the eye, and corrupt it.
If therefore you can reach with the beginning of your cautery to the jaw, that will be well.Quam diu autem ponatur Cauterium super oculum, quod est infirmus, non dicimus: sed diximus, ut ponatur in ipso oculi adipe, et corrumpat eum.
And if not: then repeat the cautery once or twice, if you need it: and leave it for three days.
Then apply a poultice with butter, and treat it with a drying ointment until it heals. If forty days have passed and it has not healed, then apply a sharp corroding medicine on top of it until the bone is exposed: and scrape it according to what came in his chapter.
And there is another way of cauterizing a fistula, which some have said first.
Go to the place of the fistula, and find it; then put into its fissure a slender cannula, that is, a slender pipe, whose form is thus.
And pour into it a drachm quantity from liquefied lead, and hold your hand with a good grip on the cannula, and do not move at all, so that the molten lead does not run, or enter the eye of it.Et sic faciunt ad fistulam: et super eam ponunt cauterium corrodiuum, donec confringatur os, et corrodatur, et currit sanguis per eam.
And they do this to the fistula: and over it they put a cauterizing agent until the bone is broken, and corroded, and blood flows through it. And you ought to apply to the eye of the patient a poultice infused with egg white, or with water.
For lead burns the place of the fistula, and heals it with a wonderful healing.Et si non possit curari infimus per cotum: ponatur super oculum infusi cum oleo, donec curaritur: quod tamen non est faciendum nisi post quadraginta dies.
And if the patient cannot be cured with a poultice: a paste infused with oil is to be applied over the eye until it is healed; which however is not to be done unless after forty days. What we have said about cauterization and treatment is good if the fistula has healed.Et si non curabitur per cotum, et oleo: deinde iterum ponatur super eam cauterium corrodiuum, donec curaritur: sed post quadraginta dies iterum.
And if it is not healed with a poultice and oil: then the sharp cauterizing agent is to be applied again until it is healed; but after forty days again. And if not, then it is necessary to make an opening of the nose, and bring the fistula back to its course through the nose, according to what comes in its own place.
Of the manner of cauterizing in fissures of the lips.
Of the manner of cauterizing in fissures of the lips.
Many times they occur in the lip fissures, which are called Hairs, and especially in the lips of children.Quamvis enim mundi omnium corporum sit homo utilissimus tamen in his est plurimum lues: nam et ex oculis eius, et ex auribus, et ex naso, et ex ore saepe procedunt morborum semina, quae ad internum homines perducunt.
For although man is the most useful of all earthly bodies, yet there is much disease in him; for often the seeds of diseases proceed from his eyes, and ears, and nose, and mouth, which bring men to an early grave.When therefore you are treating these fissures, if they will not heal with the treatment we mentioned for diseases, then apply a cauterisation with a small knife, in this form.
And let its cavity be according to the fineness of the knife.Primum igitur deponas super eam, ut sit quasi apice cultri: deinde ad latera facies aliam concauitatem similiter: postea subtegamen, et in medio cultellum induces ad illius modum, quasi in medio cultelli scissuram sit.
Then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
On the way to cauterize a mouth abscess.
Chapter 21.
When an abscess occurs at the root of the gums, or the palate, or the roots of teeth: then it is full of pus and erupts, then becomes hard, and the pus runs out, and a fistula forms; then you treat it with ointment and it does not heal, then you should use hot cauterisation according to how much it can bear in the fistula.
Then insert the hot iron into the opening of the fistula, and hold your hand until the hot iron reaches the bottom of it, and its extreme tip; do this once or twice.Deinde intromitte ferrum ignitum in locum ut suprà ditus est: deinde trahe illum ad te, et reserare in ea loca quae sunt ad modum foramenis.
Then insert the hot iron into that place as mentioned above; then pull it towards you and scrape away at those places which are like holes. Then treat it with what we said about treatment until it is healed.
If therefore the pus is removed and it is healed, that will be good.Si tamen non curatur post unam cauterisationem, fac de novo eandem rem, vel iterum, donec curetur: sed non facias ad modum quod antea diximus, nisi post multas cauterisationes curatur.
But if it is not healed after one cauterisation, do the same thing again or twice, until it is healed; but do not do what we said before unless after many cauterisations it does not heal. And if not, then you must expose the place and remove the rotten bone according to how it comes in its location.Et si post multas cauterisationes non curatur locum, non facias iterato ad modum quod antea diximus: sed trahe ferrum tuum in medio, et reserare os cum lieve ad modum foramenis.
And if after many cauterisations the place is not healed, do not do repeatedly what we said before; but pull out your iron in the middle, and scrape away the tooth gently as holes.On the mode of cauterising in Gum-boils, and Softened Teeth.
Chapter 22.Si accidit apostema in radice gingiui, aut dentis: deinde curas cum caeroto, et salte ut suprà diximus, usquequo cessa sit pus: postea intromitte ferrum ignitum secundum quantitatem quod potest capere, vel fac aspicem calidum, et intromittes in locum istum.
When the gums become soft because of moisture and the teeth move and you treat them with remedies but they don't work, then place the patient's head in your lap.
Then apply cautery with a red hot iron as shown below so that you hold the tube over the tooth and quickly insert the red hot cautery into the tube and hold your hand there for a while until the patient feels the heat of the fire has reached the root of the tooth.
And take away your hand; then repeat the cautery several times according to what you see.
Then let the patient fill his mouth with salt water and hold it for an hour and spit it out.Et iteret haec res, donec dentem curet, aut caduca fiat radice.
The tooth is made firm by this movement and the soft gum is tightened and the corrupt moisture is dried up.
Chapter 23.De modo faciendi Cannulam ad Cauterandum dentem, et de modo ponendi eam super dentem.
When the pain of a tooth is due to coldness, or there is coldness in it, or heat and no benefit from treatment with remedies, then cautery is appropriate in two ways: either cautery with butter or cautery with fire.
The cautery with butter is performed thus: take vacca's butter and heat it in an iron spoon or in a ladle.
Then take a cotton pad and wrap it around the end of the toothpick.
Then immerse it in the hot butter and place it on the painful tooth quickly, and hold it until it cools; then repeat this several times, until the fire's strength reaches the tooth's root.
And if you wish, immerse wool or cotton in cold butter and place it on the tooth in pain; and put hot iron on top of it until the fire reaches the depth of the hollow tooth.
The cautery with fire is done thus: heat an air or iron pipe.Et si non habes ferrum, tene ferrum super focum donec ignis ueniat in extremitatem. And let there be something of thickness in his body, so that the sharpness of fire does not penetrate to the sore throat.
Then apply the cautery with a piece of cloth; and place it on the tooth; and hold your hand there until the cautery becomes cold.
Do this several times, for the pain will be relieved either at once or the same day or on another day.
And it is necessary, when the cautery has been applied, for the sick person to fill his mouth with good butter and hold it there for an hour; then he should spit it out.
And this is how the cautery is applied.
Apply the cautery with a pointed instrument, as far as possible; and this is the shape of the cannula.
On cauterizing sores.
CHAPTER XXIV.
When sores are due to phlegm and cold humors, and they do not yield to medicine that promotes digestion, nor can their digestion be hastened by any remedy, then apply the cautery with a concave instrument, which has this shape:
Holding two open ends, so that smoke may escape from the cautery at one end; and place it heated on the sore once or twice, if necessary, until it penetrates to the depth of the sore.
If the sore is small, then apply the cautery according to its size.Et sit in corpore eius quiddam grossitudinis, ut non perueniat acuitas ignis ad os infirmi.
Then leave it for three days, and apply to it a poultice infused in butter, until what has been burned by the fire is healed over.And let there be something of thickness in his body, so that the sharpness of fire does not penetrate to the sore throat.
Then treat it with tooth ointment until the shape of the cannula is healed over.Et si post haec diuersas diebus non remouet: tunc fac illum cotum de malabathro et butyro infusum, et pone super apostema, donec perueniat ad profundum, ut remoueatur.
Of the manner of cauterizing for hoarseness and a constriction of breathing.
Chapter 25.
When humors have gathered above the bronchus especially when accompanied by a cold disposition it is appropriate that the patient should be purged first with mild remedies.
Then cauterize it at the base of the gullet in a depressed spot and be careful not to apply the cautery tool too low or on the skin, but only a little bit of it.
Then cauterize it with another cautery tool at the junction of the neck at its lowest vertebra: and let the cautery be round according to the method already described.
Then treat it in that way until it is healed.
Of the manner of cauterizing for diseases of the Lungs and Coughing.Caput XXVI.
Chapter 26.De modo cauterizandi in raucedine uocis, et constrictione anhelitus.
When Cough and disease of the Lungs are from cold humors and the patient has no fever or consumption and the disease is not old then cauterize him with two cauteries above the collar-bone at depressed spots that are smooth and hollow.Deinde cauteriza ipsum cauterio alio in medio uel in summo stomachi in loco depresso, et sit Cauterium clauile secundum modum praecedens.
Then cauterize it with another cautery tool in the middle or at the top of the chest in a depressed spot and let the cautery be round according to the method already described.And with another cautery tool in the middle of the breast between the two breasts: and let the cautery be in the shape of a tube according to the form already described.Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit, donec sanetur.
And if your wound is to be cauterized by puncturing with a cautery, which is called the Point, the form of which precedes in the puncturing of the pain of the ears: and let the points be from thirty up to almost another.
Then heal it with that which precedes, until it is healed. And now let the cautery have three branches: according to this form.
Wherefore let the cauterization be lightened with it, when you make with it at the same time three cauteries.
¶ Of the manner of cauterizing in a tickling, in a dislocation of the Humerus.
Chapter 27.
When the head of the assistant is caused by moisture and not fixed in the hour of its return from the dislocation, until it becomes accustomed to returning, then dislocate it slightly, as we have now testified, then you must reduce the dislocation in the first place.Et postea oportet ut facias cum eo cauterisationem in locis quae sunt super illum, in quo dislocatur, et in locis subditis ad dislocationem; sed non debes iterare cauterisationem in uno loco donec pertegerit locum.
And then the invalid must be laid on his back, or on his sound side.Et oportet ut tenas locum dislocationis in ambibus manibus tuarum per digitum minimam, et sic debes tenere donec perficias cauterisationem; et debes fieri cauterisationem cum cauteletio, quod nominatur puncto.
And then raise the skin which is inside the Tickling towards the top with the fingers of your left hand; and if the joint is dislocated inward, do likewise.And eleua cutem quae est exteriori Titillici ad superiora cum digitis manus tuae dexterae: et si iunctura dislocatur ad exteriora.
Then light the cautery having two flames.Et si dislocationem facis in locis quibusdam, debes iterare cauterisationem per omnia loca dislocationis. Its shape is thus.
Then burn the skin until it penetrates to the other side, and there will be a figure of four cauteries from cauterization.
And when cauterization is done with a cautery having three edges, then the figure of cauterization is six cauteries: and there are edges according to the subtlety of the probe.Et cum cauterizaris latus alterum, fac similiter usque ad mediam partem faciendi figuram cauterizationis sex cauteriorum per mediam partem uel per omnem eandem.
And this is the shape of a cautery having three edges.Cum autem cauterizaris latus alterum, fac similiter usque ad mediam partem faciendi figuram cauterizationis sex cauteriorum per mediam partem vel per omnem eandem.
And sometimes this is added on top of this type, because there are eight cauteries.
Then place over the cautery crushed garlic with salt.
Then have the invalid keep still, so that the limb is not moved for a while, until it is healed.
And if there is dislocation to the upper part, and this rarely happens, then cauterize it over the shoulder with a nail- cautery, or by puncturing it in many places with many cauteries.
For the joint is made firm and the moisture removed; and so the invalid is healed.
¶ On how to cauterize the stomach.Et si debuerit cauterizare stomachus, faciunt fero super eum platem calidum, et super eum clysterem frigidum, et postea super eum placulam frigidam ad commovendum eum.
Chapter XXVIII.
When cold and much moisture occur in the stomach, so that they extract it from its complexions, and increase catarrh to it, and frequent remedies are applied without result, then the patient should be laid on his back, and his legs and arms extended.
Then he is to be cauterized with three cauteries: one cautery below the size of a thimble for the chest, and two cauteries on either side, each the size of a fingernail, until a triangular figure is formed by the cauteries.
And between these, so that they do not join, when they form pus.Et postea, cum facent pus, et creverint, tunc spurgantur. And afterwards, when the pustules have formed and broken, they are to be drained. And the depth of the cautery should be the thickness of two-thirds of the skin.Et si quaeritur ut in loco cauterizado non crescant pilus et capillis, sed cadat, tunc faciat ita: postea cum cauterizare superimpositam velum lintei, et super velum faciat fumigationes cum aqua calida et cum mercurio.
And the figure of the cauteries be made in this manner without addition; and if you will cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this figure, let there be one cautery which makes this cautery according to the form of a circle in this manner.
And the stomach is cauterized by pricking with this cautery; and it is as though you marked upon the stomach the point of a pin according to the amount which you will with the encaustic; then cauterize it with the cautery of the point, then cure it with the cure that preceded until it is healed.
Of the way of cauterizing cold Feces.
Chapter 29.
When there happens in the Liver pain from coldness and moisture, or from foul winds, until it is expelled from its natural complexional exit, the superfluous, and it is cured feeble, with that which we said, and it does not avail him in this: then one must cause the patient to recline on his back, and mark with encaustic three cauteries according to this figure, and the same quantity above on the Liver below from the hypocondrii, where the elbow of man comes through; and let there be space between each cautery according to the thickness of a finger; and let the cautery be according to the length of the body straight, and do not press your hand with the cautery much.
And let the quantity of that which is burned be from the thickness of the skin, the quantity of its half not added; and let the patient stand on his feet.Et cauterizatur ab hypothenaribus manu dextra, et deinde ab hypothenaribus manu sinistra, deinde inter pollicem et index manu dextra: et fiant iste tres cauteria cum unum quod fit secundum figuram circuli super Epaten inferius ab hypocundriis ubi peruenit cubitus hominis secundum quantitatem quae praediximus.
If he is not standing then he should be lying down, with his legs extended and arms raised. This is the form of cauterization.
And indeed it is possible for you to cauterize with these cauteries using a knife cautery when you have subtlety and prudence in the art.
And beware that you do not go too far in cauterization and the thickness of the skin everywhere is burned, for then the whole body is burned and it penetrates to the intestines: because the skin there is thin, so know this.
Of the way of cauterizing pustules of the liver.
Chapter 30.
When it happens that a pustule erupts, and you want to know whether this pustule is in the liver itself or in its membrane: then if it is in the liver itself, there comes on a feeble pain and heaviness without acuteness; and if it is in the membrane of the liver, with the pain there is acute pain.
It behooves then that he should recline on his back over his neck.And you must know that this type occurs in the region of the hypochondrium, and sometimes also in the back near the kidneys. And its cause is heat which has settled there, or coldness.
Then outline the site of the pustule with an encrusted cautery; then ignite the cautery until it is like a live coal.And its nature is moist, and it becomes dry through heat. And its taste is sweet. And it has no smell.
And this is its shape.
And cauterize with it a single cautery, until the skin is all burned up and it penetrates into the siphos, until all the pus comes out; then heal it with healing of the holes, until it heals.
And this type of cautery should not be used except by one whose interest in the art of medicine is prolonged; and who has encountered these diseases many times through experience: then he dares to attempt such an operation.
But it is better for me to dismiss her.
¶ Of the way of cauterizing in the pleurisy.
Chapter 31.Et haec est forma eius.
And this is its shape.The ancients said, cautery with the roots of aristolochia for cold pleurisy in this way.Et si non fuerit sicca cutis, sed humida, et faciatur cauterium cum radice gentianae.
And if the skin is not dry but moist, and the cautery is made with the root of gentian.And it is, that you take from dry roots of aristolochia, a longer root, which is found in it, and let it be as thick as a finger.Et mola, et frica, donec sit sicut farina: et fac cauterium cum oleo oliverae.
Then immerse it in oil and light it on fire.
Then cauterize with one brand between the fork and the neck, and with two small brands a little declined to the side under the beard.
And with two brands also between the fifth and sixth ribs declining a little to the back; and one brand in the middle of the chest, and one above the stomach.
And with three brands behind: one between the two fork-bones; and with two small brands from both sides of the chest below the brand which is between the two fork-bones.
And it behoves not that you press your hand with the brand, but rather let it be out of touch, smelling the skin. And some ancient men have said that from among men there are those who use a cautery of iron like a needle; and they light it and put it inside between the ribs, until it comes to the ulcer itself and the pus goes out: just as we have said in the case of the liver.
But there is danger in this piercing with the cautery: either the invalid will die on the spot, or a fistula will form in place to which there is no cure.
§ Of the Manner of Cauterizing the Spleen Chapter 32.
When you are treating a spleen ailment and your treatment according to the discussion of the cure of ailments does not help, then there is cautery for it in three ways, all of which are correct.Primus modus est: quod accendis cauterium in igni, et percutiens intraverti in eo quod est inter axillas, ut percutiat et intraverti intrinsecum usque ad eam partem de qua procedit dolor: et sic ad eam partem quae est ultra, donec perveniatur ad mediam partem cordis.
The first mode is: that you light the cautery in fire, and prick it between the armpits so that it pricks and goes inside to where the pain comes from; and thus to the part beyond until it reaches the middle of the heart.One of these is to make three cauteries, or four lining according to the length of the spleen according to the shape of the cauteries of the liver, whose precedence is the shape.Et si non percutiet in ea parte quae est sub axilla, sed intraverti intraverti intraverti intraverti intraverti intraverti intraverti intraverti intraverti intraverti intraverti intraverti intraverti

Let there be between every cautery a quantity equal to the thickness of a finger, or a little more or less.
And let the measure of the cautery which we spoke of for the liver cautery be equal.
And do not press your hand with the cautery; and let the patient be laid on his back.
And another mode of cauterization is this: having heated the cautery as directed in the chapter on dislocation of the shoulder-joint, raise up the skin which is over the spleen, where the left elbow of the sick man comes; and let your elevation of the skin be according to the breadth of his body, that the cauteries may fall according to the length of the body.
Then insert two hot cauteries until they penetrate through to the other side of the skin; then withdraw the cautery; there will thus be four cauteries. And if you wish, cauterize with a cautery having three bars.
Then after removing the cautery, be careful to cause it to emit pus for many days; for it is more efficacious than the others which have preceded in the course of treatment.
The mode of cauterizing in dropsy is as follows.
CHAPTER XXXIII.
A cautery does not take effect in dropsy unless the scrotum is properly handled.
When you are treating a case of dropsy by the methods of treatment which we mentioned under dissection and if this does not effect a cure then you must cauterize him with four cauteries around the navel; with one cautery over the stomach, another over the liver, and another over the spleen; with two cauteries behind the back between the vertebrae, and one in front of the chest, and another over the abdomen; and let the depth of penetration of the cauteries be about equal to the thickness of the skin.
Then leave the cautery open that it may emit pus for a long time.Et sit inter omne cauterium quantitas grossitudinis digiti, aut plus parum.
And do not dismiss the sick man from treatment after the cautery, but let there be added to him two additional intentions; and healing will hasten to him with God's help.
The shape of the cautery with which the abdomen is cauterized must be curved in accordance with the shape that precedes it; and the one with which the back is cauterized must be round in accordance with the shape that precedes it.
A way of cauterizing feet and legs. Chapter 34.
When they are filled with water and become yellow, you must cauterize the back of the foot in a line between the auricular and ring fingers; then lift your hand with the cautery and do not twist it, then lift your hand again and do not return to it at all.
The yellow water will boil out, and let the cautery be in this shape.
Then make two cauteries on each leg, and let the cautery be made with a knife-like tip; and let the cautery be according to the length of the leg, one below the knee, and the other lower down, about midway down the leg; and over the hip make two cauteries; then leave the cautery open for a long time without dressing so that some water will boil out from it; then dress it with the others which we mentioned.
A way of cauterizing in a hernia. Chapter 35.
When there is a hernia caused by cold and moisture until it weakens the retentive and digestive powers which are in the stomach and intestines, and it is treated with methods of cure but does not heal, and you see that the weak person tolerates cauterization well with abundant strength, then cauterize it with a large cautery over its stomach according to what precedes in the cauterization of the stomach with the cautery of a circle, and four cauteries around the navel thinly, with a thin, small cautery; and one cautery over the alcatel above the anus, or two cauteries.
And if you see abundant moisture and it tolerates that, then cauterize it with a cautery over the breastbone, and with a cautery over each hip; and perhaps you should add two small cauteries near the large one over the stomach.Et si uides aliquid adiuuandi et robustificandi in solutione: fac super omnia quae diximus, cauteria parua circiter trium digitum.
For a treatment is not successful if its diagnosis is not correct.
[f. 34v] Of the manner of cauterizing hemorrhoids.
[f. 34v] Chapter XXXVI.
When there are many old hemorrhoids in the anus, or one, and they are from gross humors, cold, or corrupt humidities, and they are treated with that which we said in the diagnosis, and the treatment does not work: then cauterize with three cauteries over the lower spine of the back a little under the navel in the shape of a triangle, and with the cautery almost two fingers under the umbilical.
And if you think that the stomach of him is chilled, and his food not digested, and you see his face apostematized, then cauterize him over his stomach with a large cautery according to what has preceded: and with a cautery over his Liver, and another over his Spleen, with a nail cautery: and leave the cautery open for some time: then cure him until he is healed.
[f. 35r] Of the manner of cauterizing after their excision.Anthelli, qui in pluris et magnis sunt, et superi in corpori, et non habent humores corruptos, sed sunt ex humoribus grossis frigidis, quos saepe abscidere debes: postea, cum diximus tibi in diuisione, cauteriza eum.
Chapter 37.
When you cut off the nail, then use a cautery that is like a brand.
Then put the hot cautery into the nail which has been cut off; and hold it there until the cautery reaches the opening of the vein from which the blood flows: do this once or twice. If therefore the nails are many, then cauterize each one with a cautery according to what we have told you.
Then treat them, with that which we have told you about ointments, until they are healed.
And if you cauterize it with a large cautery above the chalk, it is better in the end.Et si tu volumis abscindere althelum cum chordo quaedam, quae tenet illum, ut non cadat, et sic tegeas locum ubi absciderunt eum, fac sic:
¶ Of the manner of cauterizing a fistula in the anus.Postea de sanguine quod currit ex illa parte superius, fac una manu spungiam uel linteam, et teneas eum, donec consistere et stetire sanguis:
Chapter 38.Et cum ea spunga aut lintea teges locum ubi est cauterizat, fac sic usque ad tertiam diem, et deinde remitte spungiam uel linteam, donec sanguis non currat: fac illud semel, vel bis.
When the patient does not respond to the incision and operation which we have told of in its place, and is terrified by it, perhaps he will be cured by the cautery.Et si tu volumis facere cauterium secundo, quod non debet fieri nisi post tertiam diem, cum primo, fac sic:
When then it happens that a fistula is old and pus and corrupt moisture flow from it, then do this:Take the cautery in your hand with which you will cauterize the place of the fistula, and press it to the fistula until it burns down to the very bottom of it; but do not press it so hard that the cautery does not touch the fistula.
It is indeed necessary to probe it with a slender tent.And if you find any part in which there is an obstruction, do not press the cautery so hard as to break it down: but press it more gently and then let go your hand; and when it is no longer hot, take the tent and probe again.
Then know the quantity of its depth with the tent.And when you have found where the obstruction lies, press in that place with a large cautery until you feel that it burns down to the very bottom of the fistula; then let go your hand and do not touch it again until it cools.Deinde fac illum primum cauterium cum grande cauterio, et deinde fac secundum.
Then you can use fire as a cautery, which is similar to an iron.
Then you put the hot iron into the fistula and the amount that enters is the amount of the claw. And repeat over it with the cautery, until all these corrupted bodies are burned, once, or twice, or thrice, according to your necessary estimation.
And beware of burning the nerve if it is there, or a great vein; or if the fistula goes to the bladder, or to the intestine, then beware of all these places.
And do not do this unless the fistula is in a fleshy place; and you think because it is not penetrating.
Then treat the place until it heals.
But if the place is sealed and materials are cut away from it, and it remains thus for a long time; then know that it has now been healed completely.Si autem postea reuertitur ad malum, et fit fistula ad alium locum: scias quia non est sanatus intus.
And if afterward it returns to being evil, and a fistula forms in another place; know that it is not healed inside. And if materials are not cut away from it, then know that it is penetrating, or there is a corrupted bone in its depth, or almost from them: of whose memory the fistula will return to its own place.
¶ Of the mode of cauterizing the Kidneys.Et si trahit ad renes, facias super eum cauterium tam diu, donec comburantur omnia corpora corrupta: et per totum caeterum quod est supra os in eius loco, usque ad carnem uiridem.
Chapter 39.
When it happens that there is pain in the kidneys from coldness or from gross wetness, and it decreases because of that to the coitus of the sick person, then one must cauterize it above the almethene above the kidneys, with a cautery on every kidney with the cautery of the key, after whose predecessor was mentioned.
And perhaps we would cauterize it secondly in the almight.
Why three lines will come.
Therefore, the last will be in command.Ita facies super renem cum cauterio clauili.
On the Way to Cauterize a Bladder.
Chapter 40. When a bladder becomes weak and flaccid from cold and moisture to the point that it cannot retain urine, then cauterize it in its lower part over the bladder where the hairs of a comb begin, with one cautery on the right side of this area, and another on the left: the length of the cautery on each side should be equal to the width of the tip of your thumb. Cauterize with a single cautery in the lower back or with two cauteries if necessary: the cautery should follow the line of the foreskin.
On the Way to Cauterize the Womb. Chapter 41.When there is a cold or moisture in the womb so that it cannot retain its contents, then cauterize it with one cautery on each side at the place where the hairs of the pubic hair begin: the length of the cautery should be equal to the width of the tip of your thumb. Then cauterize it with a single cautery in the lower back or with two cauteries if necessary: the cautery should follow the line of the foreskin.
When there is cold and moisture in the womb that prevents conception, corrupts the menses, delays their flow, and causes pain at the time of menstruation, then it should be cauterized with three cauteries around the navel as we said in the cautery of the bladder, and with a cautery below the pubic bone, or two cauteries: the cautery should follow the line of the foreskin.
On the Way to Cauterize an Ulcer from Dislocation.
Chapter 42.When a bone is dislocated and there are ulcers on it, then cauterize them with one cautery from above and another from below where the hairs of the pubic hair begin: the length of each cautery should be equal to the width of your thumb. Then cauterize it with a single cautery in the lower back or with two cauteries if necessary: the cautery should follow the line of the foreskin. When an ulcer is dislocated, and there are ulcers on it, then cauterize them with one cautery from above and another from below, where the hairs of the pubic hair begin: the length of each cautery should be equal to the width of your thumb. Then cauterize with a single cautery in the lower back or with two cauteries if necessary: the cautery should follow the line of the foreskin.
When the moistness of the mucous membrane is poured out to the skin of the ulcer and its cause is removed from its place, and when one leg is prolonged over the other when they are compared side by side, and the site of the dislocation is found to be hollow: then cauterize it with one cautery above and another below, where the hairs of the pubic hair begin. The length of each cautery should be equal to the width of your thumb. Then cauterize with a single cautery in the lower back or with two cauteries if necessary: the cautery should follow the line of the foreskin.
You should therefore cauterize the weak spot on the anus with a similar cautery in a small circle; after you have marked it with the cautery around the perimeter of the anus, as it is described; and so that the anus will fall into the middle of the circle.
And let the form of the cautery which precedes be in the cautery of the stomach.
If you do not have this cautery at hand, then cauterize it with three cauteries, with a large olive-wood cautery; and let the depth of the cautery be according to the thickness of the skin of the whole.
Then treat it until it is healed.
¶ Of a way of cauterizing in sciatica.Quemadmodum sciaticam debes cauterizare circa nervum sciatico cum cauterio oliuari magno et circulo grande: sed non in uno loco, donec perveniat ad nervum sciatico. Chapter 43.De modo trahaendorum stomachi et oesophage cum capito de oleo.
When a pain occurs in the anus and its cause is coldness or moisture, and it is treated with what we have said above about the division of the rectum, but that does not help, and becomes chronic; then you must treat the patient's discomfort caused by thick humors using foul-smelling pills, artificial pills and similar remedies.
Then cauterize it.
There are two ways of performing the cautery: either with a cautery that burns, or with fire.
A cautery with fire can be performed in many ways.
One of these is to cauterize the anus with three triangular cauteries, according to this shape:
And make them either deep or shallow.Et si accidat, ut cum primo cauterio facias, et non curabitur, facies alium super eum secundum primum.
And if you do the first cautery and it is not healed, do another one on top of it according to the first one.And the space between each cautery should be the thickness of a finger; the cauteries should be olive-sized.Et si accidat, ut cum secundo cauterio non curabitur: facies tertium super eum secundum primum.
When cautery is performed in the middle above the head of the hook itself.
There are four cauteries.
And if you wish to cauterize with a circle whose shape precedes it in the cauterization of the hook, only one: so that the circle contains the whole anchor.
And burn the thickness of the skin of all.Cauteria autem sunt quattuor.
These are the methods of cautery in sciatica, when the pain clings to the anchor itself and does not extend to the hip and thigh.
But if it extends to the hip and thigh, then cauterize it with two cauteries above the hip, above the place that the invalid indicates is painful, and with your cautery above the bone four fingers from the end towards the finger: and let the cautery be a knife.Si autem dolor non extenditur usque ad coxam et crurem, sed solum ad ancham, tunc cauteriza unum super caput anchae, in medio superancham, et alterum circum finem anchae, prope locum ad quem innuit infirmus. But if the pain does not extend to the hip and thigh, but only to the anchor, then cauterize one above the head of the hook, in the middle above the hook, and another around the end of the hook, near the place that the invalid indicates is painful.And let the depth of the cautery be according to the thickness of the skin.In cauterizatione autem istorum omnium cauterium sit cultellare, et cauteriza super cutem.
But in the cautery of all these let the cautery be a knife, and cauterize over the skin.If the invalid indicates that the pain extends up to near the toes, then cauterize it there where he indicates with a puncturing cautery, three or four or more if necessary.
And if he indicates that the pain is under the knee on the lower leg, then cauterize it there with one knife cautery.Si autem dolor extenditur usque ad pedem et crurem, et innuit se dolere in loco ubi stetit ancha, et non potest ambulare, tunc illic cauteriza cum circulo cauterio uno.
But if the pain extends to the foot and lower leg, and he indicates that he is in pain where the hook stands, and cannot walk, then cauterize it there with one circular cautery.And beware in all your cauterizations, lest you go too deep with the cautery so as to burn a nerve or large artery, and bring upon the invalid great harm, or contraction.
And I indeed have already seen one and another, of those who cauterized above the tendon, and finished in cauterization, and the leg was swollen until the tumor reached the foot, and it was perforated all through, and the whole foot was rotted: then there happened a rupture of the belly, and death after that.
If there is pain in two parts at once, cauterize both in this way.
And certain wise men have said in the cauterization of an anchorite, whose cautery is this mode.
Make the cauterizing instrument of iron, whose diameter is half a palm: and let it be at its opening according to the thickness of a finger-nail, or less by a little; and within that piece of iron let there be a third piece of iron.
And let the space which is between every piece of iron be through the quantity of a knuckle-bone; and let the pieces of iron be open on two sides; and let their height be as much as a knuckle, or two knuckles: and make for them a handle made from iron fittingly inserted in the pieces of iron.
And this is its form.
Then it is heated in fire until it turns red and throws sparks; then it is placed upon the wart of the anchorite lying down on his healthy side.
Cauterize him therefore with three round cauteries in one place.
Then leave him for three days.Postea, si necessitas est, faciatur super eum cauterium tertium secundum hunc modum.
Then apply a plaster with butter; and leave the wound open for several days.
Then treat it with ointment until it heals.
Albucasis says: We have used this type of cautery rarely, because of the fear its appearance inspires; and also because we found few people willing to keep still while it was being applied.
Nevertheless, it is one of the good cauteries for those who can endure it and find its place.
The cautery with burning medicines is done by taking two pieces of lamb’s wool, through which a pin made of bronze or iron passes, the pin being as long as the thickness of the wall; there should be two knots on the pins, at the height of the pins themselves.
Let there be a space between them equal to the thickness of a finger; and let them be open at the bottom and at the top; and they must be sewn together with a piece of linen, in this shape.
Then lay it on the wound of the anus, while the patient lies on his healthy side.Et contineat eam locum usque ad curam omnem: et postea, cum unguento.
And compress your hand strongly over the end of the arrowhead.
Then pour between the two circles some hot water which has been heated a little by fire, and hold it there for about an hour; and the sick person will endure its biting and burning heat as if it were fire until it is quieted.
Then lift up your hand with the instrument, and wash off the hot water from the arrowhead altogether with sweet water; then leave it for three days.
And put butter on it until the blackness of the burn is removed; and leave it for several days, and pus will run out of it.
For this is the last part of the wound.
Then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
If the pain extends to the hip or leg: make him a poultice in it which contains water, in the same way that you made the one in the arrowhead.
And this is the method of hot water; and I have already written about it in the treatise on rectifying medicine.
Take alkali and non-extinguished lime, both one part; pound them both, and put them in a new pot whose lower part is perforated by a small hole, according to the quantity that goes into it; and put under the bottom of the pot another pot which has been whitened: then throw on top of the alkali and lime from sweet water, so that both are submerged by one digit; afterwards you compress them with your hand with a good compression: and take away the pot, until the sharp water runs down into the lower part of the whitened pot.
Then collect all that water, and throw it over another lime; and stir it, until it is renewed.Et iste est modus medicinarum quae ponuntur in ista lese a parte ad remouendo illam.
And this is the method of medicines which are put on that wound to remove it.For then it will be very strong and sharp, which is administered in many medical operations, and in cauterizing other limbs.Et si quid est in ista lese super quod debet administrari medicamentum, ad mortificandum et mortuum remouendo eam: fac illud in modo qui sequitur.
Because it accomplishes its action through fire.
And from medicines there are others with which wounds are cauterized: honey, for instance, and aniseed, mastic and chalk mixed with soap; the two latter being applied together.
And Galen indeed has recorded the cure of a certain ancient man's pain in his back and sciatic vein; and he greatly admired it.
And he said that it did not need any other cure; and that he was healed from the application of a plaster alone, until he related how that man chanced to have fallen into a bath, and came out of it already healed. And it is to be made from green fennel-seed; and if the green seeds cannot be had, dry ones are to be used instead, freshly gathered; these must be pounded much with a little fat and applied over the painful spot, whether in the back, or the thigh, or the hip; and they must be bound on, and left for three hours, or until the sufferer feels the heat to have ceased.
Then let him go into a bath.
When his body has been made sweat with the bath, let him be put on to a bed.
For the pain will depart and be cured.
And you should know that one ought not to use cautery with these medicines unless after the evacuation of the body.
And Dioscorides who has said that when a sciatic vein is cauterized with goat's dung it benefits it; and the cautery is made in this way.
Wool must be taken and soaked in old oil; then placed upon the spot between the great toe and the next toe, which is nearest to the great one.
Then take dry goat' s dung, and ignite it on a fire until it becomes charcoal.Et ponatur super lanam et olerem, et est sub te.
Then place this over the wool and fat, which is under you; then put the cautery over the wool and leave it until it has burned out.Et scias, quia si est lues uena sciatica, neque faciatur cauterium nec stercus caprarum, sed ponantur super locum fatuus anacardorum, et mel, et calx sapone: et ligetur cum fascibus pro tempore singulis diebus.
Then repeat that.
Do not cease therefore from doing this until the sense of feeling has returned through the mediation up to the elbow and the pain has subsided.
And this mode of cautery is called the Cow's-horn cautery.Viderit autem medicus si post cauteriums sensum teneat dolor, et tamen non cesserit, sed iterum ad cauterium remeiat: et ita fit usquequo perueniat sensus super mediatione usque ad ancham: postea medicus teneat manum in aqua frigida donec rrefrigescant nervi: et quolibet die fiet illud usquequo perueniat sensus, et quiescat dolor.
The surgeon must see that after the application of the cautery if there is still pain and it has not ceased but returns to the cautery again; and so on until feeling returns through the mediation up to the elbow, and then the surgeon should hold his hand in cold water to cool the nerves; and this must be done every day until feeling returns and the pain subsides.¶ Of Cauterisation for the pain in the Back.
Chapter 42.De dolorosissimo dorsi et ankiae, qui vocatur sciatica.
Whenever pain occurs in the back from many causes, whether by accident or a blow, or from excessive discharge, and similar things, from the infusion of cold and moist matter; and cauterization indeed does not occur except in this one type only, which is done from the infusion of cold matter.
Therefore after the discharge of the patient with fetid pills and similar things, so that they are made over the back where there is pain, three lines according to the breadth of the palm of his hand, after marking with a hot iron in each line five cauteries or more according to the quantity which comes from the endurance of the patient by virtue of this: and cauterization is done with a cauterizing-iron.
And if you wish, cauterize with three cauteries or four, with the nail-shaped cautery according to this form:
¶ Of the manner of cauterizing in incipient scrofula.Et post euacuationem cum pillulis foetidis super dorsum, ubi est dolor, ut supra dictum est, faciatur cauterizationis infusio frigida, et humida, et temperata de oleo rosato cum aqua rosea: et fiunt super eam tres lineae secundum latitudinem almeidati, et in omni linea quinque cauteria faciantur, aut plura secundum tolerantiam infirmorum.
Chapter 45.Et si non possit tolerare tantum, fiant tres, aut duo cauteria solum: et post haec infusio calida faciatur de oleo rosato cum aqua rosea temperata, et super eam fiunt cauteria, vel cauterizationis infusio faciatur de oleo ad cauterizationem admixta cum oleo scordii: et fiant tres lineae secundum latitudinem almeidati ipsius ubi est dolor.
And if it cannot tolerate so much, let there be three or two cauteries only: and after this a warm infusion is made of rose oil tempered with rose water, and over this cauteries are made, or the infusion for cauterization is made of oil for cauterization mixed with oil of scordium: and three lines are made according to the breadth of its palm where there is pain.This ailment often happens to small children.
And the sign of its incipient state in children is that which happens to him in panting upon elevation and motion: and you find in the last vertebra of the back and its nodes, what has already begun to project over the other vertebrae.Et ista scrofula inaequalis est in pueris et in mulieribus, quod prope non habet curam nisi a seipsa, et quod necesse non est ad omnia cauterizare: sed multotiens cadit curatio per infusiones frigidas temperatas cum oleo rosato.
When therefore you see it, and wish to do it, then cauterize it with a cautery which is circular in this form.
And let the cautery be applied over all parts of the spine equally; and if you wish, cauterize around the circumference of the spine with a punctured cautery, two lines or three; and let the punctures be near to each other.
Then dress the wound, until it is cured as we have said.
And beware lest you apply the cautery to a protuberance which comes from the spasming of a nerve.
On cauterization for gout and joint pains. Chapter 46.
When the pains of joints are from cold humors which flow to any limb of the body, then when they occur in the feet, it is the custom of physicians to call that gout properly.Et quando accidunt dolores in manibus, et in pedibus simul, dicuntur Podagra et Gotta; sed multum differt a Podagra cum doloribus iuncturarum.
When then, as a result of cold causes, gout is treated by means of remedies and the pains are not removed, cautery removes them.
And it is, that you cauterize it after evacuation around the joint of the feet, by many cauteries: and let the cautery be Olive oil.
Whose form is this:
And if you need to prick on the surface of the foot, then do it with a needle cautery.
What if the pains ascend up to the knees, or other joints, and it often happens, then cauterize them above each knee with three cauteries, or four on every side, using this same cautery of clavicle. If you need more of this cautery, then cauterize it. And do not immerse your hand in the cautery, but rather it be about as thick as the thickness of skin only.
If the pains ascend to the knees and back: then administer what we said from the cautery in its chapter.Et est ut cauterizes eum post omnes vires, post omnia remedia, et non potest esse curatus nisi per cauterium.
If the pains are only in their hands, then pierce at random around the nail-beds, as it were two lines.
If, however, any pains remain in the fingers, then pierce above each joint, and above the crease of the hand.
If the pains rise after a few days into the elbows or into the shoulders, then cauterize both from every part.
And do not dismiss the invalid, without having restored him with good diet, and the application of remedies.
For if the diet be good, and he is purged of phlegm, he will be healed by God's help with this cautery.
On the way of cauterizing for Ruptures.Cauteria sint autem de lamine ad modum chorda, quae est ad arcum, quod trahit sagitam.
Let the cauteries be then of a lamina in the shape of a chord, which draws the arrow of the bow.CHAP. 47.
When a rupture occurs in the groin and descends into the intestine, or the scrotum towards the testicle, and it is beginning near at hand; then you must order the invalid to let go of the rupture in his day.Et si non possit dimittere comestionem, sed debet omnes dies tenere, et accidit dolor, sed non est ex ea ruptura, sed dolores sunt in inguinibus, et testiculis:
And that he be given laxatives for him to pass faeces from his belly.
Then have him sit between your hands on his back: and command him to hold his breath until it comes out, or the fart, or the intestine.
Then bring him back with your fingers and mark with cautery under the rupture over the bone of the breast plate, with a mark whose end is similar to the middle of a circle towards the upper part of the body.
Then ignite the cautery, whose shape is as follows, until it becomes white and expels sparks.
Then bring back the intestine or fart to its cavity.
Then the assistant shall put his hand over the place so that the intestine does not come out: and you have already opened between the legs of the patient, and placed under him a basin, and another servant on top of his legs and another on top of his chest who is holding his hands.
Then put down the cautery on top of that mark, with your hand standing straight with the cautery.
And hold him until you meet his bone, or repeat with him again another time if you did not meet the bone on the first try.
And carefully observe from the exit of the intestine during your hour of cauterizing, lest you burn it and it enters into him above or death or great harm.Deinde si ego sum minister, qui tenet causticum, et non potero facere super infirmum, sed ego ergo faciam pro te: tu autem tene eum cum manibus tuis usque ad os, donec superimponas causticum super ipsum, donec confrimaris cum eo.
And if I am the assistant holding the cautery and cannot do it to the patient, then I will do it for you: but you hold him with your hands until his mouth is reached, until you put down the cautery on him until you are finished with him. And know that when you do not reach the bone with the cautery, your operation does not help.
And it is fitting for infants to have a subtle cautery according to their measurement.
Then treat with the remaining ointment until he is healed.
And let the patient lie on his back for forty days, until the wound seals up.
And it is fitting to put his food length of time during his cure to make his belly soft so that the intestine does not come out at the incision and cause vomiting.
Then when one wishes to operate after forty days, then administer a ligature made properly and hold it for the other forty days.
For when he uses this treatment, thus he is healed with whole healing.Et post quadraginta dies surgatur cum ligatura, et tunc curatur cum salte, et uino, et lardo, et oleo, et cum omni balsamate, quod possit accipi.
But when Ruptures happen in the rest of the belly, and are beginning, and you wish that they not be added to, then cauterize their Rupture with a round cautery according to its quantity: and let it be that which is burnt from there on as one third of it.Et faciat illum sicut capitulum uini et olei et salis et lardae et balsamatibus et cum omni bonitate, donec curentur Rupturae.
Then dress it with what we have said; and nothing is added.
And now some say that the rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cautery according to this form.
After it has been branded with a hot iron and a line is drawn through the width of the rupture on its upper side, and another line at the bottom. And place your hand in the middle with the cautery-claw.
But cauterization is easier and better. On the method of cauterizing for pains from a fall or from a blow
CHAPTER XLVIII.
When this happens to some member from a fall or blow, and the pain continues for a long time, and medicine does not help it; then it ought to be cauterized with the punctured cautery.
And let the cautery be of the size of the member, and its smallness, and weakness, and power, and the position of the pain and hurt from it.
If therefore it is healed by the first cautery, that is well.Et si non, deinde secundum necessitatem fiant cauteria plura: quod si faciat dolorem, et tortum, et mortem in loco illo, utpote in quo est dolor, debuet iterare cauterium ibidem, donec mortus sit dolor.
If not: then repeat over that same cautery.
Because it is the custom of these pains that they are transferred from one member to another near it.
Therefore you should pursue them with cautery until the patient is healed.
¶ On the way of cauterizing in Leprosy.
Chapter 49.Antiquiores medici, ut aiunt, lepras et morbos chronicos in membris infelicibus per singulas lunam et diem consueverunt curare, quod postea describere intentavimus.
The older doctors, as they say, used to treat leprosy and chronic diseases in unfortunate limbs every month and day, which we intended to describe later. Leprosy patients, however, sometimes benefit from the strongest cautery.Si ergo lepra sit in manu aut pedi, vel in quavis parte corporis et non possit faciliter extirpari neque suppuratione curari, oportet ut ad cauterium confugiat.
And especially the type of leprosy that comes from the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy: when you therefore want to cauterize it, consider it.Si enim ex infortuneo mox est facta et non potest sanari nisi cauterio, non debes dubitare neque temporis neque sollicitudinis nec de adficiendo aliis causticis.
If it is a new leprosy and you have treated it with what we said earlier in the division, and it does not go down or stay: if you also fear that corruption may affect the entire complexion of the patient, then cauterize him on the head with five cauteries: one in the middle of the head, and a second lower down towards the forehead at the end of the hair, and two over the two horns, and one behind on the back of the neck.Si tamen non curatur post istos cauteriis, sed praeterit: et est infelicior eam qua antea: et est aduersus curari, quod non potest suppuratione curari neque alio modo, sed ad mortem se ueluit: oportet quod cauterizes sub capite apud radices capillorum.
And with the cautery a little while your hand, until it leaves on the bone a slight impression, and from it are dislocated the cortices: so that it is eased of expiration of the vapors gross from it, and cauterize also with the cautery over the spleen itself, according to what preceded.
But if the leprosy is now spread upon the sick person, and appears manifestly: then one ought to cauterize with those cauteries, which we said in the head, and with a cautery upon the extreme of his nose, and with two cauteries over his two jaws, and with two cauteries over the vertebrae of his neck, and six over the vertebrae of his back, and with one great cautery over the tail-bones by the granule of the tail, and one above itself in the almeidaty: and two upon his flanks, namely, upon every flank one, and two over the knee; one over every knee, and two over the shoulders, and two over the forearms, and two over the tender parts of his breast; and cauterize him over all the joints, from the joints of the fingers of his hands, and feet: and cauterize over all the calcaneum of his feet, and the focils of his hands.
And beware of the nerves which are upon the last calcaneum, lest you burn them. And sometimes one is cauterized with a cautery over the bone of the comb, and another over the bone of the stomach, and another over the spleen.
And you should know that as much as you add cautery, it is more effective and more beneficial.
And you should know that the sick person does not find pain in cautery, as healthy people do; because his body is already stunned.
And it is necessary that the cauteries be of size and smallness according to the members and joints; according to what preceded from the kinds of tools.
Chapter 50.
Chapter 50: When a limb is paralyzed and is treated with remedies, oils, and plasters but does not recover, then cauterize the affected limb with cauteries according to its size or smallness.
And let your cautery pass slightly into the thickness of the skin.
Then treat it with ointment until it heals.
And sometimes a cautery is used for paralysis affecting the hand or foot, at the spine on the back where the nerves emerge which move that limb; and the paralysis is removed.
But this should not be undertaken unless by one wise in anatomy of the limbs, and in the emergence of nerves which move the body.
§ On the manner of cauterization in Albucasis.
Chapter 51.Et postea, quandoque stupet aliquod membrum, et curatur cum medicinis, sed non sanatur, quomodo debet fieri?
When the ulcer does not respond to any of the remedies of medicine, then cauterize it with a deep cautery, according to the thickness of the skin, until the white is removed and its colour changed.
Then treat it with flour of the herb, and lentils with oil of rose, and leaves of arnoglossa, and blood of a pigeon, and blood of a swallow: let there be one part of each; mix all these things together, and spread them on a cloth, and attach them in place until healed.
¶ Of the manner of cauterizing a Cancer.
Chapter 52.
When a Cancer is beginning, and you wish to check its growth: then cauterize it with a round cautery around it, as it turns.
But the wise say that it should be cauterized in the middle with the last cautery.Quod si non possit durare ad cauterizandum, tantummodo incide et fac citrinam.
But I do not approve of this, because I am afraid it will be wounded; and I have seen this happen more than once.Et si in medio alicuius corporis sit, non debet cauterizari. And if it is in the middle of the body, it should not be cauterized.It is better that it should be cauterized around its circuit with a circle, as we have said; or with many cauteries.Et si est in aliquo loco ubi non possit tolerare cauteria, sed debet scindere eum citrinam: et tangat citrinas cum oleo rosa: nam sic curabitur. A method for cauterization in the treatment of adbelatium.
Chapter 53.
When someone has an adbelatium and it is delayed in its maturation, either because of the excess making it, or due to the age of the patient when he is decrepit with little blood, or because of the time, and you want to hasten the maturation of the adbelatium, then cauterize around it with many small cauteries by pricking.
Then leave it.Si tamen non matureret per aliquid dies, tunc loquere cum medicis de cauterizant eam plene, vel faciant aliam.
Then it will hasten with ripening.
But if you wish to pierce it with a cautery, then heat the cautery, of which this is the form.
And lay it in the middle of Adubelat, until it penetrates the skin; and let the cautery be from that which follows the weak, so that the flow of the pure may be relieved.
Then treat it until it is healed.
¶ Of the manner of cauterizing in a corrosive ulcer. Chapter 42.
A corrosive is not unless there is a rot in the walking member, and it rots itself; just as fire eats dry wood.
If you see a corrosive in a place that will bear cautery with fire, then heat many cauteries, large and small according to what is fitting for that place in which there is a corrosive.
Then cauterize it from every part until you remove all the corruption completely, and nothing at all remains of it.Et si per accidens corrodens in loco qui non toleret cauterium cum igne posuerit: de te ad medicum. And if by chance a corrosive has come in a place that will not bear cautery with fire: go to the doctor.Then leave it for three days, and lay over the cauterized places ground sulfur with oil, until all the scars are eradicated, and all corruption.Et si escharae non eradiantur omnes et corruptio post triduum, uolute cauteria intra loca corrodentia, donec eradicentur escharae omnes, ut dixi.
Then treat it with ointments that promote flesh growth.
If then you see that after three days healthy flesh is growing, and there is no sign of decay, it is good.
And if not, then repeat the cautery over the remaining place where there is decay.
And when decay appears, treat it with sharp medicine.
For decay will arise in the place of cautery.Quam ob causam non debet fieri cauterium super locum corruptum post primum cauterium.
Nevertheless, the cautery with fire is more effective on a decayed place: and indeed I have already told you about the cautery treatment with sharp medicine in the previous section; so take it there when you need it.
On cauterizing Warts and Wens. Chapter 45.De cauteria uirga et pedice.
It often happens in the lower parts of the feet that this disease occurs; and it is a rough, ulcerated thing which injures the foot.Est enim in loco lacerum, sed profundum: non autem est carnis generans, si non corrodatur. There are two kinds of cautery for these: cautery with fire and cautery with hot water.
When done with fire the cautery should be like a hollow chicken feather in size; it must be made of iron and conform to the quantity contained by the claw from every side, and have fine edges.
Then put the hot cautery on the claw. Then rotate the hand with the cautery around the claw until the cautery reaches the bottom of the claw; then leave it for three days until pus begins to flow. Then apply a poultice made with bad silkworm cocoons ground with salt over the wound at night. It will thus be eradicated by its roots.
Then treat the place with a generative ointment of flesh, until it is healed.
If they are not converted and often occur on the surface of the body, especially on hands and feet, then administer cautery with hot water in them; it is done by taking a tube made of bronze, iron, or a chicken feather, and placing it over the claw or wart.
Then pour a little hot water into the tube; hold your hand and rotate it with slight pressure of your hand so that the edge of the tube is impressed on the root of the claw, and let the hot water find its way to the bottom, to the root of the claw; then let the sick person wait for a short time after the biting of the hot water.
Then leave it, for the claw will be eradicated with its roots.
Do so with all of them one after another, until you have come upon all who are on the body.
Then treat them after they are eradicated with that which generates flesh from ointment.Et si non curaris locum cum unguento generatiuo carnis, clauus non peruenerit ad finem: et si curaris post ut eradicantur, et non uti carnem genere in locis, uoluerunt iterum.
On cauterizing tremors.
De modo praeparandi balsamum ad cicatrizandum.
When someone has a tremor from coldness in the nerve, or from quartan fever, or another [cause], then one should cauterize it with four cauteries, or five above the vertebrae of the back, and between each vertebra with a cautery, and in his chest with a cautery, and over his stomach with a cautery.
For indeed the tremor quiets with an olive-oil cautery, and speedily health returns from coldness. On cauterizing by Al-Batrn.
De modo praeparandi balsamum ad cicatrizandum.Hic enim oportet ut facias cauteria in spondiles dorsi, et super stomachum cum oliuae, et super lumbos et nates, per tres dies, singulis diebus unum cauterium, et postea fiet salus.
When they are expelled from the body there result sores called "albatirs", that is to say, pustules, which arise from a putrid thick matter.
Therefore when they appear, it is necessary that they be cauterized all over the head of the pustule with a thin cautery made of myrtle wood whose tip has been heated by fire.
Or with the root of long aristolochia.
Or with a lentil-shaped cautery. And sometimes when cauterized the scabs, at the beginning of their expulsion in this manner: and not being increased; and broken is the superfluity making them, and it heals from them.
However, it is necessary that this be done after evacuation with bloodletting.Et si non possit expelli facies et corporis ex parte superior, displicet illud scabra frotando per se ad dolorem sufficienem, et ponatur super eum unguentum cum succo de acedonia, donec resorbatur facies, et sanatur.
And if it cannot be expelled the face and of the body from the superior part, scrape off that rough by itself to sufficient pain, and put upon it ointment with juice of buckthorn, until absorbed the face, and heals.
Chapter 58. Many times it happens that the flow of blood from an artery which is cut at a wound, which happened externally, or at the incision of an abscess, or cautery of a limb, and so on: and it becomes difficult to cut it off.Ergo si per incisionem cauterii seu apostematis non potest expelli fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, ponatur super eum unguentum cum succo de acedonia et cum aqua roseae, et in locis illius, quae suppurat, et in capite arteriae, quae suppurat, faciunt sigilla cum cerussim albam.
Therefore if the flow of blood from an artery cannot be expelled by cautery or incision, put upon it ointment with juice of buckthorn and with rose water, and in those places which suppurate, and in the head of the artery which suppurates, make seals with white chalk.When then it happens to someone that flow of blood from an artery not be able to be expelled by cautery or incision, quickly with your hand to the orifice of the artery, and put upon it your index finger; and squeeze it much, until blocked is the blood under your finger, and nothing go out from it.Et postea ponatur super eum compressio ligaturae per crucem cum spica cum ligno myrti, et faciunt sigilla in locis illius, quae suppurat, et in capite arteriae ut antea. Then put on the fire a cautery of small olive oil and several large ones, and blow over them until they are very hot.
Then take one or a few small or large ones from them, depending on the wound and the location where the artery is severed, and apply the cautery to the vein once you have quickly removed your finger; hold it until the blood stops.
If it is expelled when you raise your finger from the opening of the artery and the cautery goes out, then take another cautery quickly from the cauteries that are prepared on the fire. You must therefore continue doing this one after another until the blood stops.
And beware lest you burn the nerve that is there and a new illness occur over the wound. And you should know that when blood flows from an artery, then it is not possible to stop it, especially when the artery is large, unless with one of four cauteries.
Or with a cautery as we have said.
Or with extraction when it has not been extracted.Deinde cum sanguis fluat, facies de scybalo unum punctum: et ponas super eum digitum tuum et tuam manum, et tenes super illum remissius, donec sanguis expellatur festinanter, donec non possit ualiore exire. Then while the blood flows you will make a point from a scalpel and place your finger or hand over it, and you hold it over it more gently until the blood is expelled quickly so that it cannot exit strongly.For when it is extracted, its edges are drawn together, and the blood is stopped.
Then while the blood flows you will make a point from a scalpel and place your finger or hand over it, and you hold it over it more gently until the blood is expelled quickly so that it cannot exit strongly.For when it is extracted, its edges are drawn together, and the blood is stopped. Or it may be tied with a strong ligature.Et si ueniat sanguis de arteria, qui non posset depellere digitum tuum festinanter, et non possit extrahere: facies punctum super eam, et ponas super illum digitos tuos, et tenes remissius, donec sanguis expellatur.
Or they are placed over the medicine itself, of which is cut off the blood and bound with a suitable tight ligature.
He who administers the incision with a ligature and bandage, or the application of things burning and similar, does not thoroughly bring about a cure unless very seldom.
If however it should happen to any one and the doctor is not present, nor medicine: then he must begin by placing his index finger over the opening of the vein as we have described, and with a very strong constriction until blood is stopped from the upper part of the wound, and over the artery.
And let the finger not be removed from above it with very cold water always, until blood is frozen and grown thick and cut off.Et sic de caeteris uenisis per totum corpus, qui in iisdem regionibus sunt, faciendum est. And thus one must act concerning the other veins throughout the body which are in the same regions. And meanwhile he should reflect on what is needed from cautery or medicine.Namque si accipiat medicamentum, neque tamen possit, nec conveniat, tunc faciat cauterium: et aliter similes uenarum ostia.
The end of the first part.
Albucasis' Surgical Book, Part 2 On incision, piercing, and bloodletting for wounds and similar conditions.
We have already spoken in the first chapter of every disease in which fire and burning medicine is appropriate, and its occasions, causes, and instruments, and the forms of cauteries.Nunc ad omnes aegritudines quae sunt in qua conueniens est incisio, perforatio, et phlebotomia uel in his similibus. And there I placed the chapters from the vertex down to the foot.
And I will go in this chapter by that same way; so that he who seeketh it may find it. And before I begin it, you ought to learn, O sons, that which is in this chapter is the terror that is in the first chapter of cauterization.
And because of that it behooves that the caution in it be even more rigorous, since in the operation which is in this chapter there often falls a discharge with blood, with which stands life at the exposure of the vein, or incision upon an abscess, or exposure of a fistula, or cure of a wound, or extraction of an arrow, or incision over a stone, and similar things: from all of which is associated tremor, and fear, and falls in many of them death.
And I admonish you, let not that fall upon you in which there is hesitation; for sometimes men of one mode of men with modes of weakness come to you in this art.
For from them is he who rages with his sickness; and death is light to him because of the vehemence of that which he finds by reason of his sickness and length of its wickedness.Et alius est qui magnanime procedit et multum ueniat in malicia sua, et statim cadit mortuus ad pedes tuos: nam non potest tolerare uenturam eius quae est super eum.
And when the disease is from fear that signifies death.
And out of them is he who gives you a cup to drink, and enriches you with it, hoping for health from it, but its disease is lethal. You should not therefore agree with him who comes to you from them whose way is like this.
And let your caution be more fierce than your greed and your avarice.
And do not presume anything from him unless after certain knowledge that verifies with you what comes to you at which arrives the succession of praise.
And be used to cure all the sick among you with prognosis and indication of that to which it is convenient to be salvation.
For in him you have help over the acquisition of fame and glory, memory and praise.
May God inspire you sons with his understanding and not take from you guidance and inspiration; for it is in his hand.Et sicuti de ista re fuit salus super uos, ita etiam super omnes uos sint uirginitatis conseruationes: quoniam illud est prae omnium uirginitatum custodes.
And indeed I have ordered this Chapter distinguishing by Chapters according to that it precedes in the Chapter of Cautery from the neck until the feet: so that you be eased for you wish from it and that which you need.And you shall not take heed of the number of the chapters, but rather consider the use.
Of the cure of Water which collects in children's heads.
Chapter 1.De curatione ulcerum et albus quae fiunt post partum mulierum: et de curatione morborum quae sunt super os utrinque, scilicet: ex parte linguam et ex parte oris.
Know that this disease often happens to children at birth; or when the midwife squeezes the baby's head without gentleness.And this disease has two forms: on the tongue and on the mouth.It is on the tongue sometimes as an ulcer, and sometimes white, and the cure of it is as follows: you take a piece of red silk, and dip it in vinegar made from grapes, and tie it onto the tongue until it becomes a scar.
And it also happens sometimes because of an unknown cause which is not known.And this disease has two forms: on the tongue and on the mouth.It is on the tongue sometimes as an ulcer, and sometimes white, and the cure of it is as follows: you take a piece of red silk, and dip it in vinegar made from grapes, and tie it onto the tongue until it becomes a scar.
And indeed I have not seen this disease in others than children; and in all whom I have seen, death has been swift; therefore it was deemed best to me to abandon the operation on it.
And indeed I saw one of them, a boy whose head was filled with water and whose head became magnified every day, until he could not sit up on himself because of the size of his head; and the moisture increased until he died.
And this indeed moisture, or it is aggregated between the skin and the bone: or it is aggregated under the bone above the jaw.
And the operation on him, if there is moisture between the skin and the bone, and the pustule is small, then one should make an incision in the middle of the head, a fissure an inch wide: and the length of the fissure should be almost two inches, until the moisture runs out.
And this is the shape that is spatula-like.
If therefore the moisture is more augmented, and the pustule is larger, then place those two fissures according to this shape.
And if the moisture is under the bone, and its sign is that you see the joints of the head open on every side; and water is depressed when you press it with your hand to the inside, and it does not hide from you: then one should make three fissures in the middle of the head, in this way.
And after the incision, draw out all the moisture.
Then pour on it from above wine and oil up to the fifth day.
Then loosen the bandage, and care for the wound with dressings and ointments.Et illud fac ut uides signum humores in capitibus.
And do this as you see the signs of humor in the heads.And do not cease to bind the head tightly with equality.
And feed the patient every food dry of little moisture, until the limb is comforted and healed.
And another way of incision is, as you consider where there appears to be the size of the pustule, and the collection of water.Et illic facies unam incisionem per medio capitis usque ad apicem.
For whenever there is more in the nape, or in the forehead, or in the right, or in the left.
Therefore, go up with the incision where you see the boil and fill it with water; and split it according to what is possible for you.
And observe, lest you cut an artery and there be a flow of blood, and the sick person die from that flow with the evacuation of moisture.
¶ On cutting the arteries which are behind the ears.
CHAPTER 2.
When someone has a cataract on the eyes or on the chest and it does not respond to treatment with medicines, then the best final treatment for him is by cutting these two arteries.
It is necessary, therefore, when you wish to cut them, that the sick person tilt his head backwards.
Then chafe the place with a rough cloth so that the arteries may appear.Et sint tibi notae per singulas palpitations quae fiunt circa aures in capite.
Then the patient should bind his neck with one of his own kerchiefs.
Then consider where to press the vein.
And the places for both are the places which are behind the ears and are sunken in; and they are rarely concealed except in certain people.
Then mark with cautery on both sides; and cut both with a scalpel sharply on each side, the incision going towards the jaw; and let this be done across the width of the head.
And if you wish, insert the scalpel under the artery and cut it from above with an incision.
Let the length of the incision be about two joined fingers.
For when the vein is cut, blood issues in pulsating jets, which rise in frequent jumps to the interior parts.
But if the artery does not appear to the senses, then it is necessary that you measure from the ear the amount of space of three fingers.
Then mark with cautery and go all the way to the jaw.
And that which it is necessary to emit from blood is six ounces, and perhaps you will emit more or less from this. All of this according to the amount that appears to you from the patient's condition and filling of his artery.Et si illa non apparierit, fac ut pulsat ille sanguis cum pedalis palmo, ad modum qui supra docuit.
And if it does not appear, let him press the blood with a palm's length of a foot, in the manner that was taught above.Then consider the wound.
Then if something remains against the jaw, then cut that so that a hot abscess does not occur; then bind the wound with linen strips of flaxen cloth.Et si quilibet incolumis pulsat prope uulnus, finde illum cum puluere arcanum ut placet michi.
Then treat it with ointment until it heals.
¶ On extracting arterioles which are in ulcers.
CHAPTER III.
When a person suffers from a long-standing headache or acute catarrh due to moist humours and hotness in the temples, or an old sore throat, stubborn and similar to these: and he is treated with methods of medicine but it does not help; then we have experience in these diseases of extracting arterioles from the ulcers, or cauterizing them, as we have narrated.
And the method of operating on these is to shave the weak hairs which are in the temples and stretch towards the artery visible in the temple.Et cum pilo trahat arteriam usque ad os, donec sanguis fluat, et tunc lueret.
And with the hair he draws the artery to the mouth until blood flows and then he cauterizes it.Indeed, it shows itself to you from its pulse, and rarely is it concealed except in a few people, or by the vehemence of coldness.Et cum pulsaretis arteriam cum pollici, et tunc ostendatur pulsus, non debet extendi ad latus, sed ad medium usque ad os.
And when you pulse the artery with your thumb and then it is revealed, it should not be extended to the side but to the middle until the mouth.If it is concealed from you, then he should tighten his head with any of his clothes: then rub the place with a rough cloth.Et si non ostendatur pulsus, tunc faciat sicut antea dictum est in extractione arteriarum.
Or warm the spot with hot water until it becomes manifestly clear to you. Then take the spatulele which I formed just now a little earlier. Then shave away with it the skin easily, until you reach the artery.
Then insert a hook into it and pull it upward until you have pulled it out of the skin, and make it emerge from the tunics which are beneath it on every side.
If however, the artery is slender, then enfold it with the tip of the hook.
Then cut off a portion from its length in accordance with how much its ends are drawn out and tightened, so that no blood flow happens.
For if it is not cut and not removed, the blood does not go up completely.Et facies ut proferatur in parte superiori ad omnes partes. Then extract from blood six drachms, up to three days.
If the artery is large: then it is necessary to tie it in two places with a double thread, strong, of silk or of catgut so that putrefaction does not reach it before the wound has consolidated and thus there be no flow of blood.
Then cut away the superfluity which is between the two ligatures.
Do that in the hour itself or after another hour. And if you wish, cauterize it with a knife cautery up to the bone until its ends are cut and have settled in their place.
This is preferable unless the patient has fever or a hot complexion.Quod si non potes cauterizare: tunc oportet ut excidas eam cum bistortio, donec incidantur extremitates.
Since cauterization is one of the things that help to end moisture.
Therefore the remedy is better.
And after the extraction of the arteries, the place should be filled with old cooking, and decently made wads should be placed on top of it.
And after the solution is cured with dry medicines that cause the flesh to grow and with linseed until it heals.
If meanwhile during the operation there is a flow of blood from an artery, then quickly cut it off with a cautery, or fill the place with a sponge: and squeeze your hand shut until the blood is cut off.
If you have none of those things at hand, then put your finger over the place until the blood congeals.Et postea post solutionem curetur cum iuamentis siccis, quae faciunt carnem nasci, usque ad septimam diem: et postea finiat cura.
And embrocate the spot with water fiercely cold until the pain is appeased and the part is bound up as it should be.
And because it is gentler and easier to extract the artery, one should cauterize the vein with this cautery having two knives; let the keenness of both knives be similar to that of almug.
However, they are much less sharp than the two knives.
Because if they are as sharp as the two knives, both will quickly grow cold; and they will not cut the flesh with swiftness.Et qui cauterizat uenam, debeat esse uigilosum cultello, nec est uitius si non posset facere uelociter.
And he who cauterizes the vein ought to have a hot knife, and it is better if he cannot do it swiftly. When therefore there is in them a little grossness, heat of fire abides in them, and flesh is cut swiftly: with this therefore every work is better, easier, and gentler.
And let the space that is between the two knives be as much as a digit of grossness, after you have marked two places with cautery; and put aside both burning hot, until they reach to the bone, and cut the vein in two places: so that what is between its extremities may be drawn out.
For they are not with this cautery healed thoroughly.Et si est uena de qua libet extractio et ex ea luer, utrque cultellus debet inueniere locum eiusdem: ne postea uterque cultellus non cadat extra venam et non faciat mortem.
And this is the form of cauterization.
¶ Of the cure of acute and constant running tears from the eyes.
CHAPTER IV.
When there are constant tears and the flow of them comes from the veins which are on the exterior surface of the skull; and medicine brings nothing to it, and you see that the face of the patient is already red, and he feels an aching in his forehead as if there were a crawling like that of ants; and his eyes are exhausted, moist, so that their eyelashes are now worn away by corrosion: and his eyelids are heated by the keenness of the tears: then the ancients resorted to the cure of them by this operation, and they named this cure cauterization.
And it is so that you should direct the patient to shave the hairs which are on his forehead.
Then make three cuts in the forehead equally distant according to the length of the forehead; and let the length of each cut be two fingers; and let one cut be equidistant with the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, and the second a little according to the length from the movement of the lizards, and the third on the other side: and beware lest you cut the arteries which are in the two sides: and stretch out your hand from the continuance of the two mandibles, and let the space of all the cuts be three joined fingers; and have ready for you a piece of sponge, or of dry cloth, with which you will dry up the blood.
Then introduce spatulae of two acute ends, of which the following is the form.
From the cut which is from the part of the temple up to the second cut; and strip with it all the skin which is between the two cuts, with that which is above the bone.Et sit spatula ex ferro, aut e quo libet tibi: et excoria cum eo totum os quod est super labrum, usque ad os quod est supra maxillam superiorem: et incide in labrum cum spatulo, et trahe cutem in extremitatem labris, ut sit cutis lachrymarum in extremitate. Then do that as well from the middle incision up to the second incision.
Then take out this spatula and insert into the first cut again another instrument called a sharp scalpel gently from one side not sharply from the other.
And this is its shape.
And place its sharp side towards the flesh and its blunt side towards bone: and push it in until it reaches the middle fissure; and cut with it all vessels that descend from the head to the eyes, except what is continued by the incision up to what appears of skin.
Then do this in the middle fissure up to the other fissure.Et fac illum modum iterum et tertium.
And do that mode again and thirdly.And after there flows out an equal amount of blood, press the places from clotted blood.Post qua praemissa omnia fiunt ueniant in locum, quo non est fissura ad modum latus lene uersus os et latus acutum vrsus carnem annexam cum cute: et impelle latus lene sub ossa et latus acutum super carnem. After which all these precedings are performed, let them come to a place where there is no fissure in the manner that the blunt side is towards bone and the sharp side towards flesh; and push the blunt side under bones and the sharp side over flesh.Then place in every fissure some lint from old cooked linen, and place over it little bits moistened with wine, or oil, or vinegar.Et fac ut sint super se omnia, et post qua praemissa fiunt, et olea inter impertita fiunt, et uino, aut aceto per dies octo, vel decem.
And see that no hot pustule occurs.
On the third day loosen the bandage and administer a copious infusion with warm water.
Then treat it with basilicon ointment and other things with which wounds are treated until it is healed.
CHAPTER ON THE TREATMENT OF ACUTE TEARS AND CATARACTS IN THE EYES FROM DISORDERS IN THE HEAD.
This is the end of the chapter.
When acute cataracts occur, sharp and constant, and you see the eyes are worn out, small, and already weakened in appearance; and the eyelids are ulcerated, and the hairs fall from them; and there is acute pain in the depth of the head, painful, and consequent sneezing: then take from among these accidents that which matter, and the cataracts do not come, unless from many veins.
And a better treatment for them is this.Quamuis accidat ad oculos alicuius catarrum acutus: non debes tantum per uenam et unctionem curare, sed necessarium est ut clysteris illum ex oculis aduersus nasum: nam proficiscuntur a saporibus et humoribus corruptis in profundum capitis.
And it is, as you should command, to shave the forehead of the sick person.
Then make an incision in the middle of the forehead, or slightly to one side, and begin with the cut from the left temple to the right temple; and let the incision be up to the bone: and extend your hand from the wrist of the temples, which move upon mastication: until when the bone is uncovered: and you will dry up all the blood with a sponge.
Then separate between the two lips of the incision with a cooked veal, or with bands out of linen.
Then bind it up from above with bandages; and moisten the bandages with wine and oil, lest a hot ulcer come on.
And when you loosen it, and see that the cold ulcer is about to go away: then you ought to scrape the bone, until flesh begins to grow on it.Quod si non facere possis, quia utrumque os inter se adhaerit: moliendas illum postea cum liciniis ex lino: et puluistis cum oleo et uino: et uiso quod fuit apostema, facies super eam unam linteam et super eam plastrum.
If you cannot do this, because both bones adhere to one another: then you must grind it afterwards with bands of linen; and bandage it with oil and wine; and when the ulcer is seen, make over it a lint and over that a plaster.Then take care of it with a drying regimen which makes flesh grow in these wounds, as if you take from wheat flour two parts, and from colophony four parts: and prepare an ointment out of them, and apply it to the birth of flesh in these wounds.
¶ Of the cure for that which falls into the ear.Postea quando incipiet crescere carnem, et uides quod uenit ad maturitatem: et uides quod carnis lues cadit in aurem: tunc oportet ut elonges manum tuam intra aurem usque ad os, et frices illud. Chapter VI.De cura quorundam morborum per ungenti. Of the cure of certain diseases with ointments.Everything That falls into the ear is one of four kinds: either a mineral stone, or like a stone, as iron and vitriol; or it is from a plant, as pea and bean; or it is a fluid thing, as water, vinegar and their likes; or some animal.Et quicquid cadit in aurem non debet esse adhaesum: sed cum puluillis debet elungi ut antea dictum est.
When therefore a stone falls into the ear, or a kind of stone from those which are not added, nor grow in the ear, expose the ear to the sun: if therefore thou seest the stone, then distill into the ear something of oil of violets, or sesame.
Then administer its extraction, and cause sneezing with pepper, and stop up the nostrils at the approach of sneezing, after you have placed around the ear rags of linen or wool, and stretched out the ear towards the upper part.
For often it will come out with this care.
If however it does not come out, then administer its extraction with the forceps of the Arab physicians, which are very subtle; and the form of them is this:
If therefore it comes out with the forceps, it is well.Aliter tamen facias extractionem eius in hac guisa.
Otherwise however you shall make its extraction in this way:And if not, then administer its extraction with a very subtle blind hook of few doublings. If therefore it does not come out by that, then make a tube of brass, and insert the end of the tube far into the hole of the ear, and stop up what is in the circuit of the tube with softened wax with oil, so that there may be no wind-way except the tube: then draw out with your strong attraction. For often it will come out with that which we have mentioned.Si ergo non egreditur per illum, tunc extrahe eam cum uncino caeco duplici, id est, bicephalo.
If therefore it does not come out by that, then draw it out with a blind double hook, that is, two-headed.But if it does not come out thus: then take from helkalimbat, or from visc, that is, the gluten prepared, with which birds are caught, a little quantity: and put that in the end of the rod after you have wrapped over it decently a piece of cloth; then insert that into the hole of the ear with ease, after you have dried the ear from moisture.
If therefore it does not come out with all which we have mentioned, then hasten to splitting, before there happens a warm wound, or a cramp.
And the manner of the fissure is that one should take the phlebotome first in the weak and in the cephalic: and draw out from it blood according to the measure of its strength.
Then cause the weak person to sit between your hands, and turn his ear upward, and find a small fissure at the root of the ear near its fat in a depressed place; and let the fissure be in the shape of a crescent until you reach the stone: then remove it with that, which is possible for you from among the instruments.
Then open the fissure quickly and carefully by your hour, until it is healed.
If what has fallen into the ear is a single grain that grows and inflates, then administer its extraction.
But if it does not yield to you for exit, then take a thin, flexible spatulum according to this form:
And administer with it the abscission of that species from the grains which have fallen into the ear, and do not do this when you think that the grain is already moistened by the vapor of the ear, until you put it several times; then draw it out with hooks, or with a thin staff, or with suction, as we said, for the extraction of it is eased.
But as to the water which goes into the ear, one should use the weak person with sneezing at first; and he has already filled his ear with some cooked vinegar: and he is lying on that ear, in which there is water.Et postea quiescat super illam circa minutum quintum: et iterum resuecet aurem suam cum aqua, donec fit ut dicatur, quod non est in ea sanguis: deinde sit quiescentia aures suae.
If it will therefore come out through that, it is good.
And if not: then take many stones according to the length of the finger, thin, smooth, and heat them a little with fire, and let the sick person put one of them into the hole of his ear; and stamp with another stone upon that which is in the ear on that side, and with another stone upon the other which is in the other ear.
He therefore shall not cease doing this with a stone and with a stone until all the water goes out.
And now the water is coming out like this, take a feather, or a reed, and put one end of it into the ear; and light the other end with fire until it burns much of it.
Then take another reed and do this many times until all the water goes out; and draw it out with a tube according to that which has been said before in the stone.
But if an animal is going into it as a flea and one like it of small body, take care for it as I have said before concerning the division.
But if it is a body of large size, which appears to the sense: then make use of its extraction with tweezers and hooks; and this is much easier for all that are held in the ear.Et de hac clysteris si non est extrahens per illam, et non apparuit corpus in facie, sed intus versatur, fac illum iterum sicut dixi.
But if this enema is not extracted through it, and the body has not appeared on the face but is turning inside, do that again as I have said.But when you are treating a worm bred in the ear, whenever you make use of it with what we have said in the division, and in the tractate of distillations, and your treatment brings no result: then it is necessary to look at the ear in the sun.Et si uides in facie eius maculas, aut maculas, sicut diximus, et non apparuit corpus, ut possis extrahere: fac iterum clysterem sicut ante diximus.
If therefore something appears inside, then extract it with tweezers or with fine hooks.
If nothing appears inside, then take a tube which is narrow below and wide above, and insert its thin end into the ear according to the amount it can tolerate it, being weak; then suck with strong suction.
Do that many times until all the worms come out.
If they do not obey you to go out, then smear the tip of the tube with honey, as I said on the stone.
If they do not go out with what we have said, then administer the distillations which the ancients have already experienced for worm infections; and you will find that in the treatise on distillation.
And may your pouring be as when you pour oils and medicines into the ear with this instrument, of which its form is pictured here.
As you see, make it out of silver or brass, narrow below with a small hole, wide above.
Let the plug which is in the hollow of the tube be decently made of brass.Omnia ergo haec facite cum magistro uermium: et diuersas experirete uocem ad auertendum uermes.
And if you wish, accept the radish, and wrap its end with a decent bandage; then pour oil or juice, or whatever you like from these remedies into the tube; and let it be in the ear; then push the radish from above with the bandage, and squeeze it with your hand in a tempered compression until the oil is pressed into the concavity of the ear, and the sick person feels it inside; and that which is poured into the ear, let it be somewhat warmed by fire; and beware that what is distilled into it be not very cold, for medicine does not tolerate this.
Here begins the chapter on the treatment of accidents of the ear:
Here begins Chapter VII.
Sometimes infants emerge from their mothers' wombs unpierced.
And it has also happened to some men that they have had an obstruction in the ear from a wound or from flesh growing in it.
And this obstruction sometimes occurs in the depth of the hole of the ear, which the probe cannot reach; and sometimes it happens at the outer part of the hole, and the probe can reach it.
Therefore that which occurs in the depth of the ear, and which sight cannot reach, is difficult to cure in many conditions.Et quod in foramine Auris accidit paulo ante exteriorem partem, etiam dificile sanari est, et non nisi per magnam industriam: sed si omnino possit curari, necessarium est ab eo qui habet eam, ut uigilet illum locum diu, et post multum tempus trahat eum ad suum finem.
And when you are going to make an incision, place the gold on the sick person in the sun and look at it; then if you see a white appearance, open it with a very fine spatulum whose shape is this that follows, let its end be in which there is some small breadth, of which some part is acute: and let the rest of the spatulum be of two smooth sides: so that it does not hurt the ear.
If then there is an ulceration from flesh grown in the passage of the ear: then hold it with a fine hook, and cut it with ease forcefully, until all the flesh is removed.
If then the ulceration is in the depth of the ear; then take a slender rod, smooth, and warm it a little with fire; then let fall it into the passage of the ear.
If then you feel an obstruction with that, which the sick person has found with the heaviness of hearing; try the opening of it with ease and beware lest you wound the nerves of the ear.
Then put into the ear a little lead according to the quantity of the amplitude of the foramen, which you have enveloped in Egyptian ointment; do this for several days until you are sure that the wound is healed.
Or take lead and pour it into rosewater, and pulverize over it powdered chalk, and use it.
If then you see that the ear is now becoming scabs; then you ought to extract the lead and let it remain with another lead which you have enveloped in cerate made with rose oil until the scab has settled warm; then cure it until it is healed.
But if there is a flow of blood; then immerse sponge or rags in cold water and place over it the ear and use what remains of the cure which stops the flow of blood as predicted in the article on distillations.Et si fluxus sanguinis non sit superius, sed intrinsecus: et intuearis per meatus aurem cum speculo, et videas carnem rubrescentem intra foramen: tunc oportet ut facias ligaturam aurem et petas sibi curam praedictam.
On the care of eyelid tumors.
Of the eighth chapter. These tumors which occur in the eyelids of the eye are sometimes moist and sometimes dry.Si ergo sint humidi, cum sanguine intus habent et rubescunt.
You should therefore hold them with tongs, or with a hook and cut them with a spatula from their roots.
Then put on the crushed places of the skin.
If blood flows from them, then cauterize them with a small lenticular cautery.
And it is better to cauterize them after the incision.
Many times indeed they come back when something remains from its roots.Et quod ad ova testudinis pertinet: si inveneris in ovibus, quae non possunt tolerare cauterium, sed debent esse extrahenda per incisionem cum spatulato et postea cauterizanda.
And when they are cauterized with fire, those roots will be burnt and will not return.
¶ On the treatment of sties on the eye-lid.
CHAPTER 9.
It often happens that something which resembles a granule in its strength and hardness occurs in the eyelids, and on account of this it is called a granule; and it is an accumulation of thick moisture in the upper and lower lids.Et causa huius morbi est humidus calidus in palpebra, qui cum est superabundiis, apparet in exteriori parte palpebrarum.
The cause of this disease is hot moisture in the lids; when it becomes excessive, it appears on the outer parts of the eyelids. The operation on these is that you should then look to see whether there is a granule proceeding from what appears on the eyelid and moving to all parts, and its nature is easy.Et quando cauterizantur cum igne, comburuntur illae radices, et non redeunt.
Therefore find the crack over it in breadth.
Then scrape it from all sides easily, until it is cleansed.
Then hang it with a hook, and cut it off.
But if you do not prepare its cutting off unless after you have penetrated the eyelid a little with an incision, then it hurts the weak person.
If however the crack is large; then collect it with a suture and take care of it until it is healed.
And if it is small, no harm will come to you from it.
A ointment indeed restores it and fleshens it.Quod si vis operari per incisionem: reserare ipso locis ad sutram.
If you wish to operate by an incision: resew the place to the suture.And if it is turned towards the inside of the ear and a small part has become turned inside out, then turn the eyelid over backwards, and hang the granulation with a hook; apart from which you will need an incision, and press it from all sides.
If the eyelid is elongated by an incision, that does no harm to anyone.Et quicquid superabit de granulatione post sutram factam, incide eam cum skalpelio.
And whatever remains of the granulation after the suture is made, cut it with a scalpel.Then wash the eye after the granulation has been cut, with salted water; and take care of the place until it fleshens.Et si post incisionem granda est, et non potest in palpebram incarnari: deinde incide eam cum skalpelio.
And if after the incision it is large and cannot be fleshened into the eyelid; then cut it with a scalpel.¶ Of the cure of the eyelids by Axirnath.Et si granda est in interiori parte palpebrae, et non potest essere incarnata: deinde scinde eam usque ad os cum scalpelio, et trahe eam in exteriorem partem palpebram: et postea reserare eam.
And if it is large on the inner side of the eyelid and cannot be fleshened into it; then cut it to the bone with a scalpel and draw it towards the outer part of the eyelid; and after that sew it up.Chapter 10.De cura ovorum ex quibus fiunt magni, utpote si cadant in oculum, aut in nasum, aut in os, vel in auris.
Axirmath is an adipose substance that is generated in the eyelids of the upper eyelid; and it most often happens to boys, and it makes their eyes heavy, and they get cataracts in the mornings, and they cannot see the light of the sun because of this, because the tears flow towards them, and you may see them always lying on their faces and sleeping over them, and their eyelids are wet under their eyebrows, which is already closed by swelling; and an eminent Axirmath indeed appears to the eye, and when you press the place with your fingers, you feel the Axirmath between them.Et quod superest de eorum, trahitur et cadit in palpebras: et illa facies cadendo illius generat maculas, et uisum illius est, quasi esset oculus in oculis.
And the mode of its operation is that he should place his feeble head in your lap.
Then take a linen cloth and prepare in it a poultice, and make of that poultice a bandage according to the quantity which Axirmath contains on every side.
Then place it upon that, and press it with your fingers on all sides, so that the Axirmath may be collected in the middle of the bandage.
Then find in the middle of that moisture with the point of a spatulum, an entrance to the slits across the width; and let not the slit be larger than that which is made in phlebotomy in the depth.
Or you must find the skin all around until you come to the Axirmath; for in many dispositions the Axirmath proceeds from the slit according to the shape of a white, fat lump.
Therefore draw it out with the cloth, which you have inserted between your fingers to the outside; and you will turn your hand to the right and to the left, until it is dispersed: and beware lest you add in the slit, that you do not come with the spatulum to the eye and injure it.
But if the Axirmath does not appear to you at first in the slit, then you will add a little more easily into the slit until the Axirmath proceeds.
Then draw it out, as we have said.
Then immerse the bandages in vinegar and water, and place them upon the part, and bind it with plasters.
And there are men who rub salt, and place it in the hollow of the slit, that what remains from that moisture may be liquified.
Then treat it until it is healed.
But if a warm ulcer happens in the place, then treat it with soothing plasters until it is healed.
Of ways of Ataxmir (clouding) of the eye, that is, when the eyelid is molified, from which it becomes clouded as it ought not.Si autem in oculis eorundem manent filacria, quae vident utrumque contra, sicut non debet:
Chapter 11.
When hair grows in the eyelids beyond their natural bounds beneath the natural lashes and becomes ingrown, then it hurts the eye and causes diseases such as constant tearing, inflammation of the eyelids, and a film over the eyeball until it results in blindness.
And indeed Ataxmir is cured according to four ways. Or by cautery with fire.
Or with a sharp instrument as mentioned in the chapter on cautery. Aut cum medicina moxa.
Or it is cured with an incision and a suture.
Or by means of tubes, as I shall say.
You should place the patient's head in your lap.Si erumpat sanguis multus, et cito coagulatur, debes scire quod non potest curari.
If a lot of blood flows out and quickly coagulates, you should know that it cannot be cured.Then turn the eyelid of the eye with your left hand.
If it turns then it is good.Si non posset conuerti, debes scire quod oculi in oculis eius mortuos sunt.
And if it cannot be turned, you should know that the eyes in his eye are dead.And if not: insert a needle into where the hair is at the bottom of the eyelid, and let the needle pass through with the thread from above, and let it be close to the hairs themselves, that is, close to the edge of the eyelid, where the hairs grow; and pull the thread toward the upper [lid], and turn it with the needle.
Then find inside the eyelid under the added hairs from the tear duct, the larger one to the smaller one.Et si non possit inventari intra palpebram, fac in exteriori parte oculi et conuerte.
Then extract the thread and place a little cooked linen or cloth under the eyelid. Then mark on the eyelid with cautery, in the shape of a myrtle leaf.
However, it is appropriate that the shape be done according to the amount and elevation of the eyelid, because it differs in different people.
For there are those who need a large amount to be removed from the eyelid according to the amount that is softened by the eyelid.Et sunt alii, qui non indigent ut tanto incidatur, immo parvo. Then find the middle between the two lines you marked and begin from the larger tear duct to the smaller one, and let there be a single slit near the natural lashes, as is the thickness of a hair.Et sint lachrymalia ut in figura, et non omnia per unum punctum.
Then insert a hook in one of the two angles of the skin. Then peel it completely. Then bring together the two lips with a stitch, with a needle and fine wool; and wipe away the blood, and make to adhere that which hangs over the two eyebrows, with some glues, if you wish to do so: and if not, do not worry about it.
Then leave the stitch and thread for three or four days; afterwards care for it. And if you wish, leave the wound without a stitch, and care for it with that which dries and constricts.Et postea fac ut excoriet: et postea, si quid est in illo, quod non placet tibi, exscinde, et omnia dura in illa parte, cum scenis; et cura illud.
For the eyelid will be lifted at the site of the wound and its joining; but it will be better later on.
This is the way that the ancient doctors used to treat this.
However, there is anxiety about the patient and it comes from good surgery and not from fear.Et tamen de his operibus non debet medicus loqui nisi cum medicus et prudens.
And there is another method in Ataxmir as well, and that is to make a sign over the eyelid in the shape of a myrtle leaf, as we have described it.
Then lift the eyelid with three separated or joined hooks according to this form that follows and then cut away what is superfluous with small scissors according to this form with an equal incision.
If however you are not able to hold the hook and it does not fit well then take a needle with thread and insert it in the middle of the figure; and also take another thread near the larger tear duct and the third thread near the smaller tear duct, and bring together between your fingers the threads with equality.
Then lift up your hand with an equal elevation; and lift up the skin above where the cut is as we have described it.
Then bring together the two lips of the wound with a stitch; and treat it until it is healed.Et modus alius est in Ataxmir etiam: et est ut signes super palpebram figuram quae sit sicut figura folii myrti sicut narrauimus.
If however an ulcer occurs at your incision or split; put to rest that ulcer with caustic and similar remedies of soothing ointments.Et si non possit esse curatum per utramque cotem: tunc agite intra cotem super apicem apostematis cum cerate ad sedandum, et cum oleo campestris, et oleo ricini, et oleo nisi, et oleo almyro, et oleo oleasteris.
And sometimes it happens to the eyelids too, as they turn over the hairs of them.
Of the care of Ataxmir with dogs.
AND It is, that you turn over the eyelid, and split the crack which is within, according as I related.
Then with skill make two reeds or two thin splinters of wood, whose length is according to the length of the eyelid, and their breadth is less than the breadth of a spathula; and you already cut into the extremities of both parts on either side where you hold the hairs.
Then unite both with subtlety over that which overhangs from the eyelid of the eye, and tighten both reeds with a strong ligature on both parts, and leave it for several days. For the skin which is bound will die, and become blackened, and rot, until it falls off of itself.
If therefore it is delayed, then cut it with a pair of scissors.Post modum autem post mortem cutis, subtrahe cannas ab utraque parte.
Then after some time, after the death of the skin, remove the reeds from both parts.
When therefore it is healed, lift up the eyelid; and they do not sting.
And this is the shape of two reeds which you will make according to this figure and quantity as to length and breadth.
Of the raising of the stinging hairs in the eye with a needle.
Chapter 12.De palpebra in quo sunt pili pungentes, et qui est in oculis.
Of the eyelid where there are stinging hairs and which is in the eyes.The operation upon it is that you take a slender needle and thread into it a slender thread of silk smoothly. Then tie its extremities together and the two knots tightly with a slender knot; and let the length of the threads be one palm.Deinde agere cum ea debes per oculum, donec percutias omnia pili quae pungunt.
Then you must act with it through the eye until you pierce all of the stinging hairs.Then weave into Alinxotati another slender thread below it in a little, and tie its extremities if you wish.Hic est finis operationis de palpebra eorum quae pungunt per oculum cum filo serico, et modo quod descripsit.
Then let the invalid place his head in your lap, and be so near the light that the operation can be seen, for it is a minute and delicate operation.
Then insert the needle with the thread through the root of the eyelid, and let it penetrate quickly into the eyelid until you extract it above the natural eyelash.
Then draw out the needle up to the level of the thread; and insert that thread into the eyelid - if there is one, or two, or three, not more.
Then draw your hand away with it, until the thread emerges from the eyelid with the natural eyelash.
If the eyelash is pulled out, and the thread does not emerge with it; pull at the lash towards the bottom, along with the thread which you have tied in it, until the lash emerges from the upper hole and you see the edge of the eyelid; then you pull at the lash and the thread; and extract both, and close the eye: and leave it closed for two or three days, until the flesh adheres to its place, and grows over it.
If the lash is short, then attach to it a long hair from the natural lashes, and lift it with that; or leave it until it becomes longer after a space of time, and then lift it.
¶ Of the wound which happens to the upper eyelid.Deinde facis utrosque pilos intrinsecus ut sint apposita et conglutinata, donec crescant et adhaerant locum.
Then you make both lashes lie inside each other and stick together, until they grow and adhere to their place.Head XIII.De cura quae accidit in palpebra inferiori.
When this happens to the eye, it is called a Leporin.
And this Alxatrati is either natural or accidental.
Accidental therefore it becomes from the hardening of a wound, or cutting, or cauterization, and similar to these.
And the way of operating on it is that you find that hardening and separate its lips and place in what is between them a piece of linen from flax, and bind it, until it heals.
And it is not right that you should use in its cure things which dry and constrict: for if you do this, the Alxatrati returns worse than it was: rather use in it things which soften, as fenugreek: and embrocate with water, in which althea has been cooked, flax-seed: and anoint with a diachylon ointment, which has been liquefied with some of the oils: and wind around it with the linen, and cure it with that.
And your treasure of cure is, that you apply every art, that it may not harden, according to the form which it was at first.Quod si non facis, redit tibi in oculum Alxatrati, et durabit usque ad mortem.
And this indeed operation which we have said is not but a certain rectification of the Alxatrati, that it may not return to the form of the place according to what it was at all.Et si non curatur, durabit usque ad mortem. ¶ Of the cure of an Alxatrati which is done in the lower eyelid, and it is a wrinkling or contraction upwards to the right and left:Et haec curatio est facilis, ut te poscas quod non sit exiccatio palpebrae, aut res quaedam in ea locata: nam si ergo est in ea res quaedam locata, et non exiccatio palpebrae, bene est.
Chapter XIV.
This Alxatrati which is done below, is what is truly called Alxatrati.
And it is natural and accidental.Et prima significat per se, et secunda per accidens.
And the accidental one happens from a wound, or a split, or a caustic, and similar things.Et naturalis, siquid in membra corporis per naturam ueniat.
And the natural one, if something comes to the limbs of the body by nature.And the way of operating on it is, that you take an needle, in which there is a double thread, and you immerse it in meat, and you make it penetrate from the tear left up to the right tear, until the thread penetrates both ends of the flesh.Et postea trahas filum per duas lachrymales, et facias carnem iungieris, ut faciat cicatricem: et sic debet fieri in omni vulnerata carne, donec concrescat.
Then extend the flesh upwards with a pointed instrument and cut it with a broad spatula.
If then the shape of the eyelid returns to what is appropriate, that is good.
And if not, take a needle and place it in the slit, and turn it with the eyelid; and find two slits on the inside of the eyelid, and let the ends of the two slits be from the two corners of the incision, until they meet and make an angle from them: until when they are brought together, there is a figure of them, this is the Greek letter lambda.
Then remove that flesh by the amount which is the sharp lower side from that which follows the eyelid.
Then bring together the separated parts: sew it up with a thread of wool.Et postea uti debes, donec curent, et resutura debes cum filo iute.
Then treat them with the remedies which we have mentioned, the demulcent drugs and poultices, until they are healed.
And if the Alxatrati happens from a split, and sewing, or cautery: then you must find the split flat under the eyelashes of the eyelids, also according to what came before.
Then separate between the two lips with a poultice, as we said.
And the whole speech about the treatment of Alxatrati, when it is from above or below, is that the operation should run in it according to what is prepared out of the form of Alxatrati.
She herself has many variations in form: and the wise artisan prepares skill with any way that is possible for him, until he returns to make a figure into its natural shape, or close to it, and the patient himself, according to what is convenient for him out of the operation and instruments in many dispositions.
¶ Of the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva, or the cornea.Quemadmodum tamen potest esse quod per deffectus, vel defectus, vel mutationes quodammodo conglutinatio palpebrarum adhaererit, et illae ad unam aliam: et praecipue cum adhaererint cum corno oculi, ut possit facere oculus visionem.
Chapter 15.De oculis et viciis eorum, et de oculis caecis, et de pulvere oculorum, et de lachrymis quae procedunt ab oculis: et de oculis in omni vicio: et de luis oculi et de quodam malacio oculi: et de oculis per oportet operari cum cauterio.
Whenever this consolidation happens to many people, so as to consolidate the upper eyelid with the white of the eye, and prevent it from its natural operations.And sometimes this consolidation happens in many men, so that it consolidates with the lower eyelid, and prevents it from performing its natural operations.Et praecipue cum oculus debet esse in medio, et operari inter duos: quoniam est impossibile ut oculus similes sit duobus oculis.
You must therefore insert the end of the probe under the eyelid and lift it up; or extend it with a hook; then cut the adhesion with a thin spatula, which is not sharp like the spatulae used for cutting, but rather somewhat blunt: so that the patient is not distressed during the operation, and the spatula removed and the eye harmed by its sharpness; and your incision should be as if you were excising that adhesion with ease, until when the eyelid returns to its natural shape, and the whole adhesion heals.
Then drop salt water into the eye, or distil it from a sieve made by dissolving ziniar in water.
Then separate the eyelid from the eye with a flaxen thread; and place over the eye wool infused with white wine; and on the third day use the syrup and with solids until it heals.
Of the incision of the claw and prominent flesh of the tear duct.
Chapter 16.
You should know that the nail is according to two modes. Or it is nervous; and it is like a tough, subtle membrane.Aut autem carnosa: et prominentia est carnosa subtili.
Or it is fleshy; and prominent with subtle flesh.Or else it is not nervous, like white frozen moisture; which when it touches an iron needle, or you try to seize it with a hook, it is cut off, and the hook does not stick to it.Et sic est subtilis et parum tenax.
And both kinds do not begin unless from a greater tear, until it goes slowly, until it covers the sight and prohibits light and movement of the eye.
The way of doing this cut is: he puts his weak head in your lap.
Then open his eyes and raise the eyelid with your hand.Cum ergo palpebra uenerit, et uideo, stetitque lachryma in oculis, et non fluat, accipito lacrimam per digitos tuos, et trahe eam ad narem.
When the eyelid comes down and he sees and the tear stands in his eye and does not flow, take the tear with your fingers and draw it towards the nose. Then collect the eyelash with a hook of a few doublings and extend it towards the upper part.
Then take a needle and insert into it a hair from the horse, or ox, or cow; and let the thread be strong, and bend the end of the needle slightly, and fix it in the middle of the eyelash: and pierce it with the needle and tie it up with the thread; and extend it towards the upper part; and scrape with the hair the side of the lash that follows the pupil, as if you were squeezing it with a hair to its end.
Then cut off the rest at the root of the tear duct with a fine spatulum or small forceps; and leave the flesh of the tear duct alone so that not happen after the cutting a constant flow of tears.Et si uisum non cooperierit, et lachryma non erueritur: incide eam iterum usque ad sanguinem.
And if the sight does not return and the tear is not extracted, cut it again until blood comes out. And sometimes the eyelash is extended only with a hook; or with thread as we said.Et si postea lachryma non erueritur: incide eam iterum usque ad sanguinem.
Then it is scraped with a gentle spatula of this shape.
Take care that the spatula does not touch the horny tunic, lest it be torn and the pupil be perforated.
Then, after the incision, throw into the eye something of powdered salt or an ointment made from vitriol, and leave it until another day.
Then treat it with what is appropriate, until it heals. If the nail is not brittle and you cannot get a needle into it, nor can you drive in an awl, then this kind of nail is often treated with remedies, and it heals as I have described above.Quod si ungula est contraria, et non potest curari cum medicinis simplicibus, tunc fac de ziniar unctionem, et olevine, et oleum, et mel rosatum, et mercuriales, et terra lemorum, et spatulamimis modio et dimidia.
If the nail is contrary and cannot be treated with simple remedies, then make an ointment of vitriol, olive oil, honey, rose water, mercury, earth of fullers, and spatulas of a half ounce.If you wish to cut it, then open the eye of the patient and take a slender, blunt-tipped spatula in this shape
and scrape the nail smoothly from above with precision.
If you see that it is made thin and brittle, and the rasp makes an impression on it, then distil into the eye from your hour glass an ointment made of vitriol, or red vitriol, or powdered salt; and close up the eye until another day.Deinde cura ipsum oculum sicut dixi tibi in divisione.
Then repeat over it the same operation until all of it is removed.
Unless you see a hot pustule in the eye; then leave it alone and treat the pustule until it is healed. Then repeat the operation on it with reason until it is healed.
However, if a protrusion of the tear sac is causing great pain in the eye, it should be suspended with a hook and cut from that part; and do not finish the cutting, so that tears will not flow.
Then put a drop in the tear sac of red copper sulphate, or one made from verdigris, until it is healed. On the cutting of Algardene and flesh born in the eye.
Chapter 17.
Sometimes in some men's eyes there is born a red flesh composed, or superimposed, until it covers the pupil, or approaches, or draws tight above the eyelids, and perhaps turns the eyelids outward. And it is like a rose ball.
And there is also an operation on it, that he puts his feeble head in your lap.
Then open his eyes and collect all that flesh with suitable hooks for it; and hold it with one pair of forceps, or hold it with your fingers.
Then cut the flesh first, until you finish all of it with a cutting knife.
And beware of the eye so that you do not harm it during the operation; and let your incision be either with a spathe, which we mentioned in the incision of the fingernail, or with small forceps, with which asebel is collected, according to what will come after this chapter.
When then your incision is completed, and all the algardene is removed, then fill the eye with powdered salt; or drip into it red powder, and similar things made from corrosive medicines; and place on the eye a patch of white linen with egg white: so that it will be secure from hot pustules.
If something remains in the wound and you are dominated by hot blood and you fear a hot ulcer, then leave off the eye and treat it with that which calms the ulcer.
Then repeat over it with the surgery, until it is healed.
And likewise do with meat added which happened in the eye of this kind.
However, you should remove all cure of a weak eye from the natural way or from the accidental way, operating with the iron: and do not introduce your hand in any of these operations until you see that that limb is bearing that operation.
Of collection of pus from an eye.
Chapter 18. Seals are red veins which are woven over the eye, and prevent the sight from performing its operation; and weaken the eye with the length of days.And they are four seals which are around the white of the eye, and they go up to the eyelids. And the cause of them is heat which has gone up from the body, and has not been able to go out by the natural way: but it went out upwards by the accidental ways, because these ways were opened for it. So the heat gathered in that place, until it became pus which is called a seal.
It is therefore necessary for you in the first place, to consider whether the eye in which there is a seal, is strong and does not have any sickness except for the seal: then collect its seal.For if you leave it, it will turn into a white spot on the black of the eye, and will weaken his sight, and will not go away unless you open it and collect the pus.
And it is, that you instruct the weak man to put his head in your lap.And if it is a strong man, then he can do it himself.Then open wide the eye, and take the meat which is over the black of the eye with a cloth or with tweezers, and pull it upwards towards the eyebrow.
Then pull up those veins with a hook, or two according to your discretion: and let the hook be fine of silver, according to this form, or let there be two hooks moving in one body, according to this form.And be careful that you do not open the vein, but only draw out the seal from above it.
Then collect with fine tweezers those veins with subtlety, and wipe the blood hour after hour, until you see that those veins are removed from the eye, and are dissolved: and beware lest you hurt the eye with the ends of the tweezers.And if you see any part of the seal has not come out, put in the hook again, and pull it up as far as you can. And if it is a long seal, then open it with the tweezers and split it and pull it upwards, as we said before.
And if you are operating at midday under the sun, and are very experienced in your operations, so that you cut only those veins.
And when you have finished, then distil into the eye vitriol or green vitriol so that with its acuteness it may eat away what remains of the cataract.
But if you are not able to collect it all in that hour, then cover the eye with a poultice of it which will soothe the pain of the eye, and leave it for several days until the pain subsides and is secure from heat; then repeat over it according to the same method, until it is healed.
And this is the form of the forceps.
¶ Of the reduction of a dislocated nose.
CHAPTER 19.
Physicians call a fistula of the nose "Arissata," which they cure either with cautery or with sharp medicine that burns, according to what precedes in its account.Et sic est facta Arissati Fistula.
And if it does not heal, then there is no virtue in it: unless you find over the pustule at its origin and draw out all the moisture which is in it and the pus, until the bone is laid bare.Et sic facies super eum cauterium secundum artem, et periculum illaesthetice: nam postea non curabitur ut antea.
And so you will do cautery over it according to the craft and the danger of disfigurement: for afterwards it will not heal as before. When therefore the bone is laid bare, and you see in it corruption or blackness, then scrape it with an instrument, whose form is thus:
And it is called a rasp for the head.Et sic rasura fit super ea, donec uides ossa quae sunt circa nasum: et si non potes detrahere totum os, et tamen est inea corruptio aut nigredinus, sed non possis detrahere omnia ossa, tunc facies super eum cauterium.
Let there be made from an iron rod a hole and let its head be round like the head of a nail, that is to say, marked by the punch of a file, or by the punch of an aliskilfer with a fine punch: and place it over the diseased bone. Then roll it between your fingers and press your hand a little, until you know that the corruption is now removed; and do this several times.
Then roll it between your fingers and press your hand a little, until you know that the corruption is now removed; and do this several times. Then restore the place with dry medicines for constriction.
If therefore the place is consolidated and flesh grows on it, and the course of the sickness is cut off, and it remains for forty days, and does not return, nor become inflamed, nor any accident happen to it: then you may know that it is already healed.
And if not, there is no virtue in it unless it reduces the fistula to a nostril hole, according to this form.
And it is, that you may pierce from the bone with iron, or with a sharp medicine; and when the bone is detected, then take a bore according to this form, its extremity be iron, triangular: and its wood be pyramid-shaped to its end, as you see.Et postea fac tibi extremitatem ligni quodam vasa de ceramica et sicut uterque sit apex triangulus, ita sit extremitas ferrea quoque triangula, ut bene conveniat cum extremitate ferri.
Then make for yourself the end of wood a certain pot of ceramic and as both are apex triangular, so is the iron end also triangular, that it may well fit with the end of the iron. Then place it over the bone itself: and let it be near the tear duct: and elongate your hand from the eye a little.Et postea trahe illum ad te parum, et ponas ultra extremitatem ferri, quod est prope lachrymale, unum panem de pane cum terra, et fac illum sub illo: et postea redde illum ad locum suo: et postea stiptica super eum.
Then pull it towards you a little, and place over the end of the iron, which is near the tear duct, one loaf of bread with earth, and make it under it; and then return it to its place: and then apply constrictive medicines over it. Then roll your hand with the bore, until it penetrates the bone, and feels the sick person: through this, that he finds the wind going out of him, when he holds his hand over his nose.
Therefore then restore the place with dry constrictive medicines, as I taught you.Et si non potest fieri quod te docui, sed est in ea lachrymale, et sanguis multus fluens ad lachrymales, tunc reuolue manum tuam cum terebro super locum eius usque donec scias quod cessavit: et postea restaura locum cum medicinis stipticis.
When therefore flesh is born and the place hardens, then the matter which flowed outward returns to the nose. It is therefore lighter over the infirmity.
On the reduction of a lump on the eye. Chapter 20.
When a lump on the eye emerges with its entirety, and there is no harm or diminution to sight, then you should treat the infirmity. Then bleed him, then place bloodletting cups on his neck without scarification but with suction.
Then put over the eye a liniment made from myrrh, and aloe, and frankincense, and mastic.Et tege super eum palmam cum ceruinis.
Then cover the eye with a palm-sized piece of cowhide. Then tighten the eye from above with a bandage filled with many small pieces of felt.Et sic tege, et stringes per quatuordie noctis horas.
And thus you shall cover and tighten for four days and nights. And the amount of felt is as follows: take soft cloths, many, and double each cloth from them over four; make out of them many: then place them one above another according to the quantity required by the eye: then tighten over them with a hard cloth a strong tightness.Et sic tege, et stringes per quatuordie noctis horas.
And thus you shall cover and tighten for four days and nights. And repeat the bloodletting cups with suction without scarification.Deinde laves Oculum aqua calida, et stryge cum linteo sublito: et ponas super eum emplastrum rubeum.
Then remove the bandages and keep the eye tightly shut by day and by night.
If however the ligature becomes soft again it must be tightened further; then after another day and night remove the ligature as we have said.
If you see that the membrane of the eye has healed well, then it is good; if not, then repeat the poultice and the bandages and the compression and the bandages, until it heals.
Of the incision of the tunica.Albucasis, Liber de chirurgia, liber II, capitulum LXXIV (pp 521-2)
Chapter 21.De incisione Vuae tunicae.
When there is a rupture of the tunica of the eye, then something protrudes and comes out between the eyelids, like a grain of mustard; because of this, the appearance of the person is distorted and it must be cut: then an operation on it must be performed, according to what I tell you, and it is so that one inserts a needle into the root of the eyelid from below upwards.Deinde aufer uentosas, et dimitte oculum strictum die et nocte.
Then remove the bandages, and keep the eye tightly shut by day and by night.Then insert another needle that has a double thread on its tear-like part, and make it penetrate; and leave the first needle in its place.Et fac aliam acum intrare secundum dispositionem suam: et fac ut intrent cum his filis ad lachrymalem porum.
Then cut a groove in double thread and tie a ligature with it around the sting; and pull hard on it.
Then pull out the sting and place over the eye a piece of wool soaked in white vinegar; and leave it until the thread with the V-shaped notch falls off.
Then treat the eye with it to strengthen it until the wound is healed.
And when it is pressed from all sides by a circle of cloth, then the eye becomes very prominent.
Then it is pierced with a thin spit that penetrates the eye to its depth and the white matter flows down and the eye enters, then draw it up until healed.
Of the cure of hawks-eye.
Chapter 22.
This disease called hawks-eye is nothing but inflammation which collects in the eye, similar to descending water and is not itself.Et fit per sanguinis cohibe[n]dinem, qui in oculum ascendit: nam albus oculi habet nervos tres.
And the mode of operating is, that you make the sick person sit on a seat prepared for this purpose, either upright or inclined.
Then take his head in your two hands and move him until you see the blood flow down to the lower parts of your eyes.
Then it is bound up and does not flow down again, and the light becomes clear; and let the sick person see things as he used to. And if it does not flow below, you may know that there is water.
But if the flow of blood does not take place as we have said, then let the sick person sit between your hands. Then take a slender probe and feel with it above the skin at the edge of the wound on the part where the skin joins the membrane of the eye, until the pus flows out.
When therefore the pus flows out, then drop into the eye warm water in which you have mixed honey; or water in which you have already boiled fenugreek and honey; then let it be treated with the rest of the treatment until it heals up.
¶ Of the cure for water that has entered the eye, or for a cataract.
Chapter 23.
We have already spoken of the appearances of water in division, and what is appropriate for piercing by means of speech, and revealing; then take that same thing according to health.
Then therefore you ought to make the sick person sit between your hands, square on, opposite the light, near the sun; and bind his good eye, and press it hard; then with your right hand close the eyelid of the eye in which is the water, if it is the left eye; or with your left hand, if it is the right.
Then take with your right hand alum, if it is the left eye; or with your left hand, if it is the right.
Then place the end of the alum near the crown through the thickness of the ray in the very white of the eye, showing the tear-ducts; then push the alum with strength, and you roll it with it until it penetrates into the eyeball, and feel that the alum has already reached the hollow.
And it is necessary that there be a measurement of the journey into the depth, the measurement of the space which extends from the pupil to the end of darkness; and this is the ring of the eye.
For you see these in the actual pupil of the eye because of the clarity of the cornea.
Then place the magnifying glass up to the spot where the water is.
Then press it below with one hand after the other.
If therefore the water goes down at once, then the invalid will see immediately above what he opens his sight to, and the magnifying glass in his eye.
Then relax for a little while.
If therefore the water goes down, then put it aside second after it has come out of the magnifying glass.
When it is pressed and does not go up; then take the magnifying glass with ease: and you shall remove your hand little by little. Then dissolve something of clear salt-gem in water: and wash with it the eye inside.Et si non possit uisere almagda, ut sit super pupillam, sed uisatur infra palpebram.
Then put on the whole eye a poultice of cotton or of wool steeped in rose oil and white wine; and bind it up with a bandage around a healthy eye.
But we, and those who are of our time, put on it ground cumin mixed with white of egg.
If the alum does not enter the eye because of its hardness, since it is of man, whose eye is very hard, then you ought to take a spatule, which is called "al-birid", and this is how you make it:
Therefore pass with it only the foreskin, and not the whole hand into the orifice; and it is only so that you make a way to the alum to its place gently.
Then insert the alum as we have said above.
And when you finish your work, prepare a decent bed for the invalid to sleep on his back in a dark house; and he should be prohibited from all movements, and from coughing; and give him that food which soothes his nature; and he must not move his head to right or left at all.
And the bandage should remain according to its position until the third day.Et si post tertiam die, non obeat ei quod intromittat in oculum eum: tunc faciatur super almagda oleum quod nominatur, Nitsafiz. And if after the third day he is not better, then make over the alum that oil which is called Nitsafiz".Then dissolve it in that dark house and test its effect; and let him look at objects.
Then return the bandage until the seventh day.Et si post hec non obeatur ei quod introiat in oculum: tunc faciatur super illo oleum, cuius nominatio Nitsafiz est, secundum quod diximus; et fac eum in domo tenebrosa omnino.
And one must not do that during the hour of cure, or immediately after making the incision; rather one should keep it away, because water quickly rises through the intense gaze.
But if a hot pustule happens to appear: then one must treat the eye before noon and correct it with that which soothes the pustule until it is soothed; then finish its treatment, and place over his face an ointment with which he can see while he remains for several days in that dark house.
Then let him exit the house little by little and converse in his own home.
And know that in the winter, a disciple is not excused from washing several times; then he will dare to do the operation.Et scias quod in hyeme non debet procedere in operacione super oculum nisi post tertiam uel quartam uisione: et non oportet ut procedat nisi per diem uelorum, scilicet per dies lucis uelorum: nam per dies tenebrorum non debet procedere.
And indeed it has reached us from among those who are of Alayrac that it was made in Alayrac a perforated pot in which water is drawn.
But therefore I have not seen any one in your land who made it; nor did I read of it in any of the books of the ancients; and it is possible that it may be new.
And these are the forms of objects out of the pot, so that he who does not know them may stand upon them.
Let them be made out of their own metal; and let their extremities have this same subtlety triangularly pointed, and the point acute.
Forms of the pot.
§ Of the cure of Nasal Polyps.
CHAPTER XXIV.
When polyps are generated in the nose of various kinds, among which is one that resembles a scorpion with many feet; and from it there is a fleshy growth like cancer, and one that is hard like stone, of a dusky colour; and from it there is one that is soft flesh, not of a dusky colour.
Therefore when you find among these meats one that is not deceitful or cancerous but soft, you ought to make it sit between your hands facing the sun, and open its nostrils, and thrust in the hook into those meats; then draw them outward, and cut what you have hold of with a fine sharp instrument on one side only, until you know that all the flesh is removed.
But if anything of it remain whose removal is not possible, then scrape it with one of the fine instruments with ease, until nothing at all remains of it.Et postea cum spatumili et cum uncinis facito illam carnem incisa, usque ad quod cognoscas omnem eius carnem ablata: sed ne trahas eam ad exteriora, nisi prius reserueris ostium, quod tenet os, ut non debita ex ea effugiat sanguinis quantitas.
If blood flows profusely from the wound or if there is a hot blister: then treat it with what is appropriate for such a case; or if it is an evil blister, quickly cauterize it until the blood stops flowing and all the flesh is removed.
Then vinegar or water or wine should be poured into the nose after making an incision.
If then the nose opens and moisture passes through to the palate, you may know that it is healed.
But if moisture does not pass through as it should, then you may know that there is flesh inside the upper bones of the nostril which was not reached by the instrument when making the incision.
Then you must take a flax thread with some thickness to it and make many knots in it; and between each knot there should be the distance of a finger or less.The sick person then holds one end of the thread while he sniffs up the other end, until the thread reaches the back of his nose and comes out at the back of his throat.
And this is indeed often done by schoolboys, who find it easy to do so.
Then take hold of the two ends of the thread: let one end come out through the nose and the other remain in the nose.
Then you will have the flesh closed up by means of the knots on the thread. Do this until you know that the flesh is closed up around the thread's knots.
Then pull out the thread, and put a little linseed oil on the wound after you have cleaned off the blood; do this for three days or more until all the flesh is healed.
Then insert into the wound at the end of the nostril a little lead pipe for several days, until it heals.
But if it needs something to dry it out, use that remedy instead.Postea oportet, ut trahatur in nasum aqua calida.
Then warm water should be poured into the nostril.For making a head-purging device, such as is used for distilling oils and other medicines in the nose, it should be made of silver or brass; its shape and size should be like that of a small lamp, with an opening like a conch-shell.
And if you wish to make a closed pipe as long and straight as the cane of a staff,
And the cup or bowl of the instrument for making head-purges should be full and open; and there should be a handle at its end by which to hold it when you heat oil or other fluid in it.
This is the shape of the instrument. On the care of the nose.
CHAPTER 25.
Very often a wart is born on the end of the nose, and grows bigger as the days go by until it becomes an ugly sight.
And because of that you must cut it away at first sight, and root out all of it.
Then put cautery or burning medicine on the spot where it was.
If the cutting away of it is delayed until it grows large, then consider whether it is hard and stony-looking and of a dusky colour with little feeling in it; then do not touch it with iron, for it is cancerous.Et si vis facere cannam clausam sicut canna:
Many a time have I seen an abscess of the scrotum that has caused serious damage to him who had it.
And if the abscess is soft to the touch and not of a purplish color, and you see that it can be cut into all over, then open up the weak spot and cut into it without fear or hesitation: treat the wound with something that will dry it out and draw it together until it heals.
Of stitches for the nose, lip, and ear.
Chapter 26.
Know that when there is a breakdown of continuity in one of these cartilages, little can be done about it with surgery, except in certain cases of men.Quod si uocatur postea solutio continuitatis in cartilege auris aut naris vel labii in quibusdam hominibus qui habent cartilegem tenui et fragili, qui non sustinet suturam nec conglutinationem, sed debet esse soluta et exiccatio, faciatur uelamen de linteo albico et panno de lino, et faciatur in illum modum ut dictum est.
If afterwards there is a breakdown of continuity in the cartilage of the ear or nose or lip in some men who have thin and fragile cartilage which does not hold stitches nor cicatrization, but must be cut open and dried out, make a bandage of white linen and of linen cloth, and do it in that manner as was said.
And if the breakdown of continuity has separated the lips, and each part has become healed: then you must excise all parts that are exposed to the skin, until they bleed.Et si tibi placeat, faciunt homines uelamina quod vocatur muscus: sed multotiens non debet esse factum de harum cartilaginum.
Then bring together the two lips with a suture, and tighten them, and strew powdered dragon's blood and olibanum that has been ground over the top; and place over this powder a piece of diafinicon plaster or one of the other plasters which are used for strengthening; and leave it bound up for two days or three.
Then loosen it, and change the medicine; and leave it until the threads come away by themselves. Then dress the wound with ointment till it is healed.
The manner of the suture, however, is to bring together the edges of the wound, either with acubas as we have related in the case of the abdomen, or by gathering up the edges with a thread, as I have already told you.
Of the extraction of the nodules on the lips.De extractione enim dictarum nodorum fuit hoc modus:
The method of extracting these nodules was as follows:Chapter XXVII. Many men are subject to hard nodules like grains of barleycorn on the inside of their lips, and some of these are smaller, and some larger.Quibus enim non contigit ad medicos, sed et quibus contigit, multum profuit, si antequàm exciderint, extrahieruntur.
For those who have not been able to see a physician, and for those who have seen one, it has done much good if they were extracted before falling out.Therefore you should turn up the lip, and find upon every nodule, and pierce it with a hook, and cut it all round.Si autem non possit excidi cum uncino, sed necesse est ut incidas eum cum scalpelio intra labrum et extra, quod non facias nisi ad extremum, ne frangas labrum.
But if it cannot be taken out with a hook, then you must cut it inside and outside the lip with a scalpel, which you are not to do until the last moment lest you tear the lip.Then fill up the place after the incision with powdered zea until the bleeding is stopped.Et postea impinge super eum linimentum, et teneas donec sanetur: si autem non teneatur per diem vel per duos dies, excide nodum cum scalpelio intra et extra labrum, et fac ut sanguis abscindatur, et omnes filamentos quae in eo sunt.
Then dress it with an ointment and hold it until it is healed: but if it is not held for a day or two days, cut the nodule out with a scalpel inside and outside the lip so that all the blood may be removed from it and all its threads.Then let the place where it was cut be cleaned with vinegar, and let it be healed with the help of this until the wounds are cured.Quod si non possit fieri nisi cum sanguine percutiens, excide nodum intra et extra labrum, quod facias pro salute et in consilio: postea omnes uulnera quae in labro erant curas donec sanentur.
Of the incision of flesh born above the gum.
Chapter 28. Many times a growth is born above the gum, which the ancients name an abscess.
Therefore you must hold it with a hook or with forceps and cut it at its root, letting the pus or blood flow.
Then place powdered asafotida, or other astringent powders on the spot.
If that growth comes back after healing – for it often does – then cut into it a second time and cauterize it; for it will not come back again after cautery.
Of the removal of teeth with iron.
Chapter 29.Quemadmodum dentem caducum debes trahere cum ferro, quod tibi placet: postea autem duntaxat illum solvere in vino, vel oleo, ut possit dilui, et reddi in locum suum, ne cicatrix cronicis: nam cadere caduca non debent, sed solvenda.
When teeth grow on the inside and outside surfaces, and between the gums there are rough, sharp edges, and sometimes they turn black, and green until the corruption extends to the gums and the teeth become foul because of this.
You should therefore cause the sick person to sit between your hands and his head in your lap, and scrape off the molars and teeth where the edges appear to you like sand: until nothing remains of them, and likewise do with blackness, greenness, yellowing, and others until they are cleansed.
If what is on them is removed from the first scraping, it is good; and if not, then repeat the scraping over them a second day, and a third, until finally you reach the point of your observation.
And you should know that teeth require scrapers of diverse shapes, many figures, according to how they are prepared for your operation: because the scraper with which the tooth is scraped from the lower part, is different from the scraper with which it is scraped between the teeth, according to other forms.Et id quod superius est in dente, debet esse levigatum cum rasorio plano et simplici, quod non detrapat dentem: sed quod infra radit dens, debet esse cum rasorio crasso et denticulato.
And the forms of these scrapers should be prepared with you, which you see.Et in radendo dentem, debet stetere infirmus bene sedens: et tu debes radere dentem bene et parum, et non detrapare eum, donec uides, quod apparit sicut arena, et non ex statio una facias omnia, sed per plura stationes, donec perueniat ad ultimum, et omnia similia, quae in radendo apparuerunt, sint remissa.
And while scraping the tooth, the sick person should be sitting well: and you should scrape the tooth well and little, and not cut it, until you see that what appears is like sand, and not from one station, but through many stations, until at last everything is removed, and all similar things which appeared in scraping are left behind.
Head XXX.¶ Of drawing out the pain of teeth.
You should cure the tooth from its pain with all your skill, and delay in eradicating it.Et scias quod si dens est corruptus per putredinem, et non potest seruari, sed debet exire: et si uides quod est quasi matura uina intra eum, et in omni parte, et tamen firmus: debes uigere densem tuo rasorio usque ad ultimum, et fac, ut perueniat corruptio ad gingiuam, et in radendo dentem, facas illum sanguisare multum.
There is nothing that can supplement its place when it has been removed; for it is a substance that is most noble: until there is no excuse for removing it, then one should compel the sick man to have it removed, so that he may be strengthened and certified by you as having suffered pain in his tooth.
For often the sick man is deceived by the pain, and thinking that there is something wrong with his tooth he has it removed: then the pain does not go away until the weak tooth has been removed.
For we have already seen this from the practice of bloodletting.
When therefore the tooth is certified to you as being painful, then you should make an incision around the tooth with a sharp instrument, so that something of its strength may be dissolved: then loosen it with your fingers or with delicate forceps first little by little, until you jar it loose.
Then insert the forceps strongly into those places, and bend the head of the sick man between your knees: hold him well so that he does not move; then pull out the tooth according to its rightness, so as not to break it.
If then it does not come out, take one of those instruments and insert it under the tooth on every side with facility, and try to jar it loose as you did at first.Si tamen non potes eradicare illum, quod est multotiens faciendum: deinde mande inferri ad medicum.
If a tooth is perforated or worn away, then the hole should be filled with a piece of cloth and bound tightly with a strip of thin material so that it does not break when you grip it with forceps.
And you should work carefully with much scraping all around the gum.
And you must be careful not to break it and have a portion of it remain and return above the diseased part which is greater in pain than that first pain.
And beware of doing what ignorant blood-letters do in their haste and arrogance in the removal of it, except that you apply what we have described above.
For often great infirmities come upon men which are more difficult to break and have all their roots remain or some of them; or they extract it with some bones of the jaw, as we have often witnessed. Then let it be washed after its removal with wine or vinegar and salt. If there is bleeding from the wound (which often happens), then gnaw something from your tooth and fill the wound with it; but if not, cauterize it if you do not have a tooth.Et si non possit fieri cauterisatio cum ferro, neque cum aceto et sale, sed cum uino soluo: tunc oportet ut facias cauterisationem cum pice, et oleum ad molliendum locum.
The forms of the delicate forceps with which a tooth is moved first should be long at the tips and short in the handles, thick so that they do not double over when pressed upon a tooth; they should be as you see the thick handles, until when you press them together, they do not bend in on themselves or double over; short at the tips, and made of Indian iron, or good bronze well finished, with straight tips: and at their tips there should be teeth, some of which enter into certain ones, and grip strongly with a decent pressure.
And sometimes the tips are shaped like the beak of a bird called a stork, and they are of strong grip.
On the removal of teeth, and the extraction of fractured mandibles.
Chapter 31.De extractione dentis qui in osso contuitur vel frangitur.
When something remains after the extraction of a tooth that is broken, then you must apply to the site butter for one or two days until it softens; then insert into it a hook, or forceps, the tips of which are shaped like the beak of a bird called a stork.De extractione dentis qui in osso contuitur vel frangitur.
This is the form of the forceps.Figura.
The tips should be made like a file, or like an aliskilfeg.De extractione ossium mandibularum fractorum.
If it does not give way to these forceps, then you must cut the root and tear away all the flesh, and insert a small lever whose form is as follows:Formare Palancas paruas.De extractione ossium mandibularum fractorum.Figura.
The tip should be short and rather thick; and it should not be soaked so that it does not break.De extractione ossium mandibularum fractorum.Figura.
If the root comes out through it, that is good; and if not, you should employ other instruments whose forms are as follows.On using other instruments.Figura.
The form of the first is triangular at the tip, where there is some thickness.De extractione ossium mandibularum fractorum.Figura.Aliae autem sint extremitates utraque parte subte et parumper flexibiles, ut intrant in loca et extrahant radices.
Form of a thin triangular extremity.
It is also used with this instrument having two branches, and the form of it is as follows: And other tools and instruments which preceded in the extraction of teeth.
It is also used with an instrument which resembles a large hook, and has this shape, of a twisted triangular extremity, and on it something thick so that it does not break; and it must be un-anointed.Cum hac forma autem pro rasione dentium praecedant alii.
And you must know that there are many instruments for teeth; similarly other tools are not counted, and a wise and cunning craftsman in his craft finds by himself an instrument according to the operation and the illnesses themselves.
For there are illnesses for which the ancients did not say that any instrument was used because of the variety of species of them.
But if a bone is broken from the jaw or other bones of the mouth, or putrefies: then probe it on that itself in its place with that which suits it of instruments and forceps which I have mentioned in the extraction of roots, and use them with a gesticulation, the form of which is as follows.
Let there be something thick in it little by little so that it may be tightened or held with it the bone and not escape and slip away, until the bone goes out; then heal the place with suitable medicines for that.Cum hoc igitur instrumentum perscrutare locum dentis, et cum eo stringere et teneatur.
So with this instrument probe the place of the tooth, and with it tighten and hold fast; if, however, there is a small caries in the bone, then scrape away the caries and treat it until it heals.Cum hoc igitur instrumentum perscrutare locum dentis, et cum eo stringere et teneatur.
Of the serration of prominent teeth above others.Hic in prima parte de ferrum debet intrare intra iugum per paulum sub rasione dentis: sed ne intrantes per paulum inter iugum debent procedere ad locum dentis, ubi debet operari et aliter intra ibit per paulum intra iugum.
Here in the first part the iron must enter a little within the jaw under the tooth to be operated on; but as it enters a little within the jaw it should not proceed any further, until it reaches the place of the tooth where it is to operate or otherwise it will enter a little within the jaw.
When teeth protrude from their natural course a foul appearance is made by it and especially when this happens to women and girls, that is to say, to young women.
For if a tooth has grown after another tooth and cannot be placed, or it is possible to lock up its serration, nor can be ground: then root out the tooth: and if it is attached to another tooth, then cut it with this instrument, of which this is the shape.
It is like a small beak, and it is made from very hard iron, with a very acute end.
And let your incision be as you cut on many days, and because of the hardness of the tooth, and so that it will not disturb another one of the teeth.
But if it is protruding exposed to be ground: then grind the tooth with an indian file, whose shape is as follows.Et si non potest esse limata, ut debet, sed tamen non eminit multum: tunc era dicebatur, et facies eius serratam, nec uel superius nec inferius.
And if it cannot be ground as it should be, but it still does not protrude much: then it is said to have been filed down, and its serration made, neither above nor below.It is all of iron, and its handle has a very fine point, just like the file with which needles are made: with this the tooth is ground little by little on many days with ease, so that the tooth will not be disturbed and fall out; then smooth it down, in the end grind it with some razors.
But if it is a tooth from which part breaks off and injures the tongue: then one must smooth it down as well, until the roughness of that break is removed and it is evened out: and is smoothed down, and does not injure the tongue, nor corrupt speech.Et si est dens qui laedit linguam per serratum suam, et non potest esse mutatus cum lima seu rasorio, neque posset emoliri, ut non laedas linguam, sed tamen potest essere subliminando: tunc incide in eo ubi est serratum et eminens.
And if it is a tooth which injures the tongue because of its serration, and it cannot be changed with a file or razor, nor can it be smoothed down so that it does not injure the tongue, but it can still be made smooth by filing: then cut into where the serration is protruding.
Chapter 33.De dentibus stragulis et tortis, et si dens est tortus in dente suo: et non potest esse rectificatus cum lima, neque subliminando: tunc incide super eum, ubi tortus est, et posito filo aurato ad retationem faciendam in dentibus, per quod non eminit.
When there is concussion and commotion of the front teeth, from a blow or an accident; and the weak person cannot hold fast what he eats so that it does not fall; and you have treated them with astringent remedies, but the treatment has been of no avail: then there is a trick for them, to string them together with a gold wire. For silver turns green, and rots after a few days; but gold never changes.
Let the wire be medium in thickness and fineness according to the quantity that it can take between the teeth.
And the way of doing it is to take a piece of wire and pass twice its length between two healthy teeth; then weave with both ends of the wire among the moving teeth, whether they be one or more, until you come to the healthy tooth on the other side.
Then repeat the weaving until you reach the part from which you began; and tighten your hand with skill and wisdom, until it is quite tight; and the pressure of your fingers as you tighten the wire must be at the roots of the teeth, so that it does not slip out.Et si in ista constrictione non remoueatur, et non cadat: teneas tuum, donec facias aliam texturam similiter, usque ad finem.
Then cut the superfluous ends of the thread with a pair of scissors; and gather both ends together, and tie them with a knot, and hide these between the sound tooth and the loose one, so that they do not hurt the tongue; then leave it thus tightly tied until it remains so.
If however it comes undone, or is cut, tie them with another thread, and let it remain with him in that state for the whole time.
And this is the form of teeth, and the figure of the rotation of two sound teeth, and two loose ones, as you see it.
And sometimes one or two teeth return to their places after the loss of them; and they remain as we have said, and do not go back again, unless it be an artificer, a prudent man, and experienced in this matter.
And sometimes a tooth is made out of bone, and formed like a tooth, and put into the place from which the tooth was taken; and it is guarded and tied as we have said; and it remains and serves for a long time.Et ex osse in quo est retentio dentis fit aliquid sicut forma dentis, et ponitur in locum illum, et stringitur cum eo dens: et seruitur cum eo, et non laedit linguam.
And from the bone in which is the retention of the tooth, something is made like a tooth; and it is put into that place, and the tooth is tied with it: and it serves with it, and does not hurt the tongue.¶ Of the cutting of the ligament, which happens under the tongue, and prevents speech.Et quandoque accidit, ut ligamen quod sub lingua est, incida; et non potest loqui homo: et fit hoc quasi semper post casum dentis.
And sometimes it happens that the ligament which is under the tongue is cut; and the man cannot speak: and this happens almost always after the loss of a tooth.Chapter XXXIV.De dentibus subliminariis, et de modo curandi eorum dolores.
If there is something hard and swollen, and it is from the healing of a wound, then thrust into it with a hook, and find it by touch until you cut through the ligament, and the swelling goes down.
But if bleeding ensues, then put on the wound a pounded stinging nettle. But if you are overcome by the blood, then sear the spot with a branding iron that suits it; then heal it with the rest of the cure until it is healed. On the extraction of a Ranula beneath the tongue:
Chapter 35.
Sometimes there occurs beneath the tongue an abscess which resembles a little Frog, hindering the tongue from performing its natural office, and perhaps it so magnifies that it fills up the mouth.Et sic fit ut non possit loqui nisi cum difficultate: et quasi neque respirare possit: sed debet sublato interiore homine, quod intra se habet.
If you see that it is of a dusky or black colour, and hard, and the patient feels no pain in it, then do not touch it, for it is cancer.Sed si uides ei sanguinem sublato interiore homine: tunc incide locum cum spatulo, et perstringe donec sanguis desinat fluere.
But if you see that there is blood beneath the patient, then cut into the spot with a spoon, and press until the bleeding stops.If it has turned white where there is moisture, then thrust into it with a hook, and cut it with a sharp-pointed instrument, and free it from every part.Et sic perstringendo stancando debes fieri donec sanguis desinat fluere: et quando cessa sit fluxus sanguinis, tunc remitte spatulam: et incide in eodem loco cum spatulo usque ad albedinem.
If blood strikes you during your operation, then put crushed pepper on it until the blood is cut off; then return to your operation until you have extracted it with its complement.
Then let it be washed with vinegar and salt; and treat the remainder with a suitable treatment until it is healed.
¶ On the cure of mumps in the two glands.
Chapter 36.
Then either piercing it through or it will burst of itself.
And if it is white-colored, round, and its root is slender: then it should be cut.
And there is an operation on it, that you consider before its operation, if the aposteme is quiet and completed in warmth, or diminished somewhat: then let the sick man therefore sit before the sun, and his head be in your lap; and open his mouth, and the servant receive between his hands, and press his tongue underneath with an instrument, of which this is the form. Let it be made of silver or brass, that it may be slender as a knife.
With ergo pressing with it the tongue, and your touch is shown to you, and falls upon it aposteme: then take a hook, and fix it in the amigdalum, and draw it outward as much as you can, except that you draw with it something of the tunics.
Then cut it with an instrument, of which this is the form that follows.Et non trahas omnino, nisi videas in ipso perficiebatur: nam si traxeris ante perficiebatur, morituri sunt homines.
It is applied with tweezers; however, the ends of these should be curved so that each opening points directly at its neighbor sharply: therefore take care to use red-hot iron or a piece of iron which has been wetted in oil.
But if that implement is not available, then cut it with spatuli, which have this shape.
Let one side be sharp, the other blunt.
And when you have cut through the gum on one side, cut through it on the other side according to this same pattern of incision.Et cum spatuli incideris amigdalem, fac ut sint duae partes, una supra et altera infra; et non fac ut sit una sola et unius forme.
Then after the incision, let the invalid gargle with cold water, or vinegar and water.Si tamen non possit gargarizare, tangat inque illo locum infusum in aquam et in aceto.
If however the flow of blood occurs, let him gargle with water in which pomegranate bark has been boiled; or myrtle leaves, and those like them from astringent herbs, until the flow of blood is stopped; then take care of him, until he recovers.Et postea faciunt gargarismus cum infuso de sumac et menta et malva et salvia et rosa: et si cum eo non possit gargarizare, tangat illum locum in infusione.
And sometimes there arise in the throat, apart from the two tonsils.Hic ergo faciunt gargarismus cum sumac et malva et rosa et salvia: et si non possit gargarizare, tangant in illo locum infusione eorumdem plantarum.
Cut them then according to what I said about cutting the two tonsils equally.Et cum spatuli incideris amigdalem, fac ut sint duae partes una supra et altera infra: et non fac ut sit una sola una forma.
And I have indeed already treated a woman from an abscess which had formed between her throat and one that almost closed her throat; the woman breathed with difficulty through a constricted throat, and had already forbidden eating food, and drinking water; and she would have reached death if she had remained for another day or two.Et ego incidi in locum illum cum spatuli et remisi absessum: et quod erat clausum ita aperui, quod potuit respirare et potus aquas et cibilis, et sanavit.
And the abscess rose so much that it let out two branches until they came out through the two nostrils.Et ego incidi in locum illum cum spatuli et remisi absessum: et quod erat clausum ita aperui, quod potuit respirare et potus aquas et cibilis, et sanavit.
Then seize it quickly and fix it in one of their claws.
Then I pulled on it, and a great piece came away with me.
Then I cut it off where it was gripped by the nostril hole.
Then I did to her what protruded from the other nostril hole.
Then I opened her mouth and pressed down on her tongue; then I fixed a claw in the very wart, and then cut away some of it, but only a little blood came from it; so the woman's throat was cleared and she began straightway to drink water, and then accepted food.
So I did not cease to cut away at this wart many a long while; and the wart would grow again where I had cut it, until it grew so big with her that it hung down.
I was amazed at this, and cauterized the wart between the throat.
Then it stopped growing; then I walked away for a while, and did not know what God had done to her after I left.
¶ Of the cutting of an ulcer in the throat.
Chapter 37.
When phlegm runs down to the throat and becomes an ulcer, and is long and thin, it is called perpendicular; but if it is thick and round at its lower end, then it is called a wart.¶ De curanda uuula.
When it is treated with that which we said when making the incision, and it does not bring about a cure; and you see that the ulcer is cool and thin: then it behooves that you cut into it.¶ De curanda uuula cum oleo et teriaca.
And which is rounded and aggregated from her, and has no length, and is blood-red, or dusky, or black, and has no feeling: then you should make a cut into it.¶ De curanda uuula cum oleato teriachi.Si autem habet sensum: et uides quod est calidum et grossum, et est subea, sed non pendens: et habet pus in ea: non oportet te ut incidas eam, sed ut teras eam cum oleato teriachi: et quando teres eam, fac ut oleum teriaci sit subtile.
There is fear for the infirm.
You must therefore when you see it according to the way I have said from its whiteness, and length, that you make sit the infirm before the sun; and press his tongue with an instrument, whose predecessor is a story: then fix the hook in the hollow, and pull it downward; and cut it with one of two instruments which I said in cutting of two amygdalar.
And you must not cut from it, unless that which is added above the natural term without addition.
For if you cut from it more, you injure voice and speech.Et si minus, non auferis totum morbum: sed facies quasi in quolibet loco, ut dixi, una incisionem per modum crucis.
And after cutting to use that which we narrated in cutting of two amygdalar; and cure it, until it is healed.Et scito quod si uis facere per modum crucis in uno latere, quilibet lateris faciatur una incisione, et postea curatur usque ad sanitatem: sed non potest fieri per modum crucis, nisi facias duas incisiones.
And know that if the infirm is terrified by cutting: then you must use skill in cauterizing it without fear and terror.Et scito quod si non auferatur totus morbus, et non curabitur, quilibet lateris faciatur una incisione, qui fit per modum crucis. Nam si non potest curari per modum crucis, sed per modum ligaturae, tunc oportet ut facias ligaturam post incisionem in ea parte quae est super naturalem terminum: et facias ligaturam usque ad sanitatem morbid.
And know that if the disease is not removed, and not cured, each side is made a single cut, which is done by cross-cut. For it cannot be cured by cross-cut, but by way of binding, then you must do binding after cutting in that part which is above the natural term: and do binding until health. And mode cauterization in it is not, unless with sharp water; and is, as you put the head infirm in your lap.
Then press his tongue with instrument which we said.Et postea facias ligaturam per modum crucis usque ad sanitatem: sed non oportet ut facias duas ligaturas in ea parte quae est super naturalem terminum: nam si facieris, mox ueniet morbidus et laesit eam.
Then do binding by cross-cut until health: but you must not do two bindings in that part which is above the natural term; for if you do, soon comes disease and injure it. Then take from water which I told you in chapter cauterizing, and mix with it chalk not extinguished, and put it not thick, nor thin, and fill from it hollow of this instrument, whose shape is as follows.Et ponas eam super concauitatem huius instrumenti: et facias ligaturam per modum crucis usque ad sanitatem morbid: sed non oportet ut facias duas ligaturas in ea parte quae est super naturalem terminum.
Place this end in which the medicine is placed like a concavity of a spoon.
And put the instrument with the medicine on his uvula itself: and let him lie on his back, so that the liquid from the medicine runs out of his mouth by itself, so that nothing goes down his throat and hurts him.
Then hold your hand with the medicine.
And from the first amount of medicine on his uvula for an hour, until you see it blackened and the bite of the medicine is settled.
And if you see fit to take a lump of cotton, and wrap it around the end of the rod, and pour the medicine with cotton into the cannula from above, and insert the rod with the cotton into the tube from above, until the cotton adheres to the uvula. Do that many times, until you achieve what you want in terms of cauterization.Et post hoc intromittas radium cum coto intrinsecum ad medullam, et trahe radium usque ad os, et iterum intromitte, donec uidas cotum non se movere a loco suo.
After that, insert the rod with cotton inside to the marrow and pull out the rod to the bone and then insert it again until you see the cotton not moving from its place.Then leave it alone; for it will harden and fall off after three or four days.Et si uis ut superimponas coto in qua radice, fac: et intromittas cotum intra cannam radium ad medullam usque: et iterum trahe radium ad os: et intromitte radium cum coto usque ad medullam: et sic multotiens iterum agas, donec uidas cotum non se movere.
If you need to repeat the medicine, then repeat it; and after cauterization, wipe around the uvula with a cotton ball soaked in butter, and clean up what is around it from the medicine using this, and cool it with cold water.
And it will be healed externally with ointments, and internally with gargles, until he is cured.
This kind of treatment is healthier than surgery and safer from fear.Et non debet fieri in toto caelo uirum.
And sometimes the uvula is cured with something more gentle than cautery and incision; it is cured with fumigation in this way:
Take equal parts of calaminth, hyssop, oregano, rue, sassafras, chamomile, southernwood and similar herbs; put all these into a pot and pour vinegar over them, then boil the mixture. Let the pot be sealed with a clay stopper and have a hole in the middle of it, over which is placed a hollow instrument shaped to fit it.
Let the instrument be made of silver or brass; insert the end which has the grenade into the mouth of the sick person until the vapor reaches the uvula over the tube, until the uvula is much obscured.
Then repeat this several times until the bleeding stops.
And beware, do not perform this cure at the beginning of the appearance of the apthae.
For it adds to the pustule; and you ought not to do this except when the aptha is cooling down.
But if this instrument is not available to you, take a tube and put on its end some cork; in order that the mouth of the sick person may not be burned, because the cork will prevent the vapor from burning the mouth; and this is a good cure for the aptha.
¶ On drawing out thorns and bones from the throat.Alii autem vocant hanc chordeas: alii vero vocabant eam furias: sed inter se conveniunt in hoc quod ab intus percutitur ad extra:
Chapter 38.
often sticks in the throat a fishbone, or spine, or something else.
Therefore you must pull out what is protruding above what has fallen, after you have pressed the tongue down with an instrument near the uvula, and it is revealed to you that it is in the throat.
And what does not appear to you and is hidden in the throat, you must make a weak poultice before the food is digested in the stomach.Et postea quod in guture apparet et est ex illo uomere et per illum trahatis, usque dum dissecatis quid sit quod intrinsecus adhaeret.
Perhaps indeed something attached might exit through the urine.
Or the feeble man might swallow a piece of turnip or the root of lettuce, or he might swallow a dry biscuit; or let him take a dry piece of sea-sponge, and tie it on a thread, then swallow it.
When therefore he comes to the place where are thorns or bones, and is withdrawn out, then it goes out. If therefore it does not go out with that which we have said, then use an instrument of lead according to this form.
Let it be a little thicker than a radius, and at the end of it let there be a curve, which he may introduce into his throat with ease; and he himself let him hold his head elevated upwards.
And let him beware of touching his epiglottis, lest it should happen that he have a cough, and let him push in with it the bone or thorn, or let the physician introduce it with his hand.
Yet it is better that the feeble man should himself introduce it, because of his knowledge of the place of the attached thing; and he should push in below, or draw upwards with his hand the instrument, according as the quantity requires which is prepared for him, until it goes out.
Of the Extraction of the Leech.Et postea cum sanguisuga exuit se, et egredietur res annexa per ureterem: tunc utere manu sua ad extraxendam eam de uretere: propter timorem ne per omne corpus trahat.
Chapter XXXIX.
When you have treated the leech with what I said above, in the division on treatment with medicine, and it does not work, then consider in the throat of the patient before the sun, or towards the sun after you have pressed his tongue with the instrument which I described to you.
If therefore your leech falls on top of another leech, pull it out with a small hook, or with fine tweezers deftly.
If this is not possible with them: then take a hollow cane, and insert it into the throat of the patient up to near the throat; then insert into the hollow of the cane burning iron with fire.
Do this several times: and let the patient abstain from water all day.
Then let him drink a full glass of cold water, and open his mouth in it: and rinse his mouth with it, and not swallow anything out of it: and move the water around an hour after another with his hand.
For indeed, the leech will immediately fall when it senses water.
But if it does not come out with what we described, then smoke the patient with bedbugs, or with ash with a tool which I described in smoking a scrotum.
Do this several times, for indeed it will fall.
And the manner of operation in smoking is, that you take a pot, in which are living embers with fire; and the pot be covered with a cover, in whose middle there is a hole; and the end of the instrument is composed in that hole.
Then throw the smoke, and let the patient put his mouth on the end of the cane, and close his mouth, so that the smoke does not go out, until you know that the smoke has reached the leech.Postea proiice instrumentum foras, et ponat infirmus os suum ad solis radiis.
Afterwards throw the instrument out, and let the patient put his mouth to the rays of the sun.For indeed, the leech will immediately fall.
If it does not fall, then repeat the smoke several times.
Let the sick person endure thirst and eat salt and onions, but drink no water. The patient must be put on this regimen.
This is the form of the instrument used to remove a leech from its host when it has fallen into the wound.
It resembles forceps, as you can see, except that there is a hook on the end which is inserted into the throat.
Its tip is like the beak of a bird called a stork, which has a rough file on it; when it grasps something, it does not let go at all.
On the opening of abscesses and their incision and treatment in general.
Chapter 40.
There are many species of abscesses and they come in many forms, as has already been mentioned in this book, namely single and multiple; and they differ in their perforation and incision according to two methods.¶ Prima autem causa est ex ulceribus: nam utritur et urit, et ruit ad interiora, et ibi cohabit, et fit apostema.
The first cause is from sores; for it is rubbed and irritated, and breaks through to the innards, and there it settles and becomes an abscess.Of these, one is of the nature of an abscess in itself, and that because it contains moisture within itself.Et alius ex specie apostematis est quasi in quodam intruso: nam non potest egredi, sed necesse est ut elidatur et sectetur.
And the second method is due to the locations in which it occurs in the body.
For an abscess occurring on the head is different from one occurring in the anus; and an abscess occurring in a fleshy location is different from one occurring in the joints; and each has its own judgment according to the operation.Et si accidit quod apostema sit in loco carnoso, ubi non possit sectari: aut in iunctura, ubi non possit elidi: et est super illum opus medicus ut faciat eum exire.
And of abscesses there are some which must not be perforated except after the sanies in them has matured and its complement is complete; and there are some which must be perforated while they are still raw and have not matured according to their complement.Et de his quoque apostematibus oportet ut scire medicus quando maturentur: et quo modo: nam sunt alicuius apostemata in seipso, si non perferuntur, faciunt mortem: sed postea si perferuntur, vivificantes; alicuius autem apostemata perferenda est morte.
As are the pustules which are near joints.
Because when a pustule occurs near a joint and prolongs itself until it putsrefies that which is around it, perhaps the ligaments or nerves of that joint are corrupted; hence there is caused a more ready contraction of that member.
Or it is a pustule upon the principal member: for if you delay its piercing until it has come to maturity, it will harm either itself or through it the principal member.
Or it is near the anus; therefore pierce it when immature: and you ought not to pierce a raw pustule, unless it be near the anus, so that putrefaction does not go deep, and prolong itself to the interior parts of the anus, and become a fistula, or at its end something which will not heal. You ought to know the hour of the piercing of a pustule which is mature according to its complement; and it is during the subsiding of the pain, the recession of the fever, and the diminution of redness, and pulsation, and acuteness of the head of the pustule: and other signs. And you ought to make the same piercing in the lowest place of the pustule, and that which is more prominent; and let the piercing be wet in the length of the body, if the pustules are in the parts of hands and feet, and places of elbow and knee-joints, and tendons, and nerves, and arteries, and finally in all equal places where there is no reflexion.
But in those which are reflected, go with the piercing according to that member.Et si apostema est in corpore, et non in articulatu, sed ad interiorem partem corporis, illa parte faciatur perforatio; nam si facietur ad exteriorem partem, perferet se ad interiorem, et perferet pus per omnia, quae interius sunt.
When however an abscess is in fleshy parts, then it is better to leave the opening of it until its digestion is confirmed as we have said according to the addition.
For if you open it before this, the flow of pus is prolonged from it and there is much filthiness and dirtiness and perhaps its lips are hardened and its depth increased.
And some abscesses are opened according to the width of the body in accordance with need or according to that which the limb requires.
And it is necessary that you apply to small abscesses a small opening and to large abscesses a large opening or sections according to the likeness of the magnitude of the abscess.
And there are abscesses in which it is necessary that the skin be depressed and cut when it has become like a cloth and come to its end having died as happens in many places with scrofula and boils.
And among them are those which are cut by a section having three angles.
And from among them is that from which it is cut like the shape of a bay leaf.
Like an abscess in the groin.
And among them are those in which a round cut and a crescent-shaped cut is applied as well as similar cuts to these.
However that which has no head as in soft superficial abscesses it is necessary to pierce with a superficial piercing or merely a flat one.Et si non potest perferri, debet esse fons abscedens: ne profunditas eius crească et mortificaretur corpus.
And it is necessary, when the abscess is large, and has already collected much matter, that you pierce it so that it does not boil and draw out all the pus at that time; rather, draw a portion of it from it.
Then poultice the abscess until another day.
Then draw out some of the matter again.
Do this many times according to the degree of severity until it is resolved; especially if the patient is weak or a woman with child, or a young child, or an old man; for the animal spirit often departs from its owner with the discharge of matter and perhaps the sick person may die while you are unaware.
Therefore be very careful in this matter.
And after your piercing of these abscesses, it is necessary to cleanse the wound and consider:
If then the wound of the abscess is small, or a flat cut, then apply a bandage made of linen, or old cotton.Et si perperist apud uulnus aliquid pus illius: extrahe illum cum capno eiciens.
And if there is something remaining in the wound: draw it out with a pair of tweezers.And if it is a large abscess, and there are many piercings, then you must insert a bandage into each piercing until they meet.Et si est uulnus apostematis profundum, et in medio stat pus multum: intrahe licinium in omnem fissuram usque ad medium uulnus: et cum licinio intraiecto percuti uulnus cum calcario donec egrediatur pus.
And if you have cut off part of the skin in an apostemate or depressed it in a circumcision: then you should fill it with old cotton, as when a cloth is woven or linen is carded without moisture; and tie it up until the third day.
Then remove it, and dress it with ointment as necessary, until it heals.
But if there is bleeding during your procedure, then apply cold water and vinegar to the cloth after it has been dipped in them, and place it repeatedly on the bleeding site.
But if the bleeding persists, then you should apply treatments and dressings, as I have described elsewhere in this book, from experience.Et si in apostemate abscidisti partem cutis, aut in circumitu concauasti eam: tunc oportet ut impleas eam coto ueteri, aut sicut quando texitur pannus, aut raditur lanugine lini absque humiditate: et stringe ipsum usque ad tertium diem.
And if it is in the wintertime and there are many nerves in the site of the apostemate: then you should pour hot wine and oil onto the powders and place them on the site.Et post dies plurimos quum puluilli fuere remoti, et tibi uidebitur ut potest per se solui cutis: tunc oportet ut facias illum in modum circumcisionis, sicut antea demonstravimus: et curas eum cum unguento quod descripsit Galenus.
And if it is during the summer and the area is fleshy, then you must put small pieces of cotton soaked in water or wine with oil on it, and all that should be cool.
And when it is the third day as we said then you must open the abscess and clean it and apply to its treatment what suits it until it heals.
This then, is what is necessary from a universal knowledge of the cure of abscesses.
According to the half of distinction however, I have already spoken of every abscess, how is the way to its cure in detail specifically.
§ On the cutting of abscesses which occur on the skin of the head.
Chapter 41.
Small abscesses occur on the skin of the head and they are in type of nodules which are contained in sacs as if they were water-soaked eggs.
And their types are many.
Of them are fat: and of them are those who contain moisture like mud: and of them that contain moisture like curds and pus: and similar to these, and of them are those who are hard like stones.
And in the cutting of all these, there is no fear, as long as you do not make an artery contrary to it during its cutting.Et si erit apostema super caput quod pertinet ad crines et uenit ad ipsius sectio, oportet ut loquamur cum medico et faciat ei sectionem intra curam medicorum ut non discedat sanguis per cutem in capite et non perimantur omnia organa quae in capite sunt usque ad mortem.
And the operation on their division is to try them with an instrument whose form came after this, which is called the intromission, until you know what it contains.
For if that which contains moisture, then dry it with a superficial cut according to its length: in this way.
And begin with the cut from line b to line g. When therefore the moisture is evacuated, then peel off the skin that contains the moisture, and let nothing at all remain within it.
For often it returns if anything at all remains within it.Et si non redierit et postea intrinsecus in eadem parte erumpere coepit, sed non potest propter excoriationem intra, quod facies? Then what will you do? Then immerse the wound in Egyptian ointment if it is at hand; and if not, in water and salt; and fill it with that, and leave it until another day.Et si intrinsecus est sanguis et non potest extra, et urit:
It will腐erode itself that which remained from the cyst. Then repeat the above treatment a second and third time with Egyptian cotton, and if necessary a fourth time, until you are sure that nothing remains of the cyst; then heal the wound with ointment until it is cured.
If the pustule contains a soft nodule, then dry it in this way: make an incision in the shape of a cross, and insert probes between the two lips of the incision, and scrape away all the skin; then try to draw out by the root the membrane that contains it.
If however an artery resists you, then do what I will narrate to you next.
And similarly proceed with the pustule if it is stony, by cutting and curing in the same way as already described. The incision into a stony pustule is easier, because there is little blood or moisture.Et si quaesieris quomodo cognoscatur quod apostema habet nodum, tunc cognosces per palpationem digito tuo.
And if you ask how one can tell whether a pustule contains a nodule, then feel it with your finger. And sometimes there are such pustules in the head of some men, from which there is no moisture at all.Et hiis non facias sectiones, sed conare excoriare et desiccare.
Or if the whole pustule cannot be excised without leaving a wound on the head, then proceed as you know: make an incision in the head over the pustule right down to the bone, and try not to break the bone.Or always open these up from below so that the flow of pus is diverted downward.
Then treat them with that which is convenient for their cure.
Of the opening of warts on the neck.
Chapter 42.
These warts often occur on the neck and under the armpits, and in the groin; and sometimes they occur elsewhere in the body.Quo quod apostemata mola, vel verrucae generantur, ea delege illuc cum molare, ut diximus: sed postea cum elixire argenti vivi, vel cum aqua rosat, vel cum alio quolibet antidoto, sicut in morbis internis.
And above those which happen from them in the neck, are one and many; and they beget each other; and every Strophulus of them is within its own tunic, as it is in the nodes and pustules of the head, as we have narrated.
And the kinds of these Strophuli are many.
And from them there are stony ones; and from them are those which contain moisture; and from them are evil ones, which obey not cure.
Therefore, when you see one of them of good disposition on feeling, whose colour is manifestly near to that of the skin, and moves to every part, and is not annexed with the nerves of the neck, nor with the vein, nor with the artery, nor is deep: it behoves that thou cuttest it by a superficial incision from the upper part to the lower part of the body along line b. g., and scrape off its whole skin; and extend two lips of the skin with a hook, or with many hooks, if you need it, as we said in pustules of the head, and draw it out little by little.
And it is to be observed that thou cuttest not a vein or nerve.
And let the instrument of cutting not be very sharp; that it may not add thy hand with the incision, or disturb the feeble, and thou cuttest what is not needful.
But if thou cuttest a vein or artery, or it hinders thee from the operation, then lay on the wound powdered quicklime, or some powders that stop bleeding; and bind up the wound, and leave it, until the keenness of the pustule abates, and the wound softens; or else it begins to fester.
For the blood is stopped by quicklime. Return therefore to thy operation, until thou finishest.Et uide muscas cum pedibus, et uolitantibus.
Then dress it.
If the whole trochlea is cut, then you must bring together the two lips of the wound and dress it immediately, after which you will see that all superfluous matter has completely stopped.
If however you see that the superfluous matter persists due to the size of the trochlea, then you must tend towards cutting at its root and removing it; and administer the stitch which we mentioned.
And if anything is retained in the trochleas from moisture, pierce it with a superficial piercing so that you see its place of maturity and put the piercing below it following what we said before.
Then after the piercing administer a poultice with ointment and similar things to corrode what remains from corruption until you see that the wound is already cleaned; then dress it with generative ointment of flesh until it heals.
¶ Of the cutting of the epiglottis on an ulcer coming inside the throat.Si in gutture subapice uenit apostema, et non potest per se expelli: tunc oportet ut incidas illum apicem super eum, et extrahas.
Chapter XLIII.
The ancient authors wrote that this incision is made on the epiglotis, and I have not seen anyone in our land who performs it; and this is their language on the subject.
But in those who have a synanchia, the incision of the epiglotis should be made; for if it is not performed, all the veins and the lung are affected.
But for those who have a hot ulcer in the mouth or larynx, or two tonsils, when there is no illness in the gullet, it is necessary to use the incision of the epiglotis to avoid destruction caused by pre-aspiration.In habentibus uero morbum in cannali, qui tenet se per dies octo, et non potest expelli, necesse est uti sectione Epiglotis: nam, quando praefationem facit, et cum cibo et cum potu, perit. But when we wish to perform this incision, it is necessary to cut the epiglotis under three circles of the epiglotis, or four, by a small incision in width, between two circles, according to its quantity, so that the incision is not in the cartilage but in the membrane: and this place is suitable for the incision, since it is deprived of flesh, and the blood vessels are distant from it.Prorumpente tamen sanguine, et intrante uenturiom per illum, adduxerit per othium uel per nasum fune, et trahatur ad se uel ad alterum: quod si non fiat, moribus uenit.
If the surgeon is timid then he must stretch the skin of the throat with a hook.
He then searches the skin until he comes to the windpipe; he should open up the blood vessels if he sees anything there.
He then makes a cut in the throat as we have said above: and he should look for some phlegm coming out of it with the blood that has been spilled, and he should remove this.
And leave the wound open for some time.Quod si ueniat sanguis et non teneatur, quod est indicio perniciosa uenationis, tunc debet fieri coagulatio.
If the blood flows and does not stop this is an indication of a bad wound; therefore a clot should be made to stop it.When then the time has come in which one fears burning, bring together the two lips of the skin's wound and cut them off alone without cartilage.
Then administer remedies that cause flesh to grow until it is healed.Et si in aliqua parte ueniat pus, debet esse frictio cum lino et sponso.
Albucasis said.
The sum of this speech which we have narrated, there is no explanation, except when they see that one of these apostemes has already healed the throat of the infirm person: and the infirm person has risen above death, and wants to be cut off by his breath: they cry out to dry up the Epiglottis, so that the infirm person can breathe over the wound with a certain breath, and be saved from death: and because of this they ordered to leave the open wound, until the maliciousness of the disease is consumed, and its malice is three days, and almost itself: then they ordered to sew the wound, and to heal it, until he is healed.
And that which I saw with my own eyes is that a maid took a knife and put it into her throat and cut off a part of the canal of the lung.
And I was called to her cure, and I found her groaning as is the groan of the dead.Et ego adfui cum illa trementi, et tristi, et fuit in pulsu meo, et in uultu meo luctus, et dicens mihi: curuisto me, ut potero uitare, et non uelle morituri?
I undid the wound, and I found blood that had flowed out of the wound.Et fuit pulsus eius perniciosus et mortalis: et uolui curare eam, et non potui.
I was confused that she had not cut the vein or the artery: and the wind was going out from the wound.Et uocavi parentes eius, quod posset sepe curare uulnus infirme per tres dies: et non potuit.
I sewed up the wound and healed it until it was well: and nothing happened to the maid except a hoarseness of voice: and she returned after days to her better condition.Et domus infirme erat exultans, quia saluauit in mortem.
Hence therefore I say: that there is no fear in the cutting of the Epiglottis.Quomodo uero uos curare non potest, sic est, si non est res uestra pernicies?
But how can you not cure, so it is, if your thing is not deadly? § On the cutting of the throat hernia.Et quicunque curat infirme, qui habet herniam in gutture suo, et non curat eam, sed dimittit eum, donec mortuo ueniat: sic est sicut qui uitat hominem pernicem suam, et non curat eum: et moriuntur multi ex his, qui habent hernias in gutture.
Chapter 44.
This hernia of the neck is a large swelling which resembles in colour the skin of the body; it often occurs in women.
It has two forms, either natural or accidental. The natural form is not innate.
The accidental form, however, occurs in two ways; one of these resembles fatty bumps.Et per accidens fit post passionem quodlibet viscera ad gutturas.
And the other is like an aposteme that comes from the congestion of an artery.
And it has a dangerous quality; and therefore it should not be treated with cautery except when it is small, and you may try this out by examining it with the probe.Et si in ipso uideris quod non est ad gutturas, tamen oportet ut excides illum cum ferro et salia.
If therefore you find it is like a fatty lump, and not hanging by any blood vessel, then cut it out as one cuts out nodules; and if it is contained in a cyst, extract the whole with it; but if not, probe all of its interior.Et si uideris quod est ad gutturas, et suspensum cum aliqua uenarum, et non potest excidi: oportet ut perscrutaris totum eius et extrahas quicquid in ipso inueneris sicut antea.
Then treat the wound with what is necessary until it heals.
On incisions for nodules:
CHAPTER 45. There are many kinds of nodules, and I have already described all their kinds in the section on their division; so now let us speak here about the difference between a nodule and an exitus. They are hard to distinguish from each other. Therefore, I say when the exitus has heat and fever, and violent pains until the boiling-over of the superfluity is stilled and the putrefaction completed, then the fever and heat will stop.Sed tamen dolores exstitunt, et debet curari, donec sanetur.
When there is no heat, nor fever, nor pains, and they are contained in the sac called sifachin, which is their proper pouch, and it is according to the color of the body: and its size is like a chickpea, and it becomes like a bean, both larger and smaller.
And they are according to two forms: either fat or containing moisture.
And the colors of moisture are many, as I have said in the division. Therefore, when you come to the cure of a Node, you should examine it and inquire into it first with an instrument that is called Intromissum, according to its form as it will appear in the chapter that comes after this one.
And the way of inquiring into sores and nodes is to take this instrument and insert it into a moist place which you find in the sore; and move your fingers with it little by little until you know that the instrument has already penetrated the skin.Et postea remouesca, et facias illum ad summam cutis, et tu palpans sentias: si percuties locum istum, qui est sub digito tuo, et uiderit dolor, quod scis quod est in cuti profundius, et non in superficiale.
Then you withdraw and make it up to the level of the skin and, feeling with your fingers, you percute that place which is under your finger; if it feels painful, you know that this is in the deeper part of the skin and not superficial. Then move your hand according to the measure of the size of the sore.Et si in illa parte non est dolor quae est sub digito tuo, sed in alia parte apostemati est dolor, scis ergo quod est in superficiale, et non in profundum cutis.
Then extract what has been introduced and examine that which comes out of its tract.
If therefore a flowing moisture comes out, of whatever colour; then dry it up by means of a superficial application, as I have said in the case of other abscesses.
And if no moisture comes out of the tract of the wound, then you may be sure that it is a solid tumour; therefore dry up the surface by means of an application in the form of a cross, as I have before directed: and cut away the skin on all sides with ease, and keep the scythe over the tumour, if you can, so as to extract it entire with its root.
If however the cyst bursts during the operation, and it is not possible to extract it entire, for this often happens, then cut it out bit by bit until there is nothing left of it.Quod autem extraxistis in unoquoque apostematum, illicite stetit ut dixi: et non debes abscindere illud ultra, ne adflicias partem ubi stetit: sed lugebatur et olebatur, donec curaritur.
But that which you have extracted let it stand in the place where I said; and you must not cut away more than enough to get rid of the tumour, lest you hurt the part where it stood: but let it be mourned and oiled till it is cured. For if any little bit of it remains behind, or much, it will become a tumour again in most cases.
If however it conquers you, and some of it remains behind, then fill up the wound with certain sharp corrosive powders at your disposal: and bind up the wound, and place over it that which produces the abscess hot, and treat it according to the rest of the cure till it is healed.Si autem non possis extrahere Nodon cum radice sua, sed disrumpes illum intra uulnus: tunc debes extirpare carnem circum apud operationem usque ad ossa, et pondere super illicite stetit ut dixi: et fac ut non remaneat ex eo aliquid.
If however you are not able to extract the tumour with its root, but burst it within the wound: then you must cut away the flesh round about at the point of operation to the bone, and treat that which lies under as I have said; and see that nothing remains behind of it. If therefore the tumour is large, then you must cut away its two lips, and cure it with that which makes it flesh again. If however the contrary vein beats, or does not beat; then make haste and fill up the place of the incision with powdered zego, and leave it bound for two days, or three, till the wound putrefies and the ebullition of the blood subsides: then return to cut away that which remains behind of the tumour.If therefore a vein beats in the contrary way, cut it through above where the tumour lies; but if it does not beat at all, leave it as it is.
Of instruments for cutting and piercing.
CHAPTER XLVI.
CHAPTER XLVI.There are three forms of introducer, and they are as follows:
Of these, then, one is large, and one is medium, and one is small.Magna forma est qua per grande os in corpori introditur.
Let them be made from iron with four pointed ends that they may close tightly around the entrance of the fistula.
And these are the forms of experiments, namely, piercing; and one of them is called boras, that is, perforer; and they are of three species.
Of these indeed one is great, another middle-sized, and a third little.
They are convenient that they may be introduced into fistulas, and outlets, and fistulas, and abscesses, because of what is between them out of the bones.
And others are made round, pointed, smooth, as of great needles by which they are sewed up, out of bronze indeed, or iron, or silver. And the best of these are those that are made out of bronze.Et alii fiunt tereti in medio, ut in illa quae vocatur trochlea, et sicut est iugum pulli ad trahendam.
And the experiments are also made out of black lead; which are convenient that by them they may experiment on fistulas, whose concavity is reflected, in order that with their suavity they may be reflected with these reflections.
And they are again of three species.Et fiunt Experientiae et ex ferro, et de aere: quae conveniunt ut per illas experiantur fistulae per quos punctus procedit sicut per foramen in ossibus. And experiments are made also out of iron and bronze; which are convenient that by them they may experiment on fistulas through whose point the pus proceeds as through a hole in bones.For indeed some of these are long, others middle-sized, and some are short, according to the quantity of amplitude of the fistula and its straitness. The form of Hooks; and they are of many species.Et fiunt per os ut in illis quae vocantur sondes: et fiunt per foramen ut in illo quod vocant trochlea: et fiunt ad trahadendo, sicut sunt hae quae vocantur sondes ad trahadendas: et fiunt ad punctum claudendam, et ad exitum ex ossibus. Since they are simple, that is, those whose curve is single, and there are three species as you see, the Great, the Medium, and the Small.
And from these are blind hooks: and there are of three species.
And from these are hooks having two curves, and there are of three species; and from these are hooks having three curves, and there are of three species: and all these are necessary in their place.
And these are the forms of the Knives, with which they cut and strip off Nodes and Ulcers; and there are three species; because among them is a great one, a medium one, and a small one.Et sunt necessari in loco suo.
The extremities of them by which the cutting is performed are acute, the other extremities are not acute; and they are not placed except with regard to them, that there may be cauterization with it on the ulcer of a Node by fear of incision of an artery or nerve: and that through it the feeble one may be healed and for a little while find tranquillity from the burning which he has found in the ulcer.
These are the Magids, and there are three species of them.Et sunt necessarii ad caeteros omnes Nodus.
They are made of brass, and are like the Rod with which the alcohol is made; and at its broad end there is a point of the Spatulum covered up; and in it there goes to the insides and outsides when you will, as you see.Et sunt necessarii ad omnes Nodus.
The shape of the spatula which is hidden between the fingers at the perforation of sores: and the sick do not perceive it; and there are three species, great, medium, and small.
The forms of the forceps with which the flow of blood is cut off: and there are three species, great, medium, and small.
Let them be made out of brass or citron-wood, round, a little longer, as you see: and let them be very slender.
And it is necessary that you have with you the great and small kinds of these forceps, that you may cut off the blood quickly in necessity, and then when medicine is not present.
However, you shall not use them to cut off the blood in every place of the body, and you shall not use them except in fleshy places: as on the leg-lizard, and the hip, and the arm-lizard, and the breast, and the belly, and the groin, and similar to these, from fleshy lizards, moist.
And sometimes they make from them other small instruments like pea-podders, according to their shape: with which the blood is cut off when it flows out of the place of phlebotomy, or at the incision of a vein, or artery; and sometimes they are made round in this way.Et fiunt etiam ex eis instrumenta ad excidendum carnem super os utrimque per modum dentis ferri: et alibi quoque secundum necessitatem.
On the cure of the nipples of men which resemble those of women's breasts.
Chapter 47.
Sometimes the nipples of some men become swollen during sleep (i.e., when they start to leak while sleeping) until they resemble women's breasts and remain badly swollen.
Whoever wishes to avoid this should cut crosswise on the nipples in a half-moon shape, from b. to g., according to the following figure; then scrape away all the fat down to the skin.
Then fill the wound with healing ointment.Si tamen superius uenerit apostema, secundum quod paulo ante monuimus: incide de novo lunam super illud et fige sibilum, donec discentiat in locis circumstantibus.
If however a boil appears above the wound, as we warned you about earlier: cut the moon-shaped slit again and apply cauterization, until it breaks in the surrounding areas. Then bring together the two lips of the wound with stitching, and care for it until it heals.
But if the nipple is turned downward and softened due to its size, just as it happens to women: then one should open up both of its upper sides with two cuts in the shape of a half-moon, each cut joined to the other at their ends, until there is a larger line containing a smaller one, according to the following figure; b. to g. Then scrape away the skin between the two lips and remove the fat, and apply what we have said about stitching and powders that are necessary for curing, until it heals.
But if you do not complete the incision as you should because of the inquietude of the patient or due to bleeding: then you should fill the wound with a cauterizing unguent and leave it, until it corrodes what remains of the fat.Postea finda uulnus quod remansit, ut ante diximus, et oportet ut curetur, donec curatur.
Then cut away what remains of the wound as we said earlier, and care for it until it is cured. Then care for it until it is healed.Si mammilla uenerit ad inferiora non propter magnitudinem suam sed propter morbum: tunc fac sicut diximus de mamillarum mulierum curis; donec sanetur.
Of the piercing of a pustule which occurs under the eyelid.
De oculis et morbis earum incidentibus. Of the eye and diseases to which it is subject. Chapters 48. Of the eye and its diseases. These pustules which occur under the eyelid, are of a hard kind resembling warts, some of them contain pus and others water.
Of those therefore which contain water, it is necessary to pierce them with a lunar incision, thus, from b. to g. When then all that is within the pustule has been discharged, fill up the pustule with old cotton and leave it until another day.In quo tempo, si uult, adibiendus est oculus, et recidere debet in loco suo.
Then the bandage is taken off and the wound is treated with a suitable ointment until it is healed.
If the pustule resembles a knot, then split it open as we said before about knots.
But if the wound is such that it needs to emit pus, then apply a cautery as we said before.
§ On the opening of an abscess caused by an artery and vein.
Chapter 49.De sectio apostematis quod accidit in os.
When an artery is burst and the skin above it becomes solidified, then a pustule often results from it; and the same happens with a vein too, that a pustule and swelling occurs in it.
And the signs by which you may know that the pustule and swelling come from an artery or vein are these: for when a pustule comes from an artery, it is long and pressed into the depths of the body; and when you press the pustule with your fingers, you feel as if there were a roar in it.
And that which comes from a vein is round and stands out on the surface of the body.
And it is a mistake to cut into this pustule, especially if it is under the armpit or groin, or on the neck, and in many places of the body; for it is very dangerous.Et multum debet homines temere de his apostematibus, quia multotiens mortales sunt, si sectio super illis facitur: et multum debet medicus curare, ne faciat sibi ullam sectionem in his apostematibus, sed debet confibulare, et in unctione appositis, et in linteo applicando, et in cataplasmatibus, donec resorbuatur.
Therefore it behooves that the care of them should be committed to iron, and whatever of them is also at the ends, or on the head, it behooves that it should be deprived.
Therefore find a section in the skin in length over that which is of them from the opening of the artery.Et si non possit habere luctum ad finem, sed finiat in medio cutis, et intra se confibule: et si finierit intra cutem, debet percutere locum cum ferro, usque ad sanguinem in eo effluendo.
Then open the section with hooks; afterwards the artery: and free it from tunics, until it is laid bare.Et finiat sanguis per uncinem: deinde finiat cum ferro usque ad luctum, et non debet intra se finere.
Then insert a needle under it, and make it penetrate until it reaches the other side; and press the artery with a double thread in two places, according as I taught you in the extraction of the two arteries which are in the temples.Et finiat per eum, et confibule: et postea trahe ut extrahatur, et finiat sanguis per eum: et postea intra se confibule usque ad finem, et resorbatur.
Then stab the space between the two ligaments with a spatulum until all the blood that is in it flows out and the boil dissolves.
Then treat the wound that is producing pus until the ligaments come down: afterwards treat it with appropriate ointments until it heals.
If the boil is due to a cut vein, then you should hold in your hand whatever you can of the boil with the skin.
Then insert a needle under the place which you are holding in your hand and make it penetrate; and let there be in it a double thread, until you pull it out from the other side.
Then tie the boil with a good ligament: according to what I told you in the vein-ligament, from two parts with two ends of thread. But if you are afraid that the thread will be pulled out, then insert another needle with another thread under the whole boil near the incision of the needle; press and tighten your threads in four places.Et erunt duo filii extrahi a latere altero: et resecabuntur inter duos ligamentos.
Then dry up the pustule in its midst until what is inside comes out; then cut away the overhanging skin and let go of what was bound to it.
Then put on top of it a poultice which you have soaked in wine and oil.
Then administer treatment with liniments and ointments until it is healed.
Of the pustule which happens from a twisting of the nerves.
Chapter L.
As the pustule happens in an artery and vein, similarly it happens in nerves; that which has happened to them is a blow, or it has happened from superfluous labor, and likewise; and it occurs most frequently in those places of assistants, or in the heel, and in every place in which they move joints: and it is a grave pustule. Its color resembles the rest of the body, and it is in many dispositions without pain; and when it is pressed with vehemence, it feels in it a weak feeling like torpor.¶ Cum accidat apostema in nervo, et non potest remuere nisi in uirga uia:
And let there not be an ulcerated wound deep in the body, but one that is superficial and under the skin; and let it move to all parts, and not go forward or backward.
And what is in them in the joints should not be entered with an iron instrument.
For indeed there may be a contraction.
In that which is in them in the head or on the forehead, probe under the skin with a spatula.Quidam enim accidere solet ut per se claudicat.
For when it is an ulcerated wound, then hold it with forceps and cut it from the root.Quidam enim multum sanguinis ex se emittunt.
And if it is large, then hang it up with a hook and scrape it; then take it out and close the wound with stitches; and dress it, until it heals.
Of the cutting of an ulcerated wound that occurs in the abdomen.Et primum quod est necesse, uide ut sit uirilis.
And first what is necessary, see that it is a man.CHAPTER 51. It happens to some men many times in their bellies and other parts of their bodies that they are called Fungal Warts, by likeness with fungi.Et multotiens ex his fungis nascuntur lues et pestilentia: namque multae pestilentiae per similitudinem fungorum nascuntur.
And many plagues and pestilences spring from these fungi; for many pestilences spring from a likeness of fungi.The root of which is slender, and the head of which is thick, and their lips are turned inward.Et quibusdam multotiens nascuntur in iis fungi per similitudinem pedum, et alicuius pedum habent habitum.
And in some people there spring fungi by likeness of the feet; and some are like to one foot or another.And there is among them one that is small; and there is among them one that is very large.Et multotiens multas pestilentias et luem generant in ueteribus et in iuventute, et multae mortis occasionem faciunt, ut aiunt medici.
And I indeed have seen a man, and in his belly there were two warts which were more like fungi than anything else; there was no difference between them, they were white, minute-rooted, and their lips were turned inward, and moisture always ran out of them.Et quibusdam nascuntur thelil per similitudinem pedum et manuum, et sunt in his conuersa labia, ut fungis.
I therefore cut into them and found one weighing almost 10 ounces and 8 drams and the other almost 6 drams. The procedure when cutting into them is to consider then whether it is moist and its color is white, moist, fine-rooted: then cut it with a broad spatula, and have cauteries at hand in the fire.
For often much blood is driven out upon its cutting: therefore if blood overcomes you, then cauterize it.
If you see it weak and fearful from the cut with the iron, then take a thread made of lead nicely, and tie it with that: whose mode is whom we said, and let go of it for two days.
Then add to the lead binding.
Therefore you do not cease tightening the lead, as often as it presses into the thelil, until it is cut off and falls away by itself.
But if the thelil has a thick root, then there is some fear and weakness in its cutting especially that which is in the belly.
Yet it is possible to cut through its middle.Quod si non possit tollerare, quia totus aduertitur, et cadat per se, ut diximus: tunc dimitte in thelilis unam diebus, et videas ut cesses in altum intra te: sed non teneas multum.
Then cauterize it so that it does not return.
Then heal it until the wound is cured.
And beware lest you think that the ulcer which is dark coloured, few sensed, and foul looking, is a wart: for it is a cancerous ulcer: and I will come again with the memory of Cancer after this.
¶ Of the cure of the Eminence of the Navel.
Chapter 52.De cura eminentiae Vmbilici.
There are many causes for the hernia of the navel.
Or from fissures in that part which is above the belly; and there comes out of it the thub or intestines, according as happens in other ruptures.
Or from blood that flows from a vein or an artery, as has already been said.
Or from the windiness restrained therein.
But if it is on account of a fissure in the navel and there comes out of it a hernia, then its colour is like that of the body; and it is flabby without pain, and it shows itself in various places.
And if it is on account of the protrusion of intestines, then its place is harder, as we have said, and more painful.Et si ex sanguine uenoso: tunc est color ruber et pulsuos.
And when you press it with your fingers, it hides away; then comes back again, and perhaps there is a noise along with it, and it becomes much larger at the entrance of the bath and after strenuous exertion.
But if it is on account of moisture, then it is flabby; therefore when you press it with your hand, it does not hide away nor grow smaller, nor anything added to it.Et si ex fissura, non est lene sed durum, et occultatur quando premis digitibus tuis: cum autem solutaris, redit.
What if it is due to blood then with these signs appears a pustule changing to blackness from the claw.
But if it is due to born flesh: then it is a grave, thick, hard pustule, and is fixed according to one quantity.
But if it is due to an ulcer then its touch is soft. And the operation in it is, that you consider then, if the protuberance of the navel is due to an artery, or vein, or ulcer: then you must be prohibited from curing it.
For in it there is danger and fear, just as I taught you in the chapter, in which I said pustules due to an artery and vein.
What if the protuberance of the navel is due to the intestine, or a hernia: then you must order the patient, that he hold his breath, and stand straight.Et praecipias ei, quod non recumbat, nisi cum trabe, et super trabe stet intus in uestibus: et ubi recumbit, stet sub capite suae trabe.
Then mark out with cautery around the entire circumference of the navel.
Then tell him to lie down on his back between your hands.
Then circle around the navel with a broad spatula over the area you marked with cautery.
Then extend the center of the abscess upward with a large hook.
Then tie it tightly around its circumference with a strong thread or with a silken bowstring, and let the knot of the ligature be loose.
Then open up the center of the abscess that has been extended above the ligature.
If you find that it is already caught by the ligature, then pull it out of the ligature and thrust your index finger into it, and push the intestine back into the abdomen; and if you find a hernia, then seize it with a hook and cut off its overgrowth.
But if you find that an artery or vein is in your way, then circle around it extensively.
Then return to your incision.
And take two needles and thread them with two strong threads; and thrust the two needles through the abscess around the incision you have made in the shape of a cross, which you will make the needles penetrate.
Then tie the abscess in four places over the needles and if you wish, take out the needles and leave the area, until the flesh putrifies and falls away by itself; or open it when it becomes swollen and putrid.
Then dress the wound with whatever is appropriate from ointments, until it heals.
But if the navel protrudes by reason of a raw mass of flesh in it, or by reason of moisture, then you ought to hollow out the abscess as we have said.Quod si per accidens contingerit, ut carnis ex ulceribus quae non sunt superficies umbilicalis cadant, et non possint durare in carne: et caries faciant intrinsecus, et non possint extendi ad extra: sed cadunt per se in carnem, aut crescunt inter se, et intra se mortificantes, et perire debent per seipsas.
And you shall draw out blood, or moisture, which you find in it.
Then take care of it with that which hardens the place.
¶ OF THE CURE OF CANCER. CHAPTER 53.
I was not able to heal anyone from it; nor have I seen anyone else who has succeeded before me.
And the operation on it, when it is placed as we said, is, that you precede and heal the invalid from the black bile often.
Then bleed him if you find him with a manifest fullness.
Then prepare the invalid with the preparation in which he will be placed with the operation.
Then push into the ulcer with hooks that are suitable for it.
Afterwards hollow it out from every part with the skin, according to feeling, until nothing of its roots remain; and let the blood flow and not cut it off quickly, on the contrary press the places and wipe away the thick blood altogether with your hand or with whatever is possible there of instruments.
But if it makes a contradiction to you the flow of thick blood from the cutting of an artery or vein: then cauterize the vein until the blood is cut off.
Then treat him with the remaining treatment until he is healed.Et si uides in corporibus mensurari, quae non possunt tolleri: aut quae debent esse concauata et excisa: et est necessitas ut cadaver tollatur per omnia loca: cum huiusmodi uiribus:
Of the cure of dropsy.
CHAPTER 42.
We have already described the various forms of dropsy and how the accumulation of water takes place. We have also given the signs of all these forms, together with their treatment by means of medicine.
And that which is cured with iron is only a case of simple ascites; and it does not come near to the case of tympany, nor to that of hyposarka entirely; for this latter is deadly.Cum tamen ferri medicamentum apponitur, non ad omnes species sed ad quosdam: nam cum illo non curatur omnino speciei asclitis nec timpanitis: et pro quo medicari debet, si esset hyposarca, et non potest curari nisi cum diureticis medicinis.
When you have already been treated for this type of hydrops of the tympanic membrane with medicines and the treatment has not worked: then consider.
For if weakness has already followed the illness or there is another illness with it, such as a cough, or looseness of the bowels and similar things, then beware of treating him with iron for there is fear in that.
But if you see the sick person to be overflowing with strength and there is no illness in him except for hydrops alone: and he is not a child or elderly, then the method of operating on him is that you elevate the sick person standing between your hands and the assistant behind him presses his stomach with his hand driving the water to the lower part using the end of a comb.
Then take a smooth, round spatula, in this shape:
It has two pointed parts, one long and sharp like the end of a spatula.Pondus eius sit librae una et demi.
Its weight must be one and a half ounces. However, there should be some small thickness to it so that you do not go through with it during the operation into the intestine and harm it.Et sit concava parte in medio, ut uellet inflatum timpanum sicut domus.
Then consider.
For if the generation of hydrocephalus is from the intestines, then you must enlarge with an incision from the navel a distance of three fingers' breadth, upwards above its lower part towards the chest.
But if the hydrocephalus is caused by disease of the liver, then your incision on the left must be three fingers' breadth from the navel.
And if it is caused by the spleen, then the incision should be on the right side; and it must not be, either, on the side where the sick person wishes to lie, so that no overflow may run into that weak spot.
Then pierce all of the skin with your instrument.
Then insert your instrument into that opening, and lift up your hand with the spatula between the skin and the membrane as though you were flaying it; and the amount to be flayed must be the thickness of a nail, or about that much.Et exsanguina locum istum: et postea apice digiti tuo excoria illum, et aspira illam carnem intra te: et sifica donec sanguis eluat.
Then bleed the spot; and after that pierce it with your fingernail, and draw out the flesh within you; and stretch it till the blood flows out. Then pierce the membrane, until the spatula reaches the empty space; there is where the water lies.
Then draw it out, and insert into that opening an instrument of this shape.
It is like a tube; it is made of silver or brass or bronze, smooth and polished, and at its lower end there is a small opening, and on its sides three openings, two on one side and one on the other; and its tip is split, after the manner of a reed pen, as you see; and at its upper end there is an annulus.
For when the instrument reaches the water, then it flows down over the instrument immediately; so you must evacuate the water in a quantity of about one hour.Et sic facies sicut scripsit Mohannath: "Et fit armilla in extremitate superius instrumenti.
For if you evacuate more than is proper from it, perhaps within an hour the sick person will die through the loss of his animal spirit; or he will suffer a fainting fit which draws near death.Et si tu euacuas minus quam debes: et uenit ad te per modum solutionis animalis sui: tunc debes iterare, donec perficias quantitas mediam in hora.
But empty it out according to its quality and according to what the dispositions of the patient indicate to you from the strength of his pulse and from his goodness.
Then extract the instrument, and retain the water.
This is because it will be retained immediately on account of the skin which retains the orifice that is over the windpipe, about which I have given instructions so that you may pierce it in that manner.
Then repeat with the instrument on the following day if you see that the patient can tolerate it; and also extract a small quantity from the water. Do this for several days without fear, and beware of error: until nothing but a little remains in the water.
But if you are afraid about the patient and you leave a great deal of water behind: then treat him with hot sand burial, and much sweat in the bath and heat of the sun; and wait upon thirst: and treat him with drying medicines until he is cured; and cauterize over the stomach, and liver, and spleen after the extraction of the water, according to what I told you before.
On the treatment of infants who are born with their urinary passage not perforated.Si puer perfores non fuit ut suprascriptum est, et urina fluens in ventrem: si quaesieris de vita infantum qui nascuntur cum ista imperfectione, dicas quod multum laborant, et saepe moriantur, si non possit extrahi aqua.
Chapter 55. When any of the children exit their mother's womb and the fontanel is not perforated, or it is a tight opening, or in an improper place.
It is therefore necessary to promptly assist with its perforation at birth using a very sharp spatulum in the following manner.
Then insert a thin claw of lead into the opening and ligate it; and hold it for three days or four.
When it wants to pass urine, then remove [the claw], and it will void.
Then return  [the claw] to its place.
And if you do not place the lead, now it is possible that urine which passes over the opening does not allow it to close.
But one whose opening is tight is treated with lead as we said for many days until it widens.Et illi cuius locus non est in medio fontis, sed in latere eius, ista medecina faciatur sicut diximus.
But those in whom the opening is not in the middle but on its side, this medicine is performed as we said.But those in whom the opening is not in its proper place are harmed.
Which is, because of those who are born the opening is near the end of the scalp; therefore it cannot void urine towards the front until he lifts his head with his hand towards the upper side.Et idem faciunt cum ceteris qui nascuntur, ne uirga eorum postea viciat. It is not a true disease because the sperm cannot reach the uterus through the vagina normally. This is a very unpleasant disorder.
And the mode of operating on this is to make the sick man lie flat on his back.
Then stretch the head of his penis with your left hand in a violent extension and cut the tip of the head of the penis from the place of the glans, with an awl or with a sharp chisel as if you were cutting a reed or as if you were peeling something so that its middle comes out similar to the head of the penis and so that there is a hole in the middle according to what is proper.
And beware of the flow of blood during your operation.
For it often happens that this happens.Et si quae res non bene sit in medio, sed in locis quibusdam praeteritis:
And if the thing is not good in the middle but in certain places beyond:Then put on him what cuts off the blood and tends to the wound until it heals.
¶ Of those things which happen in the foreskin and the head of the penis, and decay, blackness, and adhesions:Et si in medio praeputii accidat res, et non possit remuersi a loco suo per eam operationem:
And if it happens in the middle of the foreskin, and cannot be moved from its place by that operation:Chapter 56.De uirga uersa.
These things often happen to the penis, and there is a protuberance of foul flesh.Et faciem habet uersam: quare incide in medio locum qui praeuiuit, et resupina eum super dorsum suum, ut cadat sanguis de illo: et cum acumine capite capitis eicere sanguinem multotiens, donec cadat sanguis de omni parte.
And it has a turned appearance: therefore cut in the middle of the protuberance, and press him down on his back so that blood may come from it, and with an awl pierce the head of the penis many times until blood comes from every part. And one is malignant and the other not.Et uirga multotiens accidit, et in praeputio, et multotiens praetercuratur.
Therefore, you should not cut it off with a sharp hook and remove it until you clean all of it.
Then place on top of it a poultice soaked in Egyptian ointment. Then treat it after that with the Daffinic ointment until it is healed.
If the ulcer is malignant and of a foul colour, then you should apply cautery to it after cutting and scraping it.Quamvis autem ulcera maligna sint, si tamen sint recentia, non debent esse cauterizanda sed soluta per aquas et unguenta sola.
If the ulcer is in the foreskin of a circumcised man, and part of it is inside and part of it outside: then you should remove the ulcer that is inside first until it heals; then treat that which is outside: because when you treat them both at once, the foreskin will not heal.
And now blackness and corruption also occur in the testes and foreskin.Et postea facies eum ut puluis, et non poterit curari.
You must therefore hollow out everything that has already turned black and what you see is going bad or is already rotten.
Then cover it with the ointment which has been ground up with honey and the flour of peel from pomegranates and herbs that have been sifted through a sieve.
Then dress it with the rest of the treatment until it gets better.
If however there is bleeding, then use a cautery with a lunar cautery according to this form.
For the cautery is made into two parts at once, namely, for bleeding and wounds when they go bad.Et propterea necesse est ut omnia cibi iuuatiuii sint pro lunu, si quaeratur curatio, et si quaeratur cauteria.
If the head of the vein is eaten away and destroyed all at once, then you must put into the wound a tube made from lead so that it may drip upon it.
But if there is an adhesion of the foreskin to the head of the vein and this indeed does not occur except in the person whose foreskin is intact and has not been circumcised; and sometimes an adhesion occurs because of a wound or ulceration: you must therefore pare it with a blunt Spatula, until the ligament is loosed, and the head of the vein set free from every part.
If it is difficult to distinguish them accurately, then you must pare away something from the head of the vein and from the foreskin.Et sic faciendum est in cunctis quibusque vulneribus quae sunt intra meatum priapi, et extra eum, scilicet intra praeputium et extra eum, donec omnia uulnera liberentur: nam haec sola est cura praeter cauterium, adhaerentia dehiscere.
That is because when the foreskin is thin, it is likely to be pierced quickly on account of its thinness.
Then separate the foreskin and the head of the gland with a piece of fine linen which has been softened in cold water, so that they do not adhere again.
Let it then be treated with a styptic wine until it is healed. ¶ On the purification of infants and the cure if they are hurt in the process.
Chapter LVII.
Circumcision is not a cure for impotence, like other wounds; however, since it is caused by our action, and its use is particularly for children, it is necessary that we perform the operation better and lead to health in an easier way.Antiquo ritu circumciduntur pueruli dies octauis nati.
According to the ancient ritual, children are circumcised on the eighth day of their birth.I say therefore that the ancients did not write about circumcision in any of their books, because they did not use it in their laws, and there is nothing except what we have acquired through experience.Circumcidatur ergo puer octauis natus, et faciatur ritus circumcisionis cum sanguine; quoniam per sanguinem habemus praesentiam corporis sui, ut faciamus uotum pro vita sui.
The child is therefore circumcised on the eighth day of his birth, and the ritual of circumcision is performed with blood; because through blood we have the presentation of his body, to make a vow for the life of his soul.That is because I found most artisans and phlebotomists to use purification by circumcising with a razor, and with tweezers: and they use cauterization, and ligation with thread, and incision with a claw.Quilibet igitur circumciderit puerum suum faciat mundificationem per experimentum, quoniam per experimentum habemus praesentiam corporis sui: faciat uero uotum pro vita animae eius.
I have indeed already tried all these methods and found that there is no better purification with tweezers and binding with thread.
For when one purifies with a knife, the skin often slips away.
For the skin of the foreskin has two layers; therefore perhaps the upper skin is cut and it slips on the lower layer: one must therefore be careful in making the incision lest he cut the other and cause pain.
And when purification is made with tweezers, that is, with the fingers, which surgeons use, it does not secure the incision of the end of the male member; for perhaps it will enter into its orifice.Et ego quidem iam probaui omnes istos modi, et non inueni meliorem mundificatione cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo.
And I indeed have already tried all these methods and found that there is no better purification with tweezers and binding with thread.But when purification is made with a horn, perhaps the iron will slip out and ruin your operation; and indeed the skin of the child is short by nature, and many are born so that they do not need purification; and I have already seen this.
But the purification with tweezers and binding with thread has proved a good experiment for me; for the tweezers are proportionate to the incision; therefore the sharpness which is above is like that which is below.Et si mundificaveris cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo: quandoque facies, quoniam postea non potes de novo iterum mundificare.
But if you purify with tweezers and binding with thread: sometimes you will do it, because afterwards you cannot again purify anew.When therefore you press your hand, the two sharpnesses are proportioned and they incise according to one operation in one time; and compression is made a similar figure, holding the skin of the foreskin from every part, with which there does not fall error at all.
And the method of the proper operation is, that you make an estimate, especially of the boy, if he is of those who understand a little, that you do not do it unless you tie only the thread in his foreskin; and you leave him until another day.Et quod facis ut non cadat incisio in alium diem: et si te memento teneat, facies iterum: et sic perinde procedes usque ad finem.
Then let him enjoy and rejoice in every way possible for you according to his understanding.
Then insert your hand into his penis, and blow on the skin, and draw it upward, until the head of the foreskin comes out.
Then cleanse it from what gathers in it of filthiness.
Then tie the marked place with double thread.
Afterwards, tie it a little lower with another ligature in the same way. Then hold with your index finger and thumb the spot of the lower ligature well, and cut between the two ligatures.
Then lift the skin upward quickly, and draw out the head of the foreskin.
Then let the blood run slowly (for it is better so), and put powder on top; and over the powder a cloth in which is spread the yolk of an egg beaten with rosewater, mixed with rose oil. Fresh is good; and let him remain over it until another day; and care for him with the rest of the cure, until he is healed.
And this is the shape of the scissors for cleansing.
Let there be two flat ends, and let them come together; so that the point of the branch does not come out in them; and let the length of the two sharp parts be equal to the length of two handles alike.
But the error falling into cleansing is: for perhaps all the inner skin escapes, or a part of it at the incision.Error uero cadens in ligatura est: quod non est ligaturus per totum circum. But the error falling into tying is: that it is not tied all the way around. Therefore you ought to lengthen it with your nail an hour before posting the place; and cut it according to equality.Et postea liges cum filo.
If you cannot pull it out with your nail, then extract it with a hook and cut it.
Si autem praeterierint ei tres dies, et remanet quod est sub uirga inflatum, apostematum: tunc dimitte illud, donec sedetur apostema calidum, et excoria illud cum facilitate, et incide illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi: et caue tibi a capite uirgae.
Non enim nocebit ei illud.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod consolidat uulnus ex pulueribus, quos narrauimus in tractatu de pulueribus: et si inciditur ex cute supra mensuram, et euadit ad superiora, non nocet ei illud etiam.Si autem esset in fine, et non posset extrahi per uncino: tunc incide eam cum facie ad modum quod descripsimus, et cura illum locum quia multum est vulnerabilem.
Si autem esset in fine, et non posset extrahi per uncino: tunc incide eam cum facie ad modum quod descripsimus, et cura illum locum quia multum est vulnerabilem.Cura ergo illud cum eo quod diximus, donec sanetur.
¶ De extractione Urinae retentae in vesica.Albus dictus: Cum uisicum et urinam in vesica retentam, extrahere debes per uulnus, quia multum nocebit ei, et moriatur, si non eruitur.
Chapter 58.
Chapter 58. Retention of urine in the bladder is caused by scar tissue resulting from stone or clotted blood or pus or granulation tissue and similar conditions arising from the modes of treatment we have described for diseases of the bladder.
And if he does not pass urine and you observe that the retention is due to a stone which has already entered into the neck of the bladder, then it behooves that he be treated while lying on his back with his knees bent.
Then let his feet be placed upon his back and he should stretch his abdomen from the upper part of his back and as much as possible he should strain to pass urine.Postea debet se convertire ad laterem, et iterum de novo stringere, et postea per uerticem.
It is therefore necessary that the throat of the ureter be directed backwards in order for the stone to be expelled; why it is cured by urination.
If it is not cured by what we have said, and the matter remains on the sick person, then it is necessary to extract it with an instrument called a syringe, which has this form: let it be made of silver, and be slender, smooth, hollow as a bird's feather in its thinness, long as half a palm, and let it have a slender cannula at its head.
And the way of using the syringe is as follows: take a doubled thread, and tie at its end some wool or cotton, a good ligature; and insert the end of the thread into the lower part of the syringe, and cut with scissors if anything hangs out of the wool, but push it in the cannula with the swelling, just as you would do with an aloe.Et sic per totum exitem Urinae: et postea trahas filum, et loquebis cum eum qui intus est: ueluti loquerer ad oarım de lignis, ut inuehendo remoueras.
Then smear the syringe with oil or butter, and egg white; and let the sick person sit on a seat, and embrocate his urethra and its foreskin with oils moistened with olive oil and lukewarm water.Et postea inunge siringam cum oleo liuido, et introeit eam per uirgam, usque ad mediam partem: et illa manet in ea loca, quae loquendo nuper nominauimus, donec trahatis filum, et per totum exitus Urinae intromittatis, usque ad primam partem.
Then introduce the syringe into the urethra with ease until it reaches the root of the urethra.Et trahatis siringam ad se: et loquebis cum eum qui intus est, ut remoueras eum per totum exitum Urinae, donec remoueat lapidem: sed videas ne remoueres siringam contra radicem urinae: nam si contra remoueris, ueluti conuertendo remoueras eam in interiorem partem.
Then pull the syringe back to yourself, and talk to him who is inside, in order to move it through the whole urethra until he expels the stone; but see that you do not move the syringe against the root of the urethra, for if you push against it, as by turning, you will move it into an inner part.Then double it above from the navel.Postea trahatis eam ad mediam partem: et remoueat eam contra radicem urinae, donec loquatur cum eum qui intus est, usque ad extremitatem urinae. Then push the syringe into it until it reaches the bladder, and let the patient feel that it has reached an empty space; this is not done in this order unless because the passage through which it goes has a bend in it.
Then gradually extend the thread with wool.
For the needle will follow the wool.
Then withdraw the thread and cause the urine to flow through its passage; take the syringe again and do not cease doing this until the bladder is emptied and the patient feels relief. Of the quality of enema with a water clock.
CHAPTER 59.
For it is deaf, that is, closed.
And in it are three openings, two on one side and one on the other as you see.
And the hollow space in which is that which drives it shall be according to the amount which it fills without addition until when something is drawn with it from moistures; and when it is driven, it is expelled with it to a distance: according as it does the Greek fire which is projected in martial contests.
When therefore you wish to project moistures into the bladder, insert the end of the water clock into the moisture and draw with it that which drives it upward; for the moisture is drawn into the hollow space of the water clock. Then insert its end into the urethra as we have narrated in the syringe.Et impelle siringam intra ipsam, donec perueniat ad uesicam: et sentiat eam infirmus iam peruenisse ad rem uacuam.
Then press on the moisture with what pushes it for that moisture will immediately reach the artery so that the sick person feels it. Here is a fine enema by which an artery can be enemaed:
Then introduce a strong thread into those foramen, as they are unwound. Then unite the ring, as it is united to its fellow: afterwards you put into it that which you wish out of moist things, and oils, and waters.
Then tie it up in the instrument: and do with it as you did with the sac out of squeezing by hand, until the moisture reaches the sac.
Of the extraction of a stone.
CHAPTER LX. We have already spoken about the kinds of stones, and their cure by remedies; and I have said the difference between a stone generated in the kidneys, and a sac, and its signs altogether; and I have said that there is a stone in which falls operation by hand, and incision: and it is a stone generated in a sac properly speaking; and he who lies in a scabbard. And I am narrating it with explicit exposition and abbreviation.
I say therefore, that a stone generated in a sac, mostly happens to children.Et saepe illi morborum morientur, ante quam percipiant de ista passione: et saepe uenit ad mortem prius quam in uesica cadat Lapis, qui fuit generatus in renibus, cum dolore multo et magna contorsione corporis.
And from the signs of this is that urine flows out of his penis like water in its thinness; and there appears in it white sand, and he rubs his penis with it, and struggles with it, and often it hangs down. Then it stands up, and comes out of the anus along with it in many of them.
And it is easy to cure children up until they reach fourteen years old.
But it is difficult in the elderly.
And as for young men it is medium, because of that which is between them; and if the stone is larger, then its cure is easier, but if smaller, then its cure is more difficult.
So when we come to the cure, it is fitting in the first place that we cleanse the invalid with a clyster which will remove all the excrement which is in his intestines; for this at times prevents the discovery of the stone during examination. Then let the invalid be received with his feet raised, and shaken, and moved about to the lower parts so that the stone will go down into the depth of the ureter or leap out of a high place many times.Et si non possit concutiari per pauperem, accipiat multum uini et mulsis in eo: et faciunt illum ad modum quod diximus.
Then let him sit between your hands prepared as aforesaid, and let his hands be under his buttocks so that the whole ureter is inclined downward towards the lower parts.And postea concute illum modice: et si uideris Lapis aliquid moliendi, et non possit per uesicum egredi, tunde eum in manibus tuarunt: et sal et mulsis in eo.
Then examine him and touch him externally.
If you feel a stone in the space then proceed immediately with an incision over it.
If it does not drop at all under your touch, then you must wipe the index finger with oil from the left hand, if the patient is a weak boy; or the middle finger if he is a healthy young man: and insert it into his anus, and examine for the stone until it lies beneath your finger, and gradually turn it towards the urethra.
Then press on it with your finger and push it outwards towards the place of incision which you intend; and instruct one assistant to press the penis with his hand, and tell another assistant to extend the testicles upwards with his right hand and move the skin which is under the testicles in the lower part of the incision.
Then insert a spathe with a blade of this shape.
And locate the space between the anus and testicles, not in the middle but on the left side of the scrotum: and make the incision over the stone, with your finger in the anus; and let the incision be transverse so that it is wide externally and narrow internally according to the extent that the exit of the stone may be possible.
For perhaps the finger which is in the anus compresses the stone at the incision and it will exit without difficulty.Et si non cadat, tu facies sicut dixi tibi antea.
And know that from Stone comes he whose corners and edges are hard, wherefore his exit is difficult because of this.
And from it comes the smooth one, like a gland, and round; and its exit is made easy.
And to him therefore who has corners and edges add in the wound.
If it does not come out thus, then one must work on top of him, or press upon him with a well-shaped instrument whose end is like the Moon, which presses upon the Stone and does not depart from it; or put under him a subtle instrument, hooked at the end.
If you cannot work on top of it, then enlarge the wound a little.Et postea lenire cum gesti cuius extremitas sit sicut Luna: et sic egredietur.
And afterwards smooth it with an instrument whose end is like the Moon; and thus it will come out.If something holds you back by means of blood, cut it away with a razor.
But if there is more than one stone, then push first the large one to the mouth of the ureter.Et scias quod si lapis est in renibus et non potest egredi per os uessicarum, sed debet egredi per altam partem: et impelle illum ad os uesicarum usque ad quaedam ubi illa non possunt ire plus: et ita permanens in ea egredietur super uestem.
And know that if the stone is in the kidneys and cannot exit through the mouth of the ureter, but must exit through the upper part: push it to the mouth of the ureter until a certain point where they cannot go further; thus remaining there, it will exit over the vest.Then cut on top of it.
Afterwards push a small one after that one; and likewise do if there are more than two.Et scias quod si lapis est minus quam unius palmus, et non potest egredi per os uessicarum, sed debet egredi per altam partem: et fac similiter ut superius dictum est, donec egrediatur in ubi illa non possunt ire plus.
If it is very large then there will be ignorance as to whether to cut on top of it with a large incision.
Because one of two things happens to the sick man, either he dies or a constant flow of urine occurs because the place does not heal at all.
But carry out the expulsion of it until it comes out; or probe his fracture with tweezers, until you pull it out bit by bit.
When therefore you have finished the operation, then fill the wound with frankincense and dragon's blood, and bind it up and put on top of it a poultice infused in oil and wine or rose-oil and cold water, so that the hot ulcer may be cooled down.
Then bind up the sick man over his neck, and do not loose the bandage until the third day.
When you have loosed him therefore, wash the place with water and plenty of oil.
Then heal it with diaphenic ointment and basilic ointment until he is healed.
But if the wound should become a hot ulcer, and there be corruption, and things like that, as though the blood were congealed in the ureter, and the urine be hindered from coming away, and this may be known by the issue of blood with the urine; then give him hellebore to drink,
Insert therefore your finger into the wound and draw out the blood.
For if it remains there it will cause corruption in the ureter and the decay of its membrane.
Then wash the wound with vinegar and water and salt, and apply to it any suitable poultice from what is at hand until it is healed.And if there should be a wound in the ureter itself, as though made by an iron tool or some other instrument, which has caused bleeding and is very painful, and there are great distress and fever: then give him a strong drink to drink so that he may pass the stone.
And during all the hours of the cure, it is necessary to bind and compress two thighs, because of the medicines that are laid on top of the wound.
If a small stone is lodged in the ureter, and blocks it, then treat it as I described before you come to any incision.If he has a stone that is very large, so that it cannot be cut up into pieces, nor taken out whole; and if there is great difficulty and fever because of it: cut off both testicles, and thus free him from his suffering.
You are often excused from a section by this treatment, for I have already tried it. And it is, to take the perforator of steel, whose shape is thus, triangular-ended, acute, fixed in wood.
Then take a thread and tie with it the vein under the stone so that it does not return to the groove.
Then introduce the perforator of steel into the vein with ease until the perforator reaches the stone; and turn the perforator by hand in the stone little by little; and you will perceive its perforation, until you make it penetrate from the other side.
For the urine is evacuated at once.
Then press your hand on that which remains of the stone from the outer part of the vein.
For it is broken, and comes out with the urine, and the invalid is healed.Et non debet omnino a te recidere ad sectionem postea.
If, however, this treatment is not prepared for you on account of something which hinders from it, then tie one thread under the stone and another above.Deinde prementes ut supra, per uirgam infixa, facies penetrare ferrum: sed non debet proficere ad externum: nam contra uitam et remansit, quae prius fuit, et magis offendit urinam. Then cut over the stone within the very cord between the two ligatures.
Then extract it.
Afterwards untie the ligature and cleanse the frozen blood which is found in the wound.
And it is not necessary to have the thread under the stone except in order that it may not return into the ureter; and another ligature above it, except so that when the thread is untied after the extraction of the stone the skin may return to its place and cover the wound; and on this account you must draw the skin up towards the top when you tie the upper thread, in order that it may return to its place, as we have said, and cover the wound.
¶ Of the extraction of stones in women.Verum est, et ex perientia demonstravit, si mulier habet lapidem sub truncato, seu in quo libet locorum, quod non debet extendi ad urinam, sed debet esse in locis ut in vagine, vel in vulua.
Chapter 61.Indeed, and experience has demonstrated that if a woman has a stone under the pubic bone, or in whatever part it may be, it must not extend into the urethra but rather be located as in the vagina, or in the vulva.
Little stone is generated in women.Quia autem multum differt extractio lapidis mulierum ab homine, et si quid differtur in muliere, magis debet esse per vaginam extractio; et propter hoc faciemus incisionem pro extractione in vulua, vel in vagine.
Because, however, the extraction of stones in women differs much from men, and if anything is to differ in a woman, it must be more by way of the vagina; and because of this we will make the incision for the extraction in the vulva or in the vagina.If, however, a stone should occur in any of them, then treatment is difficult and prohibited on account of many considerations.
One of their difficulties is that the woman may be a virgin.In this case indeed it is not lawful to make an incision in the vulva or vagina; but you must extract the stone from the urethra, as we shall say below.Deinde si lapis non potest extendi ad vaginam seu vulvam, et est in uretra, vel in uretere: quae sunt ubi urina extravagitur: et urina manat per ureterem, et per uretram: et lapis ibi debet esse: facies incisionem super uretram de latere uulue lateraliter, et extrahes lapidem. And second, because you will not find a woman who reveals herself to a doctor when she is chaste, or from those who have husbands.
Third, because you will not find a woman well versed in this art, especially the operation with the hand.
And fourth is the distance from the stone's location; therefore it requires a deep incision and there is fear in that.
If necessity prompts this, then you should take a doctor woman, well versed; and little of these is found.
If however you are deprived of these, then seek a chaste doctor, subtle and present a woman obstetrician well learned in the affairs of women, or a woman who proclaims a part of the art: make therefore her present, and especially to her, so that she makes all that you instruct her from the investigation over the stone. In the first place it is, so that she looks if the woman is a virgin; then it behoves her to insert her finger into her anus, and seek the stone.Si autem non potest intrare: sed ad ueterem partem prope excurrit: et aliter non intrauit nisi cum dolore: oportet ut intromittat manum, et quaerat illuc.
If however she cannot enter: but to the old part near runs; and otherwise did not enter except with pain: it behoves her to insert her hand, and seek there.If therefore she finds it, seize it under her finger, and then instruct the obstetrician, to insert his finger into the vagina of the infirm woman, and seek over the stone, after he puts his left hand over the pubic bone, and compresses it with a good compression. If therefore she finds the stone, then it behoves her to move it gradually from the opening of the urethra to the lower parts with utmost strength, until she reaches with it to the root of the hip.Et postea oportet ut intromittat manum suam in uesicam: et quaerat super lapidem in illo loco: sique inuenit eum, ponat super caput uirgis, et praecipiat obstetrici, ut trahat eum cum summa uirtute sua.
Then it behoves her to insert her hand into the urethra and seek over the stone at that place; and if she finds it, put it above the head of the virgin and instruct the obstetrician to pull it with utmost strength.Then she shall cut over him at the opposition of the middle of the urethra at the root of the hip, from whatever side is prepared for her, and feels the stone in that part; and her finger not be moved away from the stone, seizing under it; and let the incision be small in the beginning.
Then insert a needle into that section.
If he then feels the stone, he shall add to that section, according to the quantity which it will pass out from it.
And know, that there are many kinds of stones. Of these some are small and large; others smooth, rough, long and rounded with branches.Quod si non sentit lapidem sed sentit carne solam, tunc scit quod non est in sectione lapidis, sed in carni tantum et excoecat eam.
If he does not feel the stone but only the flesh, then he knows that there is no stone present but only flesh and he burns it.Know therefore its appearance so that you may know through this what you see.
If then the blood overcomes you, add crushed garlic to the wound and hold it there for an hour until the bleeding stops.
If you are overcome by blood flow and you know that the blood flow is from an artery which has been cut; then put powder on the wound and hold it with decent compression; do not let go of it; leave the stone, do not extract it.Itaque in his, qui habent lites in urethra seu in vesica, non ponas te in periculum mortis, sed trahas lapidem cum instrumentis et praeparationibus quae dixi: et si non possis extrahere lapidem integru, scies quod disces de illo ut suprascindatur: ita enim faciendum est.
For perhaps the frail woman will die.
Then treat the wound.
When therefore the sharpness of the blood is assuaged after a few days and the part putrifies, then return to your operation until the pus flows out.
Of the cutting for an aqueous hernia.
CHAPTER 62.
An aqueous varicocele is not a varicocele, except an accumulation of moisture in the white fascia that encloses the testicle containing the ovum; and it is called a hydrocele. And sometimes it is in its own pouch which nature made for it in the part of the scrotum, and is thought to be another ovum; and that is a cutis of the testicle between the white fascia, which we said above; and this does not occur but rarely.¶ De hernia aquosa infanti.
And the generation of this varicocele is from the weakness that occurs to the testicles; therefore this matter flows down to them.¶ Of an aquatic hernia in an infant.
And sometimes it happens from a blow on the testicles.
And this moisture has many colors.¶ De sectione varicocelique. Or its color is declining towards citron, or it is blood-red, or it is foul, black, or it is watery white, and that is what is most.¶ Of the cutting of a varicocele.
For if it is in the white fascia which we said, then the pustule is round and a little long like the shape of an ovum; and the testicle does not appear, because moisture contains it from every part.¶ De ramice aquosa post sectam.
And if the moisture is in its own pouch, then the pustule is round with a part of an ovum, and because of this man thinks that it is another ovum.¶ Of a watery varicocele after cutting.
And if the moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the white fascia, then it falls under the senses.¶ De ramice aquosa in muliere.
When you see moisture's color then test for the moisture's color with a square piece of cotton which has preceded the form.
According to what emerges in the trace of the Intromission, judge about that which is between it.
When therefore we come to the cure with iron, then it is fitting that you should command the sick person to be bled if possible and see his body full.
Then let him lie on his back on a high thing a little, and put under him many garments.
Then sit you on his left, and command the minister to sit on his right, who should stretch out his arm to one of two sides of the skin of the testicles, and to the part of the navel.
Then take a wide spathe and cut the skin of the testicles from the middle through length, up to near the white part that encompasses it; and peel it and observe, or beware from this, lest you cut the sac: and let your peeling be from the part which hangs with the egg more; and scrutinize sutilly with the peeling according to the quantity that you can.
Then pierce the full sac with a wide piercing, and draw out all the water.Et si non possit extrahere totam aquam, extrahito illam usque sub uigintimils quolibet perfora: et intra perforationes perfuse vino rubro multum, ut lue illius inhaereat: et praecipe infirmo, ut sediat super altum, donec omnia aqua et vinum eluatur. And if you cannot draw out all the water, draw it out to below twenty-thousandth each piercing; and pour wine into the piercings, so that its glue might adhere: and command the sick person to sit on a high thing, until all the water and wine are washed away.Then separate between two lips of the cut with hooks, and extend the sac to the upper parts, and do not touch the skin of the testicles encompassing it; and cut into the sac in whatever way is possible for you to cut it, or with its totality, or a bit, especially its thin side.
For if you do not scrutinize exquisitely, there is no security in his cut, but the water returns.Et praecipe infirmo, ut sediat super altum usque ad uigintimils quolibet dies, donec lues illius perfundatur: et si non possit fieri, ut sit super altum, praecipue nocte: et ponas super eum pannos multos et pedales, donec omnia aqua eluatur.
If however it protrudes outward from its skin at the time of your operation: then when you have finished making the incision, draw it back inside.
Then sew together the two lips of the skin of the testicles with a stitch.
Then treat it like the other wounds until it heals.
If you find the testicle affected with gangrene of another kind, then you must tie off the vessels that are the support, fearing a flow of blood.
Then cut off the testicle with its support and remove the testicle; then treat that with what we have said.
If however water has collected in two parts, then you should know that there are two branches; therefore cut off the other part as you did with the first, equally.Deinde curato cum eo quod diximus.
And if it suits you that it is one operation, then do it; and then wipe away the blood.
And insert into the incisions wool which is soaked in oil or rose oil; and place outside another wool which you have soaked in wine and oil and spread it over both testicles, and apply a poultice over their bellies: and place above double rags, and these are sheets; and tie them above with a bandage, which has six turns according to this shape.
Then they take two rags which have been heated and filled with wool soaked in wine according to this similarity; and the ends by which it is pressed from the crotch or with wet wool; and they are bound up with a strap around the waist of the arms: and one end takes on the buttock up to the back, and the second takes to the part of the breast; and two ends below over the two thighs, and two other ends above the two groins, and it is all tied up in the waist of the arms.
And whenever it is artificially medicated with a brand in the place of the incision with iron: and there is to take the brand with a thin knife, and burn with it the skin of the testicles: and it is lit according to what we narrated; until when the white containing water is broken: then take the brand according to this shape.
It assimilates the Greek letter.
Then pierce it with that needle and heat it until all moisture is driven out.
Then extend the hook with claws and scrape off the scabs with a thin heated cautery, and cut into it as much as you can, until you have removed all of it.
And beware that the fire touches the egg.
And know that this operation is safer and further from bloodletting, and better than operation with cutting.
However, if it causes you distress at the time of cutting or cauterization, a hot pustule, or bleeding, or anything else: then you should treat what is causing you distress with treatment that is appropriate for him, according to what has been mentioned earlier.Et sciatis quod si illi non est salus nisi in sectione aut in cauterio subtili:
However, if he is feeble and fearful, and does not hope for salvation through this operation, because of his horror: then administer the piercing according to what I narrate to you: and it is this.Perfora cum siface subtili inter lacrimales osseos, qui est super nasum, ubi sunt aliae duae perforationes, quod vocatur naris.
When you are certain in yourself through that which we mentioned about the signs that the ramus is watery: then you should cause the feeble person to sit on an elevated seat.Et habeto perfora cum siface subtili, et introduxit eam per illum, donec egrediatur sanguis omnino: et fac ut non tangat super latus alium.
Then pierce the pustule on its lower part with a broad spatulum: and place the piercing according to the length of the body, and let it be an ample opening, until all water flows out.Postea perfora cum siface subtili in superius parte sui super illum punctum: et fac ut non tangat super latus alium: et facit illum secundum quod possibile sit tibi, donec egrediatur sanguis, et facit ut currat tota aqua de ramus.
Then put a pad over the wound and bandage it up, and let him run about until the wound is healed.
If, however, there is resistance to the flow of water when you pierce the wound; and this is due only to the white membrane obstructing the mouth of the wound and preventing the escape of the water; then you must thrust a feather into the wound or an instrument like that used in extracting water from hydroceles - as described above; or you may add a little something to the operation on the wound.
You may be sure that the water will return and collect again about six months later or thereabouts.
When it has collected, then it must be drawn off in the same way; and the sick man will go on to a complete recovery.
On the treatment of a fleshy growth [tumour].Et postea:
And next:Chapter 63.De cura uulnus quod facit ramus arcis seu pedis in loco ubi trahitur flos in codo: et est quasi lues, et ex quo fluunt sanguis et aqua, si non curatur:
You should know that in cutting above this ramus there is danger of causing harm in many instances.
Therefore it seems to me that one ought not to neglect this.
And I remember the operation on it and the appearance of the abscess.
I say then that many abscesses occur on the bodies from which the testicles are formed; and this happens for many reasons, namely. Or from an acute surplus or sharp one, which flows to the testicles.Et est uere testiculo eius superfluitatem et uenena.
Or from a blow.And there is a truth that the testicle has superfluity and venom.Or from compression.
And the color of the abscess is according to the color of the body, and it does not hurt; and the abscess is heavy.Et ex ea debet decurre materia acri, et faciunt urina sanguinolenta.
And from it should flow a sharp material, and make bloody urine.And perhaps there is an abscess of stone, whose color is brown, and it has no sensation.
And sometimes it occurs from the nodules of the arteries, and their inflammation: as has already been mentioned; or from the distention of veins.Et fit apostema in testiculis et scrotum: et non debet facere apostema cum testiculo in ea parte, sed debet facere in parte posterior scroti.
And an abscess occurs on the testicles and scrotum; and it should not cause an abscess with the testicle in that part, but it should occur in the posterior part of the scrotum.So whatever is from them from the distention of the arteries is known by the appearance of the abscess when you press it with your fingers.
And one must not touch it at all.Et cognoscitur per uenam testiculi, quando debet fluere in ea: nam debet fluere materia acri, et color eius uenae debet esse sanguinolenta.
But what happens as a result of the swelling of veins does not scatter when pressed with fingers. And now it is possible to make an incision above this type and on the other meats: and is, as if he cut the skin of the testicles.
Then extend the egg upwards, and extract it with a white needle; and release the scrotum from the veins, and ligate the veins; and cut the scrotum after you have released it from all its parts on every side.
If the egg is united with those meats that are born, then you must pull the egg, and cut it. And if there is adhesion between something of the testicle, or between that which is in the veins; then you must release all that adhesion, and cut it with a round incision.
But if there is born meat in the place of adhesion which is behind; then you must cut all of it, and extract the egg, as we said. When then your operation is complete, then fill the wound with wool steeped in rose oil and wine; then cure it with the rest of the cure, until it heals.
¶ Of the cure of Warts, which is with the Vine.
Chapter 64.
It is seen to be an ulcer that is not wrapped in a bandage, similar to a wart, with the softening of the testicles; and it is difficult on the weak movement and exercise, and walking.Et si post haec fit diuisionis, et adhaerendo ouum inter carnes: tunc debet procedere ad auferendum auum, et extrahe oum cum uite, et ligat, sicut diximus in anteoio capite.
And in the treatment of this disease there is fear because of that from which it came.
However, we should operate on it as the first ones did. I say therefore that you ought to make the invalid sit in a chair elevated.
Then cut with a broad, sharp knife in a crosswise incision through the skin of the foreskin until you have exposed the glans.
Then scrape off all of the skin, just as we told you in the extraction of the arteries which are in the testicles.
Then cut them through the middle with a straight incision according to the length of the body, and draw out that which is collected from the filthy corrupt humors.
Then treat the wound with treatment of the other wounds, in which you wish to generate pus so that the skin which nourishes one testicle will fall away.
For it is not harmful through that.
But if all of the veins happen, then it is necessary that the testicles be extracted with their skin; so that their food not be cut off because of the incision, and they waste away, or dry up, and are not a burden with them.
¶ Of the treatment of intestinal hernia. Chapter 65.
Therefore, the intestines descend from that rupture to one testicle.Et est causa huius in celeritate motus, et in tabesca per corporis laborem, et in timore, quae accidunt per calidum in corpore humido: nam pro illo motu per corporis uiscerum, urina, et semina ex ea scaturgant.
And this rupture is either from a blow or from an extension.
And these two types occur for many reasons. Or from a blow. Or from a fall.Et haec Ruptura est aut ex sifach, aut extensione eius. Or from a cry.Aut ex sudore. Or from the rising of a heavy object and similar [actions].
And the sign [of a rupture], when it is due to an extension of the scrotum, is:
It happens gradually over a long time, and does not happen suddenly; and it is an even wound deep down because the scrotum compresses the intestine.
And the sign of it when it is due to a cut on the scrotum, because it makes a very painful sensation happen suddenly at the beginning; and the wound is different, appearing just under the skin nearby; and that is due to the exit of the intestine and its course towards the exterior of the scrotum.Et haec Ruptura est aut ex sifach, aut extensione eius.
And sometimes it goes out with the intestine like a berry; and this is called Intestinal Beribri, and a hernia: and sometimes it happens with windiness.Et haec Ruptura est aut ex sifach, aut extensione eius.Et fit in virgine sub virga.
And it happens in a virgin under the rod.And sometimes excrement runs into the intestine and is retained there; and this is the peril of the patient: because it makes a very painful sensation happen, especially when it is pressed.Et haec Ruptura est aut ex sifach, aut extensione eius.Et facit illum dolere uirginitatem et in postea.
And it makes the virginity hurt then and afterwards.And in the cure of cases of this kind of disease with iron there is danger; therefore, it is necessary to be careful about that.Et haec Ruptura est aut ex sifach, aut extensione eius.Et facit illum dolere uirginitatem et in postea.Et fit cum turgescite.
And it happens with swelling.And the way of operating is to order the patient to return the intestine with his hand into the concavity of his body if it resists returning.Et haec Ruptura est aut ex sifach, aut extensione eius.Et facit illum dolere uirginitatem et in postea.Et fit cum turgescite.
Then he is laid back over his neck between your hands, and you lift up his legs.Et haec Ruptura est aut ex sifach, aut extensione eius.Et facit illum dolere uirginitatem et in postea.Et fit cum turgescite.Deinde resupinetur super collum suum inter manos tuas: et eleua crura eius.
Then extend the skin which follows the skin towards the upper part and cut through all the skin of the testes in its length.
Then fix with two hooks of the lips of the incision, according to what you need in order to open up the incision with them; and let the incision be according to the amount so that an egg can come out from it.
Then strip the foreskin of the penis and what is under the skin of the testes until when the foreskin is stripped white, hard from every part: then insert your index finger in that which follows the testis, in that which is between the white foreskin, which is under the skin of the egg, and between the foreskin according to the second, and complete with it the adhesion which is in the posterior part of the egg.
Then move with your right hand towards the inner skin of the testes: and with this extend the white foreskin upwards, with your left hand: and lift up the egg with the foreskin to the part of the incision: and command the minister to extend the egg upwards: and you solve the adhesion which is behind the complete solution.
And seek with your fingers so that there be nothing of the intestine wrapped in the hard white foreskin.
But if you find something from it, then push it back to the belly below.
Then take a needle in which is a thick thread, made of ten threads: and insert it at the last foreskin, that is, of the tunica, which is under the skin of the testes which follows the incision; then cut off the ends which project from the thread until there are four threads.
Then tie some of them over the other with a figure which is in the form of a cross; and ligature with them that foreskin from which we said, because it is under the skin of the testis with a strong ligament, so that no one can send anything to them from the vessels which feed them: so that an aposteme does not happen from there.
And put again a second ligament outside of the first ligament, far from it by less than two fingers.
And after these two ligaments let go from the testicles, a quantity of magnitude of a finger, and cut off all that remains according to the roundness, and take out an egg from it.
Then dry up in the lower part of the skin of the testicles, from which blood and pus flow, as we narrated in what was mentioned before.
Then apply wool soaking in oil, and place it on the wound, and apply the ligature which we narrated.
And sometimes the white vein that we mentioned is cauterized after cutting it because of the flow of blood.
It has indeed happened many times before.
And leave the ligature until it falls off by itself.
But if its falling is delayed, then warm water should be poured over it and placed on top of the vein until it falls.
Then treat the wound with the rest of the treatment of wounds, until it heals.
Of a bleeding ram's tail.Taurorum autem testiculis uentosis in quo libido est, scilicit auenere: et cum illa interueniunt et concipiunt.
The heads of chapter LXVI
I have not seen anyone dare to use a knife on this ram's tail, for fear of its bleeding.
And the first ones said that it happens just as we narrated about the ram with the grapevine.Et quicunque testiculum eius inciderit, si non aueret super eum uino: et embibere eum uino rubro, ut diximus.
Which is, so as to bind the vessels below after cutting it with ease: then cut in the middle and cure it at last with that which opens it up, until the vessels fall; and cure the wound according to what was mentioned, until it heals.
Of a disruption which happens in the groin.Et si interueniunt et concipiunt: si tamen non concipiunt et multum tardatur, et non casuit per se, sed tamen interueniunt, scilicet uti illo quod est cum Vite.
Chapter 67.
When a rupture occurs in the groin as we have said and a protrusion emerges without any of the intestines descending to the testicles, and if anything does descend it is slight and goes back again in every hour: yet if it persists for any length of time, a fissure will be added to the scrotum until the intestines descend into the scrotum.
And this happens through the stretching of the scrotum which is in the groin as we have said.
This is because the scrotum stretches and then becomes soft and swollen and protrudes.Et postea periculum accidit: nam si non curatur, et non ponitur in loco, moribundus peribit, sicut diximus.
And later the danger arises for if it is not treated and brought back to its place, death will follow as we have said. And its treatment is by cautery just as was described in the preceding narrative.Et si non possit ponere in loco, et postea peribit, et debuerit amputari sicut diximus: uerum cum cauterio potest curari, quia non peribit.
And if it cannot be brought back to its place and later will perish and ought to be amputated as we have said: yet with cautery it can be cured for it will not perish. And sometimes it is treated by iron in this way, the sick man lying on his back between your hands.Et tu tenens ferrum super focum usque dum videas ruborem in carnibus.
Then dry the place of rupture and protuberance by cutting across its width according to the quantity of three fingers.
Then compress the wound and what is under the skin until when it is revealed a white vein which follows it.
Then take a cauterization tool and place it upon the prominent place of the wound and press it to the depths of the abdomen.
Then sew two prominent places above the end of the tool through the wound and attach one to the other; then extract the end of the tool.
And do not cut the wound at all, nor stretch it, or anything else, as I have made you know in the cure of intestinal hernia. Then heal that healing of wounds.
When therefore you cut the thread, cleanse it and restore the wound, until it is healed.
The sac is thus pressed in, and no protuberance of rupture is added.
And cauterization is better in this place because it is nearer to safety.
¶ Of the softening of the skin of the testicles.
Chapter 18.
Many times the skin of the testicles is softened in some men, because of which the flesh that is between them softens and its appearance becomes foul.Pueris autem non accidit haec mollificatio; sed et si contingat, non debet molestari medicus; quoniam secessio illius carnis ad modum maturi pomi accidere solet, et non debet egestas illius cutis, nisi forte in aliam partem corporis.
Therefore it is necessary for him who is asked to cure this disease, that he should cause the invalid to lie on his back, and cut away all the skin which has become softened over the natural skin. Then he should bring together the two lips with a stitch : and if you will, cut away in the first place the superfluity of the softened skin with three stitches, or four, and make a firm stitch.
Then cure the curing of the other wounds until they are healed and the threads fall off.
¶ Of Castration.De castratione masculinorum.
Chapter 69.Of the castration of males.De castratione feminarum.
Know that castration is forbidden by our law; and because of this I might not remind you of it in this book of mine; and a reminder of it is not necessary except for two reasons.De castratione masculinorum.
Of these one is that the physician may know how to cure it when he is asked about it; and that he who has suffered it may know its cure.De castratione feminarum.
And the other mode is that we often need to castrate certain animals for our pleasures because of it, as rams, he-goats, and tomcats, and similar animals.De castratione masculinorum.Et tamen ut scis, non potest castrari nisi vir ille qui castratur: quia cum ea facit, facit in sua sustentationem.
And yet as you know, it cannot be castrated except by the man who castrates; for when he does it, he does it to his own maintenance.I say therefore that Castration is done according to two modes.De castratione feminarum.Secundum primum modum facit medicus cum uirilis inter se iungitur: et uterque est in uno lecho ad cubitum. According to the first mode it is done by a man who lies with another man; and both are in one bed, to their arms' length.Or by friction.Secundum alium modum facit cum femina inter se iungitur: et est cum ea in uno lecho ad cubitum.
According to another mode it is done when a man lies with a woman; and he is with her in one bed, to his arms' length.Or by fissure and section.Secundum primum modum facit cum femina inter se iungitur: et est cum ea in uno lecho ad cubitum.
In that which is done by friction the manner of operation is: we make the animal sit in hot water until his testicles become soft and lax, and hang down; then rub them with your hand till they come away, and are not felt under the touch.De castratione feminarum.Secundum alium modum facit cum femina inter se iungitur: et est cum ea in uno lecho ad cubitum.
When making a castration through an incision and division, you must hold the animal down and press the skin of its testes with your left hand.
And this mode of castration is better than that which is done by attrition: for possibly some of the testes are left behind by attrition, on account of which the animal misses out on coition.
Then heal the wound until it gets well.
¶ On the cure of Hermaphrodites in two ways.
Chapter 70.
There are two kinds of hermaphrodites from men.The first kind is when there is a man who has the parts of a woman, and they have women’s desires; for example, they do not desire women but instead desire men.
Their nature is female, for there appears on them what follows the space or in the skin of their testes, in that which is between the two testes, a figure like a woman’s vulva in which there are hairs; and sometimes urine flows from that which is in the skin of the testes.And this kind can have intercourse with men, and sometimes they have children.
But there is one type in women; and it is a woman’s vulva above the pubic bone just like a man’s small testes, protruding outwards: one of which is like a man’s penis, and two like two testes.And these have no intercourse with men but can only be penetrated.
And the cure of the three kinds, two from men and one kind from women, is as follows; for you must cut the added flesh until their imprint escapes.Et postea, quando incisionem feceris, oportet ut fricatis cum choro plerumque, donec sanguis cohaereat: et tunc oportet ut facias unctionem ungue olei oliviae.
Then treat those wounds with the cure for the rest of the wounds.
As for the second kind of men's wound, from which urine exits and which is in the skin of the testes, there is no operation for it, nor is there a cure at all.
On the cutting of the tentigines and prominent flesh on women's wounds:
Chapter 61.
The tentige perhaps is added on top of the natural part, until it becomes foul and its appearance ugly; and in some women it sometimes grows so much that it extends just as in men, and it comes to sexual intercourse.
So you should hold the superfluity of the tentige with your hand or with an hook, and cut it; especially not deeply at the root, so that no blood flow happens.
Then treat it with the cure for wounds until it is healed.
But the flesh that arises is flesh which is born in the opening of the womb, until it fills it; and perhaps it exits to the outside according to the similarity of a tail; and because of this some call the disease 'tailed'.
So you must cut it as we cut the tentige, and treat it until it is healed.
On the cure of the  alra , which is the wound of a woman not broken through.
Chapter 62.
The  alra  is that the wound of a woman is not broken through, or there is a small hole.Oportet ergo ut cure mus eam cum olibra uirginis uel cum melle: et si non curatur cum his, oleo uel aqua salina calida.
So you must treat it with olive oil of virgin or honey; and if it is not treated with these, with hot salt water. And it is either natural or accidental.Si ergo naturalis est, debet curari per diu: sed si accidentalis est, curatur et cito, et uelocius quod in multas diuisio.
Accidentalis is from the previous disease: and indeed it is caused by an added born flesh, or a subtle ulcer, or a thick one; and it occurs either in the depth of the womb, or in its sides, or in its upper part, or its lower part; and it prevents coitus and impregnation, and childbirth, and perhaps it prevents menstruation.
And the knowledge of that is done by the Obstetrician's examination, if the swelling is an obvious proximity.
If however it is not apparent, then seek it with your fingers, or with a rod.
But if the swelling is from a subtle ulcer, and is close to both lips: then be quick, and split it.Quod si non possit disrumpi nisi magna vi, tune scandeat in eo sanguinem: et quaerito ubi est opilatio.
And there is a way to put on both lips some powder.Et postea faciat coitum cum muliere: et postea intra se, et in opilatio, et in sanguinem, et in omnia quaerendo finem perfindit.
Then put the fingers of both your hands together, and the woman is on her back with her legs spread out.And then he penetrates himself into the swelling, and in the blood, and in everything he seeks an end.Then put your index finger in the vagina until it reaches the uterine cervix.
Then extend both lips with strength, until the subtle ulcer is split, and the swelling is opened.Postea intra te in uterum, et perfindit omnia, donec finem faciat cum sanguine.
Then enter into the womb, and investigate everything until he finishes with blood. Then take wool, and moisten it in oil, and put it on the place; and let the woman have sexual intercourse every day, so that the place does not harden with another's semen.Et postea faciat eam ut coeat cum omni viro: et si non possit concipere, postea quaeratur uterum eius usque ad finem.
If, however, the ulcer is thick, dense: then it is necessary to cut it with a broad spatula similar to the leaf of myrtle.Et si opilatio est in medio, et non est apparens propinqua: tunc quaeratur per spatumiliam largam.
If the swelling is in the middle, and not apparent nearby: then it is sought with a broad spatula. But if the swelling is from born flesh, then hang it up with hooks, and cut into it; and have with you medicines that stop blood flow without biting, such as myrrh, and dragon's blood, and pitch aggregated with egg white.
Then administer a large lead pipe so that the wound does not heal quickly, hold it for several days; then administer linseed oil, then cure the rest with the usual cure until it is healed.
And sometimes a birth of flesh occurs in the matrix: therefore it is necessary that they be cut according to this way, because if there is not an ulcerated tumor in the matrix, there will not be any contrary action with iron at all.
¶ About the cure of hemorrhoids, Athehelil and Bothor red in warts on women.
Chapter LXXIII.
Hemorrhoids are indeed an opening of the veins, until a lot of blood runs out of them constantly.Et in his quoque debet curari apoplexia cum oleo lini, et aqua calida, et ter galangae, et terra sigillata, et mercurio, et aqua vie, et sanguine cociuntur, et applicatur pulvis ad uulnera, et oleo lini.
When therefore hemorrhoids are dried up, they become thetils; and I have already spoken of their kinds and signs in the division, and I will say here what remedies they receive, and which not.Quod si mulier apoplexia subeant post partum et post aliam apoplexiam, debet curari cum uino rubro, et oleo lini, et ter galangae, et terra sigillata, et mercurio, et aqua vie, et sanguine cociuntur: et applicatur pulvis ad uulnera, et oleo lini.
I therefore say that if a woman suffers from apoplexy after childbirth and after another apoplexy, she must be treated with red wine, linseed oil, a third part of galangal, sealed earth, mercury, water of life, blood: they are cooked together; and the powder is applied to the wounds, and linseed oil.I therefore say that if hemorrhoids are in the orifice of the matrix, and do not appear to sense: then there is no cure for it with iron.Quod si uero apparet sensui, et est externum, et non est apostema cancerosum, debet curari cum ferro.
Those of these which are found in the opening above which are those which have fallen below and are treated by means of the sense of smell.
The woman must be put into a cold house.
Then the athelil should be extended with tweezers or with a rough cloth and they should be removed from their roots.
Then powder them at the place of blood flow from a cut without biting: like acacia, dragon's blood, and resin, and similar to them.
Then press her feet against the wall for an hour.
Then put her into cold water.
If the blood flow persisted, then let her sit in a decoction of sumac, and bark of pomegranates, and eggs, and similar things.
Then take barley flour, and mix it with honey and vinegar, and make an ointment with it on her back.
If the blood is cut off with it, it is good; and if not, let the wound adhere to her back and breasts, without scarring.
Then take wool and immerse it in tarath juice, or arugula juice, or in the juice of aleuage leaves, that is, aglanter wine, and let it adhere to the wound.
When then the ulcer subsides, then treat the place with ointment until it is healed.Ista medicina adhaerens curat omnem fluxum sanguinis qui ex utero et matrice profluit.
Albarth however is red like the heads of ahaase and is rough in appearance.
It must be cut therefore what appears from it, according to what I said in thelil evenly; and treat it until it is healed.
On perforations of the uterus which happen.
Chapter 74.
Many kinds of ulcers happen in the uterus, like cancer, and stone ulcer, and ulcers, and scabies, and herpes, and cold sores, and fistulas, and piles, and ragadia, and thelils, and hot ulcer.¶ De exitura perimenee et peritonee.
And I have indeed already said all these illnesses and their species, and their signs, and their cures in the previous section: it is necessary that I say in this treatise about a hot apostema which happens in the womb, when it is from the apostemas which collect pus, and you shall know how its opening is made with iron.
Therefore, you ought to consider.
Then if the pain of the apostema in its inception is acute with its percussion, and flame, and fever: and you see it turn red: if a sensation falls upon it, then do not hasten with its perforation: and treat it with that which helps over maturation, until when it calms down the acuteness of the accidents.
Then it is fitting that you make the woman sit upon a seat which has two cushions, and she recline, or lie upon her back, and bring her feet up to her abdomen's lower part: and let her buttocks be expanded, and place her arms under her knees, and tie both ligaments suitably to that.
Then the midwife shall sit on the right side, and administer the instrument with which is opened the opening of the womb.Et ego quidem iam dixi omnes has aegritudines et species earum, et signa ipsarum, et earum curationes in diuisione: necesse est ut dicam in hoc tractatu apostema calidum quod accidit in matrice, quando est ex apostematibus quae colligunt saniem, et uis scire qualiter fit eius apertio cum ferro.
And I have indeed already said all these illnesses and their species, and their signs, and their cures in the previous section: it is necessary that I say in this treatise about a hot apostema which happens in the womb, when it is from the apostemas which collect pus, and you shall know how its opening is made with iron.And its shape comes in those who are after.
And it is fitting when you wish to administer this instrument, that you insert with the iron the depth of the woman's womb: so that it not be that which enters from the instrument more than the depth of the womb, and harm the infirm one.Et oportet quando uis administrare hoc instrumentum, ut figas cum Radio profundum matricis mulieris: ut non sit illud quod ingreditur ex instrumento plus, quam profundum matricis, et laedat infirmam.
But if the instrument is more than the depth, then it is fitting to put felt upon the roof of the womb's depth: so that entry of the instrument throughout into the womb's depth is prohibited: and it is fitting to place the bandage which runs in the instrument from the upper side: and to hold the instrument, and for the assistant to twist the bandage, until the womb's depth is opened.
When therefore an Exit is perceived, and touched by hand, and is soft and smooth; then one ought to cut it off at its head with a broad spatula.
When therefore the pus is evacuated, then one ought to put onto the wound an ointment, that is immersed in rose oil; or green oil, in which there is some astringency; and put on the ointment, and extract the incision out of the womb.
And put an external plaster over the womb, and over it clean wool that is immersed in water, in which are boiled peas.
Then let it be healed after two days with ointment that is appropriate for it, until it is healed.
And when the womb and wound are washed, such that they are enema-ed with water and honey; then with water in which is boiled the root of lily, or long Aristolochia; then return to the ointment.Et sic iterum et iterum, donec curatur.
If the wound has been hidden inside the womb, then it is necessary that you be prohibited from curing it with iron, but rather cure it with what we said in the division.
The Doctrine of Obstetrics, how to treat the children when born not according to nature.De illis ergo qui nascuntur ex matrice mortuos, postea quod omnia ex uisceribus et membris eorum exuitur, omnia in uno linteo imberbuiuntur, et cum aqua calida lixuiuntur, et in eo linteo quiescentem ponitur.
Chapter 76.
The midwife must first of all know the shape of a natural childbirth.
From the signs, therefore, it is for the midwife to know that when you see a woman compressing her lower abdomen and wishing to breathe the air and feel lightheaded over her, and hasten the exit of the embryo, then you should know that this childbirth is according to the natural figure, and its exit above its head, and the afterbirth with it, or suspended, or hanging from the umbilical cord. When therefore you see these signs, then it is fitting to compress her abdomen so that the embryo may descend quickly.Et quod si super caput eius non est secundina, neque cum eo suspensa: et super eam de iusto medio omnino, tunc oportet Obstetricem ut iustum medium faciat super eam: et in medio iusto facit per viam rectam quid uoluit.
But whoever goes beyond this birth is unnatural, and praiseworthy.
For when the fetus goes out upon his feet, and his body comes out before its head, and his feet and hands together, or one of his feet; or his head and his hand come out: or he comes out head first: and perhaps he turns over on to his neck, and similar figures which are unnatural.
It is therefore necessary for the Obstetrician to be prudent and subtle in all these things, and beware of error and deception: and I shall show every figure out of them, and how the nature of it is, and what it signifies by it, and he shall stand over it.
When the fetus comes out upon his head by its natural egression, and it becomes hard upon the woman, and her delivery is difficult, and you see its strength is now failing: then let her sit on a chair, or women hold her: and vaporize her vulva with fennel boiled, and with moist oils.Et si cum eo secundina non descendit, sed remansit intra eam, et uides in omni quaestu partus eius defecit, et quod debuerit egredi et non est egrediens: tunc fac uaporare illum caput cum oleis uarisque, ut ego dixi.
And if with it the afterbirth does not go down but remains within her, and you see that what ought to come out is not coming out: then let her vaporize the head with oils of various kinds, as I have said before. Then the Obstetrician shall put between his fingers a small spathe of ivory, and find with it the afterbirth, and cut it with his fingernail until the moisture which is in it runs out: and press on the womb of the woman until the fetus comes down.Et si post haec ueniat ad eiectum et non possit egredi, quia uentris obstipuit, tunc intromittat Obstetricus digitos suos super collicuin eius qui est in eo, et findet eam secundinam: et postea cum oleis humidis uaporet caput eius, ut dixi.
If it does not come down, then a woman must be enema with a mucilage of fenugreek, with sesame oil.
Then tell her to strain after the enema, and make her sneeze with pepper, hold her jaw and nose for an hour.
For at once the fetus will come out.
If two hands of the fetus come out first, you must draw them back gently little by little.
If it does not yield at the entrance, then place the woman on a chair and elevate her feet upward; then strike the seat on the ground, and let the woman be held so that she will not fall when you strike.
If the hands do not come out, and the fetus dies; then cut them off, and extract the rest of the fetus; tie his hand with a cloth, and draw him out evenly; for he will come out. If however the child is born dead, then cut it up in the womb, and bring it forth piece by piece.
The delivery of a foetus feet first.
When the foetus comes out feet first, then you must press them upward; then turn the foetus little by little and bring it down evenly.
Then take one of its feet and stretch it out little by little.Quod si resistere coepit: tunc oportet ut trahat eum ad modum luctationis: et sic iterum faciat cum altero pedi.
When therefore they go out as far as the thighs, then bid him hold it in and cause her to sneeze with pepper; for it will come out, if God please.
And if that which we have described does not go out with him, then draw back the fetus little by little, until you place it according to its natural figure.
For he will then come out easily.
But if all that which we have described is prevented from going out with him, then take some mucilage of alder-tree, and oil of sesamum, and gum dissolved; and beat the whole in a mortar with a good beating; then wipe with it the woman's vulva and her womb below.
Then let her sit in warm water until she feels the pangs of childbirth.Et sic facite sicut praecepimus: et ego confido quod salteris saluberrimam partem.
And thus do as we have commanded; and I trust that she will have a safe delivery.When therefore you see that her bowels are warm, then give her a suppository of myrrh; and lay it in under him.Et postea linite uuluam eius cum oleo ricini: et fac eam intrare fornicem, et inclinare ad pedes, donec ponatur puer secundum naturam.
When you hold them for one hour then have them sit on a chair.
Then make her sneeze; and squeeze her jawbone and nose; and press the lower part of the belly with a gentle pressure.
For at once the fetus will come out.
The delivery of the fetus will take place over the knees and hands.
When it comes out in this manner, then she will gradually use her hands to turn it inside.Et ego faciam eam sedere, et inveniere si quid intra sit: et ostendam ei foeus inter crura.
Then let the woman lie on her back with her feet hanging down and lying on the bed, closing her hands.
Then gently press above her womb.
Then take what is under her feet from the armpits until she is ready at the bottom.
If the fetus does not come out, then take her feet and move them violently.
Then press what is above the womb gently until the fetus rises to the top.
Then insert his hands and straighten the fetus gradually; and command the woman to compress until the fetus comes out.
The exit of the fetus hanging broad from the hands.
Let him insert his hand into it.
But if he cannot reduce it, then lift up the woman and make her walk.Et si uelutur, praecipite ambulare ultra modum, donec ego uoluerit in utero.
If she is unable to walk, then command her to lie on the bed; and shake her thighs with a violent shaking.Et si concutio non uoluerit in utero, deinde resupinetur mulier super collum suum, et pendant pedes eius ad inferiora: et ipsa sit iacens super lectum, et complicet manos suas.
And if the shaking does not cause a contraction in the womb, then let the woman lie on her back with her feet hanging down; and let her be lying on the bed, and close her hands.Then administer the liniment which you have prepared from the mucilages.Et fricta linimento, resupinetur mulier super collum suum, et pendeant pedes eius ad inferiora: et praecipe mulieri ut concutiat crura suis manibus motu uehementi, donec uoluerit in utero.
If she has recently given birth then have her sit on a chair.
Then proceed with the dislocation of the hand and adjust the fetus according to its natural shape; make the woman sneeze and tell her to press herself until it comes out.
The exit of the fetus is above its neck, with its hands spread out, and its face is towards the back of its mother.
The midwife must hold the hand of the fetus, then gradually turn it and adjust it with ease.
When it is thus adjusted, then place over its navel what we mentioned before about oil and mucilages.
Then tell her to move gradually.
When you have done that, then have her sit on a chair and tell her to incline towards the right side.Deinde stude in reductione manus, et aequa foetum secundum figuram naturalem: et fac sternutare mulierem, et praecipe ei, ut comprimat se, donec egrediatur.
Then proceed with the dislocation of the hand and adjust the fetus according to its natural shape; make the woman sneeze and tell her to press herself until it comes out.When you have done that then tell her to press herself, and make her sneeze with the powder.
The exit of the prepared fetus is on its side.Oportet ut studeant cum oleo et mucilaginibus, et super uuluam eius quod narrauimus, et per uulvam eius quod est ad latus dextrum.
One must work with oil and mucilages, and over its navel what we mentioned before, and through the opening that is on the right side.When it goes down into the matrix according to this manner with afterbirth, then split the afterbirth with your fingernail until it is evacuated from moisture.Deinde stude ut redit ad latus sinistre per uulvam eius quod est ad latus dextrum.
Then proceed for it to return to the left side through the opening that is on the right side.If it then hangs over the face of the fetus and its neck, cut her from the umbilical area so that it is not held back and dies.Si ergo fuit infans foetus ex utero matris suae quod non potest egredi, et multum temporis fuerit egestas: et si mater eius moriatur in partu, quia non potest egredi: ponant eam super sedem bene ad uigilo, et faciant eam inclinarum ad latus sinistre.
If the infant of the fetus from its mother's womb cannot exit and a long time has passed in labor, and if his mother dies in childbirth because she cannot give birth; put her on a chair close to the bed, and make her incline towards the left side.Then push the fetus inward until you place it as it should be: and tell the woman to press herself several times; he will indeed exit with an easy exit.
The outcome of twins, or of many fetuses.
You should know that twins are often born, and sometimes three or four are born.
However, that is strange, and happens rarely.
But having five is beyond nature and they do not live at all; and even if they are multiplied, a single placenta contains them all, and they are separated by a partition that distinguishes between them, a ligament attached to the umbilical cord of each one.
And sometimes they exit as if there were only one fetus, in a natural exit, easily; and they exit by an unpraised exit, as we narrated earlier. If some of them are difficult at childbirth and reach that which we said regarding unnatural forms, then treat them as we narrated earlier: and let the midwife be subtle, and do what she does with ease and slowness, and adapt according to any form with that which is prepared for her by the guidance of experience towards health.
Sometimes one is formed in the womb, and two, and three, and four, and five, and six, and seven, and more than ten: and indeed I have verified that a woman who had an abortion gave birth to seven, and another gave birth to fifteen, all formed.Et quilibet abortebat cum suo secundum naturam, et placentalis eorum omnes in uno exitu: sed non omnes supraviuent: uideoque plerunque mortalem esse partus.
What was made in the measurement of the glorious wise man.
This therefore should all be in the knowledge of obstetrics. Perhaps indeed it will come to resemble that one: so he should oppose with it what is required.
On the removal of a dead fetus.
When you are treating a dead fetus with the medicine I mentioned in the examination and it does not come out, and you are forced to use surgery with your hand, then you should consider the following:
If the woman is of sound constitution and does not suffer from any of the conditions that make her life at risk, then she should be laid on her bed, on her back, with her head inclined downward and her legs elevated, and a midwife should hold her from two sides or be tied to the bed so that her body does not move during the extraction of the fetus.
Then lubricate the cervix with moist oils with mucilage of aloe and fenugreek and linseed.Quod si uelletur ut non resupinetur, sed sedebit, tunc oportet quod faciat sibi quasi ad partum, et tenatur per eam ministeriam a duobus medicis aut per duos ministers, et ligatur sicut dixi. Then the midwife should anoint her hand with these oils and mucilages; then she should insert it into the womb easily.
Then she should look for with her the place where to fix the hooks on the fetus and convenient places for that.
Consider therefore then , if the fetus is prepared to go down over its head : then fix the hooks in his eyes , or on his neck , or in his mouth , or on his palate , or under his beard , or in his collarbone , or in places close to the ribs, and under the hypochondrium .
But if it is descending over its feet , then on the breastbone  , and the middle of his ribs .
And you must hold the hook with your right hand and place its curve in what is between the fingers of her left hand  and insert it with her hand easily, and fix the hook into one of those places we mentioned until she reaches the empty thing.
Then it is pulled with an equal extension and not according to the straightness only, rather it is moved to every part, so that its outlet is alleviated; just as it happens with a tooth in its extraction.
And it is necessary to soften the extension in what is between them.
If a part of it is retained, then the Obstetrix must grease some fingers with oil and introduce them from one side to unwind what is retained by turning them about.
If a part of the fetus comes out, then the hooks are shifted to a higher place: do this until the whole fetus goes out.
If therefore a hand comes out before the others, and it is not possible to bring it back on account of its constriction: then it is necessary that a cloth be wrapped over it.Et tenent eum Obstetrices quibusdam digitibus, et traxint eam ad partem altiorem, donec possit egredi; nam si inuertatur super eam pannus, neque tamen traxerit eam ad locum altiorem, sed retinetur: tunc oportet, ut incidiatur quod est retensum.
And let the Obstetrices hold it with some fingers and pull it up to a higher part, until it can go out; for if a cloth is wrapped over it, and yet it does not draw it up to a higher place but is retained: then it is necessary that what is retained be cut.Then pull it out until the whole goes out; cut it either at the junction of the palm, or in the elbow; and so you must do with the other hand, and with both feet.
But if the head of the fetus is large, or it suffers constriction on going out, or there has gathered water in its head; then you must introduce between the fingers a spiny Spatumile and open with it the head, and draw out the water; or burst it with an instrument called Almisdac: whose form comes with the forms of other instruments in the chapter which follows next.
Similarly if the fetus has a large head by nature, then it is necessary to open it with a saw; or pull it out with the misdach, as we have said.Et si accidit ut retineatur in parte qua libet: et quilibet digitum loquendo ostendat quod inter digitos eius est quod retinetur: tunc oportet ut incidiatur locus qui est super illo, ita donec possit egredi.
Then you pull out the bones with a pair of forceps.
If the head emerges and is squeezed between the forceps, then it is pulled out until the moisture that is in the chest has been discharged.
But if it does not yield, or is resistant to coming out, then cut into the head little by little, as much as you can.
If there is an ulcer below the chest, or a dropsy, then you must pierce it so that the moisture runs out of it.Si autem uentris est ruptus: non debes perferre caput, nisi antea perfors uentris.
If the fetus is upside down, then its extraction is easy and its passage through the birth canal is easy.Quod si autem in capite habet uentrem: non debes perferre caput, nisi antea perfors uentrem.
But if it is squeezed at the chest or abdomen, then you must pull it out with a cloth that you have wrapped around your hand and open up the chest or abdomen until what is inside them has run out.
If however the other limbs are removed and the head returns, then the obstetrician must insert his left hand If the birth canal is open, then he must insert his hand deep into the birth canal and search for the head with it, and pull it out with his fingers up to the opening of the birth canal; then he should put one hook or two hooks into it, and pull it out with them.Si autem caput est obstratum: et non potest perferri per os matricis, nisi antea caput est fractum: tunc findat illud cum manu, donec currat sanguis ex ea.
But if the head is blocked and cannot pass through the birth canal unless the head is broken beforehand, then he should open it with his hand until the blood runs out from it.If the birth canal is constricted because of a hot ulcer that has developed in it, then one must not exert effort on it; rather, one should then administer the effusion of fatty liquids and apply plasters, and she should sit in bath waters that soften and moisten.
If the fetus is lying on its side, then it is possible for it to come out even; then what we said about the single fetus should be administered.Quod si uero foetus est super dorsum suum, et supinus: cum eo non debet laborari, nisi antea eum surdino caput in os matricis.
If this is not possible then it should be cut through and extracted.
And you must leave nothing of the afterbirth inside at all.
When therefore you have finished your operation, then administer what we said about hot poultices for ulcers that happen in the womb.
If there is bleeding, then let him go into waters which are astringent and administer the other treatment.
And indeed I have seen a woman in whose womb a dead fetus was; afterwards she became pregnant again by the same man, then another fetus died also.
It happened to her therefore after a long time she had an ulcer in her navel, and it became swollen until it opened; and it began to discharge pus.
I was called to her cure, and I treated her for a long time; yet the wound would not heal.Et quod diximus mihi accidit: nam ego curavi eam per diem octo, post quaedam stiptica imposita: sed non potui deire uulnum.
And what I said to me happened: for I treated her for eight days, after which certain astringents were laid on; but I could not close the wound.I therefore placed over it some strong吸引plasters: and it came out of its place like an ulcer.
Then after she had gone for several days, another ulcer came out.Et quia multum displiciebat ei uulnus, vocauit medicum qui curat apud regem.
I was astonished at this because there is no bone in the belly.
I therefore supposed that it was because the bones of the dead fetus were inside.
I therefore examined the wound and took out many bones while the woman was in a better state; and she lived in this way for a long time, and the pus ceased to flow from her.
And I am not astonished at this being strange, unless because there is knowledge of it and help to it from the expert doctor with his hand out of curing.
Of the forms of necessary instruments for extraction of the fetus.
Chapter 77.
Here below is the form of the press, with which are equalized books, to which are equally two cords at the two ends of the two pieces of wood.
However, this whirlpool ought to be more subtle than the press; and that it may be so, let it be made either of ivory or boxwood.Et habet quadrigemini ad mensuram partem.
And it has two wings to the measure of a part.And let the breadth of each piece of wood be almost two fingers; and the edge of both is almost one finger, and its length is a palm and a half; and in the midst of the two pieces of wood are two additions made of the same kind of wood, which are already attached to both, whose length is a palm and a half: and the breadth of each is almost two fingers, or less.Et haec additamenta sunt firmae in medio lignorum per resinas ad mensuram parteas trium in quolibet additamento, sed prope extremitatem unius additamenti, et ad mensuram parteis trium in altero additamento, ut quaeque additamenta sint firmae ad mensuram parteas sex.
And these two additions are inserted into the mouth of the mother, so that they may be opened with them when you revolve the two Vertigines.
Form of the Vertigine with which the mother is opened.
Another form to that similar, more subtle and lighter.
Let it be made of ebony or boxwood, in the likeness of forceps.
However, at its end there shall be two additions, as you see above; and the length of every addition from them is almost a palm, and the breadth of each two fingers.
When therefore you wish to open the mother with it, then let the woman sit on a bed, her feet hanging down, and open that which is between her thighs.
Then insert these two joined additions into the mother; and you are holding the lower end of the instrument between her thighs.Et cum aperueris matricem, resubde illum super extremitatem vertiginis ut sit sub illa, et tenens manibus ut non recedat a loco suo, nisi quod resubderet eam, sicut uides in figura.
Then open your hand with the instrument as you do with tweezers, equally according to the amount that you see from the opening of the mother's mouth, until the midwife does what she wants.
The shape of another vertigo which they say the ancients called the Shape of the Impeller that pushes the fetus.
The shape of an almيرة, with which is crushed the small head. The form of a clamp having one spine.
The form of a clamp having two spines.
The shape of forceps that have teeth like the teeth of a saw, with which to crush the head of the fetus.
The form of a spatula having two ends for cutting off the head.
The shape of two spatulas, also wide.
All these instruments are exercised, and the more they multiply their kinds, and are prepared by the artist, the more they are ready for their operation, and the higher they are in men, because of their quantity.Quod si esset una quaeque forma ad singula uaria, et non posset in multitudine confici, neque arte artificis, neque experientia, tantum uarietur instrumentorum qualitas, et tantum uelociter operaretur, ut paulo ante demonstravimus.
You will not therefore despise any of these instruments, but let it be prepared by you.
For the need for them is inexcusable.Et quae sunt munitus ad illaesionem et mortificationem, ut sunt almisac, vertiginum, vncinorum, spatularum, et omnium eorumsimilarum instrumentorum.
¶ On the extraction of the afterbirth.Hic autem uersus in illaesionem mortificationemque habet omnem modum, et totum exercitum ad mortificando et trahendam secundinam, quae ad mortem foetus est necessaria.
Chapter LXXVIII.De extractione secundinae post mortem foetus per almisacem et vertigines.
When the afterbirth is retained at childbirth, then you should command the midwife to retain her breath.Et quod non possit uelociter extrahere secundinam, et non sit illaesiva, quia mortem foetus praesupposita est, quae in eorum partibus est, sed extrahitur per vertigines almisacisque mortificantes, quae faciunt ut mortis imbecillitas crescit.
Then make her sneeze with smelling-salts: and press your hand over her mouth and her nostrils.
If it then comes out through this, it is good.
If not: then take a pot and pierce a hole in the lid: and put into it herbs which open up the mouth of the womb, such as calamintha, rue, and aniseed, and camomile, and sesame, and cassia wood, and centaury. Take all these herbs, or some of them, and steep them in water, and place them over a fire.
Then put an arundo reed over the hole in the lid of the pot, and the other end into the mouth of the womb: and hold it there until the vapor reaches to the hollow of the womb.
Then make her sneeze as we have said above.
The second will then come out with ease.
But if it should remain after this treatment, and not come out: then direct the obstetrician to dip his hand into olive oil or a high lye. Then he should insert his hand into the vulva, and seek for the secundine.
When he has found it, then take hold of it and stretch it out gradually.
But if it were attached deep within the womb, then insert his hand as we have described above until he finds the secundine and draws it out gradually with care, that the womb may not fall away through violent stretching: instead it should be turned gently to the right and left side alternately, and then there will be more stretching.
For it is then obstinate and stuck fast, and comes away from its adhesive state.
If the mouth of the womb is contracted, as we have now described: treat it with sneezing and with the pot of herbs.Si uero matrix non coarteratur, sed ob tegangem, quae est super os matricis: et si haec obstet ratione secundinae, faciat eam intrare, qui ostetricem habet, et teneat manum suam super os matricis, et nares ipsius.
If, however, it does not come out with everything that we have described, then beware of tiring yourself in repeated attempts to extract it.
You must tie what comes out to the lip of the womb to the hip of the woman.
Then cleanse her with a clyster made of four-fold medicine.
For it will rot and dissolve and come out after a few days.
However when it rots an evil odor rises from the womb to the stomach and head and injures the weak woman.
Therefore suitable fumigants must be applied.Quod si non faciunt, morbus in multum tempus dimanebit.
But if they do not, the disease will persist for a long time.Some of the ancient doctors have already tried the fumigation of nasturtium and dried figs.Et alii quoque ex lacte caprae et theriaca et myrrha et oleo et vinagre ficorum siccarum.
And others also of goat's milk and theriac and myrrh and oil and vinegar with dried figs.The shape of the instrument used to fumigate a woman when suffering from retention or menstral flow.
Let it be made of bronze or brass, and let its broad end be placed over the fire, and put the fumigation on coals: hold her thus until that fumigation is consumed; then repeat with another.Et postea teneatur eam cum unguento tetrapharmacon: et ligatur ad os uterinus: et ponatur super eum ovis imbuta oleo et vinagre, et super eam linteus inponatur: et ita dimittiatur.
And afterwards let her be held with the four-fold ointment; and let it be bound to the womb's mouth; and let a sponge soaked in oil and vinegar be placed on it, and a linen cloth laid over it: thus let her go.¶ Of the cure of a non-perforated Anus.Si autem anus non egreditur cum omnibus quibus antea diximus, tunc oportet ut liges eam ad coxam et teneas cum unguento tetrapharmacon, donec egreditur: sed postea, cum egreditur cum multitudine, aut cum male olent, si fatigaveris, resilias.
But if the anus does not come out with all that we have before described, then you must tie it to the hip and hold it with the four-fold ointment until it comes out: but afterwards when it comes out with abundance or with evil-smelling matter, if you are tired, give up.Chapter LXXIX.
Many children are born whose anuses are not perforated, and which the subtle pus has already hardened.Hic oportet ut liges eam ad coxam, et teneas cum unguento tetrapharmacon, donec egreditur: sed postea cum egreditur cum multitudine mali odoris, et fatigaveris in iteratione extractionis, resilias, ne morbus demum per se consumatur.
The midwife should therefore pierce it with her finger; and if she cannot, then she should pierce it with a sharp spatula, taking care not to touch the membrane.
Then place over it wool soaked in wine and oil.
Then treat it with ointment until it heals.
If you are afraid that it will become blocked, then insert a lead tube into the hole for many days, and remove it when the baby wants to move.
And indeed clogging of Ani has already happened from the hardening of a wound, or an abscess.
Therefore it is necessary to cut away that hardening, then treat it with what we have already said about treatment and lead.Et si fiant plures apices, oportet ut secatur in his locis omnia consolidatio, ne opilat urina: nam haec est causa opilatis Ani. And if there are many tips, it is necessary to cut away all the hardening in those places, so that urine does not clog; for this is the cause of clogs in Ani.
Chapter 80.Of the treatment of Fistulaes which occur in the lower parts.
Fistulaes which occur in the lower parts are硬化，and swelling which occur near the anus of women; or in the space of one side: and there is one fistula, or more.Et sunt quae habent intra se materia: et quae non habent intra se materialem.
And when that hardening becomes old, it is opened, and runs out of it watery whiteness, or thin pus.Et quando currit humores quilibet omnium, et non currit, cum aperitur illa Nodatio, illo tempore debet curari cum ungüento de oleo et de cera lini: sed postea non debet curari nisi cum oleo.
And when out of any of them the humor runs, and does not stop running, when that hardening is opened, at that time it ought to be treated with ointment of oil and linseed, but afterwards it should not be treated except with oil.And sometimes there are from these fistulaes, piercing ones.
And there are some fistulas which penetrate into the ureter and into the urethra.
And there are some which penetrate to the hip joint and to the tail joint.
By which you may know whether the fistula penetrates to the anus or not, let it be that you put your index finger into the anus and let him insert a very fine probe into the fistula when there is no crookedness.
If there is a crookedness in it, then insert into it a very fine probe of lead, or a hair-pin made of horsehair until you feel the probe or the pin on your finger.
If you do not feel it at all, nor anything come out of the opening from evacuation, nor any windiness, nor a worm as I said, then know that it is not penetrating; therefore go to the cure.
And when the fistula penetrates to the ureter or to the urethra, then its indication is an exit of urine from it and prevention from that is with medicine so that the place may be consolidated.Et si ad meatum urinae penetrat, scias quod ex eo est exitus urinae: et quando ad uesicam penetrat, scias quod est ex ea uentositas et exitus sanguinis.
If it penetrates to the hip joint or to the bone of the hip, then its sign is that the probe may reach there if there is no crookedness until to the bone; and the finding of pain in going around the part, and that pus always comes out from it, and medicine does not take effect on it, nor does it become consolidated with ointment.
And for all these penetrating fistulas there is no cure at all; and their cure is toil and nothingness because of foolish physicians upon whom the fistula forms.Et quando Fistula non penetrat usque ad os aut ad uesicam: et est in eius tortuositas, scias quod est incurable cum medicina: sed curabile est per machinam. And when the fistula does not penetrate to the bone or to the ureter, and there is no crookedness in it, you may hope for a cure with the knife according to what I narrate to you and I have already tried; and it is that the invalid lie between your hands on his back and lift his legs up until above his hips, and let his hips be inclined toward his navel.
Then introduce a probe of lead or brass if there is a curve in the fistula, until you can feel where it comes out.
If however he feels it near his anus, then you should put in your index finger up the anus.
If you then feel with your finger that the probe has indeed gone through the hole discovered, beyond what you felt between your finger and the fistula or the flesh, then you are certain that it has broken through: therefore do not worry about it, since there is no hope of a cure for it as we have said.
Yet they have said that in some men the flesh is cured and by a medicine which he hopes for a cure, it is necessary to apply a subtle cautery according to the width of the fistula as was mentioned before, and to introduce the hot cautery into the fistula until it comes out around the anus.
Then repeat this twice or three times until you know that all the added flesh which is like the feather of a bird has been burnt away.Et si postea sentierit dolorem in Fistula, et visum sit, quod non peruenit intra se tentum, sed viduerit eam ad se reverti: debet iterare idem remedium tertio, vel quarto die, sicut praecessit.
Then treat it with linen bandages soaked in butter until the burnt flesh comes away; then treat it with ointments which generate flesh and consolidate.
If then it is healed, it is good.
And if not, then it will never be healed with any other treatment.
And if the thread comes out, and does not reach up to your finger which is in the anus, and is between it and the thread a thick membrane of flesh, or mucous membrane: and you can see the Fistula following the surface of the skin, then dry up the skin from the beginning of the Fistula, and you go drying up with the thread that is in the fistula, until the incision reaches where the end of the thread reaches, and the thread is released and falls out.
Then cleanse those filtered flesh which are like a bird's feather pipe, so that nothing remains in them.Quamvis tamen ista cura paratur pro Fistula, qui habet illam et est per se sanus: sed si per aliam causam fiat, non debet curari per hanc curationem.
However, although this treatment is prepared for Fistula, whoever has it and is healthy in himself: but if it happens because of another cause, it should not be treated with this treatment.But if blood overpowers you, and dissolves between you and the operation itself as you cut away those flesh, then it is better and more speedy to cauterize it with fire, or with an acute medicine.Et si in illa parte, ubi habet tentam, est alicuius corporis tumor, et si secaris tentatio, quae est in fistula, et non potest intraverti tentum per eam: tunc scio te mihi debere tentum per eam iterum introfieri, donec perueniat ad extremitatem tentationis.
Since cautery with fire brings about good results, the burning of these meats, and the stopping of blood, and the drying up of moisture, let us now speak of the other cauteries.
Then dress the wound with soft linen bandages soaked in butter, or crushed cabbages, until the wound discharges pus and the burnt flesh comes away.
Then dress the wound with ointments that bring about firm flesh; and there are remedies in which there is a drying up of moisture.
For when they are healed, then they are cured: and you need not fear repetition.Quomodo enim per se resecuntur carnes adusta, ita quoque per se consolidantur. For as the burnt flesh is cut away by itself, so also is it healed by itself.If however the Fistula has now pierced right through to the depths of the anus, and is prolonged by a protuberance from the body: then insert your finger into the anus, and feel about with it.Si igitur ad ustione carnes emittunt pus, et non est ulla sperantio, ut desistanter eorum, non perdes illos homines.
If therefore you feel a pulsation and there is a membrane between you and her, made of skin or flesh, and it is near penetration: then there must be no operation on it except according to the way of trust and hope.
This is because one of three things must be done to it: either you cauterize it as we have said, or cut into it until you reach its hollow, so that you can insert a probe and effect a cure from close by.
And do not go far with the cutting, so that you do not cut the membrane containing the anus and bring about an exit of waste without willing it. Then treat this with what we have said. Perchance indeed it will heal; or you may lengthen that membrane and clean it after you have dried it up close to the anus as we said, either with a tent or with another sharp instrument.
Then cleanse the filtered meats that are in the cut, until you can reach them with a probe.
Then try to restore the wound of the whole with a cut and an upper orifice where it is consolidated; and there will remain an open fistula in the inner part of the anus, and it will be lighter on the sick person.
And sometimes a fistula follows this way; and it is when you insert a tent into the fistula, and there is on the side of the anus around the surface of the body with skin and margin of the anus: then take a tent with a punctured end which is like a needle for piercing leather, according to this form.
And insert into it an unwoven thread of five strands and around it.
Then insert the tent with a thread into the fistula until you reach its hollow.
If therefore it penetrates in the margin of the anus inwardly near it, then pull out the thread from that foramen; so that you insert your finger into the anus and pull out the end of the thread, and tie both ends together: and as much as the thread pierces the flesh, tie it well, until the meats between the two ends of the thread are cut through and fall: then heal the wound, until it is consolidated and healed.
For it does not behoove you, because of a wart, to cut into it.
Then deal with it as we have said, until it is healed.
The shape of the spatulous knife with which a fistula is cut, whose curve is very acute, and the other part is not acute, so that you do not cut what is not necessary, as you see.
Of the stitching of hemorrhoids, from which blood flows from their incision, and of the cure of fissures.
CHAPTER 81.
There are two kinds of hemorrhoids.
Or they are within the anus, like pieces of charcoal or plums; or they are like grains of grapes themselves.
And there are small and large ones; blood always flows from them, and there is one, and there are many.
And they are outside the anus and at its ends.
However, those which are outside the anus are for the most part few in moisture, from which flows a watery yellow fluid or a little blood with constant flow; and they are in color like the body.
And its cure, which is within the anus, is to order a fart to be made; and it is pressed out, until the anus emerges and they appear to you.
Therefore also suspend them with hooks or hold them with your nail.
Then cut them at their roots.
But if they do not hold hooks because of their moisture and softness; then seize them with a rough cloth or with a pad of double lamb's wool and draw them out with your fingers.
Then cut them and sprinkle some hot powders over them after the incision so that they may remain in place as a cautery.
Or cauterize them according to what precedes in the chapter on cauterization.
Then treat them with the remaining remedies until they are cured.
If the anus does not yield to being cleaned out, then treat the invalid with a gentle enema so that he is eased by it and what is inside the anus comes out quickly when the invalid exerts himself.
But if there are warts outside the anus, then they are slight and easy to deal with: and you must seize them with your nail or catch them with a hook and cut them off.Si verruitio est intrinseca ad ano, res eorum est difficile et periculosa: quia si facit incisionem ut inciderit in verrues intrinsecas, multum sanguinis effuit, et mortalis est.
If it is an internal wart close to the anus, then it is difficult and dangerous: because if he makes a cut in order to reach the internal warts, much blood flows and it is deadly. Then treat them with what we have said until they are cured.Si lues est intrinseca ad ano, res eorum est periculosa et difficile, quia non potest facere nisi incidas intra verrues et extrahas quod in eis omnino non debet fieri: et mortalis res est.
If it is a wart close inside the anus, then it is dangerous and difficult, because you cannot do anything but cut into the warts and extract what is in them at all: and it is a deadly thing. And whoever shuns cutting with iron, then one must apply their ointment according to this method.Et postea cura eos secundum hunc modum usquequaque donec sanentur.
And afterwards treat them according to this method until they are cured. Take a thread and wrap it around the needle.Postea res utrimque tenens adduxit eum usque ad centrum verruim: et non debet remittere manum suam de loco usquequaque donec extrahat omnia quae in intrinsecus verrues invenerit, et secundum hunc modum faciat.
Then extract the ligament toward the upper part, and make it penetrate with a needle into its root from the other side; and wind both ends of the thread in the lower part of the needle, and let them be lateral; and tighten the ligament strongly with the ligature.
Then tie the thread, and extract the needle.
Do this with all the ligaments, and leave one of them; and do not ligature it, so that the superfluous blood may flow from it.
Then place over the wound a cloth soaked in rose oil or aloes, and place it over the anus; and give orders to the sick person to keep quiet.
Then let him go until he falls down.
When therefore the ligaments have fallen off, treat them with ointments and other remedies until they are healed.
CHAPTER ON THE TREATMENT OF FISSURES.
For very often they occur from the drying up of feces and the constriction of nature.Quomodo igitur possit curari fisura?
How then can a fissure be cured? When therefore they become old and the medicine does not work on them: then it is necessary to scrape them with pieces of potsherd, or with your nail, until they become moist, and is removed from them the superficial skin which hinders their healing.Et cum fiunt humidae, oportet ut ungeris eos ungento tuo.
Then dress them, until they heal as they should.
But if they do not heal: then cut them again with a more violent razor than the first, until they bleed much and gape open; then dress them, until they are healed.
Of the curing of wounds in the arm-pit, and not in the arm-pit; and of the wounds of the testicles, and of ants.
Then treat it; and if you wish, cauterize it according to what has been said in its chapter.
Now an exathel is a small, hard protuberance, with a hollow and round above the surface of the body.
And they often occur on the hands of children.
And its treatment is to open up the exathel and cut it; or to tie it with a thread of silk; or with hair until it falls off.
And if you wish, cauterize it according to what has been said with fire or with a sharp medicine; and now the inverted exathels are eradicated, but not the inverted ones with an instrument which I have described. A wart is also a small protuberance, hollow and thick, on the surface of the body, spreading deeply; and when it meets with cold, there is felt in it a sensation like that of an ant's bite, and it spreads over the whole body: and most often it occurs on the hands.
And its treatment is to take a reed made from the feather of a goose or strong hawk's feather; and place this reed over the wart until it holds it within the circle of the reed.
Then rotate your hand with the reed until you've made a cut around the wart; and put it deep into the flesh, and you will eradicate the wart from its root. And if you wish, do this with an air reed or iron reed, in the same manner.
Let there be above the reed a small loop pulling outward, so that it may be easier to grasp and rotate over the finger.
And if you wish, cauterize the wart according to what has been said concerning the cauterization of an exathel, in its chapter on cautery.
On the forms of Instruments which are used for Enemas in diseases of the Anus and Bowel, and Colic.
CHAPTER 83.
Sometimes an Enema is made of silver or brass or cast-iron, or copper.Et quicquid fiunt de aere uano aut malleato faciuntur in forma tubae et non aliter.
And sometimes they are made small and large from these instruments, according to those in which they are administered.
Therefore that which is administered for the cure of children's wounds ought to be small; and also their enemas when their anus is weak or painful.
A large enema.
A small enema.
The tip of the enema, that is, the upper head where it is tied with a string, should be wide in this way and it should have a smooth, very smooth and finely drawn end which is inserted into the anus; and on one side there should be two holes and only one hole on the other.
And the size of the hole should be according to the thickness of the rods; a little thicker than the rod and it should be a gut in which the medicines are put or from lamb's parchment, which is according to the form of the small asofras, whose root is one palm.
When therefore the gut is put into the enema, tie it strongly in the tip of the enema between the two parts where it is tied.
Then administer the enema with it.
And this is the form of a circle as depicted here, and of the holes. And the quality of administering with it is: to fill the gut or bag with the medicine which has been warmed according to the amount that the sick person can tolerate; and beware lest it be very hot, or very cold.
Then the sick person is laid down on his back and his legs are raised upward; and place under him a mat, that is, a skin on which people lie, or a linen cloth.
Then grease the tip of the enema with oil, or with egg-white, or with mucilage of fennel, or similar things.Et intromittas in anum eius et trahas ad modum asofrati parui, nisi quod dolor aut contusion in ano est magna, et non possit pati se: sed erunt in hoc omnia interpositi spatii secundum tolerantiam anus infirme usque ad extremitatem clisteris.
Then introduce it into the anus gently.
Then let the assistant take hold of the syringe with both hands and squeeze it vigourously until the entire contents have been discharged into the intestine. Then withdraw the syringe, and the sick person must get up and walk about. If the medicine makes him want to go out then he should hold it in as much as possible.
And if he sleeps with it all night, that is most useful.
If you have to use a clyster when he has an empty stomach and the patient is eager for discharge then repeat the clyster until he is cured.
If there are hemorrhoids or painful sores in the anus then let the clyster be very thin and mild, such as they use for children.
And this is the way to make a thin clyster that has a tight skin.
¶ On Healing Head Wounds Without Fractured Bones.
Chapter 84.
I have already spoken at length in the first book about the treatment of wounds that do not involve a fractured skull, and I will now repeat that discussion here with practical advice and medicinal remedies.The First Book of the First Part on the Healing of Wounds.
I say then that wounds are distinguished according to the cause of the wound and according to the place where the wound falls.For there are some wounds that are caused by blunt instruments and others by sharp instruments; and some fall on the head, some on the neck, some on the chest, some on the limbs, and others elsewhere in the body.Now then, let us discuss each kind of wound.Wounds Caused by Blunt Instruments.Of these there are four kinds: contusions, concussions, compressions, and haematomas.A Contusion is a wound caused by a blunt instrument that does not break the skin but only bruises or discolours it black-and-blue; for instance, when someone is struck with a staff or with the hilt of a sword.
The things that cause many wounds are as varied as a stone thrown at someone; or a cut from a sword, dagger, spear, club, arrow and similar objects.Now there are four kinds of wounds caused by blunt instruments: contusions, concussions, compressions, and haematomas.A Contusion is a wound caused by a blunt instrument that does not break the skin but only bruises or discolours it black-and-blue; for instance, when someone is struck with a staff or with the hilt of a sword.A Concussion is a wound caused by a blunt instrument that breaks the skin and the subcutaneous tissues but does not break any bone; examples are wounds from blows with the butt of a spear or the pommel of a dagger.
Wounds, however, which are inflicted on different parts of the body, such as a wound that falls on the head, or neck, or breast, or abdomen, or liver; and similar wounds in those members.
And I am describing the treatment of certain wounds so that I might lay down that ratio and rule over the rest of the wounds.
And I will begin from simple wounds of the head, for the description of the composite ones will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
I say therefore.
When, therefore, there is inflicted on the head a simple wound and not fracture of bone, consider then if it is from the cast of a stone, or the like, and has only split the skin; and it is a great wound, and you fear an unfavourable issue of a hot pustule: then hasten and phlebotomize the cephalic vein at once: and do not delay this, and withdraw blood from it according to its strength. If nothing forbids phlebotomy, especially if there is little blood which flows out of the wound.
And let the phlebotomy be on the opposite side of the wounded part.
And let the invalid guard himself against repletion, and wine, and coarse food. Et postea fac mox applicare super eum stibium, in unctione olei simplicis: et plies uulnera corporis per pauca dies, nisi sit necessitas de pulvere albi ad applicationem, nam ad uulnera capiti pulvis albus non convenit: sed plies cum oleo.
Then afterwards let him apply to it stibium in the unction of simple oil, and dress the wounds of the body for a few days; unless there is a necessity for powder of white lead for application, for powder of white lead does not become wounds of the head: but dress with oil. If, however, something forbids poulticing, then let it be reduced from food, and do not come near flesh or wine.
And put over the wound if it befall an apostematous pustule, a cotton-wool poultice infused with rose oil alone, or with wine which has astringency. Et fac mox cotum infusum in oleo rosato solo cum uino rosato: si autem est uulnus minus, ponatur cotum cum oleo simplici, et ad eum superponatur stibium cum oleo: sed postea per pauca dies non plies.
And then let a poultice infused with rose oil alone and with rose wine be put on the wound if it is less; and let a poultice with simple oil, and stibium with oil be put over it: but afterwards for a few days do not dress it. If, however, you are secure from a hot pustule, then put over the wound, if it is fresh with its own blood, and has not changed it, the powder which I shall narrate presently; and if it has already changed it, then put over it some unguents until it heals.
If the wound is large or it is from an incision of a sword and similar wounds: and the lips of the wound are not brought together by means of small sutures, then bring them together with a single stitch according to what I will narrate about the stitching of wounds of the abdomen.
If however the wound is already exposed to the bone and hanging and there is no retention of it except by a small sling, then cut it open.
Then treat the wound with medicines and restore to it hard flesh in place of the skin, and prescribe for the patient food which promotes corpulence, such as heads of grain and cooked wheat, until it is like a pulse, and suchlike.Postea, quando uulnus est restituto, incide eum per partes pauca: et si puluis ex eo fluat, excide eum cum scissore: et si non possis uti scissore in toto loco, incide eum per partes pauca, donec possas.
Thereupon when the wound is restored, cut it open through a few places: and if pus flows from it, excise it with a knife; and if you cannot use a knife in the whole place, cut it open through a few places until you can. If however you find putrefaction in the skin and it does not adhere to the bone, then cut away all the putrefied part, and then treat that.Deinde curam illius locum, donec adhaeret ossi: et si non possit ossi adhaerere per diem, et diem: curare illum per dies plures, donec sit curatus: et postea curaturo eum per aliam curam.
If then in these wounds is an artery, or vein from which flows blood: and it is not severed by medicines, then probe above the artery.
If you then find it not cut, then dry it up with Spongy-moss, or tie it up.
But if necessity compels when that which we said does not avail, then sear it until the blood is cut off.
The formula of the powder for flesh-wounds.Take equal parts of gum arabic and powdered alkanet root; add one third as much camphor and mix with rose water to make a paste.
Take one part of frankincense and two parts dragon’s blood, and three parts unquenched lime; mix them well together, sift the mixture and fill the wound with it, binding it well with a good bandage until it clings to it and congeals with the blood.The formula of the powder for flesh-wounds.Take one part frankincense, two parts dragon’s blood, and three parts unquenched lime; mix them well together, sift them, fill the wound therewith, binding it closely with a good bandage until it clings to it well and congeals with the blood.
Then tighten it above with lint, and leave it, not loosening it while it remains, so that it may not come away.For the rest of the wounds that are in parts that can be bound together, fill them up to the level of the skin around with this mixture; then bind them well with linen bandages, which you must make of very soft linen that will not scratch or hurt, and keep them bound until they have well healed over.Of wounds in joints and parts that cannot be bound together.
For it cannot be cleansed with medicine until it has healed.And if the wound is in a joint or part that cannot be bound together, fill it up to the level of the skin around with this mixture; then bind it well with a linen bandage.Of wounds on parts where you cannot apply a poultice.For these wounds you will not be able to use a poultice because they are on parts where no poultice can be put, as in the face and the like.Here you must use another method.
Then you should continue to treat them in this way until they heal.
On wounds of the neck.
Chapter 175.De pulvere ad uulnera in colla.
If a wound happens on the neck, then there is no difference between its treatment and that of a head wound when it is simple.¶ De pulvere ad uulnera in colla.
But if a nerve or artery of the neck has been cut: then if it is a nerve, there is no ability in it except that its treatment should be stopped with something which causes violent constriction, like zinc, and lead white, and similar things.¶ De pulvere ad uulnera in colla.
Because they harm nerves and constrict them.
And do not place anything at all that is cold upon the wound: for the substance of the nerves is cold, and their continuance is with the brain, which is the most noble of the members; and let its medicine be mild, as lime-water often infused with sweet water, or oil, and rosin, when washed also with sweet water; and the other mineral stones, after this manner, and moist ointments.
But if the wound is great, then apply a stitch to it; or draw together its lips with threads.
Then heal it, until it is healed.
But if there is a depth to the wound, or it happens that there is a sinus in its lower part, in which there has already gathered pus, then pierce it in a more depressed place within.
If indeed there is an artery that has been cut within the wound, and its flow of blood continues: then separate it, or ligate it; or cauterize it if necessity calls for it.
But if the thyroids have already been touched by a cut or a piercing, and are healthy: then draw together the lips of the skin with a stitch above the tube of the throat, and do not touch the thyroid, but rather move it back into its natural shape.
Then tighten it decently, and leave it for several days.
Then heal it with ointments that have astringency and drying quality, until it is healed.
But if the wound has indeed made an impression on the bone, then probe it; then if there are pieces of bone in it, extract them all, or as many as you can: and what does not prepare itself, leave it until the wound becomes rotten, and separates and heals up.
If the wound is recent, then powder over it the powder which I described above.Et si non est puluis medecinae, quod in multo pluris est: tunc resorbito pus et sanguis, quae intra sunt eius, et applicando super uulnus puluerem medicatum omittas lavare: aut lavando, et pului superponendo, resorbeas pus et sanguinem intra ipsum.
If however a bone is seen in the wound and it causes a fistula, then cure it with that which was mentioned in its chapter.
Chapter 86.
If therefore a gust of wind comes out when the injured person breathes, then know that the wound is fatal.Si autem uidetur in ulnere os et fit fistula: tunc cura ipsam cum eo cuius rememoratio uenit in capitulo suo.
If however a bone is seen in the wound and it causes a fistula: then cure it with that which was mentioned in its chapter. If it has no depth, and is fresh with blood: then do not put powder on it from the first hour or tightly bandage it so the blood is not held back in its depth and turns back to the heart and kills the injured person; but put an attractive ointment on it and loosen it twice a day.
If you do not have the ointment present however, then put a warm cloth on the opening of the wound so that it sucks out what comes out of it from moisture; and let the injured person sleep with his head over the wound so that what collects in it runs out.Quamuis autem uulnus non est in ossibus, tamen si vidueris quod facit fi stulam, et est de profunde, et sanguis multus egreditur: neque possunt repellere illum qui est in ulnere: tunc ponas puluere super eum, et stringas, donec desinuat.
If, however, three days or more have passed since the wound, and no spasms occur to the invalid, nor any bad trembling of the heart, nor any constriction in breathing; if you observe that his other functions are good: then you may know that the wound is healing.
Therefore treat him with warm baths and the rest of the treatment until he is healed.
If, however, his cure is delayed, and the wound opens continually: then you may know that it has become a fistula.
Therefore treat it from its head.
And if the wound is from a sword or dagger and is superficial on the chest or back: then treat it with that which preceded it from sewing, if it is large; or with dust, if it is small.Et fac tibi quod dicunt Chynium super eam, et in ulla parte corporis, si vis.
If, however, it has made an imprint on the bone and cut splinters from it then probe the wound and hasten to extract those splinters if they are separated.
If however they are not separated then leave them until the wound putrefies for their extraction would only cause great pain.
Regarding other accidents that wounds may have in other parts of the body, you should make your judgement in curing them according to what has already been said.
Of wounds of the Belly and those that cause the Intestine to come forth and concerning their issues.
CHAPTER 76.
A rupture of the belly may be great, or middle-sized, or small.The great rupture is that which is produced in the whole belly; and it happens thus: When a man receives a violent blow on the belly, while he is taking a deep breath, and if the blow is so forceful that it causes him to exhale violently, then he suffers a violent rupture of the belly.
Therefore sometimes from a great rupture the intestines issue forth, or their number.And they often issue through a large opening which has been made in the skin by the force of the blow.They also issue through an opening which is made in the belly itself.This happens when a man has received a violent blow on the belly while he is exhaling, for then the intestines are pushed out through that part of the belly which has been forced out by the violence of the blow, and so they escape through an opening made in the belly itself.And if they issue through the opening made in the skin by the force of the blow, then as we have said, their issue is easy, for the intestines are forced out with great ease.But if they issue through an opening made in the belly itself, then their issue is not so easy, but rather difficult and dangerous, because then it is necessary that part of the belly be torn away and the intestines come forth through a larger opening.
For this reason their insertion is made, and their sewing is much more violent and difficult.And it sometimes happens that part of the intestines issue from the rupture which has been caused in the belly by a blow, but that they are not exposed; for then they are inserted into the wound itself, and thus they are held inside.Then when the intestines are inserted into the wound itself their sewing is much more difficult, because then it is necessary to sew both the intestines and the walls of the belly which were torn away from the bones by the violence of the blow.Now this kind of rupture is most dangerous for the patient, because the intestines are exposed to injury, and if they are injured, then he dies.And this wound often causes death, even when it has healed, for it leaves a weak spot; therefore a man must be very careful about it, so that he does not suffer another blow on that part, lest he die, as has been said.And if any man wishes to test this, then let him place his fingers in such a wound and press gently until he feels the intestines, for he will find them exposed just beneath the skin; therefore if anything hard strikes it, the intestines are injured at once by the blow.Now when a man suffers a middle-sized rupture, then part of his intestines come forth; but they do not project far out of the wound, but rather remain inserted in the wound itself.And this is more frequent and more dangerous to life than the other kind of rupture.For this reason it is not easy for such a rupture to heal up and be cured, because it is difficult to cover those intestines which are exposed just beneath the skin with an integument; therefore they require long and careful treatment.Of small ruptures we shall speak in the chapter on wounds of the belly.
And a minor disruption is also made difficult in another way.
Therefore a reduction of these is more difficult if you do not hurry into the insertion immediately; because it swells, opens and grows larger: therefore its entry becomes difficult.
Therefore a medium disruption of disruptions is better; because with it the reduction of the intestine does not become difficult as it does with these two kinds.
Know that sewing is according to four ways.Primus modo fit per limum: secundum per ligaturam: tertium per fimbriam: quarto autem per concionem.
Two common seams meet in the sewing of the belly and in the sewing of other wounds of the body; and two other seams properly communicate with other wounds.Et duo sunt genera utrumque: videlicet: inter se et cum suo proprio genere.
However, they are more proper with the sewing of the belly; and I will tell you each one with explanation and description. So I say that when a wound is small and something comes out of it from the intestine, and it is difficult to reduce it; then that is because of one of two ways.Si autem euitatur ex ea uulnus aliquid, ut debuerit per se: et non potest reduci ad locum suum: tunc illud est pro altero modo.
Or it may be due to the smallness of the wound, as we have said; or because there is distention in the intestines caused by cold air.
When therefore it is thus, you must warm it by dipping a sponge or a piece of cloth dampened with tepid water.
Or you may boil in water squills, cyperus and saffron, and warm the intestines with this until the distention is relieved.
Sometimes wine does it because of its astringency; this is better than water alone for relieving the distention.
When you see that the distention has been relieved, then moisten the intestines with water in which alder or mallows have been boiled.
For by this the entrance is eased with a small thing.Et facias ei potio de uino et aqua calida, donec introeat illum in ventrem.
And give him a drink of warm wine and water until it enters his belly.But if he still refuses to pass anything after this treatment, then find that the wound is small, using the instrument with which they cut off piles.
The first cure is better when prepared than when done by cutting; and it does not involve compulsion to cut after the necessity and defect of the instrument.
Let one part of it be turned and sharp, while the other is not sharp; and let its slender tip not be very slender, but rather blunt: and let that which resembles barleycorn be as you see it.Sunt etii qui faciunt extremum subtile ut spathumilis, cum non debet esse subtilis sicut diximus.
When a wound has increased in size and goes into the intestine, then it is necessary that it be reduced according to its natural form in its proper place if possible; for this is better.
When however the rupture is broad at the lower part of the belly, then it is necessary to cause the sick man to lie on his back and put his legs higher than his head.
And if it is at the upper part of the belly, then place his head and breast higher than his lower parts.
And likewise if the rupture is on one of the two parts of the belly, then always have this intention and thought, that the part where the wound is be higher than the other.Et si est in medio uentris: tunc faciat sese manere infirmum super dorsum suum, et sit caput eius altius quam pectus eius, et pectus eius altius quam crura eius, et crura eius altia quam pedes eius.
And if it is in the middle of the belly, then let the sick man lie on his back, and let his head be higher than his breast, and his breast higher than his legs, and his legs higher than his feet. And thus you ought to manage it in great wounds, and in medium wounds.
But in small wounds, arrange it according to what is prepared for you.
Then let a faithful assistant stand between your hands, who holds the whole rupture with his hand; and unite its lips.Et si non potest una mano teneri tota disruptio: facit ut teneatur ab omnibus ministeribus, qui possunt, et superimponantur eadem cum manibus manibus suis.
Then uncover a little of the wound and stitch it up in little stitches one after another; this is the usual method for stitching a single wound.
You must take as many needles as there are wounds according to the size of the wound.
Then leave as much of the wound as a finger width, that is, the width of your little finger; and push the needle through both sides of the skin and both ends of the muscle under the skin from one end to the other until you have joined up both ends of the skin and both ends of the muscle. You will now have made four stitches.
Then tie with double thread around the needle several times from both sides at once until you have joined up both lips of the wound neatly.
Then leave the width of a finger again and push in another needle; then draw it straight through with the thread as you did with the first needle.
You must not stop doing this until you have completed the stitching of the whole wound.Postea remittes acus omnes: et tu iterum stringes in circumitu, quousque facias eam constrictiom decentem et firmam.
Then take out all the needles; and tie again in a circle until you have made the stitching decent and firm.The middle needles should be between the thin and thick ones because the thin needles go very easily through the flesh and the thick ones are difficult to go into the skin; therefore they should be in the middle, not too thin nor too thick.
And the needles should not be pushed into both ends of the skin near each other too much so that the flesh is not cut through easily and the wound opened before it has healed, and they are not elongated with stitching so that the wound is not prevented from healing.Deinde ut facies constrictionem uulneris in circumitu, tu fige acum in eam et stringe cum filo.
Then cut off the tips of the nails so that they do not hurt the patient while sleeping; and put cotton wads from pieces of cloth on all sides which hold the tips of the nails; and leave them until you know that the wound is healed.
This type of suture with nails is more convenient for small wounds.
Because one, two or about that number of nails are sufficient for the suture.
The second common suture is to gather with the suture the four ends: the two ends of the skin and the two ends of the sinew in place of one, with a needle in which is an unwound thread equal in fineness and thickness.
Then when you have penetrated with the needle these four ends, bring back the needle from the part where you began so that the unwound thread may drop down from the upper part of the wound; let there be a suture like the suture of cloth wherewith clothes are bound up and place between each suture a quantity equal to the thickness of the little finger.
This is known as the stitch.
And I used this stitch to heal a wound which had happened to a man on his belly who had been wounded with a knife and the wound was more than one palm in length; and it had come out about two palms from the bowels from the middle intestine, and there was a rupture in the middle of the belly.Et cum hac sutura curauit meos homines qui fuerant uulnerati.
I therefore reduced that after it stood its bowels outside the wound xxiv hours.
The wound was consolidated therefore within the space that was about xv days: and I cured it, and it was healed: and he lived after it many years, conversing in his own dispositions.
And the physicians judged, that he would not be healed.
And it was a miracle, that I did not cure it with ointment.
Forasmuch as I was in a place where no ointment might be found, nor any medicine.Et Deus misercors et pius mihi adiuuat et curaui eum cum sale et oleo.
I therefore laid on the wound a dry cloth twice a day, and I continued washing it with honey water, until it was healed.Et non posui super eum cotum nouum, sed uetustum, et salem, qui super uulnus posuerat, fuit sal iocundum.
I will say that there are two kinds of proper suture according to speech.
And it is that you start with an acute suture, and you insert the needle from the outside to the inside.
And when the needle is inserted into the skin and into the tendon extending according to the length and breadth of the whole body: Let the point of the needle remain on the side where you inserted it, and make another penetration from the inside out to the other end with the point.
And when you have made it penetrate, then make it penetrate according to this in the same end from the outside to the inside: and leave the point of the needle which is on this side, and make the needle penetrate into the other end from the inside out, and let it be penetrated with your penetration as you make it penetrate the point of the needle which is in the part, until it penetrates completely.
Then start from this same side and sew it with the end, which is from the point of the needle on the other side, and pull out the needle from the skin where it has penetrated.Fac illum tamen ad extremitatem aliam penetrare qua non fuit ante penetrata: et fac eam penetrare in extremitatem alteram ab interiori parte ad exteriorem, donec penetret totum cum totum.
Then reduce it to that skin and its edge which is in the other side with this edge of the mirror; and extract it from the skin which is of its part, and make that one end and another; and make that one after one until you have finished all the outer parts according to that example.
And the sum of this suture is that you sew the skin of the pelts as they are pelts: so that you sew its edge one end from one side of the skin; and you leave it another end from the other side, until you finish.
The second kind of proper suture which Galen said.
This speech of his is related, that you reduce it according to the likeness by which some healers reduce them, so that they aggregate every part to its proper mate by nature; and they apply one end of the edge to the other end of this skin, and the mirror to the other end of the skin.
And that is done according to what I narrate for you.
You ought to place the needle into the mirror close to you from the outer part, and make it penetrate to the inside only in that; and leave both ends of the edge.
Then revolve the needle, and make it penetrate from the outer part to the inside into both ends of the edge, namely on both sides.Et extrahe acum, et uidebis quod tua sutura completur per naturam.
Then revolve both, also make them penetrate from the inside to the outside into the other two mirrors, which are in the opposite side.Et extrahe ambas, et fac illas penetrare per naturam ad omnes partes.
And these ways of suture is a better common suture, and it is a suture whose precedence precedes remembrance.Et sic fit quod omnes partes suantur: et utrique sutura faciuntur in una persona, sed per se, scilicet mirach per se et sifac per se, ut narramus tibi.
And thus is the speech of Galen also.Et quod sequitur huius modi suturam facere.
And what follows this kind of making suture.And some have said.Quemadmodum si suamus utramque partem, et quia non possimus completam facere per naturam, sed debemus in illo loco per se suturam facere per artem: ita quod dimittas extremitates omnes ad suas conuenientes partes donec compleas: sed utrasque partes non dimittas ad illum locum.
It is cured with a stitch in the belly with two needles.
That is, put into both of them one thread, and begin with the insertion of the needle from that which is by you, and make it penetrate as far as the other side according to their stitch who sew leathers equally.
And know that when the disruption is in the middle of the belly, then its stitch is more difficult than other locations of the belly.
The judgement of the medicine of the wound however, is the judgement of the rest of the wounds.
That is, because when you pursue a fresh wound with its blood before the air alters it, and you bring back the intestine, and itself to itself, and adapt itself, then put over the powder of embrocations.Et si tu non possis facere ut intestina reducas ad locum suum: sed debes conserare uulnus cum pulvere incarnatiuum et cothonico panno, et fac omnia ut debes facere in reliquis uulneribus, quod est, et ponas super ea unctionem et facias omnia ut antea.
If the air has already altered the wound then put over it some ointments which are present to you until they cause pus and fall and the flesh is consolidated.And if one of them becomes dead, cut off that one with a pair of scissors, and make an incision in another place in the same way as before, and pour out the pus and blood and apply powder on it, and bind it up.And when the wound has healed then open it and examine whether the intestines are put to their places or not, if they are not then cut off the dead flesh around it.
Then cure that as is the cure of the rest of the wounds until it heals.And know that sometimes you find a wound in the belly from which you cannot bring out the intestines, or it is not appropriate to do so, then you should sew up the wound with powder and a cotton cloth, and do all as you do before in other wounds, and put over it ointment, and do everything as before.And when the wound has healed then open it and examine whether the intestines are put to their places or not, if they are not then cut off the dead flesh around it.
If however medicines are not present to you then put over it immediately, as soon as it starts emitting pus, old cotton and change it twice a day, as I taught you until it heals.And if the wound is in the middle of the belly or below then put over it old cotton and bind it with an appropriate binding, so that the intestines are pressed to their place, and make all as we have said before.
If you fear that the wound will extend to the principal parts of the body, then you should soak a piece of clean wool in oil tempered with moderate heat or in rose oil and place it around the areas between the groin and under the armpits.
If he feels pain, or prickling, or putrefaction in his intestines (for this often happens), then you should use the enema with the wine which constricts, black and tepid: especially if the putrefaction has already reached the intestine and a piercing wound is about to occur there.
And you should know that what comes from the large intestine has an easier cure; and what comes from the thin one is more difficult to cure.Et si sentit dolorem per uenam naturalem, et per illam naturam quae in omnium corporum est, non debet michi credere quod sic accidat per pestilentiam: sed debet michi credere quod ille dolor sit de calore humorum intra se habentium et concauitatum intra se habitantium.
And if he feels pain through the natural vein, and through that nature which is in all bodies, he should not believe me that this happens because of pestilence; but he should believe that this pain is from the heat of humors within him, and the concavities within him. And the intestine which is called the Small Intestine does not accept a cure from a wound which happens to it at all: and that is because of the multitude of veins in it, and the magnitude of them, and because of the delicateness of its body, and the nearness of its nature to nerves.
But if what comes from the wound is pus, and you pursue it fresh: reduce it according to your reduction, by which you reduce the intestines equally.Et si in eo quod procedit ex intestino omnino non sentit uulnus, sed sentit putredinem et tenesmus, et exitus non fit ex eo, debet michi credere quod ille exitus per uenam naturalem non factus sit, propter pestilentiam intrinsecus habendam.
If however the space has been surpassed and it has become green or black then one must tie it with a thread above the spot which has turned black because of this so that no flow of blood will occur.
In the ear there are veins and arteries
Then cut what is beyond that ligature and leave two ends of the thread hanging from the lower part of the wound outside it in order that the attraction of it might be relieved over you and its extraction at the case of the ear and the emission of the pus of the wound.
¶ A reminder of the wound which happened in the Intestine.
When the disruption occurs in the Intestine and it is slight then it is possible that it be restored in some men because I have seen who was wounded in his belly with a spear thrust and the wound was from the right of the stomach and it was an old wound: and a Fistula was made and exuded from it egestion and flatulence.
I therefore put a treatment on it until I was not convinced of its healing: nor did I cease to subtilize it until it was healed and the place consolidated.Et ueni ad alium qui habebat uulnus in Intestino, et illa res ualuit post diuersos mees: et vidi quod non erat mihi possibile ut curarem eum.
After I saw that the wound had healed well, I was afraid that the patient would suffer some harm in his abdomen because of it, but he did not.
And he remained in better condition, eating and drinking, and copulating, and he went into the bath, and exercised himself with his exercises.
And now certain experienced men say that when a wound occurs in the intestine, and it is slight, then one ought to ligature it in this way.
And you take large-headed ants.
Then gather together the two lips of the wound, and place an ant there which has its mouth open over the two lips of the wound.Et ponas alias super os antice.
And you place others in front of its mouth.When it bites and tightens its mouth, cut off its head, for it will adhere, and not let go.Hic ligatur uulnus: nam formica cum accenditur, stringit os suum et non soluit nisi mortua sit.
The wound is then ligatured; for when the ant is burnt, it tightens its mouth and does not let go unless it dies.Then place another ant near the first one, and do not cease doing this with ant after ant according to the quantity of the whole wound.Et sic faciunt qui scierunt experientiam, et curo uulnera in intestinis et in viscere.
Then reduce the hernia and the wound.
For these heads will remain attached to the intestines until the intestines are eaten and healed, so that no harm at all occurs to the invalid. And now it is possible that the intestines should be tied with a fine thread; which is taken from the bowels of an animal and is attached to it when it is introduced into the point of the needle.
And you take the end of this thread out of the intestines, and a great deal of flesh is taken away.
Then tie at its end a thin unwound linen thread.
Then introduce that thread into the needle with its intestine.
Then reduce it to its dislocation. And this mode of sewing with ants and intestines is nothing else than according to the way of hope and expectation.Illa enim capita remanent annexa in Intestino, donec cibetur Intestinum, et sanetur, et non accidat infirmo nocumentum penitus.
Know that a wound which is large and wide, especially if it is on one of the slender intestines, then there is no cure other than by suturing; there is absolutely no other way to heal it.
On the treatment of hernia and fistula.
Chapter 78.
Know that any wound or ulcer when it becomes old and aged, and turns into an ulcer, and does not heal, and always emits pus and does not heal: then it is universally called a fistula, no matter in which part of the body it may be; we call it hernia.
A fistula is indeed a filtered knot, hard and white; with which there is no pain, and which has the hollow shape of a bird's feather; and because of this some call it Risata, that is, feather.Et quia per longum tempus non potest curari nisi subtiliatione: quomodo scilicet uulnus, de quo loquuti sumus, non potest curari nisi sutura.
And it is in some hours moist, emitting pus.
And perhaps the moisture splits in some hours.
And sometimes this moisture is abundant, and sometimes it is scant. And sometimes it is thick, and sometimes it is fine.
And I have already mentioned this in my discussion when I spoke about wounds: that every wound which does not heal and in which no flesh is born is due to one of nine causes.
Of these causes, one is either due to the lack of blood in the body or due to its wickedness or because there is hard flesh between it and under its lip which prevents the birth of flesh, or because there is much filth and dirtiness or because the ulcer within itself is putrid and the matter discharged from it is of poor quality, or because the medicine used for treating it is unsuitable, or because the corruption falling into the region is a kind of pestilence, due to the nature of the region as it happens in Caesaraugusta where the digestion of ailments is made difficult and the natural healing of sores is delayed. Or finally, it could be because there is one bone or a number of bones in it.
And I have already shown all of these causes and their signs, and their treatments with medicines in my discussion. And it is fitting that here I should make you know the treatment of a fistula and wound which is done through an operation by hand.Et scito quod oportet ante omnia purificare locum: et si est magna sordiciei et cruda, oportet urere cum focis ligna et sale, donec totus placeat.
Know then that a fistula can occur in all parts of the body.And it is fitting to cleanse the place first and if there is much filthiness and coarseness, it is fitting to burn it with fire and salt until it is completely cleansed.
For from them there are fistulas which penetrate to the large veins or arteries, or nerves, or sinew, or to the intestines or to a ureter, or to one of the ribs, or to one of the vertebrae of the back, or to one of the joints made of composition like the hand and foot. And from them there are fistulas which discharge near to the principal member, and similar ones.Et scito quod ex eis sunt Fistulae quaedam uadentes ad uenas magnas et arterias, aut neruos, aut sifac: aut ad intestinum, aut ad uesicam, aut ad aliquam ex costis: aut ad aliquam ex spondilibus dorsi, aut ad aliquam iuncturarum compositarum compositione: sicut in mano, et pede.
What then from these fistulas is according to this mode, is from diseases difficult of cure, and does not receive a cure, and the occupation with it is labour and ignorance.
What if it is from a fistula of which the depth does not reach to those places which I have said; and you hope and trust in its cure; and see that you perceive the nature thereof, then take a probe of brass or iron, if the fistula extends according to its straightness, and explore it with this.
But if there is a tortuosity in the fistula, then explore it with a thin lead probe.Quamvis namque sit tortuosa et tortuosa, tamen per se omnia loca quae sunt circa eam peruenit tentum, sed si ad aliquod profundum pervenit et non potest ibi intrare neque procedere, tunc est in loco illo fistula.
For although it is tortuous and tortuous, nevertheless with the softness of its body it is eased, and bent around the tortuosity.And because lead with its softness is eased, and bent around the tortuosity.Si autem est in loco qui non recipit eam, et non potest procedere neque curuari circa locum illum, tunc est fistula moriendi.
If it is a fistula having many openings, you will not be able to mark it with a probe.
Therefore, irrigates the opening out of its openings.
For the moisture with which you irrigate it, flows towards other openings and runs out of them.Quod si est in corpore humano, adde ad tentem linteum.
If it is in the human body, add to the probe a piece of linen.Then examine closely as best you can: to know whether there is bone, or nerve, and the fistula's concavity is far off, or near at hand; or the fistula is single with many openings, and stand over all of it, with utmost strength: with your interrogation by which you interrogate the infirm, and discovery of pain upon compression with your hand over the spot, and similar signs and accidental causes of apستمati.
When therefore you have stood over all of it, in its true position, then proceed to a cure according to your confidence; and consider that if the fistula appears near at hand, or in a sound place far off from the junction, or nerve, artery or vein, or one of the places which I said to you: then cut the fistula according to what was said before, out of my narrative, and take away what is in it of filtration, and corrupted flesh, that is born in its opening out of flesh, or thetul, and similar; and heal it, until it is cured.
But if the fistula is of great depth, and is according to its rightness, then you must cut it in its depth as much as is possible for you.Et si non possis percutere, et excidere totum illud in profundo, ne facias quod uenat per orificium post excisionem tua: sed est quod debes ut diluas eam cum oleo calido, et teras cum tentorium tuum, donec aperiatur, et per eam ueniat sanguis multum, et per eam carni non possit manere neque crescere, et miasmatibus non possit in ea nasci, sed debet cadere: quia si manet, et crescit miasma in ea, quod nascitur in eius orificio, et non cadunt, et non curantur: et est quod debes ut excidas postea omnia illa carnem corruptam de orificio eius, et secundum fortitudinem tuae teras locum illum intra, donec aperiat eum totum, per quo possit evacuare sanguis multum ex ea, et miasma.
Then cleanse it from all its rotten flesh.
Then apply pieces of linen dipped in sharp medicines; and introduce them into the hollow of the fistula which you have grasped with the iron; do this several times until the sharp medicine corrodes all that remains in the hollow of the fistula from the rottenness.
Then heal it with ointments which generate healthy flesh, until it is healed.
If however it does not heal in this way, then brand it according to what we have related.
If therefore the cause of the fistula is bone, and this is certified to you; then probe it and cut it according to what I have told you; if anything prevents you from doing this out of regard for a vein, or nerve, or chief member, as we have said.
If therefore bone is discovered and there is something of rottenness and blackness in it; then scrape it away until all its rottenness is removed.Et si post haec non remansit nihil nisi sanguis et carne quae est circa os: tunc reseca carnem, et sanguinem extrahe, donec concauitas Fistulae omnino tollatur.
And if afterwards nothing remains but blood and the flesh which is around the bone; then cut away the flesh and draw out the blood until the hollow of the fistula is completely removed.Then heal it with that which makes it grow together, until it is healed.Et si post haec remansit quiddam ad concauitatem Fistulae: tunc reseca eam usque ad os.
And if afterwards something remains to the hollow of the fistula; then cut it away to the bone. And if it does not heal and discharges pus as before; then know that you have not reached the complete eradication of the rottenness.
Therefore probe it again, and make a thorough scraping and cleansing of it with all your strength.
Then heal it.
If therefore it heals, it is good; and if not, then know that the rottenness is in a remote depth of the body which you did not reach.
Therefore you have no skill for it except to leave it to nature.
If the bone is rotten in a small place and you can reach it, pull it with delicate forceps which are suited to it.Et si non possis attrahere totum corrumperens: reseca tamen eum locum quo potes, et trahe de illo quod potes: et cura illum postea cum medicinis quae generant carnem.
But if there are many bones, then make an exquisite attraction of them all, and leave nothing behind with your strength.
But if you find anything contrary from the moistness, and there is no fear or error in the incision of them, then cut into the moistness and flesh, if they are there, and free the bones.
But if you have no preparation to pull out the bones from your hour, then put over the wound what putrefies it; and leave it until it putrifies what is in the surroundings of those bones from flesh and moistness.
And guard the wound so that it does not consolidate.And in the meantime, while you are putting the bone back in its place, let one person take a stone or a weight which will be put over the bone to keep it still, and let another hold the patient's hand.
And the cut that you made is pressed in your operation.And if the bone has not yet been set properly, then make a splint of iron or wood over which will be put the stone or weight, and let it be held tightly by a ligature over the bone until it is set.Et si ossa non sunt uestra et subita, sed sunt dura, sintque in locis uulgaribus: non tibi est necesse faciendi super eorum sectiones, aut operandi eorum carnes.
Put on it, if you will, powdered sulfur mixed with oil; or cotton immersed in Egyptian ointment, or any of the various violet ointments.
For when those moist humors rot and the bones are separated from them, their removal and attraction is eased.
But if it is a large bone, such as the shin-bone or the hip-bone, and similar to them, and what is rotted in it is a large part; then scrape it with the last rasor, until that blackness and rottenness is removed.
Then restore the wound.Et si quod scilicet est sub cutis, et quod ad os pertinet, non potest tollerib, sed debet resecari cum scalpellet: et quod in ipso est, quae scilicet ueniunt sub cutem et sub integumentum, tollite.
And if what is under the skin and pertaining to the bone cannot be removed, but must be cut away with a scalpel; then remove from it what comes under the skin and under the integument. But if what is rotted in it is a large part, and the rottenness has already reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to close it up, and cut it all the way to where the rottenness has reached: then cure it until it becomes solid again. And I will tell you a tale of a man and his leg; place this as an example and aid for your operation.Zuken erant uiri boni, cuius erat quoddam uulnus in crure, quod per multos mensas non curabatur.
There was a good man of thirty years of age, who had a wound on his leg, which was not cured for many months. This happened to him in his inner body, that is from within, until the matter reached his leg and there was a great abscess: and there was no external cause.Et per multos mensas non curabatur, donec fuit magna corruptio, et apostematum multum, donec peruenerunt ad loca quae uocantur osse: et per multos dies non potuit ambulare, nec dormire in litteris, sed dormiebat in solariis domus suae.
And for many months it was not cured, until there was a great rottenness and a large abscess, until it reached the bones: and for many days he could not walk nor sleep in his bed, but slept on the floor of his house. So the time was prolonged with error of the physicians, until the abscess opened, and much matter ran out with it.Et quiuerunt super ei medici multo numero, et non possunt curare apostematum illud nec uulnus.
And then its treatment was postponed until it is healed and many holes are made in the leg; all of them exuded pus and fluids from the body.
And many physicians treated him for about two years, and there was no expert in the art who could do anything with it until I was called and saw his leg and the matter flowing out of those holes at a great rate; indeed, the whole body of the man had wasted away and his colour was yellowish.
I therefore inserted a probe into one of the openings and it went right down to the bone.
Then I probed all the openings and found that they interconnected with one another throughout the leg.Et intromisi manum meam intra os, et peruenit ad ossem cruris, et tentauit eam: sed non potuit intrare ultra. So I probed it with my hand and found that it reached the bone of the leg; but it could not go any further.I then cut away at one of those openings until I exposed a part of the bone; and I found that it was rotten, blackened, decayed, and perforated right through to the marrow.Et intromisi in eum tentum: et peruenit ad medullam cruris: et tentauit eam, et non potuit intrare ultra.
I then inserted a probe into it; and it reached the marrow of the leg but could go no further.So I cut away what I had exposed, and removed matter prepared from the rotten bone.Et intromisi tentum in medullam cruris: et peruenit ad superos ossis, quod est sub capite: et peruenit ad superos ossis: sed non potuit intrare ultra.
I then inserted a probe into the marrow of the leg; and it reached the bone below the head; but it could not go any further.And I decided that there was no more in the bone except for this corruption which I cut away and removed.Et intromisi manum meam, et tenui superos ossis: et peruenit ad superos ossis medullam, et tentauit eam, sed non potuit intrare ultra.
And I now removed it.
Then I put the restoration of the wound with consolidating medicines in a long space.
And it is not consolidated.
Then I attempted its restoration.
And it is not restored.
Then I restored it with medicines, and it was quickly consolidated and healed; and this repetition of the operation upon it had not been necessary, nor the cutting of it, except because of the weakness of the sick person, and his lack of tolerance, and my fear for him about death: because the bad condition of a syncopic flow had happened to him in all hours.
He was therefore healed with whole healing; and there grew up in the place of the bone hard flesh, and good became the arrangement in his body, and his strength returned to him: and he changed in his arrangements; and it did not do him any harm at all in walking.
But if the bone outstanding in a place of the body is already broken: then you must saw it, according to this manner: and there is: that you take a ligament, and tighten it on the end of the outstanding bone; and order someone else, who extend it upward: and put another ligament made of wool more coarse than the first. Then ligate it over the flesh which is above the bone; and extend its extremity, so as to draw the flesh downward; and you uncover the flesh over the place which you wish to saw, so that the saw does not damage the flesh.Et fac ut serret urtor, donec uideat sanguem, qui fluere debet ex carnibus super serram: et postea ligatur cum ligamentis.
Put wood or a board underneath the bone in the center below: for when you do that, it will not be prevented from cutting the rotten flesh.
And it is appropriate that there be a saw over the rotten place a little, so that the rottenness is not in the hollow of the bone: and it does not appear to the senses in its appearance, and forces another to its saw. If the bone is rotten and not protruding, but continuing with its part: and the rottenness is in the middle of it or in its part, then uncover the flesh from all parts completely.
Then put wood underneath.
Then saw it from the first part, where the rottenness is, until the saw continues from another part; and let the saw be according to the length a little from the rottenness, according to what we said.Et faciamus Serraturam in ossibus ex parte una et alterius partes.
If there is a corruption in the junction, cut that junction of corruption and saw the bone where it continues from the other part.
But if the corruption is in the continuation of two junctions, then there is no art in it except abrasion.
If the corruption is in the pectin of the hand or in the pectin of the foot, then the thing in it is very difficult.
But you should inquire how the corruption appears to you.Quam ob rem si appareret tibi in parte superiori, tunc debes incidere partem superiorem pectinatus.
And you should cut off the upper part of the pectin and abrade it and cleanse it according to whatever arrangement is possible for you and with whatever art that it can be rectified for you, when it does not cause you a contradiction Vein or Nerve.Quam ob rem si appareret tibi corruptio in parte inferiori: debes facere similiter, et mundare eam secundum ingenium quod tibi possit fieri.
And you should know that there are many cutting tools and saws for cutting these bones, according to the location of the bones, their preparation, and their own thickness and thinness, and magnitude, and smallness, and hardness, and their rarity.Et scito quod ista serrae, et incisoria quaedam sunt ad ossa magnia et grossa, quaedam ad ossa minima et subtilia: et quaedam sunt ad ossa dura et solida: et quaedam ad ossa rara et concava.
And therefore you must prepare every kind of tool that is suitable for the operation.Et si quae serram, vel incisoria non possis facere, sedere debes ab artifice qui sciat facere eam secundum necessitatem operationis, et secundum situm ossis, et grossitudinem eius.
And know that these operations indicate to you in terms of the instrument which you will need when you have a long time with you.
And the knowledge of the ways of this art, a witness to the ways of diseases; for then you will find through yourself that which is suitable for it from instruments for every illness.
The shape of a saw.
The shape of another saw.Forma tertii Serrae.
The shape of a third saw.The shape of another saw.Forma tertii Serrae.
The shape of the fourth saw.Forma quinti Serrae.
This form of the saw should be made with care. Let its bow be uppermost, its edge out of iron; and its handle out of boxwood, and let it be accurately made into a pyramid.
The form of the razor for joints.
Let the head of this razor be according to the form of the head of a star-clinching nail; and its points according to the form of the points of the star of David.
And it is not fitting, unless they are rubbed with it, when they are broken, or the bone is wide and great.
The form of the greater razor.
The form of the middle razor.
The form of the broad razor.
The form of the razor in which there is a concavity.
The form of the other fine razor.
The form of the razor whose end is curved.
The form of the small, fine-toothed razor.
The form of the razor with which bones are cut.
Also the form of the great razor.
This is like a chisel, and its end is like a saw; it is used in many places for cutting bones.
The form of the razor that is fitting to be used for rasping what has been bored through with bones.
Its end is triangular and its points are acute.Forma Rasorii ad rasionem ossium.
Take a needle and thread it with silk.
And likewise one ought to make all those things we have said out of razors, and knives, and scissors.
Of the cutting of limbs and the sawing of bones.
Chapter 89.
Limbs putrefy either from an external or internal cause.
When therefore the medicine has not brought about a cure after applying medical remedies for that putrefaction, and the remedy does not help: and you see the putrefaction taking place in a limb which does not receive any relief: then it is necessary to cut off that limb up to where the putrefaction can be seen, so that the sick person may be saved from death or from greater harm due to the defect of the member.
And the sign by which it happens is that the limb becomes black until it putrefies: either because fire burns it or it putrefies after becoming black: until the putrefaction is cut off up to that part which follows the limb and creeps throughout the body.Et omnes partes quae post illa sunt, si non erunt percutiunt a illo malicia, et serpitus in totum corpus, quod non curabitur usque ad mortem.
Therefore deal promptly with its incision and likewise if the cause of decay is from the stings of some venomous creatures as scorpion fish, sea urchin, weever fish and similar.
If then the decay or sting is at the tip of a finger, cut off the finger and do not leave any space for decay to spread as far as the rest of the hand.
And likewise if it happens on the hand, cut off the hand from its root at the joint and do not leave any space for decay to spread as far as the elbow joint.Et si accidit in brachio, tunc incide eum usque ad axillam, et non des spacium corruptioni donec capiat in focili humeri.
And if it has entered in, then cut the arm by the elbow at its joint. But if the gangrene extends to all around the elbow joint, the patient will die.
And you should know that a certain measure of skill is required beyond this treatment.
And so you should do with the foot when gangrene strikes a toe, then cut it at one of the joints; and if it affects the instep, cut off the whole foot.
But if it rises to the knee, cut the leg at the knee joint.
If however the gangrene has already reached above the knee there is no remedy but to give up the patient and let him die.
And how you cut off a limb or tie it is by gripping the lower ligature which you mean to cut, and tying the other ligature above the site.
And one assistant holds the lower ligature tight, and the other assistant holds the upper ligature above it.Postea incide in medio, ubi sunt duae ligaturae: et postea uterque minister, qui teneant ligaturas, dimittat ligaturas, sicuti quod incideris in medio.
And you separate the flesh that is between the two ligaments with a broad spatulum until all the flesh is exposed.
Then it should be cut into, or bound up.
And you should place a linen cloth over it from all sides so that the serrated instrument doesn't touch the healthy area; and let harm be done to the injured part with an addition of suppuration and heat.
But if there is internal bleeding during the operation, then quickly cauterize the area; or put some blood-clotting powders over it.
Then return to your treatment until it is complete.
Then bind the wounded limb with a suitable ligament and care for it until it heals.
And I tell you that what happened to this man's foot also happened to me.
Because a blackness happened on his foot with a burn resembling that of fire; and the corruption began in his toe at first until it spread to his whole foot.
The man was in great pain, and when he saw the corruption attacking his limb with vehemence, he cut it off himself at the joint, and he was healed.
And after a long time had passed, the same corruption happened to him in his right index finger. He came to me and I tried to heal the ulcer with medicine after cleansing his body; but the ulcer didn't heal and spread to another finger until it reached his hand.
He called me to cut off his hand; and I didn'T want to do it hoping for the ulcer to heal; and I was also afraid of him dying from the cutting of his hand.Et quod accidit ei in pede, hoc accidit et in manu eius: et mortuus est a corruptione, quae abscissa non fuit.
Since it was a man's strength that was affected,
he returned to his own country; and he went in the strength of his hand; and he came to me, and fell on his knee. And I was moved with compassion for him, seeing him in such grief as he was; and when he had told me the cause why he was come, I said unto him, Go thy way, and do as thou hast said: but the child shall not live.
And I have not told you this for any sake but that ye may know how carefully we ought to inquire into these matters; and to show you a sign how it is done; and that you may act according to what has been said.
OF THE CURE OF FISTULAE, AND OF THE NATURE OF THE CLYSTER, WITH MEDICINES.
CHAPTER 90.
WHEN a fistula breaks out in any fleshy member, and the space of it is prolonged, until it makes a collection of pus: then it is broken, or pierced, and that which is within it comes out, and there remains a hollow place as if it were a wound: and the skin which is over it is like a cloth worn through: and it does not come to an end in its corruption, nor impresses upon any one of these members, but on the flesh only; it deserves to be called a Sinus: and it is not named a Fistula: howbeit if the space of it be prolonged, until it impresses upon the corrupt matter any one of these members, then it is named a Fistula.
AND the cure of it is, to cut away that skin altogether as it turns up: and especially when it is worn through, and made like a cloth: and you have confidence because it will not stick to the place, on account of its corruption.Et si est in membris carnosis, et non potest confideri quod non imprimat in os aut in neruam, cum incidiatur et totum in medio exuatur, et uenerit ad extremum, deinde in locum illum uter clisterem aetheris cum teriaca: sed postea uter eorum qui in fistulis habentur.
AND if it is in the fleshly members, and you cannot be confident that it will not impress upon the bone or nerve when it is cut through, and all is taken out of the middle of it, and it comes to an end; then use in that place a clyster of ether with theriac: but afterwards use one of those which are used for fistulas.AND if you think that the skin will adhere, and that it will not come to that last consequence of impression: and if there is thickness of flesh in the skin, then cure it as a Sinus.Et postea cum clisteri ex teriaca quibus usitari solet in fistulis.
Then if it is large and the pus that comes out of it has a foul odor, then prepare a mixture for an enema with Egyptian medicine—which is equal parts vinegar, oil, and ziniar—in a pot and boil it over fire until the medicine turns red, and let it come to the thickness of honey.
Then take as much of it as you need and dissolve it with water and honey, and inject it into the sinus, and close its opening, and let the medicine remain in it for two hours.
Then draw it out with a syringe; do this every day until the sinus is cleansed and the foul odor removed.
And when you do not have this medicine at hand, prepare an enema with ashes and water; take the ashes of burnt wood, or ashes from holm-oak wood, and pour boiling water over it.
Then strain it and inject it into the sinus until you are sure that the sinus has been thoroughly cleansed.
If the patient cannot tolerate either the Egyptian medicine or ashes and water, then prepare an enema with water and honey mixed with a little crushed ziniar.
Or inject the sinus with honey and wine mixed together, for it is a property of honey that it cleanses and washes away; and wine causes the sinus to contract, especially when there is an excess of stypticity and dryness in the wine.Et si facit sanguinem, quod non debet, aut pus, et non est mundificatur, tunc clisteriza cum melle et oleo.
As you do this several times and you are confident that the sinus corruption has now been removed, then cleanse the glans with what causes flesh to grow on it.
And it is as you take from the plaster dyafinicon: and dissolve it with rose oil, and astringent wine: or cleanse the glans with some medicines, and other ointments, whose properties I have written in the treatise of ointments.
If the orifice of the sinus is narrow, so that it does not take the cannula of the clyster: then widen it with a needle a little: or put on it linseed oil in ointment of Egypt, or in basilicon ointment, until it is widened.
And similarly if the orifice is also large, then unite its lips with a suture; and let out from it such a quantity into which the clyster may enter without addition.
And similarly if the orifice from which pus runs is elevated to the upper parts: then dry it in a more depressed place in it, so that pus may run out of it to the lower places; for when pus is constricted in the depth of the sinus, it hinders flesh from being generated in it.
If it is not possible for you to dry the sinus around its lower parts according to what you see: then strive to prepare the member by a preparation whereby pus may run out of it with ease according to how it is prepared for you.Et si non est possibile, neque secare Sinum secundum quod vis, neque praeparare membrum ut currat pus ex eo cum facilitate: tunc conare, ut conficias carnem in ipso per clisteria.
Examine it, so that nothing of the pus is retained in it at all; and receive the remedies which are laid upon the wound, in accordance with what you see.
And spread them on a linen cloth.
And let the cloth be of such size that it may touch all the sinus.
Then cut with a pair of forceps into the orifice of the sinus opening, a little more than the opening of the sinus.Et expande super foramen et intra sinum quae porridge-like sunt, et lina pannosa.
Then spread over the opening and into the sinus that which is porridge-like, and also the linen cloth; then spread on another cloth out of soothing ointments, according to the amount of the orifice: and place it in position far from the opening of the sinus, so that a way may be opened for the pus to exit from it; and do not take away the large cloth unless after some days one by one.
That which is over the orifice of the sinus, is that which you remove every hour, so that what gathers in it may exit from the pus; and so that you may know whether that which flows out of it is virulent, or not: or digested, or undigested.Et si uiris multum et indigestum est, et pus multum agglutinatur intra sinus: remoue igitur quod porridge-like est intra sinus et in orificio eius, ut antea diximus: et postea remouet pro parte quod parum est: sed si uiris multum et digestum: aut digeratur pus intra sinus.
And when you have done this again consider the place of the sinus itself, whether its master feels pain in it, or not; and whether there is an abscess in it, or not.Et si sentit dominus eius multum dolorem, et est in eo apostema: ponito super sinus unguentum, quod facit ut exeo: sed si non sentit dolorem in ipso, neque est in eo apostema, ponito super sinus unguentun, quod facit ut intra sit.
When then your treatment is extended thus far, and you see the matter which exits at the orifice of the sinus, then know that the sinus has already started to adhere, or is approaching adherence; then therefore open it in the morning, or on the third day: and when you open the wound, then change the cloth, and renew the ointment.Et si uides quod materia qua exuitur Sinus sit dura et crassa, et pus non est intra sinus, sed in orificio eius: ponito super orificium unguentun quod facit ut resoluatur: postea remoue pannum quod super orificium est, et remouet quae porridge-like sunt. If, however, a thin blood vessel breaks out from the wound after a long interval, you must not despair of its healing, for some men are slow to produce flesh in their wounds, while others do so quickly.
If however pus comes out of the wound after many days you may know that the wound is not healing properly.
If the healing of the wound is slow and prolonged then additional remedies should be used as well as poultices which are moist in themselves but dry in their effects, such as the ointment called diaphenicon, when a superfluity is added to it from an oil press.
And the best way of treating it is to take dyafenicon ointment and dissolve it with rose oil, and rub it over the old wine equally in its consistency.
Then mix it with the wine and use it.
And now he does the same thing when you do not have dyafenicon ointment at hand, take honey and cook it until it is thick, then use it.Et si in sinu quod curatur, non sit pus indigestus, sed sanguis uiridis:
Or take myrrh, and aloe, and frankincense; pound them all together, and powder them over honey while it is on the fire.Et si non habes myrrham, aloes aut olibanum, facias ex alio balsamo quolibet: et uteratur eo sicut praediximus.
Then line over the wound, and tie it over the sinus; and line with honey which you have cooked, until it is thickened; and strew over it spices, and put on the poultice, and tie it on.
And sometimes is administered in it long aristolochia, and roots of heavenly lily, and it is a lily: and flour of herb, and centaury.
Use these simples either separately, pound them, and sift them; and strew over the honey which I have mentioned, and use it.
If the sinus is prolonged and not healed by this treatment; then know that there is a corruption in its depth: either it now makes an impression on the bones, or on other hard members, or on ligaments; then cure it by the treatment of fistulas, according to what has been said before. Of the cure of panaria and nail torn, and cutting off the toe added, and slicing.
CHAPTER 91.
A panaria is an abscess which is born under the nail of the hand or foot; and perhaps it is born on other fingers.Et nascitur in loco, ubi sunt folia tenuissima, et per quae facillime perveniunt ad cor: et multum movet homines per timore mortis, et praesens dolorem, et morbum insidiosum, et pestilentem: quoniam multum laborant cum eo.
When therefore the matter of it is prolonged, and neglected to be cured, and it is abscessed with a hot abscess; or it is corrupted, and emits pus, until it corrodes the root of the nail: and perhaps it corrupts all of it, and perhaps corruption extends to bone, until there is a foul odor to it: and the end of the finger becomes broad, and its color becomes dusky.Et si non curatur opportuniter post ea quae praemissi sunt, et si exequitur res eius, et corrumperit totum unguem cum digito: et forte peruenit corruptio ad os, usque ad ossa pedis vel manu, donec est ei odor foetidus, et emittit pus multum, et periculum mortis prope est: et si quae res corrumperit totam manum, aut totum pedem.
When you are treating it with the means I have described above and your treatment does not take effect, then you should cut away all the dead tissue that remains around the nail with a knife.
Then cauterize the wound afterwards.
The cautery is very effective against it.
If however the bone is healthy and the nail is also healthy, but the nail-bed is swollen with pus and begins to press on the surrounding flesh and hurt it, then you should push up the nail bed from underneath its root, and cut away the affected flesh easily and put over it one of the burning medicines that will consume all that remains.
Then treat the wound with ointment until it heals.
If however the infection has already affected the bone, then you must cut out the diseased bone; for it will never heal as long as the disease remains within it.
If you see that the rot and corruption are spreading to the finger then cut off this finger at its first joint according to what has been said previously.
Then treat it until it heals.Si uero non potest tolerare ut incidas eum, sed putas quod curatur cum medicinis: tunc oportet ut ponas super illud ex medicasibus uiridis oleribus et frugibus, et facias super eam moxam, et facias eam suare, et deinde cura illam cum medicis uiridis.
If however you cannot cut off the nail but think that it will be cured by remedies then you should put on it drugs made from green vegetables and fruit; and apply a poultice to it and let it sweat and then treat this with green remedies. If however the nail is injured by friction or impact, and there is extreme pain in it, then phlebotomy must be applied to the patient in the first instance.
Then cut the nail with a sharp knife across from above to below.
And be careful not to cut through into the flesh underneath the nail because you will make the pain worse and cause a wound in that place.
Then treat the wound with that which will soothe the pain.
However, a finger that is born in the hands of some men may be all fleshy; and there may be bones in some of them, and a nail may be present in it; and some are born at the root of the joint, or their origin is at some joints of the finger.
So he who is born at some joints of the finger does not move; and he who is born near the joint of the finger may move.
Therefore, for him who is fleshy, his dissection is easy.
That is, so that you may cut it at its root with a wide chisel.
However, the treatment of him whose origin is at the root of the joint is difficult.Igitur ut curas eum qui in quibusdam manibus nascitur et qui totus est os: incidas primum locum quod carnosus est cum Spatumili lato et cum scalpele sublato.
So that you may cure him who is born in the hands and who is all bone: cut first the place which is fleshy with a wide chisel and with a sharp blade underneath. So refrain from cutting it.
But as for him who is born at the last joint of the finger, then you ought to cut first the flesh with a round incision up to the bone.
Then saw the bone with one of those saws that fit into it.Et quoniam non potest fieri ut serratio omnium ossium sint in uno, sed potest fieri ut serratio quosdam ossium sit in uno et serratio alios in alio, ergo debes curare locum illum cum eo quod sedat dolores.
And since it is not possible that the sawing of all bones should be into one, but it can happen that the sawing of some bones into one and the sawing of others into another, then you ought to treat that place with that which soothes pain. Then cure it until it is healed.
However, the consolidation that occurs to fingers next to each other happens often either from the origin of man, that is, it is born with him, or from the consolidation of a wound, or burning by fire, and the like.Cum ergo consolidaur digitus cum digito: si consolidaur secundarius cum proximis: incidas primum carnem cum Spatumili et scalpele sublato et sedes os cum una illarum Serrarum conuenientium ad illud usque ad quod sit solidum.
It is necessary therefore that you leave that bandage in place until the fingers return to their natural shape.
Then put a layer of linen or rags soaked in rose oil between them so that they do not adhere too quickly, and separate them from one another; or put between them a thin sheet of lead until the area is healed as it should be.
And likewise if consolidation occurs to some of the fingers with the palm, then dry that consolidation according to the way it is prepared and convenient to the shape of the limb.
Of cutting: The defect.
Chapter 92.
Veins are enveloped, thick, full of black bile, which happens in many parts of the body, and most often the result is in the legs, especially in the legs of those who walk and work, and carry loads.
It is therefore necessary to administer a strong shaking of the body from black bile quite often.
Then bleed the patient in those places.
The treatment of them however is according to two methods.Utrari autem debet in capite et in pedibus, et inter crura et lumbos, in locis non propositis ad excussionem: sed ad sanguinis uel melancholicis superfluitatem: et oportet eum locum utrinque scissuram fieri in medio.
One of them is so that they are sewn up and the black blood extracted.
And another mode is, that the vein should be cut, and all of it extracted.
The section of it, however, is in this manner.
Moisten the leg first with warm water until the viscous blood is liquefied.Primum igitur incide uterque lateribus cruris vna manu sustinentem, et ostende locum ubi uena apparet magna, et clara, et si qua parte compressa est, non apparet.
Then squeeze the leg of the patient from the upper part of his hip to the lower part of his knee with your hand.Postea ineaue uenas quae apparuerunt cum spathulis aures uel lamnis, et eleue uterque latus cruris, donec sanguis cadaverinus per uenas omnes fluat.
Then cut the vein in one place or two or three wide incisions.Postea fac ut eleuatur tota in uas, et si non eleuat, extrahatis aures uenas, et secatis eadem, donec eleuat sanguis cadaverinus.
Then cut the nail down to the bone until you see a quantity of blood has come out that the strength of the patient can tolerate.Postea, cum sanguis cadaverinus eruit, eleuatur, aut extrahatur cruor niger.
Then ligate it and tell him to abstain from food that produces black bile and repeat the evacuation and phlebotomy when the veins are full again and it is harmful to the patient.
And its evacuation is in this manner.Postea fac ut eleuatur cruor niger et sanguis cadaverinus per uenas per omnes, donec omnes uenas apparentes eleuantur, et tamen non omnes cum ullo dubio.
Shave the leg of the patient if there are many hairs on it.Postea fac ut sanguis cadaverinus per uenas omnes fluat: sed ne facias eleuatur omni parte cruris superius, aut inferius, donec sanguinem cadaverinum eleuat, vel extrahatis aures uenas, et secatis eadem.
Then cause the black blood and cadaverous blood to flow through all the veins until all the veins that appeared are evacuated; but do not cause all of them to be evacuated with any doubt.Then have him enter a bath or soak his leg in hot water until it turns red and the veins swell up, or exercise vigorously if there is no bath available until the limb grows warm.Eleuatio uero eius est, ut secentur, et extrahatur sanguis niger, et eleuat cruor.
Then dry the skin with a sharp incision along its length: either at its lower end near the knee or in its lower part near the heel.
Then open the skin with hooks and scrape away all of the flesh from the vein until it appears before you, and you will see that it is reddish and sloping toward black.
When therefore it comes out of the skin, you will see that it is white like a cord.
Then insert underneath it a rod until when it is lifted and comes out of the skin: hold it with a blind hook, gently.
Then dry another incision near that incision by three fingers.
Then scrape the skin from the upper part of the vein until it appears.
Then lift it with rods as you did before, and hold it with another hook as you did at first.
Then dry another incision, or several incisions if you need to.
Then lift and cut it at its last incision near the heel.
Then pull it out to the incision which is above it.
And do this until you have pulled it out of the incision which is above, or from higher up in the incisions, until it all comes out: then cut it.
If however it does not obey you in being pulled out and lifted up: then insert a strong needle with thread, and tie it, and pull it out; or insert a rod under it, and roll your hand over every part until it comes out.
And be careful that it not be cut.
For if it is cut, it becomes very difficult to lift it up and there enters upon the invalid much harm from it.
When therefore you have pulled it out entirely, then place over the wound wool saturated with wine and rose-oil, or oil; and care for it until it is healed.
If the vein is contracted and has tortuosity where there is swelling to its parts and not as we have said according to rectitude: then it behooves you to find over it at every part of its tortuosity and the places of its swelling.
Then suspend it with hooks until you have loosened the whole thing: and be careful at your incision over her not to cut the vein or wound her: for it will be difficult for you to loosen it or pull it out.
So maintain your prudence.
Form of the Incident by which the Vine is Healed.
Form of the Blind Hook.
There is not in it any curve as there is in the other hooks, nor is its end acute so that it may not wound the vein; and it is of a great flexibility, tender: for if it were subtle, by its subtlety it would enter into the vein; nay, let there be an excess of grossness in it, as we have said.
Of the Extraction of the Vein of the Thigh. CHAPTER XCI.
This vein is engendered in the thighs in hot countries, as in Arabia and the desert land; and in arid, hot, countries, where there is little tenderness, that is to say, in which no grass nor tree springs up.Antiquus enim disces Vnam cruris non est sicut Vna bracis: et quare sic?
For the old man will tell you that the vein of the thigh is not as the vein of the arm; and why is that?And perchance it is engendered in other parts of the body than the thighs.
And its generation indeed is from putrefaction which occurs under the skin, just as occurs inside bodies of snakes and roundworms, and worms generated between skin and flesh.
And the sign of the beginning of this event is that there is a violent inflammation in the leg.
Then the place swells.
Then the vein begins to come out of that swollen place, as if it were a root of a plant or an animal.Et si non potest euentus huius ueniri per cutem carnemque ad cutem, quomodo possit fieri per Venas?
And if the event of this cannot come through the skin and flesh to the skin, how can it happen through veins? When therefore its end appears from that, then you ought to wrap above it a remnant of lead whose weight is from a drachma to two drachmas, and tie the knot: and leave the lead hanging from the leg.
Whenever therefore something goes out from that to the outside, wrap it in the lead, and tie that.Et si quid in eo generatur uel crescit, quod non possit per cutem carnemque ad cutem uenire, eadem facias et in plumbo: sed quando quaeris de ea, intra uterum, quomodo potest fieri?
And if something is generated or grows in it that cannot come through the skin and flesh to the skin, do the same thing with the lead also: but when you seek its end, inside the belly, how can that be? If it is prolonged far, then cut off a part of it, and wrap the remnant.
And do not cut the root before it goes out completely.Et postea quando recidit ad interiora, de ea quaeris intra uterum.
And after that when it returns to the inside, seek its end inside the belly. For if you cut it, it is drawn back into the flesh, and makes abscesses, and putrefaction in the place, and a bad ulcer.Et quomodo potest recidere ad interiora?
Therefore it must be treated gently and extracted slowly until it comes out of its end, and nothing remains in the body; and from this vein indeed exits in some men what is as long as five palms and ten.
And now it has come to me that a man exited at 20 palms.
But if you come upon it during your hour of medication, then insert a rod into its foramen and pierce it with the foramen longwise, with the body, until all that is in it is evacuated from matter: and apply putrefaction to the place with remedies over several days. Then treat it with the treatment of apostemas.
And this vein indeed has many branches sometimes, especially when it appears in the junction of the foot, or in the foot itself: and openings happen to it often, and a branch exits out of every opening.
Therefore treat it as we have said in the division, and with that which is before.
§ Of the section above on Worms generated under the skin, and is called Ox disease.
Chapter 94.
This disease is called in a certain land among us Ox disease: because it often happens to oxen, and it is a small worm that is born between the skin and the flesh.Et multum differt a vermibus quos loquimur antea.
And it differs greatly from the worms of which we spoke before. And it goes through the whole body, going up and down: and it is made manifest to the sense at its walking from limb to limb, until it breaks where it breaks a spot in the skin, and exits.Et ego loquutus sum de ea apud medicos Christianos inter nos, et non habuerunt scientiam de cura eius.
And I have spoken about it among Christian physicians among us, and they did not have knowledge of its cure. And its generation is from the putrefaction of certain humors.Et quaecunque in corpore sunt humora putrida, quae non ueniunt ad perfectionem, et non accipiunt terminos, generant hanc Aegritudinem: nam quandoque, si accipiant terminos, non generant hanc Aegritudinem.
As happen worms and serpents, that is, roundworms, and tapeworms in the belly.
And it is feared from its wickedness.
Because when he crawls into the body and is lifted up to the head and reaches the eye, then perhaps it opens there and goes out and destroys the eye, and that happens often.
When therefore you wish to cure him and extract it, then it is not done except by his walking about and the appearance of it to the sense.
It is necessary then that you tighten what is above him and what is under him with a strong constricting bandage.Et si non possit extrahere eum, sed uelut in carne ipse remanserit, tunc facias ad eum incisionem cum scalpelio, et extrahas eum per illam.
Then dry it and draw it out.
If it is deep in the flesh and you do not find it, then put a cautery over the spot with fire until it dies.
And what is feared most is its corruption, which corrupts the eye, as we have said. But if you see it already penetrating the head near the eye, then tighten under it the eyebrow with a good ligature.
Then dry it over and pull it out.
And the sick person should use cleansing of his body with medicines dissolving the putrid bad humors.
And he must beware of foods generating putrefaction.
¶ On cutting for the disease of Nakir.
Chapter 95.De sectione super aegritudinem quae dicitur Atrahit.
This disease is called nakir in our country; it is a pain that attacks certain parts of the body and then shifts from one part to another.
And indeed I have seen this myself, as I tell you now.
I was called to a sick woman in some villages.
She raised her arm, and I saw a slight swelling in the vein of the arm.
And after we stayed for one hour, I saw a swelling moving with heat, as if it were a worm, going up to her shoulder more quickly than it could be; as though it were living silver when it runs from place to place.
The pain therefore left that place and settled on the shoulder.Et uidi eandem inflationem adduxisse ad mediam uenam brachii, ut uides in quodlibet ramum uenae.
Then I sat for one hour and it ran through the rest of her body until it reached another arm.Et uidi eam, cum quae in ea erant inflationes, cum magna uiride uenere, uenire ad mediam uenem brachii: et ab illo loco per omnes uenas brachii, donec superauerit ad contrarium brachium, sicut si uenus pergeret.
And I saw the swelling with a green colour coming to the middle vein of the arm, as you see in any branch of a vein; and from that place it ran through all the veins of the arm until it went up into the other arm on the opposite side, as if blood were running through.Then she told me how it was revolving throughout her whole body, according as I saw.
I was therefore astonished at the swiftness of its shifting from part to part.Et postea per omnes partes corporis inuidit, donec perueniret in caput eius.
And afterwards it ran through all the parts of her body until it reached her head; and indeed before that I had not seen this disease with my eyes in such a way.
Nevertheless, I have seen many who find their pain shifting from part to part; and not with my eyes as I saw it in the woman.Et multos quoque uidi, qui per omnes partes corporis habuerunt dolorem fixum, et non permutatum de membro ad membrum: sed multoties in uno et eodem loco fixum.
And I have also seen many who had pain fixed in one and the same part, not shifting from part to part but fixed often times in the same place; and I do not think that is because of anything except that the woman was of those whose bodies are dry and have detected veins; hence there appears to me to be a cause for the permutating heat.
And it is necessary that they not appear according to this manner in those who are delicate, and have moist bodies, hidden veins.
When therefore you see the cure of it, and feel the patient that pain; then if it is appearing to you by the eye as we have said, then tightly press upon it, both above and below quickly; and cut above it, until that confined wind comes out: and cauterize the place.
If you don't see it with your eyes however: then cure it with shaking of the body, and with that which expels windiness, and causes them to pass out with foul pills, and pills of serapium, and similar.
¶ On the Extraction of Arrows.Et si in corpori apparuerit tibi locum ubi sagitta sedet: et non possis eicere e corpore sagittam nisi per mortem uel excisionem carnis, et ossium: non debes dubitare de excisione carnis et ossium ut extrahas sagitta.
Chapter 96.Et teneat te quod diximus circa curam sagittarum quae in corpora ueniunt per parum apertum: nam si non possit eicere sagitta nisi cum magno aperitu carnis et ossium: neque debes dubitare de faciendo illo aperitu, et excisione carnis et ossium circa locum ubi sagitta sedet. Arrows differ according to their kinds, and according to the places in which they fall out of the body.Quemadmodum enim multas habemus corporis carnes quae uelut corporis ossium, ita etiam multas carnes habemus extra corporis ossium.
For just as we have many meats of the body which are like the bones of the body, so too do we have many meats outside of the bones of the body.And their difference is this: for some of them have large points, and small; hollow and blunt.Et sunt quae habent cuspides magnos, et parvos: et concauas, et surdas.
And there are some which have three angles.Et alicuius eorum cuspides sunt flexi, et alicuius recti.
And of some of them the points are bent, and of some straight.And of some there is a tongue.Et quae habent linguam: ea est multo peior quomodo si non possit extrahere cum linguo: sed debes excidere linguam cum scissura ut uadat sanguis intra carnem et ossia, donec egrediatur sagitta cum eo.
And of those which have stars.And of those which have stars: that is much worse if it cannot be extracted with the star; but you must cut off the star with a slit so that blood flows inside the flesh and swells, until the arrow comes out with it.And of those which are broad-headed.
But those who are wounded in their limbs fall in two ways.
Either because the limbs are concave from their principal parts, such as the brain and heart and liver and lungs and kidneys and intestines and bladder and similar things.
Now when a person falls into any of these limbs, and you see the signs of death that I describe to you after, then it behooves that you extract the arrow from them; for death will follow, if you leave it where it is, in many dispositions.
And when these bad signs do not appear, and the arrow is not hidden deep in the limb, then extract it and treat the wound.
For when an arrow falls into the brain and penetrates the bone and goes out through the membrane which is above the brain, there follow: violent vomiting, and scotomia, and vertigo, and redness in the eyes, and swelling, and redness of the tongue, and spasms, and confusion of the intellect, and vomiting of cholera.
And perhaps blood flows out from the nose or ears.Quod ergo cadit in cor et penetrat, et egreditur, tunc accidunt: soda uemens, et inflatio magna, et spasmum, et rubedo faciei, et uomitus cholerae, et permixtio uocis, et dextro lateri adhaerens.
And perhaps speech is cut off and the voice destroyed.
And white moisture like pus will flow from the wound.
And a fluid like blood flows out of it.
If therefore these signs appear to you, then refrain from treatment and withdraw the arrow if it does not come out.
The signs of an arrow which has hit the heart are that it is close to the left breast; and he feels with it as if it were fixed in a hard object, not in a hollow one.
And perhaps there is a movement like the movement of the pulse; and black blood flows out of the wound.
And then there follows chillness of the extremities, cold sweat, and fainting.
Therefore know that death is at hand beyond doubt.
And the sign of an arrow which has wounded the lung is the issue of frothy blood from the wound; and then there is puffing up behind the neck, and change of colour in the patient.
And he gasps for breath, deeply and heavily; and seeks cold air.
If an arrow has fallen into the breast-bone, then it is near the little ribs; and there is a great panting with violent pain, with sighing; and all the limbs of the shoulder are moved.Et fit uociferus gemitus et uox altior: et exuit se vestem superuestem, et apparet cor sub cutibus albis similis uiride, et apparet pulsus magnus: et movet omnia corporis membra in uaria uaria.
And if an arrow has fallen into the stomach, then perhaps something indigestible flows out of the wound.Et fit nausia et vomitus: et saepe est doloris uarietatis et pulsu in omni corporis parte: et apparet cor sub cutibus albis qualiterque viride, et pulsat magnopere.
And if an arrow has fallen into the belly, and is fixed in it; something of faeces flows out of the wound, or dung, or intestine which has already been severed.Et fit dolus vehemens et pulsus magnus: et saepe est uomitus et nausia: et apparet cor qualiterque viride sub cutibus albis.
There is therefore no hope of cure for him, nor any hope of extracting the arrow.
If an arrow falls into the bladder and urine flows out of it, and something comes out to the outside, and the pain is stronger over the weak person, then you will know that it is mortal.
The other limbs, as the face, and neck, and throat, and shoulder blade, and aide, and dorsal vertebrae, and collar bone, and hip, and thigh, and similar limbs to these are treated according to several dispositions: when the arrow does not find an artery or nerve, and is not a poisonous arrow.
And I will tell you that I have seen of these arrows, so that you may know through it about your cure.
What happened is that a man had an arrow fall into the tear duct of his eye, at the root of the nose.
I therefore extracted it for him from the other side, under the fat of his ear; and he was healed, and no harm came to his eye.
And I extracted another arrow from a Jew, which had fallen into the fat of his eye under the lower eyelid: and the arrow was already hidden, and I did not obtain from it except its small end, with which it adhered to its wood; and it was a great arrow of the arrows of Turkish bows, with a smooth iron, in which there are no ears.
The Jew was therefore healed, and no harmful accident occurred in his eye. And I extracted another arrow from the throat of a Christian.
And it was an Arabic arrow, and that is one which has ears.
I therefore cut on it between the two guides; and it was already submerged in his throat.Exstraxi ergo sagittam cum illa quae adhaeret in ligno eius, et sanatus est.
I cured him therefore by means of it until I extracted it; and the Christian was restored to health.
And I extracted another arrow out of a man which had fallen into his belly; and we thought that he would die from it.
After the man had fasted for thirty days without any change in his condition, I probed the wound of the arrow and made an incision over it, and extracted the arrow; he recovered and no harm befell him.
I saw a man to whom an arrow had fallen into his back and the wound was healed over it.
After he had been seven years, the arrow came out of its root by the hip of the man.
And I saw a woman to whom an arrow had fallen into her belly, and the wound was healed over it, and the arrow remained inside of her; and nothing changed about her in any of her natural functions, and the woman found no harm in any of her activities.Et extraxi sagittam de uentre mulieris: et sanata est mulier, et remansit eius in vita.
And I saw another man to whom an arrow had pierced the face; and the wound was healed, and remained, causing him little pain; and many such cases.
And I drew out an arrow from a chief of the King's, which had pierced through his nose and was inclined a little on the right side; and all the arrow was hidden.
I was therefore called to heal him three days after the arrow had fallen upon him.
I found the wound of the arrow very tight.Et scissum in medio, quod quasi tamen non essent duae partes.
And I felt it not; and he indeed perceived the pricking and pain under his ear on the right side.Et scisum uiuum, et iustissimum sensit.
And so he wondered why this piercing was at the tip of the arrow.
I therefore applied a plaster to the spot where the arrow had entered, with an attractive and digestive plaster, trusting that the wound would heal and I would see the track of the arrow so that I could cut it out. But in this accident there was no sign indicating that the arrow had struck the spot.
I therefore applied the plaster over him for many days; and no accident happened, and in the meantime the wound healed up, and he remained weak from the extraction of it for a space of days, until one day he felt the arrow inside his nose.
And he told me about it.
I therefore applied an acute and corrosive medicine over the wound for many days, until it was opened up; and I probed it with a probe, and felt the tip of the arrow which had adhered to the wood.
Then I increased the opening of the wound by that acute medicine, until the tip of the arrow appeared to us visibly; and it was about four months before I could get it out.Emplastriui ergo extremitatem sagittae ut extraherem: sed non potui peruersum illum trahere.
I then tried to pull out the tip of the arrow but could not. So when the wound was enlarged and I could insert forceps into it and move it, but it did not come out easily, I continued probing and working on it with various clever methods until one day I began using specially-made forceps, according to their shape at the end of the handle, and extracted it.
Then I restored the wound.
And the physicians indeed judge that cartilage of the nose does not restore itself.Speraui ergo, quod erat illa punctio ex extremitate sagittae.
I therefore wondered whether that piercing had been at the tip of the arrow.I then restored the wound; and it healed up, and he was cured of his weakness with a whole health; and nothing harmed him at all.
And I tell you about the quality of extraction of certain arrows; so that you might put that in your book and understand it.
Since the parts of this art and their distinctions are not contained in the description, nor does that book contain them, and a prudent artist compares little with much, and what is near with what is far off, and finds a new operation, and a new instrument when things foreign to this art happen to come down.
I say therefore that arrows do not go out of the members in which they are fixed except according to two modes. Or by attraction from the place into which it entered.
Or by repulsion from the other part.Et istae duae cause non faciunt, nisi cum illius partes sint flexibiliter tenues et in se receptaculum habeant ad traxendo sagitтам.
And these two causes do not act unless the parts of it are flexibly thin and have a receptacle within them to draw out the arrow. And that which goes out from where it entered is either an arrow proceeding in a fleshy place, and it is drawn out and goes out.Et quae procedit contra partem alteram per repulsionem sagittae ex ea parte quae est contra illum locum ad traxendam sagitvam cum parte sua tenui et plana intrauit: sicut sagitta procedit contra partem coracis, et illa pars traxit eam ad se per attractionem in partem planam et tenuem.
If it does not exit within the hour of its fall, then you must leave it alone for a few days, until the flesh that is around it decays and putrefies; and so you shall loosen its traction and its exit.
And likewise, if it is stuck in the bone and does not submit to you to exit, then leave it also for a few days; and work it with traction and movement every day, until it exits.
If it does not submit to you to exit after days, then you must bore around the arrow tip in the bone from every side with a thin drill, until you make room for the arrow to move.
Then pull on it and extract it.
But if the arrow is fixed in the bone of the head, and has already made its way into one of the ventricles of the brain, and some of those illnesses which I said appear from it, then abstain from pulling on the arrow, and leave it alone until it equalizes after days.Et si post dies non aequat, sed magis per se efficiatur, et praeteriit diem quintam: tunc ad traktionem eius iterum redire libenter debes.
If an arrow has pierced up to the bone, then death is not prolonged for him.
And if the arrow is not fixed, unless in the body of bone only, and does not penetrate up to the bone: and remains infirm for several days, and nothing happens to him from those accidents: then apply remedies to the attraction of the arrow and its extraction.
But if it is very fixed, and does not obey you to attraction; then apply terebinthine ointment around the arrow, as I have told you before: then care for the wound, until it is healed.Si tamen virescit et non obedit ad extractiones sagittae, et non habet tibi pacem: tunc incide locum super sagitta cum scalpele: et extrahe eum cum sagitta.
But if he grows strong and does not obey the extraction of the arrow, and does not give you rest; then cut into the place above the arrow with a scalpel: and pull it out with the arrow. But if the arrow is already hidden in the body, and concealed and hidden from sense; then seek it with a probe.
But if you feel it, then pull it out with some instruments that are convenient for its attraction.Sed si non potes aliter extrahere sagittae, sed peribit omnino: incide locum cum scalpele et extrahe illuc ossa ex corpori, et sagitta sequitur ossem.
But if you cannot otherwise pull out the arrow, but it will perish altogether: cut into the place with a scalpel and pull out the bones from the body there, and the arrow will follow the bone. But if you cannot do so because of the constriction of the wound, and because of the length of the arrow in the depth: and there is no bone, or nerve, or vein there; then make a slit over it until the wound is enlarged, and it is possible to pull out the arrow.Sed si non potes extrahere sagittae propter constrictionem uulneris, et propter os quod superest in profundo: tunc finde super eam locum, donec amplificetur uulnus, et peribit constrictio, et possit aliter extrahi.
If they are ears by which he is being held, then free the flesh fixed in them from every part, by all means that you can, and force it, if it cannot be freed above the flesh in the fracture of the ears, and their twisting, until it is freed.
And when you administer the extraction of an arrow, wherever it is, then use the twisting of your hand, with tweezers to all parts, until you make it come out: and apply the most subtle subtlety, so that the arrow does not break, and the drawing of it, and its extraction become difficult for you.
If you cannot draw it out within one hour, then leave it for several days, until those things that are around it putrefy.Et scias quod si in capite vel alibi in corpore est, et non potest extrahi, quia ossa contortione et fractura faciunt eam profundiorem intrare, quae cum sanguine putrescunt, quod mortis periculum facit: quod si mortuo extraxeris, et vivus fuisset, sic se salvum esse non debet: sed in capite vel alibi in corpore est, et non potest extrahi, quia ossa contortione et fractura faciunt eam profundiorem intrare, quae cum sanguine putrescunt, quod mortis periculum facit: quod si mortuo extraxeris, et vivus fuisset, sic se salvum esse non debet.
Then repeat it again; for the wound will become soft. But if you meet with resistance from a flow of blood, then administer what we said in the cure in its chapter: and watch out for your strength in cutting a vein or nerve or sinew.
And administer skill in every way that it is possible for you to extract the arrow; and let it be with ease, or slowness, or firmness, as I narrated to you.Et quidam dicunt: Si Sagitta est in capite uel alibi, et non potest extrahi, sed ex qua parte intrare uولت, uerso capite eandem rem facito, donec eam extraxeris.
And it is necessary that when you draw out an arrow that the wound be according to its shape as it was with the arrow in itself at the time of the accident.
Because it is more of a cure.
But if you are not able to do that, then administer what you can according to the figures.
But if the arrow comes out from the opposite part or already comes out of it something to the outside: or makes a lump the end of the arrow through feeling from the upper part of the skin near, and you see that it stands out: therefore cut on it, and let the section be according to the quantity which fit in it the forceps.
Then pull it out: for the arrow is made easy to come out.
But if it is held by a bone, then turn your hand according to its roundness, until the arrow presses on the bone and makes itself wider: then pull it out.
And if not, leave it for several days; then repeat it again, until it comes out.
If the wood of the arrow is in it, then push it with it.
But if the wood has fallen off and you wish to administer a push: then put into it a hollow instrument, so that it enters its hollow into the tail of the arrow; then push it with it.
But if the arrow is hollow, then push it with an instrument entering into it.Si uero Sagitta quae cecidit inter costras est: et non possis illius intrare locum ad administrationem: tunc extrahe eam cum trabe.
But if the arrow that has fallen is between the ribs: and you cannot reach its place for an operation: then pull it out with a bar.For the arrow is relieved by it.
But if the arrow is poisoned, then you ought to hollow out the whole flesh in which the poison is, if it is possible for you to do so.Quod si Sagitta est in capite ossis, et non possis illam extrahere: sed per sensum uideas eam intrare carnem, tunc fac ut concaues carnem circa eam, et oportet, ut trahas Sagittae, nec omnes similes.
Then treat it with what is convenient for that.
If the arrow is falling into the chest, or the belly, or the bladder, or the side; and it is close to that which you touch with the probe, and it is possible for you to cut over it: then cut, and beware of cutting a vein, or nerve, and extract it.
Then sew up the wound, if you see fit, and treat it until it heals.
And this is the shape of the forceps with which arrows are extracted.
Let its ends be like a bird's beak, which are made like an iron: when they seize upon the arrow, they do not let go.
And there are made of them many forms, great and small, and medium, according to the quantity of the magnitude of the arrow, and smallness of it, and width of the wound, and its constriction.
Form of the concave-tipped probe.
And form of the blunt-tipped probe.De Impellenti secando Sagitta in uentre aut in pectore, vel in uesica, et non possunt extrahere eam.
This is the blunt end as a file, so that its entrance may be lessened in the concave arrow, and it is pushed with it.De forma tentarum.
Of the form of the probes.This end of the concave-tipped probe is hollow like a bird feather, so that its entrance may be lessened into the arrow and its thrust.De forma tentarum.
Of the form of the probes.Of phlebotomy of veins.Si uides, quod Sagitta cadens in corpora omnia, uel ex parte qua libet, fiunt postea venae: et non possunt extirpare eam: tunc incide super eam, et sue uulnus.
Chapter 97. There are thirty veins to be opened with a venesection needle, whose custom has been established in the body.
Of these, there are sixteen in the head: two pulsating veins, which are behind the ears, called the Two Herbs; and two arteries, which are apparent in the two temples; and two veins which are in the two tear ducts of the two eyes, which are called the Gazers; and a vein prepared in the middle of the forehead; and a vein which is in the extremity of the nose.
And two Girdles, which are in the neck.
And two veins which are in the upper lip of the mouth.Et duae uenae quae sunt sub lingua: et alii quidam vocant tres uenas, quae sunt in laringe.
And two veins that are in the lower lip.
And these are the veins which are called the Algecherich.
And two veins which are under the tongue.
The veins that are bled in the arm, there are five in each arm.
One of them is the Cephalica, and it is on the side of the little finger: and this vein the common people call the vein of the head.
And the Dark one.
And it is the Middle vein, and it is composed from the Basilic branch, and the branch of the Cephalica: and the common people call this the vein of the body.
And the Basilic, which is placed on the side of the thumb: and it is also called the Tickler.Et Uona, et est posita inter Fuscam et Media, et nominat eam uulgus uenam maxillae.
And the Fifth, which is placed between the Dark and the Middle: and this is called by the people the vein of the jaw.And it is also called the vein of the stomach.
And the Cord of the arm, and it is placed above the elbow: and this is the one in which you bleed; and it is the one that appears above the wrist with a manifest appearance.
And the Salvadora: and it is the vein between the ring finger and the little finger; and there are two branches from it.Et Titillaris, et est posita in latere syluestri, et est illa quae apparet inter indicem et majus.
There are three veins in both the thigh and the leg.
One of them is situated below the bend of the little finger on the left hand side.
And the second is the saphenous vein; its location is near the heel, on the right side.
And the third is the popliteal vein, and its location is behind the knee on the left.Et haec uenae tres trahuntur ad uenam maiorem in genu.
And these three veins are drawn to the great vein in the knee. And in the other thigh there are also three veins like them.
¶ Of bleeding from two veins behind the ears.Et de uena quae est sub oculo et uenula quae eiusdem locis trahitur: qui locus est sub angulo oculi inter nasum et oculum, ubi fluit sanguis post oculum si ulla contusio super oculum sit.
However, bleeding from the two veins that are behind the ears is good for old catarrh and migraine, and for bad scurvy and old ulcers of the head.
And the quality of the bloodletting is according to what I will narrate.Phlebotomiae uero earum ad caput dolens, et ad ulcera quae sunt in lumine, et ad humores qui ex uulvibus faciuntur, et ad quoddam vertigo, et ad uisum tenebrosum, et ad lampas et lachrymas.
And they are good for a headache, and for ulcers in the eye, and for humors which come from sores, and for a certain dizziness, and for dim vision, and for pain and tears. And the patient's head is to be shaved, and his occiput rubbed in the place of the two veins with a rough cloth with good rubbing.Et si uenae earum sint ad uulvum, radatur eque loco; et fricetur cum panno aspero.
Then the patient must tighten his neck with a bandage until the two veins appear.Et quando apparuerint, tunc capiat infirmus uina uino temperata: et siccare debet collum eius cum uino et cum aqua, donec cadant uenae.
And when they appear, the patient must take wine tempered with water, and his neck must be dried with wine and water until the veins sink down. And the places of these veins are behind the ears in two sunken places of the head.Et de uenula quae est sub oculo et de uena quae in ala oculi est: phlebotomia eorum est ad ulcera capitis mala et ad sahafati, et ad dolores qui sunt circa oculum.
And as for the veinlet that is under the eye and the vein that is at the side of the eye: bleeding from these is good for bad ulcers of the head, and scurvy, and pains which are around the eye. Therefore seek them with your finger, and when you feel their pulsation underneath your finger, mark them there with a cautery.Et de uena quae est sub pollicis curuatura ex latere syluestri: phlebotomia eius est ad hemigraneam.
Then take a scalpel and it is that which is called the Incision blade.
Then insert the scalpel under the vein in the cut, until the bleed-pipe reaches the mouth.
Then lift your hand with the vein and skin towards the upper, and cut the vein with the cutting blade.
And let the length of the incision be the amount of two joined fingers, or around that: and make to come out of blood as much as you see.
Then compress it with poultices, and leave it, until it heals.And know that the place of this phlebotomy is in the left arm near the armpit over the vein which is called the Vein of the Arm.
And now it has preceded in the beginning of the book the incision of these and their cauterization.And know that there are six places for phlebotomy which are not in the members:
Of phlebotomy of the two arteries in the temples.¶ Phlebotomia oculi.
The phlebotomy of the two arteries which are in the two temples is for ancient migraine: and bad breath, and persistent pain of the eye: and flow of acute effusions to the eyes.Phlebotomia uel in oculis. And the quality of phlebotomying them is according to what I narrate to you.Of the phlebotomy of the eye: It is that you make a cut in the white of the eye with an incision blade, and make to come out of it blood as much as you see, then compress upon it with a poultice until it heals.
Let the weak neck of his much, until two veins appear to the sense in a manifest appearance: and it is demonstrated pulse of them under your finger.And know that these are the places of cauterization from which you should not go far, for fear that it may reach the brain and cause death.And know that there is no cautery unless with fire, except only in four places of the body, they are:
Then indeed signs with encaustic.Of cauterization of the two temples: It is that you cauterize them when you see a vein apparent and a pulse under your finger.Cauterisatio uel in oculis.
Then lift the skin above the vein towards the upper with your index finger, and insert the incision blade from under it, and lift the vein towards the upper.And know that you should not cauterize between two bones.Of cauterization in the eye: It is that you cauterize the white of it.
And cut it as you did in two other veins: and make to run from blood according to the quantity of your necessity.And know that cauterization is for flow of acute effusions which are to the eye, and for pain of the eye which is persistent.Of cauterization of the nose: It is that you cauterize it when the pulse is apparent under your finger.Of cauterization in the ear. Then loosen the bandage of the patient and put your finger on the vein for one hour.
Then put over it a bandage and fine lint, and tighten it strongly from above with a tight bandage; and leave it until he is healed.
And now I will give a summary of these matters, and their incision and extraction, at the beginning of this book.
Of bleeding the vein on the forehead after bleeding in the head.
Indeed, the use of bleeding in the vein of the forehead is after bleeding in the head for old diseases of the face: and for migraine, and redness: and for ugly ulcers.¶ Si ergo uena frontis non possit moliendose traderet, post phlebotomiam Cephalicae, ad latus faciei uenam, quae est prope nasum et sub oculis:
If the vein of the forehead cannot be reached after bleeding in the head, then the vein on the side of the face, which is near the nose and under the eye:And the quality of its bleeding is, according to what I tell you.¶ Postea propositus est de phlebotomia uenae sub linguis, et de qualitate eius.
Afterwards is presented bleeding of the vein under the tongue, and its quality.The patient tightens his neck with a bandage until the vein appears.¶ Postea ponantur super eam cotum et puluillos, et stringatur infra eam constrictione forti.
Then put over it a bandage and fine lint, and tighten it strongly from below with a tight bandage.Then take an instrument which is called "Fossorium."¶ Et ponantur super eam cotum et puluillos albi, et stringatur desuper constrictione forti: et dimittatur, donec sanetur.
And put over it white bandages and fine lint, and tighten it strongly from above; and let it be until he is healed.This is its form.¶ Postea ponantur super eam cotum et puluillos albi, et stringatur desuper constrictione forti: et dimittatur, donec sanetur.
Then put over it white bandages and fine lint, and tighten it strongly from above; and let it be until he is healed.Place the sharp point which is on the head of the Fossorium over the vein, and strike it with a comb or with another thing in that way: and let the blood run according to its amount.¶ Postea ponantur super eam cotum et puluillos albi, et stringatur desuper constrictione forti: et dimittatur, donec sanetur.
Then put over it white bandages and fine lint, and tighten it strongly from above; and let it be until he is healed.Then loosen the piercing of the patient and tighten it until he is healed.¶ Si ergo sanguis uenarum non currit liberius, ut debet: aut si est uena quae non potest percuti, nisi in ossibus subditis:
And sometimes it is opened with a broad incision.
However, the opening should not be acute-edged like other phlebotomes but rather blunt-edged.
And as for the incision itself, it must be made in a crosswise direction because of the proximity of the bone; and possibly the phlebotome will break if it is not thick enough.
¶ On phlebotomy on the veins in the two tear ducts.
The cause of phlebotomy on the two veins which are in the two tear ducts of the two eyes, is because of redness and itching in the eye, and an inflammation in the eye, and ailments of the face.Et phlebotomia eorundem quae est ad lachrymalem superiorem est melior et magis operose facienda, quia non est in illo venam major: et non debet intraveri os lacrimale, ne frangatur.
And the quality of their bloodletting is that it tightens a weak neck with wine.
Then let the phlebotomy them, and you stand over his head.
And let the bloodletting be according to a transverse cut a little in length, with a small phlebotomy, wider by a little, for there is no flesh in that place.
For if the end of the phlebotomy is sharp, perhaps it will be broken.
Then let him run from the blood as much as you need.
And put over them a bandage, and tighten them one night, and loosen them.
Of the bloodletting of the veins of the nose.
The bloodletting of the veins of the nose indeed brings about an acute fever and violent headache and pains in the face, especially as a nosebleed and redness which occurs in the face; especially when it is chronic.
And the quality of their bloodletting is that it tightens a weak neck with wine.
Then hold his nose with your left hand, and take a bloodletting needle, long and fine; and fix it in the middle of its tip, between that which distinguishes the nose according to its straightness.
For indeed the vein does not appear there through sight, and because blood begins to flow immediately.Et si tamen appareret sensui, non esset necesse ut sanguis fleat per longum tempus.
And indeed you ought to move your hand with the bloodletting needle a little; and let blood flow according to your need.
Then tie it up for one night.Si enim non ligatur, sanguis uenit et corrotat omnia.
For if it is not tied, blood flows and corrupts everything.For indeed it heals rapidly.Et qualitas phlebotomiae earum est, ut stringat infirmus collum suum cum uitta.
And the quality of their bloodletting is that it tightens a weak neck with wine.
The bloodletting of the two veins of Gui-degi is for constriction of breathing and for leprosy, and melancholy diseases, and scrofula, and ulcerations and bad sores, and for gnawing, that is to say, herpes zoster.
The operation of blood-letting in them is to bind the neck under both armpits with a ligature, and for the surgeon to stand over the patient's head while the patient sits on a seat.
Then he opens the vein for about as long as it takes to say a 'Pater noster'.
Then let him take away a moderate quantity of blood, or according to that which he sees is necessary for this purpose.
Then do the same with another vein.
Afterwards loosen the ligature, and tighten both veins with a medium pressure so that the patient does not faint.
And let him go until the morning.
For the wound will heal.
On bleeding in the veins of Algibourch.
But phlebotomy is a treatment for the veins of Algibourch: because it brings relief to the mouth, and corruption of the gums, and bad sores, and also fissures of the lips, and bad sores, even those which are in the nose, and around its neighborhood.
And the quality of their phlebotomy is to make the patient sit before you, and tighten his neck with a ligature.
Then roll back the lip of him, and look at two veins; one is on the right side of the lip, and the other on its left: and their indication is by means of a yellow color.Quam cum uideris, soluce utramque eorum cum digito tuo medio usque ad os.
And that is true, because around their ears are small black veins.
Therefore cut both of them with an inclined incision. But if you have doubt and do not know which is which, then go for the larger one of the two, and the more obvious one.
And likewise do with the two veins that are in the upper lip, and most often custom runs with it; and cut the two veins which are in the lower lip.
¶ Of bloodletting: Veins under the tongue after Head bloodletting.
The reason for the bloodletting of the two Veins which are under the tongue is that the bloodletting of the Head is for the puffiness which is in the throat and for diseases of the uvula, and diseases of the mouth.Et si quae forte egritudo sit in uulva seu in lingua: et si scieris quod uenus sub linguae latere sit: et non possit irruere ad uulvam nec ad linguam, et non possit irruere neque per traiectum: tunc fac ut phlebotomies sint in uenulis quae sunt in parte superioris oris.
And the quality of phlebotomy is that the sick person sits between your hands in the presence of the sun; and you open his tongue and look under the tongue on one side for blood, and on the other side for blood; and the color of both declines towards blackness.
And phlebotomy them both; and beware that you do not slide your hand out in phlebotomy them.
For under these are arteries, and perhaps there will be a flow of blood from those arteries.
¶ Of three veins in the elbow.
Now the three veins that are bled in the elbow, are in which phlebotomy runs custom in all men.Et tamen ad illas venas non est aditu facile, nisi per artem et experientiam: sed facile in duas alias quae praeteriunt consuetudo phlebotomandi: quae sunt sub cutem.
And bleeding of these veins is not easy access, unless by skill and experience; but easily in two others which pass over custom phlebotomy: which are under the skin.And their bleeding is done according to two modes.
Either pricking with a broad myrtle-wood phlebotomist; or olive oil to the subtlety of decline; or cut with a phlebotomy dagger, and it is Alnesil.Et si fit pungendo, sint venae ad latere externumque: et est utilitas illius in lueris et morbis, quae procedunt de humore sanguini.
And if it is pricking, the veins are on the outside; and its use is in lueris and diseases that result from a humour of blood.And this is its form.Et si fit oliuando, facies ad laterem internum.
And if it's olive oiling, make the face to the inner side.Thus is Alnesil, which suits the section.Et phlebotomia eius in lueribus et morbis.
And bleeding of these is in lueris and diseases.And from these are species broad, and subtle according to the amplitude of veins and strictness them Form phlebotomy myrtle be broad, as you see.Et sit subtilis, secundum necessitatem: nam si uena latior sit, facies eam subtilem; si quaeratur ad lueres et morbos, qui procedunt de humore sanguini.
And is necessary subtle, for if the vein is wider, make it subtle; if it is sought after lueris and diseases that result from a humour of blood.And suits to open veins hollow, full, proceeding, apparent, coarse, and those which contain coarse blood, turbid.Et si uena est stricta et profunda, facias eam latam: nam quaeratur ad phlebotomandas venas quae procedunt de humore sanguini.
And this bloodletting instrument is smaller in width and has finer edges.
It is suitable for letting blood from subtle veins that contain a subtle yellow blood.
¶ On the bloodletting of the basilic vein.
However, of these three veins, the basilic vein is the best instrument for bloodletting. For it draws blood from diseases which are under the throat and neck, from that which follows the chest, and the abdomen: and it suits a phlebotomist with a phlebotomy to beware, and be over fear because under it is an artery.
If therefore he makes a mistake, and adds to the puncture of the bloodletting, he will hit that artery, and there will be an occurrence of a flow of blood.
Therefore it is necessary that the bloodletting not be done with a bloodletting instrument that is puncturing; rather let it be cut with an Alnesil.Et iste phlebotomus est minoris latitudinis, et subtilioris extreminatis.
Which if it does not appear with a manifest appearance of the Basilic, then it is necessary that you move away from it, and exchange it for another, or seek some branch of it: or bloodlet in its place the arm vein.Et si in brachio non apparet uenam, sed apparet in antebrachio, tunc oportet ut sanguinem eam extrahas in antebrachio: et ne facias phlebotomiam per puncturam, sed per secturas.
And if it does not appear in the arm, but appears in the antebracio, then you must draw blood from it in the antebraccio: and do not make the bloodletting by puncture, but by incisions.For it is manifest, and cut it with the phlebotomy Anesil, as we have said.Et si in antebrachio non apparet uenam, sed apparit in manibus, tunc oportet ut sanguinem eam extrahas in manibus: et ne facias phlebotomiam per puncturam, sed per secturas.
And if it does not appear in the antebraccio, but appears in the hands, then you must draw blood from it in the hands: and do not make the bloodletting by puncture, but by incisions.But if you wish to know the pulse of it, then before the tightening of the arm, touch the place until you recognize the location of the pulse.Et si non apparet pulsus per strkturam brachii, sed apparit in antebrachio vel manibus, tunc oportet ut sanguinem extrahas in antebrachio vel manibus: et ne facias per puncturam, sed per secturas.
Then mark on the spot with cautery, afterwards on the arm, and cut the vein with a concave incision with a phlebotomist of Alnesil as we said.
And be careful that the blow does not fall through space from the site of the artery.
And when you see, as you tighten the ligament, a swelling at the site where you marked with cautery, then that swelling is an arterial swelling: therefore release it.
If you see the blood rise at the phlebotomy as the urine of a child and it is thin blood, red: then you know that it is from arterial blood.Et si uides eam sanguinem cadere in ligamen, et ligamen non continet eam, et tu scis quod non est sanguis arteriae: rubeus enim est et grossus.
And if you see the blood fall on the ligament and the ligament does not contain it, and you know that it is not arterial blood: for it is red and thick.Then therefore hurry and put your finger over that space lengthwise, then remove your finger.Et si uides inflationem cadere et sanguinem cadere, tunc scias quia est ex sanguine arteriae.
If therefore the blood is cut off (for it is often cut off), then tighten the arm and let go of it; and let the feeble man beware of its movement, and let him be above his fear.
And do not move it for several days until he is healed.
But if the blood does not stop and you are overcome by it, then cut the artery if it is apparent to you.
For its ends are clamped down upon and the blood cut off.
Or take the bark of a fig tree and find it; take one half and tighten it around the spot with a bandage in a decent manner, with a ligature and little threads until the next day.
Then if the blood is cut off, that is good.
And if not, then treat it with that from which its antecedent came by memory, and the blood flow is cut off from the spot of the powder; and the cutting off of its blood is not difficult in many dispositions, on account of the smallness of the wound and the possibility of the ligature from the arm.
§ On the phlebotomy of the Dark Vein.
Now the Dark Vein is subject to phlebotomy, because it draws blood from the upper part of the head and lower part of the body; for this reason, because it is composed out of the Basilic Vein and the Cephalica Vein, as we have said.Et ista trahit sanguinem ad medullam ossium: nam traxit sanguinem a parte superioris capitis, et ad partem inferioris per uenas quae in medullam ossium infunduntur.
And it behooves the phlebotomist to be over that fear from his phlebotomy, for under it is a nerve.
If therefore he adds to the pricking of the phlebotomy, and finds a nerve, there ensues stupor on it, and its cure is difficult, and perhaps it is not cured entirely.
And this nerve oft-times appears in sense.
But if it is hidden in certain men, and is subtle, and does not appear: then you must put your phlebotomy where you phlebotomize, the cut with Alnesil, and the avoiding of nerves with your strength.
If it is a vein between two nerves, then find the vein in length.Quidam dicunt: ponas phlebotomiam tuam prope sero.
Some say: put your phlebotomy close to the ear.
But as for phlebotomy of the Cephalic vein, it is for attracting blood from the head, and brings about diseases of the eyes.Quod si uena est inter duos neruos, tunc finde uenam in longitudine.
And it behooves in this vein properly, if you will, to phlebotomize her by pricking with a olive-wood phlebotomy, or with a myrtle-wood phlebotomy: for it is safer of veins, because there is no artery under it, nor nerve.Et si pulsas eam cum mano tua, et pulseris eam cum phlebotomo, erga sero, non debes sedere sed statim debes ambulare, et pergere pedem tuum, donec ueniat ad meatus tuos, et ad articulus tuos. However, when you bleed a varicose vein, you must take only the head of the lizard and seek a gentler spot; and it will not hurt if it is not found with the first blow, so that you can return to it several times with bleeding. However, perhaps an abscess forms in some people when they are not bled on the first strike, but that abscess does them no harm either.
On the benefits of bloodletting and the precautions to be observed in it.
Now as to the nature of bloodletting and its accidents, you must consider their correction.In phlebotomia enim si sanguis non egreditur, sed in venam recidit: apparet postea sub cutem tumescens, et rubicundum factum, et saepe mortuus est homo ex ea causa.
First, then, you should know that bloodletting is not administered for the sake of curing illness, or its persistence, or as a precaution against the onset of disease.Cum enim fit phlebotomia in humore melancolico, et in tempo frigido: statim sequuntur post eam aduentus aegritudinum.
And when bloodletting is performed in a melancholic humour, and in cold weather: immediately afterwards the onset of diseases follows it.And let bloodletting be done in one of the three veins which are in the elbow, namely the Cephalic, and the Dark, and the Basilic.Et si sanguis phlebotomiae non egreditur per cutem: sed recidit in venam: apparet postea sub cutem tumescens, et rubicundum factum, et saepe mortuus est homo ex ea causa.
And so that bloodletting is performed at the beginning of Spring after fasting and also in Summer, Autumn and Winter after a meal when signs of repletion appear.
And let bloodletting be done on the first day or on the third day after three hours have passed from that day.
Bloodletting which is administered for various ailments does not have a particular time determined for it; but whenever convenience and necessity demand it, it may be done at night or by day, at any hour, and at any time.
And it is not right that boys should be bled until they reach the age of fourteen years.
Nor let a pregnant woman be bled except from the fourth month to the seventh.
Nor let aged men who have already gone beyond sixty years be bled.Et non oportet sanguis aspirari per punctura venarum nisi a medico perito et optimo, et in loco ubi omnia sint parata ad curam.
When someone wants to bleed for any reason, they must cleanse their intestines beforehand with a gentle enema if there is a lot of constipation in them, so that the veins are not attracted by putrid superfluities from the intestines during bleeding, which harm the principal organs.
Neither let the patient bleed while fasting, that is, with a sense of nausea, nor after vomiting, nor after leaving drunkenness until it has left them.
Nor the feeble with dropsy.
And beware of bleeding again after colic pain and vomiting, and abdominal flow, and multiplication of intercourse, and labor and exercise, and vigils, and fasting, and everything that dissolves strength from a physical or animal thing.
Then consider in subtlety of the humors before it if there is blood thick with food and drink, and medicines, if possible for him.
Then enter the bath, if something does not prohibit it, or exercise in some exercise so that the blood is subtle.
And put the bleeding of it in the chest around the third day, as we have said, and try to have the chest emptied of it on that day from all bad animal accidents: such as distress, anger, fear; and from all bodily accidents, such as labor, pain, excessive flow, and those like them.
And have present things with which the custom of men runs according to their use of aromaticity, and scent, and tripudiation, and the like by quantity of possibility.
Then let the phlebotomist sit above the powder which is higher than the powder of bleeding; then he will draw out his arm and wipe it with his hand twice or three times.
Then tie the vein with a ligature and wind it twice.
And let the constriction be moderate, because when it is unequal or by superfluity in constriction then it prohibits the course of blood; or in relaxation then it also prohibits the course of blood.Et si lygamen praeterit, tunc phlebotomator detrahat eam cum digitis suus.
Then after the bandage has been applied, it is necessary that the person to be bled should rub his hands simultaneously up and down until the veins are dilated and become palpable.
Then the operator should wipe the site of the phlebotomy with a little old oil that is proper for this purpose.
Then he should place his left index finger above the vein at a point just beneath where he wishes to perform the phlebotomy, gently so as not to drive away the vein and break the incision.
For there is in veins one that flees like a string at the time of phlebotomy; and there is also one that is full of blood; and when you place the phlebotomy upon it, it is drawn back under the phlebotomy, and thus deceives the operator who does not open up the vein; but if he opens it, it is tight, because of this the operator must be firm and attentive to all these things.
Then remove the phlebotomy.
And if not, then repeat on the same spot with another incision slightly below or above, if the site is not swollen.
If it has become swollen, or feeble then leave him alone for a day, or two days and don't tie the ligature.Et in diebus sequentibus iteret ut supra.
Perhaps it is a hot boil.
And he must not go into a bath.
Then let him bleed, if he wishes.
If the wound is small, or if the blood flows gently, and you are afraid that a quantity of blood will not flow out; then repeat the phlebotomy at the opening itself according to its straightness, and add little to the operation.
And do this quickly, before the place is bled, for a bled place is in many people at the operation of little.
If you see that it is already bled then you shall by no means repeat over it, for it avails nothing with you. And put over it something of the dung of oil, because it eases the flow of blood.
And this is better in this place than oil itself and other oils.
And likewise put the dung of oil into all your phlebotomies, when you bleed veins at the prohibition of flow of blood; and they make this with alfarach tallow, and sagenia, when one of these is put over the place.
For blood flows gently and dissolves when it is thick.Quod si post ea uenere sanguis quiescit: ita quaeratur ut adduxerit illum ad hanc quietem tyriaca, qui non possit perueniere ad sanguinem et eiectare ei, nisi adduxerit per aliam rationem.
If blood stops after these things; then let it be sought out that tyriaca brought him to this quietness, who cannot reach the blood and cast it out unless through another reason.If it happens at a place of phlebotomy a large boil, for it often happens, especially to he who is not bled except through that vice, or if the opening of the vein is small, then hasten and put over the place a sponge infused in water and salt, gently heated; and compress it one hour: because it dissolves.
And it is necessary that you do this after the flow of blood from the vein itself, with its complement, or from another vein.Et si possis ponere super locum oleonorum faecem, et olfacere uigilia: faciunt illud cum sanguine uti tyriaca, qui post uenesectionem non habuit quietem, nam solutio ista multum adiuuat.
And very often hematomas and bumps occur during bleeding basilic vein.
Therefore put your hand over it; then if you feel softness under your hand over it, that protuberance is bad.
Therefore be careful to put on it something of what we have said.
For perhaps blood will flow from it out of an artery.Quod si remanserit in loco post dies aliquid nigredinis, aut uiriditatis, non nocet illud: et si uis, pone super ipsum aliquid aloe, aut myrrhae solutorum: aut aliquid ex succo menthastri, id est, calamenti aut simile illius.
But make a plaster for her with that which has astringency, so that the place may harden.Et multotiens quidem accidunt apostemata et eminentiae apud phlebotomiam Basilicae.Pone ergo manum tuam super ipsam, tunc si inuenis molliciem apud compressionem tuam super ipsam, tunc illa eminentia est mala.Caue ergo, ut ponas super eam aliquid ex eo quod diximus.Nam fortasse fluet ex ea sanguis arteriae.
Then take care of it with the rest of the treatment until it is healed.
And it is necessary to draw blood from every person according to the quantity of his strength.Quod si non feceris, periculum est, ut moriatur.
And that which appears by a purple color above the blood.Nam si erit in medio sanguinis, fac eam cum eisdem.
For if the blood is black, then let it come out until it turns red; and likewise if you see it thick, then let it come out until it is thinned out; and likewise if it is sharp, then let it come out until its sharpness is taken away.Et quod apparet ex colore uincente super sanguinem.Nam si erit in medio sanguinis, fac eam cum eisdem.
And it is necessary for the person who is full and strong, and needs a bloodletting at once, that the incision of the vein be enlarged, and that the bleeding be wide; and in him who is weak, let it be the contrary.Quod si non feceris, periculum est, ut moriatur.
And it is necessary to remove it with forceps and that there should be a tight opening; and the best method of administration for venesection is to make a transversal cut not a puncture wound.
And this mode of phlebotomy is safe from blood flow and cutting of nerve; and is praiseworthy and safer than phlebotomy by breadth and length.
And he who is accustomed to experience fainting during phlebotomy, ought to eat some bread soaked in pomegranate juice or mulberry juice before phlebotomy if it has been warmed; and draw three or four times from his blood.
And if he is of a cold complexsion then let him take before phlebotomy bread soaked in myrrh syrup or in aromatized honey syrup with spices or in aromatized fragrant syrup.
If fainting occurs during phlebotomy and its cause is abundant blood flow then let him take a drink of meat water and fine fragrant syrup; and use an aromatic with saltpetre, and smear his chest with it; and use the other remedies we have described in the chapter on fainting due to discharge.
But he who wants to treat his arm and remove his blood gently a second time; it is necessary for him whose phlebotomy is due to abundant discharge and his power is weak, to remove the blood gradually during continuous days because of the quantity of his power.Et si est uiribus debilis et non potest uenire ad phlebotomiam: oportet ut accipiat moxam aere in aqua calida, et potet eum, et postea faciat phlebotomiam.
But if he who wants to treat his arm and remove his blood gently a second time, and his body is strong then let him do it after seven or nine hours from his first phlebotomy.Et si est corporis debilis, et non potest bene uenire ad phlebotomiam: oportet ut accipiat moxam aere in aqua calida, et potet eum, et postea faciat phlebotomiam.
Whoever wants to attract blood from his body to the opposite part to which it inclines must wait until the second or third day.
For those whose body has a lot of blood that is already heated and sharpens, causing fever, the blood must exit in its entirety and a large quantity must be extracted from it. The opening should be enlarged until fainting occurs: after you have observed all the conditions of phlebotomy, and placed your hand over his pulse in the path of the blood flow, so that death does not occur at the site of syncopis.
Because many times it happens that when the phlebotomist is ignorant and careless, it falls.
And when you wish to dissolve the arm and dissolve blood again on the second day, after the opening of the vein has been closed, and the exit of the blood is difficult, you should not press upon it with vehemence, and quickly open it by making an incision.
Because this is very bad, rather leave it until the second day of phlebotomy.Et si uolueris soluere brachium, et trahere sanguinem de corpore, post diem primum: facit te, ut sit super eum tuus digitus, et non recedat ab eum, donec soluatur brachium.
Or remove with a sharp phlebotomy instrument that which has coagulated from blood at the opening of the vein, and place over it something dissolved salt in water.
And place over it some of the ointment known as alfaroc or sagenia, and place a light compression upon it until the blood comes out.
If, however, the vein is already ulcerated, then leave it and do not cut it until the ulcer has healed.
If need demands that blood be let a second time and there is no excuse for not doing so, then let the blood either with a phlebotomy instrument at the spot itself or on the other arm in another vein.
The veins of the arm are phlebotomized at the spot of the Fusca and Basilica, when they cannot be found and are hidden, because it is a compound of those two.Et postea ponatur super apostematem salis dissoluti in aqua, et alfarochi tyriacum cum mirabilem, et balsamicum, et sanguis egredatur de apostematis, et uena non claudatur, sed sedata sit.
And the quality of this bleeding is that one weak places his hand in hot water until it becomes red by the heat and the vein appears clearly.
Then let him tie a ligature not too tightly but with moderate tightness over it.
Then let him bleed according to the crosswise method gradually, not latitudinally or according to its length; and let there be a wide opening, and let your bleeding with which you are bleeding be just above the joint of the hand.Et si transuertur sanguis in extremitatem digitus, et intraverit ligatura super iuncturam, et non possit extendi pedem ad summam, sed pedes ad summa sint subligati.
And if the blood does not run with the first bleeding; but if after all the blood does not run, return your hand to hot water and do as before until you obtain your desire, or until the blood enters the ligatures.And most often the running of blood in hot water takes place in wintertime.
And the bleeding of this vein is healthier than all veins because there is no throbbing vein or nerve beneath it.Et si in hac uena ueniat sanguis multum, quod multum debet essed ad summam pedem ut pedes subligantur cum ligatura, et non possunt ad summam pedem extendi: sed intromittas manum in aquam calidum usque ad necessitatem tuam.
The phlebotomy of the right hand is a treatment for liver diseases.
And the quality of this phlebotomy is that you tighten the vein of the hand with a ligature, or your own hand, after you have placed it in warm water until the vein swells and is clearly felt.
Then perform the phlebotomy by pricking across it.
And if you cut it completely, that will do her no harm in any way.
And be careful not to press your hand down with the phlebotomy.
Beneath this are nerves of the fingers stripped of flesh.
Then return your hand to the warm water and let the blood flow in it.
For if you do not return it to the warm water, the blood will coagulate at the opening of the vein and be prevented from flowing.Et conserua, ne tu demoves manum tuae sub aqua, sed dimitte in ea per uenas currere sanguinem, donec non sint ullum plus fluxus.
When you have extracted the amount of blood that is necessary, then put on oil and salt, so that it does not congeal quickly.
And in the same way, you must do with every cut branch.
The sign of the bleeding from his left hand is that it pertains to diseases of the spleen; and similarly do the bleeding as you did in the second one equally.Et si uideris, quod sanguis non currit per ramum, sed stetit, adhaerebitque ad ramum, ut oportet, et non cursus est, ut debet: tu fac, ut disces de sanguine, quoniam non debet stetire.
The sign of bleeding from the saphenous vein is for diseases which are in the lower part of the body, as diseases of the uterus, and retention of the menses, and infirmities of the kidneys, and old ulcers of the buttocks and thighs, and similar diseases.
And the quality of bleeding is that the sick person should put his foot into hot water and make friction over it until the veins become prominent, and tie a ligature above the junction of the foot with a strap.Et si ramus stetit, adhaereritque ad ramum, et sanguis non cursit per eum, ut debet: tu fac iterum incisionem in ramure, et intra te et ramum, et itere trahe sanguinem, donec per ramum cursu, sicut debet.
And indeed, the location of this vein is next to the heel bone and appears opposite the thumb; and many branches originate from it on the surface of the foot.
So phlebotomy should be performed at its larger branch or next to the heel bone at its confluence; for it is better and safer.
But if phlebotomy is performed on the surface of the foot, then beware of the nerves that are below it upon the surface of the foot.
And position your phlebotomy where you will phlebotomize across it as if you wish to pierce it; and let the phlebotomist be a Nesil.Et si perierit sanguis in eam, ut necesse est in talibus, stipe uenam illam, ne ad nervum ueniat: et trahe ad te eam in palpare.
And if the blood does not flow out of it as it must do in such a case, then massage its leg in warm water; and let the blood run in it until it is relieved.But if its exit is blocked, then massage its leg in warm water; and let the blood run in it until it is relieved.
But if the phlebotomist mistakes it on the first stab, then he should go a little higher with the phlebotomy, for its site is safe and you need not fear evil from this, when you beware of the nerves as we have said.
And similarly with the saphenous vein of the other leg likewise.
But the site of the sciatic vein, as we have said, is next to the heel bone on the side of the shin.Et uenae Popliteae locus sub capite flexore genuae: et eorum rami multum intraunt ad pedem.
And the site of the popliteal vein is under the head of the knee-bender; and its branches penetrate much into the foot. And the indication for its phlebotomy is, for pain in the ankle, when it is due to hot blood.Et si non est dolus ibi, sed caliditas, tunc facies pedem eum calidum a frigore, et stipe uenam illam et trahe ad te eam in palpare.
And its quality is such that the invalid should enter the bath and hurry out: and he should draw up his leg from the ankle to above the calf by four fingers with a long, fine ligature: for it would not be apparent without this.
When therefore it appears, then the phlebotomy is according to whatever method it is possible for you, or according to transversion; and it is better, either to cut it by an incision, or to cut it by a section.
For the place of it is more healthy, and it is in many persons very much concealed.
If you do not find it at all, and it does not appear to the senses at all; then phlebotomize some branch of it, and that is which appears on the back of the foot, and turned towards the ear: and beware of nerves, and let blood flow in a quantity as much as you wish.
Then loose the ligature, and place over the place of phlebotomy a piece of skin, and tie the place.
For it is healed quickly.
Of Ventousation, and the quality of its use.
Head 98.
From horn, from bronze, and from bronze-tinted hide are made the tongs.
Indeed the ventosa is made in two ways.
By bloodletting and by scarification; and there is another ventosa without scarification. Indeed the ventosa that is without scarification is made in two ways: by suction, and by compression.
Or it is with fire.Et Ventosatio quidem fiunt secundum octo modis.
Indeed ventosas are made according to eight ways: with or without fire, with or without scarification; and with or without bloodletting.Et sunt quidam qui uentosationem faciunt cum scarificatione et cum igni.
There are fourteen places in the body where bloodletting is performed after making a superficial cut on the skin.
One of them is the bloodletting of Alnocrati, and it is at the back of the head; and of Alkehel, and it is in the middle of the neck; and of the two blades of Alhagdahim, and they are two lamina in the neck from its two sides simultaneously; and of the two mental bloodlettings, and they are below the jaw on both sides of the lower lip; and of the two spatular bloodlettings; and of Alachosos, which is above the tip of the tail; and of the two axillary bloodlettings, and they are in the middle of the two arms; and of the two crural bloodlettings; and of the two femoral bloodlettings.
Indeed, the bloodletting of Alnocrati will not draw blood from the minute veins scattered throughout the flesh, and because of this its power is not diminished, just as is the case with phlebotomy.
Bloodletting with or without fire should not be performed on any disease caused by fullness until the whole body has been emptied.Et si fit, non curat se ut per uentosationem aut igne cadant corpora, vel quod faciunt per lythotripsiam et phlebotomiam.
If necessity compels a bloodletting because of disease or habit, we perform it at any hour of the day, at the beginning, middle and end of the month.
This is because there are people in whom blood multiplies until it needs to be extracted by bloodletting; they find a heaviness and pain in their head.Et ex eo quod sanguis est, cadunt uiri in somnum profundum, et exeo quod multum est, est memento de eius extractione.
And there are those who find swelling and redness on their face, head, and neck.
And there are those who find itching on their face and forehead, darkness and dimness of sight.
And there are those who are affected with scabies.Et ex eis est qui inuenit rubedinem in oculis suis, et tenebrositatem, et hebetudinem in oculis suis. And there are those whose sight is impaired by redness, darkness and dimness. And there are those who suffer from excessive laughter.
And there are those who find a taste of blood in their mouth; or their tongue bleeds.
And there are those whose sleep is excessive.
And there are those who see in their dreams blood and redness, and the dead, and wounds, and things similar to these.Et ex eis est qui uidet in somno suo uentosationes et uberes, et quae sunt praeter naturam, et simulacra uirorum et mulierum. And when we see any of these things, and particularly if it is in the middle of the third month, then we command a blister to be made after two or three hours have passed of that day. Now the blister for the nape is: because it helps with weight on the head, and what is poured out to the eyes.Iuuamentum uentosationis super caput est: quoniam confert ad dolorem in facie et ad rubedinem oculorum.
