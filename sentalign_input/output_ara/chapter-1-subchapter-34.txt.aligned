On Cauterizing Hemorrhoids of the Anus.	On cauterization for anal haemorrhoids.	0.830897
If there are many chronic hemorrhoids in the anus, or one, and they are from thick cold humors or corrupt humidities, and they have been treated with what we mentioned in the division, but the treatment has not been successful, then cauterize the patient three times on the lower vertebrae, slightly below the "table," in a triangular shape.	When there are one or more chronic haemorrhoids in the anus arising from thick and cold humours or corrupt humidities, and they have been treated by those measures mentioned in the section, without effect, then sear the patient with three cauterizations over the lowest dorsal vertebra a little below the flat part of the back, triangularly; and one about two fingers' breadth below the navel.	0.7842284
And cauterize below the navel at a distance of two fingers. And if you estimate that his stomach has become cold, and his food is not being digested, and you see that his face is swollen, then cauterize him on the stomach with a large cauterization, as has been described before, and cauterize his liver. And another on his spleen, with a nail-shaped cautery iron. And leave the cauterization open for a while. Then treat him until he recovers, God willing.	And if you consider that his stomach has become chilled and his food not being digested, and you see his face swollen, then do one big cauterization over the stomach as previously described; and one over his liver; and another over the spleen; with the claviform cautery. Keep the burn open a long while; then dress till healed.	0.8419484
