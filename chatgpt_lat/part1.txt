Preface.
After I completed for you, O sons, this book, which is the final one in medical science, along with its supplements, and I reached its end with its explanations and clarifications, it seemed fitting to me to complete it for you with this Treatise, which is a part of practice, that is, surgery by hand.
Since the practice of manual surgery has fallen in our region, and in our time has been almost entirely lost, until perhaps the knowledge of it perished, and its traces were cut off. Only small descriptions of it remain in the books of the ancients, altered by other hands, where errors and confusion have arisen, until its purposes became closed off and its efficacy weakened. It seemed to me fitting to bring it back to life with the organization of this Treatise, following the way of exposition, clarification, and abbreviation, and to include the forms of the cautery tools and other instruments of the practice, with explanations added and with the necessary urgency.
The reason why a skilled practitioner in this art with his own hand is not found in our time is because the art of medicine is extensive, and its practitioner must first be trained in the science of anatomy, as described by Galen, until he knows the functions of the parts, their forms, and their connections and separations, and has knowledge of the bones, nerves, muscles, and their numbers and origins, as well as of the veins, both pulsating and still, and the places of their exits.
And because of this, Hippocrates said that name with name is plentiful, but with practice it is scarce, especially in the art of the hand.
We have already spoken of this in the introduction of this book.
For anyone who does not know what we have said about anatomy is not immune from error, an error by which people are killed, as I have seen many of those who are trained in this science and boast of it without knowledge and without experience.
For instance, I saw a foolish physician who cut into a scrofulous abscess on a woman’s neck and severed certain arteries in her neck, causing her blood to flow until she died in his hands.
And I saw another physician who presumed to extract a stone from an older man, and the stone was large.
He therefore reached the stone and extracted it along with a piece of the bladder.
Thus the man died on the third day.
And I had been called to extract the stone myself, but I saw from the size of the stone and the patient’s condition that he would die.
And I saw another physician who took payment from a certain Duke of our land for his practice, and a black eunuch under his care suffered a fracture in his leg near the heel. The physician, in his ignorance, rushed and bound the fracture over the wound with cushions and tight splints, not allowing the wound to breathe.
Then he discharged him according to his own wishes.
Afterwards, he left him for several days and instructed him not to loosen the bandage, and so it remained until his leg and foot became infected, resulting in ruin.
I was therefore called to him, and I hurried to loosen the bandage, and peace followed, and he was freed from his pains.
Nevertheless, the decay in the limb was already set in, and I could not halt it.
Thus, the decay ceased to spread through the limb until it perished.
And I saw another physician who pierced a cancerous abscess, and it became ulcerated after several days, until its malignancy grew along with the suffering of its owner.
This is because, when cancer is purely from a melancholic humor, it must never be treated with iron at all, unless it is in a limb that can endure having the entire affected area excised.
And therefore, O sons, it is necessary for you to know that manual operation is divided into two categories: namely, operations associated with safety, and operations that involve danger in many conditions.
And I have already pointed out in every place in this book where there is an operation involving terror and fear.
Therefore, it is necessary for you to be cautious of such things and to avoid them, so that fools do not find a reason to speak and dishonor the profession.
Therefore, approach with care and protection, and treat your patients with gentleness and firmness, using the best method, guided by the grace of God toward health and praiseworthy outcomes; and avoid terrible illnesses that are difficult to heal; and keep your souls from things that cause you fear, lest hesitation should enter your faith and your practice.
For this will be of greater benefit to your glory, and will elevate you more in this world, and ultimately increase your honor.
Galen has already said in certain of his teachings:
Do not treat a malignant disease, lest you be called a poor physician.
Now, I have divided this Treatise into three Chapters. ¶
Chapter One.
On cauterization with fire, and cauterization with sharp medicines, arranged chapter by chapter, and organized from head to foot, with the forms of instruments and cautery tools, and everything necessary for practice. ¶
Chapter Two.
On cutting and piercing, bloodletting, cupping, and wounds; and on extracting arrows, and things similar to these; all arranged chapter by chapter and organized with the forms of instruments. ¶
Chapter Three.
On restoration, dislocation, and treatment of twisting and similar injuries; arranged chapter by chapter from head to foot, with the forms of instruments.
Glory to God alone.

Part I.  
¶ On the Benefit and Harm of Cautery, and for which temperaments it is suitable, and at what time: and whether with iron or with gold.
**Chapter I.**  
But before I discuss the procedure with it, it is necessary to speak of its benefits and harms, and in what temperament it should be applied. 
I say, then, that the discourse on the nature of the benefit and harm of cautery is a long and subtle matter, involving knowledge and hidden secrets.
Many wise men have spoken about it, and there has been disagreement on it; for me, a little of their discourse will suffice, as I wish to avoid length.
I say, then, that cautery is universally beneficial for all temperaments with or without matter, except for two temperaments: those that are hot without matter and dry without matter.
But in the case of the hot and dry temperament with matter, there is disagreement. 
Some have said that cautery is beneficial in this case.
Others have said the opposite, namely that cautery is not suitable for an illness arising from heat and dryness, because the nature of fire is heat, and it is unsuitable to treat a hot and dry illness with something that is also hot and dry.
And the one who claims the opposite says that cautery provides relief in any hot and dry illness occurring in human bodies, because when you compare the human body and its moistures to the temperament of fire, you find the human body to be cold.
And I myself agree with his words because experience has already shown me this many times.
Nevertheless, no one should apply it except one who has already been proven and trained in the chapter on cautery, through complete practice, and who understands the diversity of human temperaments, the disposition of illnesses within themselves, their causes, their symptoms, and their timing.
As for the remaining temperaments, there is no fear upon you, especially in cold and moist illnesses.
Indeed, all physicians have agreed on these, and they have not disagreed on the benefit of cautery in such cases.
And know, my sons, that one secret of curing with cautery by fire, and its superiority over cautery with burning medicine, is that fire is simple, and its effect reaches only the member being cauterized and does not harm other parts connected to it, except with minimal harm.
The action of burning medicines, however, spreads to the surrounding parts, and it may even cause a difficult-to-heal illness in the affected member, or it may even kill.
But fire, because of its subtlety and the quality of its substance, does not cause this unless it is excessive.
And indeed, this has become known to us through experience, due to prolonged service and study in the art, and dedication to the truth of things; because of this, I excuse myself from prolonging the discussion.
And if it were not that my book does not permit it, I would bring to you the hidden secret of fire, and the quality of its action in bodies for expelling sicknesses, demonstrated through philosophical reasoning, which would sharpen your minds.
And know, my sons, that they disagree on the time when cautery is best performed, and they consider spring to be the best time.
But I say that cautery is suitable at any time because the harm occurring due to timing is outweighed by the benefit drawn from cautery.
Especially when cautery is needed for pains among the necessary pains—severe, sudden, and not tolerating delay—because it is feared that a greater harm may arise than the small harm brought by the timing.
And do not let it enter your minds, O sons, what only the common people and ignorant physicians believe, namely, that the illness cured by cautery never returns; they take this as certain, but it is not as they think. Cautery is no more than a substitute for medicine, which changes the temperament and dries the moistures that are the causes of pain.
Nevertheless, cautery surpasses medicine through the speed of its healing power, the strength of its action, and the intensity of its efficacy. And it is possible that the illness may return at some time, depending on the patient’s temperament, the location of his illness, and its strength, as well as what accumulates in his body from an aggregation of superfluities within it, and from what it acquires from foods and other similar causes—unless it is an illness for which cautery is applied.
A subtle illness in a part of the body with few superfluities and humidities, as in the case of cautery of a tooth for pain, and similar instances, may indeed not return in that area with the same pain.
But this happens in few cases.
However, the common saying, again, that cautery is the final remedy, is a correct saying—not for the reason they assume in it, because they believe that there is no treatment that matches medicine, nor any other remedy after cautery has failed.
But the reality is the opposite of that, and the meaning of cautery as the final remedy is only that when we have applied all methods of treatment to some illness, and those medicines do not succeed, then we finally apply cautery, and it is effective; hence it is said that cautery is the final remedy—not with the intention understood by the common people and the multitude of ignorant physicians.
The ancients said that cautery with gold is better than cautery with iron; and they said this only because of the uniformity of gold and the excellence of its substance; and they said that the cauterized place does not produce pus.
But this is not absolutely true, for I have already tested it and found that it does not do this in some bodies, while it does in others.
And cautery with gold is good and better than with iron, as they said.
Nevertheless, when you heat a gold cautery in the fire, it is not clear to you when it reaches the desired degree of heat because of the redness of the gold; and when it quickly cools, and if you add more heat, it melts in the fire and turns into thin layers.
Thus, the practitioner is inconvenienced by it, and for this reason, cautery with iron is faster and more accessible for us, being more straightforward in operation.
And I have indeed arranged this chapter on cautery according to topics, and I have ordered them from head to foot, so as to make it easier for the one who seeks what he wants from it.
