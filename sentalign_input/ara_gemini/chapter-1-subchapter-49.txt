Chapter forty-nine on cauterizing vitiligo.
If vitiligo becomes chronic and no medical remedy works for it
then cauterize it with a slight depth, according to the thickness of the skin
until the whiteness disappears and its color changes
then treat it with lentil flour, rose oil, plantain leaves, and pigeon blood or swallow blood, one part of each
and mix everything and spread it on a cloth and apply it to the affected area until it heals
