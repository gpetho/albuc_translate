Many times this disease comes to small children, and the sign of its onset is that they have labored breathing when they get up, and fear; and you find in the last spine of the back and in us the appearance that comes on the other spines.
When you see this and want to treat it, cauterize it with the circular cautery in this shape:
So that the cautery takes each part of the spine equally. And if you wish, cauterize around the spine with pricking cautery in two or three lines, and let the pricks be close to each other. Afterward, treat the area until it is healed as we said, and be careful not to administer cautery on gibbosity that is in a nerve spasm.
