About the waters of the eye
We have already described the types of eye waters in the division, and what is necessary to pierce them; do so according to the healthiness. You must make the patient sit between your crossed hands, away from the light of the sun, and bind the healthy eye and compress it very strongly; then place the eyelid of the eye in your left hand if the eye is the left one, or in your right hand if the eye is the right one; then take in your right hand, if the eye is the left one, the instrument called "almagda," or in your left hand if the eye is the right one; then place the point of the instrument near the cornea by the thickness of a line in the white part of the eye at the side of the smaller tear duct, then push the instrument called "almagda" strongly, and turn your hand until it pierces into the white of the eye, and feel that the almagda reaches the hollow part; and it is necessary that the measure of the almagda's path be to the depth of the measure of the space from the pupil to the end of the blackness; and that is the cornea of the eye; you will see the bone in that paper through the clarity of the corneal tissue, and you can place the instrument to where the water is, then press it below one path after another. If the water descends immediately, the patient will see in front of him and the instrument in his eye.
Then rest a little, and if the water rises again a second time, place it with the instrument, and when it is fixed and it does not rise, then lightly withdraw the almagda by turning your hand little by little; and then place a little of ground rock salt in the water, and wash the eye inside. Then place on the outside of the eye wadding or wool moistened with rose oil and egg white, and bind it with the healthy eye.  We, and those of our time, place ground cumin with egg white on it.
And if the almagda cannot enter the eye because of its hardness, for there are some men who have very hard eyes, then you must take the instrument called "alberit," of which this is the form:
And then pierce only the conjunctiva, and do not go too deep, but make a subtle hole, then place the almagda as we have said; and at the completion of the procedure prepare for the patient a suitable bed, where he sleeps on his back in a dark place; and he should be deprived of all movements, and take light food, and not move his head neither to the right nor to the left, and be bound according to his condition until the third day; then untie him in the same dark room, and test his vision, and make him see some things, and then rebind him until the seventh day; and it is not necessary to do this at the time of the procedure or immediately after the incision, but it is necessary to delay this, because the water rises quickly.
If a hot abscess comes, you must untie the eye before the seventh day, and treat it with what soothes the abscess; and when it is soothed, then untie the vision and place a small pillow on his face to cover it for a few days, and keep him in that dark room. And then let him go out of the house little by little, and return to his normal activities; and know that no disciples should interfere in this case.
And one came to us who was from Iraq, who told us that in his country they make a pierced almagda, with which they suck the water, but I never saw any in our land, nor did I ever read about it in the books of the ancients; and perhaps it is a new thing.
And these are the forms of the almagda, so that those who do not know them may see them; and they should be properly made of brass:
And let their heads be of the same delicacy, and the back in three sharp angles.
