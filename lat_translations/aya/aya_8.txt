Praefatio.	Preface.
Postquam compleui uobis o Filii, librum hunc, qui est postremus scientiae in medicina cum complemento ipsius, et consecutus sum finem in eo, ex expositionibus eius, et ipsius declarationibus, uisum est mihi, ut compleam ipsum uobis cum hoc Tractatu qui est pars operationis, id est, chirurgiae cum manu.	After I have completed to you, O sons, this book, which is the last of science in medicine with its supplement, and having finished it with its expositions and declarations, it has seemed right to me that I complete it for you with this treatise, which is a part of surgery, namely, with the hand.
Quoniam operatio cum manu prostrata est in regione nostra, et tempore nostro priuata omnino: donec fortasse periit scientia eius, et abscissum est uestigium eius: et non remanserunt ex ea, nisi descriptiones paruae in libris antiquorum, quas mutauerunt manus: et accidit eis error et haesitatio, donec clausae sunt intentiones eius, et elongata est uis ipsius: Visum est mihi, ut uiuificem eam cum ordinatione huius Tractatus in ea secundum uiam ex positionis, et declarationis, et abbreuiationis: et ut ueniam cum formis ferramentorum Cauterii, et reliquorum instrumentorum operis: cum fit ex declarationis additione, et ex properatione eius quod est necesse.	Since operation with the hand is laid down in our region and in our time exclusively: until perhaps knowledge of it has perished, and its trail has been lost: and there remain of it, only a few descriptions in ancient books, which hands have changed: and error and uncertainty occurred to them, until their intentions were closed, and his intention was prolonged. It seemed right to me that I should clarify it with this arrangement of this treatise according to two things, that is, by exposition and declaration, and abbreviation: and that I bring it closer with the forms of tools Cautery, and other instruments of work: for it is necessary to add a declaration, and to distinguish it, because there remains.
Caussa autem propter quam non inuenitur bonus artifex eius cum manu sua in hoc nostro tempore, est: quia ars medicinae est longa, et oportet auctorem eius exercitari ante illud in scientia anatomiae, quam narrauit Galenus, donec sciat iuuamenta membrorum, et ipsorum formas, et eorum coniunctionem, et separationem, et habeat cognitionem ossium, et neruorum, et lacertorum, et numerum ipsorum, et eorum egressionem, et uenarum pulsatilium, et quietarum, et locorum exitus earum.	The reason why there is no good craftsman of this hand in our time: for the art of medicine is long, and it is necessary that the author of it should exercise himself before it in the science of anatomy, which Galen narrated, until he knows the functions of the limbs, and their forms, and their connection, and separation, and has knowledge of the bones, and nerves, and ligaments, and the number of them, and their course, and their pulsations, and quiet, and places of exit:
Et propter illud dixit Hippocrates, quod nomen cum nomine est multum, et cum opere est paucum, et praecipue in arte manus.	And because of that Hippocrates said, since a name is much with a name, and little with an operation, especially in the art of the hand.
Nos uero iam diximus de illo in introitu huius libri.	We have already said about it at the beginning of this book.
Quoniam qui non est sciens, quod diximus de anatomia, non euacuatur, quin iam cadat in errorem, quo interficiuntur homines: sicut ego uidi multos ex illis, qui formantur de hac scientia, et iactant se de ea absque scientia, et sine experimento.	Since he who is not knowing that we have said about anatomy will fall into error, to which human beings are subject: as I saw many of them form about this science, and boast themselves of it without knowledge, and without experiment.
Quod est, quia uidi medicum stolidum secuisse apostema scrophulosum in collo mulieris, et incidit quasdam arterias in collo: quare fluxit sanguis mulieris, donec cecidit mortua inter manus eius.	That is because I saw a doctor cut an aposteme scar on the neck of a woman, and he struck some arteries in her neck. Why did the blood flow from the woman's body until she died between his hands?
Et uidi medicum alium, qui praesumpsit ut extraheret lapidem uiro, qui processerat in aetate, et lapis erat magnus.	And I saw another doctor who assumed that he would extract a large stone from the bladder of a man who had been suffering for a long time, and the stone was big.
Peruenit ergo ad eum, et extraxit ipsum cum frusto uesicae.	So he approached him and removed it with a twig.
Quare mortuus est uir in tertio die.	Why did the man die on the third day?
Et ego quidem iam uocatus fueram ad extrahendum ipsum: et uidi ex magnitudine lapidis, et dispositione infirmi, quod moriretur.	And I had already been called to extract it; and I saw from the great size of the stone and the care of the nurse that he would die.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui accipiebat stipem apud quendam Ducum terrae nostrae propter medicinam: et accidit eunucho nigro, qui erat apud ipsum, fractura in crure eius prope calcaneum: et properauit medicus cum ignorantia sua, et strinxit fracturam super uulnus cum puluinaribus, et astellis strictura forti, et non dimisit uulneri expirationem.	And I saw another doctor who was taking a fee from the Duke of our land for medicine; and there happened to be a black eunuch near him, who broke his thigh bone near the heel: and the doctor continued in his ignorance, and he bound the fracture tightly with strong threads, and did not leave the wound's discharge undischarged.
Deinde absoluit eum secundum desyderia sua.	Then he discharged him according to his desires.
Postea dimisit eum diebus aliquot, et praecepit ei, ne solueret ligamentum: et stetit sic donec apostematum est crus eius, et ipsius pes, et peruenit ad perditionem.	Then he discharged him after a few days, and he ordered that the ligatures not be removed: and so he stood until his leg and foot were withered away, and came to destruction.
Vocatus sum ergo ad eum: et properaui ad soluendum ligamentum: et consecuta est tranquillitas, et euasit a doloribus suis.	So I was called up to him; and I set out to loosen the ligatures; and the result was calmness, and he was free of his pains.
Verumtamen corruptio iam confirmata erat in membro: et non potui refraenare ipsam.	However, the corruption had already become established in the member; and I could not restrain it.
Pon ergo cessauit corruptio perambulare in membro, donec periit.	Then the corruption stopped walking in the member until it perished.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui perforauit apostema cancerosum: et ulceratum est post dies, donec magnificata est malicia eius cum domino ipsius.	And I saw another doctor who pierced an aposteme cancerosa; and it was ulcered after a few days until the maliciousness of it increased with his lord.
Quod est, quia quando est cancer purus ex humore melancholico, tunc non oportet ut perueniatur ad eum cum ferro omnino, nisi sit in membro quod toleret, ut abscindatur totum eius.	That is because when it is cancer pure from melancholic humor, then one should not approach it at all with iron unless it sits in a member that can bear it so that the whole of it may be cut off.
Et propter illud o Filii, necesse est uobis, ut sciatis, quod operatio cum manu diuiditur in duas diuisiones: scilicet, operationem cui associatur salus: et operationem, cum qua est periculum in pluribus dispositionibus.	And for this reason, my sons, you need to know that surgery is divided into two parts: one in which health is associated with the operation and another in which there is danger in many dispositions.
Et ego iam excitaui in omni loco huius libri, in quo uenit operatio, in qua est terror et timor.	And I have already aroused it in all places of this book, where the operation comes, in which there is fear and dread.
Quare necesse est uobis, ut caueatis illud, et dimitatis ipsum: ut non inueniant stolidi uiam ad loquendum, et dehonestandum.	Why do you need to be afraid of that, and to diminish it: so that the blind may not get accustomed to speaking and being dishonorable.
Accipite ergo mensuram cum sollicitudine et protectione, et infirmos uestros cum facilitate et firmitudine, et utimini uia meliore perducente gratia Dei ad salutem et successionem laudabilem: et dimittite aegritudines terribiles difficilis sanationis: et tollite animas uestras ab eo quod facit uos timere, ut ingrediatur super uos haesitatio in fide uestra et commodo uestro.	Therefore take a measure with care and protection, and bring the sick among you with ease and firmness, and use a better way that leads to grace by the mercy of God for salvation and a worthy succession: and remove the terrible diseases from among you, which make you afraid, so that hesitation may come upon you in your faith and your confidence.
Est enim magis remanens ad gloriam uestram, et sublimius in mundo isto, et postremo ad quantitates uestras.	For there remains more for our glory, and higher in the world, and lastly to the quantities of us.
Galenus enim iam dixit in quibusdam suis admonitionibus.	For Galenus has already said in some of his advice.
Non medicetis aegritudinem malam: ne nominemini medici mali.	Do not cure a disease with medicine: do not call yourself a doctor.
Iam autem diuisi hunc Tractatum secundum tria Capitula. ¶	I have already divided this treatise into three chapters.
Capitulum primum.	Chapter one.
De Cauterio cum igne, et Cauterio cum medicina acuta, capitulatum, et ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum, et ferramentis Cauterii: et omni quod necessarium est in operatione. ¶	Chapter one. On cauterizing with fire, and on cauterizing with sharp medicine, on the form of instruments, and on tools for cauterizing: and on everything necessary for the operation.
Capitulum secundum.	Chapter two.
De sectione et perforatione, phlebotomia et uentosis, et uulneribus: et extractione sagittarum, et similibus illius: et totum capitulatum, ordinatum formis instrumentorum. ¶	Chapter two. On cutting and piercing, phlebotomy and tourniquets, and wounds: and on extracting arrows, and similar things: and all the chapter, divided into forms of instruments.
Capitulum tertium.	Chapter three.On bandaging, and on plasters, and on poult
De restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus illius: capitulatum, ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum.	On restoration, and dislocation, and cure of twist, and similar things: the whole chapter, divided from the head to the feet, and in forms of instruments.
Soli Deo Gloria.	Glory be to God only.
Liber Chirurgici Albucasis.	The Book of Surgery of Albucasis.
Pars I.	Part I.
¶ De Iuuamento, et Nocumento Cauterii: et quibus complexionibus conueniat, et quo tempore: et si cum ferro, uel auro.	Regarding the application of cautery and the types of skin lesions that are suitable for it, and at what time of day, and whether with iron or gold.
Caput I.	Head I.
Sed Ante Quidem Quam rememorer operationis cum eo, oportet ut dicam qualitatem Iuuamentorum eius, et Nocumentorum ipsius: et in qua complexione exhibeatur.	But before I speak about the qualities of the cautery and the contraindications, it is necessary to describe the types of skin lesions that are suitable for it.
Dico ergo, quod sermo de qualitate iuuamenti Cauterii, et nocumenti eius, est sermo prolixus, et subtilis, scientia, et secretum occultum.	I therefore say that the speech about the quality of cautery and its contraindications is a long, subtle, scientific, and secret speech.
Etiam locuta fuit in eo multitudo sapientum, et dissenserunt in eo: et mihi quidem sufficit parum ex sermonibus eorum, timens prolongationem.	A multitude of wise men also spoke in it, and they disagreed with each other; but for me, a little of their speech is enough, fearing extension.
Dico ergo, quod Cauterium confert uniuersaliter omni complexioni, quae est cum materia, et absque materia: excaeptis duabus complexionibus, quae sunt complexio calida absque materia, et complexio sicca absque materia.	I say that cautery is suitable for all types of skin, whether with or without substance; excepting two types of skin, which are warm and dry without substance, and dry and cold without substance.
In complexione autem calida et sicca cum materia dissenserunt.	But in the case of warm and dry skin with substance, they disagreed.
Quidam enim dixerunt, quod Cauterium iuuatiuum est in ea.	Some said that cautery is suitable for such skin.
Et dixerunt alii contrarium illius, scilicet quod Cauterium non est conueniens in aegritudine, quae est ex caliditate et siccitate: quoniam natura ignis est caliditas: et inconueniens est, ut sanetur ex agritudine calida et sicca, cum calido et sicco.	But others said the opposite, namely that cautery is not suitable for an illness that is both hot and dry, because fire's nature is hot, and it does not suit to heal a hot and dry disease with hot and dry means.
Et dixit ille qui dicit contrarium illius: quod per Cauterium fit iuuamentum in omni aegritudine calida et sicca, quae accidit in corporibus hominum: quoniam quando tu comparas corpus hominis, et humiditates eius, ad complexionem ignis, inuenis corpus hominis frigidum.	And he who says the opposite said this: "But with cautery, an illness that is hot and dry can be cured in any part of the body, because when you compare the human body to the fire's moisture, you will find that the human body is colder.
Et ego quidem dico per sermonem eius: quia ex perimentum iam detexit mihi illud aliquotiens.	And I myself say through my own experience: because through experiment I have often found this to be true.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut ueniat super illud, nisi qui iam probatus est, et exercitatus in capitulo Cauterii exercitio ultimo, et cognouit diuersitatem complexionum hominum, et dispositionem aegritudinum in se ipsis, et caussas earum, et accidentia ipsarum, et spacium temporis earum.	But it is not necessary to add anything to that, unless one has already tested and exercised in the exercise of the last chapter on cautery, and has recognized the diversity of human skin types, and the nature of illnesses within them, and the causes of those illnesses, and the accidents associated with them, and the time period of their occurrence.
Ex reliquis autem complexionibus non est super uos timor: et praecipue in aegritudinibus frigidis et humidis.	Do not fear either to use the ointments left over: and above all when you are dealing with patients who are cold and wet.
Iam enim conuenerunt omnes medici super eas: et non dissenserunt in iuuamento cum Cauterio in eis.	For all doctors have come together on them: and they have not disagreed in the treatment with the use of ointment.
Et scitote filii, quod ex secreto curationis per Cauterium cum igne, et bonitate eius super Cauterium cum medicina comburente est: quoniam ignis est simplex, cuius actio non peruenit, nisi ad membrum quod cauterisatur: et non nocet membro alio coniuncto cum eo, nisi nocumento paruo.	And know, sons, that the secret of cure by cautery with fire, and its goodness above cautery with medicine burned together, is because fire is simple, whose action does not reach, unless to the limb that is cauterized: and it does not hurt another member joined with it, except with little harm.
Medicinae uero comburentis actio peruenit ad illud quod elongatur ex membris: et fortasse facit accidere in membro aegritudinem difficilis sanationis, et fortasse interficit.	But the action of medicine that is burned comes to that which is prolonged from limbs: and perhaps it causes a difficult cure to heal, and perhaps it kills.
Ignis autem propter subtilitatem suam et bonitatem substantiae suae, non facit illud, nisi superfluat.	But fire, because of its slightness and goodness of its substance, does not do that, unless it runs short.
Iam uero innotuit nobis illud per experimentum, propter longitudinem seruitutis et studii cum arte, et stationem super ueritatem rerum: et propter illud excusor a longitudine sermonis.	But this has already become known to us by experimentation, because of the length of use and study with art, and stability on the truth of things: and for this reason I excuse myself from the length of speech.
Et si non esset, quia non licet huic libro meo, afferrem uobis secretum occultum in igne, et qualitatem operationis eius in corporibus expulsionis suae, qua expellit aegritudines sermone philosophico demonstratiuo, qui acueretur a mentibus uestris.	And if it is not allowed, because it is not fitting for my book, I would take away from you the secret hidden thing of fire, and the quality of its action in bodies by its expulsion, which expels diseases with philosophical speech that is demonstrated by the minds of your scholars, which has been acquired.
Et scitote filii, quod ipsi dissentiunt in tempore, in quo conuenit fieri cauterium, et ponunt melius tempus ueris.	And know, sons, that they disagree in time when cauterization is to be made, and set a better time for the wound.
Et ego dico, quod cauterium conuenit in omni tempore: propterea, quod nocumentum accidens propter tempus submergitur in iuuamento, quod attrahitur cum cauterio.	And I say that cauterization is to be made at all times: because the harm that happens by time is hidden in the treatment, which is drawn with cautery.
Et praecipue si cauterium est propter dolores ex doloribus necessariis, fortibus, festinis, qui non tolerant tarditatem: propterea quod timetur ex eis, quod accidat malicia quae est maior, quam paruum nocumentum intrans propter tempus.	And especially if cauterization is because of the pains from necessary pains, firm, festivals, which do not tolerate tardiness: because they are afraid of them, that evil may happen, which is greater than a little harm that does not pass by time.
Et non cadat in mentibus uestris o filii illud, quod non extimant, nisi uulgus et stolidi medici, scilicet quod illi aegritudini quae sanatur per cauterium, non est reditio semper: et ponunt illud consequens, et res non est sicut putant: propterea quod cauterium non est, nisi loco medicinae, quae alterat complexionem, et exiccat humiditates quae sunt caussae, quare accidunt dolores.	And let not the son of that woman fall in the minds of you all, if he does not take care, unless the people and those who are dull-witted, namely that it is not always a return to health for him when his illness which is cured by cauterization: and they put it down as a consequence, and it is not like what they think; therefore because cauterization is not, except in the place of medicine, which changes the complexion and dries up the humidities that are the causes, why these pains occur.
Verumtamen cauterium superfluit super medicinam per uelocitatem ualetudinis suae, et uirtutem suae operationis, et uehementiam dominii sui: et possibile est, ut redeat aegritudo hora aliqua temporis secundum complexionem infirmi, et locationem aegritudinis suae, et uirtutem eius: et quod praeparatur in corpore eius ex aggregatione superfluitatum in eo: et quod peruenit ad ipsum in acquisitione sua ex cibis, et similibus illis ex caussis, nisi fit aegritudo, in qua administratur cauterium.	But cauterization is superfluous on medicine by its velocity of health, and the merit of its operation, and the severity of its lordship: and it is possible that he returns to health at some time of time according to the complexion of sickness, and the location of his illness, and the merit of it; and that he was prepared in his body from the accumulation of superfluity in him: and that it has come to itself in acquisition from food, and similar things from causes, unless there is an illness, in which cauterization is administered.
Aegritudo subtilis in membro paucarum superfluitatum, et humiditatum, sicut cauterium dentis, propter dolorem, et similia illi, possibile est enim, ut non redeat in eo ille dolor.	But a slight illness in a small member is superfluous of the excess of moisture, like cauterization of a tooth, for pain, and similar to it; it is possible that he does not return to health in him: that pain.
Sed illud fit in paucis.	But this happens in few things.
At uero sermo uulgi iterum, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, est sermo rectus: non ad illud quod ipsi intendunt in illo: quoniam ipsi credunt, quod non est curatio quae conferat cum medicina, neque cum alio post occasum cauterii.	But the words of the people again, that cauterization is the last medicine, are right words: not to what they mean in it: for they believe that there is no cure which confers with medicine, and neither with any other after the occasion of cautery.
Res autem est econtrario illius, et intentio, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, non est, nisi quod quando nos administramus modos curationis in aliqua aegritudinum, et non conferunt illae medicinae: deinde administramus in fine rei cauterium, et confert: tunc inde cadit, quod cauterium est postremum mediciuae, non secundum intentionem quam intelligunt uulgus et multistolidorum medicorum.	But the thing is opposite to what they say, and the intention, that cauterization is the last medicine, is not, except when we administer ways of cure in some illnesses, and they do not confer with medicines: then we administer at the end of things cauterization, and it confers; then from this it falls, that cauterization is the last medicine, not according to what they understand the people and many dull-witted doctors.
Antiqui autem dixerunt, quod cauterium cum auro est melius, quam cauterium cum ferro: et non dixerunt illud, nisi propter aequalitatem auri, et sublimitatem substantiae suae: et dixerunt, quod non facit pus locus cauterii.	Antiqui autem dixerunt, quod cauterium cum auro est melius, quam cauterium cum ferro: et non dixerunt illud, nisi propter aequalitatem auri, et sublimitatem substantiae suae: et dixerunt, quod non facit pus locus cauterii.
Verum non est illud absolute: quoniam ego iam probaui illud, et inueni, quod ipsum non facit illud in quibusdam corporibus absque aliis.	Yet the old people said that it is better to apply a burn with gold than with iron; and they did not say this except because of the equality of the gold and the poverty of its substance; and they said that there is no place for a burn. But this is not true, for I have tested this and found that it does not work in some bodies without others.
Et cauterium cum ipso est bonum, et melius quam cum ferro, sicut dixerunt.	And the cautery with itself is good, and better than that with iron, as they said.
Verumtamen quando tu ignis cauterium in igne ex auro, non declaratur tibi, quando ignitur secundum quantitatem quam uis, propter rubedinem auri: et quando properat ad ipsum frigus, et si addis super ipsum ignitionem, liquescit in igne, et uertitur in laminas.	But when you apply the fire cautery in the fire from gold, it does not manifest to you, when you set it on fire according to the quantity that you want, because of the redness of gold: and when it comes to its own heat, and if you add ignition to it, it melts in the fire and turns into sheets.
Quare cadit artifex ex illo in occupationem: et propter illud fit Cauterium cum ferro apud nos uelocius et propinquius, ex rectitudine ad operationem.	Why does the craftsman fall from that one to work: and because of that it is more expedient and closer for us to make a cautery with iron, out of straightness to the work.
Et ego quidem iam ordinaui hoc Capitulum in Cauterio, secundum capitula: et ordinaui ea a capite usque ad pedes: ut alleuient quaerenti illud quod uult ex eo.	And I too have already arranged this Chapter on the cautery, according to chapters; and I have arranged it from the head down to the feet; that the seeker may find what he wants out of it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Caput in commissura coronali.	On the mode of applying the cautery to the crown of the mouth.
Caput II.	Chapter II.
Confert hic cauterizatio ad dominium humiditatis et frigiditatis super cerebrum: quae duae sunt caussae sodae, et multitudinis fluxus humorum ex capite ad partes oculorum et aurium, et multitudinis somni, et doloris dentium, et doloris gutturis: et uniuersaliter omnis aegritudinis, quae accidit ex frigiditate, sicut paralisis, et sodae, epilepsiae, et apoplexiae, et similia illis ex aegritudinibus.	Here let the cauterization be to the lordship of moisture and coldness on the brain; which two things are the cause of the salt, and of the multitude of flow of humors out of the head to the eyes and ears, and of the multiplicity of sleep, and of the pain of teeth, and of the pain of throat: and universally all sickness that happens from coldness, such as paralysis, and salt, and convulsions, and fainting fits, and those like them from those illnesses.
Modus cauterizationis est, ut praecipias infirmo: ut euacuetur in primis cum medicina solutiua mundificante caput tribus noctibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod exigit uirtus infirmi, et eius aetas, et consuetudo eius.	The method of cauterization is so that you may instruct the sick person: to wash his head with soluable medicine three times a night, or four times, according as the strength of the patient and his age and custom require it.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radi faciat caput suum cum nouacula.	Then command him to wash his head with cold water.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas quadratum, ita quod iam posuit manus suas super pectus suum.	Then make him sit between your hands so that he has already placed his hands on his chest.
Deinde pone radicem palmae tuae super radicem nasi sui inter oculos suos.	Then place the root of your hand over the root of his nose between his eyes.
Vbicumque ergo peruenerit digitus tuus medius, signa locum illum cum incausto.	So whichever finger of your middle hand touches the place where the nose joins the face, mark it with a burn.
Deinde igni Cauterium Oliuare: cuius haec est forma.	Then light a cautery with olive oil: whose this is the form.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum signatum cum incausto, descensione, qua constringatur manus tua paulatim, et tu reuolues ipsum.	Then place the person himself on the marked spot with the burn, so that your hand constricts him little by little, and you release him.
Deinde leua manum tuam uelociter, et aspicias locum.	Then quickly release your hand, and look at the spot.
Quod si uides iam detegi ex osse quantitatem capitis alkiel, aut quantitatem zeuherbi, tunc eleua manum tuam.	If you see already a quantity of hair falling out from the bone, or a quantity of herbs, then quickly release your hand.
Et si non, itera manum tuam ferro ipso, aut cum alio ab ipso si infrigidatur: donec uideantur ossa, quae dixi tibi.	And if not, repeat the ironing of the same with another one when it is frigidized: until you see the bones that I told you.
Deinde sume aliquid ex sale, et solue illud in aqua, et imbibe in ipso cotum, et pone super locum: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then take some salt, and dissolve it in water, and steep it in the liquid, and place it on the spot: and release him for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, et dimitte illum super locum, donec destruatur eschara ignis.	Then place over the soaked cloth in butter, and release him on the spot until the fire scar is destroyed.
Deinde cura illud cum unguento tetrapharmacon, usquequo sanetur.	Then care for that with the four-part ointment, until it is healed.
Iam dixerunt, quod quanto uulnus plus remanet apertum, emittit pus: quare est melius et magis iuuatiuum.	They have already said that since the wound remains open for so long, it emits pus: why is this better and more beneficial.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum, ut cauterizetur cutis usque ad os: et teneatur Cauterium, donec aduratur quiddam spissitudinis ossis.	And some of them said, Let the skin be cauterized all the way down to the bone: and hold the cautery, until a certain thickness of bone is burned.
Deinde radatur post illud quod adustum est ex osse, deinde curetur.	Then burn after that what is burnt out from the bone, then treat with ointment.
Et dicunt alii, quod oportet ut cum cauterio perueniatur ad ultimum, donec imprimat in os impressionem for tem, ita quod cadat os, quod fit sicut forma kirate: aut instrumentum quod mulieres ponunt infuso alphabeti parui: et extimant, quod exspirantur ex hoc loco uapores capitis, et dimittatur uulnus apertum tempore longo.	It is said that when the caesarian section is performed to the end, until it impresses the impression on the mouth for a long time, so that the mouth falls down, which is like the shape of kirat: or the instrument that women put in the infusion of letters, and they estimate that from this place the vapours of the head are exhaled, and the opened wound is closed at the right time.
Deinde curetur, donec consolidetur.	Then let the wound be treated until it has healed.
Mihi autem non uidentur hae duae species Cauterii omnino nisi in quibusdam hominibus secundum uiam timoris.	But these two kinds of cautery do not seem to me to exist at all unless they are used by some people out of fear the second time.
Et dimittere ipsum, apud me est melius cum salute ipsius.	And let it be removed; for me, it is better to remove it when the patient is healthy.
Debilitatur enim caput ex solutione continuitatis ipsius naturalis: sicut testificati sumus in reliquis membris: et praecipue quando caput infirmi debile est natura: et species quidem Cauterii prima est magis salua et melior apud me, et ea utor: operare ergo cum ea in salute.	For the head weakens from the continence of its own nature: as we have witnessed in the other members: and especially when the head is weak from sickness; and the species of cautery first are more salutary and better for me, and I use them: therefore let us perform it when healthy.
¶ De modo cauterizandi capitis in dolore totius capitis.	The way of cauterizing the head when it is in pain throughout the whole head.
Caput III.	Head 3.
Quando in toto Capite accidit dolor chronicus: et prolongatur illud in infirmo, et utitur hyeris, et cochiis, et caputpurgiis, et oleis, et empleumatis.	When chronic pain occurs throughout the whole head: and is prolonged in an invalid, and uses soap, and baths, and poultices, and oils, and applications.
Et praecipue si iam cauterizatum est cauterio uno, quod narrauimus, et non confert ei aliquid ex illis: tunc considera.	And above all if it has already been cauterized with one kind of cautery which we have described, and does not give any benefit from it: then consider.
Nam si caput infirmi est fortis creationis natura, et non est debile, et inuenit frigus uehemens: tunc cauteriza cum cauterio alio sub illo parum.	For if the head is weak from the strength of nature, and is not weak, and there is a cold feeling: then cauterize with another kind of cautery slightly under it.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio, do nec pertranseat cutis, et discooperiatur ex osse quantitas, quam narrauimus.	Then cauterize it itself on all the corners of the head with its own cautery, and let the skin not be disturbed, and a quantity be taken from the bone which we have described.
Et cauteriza ipsum cauterio uno in occipitio capitis sui, in loco qui nominatur uas: et est locus in quo ponitur uentosa: et eleua matum tuam in hoc, et non discooperias os.	And let it be cauterized with one kind of cautery in the back of the head in the place which is called the air: and this is a place where the wind blows: and wash your hair in this way, and do not discover the mouth.
Infirmus enim inuenit propter illud dolorem uehementem, et diuersum a dolore reliquorum cauteriorum capitis omnium.	This is critical: he became sick because of that painful symptom, and very much relieved from the pain of all other headaches.
Et ego dicam hoc Cauterium in loco suo: et oportet quod sit cauterium, quo cauterizantur cornua capitis, et occiput eius subtilius cauterio, quo cauterizatur medium capitis.	And I will say this about the cautery in its place: and it is necessary that there be a cautery to cauterize the horns of the head, and the back of the skull be slightly cauterized, where the middle of the head is cauterized.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is the shape of it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in hemicrania, tam cum medicina adustiua, quam cum ferro.	**On the way to cauterizing with respect to headaches, both when medicine is applied as well as when iron is used.**
Caput IIII.	**Chapter IV. On the treatment of headache.
Quando accidit in parte capitis dolor et soda, aut extenditur dolor usque ad oculum, et euacuatur cum medicinis mundificantibus caput, et administratur reliqua curatio, quam dixi in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert illud totum: tunc cauterizatio in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterizatio cum medicina acuta comburente: aut cum ferro.	**When there is pain on one side of the head and soda, or the pain extends as far as the eye, and the head is cleansed with cleaning medicines, and the rest of the treatment is administered, which I have described in the divisions of illnesses, and does not provide all of this: then cauterization in it is according to two methods: either cauterization while burning medicine: or with iron.**
Cauterium autem cum medicina acuta comburente, est, ut accipias dentem unum allii, et excortices ipsum, et abscindas extremitates eius ex duobus lateribus.	**But when cauterization is made while burning medicine, it is, as you take one tooth of the other, and scrape it, and cut off its extremities from both sides.**
Deinde scinde locum doloris in tempore cum phlebotomo lato, donec fiat in eo locus sub cute, in quo dens capitur.	**Then cut the place of pain at a time with the phlebotomator on one side, until it becomes in it a place under the skin, where the bone is captured.**
Intromitte ergo eum in ipso sub cute, donec occultetur: deinde stringe super ipsum cum puluillo constrictione decenti, et dimitte ipsum quantitate quindecim horarum deinde solue eum, et extrahe allium, et dimitteuulnus duobus diebus, aut tribus: postea pone super ipsum cotum submersum in butyro, donec locus efficiat pus: deinde cura ipsum cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	**Then insert it into that place under the skin, until it is concealed:** then bind it with a constrictive string that descends, and let go of it in quantity of fifteen hours then dissolve it, and remove the other, and let it be for two days, or three: then put a cloth over it soaked in butter, until that place makes pus: then care for the pus with ointment until it heals.**
Et si uis fac illud cum quibusdam medicinis comburentibus, quas ego scripsi in tractatu duodecimo, de Medieinis adurentibus.	**And if you want to make that place with some medicines that burn, which I have written in the twelfth chapter of The Medications That Burn.**
Cauterizatio uero eius cum ferro, est secundum hunc modum.	**But cauterization with iron is according to this method:**
Igni Cauterium, cuius forma haec est.	The fire cautery, whose form is this.
Et nominatur Clauilis: quoniam forma capitis eius est sicut forma claui, in quo est quiddam curuitatis, et in medio eius est quaedam eminentia parua.	And it is called the "clavis" (key): because the form of his head is like the form of a key, in which there is something like a knot, and in the middle of it there is a small eminence.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum, et retine manum tuam: et tu reuolue ferrum paulatim cum uelocitate: et sit quantitas quae aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, sicut medietas eius.	Then put the iron itself on the spot, and hold your hand: and you shall turn the iron slowly with speed: and let the quantity that is burned from the thickness of the skin be like its half.
Et eleua manum tuam, ut non aduratur arteria, quae est inferius, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And draw your hand away, so that the artery which is below does not burn, and do not let the blood flow.
Deinde imbibe cotum in aqua salis, et pone super locum, et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus: deinde pone cotum cum butyro: postea cura cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Then dip the cloth in salt water and place it on the spot, and leave it for three days: then dip the cloth with butter: afterwards treat it with ointment until it is healed.
Et si uis, cauteriza hanc hemicraniam cum extremitate cultellari secunda Cauterii.	And if you want, cauterize this headache with the second cautery of the blade.
Et caue ab incisione arteriae in hac hemicrania, non antiqua proprie.	And do not cut the artery in this headache, but cut it with your own hand.
¶ De modo cauteriezandi in hemicrania antiqua.	The mode of cauterizing in a headaches.
Caput V.	Head.
Quando curas hemicraniam, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione praecedente, et quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio: et uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei quod diximus ex cauterio primo cum medicina, aut cum cauterio cum igne, tunc oportet ut ignias Cauterium cultellare, donec albificetur postquam signas super locum doloris cum linea, cuius longitudo sit medietas digiti, aut quasi illud: et depone manum tuam uice una, et stringe eam donec incidas arteriam, et peruenias usque ad os.	When you cure a headache, with the fact that we have said before in the preceding cure, and which we have said in the division of diseases, and does not be cured: and you shall see from sickness, that it is not enough to him what we have said from the first cautery with medicine, or with cautery with fire, then it is necessary that you should put the fire cautery with a blade, until the white turns after putting the signs on the spot of pain with a line, whose length is half a finger, or nearly so: and set your hand by the edge, and squeeze it until you touch the artery, and reach it up to the mouth.
Verumtamen necesse est tibi, ut caueas a continuatione mandibulae, quae mouetur apud masticationem, ne aduratur latus, aut neruus qui mouet ipsam, unde accidat spasmus.	However, you must, in order to cauterize the jaw bone, which moves when it grinds, so that it does not burn on the side, or nerve which moves it, from which comes a spasm.
Et esto super custotiam, et cautelam de fluxu sanguinis arteriae, quae abscisa est.	And this over the protection and care against the flow of blood from the artery, which has been cut off.
In abscisione enim eius est timor, et praecipue ei qui ignorat illud quod facit, et non est studiosus, nec expertus: et dimittit operationem cum eo in primis.	For in the dissection there is fear, and above all things he who does not know that which he does, and is not studious nor expert: and he ceases the operation with him at first.
Et ego ueniam cum rememoratione regiminis fluxus sanguinis accidentis ex arteria secundum modum suum, et in loco suo huius libri.	And I come with remembrance of the management of the flow of blood from an artery in a second way, and in its place in this book.
Quod si uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei hoc Cauterium, et uides corpus infirmi tolerans cauterium in medio capitis, sicut narrauimus, cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	That if you see from illness that this cautery is not sufficient to him, and you see the body enduring cautery in the middle of the head, as we have narrated, take care of the wound, until it is healed.
Et si uis, administra Cauterium, quod diximus in capitulo extractionis arteriae cum Cauterio habente duos cultellos.	And if you want to, administer Cautery, which we have said in the chapter of the extraction of the artery with cautery having two scissor-like tools.
Est enim cauterizatio melior hac et magis conferens.	For cauterization is better and gives more benefit in this way.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Aurium.	Regarding the method of cauterizing for ear pain.
Caput VI.	Chapter VI.
Quando accidit in Aure dolor a frigore, et curatur cum solutiuis, et reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione, et non remouetur dolor, tunc igni Cauterium: et est illud quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma est haec.	When it happens in the ear pain from cold, and is cured with solutions, and remaining cure as we have said in the division, and does not remove the pain, then the fire cautery: and that is what is called a dot, whose shape is this.
Deinde puncta cum eo post eius ignitionem in circumitu auris totius, sicut reuoluitur: aut in circumitu utriusque, si simul dolor est in utrisque.	Then the dots with it after its burning in the circumference of the whole ear, like a re-growth: or in the circumference of either one, if at the same time pain is in both.
Et elonga te cum Cauterio a radice auris parumper, postquam signaueris loca cum encaustro: et sit cauterii quantitas decem punctorum in omni aure, et quasi illa.	And make it long with cautery from the root of the ear slightly, after you have marked places with wax: and let be the amount of cautery ten points in all the ear, and almost those same.
Deinde cura loca, donec sanentur.	Then take care of the place, until they are healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tortura.	Regarding the method of cauterizing for torture:

Et deuita cauterizationem speciei, quae accidit ex exiccatione, et spasmo nerui.	And he abstained from cauterizing the wound, which occurred because of dehydration and muscle spasm.
Quando curas hanc speciem torturae cum hyeris, et caputpurgiis, et gargarismis, et non confert curatio tua, tunc oportet ut cauterizes infirmum tribus Cauteriis: uno apud radicem auris, et secundo parum inferius a timpore suo, et tertio apud coniunctionem duorum labiorum.	When you treat this wound of torture with hervium, and headpurifications, and gargarisms, and your cure does not help, then you should cauterize the sick with three cauterizations: one at the root of the ear, and a second little below its place, and a third at the junction of the two lips.
Et pone Cauterium tuum ex contrario partis infirmae.	And put your cautery on the opposite side of the weak part.
Quoniam mollificatio non accidit, nisi in parte quae apparet sana.	For softening does not occur unless in the part that appears healthy.
Et forma cauterizationis est, ut cauterizes ipsum Cauterio in directo extremitatis auris superioris sub cornu capitis parum: et alio in timpore: cuius longitudo sit secundum longitudinem pollicis.	And the form of the cautery is so that it cauterizes itself directly at the extreme tip of the upper ear next to the corner of the head a little bit: and with another one in time: whose length is according to the length of the thumb.
Et depone manum tuam cum cauterio, donec comburatur quantitas medietatis spissitudinis cutis.	And place your hand with the cautery, until a quantity of half the thickness of the skin is burned.
Et haec est forma Cauterii, et est species ex cultellari, cuius forma praemissa est: uerumtamen non est subtilior ea parum, sicut uides: et oportet ut sit cultellus in eo superfluae grossitudinis parum.	And this is the form of the cautery, and its kind is from a scalpel, whose form is as follows: verily it is not thinner than you see: and it is necessary that the scalpel be a little bit longer than that.
Deinde cura loca, cum eo quod praecessit: donec sanetur.	Then care for the place with what preceded it: until it heals.

Si autem indiges in aegritudine mollificatione corporis pluribus illis, et infirmus est tolerans, et aegritudo est fortis: tunc cauteriza ipsum quatuor cauteriis super spondiles dorsi, et ultima cum cauterio, donec comburatur ex cute plurimum eius, et eleua manum tuam.

And if the cause of melancholy is a surplusive closure to melancholy, and the body is damp, then give him a drink that will cleanse his brain, according to what has been said in the division: afterwards wash his head, and then make a wisp of linen into a loop, and twist it round like a circle.

In cauterio autem cum igne, praecipe infirmo ante illud, ut dimittat pilos suos, si est ex illis qui mundant eos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	In the cautery, however, with fire, direct the patient away from it, so that he does not shed his hair, if he is of those who clean them, until they have grown out and are even.
Si autem pungunt eum apud ortum suum: tunc constringe oculos eius cum uitta, ut non moueantur, donec nascantur.	But if it stings him near its origin: then squeeze the eyes with vitriolosy, so that they do not move, until they have healed.
Cum ergo nascuntur et aequantur, tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo: deinde signa super Palpebram oculorum eius cum encaustro, signo quod sit secundum figuram folii myrti: et sit principium signi prope pilos.	When they have healed and are even, then put the head in your lap: and then mark the eyelids of his eyes with encaustic, a mark that is according to the shape of the leaf of myrrh: and let the beginning of the mark be near the hair.
Deinde pone cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum.	Then put on the wound, either soaked in albumen or in the mucus of the ox's eye.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	Then put on fire the cautery whose form is this one.
Deinde cauteriza super figuram, quam signasti paulatim in uicibus multis, donec comburatur superficies cutis, quae est sicut figura folii myrti, totam apparentem proprie.	Then cauterize on the figure, which you have marked slowly on many wounds, until it is burned through the skin's surface, which appears like a laurel leaf, all by itself.
Et signum sanitatis operis tui est: ut si uideas Palpebram oculi iam contrahi, et pilos eleuari apud puncturam oculi.	And the sign of your work's health is: if you squeeze the eyelids of the eye and shave the hair near the eye's punctum.
Eleua ergo manum tuam tunc: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	So bless your hand then: and release him after three days.

And if you wish, dip the thread, or wrap it in cold butter, and place it on the tooth that hurts; and place hot iron upon it, until the fire penetrates deeply into the decayed part of the tooth.
Cauterizatio autem eius cum igne est, ut intendas ad cannulam aeris, aut cannulam ferri.	But cauterization with fire, so that you direct it towards the tube of air, or the tube of iron.

Deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma ueniet: et pone ipsum super illum dentem: et tene manum tuam, donec infrigidetur Cauterium.	Then take the fire-cauterizer, whose shape you have prepared; and place it on the tooth; and hold your hand, until the cauterizer cools down.
Fac illud aliquotiens, nam dolor remouebitur, aut in illo eodem die, aut die alio.	Do this sometimes, for the pain will be relieved, or do it on the same day, or on another day.
Et oportet in impressione illius Cauterii, ut impleat infirmus os suum buyro bono, et teneat ipsum hora una: deinde exspuat ipsum.	And it should be impressed into his bad breath so that it fills the sick mouth with good broth, and he should hold it for an hour: then spit it out.

And be careful not to move forward too quickly in the cauterization process, and remember that the skin is fragile; you don’t want it to get damaged because if it does, the whole body will suffer from the damage and the internal organs will be affected: for the skin there is a risk of damage.
¶ De modo cauterizandi apostemata Epatis.	The method for cauterizing the liver.
Caput XXX.	Chapter 30.
Quando accidit exitura, et uis scire, si illud apostema est in carne Epatis, aut in tunica eius: tunc si est in carne Epatis, inuadit infirmum dolor, et grauitas absque acuitate: et si est in tunica Epatis, cum dolore est acuitas uehemens: et uides iam, quia fatigauit medicos eius curatio.	When a liver abscess occurs and you need to know whether it is located in the liver itself or in its capsule, then if it is in the liver, you will see a painful ache, and there is little pain: but if it is in the capsule of the liver, then you will feel sharp pain; and you will see that the treatment of this hurts doctors.
Oportet ergo ut resupinet infirmus super ceruicem suam.	It is necessary so that the sick person rests on their bed.
Deinde figura locum apostematis cum encaustro: deinde ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	Then, the shape of the location of the abscess with the caustic: then, the fire of the cautery so that it is absorbed by radiation.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et cauteriza cum eo cauterium unum, donec comburatur cutis tota, et perueniat ad siphac, donec egrediatur sanies tota: deinde cura ipsum curatione exiturarum, donec sanetur.	And cauterize it with one cautery tool until the skin is completely burned and reaches the nipple, then, take care of the cure for the healed abscesses, until they are healed.
Et non oportet ut hac cauterii specie utatur, nisi cuius studium in arte medicinae prolongatur: et per cuius manus concurrunt aegritudines istae cum experimento aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super huiusmodi operationem.	And it is not necessary for this cautery tool to appear in a certain way unless the study of medicine is prolonged: and because of this experience, sometimes some diseases can be treated with great care; then, let one dare to perform such an operation.
At uero dimittere ipsam, apud me est melius.	But, I prefer to send it away.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Pleuresi.	The method for cauterizing in pleurisy.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter 31.
Dixerunt antiqui, cauterium cum radicibus aristolochiae ad Pleuresim frigidam secundum hunc modum.	The ancient ones said that the cautery of pleurisy was made with roots of aristaochia, according to this method.
Et est, ut recipias ex radicibus aristolochiae siccae longae, radicem unam longiorem, quae ex ea inuenitur, et sit sicut grossitudo digiti.	And take from the dry stems of aristaochia a long root, which is found in it, and make it be like the thickness of the finger.
Deinde submerge eam in oleo: et accende ipsam in igne.	Then immerse it in oil and set fire to it.
Deinde cauteriza cauterio uno in eo quod est inter continuationem furculae cum collo, et duobus cauteriis paruis sub guidezi parum decliuibus ad partem, quae est sub barba.	Then cauterize with one cauldron between the continuation of the fork with the neck, and two small caldrons little declined on the part that is under the beard.
Et duobus cauteriis etiam in eo, quod est inter costam quintam et sextam decliuibus ad posteriora parumper: et cauterio alio in medio pectoris, et alio supra stomachum.	And two caldrons also in it, that is between the fifth and sixth ribs little declined on the back: and a cauldron other in the middle of the chest, and another above the stomach.
Et tribus cauteriis a posterioribus: uno in eo quod est inter duas spatulas: et duobus cauteriis a duobus lateribus pectoris, inferius cauterio quod est inter duas spatulas.	And three caldrons behind: one in it that is between two spatulas: and two caldrons on the sides of the chest, lower cauldron that is between two spatulas.
Et non oportet ut comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit in manifesto cutis odorando.	And do not need to squeeze your hand with the cauldron, but let it be in the open skin smelling.
Et iam dixerunt quidam antiqui, quod ex hominibus sunt qui utuntur cauterio ex ferro simili radio: et igniunt, et intus mittunt ipsum in eo quod est inter costas, donec perueniatur cum eo ad ipsum apostema, et egrediatur sanies: sicut diximus in apostemate Epatis.	And some ancient people said that who use a cauldron of iron similar in radius: and light it up, and put it inside him that is between the ribs until it reaches with it to the apostema, and comes out pus: as we have said in the apostema of the liver.
Sed in hac perforatione cum cauterio est ex timore, quod aut moritur infirmus statim, aut accidit in loco fistula, cui non est sanatio.	But in this piercing with the cauldron is out of fear that either dies weak immediately, or happens in place fistula, which there is no cure.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Splenem Caput XXXII.	The mode of cauterizing The Spleen Head IIII.
Quando tu curas aegritudinem splenis, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua, tunc cauterium in ea est secundum tres modos, qui omnes sunt recti.	When you cure the disease of the spleen, with him that we have said in dividing diseases, and your cure does not bring forth, then cauterize it is in it according to three modes, which are all straight.
Quorum unus est, ut facias tria cauteria, aut quatuor lineando secundum longitudinem splenis secundum figuram cauteriorum Epatis, quorum praecessit figura.	Of which one is, that you make three caldrons or four linear according to the length of the spleen according to the figure of cauterization of the liver, whose preceded the figure.
Et sit inter omne cauterium quantitas grossitudinis digiti, aut plus parum.	And let there be between every cauldron quantity of thickness of the finger, or less.
Et sit modus cauterii, quem diximus in cauterio epatis aequaliter.	And let there be a certain mode of the cautery, which we have spoken of in the surgery of the liver equally.
Et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio: et sit infirmus resupinus super dorsum suum.	And do not compress your hand with the cautery; and let the sick one lie on his back.
Et modus alius de cauterizatione est: ut ignias cauterium habens duo uerua, quod diximus in capitulo dislocationis humeri: et eleua cutem, quae est in directo splenis, ubi peruenit cubitus infirmi sinister: et sit eleuatio tua qua eleuas cutem secundum latitudinem corporis, ut cadant cauteria secundum longitudinem corporis.	And another mode of cauterization is: that the cautery has two ends, which we have spoken of in the chapter on shoulder dislocations: and wipe the skin, which is straight in front of the spine, where it reaches the bed on the left side; and let your elevation be as you wipe the skin according to the width of the body, so that the cauteries fall according to the length of the body.
Deinde intromitte duo uerua ignita ualde, donec cum eis penetres cutem a parte altera: deinde extrahe cauterium: fiunt ergo cauteria quatuor.	Then introduce the two hot ends until you penetrate them into the skin from the other part; then remove the cautery: so there are four cauteries.
Et si uis cauteriza cum cauterio alio habente tria uerua.	And if you want to cauterize with a cautery that has three ends.
Deinde cura cauterium postquam dimittis ipsum emittere pus diebus multis: est enim magis conferens quamque reliqua quae praecesserunt ex curatione.	Then care for the cautery after you have removed it, as it emits pus over many days: because it is more effective if the remaining parts that have preceded in the cure are removed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Hydropisi.	The mode of cauterization in Hydropsis.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter 33.
Cauterium non cadit in Hydropisi, nisi ascliti proprie.	The cautery does not fall in Hydropsis, unless it is properly raised.
Quando tu curas Hydropicum cum modis curationis, quos diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, et cauterio uno super stomachum, et cauterio alio super epar, et cauterio super splenem, et cauteriis duobus post dorsum inter spondiles, et uno in directo pectoris, et alio in directo stomachi: et sit quantitas profunditatis cauterii propinqua spissitudini cutis.	When you treat Hydropsis with the modes of cure which we have spoken of in the division, and there is no effect from the cure, then you should cauterize four times around the navel, and one on the stomach, and one on the liver, and one on the spleen, and two behind the back between the vertebrae, and one directly on the chest, and one directly on the stomach: and let the depth of the cautery be close to the thickness of the skin.
Deinde dimitte cauterium apertum, ut emittat pus tempore longo.	Then remove the cautery open, so that it emits pus over a long period of time.
Et non euacues infirmum a curatione post cauterium cum eo: quod oportet ut aggregentur ei duae intentiones: et festinabit ad ipsum sanatio cum auxilio Dei.	And do not wet the sick one after cauterization with that, for two intentions need to be added to it; and will hasten to recover by the help of God.
Forma uero cauterii cum quo cauterizatur uenter, sit clauilis: secundum quod praecessit forma eius: et illius cum quo cauterizatur dorsum, sit oliuaris secundum quod praecessit eius forma.	Indeed the shape of the cautery with which the stomach is cauterized, should be closed; because the shape preceded it; and with respect to its shape, when the back is cauterized, it should be oliwary.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Pedes, et Crura.	Regarding the method of cauterizing the feet and legs:
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter IIII. regarding the head.
Quando apostemantur in Hydropico, et replentur aqua citrina: oportet ut cauterizes super dorsum Pedis in nocrati, quae est inter auricularem et anularem: et eleua manum tuam cum cauterio, et non torqueas ipsum: deinde eleua manum tuam: et non iteres ipsum omnino.	When they are laid in the hypospasm and become filled with yellow water: you should cauterize over the back of the foot in the nocrati, which is between the auricular and the ring: and wash your hand with the cautery, and do not twist it: then wash your hand: and do not repeat it at all.
Resudet enim aqua citrina, et sit cauterium secundum hanc formam.	For the yellow water, the shape of the cautery should be as follows.
Deinde fac super duo crura duo cauteria in omni crure, et fiat cauterium cum extremitate cultellari cauterii: et fiat cauterium secundum longitudinem cruris, unum sub genu, et alterum inferius eo, circiter medium cruris: et super omnem coxam cauteria duo: et dimitte cauterium apertum absque curatione tempore longo: ut resudet ex eo aliquod aquae: deinde cura ipsum cum reliquis quae diximus.	Then make two cauteries on both legs, and the shape of the blade of the cautery should be at the end of a knife-edge cautery: and the shape of the cautery according to the length of the leg, one below the knee, and the other lower than that, about in the middle of the leg: and two cauteries on all the loins: and do not close the cauterium for a long time: so that it returns from it some water: then care for it with the rest as we have said.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in solutione Ventris.	Regarding the method of cauterizing in the solution of the abdomen:
Caput XXXV.	Chapter XXV. regarding the head.
Quando est solutio uentris ex frigore et humiditatibus, donec debilitet uirtutes retentiuam et digestiuam, quae sunt in stomacho et intestinis: et curatur illud cum modis curationis, et non sanatur: et uides infirmum tolerantem cauterium exuberantis uirtutis, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio magno super stomachum suum, secundum quod praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi cum cauterio circuli, et quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici subtilibus, cum cauterio clauili subtili: et cauterio super alcatin supra alhosos magno, aut duobus cauteriis.	When the solution of the abdomen is weakened by cold and moist things that are retained in the stomach and intestines: and treat it with a method of cauterization, and does not heal: and you will see that it tolerates the cautery with great vigor, then cauterize it with a large cautery over its stomach, according to the order preceding in cauterizing the stomach with a circular cautery and four small cauteries around the navel, with a thin knife-edge cautery: and a large cautery on the alcatine above the loins, or two large cauteries.
Et si uides humiditates exuberantes, et infirmum tolerantem illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio super pectinem, et cauterio super omne ilium: et fortasse addes duo cauteria parua super stomachum prope magnum.	And if you see abundant moistness and the disorder tolerates it, then cauterize it over the pelvis and over all the loins: and perhaps you should add two small cauteries next to the large one on the stomach.
Est enim curatio proficiens, cuius iuuamentum non errat.	For the cure is perfect in those for whom it is not a mistake.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Hemorroidas.	As for the method of cauterizing hemorrhoids.
Caput XXXVI.	Head 36.
Quando in ano sunt Hemorroides antiquae multae, aut una, et sunt ex humoribus grossis, frigidis, aut humiditatibus corruptis, et curantur cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: tunc cauteriza tribus cauteriis super inferiorem spondilem dorsi sub almeidati parumper triangulatim, et cauterio sub umbilico quasi duobus digitis.	When the hemorrhoids are ancient and many, or one, and they are of gross humors, cold, or corrupt moistures, and they are treated with that which we have said in the division, and the cure does not occur: then cauterize three cauterizations on the lower spine of the back under an amulet a little triangular, and cauterization under the navel almost two fingers.
Et si cogitas, quod stomachus eius infrigidatus sit, et cibus eius non digeratur, et faciem eius uides apostemari, tunc cauteriza eum super stomachum cauterio magno, secundum quod praecessit: et cauterio super Epar eius, et alio super Splenem ipsius, cum cauterio clauili: et dimitte cauterium apertum tempore aliquo: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if you think that his stomach is cold and his food is not digested, and you see that his face is pale, then cauterize him on the stomach with a large cautery, according to what preceded: and cauterize on his epigastrium, and another on his spleen, with another on his clavicle: and leave the cautery open for some time: then cure him himself, until he is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi althelul post abscisionem eorum.	As for the method of cauterizing athelomas after their amputation.
Caput XXXVII.	Head 37.
Quando tu abscindis althelul, tunc ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	When you cut off the atheloma, then light the cautery that is absorbed with a rayon.
Deinde intromittite ipsum ignitum in ipsum althelul abscisum: et ultima manum tuam, donec perueniat cauterium ad orificium uenae, ex qua currit sanguis: fac illud semel, aut bis.	Then introduce the lit cautery into the atheloma that has been cut off: and last, with your hand, until the cautery reaches the orifice of the gut, from which blood flows: do it once, or twice.
Si ergo althelul fuerint multa, tunc cauteriza unumquodque cauterio secundum quod narrauimus.	If then there are many athelomas, then cauterize each one with a cautery, according to what we have said.
Deinde cura ea, cum eo quod confert eis ex unguentis, donec sanentur.	Then cure them, with the unguent that is given to them, until they are healed.
Et si cauterizas eum cauterio magno super alcatin, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if you cauterize him with a large cautery on the alcatine, it is more final in the treatment.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Fistulam in ano.	As for the method of cauterizing the fistula in the anus.
Caput XXXVIII.	Head 38.
Quando non obedit infirmus sectioni et operi quod narrauimus in loco suo, et terretur ab illo, fortasse sanatur cum cauterio.	When the sick person does not submit to the section and the work we have described in its place, and trembles because of it, perhaps he will be healed with a cautery.
Cum ergo accidit alicui Fistula, et antiquatur, currit pus ex ea, et humiditates corruptae.	So then when a fistula occurs in someone and it is old, pus runs out of it, and corrupted moisture.
Dignius ergo quod oportet est, ut probes eam cum tenta subtili.	Dignified indeed is it that one should test it with subtle attempts when a wound has occurred.
Deinde cognosce quantitatem profunditatis eius cum tenta.	Then later know the depth of its extent when you attempt it.
Deinde ignias cauterium, quod est simile radio.	Then later use a cautery fire that is like a ray.
Deinde intromit te ipsum ignitum in ipsam Fistulam et quantitatem in qua intrauit clauus.	Then later insert yourself with the ignited thing into the fistula and the quantity in which it enters, seal it up.
Et itera super eam cauterium, donec comburantur illa omnia corpora corrupta, semel, aut bis, aut ter, secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	And repeatedly pass the cautery over it until all those corrupt bodies are burned up, once, or twice, or three times, according to the extent of your need.
Et custodi te ab adustione nerui, si est illic, aut uenae magnae: aut si Fistula uadit ad corpus uesicae, aut ad corpus intestini, tunc custodi te ab istis locis omnibus.	And guard yourself against any dry heat, if there is one there, or great blisters: or if the fistula opens into a part of the body of the uterus, or of the intestines, then guard yourself from all such places.
Et non facias illud, nisi quando fistula est in loco carnoso: et cogitas, quia non est penetrans.	And do not make this unless the fistula is in a fleshy place: and think, for it does not pierce.
Deinde cura locum usquequo sanetur.	Then take care of the place until it heals.
Si autem sigillatur locus, et abscinduntur ab eo materiae, et remanet sic tempore longo: tunc scias, quia iam sanatus est integre.	But if the place is sealed and the materials are cut away from it, and it remains so for a long time: then you shall know that it has now been completely healed.
Et si non abscindunt ab eo materiae, tunc scias quia est penetrans, aut in profundo eius est os corruptum, aut quasi illud ex illis: quorum rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And if the materials are not cut away from it, then you shall know that it is piercing, or there is a corrupt opening within it, or almost like those things: of whose remembrance the place itself will be a sign.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Renes.	The way to cauterize Renes.
Caput XXXIX.	Chapter 39.
Quando accidit in Renibus dolor ex frigore, aut ex uentositate grossa, et minuitur propter illud coius infirmi, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum super almethenem super ipsos renes, cauterio super omnem renem cum cauterio clauili, cuius praecessit rememoratio.	When pain occurs in the kidneys from cold, or from a thick wind, and it keeps because of that urinary fever, then one should cauterize himself above the loins on both sides over the kidneys, cauterizing each kidney with a cautery clauius, whose predecessor was remembrance.
Et fortasse cauterizamus ipsum secundo in ipso almeidatu.	And perhaps we have cauterized it again in that same place.
Quare uenient tria lineata.	Why are there three stripes?
Ergo erunt magis ultima in iuuamento.	So then shall be the last ones in the binding.
¶ De modo cauteritzandi Vesicam.	The way to cauterize the vesica.
Caput XL.	Head Forty.
Quando accidunt in Vesica debilitas, et mollificatio a frigo re et humiditatibus, donec non retineat infirmus urinam, tunc cauteriza ipsum in inferiori parte suminis super Vesicam, ubi incipiunt pili pectinis, et cauterio a dextra suminis, et alio a sinistra illius: et sit longitudo illius cauterizationis lateris secundum quantitatem nodi pollicis: et cauteriza ipsum cauterio inferiori dorsi, aut duobus cauteriis, si indiges illo: et sit secundum quod praecessit cauterium clauile.	When there is weakness and softening in the bladder from cold and moisture, until it does not retain urine, then cauterize the body below the suprapubian skin on the bladder where the hairs grow between them, and the cautery on the right side below the pubic bone, and another on the left side; and let the length of the cautery on the back be according to the quantity of the knuckle of the thumb: and cauterize it with two cauteries if you can bear it. And let the nail clipper be used for cauterizing.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Matricem.	The way to cauterize the matri
Caput XLI.	Head Forty-One.
Quando accidunt in Matrice frigus et humiditates, et prohibetur per illud ab impregnatione, et corrumpuntur menstrua eius, et tardatur prouocatio eorum, et accidit ei apud aduentum eorum dolor, tunc oportet ut cauterizetur tribus cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, sicut diximus in cauterizatione uesicae, et cauterio super alcatim inferius dorso, aut duobus cauteriis: et sit cauterium clauile.	When there is cold and moisture in the uterus, and it is prevented from becoming impregnated, and her menstruation corrupts and her inducement is delayed, and pain occurs when she is with her husband, then three cauteries should be applied around the umbilical region as we have said for the cauterizing of the bladder, and one cautery below the back on the alcach, or two; and let the nail clipper be used for cauterizing.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Ancham in dislocatione.	The way to cauterize the anus in a dislocation.
Caput XLII.	Head Forty-Two.
Quando effunduntur humiditates mucosae ad pixidem Anchae, et fiunt caussa exitus eius a loco suo: et signum illius est, quod prolongatur crus super alterum, quando comparantur adinuicem: et inuenitur locus dislocationis in eo uacuus.	When the mucous membrane of the anus flows out with moisture and causes the exit of waste from its place: and the sign of this is that the flesh prolongs over one side when they are facing each other; and the location of the dislocation is found to be empty.
Oportet ergo ut cauterizes infirmum super pixidem Anchae ipsius cauterio simili circulo: postquam tu signas cum encaustro in circumitu pixidis, sicut reuoluitur: et ut cadat ipsa pixis in medio circuli.	Then let the sick person be cauterized over the anus with a similar circle of the same cautery: after you have found the signs with the caustice around the anus, as it recedes: and so that it falls on the middle of the circle.
Et sit cauterium cuius forma praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi.	And let the shape of the one that preceded in the cauterizing of the stomach be used for cauterizing.
Quod si tibi non est praesens hoc cauterium, tunc cauteriza ipsum tribus cauteriis, cum cauterio oliuari magno: et fiat cauterio profunditas secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis totius.	If this cautery is not present with you, then cauterize it with three cauteries, with a large olive oil cautery; and let the depth of the cautery be according to the thickness of the skin of all.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Afterwards, care for yourself, until you are healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Sciatica.	The way to cauterize the sciatic nerve.
Caput XLIII.	Chapter LIII.
Quando accidit dolor in pixide anchae, et sunt caussa illius frigus et humiditates: et curatur infirmus cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, et antiquatur illud: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum ab humoribus grossis cum pillulis foetidis, aut cum pillulis artificialibus, et similibus.	When pain occurs in the ankle joint, and there is a cause for this pain, cold and moisture: care for the sick with it, since we have said in the division, and there is no cure, and it becomes stale: then it is necessary that you separate the sick from thick humors with foul pills, or with artificial pills, and others.
Deinde cauteriza eum.	Then cauterize it.
Et modus cauterii in ea est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum medicinis adurentibus, aut cauterium cum igne.	And the method of cauterization in her is according to two ways: either with cauterizing medicines applied, or with fire.
Cauterium cum igne, est secundum multos modos.	The cauterizing with fire, is according to many ways.
Quorum unus est, ut cauterizes super pixidem anchae ipsius tribus cauteriis triangulatis, secundum hanc formam.	Of which one is that, as it cauterizes on top of the ankle joint, three triangular cauldron-shaped.
Et fac eis profunditatem bonam, uel malam.	And make them a good depth, or bad.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium quantitatis grossitudinis digiti: sitque cauterium oliuare.	And there should be a space which is between each cauterization the quantity of the size of a thumb: and let the cauldron be oiled.
Quandoque autem fit cauterium in medio super caput anchae ipsius.	When, however, it is necessary to make the cauterizing in the middle on top of the ankle joint itself.
Quare sunt quatuor cauteria.	Why are there four cauldron-shaped things?
Et si uis cauteriza cum circulo, cuius praecessit forma in cauterizatione dislocationis anchae, uno: ut sit circulus continens ancham totam.	And if you want to cauterize with a circle, whose predecessor is the form of the dislocation of the ankle joint, one: so that it includes the whole ankle.
Et combure spissitudinem cutis totius.	And burn the thickness of the skin of all.
Iste est modus cauterii in Sciatica, quando dolor est adhaerens anchae ipsi, et non extenditur usque ad coxam et crus.	This is the method of cauterization in the sciatic nerve, when the pain adheres to the ankle itself, and does not extend up to the hip and the leg.
Si autem extenditur usque ad coxam et crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis super coxam, super locum ad quem innuit illic infirmus, in quo est dolor, et cauterio tuo super cauillam quatuor digitis ad partem syluestrem parumper: et sit cauterium cultellare.	But if it extends up to the hip and the leg, then cauterize it on both sides of the hip, on the spot where the pain is felt, and cauterize it with your knife a little bit on the shin bone, four fingers wide: and let the cauldron be sharp.
Et sit profunditas cauterii secundum profunditatem spissitudinis cutis.	And make the depth of the cauterizing according to the depth of the thickness of the skin.
Quod si infirmus innuit quod dolor extenditur usque prope digitos pedis, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic ubi innuit cum cauterio puncti, tribus, aut quatuor, aut pluribus, si indiget illo.	If the sick one complains that the pain extends to near the toes, then cauterize him at that place with a point, three, four, or more, if he needs it.
Et si innuit dolorem esse sub genu uersus crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic cauterio uno cultellari.	And if he complains of pain under the knee towards the thigh, then cauterize him at that place with a single knife.
Et caue tibi in omni cauterizatione tua, ut non ultimes cum cauterio ad hoc ut comburas neruum, aut arteriam magnam, et attrahas per illud super infirmum nocumentum malum, aut contractionem.	And so that you may not finish with the cauterization and burn the flesh, or a large artery, and attract trouble for yourself through it on the sick person's body, or contraction.
Et ego quidem iam uidi unum et alium, ex eis qui cauterizauerunt supra cauillam, et ultimauerunt in cauterizatione, et inflatum est crus, donec tumor consecutus est pedem, et perforatus est totus, et corruptus est totus pes: deinde accidit solutio uentris, et mors post illud.	And I have already seen one and the other who cauterized above the knee and finished with the cauterization, and the leg swelled until it reached the foot, and it was completely corroded, and then the water of the wound resolved, and death followed afterwards.
Quod si dolor est in duabus partibus simul, cauteriza utramque secundum hunc modum.	That if the pain is in two parts at the same time, cauterize each one according to this method.
Et sapientes quidam dixerunt in cauterizatione anchae, cuius cauterii iste est modus.	And some wise men have said in the cauterization of the anus, whose cauterization is this mode.
Fac simile samio ex ferro, cuius diametrus sit medietas palmi: et sit apud orificium suum secundum grossitudinem nuclei dactyli, aut minus parumper: et intra illud samium sit samium tertium.	Make a similar model from iron, whose diameter is half the size of the palm: and place it at the opening according to the thickness of the nail, or less than that: and within that third piece, another third.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne samium per quantitatem nodi pollicis: et sint samia aperta a duabus partibus: et sit altitudo eorum quasi nodus, aut duo nodi: et fac eis manubrium ex ferro decenter aptatum in samiis.	And place between each finger according to the quantity of the nail's knot: and let there be openings on both sides: and make their height almost like a knot, or two knots: and let them make the handle from iron bent unevenly in the fingers.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Deinde igniatur in igne, donec rubeat, et proiiciat scintillas: deinde ponatur super pixidem anchae infirmo accubitato super latus sanum.	Then let it be burned in fire until it turns red, and let sparks be thrown off: then let it be placed on a tray of mud at the sick person' side lying on the sound side.
Cauteriza ergo eum tribus cauteriis rotundis in uice una.	Then cauterize him with three round cauterizations in a line.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then let go of him after three days.
Postea emplastra cum butyro: et dimitte uulnus apertum diebus multis.	Then bind it with butter: and let the wound remain open for many days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then treat yourself with ointment until healed.
Inquit Albucasis, hac specie cauterii o filii, parum usi sumus, propter terrorem aspectus eius: et propterea, quod paucos inuenimus qui expectent super ipsum.	Albucasius says, with this kind of burn, we use a little because of the appearance of fear: and therefore, because there are few who wait on him.
Verumtamen est ex bonis cauteriis ei qui suffert, et inuenit cum eo locum eius.	However, it is good for him who suffers from this, and he finds his place with him.
Cauterium autem cum medicinis adurentibus est, ut tu facias duo samia habentia perforatam armillam, in quam descendit cardo portae eius ex aere, aut ferro, longitudo parietis: quorum in altitudinem eorum sint duo nodi, aut quasi ipsi.	But the cautery when you are burning, so that you make two strong loops, in which the rod of his door descends from brass or iron, its length being on the sides: their two knots, or almost like himself.
Et sit spacium quod est inter utraque quantitas grossitudinis digiti, et sint aperta inferius et superius: et sit quod contineant se adinuicem, secundum hanc formam.	And there is a space between the two, which is the length of the finger's thickness, and are open below and above: and that they contain themselves in this form.
Deinde depone eam super pixidem anchae, infirmo iacente super latus sanum.	Then put it on a plate of salt, the sick man lying on his healthy side.
Et comprime manum tuam super pixidem anchae multum.	And compress your hand very much over the salt plate.
Deinde funde inter duos circulos ex aqua calida, quae sit calefacta cum igne parumper, et tene eam quantitate horae temporalis: et toleret infirmus mordicationem eius, et ipsius adustionem, nam ipse inuenit mordicationem sicut ignis, donec quiescat mordicatio.	Then pour between the two circles of warm water, which is a little heated with fire, and hold it for an hour: and let the sick person feel a tingling on him, and his own burning, for he finds the tingling like fire, until he sleeps.
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum instrumento, et absterge aquam calidam ab ancha tota cum aqua dulci: deinde dimitte illud tribus diebus.	Then wipe your hand with an instrument and wash it completely with sweet water: then let go of it for three days.
Et pone super illud butyrum, donec remoueatur nigredo adustionis: et dimitte illud diebus aliquot, et curret ex eo pus.	And put on the butter until the blackness of burning is removed: and let go of it for a few days, and wash out the pus.
Est enim ultimum in iuuamento.	It is finally in healing.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat that with ointment until healed.
Quod si extendatur dolor usque ad coxam, aut crus: fac ei statuam in eo quod continet aquam, secundum quod fecisti in ancha aequaliter.	If the pain extends to the hip or wound: let him have a standing position in it that holds water, according to what you did in the wide one.
Et iste est modus aquae calidae: et ego iam scripsi eam in tractatu rectificationis medicinarum.	And this is the way of warm water: and I have already written about it in the book on the correction of medicines.
Sume alcali, et calcis non extinctae amborum ana partem unam: tere utraque, et pone ea in ollam nouam, cuius inferior pars sit perforata foramine uno paruo, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum radius: et pone sub fundo ollae ollam aliam uitreatam: et proiice super alcali et calcem ex aqua dulci, quod submergat utraque per digitum: post quam tu comprimas ea manu tua compressione bona: et dimite ollam, donec descendat aqua acuta inferiori parte ollae uitreatae.	Take the alkali and raw calcin, both of which are on one side: pour them both out, and put them in a new bowl, whose lower part is pierced with a small hole, according to the quantity that is added into it, radii: and put under the bottom of the bowl another one poured. And throw over the alkali and raw calcin with sweet water, so that they are submerged by one finger: then you squeeze them with your hand good compression: and let go of the bowl, until the sharp water comes out at the lower part of the bowl uitreatam.
Deinde aggrega illam aquam totam, et proiice eam super aliam calcem: et cola, donec renouetur.	Then join together the whole water and throw it on another stone: and scratch, until it heals over again.
Ipsa enim erit tunc fortis acuitatis ualde, quae administratur in multis operationibus medicinae, et in cauterizatione reliquorum membrorum.	For she will then be very strong and keen, which is used in many surgical procedures and also in the cauterization of the remaining limbs.
Quoniam efficit operationem ignis ipsius.	For it will perform the operation of fire itself.
Et ex medicinis sunt, cum quibus cauterizantur ancha, etiam sicut tesisie, et mel anacardi, et calx cum sapone, ita quod utraque sint permixta. ¶	And from the medicines, with which they cauterize the broad, also like theriac, and honey of acorns, and lime mixed with soap, so that both are mixed together.
Et Galenus quidem narrando retulit, cuiusdam uiri ex antiquis curationem, qua curatus est dolor anchae et uenae sciaticae: et magnificauit esse eius ualde.	And Galen himself related, telling of a man from ancient times who was cured of pain in the ankle and sciatic nerve: and he magnified that it was very effective.
Et dixit, quia non indiguit alia curatione, et quia sanatus est ex uice una, donec retulit, quia ipse fortasse intrauit balneum delatus, et exiuit ex eo iam sanus.	And he said, "I do not know of another cure," and that he was cured from one joint, until he told, "Perhaps I entered the warm bath, and came out already healed.
Et est, ut accipiatur ex seitaragi uiridi: et si non inuenitur uiride, sumatur siccum, recens: et teratur multum cum aliquanto adipe, et ponatur super ancham, ubi est dolor, aut crus, aut in coxa: et ligetur, et dimittatur quantitate trium horarum, aut per quantitatem quod sentiat infirmus sedationem adustionis.	And it is taken from the joint of the thumb: and if it is not found in the thumb, it is taken so, freshly cut: and placed on the ankle, where the pain is, or in the hip, or tied up and left for a time, three hours, or as much as the sick person feels a sedative pain.
Deinde intromitte eum in balneum.	Then introduce it into the bath.
Cum ergo roridum fit corpus eius, intromitte ipsum in solium.	When therefore his body is wet with the water, introduce him into the saucer.
Nam dolor recedit, et sanatur.	For the pain has subsided, and he is healed.
Et scias, quia non oportet ut utatur aliquis cauterio cum istis medicinis, nisi post euacuationem corporis.	And you should know that it is not necessary to use any kind of treatment with these medicines, unless after the body has been evacuated.
Et Dioscorides qui dem dixit, quod stercus caprarum, quando cum eo cauterizatur uena sciatica, confert ei: et fit cauterium secundum hunc modum.	And Dioscorides who said, that when straw is mixed with him, when it is used to cauterize the sciatic nerve, it serves as a cautery: and becomes a cautery in this way.
Sumatur lana, et imbibatur oleo antiquo, et ponatur super locum profundum, qui est inter pollicem pedis, et inter focile, et est propinquior focili.	Take wool, and dip it in old oil, and place it on the deep place, which is between the thumb of the foot, and between the toe, and it is closer to the fire.
Deinde accipe stercus caprarum siccum, et inflamma ipsum in igne, donec fiat carbo.	Then take goat dung mixed with earth and heat it in fire until it becomes charcoal.
Deinde pone ipsum super lanam, et dimitte ipsum, donec extinguatur.	Then put the mixture on wool and leave it there until it is extinguished.
Deinde itera illud.	Then repeat this.
Non cesses ergo facere illud, usquequo perueniat sensus super mediatione usque ad ancham, et quiescat dolor.	So do not cease to perform this, until the sense has returned in the middle by way of length, and let the pain rest.
Et iste modus cauterii nominatur cauterium Vaccinum.	This mode of treatment is called vaccineum.
¶ De cauterizatione doloris Dorsi.	§ On the treatment for back pain.
Caput XLIIII.	Chapter 48.
Quandoque accidit dolor in Dorso ex caussis multis, aut a casu, aut a percussione, aut euacuatione superflua, et illis similibus, ex infusione materiei frigidae, et humidae: et cauterium quidem non cadit, nisi in hac specie sola, quae fit ex infusione materiei frigidae.	When pain occurs in the back for various reasons, or from accident, or from impact, or from excessive evacuation, and similar cases, with cold and moist material: and cauterization does not fall unless it is done alone in this manner only, which is done with an infusion of cold material.
Oportet ergo post euacuationem infirmi cum pillulis foetidis, et eis similibus, ut fiant super Dorsum, ubi est dolor, tres lineae secundum latitudinem almeidati ipsius, postquam signas cum encaustro in omni linea quinque cauteria, aut plura secundum quantitatem quae uenit ex tolerantia infirmi uirtute eius: et fiat cauterizatio cum cauteriopuncti.	It is necessary therefore after the evacuation to apply nurses with bitter pills and similar things so as to make them stand on the back where there is pain, three lines according to its width, after the marks have been made by the causticum on each line: five cauterizations, or more according to the quantity which comes from the patient's tolerance of the nurse's virtue: and let cauterization be made with a cauterization needle.
Et si uis, cauteriza tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor, cum cauterio clauili mediali, secundum hanc formam.	And if you wish, cauterize with three cauterizations, or four, with the middle closed, in this form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in incaeptine Gibbositatis.	§ On the method of cauterizing in gibbus.
Caput XLV.	Chapter 50.
Multotiens accidit haec aegritudo infantibus paruis.	This malady often occurs in small children.
Et signum incaeptionis eius in pueris est: quod accidit super eum strictura in anhelitu apud eleuationem, et motum: et inuenis in ultima spondilium Dorsi et nodorum eius, quod iam incaepit eminere super reliquos spondiles.	And the sign of the onset of this disease in children is that which occurs on him a stricture in swallowing during elevation and movement: and an inflammation in the last spondylum of the back and its nods, which has already begun to emerge above the other spondyles.
Cum ergo uides illud, et uis facere illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio quod sit circulus secundum hanc formam.	So when you see this and wish to do something about it, then cauterize the affected area with a needle which is a circle in the following form.
Et capiat cauterium super omnem partem spondilis aequaliter: et si uis cauteriza in circumitu spondilis cum cauterio puncti duas lineas, aut tres: et sint puncta propinqua adinuicem.	And he took cautery over all parts of the spine equally: and if you cauterize the spine with cautery two or three lines: and let the points be close to each other.
Deinde cura locum, donec sanetur cum eo quod diximus.	Then care for the place, until it heals with it what I have said.
Et caue, ne administres cauterium in gibbositate, quae fit in spasmo nerui.	And do not administer cautery to the hunchback, which is made in a spasm of nerve.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Podagra, et doloribus iuncturarum.	The mode of cauterizing in podagra and painful joints.
Caput XLVI.	Chapter XLV.
Quando dolores iuncturarum sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, quae effunduntur ad cuiuslibet membra corporis, tunc quando accidunt dolores in pedibus, de consuetudine medicorum est, ut nominent illud Podagram proprie.	When the pains of joint-aches are caused by cold dampnesses which spread to any part of the body, and when they occur in the feet, it is usual for doctors to call this podagra.
Cum ergo curatur Podagra frigidae caussae cum modis curationis, et non remouentur dolores, tune cauterium remouet eos.	How then should podagra be cured which is caused by cold, with methods of cure, and if the pains are not removed, then let them be removed by cautery.
Et est, ut cauterizes eum post euacuationem in circumitu iuncturae pedum, cauteriis multis: et sit cauterium Oliuare.	And it is as if he were cauterized after evacuation around the joint of the feet with many cautery: and let the cautery be Oülar.
Cuius haec est forma.	This is its form.
Et si indiges ut punctes super faciem pedis, tunc fac cum cauterio puncti.	And if you can bear it that the points are on the face of the foot, then do so with a single-point cautery.
Quod si ascendunt dolores usque ad genua, aut reliquas iuncturas, et multotiens accidit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super omne genu tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor ab omni parte, cum hoc eodem cauterio Clauili.	That if the pains ascend to the knees, or other joints, and often occur, then cauterize himself over all the knee with three or four cautery's, each from a different side, with this same cautery of Cloyl.
Si autem necessaria sunt tibi plura hoc cauterio, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	But if you need many of these cauteries, then cauterize himself.
Et non submergas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit circiter spissitudinem cutis tantum.	And do not submerge your hand with the cautery, but rather let there be a thin layer of skin around it.
Si autem ascendunt dolores ad genua, et dorsum: tunc administra quod diximus ex cauterio in capitulo suo.	But if the pains ascend to the knees and back: then administer what I have said about cautery in my book.
Quod si dolores sunt in manibus tantum, tunc puncta in circumitu focilium, sicut reuoluuntur duae lineae.	That if the pains are only in the hands, then points around a fire, as two lines rotate.
Si autem remanet ex doloribus in digitis, tunc puncta eos, super omnem nodum punctum, et super pectinem manus.	But if any of the pains remain in the fingers, then do so, each point over all the knuckle: and on the palm of the hand.
Si autem ascendunt dolores post dies ad cubitos, aut ad humeros, tunc cauteriza utrosque ab omni parte.	If, however, the pains rise after a few days to the shoulders, or to the arms, then cauterize both sides.
Et non euacues infirmum ex regimine bono, ex recaeptione medicinarum.	And do not let the sick person's disease improve with good regimen, or with the reception of medicines.
Nam si bonum fiat regimen, et euacuetur phlegma, sanabitur auxilio Dei cum isto cauterio.	For if the regimen is made good, and the phlegm is expelled, it will be healed by the help of God with this cauterization.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Rupturis.	§ On the mode of cauterizing in ruptures.
Caput XLVII.	Head XLVIII.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, et descendit intestinum, aut zirbum ad testiculum, et est illud incipiens propinquum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo dimittere comestionem in die suo.	When a rupture occurs in the groin, and the intestine goes down, or the spermatic cord comes close to the testicle, then you should instruct the sick person to discontinue his food in his own day.
Et utatur ex lenientibus, quo descendat stercus a uentre suo.	And let him use laxatives, so that the manure may come out of his bowels.
Deinde sedeat inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et praecipe ei, ut teneat anhelitum suum, donec egrediatur, uel appareat zirbum, aut intestinum.	Then make him sit between your hands on his back; and instruct him to hold his breath until he stands up, or appears in the groin, or moves the intestine.
Deinde reduc ipsum digitis tuis, et signa cum encaustro sub Ruptura super os pectinis, cum signo cuius extremitas sit similis medietati circuli ad superiora corporis.	Then reduce him with your fingers, and mark with the caustic under the rupture on the top of the spine, with a mark whose extreme is equal to half of a circle towards the upper part of the body.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma, donec ueniat album, et proiiciat seintillas.	Then take the caustic fire, which has this form, until it becomes white, and let it throw off sparks.
Deinde reduc intestinum, aut zirbum ad concauitatem suam.	Then reduce the intestine, or the spermatic cord to its concavity.
Deinde ponat minister manum suam super locum, ut non exeat intestinum: et tu iam aperuisti inter crura infirmi, et posuisti sub eo puluinar, et seruiens alius super crura eius, et alius super pectus eius qui tenet manus.	Then let the minister put his hand on the place so that he does not expel the intestine; and you have already opened between the legs of the sick person, and placed under him a pillow, and one turning with his hands, and another holding up his chest, who holds his hands.
Deinde depone cauterium super ipsum signum, manu tua cum cauterio stante recta.	Then place the caustic fire on the spot, with your hand holding the caustic standing straight.
Et tene ipsum, donec cum eo consequaris os: aut itera cum eo uice alia, si non consecutus fueris cum eo in prima usque ad os.	And hold him, until you succeed with him to the teeth: or repeat with him another motion, if you do not succeed with him in the first attempt up to the teeth.
Et prudenter obserua ab exitu intestini in hora cauterizationis tuae, ne comburas ipsum, et eueniat per illud super infirmum aut mors, aut malicia magna.	And carefully observe at the exit of the intestine in the hour of your cauterization, so that you do not burn yourself, and let it go through that into the sick person or death, or great malignity.
Et scias, quod quando tu non consequeris cum cauterio os, non confert operatio tua.	And know that when you do not achieve with the cautery the opening of the mouth, your operation does not bring about.
Et oportet ut sit cauterium infantium subtile, secundum mensuram eorum.	It is necessary that the cautery of infants be subtle, according to their measure.
Deinde cura cum reliquis unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then take care with the other ointments, until it has healed.
Et sit infirmus iacens super dorsum suum quadraginta diebus, donec sigilletur uulnus.	And let the sick person lie down on his back for forty days, until the wound has closed.
Et oportet, ut ponas nutrimentum eius longitudine temporis curationis eius, quod leniat uentrem eius: ut non exeat intestinum apud conamen et egestionem.	And it is necessary that you put food for him in the length of his curing time, which softens his stomach: so that he does not excrete from strangeness and stool.
Deinde quando uult surgere post quadraginta dies, tunc administra ligamentum decenter factum, et teneat ipsum quadraginta diebus aliis.	Then when he wants to get up after forty days, then administer a loose ligament that has been made differently, and let him hold for another forty days.
Et minoretur a labore, et repletione cibi et potus, et uocibus uehementibus.	And let him rest from work, and be filled with food and drink, and with loud sounds.
Nam quando utitur hoc regimine, ita sanatur sanatione integra.	For when he uses this regimen, so does he heal with whole health.
Et ego dicam curationem Rupturarum cum incisione in capitulo suo.	I will speak about the cure of ruptures with incisions in their own chapter.
Quando autem Rupturae accidunt in reliquo uentre, et sunt incipientes, et uis ut non addantur, tunc cauteriza Rupturam eius cauterio rotundo secundum quantitatem eius: et sit illud quod aduritur ex tunc sicut tertia eius.	When, however, ruptures happen in the rest of the body, and are incipient, and do not add to each other, then cauterize the rupture of his own with a round cautery according to its quantity: and let it be as it heals from then on like the third one.
Deinde cura ipsum, cum eo quod diximus: et non addetur.	Then take care of him, with what I have said: and do not add anything.
Et iam dixerunt quidam primi: ut cauterizetur Ruptura cum cauterio triangulato, secundum hanc formam.	And certain ones of the first said: that ruptures be cauterized with a triangular cautery, according to this form.
Postquam signatur cum encaustro, et ponitur linea quae est per latitudinem in latere superiori Rupturae, et linea altera ad inferius.	Afterwards sigil it with encaustic, and let a line be put which is across the width in the back of the rupture, and another line down below.
Et depone manum tuam in medio cum cauterio clauili.	And place your hand in the middle with a clauius cautery.
Sed cauterium primum est facilius et melius.	But the first cautery is easier and better.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in doloribus propter casum, aut percussionem.	Về cách thức khử trùng để chữa bệnh do đau đớn hoặc va chạm gây ra.
Caput XLVIII.	Chapter XLVIII.
Quando accidit in quibusdam membris a casu, aut percussione dolor: et perseuerat ille dolor tempore longo, et non confert in eo curatio cum medicinis: tunc oportet ut cauterizetur cum cauterio Puncti.	When it happens in some member from a fall or a blow: and that pain persists for a long time, and does not bring about an operation with medicines: then it is necessary that it be cauterized with a Puncta cautery.
Et sit cauterium omnis membri cauterium secundum magnitudinem eius, et ipsius paruitatem, et debilitatem eius, et ipsius uirtutem, et locationem torsionis, et doloris ex eo.	And let there be cautery for all members according to the size of it and its goodness and weakness and its strength and the place of twist and pain from it.
Si ergo sanatur ex cauterio primo, est bene.	But if he is healed by the first cauterization, it is good.
Si non: tunc itera super ipsum cauterium.	If not: then repeat the cauterization over him again.
Quoniam de consuetudine horum dolorum est, ut permutentur ex membro ad illud quod appropinquat ei.	Because of the custom of these pains, so that they change from one member to that which approaches it.
Quare oportet ut consequaris eos cum cauterio, donec sanetur infirmus.	Why should those who follow be taken away with cauterization until the sick person is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Lepra.	Regarding the method of cauterizing for lepra.
Caput XLIX.	Chapter 49.
Leprosi autem quandoque iuuantur cauterio iuuamento maximo.	But lepers should be cauterized by a strong fire.
Et praecipue species Leprae, quae fit propter putrefactionem phlegmatis et melancholiae: cum ergo uis cauterizare ipsam considera.	And especially the species of lepra which is made because of putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy: so that when you cauterize it, consider the wound carefully.
Si ergo Lepra est ineipiciens, et curasti eam cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non descendit, neque stat: et times super infirmum, quod comprehendat corruptio super totam complexionem eius: tunc cauteriza eum super caput quinque cauteriis: uno in medio capitis noto, et secundo inferius eo uersus frontem apud finem capillorum, et duobus super duo cornua, et uno posterius super nucea ceruicis.	If, however, lepra is resistant and you have treated it with the care we mentioned in the division and it has not fallen off, but the corruption encompasses all its skin: then cauterize it over its head with five cauterizations: one at the top of the head at its middle, and a second lower than that towards its forehead at the end of its hair, and two behind each ear, and one behind the earlobe.
Et ultima manum tuam cum cauterio parumper, donec imprimat in os impressionem paruam, et dislocentur ex eo cortices: ut alleuietur expiratio uaporum grossorum ex eo, et cauteriza cauterio etiam super ipsum splenem, secundum quod praecessit.	And lastly with your hand a little bit of fire, so that it impresses on the throat a deep impression, and the membranes are torn from it: so that the exhaling of thick vapors from it is relieved, and cauterize with fire also over its spleen, following the above.
Sin autem Lepra iam sparsa est super infirmum, et apparet manifeste: tunc oportet ut cauterizes cum istis cauteriis, quae diximus in capite, et cauterio super extremitatem nasi, et duobus cauteriis super duas maxillas, et duobus cauteriis super spondiles colli, et sex super spondiles dorsi, et uno magno super alhahosos apud gran caudae et uno supra ipsum, in ipso almeidati: et duobus super anchas: scilicet super omnem ancham uno, et duobus super genua: uno super omne genu, et duobus super humeros, et duobus super cubitos, et duobus super teneritudines pectoris sui: et cauteriza ipsum super omnem iuncturam, ex iuncturis digitorum manuum suarum, et pedum suorum: et cauteriza super omnem calcaneum pedum suorum, et focilia manuum suarum.	But if lepra has spread over the sick person and appears clearly: then it is necessary to cauterize with these cauterizations which we mentioned in the head, and a cauterization on the tip of the nose, and two cauterizations on each cheek, and two cauterizations on either side of the neck, and six on the back, and one large on the achilles tendons at the heels and one above him, in the middle. And two on the ankles: that is, on each ankle bone one, and two on the shoulders, and two on the elbows, and two on the breasts of his chest: and cauterize over all his joints with fire, starting from the fingers of his hands and feet, and cauterize over all his toes, and over all the bones of his feet, and over the heart of his chest, and over the ribs of his back: and cauterize also over all his joints with fire.
Et caue tibi a neruis qui sunt super postremum calcanei, ut non comburas eos.	And because you have nerves that are above the heel, so that they do not burn them.
Et quandoque cauterizatur cauterio super os pectinis, et alio super os stomachi, et alio super epar.	And when the cautery is applied to the skin with a caustic substance, and with another above the chest bone, and with another above the stomach, and with another above the liver.
Et scias, quod quanto plus addis cauterium, est magis iuuamentum, et magis conferens.	And know that the more you add the caustic substance, the more it is a remedy, and the more it helps.
Et scias, quod infirmus non inuenit in cauterio dolorem, sicut inueniunt ipsum sani: propterea, quod corpus eius iam stupefactum est.	And know that a sick person does not feel pain in the cautery, as he feels it when he is healthy: therefore, because his body is already stunned.
Et oportet ut sint cauteria ex magnitudine, et paruitate secundum membra et iuncturas: secundum quod praecessit ex speciebus ferramentorum.	And let the caustic substances be of the right size, and with a sharp edge that cuts the flesh, according to the members and joints: and after this, as regards the order of the tools.
Deinde cura cauterium ex farina herbi cum melle, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then take care to add the caustic substances made from herbs and honey, and with other cures, until he is healed.

Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then take care to cure that with ointment, until it is healed.
Et quandoque cauterizatur ad quiddam stuporis, qui accidit manui, et pedi, in spondilibus dorsi apud exitum neruorum, qui mouent illud membrum: et remouetur stupor.	And when the caustic is applied to a certain stupor which occurs in the hand or foot at the exit of nerves that move that limb: and the stupor disappears.
Verum non praesumat super illud, nisi qui est sapiens in anatomia membrorum, et egressione neruorum mouentium corpus.	But this does not happen to him, except for one who is wise in anatomy of the limbs, and knows the exit of nerves that move the body.

When Albucasis is applied to a deep place and does not bring any remedy to it: then apply the caustic substance on top of it a little, according to the thickness of the skin, until the skin is blistered and its color changes.
Deinde cura ipsum cum farina herbi, et lentis cum oleo rosa, et foliis arnoglossae, et sanguine columbae, et sanguine hyrundinis: de unoquoque sit pars una: misceantur haec omnia, et liniantur super pannum, et adhaereant loco, donec sanetur.	Then the care of him with wheat flour, and lentil with olive oil, and leaves of arnoglossa, and pigeon's blood, and hyland's blood: from each one there is a part; all these are mixed together, and laid on a cloth, and adhere to the place until healed.

Quando Cancer est incipiens, et uis ipsum sistere: tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio circuli in circuitu eius, sicuti reuoluitur.	When cancer is beginning, and you stop the flow of blood to it: then cauterize it with a circular cauterizer around its circumference, as though it were turning.
Sapientes autem dixerunt, ut cauterizetur cauterio ultimo in medio.	But the wise have said that it should be cauterized with a last cautery in the middle.
Mihi autem non uidetur illud: quoniam timeo quod ulceretur: et ego iam uidi illud aliquotiens.	But I do not trust that one: for I am afraid that it will ulcerate: and I have seen it sometimes.
Et rectius est, ut cauterizetur in circumitu eius cum circulo, sicut diximus: aut cauteriis multis.	And it is better to cauterize it around its circumference with a circle, as we have said: or with many cautery's.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Adubelati.	The way of cauterizing in adebelta (leprosy).
Caput LIII.	CHAPTER LIII.
Quando aliquis habet Adubelati, et tardatur in maturatione, aut propter superfluitatem facientem eam, aut propter aetatem infirmi, quando est decrepitus pauci sanguinis, aut propter tempus, et uis festinare in maturatione Adubelati, tunc cauteriza in circumitu eius cum cauteriis paruis multis punctando.	When someone has an ablation, and it is delayed in healing, or because of its excess, or because of old age, when it is decrepitous with little blood, or because of time, and the wound rushes into healing, then cauterize around it with small cautery puncturing.
Deinde dimitte eam.	Then, let go of her.
Nam ipsa festinabit cum maturatione.	For she herself will hurry with the healing process.
Si autem uis perforationem eius cum cauterio, tunc igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma.	But if you pierce her with a cautery, then take this kind of fire cautery, which has this shape.
Et depone ipsum in medio Adubelati, donec penetret cutem: et sit cauterium ab eo quod sequitur infirmus, ut alleuietur cursus puris.	And place it in the middle of the ablation, until it penetrates the skin: and let the cautery be from it that follows, so that the course of the pure may be relieved.
Deinde cura ipsum donec sanetur.	Then take care of it until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in malo corrodente.	The way to cauterize with fire in a corruption.
Caput LIIII.	Chapter LIIII.
Corrodens non est nisi corruptio in membro ambulans, et corrodit ipsum: sicut ignis comedit ligna sicca.	A corruption is not unless it corrupts a member that walks, and corrupts the member itself: like fire that cooks dry wood.
Si ergo uides corrodentem in loco qui toleret cauterium cum igne, tunc igni cauteria multa, clauilia parua et magna, secundum quod conueniet illi loco in quo est corrodens.	But if you see a corruption in a place that accepts the cautery with fire, then take many cautery fires, small tools and big, according to what suits him in the place where the corruption is.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum ab omni parte donec eradices corruptionem totam, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid penitus.	Then cauterize the member from all parts until you eradicate the entire corruption, and nothing remains of it inside.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super loca cauterizata sulphur tritum cum oleo, donec eradicentur escharae omnes, et omnis corruptio.	Then let go of the member for three days, and put sulfur powder with oil on the cauterized places, until all the eschar are eradicated, and all corruption.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis generantibus carnem.	Then take care of the member with ointments that generate flesh.
Si ergo uides, quod post tres dies caro nascitur natiuitate sana, in qua non est corruptio, est bonum.	But if you see that after three days the flesh is born healthy, and there is no corruption, it is good.
Et si non: tunc itera cauterium super illud quod remansit ex locis corruptis.	But if not: then repeat the cautery on what remains of the corrupted places.
Et corrodens medicatur quandoque cum medicina acuta.	And the corruption is healed sometimes with sharp medicine.
Ipsa namque surgit loco cauterii.	For she herself rises up in place of the cauterized.
Verumtamen cauterium cum igne est uelocioris iuuamenti: et ego quidem iam dixi cauterizationem eius cum medicina acuta in diuisione: accipe ergo eam illic quando ea indiges.	But the cautery with fire is faster to work: and I have already said that the cauterizing is done with sharp medicine in division: so take it there when you are ready for it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Clauis, et Verucis.	To cauterize in the claws and warts.
Caput LV.	Chapter L.
Multotiens accidit in inferioribus partibus pedum haec aegritudo: et est res grossa, filtrata, quae laedit pedem.	Often this disease appears on the lower parts of the feet; and it is a gross disorder, which is produced by filth, and afflicts the foot.
Et cauterium quidem in eis est secundum duos modos: cauterium cum igne, et cauterium cum aqua calida.	And there are two ways of applying the caustic to them: with fire, and with hot water.
Quantum autem cum igne est, ut ignias cauterium concauum simile pennae uulturis: quod fiat ex ferro, secundum quantitatem quod contineat clauum ab omni parte: et sit subtilium marginum.	As for how it is to be applied with fire, so as to resemble the feathers of a pluckers knife; that is to be made of iron, and in such a way that the claw may not be at all hurt; and let there be a slight margin.
Deinde depone ipsum ignitum super clauum.	Then put the burned thing on the claw.
Deinde reuolue manum cum cauterio in circumitu claui, donec perueniat cauterium ad profunditatem claui: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, donec incipiat emittere pus.	Then, with the caustic in your hand, turn it round about the claw, until the caustic reaches the depth of the claw; and leave it three days, until the pus begins to come out.
Deinde emplastra ipsum cum maluis syluestribus, contritis cum sale: et dimitte emplastrum super ipsum in nocte.	Then bind the thing with silk thread, crushed up with salt: and leave the bandage on the thing during the night.
Ipse enim eradicabitur ex radicibus suis.	For it will be根除根除
Deinde cura locum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then care for the place with a ointment made of flesh, until it is healed.
Quod si sunt non conuersi, et multotiens accidunt in superficie corporis, praecipue in manibus et pedibus: tunc administres in eis cauterium cum aqua calida: et est, ut accipias cannulam ex aere, aut ferro, aut ex penna uulturis: et depone eam super clauum, aut althelul.	If they are not turned, and often happen on the surface of the body, especially in the hands and feet; then apply to them a caustic with warm water; and it is like to take a tube made of brass, or iron, or a feather from a pluckers knife; and put it on the claw, or let it flow over it.
Deinde proiice in cannulam ex aqua calida quantitatem paucam: retine manum tuam, et tu reuolue eam cum compressione manus tuae parumper, ut imprimatur margo cannulae in radice claui, et inueniat aqua calida uiam ad profundum, ad radicem claui: et expectet infirmus parumper super mordicationem aquae calidae hora una.	Then throw into the tube a little quantity of warm water: hold your hand so that the edge of the tube is just pressed into the root of the claw, and let the warm water go down to the root; and wait a while on tiptoe after the tickling of the water.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, nam clauus eradicatur cum radicibus suis.	Then leave it, for the claw will be根除根除
Ita fac cum eis uno post unum, donec uenias super omnes qui ex eis sunt in corpore.	So do with one after another, until you have got rid of all from the body.
Deinde cura eos postquam eradicantur, cum eo quod generat carnem ex unguentis.	Then take care of them after they are cut off, as long as they generate flesh from the ointment.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tremore.	The way to cauterize during tremor.
Caput LVI.	Chapter LVI. On the Treatment of Burned and Frozen Wounds
Quando accidit alicui Tremor ex frigore in neruo, aut ex febre quartana, aut alio: tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis, aut quinque super spondiles dorsi, et inter omnem spondilem cauterio, et in pectore eius cauterio, et super stomachum eius cauterio.	When someone happens to be shaken by cold in a nerve, or by fever, or otherwise: then it is necessary to cauterize the same four cauterizations, or five on the back of the spine, and between each rib cauterization, and in the chest itself cauterization, and on the stomach cauterization.
Tremor enim quiescit cum cauterio oliuari, et festinat sanitas aegritudinis frigidae.	For tremor ceases with the olive oil cauterization, and health of disease of cold speeds up.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Albathir.	The way to cauterize according to Albatar.
Caput LVII.	Chapter LVII. On the Treatment of Wounds Caused by Fire
Quandoque expelluntur in corpore Albathir foedae, id est, pustulae, quae fiunt a materiis grossis corruptis.	When any kind of pus is expelled from the body according to Albatar, that is, pustules which arise from coarse corrupted material.
Oportet ergo in primis cum apparent, ut cauterizentur super omne caput pustulae cauterio subtili cum ligno myrti, cuius extremitas accensa est cum igne.	Then it is necessary first when they appear, that they are cauterized over the whole head of the pustule with a fine cautery of myrrh, whose tip is lit up with fire.
Aut cum radice aristolochiae longae.	Or when a long root of aristolochia.
Aut cum cauterio lenticulari.	Or with a lenticular cautery.
Et quandoque cauterizantur ademenul, in principio expulsionis suae secundum hunc modum: et non augentur: et disrumpitur superfluitas faciens eos, et sanatur ex eis.	And when they are cauterized with the juice, at first in this way after their expulsion: and do not increase; and breaks up the superfluity by doing so, and heals from them.
Verumtamen oportet ut fiat illud post euacuationem cum phlebotomia.	However, it is necessary for that to be done after evacuation with phlebotomy.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fluxu sanguins ex arteria in uulnere.	The way to cauterize during a flow of blood from the artery in the ulnar.
Caput LVIII.	Chapter LVIII. On the Treatment of Wounds Caused by Stab
Multotiens accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, quae incisa est apud uulnus, quod accidit extrinsecus, aut apud incisionem apostematis, aut cauterium membri, et similia eis: et fit difficile abscindere eum.	Often a flow of blood comes from an artery which has been cut at the elbow, or at a cut in the skin, or during a member's cauterization, and so on: and it is difficult to remove him.
Cum ergo accidit alicui illud, tunc propera cum manu tua ad orificium arteriae, et pone super ipsum digitum tuum indicem: et stringe eum multum, donec obsessus sit sanguis sub digito tuo, et non egrediatur ex eo aliquid.	Then when it has happened to someone of this, then bring your own hand to the orifice of the artery, and place the tip of your finger on it: and hold it tightly until the blood is exhausted under your finger, and does not come out of it.
Deinde pone in ignem cauteria oliuaria parua, et magna numero plura: et suffla super ea, donec fiant ignita ualde.	Then put in fire small oileous cauterizes and many in great number: and blow on them, till they are well burned.
Deinde accipe ex eis unum, aut paruum, aut magnum, secundum uulnus et locum, in quo disrupta est arteria, et depone cauterium super ipsam uenam, post quam tu remoues digitum tuum festinanter: et tene cauterium, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then take out of them one, or small, or great, according to the thickness of the bone and the place where the artery is broken, and put the cautery on it, then, quickly remove your finger: and hold the cautery, till the blood be stopped.
Quod si expellatur cum eleuas digitum ab orificio arteriae, et extinguis cauterium, tunc accipe cauterium aliud festinanter, ex cauteriis quae in igne sunt praeparata.	That if you shall drive away your finger from the opening of the artery with a dry bandage, and put out the fire, then take another fire quickly from those that are prepared in the fire;
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum uno post aliud, donec abscindatur sanguis.	So therefore cease not to do it one after another, till the blood be stopped.
Et caue, ne comburas neruum qui est illic, et accidat super infirmum malicia alia.	And take care, lest you burn up the nerves which are there, and bring on some other mischief to the sick person.
Et scias, quod quando ex arteria fluit sanguis, tunc non est possibile abscindere ipsum: praecipue quaudo arteria est magna, nisi cum uno quatuor modorum.	And know, that when blood flows from an artery, it is then impossible to stop it; especially if the artery be large, except with a four-fold bandage.
Aut cum cauterio, sicut diximus.	Or with fire, as we have said.
Aut cum extractione, quando non est extracta.	Or with extraction, when it is not extracted.
Nam quando extrahitur, contrahuntur extremitates eius, et abscinditur sanguis.	For when it is extracted, the ends of it are drawn out, and the blood is stopped.
Aut ligetur cum filo ligatione forti.	Or bindeth with a strong ligature.
Aut ponantur super ipsum medicinae de proprietate, quarum est abscindere sanguinem, et stringatur cum puluinari constrictione decenti.	Or put on the part with medicine of its property, which is to stop the flow of blood, and bind it with a compressive ligature.
Qui autem administrat abscisionem eius cum ligamento, et strictura cum panno, aut positione rerum comburentium, et similium, non confert ei penitus, nisi raro.	Whoever administers the cutting of it with a ligature, and the compression with a cloth, or the placing of burning things and like things thereupon, does not give him relief, except rarely.
Si autem accidat alicui illud, et non sit ei praesens medicus, neque medicina: tunc incipiat cum positione digiti indicis super orificium uenae ipsius, sicut narrauimus, et constrictione eius ualde, donec obsessus sit sanguis a superiori parte uulneris, et super arteriam.	But if this thing should happen to anyone, and there be no present doctor, nor medicine: then let the finger of the index begin to be placed on the opening of the vein as we have related, and the compression thereof with great force, till the blood which is above the wound be stopped from flowing into it, and over the artery.
Et digitus non remoueatur, desuper ipsum cum aqua frigida uehementis frigoris semper, donec congeletur sanguis, et ingrossetur, et abscindatur.	And the finger should not be moved, above it with cold water always, until the blood has congealed, and thickens, and is cut off.
Et interim consideret in eo, quid indiget ex cauterio, aut ex medicina.	And meanwhile he should consider whether it is injured by the cautery or by the medicine.
¶ Partis Primae Finis.	[This] is the end of the first part.
Liber Chirurgici Albucasis Pars II.	The Book of Surgery of Albucasis, Part II.
¶ De Incisione, Perforatione, et Phlebotomia in uulneribus, et his similibus.	On incision, perforation, and bloodletting on wounds and similar things.
Iam Diximus in Capitulo Primo, omnem aegritudinem in qua conueniens est cum igne cauterium et medicina comburente, et occasiones eius, ipsius caussas, et instrumenta eius, et formas cauteriorum.	We have already spoken in the first chapter of all diseases where there is a need for fire to be used as a cautery and medicine combined with burning, and of the causes of these, the causes themselves, their instruments, and the shapes of cauterization.
Et posui illic capitula a uertice usque ad pedem.	And I placed those chapters from the top to the bottom.
Et ego procedam in hoc capitulo illa eadem uia: ut alleuietur super quaerentem quaesitum eius.	And I will proceed in this chapter in the same way: that is, to answer the question of the inquiry.
Et antequam incipiam illud, oportet ut addiscatis o filii, quod in hoc capitulo est ex terrore illud quod est in capitulo primo de cauterizatione.	And before I begin that, it is necessary that you should learn from the son, that is, that terror which is in the first chapter about cauterization.
Et propter illud oportet, ut sit cautela in eo uehementior, quoniam in operatione quae est in hoc capitulo, multotiens cadit euacuatio cum sanguine, cum quo stat uita apud apertionem uenae, aut incisionem super apostema, aut apertionem exiturae, aut curationem uulneris, aut extractionem sagittae, aut incisionem super lapidem, et illis similia: ex quibus omnibus associatur tremor, et timor, et cadit in pluribus eorum mors.	And for that, it is necessary that there be greater caution in it, since in the operation which is in this chapter, frequently the blood flows out with the sweat, when dealing with a wound, or an incision on a bruise, or an opening of an exit, or curing a wound, or extracting an arrow, or an incision on a stone, and those similar: from all of which tremor and fear arises, and death falls in many of them.
Et ego moneo uos, ne cadat super uos illud in quo est haesitatio, nam quandoque cadunt ad uos in hac arte modi hominum cum modis infirmitatum.	And I warn you, do not allow that to happen to you which is hesitation, for sometimes men of this art fall into your hands with their many weaknesses.
Ex eis enim est qui irascitur cum aegritudine sua, et est leuis apud eum mors: propter uehementiam eius quod inuenit ex infirmitate sua et longitudine eius maliciei.	For out of them is one who becomes angry with his own illness, and is light-hearted before him because of the severity of his illness and the length of his suffering.
Et cum aegritudine est ex timore quod significat mortem.	And when the illness is from fear, which signifies death.
Et ex eis est, qui dat tibicensum suum, et ditat te cum eo, sperans sanitatem, et aegritudo eius est perniciosa.	And from these, he who gives you his hand, and says to you, hoping for health, but his illness is pernicious.
Non ergo oportet ut consentiatis ei qui uenit ad uos ex eis, cuius modus est talis.	So it is not necessary that you should agree to him who comes to you from these, whose way is such.
Et sit cautela uestra uehementior, quam cupiditas et uestra rapacitas.	And let there be more care in your wisdom than your greed and your avarice.
Et non praesumatis super aliquid ex illo, nisi post scientiam certam, quae uerificat apud uos illud ad quod peruenit successio laudabilis.	And do not presume about anyone from that, unless after certain knowledge that confirms with you that it comes to what a worthy succession.
Et utimini in curatione omnium infirmorum uestrorum, prognosticatione et indicatione de eo ad quod conuenienter sit salus.	And so that you may heal all your sick patients, by prognosis and indication of that to which healing is suitable.
In illo namque est uobis adiutorium super acquisitionem famae et gloriae, et memoriae et laudis.	In that, indeed, is an aid for you in acquiring fame and glory, and memory and praise.
Inspiret uobis Deus o filii, intellectum suum, et non auferat uobis directionem et inspirationem: quoniam illud est in manu eius.	May God inspire you, O sons, with his understanding, and may he not remove from you his guidance and inspiration: for that is in his hands.
Et ego quidem ordinaui hoc Capitulum distinguendo per capitula, secundum quod praecessit in capitulo Cauterii, a ceruice usque ad pedes: ut alleuietur uobis quaesitum quod uultis ex eo, et quo indigetis.	And I have ordered this Chapter distinguishing it into Chapters, following that which preceded in the Chapter of Cautery from the forehead down to the feet: that you may be relieved in what you ask for from it, and what you need.
¶ De curatione Aquae quae aggregatur in capitibus puerorum.	Of the Cure of Water that is gathered on the heads of boys.
Caput I.	Chapter I.
Scias, quod haec infirmitas multotiens accidit pueris apud partum: aut quando stringit obstetrix caput pueri absque leuitate.	You should know that this disease often occurs in boys at birth: or when the midwife tightens the boy's head without lightness.
Et quandeque accidit etiam ex caussa occulta quae non scitur.	And whenever it also happens for an unknown reason which is not known.
Et ego quidem non uidi hanc aegritudinem in aliis quam in pueris: et ad omnem quem ex eis uidi properauit mors: propter illud ergo uisum est mihi dimittere operationem in ea.	And I have not seen this disease in any other but in boys; and I would see all of them who suffer from it die: therefore, for that reason, I have dismissed the use of surgery in it.
Et ego quidem uidi ex eis puerum, cuius caput impletum erat aqua, et caput magnificabatur in omni die, donec non poterat sedere super seipsum, propter magnitudinem capitis sui: et humiditas augmentata fuit, donec mortuus est.	And I have seen a boy from among those whose head was filled with water, and whose head became magnificent every day, until he could not sit on himself alone, because of the size of his head; and the moisture increased until he died.
Et haec quidem humiditas, aut aggregatur inter cutem et os: aut aggregatur sub osse super sifac.	And this moisture, or it تجمع between the skin and bone: or it تجمع under the bone above the siffac.
Et operatio in illo, si est humiditas inter cutem et os, et apostema est paruum, tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis fissura una in latitudine: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo nodi, donec currat humiditas.	And the operation in that, if there is moisture between the skin and bone, and the swelling is small, then you should find a crack in the middle of the skull in width: and the length of the crack is almost two knots, until the moisture runs out.
Et haec est forma spatumilis.	And this is the shape of a blade.
Si ergo humiditas est magis augmentata, et apostema est maius, tunc pone eas duas fissuras, secundum formam hanc.	So if the moisture is more increased, and the swelling is larger, then you should place them two cracks, following this form.
Et si humiditas est sub osse, et signum eius est, quod uides commissuras capitis apertas ab omni parte: et aqua deprimitur quando comprimis eam manu tua ad interiora, et non occultatur tibi illud: tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis tribus fissuris, secundum hunc modum.	And if the moisture is under the bone, and the sign of it is that you see the skull openings from all sides: and when you squeeze it with your hand towards the inside, and it does not hide from you: then you should find three cracks in the middle of the skull, following this way.
Et post incisionem extrahe humiditatem totam.	And after making an incision remove all the moisture.
Deinde stringe fissuras cum pannis et puluillis.	Then tightly close the cracks with rags and dust.
Deinde embroca illud desuper cum uino et oleo usque ad diem quintum.	Then dip it in wine and oil until the fifth day.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et cura uulnus cum tentis, et unguentis.	Then loosen the ligaments, and care for the tendon with tar and wool.
Et non dimittas stringere caput cum aequalitate.	And do not stop tightening the head with equality.
Et ciba infirmum omni cibo sicco paucae humiditatis, usquequo confortetur membrum, et sanetur.	And feed the sick with dry and scarce-humor food until their member is comforted and healed.
Et modus alius incisionis est, ut consideres ubi apparet magnitudo apostematis, et collectio aquae.	Another way of incision is to consider where the swelling appears, and the collection of water.
Quoniam quandoque est in occipitio plus, aut in sincipite, aut in dextra, aut in sinistra.	Because when it is more in the back, or in the forehead, or on the right, or on the left.
Ascende ergo cum incisione ubi apparet tibi apostema et impletio aquae: et scinde illud secundum quod tibi possibile est.	So go up with the incision where you see the swelling and the filling: and cut it following what is possible for you.
Et obserua, ne incidas arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis, et moriatur infirmus ex illo fluxu cum euacuatione humiditatis.	And observe, so that you do not hit the artery, and an accident of blood flow, and the sick person dies from that flow with the evacuation of moisture.
¶ De incisione Arteriarum quae sunt post aures.	Regarding the incisions of arteries which are behind the ears.
Caput II.	Head.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri ad oculos, aut ad pectus, et antiquatur illud, et non confert curatio medicinarum: tunc magis ultima curatio est in illo, incisio harum duarum arteriarum.	When any catarrh happens to the eyes, or to the chest, and it is old, and there is no cure for it with medicines: then the last cure is in that, to cut those two arteries.
Oportet ergo quando uis incidere eas, ut radat infirmus caput suum.	Therefore, when you are going to cut these eyes, let the sick person remove his head.
Deinde frica locum cum panno aspero, ut appareant arteriae.	Then clean the place with a rough cloth so that the arteries appear.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum, cum quolibet panno suo.	Then the sick person should tie his neck with any of his own cloths.
Deinde considera, ubi pulset uena.	Then look where the pulse is throbbing.
Et loca utriusque sunt loca quae sunt post aures depressa: et raro occultatur, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	And the places are those which are behind the ears: and they rarely hide except in some people.
Deinde signa cum encaustro super utraque: et incide utramque cum spatumili utrimque acuro, incisione perueniente ad os: et fiat illud per latitudinem capitis.	Then mark with caustic on both: and cut one with a sharp knife, while looking towards the mouth: and let it be made through the whole thickness of the head.
Et si uis, intromitte spatumile sub arteria, et incide eam ad superiora cum incisione.	And if you are cutting the eye, insert the sharp instrument under the artery, and cut it towards the top with an incision.
Et sit longitudo incisionis quasi duo digiti iuncti.	And make the length of the incision almost like two fingers joined together.
Nam quando inciditur uena, egreditur sanguis egressione pulsatili, qui salit ad interiora saltu frequenti.	For when the eye is cut, blood flows out with the pulse, which rises to the inside at a frequent jump.
Si autem arteria non apparet sensui, tunc oportet ut mensures ab aure quantitatem spacii trium digitorum.	If the artery does not appear to the touch, then you must measure the space from the ear to the amount of three fingers.
Deinde signa cum encaustro, et finde usque ad os.	Then mark with caustic and find all the way to the mouth.
Et illud quod oportet emittere ex sanguine, est VI uncia et fortasse emittis ex eo plus, aut minus.	And what should be emitted from the blood, is six minutes, and perhaps you emit more or less of it.
Totum illud secundum quantitatem quae apparet tibi ex uirute infirmi et repletione arteriae eius.	All this depends on the amount that appears to you from the eye and the filling of the artery.
Deinde considera ad uulnus.	Then look at the eyeball.
Tunc si remanet ad os ex sifac aliquid, tunc incide illud, ut non accidat apostema calidum: tunc stringe uulnus cum liciniis ex panno lini.	If there remains in the mouth any siffar [I assume this is a word related to scent or taste], then cut it so that it does not happen that a hot taste remains: and tighten the eyeball with linen threads from a cloth.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the person with ointment, until he is healed.
¶ De extractione arteriarum, quae sunt in timporibus.	The extraction of the arteries which are in the temples.
Caput III.	Chapter III.
Quando accidit homini hemicranea antiqua, aut catarri acuti propter humiditates acrimoniales, et caliditate in lacertis timporum, aut soda antiqua, uehemens, et similia illis: et medicatur cum modis curationis medicinae, et non confert illud: tunc experti sumus in his aegritudinibus extractionem arteriarum ex timporibus, aut cauterizationem earum, sicut narrauimus.	When a man has an old headache, or acute catarrh through acrid humors and heat in the sinuses, or old soda, bitter, and like things: and is treated with the methods of medical treatment, and does not give it up: then we are skilled in these diseases in extracting the arteries from the sinuses, or cauterizing them, as we have told.
Et modus operationis in extractione earum, est, ut radat infirmus pilos qui sunt in timporibus, et intendat ad arteriam apparentem in timpore.	And the method of operation in extracting them is, that the sick man should shave the hair which is in the sinus, and direct it towards the apparent artery in the sinus.
Ipsa namque ostenditur tibi ex pulsu suo, et raro occultatur nisi in paucis hominibus, aut uehementia frigoris.	This itself shows you from its pulse, and rarely hides unless in a few men, or when there is bitter cold.
Quod si occultatur tibi, tunc stringat infirmus caput suum cum quolibet panno suo: deinde frica locum cum panno aspero.	That if it hides from you, then the sick man should tighten his head with whatever cloth he has: and then he should cover the place with a rough cloth.
Aut uapora locum cum aqua calida, donec appareat tibi apparitione manifesta.	Or he should heat the place with warm water until it appears to you in a manifest form.
Deinde accipe spatumile, quod paulo ante formaui.	Then take a spoonful of the liquid, which little before I made.
Deinde excoria cum eo cutem cum facilitate, donec peruenias ad arteriam.	Then scrape with it the skin easily until you reach the artery.
Deinde proiice in eam uncinum, et extrahe eam ad superiora, donec extrahas eam ex cute, et facias eam euadere ex tunicis quae sunt sub ea ab omni parte.	Then throw in it a hook, and extract it upward, until you extract it from the skin, and make it bleed from the clothes which are under it from all parts.
Si autem arteria est subtilis: tunc inuolue eam cum extremitate uncini.	If, however, the artery is thin: then turn around the hook with its end.
Deinde incide ex ea partem secundum quantitatem qua elongentur extremitates eius, et contrahantur, et non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Then cut from it that side according to the length of its ends, and press them together, and do not allow a flow of blood.
Nam si non inciditur, et si non abscinditur, non ascendit sanguis penitus.	For if it is not cut, and does not descend, the blood will not go deep.
Deinde euacua ex sanguine ana VI unci, usque ad .III.	Then make bleed from it six ounces of blood up to three times a day.
Quod si arteria est magna: tunc oportet ut liges eam in duobus locis ex filo duplo, forti, ex serico: aut ex chordis alhohod, ut non properet ad ipsam putrefactio ante consolidationem uulneris, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	If, however, the artery is large: then it should be tied to it in two places with a double thread, strong, and silk: or from a cow's stomach, so that it does not tend towards putrefaction before consolidation of the wound, and allow a flow of blood.
Deinde incide superfluitatem, quae est inter duo ligamenta.	Then cut away the surplus, which is between the two ligaments.
Fac illud in illa hora, aut post horam aliam.	Do this at that time, or after another hour.
Et si uis, cauteriza eam cauterio usque ad os, cum cauterio cultellari: donec incidantur extremitates eius, et stabit loco eiusdem operis.	And if you want, cauterize it with a cauldron until the nose, with a knife-bladed cauldron: until the ends of it are cut, and it remains in place of that work.
Et est melius opus, nisi si infirmus habet febrem, autest calefactae complexionis.	And it is better work if he has a fever, or is a caldred body.
Quoniam cauterium est ex eis, quae iuuant ad finiendas humiditates.	For the cauldron is from those that remain to finish the moistures.
Ergo est melius iuuamentum.	Therefore it is better to bandage.
Et oportet post extractionem arteriarum, ut impleatur locus cotto antiquo: et ponantur super ipsum puluilli decenter facti.	And it should be after the extraction of the arteries, that the place may be filled with old cooking: and let be put on the top a poultice made in disorderly fashion.
Et post solutionem curetur cum medicinis siccis, quae faciunt nasci carnem, et cum liciniis, donec sanetur.	And after the solution of the medicine with dry medicines, which make grow flesh, and with leech-blood, until it heals.
Quod si interim dum operaris accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, tunc propera ad abscindendum eum cum cauterio, aut ut impleas locum cum zegi: et stringe manum tuam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	That if meanwhile while you are doing the work a flow of blood comes out from an artery, then approach to cut it off with a cauldron, or to fill the place with a poultice: and grasp your hand, until the blood is cut off.
Quod si nihil ex illis est tibi praesens, tunc pone super locum digitum tuum, donec congeletur sanguis.	That if you have nothing present to you, then place on the place your finger, until the blood hardens.
Et embroca locum cum aqua uehementis frigoris, donec quiescat acuitas, et stringatur secundum quod oportet.	And dip the place in water of cold water, until the sharpness quiets, and grasp it according to what is necessary.
Et ex eo quod est leuius et facilius extractione arteriae, est, ut cauterizes uenam cum hoc cauterio habente duos cultellos: sitque acuitas duorum cultellorum similis almagdatem.	And from that which is lighter and easier to extraction of the artery, it is, so that the sharpness of two knives is like an almond:
Verumtamen sunt multo minoris acuitatis, quam duo cultelli.	However, there is much less sharpness than the two knives.
Quoniam si sunt acutae, sicut duo cultelli, properat utrisque frigus: et non incidunt carnem cum uelocitate.	For if they are sharp, like the two knives, it is necessary that each one have coldness: and they do not cut flesh with speed.
Cum ergo in eis est aliquantulum grossitudinis, tenetur in eis calor ignis, et abscinditur caro uelociter: cum hoc ergo opus est melius omni opere, et leuius, et facilius.	So when there is a little roughness in them, it is kept in them heat of fire, and flesh is cut off quickly: so this work then is better for all work, lighter, and easier.
Et sit spacium quod est inter duos cultellos quantitas grossitudinis digiti, postquam tu signas duo loca cum encaustro: et depone utrosque ignitos ualde, donec perueniant ad os, et incidant uenam in duobus locis: ut elongetur quod est inter extremitates eius.	And make a space that is the width of a finger between the two scissors as much as the thickness of a finger, after you have marked two places with the caustics: and place both on fire well, until they come to the mouth, and fall in two places; so that what is between their extremities may be elongated.
Nam non consolidantur cum hoc cauterio penitus.	For with this caustic they do not consolidate deeply.
Et haec est forma cauterii.	And this is the form of the caustic.
¶ De cura cursus lachrymarum acutarum assiduarum ab oculis.	§ Of the treatment of acute, sharp, and burning tears from the eyes.
Caput IIII.	Chapter IV.
Quando sunt lachrymae assiduae, et est cursus earum ex uenis, quae sunt super craneum capitis exterius: et non confert in eis aliquid curationis medicinae cum medicinis, et uides faciem infirmi iam rubere, et sentit in fronte sua deambulationem, sicut est deambulatio formicarum: et oculi eius sunt extenuati, humidi, ita quod iam corrosi sunt pili eorum cum corrosione: et calefactae sunt palpebrae eius ex acuitate lachrymarum: tunc antiqui indiguerunt in curatione earum hac operatione, et denominauerunt eam curationem, cum Ense.	When the tears are persistent, and there is a course of tears from the veins that run along the outside of the head's skull: and they do not provide any curative benefit when applied with medicines, and the eyes make the face red, and feel a shivering in the forehead, as though it were shivering like ants: and their eyelids are heated by the acuteness of the tears: then the ancients found cure for them with this operation, and called it the Ense treatment.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere pilos qui sunt in fronte sua.	And it is, that you shave off the hair from his forehead.
Deinde incide in fronte tres fissuras aequedistantes secundum longitudinem frontis: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo digiti, et fissura una sit aequedistans longitudini nasi in medio frontis, et secunda secundum longitudinem parumper a motu lacertorum, et tertia a parte altera: et caue ab incisione arteriarum quae sunt in duobus lateribus: et elonga manum tuam a continuatione duarum mandibularum, et sit spacium omnis incisionis quantitas trium digitorum coniunctorum: et sit tibi frustum spongiae praeparatum, aut panni siccati multi, cum quibus exsicces sanguinem.	Then cut in the forehead three slits equidistant according to the length of the forehead: and make the length of the slit nearly as long as two fingers, and the one slit equidistant in length according to the nose in the middle of the forehead, and the second according to the length of half a nostril, and the third from the other: and take care not to cut the arteries that are on either side: and extend your hand from the continuation of the two jawbones, and make the space between each incision as much as the width of three joined fingers: and have a prepared sponge fragment, or many dry cloths, with which to wipe away the blood.
Deinde intromitte spatumile duarum acutarum extremitatum, cuius mox sequens est forma.	Then introduce a pair of sharp scissors at the ends of the slits, and whose following form is:
Ab incisione quae est a parte timporis, usque ad incisionem secundam: et excoria cum eo totam cutem, quae est inter duas incisiones, cum sifac, quod est super os.	From the incision which is from the temporal side, up to the second incision: and scrape off with it all the skin that is between the two incisions, with the caustic, which is on the bone.
Deinde fac illud etiam ab incisione media usque ad incisionem secundam.	Then also make that from the middle incision to the second incision.
Deinde extrahe hoc spatumile, et intromitte in incisionem primam iterum instrumentum aliud, quod nominatur cultellare acutum, ab una parte lene, non acutum ab altera parte.	Then also remove this with a chisel, and insert into the first incision again another tool called an acute clement, soft on one side, not acute on the other.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et pone latus eius acutum uersus carnem annexam cum cute, et latus eius lene uersus os: et impelle ipsum, donec perueniat ad fissuram mediam: et abscinde cum eo omnia uasa, quae descendunt a capite ad oculos: praeter quod continuetur incisio usque ad illud quod apparet de cute.	And place his acute side opposite the flesh joined with the skin, and his soft side opposite the bone: and push him in until it reaches the middle crack: and cut off everything with him that hangs down from the head to the eyes: except that which continues the incision up to that which appears from the skin.
Deinde fac illud in fissura media usque ad fissuram aliam.	Then also make that in the middle crack up to another crack.
Et postquam currit ex sanguine quantitas aequalis, exprime loca ex frustis sanguinis coagulati.	And when an equal quantity of blood has run out, drain the places from the clotted blood.
Deinde pone in omnem fissuram licinium ex cotto ueteri, et pone super eos puluillos imbibitos in uino, et oleo, aut aceto.	Then also put into every crack a chisel of dried blood, and put on top of them wads dipped in wine, or oil, or vinegar.
Et uide ut non accidat apostema calidum.	And be careful so that there is no blistering from the heat.
Et in die tertia solue ligamentum, et administra infusionem multam cum aqua tepida.	And on the third day resolve the ligaments, and give a strong infusion with warm water.
Deinde cura illud ex unguento basilicon, et reliquis quibus curantur uulnera: usquequo sanetur.	Then take care of that with basilicon ointment, and of the others which are treated with ointments: until it heals.
¶ De cura lachrymarum acutarum et catarrorum ad oculos ex interioribus capitis.	Of the cure for acute tears and cataracts to the eyes from inside the head.
Caput V.	Head
Quando accidunt alicui catarri acuti, acres, assidui: et uides oculos eius extenuatos, paruos, et iam debilitatus est aspectus eorum: et palpebrae ulceratae, et cadunt pili ex eis, et in profundo capitis est dolor acutus, laedens, et sternutatio consequens: tunc sume ex istis accidentibus, quod illae materiae, et catarri non ueniunt, nisi ex uenis multis.	When there occur to anyone acute, sharp, persistent: and the eyes of him appear weak, pale, and already weakened is their aspect: and his eyelids are ulcerated, and hairs fall out from them, and in the depths of the head there is an acute pain, stinging, and subsequent sneezing: then do you away with these accidents, that those materials, and cataracts do not come, unless from many sources.
Et melior curatio in eis est haec.	And the best cure for them is this.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere frontem suam.	And it is, that you scrape off the sick person his forehead.
Deinde incide in eam fissuram unam in medio frontis, aut alterius parumper per latitudinem, et incipe cum fissura a timpore sinistro ad timpus dextrum: et sit incisio usque ad os: et elonga manum tuam a lacertis timporum, qui mouentur apud masticationem: donec quando detegitur os: et exsiccabis totum sanguinem cum spongia.	Then also cut in that crack one in the middle of the forehead, or another somewhat across the width, and begin with the crack from the left ear to the right: and extend the incision until it reaches the mouth: and dry up all the blood with a sponge.
Tunc separa inter duo labia fissurae cum cotto ueteri, aut cum liciniis ex lino.	Then separate between the two lips of the wound with dried old cloth, or with linen liniments.
Deinde stringe desuper cum puluillis: et imbibe puluillos cum uino et oleo, ut non accidat apostema calidum.	Then tighten from above with dust: and immerse the dust in wine and oil, so that a hot fever does not occur.
Et quando soluis illud, et uides quod apostema calidum iam imminuitur: tunc oportet ut frices os, donec incipiat in eo nasci caro.	And when you loosen this, and you see that a hot fever is about to break out: then it is necessary that the surgeon's tools be ready, until a new birth begins in it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum regimine exiccatiuo quod facit nasci carnem: sicut si accipias ex farina tritici partes duas, et ex colophonia quatuor partes: et praepares ex eis emplastrum, et administretur ad natiuitatem carnis in istis uulneribus.	Then the care of the patient with the drying regime that it makes the birth of flesh: as if you take two parts of wheat flour and four parts of colophony: and prepare an ointment from it, and administer it to the birth of flesh in these wounds.
¶ De cura eius quod cadit in Aurem.	The care that falls on gold.
Caput VI.	Chapter VI.
Omne Quod in Aurem cadit, est una quatuor specierum: aut lapis mineralis, aut simile lapidi, sicut ferrum, et uitrum: aut est ex planta, sicut est cicer, et fabae: aut est res fluxibilis, sicut aqua, et acetum, et eis similia: aut aliquod animal.	All that falls on gold is of four species: either a mineral rock, or a similar stone, such as iron, and rust: or it is from a plant, such as wheat, and beans: or it is a liquid substance, such as water, and vinegar, and things like them: or some kind of creature.
Quando ergo cadit in aurem lapis, aut genus lapidis ex eis quae non adduntur, neque crescunt in aure, expone Aurem soli: si ergo uides lapidem, tunc distilla in Aurem aliquid ex oleo uiolato, aut sisamino.	When therefore it falls on gold a rock or kind of stone that does not contribute to the growth of gold, expose Gold to the sun alone: but if you see a stone, then distill into Gold some of the oil of spices, or sesame seed.
Deinde administra extractionem eius, et fac sternutare cum condisi, et opila nares apud aduentum sternutationis, postquam tu ponis in circumitu auris frusta ex pannis, aut lana, et extendis aurem ad superiora.	Then administer the extraction of it, and cause it to be sneezed out with condiments, and sprinkle the nose with dust near the arrival of the sneeze, after you have placed in the circumambulation of the auricle rolls of cloth, or wool, and spread the ear towards the upper part.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum hac cura.	For this treatment is often repeated.
Si autem non egreditur, tunc administra extractionem eius cum Gesti, id est, Pizigarolis subtilibus: cuius forma est haec.	But if it does not go out, then administer the extraction of it with a gesticulatory motion, that is, with subtle hand gestures: whose form is this.
Si ergo egreditur cum gesti, est bonum.	But if it goes out with a gesture, it is good.
Et si non, tunc administra extractionem eius cum uncino caeco subtili paucae duplicationis.	Then administer the extraction of it with an invisible little hook: a few times.
Si ergo non egreditur per illud, tunc fac cannulam ex aere, et intromitte extremitatem cannulae in foramen auris multum, et opila quod est in circumitu cannulae cum caera mollificata cum oleo, ut non sit uento uia nisi cannulae: deinde extrahe cum uento tuo attractione forti.	If therefore he does not come out by that means, then make a tube of brass, and insert the extreme end of the tube into the foramen of the ear much, and the dust that is in the circumference of the tube with the brass softened with oil so that there is no way of wind except the tube: then remove it with your breath with strong attraction.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus.	For very often he comes out with him when we tell him to do so.
Si autem non egreditur hoc modo: tunc accipe ex helkalimbat, aut ex uisco, id est, gluten praeparato, cum quo capiuntur aues, rem modicam: et pone ipsum in extremitate radii postquam tu inuoluis super eam cotum decenter positum: deinde intromitte ipsum in foramen auris cum facilitate, postquam tu exiccas aurem ab humiditate.	But if he does not come out by this means, then take from the honeycomb, or from the water, that is, the gluten prepared, with which they are caught birds, a little thing: and put it at the end of the radius after you have dried up the ear from the humidity. Then insert it into the foramen of the ear with ease, after you have removed the wax from the ear
Si ergo non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc propera ad scindendum, antequam accidat apostema calidum, aut spasmus.	But if he does not come out with all that we have told you, then approach to cut off, before the hot apoplexy or spasm happens.
Et modus fissurae est, ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis in cephalica: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum mensuram uirtutis eius.	And the way of the wound is so that the phlebotome cuts off the sick first in the head: and remove from him the blood according to the measure of his strength.
Deinde fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et conuerte aurem eius ad superiora, et finde fissuram paruam in radice auris apud adipem eius in loco depresso ipsi: et sit fissura lunaris figurae, donec peruenias ad lapidem: deinde aufer eum cum eo, quod est tibi possibile ex instrumentis.	Then make the sick sit between your hands, and turn his ear up to the top, and find a small hole in the base of his ear where there is fat on it: and let the hole be round in shape, until you reach the stone: then remove it with him, as far as you are able with the instruments.
Deinde sue fissuram ab hora tua cum uelocitate, et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then close the wound from your side with speed, and take care of it, until it heals.
Quod si res cadens in aurem est ex uno granorum, quae crescunt, et inflantur: tunc administra extractionem eius.	That if the thing falling into the ear is of one grain, which grows and swells up: then administer the extraction of it.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc accipe spatumile tenue, subtile, secundum hanc formam.	But if it does not obey you in coming out, then take a small, thin, knife, according to this form.
Et administra cum eo abscisionem illius speciei ex granis, quae cadunt in aurem, et non facias illud, quando tu cogitas, quod illud granum iam humectatum est per uaporem auris, donec ponis ipsum frusta multa: deinde extrahe ea cum uncinis, aut cum gesti subtili, aut cum suctione, sicut diximus, nam extractio eius alleuiatur.	And administer with him the cutting off of that kind of grain from the ear, which falls and is not caused to come out when you think that it has already been moistened by the vapor of the ear, until you put on it many blows: then remove it with a hook, or with a gentle movement, or with suction, as we have said, for the extraction of it eases.
In aqua autem quae ingreditur in aurem, oportet ut utatur infirmus sternutatione cum condisi in primis: et iam impleuit aurem suam cum aliquanto cotto ueteri: et est iacens super illam aurem, in qua est aqua.	For the water which is added to the ear, it is necessary that it should be used by the sick person with sternutation at first; and already he has filled his ear with some boiled old water; and he lies on it, in which water is there.
Si ergo egreditur per illud, est bonum.	If then he goes out through that, it is good.
Et si non: tunc accipe lapides multos, secundum longitudinem digiti, tenues, lenes, et calefac eos cum igne parumper, et intromittat infirmus ex eis unum in foramen auris suae: et saliat super pedem suum unum ex illa parte, et percutiat cum lapide alio super lapidem qui est in aure.	And if not: then take many stones, according to the length of a finger, thin, soft, and heat them slightly with fire, and let the sick one put one of them into the hollow of his ear: and let him spit on his foot from that part, and strike it with the stone which is in the ear.
Non ergo cesset facere illud cum lapide et lapide, donec egrediatur tota aqua.	Therefore he shall not cease to do this with stones and pebbles, until he has gone out all water.
Et iam egreditur aqua ita, ut accipias ex parpyro, aut ex iunco unum, et intromittas extremitatem eius unam in aurem: et accendas extremitatem alteram cum igne, donec comburatur plurimum eius.	And already he has gone out water so that you take from the straw, or from one branch, and put the end of it in the ear; and light the end with fire, until it is burned thoroughly.
Deinde itera iuncum alium, et fac illud multotiens, donec egrediatur tota aqua: et extrahe ipsam cum cannula secundum quod praemissum est in lapide.	Then take another branch and do this many times, until he has gone out all water; and draw it out with a straw according to what has been said above in the stone.
In extractione autem animalis intrantis in eam, si est parui corporis, ut pulex, et ei simile, cura ipsum sicut dixi in diuisione.	In extraction also of an animal which enters into it, if it is a small body, like a flea, and similar to it, care for it as I said in division.
Sed si est corporis magni, quod appareat sensui: tunc administra extractionem eius cum gesti, et uncinis: et res eius est facilior omnibus, quae tenentur in aure.	But if it is a body which appears to the sense: then administer its extraction with gestures and with a hook; and its affair is easier for all those who hold it in the ear.
In extractione autem uermis generati in aure, quando curas eum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et in tractatu distilationum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut aspicias aurem in sole.	But in the extraction of a dog which is born in the ear, when you have cared for it with that which we said in division, and in the treatise on distillation, and your cure does not benefit him: then it is necessary that you should look at the ear in the sun.
Si ergo apparet illic aliquid ex uermibus, tunc extrahe illud cum gesti, aut cum uncinis subtilibus.	But if there appears anything there from dogs, then extract it with gestures, or with a subtle hook.
Si autem non apparet illic aliquid, tunc accipe cannulam, cuius haec est forma, stricta inferius, ampla superius: et intromitte extremitatem subtilem in aurem secundum quantitatem quod tolerat eam infirmus: deinde suge cum ea suctione forti.	But if there appears nothing there, then take the straw which has this shape, strict below, wide above; and put the end into the ear of the sick person with a strong suction; and then suck with it.
Fac illud multotiens, donec egrediantur omnes uermes.	He repeatedly cut it until all the veins had come out.
Si autem non obediunt tibi ad exitum, tunc opila circumitum cannulae cum caera, sicut dixi in lapide.	But if they do not obey you at the exit, then bind the cannula around with a cord, as I said in the stone.
Quod si non egrediuntur cum eo quod diximus: tunc administra distillationes quas iam experti sunt antiqui in interfectione uermium: et inuenies illud in tractatu distillationum.	That if they do not go out with him that we have spoken: then administer the distillations which the ancients have experienced in the infection of veins: and you will find it in the book on distillation.
Et sit effusio tua qua effundis olea et medicinas in aurem cum hoc instrumento, cuius forma depicta est hic.	And be your pouring so that you pour oil and medicines into the ear with this instrument, whose form is depicted here.
Sicut uides fac ipsum ex argento, aut aere, inferius strictum, in quo sit foramen paruum, amplum superius.	As you see make it out of silver, or brass, below tightly packed, in which sits a small hole, wide at the top.
Sit ergo ut impellens quod est in concauitate cannulae, sit ex aere decenter factum.	Then it is that it pushes out what is in the constriction of the cannula, sit from brass made unevenly.
Et si uis, accipe radium, et inuolue in extremitate eius cottum inuolutione decenti: deinde proiice oleum, aut succum, aut quod uis ex istis medicinis in cannulam: et ipsa sit in aure: deinde intromitte radium cum cotto desuper, et exprime ipsum manu tua compressione temperata, donec impellatur oleum in concauitate auditus, et sentiat ipsum infirmus interius: et illud quod infunditur in aurem, sit iam calefactum cum igne parumper: et caue ne sit res quae distillatur in eam frigida ualde: medicinae enim non tolerant illud.	And if you want, take the radium, and rub it on the end of it with a gentle rubbing: then pour oil, or broth, or what you want from these medicines into the cannula: and let it sit in brass: then throw in the radium with the cotton dropped down, and squeeze it out with your hand moderately, until it pushes out the oil into the constriction of the ear, and feels hot inside: and let that which is infused into the ear be already warmed a little with fire: and let not be what is distilled into it cold: for medicines do not tolerate it.
¶ De cura opilationis accidentis Auri.	Of the treatment of an accidental auricular wound.
Caput VII.	Head VII.
Quandoque egrediuntur quidam infantes ex uentribus matrum suarum non perforati.	When certain children come out of their mothers' wombs not pierced through.
Et iam accidit etiam quibusdam hominibus opilatio in meatu Auris a uulnere, aut carne nata in ea.	And it has also happened to some men that an auricular wound is caused by a nail, or flesh born in it.
Et haec opilatio quandoque fit in profundo foraminis Auris, quam non consequitur uisus: et quandoque accidit ad exteriora foraminis parum, et consequitur eam uisus.	And this wound when it happens to be in the deep cavity of the ear, which does not respond to warm: and when it happens to be a little outside the cavity, and it responds to warm.
Illa ergo quae accidit in profundo Auris, et quam non comprehendit aspectus, est in pluribus dispositionibus difficilis sanationis.	That which has happened in the deep ear, and which does not comprehend vision, is in many dispositions difficult to heal.
Et in illa quam consequitur uisus, oportet ut ponas Aurem infirmi in sole, et aspicias in ea: tunc si uides opilationem apparentem, aperi eam cum spatumili subtili, cuius forma est haec quae sequitur, sit extremitas eius in qua sit quaedam latitudo parua, cuius quaedam pars sit acuta: et reliquum spatumile sit duarum laterum lenium: ut non laedat aurem.	And in that which follows the application of the bandage, it is necessary that you place the gold nurse on the sun and look at it: then if you see the operation apparent, open it with a thin spatula whose form is this which follows, let the end of it be in that which there is some little width, and whose part is acute: and the rest of the spatula be soft of both sides: so that it does not hurt the gold.
Si ergo opilatio est a carne nata in meatu auris: tunc tene eam cum uncino subtili, et incide eam cum facilitate uehementi, donec auferatur tota caro.	If then the operation is from flesh born on the meatus of the ear: then hold it with a little hook, and cut it with ease, until all the flesh is taken away.
Quod si opilatio est in profundo auris: tunc accipe radium subtilem, lenem, et calefac ipsum cum igne parumper: deinde mitte ipsum in meatum auris.	That if the operation is in the deep of the ear: then take a little ray, soft, and heat it slightly: then put it on the meatus of the ear.
Si ergo senseris opilationem cum eo, quod inuenit infirmus cum grauitate auditus, conare apertionem eius cum facilitate: et caue, ne uulneres neruos auris.	If then you feel the operation with that which is with it, that it is weak with the weight of hearing, try to make the opening of it with ease: and carefully, so as not to hurt the nerves of the ear.
Deinde pone in aurem licinium secundum quantitatem amplitudinis foraminis, quod inuoluisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud aliquot diebus, donec sis securus de consolidatione uulneris.	Then put in the ear the silver according to the quantity of the width of the hole, which you have opened with Egyptian ointment: make it for a few days, until you are sure of the healing of the wound.
Aut accipe licinium, et infunde ipsum in aqua rosata, et pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, et utere ipso.	Or take the silver and pour it into water that has been made pink: and dust it on it, and use it.
Quod si uides aurem iam apostemari: tunc oportet ut extrahas licinium, et permittas ipsum cum licinio alio, quod inuolues in caeroto quod sit factum cum oleo rosato, donec sedetur apostema calidum: deinde cura ipsum usquequo sanetur.	That if you see the ear already peeling off: then it is necessary that you take out the silver, and let it with the silver of another, which you have opened in a green made with pink oil, until it stops being hot: and then take care of the ear until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis: tunc submerge spongiam, aut pannos in aqua frigida, et pone super eam aurem: et utere reliqua curatione, quae abscindit fluxum sanguinis praedicta in tractatu distillationum.	If then happens a flow of blood: then dip a sponge, or rags in cold water, and put it on the ear: and use the remaining cure, which stops the predicted flow of blood in the book of distillation.
¶ De cura Altheli palpebrarum.	Of the care of the eyelids of Althel.
Caput VIII.	Head VIII.
Isti Althelil qui accidunt in Palpebris oculi, quandoque sunt humidi, et sunt sicci.	Of all the things that happen to the eyelids of the eye, when they are wet and when they are dry.
Oportet ergo ut teneas eos cum tenaliis: aut cum uncino, et incidas eos cum spatumili a radicibus suis.	Therefore, you should hold them with tweezers: or with a hook, and strike them with a chisel from their roots.
Deinde pone super loca zegi tritum.	Then place on the affected areas three times crushed.
Si autem ex eis fluat sanguis, tunc cauteriza eos cum cauterio lenticulari subtili.	If, however, blood flows from them, then you should cauterize them with a thin lens cautery.
Et cauterizare eos, est melius post incisionem.	And cauterize them, it is better after the incision.
Multotiens enim redeunt quando remanet ex radicibus suis aliquid.	For many times they return when something remains from their roots.
Et quando cauterizantur cum igne, comburuntur illae radices, et non redeunt.	And when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned and do not return.
¶ De cura Grandinum palpebrarum oculi.	In the care of the eyelids of the eye:
Caput IX.	Head 9.
Multotiens accidit in palpebris aliquid quod assimilatur Crandini in fortitudine sua, et sua duricie, et propter illud nominatur Grando: et est aggregatio humiditatis grossae in palpebra superiore, et palpebra inferiore.	For many times something happens to the eyelids which hardens and becomes tough, and for that reason it is called Grandum: and it is an accumulation of moist grossness on the upper eyelid, and the lower eyelid.
Operatio ergo in eis est, ut consideres tunc, si est Grando procedens in eo, quod apparet de palpebra, et mouentur ad omnem partem, et res eius est facilis.	Operation then in them is, so that you consider at the time, if it is Grandum proceeding in it, which appears from the eyelid, and move all around, and its essence is easy.
Finde ergo super eam fissura per latitudinem.	Then find on it a slit across the width.
Deinde excoria eam ab omni parte cum facilitate, donec euadat.	Then remove that skin from all parts with ease until it sheds.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncino, et abscinde ipsam.	Then hang it on with a hook and cut it off.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi abscisio eius, nisi postquam tu penetras palpebram cum incisione parumper, tunc nocet infirmo illud in aliquo.	If, however, you are not prepared to cut off that thing unless after you have made a slight incision on the eyelid, then it will hurt the weak.
Quod si fissura est magna: tunc aggrega ipsam cum sutura: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	That if the slit is large: then gather it together with a stitch: and care for it, until it heals.
Et si est parua, non superueniet tibi malum ex ea.	And if it is small, will not harm you from it.
Vnguentum enim restaurat ipsam, et incarnat eam.	The ointments restore that, and incrust it.
Et si grando est decliuis ad interiora auris uersus superficiem intrinsecam, tunc inuersa palpebram, et suspende grandinem cum uncino: praeter quod indigeas incisione, et preme eam ab omni parte.	And if the Grandum is a decliuis towards the interior of the ear towards the inside surface towards the outside, then upside down the eyelid and hang the Grandum on with a hook: except that you make an incision and press it from all parts.
Quod si elongatur palpebra per incisionem, non nocet illud in aliquo.	If the eyelid is extended by an incision, it does not hurt in any way.
Deinde ablue oculum post incisionem grandinis, cum aqua salsa: et cura locum cum eo quod incarnat, donec sanetur infirmus.	Then wash the eye after the incision with cold water, and take care of the place where it has become inflamed until the wound heals.
¶ De cura Axirnath palpebrarum.	Cauterize the eyelids.
Caput X.	Chapter 10.
Axirnath est adeps qui generatur in tunicis palpebrae superioris: et plurimum quidem accidit illud pueris: et ipsum grauat oculos eorum, et accidunt eis catarri in matutinis, et non possunt intueri lumen solis, propterea, quod lachrymae properant ad eos, et propter illud uides eos discumbere super facies suas semper, et super eas dormiunt, et sunt palpebrae eorum sub superciliis humidae, quas iam cooperuit inflatio: et eminentia quidem Axirnath apparens est oculo, et quando tu premis locum cum digitis tuis, sentis Axirnath inter eos.	The axernath is a fat that is found in the eyelids; and it often happens that children have this fat, which affects their eyes, causing cataracts, so that they cannot see the light of day, because the tears flow towards them, and for that very reason do they lie with their faces down, and sleep on their backs, and their eyelids are always wet and swollen, having become inflamed; and the eminence of axernath is clearly visible to the eye, and when you press the spot with your fingers, you feel the axernath between them.
Et modus operationis eius est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And its mode of action is such that he may place the sick head in your lap.
Deinde accipe pannum lini, et praepara in eo licinia, et fac ex illo licinio circulum secundum quantitatem quod continet Axirnath ab omni parte.	Then take a piece of linen cloth and prepare it with loops, and make from it a circle according to the amount that contains the axernath on all sides.
Deinde pone eum super eam, et preme cum digitis tuis ab omni parte, ut aggregetur Axirnath in medio circuli.	Then put him on top of it and press him with your fingers from all sides so that the axernath is pressed together in the middle of the circle.
Deinde finde in medio illius humiditatis cum spatumili incidente fissuras per latitudinem, et non sit fissura maior illa quae fit in phlebotomia in profundo.	Then find in the middle of that wetness with the spatel a crack from top to bottom, and there is no larger crack than that which is made in phlebotomy in the deep.
Aut oportet ut findas cutem totam, donec peruenias ad Axirnath in pluribus enim dispositionibus procedit Axirnath ex fissura secundum formam frusti pinguedinis albae.	Or you should find all the skin, until you reach the axernath; for the axernath often proceeds from a crack according to the form of white-head:
Extrahe ergo eam cum panno, quem infiltrasti inter digitos tuos ad exteriora: et tu reuoluis manum tuam ad dextram et sinistram, donec dispergatur: et caue, ne addas in fissura, ut non peruenias cum spatumili ad oculum, et laedas eum.	Take it out with the cloth that you have immersed between your fingers to the outside: and you should move your hand to the right and left until it disperses; and be careful not to add it to the spatel so that you don't reach the eye, and let it go down.
Si autem non appareat tibi Axirnath in principio fissurae, tu addas in fissura parum cum facilitate, donec procedat Axirnath.	If you do not see the axilla at the beginning of the incision, you shall add a little to the incision with ease until the axilla appears.
Deinde extrahe eam, sicut diximus.	Then you shall extract it, as we have said.
Deinde submerge pannos in aceto et aqua, et pone eos super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis.	Then you shall dip the cloth in vinegar and water, and place them on the spot, and tighten it with flour.
Et ex hominibus sunt qui terunt salem, et ponunt ipsum in concauitate fissurae, ut liquefiat quod remansit ex illa humiditate.	And there are some who grind salt, and put it in the incision, so that what remains of the moisture is liquified.
Deinde cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then you shall take care of it until it heals.
Si autem accidat in loco apostema calidum, tune cura ipsum cum emplastris sedatiuis, donec sanetur.	If, however, a hot blister occurs in the place, then you shall take care of it with soaked plasters, until it heals.
¶ De modis Ataxmir oculi, id est, cum palpebra mollificatur oculi, unde fit ut rugetur sicut non debet.	In terms of the Atashmir eyes, that is, when the eyelid becomes soft to the eye, so that it rubs as it should not.
Caput XI.	Chapter XI.
Quando nascuntur in palpebris oculi pili additi praeter cursum sub pilis naturalibus, et antiquantur: tunc ipsi nocent oculo, et faciunt accidere modos aegritudinum, sicut lachrymas assiduas, et mollificationem palpebrarum, et albuginem, donec fit illud caussa destructionis oculi.	When hair grows out of the eyelids of the eye in addition to the usual course under the natural hairs, and becomes larger: then they hurt the eye, and cause the following diseases: such as persistent tears, softening of the eyelids, and crusting, until it causes the destruction of the eye.
Et Ataxmir quidem oculi curatur secundum quatuor modos.	And the Atashmir eyes are treated according to four methods.
Aut per cauterium cum igne.	Or with a caustic, using fire.
Aut cum medicina acuta, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo cauterii.	Or with acute medicine, as specified in the chapter on cauterization.
Aut curatur Ataxmir per incisionem et suturam.	Or treated by Atashmir with an incision and suture.
Aut per cannas, secundum quod ego dicam.	Or with a knife, as I say it.
Oportet ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	It is necessary that you place the head of the patient in your lap.
Deinde conuerte palpebram oculi manu tua sinistra.	Then take the eye lid with your left hand.
Si ergo conuertitur, bonum est.	If it is turned, it is good.
Et si non: intromitte acum in eam, in qua sit filum ab inferiori parte palpebrae, et fac penetrare acum cum filo desuper, et sit illud prope pilos ipsos, id est, prope marginem palpebrae, in quo nascuntur pili: et trahe filum ad superiora cum palpebra, et conuerte eam cum radio.	And if not: insert a needle into it, where lies the hair from the lower part of the eyelid, and let it penetrate with a needle from above, and let it sit next to the hairs themselves, that is, next to the edge of the eyelid, where the hairs grow out: and pull the thread upwards with the eyelid, and turn it around.
Deinde finde in interiori parte palpebrae sub pilis additis cum spatumili incidente a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus.	Then find the inner part of the eyelids below the pilus added with the spatula incident from the greater tear to the smaller tear.
Deinde extrahe filum, et pone sub palpebra puluillum paruum ex cotto, aut panno: deinde signa super palpebram cum encaustro, quod sit sicut figura folii myrti.	Then remove the fillet, and place a fine feather from a fowl or cloth underneath the eyelid: then mark the eyelid with the caustic substance so that it looks like the figure of a fern leaf.
Verumtamen oportet, ut fit figura secundum quantitatem et eleuationem palpebrae: quoniam iam diuersificatur illud in hominibus.	However, it should be noted that the shape depends on the quantity and elevation of the eyelid: for this varies widely among individuals.
Ex eis enim est, qui indiget ut incidatur ex palpebra quantitas magna, secundum quantitatem quae mollificatur a palpebra.	From these is one who needs to be incised from the eyelid a great deal, according to the quantity which softens from the eyelid.
Deinde cum spatumili finde super duas lineas quas signasti, et incipe a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus, et sit fissura una prope pilos naturales, sicut est grossitudo radii.	Then, with the spatula, find the two lines you marked and begin at the larger tear to the smaller tear, and let there be a single crease near the natural hairline, as is the thickness of the radius.
Deinde intromitte uncinum in uno duorum angulorum cutis.	Then insert the hook into one of two angles of the skin.
Deinde excoria ipsam totam.	Then scrape it all out.
Deinde aggrega cum sutura duo labia, cum acu et filo lana subtili: et absterge sanguinem, et fac adhaerere quod superfluit ex filis super duo supercilia, cum quibusdam rebus inuiscantibus, si uis facere illud: et si non, non cures.	Then gather together with sutures the two lips, with a sharp needle and fine thread: and wipe away the blood, and let adhere whatever excess comes from the roots of the two eyebrows, with certain things that shine, if you wish to do so: and if not, then it does not matter.
Deinde dimitte suturam et fila usque ad tres dies, aut quatuor: postea cura illud.	Then remove the stitch and thread up to three or four days: then take care of that.
Et si uis, dimitte uulnus absque sutura, et cura ipsum cum eo, quod exsiccat et constringit.	And if you wish, remove the hook without a stitch, and take care of it with it, so that it dries up and tightens.
Nam palpebra eleuatur apud sigillationem uulneris et aggregationem eius: sed futura est melior.	For the eyelid is lifted at the seal of the wound and aggregation thereof: but for the future is better.
Hunc modum curandi Ataxmir docuerunt antiqui.	In this way, Ataxmir taught the ancient method of curing.
Verumtamen in eo est sollicitudo super infirmum, et est ex bona operatione, et non est in eo timor.	However, there is a concern about the weak spot, and it is from a good surgery, and there is no fear in that.
Et modus alius est in Ataxmir etiam: et est, ut signes super palpebram figuram, quae sit sicut figura folii myrti, sicut narrauimus.	And another method is also with Ataxmir: and it is, as to mark on the eyelid a figure, which looks like the figure of a fern leaf, as we have described.
Deinde eleua palpebram cum tribus uncinis separatis, aut aggregatis, secundum formam hanc quae sequitur, deinde incide quod superfluit cum forficibus paruis, secundum hanc formam, cum aequalitate incisionis.	Then wipe the eyelids with three separate or gathered hooklets, according to this form which follows, and then cut what is superfluous with small scissors, according to this form, with equal incision.
Si autem non est tibi possibile tenere uncinum, et non aequatur illud: tunc accipe acum in qua sit filum, et intromitte ipsum in medio figurae: et intromitte filum aliud prope lachrymale maius, et filum secundum prope lachrymale minus: et aggrega inter digitos tuos fila cum aequalitate.	But if you cannot hold the hook and it does not fit: then take the spike where the filament is, and insert it into the middle of the figure: and insert another filament near the larger tear, and a third near the smaller tear: and bring the filaments together between your fingers with equal tension.
Deinde eleua manum tuam eleuatione aequali: et eleua cutem super quam est signatum cotum, sicut narrauimus.	Then wipe your hand with equal wiping: and wipe the skin above where the knot is marked, as we have said.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then bring together the two lips of the wound with a stitch: and take care of it until it heals.
Si uero accidat apostema apud incisionem tuam, aut fissuram tuam: seda illud apostema cum caeroto, et his similibus, ex unguentis sedantibus.	But if a bruise happens to be on your incision or a crack: but that bruise with calamine, and these alike, from an ointment sitting.
Et quandoque accidit palpebrae etiam, ut conuertantur pili eius.	And when the eyelids also turn in so that his hair comes out.
Oportet ergo ut utaris in ea quod diximus in incisione: sed sutura utrisque magis est artificialis.	It is therefore necessary that you use on it what we have said in the incision: but the stitch on both sides is more artificial.
¶ De cura Ataxmir cum cannis.	Of the care of Ataxmir with the dogs.
ET Est, ut conuertas palpebram, et scindas fissuram quae est deintus, secundum quod narraui.	AND It is, to turn the eyelid and split the crack which is inside, according to what we have said.
Deinde arte fac duas cannas, aut duo ligna subtilia: quarum longitudo sit secundum longitudinem palpebrae, et latitudo earum sit minor latitudine spatumilis: et tu iam incidisti in extremitatibus utriusque ab utrisque partibus ubi tenes fila.	Then by art make two needles, or two thin sticks: their length be according to the length of the eyelid, and their breadth be less than the width of a toothpick: and you have already incised at the ends on both sides where you hold the threads.
Deinde aggrega utramque cum subtilitate super illud quod superfluit ex palpebra oculi, et stringe duas cannas ab utrisque partibus strictura forti, et dimitte eam diebus aliquot.	Then bring together each with care above that which is superfluous from the eyelid of the eye, and tightly tighten the two needles on both sides with a strong tightening, and leave it for a few days.
Cutis enim stricta morietur, et denigrabitur, et putrefiet, donec cadet per se.	For the skin is stiff and will die, and will become brown, and will rot, until it falls away by itself.
Si ergo tardatur, tunc incide eam cum forficibus.	But if it is slow to fall off, then cut it with scissors.
Deinde cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it until it heals.
Cum ergo consolidatur, eleuatur palpebra: et non pungunt pili.	When therefore it is healed up, let the eyelid be taken off: and let not the hair be pricked.
Et haec est forma duarum cannarum, quas facies secundum hanc figuram, et quantitatem in longitudinem et latitudinem.	And this is the form of two cannas, which you shall make according to this figure, and their quantity in length and breadth.
¶ De eleuatione pilorum pungentium in oculo cum acu.	For the eleution of the hair pricking in the eye with an aiguille.
Caput XII.	Head XII.
Operatio in illo est, ut accipias acum subtilem, et intromittas in eam filum ex serico subtile, lene.	The operation in that is, that you take an aiguille fine, and put a thread of silk fine therein, and put it.
Deinde aggreges extremitates eius, et nodes utramque nodo subtili ualde: et sit longitudo filorum palmus unus.	Then bind the ends thereof to each other with a fine knot very well: and let the length of the threads be one palm.
Deinde compone in Alinxotati filum aliud subtile sub eo in breui, et noda extremitates eius si uis.	Then put another thread of silk fine underneath that, and bind the ends thereof together, if thou wilt: and knott the extremities of it, if thou wilt.
Deinde ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo, et sit prope solem ut declaretur operatio: quoniam est operatio subtilis, uel minuta.	Then put the sick head in your bosom, and let it be nigh the sun, that the operation may be declared: for this operation is delicate, or minute.
Deinde intromitte acum cum alinxotati in radicem palpebrae, et fac eam penetrare in palpebram festinanter, donec extrahas eam desuper pilum naturalem.	Then put the aiguille with the Alinxotati in the root of the eyelid, and let it penetrate into the eyelid quickly, until it draw out the natural hair thereof.
Deinde trahe pilum usque supra alinxotati: et intromitte in alinxotati illum pilum: si est unus, aut duo, aut tres, non plures.	Then draw the hair up to above the Alinxotati: and put that hair into the Alinxotati: if it is one, or two, or three, not more.
Deinde trahe manum tuam cum eo, donec egrediatur pilus cum alinxotati in palpebra cum pilo naturali.	Then draw your hand with him, until he goeth out: and let the hair go out with the Alinxotati in the eyelid with the natural hair.
Si autem trahatur alinxotati, et non egrediatur pilus cum ea: trahes alinxotati ad inferiora, cum filo quod tu composuisti in ea, donec egrediatur alinxotati ex foramine superiori, et uideas eam uisione oculi: tunc enim trahes alinxotati, et filum: et extrahe utraque, et claude oculum: et dimitte ipsum clausum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec adhaereat pilus loco suo, et nascatur super ipsum caro.	If however the Alinxotati should be drawn out, and the hair not go out with it: then draw the Alinxotati downward, with a thread that you have composed therein, until the Alinxotati goeth out of the upper opening, and covereth the eye with it: then take both out, and close the eye: and let him go closed two days, or three, until the hair be rooted in his place, and grow upon the top thereof.
Quod si pilus est breuis, tunc aut associa ei pilum longum ex pilis naturalibus, et eleuatur cum eo: aut dimitte ipsum, donec elongetur post spacium, et tunc eleua ipsum.	If the hair is short, then either attach a long hair from natural hairs, and remove it with it; or leave it until it grows longer after space, and then remove it.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae accidit in palpebra superiori.	On the treatment of a condition in the upper eyelid.
Caput XIII.	Chapter XIII: Head.
Quando accidit oculo haec Alxatrati, nominatur Leporina.	When it occurs to the eye, this is called Leporina.
Et haec Alxatrati est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	And this Alxatrati is either natural or accidental.
Accidentalis ergo fit ex consolidatione uulneris, aut sectionis, aut cauterii, et similium illis.	Accidental therefore happens from the consolidation of an injury, or a cut, or cauterization, and similar things.
Et modus operationis in ea est, ut tu findas illam consolidationem, et ut separes labia eius, et ponas in eo quod est inter ea licinium ex lino, et liges eam, donec sanetur.	And the mode of operation in it is, that you find that consolidation, and that you separate its lips, and place in it what is between them from linen, and binds it, until it heals.
Et non oportet, ut utaris in curatione eius rebus quae exiccant et constringunt: nam si tu facis illud, redit Alxatrati deterior quam fuit: imo utere in ea rebus quae mollificant, sicut foenumgraecum: et embroca cum aqua, in qua cocta sit althea, semen lini: et unguento dyaquilon, quod liquefactum sit cum aliquo ex oleis: et inuolue cum eo licinium, et cura cum eo.	And it is not necessary, that you use in its treatment things which dry and constrict: for if you do so, Alxatrati will return worse than it was: but rather use in it things which soften, such as fenugreek; and dip it in water, in which althaea has been boiled, flax seed: and spread the ointment dyaquilon, which is liquid with some of the oils: and wrap it up with linen, and treat it with it.
Et thesaurus curationis tuae est, ut coneris omni ingenio, ut non consolidetur, secundum formam quae fuit in primis.	And your treasure for treatment is, that you should guard against all devices, so that it does not consolidate, according to the form which it had in the beginning.
Et haec quidem operatio quam diximus, non est nisi quaedam rectificatio Alxatrati, ut non redeat forma loci secundum quod fuit omnino.	And this operation which we have described is no other than a certain correction of Alxatrati, so that it does not return to the form of the place from which it was entirely removed.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae fit in palpebra inferiori, et est rugatio uel contractio sursum ad dextrum et sinistrum.	On the treatment of a condition in the lower eyelid, and is wrinkling or tightening up upwards towards the right and left.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter XVIII: Head.
Haec Alxatrati quae fit inferius, est quae uere nominatur Alxatrati.	This Alxatrati which happens below is what is called Alxatrati.
Et est naturalis, et est accidentalis.	And it is either natural or accidental.
Et accidentalis fit ex uulnere, aut fissura, aut cauterio, et illis similibus.	Accidental happens from a wound, or a rift, or cauterization, and similar things.
Et uia operationis in ea est, ut accipias acum, in qua sit filum duplum, et tingas eam in carnem, et facias eam penetrare a lachrymali sinistro usque ad lachrymale dextrum, donec perueniat filum in duabus extremitatibus carnis.	And when you come to the operation, so that you take hold of it now, where there is a double thread, and wet it with flesh, and let it penetrate from the left tear duct to the right until the thread reaches the two ends of the flesh.
Deinde extende carnem ad superiora cum acu, et incide eam cum spatumili lato.	Then extend the flesh towards the top with a sharp instrument, and cut it with a chisel on the side.
Si ergo redit figura palpebrae secundum quod oportet, est bonum.	If therefore the shape of the eyelid returns according to what is necessary, it is good.
Et si non, accipe radium, et pone ipsum in fissuram, et conuerte cum eo palpebram: et finde duas fissuras in latere interiore palpebrae, et sint extremitates duarum fissurarum ex duobus angulis incisionis, donec concurrant et fiat ex eis angulus: donec quando aggregantur fiat figura earum haec figura, et est litera lauda graeca.	And if not, take a thread, and put it in the groove, and turn it with it; and find the two grooves on the inner side of the eyelid, and the ends of the two grooves are from two cutting angles, until they meet and form this shape, and is a Greek letter.
Deinde aufer illam carnem per quantitatem, quod est latus eius acutum inferius, ab eo quod sequitur palpebram.	Then take away that flesh according to the quantity, which is the sharp lower side of it, from there because it follows the eyelid.
Deinde aggrega partes separatas: sue eam cum filo lanae.	Then bring together the separated parts: sew them with a sheep's wool thread.
Deinde cura eas cum eo quod diximus, de medicinis mollificantibus, et liciniis, donec sanentur.	Then take care of them with that which I have said, about medicinal herbs, and bindings, until they are healed.
Et si Alxatrati accidat ex fissura, et sutura, aut cauterio: tunc oportet ut findas fissura plana sub pilis palpebrarum, etiam secundum quod praecessit.	And if a sutural or caustic has occurred from the groove, and stitching: then you must find a flat groove under the eyelids, also according to what came before.
Deinde separa inter duo labia cum licinio, secundum quod diximus.	Then separate the two lips with a binding, according to what we have said.
Et summa sermonis de cura Alxatrati, quando est desuper, aut inferius, est, ut currat in ea operatio, secundum quod praeparatur ex forma Alxatrati.	And the whole speech about the care of a sutural, when it is on top, or below, it is that it runs in that operation, according to what is prepared from the form of a sutural.
Ipsa namque est multarum diuersitatum in forma: et artifex prudens praeparat ingenium cum quocunque modo est possibile ei, donec redire faciat figuram ad formam naturalem, aut prope eam, et ipsemet infirmus, secundum quod conuenit ei ex operatione et instrumentis in plurimis dispositionibus.	For it is of many different forms: and the prudent craftsman prepares his mind with whatever way is possible for him, until he returns the form to a natural one, or close to it, and himself, because it suits him, from the operation and the instruments in many dispositions.
¶ De adhaerentia palpebrae oculi cum coniunctiua, aut cornea.	Of the adhesion of the eyelid of the eye with the conjunctiva, or the cornea.
Caput XV.	Chapter XV.
Quandoque accidit haec consolidatio multis hominibus, ita ut consolidetur palpebra superior cum albedine oculi, et prohibeat ipsum ab operationibus suis naturalibus.	When this consolidation occurs in many people so that the upper eyelid is consolidated with the whiteness of the eye, and prevents itself from its natural operations.
Oportet ergo quod intromittas extremitatem radii sub palpebra, et eleues eam sursum: aut extendas eam cum uncino: deinde incide adhaerentiam cum spatumili subtili, quod non sit cum acuitate incisionis spatumilium, imo sit obtusum parumper: ut non inquietetur infirmus apud operationem, et remoueatur spatumile, et laedat oculum cum acuitate sua: et sit incisio tua quasi tu excories illam adhaerentiam cum facilitate, donec quando redit palpebra secundum formam suam naturalem, et sanetur adhaerentia tota.	It is necessary that you introduce the extreme of the radius under the eyelid, and lift it up: or that you extend it with a hook: then you cut the adhesion with a fine chisel that it is not with the keenness of the incision of the chisels, but rather it is slightly blunt: so that the sick person does not disturb at the operation, and moves the chisel, and hurts his eye with his keenness: and your incision is almost like you remove this adhesion with ease, until when the eyelid returns to its natural form, and heals all the adhesion.
Funde tunc in oculum aquam salsam, cum aqua ablue ipsum: aut distilla in ipsum ex sief facto, ex ziniar dissoluto cum aqua.	Then pour at that time in the eye water from salt, with water wash it: or distill in it from a sieved substance, from dissolved zinc with water.
Deinde separa inter palpebram et oculum cum licinio lini: et pone super oculum lanam infusam cum albugine oui: et post diem tertium utere sief, et cum solidatiuis, donec sanetur.	Then separate between the eyelid and the eye with a line of thread: and put over the eye wool infused with white of egg: and after three days use the sieved, and with solid things, until it heals.
¶ De incisione ungulae et eminentiae carnis lachrymarum.	Regarding the incision of the nail and eminence of the flesh of tears.
Caput XVI.	Chapter XVI.
Scias, quod ungula est secundum duos modos.	You know that the nail is according to two ways.
Aut est neruosa: et est similis sifac duro, subtili.	Or it is nervous: and it is similar to syphac hard wood, fine.
Aut est non neruosa, similis humiditati congelatae albae: quae quando tangit cam ferrum, aut conaris capere eam cum uncino, abscinditur, et non figitur in ea uncinus.	Or it is not nervous, similar to frozen moisture of white: which when it touches iron, or conaries it with a hook, is cut off, and does not form an incision in it.
Et utraeque species non incipiunt, nisi a lachrymali maiore, usquequo uadit paulatim, donec cooperit uisum, et prohibet lumen, et motum oculi.	And both species do not begin, unless from the greater tear, until it is gradually revealed, so that it forms a little by little, and prevents light and eye movement.
Et modus operandi in incisione eius est: ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the way of doing this incision is: so that the sick person puts his head in your lap.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et eleua palpebram manu tua.	Then open his eyes, and raise his eyelids with your hand.
Deinde collige ungulam cum uncino paucae duplationis, et extende eam ad superiora.	Then take the toenail with a little hook and extend it towards the top.
Deinde accipe acum, et intromitte in eam pilum ex pilis equi, et bouis, aut uaccae: et sit filum forte, et duplica extremitatem acus parumper, et fige eam in medio ungulae: et penetra eam cum acu, et liga cum filo ungulam, et extende eam ad superiora: et excoria cum pilo latus ungulae quod sequitur pupillam, ac si tu serres eam cum pilo usque ad postreimnum eius.	Then take the toenail, and insert a pin from the horse's hair, or a twig: and make the thread strong, and double its end slightly, and fasten it in the middle of the nail: then pierce it with a needle, and bind it with a thread to the nail, and extend it towards the top: and scour the skin on the side of the nail which follows the pupil, as if you were holding it with a pin all the way up to its base.
Deinde incide residuum in radice lachrymalis cum spatumili subtili, aut cum forficibus paruis: et dimitte carnem lachrymalis naturalem, ut non accidat ex incisione eius cursus lachrymarum assiduus.	Then cut away the residue at the base of the tear with a fine spatula or small forceps: and let go of the natural tear tissue so that it does not stop the flow of tears.
Et quandoque extenditur ungula cum uncino solo: aut cum filo, sicut diximus.	And when the nail is extended with just an hook: or with a thread, as we have said.
Deinde excoriatur cum spatumili leni, cuius haec est forma.	Then scour it with a soft spatula, which has this shape.
Et caue, ne tangat spatumile tunicam corneam, et accidat in ea ruptura, et perforetur pupilla.	And be careful so that the spatula does not touch the horny tunic, and do not cause a tear, and do not pierce the pupil.
Deinde post incisionem, proice in oculum aliquid salis contriti, aut ex sief facto ex ziniar, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then after the cutting, pour into the eye some crushed salt, or made from a paste of zinc: and let it rest until the next day.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur.	Then take care of the eye with whatever is necessary until it heals.
Quod si ungula est non neruosa, et non potes intromittere in eam acum, neque figitur in ea uncinus, tunc multotiens curatur haec species ungulae cum medicinis, et sanatur sicut narraui in diuisione.	If the nail is not nerve-laden, and you cannot get a hook into it, and there is no holding it with an uncinus: then often treat this kind of nail with medicines, and heal it like narrh (a certain plant) in its distribution.
Quod si uis incidere eam, tunc aperi oculum infirmi, et accipe spatumile subtile, lene, debilis acuitatis, secundum hanc formam.	If you want to cut it, then open the eye for nursing, and take a fine spatula, mild of sharpness, in this shape.
Et rade ungulam desuper rasione cum subtilitate.	And carefully scrape the nail from top down with subtlety.
Quod si uides quod ipsa rarificatur et confringitur, et imprimit in eam rasio, tunc distilla ex hora tua in oculum ex sief facto ex ziniar, aut ex sief rubeo, aut sale trito: et opila oculum usque ad diem alium.	If you see that the eye itself is getting thinner and narrower, and impressing it into the nail: then pour into the eye at your own hour from a paste made of zinc, or red ochre, or ground salt: and coat the eye until the next day.
Deinde itera super ipsam operationem, donec remoueatur totum eius.	Then he continued to operate on it, until he had completely removed it.
Nisi contrarium sit tibi in oculo apostema calidum: tunc enim dimitte ipsam, et cura apostema, donec sanetur.	Unless you have a red hot poultice in your eye: then indeed let go of it, and take care of the pustule until it heals.
Deinde itera operationem super ipsam cum rasione, donec sanetur.	Then he continued to operate on it with a razor, until it healed.
Eminentia autem carnis lachrymalis, si nocet in oculo nocumento magno, suspendatur cum uncino, et incide ex ea partem eius: et non ultimes incisionem, ut non accidat cursus lachrymarum.	Except the glory of the flesh of the eye, if it hurts much in the eye, let it be suspended with an anchor, and cut from that part of it; and do not make the last incision, lest the course of tears run away.
Deinde stilla in lachrymale sief rubeum, aut factum ex ziniari, donec sanetur.	Then add a drop of red rub to the tear, or make it with a lead pen, until it heals.
¶ De incisione Alguardenic, et carne nata in oculo.	Regarding the incision of Algordano and the flesh born in the eye.
Caput XVII.	Chapter XVII.
Nascitur quandoque in quibusdam oculis hominum caro rubea composita, uel superposita, donec cooperit pupillam, aut appropinquat, aut stringit super palpebras, et fortasse conuertit palpebras ad exteriora: et assimilatur rosae balaustinae.	Is sometimes born in the eyes of some men with a red flesh, either placed above or combined with it until it covers the pupil, or approaches or tightens on the eyelids, and perhaps turns them outward: and is absorbed into the rosy balastine.
Et operatio in ea etiam est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the operation on it also is, that he shall put his sick head in your bosom.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et collige illam carnem totam cum uncinis conuenientibus ad illud: et tene illud cum forcipe uno, aut gesti.	Then open her eyes, and take all that flesh with an anchor suitable to it: and hold it with one clamp, or gesturing.
Deinde incide carnem in primis, donec finiatur totum eius cum incisorio.	Then cut the flesh first, until you have completely finished cutting it with a knife.
Et caue ab oculo, ut non laedas ipsum apud operationem: et sit incisio tua qua ipsam incidis, aut cum spatumili, quod narrauimus in incisione ungulae: aut cum forficibus paruis, cum quibus colligitur asebel, secundum quod ueniet forma eius post hoc capitulum.	And cause her to leave the eye, lest you wound it during the operation: and let your incision be wherever you cut it, or with a small chisel, which we have spoken of in the incision of the nail: or with little hooks, with which Asbel is collected, according to which it shall be after this chapter.
Cum ergo completur incisio tua, et remouetur tota alguardenici, tunc imple oculum ex sale contrito: aut distilla in eum puluerem rubeum, et similia illi ex medicinis corrosiuis: et pone super oculum deforis cottum cum albugine oui: ut securetur ab apostemate calido.	When your incision is completed and all the Algordano has been removed, then fill her eye with dissolved salt: or distill into it red powder, and similar drugs from the coroner's corrode: and put on her eye a cottage with alume, that she may be secure from the hot poultice.
Quod si remanet ex alguardenici aliquid, et dominatur tibi sanguis calidus, et times apostema calidum: tunc dimitte oculum, et cura ipsum cum eo quod sedat apostema.	If anything remains of the socket, and hot blood flows to you, and the swelling is warm: then let go of the eye, and take care of the socket itself while it sleeps.
Deinde itera super ipsum cum operatione, donec sanetur.	Then bandage again over the eye with the operation, until it heals.
Et similiter fac cum carne addita quae accidit in oculo ex hac specie.	And do likewise for the flesh added which has happened in the eye from this kind.
Verumtamen oportet, ut alienes curationem omnis oculi debilis ex uia naturali, aut ex uia accidentali, operando cum ferro: et non intromittas manum tuam in aliqua harum operationum, donec uideas, quod illud membrum est tolerans illam operationem.	However, it is necessary that you refrain from any cure for a weak eye that comes from natural causes, or from accidental causes, with the iron; and do not insert your hand into any of these operations, until you are certain, that that member is able to endure that operation.
¶ De collectione Sebel ex oculo.	On the collection of sebaceous matter from the eye.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter XVIII.
Sebel sunt uenae rubeae quae texuntur super oculum, et prohibent uisui operationem suam: et debilitant oculum cum longitudine dierum.	These are small red worms that grow on the eye, and prevent the sight; and weaken the eye with the passage of time.
Necesse est ergo tibi in primis, ut consideres, si oculus in quo est Sebel, est fortis, et non est in eo aegritudo aliqua, praeter Sebel: tunc collige Sebel eius.	Therefore it is necessary that you should first consider, if the eye in which Sebel is, is strong, and has no other disease besides Sebel: then gather Sebel from it.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo.	And is, as you command the sick person, to put his head in your lap.
Deinde suspende illas uenas cum uncino uno, aut duobus secundum prudentiam tuam: et sit uncinus subtilis duplationis, secundum hanc formam, aut sint duo uncini gradat in corpore uno, secundum hanc formam.	Then hang those worms with a single hook, or two according to your discretion: and let the hook be thin, according to this form, or let there be two hooks placed at a distance in the body, according to this form.
Deinde collige cum forficibus subtilibus illas uenas cum subtilitate, et absterge sanguinem hora post horam, donec uideas illas uenas remoueri ex oculo, et resoluuntur: et caue ne laedas oculum cum extremitatibus spatumilis.	Then with subtle hook-like instruments gather those worms with subtlety, and wipe away the blood hour by hour, until the worms come out from under the eye, and dissolve: and do not leave the eye with the tips of spatulums.
Et sit operatio tua in meridie coram sole, et sis firmus in operatione tua ualde: ut non incidas nisi illas uenas.	And let your operation be in the middle of the day before the sun, and be firm in your operation greatly: so that you do not fall but on those worms.
Et cum tu expleueris, tunc distilla in oculum sief uiride, aut rubeum: ut sua acuitate corrodat quod remansit ex sebel.	And when you have drained (it), then distil into the eye strong cider, or red wine: so that its acridity may corrode what remains of Sebel.
Si autem non est tibi possibile colligere illud totum in illa hora, tunc emplastra oculum cum eo, quod sedat dolorem oculi: et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur dolor eius: et securetur ab apostemate calido: deinde itera super ipsum secundum modum eundem, donec sanetur.	But if you are not able to collect that whole thing in that hour, then bind the eye with that, which sits [the eye] comfortably: and dismiss him for a few days, until his pain is satisfied; and secure him from the heat of an apoplexy: and then repeat over it again in the same way, until he is healed.
Et haec est forma forficis.	And this is the form of the forceps.
¶ De reductione Arissati ad nasum.	The reduction of a torn nostril to the nose.
Caput XIX.	Chapter XIX.
Nominant medici Arissati Fistulam, quam curas cum cauterio, aut cum medicina acuta comburente, secundum quod praecessit eius narratio.	The doctors name the nostril-fistula, which they treat with a caustic or with an acute medicine, according to what went before in his narrative.
Et si non sanatur, tunc non est ingenium in ea: nisi ut findas super apostema apud natiuitatem eius, et extrahas totam humiditatem quae est in eo et pus, donec detegatur os.	And if he is not healed, then there is no skill in it: unless you find out on an apoplexy near his birth, and drain all the moisture that is in him and the pus, until the opening is discovered.
Cum ergo detegitur os, et uides in eo corruptionem, aut nigredinem, tunc rade ipsum cum instrumento, cuius forma est haec.	When therefore the opening is discovered, and you see in it corruption or blackening, then cut it out with an instrument, the form of which is as follows.
Et nominatur Asperi capitis.	And it is called the asperity of the head.
Fiat ex ferro indo, et sit caput eius rotundum sicut azir, quod sit punctatum punctatione limae, aut punctatione aliskilferi punctatione subtili: et pone ipsum super locum corruptum ossis.	Let it be made of iron bar and let the head be round like a ball, that it may be punctured with a file or with fine chisel-notching: and place the piece on the site of the corruption of the bone.
Deinde reuolue ipsum inter digitos tuos, et tu preme manum tuam parumper, donec scias quod illa corruptio iam rasa est: et fac illud aliquotiens.	Then turn the piece between your fingers and press your hand upon it slightly, until you know that that corruption is now rasped: and do so often.
Deinde restaura locum cum medicinis exiccatiuis stipticis.	Then restore the place with acute medicine of stiptic.
Si ergo consolidatur locus, et nascitur in eo caro, et abscinditur cursus saniei: et remanet quadraginta diebus, et non renouatur, et non apostematur, et non accidit in eo accidens: tunc scias quia iam sanatus est.	If therefore the place is consolidated, and a bone grows up in it, and the wound heals over: and remains for forty days, and does not renew, and does not open again, you shall know that he is now healed.
Et si non, tunc non est in eo ingenium, nisi reducere fistulam ad foramen nasi, secundum hanc formam.	And if not, then there is no skill in it, except to reduce the fistula into the nostril, according to this form.
Et est, ut detegas ab osse secundo cum ferro, aut cum medicina acuta: et cum detectum est os, tunc accipe terebrum secundum hanc formam, sit extremitas ferrea, triangulata: et lignum eius sit pyramis extenuata usque ad extremitatem, sicut uides.	And it is, so that you can detect the bone with iron, or with acute medicine: and when the bone has been detected, then take a chisel according to this form, its end being a triangle: and let the wood of it be extended towards the end like a pyramid: as you see.
Deinde pone illud super os ipsum: et sit illud prope lachrymale: et elonga manum tuam ab oculo parum.	Then place that above his own skull. And let it be near the lacrimal bone. And extend your hand from the eye a little way.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum terebro, donec penetret os, et sentiat illud infirmus: per hoc quod inuenit uentum exire ex eo, quando tenet manum suam super nasum suum.	Then turn your hand with the knuckles toward the skull, so that it penetrates the bone and feels weak. Through this he will see that vapor is emerging from him when he holds his hand over his nose.
Ergo tunc restaura locum cum medicinis stipticis exiccantibus, sicut docui te.	Therefore then restore the position with the syringes that dry out, as I have taught you.
Cum ergo nascitur caro, et induratur locus: tunc materia quae effundebatur ad exteriora, redit ad nasum: est ergo leuius illud super infirmum.	When then the flesh is born and the place hardens. Then the matter that flowed outward returns to the nose. So it is lighter above the weak one.
¶ De reductione eminentiae Oculi.	On the reduction of the prominence of the eye.
Caput XX.	Chapter 20: On reducing the prominence of the eye
Quando eminet Oculus cum totalitate sua, et non accidit in uisu nocumentum, neque diminutio: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum: deinde phlebotomes eum: postea ponas uentosas in ceruice absque scarificatione, sed cum suctione.	When the eye emanates with its entirety, and does not happen to damage the vision or diminish it: then you should remove the weak one: then you should bleed him: then you should place the cooling agents on the skin without scarring, but with suction.
Deinde pone super Oculum linimentum quod fit ex acacia, et aloe, et olibano, et sarcocolla.	Then put over the eye a liniment that is made from oak-galls, and aloe, and myrrh, and white-olibanum, and chalk-lime.
Deinde stringe Oculum desuper super emplastrum cum puluillis multis.	Then tighten the eye slightly above the plaster with a mixture of many powders.
Et modus puluillorum est: ut accipias pannos lenes, multos, et duplicetur omnis pannus ex eis super quatuor: fac ex eis multos: deinde pone eos unum super alium, secundum quantitatem qua indiget Oculus: deinde stringe super ipsos cum panno duro strictura forti.	And the mode of the powders is: that you take soft cloths, many, and double all the cloths out of them, four by four: make from them many: then put them one on top of the other, second by quantity what the eye needs: then tighten them over themselves with a hard cloth, strong tightening.
Et itera uentosas cum suctione sine scarificatione.	And again place the cooling agents without scarring, but with suction.
Deinde aufer uentosas, et dimitte oculum strictum die et nocte.	Then remove the cooling agents and release the eye, tightening it slightly during the day and night.
Si autem ligamentum iterum mollificatur, tunc oportet ut stringatur multum: deinde aufer ligamentum post diem et noctem, sicut diximus.	If however the ligature softens again, then you should tighten it a lot: then remove the ligature after day and night, as we have said.
Si ergo uides oculum iam redisse uuae tunicae, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam, et uentosas, donec sanetur.	If then the eyes of the eye are already red with new ligatures, it is good: and if not, then again the plasters, and the tightening, and the cooling agents, until they heal.
¶ De incisionie Vuae tunicae.	Regarding the incisions, there are two types of tunica.
Caput XXI.	Chapter 21. On the incision.
Quando accidit disruptio in tunica Vuea, deinde eminet et procedit extra palpebras sicut granum Vuae, et foedatur forma hominis propter illud, et uis incidere illud: tunc operatio in eo est, secundum quod narro: et est, ut intromittas acum in radice Vuae ab inferiori ad superiorem partem.	When a rupture occurs in the Vein of King Henry, then it is cut and moved outside the eyelids like a grain of King Henry's seed, and its shape is made into that of a human being so that it can be incised: then the operation on it is this, according to what the surgeon says: and it is, so that you insert the sharp instrument into the root of King Henry from below to above.
Deinde intromitte acum aliam in qua sit filum duplum a parte lachrymalis, et fac eam penetrare: et dimitte acum primam secundum dispositionem suam.	Then introduce another sharp instrument where there is a double filament from the lacrimal part, and let it penetrate: then let go of the first one according to its position.
Deinde incide locum fili dupli, et liga cum eo partem Vuae in circumitu acus: et stringe eam multum.	Then incision is made on the place of the double filament, and the King Henry's Vein part with it is tied around the acu-tip: and tighten it very much.
Deinde extrahe acum, et pone super oculum lanam infusam in albugine oui: et dimitte eum, donec cadat filum cum Vua.	Then extract it now, and place on the eye a woolen thread soaked in white of egg: and let go of it until the filament falls with King Henry' Vein.
Deinde cura oculum cum eo, quod confortat ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then take care of the eye with it, which comforts it, until the wound heals.
Et quandoque stringitur Vua ab omni parte cum circulo ex panno, donec addat oculus eminentiam magnam.	And when King Henry' Vein is tightened from all sides with a circle of cloth so that the eye protrudes greatly.
Deinde perforetur cum spatumili subtili, quod perueniat ad profundum oculi, et currat humiditas albuginea, et descendat oculus, et ingrediatur statim: deinde stringe eum, donec sanetur.	Then it is pierced with a thin spatula that reaches to the depth of the eye, and the tearful white fluid comes out, and the eye goes down, and is immediately inserted: then tighten it, until it heals.
¶ De curatione Alcomnati.	The Cure of Alcomat.
Caput XXII.	Chapter 22. On the cure of Alcomat
Haec Aegritudo quae nominatur Alcomnati, non, est nisi sanies, quae aggregatur in oculo, similis aquae descendenti, et non est ipsa.	This ailment called Alcomat, is not anything else but a kind of mucus gathered in the eye, similar to flowing water, and it is not itself.
Et modus operandi in ea est, ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem praeparatum, uel directum.	And the way to operate on it is this, that you make the sick person sit on a prepared seat, or directly facing upwards.
Deinde accipe caput eius manibus tuis a partibus duabus, et moue ipsum, donec uideas saniem peruenire ad inferiora oculis tuis.	Then take his head in your hands from the two parts, and move it so that the mucus reaches to the lower eyes.
Deinde figatur, et non descendat, et absoluatur lumen: et uideat infirmus res sicut uidebat: et si non descendit inferius, scias quia est aqua.	Then tighten it, so that it does not fall, and the light is kept in its place: and let the sick person see things as they are: and if it does not go down below, you shall know that it is water.
Si autem non praeparatur descensus saniei cum eo quod diximus, tunc fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas.	But if he does not prepare the descent of the wound with him as we have said, then make the sick person sit between your hands.
Deinde accipe spatumile subtile, et finde cum eo supra panniculum corneum parumper apud continuationem coniunctiuae cum tunica cornea in corona, donec egrediatur sanies.	Then take a thin spittle and find with him above the corneal membrane a little at the place of the intersection with the corneal envelope on the crown, until it is discharged.
Cum ergo egreditur, tunc distilla in oculum aquam calidam in qua miscuisti mel: aut aquam in qua iam bullisti foenumgraecum et mel: deinde curetur cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When it is discharged, then dilute in the eye a hot water in which you have mixed honey: or water in which you have already boiled millet and honey: then let it be cared for with the rest of the cure, until it heals.
¶ De cura aquae, quae descendit in oculo, uel cataracta.	As for the care of water that has entered the eye, or a waterfall.
Caput XXIII.	Chapter XXIII
Iam Diximus species aquae in diuisione, et quae conuenit ad perforandum sermone declarante et exponente, tunc accipe illud idem secundum sanitatem.	We have already spoken about the kind of water, and what is appropriate for piercing with a revealing and explaining speech, then take that same thing according to health.
Tunc ergo oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas quadratum, oppositum lumini, prope solem: et liga oculum eius sanum, et stringe eum ualde: deinde palpebram oculi eius manu tua dextra, si oculus in quo est aqua, est oculus sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then it is necessary that you make the sick person sit between your hands square, opposite to the light, near the sun: and bandage the healthy eye, and tighten it firmly: then with your hand close to the healthy eye, and with your left hand if the eye in which the water is is on the right: or with your left hand, if the eye is on the left.
Deinde accipe manu tua dextra almagda, si oculus est sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then take with your hand on the right an almond, if the eye is on the left: or with your left hand, if the eye is on the right.
Deinde pone extremitatem almagda prope coronam per grossitudinem radii in ipsa albedine oculi apparente lachrymalis minoris: deinde impelle almagda cum uirtute: et tu reuoluis cum eo manum tuam, donec penetret in albuginem oculi: et sentias, quod almagda iam peruenit ad rem uacuam.	Then put the tip of the almond close to the crown by the thickness of the radius in the same white of the eye apparent tear of a little one: then push the almond with force: and you roll it with your hand, until it penetrates into the membrane of the eye: and you feel that the almond has already reached the watery part.
Et oportet, ut sit mensura itineris almagda ad profundum, mensura spacii quod est a pupilla usque ad finem nigredinis: et est corona oculi.	And it is necessary so that the distance of the almond to the bottom is a measure of space which is from the pupil until the end of blackness: and this is the crown of the eye.
Uidebis enim ea in ipsa pupilla uisione oculi, propter claritatem tunicae corneae.	You will see it in the same pupil with an eye-watery vision, because of the clarity of the corneal envelope.
Deinde pone almagda usque ad locum in quo est aqua.	Then put the alмагest until the place where is water.
Deinde preme ipsum inferius uice una post aliam.	Then press the lower part with a single lever after another.
Si ergo descendit aqua statim, tunc infirmus uidet illud super quod aperit uisum suum statim, et almagda in oculo suo.	If then water has descended at once, then the sick person will see that which opens his own viscus at once, and the almagest in its eye.
Deinde quiescas paululum.	Then you rest a little.
Si ergo descendat aqua, tunc depone eam secundo, praeter quod egrediatur almagda.	If then water has descended, then put it down again, except that the almagest should come out.
Quando ergo figitur, et non ascendit: tunc extrahe almagda cum facilitate: et tu reuoluis manum tuam paulatim.	When then does it form, and does not rise up: then pull out the almagest with ease: and you relax your hand little by little.
Deinde dissolue in aqua aliquid ex sale claro gemmae: et ablue cum eo oculum deintus.	Then dissolve in water a little of the clear salt from the gem: and wash with it the inner eye.
Deinde pone extra oculum totum stuppam, aut lanam infusam oleo rosato, et albugine oui: et liga cum eo oculum sanum.	Then put outside all the crust, or wool dipped in oil rosined, and wax: and binds with it the healthy eye.
Nos autem, et illi qui sunt nostri temporis, ponimus super eum ciminum tritum cum albumine oui.	But we, and those who are of our time, put on him crushed cumin mixed with wheat flour.
Quod si non obedit tibi almagda ad introitum in oculum propter duriciem suam, quoniam ex hominibus est, cuius oculus est durus ualde: tunc oportet ut accipias spatumile, quod nominatur Alberid, cuius haec est forma.	That if the almagest does not obey you at the entrance to the eye because of its hardness, since it is from men, and whose eye is very hard: then you should take a staff, which is called an alberid, whose this is the form.
Pefora ergo cum eo ipsam coniunctiuam tantum, et non ultimes manum tuam in foramine: et non est nisi ut facias uiam ad almagda locum subtilem.	Then open it with him alone the connection only, and not the end of your hand in the hole: and is there only to make a way for the almagest's place soft.
Deinde intromitte almagda, secundum quod diximus.	Then introduce the almagest, according to what we have said.
Et apud complementum operis tui, praeparetur infirmo dormitorium decenter factum, in quo dormiat super dorsum suum in domo tenebrosa: et prohibeatur ab omnibus motibus, et a tussi: et pone cibum eius illud quo lenitur natura eius: et non moueat caput suum dextra, neque sinistra omnino.	And near the end of your work, prepare for the sick person a dark room in which to sleep on his back in a house that is dark: and prohibit from all movements, and coughing: and do not let him move his head to the right, or at all.
Et sit ligamentum secundum dispositionem suam usque ad diem tertium.	And sit fast by his side according to its position until the third day.
Deinde solue illud in illa domo tenebrosa, et experire uisum eius: et fac eum uidere res.	Then dissolve it in that dark house, and test his viscus: and let him see things.
Deinde reduc ligamentum usque ad diem septimum.	Then reduce the ligaments until the seventh day.
Et non oportet ut faciat illud in hora curationis, aut post incisionem statim: imo oportet, ut alienes illud: propterea quod aqua ascendit uelociter per aspectum uehementem.	And it is not fit that he should make that operation at the hour of cure, nor yet immediately after the incision: but rather, let him wait until another day: because the water riseth soon through the rough skin.
Si autem accidit apostema calidum: tunc oportet ut soluas oculum ante septimum: et rectifica illud cum eo quod sedat apostema, donec sedatur: tunc absolue ipsius uisum, et pone super faciem eius orale quo regatur uisus eius sub eo diebus aliquot, ipso existente in illa domo tenebrosa.	But if it happens that the swelling is hot: then it is fit that thou shalt open his eye before the seventh day: and rectify that which is wrong with him, when he doth lie down, until that the swelling hath been healed: then thou shalt let go his water, and put it on his mouth where it goeth under him for some days, while he dwelleth in that dark house.
Deinde egrediatur a domo gradatim, et conuersetur in casis suis.	Then let him go out of the house little by little, and let him turn round in his bed.
Et scias, quod in zaltea non excusatur discipulus a uisione aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super operationem.	And knowest thou not that the student is exempt from sight sometimes for a few days? Then let him dare to speak about the operation.
Et iam quidem peruenit ad nos quidam ex illis qui sunt de Alayrach, qui dixit, quod factum fuit in Alayrach magdan perforatum, quo sugitur aqua.	And now it is come to our ears that a certain one from Al-Rajah has said, "It hath been done in Al-Rajah by means of a piercing, whereby the water is drawn.
Verum ergo non uidi aliquem in terra uostra, qui fecerit illud: neque legi illud in aliquo ex libris antiquorum: et est possibile, ut sit illud nouum.	But truly I have not seen anyone in the land of the Arabs do such a thing; nor have I found it in any of the old books: but it is possible that it may be new.
Et istae sunt formae specierum ex magda, ut stet super ea qui ea ignorat.	And these are the forms of the wounds from the piercing, that they stand above them who know not.
Fiant ex aere proprie: et sint extremitates eorum cum hac eadem subtilitate triangulatae, et extremitas acuta.	Let them be made of pure brass; and let their ends be of this same triangular sutilty, and the point sharp.
Formae magda.	The forms of the piercing.
¶ De cura Carnis natae in naso.	On the care for the flesh that is born in the nose.
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter XXIII.
Quandoque nascuntur in naso Carnes diuersae additae, ex quibus est aliquid quod assimilatur scorpioni multorum pedum: et ex ea est caro cancerosa, lapidea, fusci coloris: et ex ea est quae est caro lenis, non fusci coloris.	When and what kinds of flesh are added to the flesh that is born in the nose, from which something is made that assimilates the scorpion of many feet: and from this is the flesh of cancer, the lapia, of a pale color; and from this is the meat that is soft, not of a pale color.
In ea ergo quae ex istis carnibus est lenis, non fraudulenta, neque cancerosa, oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas oppositum soli, et aperi nares eius, et proiice uncinum in illas carnes: deinde trahe eas ad exteriora, et incide quod comprehendisti ex eis cum spatumili subtili acuto a parte una, donec scias quod caro tota iam ablata est.	In that which is of the said meats soft and not deceitful, nor cancerous, it is fit that thou shouldest cause him to sit between thine hands opposite to the sun, and open his nostrils, and put in a sharp hook on the side: then draw them towards the exterior, and cut what thou hast taken from them with a sharp and subtle chisel: then shalt thou know that all the flesh is now removed.
Quod si remaneret aliquid ex ea cuius abscisio non est possibilis: tunc rade illud cum uno instrumentorum subtilium cum facilitate, donec non remaneat ex eo aliquid.	If anything remains that cannot be cut off: then carefully remove it with a fine instrument until nothing is left.
Si autem sanguis tibi dominatur, aut accidat apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei per id quod oportet: aut est ex apostematibus malignis, tunc propera cauterizando eum, donec abscindatur sanguis, et auferantur omnes carnes.	If, however, blood is in control of you, or an injury occurs that is warm and swollen: then oppose it with what is necessary; or if it is a malignant apoplexy, then approach cauterizing it, until the blood is cut off, and all flesh is removed.
Deinde proiiciatur in nasum post incisionem acetum, et aqua, aut uinum.	Then let it be applied to the nose after cutting with vinegar, and water, or wine.
Si autem aperitur nasus, et procedat ex eo humiditas usque ad palatum, tunc scias quia iam sanus est.	If, however, the nose is opened, and moisture proceeds from it all the way to the palate, then you shall know that he is already well.
Si uero non penetrat humiditas, secundum quod oportet, tunc scias quod intra ipsum est caro nata in superioribus ossibus naris, ad quae non peruenit cum incisione instrumentum.	If, however, the moisture does not penetrate, as it should, then you shall know that within the upper bones of the nose there is a birthmark which the knife cannot reach.
Tunc ergo oportet, ut intromittas filum lini cui sit quaedam grossitudo, et noda in eo nodos multos: et pone inter omnem nodum quantitatem digiti, aut minus: et ingeniet infirmus, ut mittat extremitatem unam fili in nasum cum radio, aut cum quo possibile est ei postquam fecerit ipsum simile azer: et trahat odoratum suum, donec perueniat usque ad caassum, et egrediatur super guttur suum.	Then it is necessary that you insert a thread of linen which has some grossness, and many nodules in it: and place between each nodule the length of your finger, or less: and let him sneeze, so that he sends one end of the thread into his nose with a ray, or with whatever is possible for him to do after he has done this himself; and let him sniff, until it reaches his throat, and then let him spit it out.
Et multotiens quidem faciunt simile huic Attomi pueri in scholis: et est res facilis ei, qui uult.	And many times indeed do these boys make this atom similar in schools; and it is a easy thing for him who wants to do it.
Deinde pone duas extremitates fili, extremitatem unam quae egreditur super nasum, et alteram quae remansit in naso.	Then place the two ends of the thread, one which goes out over the nose, and the other which remains in the nose.
Deinde ac ministra serraturam carnis cum nodis qui sunt in filo.	Then tie a knot in the thread with the nodules that are in the thread.
Fac illud donec scias quod carnes iam sunt cum nodis fili.	Make it tight so that you shall know that the flesh is already with the nodules in the thread.
Deinde extrahe filum: et pone in nasum post abstersionem sanguinis licinium quod imbibisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud tribus diebus, aut plus, donec unguentum corrodat totum quod remansit ex carnibus.	Then pull out the thread: and put into the nose after the removal of blood the liquid that you have imbibed in Egyptian ointment: make it three days, or more, until the ointment has eaten away all that remained of the flesh.
Deinde pone in fine rei in nasum cannulam de plumbo, diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	Then place at the end of the thing a cannula of lead in the nose for several days until it heals.
Si autem indiget curatione quae exiccet, utere illa.	If it does not heal with the cure that dries up, then use that one.
Ad caputpurgium faciendum, cum quo distillantur olea, et aliae medicinae in nasum, fac illud ex argento, aut aere: quod sit simile lampadi paruae, apertum sicut conchula: et meatus eius similiter.	For the cure for nosebleeds, when they are distilled with oil and other medicines into the nose, make it of silver or brass: that it be similar to a small lantern, opened like a shell: and its passage also.
Et si uis fac cannulam clausam, sicut canna.	And if you want to make a closed cannula, like a reed.
Et conchula instrumenti ad caputpurgium faciendum, sit plena, detecta: cui sit manubrium in postremo eius, cum quo teneas ipsam, quando calefacis in ea oleum, aut quod uis ex succis, et rebus fluxibilibus.	And the shell of the instrument for the cure of nosebleeds should be full, and well-sealed: whose handle is at the end of it, which you hold when you heat oil in it, or what you want to pour into it, and fluid things.
Et haec est forma instrumenti.	And this is the shape of the instrument.
¶ De cura Thelul nasi.	On the cure for nosebleeds.
Caput XXV.	Chapter 25. On the Cure of Nosebleeds
Multotiens nascitur in extremitate nasi Thelul, et magnificatur, et augmentatur cum diebus, donec foedus fit aspectus eius.	Nosebleeds often arise at the end of the nose and become more severe and greater with the passing of days until they appear like a wound.
Et propter illud oportet, ut in cidas illud in principio apparitionis eius, et eradices totum eius.	And for this, when it first appears, you should cut it all out.
Deinde pone super locum, aut cauterium, aut medicinam comburentem quae stat loco eius.	Then place over the spot, or a caustic, or burning medicine that stands in its place.
Si ergo tardatur incisio eius, donec magnificetur, tunc considera, si est lapideum, durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro: quoniam apostema est cancerosum.	If the incision is then delayed until it becomes more severe, consider it, if it is hard, dry in color, and of few senses: then do not touch it with iron: for it is a cancerous spot.
Multotiens enim uidi, qui incidit hmoni apostema, et accidit ex eo malicia magna super illum qui ipsum habebat.	For many times water has incised the flesh and led to great evil in that place which had it.
Et si apostema est lenis tactus, non fusci coloris, et uides quod incisio possibilis est in toto eius, tunc euacua infirmum, et incide ipsum sine timore, absque pauore: et cura locum cum eo quod exiccat et constringit, donec sanetur.	And if the spot is not hard and of few senses, and you see that the incision can be made in all of it, then make the sick person well, and cut him without fear or hesitation: and cure the place along with it, until it heals over.
¶ De sutura nasi, et labii, et auris.	On the sewing up of the nose, lips, and ears.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter 26.
Scias Quia quando accidit solutio continuitatis in una harum cartilaginum, parum confert in ea operatio, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	You should know that when a break occurs in one of the cartilages of the nose, surgery is not effective unless in certain people.
Oportet ergo quando accidit alicui aliquid ex illo, ut consideres, si est uulnus recens cum sanguine suo: et tunc aggrega duolabia uulneris cum sutura: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Therefore, when such a thing has happened to someone, you should consider whether it is a recent fracture with its own blood: and then add two wounds together with sutures: and then take care of the wound until it heals.
Et si solutionis continuitatis labia iam separata sunt, et facta est unaquaeque pars sana: tunc oportet ut excories omnem partem a cute sua apparente, donec sanguinetur.	And if the break has already separated the lips, and some healthy parts have been formed: then it is necessary that you cut off all of its skin from the outside, until it bleeds.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cum sutura, et stringe ea, et pulueriza super ipsum sanguinem draconis, et olibanum trita: et pone supra pulueres frustum emplastri diafinicon, et alicuius alterius ex emplastris consolidatiuis: et dimitte ipsum ligatum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then add two lips together with sutures, and tie them tightly, and sprinkle the wound with dragon's blood, and crushed holly; and put over the powder a fragment of plaster of Paris, and some other consolidated plaster: and let it be bound for two days, or three.
Deinde solue ipsum, et permuta medicinam: et dimitte ipsum, donec abscindantur fila per se.	Then loosen it, and change the medicine: and let it go, until the hairs grow together by themselves.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the wound with ointment, until it heals.
Modus autem suturae est, ut aggreges solutionem continuitatis, aut cum acubus, sicut narrauimus in sutura uentris: aut aggrega solutionem cum filo, sicut feci te scire.	The method of suturing is, to add the solution of a break, or with needles, as we have told you about suturing an eye; or to add the solution with a thread, as I have made you aware.
¶ De extractione nodorum labiorum.	On the extraction of nodules from the lips:
Caput XXVII.	Chapter 27.
Multis Quidem hominibus accidunt plaerumque in interioribus labiorum suorum apostemata dura similia granis herbi: et quaedam eorum minora, et maiora.	Many people have hard nodules in the inner part of their lips, similar to small grains of herbs; and some of them are smaller, and others are larger.
Ergo oportet ut conuertas labium, et findas super omnem nodum eius, et suspendas ipsum cum uncino, et incidas ipsum ab omni parte.	Therefore, you should turn the lips inside out, and find all the nodule, and hang it by a hook, and drop it from all sides.
Deinde impleas locum post incisionem zegi trito, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then fill the space under the cut with dried blood that has been crushed, until the blood is dried up.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto, et curetur locus cum eo, in quo est stipticitas, usquequo sanentur uulnera.	Then clean it with vinegar, and wash the place with it, where there is pain, until the wounds heal.
¶ De incisione carnis natae super gingiuam.	Of the incision born of flesh on the gingivae.
Caput XXVIII.	De incisione carnis natae super gingiuam.
Multotiens nascitur super gingiuam caro addiat, quam antiqui nominant abuluss.	Often a flesh-born wound arises on the gingivae, which the ancients called abluss.
Oportet ergo ut suspendas eam cum uncino: aut teneas eam cum forcipibus, et incidas eam apud radicem suam, et dimittas saniem currere, aut sanguinem.	So it is necessary that you should hang her by a hook; or that you hold her with forceps and cut her close to her root, and let the blood run away, or let the blood flow.
Deinde pone super locum zegi tritum, aut alios pulueres stipticos, exiccatiuos.	Then place on the sore-affected part a dried poultice, or other stimulating powders, drying agents.
Quod si redit illa caro post curationem, nam multotiens redit, tunc incide eam secundo, et cauteriza ipsam: ipsa namque non redit post cauterium.	That if that flesh returns after cure, it often does so again; then cut it again and cauterize it: for she never returns after cauterization.
¶ De rasione Dentium cum ferro.	Of the shaving of teeth with iron.
Caput XXIX.	De rasione dentium cum ferro, ut neque fac
Quandoque aggregantur in superficiebus Dentium ab interiori et extetiori parte, et inter gingiuas cortices asperi, turpes, et quandoque denigrantur, et citrini fiunt, et uirides, donec peruenit ex illo corruptio ad gingiuam, et foedi fiunt dentes per illud.	When the teeth are聚e together in the surface of the tooth from the inner and outer side, and between the gingivae hard tissue, rough hairs, and sometimes wear away, and become yellowed, and white-ish, until the corruption extends to the gingiva, and the teeth become rotten by that.
Oportet ergo ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et caput eius in sinu tuo, et rade molam et dentem, in quo apparent tibi cortices, et res similis arenae: donec non remaneat ex eis aliquid, et similiter fac de nigredine, et uiriditate, et citrinitate, et aliis donec mundentur.	So it is necessary that you should place the sick hand between your hands, and the head of the patient in your lap, and shave off the molars and teeth on which appear to you the gums, and similar material like sand: until there remains nothing of them, and likewise do the same for the blackness, and whiteness, and yellowing, and other disorders until they are cleansed.
Si ergo auferatur quod in eis est a principio rasionis, bonum est: et si non, tunc itera super eos rasionem die alio, secundo, et tertio, donec ad ultimum perueniat studium in eo quod uis.	If then that which is in them from the beginning of shaving is removed, it is good: but if not, then repeat the shaving on them every other day, and third time, until the final study has come to them what you want.
Et scias, quod dens indiget rasoriis diuersarum formarum, multarum figurarum: secundum quod praeparatur operationi tuae: proptera, quod rasorium quo raditur dens ab inferiori parte, est aliud a rasorio quo raditur inter dentes, secundum formas alias.	And you should know that the teeth are used to different shapes of razors, and to many figures: second, the razor with which it is ras ed from below is different from the razor with which it is ras ed between teeth, according to other forms.
Et istae formae rasoriorum sint apud te praeparatae, quas uides.	These forms of razors are prepared for you, which you see.
¶ De extractione doloris Dentium.	Regarding the extraction of pain from teeth.
Caput XXX.	Chapter 30.
Oportet ut cures Dentem a dolore suo cum omni ingenio, et tardes in eradicatione eius.	It is necessary that you treat the tooth with all your skill and quickly remove it from the source of pain.
Non est enim quod uicem eius suppleat quando eradicatur: quoniam est substantia sublimis: donec quando non est excusatio de eradicatione eius, tunc oportet quando cogitur infirmus eradicare ipsum, ut firmetur, et certificetur apud te dens dolens.	For the tooth should not be left to heal on its own when it is removed, as the substance is delicate: until a time when there is no excuse for the removal of it, then it should be removed carefully, and certified by you to the complaining patient.
Multotiens enim decipit infirmum dolor, et putat quia est in dente saha et eradicat ipsum: deinde non recedit dolor, donec eradicetur dens infirmus.	For many times pain deceives the sick person, and he thinks that the pain is in the tooth and removes it himself: afterwards, he does not cease to have pain until the tooth is removed from the source of pain.
Nos enim iam uidimus illud ex operatione phlebotomatorum.	For we have already seen this from the operation of bloodletting.
Cum ergo certificatur apud te dens dolens ipsemet, tunc oportet ut scarifices in circumitu dentis cum spatumili, in quo sit quiddam uirtutis, donec soluatur gingiua ab omni parte: deinde moue ipsum digitis tuis, aut cum forcipibus subtilibus in primis paulatim, donec concutias ipsum.	When, therefore, the tooth is certified to you by the complaining patient, then it should be scraped with a small scraper, which has some strength, until the gum is completely removed from all sides: then, with your fingers or with delicate forceps, slowly cut off the tip, until you hear it crack.
Deinde loca tunc in eo forcipes magnos locatione bona, et caput infirmi inter genua tua: quod iam bene tenuisti, ita quod non moueatur: deinde trahe dentem secundum rectitudinem, ut non frangas ipsum.	Then, when you have well positioned the forceps in the good place, and the head of the patient is between his knees: which you hold well, so that it does not move: then, pull the tooth along its straight line, so as not to break it.
Si ergo non egreditur, tunc accipe aliquod illorum instrumentorum, et intromitte ipsum sub eo ab omni parte cum facilitate, et conare motionem eius, sicut fecisti in primis.	If, however, it does not come out, then take one of their instruments and push it in from all sides with ease, and try to move it, as you did before.
Si autem dens est perforatus, aut corrosus: tunc oportet ut impleas illud foramen panno: et stringas ipsum cum extremitate radii subtilis, ut non frangatur in hora constrictionis tuae super ipsum cum forcipibus.	If, however, the tooth is either pierced or corroded: then it should be filled with cloth: and you should hold it with a small hook at its tip, so that it does not break when you squeeze it with forceps.
Et oportet, ut exquisite agas cum scarificatione in circumitu gingiuae ab omni parte multum.	And it is necessary, so that you do not get the scraping around the gum well.
Et custodi fortitudinem tuam, ut non frangas ipsum, et remaneat pars eius, et redeat super infirmum ex ea malicia quae sit maior dolore eius primo.	And keep your strength, so that you do not break it, and a part of it remains, and returns to the sick from which greater pain comes at first.
Et caue, ne facias illud quod ignorantes faciunt phlebotomatores in festinatione sua, et audacia ipsorum super eradicationem eius, praeter quod administrent illud quod narrauimus.	And so, do not do that which the phlebotomators do in their haste, and their boldness in eradicating it, except that they administer to it what we have related.
Multotiens enim faciunt euenire super homines infirmitates magnas, quarum difficiliores sunt ut frangantur, et remaneant radices eius omnes, aut quaedam earum: aut ut extrahant ipsum cum quibusdam ossibus mandibulae: sicut testificati sumus multotiens illud.	For often they bring about great sicknesses in men, which are more difficult to be broken, and leave the roots of them all, or some part thereof; or take it out with certain bones of the jaw: as we have been frequently assured that this is done.
Deinde colluatur post eradicationem eius cum uino, aut cum aceto et sale.	Then let it be cleansed after its eradication with wine, or with vinegar and salt.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis ex locis (multotiens enim accidit) tunc tere aliquid ex zegi, et imple cum eo locum: et si non, cauteriza ipsum si non confert tibi zegi.	That if a flux of blood should come from the places (for often it comes) then let some of the plaster be removed and filled with the blood, and let that place be so; and if not, let it be cauterized, if it does not give you plaster.
Formae forcipum subtilium quibus mouetur dens in primis, sint longarum extremitatum, breuis manubrii, grossi, ut non duplicentur quando cum eis premitur super dentem: sint sicut uides grossorum manubriorum, donec quando stringis cum eis, non dent seipsas, neque duplicentur: breuium extremitatum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut ex faled decenter facti, directarum extremitatum: et in eorum extremitatibus sint dentes, quorum quidam ingrediantur in quosdam, et stringant constrictione decenti, forti.	The shapes of the pincers should be such that they move easily at first, and then do not open when pressure is applied to them on the tooth: they should be like the large fingers, until when you press them they do not open themselves, nor do they open; their ends should be thick, and made of iron or of a hard pewter, straight ends: and in their ends should be teeth, some of which enter into certain ones, and close by constriction, so as to bite strongly.
Et quandoque fiunt extremitates sicut forma oris auis quae nominatur ciconia, et sunt fortis constrictionis.	And when they are made at the ends like the shape of an ear which is called a crow, and are of strong constriction.
¶ De eradicatione Dentium, et extractione ossium mandibularum fractorum.	Of the eradication of teeth and extraction of bones of the jaw fractured.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter 31.
Quando remanet apud eradicationem Dentis qui frangitur aliquid, tunc oportet ut ponas super locum cotum cum butyro die uno, aut duobus diebus, donec mollificetur locus: deinde intromitte ad ipsum algasti, aut forcipes: quorum extremitates assimilantur ori auis quae nominatur ciconia.	When a tooth is broken and something remains after its eradication, then let it be placed on the place with butter one day, or two days, until it softens: then let it be inserted into it with a chisel, or a pincers; their ends should be like an ear which is called a crow.
Forma autem haec est forcipum.	The shape of this pincher is as follows.
Sint extremitates eorum factae sicut lima deintus: aut sicut aliskilfegi.	Have the extremities made as a file inside: or like an alligator's skin.
Si ergo non obedit tibi ad exitum cum istis forcipibus, tunc oportet, ut caues super radicem, et detegas carnem totam, et intromittas instrumentum quod nominatur Palanca parua, cuius forma est haec.	But if he does not obey you to the exit with these tweezers, then you should caustice on the root, and peel off all the flesh, and insert an instrument called a small tongs, whose shape is this.
Sit breuis extremitatis, grossae parumper: et non sit imbibitum, ut non frangatur.	Set short the end, a little longer the thick one: and let it not be dipped, lest it should break.
Si ergo egreditur radix per illud, est bonum: et si non, iuuare oportet cum istis instrumentis aliis quorum formae sunt istae.	But if the root goes out by that, it is good: and if not, you should move with these other instruments whose shapes are these.
Forma primi triangulatae extremitatis, in qua est quaedam grossitudo.	The shape of the first end, in which there is some thickness.
Forma triangulatae extremitatis subtilis.	The shape of the slim end.
Etiam iuuatur cum hoc instrumento habente duos ramos, cuius haec est forma.	Also move with this instrument having two branches, whose shape is this.
Et cum aliis instrumentis et ferramentis quae praecesserunt in rasione dentium.	And with the other instruments and tools which have gone before in the order of teeth.
Etiam sit iuuamentum cum hoc instrumento quod assimilatur uncino magno, huius formae, triangulatae extremitatis tortae, in qua est quiddam grossitudinis, ut non frangatur: et sit non imbibitum.	Also sit the clamp with this instrument which is like a big hook, of this shape, of the twisted slim end, in which there is some thickness, so that it should not break: and let it not be dipped, lest it should break.
Et scias, quod instrumenta dentium sunt multa: et similiter reliqua instrumenta non computantur, et artifex prudens, subtilis in arte sua inuenit per se ipsum instrumentum, secundum quod significant ei operatio et aegritudines ipsae.	And know that there are many instruments for teeth: and the other instruments also do not count, and the prudent artisan discovers himself alone the instrument, according to which signified to him the operation and illnesses themselves.
Quoniam ex agritudinibus sunt ad quas non dixerunt antiqui instrumentum, propter diuersitatem specierum earum.	For from diseases there are to those for which the ancient instrument did not speak, because of the diversity of their species.
Si autem frangatur os ex mandibula, aut ex aliis ossibus oris, aut putrefit: tunc perscrutare super ipsum in loco suo cum eo quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis et forcipibus quae dixi in extractione radicum, et iuuare cum gesti, cuius forma est haec.	But if a bone breaks from the jaw, or from any other bones of the mouth, then examine above it at its place with that which belongs to it out of the instruments and tweezers which I have spoken in extracting the root, and move with the gesture, whose shape is this.
Sit in eo quiddam grossitudinis paulatim, ut stringatur, uel teneatur cum eo os, et non fugiat et uadat, donec egrediatur os: et restaura locum cum medicinis conuenientibus ad illud.	Set at it some thickness gradually, so that it is stretched, or held with it the jaw bone, and does not move and push, until it goes out the jaw: and restore the place with suitable medicines for it.
Si autem in osse est putredo parua, tunc rade ipsum a putredine sua, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	If, however, there is pus in the bone, then saw off the part affected by the pus and treat it until it heals.
De serratura Dentium eminentium super alios.	Of the important locking of teeth on others.
Caput XXXII.	Chapter III. On the locking of teeth.
Quando Dentes eminent non secundum cursum suum naturalem, foeda fit per illud forma: et praecipue quando accidit illud in mulieribus, et puellis, scilicet uenalibus.	When teeth are not at their natural angle, they become rotten from the form of the mouth; and especially when this happens to women and girls, that is, young people.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	It is necessary for you to consider.
Nam si dens est natus post dentem alium, et non locatur, uel est possibilis eius serratura, neque limatura ipsius: tunc eradica ipsum: et si est annexus cum dente alio, tunc incide ipsum cum isto instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	For if one tooth has come after another, and does not fit in place, nor can its lock be made or the grinding be done; then you should cut it out: and if it is joined to a neighboring tooth, then you should cut it with this instrument, of which the following form is.
Est simile rostro paruo, et fit ex ferro indo, acutae extremitatis ualde.	It is like a small chisel, and is made of hard iron, with an acute end.
Et sit incisio tua qua ipsum incidis in diebus multis, et propter duriciem dentis, et ut non commoueatur alius ex dentibus.	And let your cut be deep, so that you cut it over many days, and because of the hardness of the tooth, and so that it does not move one of the other teeth.
Si autem est eminens expositus limaturae suae: tunc lima ipsum cum lima ex indo, cuius forma est haec.	If, however, there is a prominent exposure of its grinding: then grind it with a chisel made of hard iron, the form of which is as follows.
Sit totum ex indo, et manubrium eius minutorum punctorum ualdae, sicut lima cum qua fiunt acus: cum quo limetur dens paulatim in diebus multis cum facilitate, ut non commoueatur dens, et cadat: deinde leni ipsum, in fine rade ipsum cum quibusdam rasoriis.	It should all be made of iron, and the small point of its tip should be ground off like a chisel, as is done with an awl: so that the tooth can be grating little by little over many days with ease, so that it does not move the teeth, and then allow it to be sharpened at the end, grinding it with some rasps.
Quod si est dens, ex quo frangatur pars, et laedit linguam: tunc oportet ut limes eum etiam, donec auferatur asperitas illius fractionis, et aequetur: et applanetur, et non laedat linguam, neque corrumpat sermonem.	If a tooth is broken off, and hurts the tongue: then you should also sharpen that part, until it is smooth, and make it even: and then smooth it out, so that it does not hurt the tongue, nor damage speech.
¶ De retatione Dentium cum filis auri.	On the retention of teeth with gold fill.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter III. On the retention of teeth with gold fill.Si D
Quando accidit Dentibus anterioribus concussio et commotio a percussione, aut casu: et non potest infirmus stringere super illud quod comedit ut non cadat: et curasti eos cum medicinis stipticis, et non ualuit curatio: tunc ingenium in eis est, ut stringantur cum filo auri: quoniam argentum fit uiride, et putrefit post dies: sed aurum nunquam mutatur.	When there is a blow and jolt to the anterior teeth from a blow, or by accident: and it cannot be held fast to its place, so that it falls out: and it does not improve with careful treatment, then take a sharp wire and retain them with gold: because gold turns green, and spoils after many days; but gold never changes.
Et sit filum medium in subtilitate et grossicie secundum quantitatem quod capiat inter Dentes.	And let there be a thread medium in subtility and coarseness according to the quantity that it takes between teeth.
Et forma quidem retationis est, ut accipias filum, et intromittas duplum eius inter duos dentes sanos: deinde texeas cum duabus extremitatibus fili inter dentes motos, siue unus sit, aut plures, donec peruenias cum tela usque ad dentem sanum alterius partis.	And the form of retraction is such that you take a thread and introduce it between two healthy teeth: then tie it with both ends between them, or one or more, until you come to the other side of the tooth with the thread.
Deinde itera texturam usque ad partem a qua incaepisti: et stringe manum tuam cum subtilitate et sapientia, donec non remoueatur prorsus: et sit constrictio tua qua stringis filum, apud radices dentium, ut non euadat.	Then iterate the texture until the part from which you began: and tighten your hand with subtlety and wisdom, until it does not move at all: and let your constriction be where you tighten the thread, near the roots of the teeth, so that it does not move.
Deinde incide extremitates fili superfluentes cum forficibus: et aggrega utrumque, et conuerte eas cum gesti: et occulta ipsas inter dentem sanum et dentem motum, ut non laedat linguam: deinde dimittatur ita strictum dum remanet.	Then cut off the ends of the thread with the forceps: and gather both together, and bend them with your hand: and hide them between a healthy tooth and a moving tooth, so that they do not hurt the tongue: then let it be loosened in such a way as to remain strict.
Si autem soluitur, aut inciditur, stringe eos cum filo alio, et stabit cum eo taliter tempore toto.	If however it has loosened, or has been cut, tighten them with another thread, and let it stand with it in such a way for all the time.
Et haec est forma Dentium, et figura retationis duorum dentium sanorum, et duorum dentium motorum, sicut uides.	And this is the form of the teeth, and the figure of retraction of two healthy teeth and two moving teeth, as you see them.
Et quandoque fit, ut redeat dens unus, aut duo post casum urriusque in locis suis, et retentur sicut narrauimus, et remaneant: et non facit illud nisi artifex, prudens, et expertus.	And when it is that one tooth has fallen, or two behind in its place, and remains as we have described, and does not make it except the craftsman be skilled, prudent, and experienced.
Et quandoque aptatur aliquod ex ossibus uaccinis: et fit ex eo sicut forma dentis, et ponitur in loco, ex quo munitur dens et stringitur, sicut diximus: et remanet, et seruitur cum eo tempore longo.	And when one of the ribs is broken: and it is made out of it like the form of a tooth, and is put in its place, from which it is protected, and tightened, as we have said: and remains, and adheres to it for a long time.
¶ De incisione ligamenti quod accidit sub lingua, et prohibet loquelam.	Regarding the incision of the ligament that happens under the tongue, and prevents it from speaking.
Caput XXXIIII.	Head 34.
Quandoque ligamentum hoc quod accidit sub lingua, est aut naturale, cum quo nascitur homo, aut accidentale, a uulnere quod iam consolidatum est.	When the ligament which happens under the tongue, is either natural, with which man is born, or accidental, from an arrow that has already healed.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi in capite eius in sinu tuo, et eleua linguam eius: deinde incide illud ligamentum neruosum per latitudinem, donec soluatur lingua a retentione sua.	And the operation is, so that you open the jaw of the patient in his head in your neck and clear his tongue; and then cut this nerve ligament across its width until the tongue is released from its hold.
Quod si in eo fuerit quiddam duriciei et nodationis, et fuerit illud ex consolidatione uulneris: tunc proiice in illud uncinum, et finde illud per latitudinem, donec incidas ligamentum, et soluatur nodatio.	If there is anything hard and stiff in it and it is from the consolidering of a wound, then throw into it a hook and cut it across its width until you hit the ligament, and let go of the stiffness.
Et caue, ne sit fissura in profundo carnis, et incidas arteriam illic, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And let him not make a crack in the deep flesh there, and cut the artery there, and let there be a flow of blood.
Deinde colluatur in uestigio incisionis cum aqua rosata, aut cum aceto, aut aqua frigida.	Then rinse the incision with rosewater, or vinegar, or cold water.
Deinde pone sub lingua licinium ex lino, quod teneat infirmus in omni nocte: ut non consolidetur secundo.	Then put under the tongue a piece of linen that holds the weak one all night, so that it does not harden again.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc pone super locum zegi tritum.	But if there is a flow of blood, then put on the place a crushed piece.
Si uero uincit te sanguis, tunc cauteriza locum cum cauterio lentiginoso, quod conuenit ad illud: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	But if you are pricked by blood, then cauterize the place with a lentil cautery that suits it; and then care for him with the rest of the cure, until he heals.
¶ De extractione Ranulae quae fit sub lingua.	The extraction of a sore that is under the tongue.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter LXXXI.
Quandoque accidit sub lingua apostema quod assimilatur Ranae paruae, prohibens linguam ab operatione sua naturali: et fortasse magnificatur adeo, donec implet os.	When a little sore under the tongue is absorbed that has become like a small rana, prohibiting the tongue from its natural function: and perhaps it grows bigger so much that the jaw is filled up.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi coram sole: et considera apostema.	And the operation is, so that you open the jaw without a doctor with the sun: and consider the sore.
Si ergo uides ipsum fusci coloris, aut nigri, durum, cui non inuenit infirmus sensum: tunc non tangas ipsum, quoniam est cancer.	But if you see that the color of the sore is dark, or black, or hard, and there is no feeling for it of the patient: then do not touch it, for it is a cancer.
Et si est decliue ad albedinem, in quo est humiditas, tunc proiice in ipsum uncinum, et incide ipsum cum spatumili subtili, et libera ipsum ab omni parte.	And if it falls into whiteness, in which there is moisture, then throw into it a hook, and cut the sore with a very fine awl, and free it from all sides.
Quod si uincit te sanguis in hora tuae operationis, tunc pone super ipsum zegi tritum, donec abscindatur sanguis: deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec extrahas ipsum cum complemento eius.	If your blood pricks you in the hour of your surgery, then put under the sore a crushed piece, until the blood stops flowing: and then return to your surgery, until it is extracted from its bulk with its supplement.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto et sale: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then clean with vinegar and salt: and care for it with suitable cure until it heals.
¶ De curatione apostematis duarum Amigdalarum.	The treatment of abscesses of the two amygdales.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter XXXVI.
Quandoque accidunt inter guttur godad, id est, glandulae, quae similantur algodad, quae accidunt deforis: et nominantur duae Amigdalae: quas quando curas cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non sanantur, tunc considera.	When abscesses occur between the cheeks, that is, the glands, which are akin to abscesses, and which occur on either side: when cure with the above-mentioned method does not help them, then observe.
Si ergo est apostema durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro.	If, however, the abscess is hard, of a pale colour, and of little smell: then do not touch the abscess with iron.
Et si est rubei coloris, et radix eius est grossa: tunc non tangas ipsum etiam cum ferro, timens fluxum sanguinis, imo dimitte ipsum, donec maturetur.	And if its colour is red, and its root is thick: then do not touch it with iron, fearing a flow of blood, but leave it, until it heals.
Et tunc aut perforabis ipsum: aut rumpetur per se.	And then either pierce it: or let it burst of itself.
Et si est albi coloris, rotundum, et est radix eius subtilis: tunc oportet ipsum incidi.	And if its colour is white, round, and its root is thin: then the abscess should be opened.
Et operatio in ipso est, ut consideres ante operationem suam, si quieuit apostema eius calidum quiete completum, aut imminuitur quadam diminutione: tunc ergo fac sedere infirmum coram sole, et caput eius sit in sinu tuo: et aperi os eius, et accipiat seruiens inter manus suas, et premat linguam eius inferius cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	And the operation on it is such that you should consider before the operation whether the abscess is hot and quiet, completed, or rather threatened with some decrease: then let him sit down in front of the sun, and place his head in your lap: and open his mouth, and take hold between his hands, and press his tongue down with a tool, which has this shape.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere, quod sit subtile sicut cultellus.	Let it be made of silver, or of brass, that it may be sharp like a knife.
Cum ergo premis cum eo linguam, et ostenditur tibi apostema, et cadit super ipsum uisus tuus: tunc accipe uncinum, et fige ipsum in amigdalam, et extrahe eam ad exteriora quantum potes, praeter quod trahas cum ea aliquid ex tunicis.	When you press it with the tongue and a swelling appears on your side: then take hold of a hook, and fix it in the amygdal, and draw it out as far as you can, pulling with it some of the skin.
Deinde incide eam cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma quae sequitur.	Then open it with the instrument which has this shape.
Assimilatur forficibus: uerumtamen extremitates eius sint curuatae, ita quod orificium cuiusque earum est in directo alterius acute: unde cura ut sit ex ferro indo, aut alfuled imbibitum.	It is joined to the other by a ligament: therefore take care that its ends are not cut, so that the opening of each of them is in the direct line of the other: hence the cure should be with iron ingot, or an alloyed copper.
Si autem non est praesens hoc instrumentum, tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili, cuius haec est forma.	If this instrument is not present, then cut it with a chisel, which has this form.
Sit acutum a parte una, non acutum a parte altera.	This blade should be sharp on one side and dull on the other.
Et postquam incidis amigdalam unam, incide alteram secundum hanc eandem speciem incisionis.	And when you cut one side of the cheekbone, cut the other second according to this form of cutting.
Deinde post incisionem gargarizet infirmus cum aqua frigida, aut cum aceto et aqua.	Then after the incision, the patient should gargle with cold water or with vinegar and water.
Si autem accidat ei fluxus sanguinis, gargarizet cum aqua in qua bulliti sunt cortices granatorum: aut folia myrti, et similia illis ex stipticis, donec abscindatur fluxus sanguinis: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	But if there is a flow of blood, gargle with water in which the bark of the willow has been boiled: or leaves of myrtle and like things from the astringent, until the flow of blood stops: and then take care of the wound, until it heals.
Et quandoque nascuntur in gutture apostemata alia, praeter amigdalas duas.	And when there are blisters in the throat that are not attached to the two cheekbones.
Incide ergo ea secundum quod dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum aequaliter.	Then cut these according to what I have said in cutting the two cheekbones evenly.
Et ego quidem iam medicatus fui mulierem ex apostemate, quod natum erat inter guttur eius, quod trahebat ad fuscedinem, pauci sensus, quod iam fere clauserat guttur: et mulier respirabat a meatu stricto, et iam prohibuerat ei comestionem, et potum aquae: et iam peruenerat ad mortem, si remansisset uno die, aut duobus diebus.	And I have already treated a woman with a blisters that had grown between her throat, which was causing hoarseness, little sense, and almost closed her throat: and this woman breathed through my narrowed throat, and had already stopped eating, drinking water, and was close to death if it had lasted another day or two.
Et apostema tantum ascenderat, quod emiserat duos ramos, donec exierant super duo foramina nasi.	And the blister had risen only as much as to make two small bumps, until they had come out of the two nostrils.
Properaui ergo festinanter, et fixi in unum eorum uncinum.	So I hurried along and fixed myself on one of their hooks.
Deinde traxi ipsum, et tracta ex eo est portio magna.	Then I pulled it out, and a large piece came out with it.
Deinde abscidi eam, ubi comprehendi ex foramine nasi.	Then I cut it off where it had come out of the nostril hole.
Deinde feci illud ei quod processit ex foramine nasi altero.	Then I made her go forward from the other nostril hole.
Deinde aperui os eius, et pressi linguam eius: et postea fixi uncinum in ipsum apostema: deinde abscidi ex eo partem eius, et non cucurrit ex eo nisi sanguis paucus: absolutum est ergo guttur mulieris, et incepit statim bibere aquam, deinde accepit ex cibo.	Then I opened her mouth and touched her tongue: and then fixed the hook in the blister: and then cut off a part of it, and there was little blood coming out of it: so the woman's throat is absolutely well, and she began to eat right away.
Non ergo cessaui incidere ex illo apostemate multotiens tempore longo: et apostema succedebat loco eius quod incidebam, donec prolongatum est nimis et cum ea illud.	I did not stop to put on a lot of times for a long time: and the poultice succeeded in place where I hit, until it was too prolonged and with him that thing.
Ingeniaui ergo, et cauterizaui apostema inter guttur.	So then, I put a poultice on it between the teeth.
Stetit ergo ab additione: deinde ambulaui a parte, et non sciui quid fecit Deus cum ea post me.	Then he stayed away from the addition: then I walked away from that part, and I don't know what God did with it after me.
¶ De incisione apostematis uuulae.	On the poultice on the wound.
Caput XXXVII.	Chapter 37. On the poultice on the wound.
Quando descendit catarrus ad uuulam, et apostematur, et est long: tunc ipsa nominatur perpendicularis: et si est in inferiori parte grossa, rotunda, tunc ipsa nominatur uua.	When a catarrh descends to the wound, and is poulticed, and it is long: then it is called perpendicular; and if it is in the lower part thick, round, then it is called a pouch.
Quando curatur cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: et uides quod apostema calidum quieuit ab ea, et est subtilis: tunc oportet ut incidas eam.	When it is treated with what we said about the separation, and does not bring about a cure; and you see that the poultice has grown cold from it, and has thinned out: then you should hit it.
Et quae ex ea est aggregata rotunda, et non est ei longitudo, et est sanguinea, aut fusci coloris, aut nigri, et non est ei sensus: tunc oportet ut deuites incisionem eius.	And what is gathered together on it round, and has no length, and is bloody or dark in color, or black, and has no feeling: then you should hit the incision.
In ea enim est timor super infirmum.	For in that poultice there is a fear over the wound.
Oportet ergo quando uides eam secundum modum quem dixi ex albedine, et longitudine sua, ut facias sedere infirmum coram sole: et premas linguam eius cum instrumento, cuius praecessit narratio: deinde fige uncinum in uuam, et trahe eam inferius: et incide eam cum uno duorum instrumentorum quae dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum.	Then when you see it in the way that I said out of whiteness, and according to its length, so that you set the sick person before the sun: and press his tongue with an instrument, whose predecessor I told you; then fasten a hook on the wound, and pull it down: and hit it with one or two instruments which I said for hitting the two amygdales.
Et oportet ut non incidas ex ea, nisi illud quod additur super naturalem terminum sine additione.	And you should not hit out of it, unless that which is added to it on a natural limit without addition.
Nam si tu incidis ex ea plus, laedes uocem et sermonem.	For if you hit out of it more, then you wound the voice and speech.
Deinde post incisionem utere eo quod narrauimus in incisione duarum amigdalarum: et cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then after hitting it use what I told you in the incision of the two amygdales: and take care of it, until it heals.
Si autem terretur infirmus ab incisione: tunc oportet ut utaris ingenio in cauterizatione eius absque timore et pauore.	If however the sick person shudders from the incision: then you should use your wit in cauterizing it without fear and anxiety.
Et modus cauterii in ea non est, nisi cum aqua acuta: et est, ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	And the mode of cauterization is not in her, except with sharp water: and it is, as you put the head of the nurse in your bosom.
Deinde preme linguam eius cum instrumento quod diximus.	Then press her tongue with the instrument which we have said.
Deinde accipe ex aqua quam dixi tibi in capitulo cauterizandi, et confice cum ea calcem non extinctam, et pone eam non spissam, neque subtilem, et imple ex ea concauitatem huius instrumenti, cuius haec est forma.	Then take from the water which I have told you in the chapter of cauterizing, and bind it to this foot that is not extinguished, and put it not thick or thin, and fill it with this instrument whose this form is.
Sit extremitati eius in qua ponitur medicina concauitas, sicut concauitas cochlearis radii.	Sit at the end of her where the medicine is placed, as the ear is placed on the radius.
Et pone instrumentum cum medicina super uuulam ipsam: et infirmus sit iacens super latus suum, ut currat saliua ex ore eius ex intrinseca medicina, ut non descendat ex ea ad guttur ipsius aliquid, et laedat ipsum.	And place the instrument with the medicine on its upper part: and the sick man shall lie on his side, that he may run a salve from his mouth by internal medicine, so that nothing shall descend from it to his throat, and harm him.
Deinde tene manum tuam cum medicina.	Then hold your hand with the medicine.
Et tu ex primas eam super uuulam quantitate medietatis horae, donec uideas eam iam denigratam, et sedatam mordicationem medicinae.	And you from the first shall put on her on a small quantity of the medicine at an hour's time, until you see it has become black, and has eased the tingling of the medicine.
Et si uis ut accipias cotum, et inuoluas ipsum super extremitatem radii, et infundas cotum cum medicina, et intromittas radium cum coto in cannulam desuper, donec adhaereat cotum super uuulam.	And if you will that you take a cup, and pour it on him on the end of the radius, and dip the cup with the medicine, and push the radius with the cup into the canula from above, until the cup adheres to the upper part.
Fac illud multotiens, donec consequaris quod uis de cauterizatione uuae.	Do this many times, until you get what you want in the new cauterization.
Deinde dimitte eam: ipsa namque arescit et cadit post tres dies, aut quatuor.	Then dismiss her: for she will be cured and will fall down after three days, or four.
Quod si indiges ut iteres medicinam, itera ipsam: et post cauterizationem absterge in circumitu uuae cum coto imbibito in butyro, et mundifica cum eo quod est in circumitu eius ex medicina: et colluatur cum aqua frigida.	That if you will be cured that you go the medicine, repeat it: and after the cauterization wash about her a new one with the butter, and purify with it what is in her from the medicine: and rinse with cold water.
Et curetur extrinsecus cum embrocis, et deintus cum gargarismis, donec sanetur.	And he will be cured outwardly with embrocations, and inwardly with gargles, until he is healed.
Haec ergo species curationis est salubrior incisione et longinquior a timore.	This then is the nature of the cure, more salutary than incising, and farther removed from fear.
Et quandoque curatur uuula etiam cum eo quod est subtilius quam cauterium et incisio: curatur enim cum suffumigatione, secundum hunc modum.	And when ever it is necessary to treat with a ring and also with the thread that is thinner than the cautery and incision: for this reason it should be treated with sufumigation in this way.
Sume calamentum, et hyssopum, et origanum, et rutam, et sseah, et chamomillam, et abrotanum, et similia eis ex herbis: et aggrega ea omnia, aut quaedam eorum in olla, et submergantur cum aceto, et bulliant: et olla sit lutata cum luto decenter: et sit in medio ollae foramen, super quod componatur instrumentum concauum secundum hunc modum.	And when ever it is necessary to treat with a ring and also with the thread that is thinner than the cautery and incision: for this reason it should be treated with sufumigation in this way. Take also sumac, hyssop, oregano, rue, sseah (a kind of mint), chamomile, abrotan (mistleto), and similar herbs; and put all of them together, or some of them in a vessel, and immerse them with vinegar and make them boil: and the vessel should be covered with an uneven cloth: and a hole should be made in the middle of the vessel above which should be placed a sharp instrument according to this method.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere: et intromittatur extremitas, in qua est granatum, in os infirmi, donec ascendat uapor ad uuulam super cannulam, donec obscuretur uuula multum.	Let it be made of silver or of brass; and the end in which is the granule should be put into the nosepiece until the vapour ascends to the tube over the cannula until it is very dark.
Deinde itera super ipsam multotiens, donec arescat.	Then repeat this many times, until it burns.
Et caue, ne facias hanc curationem in principio aduentus apostematis.	And do not make this cure at the beginning if there is a wound.
Plaerumque enim addit in apostemate: et non oportet ut facias illud nisi apud declinationem apostematis eius calidi.	For this reason, add it to the wound, and do not make this cure unless it is at the decline of the heat of the wound.
Si autem non est praesens tibi hoc instrumentum, tunc accipe cannam, et compone in extremitate eius corticem oui: ut non comburatur os infirmi: quoniam cortex oui prohibet uaporem comburere os: et haec est ex bona curatione cum salute.	If this instrument is not present with you, then take a tube and fit an end with wax so that it does not burn the nose: for the wax prevents the vapour from burning the nose; and this is good cure with health.
¶ De extractione spinarum, et ossium de gula.	Regarding the extraction of spines and bones from the throat.
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter XXXVIII.
Multotiens adhaeret in gutture os, aut spina piscis, aut aliud.	Often a tooth or a spine or a bone would adhere to the throat.
Oportet ergo ut extrahas quod ex eis est apparens super quod cadit uisus, postquam premis linguam cum instrumento apud solem, et declaratur tibi quod est in gutture.	Then you should extract what is visible above what causes the pain, when you press the tongue with an instrument against the light and tell me that it is in the throat.
Et quod non apparet tibi et occultatur in gutture, oportet ut facias uomere infirmum antequam digeratur cibus in stomacho.	And if what is hidden in the throat does not appear to you, you should make a sick person fast before food digests in his stomach.
Fortasse enim egredietur res annexa per uomitum.	Perhaps the part attached to the body should exit through the umbilicus.
Aut deglutiat infirmus frustum napi, aut radicem lactucae, aut deglutiat buccellam panis sicci: aut accipiat frustum spongiae marinae siccae lenis: et liga ipsum in filo, deinde deglutiat ipsum.	Perhaps the sick person should swallow a dry piece of bread, or a leaf of lettuce, or swallow a dry cracker: or take a dry sea sponge and consume it; and bind it with a string, and then swallow it.
Cum ergo peruenit ad locum ubi sunt spinae, aut os, et extrahitur, tunc egreditur.	When therefore he has reached the place where there are bristles or a tooth, and is removed (from the body), then he comes out.
Si ergo non egreditur cum eo quod diximus: tunc utere instrumento ex plumbo secundum hanc formam.	If, however, he does not come out with it as I have said above: then use an instrument made of tin in the form of a funnel.
Sit grossius quam Radius parumper, et in extremitate eius sit curuitas, quam intromittat in guttur suum cum facilitate: et ipse habeat caput suum eleuatum sursum.	Let it be thicker than the radius by a little bit, and at its end let there be a roundness that can easily be inserted into his throat: and he himself should hold his head raised up.
Et caueat a tactu suae epiglotis, ut non accidat ei tussis, et impellat cum eo os, aut spinam, aut intromittat ipsum medicus manu sua.	And let him avoid touching his epiglottis, so that he does not cough, and pushes (the food) with it into his mouth, or inserts a bristle or a tooth with his own hand.
Verum quod infirmus intromittat, hoc est melius: propter scientiam suam de loco rei annexae: et impellat inferius, aut trahat manum suam cum instrumento sursum, totum illud secundum quantitatem quae praeparatur ei, donec egrediatur.	But because the sick person swallows it, that is better: according to his knowledge of the site of the attached part; and he pushes down or holds up his hand with the instrument, all this according to the quantity prepared for him, until he comes out.
¶ De extractione Sanguisugae.	Regarding the extraction of blood:
Caput XXXIX.	Chapter 39.
Quando medicatur sanguisuga cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex curatione cum medicinis, et non confert, tunc considera in gutture infirmi coram sole, siue apud solem postquam premis linguam eius cum instrumento quod narraui tibi.	When you treat with blood-suckers as I have said above in the division of cure with the medicines, and they do not yield, then note in the throat in front of the light, or near to the light after having touched his tongue with the instrument that I have told you about.
Si ergo cadit uisus tuus super sanguisugam, extrahe eam cum uncino paruo, aut cum gesti subtilibus decenter.	If your yawn falls on a blood-sucker, extract it with a small hook, or with subtle movements, and turn it away.
Quod si non est possibile cum eis: tunc accipe cannulam concauam, et intromitte eam in guttur infirmi usque prope guttur: deinde intromitte in concauitatem cannulae ferrum ignitum cum igne.	If it is not possible with them: then take a closed tube and insert it into the throat up to the place where the throat meets; and then insert into the tube an ignited iron with fire.
Fac illud multotiens: et abstineat infirmus ab aqua tota die.	Make it many times over: and the sick person should abstain from all water during the day.
Deinde accipiat uitreatam plenam aqua frigida, et aperiat os eius in ea: et colluat os suum cum ea, et non deglutiat ex ea aliquid: et moueat aquam una hora post aliam cum manu sua.	Then he shall take a full cup of cold water and open his mouth to it; and he shall set his mouth to hers and swallow nothing from it; and he shall moisten the water with his hand an hour after another.
Sanguisuga enim ilico cum sentit aquam cadit.	For a leech will fall at once when he feels the water.
Si autem non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc suffumiga infirmum cum cimicibus, aut cum asa cum instrumento quod narraui in suffumigatione uuulae.	But if he does not go out with him as we have described, then he will smoke the sick with lice, or with a tube as an instrument that we described in smoking the uvula.
Fac illud multotiens, quoniam ipsa cadet.	Do this many times, for she will fall herself.
Et modus operationis in suffumigatione est, ut accipias ollam, in qua sint prunae uiuae cum igne: et olla sit cooperta cum coopertorio, in cuius medio sit foramen: et componatur in illo foramine extremitas instrumenti.	And the mode of operation in smoking is that you take a bowl, in which there are the uvulae of the louse with fire; and the bowl is covered with a cover, in whose middle there is an opening; and the end of the instrument is placed in it.
Deinde proiice suffumigationem, et ponat infirmus os suum in extremitate cannulae, et claudat os suum, ut non egrediatur suffumigatio, donec scias quod suffumigatio iam peruenit ad sanguisugam.	Then you will throw the smoke and put the sick person's mouth at the end of the tube, and close his mouth so that he does not go out with the smoke until you know that the smoke has reached the leech.
Nam sanguisuga statim cadet.	For the leech falls immediately.
Quod si non cadit, tunc itera suffumigationem multotiens.	If he does not fall, then repeat the smoking many times.
Et toleret infirmus sitim, et comedat salsa, et allia, et non bibat aquam.	And the sick person will bear hunger, and eat food, and other things, and will not drink water.
Necesse est ergo ut egrediatur cum hoc regimine.	Therefore it is necessary that he go out with this regimen.
Et haec est forma instrumenti cum quo extrahitur sanguisuga ex gutture, quando cadit super ipsam uisus.	And this is the form of the instrument from which the leech is removed from the throat when he falls on it and sticks to it.
Est simile forcipibus, sicut uides: nisi quia est ei haee curuitas quae intromittitur ad guttur.	It is similar to pincers, as you see: unless there is a small hole that enters into the throat.
Et extremitas eius similis ori auis quae nominatur ciconia, in quo est asperitas limae: quando comprehendit aliquid, non dimittit ipsum omnino.	And its end is similar to an ear, which is called a cicogna, in which there is the keenness of the lime; and when it grasps something, it does not let it go at all.
¶ De apertione Apostematum, et eorum sectione, et cura in genere.	Regarding the opening of the apotomates, and their sectioning, and care in general.
Caput XL.	Chapter 40.
Apostematum species sunt multae, multorum modorum, secundum quod uenit rememoratio eorum, scilicet unius, et unius in hoc libro: et sunt diuersae in perforatione eorum, et sectione ipsorum ex duobus modis.	There are many kinds of apotomates, many ways, according to which the memory comes, namely, one, and one in this book: and they differ in the perforation of them, and in the sectioning of them from two kinds.
Quorum unus est ex specie apostematis in seipso, et eo quod comprehendit ex humiditatibus.	There is one which is of the species of aphemia in itself, and because it comprehends from the humors.
Et modus secundus est propter loca, in quibus accidit ex corpore.	And the second way is because of the places, in which it happens from the body.
Quoniam apostema accidens in capite, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in ano: et apostema accidens in loco carnoso, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in iuncturis: et unicuique eorum est iudicium suum ex operatione.	Since the aphemia happens in the head, it is different from the accident of aphemia in the anus; and the aphemia which happens in a fleshy place, it is different from the accident of aphemia in joints; and each of them has its own judgment according to operation.
Et ex apostematibus sunt quae non oportet ut perforentur, nisi post maturationem saniei in eis, et complementum eius: et ex eis sunt, quae oportet ut perforentur, dum sunt cruda, et non maturantur secundum complementum.	And of the aphemias are those which do not need to pierce, except after the maturation of blood in them, and its completion; and of these are those which need to pierce when they are raw, and do not mature according to the completion.
Sicut apostemata quae sunt propinqua iuncturis.	As aphemia which is near joints.
Quoniam apostema quando accidit prope iuncturam, et prolongatur esse eius, donec putrefit quod est in circumitu eius fortasse corrumpuntur ligamenta, aut nerui illius iuncturae: quare est caussa propior contractionis illius membri.	Since the aphemia happens when it is near a joint, and its prolongation exists until what is around it is putrefied, so that the ligaments or nerves of that joint may have腐り始め、それゆえそのメンバーの収縮の原因となる。
Aut est apostema apud membrum principale: quoniam si tu tardas perforationem eius, donec maturetur, nocebit uel illi, uel per illud membro principali.	Or is an aphemia at a main member: for if you delay the piercing of it until it matures, it will hurt either itself or by that main member.
Aut est prope anum, perfora ergo ipsum immaturum: et non oportet, ut perfores, apostema crudum, non completae digestionis, nisi quod est prope anum, ut non putrefiat profundum, et longetur ad interiora ani, et fiat fistula, aut fiat in termino eius quod non sanatur.	Or is near a finger, so pierce it when it is immature: and do not need to pierce an raw aphemia, without completion of digestion, because it is near a finger, lest it should putrefy deep, and its lengthen to the inside of the anus, and become a fistula, or in the term of that which does not heal.
Oportet ut scias horam perforationis apostematis, quod maturatum est secundum complementum: et est apud sedationem doloris, recessionem febris, et diminutionem rubedinis, et pulsationis, et acuitatem capitis apostematis: et reliqua signa.	It is necessary that you know the time of piercing the aphemia, which has matured according to completion: and it is in the sedating of pain, the receding of fever, and the diminution of rubefaction, and pulse, and acuteness of head for an aphemia: and the other signs.
Et oportet, ut facias eandem perforationem in inferiori loco apostematis, et uehementioris eminentiae: et sit perforatio uadens in longitudine corporis, si apostemata sunt in partibus manuum et pedum, et locis lacertorum, et chordarum, et neruorum, et arteriarum, et ad ultimum in omnibus locis aequalibus, quibus non est reflexio.	And it is necessary that you make the same piercing in a lower place of aphemia, and more prominent eminence: and let the piercing be cutting along the length of the body, if aphemia are in parts of hand and foot, and places of fingers, and of chords, and nerves, and arteries, and up to the last in all equal places, which is there no reflection.
In illis autem quae reflectuntur, uade cum perforatione secundum illud membrum.	In those that reflect, guide with a second perforation according to that member.
Quando uero apostema est in locis carnosis: tunc melius est ut dimittas perforationem eius, donec confirmetur eius digestio, sicut diximus secundum complementum.	When however there is a hematoma in the fleshy places: then it is better that you should cease the perforation of it until its digestion is confirmed, as we have said, according to the complement.
Quoniam si tu perforas ipsum ante illud, prolongatur cursus uirus ex eo, et est multae sordis et sordiciei, et fortasse indurantur labia eius, et profunditas eius.	For if you pierce it before that, the course of the virus will be prolonged from it, and it is full of dirt and stench, and perhaps it will harden its lips, and its depth.
Et quaedam apostemata perforantur secundum latitudinem corporis apud necessitatem: aut secundum illud quo indiget membrum.	And certain hematomas are pierced according to the breadth of the body when necessary: or according to that by which the member feels pain.
Et oportet, ut administres in apostematibus paruis perforationem paruam, et in apostematibus magnis perforationem amplam: aut sectiones multas per similitudinem magnitudinis apostematis.	And it is necessary that you administer a small perforation in hematomas that are small and a wide perforation in hematomas that are large: or several sections according to the size of the hematoma.
Et sunt ex apostematibus, in quibus oportet ut concauetur cutis: et incidatur quando iam facta est sicut pannus, et facta est in termino, quod iam mortua est: sicut illud quod accidit in multis, ut dubelet, et bubonibus.	And there are hematomas in which the skin must be closed up: and it happens when it has already been made like a cloth, and has reached its term, because it is already dead: like that which happened to many, such as blisters, and boils.
Et ex eis sunt quae secantur sectione habente tres angulos.	And there are those that cut off with three angles.
Et ex eis est, ex quo inciditur sicut figura folii myrti.	And one of them is like the figure of a fig tree's leaf.
Sicut apostema inguinum.	As the hematoma in the groin.
Et ex eis sunt in quibus administratur sectio rotunda, et sectio lunaris: et similes eis ex sectionibus.	And there are those in which a round section is administered, and a lunar section: and similar ones to these sections.
Illud uero cui non est caput, sicut sunt apostemata lenia superficialia, oportet ut perfores ipsum perforatione superficiali, uel plana tantum.	In fact, as for that which has no head, such are the superficial hematomas, you should pierce it with a superficial perforation, or just flatly.
Et oportet, quando apostema est grossum, et iam collegit saniem multam, et perforas ipsum, ut non properes et extrahas pus totum in illa hora: imo extrahe ex ipso partem eius.	And it is necessary that when the hematoma is large, and has already gathered much blood, and you pierce it, so that it does not come out with everything, but take out a part of it: but draw out from it all at once.
Deinde opila apostema usque ad diem alium.	Then cover the hematoma until the next day.
Deinde extrahe quiddam ex pus iterum.	Then draw out some of the pus again.
Fac illud multotiens secundum gradationem, donec egrediatur: praecipue si infirmus est debilis uirtutis, aut mulier praegnans, aut puer paruus, aur senex decrepitus: spiritus enim animalis ab animali multotiens resoluitur cum egressione saniei: et fortasse moritur infirmus, et tu non percipis.	Make it many times according to a graduation, until it comes out: especially if the person is weak of vigor, or a woman who is pregnant, or a boy who is young, or an old man who is decrepitous: for the spirit of the animal often resolves from the animal with the exit of the blood: and perhaps the sick one will die, and you do not perceive it.
Caue ergo hoc capitulum cautela magna.	Therefore, this chapter is written with great caution.
Et post perforationem tuam, qua ista perforas apostemata, oportet ut abstergas uulnus: et considera.	And after you have made the hole, from which you make the incisions, it should be necessary that you wash off the wound: and consider.
Si ergo est uulnus apostematis paruum, aut est sectio plana, tunc administra licinia ex lino, aut coto antiquo.	But if the wound is small or the cut is flat, then administer wine from linen, or old cheesecloth.
Et si est apostema magnum, et fissurae perforationis multae sunt, oportet tunc ut intromittas in omnem fissuram licinium, donec perueniant adinuicem.	But if the wound is great and there are many cuts of the incision, then you should put licorice into each crease until they have healed together.
Et si in apostemate abscidisti partem cutis, aut in circumitu concauasti eam: tunc oportet ut impleas eam coto ueteri, aut sicut quando texitur pannus, aut raditur lanugine lini absque humiditate: et stringe ipsum usque ad tertium diem.	And if you have cut off a part of the skin in the wound, or if it is circumcised all around: then you should fill it with old cheesecloth, or as when the cloth is wrinkled, or scrubbed with linen thread without moisture: and bind it tightly until the third day.
Deinde proiice ipsum, et cura illud cum eo quod oportet ex unguento, donec sanetur.	Then throw it away, and take care of that with it as you should with ointment, until it is healed.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis in hora tuae operationis, tunc administra aquam frigidam, et acetum, postquam imbibitur in eis pannus: et ponis ipsum super locum fluxus sanguinis multotiens.	But if there is a flow of blood during your operation, then administer cold water and vinegar after it has been soaked up by the cloth: and lay it down repeatedly on the site of the bleeding.
Si autem perseuerat fluxus sanguinis, tunc oportet ut administres regimen, et curationem, et pulueres, quae narraui in locis multis huius nostri libri, et ex diuisione.	But if the flow of blood persists, then you should administer a regimen and treatment, and powders which I have mentioned in many places in this book, and by division.
Si autem est in tempore hyemis, et locus apostematis est multorum neruorum: tunc oportet ut infundas puluillos cum uino, et oleo calidis: et ponas eos super loca.	But if it is in the wintertime and the site of the wound has many nerves: then you should put powders on it with wine and hot oil: and lay them down.
Et si fuerit in aestate, et loca sunt carnosa: tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos imbibitos in aqua, et oleo, aut eum uino et oleo, et totum illud frigidum.	And if it is in the summer and the places are fleshy: then you should put powders soaked in water and oil, or wine and oil, and all of that cold thing.
Donec quando erit dies tertius, sicut diximus, tunc oportet ut soluas apostema, et abstergas ipsum, et administres in curatione eius quod ei conuenit, donec sanetur.	Until the third day, as we have said, then you should remove the wound, wash it off, and administer to it what is suitable for its cure, until it is healed.
Hoc est ergo quod necessarium est ex cognitione curationis apostematum uniuersaliter.	This is therefore what is necessary from the understanding of the treatment of wounds in general.
Secundum semitam uero distinctionis, iam dixi de omni apostemate, qualiter est uia ad curationem eius capitulatim singulariter.	Indeed, according to half the distance between the two extremes, I have already spoken about all that concerns the care of the eyes, which is a way leading specifically to their cure.
¶ De sectione apostematum quae accidunt in cute capitis.	§ On the sections of the scars that occur on the scalp.
Caput XLI.	Head 31.
Accidunt in cute capitis apostemata parua, et sunt ex speciebus Nodorum, quos continent tunicae, quae sunt eis sacci: quasi ipsa sint hausolati gallinae.	On the scalp small scars occur, and they are of two kinds: nodules, which are surrounded by membranes that become sacs: they are almost like the feathers of a hen.
Et ipsorum species sunt multae.	And there are many kinds of these scars.
Ex eis sunt pingues: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditatem similem limo: et ex eis quae continent humiditatem similem frisatis et pultibus: et eis similibus, et ex eis sunt, quae sunt lapidea dura.	Of them some are small; and of them some contain moisture similar to a lime; and of them some contain moisture similar to a dew or a mucus; and some are like stones, and some are hard.
Et in sectione omnium, et ipsorum extractione non est timor, dum apud ipsorum sectionem non facit contrarietatem arteria.	And in the section of all these, nor is there any danger in their extraction, provided that you do not make a contrast with the arteries when you are cutting them out.
Et operatio in sectione eorum est, ut experiaris ea cum instrumento, cuius forma uenit post haec, quod nominatur Intromissum, donec scias quid contineat.	And the operation on these sections is such that you should try it out with a tool whose shape has been formed after this, which is called the Intromissum, until you know what it contains.
Nam si est illud quod continet humiditas, tunc seca ipsum sectione secundum longitudinem sectione superficiali: secundum hanc formam.	For if it is that which contains moisture, then dry it up by a second cut along its length: in this form.
Et incipe cum sectione ex linea b. ad lineam, g. Cum ergo euacuatur humiditas, tunc excoria kistin quae continet illam humiditatem, et non dimittas ex ea aliquid penitus.	And begin with the cut from line B to line G. When therefore the moisture is drained out, then remove the scab that contains this moisture, and do not leave any of it behind.
Multotiens enim redit, si remanet ex ea aliquid.	For many times it will return if some of it remains.
Deinde submerge cotum in unguento aegyptio, si est praesens: et si non, in aqua et sale: et imple cum eo uulnus, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then submerge the wound in Egyptian ointment if it is present, and if not, in water and salt: and fill it with the ointment, and leave it until another day.
Ipsum enim corrodet quod remansit ex kisti.	For this destroys what remains of the scab.
Deinde itera super ipsum cotum cum aegyptio secundo, et tertio, et si indiges illo, donec confidas quia non remanserit ex kisti aliquid, tunc enim cura uulnus cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then repeat the application of the Egyptian ointment on the wound a second and third time, and if your hand can bear it, continue to apply the ointment until you are satisfied that there is no longer any scabs. Indeed, this care with ointment will heal the wound.
Quod si apostema continet nodum pinguem: tunc seca ipsum secundum hanc formam, sectione habente formam crucis: et proiice uncinos inter duolabia sectionis, et excoria ipsum ab omni parte: et conare uirtutem tuam in extractione tunicae quae continet ipsum.	If the abscess contains a swollen nodule: then dry it up according to this form, having the shape of a cross: and throw out the hooks between the folds of the incision, and scrape it off from all parts: and try your skill in removing the tickling skin which contains it.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi arteria, tunc fac illud quod narrabo tibi post.	But if it makes you contrary, then do as I shall tell you after.
Et similiter fac in apostemate, si est lapideum, ex sectione, et curatione eadem, secundum quod diximus.	And also do the same in the abscess, if it is hard, from the incision, and the cure in the same way as we have said.
Et sectio super apostema lapideum est facilior: quoniam est pauci sanguinis et humiditatis.	And the section over a hard abscess is easier: for there is little blood and moisture.
Et quandoque sunt quaedam horum apostematum quae sunt in capite in quibusdam hominibus, cum quibus penitus non est humiditas.	And sometimes some of these abscesses which are in the head in certain men do not have any moisture inside.
Quod est: quia ego secui super apostema in capite mulieris uetulae, et inueni apostema sicut lapis solidus et durus, asper, albus, qui non poterat frangi: et si percuteretur cum eo aliquis proiiciendo, uulnerat ipsum.	Which is this: because I followed over an abscess in the head of a married woman, and found an abscess like a solid and hard stone, rough, white, which could not be broken: and if anyone hit it with a blow, he wounded the flesh.
In aliis uero apostematibus accidentibus in capite, praeter haec scilicet apostemata quae accidunt in capitibus puerorum, et apud radices aurium, sectio eorum omnium sit sectio superficialis.	But in other head abscesses, apart from this, those which happen in the heads of boys, and at the roots of the ears, all of them are only superficial incisions.
Vel pone perforationem eorum semper ab inferiori parte eorum, ut alleuietur cursus saniei ad inferiora.	Or put a perforation in them always from their lower part, so that the course of the poultice goes to the lower parts.
Deinde cura ea cum eo quod conuenit eis ex curatione.	Then care for them with what suits them after the cure is over.
¶ De sectione Strophularum in collo.	On the section of the striae in the neck.
Caput XLII.	Chapter LII. The head.
Multotiens acccidunt ista apostemata in collo, et sub assellis, et inguinibus: et quandoque accidunt in reliquo corpore.	These abscesses often happen in the neck, and under the shoulders, and in the groin: and sometimes they happen all over the body.
Et super illa quae ex eis accidunt in collo, sunt unum, et multa: et generantur ab inuicem: et omnis Strophula ex eis est intra tunicam propriam ei, sicut est in nodis et apostematibus capitis, sicut narrauimus.	And over those which happen from them in the neck, there is one and many: and they are born from one; and every stria comes out of its own tunica, as we have said.
Et species harum Strophularum sunt multae.	And the kinds of these striae are many.
Et ex eis enim sunt lapideae: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates: et ex eis sunt malignae, quae non obediunt curationi.	And from these are the leaves; and from these are those which retain moisture; and from these are the evil ones, which do not submit to healing.
In illa ergo quam ex eis uides bonae dispositionis in tactu, cuius manifestum est propinquum colori cutis, et mouetur ad omnem partem, et non est annexa cum neruis colli, neque cum guidegi, neque cum arteria, neque est profunda: oportet ut seces eam sectione superficiali a superiori parte ad inferiorem partem corporis ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. et excoria eam ab omni parte: et extende duo labia cutis cum uncino, aut cum uncinis multis, si indiges illo, sicut diximus in apostematibus capitis, et extrahe eam paulatim.	For in that which you see good of disposition in touch, whose color is clear and close to the skin, and moves towards all sides, and is not attached to the nerves of the neck, nor to the jugulars, nor to the arteries, nor is it deep: let it be separated from the superficial section from the upper part to the lower part of the line, c. to the line, g., and scrape it off completely: and extend two skin flaps with a hook, or with multiple hooks, if you wish it, as we have said in the scalp bumps, and pull it out slowly.
Et est super cautelam, ut non incidatur uena, aut neruus.	And it is super cautelam, that not incideat venam, or nervum.
Et sit spatumile non acutum ualde: ut non addat tibi manum tuam cum incisione, aut inquietet infirmum, et incidas quod non est necesse.	And let it not be acuter than the knife sharpens: so that it does not give you a hand with the incision, or disturb the sick, and you fall into something that is not necessary.
Si autem incidis uenam, aut arteriam, aut prohibet te ab operatione, tunc pone in uulnus zegi tritum, aut quosdam pulueres qui abscindunt sanguinem, et stringe uulnus, et dimitte ipsum, donec quiescat acuitas apostematis, et mollificetur uulnus: uel incipit et uult putrefieri.	But if you cut a vein, or an artery, or prevents you from the operation, then place in a wooden peg three times broken, or some powder that stops the blood, and tighten the peg, and let it go, until the sharpness of the bump is softened, and the peg is softened: or he begins to rot.
Nam sanguis abscinditur tuncia Redi ergo ad operationem tuam, donec compleas.	For the blood is stopped by the powder: so that you can proceed with your operation, until you are finished.
Deinde inquire digito tuo indice, si remansit aliquid ex Strophulis aliis paruis: ergo incide eas, et munda eas.	Then examine it with your index finger, if there is anything left of the warts with a few others: so cut them and clean them up.
Quod si est in radice Strophulae uena magna: tunc oportet ut non incidas illam Strophulam ex radice sua: imo oportet ut liges eam cum filo duplato forti, et dimittas eam donec cadat per se absque nocumento.	For if there is a large vein in the root of the warts: then let it not be cut from its root; but let it be tied with a strong doubled thread, and let it go until it falls by itself without doing any harm.
Deinde imple uulnus coto ueteri, quod iam submersisti in unguento aegyptio.	Then fill the peg with old tar, which you have already immersed in Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum.	Then the care for himself.
Si inciditur Strophula tota, tunc oportet ut aggreges labia duo uulneris: et suas ipsum statim, postquam uides quia prorsus non remansit superfluitas.	If the incised skin is whole, then you should gather two wounds together: and if you see that there is no excess left, then immediately stop.
Si autem uides quod remansit superfluitas propter magnitudinem Strophulae, tunc oportet ut intendas ad incidendam radicem eius, et extrahendam eam: et administra suturam quam diximus.	But if you see that there is excess because of the size of the Strophe, then you should understand to incise its root and remove it; and administer the suture which we have described.
Et quae ex Strophulis continet humiditates, perfora illam perforatione superficiali: ut appareat tibi locus maturitatis eius: et pone perforationem ab eo quod sequitur inferius corporis, sicut diximus.	And which of the Strophae contains moisture, pierce it with a superficial piercing: so that you can see the place of maturity of it: and place the piercing from there because of what follows below the body, as we have said.
Deinde administra post perforationem licinia cum unguento, et similia eis, ut corrodat quod remansit ex corruptione, donec quando uides uulnus iam mundatum esse: tunc cura ipsum cum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then administer after the piercing with a liniment ointment and similar to it so that it corrupts what remains from corruption, until when you see that the wound has already been cleaned up: then take care of himself with a ointment for the generation of flesh, until he heals.
¶ De sectione Epiglotis ab apostemate intra guttur accidente.	§ On the section of the epiglottis within the throat due to accident.
Caput XLIII.	Chapter XLIII.
Dixerunt antiqui hanc sectionem in Epigloti, et non uidi aliquem in terra nostra, qui eam fecerit: et haec est scriptura sermonis eorum.	The ancient ones said that this section of the epiglottis, and no one in our land has done it, and this is the writing of their words.
In habentibus autem synanchiam, oportet ut deuitetur sectio Epiglotis: cum non fiat iuuamentum per illud: propterea, quod omnes uenae et pulmo sunt infirmi.	But in those who have a synechieuzy, the section of the epiglottis should be removed: since it does not form an impediment by that means: because all the nostrils and lung are weak.
In illis uero qui habent apostema calidum in ore, aut gutture, aut duabus amigdalis, quando non est aegritudo in cannali, oportet uti sectione Epiglotis, ad fugiendum ex perditione quae fit ex praefocatione.	In these, however, who have a warm aphemia in the mouth or in the throat or in both amygdali, when there is no disease in the canal, it is necessary to use the section of the epiglottis, so as to escape from the destruction which happens from pre-condition.
Oportet ergo quando uolumus illud, ut secemus Epiglotim sub tribus circulis Epiglotis, aut quatuor, sectione parua per latitudinem, in eo quod est inter duos circulos per quantitatem, quod sit sectio in sifac, non in cartilagine: et iste quidem locus est conueniens sectioni, quoniam est priuatus carne, et uasa sanguinis ab eo sunt longinqua.	It is necessary, therefore, when we want to cut this, so as to remove the epiglottis with small circles according to their size, which is between two circles according to the quantity, that it be a section in a sifil, not in a cartilage: and this place is fitting for sectioning, because it is apart from flesh, and the blood vessels are far from it.
Quod si medicator est timidus, tunc oportet ut extendat cutem gutturis cum uncino.	If the surgeon is timid, then he should spread the skin with a hook for the gut.
Deinde findat cutem, donec quando peruenit ad cannalem: deuitet uas sanguinis, si uidet ex eis aliquid.	Then he will find the skin, until he reaches the canal: he must stop the blood if he sees anything come out of it.
Deinde secet sifac quod narrauimus: et significatur super sectionem cannalis ex phlegmate quod egreditur ex ea, cum eo quod disrumpitur, et abscisione uocis.	Then he will make a incision in the soft part that we have mentioned: and it is shown on the section of the canal from pus which comes out from it, with what happens when it is interrupted, and with the abruption of the voce.
Et dimitte uulnus apertum tempore aliquo.	And let the wound remain open for a while.
Cum ergo remouetur hora in qua timetur praefocatio, aggrega duo labia uulneris cutis, et sue ipsam solam absque cartilagine.	When therefore the time is right, so that there is no fear of healing, take two lips of the wound skin, and seal it all by itself without the cartilage.
Deinde administra medicinas quae faciunt nasci carnem, usquequo sanetur.	Then administer medicines which make flesh grow, until it heals.
Inquit Albucasis.	Says Albucasis.
Summa huius sermonis quem narrauimus, expositio non est, nisi quando uident, quod aliquod horum apostematum iam opilauit guttur infirmi: et sublimatus est infirmus super mortem, et uult intersecari anhelitus eius: uadunt ad secandum Epiglotim, ut respiret infirmus super locum uulneris quadam respiratione, et saluetur a morte: et propter hoc praeceperunt dimittere uulnus apertum, donec consumatur malicia aegritudinis, et est malicia eius tribus diebus, et quasi ipsa: tunc ergo praecaeperunt suere uulnus, et curare ipsum, donec sanetur.	Says Albucasis. The summary of this account, which we have mentioned, is not exposed unless it is known that the wound has already started to heal, and the sick person has been raised above death, and his anhelous desire has passed: they go to the throat to let the sick breath on a certain spot, and save him from death: for this reason they ordered to leave the wound open, until the malice of sickness is consumed, and it is as though its malice is itself: then they directed that the wound be closed, and care for himself, until he heals.
Et illud quod uidi per me ipsum est, quod una ancilla accaepit cultellum, et misit cum in guttur suum, et incidit cum eo partem cannalis pulmonis.	And this which I saw through myself, is that a servant girl took a knife and put it into her mouth, and cut off with it a part of the lung canal.
Et uocatus sum ad curationem eius, et inueni eam mugire, sicut est mugitus mortui.	And I was called to cure her, and I found her grunting like a dead person.
Detexi ergo a uulnere, et inueni sanguinem qui egressus fuerat ex uulnere paruum.	Then I removed the wound thread, and I found blood which was coming out from a small wound.
Confisus ergo sum, quod ipsa non absciderat uenam, neque guidegi: et uentus egrediebatur ex uulnere.	I therefore confessed that she had not cut off the nail, and I did not know how to do it: and wind came out of the wound.
Properaui ergo, et sui uulnus, et curaui ipsum, donec sanum est: et non accidit ancillae aliquid, nisi raucedo in uoce: et rediit post dies ad meliorem dispositionum suarum.	Therefore, I did not feel pain, and I cared for myself until it healed; and nothing happened to the servant girl except a sore throat, and she recovered after a few days of improved health.
Hinc ergo dico: quod in sectione Epiglotis non est timor.	Therefore, I say that there is no fear when it comes to the epiglottis.
¶ De sectione Herniae gutturis.	Regarding the hernia of the throat.
Caput XLIIII.	Chapter 44: Head
Hoc Apostema nominatum Hernia gutturis, est apostema magnum, secundum colorem corporis: et est in mulieribus multum.	This swelling, called a hernia of the throat, is a large swelling, second only to color, and it occurs often in women.
Et est secundum duos modos: aut enim est naturale: aut est accidentale.	And it has two causes: either natural or accidental.
In naturali certe non est ingenium.	Certainly, there is no fault in nature.
Accidentale uero est secundum duos modos: quorum unus est similis nodis pinguibus.	On the other hand, it is accidental and has two similarities with the lymph nodes.
Et modus alter, est similis apostemati quod fit ex nodatione arteriae.	And the other mode is similar to a swelling that occurs due to the inflammation of an artery.
Et in ipso est timor, et non oportet ut praesumptio fiat ad ipsum cum ferro, nisi in eo quod est paruum: et tu proba ipsum, et inuestiga ipsum cum Intromisso.	And there is a fear there, and it should not be assumed as such without proof, unless it is small: and you should test it and investigate it with an instrument.
Si ergo inuenis ipsum simile nodo pingui, et non est suspensum cum aliqua uenarum: tunc seca ipsum, sicut secantur nodi: et extrahe ipsum cum eo quod continet ex kisti, si est in kisti: et si non, tunc perscrutare totum eius.	If then the swelling is similar to a large lymph node and is not suspended with any veins: then cut it off as you would cut off the nodes: and remove it along with what contains it if it is in a sac: and if not, then examine it thoroughly.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod oportet ex curatione, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the spot, as is necessary for healing, until it heals on its own.
¶ De sectione super species Nodorum.	Regarding the section above the nodules:
Caput XLV.	Chapter 50: Head
Nodorum multae sunt species, et ego iam dixi omnes species eorum in diuisione: et oportet ut narrem hic differentiam inter Nodum, et Exituram: cum sit dubitationem faciens.	There are many kinds of nodules, and I have already spoken about their differences: it is necessary for me to describe the difference between nodules and swollen lymph nodes, as there is some doubt.
Dico ergo, quod cum Exitura est caliditas, et febris, et dolores uehementes, donec sedatur ebullitio superfluitatis, et completur putrefactio: tunc enim quiescunt febris et calor.	I say that when it comes to the exit, there is heat, fever, and painful pain, until an excess of fluid boils over, and putrefaction is completed: then, indeed, the fever and heat subside.
Cum Nodo uero non est caliditas, neque febris, neque dolores, et continet eos kistis sifachin, qui est eis saccus proprius, et est secundum colorem corporis: et est incaeptio eorum sicut cicer, et fit sicut batecha, et maior et minor.	When it comes to a nodule, there is no heat, fever, or pain, and they are contained in sacs, which are their own sacs, and are of the color of the body: and they begin as beans, and resemble a basket, and are larger and smaller.
Et sunt secundum duas species: aut pingues: aut continent humiditatem.	And they are of two kinds: either dry or wet.
Et colores humiditatis sunt multi, secundum quod dixi in diuisione.	And the colors of moisture are many, as I said in the division.
Oportet ergo, quando peruenis ad curationem Nodi, ut experiaris eum, et inquiras ipsum in primis cum instrumento quod nominatur Intromissum, secundum quod ueniet forma eius in capitulo quod est post hoc.	Therefore, when you come to cure a node, you should test it and inquire about it first with the instrument called Intromissum, according to its form in the chapter which is after this one.
Et modus inquisitionis apostematum, et Nodorum omnium est, ut accipias hoc instrumentum, et intromittas ipsum in humidiorem locum, quem inuenis in apostemate: et tu reuolue digitos tuos cum eo paulatim, donec scias quod instrumentum iam penetrauit cutem.	And the method of examining pustules and all nods is, that you take this instrument and introduce it into a moistened place which you have opened in the pustule: and you shake your fingers with it slowly, until you know that the instrument has penetrated the skin.
Deinde ultima manum tuam secundum mensuram magnitudinis apostematis.	Then you take the last hand of yours according to the size of the pustule.
Deinde extrahe Intromissum, et considera illud quod egrediur in uestigio eius.	Then remove Intromissum and examine what comes out of his opening.
Si ergo egreditur humiditas currens, quicunque color sit: tunc seca ipsum sectione superficiali, secundum quod dixi in reliquis apostematibus.	If then there comes out a running moisture, whatever its color is: then dry the skin with a section, as I said of all pustules.
Et si non egreditur humiditas in uestigio Intromissi, tunc scias quia est pinguis: seca ergo super ipsum sectione habente formam crucis, secundum formam hanc, sicut docui te: et suspende ipsum cum uncinis, et excoria cutem ab omni parte cum facilitate: et custodi kistin si potes super illud, ut extrahas ipsam sanam cum Nodo.	If then there does not come out moisture in the opening of Intromissum, you should know that it is fat: so dry on the skin with a section having the shape of a cross, according to this form, as I have taught you: and suspend it with hooks, and scrape the skin from all parts easily: and guard the cupping glass if you can over it, that you may drain out the healthy fluid with the Node.
Si autem disrumpitur kistis apud operationem, et non est possibile extrahere ipsam sanam, multotiens enim accidit illud, tunc extrahe ipsam frustatim, donec non remaneat ex ea aliquid.	If then the cupping glass breaks during the operation and it is not possible to drain out the healthy fluid, since this happens many times: then remove it quickly until nothing remains of it.
Nam si remanet ex ea aliquid parum, aut multum, redit Nodus secundum plurimum.	For if there remains of it a little bit or much, the Node returns after many things.
Quod si uincit te, et remanet ex eo parum: tunc imple uulnus apud completionem tuam, quibusdam pulueribus corrosiuis acutis: et stringe uulnus, et pone supra ipsum quod sedet apostema calidum, et cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	That if it wins you and remains of it a little bit: then fill the wound at your completion with some powdered corrosives acute: and tighten the bandage, and put it above the skin which sits the pustule warm, and take care of the skin with the rest of the cure, until it heals.
Si ergo est Nodus magnus, tunc sue duo labia eius, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat.	If then there is a large knot, then cut his two lips and care for it with him as it has become inflamed.
Si autem est tibi contraria uena pulsatilis, aut non pulsatilis: tunc propera, et imple locum zegi trito, et dimitte ipsum strictum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec putrefiat uulnus, et quiescat ebullitio sanguinis: deinde redi ad incidendum illud quod remansit ex Nodo.	If however you have a new wound that pulses, or not pulsating: then approach, and fill the space under the skin with dried earth, and let it rest for two days, or three, until the tendon rots, and the bleeding stops: then go back to cutting out what is left of the knot.
¶ De foris instrumentorum pro sectione et perforatione.	§ On the tools for cutting and drilling.
Caput XLVI.	Chapter XLVIII. On tools for cutting and drilling.
EX Eis sunt formae Intromissorum, et sunt trium specierum.	From these are the forms of intromission, and they are of three kinds.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et ex eis est medium, et ex eis est paruum.	For from these is a large one, and from these is a medium one, and from these is a small one.
Fiant ex ferro alfulud quadratarum extremitatum decenter, ut festinent introitum in apostemate.	Let there be made out of iron a quadrangular piece with depressed ends, that it may prevent the entrance of the incised part.
Et istae sunt formae Experientium, et no, id est, perforantia: et unum eorum nominatur beris, idest, peforans: et sunt trium specierum.	And these are the forms of percussion, and there is one, that is, the perforating: and they are of three kinds. One is called a mallet, that is, a perforator; and these are of three kinds.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et medium, et paruum.	For from these is a large one, and a medium one, and a small one.
Conueniunt, ut inuestigentur per ea apostemata, et exiturae, et fistulae, et bubones ab eo quod inter ea est ex ossibus.	Let there be made out of wood the appendages, and the outlets, and the tubes, and the buboes from him who is between them from the bones.
Et aliis fiunt rotunda, tersa, lenia, sicut acus magnae quibus subsellia suuntur, ex citrino scilicet, aut ex aere, aut ferro, aut argento.	And others are round, and three-sided, and smooth, like the large needle with which the seats are supported, made of amber, or of brass, or of iron, or of silver.
Et meliora eorum sunt quae fiunt ex citrino.	And better ones are those made of amber.
Et fiunt Experientia etiam de plumbo nigro, quae conueniunt ut per ea experiantur fistulae, quarum concauitate sunt reflexiones, ut reflectantur cum lenitate sua cum illis reflexionibus.	And there are also percussion instruments of black lead, which are to be used that they may experience the outlets, whose reflections are to be managed, so as to reflect with their softness with those reflections.
Et sunt iterum trium specierum.	And again they are of three kinds.
Quoniam ex eis sunt longa, ex eis media, et ex eis breuia, secundum quantitatem amplitudinis fistulae et stricturae eius.	For from these are long, and from these is medium, and from these is short, according to the quantity of the width of the tube and the strictness of its tightness.
Forma Vncinorum, et sunt multarum specierum.	Form A of Vinculum, and there are many species.
Quoniam ex eis sunt simplices, scilicet quibus est curuitas una: et sunt trium specierum sicut uides, Magni, Medii, et Parui.	Because they are simple ones, that is, those with one curvature: and there are three species as you see, Great, Medium, and Small.
Et ex eis sunt Vncini caeci: et sunt trium specierum.	And from them are Blind Vincula: and there are three species.
Et ex eis sunt uncini habentes duas curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et ex eis sunt uncini habentes tres curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et omnes isti sunt necessarii in loco suo.	And from them are Vincula with two curvatures, and there are three species: and from them are Vincula with three curvatures, and there are three species: and all of these are necessary in their place.
Et istae sunt formae Scalpellorum, quibus secantur et excoriantur Nodi, et apostemata: et sunt trium specierum: quoniam ex eis est magnum, medium, et paruum.	And these are the forms of Scalpels, with which they cut and ablate Knots and Abscesses: and there are three species: because from them is Great, Medium, and Small.
Eorum extremitates quibus fit sectio sunt acutae, extremitates aliae sunt non acutae: et non ponuntur taliter, nisi ut cum eis fiat iuuamentum in excoriatione Nodorum apud timorem incisionis uenae, aut nerui: et ut sanetur per ea infirmus, et inueniat tranquillitatem parumper ex adustione quam inuenit apud excoriationem apostematis.	Their extremities with which the section is acute, other extremities are not acute: and they do not put them together, unless it is made with them a incision in order to cure an injury of the skin or nerve: and in order that the sick person should heal by it, and find a little bit of calmness from the burning than he finds when excoriating Abscesses.
Istae sunt Magda, et sunt specierum trium.	These are Magni, and there are three species.
Fiunt ex aere, et sunt similia Radio, cum quo fit alcohol: et in extremitate lata est puncta Spatumilis occultata: et in ea currit ad interiora, et ad exteriora quando uis, sicut uides.	They are made of brass, and they are similar to the radius, with which it is made alcohol: and in the long edge there is a small dot called "Spatulimilis" hidden: and in it it runs inside and outside when you use it, as you see.
Forma Spatumilium quae absconduntur inter digitos apud perforationem apostematum: et non percipiunt ea infirmi: et sunt trium specierum, magnum, medium, et paruum.	Form of the Spatula which are hidden between fingers at the perforation of Abscesses: and they do not perceive them when they are injured: and there are three species, Great, Medium, and Small.
Fomae Ventosarum cum quibus abscinditur fluxus sanguinis: et sunt trium specierum, magnae, mediae, et paruae.	Form of the Windless which with which is cut off the flow of blood: and there are three species, Great, Medium, and Small.
Fiant ex aere, aut citrino, rotundae, ad longitudinem parumper, sicut uides: et sint ad subtilitatem.	Let them be made of brass, or yellow, round, about the same length as you see: and let them be delicate.
Et oportet ut sint istae species Ventosarum apud te magnae, et paruae: ut abscindas per eas sanguinem cum uelocitate apud necessitatem, et tunc quando non est tibi praesens medicina.	And let these species of Wind be with you Great and Small: in order that you might cut off blood with them at a high speed when necessary, and then when there is no medicine present for you.
Verumtamen non utaris eis in abscisione sanguinis in omni loco corporis, et non utaris nisi in locis carnosis: sicut lacertis cruris, et coxae, et lacertis brachiorum, et mammillarum, et uentris, et inguinum, et similibus eis, ex lacertis carnosis, humidis.	Indeed, you should not use them in the abscission of blood from anywhere on the body, and you should only use them in muscular places: such as the legs, hips, arms, breasts, wrists, groin, and similar places made of muscular tissue, which are moist.
Et quandoque fiunt ex eis instrumenta parua alia similia corticibus fisticorum, secundum suam formam: quibus abscinditur sanguis quando fluit ex loco phlebotomiae, aut apud incisionem uenae, aut arteriae: et quandoque fiunt ex eis rotundae secundum hanc formam.	And when they become from them small instruments like the palm of the hand, according to their form: with which blood is cut off when it flows out from the site of phlebotomy, or at the incision of a vein, or an artery; and sometimes they become round according to this form.
¶ De cura Mammillarum hominum quae mammillis mulierum assimilantur.	On the care of the breasts of men which are like the breasts of women.
Caput XLVII.	Chapter LVII. On the care of the genitals.
Quandoque inflantur Mammillae quorundam hominum apud complementum somni (id est, cum incipiunt pollui in somno) donec similantur mammillis mulierum: et remanent apostemosae foede.	When the breasts of some men swell at night (that is, when they begin to be irritated in sleep) until they resemble the breasts of women: and remain swollen with milk.
Qui ergo abhorret illud, oportet ut secet super mammillas sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Deinde excoria pinguedinem totam.	Whoever wishes to avoid this (that is, milk coming out) should bind the breasts with a lunar band, according to this form, from A to B and G. Then scrape the whole area of the skin.
Postea imple uulnus ex medicamine incarnatiuo.	Afterwards fill a wound with an ointment made from incarnated flesh.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then gather together the two lips of the wound with a suture, and take care of it, until it heals.
Si autem declinat mammilla ad inferiora, et mollificatur propter magnitudinem suam, sicut accidit mulieribus: tunc oportet ut findatur in duobus lateribus suis superioribus duabus sectionibus similibus figurae lunari, quarum unaquaeque continetur cum altera apud fines utriusque, donec sit linea maior continens minorem, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Postea excoria cutem quae est inter duo labia, et aufer pinguedinem, et administra quod diximus de sutura et pulueribus, quod est necessarium ex curatione, donec sanetur.	But if the breast sways towards the lower parts, and becomes soft through its size, as happens to women: then it is necessary that two sections according to the lunar form be found on either side of it, each one joined with the other by a line such as A joins B and G; and then the skin which is between the two lips should be scraped off, and the milk removed, and what we have said about the suture and powders, which are necessary in curing, should be applied, until it heals.
Si autem non comples incisionem eius quod oportet te incidere, propter inquietudinem infirmi, aut propter fluxum sanguinis: tunc oportet ut impleas uulnus coto submerso unguento corrosiuo, et dimitte ipsum, donec corrodat illud quod remansit ex pinguedine.	But if you do not wish to cut into it, because of the sickness or the flow of blood: then fill it with a corrupted oil-based ointment, and leave it, until what is left of the milk is corroded by it.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then the care for himself, until he is well.
¶ De perforatione apostematis, quod accidit sub Titillico.	As for the perforation of the abscess, which happened during the Titans.
Caput XLVIII.	Head LXXVIII.
Ista apostemata quae accidunt sub Titillico, sunt ex speciebus Strophularum dura, quae continet kistis, et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates.	This abscess that happens during the Titans, is of the kind of hard Strophula, which contains a blister, and from it are those that contain moisture.
Quae ergo sunt ex eis quae continent humiditates, oportet ut secentur sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam, ex linea b. ad lineam, g. cum ergo euacuatur totum quod est in apostemate ex sanie, tunc imple ipsum coto ueteri, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Since, therefore, those are of the kind that contain moisture, it should be cut with a lunar section, according to this form, from line b to line g; and then, when all that is in the abscess has been drained out, then fill it with old dung, and let it go until another day.
Deinde auferatur cotum, et curetur cum unguento conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then the dung is to be removed, and he is to be cared for with an ointment suitable for it, until he is well.
Quod si apostema fuerit ex specie nodorum Strophularum, tunc scinde super ipsum, sicut diximus in sectione super Strophulas aequaliter.	If the abscess is of the kind of nodular Strophula, then cut on top of it, as we have said in the section on Strophula equally.
Si autem extenditur uulnus in hoc ut emittat pus, tunc administra in eo cauterium, secundum quod diximus in eo quod praemissum est.	But if a nerve is extended in this way so that it emits pus, then administer cauterization on it, according to what we said above in that which was premised.
¶ De sectione apostematis quod accidit propter Arteriam et Venam.	As for the section of an abscess that happens because of the artery and vein.
Caput XLIX.	Head LXXIX.
Quando disrumpitur Arteria, et consolidatur cutis quae est supra eam, tuno multotiens accidit inde apostema: et similiter accidit Venae etiam, ut accidat in ea apostema et inflatio.	When the artery is broken and the skin that is above it has become hardened, then very often there happens an abscess from it; and also because of the veins, so that it happens to them as it does to the artery, namely, that there happens an abscess and swelling.
Et signa quibus cognoscitur, quod apostema et inflatio sint propter Arteriam et Venam, sunt: quoniam, quando apostema est propter arteriam, est longum, aggregatum in profundo corporis: et quando impellis apostema digits tuis, sentis quasi sit ei stridor.	And the signs by which it is known that an abscess and swelling are because of the artery and vein, are these: for, when an abscess is because of the artery, it is long, gathered in the depths of the body; and when the swelling of the abscess makes its way to your fingers, you feel as if there were a whistle in them.
Et illud quod est propter Venam, est rotundum in manifesto corporis.	And that which is because of the vein, is round in manifest form of the body.
Et sectio super hoc apostema est error, et praecipue quod est sub ascellis, et inguinibus, et collo, et in locis multis corporis: et est magnum ualde.	And the section on this abscess is a mistake, and especially because it is under the armpits, and in the groin, and in the neck, and in many other places of the body; and it is great and very painful.
Oportet ergo ut deuitetur eius cura cum ferro, et quod ex eis etiam est in extremitatibus, aut in capite, oportet ut deuitetur.	Therefore, so that his care may be with iron, and since it is also in the extremities or in the head, let it be used.
Super illud ergo quod ex eis est ex inflatione orificii Arteriae, finde in cute sectione in longitudine.	Therefore, so that his care may be with iron, and since it is also in the extremities or in the head, let it be used. Super this therefore that is out of the inflammation of the opening of the artery, find in the skin section in length.
Deinde aperi sectionem cum uncinis, postea Arteriam: et libera eam ex tunicis, donec detegatur.	Then open the section with a hook, then the artery: and free it from the tunics, until it is detected.
Deinde intromitte sub ea acum, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, et stringe Arteriam cum filo duplo in duobus locis, secundum quod docui te in extractione duarum Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then introduce under it the hook, and let it penetrate all the way to another side, and tighten the artery with a double thread at two places, according to what I taught you in the extraction of two arteries which are in the temporal region.
Deinde punge locum, qui est inter duo ligamenta cum spatumili, donec egrediatur sanguis qui est in eo totus, et soluatur apostema.	Then pierce the place that is between the two ligaments with a needle, until all the blood inside it comes out, and dissolve the aphthoma.
Deinde administra curationem quae generat pus, donec cadant ligamenta: postea cura illud cum unguentis conuenientibus ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then administer the cure that generates pus, until the ligaments fall: then care for it with unguents suitable for it, until it heals.
Quod si fuerit apostema propter sectionem Venae, tunc oportet ut teneas manu tua quod tibi possibile est ex apostemate cum cute.	That if there is an aphthoma due to the section of a vein, then you must hold your hand so that you can get rid of the aphthoma with the skin for you as much as possible.
Deinde intromitte acum sub loco quem tenuisti manu tua, et fac eam penetrare: et sit in ea filum duplum, donec extrahas ipsum ex latere altero.	Then introduce the hook under the place that you held with your hand, and let it penetrate: and let it go into it a double thread, until you get it out of the other side.
Deinde liga cum ipso apostema ligamento bono: secundum quod dixi tibi in ligamento uuae, a duabus partibus cum duabus extremitatibus fili.	Then bind the aphthoma with that good ligament: according to what I told you in the binding of a vein, from two parts with its two extremities with a thread.
Si autem times quod extrahatur filum, tunc intromitte acum aliam cum filo alio sub apostemate toto apud incisionem acus: preme, et stringe fila tua in quatuor locis.	If however you are going to extract a thread, then introduce another hook with another thread under the aphthoma all along the incision of the blade: press, and tighten your threads in four places.
Deinde seca apostema in medio sui, donec quando egreditur quod in eo est: tunc incide superfluitatem cutis, et dimitte quod ligatum est ex ea.	Then dry up the aphthoma from its middle until it comes out what is inside it: then make an incision on the skin, and let go of what is bound to it.
Deinde pone super ipsum puluillum quem submersisti in uino, et oleo.	Then put on top of that a very fine powder that you immersed in wine, and oil.
Deinde administra curationem, quae fit cum liciniis et unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then administer the cure, which is done with liniments and ointments, until it heals.
¶ De apostemate quod accidit ex torsione Neruorum.	The next chapter deals with what happens when the nerves are twisted.
Caput L.	Ch. 52
Sicut accidit apostema in Arteria et Vena, similiter accidit apostema in Neruis: quod accidit in eis percussio, aut accidit a labore superfluo, et similibus: et fit plurimum illis in locis adiutoriorum, aut calcanei, et in omni loco in quo mouentur iuncturae: et est apostema graue.	As happens with the apostema in an artery or vein, so it happens with nerves; that is, if there is a piercing, or if it comes from excessive work, and similar things: and it often happens to them in the places of the joints, or of the heel, and in any place where the tendons move: and it is a gray apostema.
Similatur color eius reliquo corpori, et est in pluribus dispositionibus absque dolore: et quando stringitur cum uehementia, sentit in eo infirmus simile stupori.	Its color is similar to the rest of the body, and it is in many dispositions without pain: and when it is pressed with swelling, it feels like a kind of stupor within it.
Et non est apostema aggregatum in profundo corporis, imo est sub cute, et ipsum mouetur ad omnem partem, et non uadit ad anteriora, uel ante, neque retro ad posteriora.	And it is not an accumulated apostema in the depth of the body, but under the skin, and it moves all over, and does not complain about anything to the front, or ahead, or behind.
Quod ergo ex eis est in iuncturis, non oportet ut inuadatur cum ferro.	Therefore what is in the joints should not be touched with a iron.
Fortasse enim accidet contractio.	Perhaps, however, it happens because of contraction.
In illo autem quod ex eis est in capite, aut in fronte, finde cutem cum spatumili.	But in that which is in the head, or in the forehead, find a skin with swelling.
Si ergo est apostema paruum, tunc tene ipsum cum forficibus, et abscinde ipsum a radice.	If it is then a small apostema, then hold it with forceps and cut it off at the root.
Et si est magnum, tunc suspende ipsum eum uncino, et excoria ipsum: deinde aufer ipsum, et aggrega uulnus cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if it is a big one, then hang it on an hook, and scrape it off: then remove it, and gather the wound with a stitch: and take care of it, until it heals.
¶ De sectione apostematis, quod accidit in uentre.	Ch. 54 De sectione apostematis, quod accidit in ventriculo
Caput LI.	The head of the chapter on the cutting of apostemas,
Accidunt quibusdam hominibus multotiens in uentribus eorum, et in reliquis corporibus ipsorum, thelil, quae nominantur Fungalia, per similitudinem ipsorum cum fungis.	Such things often happen to certain men, and to the rest of their bodies, those growths which are called "fungia", on account of their resemblance to fungi.
Quorum radix est subtilis, et ipsorum caput est grossum, et conuersa sunt labia eorum.	Their roots are small, and their heads are large, and their lips are spread wide.
Et est ex eis paruum: et est ex eis quod magnificatur ualde.	And they are few in number; and there is one which increases greatly in size.
Et ego quidem iam uidi uirum, et in uentre eius erant duo thelil, quae erant magis quam rebus aliis similia fungis: non erat differentia inter ea, alba, minutae radicis, et inuersabantur labia eorum, et findebantur, et humiditas currebat ex eis semper.	And I did indeed see a man, and in his belly were two worms, which were more than other similar fungi: there was no difference between them, they were white, and their roots were small; and their lips were spread out, and they had a lot of moisture always running from them.
Incidi ergo ea, et inueni in pondere unius quasi X et VIII uncia et in altero quasi VI uncia Et operatio in incisione eorum est, ut consideres tunc, si infirmus est humidus, et color thelil est albus, humidum, subtilis radicis: tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili lato, et sint in praesentia tua cauteria in igne.	So I did indeed see a man, and in his belly were two worms, which were more than other similar fungi: there was no difference between them, they were white, and their roots were small; and their lips were spread out, and they always had a lot of moisture running from them. So I cut off these, and I found in the weight of one almost ten and eight ounces, and in the other almost six ounces; And the operation in cutting them is, that you should consider then, if he is weak, moist, and the color of the worms is white, moist, subtile roots: then cut him with a wide chisel, and let cauterization be in your presence on fire.
Multotiens enim expellitur apud sectionem eius sanguis multus: propera ergo si te uincit sanguis, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	Indeed, many times the blood is discharged from him a lot when he is cut: so close if you are defeated by blood, then cauterize him.
Quod si uides infirmum pauidum et timidum ab incisione cum ferro, tunc accipe filum ex plumbo decenter factum, et stringe cum eo athelul: cuius modus est quem diximus, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	That if you see him weak, timid, and afraid of the cut with iron, then take a wire from lead that is curved: and pull it with him athelum: whose mode I have said, and let go of him for two days.
Deinde adde in strictura plumbi.	Then add to the tightness of the lead.
Non ergo cesses stringere plumbum, quotiens imprimit in thelil, donec abscindatur, et cadat per se absque labore.	So do not cease to tighten the lead, when it presses on the worms, until it is cut off, and falls by itself without work.
Si autem thelil grossae fuerit radicis, tunc in incisione eius est quiddam timoris et pauoris: praecipue quod est in uentre.	If, however, the worms are big roots, then there is some fear and fear in cutting them: especially because they are in the belly.
Verumtamen possibile est, ut incidas medietatem eius.	But it is possible to cut half of it.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum, ut non redeat.	Then cauterize him, so that he does not return.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then care for the man until he heals.
Et caue ne praesumas incidere thelil quod est fusci coloris, pauci sensus, foedi aspectus: ipsum enim est apostema cancerosum: et ego ueniam cum rememoratione Cancri post hoc.	And do not suppose that you can cut the worms which are of a dark color, few senses, and an appetizing appearance: for he is indeed an apostema cancerous: and I will come back with the memory of Cancer after this.
¶ De cura eminentiae Vmbilici.	On the care of the umbilicus.
Caput LII.	Chapter LII. On the care of the umbilical cord.
Fit eminentia Vmbilici ex caussis multis.	To deal with various causes of umbilical care.
Aut ex fissuris sifac, quod super uentrem est: et exit ex eo althub, aut intestinum, secundum quod accidit in reliquis rupturis.	It may emerge from a fistula that opens on the belly below: or it may emerge from the rectum, according to whether it occurs in the remaining ruptures.
Aut ex sanguine qui fluit ex Vena, aut ex Arteria, secundum quod praemissum est.	Or from blood that flows from a vein, or from an artery, as stated above.
Aut ex uentositate coartata in eo.	Or from a constricted pleat of skin.
Si autem est propter fissuram sifac, et exitum thirbi: tunc est color apostematis similis colori corporis: et est lene, absque dolore: et apparet diuersi situs.	If, however, it emerges from a fistula that is clean and the discharge is thick: then it resembles the color of fresh blood: it is soft, without pain: and it appears in various places.
Et si est propter egressionem intestini, tunc est situs eius, cum eo quod narrauimus, uehementioris diuersitatis.	And if it is due to the exit of the intestine, then its location is with that which we have mentioned, more varied in character.
Cum ergo tu premis ipsum digitis tuis, occultatur: deinde redit, et fortasse est cum eo sonitus: et magnificatur multum apud introitum balnei, et laborem uehaementum.	When you press upon it with your fingers, it is hidden: then it returns, and perhaps has a sound: and it is very prominent at the entrance of the anus, and causes a rumbling noise.
Si uero est propter humiditatem, est lene, tunc non occultatur quando premis ipsum manu tua, neque constringium, neque additur.	If, however, it is due to moisture, it is soft, and does not hide itself when pressed by your hand, nor becomes tight, nor does it add to itself.
Quod si est propter sanguinem, tunc cum istis signis apparet apostema ad nigredinem de cliue.	If it is due to blood, then with these signs appears a bruise of a dark color at the tip.
Si autem est propter carnem natam: tunc est apostema graue, grossum, durum, et figitur secundum quantitatem unam.	If, however, it is due to raw flesh: then it is a bruise of a gray, thick, hard color, and discolors according to the quantity of one unit.
Si uero est propter uentositatem, tunc tactus eius est lenis.	If, however, it is due to a flow of air, then the sensation of touching it is soft.
Et operatio in illo est, ut consideres tunc, si eminentia umbilici est propter sanguinem Arteriae, aut Venae, aut uentositatem: tunc oportet ut prohibearis a curatione eius.	And the operation in that case is, as you should consider, if the umbilical eminence is due to blood of an artery or vein or a flow of air: then one should refrain from treating it.
Nam in illo est timor et pauor, sicut docui te in capitulo, in quo dixi apostemata propter arteriam et uenam.	For in that is fear and dread, as I taught you in the chapter in which I said that bruises are due to an artery and a flow of air.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est propter intestinum, aut zirbum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, quatenus teneat anhelitum suum, et stet stans extensus.	If the umbilical eminence is due to an intestine or a hernia, then you should prescribe for the sick person to hold his breath and remain standing with his body extended.
Deinde signa cum encaustro in circumitu umbilici totius.	Then mark with encaustum around the navel altogether.
Postea praecipe ei, ut resupinetur inter manus tuas super dorsum suum.	Then order him to lie down on his back between your hands.
Deinde circunda cum spatumili lato in circumitu umbilici super locum quem signasti cum encaustro.	Then, with a mallet, beat around the navel from side to side in the place that you marked out with encaustic.
Postea extende medium apostematis ad superiora, cum uncino magno.	Then extend the mid-line of incision upward, with a large hook.
Deinde liga eum in circumitu forti cum filo, aut cum chorda de serico ligamento firmo: et sit nodus ligamenti alenxotati.	Then tie him around strongly with thread or silk knot: and let the knot be tied to an unharmed part of his body.
Deinde aperi medium apostematis extensum supra ligamentum.	Then open the mid-line incision that you have extended, above the lymphatic duct.
Si ergo inueneris ipsum iam captum a ligamento: tunc extrahe alenxotati, et intromitte in ipsum digitum indicem, et impelle intestinum ad interiora uentris: et si inueneris zirbum, tunc accipe ipsum cum uncino, et incide superfluitatem eius.	If you have already found the patient's hernia through the lymphatic duct: then pull out the ligature and insert your index finger into him, pushing the intestine towards his insides: and if you find a hernia: then grasp it with the hook, and cut off its surplus.
Si autem contraria est tibi arteria, aut uena: tunc circunda ipsum multum.	If, however, the opposite side is an artery, or a vein: then mark him all around.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam.	Then return to your operation.
Et accipe duas acus, et intromitte in eis duo fila fortia: et intromitte duas acus in circumitu quem fecisti circa apostema in modum crucis, quas facis penetrare.	And take two needles and insert two strong threads into them: and insert the two needles around what you have marked out around the hernia in the shape of a cross, which you make to penetrate.
Deinde stringe apostema in quatuor locis super acus: et si uis, aufer acus, et dimitte locum, donec putrefiat caro extensa: et cadat per se: aut incide ipsam quando subtiliatur et putrefit.	Then tighten the hernia in four places on the needles: and if you wish, remove the needle, and leave the place, until the flesh has become rotting: and let it fall down of itself: or cut it off when it becomes slimy and rotten.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for the patient with unguents as needed, until he is healed.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est ex carne nara in eo, aut ex humiditate: tunc oportet ut concaues apostema, sicut diximus.	If the navel's eminence is made of flesh that has become hard in it, or of moisture: then you must tighten the hernia, as we have said.
Et extrahas sanguinem, aut humiditatem, quam inuenis in eo.	And extract the blood or moisture that you have injected into him.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod solidat locum.	Then care for the patient with unguents so that the place hardens up.
¶ De cura CANCRI.	Of the canکر.
Caput LIII.	Chapter LIII.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Cancri, et qualiter est uia ad curationem eius cum medicinis: et cauendum ab eo cum curatione eius cum ferro, ut non ulceretur: et diximus Cancrum generatum in matrice, et cautelam a curatione eius.	We have already spoken about the division of cancer, and how it is treated with medicines; and how to guard against its spreading by curettage with an iron implement, so that it does not ulcerate: and we spoke about cancer arising in the womb, and about the precautions needed for its treatment.
Et dixerunt antiqui, quod quandoque Cancer est in loco, ubi possibilis est eius eradicatio: sicut Cancer qui est in mammillis, aut in coxa, et eis similibus, ex membris locatis ad extrahendum totum eius: praecipue quando est incipiens paruus.	And the ancients said that when ever cancer is in a place where it can be eradicated: such as cancer that is in the breast, or in the thigh, and similar places, from the member located to extract all of it: especially when it is just beginning.
Quando uero antiquatur, et est magnus, non oportet ut appropinques ei.	When however it is old, and is great, it should not be approached.
Ego enim non potui sanare ex eo aliquem: neque uidi alium ante me qui peruenerit ad illud.	For I cannot heal from him anyone: nor did I see any other who has come to that.
Et operatio in eo, quando est locatus sicut diximus, est, ut praecedas, et soluas infirmum ex cholera nigra aliquotiens.	And the operation in it, when it is located like we have said, is, as the saying goes, so that you go ahead and you release the fever from black cholera sometimes.
Deinde phlebotoma ipsum si inuenis cum repletione manifesta.	Then phlebotomy itself if it is bloated with evident fullness.
Deinde praepara infirmum praeparatione, in qua locetur cum operatione.	Then prepare the sick with preparation, in which he is located with the operation.
Deinde proiice in Cancrum uncinos qui conueniunt ei.	Then throw on cancer the hooks that are suitable for him.
Postea concaua ipsum ab omni parte cum cute, secundum perscrutationem, donec non remaneat aliquid ex radicibus eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere, et non abscindas ipsum uelociter, imo exprime loca, et absterge sanguinem grossum totum manu tua, aut cum quo possibile est ibi ex instrumentis.	Then wrap up the cancer with all the skin, according to the tracing, until there remains nothing of its roots: and let the blood not run, nor do you tear it quickly, except that you express the places, and wipe away the gross blood entirely by your hand, or with whatever is possible there.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi fluxus sanguinis grossi ex incisione arteriae, aut uenae: tunc cauteriza uenam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	But if it makes you contrary that the gross blood flows out from the incision of an artery or a vein: then cauterize the vein until the blood is cut off.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the cancer with the remaining cure, until it heals.
¶ De cura Hydropisis.	§ On the treatment of hydrops.
Caput LIIII.	Head LIIII.
Iam narrauimus in diuisione species Hydropisis, et qualiter fit aggregatio aquae: et signa omnis speciei, et curationem eius cum medicinis.	We have already covered in the division of the species of Hydrops, and how water is aggregated: and the signs of each species, and the cure of it with medicines.
Et illa quae curatur cum ferro, non est nisi species asclitis sola: et non approximatur cum ferro speciei timpanitis: neque speciei hyposarcae penitus: nam illud mortale est.	And those who are cured with iron, it is not except a single species of asclepius: and it does not approach iron of tympanic species: nor does the species of hyposarcoma go deep: for that is deadly.
Quando tu iam medicatus es hanc speciem Hydropisis timpanitis cum medicinis, et non contulit medicatio tua: tunc considera.	When you are already treated with this species of Hydrops tympanic with medicines, and your treatment has not been successful: then consider.
Nam si infirmo iam consecuta est debilitas, aut est cum eo infirmitas alia praeter Hydropisim: sicut si sit cum eo tussis, aut uentris solutio, et similia illis: tunc caue ne mediceris ei cum ferro: quoniam est timor illud.	If the sick person has already been afflicted with one kind of illness and then another, different from hydropisis: as when he has cough, or diacrisis of the urinary tract, and such like: then be careful not to treat him with iron: for there is a fear of that.
Si autem uides infirmum exuberantis uirtutis, neque est cum eo aegritudo praeter Hydropisim solam: et non est puer, neque senex: tunc modus operationis in eo est, ut tu eleues infirmum stantem inter manus tuas, et minister post ipsum exprimat uentrem eius manu sua impellendo aquam ad inferiorem partem pectinis.	But if you see a healthy person with an excess of strength and there is no illness other than hydropisis: nor is he a boy or an old man: then the method of operation in him is, that you should stand him between your hands, and let him express his wind from his hand driving water to the lower part of the rib cage.
Deinde accipe spatumile spinosum, secundum hanc formam.	Then take a spikelet with thorns, shaped like this.
Sit duarum partium acutarum, longum, acutae extremitatis sicut Spatumile.	Set two sharp parts, one long and the other sharp at its end like a spikelet.
Verumtamen in eo sit quiddam breuitatis paulatim, ut non pertranseas cum eo apud operationem usque ad intestinum, et laedas ipsum.	But in him there is something that gradually becomes shorter, so that you do not break it while operating near the intestine, and you do not hurt him.
Deinde considera.	Then consider.
Nam si est generatio Hydropisis ex parte intestinorum, tunc oportet ut elongeris cum sectione ab umbilico quantitate trium digitorum, ad inferiora in directo eius supra pectinem.	For if there is generation of hydropisis from the part of the intestines, then it should be extended with a cut from the navel by three fingers' width, going directly below it on the rib cage.
Si uero generatio Hydropisis est propter aegritudinem epatis: tunc sit sectio tua sinistra ab umbilico tribus digitis.	But if there is generation of hydropisis due to liver illness: then your cut from the navel should be by three fingers' width on the left side.
Et si generatio eius est propter splenem, tunc sit sectio in latere dextro: et non oportet etiam ut sit sectio in latere super quod uult iacere infirmus, ut non currant superfluitates ad illum locum debilem.	And if that generation is due to the spleen: then your cut on the right side should be. And it should not also be that you cut on the side opposite to where the sick person lies, so that no fluids run to that weak place.
Deinde perfora cum instrumento cutem totam.	Then pierce the skin with an instrument all around.
Deinde intromitte in illam sectionem, et eleua manum tuam cum Spatumili inter cutem, et sifac, quasi tu excories ipsum: et sit quantitas quae excoriatur quantitas unguis, aut circiter ilud.	Then introduce it into the cut, and press with your hand with the spikelet between the skin, and squirt, as if you were washing him out: and let the amount that is washed be the amount of a nail, or around that.
Deinde perfora sifac, donec perueniat Spatumile ad locum uacuum: et est locus aquae.	Then pierce the squirt, until the spikelet reaches the empty place: and there is water.
Deinde extrahe ipsum, et intromitte in foramen instrumentum, cuius haec est forma.	Then extract the same, and introduce into the hole an instrument whose this is the form.
Et est simile cannulae: fit ex argento, aut aere, aut aurichalco, lene, tersum: cui in inferiori parte sui est foramen paruum, et in lateribus eius sunt tria foramina, duo ab una parte, et unum a parte altera: et facia est extremitas eius incisa, secundum modum incisionis calami, sicut uides: in extremitate eius superiore est armilla.	And it is similar to a tube: it is made of silver, or brass, or copper, or leather, or felt; and has on its lower part a small hole, and on its sides three holes, two on one side, and one from the other: and its end is incised according to the form of a penknife, as you see: at its upper end there is an armlet.
Nam quando instrumentum peruenit ad aquam, tunc ipsa descendit statim super instrumentum, ergo euacua ex aqua in hora quantitatem mediam.	For when the instrument has reached the water, then immediately it descends over the instrument, and then it evaporates from the water at the same rate as the quantity of medium.
Quoniam si tu euacuas ex ea plus quam oportet, in hora fortasse moritur infirmus per resolutionem spiritus sui animalis: aut accidit ei syncopis quae appropinquat morti.	For if you evaporate from it more than is necessary, in an hour perhaps a sick person dies by the resolution of his animal spirit: or that happens to him which approaches death with fainting.
Verum euacua ex ea secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius, et secundum quod significant tibi dispositiones infirmi ex uirtute pulsus eius, et ex bonitate eius.	But evaporate from it according to the quantity of its virtue, and according to what you indicate to you with respect to the dispositions of the nurse by its pulsation, and by its goodness.
Deinde extrahe instrumentum, et retine aquam.	Then extract the instrument, and retain the water.
Quod est, quia retinetur statim propter cutem quae retinet foramen quod est super sifac: de quo narraui, ut perfores ipsum secundum illum modum.	That is, because it retains immediately by reason of the skin which retains the hole that is over the sifac: of which I tell you, so that you make it according to that method.
Deinde itera instrumentum die altero, si uides infirmum tolerare illud: et extrahe etiam ex aqua quantitatem paruam.	Then repeat the instrument on the other day, if you see that the sick one tolerates that thing: and extract also from the water a quantity of dust.
Fac illud diebus aliquot sine timore, et custodi te ab errore: donec non remaneat ex aqua nisi parum.	Make it those days without fear, and guard yourself from error: until there does not remain in the water except a little dust.
Si autem times super infirmum, et dimittis ex aqua rem multam: tunc cura ipsum cum sepultura in harena calida, et sudore multo in balneo et sole, et expectet super sitim: et cura ipsum cum medicinis exiccatiuis, donec sanetur: et cauteriza super stomachum, et epar, et splenem, post extractionem aquae: secundum quod narraui in eo quod praecessit.	But if you are with the sick one, and you dismiss from the water a great deal: then take care of him with the grave on hot sand, and with great sweat in the bath and in the sun, and let him wait on hunger: and cauterize over the stomach, and the liver, and the spleen, after extraction of the water: according to what I tell you beforehand.
¶ De cura infantium qui nascuntur locis urinae eorum non perforatis.	Of the care of infants who are born in places of their urinary system not pierced.
Caput LV.	Chapter 50.
Quando egreditur aliquis infantium ex uentre matris suae, et caput mutonis eius est non perforatum, aut est foramen strictum, aut in non suo loco.	When any of the infants come out from his mother's womb, and the head of the child is not pierced, or there is a hole made narrow, or it is not in its own place.
Oportet ergo succurrere cum perforatione eius statim cum nascitur cum Spatumili subtili ualde, secundum hanc formam.	Therefore, one should help with the piercing of him immediately when he is born, with a thin hook, according to this form.
Deinde pone in foramine clauum subtilem ex plumbo, et liga ipsum: et tene ipsum tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then put a small plug in the hole from lead, and bind him together: and hold him for three days, or four.
Quando ergo uult urinam emittere, remoueatur, et mingat.	When therefore he wants to urinate, let it be moved, and let it go away.
Deinde reduc ipsum.	Then reduce the child again.
Et si tu non ponis plumbum, iam possibile est, ut urina quae incedit super locum, non permittat ipsum claudi.	And if you do not put lead on, then it is possible that the urine which has flowed over the place, does not cause the child to be closed.
Ille autem cuius foramen est strictum, medicatur cum plumbo, sicut diximus, diebus multis, donec amplificetur.	But he who has a small hole, is healed with lead, as we have said, for many days, until it becomes larger.
Illi autem in quibus est foramen in non suo loco, laeduntur.	But those in whom the hole is not in its own place, are wounded.
Quod est, quia ex eis qui nascitur, foramen est apud finem capitis uirgae: quare non potest mingere ad anteriora, donec eleuat uirgam manu sua ad superiora.	That is to say, since from those who are born, the hole is at the end of the penis' head: so that he cannot urinate in front, until he raises his penis by hand towards the sky.
Neque est ei generatio, propterea, quod sperma non potest peruenire ad matricem secundum rectitudinem: et est aegritudo foeda ualde.	And there is no generation in him, therefore, because the semen cannot reach the mother according to its uprightness: and it is a severe illness.
Et modus operationis in illo est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum.	And the method of action in that is, so that he lies on his back.
Deinde extende caput uirgae eius manu tua sinistra extensione uehementi, et incide caput capitis uirgae ex loco priapi, cum acumine, aut spatumili acuto: sicut est incisio calami, aut sicut tu radis aliquid, ut medium eius ueniat simile capiti uirgae: et ut cadat foramen in medio secundum quod oportet.	Then extend the child's penis with your left hand by a strong extension, and cut the head of the penis from the proper place, with an edge, or with a sharp hook: as if you were cutting a staff, or like when you want to chop something, so that it resembles the head of the penis: and let the hole fall in the middle according to what is necessary.
Et caue tibi apud operationem tuam a fluxu sanguinis.	And cause for yourself, during your work, from the flow of blood.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	For this often happens.
Oppone ergo ei cum eo quod abscindit sanguinem, et cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Then stop the blood by him, and heal the wound, until it is healed.
¶ De Albather quae accidunt in praeputio et capite uigae, et corruptione, nigredine, et adhaerentia.	Of the wounds that occur on the prepuce and the scalp of the scrotum, and corruption, blackening, and adhesion.
Caput LVI.	De Albather quae accidunt in praeputio et
Multotiens accidunt istae Albather in uirga, et est eminentia carnis foedae.	(Sometimes these wounds occur on the scrotum, and there is a distension of foul flesh.)
Et ex ea alia est maligna, et alia non maligna.	(And from it another is malicious, and another is not malicious.)
Non malignam ergo oportet ut suspendas cum uncino subtili, et abscindas eam, donec mundes eam totam.	(So the non-malicious one should be suspended with a subtle hook, and cut it off entirely until you wash it completely.)
Deinde pone super eam cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio.	(Then put on top of it a cloth dipped in Egyptian ointment.)
Deinde cura ipsum post illud cum unguento dyafinicon, donec sanetur.	(Then take care for the wound with dye-finicon after that with ointment until it heals.)
Quod si Albather est maligna, foedi coloris, tunc oportet ut administres in ea cauterium post incisionem eius et ipsius rasionem.	(If the albather is malicious and of a foul color, then you should administer cauterization on it after cutting it and shaving it.)
Si autem Albather est in praeputio captiui, non circumcisi, et est pars Albather inter praeputium, et pars eius extra: tunc oportet ut auferas Albather, quae est intus in primis, donec quando consolidatur, tunc cura ipsum exterius: quoniam quando tu curas eam simul, non securatur praeputium quin preforetur.	(If, however, the albather is caught in the foreskin and not circumcised, and a part of the albather is within the foreskin, and a part outside: then you should remove the albather which is within first, until it is consolidated, then take care of the one outside: for when you do take care of it at the same time, the foreskin will not be secure unless it is pierced.)
Et iam accidunt etiam in testiculis, et praeputio nigredo et corruptio.	(And there also happen wounds on the testicles and blackening and corruption on the foreskin.)
Oportet ergo, ut tu concaues totum quod iam denigratum est, et quod uult corrumpi, aut iam corruptum est.	(Then you should bring to a head all that which has already been blackened, and what wishes to corrupt, or what is already corrupted.)Aliquid enim ex illa albather non fuit nisi malus et malignus: itaque quod in praeputio, in uirga, et in testiculis accidere, om
Deinde line super ipsum post illud cum melle quod iam concussum est cum farina corticum granatorum, et herbi tritorum cribellatorum.	(For some of that albather was not good and malicious: so that which happened on the foreskin, on the scrotum, and on the testicles, then take care with a line on top of it after that which has already been crushed with honey that has already been crushed with flour from granulated grains, and with herb
Deinde cura illud cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	(Then take care for it with the remaining cure, until it heals.)
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra cauterium cum cauterio lunari, secundum hanc formam.	(If, however, blood flow occurs, then administer cauterization with lunar cautery, in this form.)
Cauterium enim est iuuatiuum ad duas dispositiones simul, scilicet ad fluxum sanguinis, et uulnus quando corrumpitur.	The cautery is used for two purposes at one time, namely to stop the flow of blood and to destroy a wound when it has become corrupted.
Quod si corroditur caput uirgae, et destruitur totum in hora: tunc oportet ut intromittas in meatum priapi cannulam ex plumbo, ut mingat infirmus super eam.	If the head of the wound has腐敗，and is destroyed entirely in an hour: then you should insert a copper tube into the meatus priapium，so that the sick can urinate on it.
In adhaerentia uero praeputii cum capite uirgae, et haec quidem adhaerentia non accidit, nisi in eo cuius praeputium est sanum, et non exigitur super ipsum circumcisio: et quandoque accidit adhaerentia propter uulnus, aut apostema: oportet ergo ut excories eam cum Spatumili obtuso, donec soluatur ligamentum, et liberetur caput uirgae ab omni parte.	However，if the foreskin adheres to the head of the penis，and this adhesion does not occur except in that whose foreskin is healthy，and circumcision is not required on it: and when an adhesion occurs due to a wound or a hematoma：then you should cut it out with a blunt scalpel，until the ligaments are released，and the head of the penis is freed from all sides.
Quod si est difficile discernere ea exquisite, tunc oportet ut excories aliquid ex capite uirgae, et ex praeputio.	If it is difficult to distinguish them carefully，then you should cut off some from the head of the penis，and from the foreskin.
Quod est, quia praeputium quando est subtile, fortasse perforatur propter subtilitatem suam uelociter.	That is，because when the foreskin is thin，it may be pierced quickly because of its thinness.
Deinde separa inter praeputium, et caput uirgae cum panno lini subtili, qui iam madefactus est in aqua frigida, ut non adhereant iterum.	Then separate the foreskin from the head of the penis with a soft piece of linen，which has already been soaked in cold water，so that it does not adhere again.
Deinde curetur cum uino stiptico, donec consolidetur.	Then treat with wine containing stichic acid，until it hardens.
¶ De mundificatione infantium, et curatione ex errore eis accidente.	§ On the purification of infants and treatment from error by accident.
Caput LVII.	Chapter LVII.
Circumcisio non est solutio continuitatis, sicut reliqua uulnera: uerumtamen cum sit ex operatione nostra, uoluntate nostra, et usus eius sit in pueris proprie, est necesse ut signemus in ea operationem meliorem, et uiam leuiorem perducentem ad salutem.	Circumcision is not a solution to continence，like other wounds: however，it is our desire and its use in boys is proper，we must indicate in it a better operation，and introduce a lighter one leading to health.
Dico ergo, quod antiqui non dixerunt circumcisionem in aliquo suorum librorum: quoniam non utuntur in legibus suis, et non est nisi quod acquisiuimus per experimentum.	I say，the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books: for they do not follow their own laws，and it is only what we have learned through experience.
Quod est, quia ego inueni maiorem partem artificum, et phlebotomatorum uti mundificatione, circumcidendo cum nouacula, et cum forficibus: et utuntur alfecati, et ligaudo cum filo, et incisione cum ungula.	That is，because I discovered most of the arts，and the use of leeches and bloodletting for purification，circumcision with sharp tools，and sewing with thread，and cutting with nails.
Et ego quidem iam probaui omnes istos modos, et non inueni meliorem mundificatione cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo.	I have indeed already tested all these methods, and I did not find any better method of cleansing with tweezers and thread.
Quoniam in mundificatione cum nouacula, multotiens effugit cutis.	For when очищing with needles, the skin often falls off.
Quoniam cutis praeputii duas habet tunicas: ergo forsitan inciditur cutis superior, et temanet tunica inferior: cogitur ergo ad incisionem ad incidendum alteram, et dolorem futurum.	Since the foreskin has two tunics, perhaps one may be cut on the outside, and the other inside, and it is necessary to consider cutting that one, since it will hurt if it is left alone.
Et cum mundificatione quae fit per alfecati, id est, digitalis, quo utuntur sutores, non securatur incisio extremitatis uirilis membri: quoniam fortasse ingreditur in foramen eius.	And when the cleansing done by the finger is used, that is, a surgical instrument, it does not secure the incision at the end of the genital member, since perhaps it enters into its opening.
In mundificatione autem cum ungula, fortasse euadit ferrum, et corrumpit operationem tuam: et cutis quidem pueri est breuis natura, et multotiens nascuntur taliter, quod non indigent mundificatione: et iam uidi illud.	But in cleansing with a nail, perhaps the iron will break and ruin your work, and since the skin of a boy is short by nature, it often grows like this, so it does not need to be cleansed, and I have seen it too.
Mundificationis autem cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo, bonum experimentum detexit mihi: quoniam forfices sunt proportionalis incisionis: propterea, quod acuitas quae est superius, est sicut acuitas quae est inferius.	But cleansing with tweezers and thread has shown me a good experiment: since the tweezers are of the same proportion as the incision, since the sharpness that is on top is the same as the sharpness that is on bottom.
Cum ergo premis manum tuam, proportionantur duae acuitates, et incidunt secundum operationem unam in tempore uno: et fit compressio simili figura, continens cutem uirgae ab omni parte, cum qua non cadit error omnino.	But when you put your hand in your hand, two sharpnesses are proportioned and work together at the same time, and it becomes a compression of a similar figure, holding the skin of the penis all around, so that there is no mistake at all.
Et modus operationis propriae est, ut facias extimare, puerum praecipue, si est ex eis qui intelligunt parumper, quod tu non facis, nisi quod ligas filum in uirga sua tantum: et dimittas ipsum usque ad diem alium.	And the operation has its own way, so that you can guess at it, especially if it is from those who understand a little bit, which you do not do, unless you tie the thread only in his penis: and you leave him until another day.
Deinde fac eum gaudere et laetari omnimodo quo possibile est tibi illud, ex eo quod recipit intelligentia sua.	Then let him be happy and rejoice in everything that is possible for you to do for him, since he receives his intelligence.
Deinde fac eum stare inter manus tuas praeparatae staturae, et non sit sedens: et occulta forfices in manica tua, aut sub pede tuo, ne uideat eos puer omnino, neque aliquid ex instrumentis.	Then let him stand between your hands that are prepared to set him down, and do not let him sit, and hide the tweezers in your sleeve, or under your foot, so that he does not see them at all, nor any of the instruments.
Deinde intromitte manum tuam ad uirgam eius, et suffla in cutem, et trahe eam sursum, donec egrediatur caput uirgae.	Then insert your hand into his scrotum and blow on the flesh and pull it upwards until the head of the penis comes out.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex eo quod aggregatur in ea sordicie.	Then wash yourself from that which aggregates in her.
Deinde liga locum signatum cum filo duplo.	Then bind the marked place with double thread.
Postea liga inferius eo parumper ligamentum secundum.	Then bind below it with a ligament of about the same thickness as the second one.
Deinde tene cum indice tuo, et pollice locum ligamenti inferioris retentione bona, et incide inter duo ligamenta.	Then hold with your index finger and thumb the lower ligament securely, and cut between the two ligaments.
Deinde eleua cutem sursum uelociter, et extrahe caput uirgae.	Then wipe the flesh quickly upwards, and pull out the head of the penis.
Deinde dimitte sanguinem currere paulatim (est enim melius) et pone puluerem desuper: et super puluerem pannum in quo expansus est uitellus oui decocti in aqua rosata, concussum cum oleo ros recenti bono: et dimitte eum super ipsum usque ad diem alium: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then let the blood run slowly (for it is better) and put on dust from above: and on the dust a cloth spread out in which is spread out the cured one in rose water, shaken with fresh oil: and leave it on top until another day: and care for the rest of the body with cure, until it heals.
Forma autem forficis ad mundificationem haec est.	The shape of the forceps for cleaning is this.
Sint hebetes duae extremitates, et sint incidentes: ne egrediatur in eis ramus claui: et sit longitudo duarum acuitatum, sicut longitudo duorum manubriorum aequaliter.	The two ends should be joined together, and should not stick out: and the length of the two hooks should be equal to the length of the two hands when they are spread out.
Error uero cadens in mundificatione est: quoniam fortasse effugit cutis intrinseca tota, aut pars eius apud incisionem.	But a mistake in cleaning is: for perhaps it will skip all the skin inside, or a part of it near the incision.
Ergo oportet, ut extendas eam ex hora tua cum ungue tuo ante apostemationem loci: et incidas eam secundum aequalitatem.	So you must stretch it out from your hour with your own nail before the examination of the site: and cut it by equal parts.
Quod si non potes tenere eam cum ungue tuo, tunc extrahe eam cum uncino, et incide eam.	If you cannot hold it with your own nail, then remove it with a forceps, and cut it.
Si autem praeterierint ei tres dies, et remanet quod est sub uirga inflatum, apostematum: tunc dimitte illud, donec sedetur apostema calidum, et excoria illud cum facilitate, et incide illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi: et caue tibi a capite uirgae.	But if it has passed over three days and what is under the scrotum remains swollen with a fever, then leave it until it cools down, and clean off the sore with ease, and cut it according to your preparation: and care for the head of the penis.
Non enim nocebit ei illud.	For that will not harm him.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod consolidat uulnus ex pulueribus, quos narrauimus in tractatu de pulueribus: et si inciditur ex cute supra mensuram, et euadit ad superiora, non nocet ei illud etiam.	So then care for that with the powder which we discussed in the book on powders: and if it is cut from the skin above the mark, and projects upwards, it does not harm him either.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod diximus, donec sanetur.	Therefore, we shall proceed with this treatment until the patient is healed.
¶ De extractione Vrinae retentae in uesica.	The extraction of a retained foreign body from the urethra.
Caput LVIII.	Head L VIII.
Urinae retentio in uesica, fit ab opilatione facta ex lapide, aut sanguine congelato, aut pus, aut carne nata, et similibus illis ex eis quae diximus ex modis curationis in diuisione.	Retention of urine in the bladder, occurs from an operation performed by the lodgement of a stone, or congealed blood, pus, or born meat, and similar things, as we have said in the various methods of cure.
Et si non soluitur Vrina, et uides retentionem eius esse propter Lapidem, qui iam est in collo uesicae: tunc oportet ut sit infirmus super genua sua curuatus.	And if the urine is not resolved by [the above methods], and if there is a retention of urine because of a stone which has already reached the neck of the bladder, then the patient should be bedridden.
Deinde componantur pedes eius super dorsum eius, et extendat uentrem suum ex superiori parte dorsi eius, et stringat infirmus anhelitum suum quantum possibile est ei.	Then he shall place his feet on his back, and he shall stretch his stomach from the upper part of his back, and he shall restrain his breath as much as possible.
Cogitur ergo cum collo uesicae ad expulsionem Lapidis ad posteriora: quare absoluitur Vrina.	So it is calculated with the neck of the bladder to expel the stone towards the rear: for thus the urine is released.
Quod si non soluitur cum eo quod diximus, et uehemens sit res super infirmum: tunc oportet ut administres extractionem eius cum instrumento, quod nominatur siringa, cuius haec est forma Sit ex argento, et sit subtile, lene, concauum sicut cannula pennae auis in subtilitate radii, longum in similitudine palmi unius et medii: cui sit cannula subtilis in capite eius.	If it is not resolved with the above-mentioned treatment and the patient is painful to him, then you should administer the extraction with an instrument called a syringe, which has this form. It is made of silver, and it is fine, smooth, and sharp like the stem of a feather in its thinness, long in the resemblance of the palm of a hand, and in the middle: having a thin cannula at the end.
Et modus exitus Vrinae per ipsum est, ut accipias filum duplicatum, et liges in extremitate eius lanam, aut cotum, ligatura bona: et intromittas extremitatem fili in inferiori parte Siringae: et incide cum forficibus si superfluit aliquid ex lana, uerum intromitte in cannulam cum uehementia, sicut alzer.	And the mode of exit of urine through it is, that you take a double thread, and tie it firmly at the end with wool or cotton, good knot: and introduce the end of the thread into the lower part of the syringe: and cut it with scissors if there is anything excessive in the wool, truly, you introduce it into the cannula with care.
Deinde inunge siringam cum oleo, aut cum butyro, et albugine oui: et fac sedere infirmum super sedem, et embroca uesicam, et ipsius uirgam cum oleis humidis, et oleo oliuae, et aqua tepida.	Then he shall dip the syringe in oil, or in butter, and in alum: and make him sit on a seat, and he should put his bladder into it, and with wet oils, olive oil, and warm water.
Deinde intromitte siringam in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat ad radicem uirgae.	Then he shall introduce the syringe into his penis with ease, until it reaches the root of the penis.
Deinde dupla ipsam superius a parte umbilici.	Then cut twice above the navel.
Deinde impelle siringam intra ipsam, donec perueniat ad Vesicam, et sentiat eam infirmus iam peruenisse ad rem uacuam: et non fit hoc secundum hunc ordinem, nisi quoniam meatus, in quo uadit, est in quo est tortuositas.	Then push the syringe inside of it until it reaches the bladder, and feel that it is already weak as it approaches the empty thing: and do not do this according to this order unless the canal, in which he puts, is bent.
Deinde extende filum cum lana paulatim.	Then extend the thread with wool little by little.
Vrina enim sequetur lanam.	For the thread follows the wool.
Deinde extrahe eam, et fac currere Vrinam per uiam urinae: et itera siringam, et non cesses facere illud, donec euacuetur uesica, et inueniat infirmus alleuiationem.	Then pull it out, and let the thread run along the urinary passage: and again push the syringe, and do not cease to do this until the bladder is empty, and feel a relief.
¶ De qualitate clisterizationis uesicae cum Clepshydra.	As for the quality of bladder washing with a clepsydra.
Caput LIX.	Chapter LIX.
Quando accidit in uesica ulcus, aut sanguis in ea congelatur, aut coartatur in ea pus, et uis distillare in eam aquas et medicinas: tunc fiat cum instrumento quod nominatur Clepshydra, et haec est forma eius.	When a wound occurs in the bladder, or blood freezes in it, or pus is clotted in it, and water and medicines are distilled into it: then make use of an instrument called a clepsydra, and this is its shape.
Est enim surda, id est, clausa.	For it is closed, that is to say, shut.
Et in eo sunt tria foramina, duo ex parte una, et unum ex parte altera, sicut uides.	And in it are three openings, two on one side and one on the other, as you see.
Et locus concauus, in quo est illud quod impellit, sit secundum quantitatem quod opilet ipsum sine additione, donec quando trahitur cum eo aliquid, ex humiditatibus attrahatur: et quando impellitur, cum eo expellatur ad longinquum: secundum quod facit clepshydra, qua proiicitur naphta, id est, ignis graecus in praeliis martis.	And the cavity in which the thing that pushes is located is according to the quantity that it obtains without addition, until when it is drawn with it something is attracted from the moisture: and when it is pushed, and is expelled far away: second in that a clepsydra drops naphtha, that is, Greek fire in battles of war.
Cum ergo uis proiicere humiditates in uesicam, intromitte extremitatem clepshydrae in humiditatem, et trahe cum eo quod impellit ad superiora, humiditas enim trahitur in concauitatem clepshydrae.	When you are dropping water into the bladder, introduce the end of the clepsydra into the water, and draw it out with what pushes upward, for the water is drawn into the cavity of the clepsydra.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem eius in uirgam, secundum quod narrauimus in siringa.	Then introduce the end of it into the penis, according to which we have described the syringe.
Deinde impelle humiditatem cum eo quod impellit illa namque humiditas peruenit ad uesicam statim, ita quod sentit eam infirmus.	Then push the water with what pushes, for that water immediately reaches the bladder, so that he feels it weak.
Forma clisteris subtilis quo clisterizatur uesica.	Form a thin cloth with which to wrap the urethra.
Fiat ex argento, aut auricalco: cuius caput altius sit simile alcama paruo, et sub eo sinus inter quem cadat ligamentum.	Make it of silver, or bronze; its head should be higher than the corresponding one and a little lower at the back, and there should be a space between it and the ligament below.
Deinde accipe uesicam arietis, et pone in ea humiditatem, qua uis clisterizare uesicam.	Then take the goat's urine and put it in it to help you urinate.
Deinde liga eam inter duos sinus ligatura forti cum filo duplo: et calefac illam humiditatem parumper super ignem.	Then tie it tightly between two holes with a strong double knot: and heat it slightly with hot water over the fire.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem clisteris in uirgam, postea stringe manum tuam super uesicam cum humiditate strictura decenti, donec sentiat infirmus, quod illa humiditas iam peruenit ad uesicam.	Then insert the tip of the cloth into the penis, and then grasp it tightly with your hand over the urethra with the water pressure, until the patient feels that the water has already reached the urethra.
Si autem non est tibi praesens uesica, tunc accipe frustum pergameni, et fac ex eo circulum, et perfora ipsum ab omni rotunditate sua.	If you don' have goat's urine at hand, then take a piece of parchment and make it into a ring, and pierce it from all sides with its roundness.
Deinde intromitte filum forte in illis foraminibus, sicut reuoluuntur.	Then insert a strong thread in those holes, as if they were spinning.
Deinde aggrega circulum, sicut aggregatur alsofratu: postquam tu ponis in eo illud quod uis ex humiditatibus, et oleis, et aquis.	Then gather the ring together, as you would a loaf of bread: once it is gathered, place in it what water, oils, and waters you want to use.
Deinde liga ipsum in instrumento: et fac cum eo sicut fecisti cum uesica ex expressione cum manu tua, donec perueniat humiditas ad uesicam.	Then tie the ring on the instrument: and do so with your hand as you did with the goat' urine to make it come to the urethra.
¶ De extractione Lapidis.	The extraction of a stone.
Caput LX.	Chapter LX.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Lapidis, et curationem eius cum medicinis: et dixi differentiam inter Lapidem generatum in renibus, et uesica, et signa illius totius: et dixi Lapidem in quo cadit operatio cum manu et sectio: et est Lapis generatus in uesica proprie: et ille qui figitur in uirga: et ego sum narrans illud cum expositione manifesta et abbreuiatione.	We have already spoken at length in the division of the species of stone and their treatment with medicines; and we have distinguished between stones that are generated in the kidneys, and those in the urethra, and their various signs: we have described the stone that is formed by hand and its section: this is a stone that is generated in the urethra: and one that is formed in the stalk: and I am telling you these things with clear explanation and abbreviation.
Dico ergo, quod Lapis generatus in uesica, plurimum accidit pueris.	I say, then, that a stone that is generated in the urethra, often happens to boys.
Et ex signis eius est, quod urina egreditur ex uesica similis aquae in subtilitate sua: et apparet in ea harena alba, et fricat infirmus uirgam suam, et laborat cum ea, et multotiens pendet.	And of its signs is that urine flows from the urethra like water in its thinness: and it appears in it white sand, and grinds the man's penis, and struggles with it, and hangs often.
Deinde erigitur, et egreditur cum eo anus in multis eorum.	Then he erects it and turns it with him; the anus is moved with many of them.
Et est facilis sanatio puerorum, ex eo usquequo consequuntur quatuordecim annos.	And this healing of young men is easy, from him until they reach the age of fourteen years.
Et est difficilis in senibus.	And it is difficult with old men.
In iuuenibus autem est media, in eo quod est inter illud: et eius cuius Lapis est maior, curatio facilior: et si paruus, est econuerso illius cura.	But in the young it is half-way between that and this: and the healing is easier if the stone is larger; but if small, it is turned away from its place.
Cum ergo peruenimus ad curationem, oportet in primis, ut mundificemus infirmum cum clisteri, quod extrahat totum stercus quod est in intestinis suis: ipsum enim quandoque prohibet inuentionem Lapidis apud inquisitionem.	So let us come to the healing, first of all it is necessary that we should clean up the sick with a clister, which draws out all the dung that is in his intestines: for he sometimes prevents the discovery of the stone in the examination.
Deinde accipiatur infirmus cum pedibus suis, et concutiatur, et moueatur ad inferiora: ut descendat Lapis ad profundum uesicae, aut saliat de loco alto aliquotiens.	Then let the sick person be taken with his feet and shaken and moved towards the lower parts, so that the stone may descend to the depths of the rectum or sometimes come out from its high place.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas praeparatum, et manus eius sint sub coxis ipsius, ut fiat uesica tota decliuis ad inferiora.	Then let him sit between your hands prepared, and his hands below his buttocks, so that the whole rectum may drop down towards the lower parts.
Deinde perquire eum, et tange eum extrinsecus.	Then examine him, and touch him from outside.
Si ergo sentis Lapidem in spacio, tunc propera statim cum sectione super ipsum.	If then you feel the stone in space, immediately approach it with a cut above him.
Quod si non cadat sub tactu tuo omnino, tunc oportet ut abstergas digitum indicem cum oleo manus sinistrae, si infirmus est puer: aut digitum medium si est iuuenis completus: et intromittas ipsum in anum suum, et perquire de Lapide, donec stat sub digito tuo: et conuerte eum paulatim ad collum uesicae.	If it does not fall under your touch at all, then you must wipe the index finger with oil from your left hand if the sick person is a boy; or with the middle finger if he is a full grown man: and push him into some part of his rectum, and examine the stone until it is under your finger: and turn him gradually towards the neck of the bladder.
Deinde preme super ipsum cum digito tuo, et impelle ipsum ad exteriora aduersus locus, cuius sectionem uis: et praecipe ministro, ut premat uesicam manu sua, et praecipe alii ministro, ut extendat testiculos manu sua dextra ad superiora: et alia manu sua, ut remoueat cutem, quae est sub testiculis in parte a loco in quo est sectio.	Then press on him with your finger and push him towards the outside against the place where you want to make the cut: and order one minister to squeeze the rectum with his hand, and another minister to extend the testicles with his right hand from above: and with his other hand, to move the skin, which is under the testicles in that part where the cut is to be made.
Deinde intromitte Spatumile incidens, cuius forma haec est.	Then introduce the spatulum, which has this shape.
Et finde in eo quod est inter anum et testiculos, et non in medio, ad latus natis sinistrae: et sit sectio super ipsum lapidem, et digitus tuus sit in ano: et fiat sectio transuersa, ut sit sectio exterius ampla, et interius stricta, secundum quantitatem quod sit possibile egressio Lapidis ex ea non maior.	And find in it what is between the anus and the testicles, and not in the middle, at the side of the birth to the left: and let the cut go across it, so that the cut is wide outside and tight inside, according to the quantity that it is possible for the stone to come out from there and not larger.
Fortasse enim comprimit digitus, qui est in ano Lapidem apud sectionem, et egreditur absque difficultate.	Perhaps then the finger, which is in the anus at the time of the cut, and goes out without difficulty: for the stone is pressed by the finger in the anus, and comes out without any difficulty.
Et scias, quod ex Lapide est cui sunt anguli et margines, quare fit difficilis exitus eius propter illud.	And you know that from the stone are angles and edges, therefore it is difficult for it to come out: because of this.
Et ex eo est lenis, similis glandulae, et rotundus: et fit facilis egressus eius.	And from it is smooth, similar to a gland, and round: and its exit is easy.
Ei ergo cui sunt anguli, et margines, adde in fissura.	So then add to it those which have angles and edges, in the crevice.
Quod si non egreditur ita, tunc oportet ut ingenies super ipsum: aut stringas super eum cum gesti decenter, cuius extremitas sit sicut Luna, quae stringat super Lapidem, et non euadat ab ea: aut ut intromittas sub eo instrumentum subtile, curuatae extremitatis.	If it does not come out in this way, then you must put on your hands on it: or you tie it with a strong rope, the end of which is as the moon, tying it over the stone and not pulling away from it: or you introduce below it a thin instrument, curved at its ends.
Si autem non potes super cum, tunc amplifica foramen parumper.	But if you cannot reach above with it, then make the hole slightly larger.
Quod si uincit te aliquid ex sanguine, abscinde ipsum cum zegi.	If something from the blood causes you pain, cut off the part that hurts.
Si uero lapis est plus quam unus, tunc impelle in primis magnum ad os uesicae.	But if the stone is larger than one, then push in the first large piece into the bladder.
Deinde incide super ipsum.	Then cut on top of it.
Postea impelle paruum post illud: et similiter fac si sunt plures duobus.	Then push in a small one after it: and do likewise if there are two or more.
Quod si magnus est ualde, tunc ignorantia est ut seces super ipsum sectione magna.	If the large one is very much so, then ignorance is how to cut across the top of the stone with a large cut.
Quoniam accidit infirmo una duarum rerum, aut ut moriatur, aut accidit ei distillatio urinae assidua: proptera, quia non consolidatur locus omnino.	Since it happens that one of the two things is ill, or that he dies, or that there is frequent passing of urine: then soon, since the place does not consolidate at all.
Verum administra expulsionem eius, donec egrediatur: aut ingenia in fractura eius cum forficibus, donec extrahas eum frustatim.	But bring about its expulsion, until it comes out: or put some device into the fracture with pliers, until you pull it out quickly.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc imple uulnus thure, et aloe, et sanguine draconis: et stringe ipsum, et pone super ipsum pannum infusum oleo et uino, aut oleo rosato, et aqua frigida: ut sedetur apostema calidum.	When you have completed your operation, then insert the thistle, and aloe, and dragon's blood; and bind it tightly, and place a cloth impregnated with oil and wine over it, or with rosewater, and cold water: that the heat may be abated by the cooling.
Deinde resupina infirmum super collum suum, et non soluas ligamentum, usque ad diem tertium.	And then bind up the wound on his neck, and do not separate the ligatures until the third day.
Cum ergo solueris ipsum, embroca locum cum aqua, et oleo multo.	When you have unbound him, wash the place with much oil and water.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dyafinicon, et unguento basilicon, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the wound with the dye-affin oil, and with the basilic oil, until it is healed.
Si autem accidit in uulnere apostema calidum additum, et corrosi, et illi similia: sicut si congeletur sanguis in uesica, et prohibeatur ex eo urina: et cognoscitur illud ex egressione sanguinis cum urina.	But if the heat of the blister added and corroded, and he has similar things: it is known from the exit of blood with urine.
Intromitte ergo digitum tuum in uulnus, et extrahe illum sanguinem.	Then insert your hand into the wound and draw out the blood.
Nam si remanet, prouocat ad corruptionem uesicae, et putrefactionem eius.	For if it remains, it incites to the corruption of the blister and to its putrefaction.
Deinde ablue uulnus cum aceto, et aqua, et sale: et oppone omni speciei cum eo quod conuenit ex curatione, usquequo sanetur.	Then wash the wound with vinegar, and water, and salt: and oppose to it whatever is suitable for the cure, until it is healed.
Et oportet in horis curationis totius, ut liges duas coxas, et aggreges, caussa medicinarum quae ponuntur super locum.	And during the hours of cure, bind two pillows and bands, a cause for the medicines that are placed on the place.
Quod si lapis est paruus, et sit in meatu uirgae, et figitur in eo, et prohibetur urinae exitus: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod narro antequam peruenias ad sectionem.	For if it is smooth stone, and it sits in the meadow, and it forms in it, and prevents the exit of urine: then take care of him with it before you come to the section.
Multotiens enim a sectione excusaris per hanc curationem, iam enim probaui illud.	For many times you will be spared from the section by this cure, for I have already tested it.
Et est, ut accipias Perforatorium ex ferro alferico, cuius haec est forma, triangulatae extremitatis, acutum, fixum in ligno.	And there is, to take the Forferator of iron steel, whose this form is, triangular extremities, acute, fixed on a wood.
Deinde accipe filum, et liga cum eo uirgam sub lapide ut non redeat ad uesicam.	Then take a thread, and bind it with him under a stone so that he does not recede to the blister.
Deinde intromitte ferrum perforans in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat Perforatorium ad ipsum lapidem: et reuolue Perforatorium manu tua in ipso lapide paulatim: et coneris perforationem eius, donec facias ipsum penetrare a parte altera.	Then insert the piercing iron into the shaft with ease, until it reaches the Perforator to the stone: and remove the Perforator from your hand little by little in that stone: and seal the perforation of it, until you make him pierce through one side.
Urina namque absoluitur statim.	He urinates, so let him be immediately washed.
Deinde preme manum tuam super illud quod remansit ex lapide ab exteriori parte uirgae.	Then press your hand upon that which remained of the stone from the outside of the urethra.
Ipse enim frangitur, et egreditur cum urina, et sanatur infirmus.	For it itself breaks and passes with the urine, and the sick person is healed.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi haec curatio, propter aliquid quod prohibet ab illo: tunc liga filum sub lapide, et filum aliud supra lapidem.	If you are not prepared for this cure, because of something that prevents it from being carried out: then bind one strand of thread underneath the stone, and another strand above the stone.
Deinde seca super lapidem in ipsa uirga inter duas ligaturas.	Then dry the stone on top of the urethra between the two ligatures.
Deinde extrahe ipsum.	Then extract it.
Postea solue ligamentum, et mundifica sanguinem congelatum, qui fit in uulnere.	Then loosen the ligature, and clean away the congealed blood, which came from the urethra.
Et non est necessarium ligamentum fili sub lapide, nisi ut non redeat ad uesicam: et ligamentum aliud desuper, nisi ut quando soluitur filum post egressionem lapidis, redeat cutis ad locum suum, et cooperiat uulnus: et propter illud necesse est tibi illud quando ligas filum superius, ut eleues cutem ad superiora, ut redeat apud complementum tuum, et cooperiat uulnus, sicut diximus.	And it is not necessary to bind the thread underneath the stone, unless you want to return it to the wound: and the upper ligature, unless when the thread is loosed after the stone has passed, returns the skin to its place, and covers the urethra: for this reason it is necessary that you bind the upper thread, so that the skin may be raised above, in order that it may return to your colleague, and cover the urethra, as we have said.
¶ De extractione Lapidis mulierum.	As for the extraction of the stone in women.
Caput LXI.	Chapter LXI.
Parum generatur Lapis in mulieribus.	 Stones are not often formed in women.
Si autem accidat alicui earum lapis, tunc difficilis est curatio, et prohibetur propter modos multos.	If, however, a stone occurs in any of them, then the cure is difficult, and is prohibited on account of many reasons.
Vnus eorum est: quod mulier fortasse est uirgo.	One reason is that the woman may be a virgin.
Et secundus est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem quae detegat seipsam medico, quando est casta, aut ex habentibus maritos.	And a second reason is that you should not examine a chaste woman, or one who has a husband.
Tertius est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem bene scientem hanc artem, praecipue operationem cum manu.	A third reason is that you should not examine a well-versed woman in this art, especially the hand operation.
Et quartus est longinquitas a loco lapidis: quare indiget sectione profunda, et in illo est timor.	And a fourth reason is that she is far away from the stone's location: for fear of injury, and because there is danger in the depth of the incision, and because it is painful.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad illud, tunc oportet ut accipias mulierem medicam, bene scientem: et parum inuenitur.	If necessity compels you to do this, then you should take a female doctor who is well-versed: and there are few of them.
Si uero priuaris ea, tunc quaere medicum castum, subtilem, et praesenta mulierem obstetricem bene doctam in re mulierum, aut mulierem quae in hac arte innuit partem artis: fac ergo eam praesentem, et praecipue ei, ut faciat totum quod praecipis ei ex inquisitione super lapidem.	If you really want to do this, then ask for a skilled, subtle doctor; and a well-educated midwife who is familiar with women's affairs, or a woman who is experienced in this art: so that she may do whatever you instruct her to do from your questioning about the stone.
In primis quod est, ut aspiciat si mulier est uirgo: tunc oportet ut intromittat digitum in anum eius, et quaerat lapidem.	First of all, to see if the woman is a virgin: then it should be that she inserts her finger into her and looks for the stone.
Si ergo inuenit ipsum, coartet eum sub digito suo, et tunc praecipe obstetrici, ut intromittat digitum suum in uuluam infirmae, et inquirat super lapidem, postquam ponit manum suam sinistram super uesicam, et comprimit eam compressione bona.	If it finds itself, she should cover it with her finger, and then instruct the midwife to insert her left hand into the woman's crotch, and to inquire about the stone, after she has placed her right hand on the woman's hip, and squeezes it firmly.
Si ergo inuenit lapidem, tunc oportet ut gradatim moueat eum ab orificio uesicae ad inferiora cum summa uirtutis suae, donec perueniat cum eo ad radicem coxae.	If it finds the stone, then she should gradually move it from the woman' opening at the bottom with all her might, until it reaches the root of the hip bone.
Deinde secet super eum apud oppositionem medietatis uuluae apud radicem coxae, ex quacunque parte praeparatur ei, et sentit lapidem in illa parte: et digitus eius non remoueatur a lapide, coartans sub eo: et sit sectio parua in primis.	Then she should cut it at the mid-point of the woman' hip opening towards the root, from whichever side it is prepared, and feel the stone in that place; and her finger should not move away from the stone, holding it underneath: and there should be a small section first.
Deinde intromittat radium super illam sectionem.	Then she should insert the bone end into that section.
Si ergo sentit lapidem, tunc addat in sectionem secundum quantitatem proportionatam quod lapis egreditur ab ea.	If she feels the stone, then she should add to that second section a quantity proportional to how much the stone moves away from her.
Et scias, quod species lapidis sunt multae.	And you shall know that there are many types of stones.
Ex his enim est paruus, et magnus, lenis et asper, longus, et rotundus habens ramos.	For this one is small and large, hard and rough, long and round, having branches.
Scias ergo species eius, ut significetur tibi per hoc super illud quod uis.	So you shall know the type of it, as I am indicating to you through this about what you want.
Si ergo uincit te sanguis, tunc adde in loco zegi tritum, et tene ipsum hora una, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If then blood is making you weak, then add to the wound three times, and hold it for an hour, until the blood has dried up.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis: et fac, ut praepares tecum ex instrumentis, quae dixi in extractione lapidis in uiris, ut adiuueris per ea in operatione tua.	Then turn your attention to your work again, until the stone has passed out; and make yourself ready with the instruments that I have told you about for extracting the stone from the urinary bladder, so that you can use them in your work.
Quod si uincit te fluxus sanguinis, et scis quod expulsio sanguinis est ex arteria quae incisa est: tunc pone puluerem super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis strictura decenti: et non mutes illud: et dimitte lapidem, et non extrahas ipsum.	If the blood flow hurts you, and you know that the blood comes out of the artery cut: then put powder on the place, and bind it with powder stricture decreasing: and do not change it; and let go the stone, and do not pull it out.
Fortasse enim morietur mulier infirma.	For a weak woman might die.
Deinde cura uulnus.	Then take care of the wound.
Cum ergo sedatur acuitas sanguinis post dies, et putrefit locus, tune redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis.	So when the sharpness of the blood passes after a few days, and the place becomes rotten: then turn to your work until the stone leaves.
¶ De sectione suiper Herniam aquosam.	The section on the hernial section with water.
Caput LXII.	Chapter LII.
Ramex aquosa non est, nisi aggregatio humiditatis in sifac albo, quod est sub cute testiculi continente ouum: et nominatur sifac.	Ram's water is not, unless a collection of moisture in the sifac pearl, which is under the skin of the testicle enclosed in one: and it is called sifac.
Et quandoque est in panniculo proprio sibi, quem praeparauit ei natura in parte oui, donec putetur: quod est ouum aliud, et est cutis testiculi inter sifac album, quod diximus: et non fit illud nisi raro.	And when it is in its own little pouch, which nature has prepared for it in a certain part of itself, until it puts out: that is another kind, and it is the skin of the testicles between the sifac pearl, which we have said: and it does not do this except rarely.
Et generatio quidem huius ramicis, est ex debilitate quae accidit testiculis: quare effunditur ad eos haec materia.	And the generation of this ramification is from the weakness that happens to the testicles: why this substance is poured out onto them.
Et quandoque accidit ex percussione super testiculos.	And when it happens from a blow on the testicles.
Et haec humiditas est habens colores multos.	And this moisture is having many colors.
Aut enim est color eius decliuis ad citrinitatem, aut est sanguineus rubeus, aut faeculentus, niger, aut est aquosus albus, et est illud quod est plus.	Or indeed its color is changing into yellowish, or it is red and leafy, black, or white-aquous, and that is what is more:
Et signa quibus scitur ubi sit aggregatio aquae, sunt ista.	And the signs by which one knows where the collection of water is, are these.
Nam si est in sifac albo quod diximus, tunc apostema est rotundum ad longitudinem parumper sicut figura oui: et non apparet testiculus, quoniam humiditas continet eum ab omni parte.	For if it is in the sifac pearl that we have said, then theapostema is round at about the length of a figure-eight: and the testicle does not show, because moisture contains it from all parts.
Et si est humiditas in panniculo proprio sibi, tunc apostema est rotundum cum parte oui, et propter hoc extimat homo quia est ouum aliud.	And if there is moisture in the own little pouch, then the apostema is round with a part of itself, and for this reason one man is estimated as having another kind:
Et si humiditas est inter cutem testiculorum et sifac album, tunc cadit sub sensu.	And if there is moisture between the skin of the testicles and the white siffac, then it falls down.
Quando ergo uis cognitionem coloris humiditatis, tunc experire colorem humiditatis in apostemate cum Intromisso quadrato, cuius forma praecessit.	When therefore you wish to know the color of moisture, then experience the color of moisture in the post-mortem with the square, whose form preceded.
Secundum illud ergo quod egreditur in uestigio Intromissi, iudica de illo quod est inter ipsum.	Accordingly, because it is issued into the recess of the square, judge it that is between itself.
Cum ergo uenimus ad curationem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, ut phlebotometur si possibile est ei illud, et uides corpus eius plenum.	When therefore we come to the cure with the iron, then it is necessary that you instruct the sick person to have himself bled if possible, and you will see the body full of blood.
Deinde resupinetur super dorsum suum super rem altam parum, et pone sub eo pannos multos.	Then let him lie on his back on a high place, and put under him many towels.
Deinde sede tu super sinistram eius, et praecipe ministro, ut sedeat a dextra eius, qui extendat uirgam eius ad unum duorum laterum cutis testiculorum, et ad partem mirach uentris.	Then sit down on his left side, and instruct the servant to sit on his right side, who will extend his penis to the inner side of the skin of the testicles, and to the side of the scrotum.
Deinde accipe spatumile latum, et seca cutem testiculorum ex medio per longitudinem, usque prope pectinem: et fiat sectio secundum rectitudinem aequedistantis lineae quae diuidit cutem testiculorum, donec perueniat ad sifac album comprehendens: et excoria ipsum et obserua, uel caue ex hoc, ut seces ipsum: et sit excoriatio tua qua ipsum excorias, ex parte quae suspenditur cum ouo plus: et subtiliter scrutare cum excoriatione secundum quantitatem quod tibi possibile est.	Then take a wide spit, and dry up the skin of the testicles from the middle along its length, up to the chest: and make the cut second according to an equidistant line that divides the skin of the testicles, until it encompasses the white siffac: and scrape him and observe, or quietly get away from it, so as to cut off him: and let your scraping sit on him, with the more he suspends with the egg, and carefully look at it with your scraping according to the quantity that you can.
Deinde perfora sifac plenum aqua perforatione ampla, et extrahe totam aquam.	Then pierce the white siffac with water in a wide perforation, and remove all the water.
Deinde separa inter duo labia sectionis cum uncinis, et extende sifac ad superiora, et non tangas cutem testiculorum comprehendentem: et incide sifac qualitercunque est possibile tibi incidere ipsum, aut cum totalitate sua, aut frustatim, praecipue latus eius subtile.	Then separate the two lobes of the incision with a hook, and extend the white siffac upward, and do not touch the skin of the testicles that is encompassing: and cut the white siffac in whatever way you can cut it, either with its entirety, or slightly, especially its side.
Nam si tu non exquisite perscrutaris, in incisione eius non fit securitas, quin aqua redeat.	For if you do not examine closely, there is no security in the incision, except that water be returned to it.
Si autem procedit ouum exterius a cute sua in hora operationis tuae: tunc quando compleueris sectionem sifac, reduc ipsum.	If however his right hand goes out from his wound at the time of your operation: then when you have completed the dissection of the side, reduce him.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cutis testiculorum cum sutura.	Then aggregate the two lips of the skin of the testicles with a suture.
Deinde cura ipsum sicut reliqua uulnera, donec sanetur.	Then care for him as you do for other wounds, until he is healed.
Quod si inuenis ouum corruptum ex nigredine alia, tunc oportet ut liges uasa, quae sunt suspensorium, timens fluxum sanguinis.	If however the right testicle has become corrupted by a blackness from elsewhere, then you must cut away the outer part of the skin, taking care to prevent blood flow.
Deinde abscinde testiculum cum suspensorio, et extrahe ouum: postea cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then cut off the testicle with its suspension, and remove it; then take care of it as we have said.
Si uero aqua est aggregata in duabus partibus, tunc scias quia sunt duae ramices: seca ergo partem aliam secundum quod fecisti in altera aequaliter.	If however water is gathered on both sides, then you should know that there are two branches; so dry one side as you have done with the other to make them equal.
Et si aequatur tibi, ut sit operatio una, tunc fac: deinde absterge sanguinem.	And if it is equal to you, so that the operation is the same, then do it; then wash away the blood.
Et intromitte in sectiones lanam submersam in oleo, aut in oleo rosato: et pone deforis lanam aliam quam submersisti in uino et oleo, et expande eam super duos testiculos, et mirach uentris: et pone desuper pannos duplicatos, et sunt puluilli: et liga eos desuper cum ligamento, quod est habens sex secundum hanc formam.	And introduce the wet cloth between the loins and the fat; and place another dry cloth over the loins, which you have dipped in wine and oil, and spread it over the two testicles, and tie it with a thread, six times round; then take off the upper cloths, and they are dry; and bind them together above with a ligature, which has six turns.
Deinde sumantur duo panni, et suantur, et impleantur la na carminata, secundum hanc similitudinem: et fiant extremitates quibus premitur ex coto, aut lana humida: et aggregentur cum strictura in lumbari bracharum: et una extremitatum accipiat super anum usque ad dorsum, et secunda accipiat ad partem pectinis: et duae extremitates super duas coxas inferius, et duae extremitates aliae super duo inguina, et aggregetur strictura tota in lumbari bracharum.	Then take two cloths, and make them wet, and fill them with carmine, according to this similarity: and let the ends which are pressed together by the cotter, or moist wool; and aggregate them with a knot in the loin of the arm; and one end shall take hold above on some part until it reaches the back, and the other end shall take hold to the side of the pelvis: and both ends shall take hold beneath the two hips, and another end shall take hold of the two inguinas, and all the ends shall aggregate together in the loin of the arm.
Et, quandoque artificialiter medicatur haec ramex cum cauterio loco sectionis cum ferro: et est, ut accipias cauterium cultellare subtile, et seces cum eo cutem testiculorum: et est ignitum, secundum quod narrauimus: donec quando detegitur sifac album continens aquam: tunc accipe cauterium, secundum hanc formam.	And when this wire is medicated by the fire of the section with a sharp knife: and it is, as we have said, to take hold of the skin of the testicles with it; and it is burned, according to which we told you: until such time as it discovers white albumen containing water: then take hold of the fire, according to this shape.
Assimilatur literae graecae.	The Greek letter is assimilated.
Deinde perfora cum eo illud sifac, et est ignitum, donec egrediatur humiditas tota.	Then pierce with it that other one, the sihac, and let it burn until all of the moisture has drained out.
Deinde extende sifac cum uncinis, et excoria cum cauterio subtili ignito, et incide ipsum secundum quod possibile est tibi, donec eradices totum eius.	Then extend the sihac with a hook, and scrape with a fine red-hot iron, and cut it off as well as you can, until you have completely removed it.
Et caue ex ouo, ne tangat ipsum ignis.	And take care that the fire does not burn the patient.
Et scias, quod haec operatio est saluior, et longinquior a fluxu sanguinis, et melior quam operatio cum sectione.	And know that this operation is more salutary, and has a longer duration free from blood flow, and is better than the operation of section.
Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit in hora sectionis, aut in hora cauterii apostema calidum, aut fluxus sanguinis, aut aliquid aliud: tunc oportet ut cures quod contrarietatem tibi facit ex illo cum curatione quae conuenit ei, secundum quod praemissum est.	If, however, the opposite effect disturbs you at the time of section, or at the time of cauterization by heat, or by blood flow, or by anything else: then you should take care that you do what disturbances you with the cure which is suitable for it, as has been premised.
Si autem infirmus est timidus, et non expectat super hanc operationem, propter horribilitatem suam: tunc administra perforationem secundum quod ego narro illud: et est.	If, however, the sick person is timid and does not expect this operation, because of its horrible nature: then administer the piercing as I narrate below: and it is done.
Quando certificatur tibi apud te per illud quod diximus de significationibus, quod ramex est aquosa: tunc oportet quod facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	When you are certified within yourself by that which we have said about the meanings, that the ramus is watery: then you should make the sick person sit on an elevated seat.
Deinde perfora apostema in inferiori parte sui cum spatumili lato: et pone perforationem secundum longitudinem corporis, et sit apertio ampla, donec currat aqua tota.	Then pierce the apostema in the lower part of its body with a sharp knife: and place the piercing according to the length of the body, and keep the aperture wide until all the water has drained out.
Deinde pone super locum cotum, et liga ipsum, et dimitte ipsum ut currat residuum aquae: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then place a cloth over the spot, and tie it up, and let him run to drain off the remaining water: then take care of the wound, until the bruise has healed over.
Si autem contrarietas sit egressioni aquae in hora qua perforas ipsam: et non sit illud nisi propterea, quia panniculus albus contrarietatem facit in orificio uulneris, et prohibet exitum aquae: tunc oportet ut intromittas pennam in uulnus, aut instrumentum cum quo extrahitur aqua hydropicorum, cuius forma praecessit: aut adde in operatione uulneris parumper.	If, however, there is an opposite effect of the drainage of water at the time when you pierce it: and this should not be except for this reason, because the white cloth causes an opposite effect in the orifice of the wound, and prevents the exit of water: then you should introduce a feather into the wound, or an instrument with which the water is drawn out, of which shape preceded it: or add a little to the operation of the wound.
Et scias, quod aqua redit, et aggregatur post sex menses, aut circiter eos.	And you know that water returns and is added after six months, or about them.
Cum ergo aggregatur, tunc pertoretur secundum eundem modum, et pertransibit infirmus dies suos.	But when it is added, then it returns in the same way, and the sick person will spend his days.
¶ De cura Ramicis carnosae.	On the care of the carnose ramulus.
Caput LXIII.	Head LIII.
Scias, quod in sectione super hanc Ramicem, est ex timore perducente ad perniciem in pluribus dispositionibus.	You know that when this ramus is cut off, it leads to harm in many conditions.
Quapropter uidetur mihi eius dimissio saluari ex ea.	Therefore I send him away from that ramus so that he may be healed of it.
Et ego sum rememorans operationem in ea, et species apostematis.	And I remember the operation on her and the appearance of the wound.
Dico ergo, quod accidunt apostemata multa in corporibus, ex quibus componuntur testiculi: et fit illud ex caussis multis, scilicet.	I say that many pustules occur in the bodies, from which the testicles are composed: and it comes about for various reasons, namely.
Aut ex superfluitate acuta, uel acri, quae effunditur ad testiculos.	Or from acute swelling or heat, which is discharged to the testicles.
Aut ex percussione.	Or from a blow.
Et est color apostematis secundum colorem corporis, et non inuenitur ei dolor: et est apostema graue.	And the color of the pustule corresponds to the color of the body, and it is not felt; and the pustule is gray.
Et fortasse est apostema lapideum, cuius color est fuscus, et non est sensus ei.	And perhaps it is a stone pustule, whose color is dark, and there is no feeling of it.
Et quandoque fit ex nodatione arteriarum, et inflatione earum: sicut iam praecessit eius rememoratio: aut ex inflatione uenarum.	And when it comes from the obstruction of arteries and the swelling of the veins: as I have already reminded you: or from the swelling of the feet.
Quod ergo est ex eis ex inflatione arteriarum, cognoscitur per dispositionem apostematis, quando comprimis ipsum digitis tuis.	Which is why, when it comes from the obstruction of arteries, it is recognized by the appearance of the pustule, when you compress it with your fingers.
Et non oportet ut tangas ipsum prorsus.	And you should not touch the person at all.
Illud uero quod fit ex inflatione uenarum, non dispergitur ex eo aliquid apud compressionem cum digitis.	But that which comes from the swelling of the veins does not spread anything away from the body when pressed with the fingers.
Et iam possibile est, quod super hanc speciem fiat sectio, et super reliquas carnes: et est, ut seces cutem testiculorum.	And it is also possible that this ramus should be cut off, and that the flesh remain: and it is done so as to separate the skin of the testicles.
Deinde extende ouum ad sursum, et extrahe ipsum cum sifach albo: et libera suspensorium ex uasis, et liga uasa: et incide suspensorium postquam tu liberas ipsum ab omni parte ex partibus oui.	Then extend your arm above, and pull out the skin with a knife or scissor: and free the suspenders from the water, and tie the band around it: and cut the suspenders off when you have freed the skin from all parts of it.
Si ergo ouum consolidatum est cum illis carnibus natis, tunc oportet ut attrahas ouum, et incidas ipsum.	If therefore my bone is well healed with those flesh-borne bones, then you should draw me out, and strike me down.
Et si adhaerentia est inter aliquid ex siphaket, aut in eo quod est inter uasa: tunc oportet ut liberes totam illam adhaerentiam, et incidas eam incisione rotunda.	And if there is an attachment between any of the joints, or in it that is between the bones: then you should release all that attachment, and strike it with a round incision.
Si autem est natiuitas carnis in loco adhaerentiae quae est retro: tunc oportet ut incidas totum eius, et extrahas ouum, sicut diximus.	But if the birth of flesh is in the place of the attachment that is behind: then you should strike all of it, and draw out my bone, as we have said.
Cum ergo completur operatio tua, tnnc imple uulnus in lana infusa in oleo rosato, et uino: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When your operation is complete, then fill the bone with wool infused with rose oil, and wrap it in linen: then take care of the whole cure, until it heals.
¶ De cura Ramicis, quae est cum Vite.	Regarding the care of the ramus, which is with the vine.
Caput LXIIII.	Head LXIIII.
Uitis est apostema inuolutum quadam inuolutione, simile botro, cum mollificatione testiculorum: et fit difficilis super infirmum motus et exercitium, et deambulatio.	The use is an inflammation somewhat similar to a boil, with softening of the testes: and it becomes difficult on the part of the patient to move, exercise, and walk.
Et in curatione huius aegritudinis est ex timore, propter illud cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And in the cure of this illness there is a fear because of the previous memory.
Verum oportet, ut dicamus operationem in ea secundum quod fecerunt primi.	But it should be said, let us speak about the operation in her as they did on the first.
Dico ergo, quod oportet ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	I say, that you should make the patient sit on an elevated seat.
Deinde impelle suspensorium testiculorum ad inferiora.	Then push the suspender of the testes down to the lower part.
Deinde tene cutem testiculorum cum digitis tuis, cum uasis quae sunt propinqua uirgae: et teneat ea minister alius, et extendat ea extensione uehementi.	Then hold the skin of the testes with your fingers, which are next to the pubic hair: and let another hold it as a minister, and stretch it out with a violent extension.
Deinde incide cum spatumili lato acuto sectione transuersa in directo uasorum, donec detegantur uasa.	Then cut with an acute chisel-shaped knife across the straight of the pubic hair, until the skin is detected.
Deinde excoria ab omni parte, sicut diximus tibi in extractione Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then scrape off all parts, as we have said to you in the extraction of arteries which are in the tempura.
Postea fige in eis acum in qua sit filum duplum, et liga ipsum in primo locorum quibus accidunt Vites: et liga ipsum iterum in ultimo eorum.	Then insert into them a little hook where there is a double filament, and tie the rope at the first place where the vines are: and tie it again at the last of them.
Deinde seca ea in media sectione recta secundum longitudinem corporis, et extrahe quod aggregatur ex humiditatibus faeculentis corruptis.	Then cut it in half along the straight line according to the length of the body, and remove what is accumulated from the corroded faeculent wetnesses.
Deinde cura uulnus cum curatione reliquorum uulnerum, in quibus uis generari saniem, ut cadant uasa quae nutriunt unum testiculorum.	Then care for the hernia with the treatment of the remaining wounds, in which the health may grow again, so that the clothes which feed one testicle drop.
Non est enim malum per illud.	For that is not bad through that.
Si autem accidat Vitis omnibus uasis, tunc oportet ut extrahantur propter hoc testiculi cum uasis: ut non priuetur ouum nutrimento, propter incisionem, et tabescat, uel arescat, et non sit iuuamentum cum eis.	But if it happens to all the clothes, then they should remove it for this reason from the testicles with the wetness: so that it is not shut off from its nourishment, through the incision, and does not heal, or scar, and is not a problem with them.
¶ De cura Ramicis intestinalis.	As for the cure of the intestinal vitis.
Caput LXV.	Chapter LXV.
Euentus huius Ramicis est ex sectione, quae accidit in sifach extenso super uentrem in parte inguinum ex mirach uentris.	The exit of this vitis is from the section that happens in the siffach expanse on the belly in the part of the groin of the testicles.
Quare descendunt intestina ex illa Ruptura ad unum testiculorum.	Why do the intestines come out from that break towards one testicle?
Et haec Ruptura est aut ex sifach, aut extensione eius.	And this break is either from the siffach, or from the extension of it.
Et accidunt istae duae species ex caussis multis: aut ex percussione, aut saltu, aut clamore, aut eleuatione rei grauis, et similibus.	And these two species arise from many causes: either from a hit, or a slip, or a noise, or lifting up of something heavy, and similar things.
Et signum, quando est ex extensione sifach.	And the sign, when it is from the extension of the siffach.
Est quod accidit paulatim in tempore longo, et non accidit subito: et est apostema aequale uersus profundum: propterea, quod sifach comprimit intestinum.	This is what happens gradually over a long period of time and not suddenly; it is an swelling equally towards the inside: because the siffach compresses the intestines.
Et signum eius quando est ex sectione sifach, quia facit accidere ex principio sui dolorem uehementem subito: et est apostema diuersum, apparens sub cute propinque: et illud est propter exitum intestini, et cursus eius ad exteriora sifach.	And the sign of it when it is from the section of the siffach, because it causes sudden, sharp pain at the beginning: and it is an swelling that shows itself under the skin and near to it; and that is because of the exit of the intestines, and their course towards the outer siffach.
Et quandoque egreditur cum intestino zirbum: et nominatur haec Ramex intestinalis, et zirbia: et quandoque fit cum uentositate.	And when it comes out with the intestino zireum: and this is called the zireum of the intestines, and the zireum, and sometimes it happens with a windiness.
Et quandoque currit in intestinum stercus, et retinetur illic: et est cum eo pernicies infirmi: quoniam facit accidere dolorem prauum, et praecipue quando premitur.	And sometimes it runs into the feces in the intestines and stays there; and with that there is a problem of sickness: because it causes sharp pain, especially when it is pressed.
Et in curatione specierum aegritudinis huius cum ferro est timor: quare oportet ut caueatur casus in ea.	And there is a fear in the cure of this disease with iron: why should that case be avoided in it.
Et modus operationis est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut reducat intestinum manu sua ad interiora concauitatis suae, si obedit reditui.	And the mode of operation is, that you should instruct the sick person to bring his intestines by hand into the cavity of his illness, if he obeys return.
Deinde resupinetur super collum suum inter manus tuas: et eleua crura eius.	Then let him lie on his back between your hands; and wash his feet.
Deinde extende cutem quae sequitur cutem ad superiora, et seca cutem testiculorum totam per longitudinem.	Then extend the skin that follows the skin upwards, and dry the skin of the testes throughout its length.
Deinde fige in duobus labiis sectionis uncinos, secundum quod indiges ad aperiendum sectionem cum eis: et sectio sit secundum quantitatem, quod sit possibile, ut egrediatur ex ea ouum.	Then fix in two lips of the incision, according as you open the section with them: and the section sits according to the quantity, that it may be possible for him to emerge from it his wound.
Deinde excoria siphak, et quae sunt sub cute testiculorum, donec quando detegitur sifach album, durum ab omni parte: tunc intromitte digitum tuum indicem in eo quod sequitur testiculum, in eo quod est inter siphach album, quod est sub cute oui, et inter sifach secundum, et absolue cum eo adhaerentiam quae est in posteriori parte oui.	Then scrape the scrotum, and that which is under the skin of the testes, until when it is touched, it is hard on all sides: then insert your finger of the index into it that follows the testicle, in that which is between the white scrotum, which is under the skin, and between the second scrotum, and completely take away with it the adhesion that is in the posterior part of the scrotum.
Deinde moue cum manu dextra ad interiora cutem testiculorum: et cum hoc extende sifach album ad sursum, cum manu sinistra: et eleua ouum cum sifach ad partem sectionis: et praecipe ministro, ut extendat ouum ad sursum: et tu solue adhaerentiam, quae est retro solutione completa.	Then move with your right hand into the interior of the skin of the testes: and with this extend the white scrotum upward, with your left hand; and wash his wound with the scrotum towards the section: and instruct the minister to extend the wound upward: and you dissolve the adhesion, which is behind the complete solution.
Et quaere digitis tuis, ut non sit aliquid illic ex intestino inuoluto in sifach albo duro.	And seek with your fingers that there is nothing there from the intestines in white scrotum hard.
Si autem inuenis ex eo aliquid: tunc impelle ipsum ad uentrem inferius.	If, however, there is any irritation from it: then push him down towards the navel.
Deinde accipe acum, in qua sit filum grossum, factum licinium ex decem filis: et intromitte ipsam apud postremum sifach, id est, tunicae, quod est sub cute testiculorum quae sequitur sectionem: deinde incide extremitates quae eminent ex filo, donec sint quatuor fila.	Then take the acume, in which sits the thick thread, made of ten threads: and insert it behind the scrotum, that is under the skin that follows the section: then cut off the extremities that project from the thread, until there are four strands.
Deinde compone quaedam eorum super quaedam cum figura quae sit in modo crucis: et liga cum eis alsifach, de quo diximus, quia est sub cute testiculorum ligamento uehementi, donec non possit aliquod ex uasis, quae nutriunt eos mittere ad eos aliquid: ut non accidat inde apostema calidum.	Then compose some of them over some with a figure which sits in the form of a cross: and bind with them the white scrotum, of which we have spoken, because it is under the skin of the testes ligamento vehemently, until there can be no place from the water that nourishes them to send to them something: so that there does not occur from this therefore gangrene hot.
Et pone iterum ligamentum secundum extra ligamentum primum, longinquum ab eo minus duobus digitis.	And again place the second ligament outside the first ligament, two fingers from it.
Et post ista duo ligamenta dimitte ex sifach, quod est sub cute testiculorum, quantitatem magnitudinis digiti: et incide reliquum totum secundum rotunditatem, et aufer ex eo ouum.	And after these two ligaments leave out from the foreskin, which is under the skin of the testicles, the size of a finger: and cut all of it roundly, and take it out of it.
Deinde seca in inferiori parte cutis testiculorum sectione, ex qua currit sanguis, et sanies: sicut narrauimus in eo quod praemissum est.	Then dry in the lower part of the skin of the testicles, from which runs blood, and pus: as we have said before.
Deinde administra lanam submersam in oleo, et pone in uulnus: et administra ligamentum quod narrauimus.	Then administer wool soaked in oil, and put it on the thread: and administer the ligament that we have described.
Et quandoque cauterizatur sifach album quod diximus, post incisionem eius timendo de fluxu sanguinis.	And when the foreskin is cauterized with white alum which we said, after cutting it while fearing about the flow of blood.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	This often happens.
Et dimitte ligamentum, donec cadat per se.	And remove the ligament, until it falls by itself.
Si autem tardatur casus eius, tunc embrocetur cum aqua calida: et pone super ipsum illud quod diximus, donec cadat.	But if this case is delayed, then boil it with warm water: and put on that which we said, until it falls down.
Deinde cura uulnus cum reliqua curatione uulnerum, donec curetur.	Then care for the thread with the remaining treatment of the wound, until it is healed.
¶ De Ramice uentosa.	The ramie wool.
Caput LXVI.	Chapter LVI.
IN Hac Ramice non uidi aliquem qui ausus fuerit super curationem eius cum ferro.	In this ramie there was no one who dared to use iron for its treatment.
Et primi quidem dixerunt, quod fit sicut narrauimus in Ramice quae est cum Vite.	And first they said that it happened as we described in the ramie which is with Vinegar.
Quod est, ut liges uasa post sectionem super ea cum facilitate inferius: deinde seca in medio, et cura postremo cum eo quod aperit ipsum, donec cadant uasa: et cura uulnus, secundum quod diximus, donec sanetur.	Which is, that the ligaments used after cutting on it with ease go down: then dry in the middle, and care afterwards when it opens itself up, until they fall down: and care for the thread, according to what we said, until it is healed.
¶ De disruptione quae fit in inguinibus.	The incision made in the groin.
Caput LXVII.	Chapter LVII.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, sicut diximus, et eminet locus, et non descendit ad testiculos aliquid ex intestinis: et si descendit, est illud parum, et redit in omnibus horis: uerum si prolongatur cum ea tempus, additur fissura in sifach, donec descendunt intestina in sifach.	When it happened that a rupture occurred in the groin, as we said, and the gap was large, and did not go down to the testicles anything from the intestines: and if it went down, it is little, and comes back in all times: but if it is prolonged with time, there is added a tear in the foreskin, until the intestines go into the foreskin.
Et accidit illud ex extensione sifach, quod est in inguinibus, sicut diximus.	And this happens from an extension of syphous, which is in the groin, as we have said.
Quod est, quia extenditur sifach: deinde mollificatur, et apostematur locus, et eminet.	That is, because syphous extends: then it softens, and the place is inflamed, and it oozes.
Et cura eius est cum cauterio, sicut praecessit eius narratio.	And the cure of it is with a poultice, as preceded by its narrative.
Et quandoque curatur cum ferro, secundum hunc modum: et est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum inter manus tuas.	And when it is cured with iron, in this way: and it is, so that the sick one lies on his back between your hands.
Deinde seca locum Rupturae apostematum et eminentem, sectione per latitudinem, secundum quantitatem trium digitorum.	Then dry the place of the rupture, the inflamed and oozing one, by cutting through its width, according to the quantity of three fingers.
Deinde stringe alsifak et, quae sunt sub cute, donec quando detegitur sifach album, quod est sub cute quae sequitur ipsum.	Then tighten alsifak and, which are under the skin, until when it is touched, white alsifak, which is under the skin, follows it.
Tunc accipe radium, et pone ipsum super locum eminentem ex sifach, et preme ipsum ad profundum uentris.	Then take a ray and put it on the place that is oozing out of syphous, and press it down to the depth of the hand.
Deinde sue duo loca eminentia super extremitatem radii ex sifach, et annecte cum sutura unum eorum cum altero: deinde extrahe extremitatem radii.	Then sue two oozing places at the end of the ray out of syphous and join them together with a stitch; then remove the end of the ray.
Et non incidas alsifach omnino, neque tendas ouum, neque aliud, sicut feci te scire in curatione ramicis intestinalis.	And do not at all touch alsifak, nor stretch out one, nor anything else, as I have made you know in the cure of an intestinal root.
Deinde cura illud curatione uulnerum.	Then the cure of this wound.
Cum ergo incidis fila, mundifica illud, et restaura uulnus, donec consolidetur.	When you do this incision, purify it, and restore the bone, until it is hardened.
Sisach enim contrahitur, et non additur eminentia Rupturae.	For alsifak is contracted, and no oozing is added to the rupture.
Et cauterium est melius in hoc loco: quoniam est propinquius ad salutem.	And the cauterium is better in this place, because it is nearer to salvation.
¶ De mollificatione cutis testiculorum.	Regarding the softening of the skin of the testicles.
Caput LXVIII.	Chapter LVIII.
Multotiens mollificatur cutis testiculorum in quibusdam hominibus, propter quod mollificantur carnes quae sunt inter ea, et foedatur aspectus eius.	The skin of the testicles is often softened in some men, because those flesh which are between them become softened, and his appearance is made feeble.
Ergo necesse est ei qui rogatur in curatione eius, ut faciat iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et incidat totam cutem quae mollificata est super cutem naturalem.	Therefore it is necessary for him who is asked to cure his disease that he should lie on his back, and make the softened skin cover the natural skin all over.
Deinde aggreget duo labia cum sutura: et si uis, sue in primis superfluitatem cutis mollificatae tribus suturis, aut quatuor, et firma suturam.	Then sewed up the two lips with a stitch: and if the eye, first of all it is superfluous to skin softened three or four stitches, and firm stitch.
Deinde incide inter sututuras.	Then cut between the stitches.
Deinde cura curatione reliquorum uulnerum, usquequo sanetur, et cadant fila.	Then care for the cure of the remaining wounds, until they heal, and let the threads fall off.
¶ De Castratione.	§ On castration.
Caput LXIX.	Chapter LIX. On the operation for castration.
Scias, quod Castratio in lege nostra excommunicata est: et propter illud liceret mihi, ut non rememorarer eius in libro meo isto: et non est necessaria rememoratio eius, nisi propter duos modos.	Know that castration is excommunicated in our law: and for that reason it would be fit that I should not remember it in my book here: and the remembrance of it is not necessary except for two reasons.
Quorum unus est, ut sit illud in scientia medici quando interrogatur de ea: et ut sciat curationem eius cui accidit.	One is that it may be in the knowledge of a physician when he is questioned about it: and that he may know how to cure him who has it happen to him.
Et modus alter est, quod nos multotiens indigemus castratione quorundam animalium, propter iuuamenta nostra per illud, sicut arietum, hyrcorum, et gattorum, et similium ex animalibus.	And the other mode is that we often lack castration of certain animals, for their benefits to us through it, such as rams, horses, and cats, and like creatures from among the animals.
Dico ergo, quod Castratio fit secundum duos modos.	I say then, that castration is done according to two modes.
Aut per attritionem.	Or by friction.
Aut per fissuram, et sectionem.	Or by incision and section.
In illa autem quae fit per attritionem, uia operationis est: quod nos faciamus sedere animal in aqua calida, donec mollificentur testiculi eius, et leniantur, et pendeant: deinde attere eos manu tua, donec resoluantur et non appareant sub tactu.	In that which is done by friction, the course of the operation is: that we should make the animal sit in warm water until its testicles become softened and loosened and hang down: then we should nip them off with our hand, until they are completely gone and do not appear under the touch.
In castratione autem per fissuram et sectionem, oportet ut teneas animal, et premas cutem testiculorum eius cum manu sinistra.	But in castration by incision and section, you should hold the animal, and press the skin of its testicles with your left hand.
Deinde liga suspensorium, et seca super omne ouum sectione una, donec quando procedunt duo oua: tunc incide ea postquam excoriaueris utrumque, et non dimittas super ea ex sifaket aliquid praeter sifac subtile, quod est super uasa.	Then bind the suspenders, and dry on all the wound one, until both balls have come: then cut it after you have scraped them both, and do not leave behind on it any scurf of skin, which is over the skin.
Et iste modus castrationis est melior eo qui fit per attritonem: quoniam attritio fortasse relinquit aliquid ex testiculis, quare desiderat animal coitum.	And this mode of castration is better than that which is done by friction: because by friction there might perhaps be something lost from the testicles, which would make the animal desire to copulate.
Deinde cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Then heal the fracture, until it heals.
¶ De cura Hermafroditae duorum modorum.	The cure for hermaphroditism is twofold.
Caput LXX.	Chapter LXX.
Hermafrodita ex uiris est secundum duos modos.	(It) is from the testicles, by means of two modes.
Vnus eorum est, quia apparet in eo quod sequitur spacium, aut in cute testiculorum, in eo quod est inter duos testiculos, figura quasi uulua mulieris, in qua sunt pili: et quandoque currit urina ex eo quod est in cute testiculorum.	(The scrotum is) because it appears to be in that which follows the space, or on the skin of the testicles, in that it is between the two testicles, like a little woman's shape, with hair: and sometimes the urine runs from it from that which is in the skin of the testicles.
In mulieribus autem est species una, et est uulua mulieris super pectinem sicut testiculi uiri parui omnino, eminentes ad exteriora: quorum unus est sicut priapus uiri, et duo sicut duo testiculi.	(In women there is) one sort, and it is a little woman' s shape (like the testicles of a man), placed on the rib cage like the testicles of a small child, prominent to the outside: of which one is like the penis of a man, and two like two testicles.
Et curatio trium specierum, duarum ex uiris, et speciei unius ex mulieribus, est: quia oportet ut incidas carnes additas, donec effugiat impressio earum.	(And the cure of the three species, two from the testicles, and one from a woman, is this): because it is necessary that you strike off the added flesh, until you remove the impression of them.
Deinde cura eas curatione reliquorum uulnerum.	Then heal those remaining wounds.
In specie autem secunda uirorum, ex qua egreditur urina, quae est in cute testiculorum, non est operatio, neque est eius curatio omnino.	(In the second species of men, from which the urine issues out from the skin of the testicles, there is no operation, nor is there any cure at all).
¶ De incisione Tentiginis, et carnis eminentis in uuluis mulierum.	(On the cutting of tenting and prominent flesh in women's vulvas.)
Caput LXXI.	Chapter LXXI.
Tentigo fortasse additur super rem naturalem, donec foedatur et turpis fit aspectus eius: et quandoque magnificatur in quibusdam mulieribus adeo, donec expanditur sicut in uiris, et peruenit usque ad coitum.	(The tenting is perhaps added to the natural thing, until it feeds and turns ugly: and sometimes it becomes enlarged in some women so much that it approaches to the crotch, and extends as far as to intercourse.)
Oportet ergo ut teneas superfluitatem Tentiginis manu, aut cum uncino, et incidas: et non ultimes in incisione, praecipue in profundo radicis: ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	(Therefore you should hold back the tenting with your hand, or with a pincers, and strike off it: and not finally in the cutting, especially in the deep root: so that blood may not flow.)
Deinde cura ipsam curatione uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then heal that wound with this cure, until it heals.
Caro autem orta, est caro quae nascitur in orificio matricis, donec impleat ipsum: et fortasse egreditur ad exteriora secundum similitudinem caudae: et propter illud quidam primi nominant aegritudinem caudatam.	(But the middle flesh is flesh that is born in the womb of the mother, until it fills itself up: and perhaps it issues out to the outside according to the likeness of a tail: and because of this some call the illness with a tail.)
Oportet ergo ut incidamus eam sicut incidimus Tentiginem, et curemus eam, donec sanetur.	We should therefore incise it as we incised Tentigine, and treat it until it heals.
¶ De cura Alratica, quae est uulua mulieris non perforata.	On the treatment of a wart on a woman's thumb that is not piercing.
Caput LXXII.	Head LVII.
Alratica est, ut sit uulua mulieris non perforata, aut sit foramen paruum.	Is it a wart on a woman's thumb that is not piercing, or a small hole?
Et est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	And it is either a natural one, or an accidental one.
Accidentalis est ex aegritudine quae praecessit: et ipsa quidem fit aut ex carne nata addita, aut sifach subtili, aut spisso: et fit aut in profundo matricis, aut in lateribus eius, aut in superiore ipsius, aut inferiori eius: et prohibet a coitu et impregnatione, et partu, et fortasse prohibet menstrua.	This is an accidental one due to an underlying illness, and it may have arisen from meat that has become attached to the finger, or from a splinter of wood, or from dirt: it may be located in the depth of a wound, or in its sides, or in its upper part, or in its lower part; and it should be prevented from sexual intercourse and fertilization, pregnancy, and perhaps menstruation as well.
Et cognitio illius fit per aspectum obstetricis, si opilatio est apparens propinqua.	And the knowledge of this is obtained by the appearance of symptoms during childbirth if the swelling is visible nearby.
Si autem non est apparens, tunc quaere eam digitis tuis, aut cum radio.	But if it is not visible, then feel for it with your fingers, or with a ray of light.
Si autem opilatio est ex sifach subtili, et est propinqua duobus labiis: tunc propera, et disrumpe ipsam.	But if the swelling is caused by a small splinter that is near to two lips: then bring it closer, and wash it off.
Et est, ut ponas super duo labia puluillos.	And it is, as you place a few hairs between the two lips.
Deinde pone indices tuos duarum manuum simul, et mulier sit super dorsum suum expansis cruribus suis.	Then place your fingers of both hands at the same time, and have the woman lie on her back with her legs spread wide.
Deinde extende duo labia cum fortitudine, donec disrumpatur sifach subtile, et aperiatur opilatio.	Then open the two lips firmly, until the small splinter comes out, and the swelling is opened.
Deinde accipe lanam, et imbibe eam in oleo, et pone ipsam super locum: et coeat mulier omni die, ut non consolidetur locus uice alia.	Then take a piece of wool, dip it in oil, and place it on the spot: and let the woman sit for a day, so that the spot does not become solid again under any other pressure.
Si autem sifach est grossum, spissum: tunc oportet ut seces ipsum cum spatumili lato simili folio myrti.	But if the splinter is large and coarse: then it should be separated with a flat blade of laurel leaf similar to a splint.
Si autem opilatio est ex carne nata, tunc suspende eam cum uncinis, et incide eam: et sint tecum medicinae quae fluxum sedant sanguinis absque mordicatione, sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus aggregatum cum albugine oui.	But if the swelling is caused by flesh born: then suspend it with a hook, and incise it: and have with you remedies that stop the flow of blood without causing pain, such as acacia, and dragon' s blood, and congealed milk with its white of an egg.
Deinde administra cannulam ex plumbo amplam, ut non consolidetur uulnus uelociter, teneat eam diebus aliquot: et administra licinium ex lino sicco, deinde curetur reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then insert a large cannula of brass, so that the ulcer heals more quickly; hold it in place for several days: and then insert the linch-pin made from dried linen, and then continue with the remaining treatment until it is healed.
Et quandoque nasciur in matrice natiuitas carnium aliarum: oportet ergo ut incidantur secundum hunc modum: dum non est apostema cancerosum apostemati enim canceroso quod est in matrice, non fiat contrarietas cum ferro omnino.	And at times when a fetus is born, birth defects of the limbs occur: therefore they should happen in this way: since there is no opposition with iron at all when there is an ulcerous discharge from the womb and this is cancerous, there should be no contrariety with it.
¶ De cura hemorroidarum, Athehelil, et Bothor rubeae in uuluis mulierum.	Regarding the treatment of hemorrhoids, Athahelis, and both red and white warts in women's genitals.
Caput LXXIII.	Chapter LVII. On the Treatment of Hemorrhoids, Athahel
Hemorroides quidem sunt apertio orificiorum uenarum, donec currit ex eis sanguis multus assidue.	Hemorrhoids are an opening of the anal orifice, from which runs a great deal of blood.
Cum ergo antiquantur hemorroides, fiunt thelil: et iam dixi in diuisione species earum, et signa ipsarum: et dicam hic quae ex eis recipiunt curationem, et quae non.	When therefore the hemorrhoids have become large, they are called thistles; and I have already spoken in the division of their species and signs; and here I will speak of those which receive treatment and of those which do not.
Dico ergo, quod hemorroides quae sunt in orificio matricis, et non apparent sensui: tunc non est ei curatio cum ferro.	I say then that the hemorrhoids which are in the orifice of the womb and do not appear to be sensitive: then there is no cure for them with iron.
Quae autem ex eis sunt in orificio matricis super quas cadit sensus, sunt quae curantur.	But those which are in the orifice of the womb above where sensuality is, are those which are cured.
Oportet ergo ut intromittas mulierem in domum frigidam.	Therefore it is necessary that you should enter the woman into a cold house.
Deinde extende athehelil cum forficibus, aut cum panno aspero, et incide eas ex radicibus suis.	Then extend Athahel with pincers or with a rough cloth and cut them from their roots.
Deinde pulueriza super eas apud fluxum sanguinis ex uno puluerum incisiuorum absque mordificatione: sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus, et similia eis.	Then sprinkle them with powder near the flow of blood from one incised powder without mortification: as acacia, and dragon's blood, and thorns, and similar things to them.
Deinde impellat pedes eius ad parietem hora una.	Then push her feet against a wall for an hour.
Postea depone eam in aquam frigidam.	Then put her in cold water.
Quod si perseuerat fluxus sanguinis: tunc fac eam sedere in decoctione sumach, et corticum granatorum, et gallarum, et similium.	If the flow of blood persiste: then let her sit in a decoction of myrrh, and castor oil, and gall, and similar things.
Deinde accipe farinam hordei, et confice eam cum melle et aceto, et fac emplastrum cum eo super dorsum eius.	Then take horse-grain flour and mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a plaster with it to put on his back.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis cum eo, bonum est: et si non, fac adhaerere dorso uentosas, et mammillis, absque scarificatione.	If therefore blood comes away with it, it is good: and if not, make the plasters adhere to the back with vinegar and milky wort, without scraping.
Deinde accipe lanam, et submerge in succo tarathit, aut succo arnoglossae, aut succo ramorum alaulat, id est, aglanter, uino pontico, et fac adhaerere loeo.	Then take wool, and soak it in taratrossic liquid, or in the juice of tongue-fish, or in the juice of willows with buds, that is, in glans, red wine, and make it adhere to the loins.
Cum ergo quiescit apostema, tunc cura locum cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	When therefore the swelling has settled, then take care of the place with ointment, until it is healed.
Albarth uero rubeum est simile capitibus alhaasse, et est asperi aspectus.	Alberth, indeed, is very similar to a red head-band, and has a rough appearance.
Oportet ergo ut incidas quod apparet ex eo, secundum quod dixi in thelil aequaliter: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Therefore you should know that it appears even from it, according to what I said in the book of equal appearance: and take care of it, until it is healed.
¶ De perforatione Exiturae quae accidit in matrice.	De perforatione Exiturae, which happens in the mother's womb.
Caput LXXIIII.	Chapter LXXIV.
Accidunt in matrice species multae apostematum, sicut cancer, et apostema lapideum, et ulcera, et adubelati, et alekilati, id est, herpes, aestiomemus, et fistulae, et hemorroides, et ragadiae, et thelil, et apostema calidum.	There are various swelling in the womb, such as cancer, and a stone swelling, and sores, and blisters, and scabs, and scabs, that is, herpes, colic, and fistulas, and hemorrhoids, and rags, and little holes, and swellings.
Et ego quidem iam dixi omnes has aegritudines et species earum, et signa ipsarum, et earum curationes in diuisione: necesse est ut dicam in hoc tractatu apostema calidum quod accidit in matrice, quando est ex apostematibus quae colligunt saniem, et uis scire qualiter fit eius apertio cum ferro.	And I have already spoken about all these diseases and their species, and the signs of them, and their cures, in a division: it is necessary for me to speak in this book about the hot swelling which happens in the womb, when it is from swellings which gather blood, and that you may know how its opening is made with iron.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	Therefore you should know that you should reflect.
Tunc si dolor apostematis in incaeptione sua est acutus cum percussione sua, et flamma, et febre: et uides ipsum rubere: si cadit super ipsum sensus, tunc non properes cum perforatione eius: et cura ipsum cum eo eo quod iuuat super maturationem, donec quando quiescat acuitas accidentium.	When therefore the pain of the swelling in its beginning is acute with its percussion, and flame, and fever: and you see it red: if it falls on it, then you do not agree with its perforation: and take care of it with him as long as he enjoys his maturity, until when it has settled its acuteness.
Tunc oportet ut facias sedere mulierem super sedem quae labeat duo sedilia, et reclinetur, uel appodietur super dorsum suum, et aggreget pedes suos ad partem inferiorem uentris: et sint coxae eius expansae, et ponat brachia sua sub genibus suis, et liget utraque ligamento conueniente ad illud.	Then it is necessary that you make the woman sit on a seat that has two seats, and lean back, or lie down on her back, and gather her feet towards the lower part of the thigh: and let her hips be expanded, and place her arms under her knees, and tie both with a suitable ligature to it.
Deinde sedeat obstetrix a latere dextro, et administra instrumentum quo aperitur orificium matricis.	Then the midwife should sit on the right-hand side of the woman, and administer the tool with which the opening of the womb is opened.
Cuius forma uenit in eis quae sunt post.	Whose shape comes in these that are behind.
Et oportet quando uis administrare hoc instrumentum, ut figas cum Radio profundum matricis mulieris: ut non sit illud quod ingreditur ex instrumento plus, quam profundum matricis, et laedat infirmam.	And it is necessary that when you administer this tool, you hold the ring of the womb deeply: so that the blood does not enter from the instrument more than the depth of the womb, and does not harm the sick.
Si autem fuerit instrumentum magis quam profundum, tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos super tecturam profundi matricis: ut prohibeatur introitus instrumenti totius in profundum matricis: et oportet ut ponat uertiginem, quae currit in instrumento, ex latere superiore: et ut teneat instrumentum, et ut reuoluat minister uertiginem, donec aperiatur profundum matricis.	If the tool is more than the depth, then it is necessary that you put down feathers over the depth of the womb: to prevent the entry of the whole tool into the depth of the womb: and it is necessary that you put a spin on it, which runs in the tool from the top side: and hold the tool, and turn the wheel, until the depth of the womb opens.
Cum ergo apparet Exitura, et tangitur manu, et est lenis et mollis: tunc oportet ut seces ipsam apud caput suum cum spatumili lato.	When it appears that it is coming out, and touches it with the hand, and is soft and smooth: then you should separate it from its head with a smooth edge.
Cum ergo euacuatur sanies, tunc oportet ut ponas in uulnus licinium submersum in oleo rosaceo: aut oleo uiridi, in quo sit quaedam stipticitas: et pone licinium, et extrahe sectionem in profundo matricis.	When the lochia is discharged, then you should put in a ring of iron immersed in rose oil: or in viride oil, in which there is some constriction: and put the ring, and take out a section into the depth of the womb.
Et pone exterius super matricem, et super pectinem lanam mundam submersam in aqua, in qua bullitae sunt maluae.	And put outside on the womb, and on the wool cloth clean immersed in water, in which there are boiled yolks.
Deinde curetur post duos dies cum unguento quod conuenit ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then take care after two days with an ointment that suits it, until it heals.
Et quandoque abluitur matrix et uulnus, ita quod clisterizatur cum aqua et melle: deinde cum aqua in qua bullita est radix lilii, aut aristolochia longa: deinde redeat ad unguentum.	And when the womb is washed and the string, so that it is clusted with water and honey: then take a bath with water in which there is boiled radish root and long aristan: then return to the ointment.
Quod si uulnus absconditum fuerit interius in matrice, tunc oportet ut prohibearis ex curatione eius cum ferro, imo cura ipsum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione.	If the bone is hidden within the womb, then one should prevent its cure with iron, indeed care for it itself as we have said in the division.
¶ Doctrinae Obstetricum, qualiter medicentur embriones uiui, secundum figuram non naturalem egressi.	The teaching of obstetrics, how they should treat the womb according to the shape of an abnormal exit.
Caput Lxxu.	Chapter LXVII.
Necesse est Obstetrici, ut cognoscat in primis figuram partus naturalis.	It is necessary for the obstetrician to know first of all the figure of a natural birth.
Ex signis ergo eius est, quod quando uides mulierem comprimi ad inferiora, et desiderat odorare aerem, et alleuiatur super eam quod super ipsam est de partu, et festinat exitus embrionis: tunc scias quod iste partus est secundum figuram naturalem, et est exitus eius super caput suum, et secundina cum eo: aut suspensa, uel pendens ex umbilico.	From the signs then, you shall know when you see a woman compressing herself towards her lower parts, and yearns to smell air, and feels relief on her when there is birth of the child, and hurried exit of the child: then you shall know that this birth is according to the natural figure, and it is an exit from her head, and second with her: or suspended, or hanging from her navel.
Cum ergo uides haec signa, tunc oportet ut comprimatur uenter eius, ut descendat embrio uelociter.	When then you see these signs, then it is necessary that the womb of her compress, so that the embryo descends quickly.
Nam quando descendit super caput suum, descendit secundina cum eo, et mundatur ex illis superfluitatibus mundificatione bona.	For when it has descended on her head, it has descended with her, and is washed out from it with good purgation.
Qui autem est praeter hunc partum, est innaturalis, illaudabilis.	Whoever is beyond this birth, is unnatural, unwholesome.
Quoniam quandoque egreditur foetus super pedes suos, et egreditur corpus eius ante caput ipsius, et pedes eius, et manus eius una, aut pes eius unus: aut egreditur caput eius et manus eius: aut egreditur uentrinus: et fortasse conuertitur super collum suum, et similia ex figuris illaudabilibus.	For when the child ever exits on his feet, and the body of it goes out before the head of it, and its feet and hands one, or its foot and hand one: or the head of it and its hands go out: or the navel and the back: and perhaps turns over its neck, and similar figures that are unwholesome.
Necesse est ergo Obstetrici, ut sit prudens, subtilis in istis rebus omnibus, et caueat sibi ab errore et decaeptione: et ego sum ostendens omnem figuram ex eis, et qualiter est ingenium in ea, et significetur per illud, et stetur super ipsum.	Therefore it is necessary for the obstetrician to be prudent, subtle in all these things, and guard himself from error and delusion: and I am showing you every figure out of them, and how it works in it, and signifies by it, and makes a stir on it.
Quando egreditur foetus super caput suum egressione sua naturali, et uehemens fit illud super mulierem, et difficilis fit ei partus, et uides uirtutem eius iam debilitatam: tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, aut mulieres teneant eam: et uapora uuluam eius cum foenugraeco decocto, et cum oleis humidis.	When the child exits on its own natural head, and becomes heavy on the woman, and has difficult birth, and you see her virtue already weakened: then make her sit on a chair, or have women support her: and pour onto her foenugraeco decotion, and with wet oils.
Deinde intromittat Obstetrix inter digitos suos Spatumile paruum, et findat cum eo secundinam, et secet eam ungue suo, donec currat quod est in ea ex humiditate: et preme uentrem mulieris, donec descendat foetus.	Then the Obstetrix shall put her finger between her toes with a small spatula, and find out with it the second time, and wipe it with her nail until she has run out of it what is in her from moisture: and press the womb of the woman until the baby comes down.
Si autem non descendit, tunc oportet ut clisterizetur mulier ex mucillagine foenugraeci, cum oleo sisamino.	But if [the baby] does not come down, then it is necessary that the woman be clotted with foenugraecum mucus with siseamin oil.
Deinde praecipe ei post clistere, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi, et tene os eius et nasum ipsius hora una.	Then you shall order her after the [clotting] to compress: and make her sneeze with a mixture, and hold her nose and mouth for an hour.
Foetus enim egredietur statim.	For the baby will come out right away.
Quod si egrediantur duae manus foetus in primis, iunc oportet ut reducas eas cum facilitate paulatim.	What if two hands of the baby come out first, it is necessary that you reduce them with ease gradually.
Si autem non obedit in introitu, tunc pone mulierem super sedem, et eleua pedes eius sursum: deinde concute sedem super terram: et mulier teneatur, ut non cadat apud concussionem.	But if it does not obey in the entrance, then put the woman on a chair, and lift her feet up: then turn the chair over the ground: and let the woman hold on to it so that she does not fall by the jolt.
Si ergo non egrediuntur manus, et moritur foetus: tunc incide eas, et extrahe residuum foetus: et liga manum eius cum panno, et extrahe ipsum cum aequalitate: nam ipse egredietur.	But if the hands do not come out, and the baby dies: then cut them open, and take out the remainder of the baby: and tie her hand with a cloth, and pull it out with equality: for she will come out.
¶ Exitus embrionis super pedes suo.	The exit of the embryo under its own feet.
Quando egreditur foetus super pedes suos, tunc oportet ut impellat eos sursum: deinde conuertat foetum paulatim: postea aequet ipsum.	When the baby comes out under its own feet, then it is necessary that you push them up: then turn the baby little by little: and then make it even.
Deinde accipiat unum pedum eius, et extendat eum paulatim.	Then take one of her feet, and stretch it out little by little.
Cum ergo egrediuntur usque ad coxas, tunc praecipe ei, ut comprimatur, et fac eam sternutare cum condisi: egredietur enim, si Deus uoluerit.	But when they have come out as far as the hips, then order her to compress, and make her sneeze with a mixture: for she will come out if God wills it.
Et si non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc reduc foetum paulatim, donec ponas eum secundum figuram naturalem.	And if he does not come out with what we have said above, then reduce the baby little by little, until you set it in the shape of nature again.
Nam ipse egredietur tunc egressu facili.	For he will come out then with an easy exit.
Quod si prohibeatur cum eo toto quod narrauimus: tunc accipe ex mucillagine alteae, et oleo sisamino, et gummi soluto: et percute totum in mortario percussione bona: deinde line cum eo uuluam mulieris, et inferius uentris eius.	If it is forbidden to tell the whole story: then take from the mucilaginous aloes, and oil of sesamum, and a liquid gum; and crush them all together in a mortar with good crushing; then put it on with the hand of a woman, and apply it to her lower abdomen.
Deinde fac eam sedere in aqua tepida, donec consequatur hypocundria.	Then let her sit in warm water until she has a hypogastric swelling.
Cum ergo uides quod iam calefacta sunt inferiora eius, tunc fac ei sief de myrrha: et suppone ipsum.	When you see that her lower parts are now warmed, then put on her some myrrh: and let her lie down.
Quando ergo tenet sief hora una, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	When she has held the myrrh for an hour, then let her sit on a seat.
Deinde fac eam sternutare: et stringe ipsius os et nasum: et preme inferiorem partem uentris compressione facili.	Then let her sneeze, and tighten her mouth and nose; and gently press her lower abdomen.
Nam foeus egredietur statim.	For the fire will come out immediately.
¶ Exitus foetus super genua et manus.	Exit the fetus on to the knees and hands.
Quando egreditur secundum hanc formam, tunc ingeniet in intromittendo manus suas paulatim.	When it comes out in this form, then she will find by gradual penetration of her hands.
Deinde resupinetur mulier super collum suum, et pendeant pedes eius ad inferiora: et ipsa sit iacens super lectum, et complicet manus suas.	Then the woman shall lie on her neck, and let her feet hang down to the lower part; and she herself shall lie on a bed, and cross her hands.
Deinde preme supra uentrem eius paulatim.	Then gently press upon her belly.
Deinde extrahe quod est sub pedibus eius ex puluinaribus, donec sit praeparata in inferiori parte.	Then pull out what is under her feet from the pubic region, until she is prepared in the lower part.
Quod si non egreditur foetus, tunc accipe pedes eius, et moue eos motu uehementi.	If the fetus does not come out, then take her feet, and move them vigorously.
Deinde preme quod est supra hypocundria paulatim, donec ascendat foetus ad superiora.	Then gently press what is above the hypogastric swelling, until the fetus rises to the upper parts.
Deinde intromittat manus suas, et aequet foetum paulatim: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimatur, donec egrediatur foetus.	Then let her insert her hands, and make the fetus even smaller; and order the woman to compress, until the fetus comes out.
¶ Exitus foetus latitudinaliter pendens ex manibus.	The exit of the fetus hanging down from the hands.
Ingenietur in reductione manus eius.	Let her find by reducing her hands.
Si autem non potest reducere eam, tunc eleua mulierem, et fac eam ambulare.	If she cannot reduce herself, then pour oil on the woman, and let her walk.
Si uero ambulare non potest, tunc fac eam iacere super lectum: et concute crura eius concussione uehementi.	But if walking is not possible, then let her lie on a bed: and roughly shake her legs.
Deinde administra linimentum quod praeparasti ex mucillaginibus.	Then apply the liniment you have prepared from mucus.
Quod si accipit eam partus, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	If he takes it in, then make him sit on a chair.
Deinde stude in reductione manus, et aequa foetum secundum figuram naturalem: et fac sternutare mulierem, et praecipe ei, ut comprimat se, donec egrediatur.	Then study the reduction of the hand, and bring it into its natural position; and have the woman sneeze, and order her to compress herself until she has gone out.
¶ Exitus foetus super collum suum, expansis manibus, et est facies eius ad dorsum matris suae.	The exit of the fetus over its neck, with open arms, and it is turned toward the back of its mother.
Oportet ut teneat Obstetrix manum foetus, deinde reuoluat eum paulatim, et aequet eum cum facilitate.	It is necessary that the midwife hold the fetus's hand, then rotate it gradually, and make it easier with ease.
Cum ergo aequatur, tunc pone super uuluam eius quod narrauimus ex oleo et mucillaginibus.	When he is thus balanced, then place on his navel that which we have spoken of from oil and mucus.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut moueatur paulatim.	Then order him to move his arms slowly.
Cum ergo feceris illud, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, et praecipe ei ut inclinetur ad latus dextrum.	When you have done that, then make her sit on a chair, and order her to lean on the right side.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi.	Then order her to compress herself: and make her sneeze with a medicine.
¶ Exitus foetus praeparati super latus.	The prepared exit of the fetus on the side.
Quando descendit ad orificium matricis secundum hunc modum cum secundina, tunc scinde secundinam cum ungue tuo, donec euacuetur ex humiditate.	When it descended to the opening of the mother after this way with the second, then cut the second with your nail, until it is discharged from humidity.
Si ergo suspenditur super faciem foetus, et collum eius, tunc incide eam ex umbilico: ut non retineatur, et moriatur.	If he is suspended over the face of the fetus and his neck, then cut him from the navel: lest he should retain it, and die.
Deinde impelle foetum ad interiora, donec ponas eam secundum quod oportet: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimat se aliquotiens: ipse enim egredietur exitu leui.	Then push the fetus into the insides, until you have placed it according to what is necessary: and order the woman to compress herself sometimes; for he himself will come out by way of the outlet.
¶ Exitus Geminorum, aut foetuum multorum.	The exit of twins, or a fetus of many members.
Scias, quod Gemini multotiens nascuntur: et quandoque nascuntur tres, et quatuor.	You should know that the twins often give birth; and when they are born three, and sometimes four.
Verumtamen illud extraneum est, et raro contingit.	However, that is uncommon, and seldom happens.
Quinque uero est res extra naturam, et non uiuunt penitus: et continet eos, quamuis multiplicentur, secundina una: et separantur per sifach, distinguens inter eos ligatum in umbilico cuiusque eorum.	However, five is a thing outside nature, and do not live together: and it holds them, although they multiply, second to one; and separates them by means of a knot, distinguishing between them the ligated one at the navel of each of them.
Et quandoque egrediuntur sicut egreditur foetus unus exitu naturali, facili: et egrediuntur exitu illaudabili, sicut narrauimus.	And sometimes they go out like a fetus going out naturally, easily; and they go out from that door, as we have told.
Quod si difficiles fuerint quidam eorum apud partum, et perueniunt ad illud quod diximus ex figuris innaturalibus, tunc cura eos sicut narrauimus: et sit ob stetrix subtilis, et faciat quod facit cum facilitate et tarditate, et ingenietur secundum omnem figuram cum eo quod praeparatur ei ex ingenio ducente ad salutem.	That if some of them are difficult at the time of delivery, and they go to that which we have said from the figures of the innatural, then take care of them as we have told: and let there be a soft woman, and let her do what she does with ease and slowness, and get used to it according to all the figure with him who is prepared by his leading to health.
¶ Rememoratio eius quod formatur in matrice ex embrionibus, et abortiuntur.	The reminder that he is formed in the womb from embryos, and they are aborted.
Quandoque formatur in matrice unus, et duo, et tres, et quatuor, et quinque, et sex, et septem, et plures decem: et iam uerificatum est apud me, quod mulier abortiendo emisit septem, et alia quindecim, omnes formatos.	When one, and two, and three, and four, and five, and six, and seven, and more ten are formed in the womb: and it has already been proven with me that a woman has emitted seven, and another fifteen, all formed.
Quod factum est mensuratione gloriosi sapientis.	That which is done by the measurement of the glorious sage.
Hoc ergo totum oportet ut sit in scientia Obstetricis.	This then is everything that it should be in the science of Obstetrics.
Fortasse enim perueniet ad eam simile illius: opponat ergo ei cum illo quod oportet	Perhaps, indeed, it will come to that which is similar to that: so oppose him with that which is necessary
¶ De extractione foetus mortui.	关于提取死亡的胎儿。
Caput LXXVI.	Chapter LVII. On the extraction of a dead fetus.
Quando curas foetum mortuum cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex medicatione, et non egreditur, et cogeris uti operatione cum manu, tunc oportet ut consideres.	When you take care of the dead fetus with what I have said in the division of surgery, and it does not come out, and you force to use the operation with the hand, then you must consider.
Si ergo mulier est sanae uirtutis, et non est cum aliquo ex accidentibus, ex quibus timetur super eam perditio: tunc oportet ut resupinetur mulier super lectum, super dorsum suum, et sit caput eius inclinatum inferius, et crura eius eleuata: et ministra teneat eam a duabus partibus, aut ligetur ad lectum, ut non extrahatur corpus eius apud extractionem foetus.	If, then, the woman is of good virtue, and she is not with any of the accidents from which she fears harm: then it should be that the woman lies down on a bed, on her back, and her head is inclined downward, and her legs are raised up: and she should be held by two people, or tied to the bed, so that her body is not extracted along with the extraction of the fetus.
Deinde humecta os matricis ex oleis humidis cum mucillagine alteae, et foenugraeci, et seminis lini.	Then moisten the womb of the mother with oil wet with alum, and fenugreek, and linseed.
Deinde inungat Obstetrix manum suam cum istis oleis et mucillaginibus: deinde intromittat eam in matricem cum facilitate.	Then the Obstetrix shall wash her hands with these oils and mucus; then she shall insert herself into the womb with ease.
Deinde quaerat cum ea locum in quo figat uncinos ex foetu, et loca conuenientia ad illud.	Then she shall inquire about the place where she should fix the hook from the fetus, and the places convenient for that.
Considera ergo tunc, si foetus est praeparatus ut descendat super caput suum: tunc fige uncinos in oculos eius, aut in collo eius, aut in ore eius, aut in palato ipsius, aut sub barba eius, aut in furcula ipsius, aut in locis propinquis costis, et sub hypocundriis.	Consider therefore then, if the fetus is ready to come down on his own: then fix the hooks in his eyes, or in his neck, or in his mouth, or in his palate, or under his beard, or in his chin, or in his hip bones, and in nearby places; and under his loin cloth.
Si autem descensus est super pedes eius, tunc in pectine, et costis eius mediis.	But if the descent is on his feet then, in the midriff, and in his ribs.
Et oportet, ut teneat uncinum cum manu dextra: et ponat curuitatem eius in eo quod est inter digitos sinistrae manus: et intromittat cum manu cum facilitate, et figat uncinum in aliquo illorum locorum quae diximus, donec perueniat ad rem uacuam.	And it is necessary that she hold the hook with her right hand; and put the hook in her when she extends her left hand; and insert herself with ease, and fix the hook in one of those places we have said, until she has finished the job.
Deinde figat in oppositione eius uncinum alium, aut tertium, si indiges: ut sit contractio aequalis, et non declinet ad partem.	Then she shall fix in opposition to her another hook, or a third one, if it endures: so that there is an equal tension, and does not decline to one side.
Deinde extendatur extensione aequali, et non sit extensio secundum rectitudinem tantum, imo moueatur ad omnem partem, ut alleuietur exitus eius: sicut fit cum dente apud eradicationem eius.	Then she shall be extended with an equal extension, and not be extended only according to the straightness, but let herself move on all sides, so that the exit is relieved: as happens when a tooth is being extracted.
Et oportet in eo quod est inter illud, ut mollificetur extensio.	And it is necessary in that which is between that, so that the extension is softened.
Quod si retineatur ex eo pars, tunc oportet ut inungat Obstetrix quosdam digitos cum oleo, et intromittat eos ex parte, ut reuoluat cum eis quod retinetur.	That if a part of it is retained then, it is necessary that the Obstetrix should wash some fingers with oil, and insert them from one side, so that they turn with them who retain it.
Si ergo egreditur pars foetus, tunc permutentur uncini ad locum alium qui sit altior: fac hoc donec egrediatur foetus totus.	But if a part of the fetus comes out then, the hooks shall be exchanged to a higher place: do this until the entire fetus has come out.
Si ergo egreditur manus ante alia, et non est possibile reducere eam, propter coartationem eius: tunc oportet, ut inuoluatur super eam pannus.	But if a hand comes out before the other one, and it cannot be reduced by its contraction: then it is necessary that a cloth be wrapped around it.
Deinde extrahe eam donec quando egreditur tota, incide eam aut in iunctura plantae, aut in cubito: et ita oportet ut facias in manu altera, et in duobus pedibus.	Then extract it until it is all out, and cut it or at the joint of the plant, or on the knee: and so it is necessary that you do in one hand, and in two feet.
Si autem caput foetus est magnum, aut accidit ei coartatio in exitu, aut est in capite eius aqua aggregata: tunc oportet ut intromittat inter digitos Spatumile spinosum, et findat cum eo caput, et extrahat aquam: aut disrumpat ipsum cum instrumento quod nominatur Almisdac: cuius forma uenit cum formis reliquorum instrumentorum in capitulo quod est post hoc.	But if the head of the fetus is large, or has happened to him constriction during delivery, or there is water in his head: then he should put between the fingers a sharp spittle, and find with it the head, and extract the water: or he should tear off himself with the instrument which is called Almisdac: whose shape came with the forms of the other instruments in the chapter which follows.
Similiter faciat si foetus est magni capitis natura, tunc oportet ut seces algengematu: aut extrahas ipsum cum misdach, sicut diximus.	Similarly, if the nature of the fetus is of a large head, then he should extract it with the almisdac as we have said above.
Deinde attrahas ossa cum forcipibus.	Then pull out the bones with forceps.
Quod si egrediatur caput, et coartetur apud furculam: tunc findatur, donec effundatur humiditas quae est in pectore.	If he emerges head first and is constricted at the fork: then find out, until the water which is in the chest is drained.
Si autem non complicatur, neque obedit ad exitum: tunc incide caput frustatim, secundum quod possibile est tibi.	But if it is not complicated, and does not submit to the delivery: then cut off the head abruptly, according to what is possible for you.
Quod si inferius uentris est apostematum, aut est in eo hydropisis: tunc oportet ut perfores ipsum, donec currat humiditas ex eo.	If the lower part of the leg is swollen, or there is water in it: then you should make an incision, until the water runs out.
Si uero foetus est super pedes suos, tunc attractio eius est facilis, et directio eius ad os matricis est leuis.	But if the fetus is above his own feet, then his attraction is easy, and his direction towards the mother's mouth is easy.
Si autem coartatur apud uentrem, aut pectus: tunc oportet ut extrahas ipsum cum panno quem inuoluisti super manum tuam: et findat uentrem, aut pectus, donec currat quod est in eis.	But if he is constricted at the throat or chest: then he should extract him with a cloth which you have wound around your hand: and find out the throat or chest, until what is in them runs out.
Si autem auferuntur reliqua membra, et redit caput: tunc intromittat Obstetrix manum sinistram.	But if other limbs are taken away, and only the head remains: then the midwife should put her left hand.
Si ergo os matricis est apertum, tunc intromittat manum in profundum matricis, et quaerat cum ea caput, et attrahat ipsum cum digitis usque ad os matricis: deinde intromittat in eo uncinum unum, aut uncinos duos, et attrahat ipsum cum eo.	But if the mother's mouth is open, then he should put his hand into the depth of the mouth, and seek with it the head, and pull it out with fingers until it reaches the mouth: then he should put in one or two hooks, and pull him out with them.
Quod si os matricis coartatur, propter apostema calidum quod accidit ei: tunc non oportet ut laboretur super ipsum, imo oportet tunc administrare effusionem rerum humidarum, pinguium: et administra emplastra: et sedeat in aquis quae mollificant et humectant.	If the mouth of the mother is cut off, because of the swelling that has occurred to him: then it is not appropriate for him to work on himself, but it is necessary at that time to administer an infusion of liquid, thick: and to administer a plaster; and to sit in water which softens and moistens.
Quod si foetus est super latus suum, tunc possibile est ut aequetur: tunc administretur quod diximus in foetu uiuo.	If the fetus is on his side, then it is possible that it will be even: then it should be administered what we have said about the single fetus.
Quod si non est possibile illud, tunc incidatur frustatim, et extrahatur.	If this is not possible, then he should be cut short, and taken out.
Et oportet ut non dimittas aliquid ex secundina intus omnino.	And it is necessary that you do not leave anything at all from the second inside.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc administra quod diximus in apostematibus calidis quae accidunt in matricibus.	But when you have finished your operation, then administer what we have said about hot swellings that occur in the wombs.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc descendat in aquis stipticis, et administra reliquam curationem.	If blood flow occurs, then let him go down into the water of stigma, and administer the remaining cure.
Et ego quidem iam uidi mulierem, in cuius uentre mortuus erat foetus: deinde impregnata est super ipsum uice alia, postea mortuus est foetus alius etiam.	And I myself have already seen a woman, in whose womb a dead fetus was: and then she was impregnated on top of another force, and then another dead fetus also came out.
Accidit ergo ei post tempus longum apostema in umbilico suo, et inflatum est, donec apertum est: et coepit emittere pus.	Then he happened to him after a long time of swelling in his navel, and it was swollen, until it opened up: and it began to emit pus.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius, et medicatus sum ei tempore longo: et non consolidatum est uulnus.	So I was called to his cure, and I treated him for a long time: but the wound did not heal.
Posui ergo super ipsum ex quibusdam emplastris fortis attractionis: et exiuit ex loco os.	So I put on top of it some strong plasters of attraction: and he came out from the place of the mouth.
Deinde praeterierunt ei dies aliquot, et exiuit os aliud.	Then passed a few days for him, and came out another mouth.
Miratus sum ergo inde, cum in uentre non sit os.	So I was amazed from there, because there is no mouth in the belly.
Cogitaui ergo, quia erant ex ossibus foetus mortui.	So I thought, because there were bones of a dead fetus.
Inquisiui ergo uulnus, et extraxi ossa multa, muliere existente in melioribus dispositionibus suis: et iam uixit taliter tempore longo, et mittit ex loco pus parum.	So I questioned the wound, and took out many bones, with a woman who was in better condition than herself: and now he no longer lived for so long a time, and sent out from the place a little pus.
Et ego non firmaui hic hoc extraneum, nisi quoniam in eo est scientia, et adiutorium ad illud, quod administrat medicus artifex cum manu ex curatione.	And I do not hold this to be strange, unless there is in it a science, and an aid for it, which the skilled physician administers with his hand in the cure.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum necessariorum in extractione foetus.	The forms of instruments necessary for extracting a fetus.
Caput LXXVII.	Chapt. XXXVII. Of the instruments necessary for taking out a foetus
Hic inferius est forma Strictorii, quo aequantur libri, cui aequaliter sunt duae uertigines in duabus extremitatibus duorum lignorum.	Here is the form of the scissor, which are equal to the books, and have two tangs at each end of two pieces of wood.
Verumtamen haec Vertigo oportet ut sit subtilior strictorio: et ut fiat, aut ex ebano, aut ex ligno bussi.	But this scissor should be made smaller than the strector; and to make it so, let it be made either of ebony or of bushe-wood.
Et sit latitudo omnis ligni quasi duo digiti: et margo cuiusque amborum est quasi digitus unus, et longitudo cuiusque eorum est palmus et medietas: et in medio duorum lignorum sunt duo additamenta ex genere eiusdem ligni, quae iam firmata sunt in utrisque, quorum longitudo est medietas palmi et plus parum: et latitudo utriusque est quasi duo digiti, aut plus parum.	And the width of each piece of wood should be about two fingers; and the length of each should be a palm and a half, and less than that in the middle; and there are added to each of the two pieces of wood, which are already fastened together, two bits of the same wood, the length of which is a half-palm and a little more; and the width of either is about two fingers, or somewhat less.
Et ista duo additamenta intromittuntur in os matricis, ut aperiatur cum eis quando tu reuoluis duas Vertigines.	And these two bits are to be inserted into the mouth of the womb, so that it may open when you turn the two scissors.
Forma Vertiginis qua aperitur matrix.	Form of the scissor which opens the womb.
Forma alia ad simile illius, subtilior, et leuior.	Form of another like that, but smaller and lighter.
Fiat ex ligno ebani, aut bussi, secundum similitudinem forcipum.	Let it be made of ebony-wood or of bushe-wood, according to the similarity of the forceps.
Verumtamen in extremitate eius sint duo additamenta, sicut uides hic supra: et longitudo omnis additamenti ex eis est quasi palmus: et latitudo utriusque est, duo digiti.	But at the end there should be two bits, as you see here above; and the length of each bit should be a palm; and the width of either should be about two fingers.
Cum ergo uis aperire matricem cum eo, tunc fac sedere mulierem super lectum, pendentibus pedibus eius, aperto quod est inter crura eius.	When you go to open the womb with it, then make the woman sit on the bed, hanging her feet from the side; and
Deinde intromitte ista duo additamenta coniuncta in matricem: et tu es tenens extremitatem instrumenti inferius inter coxas eius.	Then insert these two bits joined together into the womb; and you shall hold the lower end of the instrument between her thighs.
Deinde aperi manum tuam cum instrumento, sicut facis cum forficibus, aequaliter secundum quantitatem quam uis ex apertione oris matricis, donec faciat Obstetrix quod uult.	Then open your hand with the instrument, as you do with the forceps, equally according to the quantity that you wish to extract from the opening of the womb; until such time as the midwife does as she pleases.
Forma Vertiginis alterius quam dixerunt antiqui Forma Impellentis quo impellitur foetus.	Form of the other scissor than those mentioned by the ancient authors, which drives out the fetus.
Forma Almisdac, qua conteritur caput magnum: et assimilatur forcipi, cui sunt dentes in extremitate, sicut uides.	Form the head of the giant: and it is similar to the claw, which has teeth at the end, as you see.
Et quandoque fit oblungum, sicut forcipes secundum hanc formam, sicut uides, cui sunt dentes sicut dentes serrae, quo inciditur et conteritur.	And sometimes it is made round, like a claw according to this form, as you see, which has teeth like the teeth of a saw, so that it cuts and compresses when it is struck and compressed.
Forma Almisdac quo conteritur caput paruum.	Form the head of a child: and it is similar to the claw, which has teeth at the end, as you see.
Forma Vncini habentis spinam unam.	Form the hand that holds one nail.
Forma Vncini habentis spinas duas.	Form the hand that holds two nails.
Forma forcipis cui sunt dentes serrae, cum quo conteritur caput foetus.	Form the claw which has saw-teeth: with which the head of a fetus is crushed.
Forma Spatumilis habentis duas extremitates ad abscindendum caput.	Form the blade that has two ends for cutting the head.
Forma duorum Spatumilium etiam latorum.	Form the two blades that also support.
Ista instrumenta omnia exercentur, et quanto plus multiplicantur species eorum, et praeparata sunt apud artificem, est uelocior ad operationem suam, et altior apud homines, propter quantitatem suam.	These instruments are all used, and the more their kinds multiply and are prepared for use by the artisan, the faster they carry out their work, and the higher among people due to their quantity.
Non ergo despicies ex eis instrumentum, quin sit apud te praeparatum.	Therefore do not despise these instruments, although they are found to be prepared by you.
Inexcusabilis est enim necessitas eorum.	It is inevitable that they are needed.
¶ De extractione Secundinae.	On the Extraction of the Second Book.
Caput LXXVIII.	Head 78.
Quando retinetur Secundina apud partum, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmae, ut retineat anhelitum suum.	When the second book is held at birth, then you should take away the weak ones, so that it holds its breath.
Deinde fac eam sternutare cum condisi: et stringe manum tuam super os eius, et nares ipsius.	Then make her sneeze with a handkerchief: and tightly hold your hand over her nose, and the nostrils of it.
Si ergo egreditur per hoc, bonum est.	If then she exits through this, it is good.
Si non: tunc accipe ollam, et perfora in coopertorio foramen: et pone in ea herbas aperientes os matricis, sicut calamentum, rutam, et anetum, et camomillam, et sseham, et cassiam ligneam, et centauream: accipe omnes istas herbas, aut quasdam earum, et submerge eas cum aqua, et pone eas super ignem.	If not: then take a staff, and pierce in the cover a hole: and put in it herbs opening the mouth of the mother, such as calamus, rut, aneth, camomile, chamomile, and cinnamon, and let them all boil with water, and put them on fire.
Deinde pone embulam arundinis super foramen coopertorii ollae, et extremitatem aliam in os matricis: et teneat eam donec perueniat uapor ad concauitatem matricis.	Then place a wand of herbs on the hole of the vessel, and the other end in the mouth of the mother: and let her hold it until the vapor comes to meet the contraction of the mother's womb.
Deinde fac eam sternutare, sicut diximus.	Then make him sneeze, as we have said.
Secundina enim egredietur cum facilitate.	For a second time he will exit with ease.
Si autem remaneat post hanc curationem, et non egrediatur: tunc praecipe Obstetrici, ut submergat manum suam in oleo sisamino, aut mucillagine alteae.	But if, after this treatment, he remains and does not exit: then order the obstetrician to dip his hand in linseed oil or mucilage of althaea.
Deinde intromittat in uuluam, et quaerat cum ea Secundinam.	Then insert it into the vulva, and ask her if she feels a second time.
Cum ergo inuenerit eam, tunc accipiat eam, et extendat ipsam paulatim.	When he has found it, then take it, and stretch it out gradually.
Si autem fuerit annexa in profundo matricis, tunc intromittat manum, secundum quod narrauimus, donec quando inuenerit Secundinam, et extrahat eam paulatim secundum rectitudinem, ut non cadat matrix apud attractionem uehementem: imo oportet, ut permutetur cum facilitate ad latera dextra et sinistra: deinde addatur in quantitatem attractionis.	But if it is attached deep in the matrix, then insert your hand, according to what we have said, until, when it finds the second time, it gradually removes it straight, so that the matrix does not fall with a sudden pull: it should be turned, so as to alternate from one side to the other with ease: then, the amount of pull should be added.
Ipsa enim obedit tunc, et seruatur, et euadit ab adhaerentia.	It will then obey, and move away, and release itself from the adhesion.
Quod si os matricis est coartatum, sicut nos iam narrauimus: cura eam cum sternutatione, et ex medicatione ollae cum herbis.	If the mouth of the matrix is constricted, as we have already narrated: take care with the sneezing, and after the medicated oil with herbs.
Si autem non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc caue ne fatigeris super eam in iteratione extractionis.	But if it does not exit with all that we have said, then be careful not to tire yourself out with the extraction.
Verum oportet, ut quod egreditur ad os matricis ex ea, liges ad coxam mulieris.	But it is necessary that when it exits from the mouth of the matrix, there are some bindings on the woman's hips.
Deinde clisteriza eam cum unguento tetrapharmacon.	Then apply a ointment of four drugs to her.
Ipsum enim putrefaciet eam post dies, et dissoluetur, et egredietur.	For it will make her putrefy after a few days, and dissolve, and exit.
Verumtamen quando putrefit, eleuatur ex ea odor malus ad stomachum et caput, et laedit illud infirmam.	But when it putrefies, an offensive smell emerges from it to the stomach and head, and hurts that one with a bad smell.
Oportet ergo ut administrentur suffumigationes conuenientes ad illud.	It is then necessary that they administer suitable suffumigations to it.
Quidam autem antiquorum iam experti sunt suffumigationem nasturtii, et ficuum siccarum.	But some of the ancient ones who have already been experienced in suffumigations of mustard and dried fig are now.
Forma instrumenti quo suffumigatur mulier apud retentionem Secundinae et menstruorum.	The form of the instrument with which the woman is suffumed during retention of the second time and the flow of blood.
Fiat ex uitro simile alcama, aut ex zere: et ponatur extremitas ampla super ignem: et suffumigatio sit posita super prunas: teneat eam, donec consumatur illa suffumigatio: et itera aliam.	Let it be made from a similar raw material or from the hair: and let the end be placed widely over the fire; and let the smoke be placed above plums; hold it, until that smoke is consumed: and then another one.
¶ De curatione Ani non perforati.	Regarding the treatment of an untreated wound.
Caput LXXIX.	Chapter LXXXXIX.
Nascuntur multi puerorum, et Ani eorum sunt non perforati, quos iam opilauit sifac subtile.	Many boys were born, and the animals of their herd had already been infected by a subtle sifac.
Oportet ergo, ut obstetrix perforet illud sifac digito suo: et si non, perforet ipsum cum Spatumili acuto: et caueat lacertum, ne tangat eum.	It is necessary that the midwife pierce that sifac with her finger: and if not, she herself should pierce it with a sharp spatulium: and she should take care, so that the snake does not touch her.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam infusam in uino et oleo.	Then put over it wool soaked in wine and oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum ungentis, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the wound with ointment, until it heals.
Si autem times quod opiletur, tunc pone in foramine cannulam de plumbo diebus multis, et auferatur quando puer uult egerere.	If you think that it has been poisoned, then put a lead tube in the hole for several days, and let it be removed when the boy wants to defecate.
Et iam accidit opilatio Ani etiam ex consolidatione uulneris, aut apostematis.	And also happened poisoning of the animals from the congestion of the wound or from pustules.
Oportet ergo ut secetur illa consolidatio, deinde curetur cum eo quod diximus ex curatione et plumbo.	It is necessary that that congestion be removed, and then it is to be treated with what we have said regarding the treatment from the corruption and lead.
¶ De curatione Fistularum quae accidunt in inferiori parte.	Regarding the treatment of fistulas which occur in the lower part.
Caput LXXX.	Chapter LXXX.
Fistulae quae accidunt in inferiori, sunt Nodatio, et Grossitudo quae accidunt prope anum deforis: aut in spacio unius partium: et est Fistula una, aut plures.	Fistulas which occur in the lower part are a nodulation, and grossness which occurs near the anus of the rectum: or in the space of one part: and it is a fistula, or several.
Cum ergo antiquatur illa Nodatio, aperitur, et currit ex ea humiditas aquosa alba, aut pus subtile.	When therefore that nodulation becomes constricted, it opens, and runs out from it moisture like water, white, or pus.
Et quandoque sunt ex istis Fistulis penetrantes.	And when they are from these fistulas, penetrating through.
Ergo penetrantes cognoscuntur per illud quod egreditur ex egestione, et uentositate, quando utitur infirmus egestione: et fortasse egreditur ex eis uermis.	Therefore those that penetrate are recognized by the thing which is excreted from defecation, and air-tightness, when a sick person uses the toilet: and perhaps it is excreted from them naked.
Et sunt ex eis Fistulae quando sunt in spacio penetrantes usque ad uesicam, et usque ad meatum uirgae.	And there are fistulas which penetrate into the space up to the skin, and up to the muscle of the groin.
Et sunt ex eis penetrantes usque ad iuncturam coxae, et usque ad nodum caudae.	And they are those that penetrate all the way to the hip joint, and up to the tail of the spine.
Ex eo autem quo cognoscitur Fistula penetrans usque ad anum, etiam a non penetrante, est, ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum: et intromittas tentam subtilem in Fistulam ex aere, aut ferro: quando non est tortuositas.	But from that which is known The penetrating fistula up to the anus, and also from that which does not penetrate, that is, when you insert your index finger into the anus: and insert a fine needle into the fistula made of brass or iron: when there is no curliness.
Quod si in ea est tortuositas, tunc intromitte in eam tentam ex plumbo subtilem, aut pilum ex pilis equarum, donec sentias tentam, aut pilum in digito tuo.	If there is a curliness in it, then insert into it a fine needle or a shaft from the feathers of an eagle, until you feel the touch of the needle or the shaft on your finger: or a small nail in your finger.
Quod si non sentis ipsam penitus, neque procedit ex foramine aliquid ex egestione, neque uentositas, neque uermis sicut dixi: tunc scias, quia est non penetrans: propera ergo ad curationem.	If you do not feel it keenly, and there does not proceed from the opening any discharge, nor is it as I said, dry or scaly: then you will know that it is not a penetrating one: so turn your attention to the cure.
Et quando Fistula est penetrans usque ad uesicam, aut ad meatum urinae: tunc significatio eius est exitus urinae ex ea, et prohibitio eius ab hoc ut consolidetur locus cum medicinis.	And when the fistula is penetrating all the way to the skin, or up to the edge of the bladder: then the meaning of it is the emission of urine from it, and its prohibition from this so that the place heals with medicines.
Si uero est penetrans usque ad iuncturam coxae, aut ad os coxae: tunc signum eius est, quod perueniat tenta usque illuc, si non est in ea tortuositas usque ad os: et inuentio doloris in circumitu partis, et quod egreditur pus ex ea semper: et quod non ualeat in ea medicatio, neque consolidatur cum unguento.	But if it is penetrating all the way to the hip joint, or up to the edge of the socket: then the sign of it is that the needle penetrates as far as there, if there is no curliness all the way to the socket: and the finding of pain in the surrounding part, and that pus is always discharged from it: and that it does not scab over with ointment, nor heal with a scabs.
Et in istis Fistulis omnibus penetrantibus non est curatio omnino: et curatio earum est labor et uanitas ei, ex stultis medicis, super quem formatur.	And in these fistulas there is no cure at all: and the cure of them is toil and old age from foolish doctors, who make a lot of noise.
In illa autem quae non est penetrans, et non antiqua, speratur sanatio cum serro: secundum quod ego narro tibi, et ego iam probaui: et est, ut iaceat infirmus inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et eleua crura eius usque supra coxas ipsius, et coxae eius sint inclinatae ad uentrem ipsius.	But in that which is not penetrating, and is not old, there is hope of cure with the iron: for I have told you, and I have already proved it: and it is so, that the sick man lies between your hands on his back: and wash his legs all the way up to his thighs, and his thighs are bent towards his belly.
Deinde intromittetentam plumbi, aut aeris, si est in Fistula tortuositas, donec scias ubi peruenit tenta.	Then introduce a lead or air, if it is in a twisted fistula, until you know where the opening lies.
Si autem sentit eam infirmus circa anum, tunc oportet ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum.	If, however, he feels it to be weak about a certain joint, then it is necessary that you introduce your finger into the joint.
Si ergo sentis in digito tuo tentam iam penetrasse per seipsam detectam, praeter quod sentias inter digitum tuum, et inter ipsum sifac, aut carnem: tunc ergo scias certe, quia est penetrans: non ergo labores in ea, quoniam non est eius sanatio, sicut diximus.	If, then, you feel that the tenting has already penetrated through yourself by detecting it with your finger and between your finger and the skin or flesh: so you should certainly know that it is penetrating: do not therefore labor in it, since it is not a matter of its health, as we have said.
Dixerunt tamen, quia sanatur in quibusdam hominibus caro, et ex medicatione qua ei speratur iuuamentum, est, ut ignias cauterium subtile secundum amplitudinem Fistulae, sicut praecessit, et intromittas ipsum ignitum in Fistulam, donec perueniat circa anum.	They said, however, that it heals in certain people by means of a substance and from the treatment they hoped for a cure, that is, as we preceded, to introduce the kindling fire into the fistula little by little and until it reaches a certain joint.
Deinde itera illud bis, aut ter, donec scias, quia iam adustae sunt omnes illae carnes additae filtratae, quae sunt similes cannulae pennae auis.	Then repeat that twice or three times until you know that all the added filtered flesh, which is similar to a feathered tube, has been burned out, and
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, donec egrediantur illae carnes, quae adustae sunt: deinde cura illud cum unguentis generantibus carnem et consolidantibus.	Then treat that with a smooth dressing in butter until the flesh that has been burned out comes off: and then treat it with an ointment that generates flesh and hardens it.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est.	If, then, it heals, it is good.
Et si non, tunc non sanatur cum alia curatione unquam.	And if not, then it does not heal with any other treatment ever.
Et si egreditur tenta, et non peruenerit usque ad digitum tuum, qui est in ano, et est inter ipsum et tentam uelamen spissum ex carne, aut sifac: et uides Fistulam in eo quod sequitur superficiem cutis, tunc seca cutem ab initio Fistulae, et tu uadis secando cum tenta quod est in fistula, donec perueniat secatio ubi peruenit tentae extremitas, et liberatur tenta et cadit.	And if it comes out, and does not reach as far as your finger, which is in the anus, and is between the finger and the tenting or a thick layer of flesh, or skin: and you see the fistula in it, following the surface of the skin, then dry the skin from the beginning of the fistula, and you will see that it dries out with the tenting that is in the fistula, until the drying out reaches where the end of the tenting lies, and it is released and falls.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas, quae assimilantur cannulae pennae auis, ut non remaneat ex eis aliquid.	Then clean those filtered flesh that are similar to a feathered tube so that nothing remains of them.
Si autem uincit te sanguis, et soluit inter te et inter operationem tuam ut seces illas carnes: tunc melius quod fit, et uelocioris iuuamenti, cauterizare eam cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta.	If however the blood is victorious over you, and it flows between you and your work so that it separates those muscles: then it is better if it was done quickly, and with more force of the caustic, cauterize her with fire, or with acute medicine.
Quoniam cauterium cum igne aggregat habitudines bonas, adustionem illarum carnium additarum, et abscisionem sanguinis, et exiccationem humiditatum.	For the caustic with fire collects good habits, to the burning of those muscles, and to the separation of blood, and drying up of wetness.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, aut caulibus tritis, donec locus emittat pus, et egrediantur illae carnes adustae in pus.	Then that care with mild baths in butter, or with chopped wands, until the place discharges pus, and those dried-up muscles come out in pus.
Deinde cura tunc uulnus cum unguentis consolidatiuis, generantibus carnem duram: et sunt medicinae in quibus sunt stipticitas et exiccatio.	Then that care then a wound with consolatory ointments, which bring forth hard flesh: and there are medicines in which are staphylitis and drying up.
Nam quando restaurantur, tunc iam sanatur: et non times iterationem.	For when they have healed, then the cure is finished: and do not put off the application.
Si autem Fistula iam peruenit usque ad profundum ani, et elongatur a superfluitate corporis: tunc intromitte digitum tuum in anum, et inquire cum eo.	If however the fistula has reached as far as the depth of the hip, and it extends beyond the limits of the body: then insert your hand into it, and ask it.
Si ergo sentis tentam, et inter te, et inter eam est uelamen ex sifac, aut carne, et est propinqua penetrationi: tunc non est operatio in illo, nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	If however you feel the attempt, and between you and it there is a defect of sine or flesh, and it is near to the penetration: then there is no operation in that, except by means of second opinion and hope.
Quod est, quia administratur in eo unus trium modorum: aut ut cauterizes ipsam, sicut diximus: aut seces eam, donec consequaris concauitatem eius, ut sit possibile tibi intromittere licinia, et curationem ex proximo.	That is, because it is administered in it one of two ways: or as it cauterizes itself, as we have said: or as it separates itself, until the consequences of its concavity come to an end, so that you can insert a caustic, and cure from nearby.
Et non procedas multum cum sectione, ut non incidas lacertum continentem anum, et accidat super infirmum exitus egestionis absque uoluntate.	And do not proceed much with the section, lest you fall on a snake that holds some part of it, and happens to the unfortunate end of exhaustion without intention.
Deinde cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then that care then with it that we have said.
Fortasse enim sanabitur: aut elonges ipsum uelamen, et mundes ipsum postquam secas ipsum usque prope anum, sicut diximus, aut cum tenta, aut cum instrumento alio acutae extremitatis.	Perhaps however it will be healed: or it will lengthen the defect, and dry it up until near to a hip, as we have said, or with an attempt, or with another acute instrument of extremes.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas quae sunt in sectione, usque ubi potes cum perscrutatione.	Then clean those filtered meats that are in the incision, as far as you can with examination.
Deinde conare restaurationem uulneris totius cum sectione, et orificio superiore ubi consolidatur: et remanet Fistula aperta in interiore parte anus, et erit leuius super infirmum.	Then consider the restoration of the whole wound with the incision, and the opening of the upper part where it is consolidated; and there remains an open fistula in the inner part of the anus, and it will be looser on the weak one.
Et quandoque suitur Fistula secundum hunc modum: et est, quando intromittis tentam in Fistulam: et est in latere ani circa superficiem corporis cum cute et margine ani: tunc accipe tentam perforatae extremitatis, quae est sicut acus aleskef, id est, praeparantium coria, secundum hanc formam.	And when this fistula follows this way: and it is, when you put a probe into it: and it is in the side of the anus near the surface of the body with skin and the margin of the anus; then take the end of the probe that is like a needle's point, namely, the准备的针头, as follows.
Et intromitte in eam filum inuolutum ex quinque filis, et circiter ea.	And put into it a threaded wire with five threads, and around it.
Deinde intromitte tentam cum filo in Fistulam, donec consequatur concauitatem eius.	Then put the probe with a thread into the fistula, until you get a convulsion of it.
Si ergo est penetrans in margine ani interius prope, tunc extrahe filum ex illo foramine: ita ut intromittas digitum tuum in anum, et extrahas extremitatem fili, et aggreges duas extremitates simul: et stringe utramque, et dimitte illud die uno, aut duobus diebus: et quanto plus incidit filum in carne, stringe ipsum bene, donec incidantur illae carnes quae sunt inter duas extremitates fili, et cadant: deinde cura uulnus, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	If so it penetrates into the inner margin of the anus near, then remove the thread from that hole: so that you put your finger in the anus, and remove the end of the thread, and bring both ends together at once: and tighten them well, until one day or two days pass: and to the extent that the thread penetrates into the flesh, tighten it well, until those muscles that are between the two ends of the thread fall out: then take care of the wound, until it is consolidated, and heals.
Si autem orificium Fistulae non est penetrans: tunc fac ipsum penetrare quocunque modo praeparatur tibi, nisi sit in profundo multum.	If the hole of the fistula does not penetrate: then make it penetrate with any way you prepare for yourself, unless it is in a deep place.
Non enim inest tibi, ut facias illud propter lacertum, ut non incidas ipsum.	For you do not want to make it like this, that you do not hit the same one:
Deinde fac cum ea sicut diximus, donec sanetur.	Then do with it as we have said, until it heals.
Forma Spatumilis spinosi quo finditur Fistula, cuius curuitas est acuta ualde, et pars altera est non acuta, ut non incidat illud quod non est necesse, sicut uides.	Form of the probe which finds the fistula, whose sharpness is sharp very much, and the other part is not sharp, so that it does not hit that which is not necessary, as you see.
¶ De sutura Hemorroidarum, ex quibus currit sanguis ex incisione earum: et cura fissurarum.	As for the suturing of hemorrhoids, from which runs blood from the incision of them: and take care of the fissures.
Caput LXXXI.	Chapter LXXXI.
Sunt Hemorroides secundum duos modos.	There are hemorrhoids in two ways.
Aut enim sunt intra anum, similes uesicis carbonum, uel prunarum: aut quasi ipsae sint grana uuae.	Either they are within the anus, like coal or plums; or nearly like grains of grain.
Et ex eis sunt paruae, et magnae: et sanguis currit ex eis semper, et est una, et sunt multae.	And from them there are small ones and large ones: and the blood flows out of them always, and one is, and many are.
Et sunt extra anum, et in extremitatibus eius.	And they are outside the anus, and at its extremities.
Verumtamen istae quae sunt extra anum, sunt secundum plurimum paucae humiditatis, ex quibus currit aqua citrina, aut parum sanguinis cursu assiduo: et sunt secundum colorem corporis.	But those outside the anus are few in number and with little moisture, from which flows yellow water or a little blood regularly; and they are the color of the body.
Et curatio eius quae est intra anum, est, ut praecipias infirmo ut assellet: et exprimatur, donec egrediatur anus, et appareant athelil tibi.	And the treatment that is within the anus, is, as you order the sick person to lie down: and it is expressed, until it comes out of the anus, and appears smooth before you.
Propterea ergo et suspende cum uncinis: aut tene eos cum ungue tuo.	Therefore hang them with a hook: or hold them with your fingernail.
Deinde incide eos apud radices suas.	Then cut them at the roots.
Si autem non retinentur in eis uncini, propter humiditatem eorum et ipsorum mollificationem: tunc cape eos cum panno aspero, aut cum coto ex diploide lanea, et extrahe eos cum digitis tuis.	But if they do not hold on to the hooks because of their moisture and softness: then take them with a rough cloth or with a twig of willow, and draw them out with your fingers.
Deinde incide eos, et pulueriza super eos post incisionem quosdam pulueres calidos, ut stent eis loco cauterii.	Then cut them, and sprinkle on them some hot powder after the cut so that they stay in place for a cauterization.
Aut cauteriza eos secundum quod praecessit in capitulo cauterizandi.	Or cauterize them according to what has been said in the chapter of cauterizing.
Deinde cura eos cum reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then care for them with the rest of the cure, until they are healed.
Quod si non obedit anus egressioni, tunc clisteriza infirmum clisteri in quo sit mordicatio parua, ut lauetur cum eo quod est in ano, et obediat egressioni uelociter, quando exprimit se infirmus.	If the anus does not comply with this exit, then clench the sick person with a small clister that causes pain, so that it may go along with what is in the anus, and complies with this exit when it comes out, if it comes out smoothly.
Si autem athelil sunt extrinseci ab ano, tunc res eorum est leuis, facilis: et est ut capias eos cum ungue tuo, aut capias eos cum uncino, et incidas eos.	But if the hemorrhoids are external from the anus, then your task is easy and simple: you can hold them with your fingernail or with a hook, and cut them off.
Deinde cura eos cum eo quod diximus, donec sanentur.	Then care for them with the above-mentioned means until they are healed.
Et qui abhorret incisionem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut administres suturam eorum secundum hunc modum.	And who loathes incisions with iron, then it is necessary that you administer sutures to them in this way.
Accipe filum inuolutum, et intromitte ipsum in acum.	Accept a thread which has been wetted, and introduce it itself into the wound.
Deinde extrahe athelil ad superiora, et fac ipsum penetrare cum acu in radice eius ex parte altera: et inuolue duas extremitates fili, in inferiori parte acus, et sint latitudinaliter: et stringe athelil strictura forti.	Then remove the thread to the upper side, and let it penetrate with the needle into the root of its other part: and roll the two ends of the thread, in the lower part of the needle, and let them run parallel to each other: and tighten the thread with a strong knot.
Deinde noda filum, et extrahe acum.	Then tie a knot in the thread, and remove the needle.
Fac illud cum omnibus athelil, et dimitte ex eis unum: nec suas ipsum, ut currat ex eo superfluitas sanguinis.	Do this with all the threads, and let one of them remain: and let it not be attached to its own end, that it may run away from it in case of an excess of blood.
Deinde pone super anum pannum infusum in oleo rosato, aut caeroto, et pone ipsum super anum: et praecipe infirmo, ut quiescat.	Then put it on a cloth soaked in rose oil or olive oil, and put it on the wound: and order the sick person to lie down.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, donec cadat.	Then remove the cloth, until it has dried.
Cum ergo cadunt athelil, cura eos cum unguentis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	When therefore the threads have fallen off, care for them with ointment, and with the remainder of the cure, until they are healed.
¶ De cura Fissurarum.	§ On the care of wounds.
Multotiens enim accidunt ex exiccatione stercoris, et constrictione naturae.	For many times there happen from drying up of dung, and from the natural contraction.
Cum ergo antiquantur, et non ualet in eis medicina: tunc oportet ut radas cum puncta Spatumilis, aut cum ungue tuo, donec fiant humidae, et auferatur ab eis cortex superior qui prohibet eas a consolidatione.	When therefore they have become old, and do not bear any medicine: then it is necessary that you shave them with the sharp blade of Spatulimilus, or with your own nail, until they are wet, and that you remove from them the upper cortex which prevents them from being consolidated.
Deinde cura eas, donec consolidentur secundum quod oportet.	Then care for them, until they are consolidated, according to what is necessary.
Si autem non consolidantur: tunc itera eas cum rasione uehementiori quam prima, donec sanguinentur multum, et excorientur deinde cura eas, donec sanentur.	If however they do not consolidate: then shave them again with a sharper razor than before, until they bleed much, and then care for them, until they are healed.
¶ De curatione Almirmar inuersorum, et non inuersorum: et Athelil siccorum, et Formicae.	§ On the cure of scabs, and not of scabs; and of the threads of cicatrices, and of the ants.
Caput LXXXII.	Chapter LIII.
Scias quod Almirmar non est nisi nodus rotundus secundum colorem corporis, similis capiti claui: et fit in toto corpore, praecipue in inferioribus partibus pedum, et digitis: et accidit ex eis dolor apud ambulationem.	You should know that Almirmar is not anything but a round nodule according to the color of the body, similar to a claw on the head: and it happens in the whole body, especially in the lower parts of the feet and fingers: and it causes pain when walking.
Oportet ergo ut secetur quod est in circumitu claui, et teneatur cum forficibus, aut cum uncino, et eradicetur ex radice sua.	It is therefore necessary to cut off what is on the edge of the claw, and to hold with pincers, or with a hook, and to remove it from its root.
Deinde cura illud: et si uis cauteriza illud secundum quod praecessit in capitulo suo.	Then this care must be taken: and if you want to cauterize that according to what preceded in his chapter.
Ex athelil autem siccis unus est eminentia parua, aspera, filtrata, rotunda supra superficiem corporis.	From the animal however one is a small eminence, rough, filtered, round over the surface of the body.
Et multotiens accidunt in manibus puerorum.	And often happen in the hands of boys.
Et curatio eius est, ut extendas athelil, et incidas ipsum: aut stringas ipsum cum filo de serico: aut cum pilo, donec cadat.	And the cure of it is that you should extend the athelil, and press it on: or you should tie it with silk thread: or with wool, until it falls off.
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum secundum quod praemissum est cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta: et iam eradicantur athelil inuersi, et non inuersi cum instrumento quod ego dicam.	And if you want to, cauterize that according to what has been said before with fire, or with sharp medicine: and those athelils are removed immersed, and not immersed with an instrument that I call.
Formica autem est etiam eminentia parua filtrata, grossa, super superficiem corporis, uadens in profundum ualde: et quando inuenit eam frigus, sentitur in ea simile mordicationi formicae, et fit in corpore toto: et plurimum eius fit in manibus.	But the ant is also a small eminence, filtered, rough, over the surface of the body, dripping into the depth far away: and when it finds it cold, feels in it a similar stinging of an ant, and becomes all over the body: and most of it is made in the hands.
Et curatio eius est, ut accipias cannulam ex penna anseris, aut penna uulturis forti: et pone illam cannulam super Formicam, donec contineat circulus cannulae ex partibus eius.	And the cure of it is that you take a tube from a goose feather, or a strong turkey feather: and put that tube on the ant, until it holds a circle of the tube from its parts.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum cannula, donec seces quod est in circumitu Formicae: et ponas eam in profundo carnis, et eradices Formicam ex radice eius.	Then turn your hand with the tube, until you separate what is on the edge of the ant: and put it in the depth of the flesh, and remove the ant from its root.
Et si uis, fac illud cum cannula aeris, aut ferri, secundum hanc formam.	And if you want to, do that with an air tube, or a iron tube, according to this form.
Sit superius cannulae ad sublimitatem trahens surdum inuolutum, ut alleuietur super digitum apprehensio eius et ipsius reuolutio.	Let the tube be above a small limit, dragging a soft un-felt, so that it should ease the pressure of its grasp and its retraction.
Et si uis cauteriza Formicam secundum quod praemissum est in cauterizatione Athelil in capitulo de cauterio.	And if you want to, cauterize the ant according to what has been said before in the cauterization of athelil in the chapter on cauterization.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum quae administrantur ad Clisteria in aegritudinibus Ani, et solutionis uentris, et colicae.	On the forms of instruments used for enemas in the ailments of the anus, and for washing away the urine and colic.
Caput LXXXIII.	Chapter 83.
Quandoque Clistere fit ex argento, aut ex aurichalco, aut ex aere fuso, aut malleato.	When cloisters are made of silver, or of gold, or of brass, or of hammered bronze.
Et quandoque fit ex istis Instrumentis paruum, et magnum, secundum illos in quibus administrantur.	And when these instruments are small or large, according to those in which they are administered.
Illud ergo quod administratur in curatione puerorum paruorum, sit paruum: et quorum ani sunt debiles, aut dolorosi, sic et clisteria eorum.	So that which is administered in the cure of young boys who are small, let it be small; and those whose anus is weak or painful, let their cloisters also be small.
Clistere magnum.	A large enema.
Cistere paruum.	A small enema.
Canna eius, id est, caput superius in quo ligatur uter, sit amplum secundum hunc modum: et sit ei distinctio ut ligetur uter sicut uides, et extremitas eius inferior quae intromittitur in anum, sit surda, id est, non aperta, lenis, ualde, trahens ad subtilitatem: et in uno laterum eius sint duo foramina, et in latere altero foramen unum.	The cane of the instrument, that is, the upper part in which it is tied to the uterus, should be wide according to this manner: and let there be a separation so that it is tied as you see, and the lower end which enters into the anus, should be dull, i.e., not open, soft, very gentle, drawing towards finesse: and on one side of its cane there are two openings, and on the other side a single opening.
Et sit amplitudo foraminis secundum grossitudinem radiorum, et grossius parum, et sit uter in quo ponuntur medicinae ex uesica animalis: aut ex charta ouis, quae sit secundum formam asofrati paruae: cuius radix sit palmus unus.	And let the width of the openings be according to the thickness of the radii, and the thicker for the smaller, and let the uterus in which are placed the medicines be of a sheep-skin: or of a piece of paper shaped like an ashen, which is small: whose root is one palm.
Et perforetur foraminibus multis sicut reuoluitur, et sit spacium quod est inter omne foramen grossitudo digiti.	And let many openings be pierced like the wind blows through, and let there be a space between each opening which is the width of a finger.
Deinde intromitte in illa foramina filum forte ex filo crudo, quod sit ex decem filis, aut circiter ea, et aggrega cum eo utrem sicut asofrati.	Then introduce into those openings a strong thread from raw silk, which is made up of ten threads, or something like that, and tie it with one of the threads.
Cum ergo ponitur in eo uter, stringatur in capite clisteris inter duo distinguentia constrictione forti.	When it is placed in this uterus, let a tight constriction be applied to it between the two openings.
Deinde clisteriza cum eo.	Then wash with it.
Et haec est forma circuli utris hic depicta, et foraminum.	And this is the shape of the uterus here depicted and of the openings.
Qualitas autem clisterizandi cum eo, est: ut impleas utrem, aut uesicam ex medicina, quae sit calefacta secundum quantitatem tolerantiae infirmi: et caue ne sit calida ualde, aut frigida ualde.	The quality of washing with it is: that you fill the uterus, or the uterus of a sheep-skin soaked in medicine which has been warmed according to the tolerance of the nurse, and let not be very hot or very cold.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et eleuet crura sua ad superiora: et pone sub eo inthaan, id est, corium super quod iacent homines, aut linteamen.	Then the sick one is placed on his back, and his legs are lifted up towards the sky; and a blanket or mattress is placed under him, that is to say, skin over which men lie, or linen.
Deinde inunge extremitatem Clisteris cum oleo, aut cum albugine oui, aut cum mucillagine foenugraeci, aut similium.	Then the end of the limb is smeared with oil, or with chalk powder, or with mucilaginous foil of fenugreek, or something similar.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in anum cum facilitate.	Then introduce the body into the wound with ease.
Deinde accipiat minister utrem cum duabus manibus suis simul, et exprimat ipsum cum uehementia, donec euacuet totum quod est in Clisteri in intestinum.	Then a servant takes both of his hands and he pushes himself out with great force until all that is inside theClisteri has been expelled into the intestines.
Deinde extrahe Clistere, et eleuet infirmus crura sua ad parietem.	Then take out theClisteri, and lift up the sick man's legs towards the wall.
Quod si medicina cogit eum ad exitum, tunc teneat quantum potest.	If the medicine makes him come out, then hold on to him as much as you can.
Et si dormit cum ea nocte tota, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if he sleeps all night with it, it is more effective for healing.
Si autem clisterizas eum in aegritudinibus solutionis uentris, et festinat exitus eius: tunc itera clistere, donec sanetur.	But if youClisterize him in the solution of a single day, and his departure is hurried: then repeat theClisteri until he is healed.
Quod si in ano sunt hemorroides, aut apostemata laedentia, tunc sit clistere subtile ualde, lene, ex clisteribus quibus clisterizantur pueri.	That if there are hemorrhoids, or sore posthemiums: thenClisterize with a thin solution very gently, wax, andClisteri from which the boys areClisterized.
Et haec sit forma clisteris subtilis super quod sit stricta cutis.	And this is the form of a thinClisteri over which there is a tight skin.
¶ De curatione Vulnerum capitis sine fractura ossis.	¶ For the healing of head wounds without fracture of bone.
Caput LXXXIIII.	Head, 84.
Iam dixi in diuisione de curatione uulnerum quod conueniebat libro, et ego dicam hic curationem eorum cum manu, et cum medicinis secundum complementum.	I have already said in the division of the healing of wounds which belonged to the book, and I now say here those healing with the hand, and with medicines, according to the second preparation.
Dico ergo, quod uulnera diuersificantur secundum illud quo fiunt uulnera, et secundum locum super quem cadit uulnus.	I say then that wounds differ according to that by which they are made, and according to the place on which the wound falls.
Res ergo quibus fiunt uulnera multotiens, sunt sicut iactus lapidis: aut incisio ensis, aut cultelli: aut percussio cum lancea, aut ligno, aut sagitta: et similibus illis ex rebus multis.	Therefore the wounds which are often made, are like the blows of a stone: or the cut of a sword, or of a dagger: or the strike of a lance, or of a wood-splinter, or of an arrow. And of many other such things.
Vulnera autem quae fiunt secundum loca corporis sunt, sicut uulnus quod cadit super caput, aut collum, aut pectus, aut uentrem, aut epar: et similia ex eis membris.	Wounds that are made according to the places of the body, such as an arrow that falls on the head, or the neck, or the chest, or the belly, or the side: and similar members from them.
Et ego sum narrans curationes quorundam uulnerum, ut ponam eam ratiocinationem et regulam super reliqua uulnera.	And I am telling about the cures of certain wounds, so that I may put forth a reasoning and a rule for the remaining wounds.
Et ego incipiam a uulneribus capitis simplicibus: quoniam rememoratio compositorum ueniet in principio capituli tertii.	And I will begin with simple head wounds: because the memory of the composers will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
Dico ergo.	I say:
Quando accidit in capite uulnus simplex, et non est fractura ossis: considera tunc, si est ex iactu lapidis, aut ei similibus, et iam fregit cutem tantum: et est uulnus magnum, et times super infirmum euentum apostematis calidi: tunc propera, et phlebotoma cephalicam statim: et non tardes illud: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius: si non fuerit prohibens aliquid a phlebotomia, praecipue si fuerit sanguis qui egreditur ex uulnere paucus.	When it has happened in the head a simple wound, and there is no fracture of bone: then consider, if it is from a stone's throw, or similar to it, and already has frayed the skin only: and it is a great wound, and fear about possible gangrene of the warm: then approach, and immediately phlebotomy cephalic: and do not delay that: and extract therefrom according to the quantity of its effectiveness: if it were not prohibiting anything from the phlebotomy, especially if it were the blood which comes out from the wound little.
Et sit phlebotomia ex contrario partis uulneratae.	And let the phlebotomy come from the opposite side of the wounded part.
Et caueat infirmus sibi a repletione, et uino, et cibis grossis.	And let the sick person take care not to drink anything, and no wine, and no heavy food.
Si autem minutionem prohibet aliquid, tunc minoretur ex cibo, et non appropinquet carnibus, neque uinis.	If however there is a prohibition of something, then it will be reduced from the food, and does not come near to meat, neither wine.
Et pone super uulnus si accidit ei apostema calidum, cotum infusum in oleo rosato solo, aut cum uino in quo est stipticitas.	And place over the wound if it has happened to him a warm poultice, wet infusion in oil of rosemary alone, or with wine in which is stipticitis.
Si autem securus fueris ab apostemate calido, tunc pone super uulnus, si est recens cum sanguine suo, et non mutauit ipsum aer, puluerem quem ego narrabo post paululum: et si iam mutauit ipsum aer, tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, donec sanetur.	If however you are safe from a warm poultice, then place over the wound if it is new with its own blood, and has not changed itself air, dust which I will tell after a little while: and if it has already changed itself air, then place over it some ointment, until it heals.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, aut est ex incisione ensis, et similium: et non aggregantur labia eius per puluillos, tunc aggrega ipsa cum sutura, secundum quod ego narrabo in uulneribus uentris de sutura eorum.	If however the wound is large, or it is from an incision of a sword, and similar: and if its edges are not gathered by dusts, then gather them themselves with a stitch, according to what I will tell after about the wounds of the hand regarding their stitches.
Si autem uulnus iam detectum est ab osse, et pendet, et non est retentio eius, nisi in suspensorio paruo: tunc incide ipsum.	If however the fracture has already been detected from the bone, and is hanging down, and there is no retentive force, except a small one in the suspender: then cut it off.
Deinde cura uulnus cum medicinis, et restaura in eo carnem duram loco cutis, et praecipe infirmo, ut alatur cibis in quibus est grossitudo, sicut sunt capita, et triticum coctum, donec sit ut puls: et eis similia.	Then care for the wound with medicines, and restore to it tough flesh in the place of the skin, and order the sick person to eat food in which there is moisture, such as are grains, and cooked rice, until it has healed like a scar: and give them similar things.
Quod si inuenis in cute putrefactionem, et non adhaeret ossi: tunc incide putrefactum totum, et proiice ipsum: deinde cura illud.	That if an injury is in the skin and does not attach to the bone: then cut off the whole of the putrid part, and throw it away; then care for that.
Si autem in his uulneribus est arteria, aut uena ex qua fluit sanguis: et non abscinditur per medicinas, tunc inquire super arteriam.	If however there is an artery in these wounds, or a new one from which blood flows: and does not stop with medicines, then inquire about the artery.
Si ergo inuenis eam non sectam, tunc seca eam cum Spatumili, aut liga eam.	If however you have not cut off the injury, then dry it up with sputum, or bind it.
Quod si necessitas prouocat quando non confert illud quod diximus, tunc cauteriza eam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	That if necessity compels you when it does not give what I have said, then burn it off, until the blood stops flowing.
Si autem uulnera ista sunt parua, simplicia, tunc res eorum est facilis, leuis: ita ut puluerizes super ea hunc puluerem: quoniam consolidat ea antequam mutet ea aer.	If however these wounds are small and simple, then the work on them is easy and light: so that dusting over them this dust, for they will harden before they change.
¶ Modus Pulueris incarnatiui.	Method of Powder for Burned Wounds.
Recipe olibani partem unam, et sanguinis draconis partes duas, et calcis non extinctae partes tres: teratur totum multum, et cribelletur: et impleatur ex eo uulnus, et constringatur constrictione bona, donec adhaereat super ipsum bene, et coaguletur cum sanguine.	Recipe one part of olive oil, and two parts of dragon's blood, and three parts of burned stone that has not been extinct: all are ground together, and sieved: and it is filled with it, and tightened with a good constriction, until it adheres well to the wound, and clots with blood.
Deinde stringe ipsum desuper cum puluillis, et dimitte ipsum, neque soluas ipsum dum permanet, ita quod non apostemetur.	Then tighten it on top with the powder, and leave it, and do not remove it until it has dried up: so that it does not ooze out.
Nam non eradicatur ab eo medicina, donec sanatur.	For it will not be cured by medicine, until it is cured.
Et quandoque facit illud calx sola, quando non sunt tibi in praesenti olibanum, et sanguis draconis etiam facit eandem operationem in multis ex uulneribus magnis, quando conuenit ut ponatur super ea et stringantur, et sunt uulnera recentia cum sanguine suo, quae non alterauit aer.	And when it has done this lime alone, when you do not have with you olive oil, and dragon' s blood also does the same operation on many large wounds, when it is put on them and tightened: and are wounds recent with their own blood, which has not been altered by air.
Quod si iam alterauit ea aer quadam alteratione, praecipue quando est in tempore aestatis, tunc non est in positione huius pulueris intentio: cura ergo ipsum cum eo quod diximus, ita ut ponas super ea quaedam unguenta digestiua: aut ponas super ea pultes ex farina hordei, factas cum aqua et melle, donec emittant pus.	If I have already changed the air by some change, especially when it is in the time of summer, then this powder's purpose is not in this position: therefore take care of him with what we said, so that you put on her some unguents digesting: or put on her some flours from barley, made with water and honey, until they emit pus.
Deinde cura ea reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then take care of the rest with this cure, until they are healed.
Si uero accidat cum uulnere fractura in osse, et est parua, tunc extrahe illud cum Gesti: et ego iam dicam curationem fracturarum capitis in eo quod futurum est.	But if it happens that a bone fracture is small and has been broken, then remove it with the Gesti: and I have already said the cure for fractures of the head as it will happen.
¶ De uulneribus Colli.	Regarding wounds of the neck.
Caput LXXXV.	Head LVII.
SI Autem uulnus accidat in Collo, tunc non est inter ipsum differentia in medicatione, et inter uulnus capitis quando est simplex.	If a wound is in the neck, there is no difference in treatment between it and a wound of the head when it is simple.
Si autem iam incisus est neruus Colli, aut arteria: tunc si est neruus, non est in eo ingenium, nisi ut deuitetur curatio eius cum eo quod facit stipticitatem uehementem, sicut ziniar, et zegi, et eis similia.	But if a wound has already penetrated the neck's nerve, or artery: then if it is a nerve, there is no skill in it except to let it run its course with what makes a harsh stipulation, such as vinegar, and dressing, and things like that.
Quoniam nocent neruis, et contrahunt eos.	Since they are harmful to the nerves, and make them twitch.
Et non ponas super uulnus aliquid frigidum omnino: quoniam substantia neruorum est frigida, et continuatio eius est cum cerebro, quod est sublimius membrorum: et sit illud quo curatur ex medicinis lene, sicut calx lota cum aqua dulci aliquotiens infusa cum oleo, aut cum oleo rosato, et tuthia, quando abluitur etiam cum aqua dulci: et reliqui lapides minerales, secundum hunc modum, et unguenta humida.	Do not put anything cold on the wound at all: since the substance of the nerves is cold, and its continuance is with the brain, which is a noble member: and let this be used with what cure is made from lene, such as calx lota with sweet water sometimes infused with oil, or with rosewater oil, and thistle, when it is rinsed with sweet water: and also the mineral stones, in this way, and wet unguents.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, tunc administra suturam: aut coarta labia eius cum puluillis.	But if the wound is large, then administer a suture: or cover its lips with powder.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of him, until he is healed.
Si uero uulneri est profunditas, aut accidit in eo sinus in inferiori parte eius, in quo iam aggregatur pus, tunc perfora ipsum in magis depresso loco in eo.	But if a wound is deep, or has occurred in it a pocket of pus on the lower part of it, then pierce it in a more depressed place.
Quod si iam incisa est in uulnere arteria, et consecutus est sanguinem eius fluxus: tunc separa, uel seca eam, et liga ipsam: aut cauteriza eam, si prouocat necessitas ad illud.	If the artery is already cut in the ulna and its blood flow continues: then separate, or dry it up, and bind it; or, if necessary, cauterize it.
Si autem iam incidit spondiles gutturis, aut totum, et saluatae sunt alhaudegi: tunc aggrega labia cutis cum sutura super cannam gutturis, et non tangas guttur, imo aequa ipsum, et reduc ipsum super figuram naturalem.	But if the spine has already been injured and some of the spinal fluid has been spilled or most of it has been lost: then join the skin with a stitch above the canal of the fluid, and do not touch the fluid, but make it level and reduce it back to its natural shape.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti, et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot.	Then tighten the wound with a stitch that diminishes gradually, and leave it for a few days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis in quibus est stipticitas et exiccatio, donec sanetur.	Then treat the wound with ointment to prevent pustules and drying, until it heals.
Si autem uulnus iam fecit impressionem in osse, tunc perquire ipsum: tunc si in ipso sunt fragmenta ossis, extrahe ea omnia, aut quae potes ex eis: et quod non praeparatur, dimitte illud, donec putrescat uulnus, et separetur et alleuietur egressio eius.	But if the ulna has already made an impression on the bone, then examine it: if there are any bone fragments in it, remove them all, or as many as you can: and if it is not prepared, leave it until the ulna rots, and separates and comes out gradually.
Quod si uulnus fuerit recens, tunc pulueriza super ipsum puluerem quem narraui.	If the ulna is still new, then powder it with powder that hardens.
Si autem uidetur in uulnere os, et fit Fistula: tunc cura ipsam cum eo cuius rememoratio uenit in capitulo suo.	But if a fistula has developed in the ulna, then treat it with the treatment described in the chapter on that topic.
¶ De uulnere in Spatulis.	On the ulna in spatulas.
Caput LXXXVI.	Chapter LXVIII. On the ulna:
SI Est percussio lanceae, aut cultelli: et uides eius profunditatem, tunc considera.	If the lance or knife has made a deep wound: then examine it carefully.
Si ergo ex uulnere egreditur uentositas, quando anhelat ex eo infirmus, tunc scias, quia uulnus est mortale.	But if from the ulna comes a fever, and the person who has it becomes weak: then you know that the ulna is deadly.
Quod si non fuerit ei profunditas, et est recens cum sanguine suo: tunc non ponas in eo a prima hora puluerem, neque stringas ipsum, ut non retineatur sanguis in profunditate eius, et reuertatur ad cor, et interficiat infirmum: sed pone in ipso unguentum attractiuum, et solue ipsum in die bis.	If it is not deep and is still new with its blood: then do not put powder on it at first, nor tighten it so that the blood does not flow into its depth and return to its heart, and instead make it ooze a little every day.
Si uero unguentum non est tibi praesens, tunc pone in orificio uulneris cotum uetustum, ut sugat illud quod egreditur de eo ex humiditatibus: et fac ut dormiat infirmus super uulnus, ut currat quod aggregatur in eo.	But if the ointment is not present with you, then put a clean cloth on the wound to absorb what comes out of it due to moisture: and let the person who is ill sleep on the ulna so that he may run to catch what is aggregating in it.
Si uero iam praeterierint uulneri tres dies, aut plures, et non accidit infirmo spasmus, neque tremor cordis malus, neque strictura in anhelitu, et uides reliquas dispositiones eius bonas: tunc scias, quia uulnus est saluum.	If indeed they have already been three days or more without injury, and there has occurred no spasm of illness, nor a bad tremor of the heart, nor a narrowing of anxiety, and their remaining vision is good: then you will know that the wound is healed.
Cura ergo ipsum et cum liciniis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	So take care of it with care and with the rest of the cure, until it is healed.
Si uero excusatur sanatio eius, et iam aperitur semper, tunc scias, quia iam factum est Fistula.	If indeed the healing of it has been excused, and it has now opened forever, then you will know that it has now become a fistula.
Cura ergo ipsam ex capitulo suo.	So take care of it from its own chapter.
Et si uulnus est ex incisione ensis, aut cultelli, et est simplex in superficie pectoris, aut dorsi: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit ex sutura, si est magnum: aut cum puluere, si est paruum.	And if the wound is from an incision of a sword, or of a knife, and it is simple on the surface of the chest, or of the back: then take care of it with what precedes it from suturing, if it is large: or with dust, if it is small.
Si autem iam fecit impressionem in osse, et incidit ex eo frusta: tunc inquire uulnus, et propera ad extrahendum illa frusta, si sunt separata.	But if indeed it has made an impression on the bone, and has cut it from there with a club: then inquire about the wound, and quickly approach to remove those clubs, if they are separated.
Si uero non sunt separata, tunc dimitte ea, donec putrefiat uulnus, alleuiatur enim extractio eorum.	But if they are not separated, then leave them, until the wound has rotted away, for the extraction of them is a relief.
Reliquorum autem uulnerum accidentium in reliquis membris iudicium in curatione, est iudicium eius quod diximus.	But of the remaining wounds and accidents of the other member, the judgment in the cure is the same as that which I have said.
¶ De uulneribus Ventris, et exitu intestini, et exitura eorum.	Of the wounds of the belly and the exit of the intestines and the coming out of them.
Caput LXXXVII.	Chapter LVII.
Disruptio quae accidit uentri, est magna, et media, et parua.	The break that happens in the belly is great, medium, and small.
Ex magna igitur quandoque egreditur intestinum, aut numerus intestinorum.	So then when and how often the intestine exits, or the number of intestines.
Quare fit intromissio eorum, et eorum sutura uehementior et difficilior.	Why do they enter each other, and their stitching is more painful and difficult.
Et disruptio parua etiam fit difficilis ex modo alio.	And a small break is also difficult in another way.
Sequitur ergo, ut sit reductio eorum difficilior, si non properas in intromissione sua ad locum suum statim: quoniam inflatur, aperitur, et ingrossatur: quare fit difficilis introitus eius.	So follow, so that the reduction of them is more difficult, if you do not incline to the place of their entry at once: for indeed it swells up, opens up, and thickens up: why does the entrance of it become difficult?
Propter hoc ergo fit melior disruptionum disruptio media: quoniam cum ea non fit difficilis reductio intestini, sicut fit dissicilis in his duabus speciebus.	Therefore, it is better to make a mid-way disruption: for when the intestine does not reduce easily, as it does in these two species, a mid-way disruption is made.
Scias, quod sutura uenris est secundum quatuor modos.	Know that the suturing of wounds is done according to four ways.
Duae suturae communes conueniunt in sutura uentris, et in sutura reliquorum uulnerum corporis: et duae suturae aliae proprie communicant reliquis uulneribus.	Two common sutures join together in the suturing of the eye, and in the suturing of the other wounds of the body; and two other sutures, each by itself, communicate with the rest of the wounds.
Verumtamen sunt magis propriae cum sutura uentris: et ego narro tibi unamquamque cum expositione, et declaratione.	However, there are more proper when it comes to the suturing of the eye; and I will tell you each one, with exposure and explanation.
Dico ergo, quia quando uulnus est paruum, et egreditur ex eo aliquid ex intestino, et fit difficile reducere ipsum: tunc illud est propter unum duorum modorum.	I therefore say that when the wound is small and it is coming out of it some intestines, and it is difficult to reduce them: then this is done for one of two ways.
Aut propter paruitatem disruptionis, sicut diximus: Aut quoniam in intestino est inflatio propter frigus aeris.	Or because the disruption is small, as we have said; or because there is swelling in the intestine due to cold air.
Quando ergo illud est ita, tunc oportet ut calefacias ipsum, ita ut submergas spongiam, aut pannum humidum in aqua tepida sola.	When then should this be done? Then you should warm the wound, so as to submerge a sponge or a wet cloth in warm water alone.
Aut decoquas in aqua squinantum, et cyperum, et spicam, et embroces cum ea intestinum, donec resoluatur inflatio.	Or you should decongest with squinantic water and celery and pepper, and blend it with the intestines, until the swelling goes down.
Quandoque facit illud uinum in quo est stipticitas: et est melius quam aqua sola in resolutione inflationis.	When then does the wine do, in which there is stipticitis: and it is better than just water in resolving swelling.
Cum ergo uides inflationem iam resolui, tunc humecta intestinum cum aqua in qua decocta est altea, aut malua.	When then you see the swelling has already gone down, then wet the intestines with strong beer or wine.
Nam per illud alleuiatur introitus eius cum re parua.	For through this the entrance is relieved, when it is smaller.
Si autem excusatur reditus eius post hanc curationem, tunc finde in disruptione parum, cum instrumento quo secantur hemorrhoides.	If, however, the retreat of it is excused after this treatment, then find a little disruption with the instrument with which they are torn hemorrhoids.
Et curatio prima est melior quando praeparatur, quam sectio: et non fit coactio ad secandum post necessitatem et defectum instrumenti.	And the first treatment is better when it is prepared, than the section; and there is no coercion to cut after need and a lack of instruments.
Sit pars eius una quae est torta, acuta, et pars eius altera non acuta, et extremitas subtilis non sit cum subtilitate Spatumilis, imo sit obtusior parumper: et est illa quae similatur caiada, sicut uides.	Let one part of it be twisted, acute, and the other not acute, and its extremity is fine, a little less sharp than the spine of the pen; and it is like the sawn piece, as you see it.
Cum ergo amplificatur uulnus, et ingreditur intestinum, tunc oportet, ut sit reductio eius secundum formam suam naturalem in loco suo sibi proprio, si possibile est super illud: quoniam est melius.	For when the ulna is enlarged and the intestines are put in, then it is necessary that his reduction be made according to his own natural form in his own place, if possible above it: for it is better.
Quando uero disruptio est ampla in inferiori parte uentris: tunc oportet ut facias iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et pone crura sua altiora capite suo.	When, however, the fracture is wide in the lower part of the uterus: then it is necessary that you should place the sick one on his back, and put his legs higher than his head.
Et si est in superiore parte uentris, tunc pone caput eius, et pectus ipsius altiora quam eius inferiora.	And if he is in the upper part of the uterus, then place his head and his chest higher than his lower parts.
Et similiter si est disruptio in una duarum partium uentris, tunc pone intentionem tuam, et tuam considerationem semper in hoc, ut pars in qua est uulnus sit altior parte altera.	And likewise, if the fracture is in one of the two parts of the uterus, then place your intention and your attention always on this, that the part where the ulna is should be higher than the other part.
Et ita oportet, ut admimistres illud in uulneribus magnis, et in uulneribus mediis.	And thus it is necessary, so that you treat the wound in large wounds and in middle-sized wounds.
In uulneribus autem paruis, pone illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	But in small wounds, place it according to what is prepared for you.
Deinde fac ut sit praesens inter manus tuas minister pius, qui teneat disruptionem totam manu sua: et aggrega labia eius.	Then make sure that a faithful minister who holds the whole fracture with his hand is present between your hands: and gather his lips.
Deinde detege ex ea ei qui sequitur suturam aliquid post aliquid: et iste est modus suturae communis unius.	Then identify from him who follows someone to sew something after something: and this is the method of common sewing of one thread.
Et est, ut accipias acum, aut numerum acuum secundum quantitatem amplitudinis uulneris.	And it is, so that you take an amount, or a number according to the quantity of the width of the wound.
Deinde dimitte ab extremitate disruptionis quantitatem digiti anularis, id est, medici: et fige acum unam praeter quod intromittas in eam filum in duabus extremitatibuis cutis, cum duabus extremitatibus sifac quod est sub cute ab interioribus, donec facias eam penetrare ab alia parte, et tu iam aggregasti duas extremitates cutis, et duas extremitates sifac: et fiunt quatuor ordines.	Then let go of the end of the fracture by the amount of a finger's length, that is, doctor: and fix now one in front of which you enter into it a thread in the two ends of the skin, with the two ends of the silken thread that is under the skin from the inside, until you make it penetrate from the other side, and you have already gathered the two ends of the skin, and the two ends of the silken thread: and there are four orders.
Deinde stringe cum filo duplo in circumitu acus aliquotiens a duabus partibus simul, quousque sint aggregata duo labia uulneris aggregatione decenti.	Then tie it with a double thread around the needle from both sides at the same time, until the two lips of the wound have been gathered together by the falling in: and there are two threads.
Deinde dimitte grossitudinem digiti etiam, et fige in eis acum aliam: postea reta eam cum filo, sicut fecisti cum acu prima.	Then let go of the grosness of the finger as well, and fix another one in it: then make it straight with a thread, as you did with the needle first.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum eo quo indiges ex acubus, donec compleas constrictionem uulneris totius.	So do not cease doing this with it as long as you feel pain from the spine, until you complete the compression of all the wounds.
Et sint acus mediae inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem: quoniam acus subtiles ualde uelociter incidunt carnem: et grossae sunt difficilis introitus in cutem: propter illud oportet ut sint mediae in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	And let the points be of a medium size between thickness and slimness: for thin points wound the flesh quickly; and thick ones enter difficultly into the skin: therefore it is necessary that the points be of a medium size both in thinness and in thickness.
Et non oportet, ut figatur acus in duabus extremitatibus cutis propinquae multum: ut non incidatur caro uelociter, et aperiatur uulnus ante consolidationem sui, et non elongentur etiam cum sutura, ut non prohibeatur uulnus a consolidatione.	And it is not necessary that the point should be placed near both ends of the skin very much: lest the flesh be wounded quickly, and the wound open before its consolidation, and also be stretched with the stitch so that the wound does not be prevented from its consolidation.
Deinde incide extremitatem acuum, ut non laedant infirmum apud somnum suum: et pone eis puluillos ex pannis ab omni parte, qui teneant extremitates acuum: et dimitte eos, donec scias quod uulnus iam consolidatum est.	Then cut the ends of the points so that they do not hurt the sick person while he is sleeping: and put thereon little pieces of cloth from all sides which shall hold the ends of the points: and let them alone until you know that the wound is consolidated.
Et haec quidem species suturae cum acubus taliter est conuenientior in uulneribus paruis.	And this sort of stitch with points is much more convenient for small wounds.
Quoniam sufficit in sutura eorum acus una, aut duae, aut circiter eas.	For a stitch of their points is sufficient, or two, or three around them.
Sutura autem secunda communis est, ut aggreges cum sutura extremitates quatuor: extremitates, duas cutis, et extremitates duas sifac in uice una, cum acu in qua sit filum inuolutum aequale in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	But a second common stitch is to bring together the ends of four: the ends of the two pieces of skin, and the ends of the two sutures in one thread, with a point in which the fillet is rolled up of equal thinness and thickness.
Deinde quando penetraueris cum acu has extremitates quatuor, reduc acum a parte a qua incaepisti eadem, ut cadat filum retatum a superiori parte uulneris: ut sit sutura, sicut sutura panni quo stringuntur panni, et pone inter omnem suturam quantitatem grossitudinis digiti minoris.	Then when you have penetrated with the point the four ends, draw it back from that part from which you began to take it, so that the fillet is stretched from the upper part of the wound: in order that there may be a stitch, as if it were a stitch of a cloth with which the cloth is tied up, and place between each stitch a quantity of thickness of the little finger.
Hanc autem suturam sciunt homines.	This kind of stitch is known to men.
Et cum hac sutura ego sui uulnus quod acciderat uiro in uentre suo, qui fuerat uulneratus cum cultello, et erat disruptio uulneris maior palmo uno: et exierat ex intestinis circiter duos palmos ex intestino medio, et erat disruptio in medio uentris.	And with this stitch I sewed up a wound in the man's belly, which had been cut by a knife, and the cut was deep about a handbreath: and there came out of his bowels round about two palms' length of middle intestine, and the cut was in the middle of the belly.
Reduxi ergo illud postquam stetit intestinum eius extra uulnus xxiiii horis.	He then reduced that after the intestine had rested outside the pelvis for 24 hours.
Consolidatum est ergo uulnus in spacio quod fuit circiter XV dies: et curaui ipsum, et sanatus est: et uixit post illud annis multis, conuersatus in suis dispositionibus.	So the wound had healed in about 15 days, and I nursed it, and he recovered: and after that he lived for many years, in good health.
Et medici iudicauerant, quod non sanaretur.	And the doctors said that he would not recover.
Et ex miraculo fuit, quod non curaui illud cum unguento.	But by a miracle I healed it without ointment.
Quoniam fui in loco in quo non inueniebatur unguentum, neque aliquid ex medicinis.	Because I was in a place where the ointment was not available, and there were no medicines.
Posui ergo super uulnus cotum uetustum bis in die, et assiduaui ablutionem eius cum aqua mellis, donec sanatum est.	So I put a wet cloth on the wound twice a day, and I bathed it with honey water until it healed.
Duas autem species suturae proprias dicam secundum narrationem sermonis.	But there are two kinds of surgical sutures, which I will describe according to the account.
Et est, ut incipias cum sutura acuta: et intromittas acum ab exteriori ad interiorem partem.	And it is as if you were to begin with an acute stitch, and to insert the thread from the outside to the inside part.
Cum ergo penetrat acus in cutem, et in lacertum euntem secundum longitudinem et latitudinem totius corporis: dimitte extremitatem sifac in latere in quo intromisisti acum, et fac penetrare in extremitatem aliam ab interiori parte ad exteriorem in extremitate altera mirach.	When the needle therefore penetrates the skin, and goes into the fold according to the length and width of the whole body: release the end of the thread that you inserted from the outside, and let it penetrate the other end from the inside to the outside at the other end.
Cum ergo feceris eam penetrare, tunc fac eam penetrare secundum hoc in eadem hac extremitate mirach ab exteriori parte ad interiorem: et dimitte extremitatem sifac, quae est in hoc latere, et fac penetrare acum in extremitatem alteram ab interiori parte ad exteriorem: et fac penetrare cum penetratione tua qua facis eam penetrare in sifac extremitate mirach, quae est in parte eius, donec penetret in ipsum totum.	When you have thus made it penetrate, then let it penetrate according to this in the same end towards the back from the outside to the inside: and release the end of the thread that you inserted from without, and let it penetrate the other end from within to without at the other end.
Deinde incipe etiam ab hoc eodem latere, et sue ipsum cum extremitate, quae est ex sifac in latere alio, et extrahe acum ex cute quam penetrauit.	Then also from this same side, and with the same end, and draw it out of the skin where it penetrated: and take the thread that has passed through the skin.
Deinde reduc eam in illam cutem, et sue extremitatem sifac, quae est in latere alio, cum hac extremitate mirach: et extrahe eam ex cute quae est ex parte eius, et fac illud uice una, et alia: et fac illud uice post uicem, usquequo suas extrinsecum totum secundum illud exemplum.	Then also reduce it into the same skin, and with the other end draw it out of the skin, and take the end that was in the back with this end towards the front: and let it go out of the skin from that part, and make this end move once, and the other move twice: and let it move so as to go round all outside according to this example.
Et summa huius suturae, est ut suas sutura pellipariorum qua suunt pelles: ita ut suas sifac uice una ex parte una extremitate cutis: et ut dimittas eam uice alia ex parte alia, donec compleas.	And the outline of this stitch, is as its stitches are sewn together by the skin: so that its one thread goes from one end of the skin; and so that you dismiss it with another thread from the other side until you have finished.
Secunda species suturae propriae, quam dixit Gale nus.	The second type of stitch is a special kind of stitch, which has been described by Galen.
Iste eius sermo narratus est, ut suas eam secundum similitudinem, qua suunt eas quidam medicantium, ita quod aggregant omnem partem ad comparem suam conuenientem per naturam: et applicant extremitatem sifac ad eius aliam extremitatem, et extremitatem mirach ad extremitatem eius aliam.	This description of the stitch is told as if it were saying, in accordance with a certain similarity, how some physicians put it together, so that it gathers all its parts in a way that is appropriate to nature: and they apply one end to another end, and one end to another.
Et illud fit secundum quod narro tibi.	And this is what I will tell you.
Oportet ut figas acum in extremitatem mirach propinquam tibi ab exteriori parte, et facias eam penetrare ad interiorem in eo solo: et dimittas duas extremitates sifac.	It is necessary that you fix this at the end of the midline near to you from the outside part, and let it penetrate into the inside in that place alone; and dismiss two ends of the thread.
Deinde reuolue acum, et fac eam penetrare ab exteriori parte ad interiorem in duas extremitates sifac, scilicet utrinque.	Then turn around this again, and let it penetrate from the outside part to the inside at both ends of the thread, that is to say, on either side.
Deinde reuolue utrasque, etiam fac penetrare utrasque ab interiori usque ad exteriorem, in duas extremitates mirach alias, quae sunt in latere opposito.	Then turn around both of them, and also let both of them penetrate from the inside to the outside, in two ends of the midline, which are opposite on either side.
Et iste modus suturae est melior sutura communi facili, et est sutura cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And this mode of sewing is a better stitch than an ordinary one, and it is a stitch whose recollection came before.
Iste est ergo sermo Galeni etiam.	This is, then, the speech of Galen as well.
Et dixerunt quidam.	And certain people said:
Retificatur sutura uentris cum duabus acubus.	The stitch should be straightened out for the foot with two toes.
Quod est, ut intromittas in eis utrisque filum unum: et incipe cum intromissione acus, ex eo quod est apud te, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, secundum suturam eorum qui suunt coria aequaliter.	That is, so that you put one thread into both of them; and begin with the introduction of the acupuncture from there where it is in you, and let it penetrate to the other side, following the pattern of those who sew their skin together evenly.
Et scias, quod quando disruptio est in medio uentris: tunc sutura eius est difficilior quam reliquorum locorum uentris.	And you should know that when the break is in the middle of the foot: then the stitch of it is more difficult than at other places of the foot.
Iudicium uero medicationis uulneris, est iudicium reliquorum uulnerum.	The judgement, however, on the treatment of wounds, is a judgement on the other wounds.
Quod est, quia quando tu consequeris uulnus recens cum sanguine suo, antequam alteret ipsum aer: et reducis intestinum, et suis ipsum, et aptas ipsum: tunc pone super puluerem incarnatiuum.	That is, because when you sever a fresh fracture with its own blood, before it alters itself with air; and reduce the intestines, and its own self, and fit self: then place on the powder of incisions.
Quod si aer iam alterauit uulnus: tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, quae sunt tibi praesentia, donec faciant pus: et cadant fila, et consolidentur sifac, et mirach.	If the air has already altered the fracture: then place on the wound some ointment, which are present with you, until it makes pus: and fall off the strings, and solidify the sifac, and improve.
Deinde cura illud sicut est curatio reliquorum uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then care for that as is the cure of other wounds, until it heals.
Si autem non sunt tibi praesentes medicinae, tunc pone super ipsum statim, exquo incipit emittere pus, cotum uetus: et permuta ipsum bis in die, sicut docui te, donec sanetur.	If you do not have the present medicines, then place on the wound at once, so that it begins to emit pus, and change the poultice every day, as I have taught you, until it heals.
Nam tu non indiges medicatione alia in pluribus dispositionibus, quando uulnera sunt simplicia.	For you do not need other medicine in many dispositions when wounds are simple.
Si autem times, quod communicet uulnus membris principalibus in laesione, tunc oportet ut submergas lanam lenem in oleo temperatae caliditatis, aut in oleo rosato: et pone ipsam in circumitu locorum quae sunt inter inguina, et sub ascellas.	If you should suspect that the fracture is communicating with a main member in the injury, then it is necessary that you dip the linen in oil of moderate heat, or in rose oil: and place it on the wound in the circle of the places which are between the hips, and under the armpits.
Quod si sentit dolorem, aut punctiones, aut putrefactionem in intestinis suis (nam multotiens accidit illud) tunc clisteriza ipsum cum uino stiptico, nigro, tepido: praecipue si putredo iam peruenit in intestino, et facta est exitura penetrans usque ad concauitatem eius.	If it feels pain, or punctures, or putrefaction in its intestines (for this often happens) then clisterize the wound with black wine, hot, especially if putridness has already reached the intestine, and has made an exit penetrating up to excretion.
Et scias, quod illud quod est ex intestino grosso, est facilioris sanationis: et quod ex eis est ex subtili, difficilioris sanationis.	And know that what is from the large intestine is easier to heal: and that which is from the small one is more difficult to heal.
Intestinum autem quod nominatur Ieiunum, non suscipit sanationem ex uulnere quod accidit in eo omnino: et illud est propter multitudinem eius, quod est ex uenis, et magnitudine earum, et propter subtilitatem corporis eius, et propinquitatem ipsius naturae neruorum.	But the intestine which is called Jejunium does not accept healing from a fracture that has happened in it: and this is because of the multitude of its folds, that it is from fractures, and its great length, and because of the lightness of its body, and the nearness of its nerves.
Si autem illud quod procedit ex uulnere est zirbum, et consequeris ipsum recens: reduc ipsum secundum reductionem tuam, qua reducis intestina aequaliter.	If however that which proceeds from the fracture is sharp, and you succeed in reducing it: reduce the intestine according to your reduction, reducing the intestines equally.
Si uero praeteriit ei spacium, et iam factum est uiride, aut nigrum: tunc oportet ut stringas ipsum cum filo supra locum qui denigratus est ex eo, ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	If he has indeed passed the time, and it has already become viridescent or black: then you should tie him up with a rope above the spot that has been darkened by him, so that blood does not flow.
In zirbo enim sunt uenae et arteriae.	For in such a place there are veins and arteries.
Deinde incide quod est praeter illud ligamentum, et pone duas extremitates fili pendentes ex inferiori parte uulneris extra ipsum: ut alleuietur super te attractio eius, et extractio ipsius apud casum zirbi, et emissionem pus uulneris.	Then cut where that ligament is, and place the two ends of the rope hanging down from the lower part of the wound outside of himself: so that there will be a drawing away from you of his attraction, and extraction of himself from the wound at the side of the sinew, and emission of pus from the wound.
¶ Rememoratio uulneris quod accidit in Intestino.	Remembering the wound that happened in the Intestine.
Quando accidit disruptio in Intestino, et est parua: tunc possibile est, ut restauretur in quibusdam hominibus: propterea, quia ego uidi qui fuit uulneratus in uentre suo cum percussione lanceae, et erat uulnus a dextra stomachi, et antiquatum est uulnus: et factum Fistula, et exiuit ex eo egestio, et uentositas.	When the rupture happened in the Intestine, and it was small: then it is possible that he can be restored to some men: indeed, for I saw who was wounded in his belly by a lance thrust, and there was a wound from the right side of his stomach, and an old wound: and there was a fistula, and there came out excrement, and vomiting.
Posui ergo curationem, usque quod ego non fui confisus in sanatione eius: neque cessaui subtiliare ipsum, donec sanatus est, et consolidatus est locus.	So I applied the treatment, until I was confident about his recovery: and I did not hesitate to examine him, until he was healed and the place had been hardened.
Postquam ego uidi locum iam consolidatum, timui super infirmum, quod accideret super infirmum accidens malum in uentre suo: et non accidit ei ex illo accidens malum.	After I saw that the place was now hardened, I feared for the illness that might happen to him in his belly: and it did not happen to him from that event any evil.
Et remansit in melioribus dispositionibus suis, comedens et bibens, et futuens, et intrauit balneum, et exercitatus est in dietis suis.	And he remained in his better state of health, eating and drinking and enjoying himself, and going into a bath, and exercising himself in his walks.
Et iam dixerunt quidam experimentatorum, quia quando accidit in Intestino uulnus, et est paruum: tunc oportet ut ligetur secundum hunc modum.	And some of the experimenters said, for when it happened in the Intestine a wound, and it was small: then he should be tied up in this way.
Et est, ut accipias formicas magnorum capitum.	And is, so that you take big-headed ants.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, et pone formicam unam ex eis quae habeant os apertum super duo labia uulneris.	Then gather together the two lips of the wound, and place one ant on them, which has an open mouth on the two lips of the wound.
Cum ergo capit super ea, et stringit os suum, abscinde caput eius, adhaeret enim, et non soluitur.	So when you lift it up over them, and tie his mouth: a knot is tied in it, for it clings to them and does not untie itself.
Deinde pone formicam aliam prope primam, et non cesses facere illud cum formica post formicam secundum quantitatem uulneris totius.	Then place another worm near the first, and do not cease to make that worm move after the second quantity of wounds on the whole body.
Deinde reduc ipsum, et sue uulnus.	Then reduce the wound, and apply the poultice.
Illa enim capita remanent annexa in Intestino, donec cibetur Intestinum, et sanetur, et non accidat infirmo nocumentum penitus.	For those remaining heads attached to the intestine, until the intestine is fed, and heals, and does not cause any harm to the whole body.
Et iam possibile est, ut ligetur Intestinum etiam cum filo subtili: quod abstersum est ex intestino animalis, annexo cum eo postquam intromittitur in acum.	And it is also possible that the intestine be tied together as well with a thin thread: which is taken from the animal's intestine, attached to it when it is inserted into the wound.
Et est, ut accipias extremitatem huius fili ex intestino, et excarnetur multum.	And it is, so that you take the end of this thread from the intestine, and let there be a lot of flesh removed.
Deinde liga in extremitate eius filum lini subtile inuolutum.	Then tie the end of this thread with a thin piece of linen.
Deinde intromitte illud filum in acum, et sue cum eo intestinum.	Then insert that thread into the wound, and apply it to the intestine.
Deinde reduc ipsum in disruptionem.	Then reduce the wound to the dissection.
Et iste modus suturae cum formicis et intestino, non est nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	And this method of suturing with the worm and the intestine is not anything but second to the first in trust and hope.
Scias, uulnus quod est magnum, amplum, praecipue si est in uno intestinorum gracilium: tunc non est ingenium nisi subtiliatio, neque est eius sanatio omnino.	Know that the wound which is large and broad, especially if it is in one of the thin intestines: then it is not a skill unless it is a delicate operation, nor is its healing at all certain.
¶ De cura Zuchemen, et Fistularum.	The care for Zochaemen, and Fistulae.
Caput LXXXVIII.	Head LXXVIII.
Scias, quod omne uulnus, aut apostema quando ueterascit et antiquatur, et fit ulcus, et non consolidatur, et emittit pus semper, et non abscinditur: tunc nominatur uniuersaliter in quocunque membro fuerit Fistula, et nos nominamus ipsum Zuchemen.	Know that all wound, or ulcer when it is old and aged, and turns into a sore, and does not heal, and always discharges pus, and does not close: then it is called generally in any member a Fistula, and we call it by that name Zochaemen.
Et Fistula quidem est secundum ueritatem nodatio filtrata, dura, alba: cum qua non est dolor, cui est concauitas pennae auis: et propter illud nominant eam quidam Risati, id est, pennam.	And a Fistula is indeed by the bitterness of an ulcer, hard, white: which does not cause pain, with which the feathers are bent inwards: and for that reason it is called by some Risati, that is to say, feather.
Et est in quibusdam horis humida, quae emittit pus.	And it is in certain hours moist, which discharges pus.
Et fortasse scinditur humiditas in quibusdam horis.	And perhaps it is broken up by moisture at certain times.
Et quandoque est haec humiditas multa, et est pauca: et est grossa, et est subtilis.	And when this moisture is much, and it is little; and it is thick, and it is fine.
Et ego iam praemisi in diuisione, tunc cum dixi uulnera, quod omne ulcus quod non sanatur, neque nascitur in eo caro, non est illud nisi propter unam nouem caussarum.	And I have already pre-empted in the division, then when I said wounds, that any wound which does not heal, nor is born in it flesh, is not this but only because of a new cause of diseases.
Quarum una est, aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore: aut propter maliciam eius: aut quoniam inter ipsum, et super labia eius est caro dura, prohibens natiuitatem carnis: aut quia est multae sordis et sordiciei: aut quoniam ulcus in seipso est putridum, et materia quae mittitur ei est malae qualitatis: aut quoniam medicina est inconueniens in curatione eius: aut quoniam corruptio cadens in regione est genus pestilentiae, aut per proprietatem in regione, sicut accidit in Caesaraugusta: in qua fit difficilis digestio aegritudinum, et tardatur in ea sanatio apostematum per naturam: aut quoniam in eo est os unum, aut numerus ossium.	Of which one is because of the scarcity of blood in the body; or because of the malice of it; or because it is between itself and on its lips hard flesh, preventing the birth of flesh; or because it has much dirt and filth; or because the wound is putrid within itself, and the matter that is cast out of it is bad quality; or because the cure is inconsistent with its cure; or because the corruption falling in the region is a kind of pestilence, or by virtue of the region, as happened in Caesaraugusta: for in this it is difficult to digest diseases, and healing is delayed in it by nature's means: or because there is only one jaw, or because the number of bones.
Et ego iam ostendi omnes istas caussas et signa earum, et curationes ipsarum cum medicinis in diuisione: et oportet hic ut faciam te scire curationem Fistulae et Zuken, quae fit per uiam operationis cum manu.	And I have already shown all the stations and causes and signs of them, and their cures with doctors in a division: and it is necessary here that I should tell you about the cure of the fistula and the zuken, which is done by means of an operation with the hand.
Scias ergo, quod Fistula accidit in omnibus membris corporis.	You must know that the fistula happens in all the members of the body.
Nam ex eis sunt Fistulae quae perueniunt ad uenas magnas et arterias, aut neruos, aut sifac: aut ad intestinum, aut ad uesicam, aut ad aliquam ex costis: aut ad aliquam ex spondilibus dorsi, aut ad aliquam iuncturarum compositarum compositione: sicut manus, et pedis: et ex eis sunt quae uadunt ad propinquitatem membri principalis, et similium.	For from them are the fistulas that reach to great veins and arteries, or nerves, or to the intestines, or to the urinary bladder, or to some of the ribs: or to some of the vertebral bones, or to some of the joints made up: like the hands and feet: and from them are those that reach to the proximity of the main member, and similar.
Quae ergo ex his Fistulis est secundum hunc modum, est ex aegritudinibus difficilis sanationis, et non recipit curationem, et occupatio cum ea est labor et ignorantia.	Which of these fistulas is difficult to heal from this illness, and does not receive a cure, and the occupation with it is work and ignorance. Et quod in illis est sanguinis interius, et materiola putrida mittitur, et per eam uel male uel mediocrem curare possumus: sicut in fistula que facit inter nervum occipitulos, cuius causae sunt capite oribus, et torqu
Quod si est ex Fistulis aliqua cuius profunditas non peruenit ad haec loca quae dixi: et speras, et confidis in curatione eius, et uis peruenire ad cognitionem illius, tunc accipe tentam ex aere, aut ferro, si Fistula tendit secundum rectitudinem, et perquire eam cum ipsa.	If it is from fistulas of whose depth does not reach these places which I said: and you hope and trust in its cure, and you see to the understanding of it, then take a trial from air or iron if the fistula runs according to the right way, and examine it with itself.
Si autem in Fistula est tortuositas, tunc inuestiga eam cum tenta de plumbo subtili.	But if there is a curvature in the fistula, then investigate it with a thin lead probe.
Quoniam plumbum cum lenitate sui corporis alleuiatur, et curuatur circa tortuositatem.	For lead, with its gentle alleviation of one's own body, and its curative power concerning curvature.
Quod si Fistula est habens orificia multa, non est tibi possibile ut significes super eam cum tenta.	That if the fistula has many openings, it is not possible for you to indicate it with a probe.
Clisteriza ergo ex eis orificium ex orificiis suis.	Therefore let one inspect the openings from among its openings.
Nam humiditas qua clisterizas ipsum, uadit uersus orificia alia, et currit ex eis.	For because of the moisture that clisterizes him, it examines towards other openings, and it runs out of them.
Deinde exquisite inquire secundum quem modum est tibi possibile: ut cognoscas quod illic est os, aut neruus, et est Fistulae concauitas longinqua, aut propinqua: aut est Fistula una cui sunt orificia multa, et sta super totum illud, cum summa fortitudinis tuae: cum interrogatione tua, qua interrogas infirmum, et inuentione doloris apud compressionem cum manu tua super locum, et similibus ex significationibus et caussis accidentibus apostemati.	Then ask to inquire after the manner by which it is possible for you: that you may know that there is a mouth, or a nerve, and that the fistula runs distant or near: or that the fistula is one of whose openings are many, and that it stands over all of them, with your greatest strength: when your inquiry, that you interrogate the sick, and your finding of pain at compression with your hand on the place, and similar indications and causes of accidents apostemated.
Cum ergo steteris super omnia illa statione uera, tunc uade ad curationem secundum confidentiam: et est, ut consideres tunc, si est Fistula propinqua apparens, aut in loco saluo longinquo a iunctura, aut a neruo, aut arteria, aut uena, aut uno locorum quae dixi tibi: tunc seca Fistulam secundum quod praemissum est ex narratione mea, et aufer quod est in ea ex filtratione, et carnibus corruptis, quod nascitur in orificio eius ex carne, aut thelul, et similibus: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	When then you stand by all of those stations with a true stance, then proceed to cure according to your confidence: and it is, when you consider then, if the fistula is near apparent, or in a healthy place distant from the junction, or from a nerve, or an artery, or a vein, or one of the places which I said to you: then dry up the fistula according to what was preceded in my narrative, and remove whatever is in it from filtration, and corrupted meats, which grows in its orifice out of flesh, or a tendon, and similar things: and cure it, until it heals.
Si autem Fistula est longinquae profunditatis, et est secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut seces eam in profundo quantum est tibi possibile.	But if the fistula is of a deep distance, and runs according to the right way: then it is necessary that you separate it in the depth as far as it is possible for you.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex omnibus carnibus eius corruptis.	Then wash it with all its corrupted flesh.
Deinde administra licinia inuoluta in medicinis acutis: et intromitte ea usque ad concauitatem Fistulae quam comprehendisti cum ferro: fac cum ea illud aliquotiens, donec corrodat medicina acuta totum quod remansit in concauitate Fistulae ex corruptione.	Then administer the poultice of vinegar mixed with acute medicines: and insert it until the fistula which you have confined with iron is closed; do this several times, until the acute medicine has completely eaten away what remains in the closure of the fistula from the corruption.
Deinde restaura ipsam cum unguentis quae generant carnem sanam, donec sanetur.	Then restore it with ointment which generates healthy flesh, until it heals.
Si uero non sanatur per illud, tunc cauteriza ipsam secundum quod narrauimus.	If it does not heal with this, then cauterize it according to what we have described.
Si ergo caussa Fistulae est os, et certificatur apud te illud: tunc inquire ipsum, et seca ipsum secundum quod narraui tibi: si non prohibet te aliquid ex uena, aut neruo, aut membro principali, sicut diximus.	If the cause of the fistula is an orifice, and you have confirmed this to me: then examine it, and dry it up according to what I have told you: if it does not permit you to do anything of the new tissue, or nerve, or main member, as we have said.
Si ergo detegitur tibi os, et est in eo quiddam corruptionis, et nigredinis: tunc rade ipsum, donec auferatur corruptio eius tota.	If an orifice is discovered on you and there is some corruption and blackening: then shave it, until all the corruption is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for the flesh with whatever will heal the flesh, until it heals.
Quod si non sanatur, et emittat pus sicut faciebat: tunc scias, quod tu non peruenisti ad totam eradicationem corruptionis.	That if it does not heal, and it discharges pus as it did before: then you should know that you have not completely removed the corruption.
Detege ergo super illud secundo, et exquisite fac rasionem eius, et mundificationem ipsius cum ultima fortitudine tua.	Therefore examine it again with a scalpel, and feel whether there is any resistance to the razoring of flesh, and wash it thoroughly with your last strength of cleansing.
Deinde restaura ipsum.	Then restore it.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est: et si non, tunc scias quod illa corruptio est in profunditate longinqua corporis, quam non es consecutus.	If it heals well, then that is good; and if not, then you should know that that corruption is deep within the body, to which you have not gained access.
Non est ergo tibi in ea ingenium, nisi dimittere ipsam naturae.	It is therefore not your work, unless you let nature take its course with it.
Quod si corruptum est os paruum, et est possibile tibi, attrahe ipsum cum forficibus subtilibus quae conueniunt ad illud.	That if the corruption is in a small orifice, and it is possible for you, attract it with subtle hooks which are appropriate for it.
Si autem sunt ossa multa, tunc exquisite fac attractionem eorum omnium, neque dimittas ex eis aliquid cum tua fortitudine.	If there are many bones, then feel whether all of them can be attracted, and do not let anything go with your strength.
Si uero contrarietatem facit tibi aliquid ex humiditatibus, et non est in incisione eorum timor, uel error: tunc incide illas humiditates et carnes, si sunt illic, et libera ossa.	If anything that you are attracting from moisture causes you any difficulty, or there is any error or doubt in cutting them, then cut the moisture and flesh, if they are there, and free the bones.
Si uero non est tibi praeparatio auferendi ossa ex hora tua, tunc pone super uulnus quod putrefaciat ipsum: et dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat quod est in circumitu illorum ossium ex carnibus et humiditatibus.	If indeed you are not prepared to remove bones from your body at the right time, then place them on the limb that should decay; and let go of them until they decay, as they decay around those bones from flesh and moisture.
Et custodi uulnus ut non consolidetur.	And guard the bone so that it does not harden.
Et constringatur sectio quam tu secuisti in operatione tua.	And let the incision that you followed in your operation heal.
Imo pone super ipsum, si times, cotum submersum sulfure trito cum oleo: aut cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio, aut aliquo unguentorum uiridium.	Then place on top of the bone, if you wish, three times soaked in sulfur with oil: or three times soaked in Egyptian ointment, or some other ointment.
Nam quando putrefient illae scilicet humiditates, et separantur ex eis ossa, alleuiatur ablatio eorum, et ipsorum attractio.	For when those humors begin to decay and the bones separate from them, it is a relief to remove them, and their attraction to each other.
Si autem est os unum magnum, sicut os cruris, aut os coxae, et similia illis, et quod ex eo corruptum est, est pars magna: tunc rade ipsum rasione ultima, donec auferatur illa nigredo et corruptio.	But if it is a large bone, such as a thigh or hip bone, and similar ones, and one that has decayed, then make the incision with a last cut until it is removed, until the decay and blackening are gone.
Deinde restaura uulnus.	Then restore the limb.
Si uero quod est in eo corruptum, est pars magna, et corruptio iam consecuta est medullam ossis, tunc necesse est serrare ipsum, et incidere ipsum totum usque ad locum, ubi peruenit corruptio: tunc cura ipsum, donec consolidetur.	But if that which is decayed in it is a large part, and the decay has already reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to cut it off, and to make an incision all the way to the place where the decay begins: then care for it until it hardens.
Et ego narro tibi zuken, quae accidit uiro in crure suo: ut ponas ipsam exemplum et adiutorium super operationem tuam.	And I will tell you the story of the man who had a leg infection. So that it might serve as an example and a help for your operation,
Fuit uir iuuenis aetate circiter triginta annos, cui accidit dolor in crure suo, a caussa quae mota est super ipsum intra corpus, id est, ab interioribus, donec peruenerunt materiae ad crus, et apostematum est apostemate magno: et non fuit ei caussa extrinseca.	He was a young man of about thirty years of age, who had a pain in his leg, due to a growth that had risen up from within the body, that is, from inside, until it reached the flesh, and caused a large boil: but there was no external cause.
Extensum est ergo cum eo tempus cum errore medicorum, donec apertum est apostema, et concurrerunt cum eo materiae multae.	So when the time came with an error of the doctors, until it opened up and many fluids came out.
Et postposita est curatio eius, donec fistulatum est crus, et facta sunt in eo orificia multa: quae omnia emittebant pus, et humiditates corporis.	And his treatment was postponed until his leg was wrapped up, and many holes were made in him: all of which discharged pus and body fluids.
Curauit ergo ipsum multitudo medicorum circiter duos annos, et non fuit in eo sapiens in arte manus, donec uocatus sum, et uidi crus eius, et materias quae currebant ex illis orificiis cursu magno: etiam omne uiri corpus iam tabuerat, et color eius citrinus erat.	Therefore many physicians had dealt with him for about two years, and there was no wise man in the art of hands until I was called, and saw his wound, and the materials that flowed out of those orifices with a great course: also all his body was already dismembered, and his color was citrine.
Intromisi ergo tentam in uno locorum orificiorum, et peruenit tenta ad os.	So I inserted my hand into one of the orifices, and it came to the mouth.
Deinde perscrutatus sum orificia omnia: et inueni ea peruenire ad se inuicem ex omnibus partibus cruris.	Then I scrutinized all the orifices, and found them to pour out into one another on every side of the limb.
Properaui ergo, et secui super unum illorum orificiorum, donec detexi partem ossis: et inueni ipsum corruptum: quod iam corrosum erat, et denigratum, et putruerat, et perforatum erat, donec penetrauerat usque ad medullam.	Then I dished it up, and followed one of the orifices until I detected part of the bone: and I found it to be corroded: which was already corroded, and blackened, and rotted, and pierced, until it penetrated all the way into the marrow.
Serraui ergo quod detectum est mihi, et praeparatum ex osse corrupto.	Then I sharpened what I had detected, and prepared it from corrupt bone.
Et deputaui, quod non esset in osse nisi illa corruptio, quam abscidi, et serraui.	And I sheared off what was not in the bone except that corruption, which I could scrape off and sharpen.
Et ego iam eradicaueram eam.	And I had already scraped it off.
Deinde posui restaurationem uulneris cum medicinis consolidatiuis spacio longo.	Then I placed the wound with medical consolidates, spaced out in a long area.
Et non est consolidatum.	And this was not consolidated.
Deinde tentaui, et detexi super os secundo supra detectionem primam: et inueni corruptionem continuam cum osse: et serraui quod apparuit mihi etiam ex illa corruptione.	Then I inserted my hand again, and detected it on top of the first detection: and I found a continuous corruption with bone, and sharpened what was evident to me from that corruption as well.
Deinde conatus sum restaurationem eius.	Then I tried to restore it.
Et non est restauratum.	And this was not restored.
Detexi ergo super ipsum iterum, et non cessaui incidere os particulatim, et conari restaurationem eius: et non est restauratum, donec incidi ex osse circiter palmum unum, et extraxi illud cum medulla sua.	Then I detected on top of the limb again, and did not cease to cut the bone in pieces, and try to restore it: and this was not restored until I cut from the bone a palm-length piece, and extracted it with its marrow.
Deinde restauraui ipsum cum medicinis, et consolidatum est uelociter, et sanatum: et non fuit necessaria haec iteratio in operatione eius, et sectione ipsius, nisi propter dispositionem debilitatis infirmi, et paucitatem tolerantiae eius, et timorem meum super ipsum de morte: quoniam accidebat ei in omnibus horis ex superfluitate euacuationis syncopis mala.	Then I restored it with medical consolidates, and it healed quickly, and was cured: and this iteration in the operation, and cutting of itself, would not have been necessary but for the weakness of the nurse, and her lack of tolerance, and my fear over it dying: for it happened to him at all times from excessive bleeding during a syncopes.
Sanatus est ergo sanatione integra: et nata est in loco ossis caro dura, et bona facta est dispositio in corpore suo, et rediit uirtus eius: et conuersatus est in dispositionibus suis: et non fecit ei contrarietatem in ambulatione nocumentum omnino.	He was therefore whole in his healing: and a new bone grew in the place of the old one, and good order was established in his body, and his strength returned; and he continued in his habits: and he did not cause him any harm at all in his walking.
Si autem os eminens in loco corporis iam fractum est: tunc oportet ut serres ipsum, secundum hunc modum: et est: ut accipias ligamentum, et stringe ipsum in extremitate ossis eminentis: et praecipe alicui, qui extendat ipsum ad sursum: et pone ligamentum aliud ex lana grossius ligamento primo.	But if the jaw is broken high up in the body already: then it should be closed by this means: that you take a piece of rope and tighten it at the end of the prominent bone; and you order someone to stretch it upwards: and you place another piece of rope, thicker than the first one, under the first.
Deinde liga ipsum super carne, quae est suh osse: et extende extremitatem eius, ut trahas carnem ad inferiora: et tu detegis carnem super locum quem uis serrare, ut non laedat Serra carnem.	Then tie the wound over the flesh which is next to the bone; and extend the end of it, so that you pull the flesh down from below: and then you cover the place where you want to close it up, so that the flesh does not hurt when you cut it.
Pone lignum, aut tabulam sub osse inferius decenter: quoniam quando facis illud, non prohibetur quin secet carnem corruptam.	Place a piece of wood or a board under the bone from below: because when you do this, it does not hurt the corrupted flesh.
Et oportet ut sit Serratura super locum corruptum parumper, ut non sit in concauitate ossis corruptio: et non appareat in apparitione sua sensui, et cogat ad Serraturam sui uice alia.	And it should be so that there is a little space over the corrupted flesh, so that the bone does not appear in its appearance; and it does not seem to feel any pain: and it pushes at its own will towards another closure.
Quod si os est corruptum, et non est eminens, imo continuatur pars eius cum parte: et corruptio est in medio eius, aut in parte ipsius: tunc detege carnem ab omnibus partibus totam.	That if the bone is corrupted and not prominent, a part of it continues with another part; and the corruption is in the middle of it or in one of its parts: then you cover all the flesh completely.
Deinde pone lignum inferius.	Then place a piece of wood below.
Postea serra illud ex parte prima, ubi est corruptio, donec continuetur Serratura ex parte altera: et sit Serratura secundum longitudinem a corruptione parumper, secundum quod diximus.	Then close that part from the first where there is corruption until it continues in another part; and let the closure be at a little distance from the corruption in length as we have said.
Quod si corruptio est in iunctura, incide ipsam iuncturam corruptam, et serra os ubi continuatur ex parte altera.	That if the corruption is in the joint, then cut that joint which is corrupted, and close the bone where it continues from the other part.
Si uero corruptio est in continuatione duarum iuncturarum, tunc non est in ea ingenium nisi abrasio.	But if the corruption is in the connection of two joints, then there is no sense of touch in it but only abrasion.
Quod si corruptio est in pectine manus, aut in pectine pedis: tunc res in eo est difficilis ualde.	That if the corruption is in the palm of the hand or in the sole of the foot: then the matter in it is difficult to do much with.
Verum oportet, ut inquiras corruptionem qualiter appareat tibi.	It is true that you should inquire how corruption appears to you.
Et abradas eam, et mundes ipsam secundum quamcunque dispositionem tibi possibile est, et cum quocunque ingenio rectificatur tibi: quando non facit tibi contrarietatem Vena, aut Neruus.	And cut off that part and clean it up in whatever way is possible for you, and with whatever skill you possess: when it does not give you a contrasting vein or nerve.
Et scias quod incisoria, et Serrae ad incidendum ista ossa sunt multa, secundum situm ossium, et praparationem eorum, et ipsorum grossitudinem, et subtilitatem eorum, et magnitudinem, et paruitatem ipsorum, et duriciem ipsorum, et eorum raritatem.	And know that many tools and saws are used to cut these bones depending on the position of the bones, and their preparation, and their thickness and fineness, and their size and smoothness, and their rarity.
Quapropter oportet, ut praepares omni speciei operationis instrumentum conueniens ad illam operationem.	Therefore it is necessary that you prepare the instrument suitable for any type of operation.
Et scias, quod operationes istae significant tibi super speciem instrumenti quo indiges, quando tecum est studium longum.	And know that these operations require a long study when you hold the instrument in your hand.
Et cognitio modorum huius artis, testimonium modorum aegritudinum: tunc enim iam inuenies per teipsum illud quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis ad omnem infirmitatem.	And the knowledge of these methods will be a witness to your skills; for then you will have found out by yourself what is suitable for each disease and disorder.
Et ego sum firmans tibi in ultimo huius capituli numerum instrumentorum, quae pones exempla super quae incides, et probationem qua experiaris super alia.	And I am confirming to you at the end of this chapter the number of instruments, which you should present as examples for those that you cut and test by your own experience on others.
Forma Serrae.	The form of a saw.
Forma alterius Serrae.	The form of another saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	The form of a third saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	The form of a fourth saw.
Haec forma Serrae depicta, sit decenter facta.	This is the drawing of the above-described saw.
Fiat arcus eius superior, acuitas eius ex ferro: et manubrium eius ex buxo, et sit pyramidale decenter factum.	Let it be made with an arch at its top and sharpness from steel: and its handle from beech, and let it be made with a pyramid-like angle at its base.
Forma Rasorii iuncturarum.	The form of the blade that cuts with ease.
Sit caput huius Rasorii, secundum formam capitis claui stellati: et puncta eius sint secundum formam punctorum elischetfegi.	Let the head of this razor be made in the shape of a star-shaped claw: and its edges be made in the form of an ellipse.
Et non conuenit, nisi ut fricentur cum eo capita iuncturarum, quando corrumpuntur, aut os amplum, et magnum est.	And it is not suitable unless it rubs with the head of the razor when it rusts, or has a wide and large opening.
Forma maioris Rasorii.	The form of a larger razor.
Forma medii Rasorii.	The form of a medium-sized razor.
Forma Rasorii lati.	The form of a wide razor.
Forma Rasorii in quo est concauitas.	The form of the closed razor.
Forma Rasorii alterius subtilis.	Form of a razor other thin.
Forma Rasorii alterius curuatae extremitatis.	Form of a razor other curved extreme.
Forma Rasorii parui, subtilis tentae.	Form of a razor smooth, thin edge.
Forma Rasorii cum quo inciduntur ossa.	Form of a razor with which bones are incised.
Forma etiam Rasorii magni.	Form also of a razor large.
Hoc similatur Radio, et extremitas est sicut Serra: exhibetur in locis multis ex rasione ossium.	This is similar to a Razor, and the end is like an edge of a saw: it is exhibited in many places from the incision of bones.
Forma Rasorii quod conuenit ad rasionem eius quod perforatum est ex ossibus.	Form of a razor that comes together with its incision which has been pierced through from the bones.
Extremitas eius triangula, acutarum est extremitatum.	The end of it is triangular, acute at the ends.
Fit ex Indi.	Fit from India.
Et similiter oportet, ut fiant omnia quae diximus ex Rasoriis, et Incisoriis, et Serris.	And also let everything that we have said about razors, incisers, and saws be.
¶ De incisione extremitatum, et Serratura ossium.	On the incision of ends, and fastening of bones.
Caput LXXXIX.	Head 89.
Putrefiunt extremitates, aut ex caussa extrinseca, aut intrinseca.	The ends putrefy, or for an external cause, or an internal one.
Cum ergo medicatus fueris illam corruptionem curatione medicinarum, et non confert curatio: et uides corruptionem incidere in membrum, quam non repercutit aliquid: tunc oportet ut incidas illud membrum usque ubi consequitu corruptio, ut euadat infirmus per illud a morte, aut a malicia quae est maior defectu membri.	But when the patient has been cured of the corruption by the medicine of medicines, and there is no cure: and you see that the corruption incises on the member, which does not affect anything: then it should be incised on that member until where the consequence of corruption goes, so that the sick person may be healed through it from death, or from a worse defect of the member.
Et signum cui accidit illud est, quod denigratur membrum, donec putetur: quod ignis combussit ipsum, aut putrefit post nigredinem: donec inciditur illa putredo usque ad illud quod sequitur illud membrum, et serpit in totum corpus.	And the sign of what has happened to it is that the member is ruined, until it is healed: which burns itself up, or腐敗s after decay: until it incises on that which follows it on the member, and grows into all the body.
Propera ergo cum incisione eius, et similiter si caussa corruptionis est a percussione quorundam uenenosorum: sicut scorpionis marini, et uiperae, et rutellae, et similium.	Place then with its incision, and likewise if the cause of corruption is from pounding of some fruits: as of sea-scorpions, and flies, and nettles, and others similar.
Si ergo corruptio, aut percussio est in extremitate digiti, tunc incide digitum, et non des spacium corruptioni, ut incedat usque ad reliquam manum.	But if the corruption or pounding is at the end of a finger, then cut off the finger, and not leave space for the corruption, so that it may incise all the way to the remaining hand.
Et similiter si accidit in manu, tunc incide eam ex radice focilis, et non des spacium corruptioni, donec capiat in focili brachii.	And likewise if it has happened in the hand, then cut off from the root of a fire-steel, and not leave space for the corruption, until it takes hold in the arm of the steel.
Et si inuadit in eo, tunc incide brachium apud cubitum in iunctura sua.	And if he has broken it, then cut the arm at the shoulder in its joint.
Si autem pertransit corruptio, et uides eum circiter cubitum: tunc in illo est mors infirmi.	If, however, it is a fracture and you see that he has gone all around the shoulder: then death is imminent for him.
Et administrare praeter illud ex curatione, est quantitas uirtus.	And besides that cure, the amount of strength is necessary.
Et similiter fac de pede, quando inuadit corruptio in digito, tunc incide ipsum apud unum nodorum: et si capit in pectine pedis, tunc incide pedem totum.	And likewise do for the foot, when there is a fracture in the toe, then cut it at the joint: and if he catches in the nail, then cut the whole foot.
Si autem ascendit ad genu, tunc incide crus apud iuncturam genu.	If, however, he has climbed up to the knee, then cut the leg at the knee joint.
Quod si corruptio iam peruenit supra genu, tunc non est in ea ingenium, nisi dimissio, et relinquere infirmum morti.	That if the fracture has already reached above the knee, then there is no hope of recovery, unless amputation and forsake the sick to death.
Et modus incidendi membrum, aut serrandi ipsum est, ut stringas ligamentum in inferiori, quem uis incidere: et stringe ligamentum aliud supra locum.	And the way to cut a limb off, or to break it is, to hold the lower ligament tight, which you want to cut: and tighten another ligament above that place.
Et extendat minister ligamentum unum ad inferiora: et extendat minister aliud ligamentum superius ad sursum.	And stretch one minister of the ligaments downward: and stretch another minister of the ligaments upward upward.
Et tu separa carnem quae est inter duo ligamenta, cum Spatumili lato, donec detegatur caro tota.	And you shall separate the flesh that is between the two ligaments with the chisel widely, until all the flesh is discovered.
Deinde incidatur, aut serretur.	Then cut it, or break it.
Et oportet, ut ponas ab omnibus partibus pannum lini, et non tangat Serra locum sanum: et accidat infirmo laesio addita, et apostema calidum.	And it should be that you put all the parts of a cloth, so that the saw does not touch the healthy place: and cut the lame with added heat, and put on poultices.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis interius dum operaris, tunc cauteriza locum uelociter: aut pone super ipsum quosdam pulueres abscindentes sanguinem.	If, however, there is a flow of blood inwards while you are working, then burn the place quickly: or put on some powder that stops the blood.
Deinde redi ad medicationem tuam, donec compleatur.	Then turn to your own cure, until it is complete.
Deinde liga membrum uulneratum cum ligamento conueniente ei, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then bind the wounded limb with a fitting ligament, and cure it, until it heals.
Et ego narro tibi quod accidit uiro in pede suo, hoc idem accidens quod narro tibi.	And I will tell you what happened to the man in his foot, this same thing that I told you.
Quod est, quia accidit in pede suo nigredo, cum adustione quae assimilatur combustioni ignis: et corruptio illa in primis accidit in digito suo, donec coepit pedem totum.	That is, because it happened to the man's foot, a blackness that resembles the burning of fire: and that corruption first occurred in his toe, until it covered his whole foot.
Properauit ergo uir ex seipso, postquam uidit corruptionem incidere in membro cum uehementia eius, quod inuenit ex dolore, et adustione eius: et incidit ipsum apud iuncturam, et sanatus est.	Therefore the boy recovered from the pus, after he saw the corruption affect his member with a great deal of pain and a change in its color; and it infected him at the joint, and he was healed.
Et postquam praeteriit ei tempus longum, accidit ei illa eadem corruptio in digito manus suae indice.	And after a long time had passed, the same corruption happened to him in the third finger of his right hand.
Venit ergo ad me, et conatus sum recuperare illam superfluitatem cum eo quod posui super manum ex medicinis post mundificationem corporis eius: et non repercussa est superfluitas, et coepit incedere in digitum alium: donec coepit coruptio in manum.	So he came to me, and I tried to heal the excess with him when I put on his hand from the medicines after purifying his body: and the excess did not respond, and it began to hurt again in another finger; until the corruption began to affect his hand.
Vocauit ergo me, ad incidendum manum eius: et nolui illud, sperans ex me super repercussionem illius superfluitatis: et timui etiam super ipsum apud incisionem manus eius mortem.	He called me to cut his hand off: and I would not do it, hoping from me regarding the excess response: and I was also afraid of death by cutting his hand off next to the incision.
Quoniam uirtus uiri erat super casum.	Because the strength of the boy was above dying.
Postquam ergo desperauit de me, reuersus est ad terram suam: et peruenit ad me de eo, quia properauit, et incidit manum suam totam: et sanatus est.	And after he was disappointed from me, he returned to his land: and he came to me about it, because he wanted to recover, and he cut off all his hand: and he was healed.
Et non attuli hanc narrationem, nisi ut sit adiutorium super illud quod cadit de genere huius aegritudinis: et ut sit significatio qua significetur, et secundum quam agatur.	And I did not bring this account unless it be an aid to that which falls from the kind of this disease: and to show what means, and according to what happens.
¶ De cura Sinuum, et qualitate clisterizationis cum medicinis.	Regarding the care of abscesses, and the quality of the clisterization with medicines.
Caput XC.	Chapter XC.
Quando accidit apostema in quibusdam membris carnosis, et prolongatur spacium apostematis, donec collectionem facit saniei: deinde rumpitur, aut perforatur, et egreditur quod in eo est ex sanie, et remanet locus uacuus quasi sit uas: et cutis quae est super ipsum sicut pannus qui iam subtiliatus est: et non peruenit ad ultimum in corruptione sua, neque imprimit in os, neque in neruum, neque in ligamentum: meretur ut nominetur Sinus: et non nominatur Fistula: uerumtamen si prolongatur spacium eius, donec imprimat corruptio in aliquid horum membrorum, tunc nominatur Fistula, aut zuken.	When an abscess happens to be in some fleshy member, and the abscess lasts long, until it collects pus: then it bursts, or pierces, and that which is in it comes out, and there remains a hollow place like a pit: and the skin that is over it is as thin cloth: and does not spread to the last degree of corruption, nor imprisons into the mouth, the nerves, or the ligaments: it deserves to be called a sinus: but does not carry the name of a fistula: nevertheless, if it prolongs its space, until it impresses corruption in some of these members, then it is called a fistula, or a sore.
Et cura eius est, ut incidas illam cutem totam sicut reuoluitur: et praecipue quando subtiliata est, et facta sicut pannus: et confidis quia non aaehaeret cum loco, propter corruptionem suam.	And the cure is that you should strike off his whole skin like a sleeve; and especially when it has become thin, and made like a sheet of cloth; and believe that it will not stick to the place because of its corruption.
Si autem speras quod adhaereat cutis, et non consequitur ex eo corruptio illa ultima consecutione: et si in cute est spissitudo ex carne, tunc cura ipsum cum Clisteri: et est, ut consideres ad Sinum.	But if you hope that the skin will stick and that that corruption will not come to pass at the last consequence: and if there is a thickness of flesh on the skin, then cure him with clister; and consider towards the neck.
Tunc si est magnus, et pus quod emittitur ex eo est foetidi odoris: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum medicamine aegyptio, quod est aceti, et olei, et ziniar, partes recipiens aequales, aggregentur in uase: et decoquantur super ignem, donec rubeat medicamen: et ueniat in spissitudinem mellis.	Then if it is large, and the pus that is discharged from it has a foul odor: then clisterize him with Egyptian medicine, which is vinegar, and oil, and myrrh, taking equal parts, mixed together in a vessel; and let them boil on the fire, until the medicine reddens; and let it come to a syrup.
Deinde accipe ex eo quod tibi necesse est: et dissolue ipsum cum aqua et melle, et clisteriza cum eo Sinum: et stringe orificium eius, et dimitte medicinam in eo ad quantitatem duarum horarum.	Then take from it what you need; and dissolve it with water and honey, and clisterize it with him with the sin; and tighten the orifice of it, and let the medicine flow into it for two hours.
Deinde extrahe ipsum cum expressione: fac illud diebus tot, donec mundificetur Sinus, et remoueatur foetor.	Then extract him with the expression; let him be for days until the sin is clean, and the smell is gone.
Et quandoque clisterizatur cum aqua cineris, quando non est tibi praesens hoc medicamen: et est, ut accipias cinerem lignorum uitis, aut cinerem ex lignis ilicis: et proiicias super eam aquam.	And when you clisterize it with water of ash, when this medicine is not present with you; and is, that you should take the ash of oak wood, or the ash of oak; and throw it on the water.
Deinde cola eam, et clisteriza cum ea, donec confidas quod Sinus iam ablutus est.	Then boil it, and clisterize it with it, until you believe that the sin is now washed away.
Quod si infirmo non est tolerantia super medicamen aegyptium, neque aquam cineris, tunc clisteriza ipsum cum aqua et melle, cui iam permixtum est aliquid ex ziniar contrito.	That if the sick person does not tolerate Egyptian medicine or water of ash, then clisterize him with water and honey, to which has already been added some crushed myrrh.
Aut clisteriza ipsum cum melle et uino permixtis, quoniam de proprietate mellis est, ut mundificet, et abluat: et uinum facit adhaerere Sinum, praecipue quando in uino est superfluitas stipticitatis et siccitatis.	Or clisterize him with honey and wine mixed, for the property of honey is to clean and wash away; and the wine makes the sin adhere, especially when there is an abundance of stimulative and dry.
Cum facis illud aliquotiens, et confidis quod Sinus corruptio iam remota est: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum eo quod facit nasci carnem in eo.	When you have done this sometimes and have trusted that the corruption of the sin has already been removed: then let him make him a clister, with what he does, to bring flesh into him.
Et est, ut accipias ex emplastro dyafinicon: et dissoluas ipsum cum oleo rosato, et uino stiptico: aut clisteriza ipsum cum quibusdam medicinis, et unguentis aliis, quorum proprietates scripsi in tractatu unguentorum.	And it is so that you may take from the plaster dyafinicon: and dissolve him with rose oil, and wine astringent: or make him a clister with certain medicines, and other ointments, whose properties I have written in the book of ointments.
Quod si orificium Sinus est strictum, in quo non capit cannula clisteris: tunc amplifica ipsum cum ferro parumper: aut pone in ipso licinium inuolutum in unguento aegyptio, aut in unguento basilicon, donec amplificetur.	That if the opening of the sinus is strict, in which the tube of the clister does not enter: then enlarge it a little with iron: or put in it the licorice that has been soaked in oil, in Egyptian ointment, or in basilico ointment, until it is enlarged.
Et similiter si est orificium etiam amplum, tunc aggrega labia eius cum sutura: et dimitte ex eo quantitatem in quam ingrediatur clistere sine additione.	And likewise if the opening is also wide, then join the lips together with a stitch: and let go out of it a quantity in which the clister is to be made without adding anything.
Et similiter si orificium eius ex quo currit pus, est eleuatum ad superiora: tunc seca ipsum in depressiori loco qui est in ipso, ut currat ex eo pus usque inferius: quoniam pus quando coartatur in profunditate Sinus, prohibet carnem generari in eo.	And likewise if the opening from which the pus runs is elevated towards the upper part: then dry him up in a lower place that is in him, so that the pus may run down from it: because when the pus is constricted in the depth of the sinus, it prohibits flesh to be generated in it.
Quod si non est tibi possibile secare Sinum circiter inferius eius secundum quod uis: tunc conare, ut praepares membrum praeparatione qua currat ex eo pus cum facilitate secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	That if it is not possible for you to dry the sinus all around below it according to what you want: then try, so that you prepare the member with preparation by which the pus runs out from it with ease according to what is prepared for you.
Conare, ut non retineatur in eo aliquid ex pus omnino: et accipe medicinas consolidatiuas quae ponuntur super signum, conuenientes ad illud quod uis.	Try so that nothing of the pus is left in it at all: and take medicines consolidatio that are placed over the mark, suited to what you want.
Et extende eas super pannum lini.	And spread them on a linen cloth.
Et sit pannus tantae quantitatis, qua fiat communicatio totius Sinus.	And have there such a quantity of cloth that it may communicate with the whole sinus.
Deinde incide cum forficibus in directo orificii Sinus foramen, amplius orificio Sinus parumper.	Then cut with forceps on the direct opening of the sinus hole, a little larger opening of the sinus.
Deinde extende ex unguentis lenibus super pannum alium, secundum quantitatem foraminis: et pone eum super ipsum positione longinqua ab orificio Sinus, ut alleuietur exitus pus ex eo: et non auferas pannum magnum, nisi post dies aliquos uice una.	Then spread on the other cloth with soft ointment according to the quantity of the hole: and put it in a distant position from the opening of the sinus, so that the outlet of the pus may be eased: and do not hold the cloth large, except after some days.
Ille autem qui est super orificium Sinus, est ille quem remoues in omni hora, ut egrediatur quod aggregatur in eo ex pus: et ut scias, an illud quod currit ex eo uirus, est multum, aut parum: aut digestum, aut indigestum.	And yet he who is above the sinus opening, he whom you stir at all times so that he emerges from it with pus: and as you know, the infection that comes out of it is much or little, digested or undigested.
Et cum hoc iterum considera locum Sinus ipsius, an in ipso sentiat dominus eius dolorem, aut non sit in eo dolor, et an sit in eo apostema, aut non sit in eo apostema.	And when you consider this place of the sinus again, whether the master feels pain there or not; and if there is no pain there, and if there is a pus there, or not.
Cum ergo protenditur medicatio tua taliter, et uides materiam quae egreditur super orificium Sinus, tunc scias, quod Sinus iam adhaeret, aut approximat adhaerentiae: tunc ergo solue ipsum in mane, aut in tertio die: et quando soluis uulnus, tunc permuta pannum alium, et renoua unguentum.	When your treatment therefore extends thus far, and you see the matter that comes out above the sinus opening; then know that the sinus is already attached, or approaching attachment: then therefore solve it in the morning, or on the third day; and when you have solved the wound, then change the cloth with another, and renew the unguent.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post spacium longum uirus subtile, tunc non desperes de adhaerentia eius, nam sanatio eius appropinquat, quoniam ex hominibus sunt qui tardant generationem carnis in uulneribus suis, et ex eis sunt qui agunt econtrario illius.	If however the pus comes out of the sinus after a long time, do not despair concerning its attachment, for its healing approaches, since there are people who delay the generation of flesh in their wounds, and there are those who bring it about in the opposite way.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post dies multos pus indigestum, tunc scias quod sinus non adhaeret.	But if the pus comes out of the sinus after many days, then know that the sinus is not attached.
Si ergo tardatur adhaerentia Sinus, et prolongatur res eius: tunc adde in exiccatione medicinarum, uerum faciant medici, ut sint medicinae in substantia sua humidae, et in uirtute sua siccae: sicut unguentum dyafinicon, quando additur in eo superfluitas additionis ex zegi.	But if the attachment of the sinus is delayed and its course is prolonged; then add to the drying up of medicines, that the doctors may make them dry in their substance, and in their power so as to be like the dyphinicon unguent, when added to it in excess of what is necessary from the oil.
Et ex magis ultimo quo curatur, est, ut accipias unguentum dyafinicon, et soluatur cum oleo rosato, et roretur super ipsum uinum antiquum aequale in substantia sua.	And from this last, as regards its treatment, it is that you should take the dyphinicon unguent, and solve it with rose oil, and rub it on the old wound to the same extent as to its substance.
Deinde confice ipsum cum eo, et utere ipso.	Then therefore bind it up with it, and use it.
Et iam facit simile huic actioni, quando non est tibi praesens unguentum dyafinicon, mel, quando decoquis ipsum, donec ingrossetur, et uteris eo.	And this same action is similar to that of the dye-finicon unguent when it is not present with you, and honey when you have decanted it until it thickens, and use it.
Aut accipe myrrham, et aloen, et olibanum: tere totum, et pulueriza illud super mel dum est super ignem.	Take myrrh and aloe and olive oil; let them be thoroughly mixed together and then put on honey while it is still hot above fire.
Deinde line super ipsum pannum, et stringe ipsum super Sinum: et line cum melle quod decoquisti, donec ingrossatum est: et pulueriza super ipsum species, et pone super ipsum pannum, et stringe eum.	Then bind a cloth over the wound and tie it tightly around the sinew: and with the honey that you have prepared, cover the wound until it thickens: and then apply the powder on the wound, and bind it again to the cloth, and tie it up.
Et quandoque administratur in illo aristolochia longa, et radices lilii coelestis, et est lilium: et farina herbi, et centaurea.	And when that is administered in it aristorcia long, and roots of the celestial liliy, and the liliy it self, and herb flour, and centaurea.
Utere eis simplicibus, aut aggregatis, tere ea, et cribella ipsa: et pulueriza super mel quod narraui, et utere eo.	Use either simple or aggregate ingredients, strain it through a sieve, and then apply the powder over the honey that you have poured out: and use it.
Quod si prolongatur res Sinus, et non sanatur hac curatione: tunc scias, quod in profundo eius est corruptio: aut iam facit impressionem in ossibus, aut in reliquis membris duris, aut ligamentis: tunc cura ipsum curatione Fistularum, secundum quod praemissum est.	If it does not heal with this cure: then you will know that there is corruption in its depths: or if it has already made an impression on the bones, or on the other hard parts of the body, or on the ligaments: then treat it with the cure of fistulas, as has been described.
¶ De cura Panaritii et unguis attritae, et incisione digiti additi, et sectione.	Of the cure of the panaritus and the scratched nail, and the cutting of the finger added, and the sectioning.
Caput XCI.	XCI.
Panaritium est apostema quod nascitur sub ungue pollicis manus, aut pedis: et fortasse nascitur in reliquis digitis.	Panaritus is an abscess that comes out under the nail of the thumb or foot, and perhaps also from the other fingers.
Cum ergo prolongatur res eius, et negligitur curato eius, et apostematur apostemate calido: aut corrumpitur, et emittit pus, donec corrodit radicem unguis: et fortasse corrumpit eam totam, et fortasse peruenit corruptio ad os, donec est ei odor foetidus: et fit extremitas digiti lata, et fit color eius fuscus.	When it is then prolonged in its course, and the cure of it is neglected, and an abscess forms under a warm thumb: or if it corrupts, and discharge pus, until it corrupts the nail root: and perhaps it also corrupts all of it, and perhaps it reaches corruption to the mouth, until it has a foul odor: and makes the tip of the finger wide, and makes its color dark.
Quando ergo tu curas ipsum, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut incidas cum ferro totam superfluitatem quae remansit ex ungue.	When you then treat the wound, with what we have said in connection, and your treatment does not bring about a cure: then you must cut off all the excess that is left from the nail.
Deinde cauteriza uulnus post illud.	Then cauterize the nail after that.
Cauterium enim iuuatiuum est ualde.	For the cauterization of the nail, for the wound is hot.
Si uero os est sanum, et est unguis etiam sana, et additiones uacuae unguis iam comprimunt carnem ad interiora, et incipiunt pungere ipsam, et laedunt eam: tunc oportet ut ponas Radium subtilem sub angulo unguis quae pungit carnem, et impelle eam sursum: et incide eam carnem cum facilitate, et pone super illud quod remanet de carne ex medicinis comburentibus, corrosiuis, donec remoueatur totum eius.	If the bone is indeed healthy, and the nail too, and the nail's additions are already compressing the flesh towards the insides, and it begins to sting and hurt: then you should put Radium under the angle of the nail that stings the flesh, and push it upwards: and cut into the flesh with ease, and place on top what remains of the flesh from the burning medicines, until it has all moved away.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for that with the nail, until it heals.
Si autem corruptio iam imprimit in os, tunc oportet ut incidas illud os, et extrahas ipsum: non enim sanatur unquam dum permanet in eo os corruptum.	But if the corruption has already impressed on the bone, then you should cut into that bone and remove it: for it does not heal at all while it remains in it.
Quod si uides corrosionem et corruptionem incedere in digitum, tunc incide eum in uno nodorum, secundum quod praemissa est eius rememoratio.	If you see the corrosion and the corruption penetrating into the finger, then cut it at one of its joints, according to what has been said above in its remembrance.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for that, until it heals.
Si autem accidat ungui attritio, aut percussio: et contingit in ea dolor uehemens, tunc oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	But if there is a pulling or pounding of the nail: and there is a sharp pain in it, then you should let blood from the wounded part at first.
Deinde seca unguem cum Spatumili acuto sectione transuersa de sursum ad uisum.	Then dry the nail with a sharp Spatemile, cutting across from top to bottom.
Et custodi, ne sectio perueniat ad carnem quae est sub ungue, nam tu facies accidere per illud super infirmum dolorem uehementem, et erit caussa ad natiuitatem carnis additae in loco.	And guard it, so that the cutting does not reach the flesh under the nail, for you would make happen through it a very painful pain for the sick person, and it would be a cause of the birth of flesh added in place.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod sedat dolores.	Then care for that place with what sits there pains.
Digitus uero additus qui nascitur in quibusdam manibus hominum, fortasse est carnosus totus: et fortasse sunt in quibusdam eorum ossa, et fortasse est in eo unguis: et quidam eorum nascitur in radice iuncturae, aut est natiuitas eius in quibusdam nodis digiti.	The finger that is added in some hands of men, perhaps is whole of flesh: and perhaps there are bones in it, and perhaps there is a nail in it: and the birth of some of its joints, or the birth of its nail, perhaps is in the knuckle joint, or perhaps it is born in some of the joints of the finger.
Ille ergo qui nascitur in quibusdam nodis digiti, non mouetur: et ille qui nascitur apud iuncturam digiti, fortasse mouetur.	So this that is born in some joints of the finger does not move: and this that is born in the joint of the finger, perhaps moves.
Eius ergo qui ex eis est carnosus, sectio eius facilis est.	Therefore, if he is a man who has flesh, then it is easy to cut him.
Quod est, ut incidas ipsum apud radicem suam cum Spatumili lato.	That is, so that you strike him at the root with a broad knife.
Eius autem cuius natiuitas est in radice iuncturae curatio, est difficilis.	But for one whose birth is in the root of the joint, cure is difficult.
Abstine ergo ab incisione eius.	Therefore, abstain from cutting him.
In illo uero qui nascitur in digito apud ultimum nodorum, tunc oportet ut incidas in primis carnem eius incisione rotunda usque ad os.	But in that person who is born in the finger near the last knot, then it is necessary that you strike his first flesh with a round incision all the way to the mouth.
Deinde serra os cum una illarum Serrarum conuenientium ad illud.	Then clamp the jaw with one of those clamps that are convenient for it.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for the person, until he is healed.
Consolidatio autem quae accidit digitis adinuicem, multotiens accidit aut ex natiuitate hominis, id est, nascitur cum eo, aut a consolidatione uulneris, aut combustione ignis, et similibus.	But the consolidation that happens in fingers opposite to each other, often happens or from the birth of a man, that is, he is born with it, or from the consolidation of a wound, or from a fire burn, and similar things.
Oportet ergo ut seces illam consolidationem, donec redeant digiti secundum formam suam naturalem.	Therefore, it is necessary that you separate that consolidation, until the fingers return to their natural shape.
Deinde pone inter eos licinia, aut pannos infusos in oleo rosato: ut non consolidentur uelociter, et separa inter eos: aut pone inter eos laminam plumbi subtilem, donec consolidetur locus secundum quod oportet.	Then place between them a chisel, or cloth soaked in oil with rose water: so that they do not unite quickly, and separate them: or place between them a thin piece of lead, until the spot joins together as it should.
Et similiter si accidat consolidatio quibusdam digitis cum palma, tunc seca illam consolidationem, secundum quod praeparatur et conuenit figurae membri.	And also if such a consolidation happens in some fingers with the palm, then dry that consolidation, according to how it is prepared and becomes the shape of the limb.
¶ De incisione Vitium.	Regarding the wound:
Caput XCII.	Head XCI.
Uites sunt Venae inuolutae, grossae, plenae superfluitatibus melancholicis quae accidunt in pluribus membris corporis: et plurimum euentus earum est in cruribus, praecipue in cruribus iter agentium et laborantium, et portantium.	The veins are closed, large, and full of melancholy effusions that occur in many parts of the body: and most of them are found in the legs, especially in the thighs of those who move about a lot, and of those who carry heavy loads.
Oportet ergo ut administres excussionem corporis ex cholera nigra aliquotiens excussione forti.	Therefore, it is necessary that you administer strong purgation to the body from time to time with black cholera in order to eliminate the excesses.
Deinde phlebotoma patientis eas basilicam.	Then take blood from the patient with a bazilicus needle.
Curatio uero earum cum ferro, est secundum duos modos.	The cure of these veins with iron is according to two methods.
Vnus eorum est, ut secentur, et extrahatur sanguis niger.	Vnus eorum est, ut secentur, et extrahatur sanguis niger.
Et modus alter est, ut eleuetur Vena, et extrahatur tota.	And the other mode is, that he should hold fast the vein and draw all out.
Sectio uero eius est secundum hunc modum.	But the sectioning of it is according to this mode.
Embroca crus in primis cum aqua calida multum, donec resoluatur sanguis grossus faeculentus.	Clutch the leg first with warm water a lot, until the thick foul blood has dissolved.
Deinde stringe crus infirmi a superiori parte coxae eius, usque ad inferiorem partem genu cum uitta.	Then tighten the wound of the nurse from the upper side of his hip, all the way down to the knee with the rope.
Deinde seca uenam in loco uno, aut duobus, aut tribus sectione ampla.	Then dry the leg in one place, or two, or three wide sections.
Deinde eleua, id est, extrahe sanguinem in manu tua ab inferiori parte cruris, usque ad sursum, et a superiori oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	Then he should hold fast the blood, that is to say, draw it out with his hand from the lower part of the leg, all the way up, and let it run first to the upper part.
Deinde seca unguem cum usque inferius: donec egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uides sufficere, et quam tolerat uirtus infirmi.	Then dry the nail down below: until he walks out of blood, as much as you see will suffice, and what strength the nurse can bear.
Postea liga eam: et praecipe ei, ut abstineat a cibis generantibus choleram nigram: et itera euacuationem et phlebotomiam, quando implentur Venae, et nocet illud infirmo.	Then bind it up: and order him, that he should refrain from foods which generate black cholesterol; and again let him undergo an evacuation and a phlebotomy, when the veins are filled, and that pain does the sick man.
Eleuatio autem eius est secundum hunc modum.	But his elevation is according to this mode.
Rade crus infirmi, si in ea sunt pili multi.	Scrape off the leg nurse, if there are many hairs on it.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in balneum: aut embroca ipsum in crure eius cum aqua calida, donec rubeat, et exuberentur Venae: aut exercitetur exercitio forti, si non est ei praesens balneum, donec calefiat membrum.	Then put him into a bath: or clutch him on the leg of himself with warm water, until he is red, and the veins are flowing; or exercise him strongly, if there is no present bath, until he is warm.
Deinde seca cutem in directo uenae sectione per longitudinem: aut in ultimo eius apud genu, aut in inferiori parte eius apud calcaneum.	Then dry the skin at right angles to the vein's section along its length; or in the end of it near the knee, or in the lower part of it near the heel.
Deinde aperi cutem cum uncinis, et excoria uenam ab omni parte, donec appareat sensui: et est apud apparitionem eius, quod uides eam rubeam ad nigredinem decliuem.	Then open the skin with a hook, and scrub off the scar from all parts, until you can feel it; and is it at the appearance of it, that you see it turn red to black by the decay.
Cum ergo uadit ex cute, uides eam albam quasi sit chorda.	Then when he has come out from under the skin, you will see it white as a cord.
Deinde intromitte sub ea Radium, donec quando eleuatur et egreditur de cute: suspende eam cum uncino caeco, leni.	Then introduce below it the radium, until it has been removed and has exited the skin: suspend it with a blind hook, gently.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam prope illam sectionem tribus digitis.	Then dry off another section next to that section with three fingers.
Deinde excoria cutem a superiori parte uenae, donec appareat.	Then scrape the skin from the upper part of the buttocks until it appears.
Deinde eleua eam cum Radiis sicut fecisti, et suspende eam cum uncino alio, sicut fecisti in primis.	Then remove it with radium as you did, and suspend it with another hook as you did at first.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam, aut sectiones plures, si indiges illo.	Then dry off another section, or more sections if you wish to do so.
Deinde eleua, et incide ipsam ultima sectione apud calcaneum.	Then remove it and cut it at the heel.
Deinde extrahe eam ad sectionem quae est supra eam.	Then pull it out to the section above it.
Et fac illud, donec extrahas eam ex sectione quae est superior, uel altior sectionibus omnibus, donec quando egreditur tota: tunc incide eam.	And make it, until you have pulled it out of the upper section, or longer sections, until it has exited all of it: then cut it.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad extrahendum, et eleuandum: tunc intromitte acum cum filo forti duplo, et liga eam, et extrahe ipsam: aut intromitte sub ea Radium: et reuolue manum tuam ad omnem partem, donec egrediatur.	If it does not submit to you for being removed and cut: then introduce a strong double-edged knife and tie it up, and remove it: or introduce below it the radium: and move your hand around all of it until it has exited.
Et caue, ne incidatur.	And make sure that it does not get cut.
Nam si incidatur, fit difficile tibi eleuare eam ualde, et ingreditur super infirmum ex ea nocumentum.	For if it is cut, it will be difficult for you to remove it well, and it will enter into the body and cause harm.
Cum ergo extraxeris eam totam: tunc pone super locum uulnerum lanam submersam in uino et oleo rosato, aut oleo: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	But when you remove it all: then place it on a place wet with wine and oil, or oil only: and take care of it, until it heals.
Quod si Vitis est contracta, habens tortuositatem cui sit inuolutio ad partes, et non est sicut diximus secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut findas super eam ad omnem partem tortuositatis eius, et loca inuolutionis ipsius.	That if the vine is contracted, having a tortuosity where it turns to the parts of it, and is not like what we have said according to the straightness: then you must find on all parts of its tortuosity, and the places of its turning.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncinis, donec eleues eam totam: et caue apud sectionem tuam super eam ne incidas uenam, aut uulneres: nam difficile fiet super te eleuare, uel extrahere eam.	Then suspend it with a hook, until you have removed it all: and make sure that you do not get cut by the section next to it, or hurt yourself: for it will be difficult for you to remove it from on top of you, or to pull it out.
Conserua ergo prudentiam tuam.	Conserve therefore your prudence.
Forma Incidentis quo sanatur Vitis.	The form of incident which heals is vitis.
Forma Vncini caeci.	The form of incised wound which heals is vinum coptum.
Non est ei curuitas sicut reliquis Vncinis, neque est acutae extremitatis, ut non uulneret uenam: et est grossae flectuositatis, lenis: quoniam si esset subtilis, incideret uenam subtilitate sua: imo sit ei superflua grossitudo, sicut diximus.	It is not curitis like the other Incision, nor is it acute extremity, so as not to wound the vein; and it is gross flexibility, mild: for if it were thin, it would be hurt by its own subtility: but there is a superfluity of grossness in it, as we have said.
De extractione Venae cruris.	On the extraction of a vein from the leg.
Caput XCIII.	Head 83.
Haec Vena generatur in cruribus in terris calidis, sicut Alizegi, et terra Arabum, et in terris aridis, calidis, paucae teneritatis, id est, in quibus non nascitur herba, neque arbor.	This vein is generated in the legs in warm lands, such as Alizegi and the land of the Arabs, and in arid, hot lands, little tender, that is, in which grass does not grow, nor trees.
Et fortasse generatur in locis aliis corporis praeter crura.	And perhaps it is generated in other parts of the body besides the legs.
Et generatio quidem eius est a putrefactione quae accidit sub cute, sicut accidunt intra corpora serpentes et uermes ascarides, et uermes generati inter cutem et carnem.	And indeed its generation is from putrefaction which occurs under the skin, as it happens within the bodies of serpents and worms ascariuses, and worms generated between the skin and flesh.
Et signum incaeptionis euentus huius Venae est, quod accidit in crure inflammatio uehemens.	And the sign of the beginning of this vein is, that it happens in the leg a hot inflammation.
Deinde uesicatur locus.	Then the place becomes blistered.
Deinde incipit Vena exire ex loco illius uesicationis, quasi sit radix plantae, aut animal.	Then the vein begins to issue out from the place of its blistering, as if it were a root of a plant, or an animal.
Cum ergo apparet ex ea extremitas eius, tunc oportet ut inuoluas super ipsam frustum plumbi, cuius pondus sit ex drachma keil, usque ad drachmas II et noda ipsam: et dimitte plumbum suspensum ex crure.	But when this extremitas of it appears, you shall then bind thereupon a fragment of lead whose weight is from a drachm to a claw-weight, up to two drachms and mark the same: and let go the lead suspended out of the leg.
Quotiens ergo egreditur ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, inuolue illud in plumbo, et noda illud.	Howsoever it shall go forth from it to the externals, bind it within the lead and mark it.
Quod si prolongatur multum, tunc incide partem eius, et inuolue residuum.	Which if it should be prolonged for a long time, then cut a part of it, and bind the remainder.
Et non incidas eam radicitus antequam egrediatur tota.	And do not cut it up into roots before it shall have gone forth all out.
Quoniam si incidis, contrahitur, et ingreditur in carnem: et facit accidere apostema, et putredinem in loco, et ulcus malum.	For if you should cut it, then it will contract itself and go into the flesh; and it makes happen a pustule, and decay in that place, and a bad wound.
Quapropter oportet, ut suauiter tractetur, et extrahatur paulatim, donec egrediatur ex ultimo sui, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid in corpore: et ex hac quidem Vena egreditur in quibusdam hominibus quod est in longitudine sua quinque palmorum et decem.	So then it should be handled gently and slowly extracted until it has completely emerged from the last of its own, and nothing remains in the body: and from this very vein emerges in some people which is five palms long and ten.
Et iam peruenit ad me, quia exiuit uiro ex XX palmis.	And I had already reached it because he had emerged from 20 palms.
Si autem inciditur tibi in hora medicationis tuae: tunc intromitte radium in foramine eius, et perfora eam foramine longo, cum corpore, donec euacuetur totum quod est in ea ex materia: et administra putrefactionem loci cum medicinis diebus aliquot.	But if you are injured at the time of your medical treatment: then insert a ray into that hole and pierce it with a long blade along with the body until all the contents have been completely discharged from it: and administer putrefaction to the site with medicines for several days.
Deinde cura ipsum curatione apostematum.	Then take care of him with the cure of wounds.
Et haec quidem Vena quandoque habet ramos multos, praecipue quando apparet in iunctura pedis, aut in pede ipso: et accidunt ei orificia multa, et egreditur ex omni orificio ramus.	And this very vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears in the ankle of the foot, or in the foot itself: and many openings occur to it, and a branch emerges from every opening.
Cura ergo ipsam, sicut diximus in diuisione, et cum eo quod praemissum est.	So then take care of it as we have said in division, and with the above-mentioned things that were preceded.
¶ De sectione super Vermes generatos sub cute, et dicitur Aegritudo bouina.	Regarding the section on worms born under the skin, and it is called the "bad trouble".
Caput XCIIII.	Chapter 82.
Haec Aegritudo nominatur in quadam terra apud nos Aegritudo bouina: propterea, quia multotiens accidit bouibus, et est uermis paruus unus, qui nascitur inter cutem et carnem.	This "Illness" is called in some country "the bad trouble": for this often happens that worms emerge bare and a single one is born, which appears between skin and flesh.
Et uadit in corpore toto, ascendendo et descendendo: et ostenditur sensui apud ambulationem eius de membro ad membrum, donec disrumpit ubicumque disrumpit in cute locum, et egreditur.	And it was felt throughout the body when it rose and fell: and it was perceived by touch when it walked from one member to another, until it stopped wherever it stopped in the skin, and emerged.
Et generatio eius est ex putredine quorundam humorum.	And its origin is from the putrefaction of certain kinds of dung.
Sicut accidunt uermes et serpentes, id est, lumbrici, et ascarides in uentre.	As happen worms and snakes, that is, earthworms, and pinworms in the stomach.
Et timetur ex malicia eius.	And they fear its maliciousness.
Quia quando ipse uadit in corpore, et eleuatur ad caput, et peruenit ad locum: tunc fortasse aperit in eo, et egreditur, et destruit oculum: et accidit illud multotiens.	Because when he begins to move in the body and rises to a head, then perhaps it opens within him, and emerges, and destroys an eye: and this happens often.
Cum ergo uis curare eum, et extrahere ipsum, tunc non fit illud nisi apud ambulationem eius, et apparitionem ipsius sensui.	So then if you are going to care for him and extract it, then that will not happen unless he walks or feels it himself.
Oportet ergo, ut stringas quod est supra eum, et quod est sub eo cum ligamento constrictione forti.	Therefore, so that you keep what is above him, and what is below with strong constriction of the ligament.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then dry on top of him, and then extract him.
Quod si profundatur in carne, et non inuenis ipsum: tunc pone super locum cauterium cum igne, donec moriatur.	If it penetrates into the flesh, and not into his whole body: then place on the spot a cautery with fire until it dies.
Et maius quod timetur, est corruptio eius, qua corrumpit oculum, sicut diximus.	And greater what is feared is corruption of him, which corrupts his eye, as we have said.
Si autem uides eum iam peruenisse in capite prope oculum, tunc stringe sub eo supercilium strictura bona.	But if you see it has already reached the head near the eye, then tighten what is below with good tight constriction.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then dry on top of him, and then extract him.
Et oportet ut utatur infirmus mundificatione sui corporis, cum medicinis soluentibus humores putridos malos.	And it is necessary that the sick one uses his own purification, with medicines dissolving bad putrid humors.
Et caueat sibi a cibis generantibus putrefactionem.	And he protects himself from foods that generate putrefaction.
¶ De sectione super aegritudinem Nakir.	§ On the section on disease of Nakir.
Caput XCV.	Head 105.
Haec aegritudo nominatur in terra nostra Nakir: et est dolor qui accidit in quibusdam membris: deinde permutatur de membro ad membrum.	This disease is called in our land Nakir, and it is a pain that happens in some member, and then it changes from a member to another.
Et ego quidem iam uidi ipsum, secundum quod narro tibi.	And indeed I have already seen him, according to what I tell you.
Vocatus sum ad mulierem infirmam in quibusdam uillis.	I was called to a sick woman in some rooms.
Et detexit brachium suum, et uidi inflationem paruam in uena funis brachii.	And she took her arm, and I saw swelling of the lung in the arm joint.
Et postquam remansi hora una, uidi unam inflationem incedere cum focili, sicut incedit uermis, ascendendo ad humerum eius uelocius quam esse potest: ut sit sicut argentum uiuum, quando currit de loco ad locum.	And after an hour had passed, I saw one swelling walk with a flame as if it were fire, rising faster than it can go: like silver in flight, when it runs from place to place.
Recessit ergo dolor ex illo loco, et fixus est in humero.	So then the pain left that place, and was fixed in the shoulder.
Deinde sedi hora una, et cucurrit in reliquum corpus, donec perueniret in brachium aliud.	Then he sat for an hour, and ran through the remaining body, until it reached another arm.
Deinde narrauit mihi, quia reuoluebatur in toto corpore suo, secundum quod uidi.	Then he told me that he was writhing all over his whole body, according to what I saw.
Miratus sum ergo de uelocitate permutationis eius de membro ad membrum.	I am astounded at the swiftness with which he transfers his member from one part to another.
Et ego quidem ante illud non uideram hanc aegritudinem oculis meis taliter secundum hunc modum.	And I too did not see this disease before, with my eyes, in such a way.
Verumtamen uidi multos, qui inueniunt dolorem permutari de membro ad membrum: et non uidi ipsum oculis, sicut uidi eum in muliere.	However, I see many who suffer from the pain that one member causes another: and I do not see this one with my eyes, as I saw it in a woman.
Et ego non cogito illud esse, nisi quod est propterea, quod mulier fuit ex illis qui sunt ex uillis sicci corporis detectarum uenarum: hinc ergo apparet sensui illa uentositas permutata.	And I do not think that this is, except that it is for this reason, because that woman was from those who are from dry bodies of stinking limbs: hence it appears to the sense that this swiftness is transferred.
Et est necesse, ut non appareant secundum hanc rationem in illis qui sunt deliciosi, et corporibus humidis, occultarum uenarum.	And it is necessary so that it does not appear in this way with regard to those who are luscious and have humid bodies, of secret limbs.
Cum ergo uis curationem eius, et sentit patiens illud dolorem: tunc si est apparens tibi oculo, sicut diximus, tunc stringe supra ipsum, et sub ipso uelociter: et seca supra ipsum, donec egrediatur illa uentositas coartata: et cauteriza locum.	When you then apply the cure to him, and the patient feels this pain: then if it appears to your eyes, as we have said, then lift him up quickly: and dry him out on top of him until he walks in that swiftness: and caustice the place.
Si autem non uides ipsum oculis tuis: tunc cura ipsum cum excussione corporis, et cum eo quod expellit uentositates, et carminat eas cum pillulis foetidis, et pillulis de serapino, et similibus.	If, however, you do not see this one with your eyes: then cure him by scrubbing the body, and with it what drives out the swiftness, and makes them red with foamy pills, and pills of bitter wormwood, and others like them.
¶ De extractione Sagittarum.	Regarding the extraction of arrows.
Caput XCVI.	Chapter LXXVI.
Sagittae diuersificantur secundum species suas, et secundum loca in quibus cadunt ex corpore.	Arrows differ according to their species, and according to the places in which they are embedded in the body.
Earum uero diuersitas est: quoniam ex eis sunt quae habent cuspides magnos, et paruos: et concauae, et surdae.	However, there is a difference between them: for some have large tips, and some are sharp; and some are convexed, and some are concave.
Et ex eis sunt quae habent tres angulos.	And of these some have three angles.
Et ex eis quibus sunt linguae.	And of these are the tongues.
Et ex eis quibus sunt astellae.	And of these are the stars.
Illae uero quae sunt secundum membra in quibus cadunt, est secundum duos modos.	However, those that fall into members according to the two ways.
Aut enim membra sunt ex membris principalibus concauis, sicut cerebrum, et cor, et epar, et pulmo, et renes, et intestina, et uesica, et eis similia.	Or if members are from main concavities, like the brain, heart, liver, lung, kidney, intestine, bladder, and similar to them.
Quando ergo cadit in aliquo horum membrorum, et apparent tibi signa mortis, quae ego narro tibi post, tunc oportet ut deuites extractionem illius sagittae ex eis, nam mors consequitur illum in quo est, in pluribus dispositionibus.	When therefore he falls upon any of these limbs, and the signs of death appear to you, which I shall tell you afterwards, then it is necessary that you should extract that arrow from him, for death will overtake him in that position.
Et quando non apparent tibi ista signa mala, et sagitta non est absconsa in profunditate membri, tunc extrahe ipsam, et cura uulnus.	And when these bad signs do not appear to you, and the arrow is not buried deep within the limb, then extract it, and be concerned for the wound.
Ex signis enim cerebri quando cadit in eo sagitta, et penetrat os, et egreditur siphac quod est super cerebrum, est: quoniam accidunt ex illo soda uehemens, et scotomia, et uertigo, et rubedo in oculis, et inflatio, et rubedo linguae, et spasmus, et permixtio intellectus, et uomitus cholerae.	For when the signs of injury to the brain appear, when an arrow falls into it, and pierces the bone, and comes out above the brain, there happen: for there is a violent headache, and blurring of vision, and dizziness, and reddening of the eyes, and swelling, and reddening of the tongue, and spasm, and confusion of thought, and loss of memory, and cholera.
Et fortasse egreditur sanguis ex naribus, aut auribus.	And perhaps blood comes out from the nose, or ears.
Et fortasse abscinditur sermo, et destruitur uox.	And perhaps speech is severed, and the voice is destroyed.
Et egreditur ex loco uulneris humiditas alba similis pulti.	And there comes out of the wound's place a white, pulpy moisture.
Et exit ex eo simile aquositati carnis.	And there comes out of it similar to a meat broth.
Si ergo apparent tibi ista signa, tunc abstine a curatione, et extrahe sagittam si non egreditur.	But if these signs appear to you, then refrain from treatment, and extract the arrow if it has not come out.
Signa autem sagittae quando cadit in corde, sunt: quod ipsa est prope mammillam sinistram: et sentit cum ea quasi ipsa sit fixa in re dura, non in re uacua.	The signs of an arrow that falls into the heart are: for it is near the left nipple: and feels as if fixed to a hard thing, not to a soft one.
Et fortasse sagittae est motus similis motui pulsus: et currit ex uulnere sanguis niger.	And perhaps the arrow has a movement similar to a pulse: and black blood runs from the limb.
Et sequitur illud frigus extremitatum, et sudor frigidus, et syncopis.	And follows it coldness of the limbs, and cold sweat, and fainting fit.
Scias ergo, quod mors descendit procul dubio.	So you know that death has certainly come.
Et signum sagittae quando uulnerat pulmonem, est exitus sanguinis spumosi ex uulnere: et uasa quae sequuntur collum, apostematur, et mutatur color infirmi.	And the sign of an arrow that wounds the lung is: blood spitting from the limb is frothy: and the veils that cover the neck, fall down, and change their color in front of the eyes.
Et expirat spiritum magnum, altum: et quaerit attractionem aeris frigidi.	And he breathes out great, deep breaths: and seeks cold air.
Quod si cadat sagitta in uelamen, quod est in pectore: tunc est prope costas paruas: et fit anhelitus magnus cum dolore uehementi, cum suspirio: et mouentur omnia membra humerorum.	If the arrow falls into the chest, which is within the breastplate: then it is close to the lower back: and it causes a great fever with severe pain, with sighing: and all the limbs of the shoulders move.
Et si cadat sagitta in stomachum, tunc fortasse egreditur ex uulnere ex cibo aliquid indigestum.	And if an arrow falls into the belly, then perhaps it has exited from a little indigestion from something eaten.
Et si cadit sagitta in Ventrem, et figitur in eo: egreditur aliquid stercoris ex uulnere, aut zirbum, aut intestinum quod iam disruptum est.	And if an arrow falls into the belly, and lodges there: it exits some stool from thebowels, or a piece of flesh, or an intestine which has already been torn.
Non est ergo spes in curatione eius, neque in extractione sagittae.	So there is no hope for its cure, nor for the extraction of the arrow.
Quod si sagitta cadat in Vesicam, et egrediatur urina: et procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, et fortior sit dolor super infirmum: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	If an arrow falls into the bladder, and it exits urine: and it proceeds from it something to the outside, and the pain is stronger over the sick one: then know that it is fatal.
Reliqua autem membra, sicut facies, et collum, et guttur, et spatula, et adiutorium, et spondiles dorsi, et furcula, et coxa, et crus, et eis similia ex membris saluantur secundum plures dispositiones: quando non inuenit sagitta arteriam, aut neruum: et non est sagitta uenenosa.	The remaining limbs, such as the face, neck, mouth, spleens, ribs, hips, and legs, are saved according to multiple dispositions: when the arrow does not hit a blood vessel or nerve: and the arrow is not harmless.
Et ego narro tibi quod uidi de esse harum sagittarum, ut significes per illud super curationem tuam.	And I tell you that I saw such arrows, which he used to indicate by way of example for your cure.
Quod est, quia cuidam uiro cecidit sagitta in lachrymali oculi eius, in radice nasi.	That is, because an arrow fell into the eye of a man's tear duct, at the root of his nose.
Extraxi ergo eam ipsi ex parte altera, sub adipe auris eius: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei in oculo eius nocumentum.	So I extracted it from him on the other side, under the fat of his ear: and he was healed, and there was no harm to his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam Iudaeo, quae cecidit ei in adipe oculi sui sub palpebra inferiori: et sagitta iam occultata erat, et non consecutus sum ex ea nisi extremitatem paruam eius, cum qua adhaeret in ligno suo: et erat sagitta magna ex sagittis arcuum Turcorum, cum ferro leni, in qua non sunt aures.	And I extracted another arrow from the Jew, which had fallen into his fat under his lower eyelid: and the arrow was now hidden, and I could not get it out unless I cut off part of his cheek, to which it was attached in its own wood: and it was a large arrow among the arrows of the Turks, with a soft iron, in which there were no bars.
Sanatus est ergo Iudaeus, et non accidit in oculo eius accidens malum.	So the Jew was healed, and there was no bad happen to his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam ex gutture Christiani.	And I drew another bow from the throat of a Christian.
Et erat sagitta arabica, et est illa cui sunt aures.	And it was an Arab bow, and that is where the ears are.
Secui ergo super ipsam inter duas guidegi: et iam submersa erat in gutture eius.	Then I followed behind it with two arrows: and now she was submerged in his throat.
Subtiliatus sum ergo cum ea, donec extraxi eam: et sanatus est Christianus.	So I went with care, until I had drawn her out: and the Christian was well.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam uiro quae ceciderat in uentre eius: et cogitauimus, quia moreretur ex ea.	And I drew out another arrow from a man who had fallen into his belly: and we thought that he should die therefrom.
Postquam ergo praeterierunt ei triginta dies, et non mutatum est super eum aliquid ex dispositionibus eius, secui super sagittam: et ingeniaui super eam, et extraxi eam: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei accidens malum.	After which I left him for thirty days, and there was nothing changed in him from his habits, then I followed behind the arrow: and I followed it up, and drew it out: and he was well, and no misfortune happened to him.
Et uidi uirum cui cecidit sagitta in dorso eius, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam.	And I saw a man to whom the arrow had fallen on his back, and it was mending over him.
Postquam ergo fuit post septem annos, exiuit sagitta in radice coxae eius.	After which it was after seven years, the arrow came out at the root of his hip.
Et uidi mulierem cui cecidit in uentre suo sagitta, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam, et remansit sagitta intra ipsam: et non mutata est ex dispositionibus eius aliqua, et mulier non inuenit ei nocumentum in aliqua ex operationibus suis naturalibus.	And I saw a woman to whom the arrow had fallen into her belly, and it was mending over her, and the arrow remained within her: and there was nothing changed in her from her habits, and the woman did not find any harm in any of her natural actions.
Et uidi uirum alium, cui cecidit sagitta in facie sua: et consolidatum est uulnus, et remansit, non inueniens ei multum dolorem: et similia istis multa.	And I saw another man to whom the arrow had fallen on his face, and it was mending over him, and remained, not finding much pain in it: and there were many such things like this.
Et extraxi sagittam uiro ex principibus Regis, quae ceciderat ei in medio nasi sui, et iam declinauerat ad partem dextram parumper: et occultata erat sagitta tota.	And I drew out an arrow from the prince of the king, which had fallen into his nose, and was declining a little on the right side: and the arrow was hidden all together.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius post casum sagittae usque ad tres dies.	So I was called to his cure after the fall of the arrow for three days.
Inueni ergo uulnus sagittae strictum ualde.	Then I found the bow string very tight.
Inquisiui ergo eam cum tenta subtili, et non sensi eam: et ipse quidem inueniebat punctionem et dolorem sub aure sua ex parte dextra.	So I asked her with careful touch, and I did not feel it: but he himself felt the prick and pain under his right ear.
Speraui ergo, quod erat illa punctio ex extremitate sagittae.	I therefore hoped that it was that point at the end of the arrow.
Emplastraui ergo locum cum emplastro in quo erat uirtus attractiua, et digestiua, confidens apud me, quod apostemaretur locus, et appareret mihi signum sagittae, ut secarem super eam: et non accidit in loco accidens significans quod sagitta consecuta sit locum.	I therefore prepared the plaster with which to draw out the force of attraction and digestion, confident within myself that if I should remove the place, a sign would appear to me of the arrow, so that I might cut over it: and this did not happen in the place suggesting that the arrow was lying in wait there.
Assiduaui ergo cum emplastro super eum diebus multis: et non accidit accidens, et consolidatum est uulnus interim: et remansit infirmus de extractione eius spacio dierum, donec sensit sagittam die quodam intra nasum suum.	I therefore persevered with the plaster for many days: and nothing happened, and the fracture was healed in the meantime: and he remained weak from being unable to remove it from that space for a number of days, until one day he felt an arrow in his nose.
Et narrauit mihi illud.	And he told me that.
Posui ergo super illud uulnus medicinam acutam, corrosiuam diebus multis, donec apertum est: et cum tenta tentaui ipsum, et sensi extremitatem sagittae subtilem quae adhaeret in ligno.	I therefore placed sharp medicine on that fracture for many days, until it was open: and when I tried to move him, I felt the end of the arrow sticking into the wood.
Deinde addidi in apertione uulneris per illam medicinam acutam, donec apparuit nobis uisibiliter extremitas sagittae: et praeteriit mihi cum eo spacium temporis circiter quatuor menses.	Then I added the sharp medicine to the fracture through which it was open for a number of months, until we could see the end of the arrow clearly: and time passed with him while I was adding the sharp medicine.
Deinde postquam amplificatum est uulnus, et possible fuit mihi intromittere forcipes in ipsam, et mouere ipsam, et non obediuit ad exitum: tunc non cessaui subtiliare, et ingeniare super eam cum modis ingeniorum, donec coepi super eam die quodam cum forcipibus decenter factis, secundum quod ueniet forma eorum in fine capituli, donec extraxi eam.	Then when the fracture had healed and I was able to push the bones together, and make them move, and they would not come out: then I did not cease to apply gentle pressure, and to devise means over it, until one day I pushed on it with bent forks, according to the form of their ends at the end of a chapter, so that I pulled it out.
Deinde restauraui uulnus.	Then I restored the fracture.
Et medici quidem iudicant, quod cartilago nasi non restauratur.	And the doctors say that cartilage in the nose has not been restored.
Restauraui ergo ipsam, et consolidatum est uulnus, et sanatus est infirmas sanitate integra: nec nocuit ei aliquid omnino.	I therefore restored it, and the fracture was healed, and all the injury was healed with complete health: and he did not suffer from anything at all.
Et ego narro tibi qualitatem extractionis quarundam sagittarum: ut ponas illud regulam et significationem super illud quod non dixi.	And I will tell you the quality of extracting a certain kind of arrow: so that you may have a rule and a sign on it, which I did not mention.
Quoniam partes huius artis et distinctiones earum non comprehenduntur cum narratione: neque comprehendit illud liber, et artifex prudens comparat cum pauco super multum: et cum eo quod est paesens, super illud quod est absens: et inuenit operationem nouam, et instrumentum nouum apud descensus rerum extranearum huius artis quando accidunt.	For the parts of this art and their distinctions do not comprehend with a description: nor does that book understand it, and the craftsman is prudent to compare little with much: and when he is present with him who is absent, he finds an operation new, and a tool new for going down matters foreign to this art when they occur.
Dico ergo, quod sagittae non egrediuntur ex membris quibus sunt fixae, nisi secundum duos modos.	I say then, that arrows do not depart from the member on which they are fixed except by two ways.
Aut per attractionem ex loco ex quo intrauit.	Or by attraction from the place from which it entered.
Aut contrario partis alterius.	Or by the opposite of the other part.
Et illa quae egreditur unde intrauit, aut est sagitta procedens in loco carnoso: et attrahitur, et egreditur.	And those that have exited from where they entered, or are an arrow going in a fleshy place: and is attracted, and exits.
Quod si non obedit ad exitum ex hora in qua cadit: tunc oportet ut dimittas ipsam aliquot diebus, donec putrefiat caro quae est in circumitu eius: et alleuietur attractio eius, et eius egressio.	That if it does not submit to the exit at the time when it falls: then it is necessary that you should let go of it for a few days, until the flesh which is around it decays: and the attraction of it will be alleviated, and its exit.
Et similiter si figitur in osse, et non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc dimitte ipsam etiam aliquot diebus: et itera eam cum attractione et motione omni die, donec egreditur.	And likewise if it is drawn into a bone, and does not submit to you to the exit, then let go of it also for a few days: and again with the attraction and movement every day, until it exits.
Quod si non obedit tibi ad exitum post dies, tunc oportet ut perfores in circumitu sagittae in ipso osse ab omni parte cum terebro subtili, donec amplificentur sagittae.	That if it does not submit to you to the exit after a few days, then you should make a hole in the bone from all sides with a sharp object, until the arrows increase.
Deinde attrahe eam, et extrahe ipsam.	Then attract it, and remove it.
Si autem sagitta est fixa in capitis osse, et iam processit in uno uentrium cerebri, et apparent ex infirmo quaedam illorum accidentium quae dixi: tunc abstine ab attractione sagittae, et dimitte eam, donec aequetur esse eius post dies.	But if the arrow is fixed in the bone of the skull, and has already gone into one of the winds of the brain, and there appears to be some of the accidents I have mentioned: then refrain from attracting the arrow, and let it go, until it becomes equable after a few days.
Nam si sagitta peruenit ad sifach, tunc mors non prolongatur ei.	For if the arrow reaches the skull, then death does not prolong for him.
Et si sagitta non est fixa, nisi in corpore ossis tantum, et non penetrat usque ad sifach: et remanet infirmus aliquot diebus, et non accidit ei ex illis accidentibus aliquid: tunc ingenia in attractione sagittae et extractione eius.	And if the arrow is not fixed, unless it is in the body of bone only, and does not penetrate as far as the skull: and remains for a few days sick, and does not happen to him any of those accidents: then use your wit in attracting the arrow and removing it.
Si autem est fixa ualde, et non obedit tibi ad attractionem: tunc administra terebella in circumitu sagittae, sicut narraui tibl: deinde cura locum, donec sanetur.	But if it is fixed firmly, and does not submit to you to the attraction: then administer a sharp object around the arrow, as a nail: and then take care of the place, until it heals.
Si autem Sagitta iam absconsa est in loco corporis, et occultatur et absconditur a sensu: tunc inquire eam cum tenta.	If however the arrow is already hidden in the place of the body and concealed and hidden from sense: then examine it with effort.
Si autem sentis eam, tunc attrahe eam cum quibusdam instrumentis quae conueniunt attractioni eius.	If you feel it, then attract it with some instruments that are suitable for attracting it.
Si autem non potes super eam, propter constrictionem uulneris, et propter longitudinem sagittae in profundo: et non est illic os, neque neruus, neque uena: tunc finde super eam, donec amplificetur uulnus, et sit possibile extrahere sagittam.	If you cannot get above it, because of the constriction of the wound, and because of the length of the arrow in the deep: and there is no bone, or nerve, or vein: then find above it, until the tendon is enlarged, and it is possible to remove the arrow.
Quod si sunt ei aures quibus teneatur, tunc libera carnem fixam in eis ab omni parte, omni ingenio quo potes illud, et ingenia, si non potest super euasionem carnis in fractura aurium, et contorsione earum, donec euadat.	That if there are ears that hold it, then free the flesh that is fixed in them from all sides, with all the effort that you can: and efforts, if it cannot be healed on the ears, and their twisting, until it heals.
Et tu quando administras extractionem Sagittae, in quocumque loco est, tunc utere contorsione manus tuae, cum forficibus ad partes omnes, donec facias eam euadere: et subtilia ultima subtilitate, ut non frangatur Sagita, et fiat difficilis tibi attractio eius, et ipsius extractio.	And you when you administer the extraction of the arrow, wherever it is, then use the twisting of your hands, with forceps to all parts, until you make it heal: and the last subtility, so that the arrow does not break, and becomes difficult for you to attract it, and its extraction.
Quod si non potes super eam ex hora una, tunc dimitte eam diebus aliquot, donec putrefiant quae sunt in circumitu eius.	That if you cannot get above it in one hour, then leave it for a few days, until what is around it putsrefies.
Deinde itera eam: alleuietur enim tuncia Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra quod diximus ex curatione in capitulo suo: et custodi uirtutem tuam ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, aut chordae.	Then repeat it: for sure bandages If however the contradiction is causing you a flow of blood, then administer what we said in its chapter on healing: and protect your skill from cutting a vein, or a nerve, or a tendon.
Et administra ingenium omni modo quo tibi possibile est euasionis Sagittae: et sit illud cum facilitate, et tranquillitate, uel tarditate, et firmitate, sicut narraui tibi.	And administer the efforts in every way that you can possibly heal the arrow: and let it be with ease, and tranquility, or tardiness, and firmness, as I have told you.
Et oportet, ut facias cum trahis Sagittam, ut infirmus sit secundum figuram, secundum quam fuit apud casum Sagittae in ipso.	And it should be that, when you take out the arrow, it is with a view to making the injured person recover his health according to the figure, according to which the arrow was in the wound of the arrow itself.
Quoniam est magis iuuatiuum.	For it is more certain.
Si autem non est tibi possibile illud, tunc administra quod tibi est possibile ex figuris.	But if it is not possible for you to do that, then administer what is possible for you from figures.
Sagitta autem quae egreditur ex contrario partis alterius, aut iam procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora: aut facit gibbositatem extremitas Sagittae per sensum ex superiore parte cutis propinquae, et uides eam eminentem: seca ergo super eam, et sit sectio secundum quantitatem quod capiant in ea forcipes.	But if the arrow that comes out of the other side is already going out from it a little towards the outside: or makes a bump on the ends of the arrow by touch from the top part of the skin nearby, and you see it sticking out: then cut off over it, and make the incision according to the quantity that they hold in them the arrows.
Deinde attrahe eam: ipsa namque fit facilis ad exitum.	Then attract it: for it becomes easy to exit.
Si uero retinetur in osse, tunc torque manum tuam secundum rotunditatem, donec imprimat Sagitta in osse, et amplificet sibiipsi: deinde trahe ipsam.	But if it retains in the bone, then twist your hand according to its roundness, until it impresses the arrow in the bone, and magnifies itself: then attract it.
Et si non: dimitte eam diebus aliquot: deinde itera eam, donec egrediatur.	And if not: leave it for a few days: then repeat it, until it exits.
Quod si lignum Sagittae est in ea, tunc impelle ipsam cum eo.	That if the arrow is in it, then push it with that.
Si autem cecidit lignum, et uis administrare impulsionem: tunc intromitte ad eam instrumentum concauum, ut ingrediatur concauitas eius in caudam Sagittae: deinde impelle eam cum ipso.	But if it fell wood, and you have to administer the push: then introduce into it an instrument that is smooth, so that it enters smoothly from its tail the arrow: then push it with that.
Si autem Sagita est concaua, tunc impelle eam cum instrumento intrante in ipsam.	But if the arrow is smooth, then push it with an instrument that enters into it.
Sagitta enim alleuiatur per illud.	For the arrow is relieved by this.
Quod si Sagitta est toxicata, tunc oportet, ut concaues carnem totam, in qua est uenenum: si est tibi possibile illud.	That if the arrow is poisoned, then it is necessary, so that smooth meat, in which is venenum: if it is possible for you to do this.
Deinde cura eam cum eo quod conuenit ad illud.	Then take care of it with that when it comes into contact with that.
Quod si Sagitta est cadens in pectore, aut in uentre, aut in uesica, aut in latere: et est propinqua ex eo quod tangis cum tenta, et possibile est tibi secare super eam: tunc seca, et caue ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, et extrahe eam.	That if the arrow is falling in the chest, or in the abdomen, or in the groin, and it is close to you that you touch with your hand, and it is possible for you to cut over it: then cut off, and take care away from the incision of the vein, or nerve, and remove it.
Deinde sue uulnus, si uides, et cura illud, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the wound, if you see it, and take care of that, until it is healed.
Et haec est forma Forcipum, quibus extrahuntur Sagittae.	And this is the form of the forceps, with which the arrows are removed.
Sint extremitates similes rostro auis, quae factae sunt sicut ferra: quando capiunt super Sagittam, non dimittunt eam.	If the ears are similar in shape to the nose, and have been made like iron: when they are placed over the arrow, they do not allow it to move.
Et fiunt ex eis species multae, magnae, et paruae, et mediae, secundum quantitatem magnitudinis Sagittae, et paruitatis eius, et amplitudinis uulneris, et constrictionis eius.	And from them there result many kinds, great and small and moderate, according to the quantity of the size of the arrow and its width and the constriction of the wound.
Forma Impellentis concaui.	Their shape is a kind of cone.
Et forma Impellentis surdi.	And their form is deaf.
Hoc est surdae extremitatis sicut Radius, ut alleuietur introitus eius in sagittam concauam, et impellatur cum eo.	This is the shape of deaf ears like a cone, so that the entrance into it may be relieved and driven in with it.
Huius extremitas impellentis concauae est concaua sicut penna auis: ut alleuietur introitus sagittae in ipsam et impulsio eius.	This is the shape of a deaf ear, conic like a feather; so that the entrance into it may be relieved and driven in with it.
¶ De phlebotomia Venarum.	Regarding the lancing of veins.

Et phlebotomia earum fit secundum duos modos.	And phlebotomy from them [i.e., the lungs] is done in two ways.
Aut pungendo cum phlebotomo myrtino lato: aut oliuari ad subtilitatem decliui: aut secando cum phlebotomo cultellari, et est Alnesil.	Either pricking with a phlebotomy needle on the side: or oiling at the place of a cautery, and it is called Anelid; either drying with a phlebotomy knife, and it is called Alnelid.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is the form of it.
Sic Alnesil est, quod conuenit ad sectionem.	Thus Anelid is, which is fitting for sectioning.
Et ex eis sunt species latae, et subtiles secundum amplitudinem uenarum et stricturam earum Forma phlebotomi myrtini sit lata, sicut uides.	And from them are two kinds of phlebotomy needles, and they differ according to the width of the veins and the thickness of the skin; The form of the phlebotomy needle with which one makes a section is wide, as you see.
Et conuenit ad aperiendas uenas concauas, plenas, procedentes, apparentes, grossas, et illas quae continent sanguinem grossum, turbidum.	And it is fitting for opening closed veins, full, coming from the body, visible, thick, and those which contain  thick blood, turbulent.
Et iste phlebotomus est minoris latitudinis, et subtilioris extreminatis.	And this phlebotomist is of lesser width, and more delicate at the extremities.
Et conuenit ad phlebotomiam uenarum subtilium, quae continent sanguinem subtilem citrinum	And it is fitting for phlebotomy of small veins that contain  subtle yellow blood.
¶ De phlebotomia Basilicae.	## On the Phlebotomy of the Basilica [vein].
Basilicae autem quae est una harum trium uenarum phlebotomiae iuuamentum est.	The bazilica, which is a single vein among three veins, the phlebotomy with a knife is a good thing.
Quia extrahit sanguinem ex aegritudinibus, quae sunt sub gutture et collo, ex eo quod sequitur pectus, et uentrem: et conuenit phlebotomatori cum phlebotomat eam, ut caueat, et sit super timorem ex ea nam sub ea est arteria.	Because it draws blood from the ailments that are under the throat and the neck, which is next to the chest and the belly; and it is fitting for the phlebotomist to cauterize it, and let him fear what lies under it, because there is an artery.
Si ergo errat, et addit in punctura phlebotomi, incidet illam arteriam, et accidet fluxus sanguinis.	If therefore he should make a mistake, and he adds to the phlebotomy a piercing, he will strike that artery, and he will spill the flow of blood.
Quapropter oportet, ne phlebotomet eam cum phlebotomo pungente: imo sit secans cum Alnesil.	Therefore it is fitting, so that one does not pierce it with a phlebotomy needle: but let him dry it with Anelid.
Quod si non apparet Basilica apparitione manifesta, tunc oportet, ut alienes ipsam, et permuteris ad aliam, aut quaeras aliquem ramum eius: aut phlebotomes loco eius Funem brachii.	That if it does not appear with a manifest appearance, then one should remove it, and turn it to another, or you will seek a branch of it: or you will phlebotomize the place where it is.
Ipsa enim est manifesta, et seca eam cum phlebotomo Anesil, sicut diximus.	It itself is manifest, and dry it with Anelid phlebotomy, as we have said.
Si autem uis phlebotomiam ipsius eiusdem, tunc oportet ante stricturam brachii, ut tangas locum, donec cognoscas locum pulsus.	If, however, you wish to bloodlet him from himself, then it is necessary that you should strike before the stricture of the arm, so that you may touch the place, until you know the place of pulsation.
Deinde signa super locum cum encaustro, postea brachium, et seca uenam sectione concaua cum phlebotomo Alnesil, sicut diximus.	Then mark the spot with a causticum, then the arm, and dry up the vein with a cautery, as we have said.
Et caue ne cadat percussio per spacium a loco arteriae.	And let the percussion not fall away from the space of the artery.
Et quando uides, cum tu stringis ligamen, inflationem in loco quem signasti cum encaustro, tunc illa inflatio est inflatio arteriae: deuita ergo eam.	And when you see, when you tighten the ligament, the swelling in the place that you have marked with the causticum, then that swelling is the swelling of the artery: therefore remove it.
Quod si uides sanguinem apud phlebotomiam salire, sicut urina pueri, et est sanguis subtilis, rubeus: tunc scias, quia est ex sanguine arteriae.	That if you see the blood rising with the bloodletting, like a boy's urine, and it is thin blood, red: then you will know that it is from the blood of the artery.
Tunc ergo propera, et pone digitum tuum super ipsum spacio longo, deinde aufer digitum tuum.	Then therefore bring your hand near, and place your finger on the space for a long time, then remove your finger.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis (multotiens namque abscinditur) tunc stringe brachium, et dimitte ipsum: et caueat infirmus a motione eius: et sit super timorem eius.	And if blood is cut off (for it is often cut off) then tighten the arm, and release him: and let the injured be at rest from his movement: and sit on his fear.
Et non moueat ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	And let him not move for a few days, until he is healed.
Si autem non abscinditur sanguis, et uincit te: et non est tibi praesens in momento tuo medicina, tunc incide arteriam, si apparet tibi.	But if blood is not cut off, and it overpowers you: and there is no present medicine for you in the moment of your need, then strike an artery, if it appears to you.
Nam extremitates eius contrahuntur, et abscinditur sanguis.	For its extremities do contract, and blood is cut off.
Aut accipe corticem fistici, et finde eum: accipe medietatem unam, et stringe eam super locum uenae strictura decenti, cum ligamento et puluillis usque ad diem alium.	Or take a piece of cork, and find it: take a half, and tighten it on the place of the stricture of the vein going down, with a ligament and powder until another day.
Tunc si abscinditur sanguis, est bonum.	Then if blood is cut off, it is good.
Et si non: tunc cura ipsum cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio ex loco puluerum abscindentium fluxum sanguinis: et abscisio sanguinis eius non est difficilis in pluribus dispositionibus, propter locum paruum uulneris, et possibilitatem ligamenti ex brachio.	And if not: then take care of the person with him, remembering the place where the blood was cut off: and cutting off his blood is not difficult in many dispositions, because of the small wound, and the possibility of a ligament from the arm.
¶ De phlebotomia uenae Fuscae.	On the venesection of the dark-colored blood.
Venae autem Fuscae phlebotomiae iuuamentum est, quod trahit sanguinem ex superiori parte capitis, et inferiore corporis: propterea, quia est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae, sicut diximus.	But the venesection of the dark-colored blood is a procedure that draws blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body: therefore, because it is composed of the branch of the Basilica and the branch of theCephalica, as we have said.
Et conuenit phlebotomanti eam, ut sit super timorem ex phlebotomia eius, nam sub ea est neruus.	And it belongs to the phlebotomist to do this, lest he suffer from phlebotomy, because under it is a nerve.
Si ergo addit in punctura phlebotomi, et inuenit neruum, accidit in ea stupor, et difficilis fit sanatio eius, et fortasse non sanatur penitus.	If therefore he adds to the venesection of phlebotomy and finds a nerve, it happens that he falls into a stupor, and his recovery is difficult, and perhaps does not recover completely.
Et iste neruus multotiens apparet sensui.	And this nerve appears often to the sense.
Si autem occultatur in quibusdam hominibus, et est subtilis, et non ostenditur: tunc oportet ut ponas phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas, sectionem cum Alnesil, et deuita neruum cum fortitudine tua.	But if it is hidden in some people, and is slender, and does not show itself: then you should place your phlebotomy so that the phlebotomist makes a section with Alnecil, and απομακρύνει τα νεύρα με τη δική σας αντοχή.
Quod si uena est inter duos neruos, tunc finde uenam in longitudine.	That if the vein is between two nerves, then find a vein in length.
¶ De uena Cephalica.	On the cerebral vein.
Phlebotomiae autem uenae Cephalicae iuuamentum est, quia attrahit sanguinem ex capite, et confert ad aegritudines oculorum.	But the procedure for venesection of the cerebral vein is that it draws blood from the head and contributes to the ailments of the eyes.
Et oportet in hac uena proprie, si uis, ut phlebotomes eam pungendo cum phlebotomo oliuari, aut cum phlebotomo myrtino: quoniam est saluior uenarum omnium, quoniam non est subea arteria, neque neruus.	And you should use the proper oil in this vein if you want to, so that the phlebotomist pricks it with the phlebotome's olive oil, or with the phlebotome's myrrh: for this is the salvation of all veins, because it is not an arterial vein, nor a nerve.
Verumtamen conuenit tibi apud phlebotomiam, ut deuites cum phlebotomo caput lacerti tantum, et quaeras locum leniorem: et non nocet ei, si non inuenitur cum percussione prima, ut iteretur super eam cum phlebotomia aliquotiens.	But you should be careful with the venesection, so that you only take the head of the laceration and find a more comfortable place: and it does not hurt him if, after the first blow, he does not return to it with venesection from time to time.
Verumtamen fortasse apostematur in quibusdam hominibus quando non phlebotomatur in percussione prima, sed non nocet ei illud apostema in aliquo.	But perhaps he bleeds when he is not venesected at first blow, but it does not hurt him that bleeding from time to time, if it happens in some people.

First, then, of what you should be aware, that phlebotomy is administered not for the sake of health but to preserve it, and its persistence and caution from the advent of illness.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in una uenarum trium quae sunt in cubito, scilicet Cephalica, et Fusca, et Basilica.	And so that phlebotomy is performed in one of three positions which a person lies in bed, namely the cephalic, the femoral, and the bazal.

Phlebotomia autem quae administratur in aegritudinibus, non habet horam determinatam: sed quando prouocat conuenientia et necessitas ad illud, in nocte, aut die, et in omni hora, et in omni tempore.	But phlebotomy which is administered to the sick does not have a determined hour; but when it elicits convenience and necessity towards it, at night, or by day, and at all times, and in all places.
Et non oportet, ut phlebotomentur pueri, donec ueniant super eos quatuordecim anni.	And it is not appropriate that boys should be phlebotomized until they are fourteen years old.
Neque phlebotometur mulier praegnans, nisi a mense quarto usque ad septimum.	Nor should a pregnant woman be phlebotomized until the fourth month up to the seventh month.
Neque phlebotomentur senes, qui iam pertransierunt sexaginta annos.	Nor should elderly people be phlebotomized who have already passed the age of sixty.
Cum ergo aliquis uult phlebotomari propter quemcumque modum sit: oportet, ut mundificet intestina sua ante phlebotomiam cum clisteri leni, si in eis est stercus multum retentum: ut non attrahant uenae apud phlebotomiam ex intestinis superfluitates putridas nocentes membris principalibus.	When anyone is to be phlebotomized, it is necessary that he should clean his intestines before phlebotomy with a laxative, if there is much waste retained in them: so that the blood does not attract venereal diseases from the intestines through the main veins.
Neque phlebotometur patiens toctina, id est, satietatem nauseatiuam: neque crapulatus, neque euadens ab ebrietate, donec remoueatur illud ab eis.	Nor should a patient who is aching or nauseous from fasting be phlebotomized, nor should those who are drunk have it taken away from them until they have recovered from their intoxication.
Neque infirmus cum hydropisi.	Nor should an invalid with hydrops be phlebotomized.
Et caueatur phlebotomia iterum post colicam passionem, et uomitum, et fluxum uentris, et multiplicationem coitus, et laboris, et exercitii, et uigiliarum, et ieiunii, et omnis quod dissoluit uirtutem ex re corporea aut animali.	And let phlebotomy be repeated again after a fasting fever, and a lack of appetite, and a flow of urine, and an increase in sexual activity, and labor, and exercise, and vigils, and fasting, and all that dissolves virtue from the body or animal.
Deinde considera in subtilitate humorum ante illud, si sanguis est grossus cum cibis et potibus, et medicinis: si possibile est ei illud.	Then consider in subtlety of humors before that, if blood is thick with food and drink, and medicines: if possible is him that.
Deinde introeat balneum, si non prohibet ipsum aliquid: aut exercitetur aliquo exercitio, ut subtilietur sanguis.	Then let the bath be introduced, if anything does not prohibit it: or he exercises a little exercise, in order to refine the blood.
Et pone phlebotomiam eius in pectore, circa tertiam diei, sicut diximus: et conare, ut euacuetur pectus eius illa die ex omnibus accidentibus animalibus malis: sicut angustia, et ira, et timor: et ex omnibus accidentibus corporeis, sicut labor, et poena, et superfluicoitus, et illis similia.	And place the phlebotomy on his chest in his bosom, about the third day, as we have said: and be careful, that his chest should be drained of that blood that day from all animal bad accidents: such as anger, fear: and all bodily accidents, such as labor, punishment, excesses, and those like them.
Et sedi suae faciat esse praesentes res cum quarum usu cucurrit consuetudo hominum ex aromaticitate, et odoramento, et tripudio et similibus illis per quantitatem possibilitatis.	And make these things available to him: because the custom of men is that they have always used aromatic substances, and their fragrance, and festivity, and such like, through the quantity of possibility.
Deinde sedeat phlebotomator super puluinari, quod sit altius quam puluinar phlebotomandi: postea extrahat brachium suum, et fricet ipsum phlebotomator manu sua bis, aut ter.	Then let the phlebotomist sit on a table, that it be higher than the phlebotomy table: then he shall take his arm, and rub it with his own hand twice, or three times.
Deinde stringat ligamentum cum corrigia, et inuoluat eam bis.	Then let him tie the ligature with the cord, and roll it up once.
Et sit strictura temperata, quoniam strictura quando est inaequalis, aut per superfluitatem in strictura, tunc prohibet cursum sanguinis: aut in mollificatione, tunc etiam prohibet cursum sanguinis.	And let the constriction be strict, because constriction is unequal, or by excess in the constriction, then it prohibits the course of blood: or in softening, then also it prohibits the course of blood.
Deinde post stricturam oportet, ut fricet phlebotomandus manus suas simul adinuicem, donec inflentur uenae, et declarentur sensui.	Then after the constriction, let the phlebotomist rub his hands together skin to skin, until the veins swell, and present themselves to the sense.
Deinde abstergat phlebotomator phlebotomum cum pauco oleo, antiquo proprie.	Then let the phlebotomist wipe the phlebotomy with a little oil, old, of his own proper.
Deinde ponat digitum suum indicem manus sinistrae super ipsam uenam sub loco cuius phlebotomiam uult, parum: ut non fugiat uena, et cassetur percussio.	Then let he put his right index finger of his left hand on the vein at the place where he intends to make a phlebotomy, little: so that the vein does not run away, and the piercing noise is not heard.
Quoniam ex uenis est quam inuenis sicut chordam fugientem apud phlebotomiam: et ex eis est quae est plena uentositate: et quando ponis phlebotomum super eam, contrahitur sub phlebotomo, et decipitur phlebotomator, et non aperit phlebotomus uenam: et si aperit eam, est stricta: propter illud ergo oportet, ut firmetur phlebotomator, et sit sollicitus in his rebus omnibus.	For the veins are like a cord running away when making a phlebotomy: and those are full of blood: and when you put the phlebotomy on them, it is pinched under the phlebotomy, and deceives the phlebotomist, and does not open the vein: and if it opens it, then it is constricted: therefore, in all these things, let the phlebotomist rub himself, and be careful in these things.
Deinde deponat phlebotomum.	Then deposit the phlebotomy.
Si ergo aperitur uena ex uice una, tunc bonum est.	If then a new wound opens from one vein, then it is good.
Et si non, tunc itera illud uice alia sub illo loco parum, aut supra ipsum cum festinatione: si non apostematur locus.	And if not, then repeat the other vein beneath that place a little, or above it with haste: if not the place swells up.
Quod si apostematur, aut expauescit infirmus, tunc dimitte eum die, aut duobus diebus: et non stringat ligamentum.	What if it swells up, or if the patient is feeble, then let him be discharged after one or two days: and do not tie a ligature tightly.
Fortasse enim attrahet apostema calidum.	For perhaps the swelling will be drawn in by the heat.
Neque ingrediatur balneum.	And do not put him into a bath.
Deinde iteret phlebotomiam, si amat.	Then repeat the phlebotomy if he likes it.
Quod si apertio est parua, aut currit sanguis subtiliter: et times ut non egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uis: tunc itera phlebotomum in foramine ipso secundum rectitudinem, et adde in operatione parum.	What if the opening is small, or blood flows lightly: and be careful not to lose a quantity of blood more than you draw out: then repeat the phlebotomy in the same hole again, and add something to the procedure.
Et fac illud cum festinatione, antequam apostemetur locus, apostematus enim locus est in multis hominibus apud operationem paruam.	And do it quickly, before the place swells up: for the place will swell up in many people during a short time.
Si ergo uides ipsum iam apostematum, tunc non iteres super ipsum omnino, non enim excusat apud te aliquid.	If then you see that he has already swelled up, then do not repeat the phlebotomy at all, for it does not excuse you with him for anything.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex faece olei: quoniam alleuiat cursum sanguinis.	And put something on the spot from a fat oil: for it will ease the course of blood.
Et est melior in hoc loco quam oleum ipsum, et quam reliqua olea.	And this place is better than his own oil, and other oils better.
Et similiter administra faecem olei in omni phlebotomia tua, qua phlebotomas uenas apud prohibitionem cursus sanguinis: et faciunt illud tyriaca alfarach, et sagzenea, quando ponitur ex una earum super locum.	And likewise administer the fat oil in all your phlebotomies when you want to stop the course of blood: and they make it with myrrh when put on from one of these spots.
Sanguis enim subtiliatur et resoluitur, quando est grossus.	For blood is thickened and resolved when it is thin.
Quod si accidat in loco phlebotomiae apostema magnum, nam multotiens accidit, praecipue ei qui non est phlebotomatus nisi uice illa, aut est apertio uenae parua, tunc propera et pone super locum spongiam infusam in aqua et sale, calefacta parumper: et stringe eam hora una: quoniam soluitur.	What if a great swelling occurs in the place where the phlebotomy has been made, for this often happens, especially when one has not had phlebotomy at that place before, or if a small opening has occurred, then bind it and put over the spot a sponge dipped in warm water and salt, and heat it slightly: and tie it up after an hour: for it is resolved.
Et oportet, ut facias illud post exitum sanguinis ex uena ipsa, cum complemento sui, aut ex uena alia.	It is necessary that you do this after the blood has come out from the wound itself with its own supply, or from another wound.
Quod si remanet in loco post dies aliquid nigredinis, aut uiriditatis, non nocet illud: et si uis, pone super ipsum aliquid aloe, aut myrrhae solutorum: aut aliquid ex succo menthastri, id est, calamenti aut simile illius.	Which if it remains in the place for some days of redness or swelling does not harm that; and if there is a wound, put on it some aloe, or dissolved myrrh: or some juice of peppermint, that is, of calamus or similar to it.
Et multotiens quidem accidunt apostemata et eminentiae apud phlebotomiam Basilicae.	And many times indeed have there occurred injuries and eminences with phlebotomy in the Basilica.
Pone ergo manum tuam super ipsam, tunc si inuenis molliciem apud compressionem tuam super ipsam, tunc illa eminentia est mala.	So place your hand over it, then if it is soft to the touch when you press it with your hand, then that eminence is bad.
Caue ergo, ut ponas super eam aliquid ex eo quod diximus.	Therefore, so that you put on it some of that which we have said.
Nam fortasse fluet ex ea sanguis arteriae.	For perhaps it will flow from it blood of an artery.
Sed fac emplastrum ei cum eo in quo est stipticitas, ut induretur locus.	But make a poultice with it where there is a stain so that the place hardens.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the wound with the rest of the cure, until it heals.
Et oportet, ut extrahas omni homini ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis suae.	And it is necessary that you should give every man blood by the amount of his own virtue.
Et quod apparet ex colore uincente super sanguinem.	And that which appears from a red color on the blood.
Nam sanguis si est niger, tunc dimitte ipsum exire, donec rubeat: et similiter si uides ipsum grossum: tunc dimitte eum, donec subtilietur: et similiter si est acutus, donec auferatur acuitas eius.	For if the blood is black, then let it not come out until it turns red; and likewise if you see it thick: then let it not go out until it thins out; and likewise if it is sharp, then let the sharpness go out from it.
Et oportet ei qui est plenus, fortis, et indiget extractione sanguinis uice una, ut amplificetur phlebotomia uenae, et sit phlebotomus latus: et in eo qui est debilis, sit econtrario illius.	And it is necessary for the one who is full, strong, and resistant to the extraction of blood by a single vein, so that phlebotomy of the green increases, and the phlebothomist stands on the side: but in the weak, stand opposite to it.
Et oportet, ut extrahat ipsum in uicibus, et ut sit foramen strictum: et melius quod administratur in phlebotomia uenae est, ut sit transuersa sectio, non punctura.	And it is necessary that he should draw out the wound with a tight hole, and it is better that which is administered in phlebotomy of the green is, so that it is a transverse section, not a cut.
Et iste modus phlebotomiae est saluus a fluxu sanguinis, et ab incisione nerui: et est laudabilior, et saluior quam phlebotomia per latitudinem et longitudinem.	And this method of phlebotomy is safer from the flow of blood, and from incising a nerve: and it is more praiseworthy, and healthier than phlebotomy by the width and length.
Et cui consueuit peruenire apud phlebotomiam syncopis, oportet ut cibes ante phlebotomiam modico pane infuso in aqua granati muzi: aut secaniabin, si est calefactus: et extrahas ei ex sanguine in tribus uicibus, aut quatuor.	And to whom it is usual to syncopis when phlebotomizing, it is necessary that he eat before phlebotomy a little bread infused with water of granate and muslin: or if he is warmed up, secaniabin; and let him squeeze out blood from the three veins, or four.
Et si est infrigidatae complexionis, tunc accipiat ante phlebotomiam panem infusum in syrupo miua, aut in syrupo de melle aromatizato cum speciebus, aut in syrupo aromatizato odorifero.	And if the complexion is frigid, then he should take before phlebotomy a little bread infused in syrup of myrrh, or in syrup of honey perfumed with spices, or in perfumed syrup with fragrant species.
Quod si accidat syncopis apud phlebotomiam, et est caussa eius exitus sanguinis multi: tunc oportet, ut sumat in potu aquam carnis, et syrupum odoriferum subtilem: et utatur aromaticitate cum algalia, et liniatur pectus eius cum ea: et utatur reliquis quae diximus in diuisione in capitulo syncopis ex euacuatione.	That if it happens syncopis during phlebotomy, and is the cause of its output of blood much: then it is necessary that he takes in a cup water of meat, and perfumed syrup: and he uses aromatic with algalia, and he spreads his chest with it: and he uses the rest that we have said in the division in the chapter syncopis from the evacuation.
Qui autem uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo: oportet ei cuius phlebotomia est propter euacuationem multam, et uirtus eius est debilis, ut soluat sanguinem paulatim per quantitatem uirtutis in diebus continuis.	Whoever wants to heal his arm, and let his blood run out: it is necessary for him who whose phlebotomy is for great euacuation, and its power is weak, to let his blood run out little by little through the quantity of power in continuous days.
Qui uero uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo, et est corpus eius forte: tunc faciat illud post septem horas, aut nouem a phlebotomia sua prima.	Whoever wants to heal his arm, and let his blood run out second time, and his body is strong: then he should do it after seven hours, or nine from his first phlebotomy.
Qui autem uult attrahere sanguinem ex corpore suo ad contrarium partis ad quam declinat: oportet ut euentetur ei in die secundo, aut in tertio.	Whoever wants to attract blood from his body to the opposite part of which he leans: it is necessary that he should do it on the second day, or on the third.
In cuius uero corpore est sanguis multus iam calefactus, et acuitur, et facit accidere febrem: oportet, ut egrediatur ex eo sanguis in uice una, et extrahatur ex eo quantitas multa: et amplificetur apertio usquequo accidat syncopis: postquam tu fueris conseruans omnes conditiones phlebotomiae: et ut ponas manum tuam super pulsum eius apud cursum sanguinis, ut non accidat mors loco syncopis.	In whose body is now much blood warmed up, and it becomes acute, and causes a fever: it is necessary that he should go out of it in a single beat, and extract from it a lot of quantity: and it increases the opening until syncopis happens: after which you have preserved all conditions of phlebotomy: and let you put your hand on his pulse at the course of blood, so that death does not happen at the place of syncopsis.
Multotiens enim accidit illud, quando ignorat phlebotomator, et cadit negligentia.	Therefore, it often happens that the phlebotomist does not know and falls by negligence.
Et non oportet quando uis soluere brachium, et soluere sanguinem secundo, cum iam clausum sit orificium uenae, et fiat difficilis exitus sanguinis, ut prematur super ipsum cum uehementia, et curuatum extendatur uelociter.	And it is not fitting that when you wish to cut the arm and draw blood in the second place, you draw the blood while the orifice of the vein is already closed, and make the exit of the blood difficult, so that it presses down on itself with a sudden movement, and extends quickly.
Nam illud est malum ualde, imo dimitte ipsum, donec phlebotometur secundo.	For this is an evil thing: let go of it at once until the phlebotomist draws blood in the second place.
Aut remoue cum acuitate phlebotomi illud quod coagulatum est ex sanguine in orificio uenae, et pone super ipsum aliquid salis dissoluti in aqua.	Or take away the coziment of the blood which is in the orifice of the vein with the phlebotomist, and put a little dissolved salt in water on it.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex tyriaca alfaroch, aut sagzenea, et pone ipsum compressione leni, donec egrediatur sanguis.	And put on it some of the tar-salt or green-salt, and put the compress on it slightly, until the blood exits.
Si uero iam apostemata est uena, tunc dimitte eam, et non tegas eam, donec sedetur apostema.	But if the vein is already torn, then let go of it, and do not tie it up, until it cicatrizes.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad soluendum sanguinem secundo, et non est excusatio, tunc aut phlebotoma ipsum supra illum locum, aut in brachio alio in uena alia.	That if necessity compels you to draw blood a second time, and there is no excuse, then either phlebotomize the person above that place, or in another arm at another vein.
Funis autem brachii phlebotomatur loco Fuscae, et Basilicae, cum non inueniuntur, et sunt occultae, quoniam est composita ex eis.	But the vein of the arm is phlebotomized in the place of the Musculi, and Basilicae, which are not visible, because it is made up of them.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus manum suam in aqua calida, donec rubeat focile, et appareat uena manifeste.	And the quality of his phlebotomy is such that he puts his own hand into hot water, until it turns red, and the vein appears clearly.
Deinde stringatur super ipsam cum ligamento parum constrictione media.	Then tie it tightly on top with a little constriction of the middle ligature.
Deinde phlebotoma secundum transuersationem paulatim, non latitudinaliter, neque secundum longitudinem: et sit apertio ampla, et sit phlebotomia tua qua eam phlebotomas super iuncturam manus parumper.	Then phlebotomize the second time slowly, not widely and not along its length; and let the opening be broad, and your phlebotomy should be done just above the knuckle, so that it does not hurt as much.
Quod si prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera manum in aqua calida, et dimitte sanguinem currere in aqua, donec consequaris necessitatem tuam.	That if the exit of the blood is prevented, then repeat your hand in hot water, and let the blood run into the water until you satisfy your need.
Si autem fueris in diebus aestatis, tunc excusaris ab iteratione manus in aqua calida.	But if you are in summer days, then you are excused from washing your hands in warm water.
Et plurimum quidem ponitur cursus sanguinis in aqua calida in tempore hyemis.	And indeed a great deal is put forth regarding the flow of blood in hot water during the cold season.
Et phlebotomia huius uenae est saluior omnibus uenis, quoniam non est sub ea uena pulsatilis, neque neruus.	And phlebotomy of this vein is healthier for all veins, since it is not pulsatile and there are no nerves.
Phlebotomia uero Saluatellae manus dextrae, est conferens aegritudinibus epatis.	But phlebotomy of the right hand is salutary for people with liver ailments.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringas mahason manus cum ligamento, aut manu tua, postquam tu intromittis eam in aquam calidam, donec infletur uena, et demonsteretur sensui ualde.	And the quality of phlebotomy is such that you should wrap the hand with a ligature, or your hand, after having introduced it into warm water, until the vein constricts and clearly feels very sensibly.
Deinde phlebotoma eam transuersando.	Then phlebotomize her by passing through.
Et si incidis eam totaliter, non nocebit ei illud in aliquo.	And if you cut her entirely, it will not hurt her at all.
Et conserua, ne ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo.	And preserve, do not introduce your hand after phlebotomy.
Sub ea enim sunt nerui digitorum denudati ex carne.	For under it are the nerves of the fingers denuded from the flesh.
Deinde itera manum ad aquam calidam, et dimitte currere sanguinem in ea.	Then repeat your hand to warm water, and let the blood run in it.
Nam si tu non iteras eam in aqua calida, coagulatur sanguis in orificio uenae, et prohibetur a cursu.	For if you do not repeat the hand in warm water, the blood will coagulate at the opening of the vein, and the flow will be prevented.
Cum ergo extraxeris ex sanguine quantitatem necessitatis, tunc pone super uenam oleum et sal: ut non consolidetur uelociter.	But when you extract a quantity of blood as required, then put oil and salt on the vein so that it does not harden quickly.
Et similiter oportet, ut facias cum omni ramo stricto.	And likewise you should do, as you make with every tight branch.
Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae eius ex manu sinistra, est: quoniam est conferens ad aegritudines splenis: et similiter fac in phlebotomia eius, sicut fecisti in secunda aequaliter.	But the procedure of phlebotomy from the left hand is: for it is suited to liver ailments; and likewise do with phlebotomy as you did with the second equally.
Saphenae autem phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad aegritudines quae sunt in inferiori parte corporis, sicut aegritudines matricum, et retentionem menstruorum, et infirmitates renum, et ulcera coxarum et crurium antiqua, et similia ex aegritudinibus.	But the phlebotomy of the saphenous vein is for ailments that are in the lower part of the body, such as liver ailments, and retention of menstruation, and diseases of the kidneys and bladder, and old ulcers of the legs and buttocks, and similar ailments from diseases.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus pedem suum in aquam calidam: et faciat super ipsum fricationem, donec exuberent uenae: et liga supra iuncturam pedis cum corrigia.	And the quality of phlebotomy is such that he should introduce his weak foot into warm water; and let him make friction over it until the veins give off a strong scent, and then bind above the ankle with a ligature.
Et uenae quidem locus est apud calcaneum, apparens uersus pollicem: et ramificantur ex ea in facie pedis rami multi.	And indeed the site is at the heel, which appears opposite the thumb: and many branches extend from it on the face of the foot.
Phlebotoma ergo eam in ampliore ramo eius, aut apud calcaneum in aggregatione eius: quoniam est melius et saluius.	Therefore, let us draw blood from it in a larger branch of its or near the heel in a group of its: for it is better and healthier.
Quod si phlebotomas eam in facie pedis, tunc caue a neruis qui sunt sub ea super faciem pedis.	That if you draw blood from it on the face of the foot, then be careful of the nerves that are under it on the face of the foot.
Et pone phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas ex transuerso, quasi tu uelis incidere eam: et sit phlebotomus Nesil.	And place your phlebotomy where you wish to draw blood from behind, so that you do not want to injure it: and let the phlebotomist be safe.
Si autem prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera pedem eius in aqua calida: et dimitte sanguinem currere in eam, donec euacuatur.	But if the flow of blood is prohibited, then turn over his foot into warm water: and let the blood not run into it until it has been emptied.
Quod si errat uenam phlebotomator in prima uice, tunc iteret cum phlebotomia ad superiora parumper, nam locus est saluus, et non times ex eo maliciam, quando tu caues a neruis, sicut diximus.	That if the phlebotomist has made a mistake in the first cut, then let him keep with the phlebotomy to the upper part somewhat, for the site is healthy, and do not be afraid of injury from it when you draw blood, as we have said.
Et similiter cum Saphena pedis alterius aequaliter.	And also with the saphenous vein of the other foot equally.
Venae autem Sciaticae locus, sicut diximus, est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	But the location of the sciatic veins, as we have said, is at the heel from the side of the forest.
Et iuuamentum phlebotomiae eius est, ad dolorem anchae, quando est propter sanguinem calidum.	And the support for the phlebotomy is, to the pain of the ankle, when it is because of warm blood.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut ingrediatur infirmus balneum, et festinet: et stringe crus eius a latere anchae usque supra calcaneum quatuor digitis, cum uitta subtili longa: non enim apparet nisi propter illud.	And the quality of the phlebotomy is, that it may enter into a weak bath and quicken: and tighten his leg from the side of the ankle up to the heel with four fingers, for it does not appear unless because of it.
Quando ergo apparet, tunc phlebotoma eam secundum quodcumque ingenium est tibi possibile, aut secundum transuersionem: et est melius, aut ut incidas eam incisione, aut seces eam sectione.	When it does appear, then draw blood from it according to whatever ability you have, or its transmutation: and it is better, or as if you want to injure it, or separate it by a cut.
Locus enim eius est saluior, et ipsa est in pluribus hominibus occulta ualde.	For the site of it is healthier, and it itself is hidden in many people greatly.
Quod si non inuenis eam, et non apparet sensui omnino: tunc phlebotoma aliquem ramum eius, et est ille qui apparet in dorso pedis, et uersus auricularem: et caue a neruis, et fac currere ex sanguine quantitatem quam uis.	That if you do not injure it, and does not appear at all to the sense: then draw blood from one of its branches, and that appears on the back of the foot, and opposite the ear: and be careful of the nerves, and let the blood run in a certain amount as you wish.
Deinde solue stricturam, et pone super locum phlebotomiae corium, et stringe locum.	Then cut away tightly, and place the skin over the site of bleeding, and tighten the site.
Uelociter enim sanatur.	For this quickly heals.
¶ De Ventosatione, et qualitate usus eius.	(The text continues with a discussion of ventosisation and its quality of use.)
Caput XCVIII.	TITLE On Ventosation
Uentosae fiunt ex cornibus, et ex aere, et ex uitro.	Bones are made from horns, and from brass, and from urine.
Et Ventosatio quidem fit secundum duos modos.	And Ventosection is done according to two ways.
Cum scarificatione, et extractione sanguinis: et alter est uentosatio sine scarificatione.	When with scarification and drawing of blood, and one is ventilating without scarification.
Et haec Ventosatio quae est sine scarificatione, est secundum duos modos.	And this Ventosection which is without scarification, is according to two ways.
Aut enim est cum igne.	Or indeed it is with fire.
Aut est absque igne.	Or is without fire.
Et uentosis quae administrantur cum scarificatione et extractione sanguinis sunt quatuordecim loca corporis.	And the ventilations which are administered with scarification and drawing of blood, are four dozen places in the body.
Quorum unus est, Ventosatio Alnocrati, et est postremum capitis: et Alkehel, et est medium colli: et uentosae Alhagdahim, et sunt duae laminae colli a duabus partibus simul: et uentosae menti, et est sub mandibula in inferiori oris: et uentosae duarum spatularum: et uentosae Alachosos super finem caudae: et uentosae duorum focilium, et sunt medium duorum brachiorum: et uentosae duorum crurium: et uentosae duarum cauillarum.	Of which one is Ventosection of the Al-Nocrati, and it is lastly of the head: and Alkhel, and it is middle of the neck: and uentosae Alhagdahim, and they are two laminae of the neck from both sides simultaneously: and uentosae of the mind, and it is under the mandible in the lower mouth: and uentosae of the two spatulas: and uentosae of the tail end: and uentosae of the two fires, and they are middle of the two arms: and uentosae of the two legs: and uentosae of the two shanks.
Et Ventosatio quidem non extrahit sanguinem tibi ex uenis minutis sparsis in carne, et propter illud non cadit uirtus ex eis, sicut est casus eius ex phlebotomia.	And indeed the ventilation does not draw blood from you out of small scattered veins in the flesh, and for this reason the power does not come out of them, such as is the case with phlebotomy.
Neque oportet, ut administretur uentosatio siue cum igne, aut absque igne in aliqua aegritudinum quae fiunt ex repletione, donec euacuetur totum corpus.	And it is not necessary that ventilation is administered with fire or without fire in any sickness which is caused by fullness, until the whole body is emptied.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad Ventosationem ex aegritudine, aut propter consuetudinem, administramus eam in omni hora in principio mensis, in fine eius, et in medio ipsius, et in quocumque tempore fuerit.	That if necessity calls for ventilation from sickness, or because of custom, we shall administer it at any hour at the beginning of the month, at the end of it, and at its middle, and at whatever time it shall be.
Quod est, quia ex hominibus est qui quando multiplicatur in eo sanguis, donec indiget extractione eius per uentosationem, inuenit in capite suo grauedinem, et sodahan.	That is, for a man is one who, when he is multiplied with blood, until he needs extraction by ventilation, finds in his head a great swelling, and swells.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit repletionem et rubedinem in facie sua, capite suo, et collo suo.	And of them is one who finds fullness and redness on his face, on his head, and on his neck.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit pruritum in facie sua, et fronte sua, et tenebrositatem, et hebetudinem in oculis suis.	And from these comes the itch in his face and forehead, and darkness and dullness in his eyes.
Et ex eis est qui scalpit locum uentosationis suae.	And from these comes the scalp, which is full of hair.
Et ex eis est cuius risus multiplicatur.	And from these comes the riser, who laughs a lot.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit gustum sanguinis in ore suo: aut apostematur lingua, et expuit sanguinem.	And from these comes one who finds the taste of blood in his mouth, or spits it out with his tongue, and swallows it.
Et ex eis est cuius somnus multiplicatur.	And from these comes the one whose sleep is disturbed.
Et ex eis est qui uidet in somno suo sanguinem et rubedinem, et interfectos, et plagas, et quae sunt similia illis.	Who sees blood and red color in his dream, and those who have been killed, and plagues, and things like that.
Quando ergo uidemus aliquid ex illis, et proprie si est in tertia media mensis: praecipimus tunc uentosationem fieri, postquam praeterierunt de die duae horae, aut tres.	When we then see anything from them, and especially if it is on the third day of the month: then let us make the scalp appear, after having passed two or three hours since morning.
Iuuamentum autem Ventosationis nuchae, est: quoniam ipsa confert ad grauitatem in capite, et quod effunditur ad oculos.	But the sign of the scalp is this: for it brings a burden to the head and that it flows down to the eyes.
At uero oportet, ut sit illud post euacuationem totius corporis.	But it should be after the evacuation of the whole body.
Et haec quidem Ventosa est loco phlebotomiae Cephalicae.	And this is called a scalp because it has been pulled by phlebotomy of the head.
Et non licet, ut utatur ea qui est frigidae complexionis, aut in quo est catarrus.	And it should not be worn by one who has a cold complexion, or one who is hoarse.
Nam infert ei nocumentum magnum.	For it does great harm.
Et propter illud non oportet, ut utantur ea senes, et in cuius capite sunt aegritudines frigidae.	And for this reason it should not be worn by the elderly, and not by those who have cold ailments in their heads.
Qui autem super eam fit assiduus, generatur super eum obliuio.	But he who is diligent with it, falls into oblivion.
Et propter illud oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut deponat manum suam cum uentosa parumper ad inferiora, timendo ex generatione obliuionis.	And for this reason you should order the scalper to put his hand with the scalp when it is somewhat lower down, fearing the generation of oblivion.
Ventosatio aut Alkehel, est loco phlebotomiae Fuscae, et phlebotomiae Basilicae, et propter illud confert asmati, et constrictioni anhelitus, et fissurae instrumenti anhelitus, et tussi, et repletioni.	Ventosation or alkohl is the place of phlebotomy of the brown vein, and phlebotomies of the basilic veins, and for this reason it brings sneezing, constriction of the throat, fissures in the instrument of constriction, coughing, and filling up.
Et oportet, ut impellatur Ventosa Alkehel parumper, quoniam si ponitur inferius, generat debilitatem in corde, et stomacho.	And it should be driven out by alkohl thoroughly, for if it is put below, it generates weakness in the heart and stomach.
Ventosatio uero alhagdahim, confert doloribus accidentibus in capite, et obtalmiae, et hemigraneae, et perforationi, et dolori in radicibus dentium: et est loco phlebotomiae Basilicae.	To draw out wind and the agues, observe the pains of the head, and eyes, and headache, and perforations, and pain in the roots of the teeth; and it is the place for phlebotomy at the Basilica.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne premat manum suam cum scarificatione: ut non incidat arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And you should prevent the ventosator from holding his hand too soon with the scarification, lest he hit an artery and cause a rush of blood to flow.
Ventosatio autem sub mento, confert alcolae in ore, et corruptioni gingiuae, et similibus eis ex aegritudinibus quae sunt in ore: et stat loco phlebotomiae alieherich, quae sunt in duobus labiis.	But if it is under the chin, observe the wines in the mouth, and corruption of the gums, and similar ailments that are in the mouth; and it is the place for phlebotomy elsewhere, which are in the two lips.
Ventosatio autem spatularum, confert ad alchafacham, quae fit ex replexione, et caliditate.	But if it is with the spatula, observe toward the alchafach (a type of wound), which is made by retraction and heat.
Ventosatio uero interiorum partium duorum focilium, confert iuuamentum phlebotomiae uenarum trium, Basilicae, et Fuscae, et Cephalicae: quoniam ipsa attrahit sanguinem ex omnibus illis uenis minutis, quae sunt in carne: et attrahunt illae uenae minutae ex uenis aliis grossioribus eis, donec peruenit attractio ad uenas tres.	However, if it is in the internal parts of the two folds (of the skin), observe the phlebotomy of the three veins, Basilica, Fusca, and Cephalica: for they draw blood from all the small veins that are in the flesh; and these small veins draw the blood from other larger veins until they reach the three veins.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne multum procedat in scarificatione: quoniam locus est denudatus carne, et sub eo sunt nerui et arteriae.	And you should prevent the ventosator from proceeding too far with the scarification: for the place is bare of flesh, and beneath it are nerves and arteries.
Ventosa autem quae uentosatur super alchausos, confert hemorroidibus Ani, et ulceribus inferioribus.	But if it is a ventosation that vents on the alchaus, observe the hemorrhoids of the anus, and ulcers lower down.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut sit uentosa magna, et ut sit ex aere: quoniam locus indiget suctione forti, et fortasse franguntur Ventosae subtiles: et scarificetur scarificatione magna.	And you should prevent the ventosator from making it too large, and from making it of iron: for the place does not tolerate strong suction, and perhaps the fine ones break; and it is scarified with a large scarification.
Ventosae autem crurium minuunt diminutione manifesta: quoniam attrahunt sanguinem ex toto corpore, et conferunt doloribus antiquis in renibus, et matricibus, et uesica: prouocant menstrua, et conferunt bothor, et ademenul: et stant loco phlebotomiae duarum saphenarum, et alhorcobeni.	But if the winds are in the crura, they diminish little by little: for they draw blood from all the body, and cause the old pains in the kidneys, and membranes, and bladder; they provoke menses, and cause bowel movements, and vomiting, and it is the place for phlebotomy between two saphenous veins, and alhorcobeni.
Verumtamen debilitant corpus multum, et faciunt accidere syncopim in pluribus hominibus.	Indeed, the body grows weak, and it often causes syncope in many people.
Et Ventosarum alhorcobeni iuuamentum est propinquum iuuamento Ventosarum duorum crurium.	And the pressure of the two krur winds is close to the pressure of the two krur winds.
Qualitas positionis Ventosarum est, ut ponas uentosam in primis uacuam, et sugas suctione temperata: et non prolonges positionem uentosarum, sed pone eas uelociter, et remoue eas uelociter, ut ueniant humores ad locum aduentu aequali: et non cesses iterare illud et continuare, donec uideas locum iam rubere et inflari, et appareat rubedo sanguinis: tunc ergo scarifica, et itera suctione paulatim.	The quality of the position of the winds is that you place the wind in the first place with a moderate pressure and do not prolong the position of the winds but put them quickly and move them quickly so that they bring the humors to the appropriate place: and do not cease to repeat this and continue, until it seems to you that the place has already become red and swollen, and it appears red blood: then therefore you make a incision, and repeat the suction slowly.
Deinde considera in dispositione corporum.	Then consider in the arrangement of the bodies.
Nam qui ex hominibus est tenerae carnis, rarorum pororum, oportet ut scarifices ipsum semel, non plus: ut non ulceretur locus.	For whoever among people has tender flesh and rare pores, it is necessary that he make the incision once, not more: so that the site does not ulcerate.
Et praecipe Ventosatori, ut amplificet scarificationem, et profundet parum: et temperet suctionem in facilitate, et uelocitate, et motu suaui.	And order the winds to amplify the incision and make it deep: and moderate the suction in ease, and speed, and smooth motion.
Quod si in sanguine est grossitudo, tunc oportet, ut scarifices ipsum bis.	If there is a lot of blood, then you should make the incision twice.
In uice quidem prima aperitur uia subtiliationi sanguinis, et aquositati eius: et in secunda quidem perscrutationi exquisitae extractionis sanguinis grossi.	Indeed, in the first place the way of the subtile blood is opened and made to flow: and in the second place, in the perscrutation of the exquisite extraction of thick blood.
Si uero sanguis est faeculentus ualde, tunc fiat scarificatio uice tertia: ut consequatur ultimum.	If, however, the blood is very foul, then let the incision be made in the fourth place: so that the last result is obtained.
Et ad ultimum, quando uolumus extrahere sanguinem paulatim, uel parumper, sufficit nobis scarificatio una.	And to the last, when we want to extract blood slowly, a little or not at all, one incision is enough for us.
Quod si uolumus extractionem sanguinis multi, scarificamus scarificatione plurima.	If we want to extract a lot of blood, let us make multiple incisions.
Et si nos mensuramus, quod sanguis est grossus: tunc oportet, ut scarificetur scarificatione profunda: et terminus aequalis in scarificatione, est profunditas cutis.	And if we measure that the blood is thick: then it is necessary that the incision be deep: and the equal term in the incision is the depth of the skin.
¶ Quid sit illud quod oportet administrari ex oleis apud positionem Ventosarum, et quid caueat uentosandus.	What is this that needs to be administered from oils when positioning the winds, and what does the wind-shift cause?
IN illo quidem cuius cutis est grossa, dura, fusca, et pori eius sunt stricti, oportet ut ungantur loca Ventosare cum oleis apertiuis, lenitiuis, resolutiuis: si est in tempore aestatis, sicut est oleum alkeiri, aut oleum uiolatum, aut oleum de amigdalis dulcibus, aut oleum de semine cucurbitae.	In that, indeed, whose skin is thick, tough, dark, and whose pores are tight, it is necessary that the places of Ventration be anointed with open, soothing, and resolute oils: if in season of summer, as is the oil of many, or the oil of black seed, or the oil of sweet almonds, or the oil of cucumber seed.
Et si est in tempore hyemis, tunc oleum narcissinum, aut oleum de lilio, aut oleum camomellinum, aut sarbatinum: et eis similia.	And if it is in season of winter, then the oil of narcissus, or the oil of lily, or the oil of chamomile, or the oil of sassafras: and to these similar ones.
Si uero superfluitas est grossa, frigida: tunc oleum sit amaracinum, aut oleum de balsamita aut oleum alben, aut oleum anetinum: et eis similia.	And if there is a superfluity of heat, then let it be the oil of amber, or the oil of myrrh, or the oil of albus, or the oil of annatto: and to these similar ones.
Si uero uentosandus est amplorum pororum, tenerae carnis: tunc oportet, ut prohibeatur ab oleo, et oportet ut isti abluant loca Ventosarum earum post uentosationem cum aqua rosata, aut cum aqua frigida, aut cum aqua solatri, aut cum aqua cucurbitae, aut cum aqua portulacae: et similibus eis.	And if it is windy and has wide pores and tender flesh, then it should be prevented from the oil, and these places of Ventration should be washed after wind with rose water, or cold water, or spring water, or cucumber water, or portulaca water: and similar to these.
Ille autem cuius sanguis est multae humiditatis, abluat uentosas cum aceto, aut cum aqua myrti, et sumach: et similibus eis.	But that which has much blood of humidity should wash the windy places with vinegar, or with myrtle water, and sumach: and similar to these.
Cuius autem superfluitates sunt grossae, abluat uentosas suas cum uino antiquo, aut cum aqua samsuci, aut decoctione aneti, aut camomillae: et eis similibus.	Whose superfluities are thick, should wash their windy places with old wine, or with samsou water, or with the decoction of althaa, or chamomile: and similar to these.
Et oportet, ut caueatur uentosatio in balneo, aut in uestigio balnei, imo oportet, ut administretur post exitum ex balneo per horam, aut per horas duas.	And it should be prevented that wind should be taken in a bath, or in a shower-room; and moreover it should be administered after leaving the bath for an hour, or for two hours.
Et non oportet, ut dormiat aliquis post uentosationem.	And it is not fit that anyone should sleep after wind.
¶ Quid est quo oportet ut regatur Ventosandus, aut Phlebotomatus ante uentosationem.	What is that which is to be observed that Ventration and Phlebotomy may be made before wind?
ET post eam oportet, ut consideres in primis: tunc si Ventosatus, aut Phlebotomatus sit cholericus, et uincunt super sanguinem eius acuitas et inflammatio: tunc oportet, ut accipiat infrigidantia, sicut granatum muzum: et etiam endiuiam cum aceto et lactuca, et secaniabin, et iuleb: et eis similia.	And after that, you should observe in the first place: then if Ventration or Phlebotomy are on the choler, and their sharpness and inflammation are directed to his blood: then it should take something cooling, such as granatum mus; also lettuce with vinegar and radish, and marjoram: and similar things.
Et pone cibaria eius pullos, et carnes ouium sekebiget, et cibos conditos cum agresta: et eis similia.	And put his food-vessels near him, and meat which he relished, and cooked foods with herbs: and things similar to these.
Et cuius complexio est frigida, oportet ut sumat in potu syrupum de melle, aut de almiua, aut alsecaniabin de seminibus factum: et sumat uinum odoriferum medium, quod est inter uetus et nouum: et praecipiatur, ut utatur paucitate cibi.	And if his complexions are cold, he should take in drink syrup of honey, or of almond-milk, or alsican made from seeds: and drink a wine with a strong odor, which is between new and old: and let him be commanded to eat little food.
Et pone cibum eius pullos, et canebir: et passeres, id est, paruas aues: et pullos columborum issiadebet.	And put his food-vessels near him, and meats of birds: and let him eat doves, that is, young pigeons: and let him eat cooked pigeons.
Et oportet, ut potus die uentosationis et phlebotomiae plus sit quam cibus: et oportet, ut detur in potu in quibusdam hominibus in horis tyriaca alfaroch, aut medicamen de musco, id est, muscata, aut alesselithe ante uentosationem: et ante phlebotomiam, aut post: ut confortentur membra principalia, et subtilietur sanguis.	And it is necessary that the drink of his diurnal rest and bloodletting be more than the food: and it is necessary that a remedy be given in drink to some men at certain hours with turpentine-alcohol, or medicine made from musk, that is, muscat, or alselith before bloodletting: and after bloodletting, or before: so that the principal members may be strengthened, and the blood subtilized.
Et non oportet, ut sumant eam in potu calefacto.	And it is not necessary that they drink it in a warm drink.
¶ De Ventosis sine scarificatione.	On Bloodletting without Scarring.
Uentosae autem quae sunt sine scarificatione, sunt Ventosae quae ponuntur super epar, et splenem, et podagram, et super uentrem, umbilicum, et loca renum, et pixidem anchae: quoniam ista membra non sufferunt scarificationem super se.	And the Bloodlettings which are without Scarring, are those laid on the liver, and the spleen, and the stomach, and over the belly, and places of the testicles, and the pixis of the anus: for these members do not suffer from scarring on their own.
Et non quaeritur per eas, nisi aut attactio ex membro sanguinis ad membrum: sicut ponimus Ventosam super mammillas in aegritudine fluxus sanguinis narium.	And is not sought through them, unless by an attack from a member of blood to a member: such as we lay a Bloodletting on the breasts in the sickness of a flux of blood to the nose.
Et utimur eis, ut soluamus a membro uentositatem frigidam inuiscatam in membro: sicut ponimus uentosam super uentrem, et umbilicum.	And we use them, that we may cure a member's Cold Bloodletting which has been irritated: such as we lay a Bloodletting on the belly, and the umbilical region.
Ipsa enim rarificat membrum, et calefacit ipsum, et remouet dolorem propterea, quia resoluit illam uentositatem.	For it rarefies the member, and warms it, and takes away pain because it resolves the Bloodletting.
Etiam ponitur super renes, quando accidit in eis opilatio, aut lapis.	Also is laid on the kidneys, when there happens to be a deposit of bile, or a stone.
Uirtute enim attractionis suae fortasse aperit opilationem, aut eradicat lapidem ex loco suo.	For with its strength it either opens the wound or removes the stone from its place.
Et similiter facit quando ponitur super epar, et splenem apud uentositatem terendam in eis utrisque.	And likewise when laid upon to heal, and the spleen to be handled within them both.
Et istae Ventosae administrantur uacuae cum sectione tantum.	And these Wind-afflicted are to be dealt with by a sharp cut only.
Et quandoque administrantur cum igne.	And when they are treated with fire.
Et quandoque administrantur plenae aqua tepida in aegritudinibus pleuresis: et illud est, ut impleatur Ventosa, et sit magna, aqua calida sola, aut aqua in qua decoctae sint herbae quae conueniunt.	And when they are treated with warm water in pleural diseases: and that is, so that the Wind be filled, and be great, only warm water, or water in which have been boiled herbs fitting for the purpose.
¶ Forma Ventosae administratae cum igne.	The form of the Wind-afflicted when treated with fire.
Sit amplitudo orificii eius duorum digitorum apertorum, secundum quod formauimus: et quantitas eius in profundo sit medietas palmi: et sit in latere eius in loco qui est circiter medium eius, foramen paruum, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum acus: fiat ex aere simul, aut citrino, grossorum marginum, lenium, aequalium, tersorum: ut non laedat membrum apud positionem suam super ipsum: et sit in medio eius uirga transuersa ex aere, aut ferro, ubi ponitur candela cum igne.	Let the width of his opening be two fingers wide, according to which form we make it: and let the quantity of it in the depth be half a palm: and let it be in the side of it in the place which is about the middle of it, a small hole, according to the quantity which is put into it: let it be made of brass also, or yellow, gross of margin, soft, equal, tertius: so that it may not hurt the limb at its position over it: and let there be in the midst of it a crossbar of brass or iron, whereon a candle is placed with fire.
Et iam fit haec uentosa magna, maior ea quam narrauimus, et parum minor illa, secundum aegritudines et aetatem eius qui utitur.	And this Wind-afflicted may be made great, greater than we have described, and less by little, according to the diseases and age of him who uses it.
Ventosae enim puerorum, et extenuatorum sunt aliae, quam uentosae uirorum, et grossorum corporum.	For the Wind-afflicted are different for boys, and for those who are declining in years, and for large persons' bodies.
Qualitas autem ponendi hanc uentosam cum igne super membrum, est, ut accendas licinium cum igne ex lino decenter, aut candelam paruam ex caera: et pone eam super medium uirgae transuersae quae est in medio uentosae: ut sit accensus ignis circiter inferiorem partem uentosae, ut non comburatur corpus infirmi.	The quality of laying this Wind upon with fire, is, that you kindle a lamp with fire from a flannel erringly, or a small candle made of wax: and put it on the crossbar in the midst of the Wind: so that the heat of the fire may be round about the lower part of the Wind, so as not to burn the body with its heat.
Deinde ponatur super membrum: et digitus sit super foramen quod dixi, donec quando tenemus uentosam: dum indigemus, auferamus digitum, et egredietur uapor super illud foramen, et soluetur uentosa statim.	Then put it on the member: and let the finger be placed over the hole which I said, until we have held the Wind in position: while we hold it, take away the finger, and there will escape into the hole a vapour, and the Wind will be set free at once.
Deinde igni licinium secundum modum suum, et itera eam, si indiges illa.	Then light the fire of tin according to its fashion, and keep doing so if you wish.
In Ventosa autem quae administratur in aegritudine pleuresis cum aqua, non est uirga transuersa, neque foramen: et non administratur, nisi quia impletur aqua, et ponitur super membrum tantum.	But in a place where ventosa is used in the treatment of pleurisy with water, there is no transverse pipe or opening, and it is not used unless water is added to it and placed on the limb only.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et haec Ventosa quanto plus est magna, ut capiat aquam multam, est melior.	And this Ventosa is the better one because it can hold a lot of water.
¶ De suspensione Sanguisugarum.	[On the suspension of sanguine sugar].
Caput XCIX.	Chapter 99.
Sanguisugae non administrantur in pluribus, nisi in quibus membris non est possibilis positio uentosarum, propter paruitatem eorum, sicut labium, et gingiua, et eis similia.	Sanguine sugar should not be used in many cases, unless the limb is unable to hold a ventose because of its smallness, such as the lip, or the gum, or things like that.
Aut in membro denudato a carne, sicut digitus, et nasus, et eis similia.	Or on a naked member devoid of flesh, such as a finger, or a nose, or things like that.
Et qualitas utendi eis est: ut ueneris ex Sanguisugis quae sunt in aquis dulcibus, mundis a putredinibus.	And the quality of their use is this: when you take them from sweet water where they are found, clean them from putrefaction.
Deinde dimittantur die et nocte in aqua dulci, donec famelicae sint, et non remaneat in uentre earum aliquid.	Then let them be left overnight and the next day in sweet water until they are hungry, and there should not remain in their stomachs any of the drug.
Deinde euacuetur corpus in primis cum phlebotomia, et cum uentosis.	Then the body should be evacuated first with phlebotomy, and then with ventose.
Deinde absterge membrum infirmi, donec rubeat.	Then wash the limb with a nurse's hand until it turns red.
Postea ponantur super ipsum.	Then place them on top of the limb.
Cum ergo implentur, et cadunt, et est possibilis suctio loci cum uentosa, tunc est magis ultimum in iuuamento: et si non, tunc ablue locum cum aceto.	When they are then filled and fall, and it is possible to suck the place with ventose, then it is better to use this method: if not, then wash the place with vinegar.
Deinde cum aqua multa, et fricetur, et exprimatur.	Then with much water, and a rub, and squeeze out.
Quod si prolongatur cursus sanguinis post casum Sanguisugarum, et est illud resudando: tunc infunde pannum lini in aqua frigida, et pone ipsum desuper, donec abscindatur resudatio.	If the flow of blood is prolonged after the use of sanguine sugar and it remains sticky: then put a linen cloth in cold water, and place the limb upside down until the stickiness disappears.
Quod si multiplicatur sanguis, tunc pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, aut gallas, et similia eis ex stipticis: donec abscindatur sanguis.	If blood increases, then sprinkle the body with ground zegen, or gall, and things like that: until the blood stops flowing.
Aut ponantur super locum medietates fabarum excorticatarum: et dimittantur, donec adhaereant fabae in loco, nam sanguis abscinditur.	The middle parts of the vessels that have been cut should be placed on the site; and they should be left until the roots of the vessels have become attached to the site, since blood has been cut off.
Et oportet si necessaria est iteratio Sanguisugarum, quando est possibile, mutare eas.	And it is necessary that, if it is necessary, the blood sugar should be changed when it is possible, because it is not good to stay in one place.
Si autem prohibentur Sanguisugae a suspensione, tunc abstergatur locus cum sanguine recenti.	But if the blood sugars are prohibited from suspension, then the site should be cleaned with recent blood.
Aut fige acum in locis, donec egrediatur aliquid ex sanguine.	Or they should be placed in the places for a while until some of the blood has come out.
Deinde ponantur, nam ipsae quando sentiunt aliquid ex sanguine, adhaerent statim.	Then they should be placed, because when they feel that they have some blood, they immediately become attached.
Quando ergo uis ut cadant, pulueriza super eas aliquid ex aloe trito, aut salem, aut cinerem: et cadent statim.	When you want them to fall off, sprinkle on them some crushed aloe, or salt, or ash: and they will fall off immediately.
¶ Partis Secundae Finis.	The Second Part Is Finished.
¶ Liber Chirurgici Albucasis Pars III.	The Livre of Surgery of Al-Zahrawi Part III.
¶ Sermo uniuersalis de restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus.	The Universal Speech on Restoration and Dislocation, and Treatment of Twist and the Like.
Caput I.	Chapter I.
Hoc Capitulum etiam multotiens est necessarium in arte Medicinae, et est restauratio fracturae, et dislocationis accidentium in ossibus.	This chapter is also very often necessary in the art of Medicine, and it is the restoration of fractures, and the dislocation of accidents in bones.
Scitote o Filii, quia iactant se de hoc Capitulo stolidi medicorum et uulgi, et qui non inspexerunt unquam antiquorum librum, neque legerunt ex eo literam.	Know ye, O sons, that many of the doctors do jest hereof, and are stubborne men; they have not examined the old book, nor read a word thereof.
Et propter hanc caussam fit, quod iste modus ex scientiis in terra nostra est priuatus.	And because of this cause it is, that this mode out of the sciences in our country is reserved.
Et ego non obuiaui in eo unquam bono omnino, et non adeptus sum ex eo illud, quod sum adeptus nisi propter longitudinem lectionis librorum antiquorum, et studium super intellectum eorum, donec extraxi scientiam illius ex eis.	And I was not satisfied therein at all, and I was not made competent thereto unless for the length of reading of the ancient books, and study upon their understanding, until I drew out the science of it from them.
Deinde adhaesi experimento et studio longitudine uitae meae.	Then by experimentation and study of a long life.
Et iam descripsi uobis ex illo in hoc Capitulo totum quod continet scientia mea: et super quod praeteriit experimentum meum, postquam abbreuiaui illud uobis, et liberaui illud ex occupatione elongationis, et abbreuiaui illud fine abbreuiationis, et ostendi illud fine declinationis: et formaui in eo formas multas ex formis instrumentorum quae administrantur in eo, cum sit ex additione declinationis, sicut feci in duobus Capitulis praecedentibus.	And I have already described to you out of that in this chapter all the science which contains my art: and concerning what is past by experiment, after I have shortened it for you, and have freed it from elongation, and shortened it at the end of abruption, and have shown it at the end of declination: and I have formed in it many shapes of instruments which are administered in it, with the addition of declination, as I did in the two preceding Chapters.
¶ Summae, et collectiones ex esse fracturae ossium, ex eis quarum praemissio necessaria est, antequam incipiamus rememorationem membrorum fractorum, et diuersorum, si uniuscuiusque.	The greatest thing is the breaking of bones out of their place, for out of these it is necessary to begin the recollections concerning broken members, and diverse, if each one.
Caput II.	Chapter II.
Oportet, ut dicamus in prologo huius Capituli, summas sermonis, et capitula, ad quarum intellectum cogitur in primis artifex ad stationem super earum ueritatem: scilicet ut uos, et qui sunt prompti, sciant, uel addiscant hanc artem nobilem, et alii a uobis.	In the prolog to this chapter, we shall state at the outset what is to be considered first in this discussion of the stationing of the members: namely, that you may know and learn this noble art well, or at least gain some knowledge of it, so that those who are zealous for it may learn from you.
Dico, ergo, quod quando accidit alicui fractura, aut dislocatio, aut torsio, aut casus: tunc oportet, ut properes in primis ad phlebotomandum eum, et soluendum ipsum, aut utraque simul: si non prohibeat aliquid, sicut debilitas uirtutis: aut est ille cui accidit aliquid ex illis puer, aut senex decrepitus: aut est tempus uehementis caloris, aut uehementis frigoris ualde.	I say, therefore, that when it happens to anyone that there is a fracture, or dislocation, or twisting, or a fall: then you should be the first to prepare for phlebotomy on him and to resolve it, or both at the same time: if nothing forbids it, as might happen with the loss of strength of virtue: or is he that has happened to something from those boys, or an old decrepit man: or is the time of a high fever, or a cold fever very sharply.
Deinde sit contentus in cibo suo, oleribus frigidis, et carnibus auium, et haedorum: et prohibe uinum, et carnes grossas, et repleri ex cibis et omni cibo qui replet uenas sanguine.	Then be satisfied with your food, with cold spices and poultry, and with hairiness of the head: and prohibit wine, and fatty meats, and eating too much from dishes, and all food that fills the veins with blood.
Donec quando securus sis ex apostemate calido, et non times effusionem materiei ad membrum: tunc redeat infirmus ad regimen suum primum cum quo cucurrit consuetudo eius.	Until you are secure from a high fever, and do not delay the flowing of the matter to the member: then return the sick one first to his usual customs with which he is accustomed.
Cum ergo incipit os fractum restaurari, tunc oportet, ut cibetur infirmus cibis nutrientibus nutrimento multo, grosso, graui, in quibus sit uiscositas: sicut cibaria facta ex tritico cocto cum aqua, et rizum, et capita, et pedes, et uentres uaccarum, et oua, et pisces recentes: et uinum grossum, et similia illis.	When, therefore, the mouth begins to be healed, then you should feed the sick with very nourishing food, dry, and grainy, in which there is a drink: such as is made from wheat flour mixed with water, and rice, and bread, and feet, and entrails of animals, and eggs, and fresh fish: and strong wine, and similar things.
Cum hoc enim regimine fit coagulatio fracturae uelocius, et melius.	For in this regimen the clotting of the fracture is sooner made, and better.
Et scias, quod ossa fracta, quando sunt in uiris qui sunt in prima senectute, et decrepitis, non est possibile, ut continuentur et consolidentur secundum naturam suam semper, propter exiccationem membrorum eorum: et consolidantur et continuantur quae ex eis sunt in fine lenitatis, sicut ossa puerornm paruorum.	And know that the bones that are broken, when they are in the years of old age and decrepitude, cannot continue always, because of the drying up of their members: and they are strengthened and continued in the end of leniency, such as are the bones of young boys.
Verumtamen natura annectit super os fractum ex omni parte aliquid simile glutino, in quo est grossitudo, quo adhaeret et stringit ipsum, donec conglutinantur adinuicem, et ligantur adinuicem, donec uenit in fine fortitudinis et firmitudinis, sicut fuit in primis, donec non prohibet ipsum aliquid ab operationibus suis: et propter hanc caussam est necesse, ut ponas nutrimentum infirmi cibaria, in quibus sunt grauitas, et uiscositas, et grossitudo, sicut diximus.	Indeed, nature attaches something similar to a broken bone from all parts, which is sticky, which adheres and tightens it until it is glued together on both sides, until it comes to the end of strength and firmness, as it was in the beginning, until it no longer allows itself to be affected by its operations: and for this reason it is necessary that you place food in the sick dishes, in which there are weight, and wetness, and stickiness, as we have said.
Et scias, quod fracturae species sunt diuersae, secundum diuersitatem membrorum: quoniam fractura cruris, est diuersa a fractura ossis capitis: et fractura ossis pectoris, est diuersa a fractura ossis dorsi: et similiter reliqua membra omnia diuersa existunt adinuicem: et ego ueni cum rememoratione omnis speciei fracturae expositae in Capitulo suo distinctae ab alia.	And you should know that the types of fractures are various, depending on the diversity of the limbs: for a fracture of the leg is different from a fracture of the skull bone: and a fracture of the chest bone is different from a fracture of the back bone: and likewise each and every limb is different in one way or another: and I came with a reminder of all kinds of fractures presented in its own chapter, distinct from the other.
Et diuersificantur species fracturae ossis etiam in seipsa.	And the species of bone fracture also differ from each other.
Quoniam fit fractura eius arcuata, praeter quod accidant in ea astellae.	Since it is made by a curved fracture, except that which happens in it of the stars.
Et quandoque fit fractura eius secundum longitudinem ossis: et sunt fracturae eius satagiae, id est, astellae, et additiones procedentes, sicut sunt in calamo, cum aptatur cultello ad scribendum.	And when a fracture is made according to the length of the bone: and there are fractures of his legs, that is, stars, and additions coming from, such as are in the reed, when it is caught with a knife to write.
Et non procedentes: et est fractura cum uulnere et disruptione in capite: et est fractura fissura parua.	And not coming from: and there is a fracture with a wound and rupture in the head: and there is a fracture, a small crack.
Et omni speciei est ingenium, uel instrumentum proprium in restauratione eius, secundum quod ueniet rememoratio eius, distincta in locis suis.	And every kind has its own tool, or its own proper instrument in restoring it, according to which comes the reminder of it, presented in its own places.
Et ex eo quo cognoscitur fractura ossis, est tortuositas eius, et ipsius eminentia: et apparitio eius sensui, et sonitus eius quando comprimis ipsum manu tua.	And from this it is known that the bone fracture is, its curve and eminence: and its appearance to the sense, and its sound when you press it with your hand.
Quando ergo non est in loco tortuositas apparens, neque sonitus apud tactum tuum cum tangis os cum agitatione, neque inuenit infirmus magnum dolorem: tunc non est illic fractura, imo possibile est, ut sit tortuositas, aut fissura parua: non ergo oportet, ut moueas ipsum cum manu et compressione omnino, imo pone super ipsum ex medicinis, quarum uenit rememoratio, post momentum illud quod conuenit loco: deinde stringatur strictura subtili.	When it is not in place, the curve appears visible, and its eminence: and its appearance to the sense, and its sound when you press it with your hand. So then is there no fracture there, but it is possible that there is a curve or a small crack: so you do not need to move it at all with your hand and compression, but rather place something on top of it from the medicines, of which the reminder comes, after a moment that it fits in place: then tighten it tightly with a slender band.
Et scias, quod locus quando arcuatur, et scinditur in duo, praeter quod accidant in eo satagiae, uerumtamen remouetur omnis pars a compari sua: tunc oportet tibi, ut incipias ab hora tua ad rectificationem eius, aequando ipsum antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And you should know that when the part is arched and divided into two, apart from what happens there in terms of satagiae, all parts are moved away from their comparison: then it is necessary for you to start from your hour to rectify it, making it even before it happens apostema hot.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum, tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec quiescat apoestema.	If, however, it happens to him that apostema is hot, then leave him for a few days until the apostema is calm.
Deinde aequa ipsum secundum quemcunque modum potest ex lenitate et ingenio.	Then make it even in any way you can from slowness and ingenuity.
Et scias, quod restauratio eius, et ipsius aequatio, est facilior quam ossis, in quo accidunt satagiae.	And you should know that the restoration of him and his equating is easier than the bones, where satagiae happen.
Deinde stringe ipsum, secundum quod ueniet tibi rememoratio eius.	Then tighten it, according to what will come to your mind about him.
Si uero in osse sunt satagiae, tunc necessaria est extensio huius membri fracti ex duabus partibus, si manus sit, aut pes: aut cum manu tua, si membrum est paruum: aut cum duobus funibus, aut cum fune et manu.	If, however, the satagiae are in the bone, then it is necessary to extend this broken member of two parts, if the hand is there, or the foot: or with your hand if the member is small: or with two ropes, or with a rope and a hand.
Et sit positio tua qua ponis membrum super locum aequalem, secundum figuram suam naturalem, donec quando extenduntur partes membri fracti: tunc conare, ut redire facias illas additiones omni ingenio, et secundum quemcunque modum potes in locis suis: et caue secundum fortitudinem tuam, ne accidat super infirmum per operationem tuam dolor, neque laesio: et conare secundum fortitudinem tuam, ut applices unum duorum ossium cum socio suo, secundum meliores formas.	And your position should be that you place the member on an equal place, according to its natural figure, until all parts of the broken member are extended: then try, with all your ingenuity, to bring it back into shape in any way you can in its places: and carefully, according to your strength, so that no pain happens on the weak one through your operation, nor over-exertion: and be careful, according to your strength, that you apply one of the two bones to his partner, according to the better forms.
Et oportet in illa hora, ut tentes et tangas ipsum manu tua.	And it is necessary in that hour that you try and touch him with your hand.
Si ergo uides illic aliquid diuersum, rectifica ipsum, et aequa illud per quantitatem tuae uirtutis.	If, however, you see something different there, then make it even, and make it equal by the amount of your strength.
Et caue extensionem uehementem, et compressionem fortem, sicut faciunt multi stolidorum.	And be careful about not extending too quickly, and do not compress too strongly, as many do with the stoics.
Multotiens enim faciunt accidere per operationem illam suam apostema calidum, aut contractionem in membro: sicut iam uidimus illud ex operationibus eorum multotiens.	For many times they cause to happen through their operation its hot apostema, or contraction in a member: as we have already seen that from their operations.
Deinde annecte post aequationem, et decentem operationem, et stricturam illius membri, et quietem, et tranquillitatem: et mone infirmum super ipsum.	Then after resting, and letting the wound heal, and tightening his member, and quietness, and tranquillity; and remind the sick man about himself.
Et fac ipsum cauere, ne moueat ipsum in hora suarum uigiliarum, et somni sui apud reuolutionem suam, et agitationem suam, et apud egestionem suam, et omnes motus suos ultima uirtute sua.	And let the man be careful, so that he does not moan in his hour of need, and his sleep is disturbed during his operation, and his agitation during his digestion, and all his movements at the end of his strength.
Et ut caueat, ne sit positio membri positio cum qua sequatur dolor.	And so that he may be careful, that the position of the member does not remain in one place with which pain is caused.
Quod est, quia quando sentit in dispositione positionis membri dolorem, aut laesionem: tunc oportet, ut permutes ipsum ad dispositionem aliam ab illa cum qua non sentiat dolorem.	That is, for when he feels pain in the position of the member's disposition, or injury: then one should turn him over to a position from that with which he does not feel pain.
Et caue cum illo, ut sit positio eius illa aequalis, recta: ut non accidat in membro tortuositas, quando restauratur.	And be careful with him, so that his position is equal and straight: so that twistedness does not occur in the member when he is healed.
Et qualitas stricturae membri fracti est, secundum quod narro.	And the quality of a tight member that has been broken is according to the width.
Scias, quod membra fracta diuersificantur in paruitate sua, et eorum magnitudine, et ipsorum forma.	You should know that broken members differ in their length and form, and their size.
Quae ergo ex eis sunt parua, sicut brachium, et digitus, et focile, et similia eis, tunc oportet, ut sit inuolutio panni mollis, subtilis.	What are shorter ones, such as the arm, finger, or paw, then one should make the wrapping soft and thin.
Quae autem ex eis sunt grossa, sicut coxa, et crus, oportet ut sit in eis inuolutio lata, dura.	What are the bulkier ones, such as the hip or leg, then one should make the wrapping thick and hard.
Quoniam ligamentum latum, connectit membrum magnum, et stringit ipsum ab omni parte strictura aequali, ita quod non ingreditur ipsum macula.	For a broad ligament joins a large member and ties it together with an equal tightness so that it does not enter the member in any spot.
Deinde incipe post euacuationem tuam ab aequatione ponere linimentum conueniens ad illud, in stuppa leni super locum fracturae ipsius.	Then after you have evacuated your discharge from the equating place put a suitable liniment on it, with a soft cloth over the break site.
Deinde incipe inuoluere ligamentum super locum fracturae ipsius tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod meretur membrum: et stringe manum tuam parumper cum ligamento.	Then start to wrap the ligament over the break site three or four times, as the member deserves it; and grip your hand lightly with the ligament.
Deinde uade cum eo ad partem superiorem a loco fracturae, et stringe minus quam fuit strictura tua, qua strinxisti locum fractum.	Then walk with him to the upper side from the break spot, and tighten it less than your tightness that you tightened the broken place.
Deinde elonga te cum inuolutione a loco fracturae parumper, et mollifica stricturam paulatim, donec capias ex loco sano rem magnam.	Then, as you extend it with an involution from the site of the fracture, and soften the rigor gradually, until you have taken away from the place a large part of the sick member.
Deinde accipe uittam aliam, et inuolue eam iterum super locum fractum inuolutionibus.	Then take another one, and extend it again over the site of the fracture with involutions.
Postea uade cum inuolutione ad partem inferiorem a fractura.	Then carry it with an involution to the lower part from the fracture.
Et sit operatio tua in strictura inuolutionis, et mollificatione eius, secundum quod diximus in inuolutione prima superiore.	And let your operation continue on the rigor of the involution and its softening, according to what we have said in the first superior involution.
Deinde pone inter inuolutiones ex stuppa leni, aut panno, cum quo aequetur tortuositas fracturae, si est in ea tortuositas: et si non, non ponas in ea aliquid.	Then place between the involutions of the cloth or fabric with which you even out the rigor, if there is any curvature of the fracture: and if not, do not place anything in it.
Deinde inuolue super ipsam uittam aliam.	Then extend again on the other taken one.
Postea aequa super has inuolutiones astellas decenter factas statim, si non est in loco inflatio, neque apostema calidum.	Then immediately set equal to these involutions of stars made out of place, if there is no swelling or fever in the place.
Si autem in ea est inflatio, aut apostema: tunc pone super eam quod sedet illud apostema, et auferat inflationem: et dimitte eam aliquot diebus.	But if there is an inflammation or a swelling: then place over it what sits that swelling and takes away the inflammation: and let it go for a few days.
Deinde stringe super ipsam tunc astellas.	Then tighten again on the same stars when the swelling has gone.
Et sint Astellae ex medietatibus cannae latae, rasae, formatae sapienter: aut sint ex ligno unde fiunt cribra, quae fiunt ex pino, aut geraid, id est, ramis palmae, aut calingi: et sit amplitudo omnis Astellae, secundum hanc formam, et hanc eandem figuram.	And let the stars be made from the middle of the broad boards, rasped, and formed wisely: or from wood from which are made cribs, that is to say, branches of a palm tree, or a gorse, that is, branches of a holly: and let the width of each star be according to this form, and this figure.
Verumtamen oportet, ut Astella quae ponitur super ipsam tracturam, sit grossior et latior parumper, quam reliquae Astellae: et longitudo Astellae sit secundum quod licet membro ex magnitudine et paruitate.	But it is necessary that the star placed on the wound should be thicker and wider about than the other stars: and that the length of the star should be according to what is suitable for the member from size and proportion.
Deinde stringe super Astellas cum uitta alia, secundum stricturam primam eandem.	Then tighten again on the stars with another one, according to the same rigor.
Deinde liga desuper cum filis decenter, secundum quod diximus de strictura: et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae plus: et quanto plus elongatur a fractura sit, strictura minor.	Then bind from above with the fils made out of place, according to what we have said about the rigor: and it is, that your rigor should be on the site of the fracture more: and the greater it is extended from the fracture, the smaller is the rigor.
Et oportet, ut sint fila media in grossitudine et subtilitate, et sint ex lino molli.	It is necessary that they are fine threads in thickness and fineness, and they are from soft linen.
Quoniam si fila sunt grossa, sicut uidi ex operatione stolidorum ponentium fila sua ex chordis lini tortis, est error magnus: quoniam cadit strictura cum eis extra qualitatem.	For if the threads are thick, as is the case with the sutures that surgeons place their threads from twisted linen cords, there is a great mistake, for constriction falls outside the quality.
Et fila subtilia iterum non conueniunt: quoniam tu non consequeris per stricturam cum eis illud quod uis.	And fine threads also do not agree: for you do not achieve that which you wish with constriction, if they are there.
Et non oportet, ut sit inter astellam et astellam minus quam digitus.	And it is not necessary that it be between a thumb and a finger.
Quod si laeditur infirmus per extremitates astellarum post stricturam in locis sanis: tunc pone sub eis ex stuppa leni, aut lana carminata, donec nihil laedatur ex illo.	That if a sick person is injured through the ends of the sutures in healthy places: then place under them from soft stuff, or red wool, until there is no injury from it.
Quando autem est fractura cum uulnere, et accidit disruptio in cute, ego ueniam cum rememoratione eius in capitulo secundum singularitatem.	But when there is a fracture with an ulnar bone, and there is a rupture in the skin, I remember it in the second chapter with singularity.
Et scias, quod non omne membrum fractum oportet ut stringatur cum astellis a primo die.	And you should know that not every broken limb needs to be stitched from the first day.
Quod est, quia membrum quando est magnum, non oportet ut ponas superipsum astellas, nisi post quinque dies, aut septem, aut plus, secundum securitatem tuam ab euentu apostematis calidi.	That is, because the limb is large when it is broken, it is not necessary to place the top sutures, unless after five days, or seven, or more, according to your security from infection.
Et iste est modus emplastrorum, quibus restaurabant antiqui, quae ponuntur super fracturam et dislocationem.	And this is the way that ancient people used to patch, which are placed on a fracture and dislocation.
¶ Modus Emplastri communis abbreuiati, restaurans fracturam, conueniens pluribus complexionibus, praecipue mulieribus, et pueris: quoniam est ex eo super quod non uincit calor, neque frigus.	The common shortened way of the patch, restoring a fracture, suitable for many compartments, especially for women and children, because it is from this that heat does not affect, nor cold.
Et est, ut accipias ex puluere molendini, et est medulla farinae quae pendet in parietibus molendini apud motum molae: et conficias ipsum sicut est, praeter quod cribelles ipsum cum albugine oui: et pone confectionem eius non spissam, neque subtilem.	And it is so that you take from the flour which is ground, and it is a meal hanging on the walls of the mill when moved by the wheel: and shape it as it is, except that you add white wax to it, and do not make it dense or thin.
Deinde utere eo.	Then use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, restaurantis fracturam, et dislocationem, et torsionem.	The other way of the patch, which restores a fracture and a dislocation, and twists.
Recipe almess, et laudani, et acaciae, et enulae, et mugath: et suc, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V et alethil ʒ XX terantur omnia, et cribellentur, et misceantur cum aqua alethil: aut cum albugine oui, si complexio infirmi est calefacta.	Brew meslin, and laurels, and acacia, and poultices, and myrrh: and suck all of them the juice of one pound of myrrh, and five of aloes, and twenty of alethic resin, let everything be well shaken, and let it be mixed with water of alethic resin: or with alumine, if the complexity is hot.
Deinde utere hoc emplastro.	Then use this plaster.
Nam ipsum est bonae compositionis, restaurat ossa fracta uelociter, et confert pluribus hominibus.	For this reason, good composition is, when broken bones are mended quickly and gives strength to many people.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, quod etiam confert fracturae et torsioni.	The method of applying the plaster is as follows, which also helps in the healing of fractures and dislocations.
Recipe mugath, et mess, et alteae albae, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V acaciae ʒ VI boli armeni ʒ XX terantur omnia contritione multa, et cribellentur, et conficiantur cum aqua, aut albugine oui: et administrentur.	Brew myrrh, and meslin, and alethic resin, all of them the juice of ten pounds of myrrh, five of aloes, six of acacia, and twenty of Armenian bole, let everything be well shaken, and let it be made with water or alumine, and let it be administered.
¶ Modus Emplastri ad iuncturas, et ossa separata ex locis suis: et sedat dolorem accidentem eis, et scissuram ossis, et fracturam.	The method of applying the plaster to injuries and separated bones from their sites, and to calm pain in an injury, to heal broken joints, and to mend a broken bone.
Sumatur lana succida, et submergatur in aceto, et oleo decocto: et ponatur super locum.	A soaked wool is placed, and immersed in vinegar and oil, and is placed on the spot.
Et in hoc quidem Emplastro non est uirtus restaurationis, sed est bonum in sedatione apostematis calidi: et expellit dolores proprie.	In this plaster, there is no power of restoration, but it is good for calming a hot swelling: and it drives away pains on its own.
¶ Modus Emplastri, quod restaurat os fractum.	The method of applying the plaster, which restores a broken bone.
Sume folia fici surdi, et folia papaueris syluestris: et tere omnia, et fac emplastrum ex utrisque.	Soak leaves from an oak tree and leaves from a wild papaw; shake them all up, and make the plaster out of both.
¶ Modus Emplastri abbreuiati, administrati apud restaurationem fracturae ossis: et quando tu uis resolutionem residui apostematis.	The method of applying the shortened plaster, administered to restore a broken bone: and when you wish to resolve a swelling that is present.
Recipe radicis alteae, et camomillae, et florum uiolarum, et farinae herbi, omnium ana partem unam: terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum uino, si non est membrum calefactum.	Brew the root of alethium, and chamomile, and flowers of wormwood, and herb-grain, all of them one part; let everything be well shaken, and let it be made with wine, if it is not a hot member.
Si uero est calefactum, tunc confice illud cum aqua coriandri humidi, aut cum aqua, et utere eo.	If it is indeed heated, then then apply wet with coriander seed water, or water, and use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius fortioris in resolutione, quam istud primum, quando accidit apostema durum apud restaurationem membri.	A stronger method of application in the case of a hard dry sore when the member is to be restored, namely:
Recipe radicis alteae, et seminis lini, et balaustiae, et melliloti, et samsuci, et floris uiolarum, et camomillae, omnium ana, partem unam, terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum aqua salicis, aut cum aqua dulci, aut cum uino.	Take the root of aloes, and linseed, and bilberry, and mallow, and samsuc, and flower of caraway, all in equal parts; these are to be well pressed together, and applied with oak-bark water, or sweet water, or wine.
Totum illud secundum caliditatem membri, et quietem caloris eius.	All this is to be used according to the heat of the member, and the quieting of its heat.
Hippocrates uero non dixit in libro suo, quod ponatur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius, nisi caerotum factum ex caera, et oleo: non aliud: et narrauit, ut sit medium inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem.	Hippocrates indeed in his book did not say that a broken member should be placed on a poultice made of straw and oil: nothing else; and he tells us to use it when the member is neither too hot nor too cold.
Galeno autem uisum est, ut ponantur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius res, in quibus est exiccatio caliditatis, sicut myrrha, et aloes et olibanum, et similia eis ex eis quae narrauimus.	But Galenus, however, used to apply to the broken member for its restoration certain things in which there is a drying up of heat, such as myrrh and aloes and olive wax and similar things of which we have spoken.
¶ Modus Emplastri quod confert ad laesionem et dolorem.	A method of application that is useful for wounds and pain.
Recipe mugath, et ciceris, et capillorum hominis incisorum, aut pennae auis, et alteae, et salis partes aequales: terantur, et cribellentur, et conficiantur: et fiat ex eo emplastrum.	Take mug-wort, and chickweed, and hair of man's teeth, or hen's feathers, and aloes, and salt; all in equal parts: press them together, and rub them up, and make an ointment.
Quantitas autem secundum quam oportet, ut remaneat ligatura, deinde soluatur, est, ut consideres tunc, si non accidit infirmo dolor, neque pruritus, neque mouetur os fractum a loco suo: tunc non resoluas ipsum diebus multis.	But as to the quantity, according to how much should remain of it for it not to run out, and then to dissolve, you are to consider that if there is no pain, or itching, or movement in the broken jaw from its place: do not break up the plaster over a few days.
Quod si accidat ei in loco pruritus uehemens, aut dolor inquietans, aut inflatio: tunc propera, et solue in hora ipsum, et aufer emplastrum ab eo: et accipe pannum lenem, aut spongiam marinam lenem, humidam: et submerge eam in aqua tepida, et ablue cum ea locum, donec quiescat pruritus, et sedetur dolor.	If there should be a very painful itching, or an inquieting pain, or swelling: then at once break it up, and dissolve it at the same time, and take away the plaster from it; and take a piece of linen cloth, or a sea sponge, damp with water: and immerse it in warm water, and wash the place with it, until the itching is calm, and the pain subsides.
Deinde dimitte membrum quiescere una hora.	Then release the limb to rest for an hour.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam succidam, submersam in aceto et oleo, aut oleo rosato: et liga super ipsum nocte una, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido, et quiescat inflatio membri, et remoueatur dolor eius.	Then cover the wound with wool, soaked in vinegar and oil, or oil infused with rose water; and bind it to the body for a night, until the fever has subsided, and the inflammation of the member has settled, and the pain has abated.
Deinde itera ipsum ad stricturam subtilem, et emplastrum paruum: et non stringas ipsum constrictione tua prima, et subtilia cum eo, donec sanetur.	Then massage the wound with a mild emollient; and do not bind it tightly at first, nor use tight bindings, until the wound has healed.
Quod si uides, quod apostema, et rubedo, et dolor, et inflatio, et omnia accidentia iam remota sunt penitus, et indiges emplastro et strictura, tunc itera illud sicut fecisti in primis aequaliter.	If you see that the swelling, redness, pain and inflammation have completely disappeared, and that the wound is well covered by the poultice and bound firmly, then apply the poultice again as before.
Quod si non accidit membro aliquid ex eis quae diximus, tune non soluas ipsum, nisi post tres dies, aut quatuor, aut quinque, aut septem.	If any of these things do not occur in the member, then do not remove the poultice until after three days, or four, or five, or seven.
Et quando que dimittitur uiginti diebus totum illud, secundum quod apparet tibi ex solutione membri, sicut diximus, donec quando adhaeret fractura, et approximat coagulatio carnis super eam: adde etiam tunc in strictura plus quam strictura tua prima tota: et adde etiam in ingrossatione cibi infirmi, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius.	And when the poultice has been left for twenty days all over the wound, as far as appears from the healing of the member, so that it is firmly attached to the fracture, and the blood clottings are approaching; add also then more than your first constriction; and add also then an increase in the food diet, as it were by reminiscence.
Si autem uides locum fracturae iam exiccari, et extenuari plus quam oportet: tunc scias, quod nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad ipsum.	But if you see that the place of the fracture is drying up and growing weaker more than it should: then know that food is forbidden from reaching it.
Embroca ergo ipsum cum aqua tepida apud omnem uicem qua soluis ipsum, et sit illud in omnibus tribus diebus, et alleuia stricturam parumper.	So soak it with warm water at every hour, and keep it covered for all three days, and allow a little bit of air to the wound.
Per hanc ergo operationem currit ad membrum nutrimentum, et sanatur uelociter.	By this means, therefore, the member is supplied with food, and heals quickly.
Illud autem quod faciunt stolidi restauratores ex fractura membri uice alia, quando non restauratur in primis, secundum quod oportet, et restauratur secundum tortuositatem, est error ex operatione eorum, et timor magnus: et si esset rectum, dixissent illud antiqui in libris suis, et operati fuissent cum eo.	But this, that is done by dull healers from a broken member's fracture, when not done first, as it should be, and done according to the tortuosity of the break, is an error in their work, and a great fear: and if it were right, the ancients would have written about it in their books, and would have worked it.
Et ego non uidi alicubi eorum uestigium in illo omnino, et rectius est, ut non fiat illud.	And I did not see anywhere their footprints at all, and it is better, so that it is not done.
¶ De factura accidente in capite.	§ On the making of an accident in the head.
Caput III.	Head.
Species fracturae sunt diuersae, et figurae eius multae: et caussae eius sunt distinctae.	The kinds of fractures are various, and their forms are many: and the causes of them are distinct.
Nam ex fractura est quae fit a percussione cum ense: et percussio aufert os totum usquequo peruenit ad siphac, quod est sub osse, sicut facit axia in ligno: et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Axialis.	For this type of fracture is made from impact when the weapon strikes and the impact carries on until it reaches the bone's syphacus, which is beneath the bone, as it does in wood with an axe: and for this reason this type of fracture is called axial.
Aut ensis incidit quiddam ossis, et incidit faciem eius, et non penetrat incisio usque ad ultimum eius: et nominatur haec species fracturae Kalaan, id est, Leuatio absolute.	Or a weapon cuts into some bone and cuts its face, but the cut does not penetrate to the very end of it: and this type of fracture is called a kalaan, that is, an absolute lifting.
Et est uulnus duarum fracturarum, aut magnum, aut paruum.	And there is a joint of two fractures, or large, or small.
Et ex fractura est, quae est contritio, aut attritio: et caussa eius est percussio cum lapide, aut casus super lapidem, aut eis similia.	And one type of fracture is a crushing, or wearing away: and its cause is impact with a stone, or falling on a stone, or similar things.
Et haec fractura est etiam aut penetrans, quae iam appropinquat panniculo, quod est sub osse: aut est in facie ossis: et est uulnus harum duarum fracturarum etiam aut paruum, aut magnum.	And this type of fracture is also piercing, which is beginning to approach a flap, which is beneath the bone: or is in the face of the bone: and this type of fracture is also a joint of two fractures, small or large.
Et ex fractura est, quae est occulta in osse in subtilitate capilli: et est fissura parua, et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Capillaris.	And one type of fracture is hidden in a bone in the subtlety of a hair: and it is a small crack, and because of this it is called this type of fracture Capillaris.
Et ex eis est fractura, quae fit a casu, aut percussione lapidis, et eis similium, quae faciunt ingredi laminam ossis ad interiora, et fit loco concauitas: sicut accidit caldariis aeris, quando occurrit eis percussio, et ingreditur pars eorum ad interiora.	And from these is a fracture which is made from falling or striking with a stone, and from things similar to these, which makes the bone's lamina go inside, and it is joined by concavity: as happened in the case of caldarius' wind, when it was struck by them, and some of them went inside.
Et plurimum quidem fit illud in capitibus humidorum ossium, sicut sunt capita puerorum.	And many things are made from this in the heads of moist bones, as are the heads of boys.
Et fiunt omnibus istis speciebus fracturae satagiae separatae, et ego ueniam cum rememoratione illius totius in loco suo.	And all these types of fracture are separate from each other, and I come with a reminder of all this in its place.
Et cognoscimus omnes has species fracturae per detectionem super eam, et inquisitionem earum cum tentis, et ablationem carnium corruptarum, quae sunt super eas.	We know all these kinds of fractures by examination on them and by questioning about them with tension, and by removing the corrupted flesh which is on them.
Species uero Capillaris cognoscitur per hoc, quod detegitur super os, et abstergitur, et linitur super ipsum cum encaustro: fractura enim apparet nigra.	Indeed the capillary species is recognized by this, which is discovered on the bone and abraded and kept on it with pitch: for the fracture appears black.
In curatione autem fracturae, considera in primis accidentia infirmi: tunc si uides ex accidentibus quod significet significatione manifesta super timorem, sicut uomitus cholerae, et extensio, et amissio intellectus, et abscisio uocis, et syncopis, et febris acuta, et egressus oculorum, et rubedo eorum, et similia eis ex accidentibus in pluribus dispositionibus, proculdubio non sanatur: et si uides accidentia non terrentia te, et speras salutem: tunc incipe curationem eius.	In the cure of fractures, consider first the symptoms of the disease: if you see from these that which signifies a clear meaning over fear, such as fainting with cholera and enlargement and loss of intelligence and cutting off of speech and syncope and acute fever and outgoing of the eyes and their redness and similar things from among these in various dispositions, there is no doubt that he will not be cured: and if you see non-terrifying symptoms in him, and you hope for his recovery, then begin to treat him.
Quod est, si uenit ad te uulneratus in primis cum uulneratur: et est illud in diebus hyemis, tunc oportet, ut studeas in ablatione ossis ante diem quartumdecimum secundum omnem dispositionem.	That is, if he comes to you wounded first with a wound: and this happens in the middle of winter, then one should seek, so that you study in the removal of the bone before the sixteenth day of December according to every disposition.
Et si est in diebus aestatis, tunc oportet, ut properes remouere os ante diem septimum, antequam corrumpatur quod est sub osse ex panniculo, et accidant illa accidentia quae narrauimus.	And if it is in the days of summer, then one should seek to remove the bone before the seventh day, before that which is under the bone from a flap rusts, and those accidents which we have described.
Quod si fractura ossis iam peruenit ad panniculum tangentem cerebrum, et est cum minutiis, et attractione: tunc oportet, ut incidas partem comminutam, et attritam, secundum quod narro tibi.	That is, if the fracture of the bone has already reached the skin touching the brain, and it is with a little, and attraction: then one should seek to hit the broken part, crushed and ground, according to what I tell you.
Et est, ut radas caput uulnerati: et detege super os secundum quemcunque modum possibile est tibi: et secundum figuram uulneris, et quod leue est super infirmum.	And it is, as you shave the head of the wounded man: and discover on the bone according to any possible way for you: and according to the figure of the wound, and what is whiter is over the weak.
Quod si accidat tibi apud detectionem ossis fluxus sanguinis, aut apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet.	That is, if it happens to you with the detection of the bone of a flow of blood or hot swelling: then oppose it with that which is necessary.
Et est, ut impleas locum cum pannis infusis in uino, et oleo rosato: et facias quiescere uulnus, donec sedetur apostema, et sis securus a fluxu sanguinis.	And it is, as you fill the place with cloths soaked in wine and rose oil: and make the wound rest, until the swelling subsides, and be safe from the flow of blood.
Deinde incipe in curatione ossis, et ablatione eius.	Then begin with the cure of bones and the removal thereof.
Et illud fit secundum unum duorum modorum.	And that is done according to two ways.
Modus quidem unus est, ut incidas os cum Incisorio strictae aciei: et haec est forma eius.	The mode which is one, is that you should strike the bone with an incision of a sharp chisel; and this is its form.
Dende administra Incisorium aliud post Incisorum latius eo parumper: et haec est forma eius.	Then give another chisel, wider by so much as the first; and this is its form.
Deinde administra etiam Incisorium aliud latius etiam quam secundum.	Then also give another chisel, wider than the second.
Et modus secundus est, ut sit apud te numerus Incisoriorum diuersorum: quorum quaedam sint latiora quibusdam, et quaedam eorum breuiora quibusdam: et sint in ultimo acuitatis extremitatum suarum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut fuled: et utere facilitate in percussione super Incisorium, ut non concutiat caput, et laedat ipsum.	The second mode is that you should have at your disposal a number of chisels of various widths; some of these shall be wider than others, and some narrower: and they shall be on the extremities of their edges, sharp from iron or fuel: and use convenience in striking upon the chisel, so that it does not strike the head and harm it.
Si autem os est forte, durum: tunc oportet, ut perfores in circumitu eius, antequam tu administres Incisoria, cum Terebris quae nominantur Terebra non profundantia: et non nominantur ita, nisi quoniam ipsa non pertranseunt terminum ossis carnei ad illud, quod est post ipsum: propterea, quod Terebro est extremitas rotunda super illud, quod est sub capite eius acuto, similis margini, et circulus paruus prohibet submergi, et pertransire spissitudinem ossis.	If the bone is strong and hard: then you should make a hole around it before you administer the chisel, with a twister, which they call a tweezers, that does not go to the bottom of the flesh towards the bone: because the tip is round on that part which is under the acute head, like the edge, and a little circle prevents it from sinking into the thickness of the bone.
Et conuenit tibi, ut accipias ex istis Terebris numerum multum, quorum unumquodque conueniat quantitati spissitudinis ossis, donec praesens sit tibi omni craneo Terebrum: cuius extremitatis acutae quantitas in longitudine et breuitate sit, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis illius cranei.	And it will be suitable for you to take from these tweezers a large number, the quantity of which corresponds to the thickness of the bone, until you have all the chisel tips needed: whose acute tip is in length and brevity according to the quantity of its bone thickness.
Et haec est forma trium specierum Terebrorum, uel Trepanorum.	And this is the form of the three types of tweezers, or trepans.
Qualitas autem perforandi in circumitu ossis fracti, est: ut ponas Terebrum super os, et reuoluas ipsum digitis tuis, donec scias, os iam penetratum esse.	The quality of the tip that pierces around the broken bone is: you should place the tweezers on the bone and roll it with your fingers, until you know that the bone has been pierced.
Deinde permuta Terebrum ad locum alium, et pone quod est inter omne foramen quantitatem grossitudinis radii, aut circiter illud.	Then change the tweezers to another place, and place whatever is between all the holes of its width, or around it.
Deinde incide cum Incisoriis quod est inter omne foramen ex osse: et fac illud subtilius quam potes super illud ex fine leuitatis, sicut diximus, donec eradices os, aut manu tua, aut cum aliquo alio ex quibusdam instrumentis, quae parasti ad illud: sicut tenaliae, et forpices subtiles.	Then cut with the incision what is between all openings from bone: and make it finer than you can on it from the end of levity, as we have said, until you get rid of the bone, or with your hand, or with some other instrument that you have prepared for it: such as tenals and subtile forceps.
Et oportet, ut caueas omni cautela, ne tangat Terebrum, aut Incisorium aliquid ex siphac.	And it is necessary, so that you take every precaution, so that it does not touch the temporomandibular joint, or any of the incisors from the syphons.
Cum ergo circumieris os perforando, et separatum fuerit a siphac, si fuerit continuum cum eo, et extraxeris ipsum, oportet ut radas, et aeques extremitatem eius quod remanet in osse cum instrumento alio simili Incisorio.	When you have circumcised the jaw while perforating it, and if it is separated from the syphons, if it is continuous with it, and you remove it, it should be rough, and the same end of it that remains in the bone with another similar incision instrument.
Verumtamen oportet, ut sit tenuis et subtilis magis aliis Incisoriis.	However, it should be fine and finer than other incision instruments.
Quod si remanet aliquid ex ossibus paruis, et satagiae: tunc accipe ea cum facilitate, cum eo quod est apud te ex instrumentis.	If there remains something of the bones small, and they are soft: then take them easily with you from those that are with you from the instruments.
Deinde cura uulnus post illud cum liciniis, et unguentis quae diximus.	Then care for the wound after that with liniments, and the ointment which we have said.
Et modus alius operationis est facilis, prorsus longinquus a timore: quem dixit Galenus, et laudauit ipsum laude magna: et iste est sermo eius.	And another way of doing this is simple, far from fear: which Galen said, and praised him highly: and this is his saying.
Necese est tibi in primis, ut incipias detegere partem ossis ex loco, in quo fractura est uehementior, et manifestior: donec quando detexeris illam partem, et posueris sub eo extremitatem huius Incisorii lenticularis, cuius haec est forma.	You must necessarily, first of all, so that you start to grasp the bone's part in which the fracture is more painful and more evident: until when you have grasped that part, and placed under it the end of this lenticular incision instrument, whose this is the form.
Et pars lenticularis, lenis non incidit aliquid: et pars acuta eius in duabus lateribus eius uadens in longitudinem, sicut uides: ut sit pars lenticularis innixa ad siphac, facie eius incidente acuta in osse.	And the lenticular part, soft does not incise anything: and the acute part of it on its two sides washing along in length, as you see: so that the lenticular part is placed against the syphons, its acute part facing the bone.
Deinde percute super Incisorium a parte una cum malleo paruo, donec incidas totum os cum facilitate, sicut reuoluitur: et tu sis securus ex panniculo, quod non accidat in eo accidens, quod timeas prorsus.	Then beat over the incision from one part with a small mallet, until you incise all the bone with ease, as it rotates: and you are safe from the panic that there does not happen to it an accident, which you are certainly afraid of.
Et si medicans non esset stultior hominum, et magis ignarus eius, nec esset dormiens, tunc si remaneret aliquid annexum ossi ex panniculo in quibusdam locis, incideret ipsum ab eo cum extremitate incisorii lenticularis ipsius, et liberaret ipsum ab eo cum facilitate.	If a person were not foolish, and more ignorant of it, and not sleepy, then if something was left attached to the bone from the pannicle in certain places, he would hit himself with the end of the lens incisor, and free himself easily.
Liberatur enim ab eo sine nocumento, et absque timore.	For it is freed from him without harm, and without fear.
Et si fractura ossis non penetret usque ad panniculum, et illud quod abscinditur ab osse est facies eius, et remanent in ipso asperitas et satagiae subtiles: tunc oportet, ut radas illam asperitatem, et eradices illas satagias cum rasoriis subtilibus ex quibus praeparasti numerum diuersarum quantitatum, ut sit tibi possibile administrare ex eis in omni loco conuenientiora eorum, et rectiora ipsorum, secundum illud ad quod perducit te operatio, et ipsum os fractum, et figura eius.	For if the fracture of the bone does not go through to the pannicle, and what is cut off from the bone is the face of it, and there remain in him roughness and subtle contusions: then he should make smooth this roughness and pluck out these contusions with fine razors which you have prepared different quantities, so that it becomes possible for you to administer them in any place convenient for them, and straightened out their form according to what draws you into the operation, and the broken bone, and its form.
Et oportet, ut administres in rasione tua, qua in primis radis os, latius illorum rasoriorum.	And it is necessary that you administer in your ratio, first of all the root of the bone, with a wider blade of these razors.
Deinde utere post ipsum subtiliore eo.	Then use after this the finer edge of the tool.
Et non cesses facere illud secundum continuitatem, donec peruenias ad administrandum tenuius, et subtilius eorum omnium.	And do not cease to make this according to continuity, until you come to administer them, all thinner and finer.
In unaquaque autem fissurarum reliquarum paruarum capillarium, et fractura subtili, oportet ut administres curam, secundum illud quod perducit ad rectificationem eius.	In each and every of the small cracks left behind in the skin, and in the subtle fracture, it is necessary that you administer care, according to what draws you into its rectification.
Et est res quae non occultatur super omnem, cui in hac arte est quodlibet studium, et stetit super illud quod scripsimus, et ostendimus in fracturis magnis.	And this is a thing that does not hide itself above all, which in this art is any study, and stands on what we have written and shown in large fractures.
Si autem panniculus detectus retinetur, quando tu eradicas os: tunc oportet, ut accipias pannum lini, secundum quantitatem uulneris, et submerge ipsum in oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super orificium uulneris.	But if the pannicle is caught, when you cut off the bone: then it is necessary that you take linen cloth, according to the quantity of the wound, and dip it into rose oil, and put it on the opening of the wound.
Deinde accipe pannum alium duplicatum, aut triplicatum, et submerge ipsum in uino et oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super pannum primum: et fac illud quam facilius potes super illud, ut non grauetur siphac.	Then take another cloth, doubled or trebled, and dip it into rose wine and oil, and put it on the first cloth: and make it so that you can do this more easily than the other, so that it does not stick to it.
Deinde administra supra ipsum ligamentum latum: et non stringas ipsum, nisi per quantitatem quae teneat uulnus tantum: et dimitte ipsum cum hac cura die uno, aut diebus duobus, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido.	Then apply the medicine above the wide ligament: and do not tighten it, unless only so much as the tendency of the fracture: and let go with this cure on the first or second day, until you are free from the heat of the apoplexy.
Deinde solue ipsum, et administra post illud medicinas cum quibus est superflua siccitas: sicut radices lilii, et farina herbi, et puluis thuris, et aristolochia, et similia eis: et est, ut facias ex istis medicinis puluerem, qui puluerizetur super uulnus sicut sunt siccae.	Then dissolve it and apply the medicines afterwards which are useless without moisture: such as the roots of lilies, and the flour of herbs, and the powder of thorns, and of arisolochia, and like things: and make from these medicines a powder to be applied on the fracture as you do with those which are dry.
Et uniuersaliter administra in illo omnem medicinam de proprietate cuius est ut abstergat, et non mordicet.	And universally apply in it all medicine of its kind, for it will purify and not hurt.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, ut uulnus in curatione tua sit limpidum: neque sit in ea sordes unguenti, neque sordicies.	And let it be, according to your skill, that the fracture be clear in your cure: and may it not be in it the grease of an unction, nor any dirtiness.
Neque dimittas uirus aggregari in eo omnino: quoniam quando uirus aggregatur super panniculum cerebri, corrumpit eum, et putrefacit ipsum, et accidit super infirmum post illud malicia magna: et iam accidit in siphac capitis, cum mundificatur ab eo os, praecipue quando negligitur cura eius, nigredo in superficie eius.	And do not let any pus accumulate at all in it: for when the pus gathers on the skin of the brain, it corrupts and spoils it, and causes a great evil after it: and this already happens in the scalp, if it is cleaned from it by neglect of its cure, especially by blackness on its surface.
Considera ergo tunc, si accidunt infirmo accidentia quae diximus, scias, quia est pernitiosum proculdubio.	Consider therefore then, if these accidents happen to the sick person which we have said, that it is certainly dangerous.
Et si nigredo non accidit, nisi a medicina quae ponitur super ipsum, et est in uirtute illius medicinae, ut faciat illam nigredinem: tunc oportet, ut accipias ex melle partem unam, ex oleo rosato partes tres, et linias cum eis pannum.	And if the blackness does not happen except from the medicine which is applied on it, and there is in its power that it should cause it: then you must take from honey one part, from rose oil three parts, and with them linen cloth.
Deinde pone ipsum super siphac: postea cura ipsum cum speciebus curationis quae conueniunt, donec sanetur.	Then put the fracture on the scalp: then cure it with the species of cure which are fitting, until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Nasi quando frangitur.	De restoratione nasi when it is broken.
Caput IIII.	Chapter IIII.
Scias, quod non franguntur ex Naso nisi duae partes eius superiores simul, aut una earum: propterea, quod ipse sunt duo ossa: quoniam inferius eius est cartilaginosum, non frangitur, et non accidit ei nisi attritio, et tortuositas, et simitas.	You should know that the two upper parts of the nose do not break unless at the same time: for each one is a bone: since the lower part is cartilage only, it does not break and does not happen to it except by chafing, and twist, and like things.
Si frangitur una duarum partium eius, tunc oportet, ut intromittas digitum paruum in foramen Nasi, et aeques illam fracturam digito tuo indice, et pollice deforis, donec redeat Nasus super figuram suam naturalem: et fiat illud arte, cum facilitate.	If one of the two parts is broken, then it is necessary to insert a small finger in the nose hole and equally break the fracture with your index finger and thumb until the nose returns to its natural shape: and do this artfully and easily.
Et caue, ne accidat per operationem tuam illam super infirmum dolor.	And take care not to cause that pain on the weakened one during your operation.
Quod si fractura est in superiore parte Nasi, et non perueniat ad illam digitus: tunc oportet, ut aequetur extremitate radii, in quo sit grossitudo parua.	That if the fracture is in the upper part of the nose and does not reach that finger: then it should be evened out with the tip of the radius, in which there is a small thickness.
Si uero fractura est in duabus partibus, tunc fac simile illius: et propera cum restauratione eius in die primo fracturae, si est possibile.	If the fracture is in two parts then make it similar: and proceed with its restoration on the first day of the fracture if possible.
Et si non, tunc post diem septimum, aut decimum apud quietem apostematis calidi.	And if not, then after seven or ten days until it has healed with the heat of rest.
Deinde intromitte in extremitate Nasi licinium ex panno lini, si fractura est in parte una: aut intromite duo licinia si fractura est in duabus partibus: et sit in licinio grossitudo tantae quantitatis, quae impleat foramen Nasi.	Then insert into the nose's tip a linen thread if it is broken on one side: or insert two threads if it is broken in two parts: and let it be of such a thickness as to fill the nose hole.
Et dixerunt quidam antiquorum restauratorum, ut infundantur licinia in butyro, et permutentur omni die.	And some old restorers said that they should dip the thread into butter and change it every day.
Illud uero non uidetur mihi, imo oportet, ut infundatur licinium in albugine oui, confecto cum puluere molendini.	That does not seem right to me, but it should be dipped into the chalk powder when it is finely ground with the flour.
Deinde dimitte licinium, donec firmetur os, et induretur cartilago.	Then remove the thread until the nose bone has hardened and the cartilage has become tough.
Et quandoque intromittitur in Nasum loco licinii penna anseris, postquam inuoluitur super ipsam pannus lenis: et fit, quod ipsa tenet fracturam Nasi uehementius, et ut non prohibeatur infirmus ab inspiratione.	And when a goose feather is inserted into the nose place instead of the thread after it has been wrapped with a soft linen cloth: and it happens that it holds the fracture in the nose more securely, and does not prevent the weakened one from breathing.
Et non est haec res necessaria.	This is not necessary.
Si uis, fac illud: et si uis, fac licinia.	If you want to do so, then do it: and if you don't want to, then do the thread.
Quod si accidat Naso iterum dum operaris apostema calidum, emplastra nasum cum caeroto, aut cum coto infuso in oleo rosato, aut modico ex dyaquilon.	That if the nose should get warm again during the operation while healing: then put a green poultice on the nose: or dip it in rosewater infused with a little honey, or a little bit of dandelion.
Si autem non accidit apostema calidum, tunc oportet, ut emplastres ipsum cum farina sisami, et puluere thuris confecti cum albugine oui.	If, however, an aposteme is not hot, then one should make a paste of it with sissa flour and a dust of turpentine mixed with alumen.
Deinde pone super ipsum stuppam lenem, et non liges Nasum cum aliquo omnino.	Then place a wooden bandage on top of it, and do not bind the nose at all.
Si uero franguntur ossa Nasi fractura parua, aut comminuuntur, tunc oportet, ut scindas super ea, et extrahas ipsa cum instrumentis quae conueniunt eis.	If, however, the nasals are broken or crushed, then one should cut them above and remove them with the instruments that are suitable for this.
Deinde sue scissuram, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat, et consolidat ex emplastris conuenientibus ad illud, uel unguentis.	Then carry out the incision, and take care of the flesh that has become inflamed and consolidated with the plaster that is suitable for it, or with a ointment.
Quod si accidat inter Nasum uulnus, tunc oportet, ut cures ipsum cum liciniis: et administres cannulam de plumbo, donec sanetur.	If, however, an ulnar bone is broken between the nostrils, then one should heal it with liniments: and administer a copper tube, until it has healed.
¶ De restauratione Mandibulae inferioris, quando disrumpitur.	For restoring of the lower jaw, when it is broken.
Caput V.	Chapter V:
Quando disrumpitur Mandibula inferior, et fractura eius non est cum uulnere: conspice tunc si est fractura eius deforis tantum, et non frangitur in duo, et curuatur ad interiora: tunc cognitio eius est facilis.	When the lower jaw is broken and not joined to the ulna: then if it is a simple fracture, and not one that breaks into two pieces, and care is taken of the interior: then it is easy to know.
Oportet ergo, si est fractura eius in parte dextra, ut intromittas digitum indicem sinistrae in os infirmi: similiter si fractura est in mandibula sinistra, tunc intromitte indicem manus dextrae: et impelle cum eo gibbositatem fracturae deintus cum facilitate ad exteriora cum manu tua altera ab interiori parte ossis decenter, et cum eo aequa ipsam.	Then, if it is a fracture on the right side of the jaw, insert your index finger of your left hand into the nose: likewise, if it is a fracture on the left side of the jaw, then insert your index finger of your right hand: and push it with this towards the outside from the inside with your other hand from the inner side of the bone that has been pushed out of place, and so adjust it evenly.
Quod si fractura mandibulae iam separata est in duo, tunc oportet, ut administres extersionem a duabus partibus, secundum rectitudinem: donec possibilis sit aequatio eius.	If the jaw fracture has already separated into two pieces, then one should adjust the outward projection of the two parts according to its straightness: until it is possible to adjust it evenly.
Si autem iam accidit in dentibus commotio, aut disruptio: tunc stringe illos de quibus speras quod remaneant cum filo auri, aut argenti, aut seta.	If, however, an injury has already occurred to the teeth, or a dislocation or fracture: then tighten them with the help of gold, silver, or silk thread that you hope will remain with them.
Deinde pone super mandibulam fractam caerotum.	Then place a poultice on the fractured jaw.
Deinde pone super ipsum pannum duplicatum, et pone super pannum astellam magnam decenter factam: aut frustum cutis soleae aequale, in longitudinem mandibulae.	Then place over it a double cloth, and place over that a large dish-cloth, poorly made: or a piece of skin of the sole, equal to the length of the jaw.
Deinde liga ipsum desuper, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ligatura eius, et conuenit ipsius applicatio, donec non destruitur: et praecipe infirmo, uti tranquillitate et quiete: et pone cibum eius sorbitiones lenes.	Then tie the cloth above it, according to how you have prepared your bandage and let it remain in place until it is destroyed: and tell the sick person to use it with tranquility and calmness: and give him a soft food for his digestion.
Si autem estimas, quod iam alteratur aliquid figurae aliquo modorum: tunc propera, et solue ipsum in die tertio.	But if you think that something of the shape is changing with some kind of change: then come close to it and wash it on the third day.
Deinde rectifica quod alteratum est ex eo, et emplastra ipsum ex puluere molendini, cum albugine oui, aut cum farina sisami, postquam tu abstuleris caerotum: et pone super emplastrum lanam lenem.	Then straightened out what has been changed from it with flour for grinding, mixed with alum or wheat flour, after you have removed the scabs: and place over it a thick woolen cloth.
Dum ergo permanet annexum illud emplastrum super ipsum, et non alteratur ossis dispositio, dimitte ipsum, ne soluas, donec sanetur: aut stringe fracturam.	While that thin plaster remains attached to the wound, and the bone arrangement does not change, let go of it, do not tear it off, until it heals: or tighten the fracture.
Multotiens enim stringitur haec fractura in tribus septimanis.	This fracture is often tightened seven times.
Quod si interim accidat apostema calidum, tunc administra illud quod diximus multotiens in sedatione eius, donec remoueatur illud apostema.	But if during this time there is a hot blister, then administer to it what we have said many times in its sedative, until it disappears.
Et si fractura est cum uulnere, considera.	And if the fracture is with the ulnar bone, consider.
Namsi iam separatur ex osse frustum, aut a satagie: tunc subtilia te in hoc, ut auferas illa frusta satagiae cum eo quod conuenit tibi in ablatione eorum ex instrumentis.	I have already said that the fragment is separated from the bone, or from the spondylosis: then in this you are careful, so as to remove those spondylosis with it when it comes to you in the removal of them from the instruments.
Si uero orificium uulneris est strictum, tunc amplifica ipsum cum phlebotomo secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	But if the orifice of the ulnar bone is closed, then open it with a phlebotome according to the quantity of your need.
Deinde quando abstuleris illa satagie, et non remanserit ex eis aliquid, sue tunc orificium uulneris, si est amplum: et si non, pone super ipsum ex emplastris quae conueniunt ad illud, et incarnant illud, donec sanetur.	Then when you remove those spondylosis, and there remains none of them, then make the orifice of the ulnar bone wider if it is wide: and if not, place over the wound that plaster which comes with it to the wound, and let it grow into flesh until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Furculae, quando frangitur.	As for restoring a fork, when it breaks.
Caput VI.	Chapter VI.
Plurimum quidem frangitur Furcula ab anteriore parte ex parte humeri, et fractura eius fit secundum unum trium modorum.	The furcula is broken from the anterior part of the shoulder blade, and the break occurs in one of three ways.
Aut enim frangitur et separatur in duo, praeter quod accidant in ea satagiae: et est facilius ad restaurationem eius.	Or it may break and separate into two pieces, except that they happen to be in a state where the bone is still attached: and it is easier to repair it.
Aut ita, quod accidunt in osse satagiae: et est difficilius ad restaurationem.	Or such that they happen to the bone of the arm: and it is more difficult to repair it.
Aut ita, quod est fractura cum uulnere.	Or such that it is a break with the ulna bone.
Et operatio in ea quando fractura est absque uulnere, est, ut facias praesentes esse duos ministros, ut teneat unus eorum adiutorium quod sequitur Furculam fractam, et alter extendat collum uersus partem.	And the operation in it when the break is without an ulna, is, so that you have two ministers who hold one of them to help with the broken furcula, and the other extends the neck towards the side.
Deinde aequa fracturam digitis tuis, donec fiat forma eius, secundum quod oportet: et non sit in ea eminentia, neque concauitas.	Then you make the fingers of your hand even, until it is shaped like this, as follows should be: and there should not be any protuberance or depression in it.
Quod si indiges extensione plus, tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico infirmi spheram ex panno, aut lana: et sit magnitudo eius secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae: et extende, et eleua Furculam, et coarta spheram manu tua, donec aeques fracturam, secundum quod oportet.	That if you can bear an extension more, then you should put a round ball under the titillium (small of back) from cloth or wool: and let the size of it be according to the need: and extend it, and smooth out the furcula, and clamp the ball with your hand, until the break is even, as follows should be:
Quod si non potes trahere extremitatem Furculae ad exteriora: propterea, quia peruenit ad profundum: tunc oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et ponas sub humero eius puluinar medium in magnitudine, et premat minister humerum eius ad inferiora, donec eleuetur os Furculae quod est in profundo ad sursum: atque tunc rectifica fracturam, et aequa eam digitis tuis.	That if you cannot draw the tip of the furcula to the outside: since it goes down to a depth: then it is necessary that it should lie on its back on its shoulder blade: and you place under its shoulder blade a ball from wool in size, and press the minister of his shoulder blade downward, until he lifts up the bone of the furcula which is deep: and then adjust the break straight, and make it even with your fingers.
Si autem sentis sathaiatum ex Furcula, et mouetur: tunc oportet, ut findas super illud, et extrahas ipsum alsathaiatum cum facilitate.	If however you feel a pain from the furcula, and it twitches: then you should find on it, and pull out the alsathaiatum (soft tissue) with ease.
Si autem est retentum in osse, tunc ingenia in incisione eius cum uno Incisoriorum quae praeparasti ad illud, postquam tu posueris sub Furcula instrumentum quod seruat sifach: et est instrumentum ex ligno, aut ex ferro.	If however it is stuck to the bone, then use your incision instrument which you have prepared for it, after you have placed under the furcula a device that holds it tight: and this device is made of wood or iron.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is his form.
Assimilatur cochleari cui non est concauitas.	It is assimilated to the ear which is not congenital.
Et sit latitudo eius secundum illud quo indiges eo ex magnitudine ossis, et paruitate eius.	And its width according to that in which you stand so from the size of the bones, and the height of it.
Longitudo uero eius etiam secundum quod possibile est tibi ad operationem.	The length as well is according to what is possible for you to operate.
Et habeat duas extremitates, sicut uides: et extremitas una sit ampla, et altera stricta.	And it has two ends, as you see: and the one end be wide, and the other strict.
Si autem disruptio uulneris quod scidisti quando extraxisti sathaiatum ossis, est ampla, et securaris ab apostemate calido: tunc aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura.	If then the rupture of the wound which you split when you extracted the bone-set is wide, and secures from the hot apothema: then add two lips of the wound with a suture.
Et si disruptio est parua, aut times apostema calidum: tunc imple uulnus cum pannis, et puluillis secundum quantitatem scissurae uulneris.	And if the rupture is small, or if you fear the hot apothema: then fill the wound with linen, and dust it according to the quantity of the wound.
Quod si accidat apostema calidum, tunc infunde pannum in oleo rosato, et aceto, et uino, et pone super ipsum.	That if it should happen that the apothema is hot, then fill the linen with oil of rose, and vinegar, and wine, and set it on itself.
Strictura uero ossis quando est absque uulnere, et absque sectione, est, ut ponas super os emplastrum factum ex farina molendini cum albugine oui.	The stricture of the bone is, when it is without wound, and without section, is, as you put on os an olem made from flour pounded with alabaster dust.
Et pone stuppam lenem super ipsum.	And set a block of wood on it.
Deinde pone spheram sub titillico eius, si indiges illa.	Then set a ball under its tip, if you can bear that.
Deinde accipe himematem, id est, rotam quam tenent Saraceni, quae sit longa ualde: et sit latitudo eius palmi unius, aut circiter illud.	Then take the hematic fluid, which is a ball held by the Saracens, which is long far more than it is wide, and its width a palm or so, or about that.
Deinde pone puluillum duplicatum super stuppam et emplastrum.	Then set a doubled powder on the block, and the plaster.
Deinde accipe astellam ex tabula subtili, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, et in longitudine similiter.	Then take an arrow from a thin board, whose width is three fingers, and in length similarly.
Deinde inuolue eam in panno.	Then wrap it in a cloth.
Deinde inuolue pannum illum cum astella in loco alhimemati qui cadit super fracturam et locum.	Then wrap the cloth with the arrow in place, on the fracture and spot.
Deinde pone alhimemati super fracturam sicut reuoluiur, et inuolue eam super collum eius, et sub titillico eius sano, et sub titillico eius infirmo: et reduc eam super omnem partem, et quomodo uides quod strictura tenet fracturam strictura decenti: et est illud, quod non occultatur super te, et totum, ut non remoueatur astella desuper os fractum.	Then set the alichemist on the fracture as a bandage, and wrap it around his neck, and under his chin, and over his collar bone, and under his armpit: and let it be tight, so that the stricture does not shift: and this is, that it should not hide from you, and all, so that the arrow does not move from above the bone's fracture.
Et propter hoc oportet, ut aspicias infirmum in omni die.	You should look at the sick person every day.
Quotiens ergo mollificatur ligamentum, et uides astellam iam remoueri: tunc rectifica illud, et stringe ligamentum.	As soon as the ligaments have softened and you see that the bone has moved, then straightens it and ties the ligaments tightly.
Deinde pone somnum infirmi super dorsum eius, et pone sub titillico eius apud somnum eius puluinar paruum in nocte, ut cum eo eleuetur adiutorium eius a latere ipsius.	Then put an anaesthetic poultice on his back, and place a warm cloth under his thigh while he sleeps at night, so that when he rises his relief will be greater.
Eleuatur ergo fractura furculae per eleuationem humeri.	So the fracture of the femur is healed by the elevation of the shoulder.
Aut liga brachium eius ad collum ipsius: et non soluas ligamentum, si non accidat in loco accidens ex pruritu, aut ab apostemate, usque ad duodecim dies.	Or bind his arm to his neck; and do not untie the ligaments unless there is an accident from a sprain or a fall until after twelve days.
Deinde renoua emplastrum, si uideris faciem eius ad illud.	Then put on a poultice of mud, if you see that his face is red to it.
Et adde in strictura, et dimitte ipsum, donec restauretur et coaguletur.	And add salt, and let him go, until he has recovered and has coagulated.
Et fractura quidem furculae stringitur et confortatur secundum plurimum in uigintiocto diebus: et quandoque fit in quibusdam hominibus in minore illo.	And the fracture of the femur is bound up and made firm after thirty days; and sometimes it heals sooner in some people.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spatulae.	On the restoration of the fracture of the spatula.
Caput VII.	Chapter VII.
Raro frangitur Spatula, et in loco lato eius: et non franguntur ex ea nisi margines eius.	The spatula rarely breaks and at its broad end; it does not break from its broad end.
Quando ergo frangitur ex eo locus, et frangitur in medio eius, et non cognoscitur illud nisi per tactum: tunc secundum quod est figura fracturae conare praeparationem eius.	So if it breaks from one end, and it breaks in the middle, and it is not known until you feel it; then prepare the treatment according to the shape of the fracture.
Et reduc eam super figuram naturalem omni modo ingenii, quod est tibi possibile.	And reduce it to its natural position by all the skill at your command, which is possible for you.
Deinde pone super locum puluerem molendini cum albugine oui, et stuppam lenem, et pone desuper puluillum ex panno duplato.	Then put on the wound a poultice of flour mixed with chalk, and a wooden board, and place a warm cloth on top of it.
Deinde pone super ipsum astellam latam ex tabula subtili secundum quantitatem Spatulae totius, aut ampliorem ea parum.	Then put on the person a thin pad of hay from a thin board according to the length of the spatula throughout, or longer it by a little.
Si uero sub astella est concauitas in aliquo locorum Spatulae, tunc aequa illam concauitatem cum stuppa leni, donec descendat astella secundum aequalitatem.	If the person is under the pad in any part of the spatula, then equalize it with the wooden board, until the pad drops down according to the equality.
Deinde ftringe desuper cum alhimemati longa, constrictione decenti, et firmitudine astellae, donec non remoueatur a loco suo.	Then, with the help of an alchemist, make a long strip of cloth tight and firm, and fasten it to the body, until it does not move from its place.
Et considera ligamentum in omni die.	And consider the ligature every day.
Quotienscunque ergo mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum, et aequa astellam si remoueatur a loco suo: et iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	Whenever it becomes soft, tighten it again and if it moves from its place at all, make the fabric equal in thickness and let the sick person lie on his sound side.
Et Spatula quidem restauratur in uiginti diebus, aut in uigintiquinque diebus.	And the spatula is to be restored after twenty or twenty-five days.
Quando ergo completur iste numerus, tunc solue ligamentum: et tu sis in securitate.	When this number is complete, then loosen the ligature: and you shall be safe.
Nam ipsa est ex ossibus quorum communitio non timetur, neque eorum solutio.	For this is made of bones whose connection is not feared, and their loosening causes no harm.
Si autem procedat ex osse frustum, et pungit sub cute: tune scinde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum.	But if it proceeds from a bone-fragment, and pierces the skin: then cut it above it, and remove it.
Et fac quod diximus in fractura furculae ex sedatione apostematis calidi, si accidat ex eo aliquid.	And do as I said in the fracture of the fork from sitting on a hot seat, if anything happens from it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Pectoris.	Regarding the restoration of a fractured breastbone:
Caput VIII.	Chapter VIII
Pectus quandoque frangitur in medio sui, et raro accidit illud.	The breastbone sometimes breaks in the middle, and this rarely happens.
Extremitates eius quidem plurimum franguntur, et comminuuntur ex accidentibus eius.	Its extremities, however, are most likely to break, and they are destroyed by the accidents that befall it.
Quando frangitur eius medium, quod declinat ad inferiora, et accidit ei dolor uehemens, et difficultas in anhelitu, et tussis: et fortasse euomit sanguinem, et declaratur concauitas in osse fracto, et non occultatur sensui, Restauratio eius est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et pone inter Spatulas eius puluinar.	When the middle of it breaks and turns downward, there is a painful difficulty in breathing, coughing, perhaps a little blood, and a broken sense; its restoration is that the sick person shall lie on his back: and place the spatula under its bones.
Deinde preme humeros eius, et aggrega costas a duabus partibus uel lateribus cum manibus: et subtiliare in aequatione eius, secundum omnem modum quo possibile est illud et conuenit, donec redeat figura ossis, secundum quod oportet.	Then press his shoulders and join the ribs on both sides with the hands: and make it equal in length, in whatever way is possible, and let it come together; until it恢复 its shape, according to which it is needed, let it be set in place.
Deinde pone super ipsum emplastrum et stuppam, et pone desuper astellam ex tabula subtili ex salice, aut chalingi, et ex eis similibus in leuitate, postquam tu inuoluis eam in panno.	Then place a plaster and a pad on it, and put the board above it from a thin piece of linden or poplar, and something similar for lightness, after you have washed it with a cloth.
Deinde subtiliare in ligando eam super os fractum, ut non remoueatur: et uade cum ligatura secundum rotunditatem ad dorsum aliquotiens, et stringe ipsum strictura decenti.	Then apply a delicate ligature over the broken bone to keep it in place, and sometimes turn it slightly backwards so that it may not move forward; and tighten the ligature as the skin tightens around it.
Deinde considera ligaturam in omni hora, et quotienscumque mollificatur, stringe eam: et si necessitas eius prouocat ad solutionem eius apud pruritum, uel corrosionem quae accidit in loco, aut dolorem, aut apostema: tunc propera, et solue eam, et eradica emplastrum, et rectifica quod accidit cum modo curationis eius.	Then consider the ligature at all times, and whenever it becomes soft, tighten it; and if necessity compels to undo it for any reason, such as itching, or corrosion that has occurred in the place, or pain, or swelling: then approach and loosen it, and remove the plaster, and set aright what has happened during the course of treatment.
Deinde reduc emplastrum, si uides ad illud faciem: et annecte ei stricturam, donec sanetur.	Then remove the plaster, if you see towards it: and attach to it the ligature, until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Costarum, quando franguntur.	For the restoration of bones when they are broken.
Caput IX.	Chapter IX.
Scias, quod Costarum fractura non accidit, nisi in locis grossis quae sequuntur dorsum, et ex extremitatibus earum ab anteriori parte.	You should know that the fracture of bones does not occur unless in the areas behind the back, and from the extremes thereof towards the front part.
Et non accidit eis attritio, nisi propterea, quia sunt cartilaginosae.	And it does not occur to them any wearisome thing, except therefore, because they are cartilage-like.
Et cognitio ipsius non occultatur sensui apud inquisitionem cum digitis.	And the knowledge thereof is not concealed from the sense during inquiry with the fingers.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, ut aeques fracturam cum digitis secundum modum possibilem, donec aequetur figura, secundum quod oportet.	And the restoration thereof is done in such a way that the break between the fingers is made even, according to what is possible, so that it may be even in shape; and according to that it needs to be.
Deinde emplastra, et stringe os fractum cum astella, si indiget illo.	Then wrap a plaster around the broken bone with a splint if necessary.
Et si fractura Costarum est decliuis ad interiora: tunc accidit infirmo dolor uehemens, et punctura, sicut punctura illa quae accidit illi qui habet pleuresim: propterea, quod os pungit uelamen, et etiam ei accidit difficultas anhelitus, et tussis, et uomitus sanguinis multi: et haec est difficilis curationis.	And if the fracture of the bones is hidden towards the inside: then a very painful pain happens to the person, and a kind of tickling, such as that which happens to him who has pleurisy; because the bone pricks the wound, and also difficulty in breathing, and coughing, and much blood-spitting: and this is difficult to treat.
Et iam ingeniati sunt antiqui in ea cum ingeniis multis: et ex eis sunt qui dicunt, ut ponas cibos infirmi qui generent inflammationem et uentositatem, ut inflammetur uenter, et extendatur, et impellatur fractura ad exteriora.	And the ancient people have made many inventions for it; and among them are those who say that you should put on a bed that causes inflammation and irritation, so that the belly may become inflamed, and spread out, and push forward the fracture to the outside.
Nos uero abhorremus, ut non fiat caussa uelox ad faciendum apostema calidum, si non accidit.	We therefore abhor the formation of a cold poultice, lest it cause a delay in making an warm one if it does not occur.
Si autem iam accidit, tunc addit in eo.	But if it has already occurred, then let us add to that.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: ponatur super locum uentosa, deinde sugatur cum fortitudine, et est similius ratiocinationi.	And one of them said: Let a warm place be placed there, and then let it be drained with strength, and it is more like reasoning.
Verumtamen timetur, quod attrahat uentosa superfluitates ad locum, propter dispositionem debilitatis.	However, we fear that the warm vapours will attract fluid to the spot, due to the weak condition of the body.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: oportet ut cooperiatur locus cum lana quae iam submersa est in oleo calido: et ponantur puluilli inter Costas, donec impleatur: ut sit ligatura aequalis quando inuoluis eam secundum rotunditatem.	And one of them said: It is necessary that the place be covered with wool which has already been immersed in hot oil: and let feathers be placed between the ribs, so that it be filled: so as to be a loop of equal length when it is turned around by its roundness.
Deinde curetur infirmus curatione pleuresis ex cibo et medicina.	Then let the sick person be cared for with pleurosis from food and medicine.
Quod si coartat infirmum res uehemens, quam non tolerat, et os pungit uelamen punctura laedente, et timemus super infirmum: tunc oportet, ut scindamus super locum, et detegamus a Costa fracta.	That if we strap the sick person tightly, which it does not tolerate, and the mouth is pricked by a pin that hurts, and we fear for the sick man: then let us split him on the spot, and let us find from the ribs a broken one.
Deinde ponamus super ea instrumentum quod conseruat sifac, cuius rememoratio praecessit: et incidamus os cum facilitate, et incidamus ipsum.	Then let us place over it an instrument that preserves the siffar, whose memory preceded: and we will cut the mouth with ease, and we will cut into it.
Deinde aggregemus duo labia uulneris, si est magnum cum sutura: et curemus ipsum cum emplastris, donec sanetur.	Then let us gather together two lips of the wound, if it is large with a stitch: and let us treat him with plasters, until he heals.
Quod si accidat interim apostema calidum, tunc propera, et infunde puluillos in oleo rosato, et pone super locum: et curetur infirmus cum eo quod conuenit apostemati.	That if the warm poultice occurs during this time, then let us approach, and pour feathers into rose oil, and place them on the spot: and let the sick person be treated with it as is appropriate to the poultice.
Interim etiam resupinetur super latus super quod dormit, donec sanetur.	In the meantime, he shall also lie down on the side where he sleeps, until he heals.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spondilium dorsi et colli.	The restoration of a broken spine of the back and neck.
Caput X.	Head X.
Ossibus quidem colli quandoque aduenit fractura, et raro accidit eis attritio: et similiter Spondilibus dorsi etiam.	Of the bones of the neck, when a fracture occurs, and it rarely happens that they are worn out: and so also of the spines of the back.
Cum ergo accidit illud alicui, et uis scire, an sanetur, an non sanetur: tunc confidera.	So then if it happened to someone and you don't know whether it was cured or not, trust.
Nam si uides manus eius iam mollificatas, et stupefactas, et mortuas: et non potest mouere eas, neque extendere eas, neque constringere eas: et quando constringis eas cum digitis tuis, et pungis eas cum acu, non sentit illud, et non sentit in eis dolorem: tunc scias, quia non sanatur, et in pluribus dispositionibus est mortale.	For if you see his hands already softened, and stuporized, and dead: and cannot be moved, nor extended, nor constricted: and when you constrict them with your fingers, and pierce them with a needle, he does not feel it, and does not feel pain in them: then you will know that it is not healed, and it is deadly in many dispositions.
Quod si mouet eas, et sentit in eis constrictionem cum digitis et puncturam: tunc scias, quia nucha ossis salua est, et quod infirmus sanabitur cum curatione.	That if he moves them, and feels constriction with your fingers and the prick: then you will know that the neck of the bones is healed, and that the sick will be healed with cure.
Quod si eueniat Spondilibus dorsi simile illius, et uis scire, an sanetur etiam, an non: tunc considera ad pedes eius: tunc si uides quod mollificati sunt, et accidit in eis illud quod accidit in manibus: deinde quando iacet super dorsum suum, egreditur uentositas et egestio absque uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super uentrem suum, egreditur egestio sine uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super dorsum suum, et uult mingere, et non potest: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	That if it becomes like the spine of the back on him, and you want to know whether it is healed or not, then consider his feet: then if you see that they are softened, and what happened to his hands happens to them: then when he lies down on his back, he moves and has a desire to defecate without volition: and when he raises himself up over his belly, he does the same: and when he raises himself up over his back, and wants to drink, and cannot: then you will know that it is deadly.
Non ergo labores in curatione eius.	So do not work on his cure.
Si uero non accidit ei aliquid ex illo, res est leuior.	But if anything from that does not happen to him, the matter is lighter.
Et curatio eius quod accidit ex illo est, ut coneris sedationem apostematis calidi: ita, ut ponas super Spondilem attritam oleum rosatum solum: aut cum uitellis oui assati.	And the cure of him that happens from that is, as you know, a sedative wax: so that you put it on a broken spine with rose oil only: or when you wipe it off.
Pone super ipsam illud aliquotiens in die, donec quando sedatur apostema calidum: tum pone super locum unum ex emplastris confortantibus, exiccantibus, et stringe super ipsum cum ligamento: et praecipe infirmo, ut utatur quiete et tranquillitate.	Place over it the thing a few times in the day until he sits down when he is sedated: then place over one of the places that comforts, dries, and ties to him with a ligament: and order the sick person to use quietly and tranquilly.
Nec dormiat super partem cum qua inuenit dolorem, donec sanetur.	And do not let him sleep on the side where he feels pain until he is healed.
Quod si accidit apud attritionem ossis sathaiatum, aut aliquid quod iam separatum fit ex eo: tunc oportet, ut seces super cutem, et auferas illud.	If it happens that there is a rupture of the bone joint, or something that has already been separated from it: then you should, as it were, separate the wound on the skin and remove it.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, si est magnum, cum sutura.	Then gather together the two sides of the wound with a stitch.
Deinde cura ipsum cum aliquo incarnatiuo, ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then take care of himself with some ointment, from the unguent, until he is healed.
Si uero frangitur postremum ossis alhausos, et est finis caudae: tunc oportet, ut intromittas pollicem manus sinistrae in anum, et aeques os fractum manu altera, secundum quod possibile est, et secunda aequatione.	If, however, the bone is finally broken at the end of the shinbone, and the end is severed: then you should, with the thumb of the left hand, introduce it into the socket of the bone that has been broken, and with the right hand, as well as you can, and by means of a second equating.
Deinde pone super ipsum, et aufer ipsum: et cura uulnus cum curatione quae praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then put it back on itself, and take it off: and take care of the wound with the same cure that preceded it, until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Anchae.	The Restoration of Bones.
Caput XI.	CHAPTERXI.
Raro franguntur ossa Ancharum.	Bones of Ankhs rarely break.
Quod si franguntur, tunc fractura eorum non est, nisi comminutio in extremitatibus ipsorum: et scinduntur in longitudine, et declinantur ad interiora: et accidit infirmo dolor in loco, et punctura: et stupescit crus quod frangitur.	If they do break, then their fracture is not, unless the break is at the ends of them: and they split along their length, and bend inward: and there results a pain and a bruise in the joint where it breaks: and the leg is lame because it is broken.
Et restauratio quidem eius est, ut extendas manum tuam super ipsum, donec stes super fracturam qualiter est figura eius.	And its restoration is such that you should stretch out your hand over it, until you stand on the fracture as in this figure (show).
Quod si fractura est in extremitatibus eius tantum, tunc aequa illam fracturam, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ex aequatione, donec assimiletur figurae suae naturali.	If the fracture is only at the ends of it, then make it equal, according to the way you are prepared by means of an equating, until it resembles its natural shape.
Si autem fractura est in longitudine, aut iam declinat ad interiora: tunc fac iacere infirmum super uentrem suum, donec praeparetur tibi restauratio illius fracturae.	But if the fracture is along its length, or has already bent inward: then let the sick man lie on his stomach, until such time as its restoration is prepared for you.
Quando ergo aequaueris ipsam, pone super ipsam emplastrum: deinde pone super ipsam astellam ex ligno, aut ex cute: et stringe strictura super quam non timeas permutationem fracturae, neque remotionem astellae.	When you have made it equal, then place over it an emprastum: then place over it a wooden frame, or a strip of skin: and string with a tight bond so that you do not change the fracture, and do not remove the frame.
Et aequa concauitatem illorum cum eo quod impleat eam, donec capiat eam strictura secundum aequalitatem: et praecipe infirmo, ut dormiat super dorsum suum, aut super latus suum sanum.	So he equitably cuts them with him so that he fills it, until he takes it, by the constriction according to the equitability: and order the sick man to lie down on his back or on his sound side.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc cessa ab extensione eius, et ipsius restauratione, donec sedetur apostema calidum: et pone super ipsum quod sedet ipsum, secundum quod praecessit, deinde redi ad restaurationem eius: et stringe ipsum sicut oportet.	But if it happens to him that there is a hot aposteme: then cease from extending it, and from his restoration, until the hot aposteme has subsided: and put over him who sits what he sits, according to what preceded, then return to his restoration again: and bind him as it should be.
Si uero accidit in osse satagie, aut comminuitur, extrahe.	But if, on the other hand, there is a fracture of the bone, or it has been crushed out, extract it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Adiutorii.	On the restoration of a fractured bone, an assistant.
Caput XII.	Head XII.
Adiutorium est illud, quod est inter cubitum usque ad caput Spatulae.	The assistant is that which is between the bed and the head of the spoon.
Si ergo frangitur, tunc restauratio eius est secundum unum duorum modorum.	But if it is broken, then its restoration is according to two ways.
Quorum unus est: ut accipias lignum planum mediae grossitudinis, secundum hanc formam, quae sequitur.	One of which is that you take a flat piece of wood of average size, according to this form, which follows.
Et ligentur in duabus extremitatibus duo ligamenta.	And two ligaments are tied at the two ends.
Deinde suspendatur ex loco eleuato: et sedeat infirmus super sedem.	Then hang it from a raised place: and let the sick man sit on a seat.
Deinde proiiciat brachium suum fractum super lignum, donec perueniat ad titillicum eius, in cuius medio sit annexa curuitas ligni.	Then he throws his broken arm over the wood, until it reaches its point, at which there is an attachment of the wood.
Deinde suspende desuper ipsum aliquid graue, ut extendat ipsum minister ad inferiora.	Then hang him upside down from above him with something heavy, that he may extend himself by the assistant to the lower parts.
Deinde aequet medicus fracturam manibus suis simul, donec redeat fractura, secundum quod oportet.	Then the doctor makes his hands even at the same time, until he has restored the fracture, according to which it is necessary.
Et modus alter est, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et suspende manum eius a collo ipsius cum ligamento.	And the other mode is that the sick man should lie down on his chest: and he hangs his hand from his neck with a ligament.
Deinde praecipe duobus ministris, ut teneat unus eorum illud quod est supra fracturam cum manibus suis: et ut alter teneat inferius eius, et extendat unusquisque eorum ad partem suam.	Then order two of his assistants to hold the one which is above the fracture with their hands: and that the other should hold below him, and each of them extends to its side.
Et si uis, ut sit extensio fortior, tunc stringe sub fractura cum ligamento, et supra ipsam cum ligamento alio: et extendat ea unusquisque duorum ministrorum ad duas partes suas.	And if it is necessary, so that the extension may be stronger, then bind under the fracture with a ligament, and above it with another ligament: and each of the two assistants extends to the two sides.
Si ergo fractura est propinqua extremitati humeri, tunc oportet, ut ponatur unum ligamentum sub titillico, et alterum sub fractura uersus cubitum.	If then there is a fracture at the end of the humerus, then it is necessary to put one ligament under the sternum, and another against the fracture towards the cubit.
Et similiter si fractura est propinqua cubito: tunc oportet, ut ponatur ligamentum super illum locum, et super cubitum ipsum.	And likewise if there is a fracture at the end of the cubit: then it is necessary to put one ligament on that place and on the cubit itself.
Deinde aequa fracturam cum facilitate absque labore, donec quando aequatur fractura secundum quod oportet, et applicatur applicatione bona: tunc stringe eam, si non accidit apostema calidum.	Then the fractured bone should be straightened with ease without effort, until the fracture is made equal in accordance with what needs to be done and applied with good application: then tighten it, if there does not happen to be a swelling of heat.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam usque ad diem septimum.	If however there happens to be a swelling of heat, then do not tighten the bandage until the seventh day.
Et pone super ipsum lanam succidam imbibitam in aceto et oleo rosato, donec quando quiescit apostema: tunc stringe eam: et modus stringendi eam est, ut ponas emplastrum super fracturam.	And place on the bone a wet wool that has been soaked in vinegar and oil with rose water, until when the swelling subsides: then tighten it: and the mode of tightening it is such that you place a plaster on the fracture.
Deinde pone inuolutionem ex panno nouo super emplastrum.	Then put the new solution made of cloth over the plaster.
Deinde aggreget brachium super adiutorium ipsum, et ponat manum suam apertam super humerum suum.	Then tighten the arm with an aid, and let him put his hand open on his shoulder.
Et pone pannum, et stringe super adiutorium brachium, ut brachium stet loco astellarum: si non prohibet te ab illo aliquid, neque alteretur super te aliquid ex osse fracto.	And put a cloth, and tighten the arm on the aid so that the arm remains in place with the arms: if it does not forbid you to do so, and does not disturb you with anything from the broken bone.
Quod si times, quod alteretur super te ex osse fracto aliquid, tunc utere astellis: et est, ut ponas super fracturam ipsam astellam quae sit latior et fortior reliquis astellis.	That if you are in a time when something that disturbs you from the broken bone is allowed, then use plasters: and it is such that you place on the fracture itself a plaster which is broader and stronger than the other plasters.
Et ponas inter omnem astellam latitudinem digiti: et sit longitudo astellarum secundum fracturam cum additione trium digitorum ab omni parte.	And place between all the plasters the width of a finger: and let the length of the plasters be in accordance with the fracture with the addition of three fingers from any side.
Deinde stringe super astellas strictura quam dixi in principio capituli.	Then tighten the plasters with the tightening which I have mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.
Et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae strictior.	And let it be tighter on the fracture site than the tightening which you have made.
Et quanto plus elongatur fractura, sit strictura minor.	And the tighter the fracture is extended, the smaller is the tightening.
Si ergo uides situm astellarum et stricturam, sicut diximus, in hora qua restauras membrum statim, tunc fac: et si times apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam et astellas usque ad diem septimum, sicut diximus.	If then you see the length of the plasters and the tightening, as we have said, in the hour when you restore the member immediately, then do so: and if you are in a time of a swelling of heat, then do not tighten the plasters and do not leave them on until the seventh day, as we have also said.
Deinde considera ligamentum in omnibus tribus diebus, ut non accidat in loco pruritus, aut inflatio, aut prohibeatur cibus peruenire ad membrum, propter dispositionem superfluitatis stricturae.	Then consider the ligament for all three days, so that there is no itching, swelling or restriction of food reaching the limb due to excessive tightness.
Rectifica ergo illud totum, secundum quod diximus.	Correct this whole thing according to what we have said.
Si uero es super fiduciam, ut non accidat ex illo aliquid: tunc non soluas ligamentum, nisi post tres dies, aut plus.	But if you are really not confident, so that nothing may come from it: then do not loosen the ligaments, unless after three days or more.
Et sit dormitio infirmi super dorsum suum, et manus eius super stomachum suum: et pone sub adiutorio culcitram plenam lana aequaliter.	And let the nurse sit on his back and his hands on his belly, and place under the pillow a full blanket of wool, equal in thickness.
Et considera in omni hora noctis, aut diei, ut non soluatur figura membri fracta, aut mollificetur ligamentum.	And consider at every hour of the night or day, so that the fractured limb is not loosed, nor are the ligaments weakened.
Rectifica ergo illud totum uirtute tua.	Correct this whole thing with your strength.
Et pone cibum infirmi secundum ordinem quem praemisimus, ita ut sit cibus subtilis in primis, donec incipiat os stringi: tunc oportet, ut ingrosses cibum eius.	And provide food for the nurse according to the order which we have set out, so that there is a slight food in the first place, until the jaw begins to close: then it should become thicker the food.
De consuetudine enim adiutorii et cruris est, ut stringatur in quadraginta diebus: tunc ergo oportet, ut soluatur, et administretur balneum, et medicetur cum unguentis quae rectificant illud.	For the habit of the assistant and the limb is to be tightened for forty days: then it should be loosed, and a bath administered to it, and it should be treated with an ointment that straightens it.
Quod si fractura fuerit foeda, attrita: tunc non soluas ab ea ligamentum et astellas usque ad quinquaginta dies, et usque ad duos menses.	If the fracture is putrid, rubbed: then do not loosen the ligaments and the splints until fifty days, and until two months.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Brachii.	On the Restoration of a Broken Arm.
Caput XIII.	CHAPTER XIII.
Brachium est compositum ex duobus ossibus, quae nominantur duo focilia.	The arm is composed of two bones, which are called two fascicles.
Quorum unum est paruum: et est illud quod sequitur pollicem.	Of which one is small; and that is what follows the thumb.
Et alterum est magnum, et est illud quod est positum sub paruo ab inferiori parte.	And the other is large, and that is what is placed under the little finger on the lower side.
Fortasse ergo frangitur focile maius solum, aut paruum: et fortasse franguntur simul.	Perhaps therefore the larger fascicle breaks alone, or the smaller one: and perhaps they both break at once.
Quando ergo frangitur focile paruum superius, tunc restauratio eius est facilis, et sanatio eius est facilior.	But when the smaller fascicle breaks above, then the restoration of it is easy, and its cure is easier.
Et quando frangitur focile inferius, est fractura eius mala, et sanatio eius difficilis.	And when the larger one breaks below, this is a bad break, and its cure is difficult.
Et deterior ea est, quando franguntur duo ossa simul.	And it is worse when two bones break at the same time.
Si ergo os quod frangitur est focile parum superius, tunc conuenit medico apud restaurationem eius, ut ponat extensionem paruam cum facilitate, donec aequet ipsum.	But if the bone that is broken is only a little above, then it is suitable for the doctor to restore it with ease until it is equal to the other.
Si uero focile magnum est illud quod fractum est: tunc oportet, ut ponat stricturam fortiorem ualde.	But if the broken bone is a large one, then he should put on a stronger bandage tightly.
Et oportet, ut ponat figuram manus apud restaurationem eius, et ipsius extensionem extensam super puluinar.	And he should put on the shape of the hand at the restoration of it and a long extension over the little finger.
Et sit pollex manus ad superiora altior omnibus digitis: et sit articularis inferior omnibus digitis, uel reliquis: et infirmus sedens quadratus super seipsum, et sit puluinar coram eo, uel in directo eius, in altitudine, ut non incurrat infirmus laborem.	And the thumb of the hand should be set higher than all the other fingers; and the lower joint of all the fingers, or any other: and the sick person should sit on a square before himself, and the little finger should face him, or in front of him, at height, so that he does not suffer any trouble.
Deinde extendat minister Brachium ab inferiori parte, aut manu sua, aut cum ligamento.	Then let him extend the arm from the lower part, or with his hand, or with a bandage.
Et minister alius extendat desuper similiter.	And another minister should extend it from above.
Deinde aequet medicus os, donec reducat ipsum secundum meliorem figuram quam potest.	Then the doctor should make the bone equal, until he reduces it to the best shape he can get.
Quod si in fractura ossis sunt satagiae, tunc conare reducere omne frustum in loco suo uirtute tua.	If there are any fractures in the bones, then you should strive to reduce any fragment in its place with your power.
Si uero apparet in eo sathaiatum separatum, et pungit cutem, et non est tibi spes in restauratione eius: tunc finde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum secundum modum quem diximus in eis quae praemissa sunt.	But if it seems to you that there is a separation in it, and it stings the skin, and you have no hope of restoring it: then find on top of it, and take it off according to the manner which we have said in those which precede.
Si autem fractura est cum uulnere, ego iam feci ad illud capitulum singulare, ergo accipe curationem illius inde.	But if the fracture is with the wrist, I have already made to this single capiter, so you take the cure of it from there.
Quod si accidat in principio tuae restaurationis apostema calidum, tunc line pannum cum caeroto facto ex oleo rosato, et caera alba, et sit medium inter spissitudinem et subtilitatem: et stringe pannum super ipsum strictura subtili, donec quando sedatur apostema: tunc remoue caerotum, et pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum albumine oui.	If it should happen in the beginning of your restoration that there is a hot swelling, then take a fine cloth made of linen with a green dye, and white wax, and put it between the thickness and thinness: and tighten the cloth on the bone with a thin string, until such time as it sits when it is sitting: then remove the cloth, and put on an ointment prepared from a powder of herbs mixed with white wax.
Deinde pone astellas, et sit astella quae ponitur super fracturam ipsam latior parumper, et fortior.	Then put on stars, and let there be a star that is placed over the fracture itself wider by a little, and stronger.
Et scias, quod numerus astellarum Brachii est sex in pluribus dispositionibus: siue sit fractura in focili uno, aut in duobus focilibus simul.	And know that the number of stars of the arm is six in multiple dispositions: whether it be a fracture in one fist, or in two fists simultaneously.
Deinde pone stricturam tuam super locum fracturae fortiorem et uehementiorem, et aliquanto plus cum strictura ad superiora fracturae, aut ad inferiora eius: aut pone stricturam molliorem strictura eius parumper, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius in principio capituli.	Then put on your restraint over the place of the fracture stronger and more severe, and a little more with the restraint to the upper fracture, or to the lower one: or put on a softer restraint according to what preceded the memory of it at the beginning of the chapter.
Et sint panni qui inuoluuntur super fracturam, panni lenes, humidi: et non sint duri, asperi.	And let there be cloths wrapped around the fracture, soft, wet cloths: and let them not be hard, rough.
Et sit filum quo stringitur ex lino proprie, medium inter subtile et grossum, sicut narrauimus.	And let there be a cord that is twisted from linen itself, middle between thin and thick, as we have described it.
Et considera membrum et ligamentum post dies.	And consider the member and ligaments after days.
Quod si accidat aliquid cuius rectificatio sit necessaria, sicut pruritus qui accidit membro: tunc oportet, ut embroces membrum cum aqua calefacta, donec quiescat ille pruritus, et dimittas membrum non constrictum, donec quiescat, deinde itera stricturam.	That if something happens in which correction is necessary, such as itching that occurs in a member: then it should be, to immerse the member with warm water, until that itch subsides, and remove the member not constricted, until it subsides, and then repeat the restraint.
Quod si strictura iam mollificata est, et os iam remotum, et similia illis: tunc rectifica illud totum uirtute tua, et considera iterum.	That if the restraint is already softened, and the bone is already removed, and similar to them: then correct it all with your virtue, and consider again.
Nam si nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad membrum, propter superfluitatem stricturae, tunc oportet, ut mollifices ipsum parumper, et dimittas ipsum aliquot diebus, donec currat ad ipsum nutrimentum, deinde stringe ipsum.	For if nutrition is prevented from reaching the member, due to excess restraint: then it should be, to soften it a little, and remove it for a few days, until it heals towards it, and then restrain it.
Si autem non accidit infirmo aliquid eorum quae diximus, tunc non oportet, ut soluatur, nisi post uiginti dies, aut circiter hos.	If, however, nothing of what we have said happens, then it should not be, to be healed, unless after twenty days, or around them.
Deinde suspendatur manus infirmi ad collum eius.	Then let the member be suspended to its neck.
Et sit collum eius aequale, et custodiatur uirtute sua a motibus agitatiuis.	And let the neck be equal, and protected with his virtue from moving movements.
Et fac eum dormire super dorsum suum.	And let him sleep on his back.
Et scias, quod haec fractura in triginta diebus, aut in triginta duobus diebus restauratur: et fortasse restauratur in uigintiocto diebus.	And know that this fracture is restored in thirty days, or in thirty-two days: and perhaps it is restored in twenty-eight days.
Totum illud est secundum dispositiones complexionum, et dispositiones uirtutis.	All this depends on the arrangement of the layers and the arrangement of the strength.
¶ De restauratione fracturarum Manus.	On the restoration of broken bones Hand.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter XXII.
Scias, quod pectini Manus, et nodis digitorum raro accidit fractura.	You should know that it is rare for there to be a fracture in the hand, and that of the fingers rarely occurs.
Et non accidit ei, nisi attritio multotiens.	And this does not happen unless there has been much friction.
Quando ergo accidit plantae fractura, aut attritio: tunc oportet, ut sedeat infirmus quadratus: et coram eo sit sedes secundum aequalitatem.	When therefore there is a fracture of the hand or friction: then it is necessary that the sick person should sit upright in bed; and there should be a seat before him, equal to it.
Deinde pone Manum eius super eam extensam.	Then put his hand upon it extended.
Deinde extendat minister ossa fracta, et aequet ea medicus, donec quando coniunguntur coniunctione bona.	Then the assistant will extend the bones that are broken, and will make them equal to the surgeon; he will join them together when they are joined in a good joint.
Tunc oportet, ut ponat emplastrum et stuppam, si non accidat apostema calidum.	Then it is necessary that an ointment and a poultice be placed on it, if there does not occur a warm ecstasy.
Deinde pone astellam desuper secundum quantitatem loci: et tu iam inuoluisti eam in panno lini.	Then place the astellan from above according to the quantity of the spot; and you have already wrapped it in a linen cloth.
Si autem fractura est ad inferiora circiter uentrem plantae, tunc fac simile spherae ex panno: et praecipe infirmo, ut coartet super eam cum planta sua fracta: deinde stringatur cum panno longo.	But if the fracture is in the lower part of the hand around the joint of the thumb, then make a sphere-like form out of a cloth; and command the sick person to wrap his hand with it broken; and then tie it with a long cloth.
Et sit astella ex corio, in quo sit lenitas, ut applicetur corium cum corpore plantae: et stringe eam, secundum quod oportet.	And there should be placed an astellan of horn, whereon sits the smooth one, to be applied to the body of the hand; and tie it, according to what is necessary.
Si autem fractura est ad exteriora, tunc oportet: ut ponas astellam desuper, et astellam aliam ab inferiori in planta: et sit manus aperta recta.	But if the fracture is on the outside, then it is necessary that you place an astellan from above and another one below in the hand; and let the hand be opened straight.
Deinde pone stricturam, sicut reuoluitur manus: et extende inter digitos cum ligamento.	Then put a strap on it, as the hand is extended; and extend it between the fingers with a ligament.
Quod si accidat fractura alicui nodorum digitorum, tunc si est pollex, aequetur secundum quod oportet.	If there is a fracture in any of the joints of the fingers, then, if it is the thumb, make it equal according to what is necessary.
Deinde stringatur cum planta: et si amas, pone ei astellam rectam, paruam: ut eleuetur fractura, et non moueatur.	Then tie it with the hand; and, if you are fond of it, place an astellan on it straight, so that the fracture does not move, and does not move.
Si autem fractura est reliquis digitis, sicut medio, et indici, aut auriculari, et anulari, tunc aequetur, et ligetur cum digito sano qui sequitur eum: aut ligentur omnes secundum continuationem: et est melius.	If however the fracture is in the remaining digits, as in the middle, and index, or auricular, and annular, then it should be made equal, and tied with the healthy digit that follows it: or all should be tied according to the continuity: and it is better.
Aut pone super ipsum astellam paruam, sicut diximus in pollice.	Or put a splint on it, as we have said in the thumb.
Et considera in restauratione tua, et post ipsam dispositionem apostematis calidi: et oppone cum eo quod oportet, quando accidit aliquid ex illo, secundum quod iteratur eius narratio.	And consider in your restoration, and after it the disposition of the apposition of the heat: and oppose with it what is necessary, when anything happens from it, according to what it says goes round its narrative.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Coxae.	Regarding the restoration of a fracture of the hip
Caput XV.	Chapter XV - The head
OS Coxae multotiens frangitur, et declaratur sensui: quoniam conuertitur ad interiorem et posteriorem partem.	The pelvis often breaks, and is felt because it turns towards the inner and rear parts.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, quod stringitur ligamentum supra fracturam, et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	And its restoration is such that the ligaments above the fracture are tied, and another ligament under the fracture.
Et infirmus prostretur super faciem suam.	And the injured person will stretch out his hand on his face.
Deinde extendat omne ligamentum minister ad partem suam secundum aequalitatem: et hoc, quando est fractura in medio ossis.	Then he will extend all the ligaments to their side according to equality: and this, when there is a fracture in the middle of the bone.
Si autem est fractura propinqua radici Coxae, tunc sit ligamentum ad partem pectinis, ut cadat extensio ad sursum: et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	If however the fracture is near the root of the pelvis, then let there be a ligament to the side of the pelvis so that it falls up: and another ligament under the fracture.
Et sic similiter si est fractura propinqua genu, tunc sit ligamentum propinquum genu, ut sit extensio ad inferiora.	And in the same way if there is a fracture near the knee, then let there be a nearby ligament so that it falls down: and another ligament under the fracture.
Deinde aequet medicus os utriusque manibus suis, donec reducat ipsum secundum similitudinem figurae naturalis: et coniugatur os coniunctione bona.	Then the doctor makes the bones of both hands equal until he reduces them according to their natural shape: and joins the bones with a good union.
Tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum et stricturam, si non accidit membro apostema.	Then it should be put on plaster and tightened if that member does not get better.
Quod si accidat in eo apostema: tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur apostema calidum, deinde redi ad curationem tuam.	If there happens to be a fever on it: then you should leave it for a few days, until the heat of the fever is driven out, and then return to your cure.
Strictura autem eius ita sit.	The tightening should be such as this.
Oportet ut inuoluas super fracturam imema duram, id est, bindam: et dupla eam bis, aut ter: et remaneat ex ea superfluitas.	It is necessary that you add on the fracture a hard piece of wood, that is, a peg: and double it up twice, or three times: and leave the excess.
Deinde inuolue crus, donec perueniat calcaneus apud radicem natis.	Then wrap the wound tightly, until the heel bone has healed at the root.
Et intromitte filum longum inter Coxam et crus prope genu ad inferiora, et ueniant extremitates fili a superiori parte duarum partium.	And insert a long thread between the thigh and the leg close to the knee towards the bottom, and make the ends of the thread come from the upper part of the two parts.
Deinde reuolue super Crus et Coxam quod superfluit ex alimema.	Then bind tightly over the leg and thigh that which is in excess with the bandage.
Deinde pone super Coxam in loco fracturae ipsius astellas, et pone ex eis astellam unam super os cruris.	Then place on the thigh at the site of the fracture itself the stakes, and place one stake from them over the bone of the leg.
Deinde imple uacuitates inter crus et coxam cum pannis lenibus, ut aequetur strictura.	Then fill with waddings between the leg and the thigh with soft cloth, so that the pressure is even.
Deinde incipe cum strictura forti a medio super locum fracturae tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor.	Then begin with the strong pressure from the middle on three or four woundings at the site of the fracture.
Et quanto plus elongaris cum ligamento a loco fracturae, sit strictura tua minor et mollior, et lenior.	And as much as you increase in length with the bandage from the location of the fracture, your pressure will be smaller and softer, and gentler.
Deinde intende ad duas extremitates fili, quod tu intromisisti inter coxam et crus.	Then move towards the two ends of the thread that you inserted between thigh and leg.
Liga ergo cum utrisque tres astellas quae sunt desuper.	Bind then with each of the three stakes that are above.
Deinde uade cum duabus extremitatibus fili ad inferiora, donec peruenias ad cauillam pedis.	Then move with both ends of the thread towards the bottom, until you reach the heel of the foot.
Et cum utrisque stringe etiam extremitates astellarum a parte altera: ut non remoueatur ligamentum ex loco suo.	And also tighten both ends of the thread and the ends of the stakes from the other side: so that the bandage does not move away from its place.
Deinde dimitte stricturam super illud, dum permanet, ita quod non accidat membro corrosio, neque apostema, neque inflatio, et similia eis.	Then remove the pressure on it while it remains like that so that there is no damage to the member, nor swelling, nor inflation, and similar things.
Quod si accidat aliquid ex illo.	What if something of that sort does happen?
Propera ergo cum solutione eius, et rectifica illud quod accidit inde totum, secundum quod diximus multotiens.	Then set it aright with the bandage, and repair all of it completely, as we have often said many times.
Si uero in osse est frustum ex osse quod pungat: tunc oportet, ut aeques illud, si est tibi possibile.	But if a fragment of bone that hurts has gone into the bone: then it should be, to even out that, if you can manage it.
Et si non, finde super illud, et remoue illud: et cura cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio, donec sanetur.	And if not, place over it, and move it: and take care with that which preceded it, until it heals.
Et quandoque stringitur haec fractura Coxae, praeter quod addantur ei astellae, sicut diximus in adiutorio et brachio.	And when this fracture of the hip is tightened, except that stakes are added to it, as we have said in the leg and arm.
Verumtamen in restauratione eius taliter fracta, non accidit infirmo claudicatio.	Indeed, when he was restored in this way from a fracture, there did not occur any limping.
Et si restauratur sola, praeter quod applicetur ei crus alterum, tunc necesse est, ut claudicet ille cuius est, semper.	And if he is restored alone, besides that another leg is applied to him, then it is necessary that he always limps who has one.
Et scias, quod Coxa stringitur in quinquaginta diebus, uel additur parum, aut minuitur parum: totum illud est secundum diuersitatem complexionum, et reliquarum dispositionum.	And you know that the hip joint is strained in fifty days, or a little is added, or it is massaged a little: all of this is according to the difference of the complexion and the remaining dispositions.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Rotulae genu.	Regarding the restoration of the fracture of the rotula in the knee joint.
Caput XVI.	Chapter XVI.
Scias, quod Rotulae genu raro accidit fractura, sed accidit ei attritio multotiens.	You know that the rotula in the knee joint rarely breaks, but it often happens that it is worn out.
Si uero accidit ei fractura, tunc non nisi aut fissura, aut foramen in partibus suis.	If a fracture does indeed occur in it, then there is either a fracture, or a hole, or a cavity in its parts.
Et est illud cum uulnere, et absque uulnere.	And it is with a bone, and without a bone.
Et statur super illud totum cum sensu.	And he will stand on it entirely with his sense.
Et restauratio eius est ita, ut aequetur quod disruptum est ex partibus eius cum digitis, donec aggregetur, et coniungatur secundum quod possibile est ex aequatione et facilitate, et fabricatione.	And the restoration of it is such that it comes together what is broken from its parts with the fingers, until it comes together and joins according to what is possible from adjustment and ease, and making.
Deinde pone emplastrum ex farina sisami, uel molendini, cum albumine oui: et pone super ipsum astellam rotundam, si indiges illa: et stringe desuper strictura conueniente ad illud.	Then put an emplastre of flour sise, or of meal, with egg white: and put on it a round frame, if you can bear it: and tighten tightly to it with a suitable bandage: and wrap it up.
Deinde considera omnes dispositiones quas narrauimus in reliquis fracturis: sicut apostema calidum, et similia illi: ita, ut opponas omni accidenti cum eo quod conuenit ei, donec sanetur.	Then consider all the dispositions that we have described in the remaining fractures: such as swelling with heat, and similar to it: so that you oppose any accident with it that is suitable for it, until it heals.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Cruris.	Regarding the restoration of a fracture in the leg.
Caput XVII.	Chapter XVII.
Scias, quod Cruri sunt duo ossa, quorum unum est grossum, et nominatur nomine Cruris: et alterum subtile, et nominatur Focile.	You know that there are two bones in the leg, one of which is large and is called the femur, and the other fine and is called the fibula.
Et accidit utrisque ex speciebus fracturae quod accidit duobus ossibus brachii: et propter illud fit restauratio eius, sicut restauratio brachii aequaliter, et operatio est una.	And it happens to both of the species of fracture that occurs in the two bones of the arm: and because of this, its restoration is carried out as the equal restoration of the arm, and the operation is one.
Quod si franguntur duo ossa simul, conuertitur Crus ad omnes partes.	If two bones break at the same time, the cruciate turns to all parts.
Et si frangitur os subtilius, conuertitur Crus ad anteriorem partem.	And if a smaller bone breaks, the cruciate turns to the front part.
Et si frangitur os grossius, inuenis illud inferius: et est ex eis quae non occultantur tibi.	And if a larger bone breaks, it injures that which is below: and these are the things which do not show themselves to you.
Deinde administra extensionem, et aequationem, et ligationem astellarum secundum illud aequaliter.	Then administer the extension, and the equalization, and the binding of the joints according to that which is equal.
Verumtamen oportet, si fractura Cruris est fractura foeda, habens sethagie multa: ut sit extensio minor, et lenior alleuiatione tua.	However, if the fracture of the cruciate is a bad fracture, it has many different things: let there be less extension, and gentler alleviation for you.
Et in Crure quidem est ex operatione quiddam super brachium: et est, ut quando tu aequas astellas, et comples omnem operationem tuam, tunc accipe duas fascias ex ligno pini, quod administratur in fabricatione solariorum quod ponitur sub tabulis: et fiunt ex spatulis palmae: et elige ex eis quibus est grossitudo parua, et neque sint ex minutis: et sit longitudo earum secundum longitudinem Cruris a genu usque inferius.	And in the cruciate there is something of an operation on the arm: and it is, as when you make the joints equal, and take up all your operation, then take two strips from the wood of pine, which are administered in the making of the sole which is placed under the tables: and they are made of palm leaves: and choose from them which have a small thickness, and there be not any from the minute ones: and may their length be according to the length of the cruciate from the knee down:
Deinde inuolue super unamquamque pannum duabus inuolutionibus secundum longitudinem eius.	Then wrap around on one piece of cloth with two wraps according to its length.
Et pone unam partem Cruris a parte una, et alteram a parte altera: et sint ex genu usque inferius pedis.	And place one end of the cruciate from one side, and the other from the other side: and let them be from the knee down to the foot.
Deinde liga duas fascias in tribus locis ex duabus extremitatibus et medio.	Then bind the two strips in three places from the two ends and from the middle.
Cum enim strictura prohibetur, Crus declinat ad dextram et sinistram, et stat statione bona.	For when the tightening is finished, the cruciate leans to the right and to the left, and stands in good position.
Et iam quidem administretur cunabulum ex ligno secundum longitudinem Cruris, et ponatur in eo Crus, ut conseruet ipsum a motu.	And now let the strip of wood be administered according to the length of the cruciate, and let it be placed in it, that he may preserve itself from movement.
Et plurimum quidem oportet, ut facias illud in fractura quando cum ea est uulnus proprie.	And much more is necessary, so that you do this to the fracture when it is a true injury.
Deinde considera Crus in omni die, et stude cum eo studio ultimo ab apostemate, aut inflatione, aut reliquis aliis.	Then consider the cruciate every day, and strive with it with the utmost effort from inflammation, or swelling, or any other thing.
Si ergo accidit aliquid ex illis, tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur, si Deus uoluerit.	But if anything of these happens, then oppose it with him that which is necessary, until he is healed, if God will.
De fractura ossium Pedis, et Digitorum.	Of the fracture of the bones of the foot and fingers.
Caput XVIII.	The head of Chapter XVIII.
Calcaneo quidem non accidit fractura penitus.	That is not a fracture of the calcaneum, but of the tibiae and fibulae.
Ossibus uero Pedis accidit quandoque fractura, et Digitis parum etiam accidit fractura: et non accidit eis nisi attritio in pluribus dispositionibus.	But of the bones of the foot does not happen when there is a fracture, and of the fingers little too; but does not happen to them unless there be a wear in many places.
Quod si accidit ossibus Pedis fractura, et uides illa ossa sublimari super se adinuicem, tunc ponat infirmus Pedem suum super terram praeparatam, sicut ambulans.	That if there is a fracture of the bones of the foot, and he sees those bones sliding one over another, then let him put his sick foot on the ground prepared, like one who walks.
Deinde sta tu, et pone Pedem tuum super illud quod eleuatur ex illis ossibus: postea preme, uel calca eam: et aequa ipsam, donec redeat in locis suis.	Then stand you, and put your foot on that which rises out of those bones; then press it, or trample thereon: and make it even, until it comes back into its place.
Deinde pone emplastrum, et stuppam desuper: et pone sub uentre Pedis tabulam paruam, cui sint duo capita plana.	Then put a patch, and stamp it down; and put under the foot a thin board, which hath two flat heads.
Deinde stringe eam cum Pede strictura decenti, postquam tu inuoluis eam cum pannis, et reliquis quibus indiget.	Then bind it with a tight strap, going down with the foot, after you have wrapped it up with rags, and with those wherewith it needs to be bound.
Cum ergo praetereunt ei tres dies, aut quatuor, tunc solue ligamentum.	When then shall you loosen the ligaments: for after three or four days, then shall you loosen the ligatures.
Nam tu inuenies ossa aequata, siue sint fracta, aut sint dislocata.	For thou shalt find bones that are even; or if they be fractured, or dislocated.
Operatio ergo in eis est, sicut uides.	The operation then is, as you see it.
Si autem franguntur aliqui digiti, tunc restaura eos, et aequa ipsos secundum quod narraui tibi in restauratione digitorum manus.	If any of the fingers be broken, then restore them, and make them even, according to that which thou hast told me in the restoration of the fingers of the hand.
Deinde pone digito tuo astellam secundum longitudinem digiti, et sit latior eo parumper: deinde pone sub Pede hanc tabulam quam narraui tibi, et stringe eam strictura decenti.	Then put your finger on a board according to the length of the finger; and make it a little broader; then put under the foot the same board which thou hast told me, and bind it with a tight strap.
Si uero quod frangitur ex ossibus est duo, aut tria, aut plus, tunc pone super omnem digitum astellam suae quantitatis, inuolutam in panno lini: et stringe tabulam in inferiori Pedis: et sit stans super unum capitum tabulae extra uentrem Pedis, ut teneat retentione bona.	If indeed the bone which is broken be two, or three, or more, then put upon every finger a band of its own quantity, wrapped up in a linen cloth; and bind the board in the lower part of the foot, and stand on one head of the board under the foot, that it may hold by good retention.
Et conuenit tibi, ut non obliuiscaris, quin consideres omnia quae dixi tibi in reliquis fracturis ex accidentibus quae diximus: et oppone omni accidenti cum eo quod oportet.	It is necessary for you not to forget, but to consider everything that I have told you about the remaining fractures from the accidents which we have mentioned: and oppose every accident with what is necessary.
¶ De fractura Vuluae mulieris, et ossis pectinis, et uirgae uiri.	About the fracture of the vulva of a woman, and of the pelvic bone and of the uterus of man.
Caput XIX.	Chapter XIX.
Quando frangitur Vulua mulieris, tunc fac eam sedere quadratam.	When a woman's vulva is fractured, then make her sit square.
Deinde inclina eam ad partem dorsi ipsius parumper, et teneatur retro.	Then tilt her slightly towards the back of her own body, and hold her from behind.
Deinde impleat obstetrix Vuluam eius coto, donec impleat eam: et fiat in Vulua ex eo sicut sphera.	Then the midwife shall fill the woman' vulva with cotton, until she is filled: and let it be made in the woman' vulva like a sphere.
Deinde concutiatur mulier, et eleua dorsum eius paulatim.	Then the woman shall be struck, and her back shall be gently raised.
Illud enim cotum egreditur, donec fiat ante portam Vuluae sicut sphera, et os fractum redit.	For that cotton will exit, until it lies before the entrance to the woman' vulva like a sphere, and the broken jaw returns.
Deinde pone puluillum super dorsum eius.	Then place a little ball on her back.
Quando ergo uult mingere, remoueat cotum cum facilitate, deinde mingat: et reduc ipsum secundum modum, quo intromisisti ipsum in primis: deinde redeat ad puluillum suum primum.	When she then wishes to urinate, let the cotton move easily, and then let her urinate: and reduce it according to the mode in which you inserted it at first: and then let it return to her own little ball.
Faciat illud septem diebus, aut circiter, os ipsum enim restauratur.	Let that be done for seven days, or about, because the jaw itself is restored.
Et si uis, accipe uesicam ouis, et stringe super foramen eius cannulam arundinis, et intromitte uesicam totam in Vuluam eius.	And if you wish, take a narrow twig, and tie it around the hole with a cane, and insert the whole twig into the woman' vulva.
Deinde suffla in cannulam cum uirtute, donec infletur uesica intra Vuluam, fractura enim redit.	Then blow into the cane with force, until the snot bends inside the vulva, for the fracture returns.
Deinde impleatur cum coto, et stet aliquot diebus, secundum quod narrauimus, donec sanetur.	Then fill it with cotton, and let it stand for a few days, according to what we have said, until it is healed.
Et quando frangitur os Pectinis uiri, aut mulieris, tunc administra in restauratione eius, et ipsius aequatione illud quod narrauimus in osse Anchae.	And when the pelvic bone of man or woman is fractured, then administer to its restoration, and to its adjustment that which we have described concerning the bone of Ankylosis.
Et non occultatur rectum in his fracturis propinquis, quae parum contingunt, praecipue cui est quiddam studii, uel usus.	And do not conceal the right eye in these adjacent fractures, which are few, especially if it is for some study, or usage.
Et intellige librum meum istum multum, quoniam fractura ipsa significat tibi in pluribus dispositionibus uiam rectam in restauratione sui, et strictura sui: intellige ergo.	Understand my book well, for it reveals to you many things that mean much to you when it comes to healing yourself and restoring your health and well-being; so understand this.
In Virga autem uiri quando frangitur, accipe guttur anseris: et intromitte uirgam in ipso.	When the penis is broken, take the throat of a goose; and insert the penis into it.
Deinde pone super ipsum inuolutionem ex panno, et inuoluatur, et dimittatur tribus diebus, aut circiter eos, et sanabitur, si Deus uoluerit.	Then put on top of it a bandage, and wrap it up, and leave it for three days, or a little longer; and he will be healed, if God wills it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae ossium, quando est cum uulnere.	For the restoration of broken bones, when they are joined with a splint.
Caput XX.	Chapter XX.
Conuenit ei cui accidit fractura cum uulnere, praecipue si est magnum, sicut os coxae, aut adiutorii, aut simile illi, ut properes, et phlebotomes ipsum statim: si attestantur tibi conditiones phlebotomiae, sicut praemisimus.	It is fitting that he who has suffered a fracture, especially if it is a large one, such as the hipbone or other bones that support the body, should be cauterized without delay: if you have the means to cauterize him, as we have mentioned.
Quod si uulnus effluit sanguinem, tunc oportet, ut properes ad abscisionem eius, ita ut puluerizes super ipsum zegi tritum: si non est tibi praesens aliud.	If the bone bleeds, then you should cut it, as we have said, so that the dust of it lies on top: if you do not have another at hand.
Deinde incipe restaurare fracturam in illo eodem die: et non postponas illud, si non accidit apostema.	Then begin to restore the fracture on the same day: and do not put off doing so, unless a swelling occurs.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte restaurationem eius usque ad diem nonum, donec sedetur apostema.	But if a swelling becomes warm, then put off the restoration until the ninth day, until the swelling subsides.
Et non appropinques ei in die tertio, et quarto omnino, nam tu faceres ei accidere accidentia mala.	And do not approach him on the third and fourth days at all, for you would bring him bad accidents.
Si autem os fractum est eminens super cutem detectum: tunc oportet, ut coneris reducere ipsum, et aequare ipsum manibus tuis cum facilitate et extensione parua.	But if a bone that is broken is prominent above the skin: then you should seek to reduce it and make it even with your hands, with ease and a small extension.
Si autem non praeparatur extensio eius, et ipsius aequatio manibus tuis: tunc reduc ipsum cum isto instrumento.	But if it is not prepared for extension and for making it even with your hands: then reduce it with a stick.
Et est instrumentum quod fit ex ferro, cuius longitudo est quantitas septem digitorum, aut octo: et eius latitudo est secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And this is an instrument made of iron, the length of which is seven or eight fingers' breadth: and its width is according to the quantity of the wound.
Et propter illud necesse est medico, ut accipiat ex eis tria, aut quatuor secundum quantitatem qua indiget ad illud ex curatione in omni specie fracturae.	And for this a physician must take three or four, according to the quantity that he needs for the cure of any kind of fracture.
Et sit rotundum: et sit in eo grossitudo parua, ut non duplicetur apud compressionem super ipsum in hora operationis: et sit acutae extremitatis, cui sit margo in extremitatibus suis.	And let it be round: and let there be little grossness therein, lest it should double itself by compression upon itself at the hour of operation: and let the acute extremity be, to which let there be a margin in its extremities.
Et sit superius eius ad grossitudinem ex medietate eius usque ad inferiora.	And let it be above it in bulk from its middle to its lower part.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its shape.
Oportet in Hac Operatione, ut ponatur extremitas eius acuta curuata super extremitatem ossis eminentis: et impelle ipsum cum eo uice una, donec quando redit os et aequatur quadam aequatione.	It is necessary in this operation that the extremity of it be turned inwards upon the extremity of the prominent bone: and press it with one force together with it until when the bone returns and comes to some degree of equability.
Conare ergo aequare extremitates fracturae adinuicem.	Take heed therefore to make the extremities of the fracture face inwardly in opposition.
Quod si extremitates eius fracta est subtilis, et non accipit eam instrumentum accaeptione bona, tunc opotet, ut incidas extremitatem illius ossis, donec instrumentum potestatem habeat eius.	If then the extremities of its fracture are thin, and does not take it well with the instrument, then let him strike the extremity of its bone, until the instrument can have power over it.
Si uero non potes reducere eos cum eo quod narrauimus omnino, tunc incide ipsum cum eo quod conuenit ei ex Incisoriis quae diximus: aut serra ipsum cum una serrarum quocunque modo possibile est tibi.	If then you cannot reduce them in any way with what we have said above, then strike it with him from the incisions which we have spoken of: or saw it with one saw of whatever kind you can get to yourself.
Deinde rade illud quod remanet in osse ex asperitate et corticibus minutis.	Then rub off what remains in the bone of the roughness and small bark.
Cum ergo reducitur os, et inuenit infirmus post reductionem eius dolorem uehementem laedentem, tunc scias, quod os non rediit ad locum suum naturalem.	When therefore the bone is reduced, and finds after its reduction a painful and lameness afflicting it, then know that the bone has not returned to its place.
Fac ergo illud.	Do then this.
Nam tu confers infirmo iuuamentum magnum, cum completur restauratio tua quam facis ossi.	For you confer a great advantage of being able to walk by restoring the bone which you make.
Tunc submerge pannum in uino stiptico, nigro.	Then immerse the cloth in black vinegar.
Et proprie si est in aestate.	And especially if it is in summer.
Et non ponas super uulnus caerotum, neque aliquid in quo sit oleum: ut non faciat accidere in ipso putredinem et corruptionem.	And do not place on the bone of the caesar, or anything in which there is oil: lest it should come to pass that corruption and decay take place therein.
Deinde administra astellas in hora complementi tui a restauratione ossis.	Then administer the herbs in the hour of your completion from the restoration of the bone.
Et dimitte uulnus detectum: ita, ut incidas cum forficibus foramen in inuolutionibus secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And let fall the bandage: that you may strike with the forceps a hole in the second cavity after the quantity of the wound.
Et caue omni cautela, ne stringas uulnus cum fractura.	And with all caution, do not tie a tendon with a fracture.
Multotiens enim fecerunt istud stolidi medici: et fecerunt accidere super infirmos suos aut mortem, aut corrosionem, aut zuchem, id est, saniem.	For many times the foolish physicians have done this: and they have caused to happen to their patients, or death, or corruption, or rot, that is, disease.
Et sit strictura tua mollis, lenis, diuersa stricturae fracturarum reliquarum.	And your tension be soft, gentle, diverse from the tension of the other broken fractures.
Quod si uulnus est malum, aut est uulnus magnum, et times super ipsum quaedam accidentia mala quae narrauimus, et inuenis dolorem in loco suspensum: tunc non oportet, ut ponas super ipsum astellas.	That if a tendon is bad, or is a large tendon, and you wait for some bad accident which we have described, and suspend pain in the place: then it is not right that you should put stars on the tendon.
Et fac eis inuolutiones ex pannis duris in loco astellarum, et stringe ipsum cum eis.	And make them in solução from hard leather in the place of the stars, and tie the tendon with them.
Cum autem est post diem unum, aut dies duos, et uides uulnus iam incipere, ut in eo generetur pus: tunc aufer desuper ipsum pannum quem posuisti super ipsum cum uino.	But when it is after one day, or two days, and you see the tendon beginning to grow puss, then take away from on top of the tendon the leather which you put under it with a knot.
Deinde administra licinia, et unguenta cum quibus de consuetudine nostra est, ut medicemur uulnera: sicut unguentum tetrapharmacon, et similia illi.	Then apply vinegar, and the oils with which we are accustomed to treat wounds: such as the oil of four medicines, and similar.
Et conuenit tibi, ut soluas ligamentum.	And it comes to you, that you should loosen the ligaments.
Et considera uulnus in omni die mane et uespere, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	And consider the tendon every day, morning and evening, until it is healed, and has healed.
Et oportet, ut praeparetur membrum taliter, ut currat ex eo pus ad inferiora cum facilitate.	And it is necessary that the member be prepared so, that pus might come out of it easily to the lower parts.
Quod si praetereunt uulneri dies multi, et non consolidatur, neque abscinditur pus ab eo: tunc scias, quod illic sunt satagie ossis parua.	That if there pass many days of the wounds and are not healed, nor does pus come away from them: then you should know that there are little bones in it.
Quare oportet, ut inquiras uulnus cum tenta.	Why it is necessary that you should inquire about the tendon with a touch.
Quot uero ex illis alsatagie sunt separata, remoue ea, et extrahe ipsa.	How many of those little bones are separated, take them away, and pull them out.
Et quae ex eis sunt non separata, et pungunt membrum, et faciunt accidere dolorem, conare incidere ea, et auferre ea omni modo quo possibile est tibi illud.	And which of those little bones are not separated, and sting the member, and cause pain, strike it, and take them away in any way that you can do to that for you.
Quod si accidat uulneri zuchen, aut ekileten, id est, estiomenus, aut species alia corruptionis et putrefactionis: tunc oportet, ut opponas unicuique ex eis cum eo quod conuenit ei ex curatione, cuius praecessit narratio in capitulo suo.	That if an accident happens to the tendon, or ekileten, that is, it becomes stiff, or another species of corruption and putrefaction: then you should oppose each one with him who is charged with its cure, whose previous narration is in his chapter.
Et ex eo in quo oportet ut stet sermo meus, et cui facias praesentem mentem tuam quando frangitur os, et eminet super membrum, sicut os coxae, et adiutorii, et similia eis ex membris magnis, est, ut non praesumas attractionem eius, multotiens enim accidit ex illo mors, imo dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat.	And from this, in which it is necessary that my speech stand, and which you should bring to mind when the bone breaks, and emerges over the limb, like the hip bone, and assistants, and the like from large limbs, that is, so as not to suspect attraction from it, for many times death has occurred from it, besides, you should leave it, until it decays.
Fortasse enim cadet per se post uiginti dies, aut triginta.	For perhaps after 20 days, or 30, it will fall by itself.
Tunc ergo cura uulnus, si uidetur tibi: et sinon, dimitte ipsum.	Then therefore take care of the wound if it remains with you; otherwise, leave it alone.
¶ De curatione Nodationis in uestigio fracturae.	On the treatment of a nodule in the socket of a fracture.
Caput XXI.	Chapter 21.
Multoties accidit haec Nodatio in uestigio sanationis fracturae.	Many times this Nodulation has occurred in the socket of the treatment of a fracture.
Praecipue, quae est prope iuncturas: et foedatur ex ea figura membri.	Especially, which is near joints: and nourishes from it the form of the limb.
Et fortasse prohibet membrum ab operatione sua naturali.	And perhaps forbids the limb from its natural action.
Considera ergo tunc, si nodatio est recens: administra in ea medicinas quae stipticitatem habent, sicut aloe, et olibanum, et myrrha, et sarcocolla, et acacia, et similia eis.	Then consider, if the Nodulation is recent: administer to it medicines which have a straitening effect, such as aloe, and olive oil, and Myrrh, and wood-ash, and acacia, and similar things.
Ita, ut accipias ex istis quasdam, aut omnes eas: et confice eas cum uino stiptico, aut cum albumine oui, aut cum aceto: et pone eas super nodationem in stuppa, et stringe eas super ipsam strictura bona.	So, that you take from these certain ones, or all of them: and bind them with a stifling substance, such as an infusion of aloe, or an infusion of albumin, or vinegar; and place them over the Nodulation in a box, and fasten them securely with the good binding.
Et dimitte stricturam, nec soluas eam diebus multis.	And leave the straitening, and do not remove it for many days.
Deinde solue eam, et itera aliam, donec remoueatur nodatio.	Then remove it, and repeat another, until the Nodulation has disappeared.
Aut stringe super ipsam laminam plumbi decenter.	Or bind over it a strip of lead, bent at one end.
Plumbo enim est proprietas remouendi omne quod timetur ex membris.	For lead is a property to remove anything feared from the limb.
Si autem nodatio iam in lapidem conuersa est, et stricta est, et festine prouocat necessitas ad auferendum eam: tunc finde super eam ex superiori parte eius, et incide superfluitatem eminentem: aut rade eam cum quibusdam rasoriis, donec remoueatur: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	But if the Nodulation has already become attached to a stone, and is stiff, and there is an urgent need to remove it: then find on top of it a sharp edge, and cut off the excess: or saw it off with some kind of saw, until it has gone: and take care of it, until it has healed.
¶ De curatione quando restauratur, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, non secundum naturam suam.	When cure is effected and the member remains after it, not in accordance with its own nature.
Caput XXII.	Title 22. On healing the patient when care is
Quando restauratur fractura ossis, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, debile: tunc non fit illud nisi propter caussas multas.	When a bone fracture is healed and the member remains after it, feeble: then this does not occur except for many causes.
Quarum una est, multitudo solutionis ligamenti et ligationis eius non secundum quod oportet: aut propter superfluitatem stricturae ligamentorum, donec prohibeatur nutrimentum currere ad membrum: aut propter multitudinem embrocationis superfluae in non sua hora: aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore infirmi, et debilitatem eius.	Of which one is, the multitude of the lacing and the lacing not being according to what should be: or because of the excess of the lacing, until the food runs to the member: or because of the excess of the ointment at an unfair time: or because of the lack of blood in the body, and its weakness.
Et curatio illius est, cibare infirmum, et tenerum facere corpus eius, donec multiplicetur sanguis in eo.	And the healing of it is, to feed the sick, and make the body of him light, until there is an increase of blood in it.
Et administra balneum.	And give a bath.
Et intromitte gaudium et laeticiam super eum.	And introduce joy and happiness to it.
Deinde pone picem super membrum: ut attrahat pix ad ipsum nutrimentum multum.	Then put a wedge on the member: so that it attracts the food towards itself in great quantity.
Et assiduet embrocationem eius cum aqua tepida, donec currat nutrimentum, et redeat ad figuram suam naturalem.	And make his ointment with warm water, until he runs the food, and returns to his own nature.
¶ De curatione ossium fractorum quando restaurantur tortuose.	On healing broken bones when they have curved.
Caput XXIII.	Title 23. On healing twisted bones.
Quando accidit membro iam restaurato post sanationem eius tortuositas, et eminentia ossi fracto, aut nodatio: et foedatur per illud forma membri, uerumtamen membrum non prohibetur ab operatione sua naturali: tunc non oportet ut recipias sermonem eius, qui existimat, ut frangatur membrum denuo.	When it happens that a member which has been healed after its twistedness and the prominence of the bone-fracture, or the nodule: and it is fed through that form of the member, however, the member should not be prevented from its natural function: then you should not take its speech which exists, that it should be broken again.
Et iam fuerunt multi stolidorum medicorum et restauratorum, qui fecerunt illud in terra nostra.	And there have also been many foolish doctors and healers who did this in our land.
Et haec quidem operatio est uituperabilis ualde, perducens ad mortem, uel timorem magnum, ut scilicet sit mortalis.	This operation is very dangerous, leading to death, or a great fear, as if it were mortal.
Verum si claudicatio et nodatio sunt recentes: tunc oportet, ut embrocetur cum aqua tepida, in qua decoctae sint herbae mollificantes, sicut folia alteae, et radix eius, et mellilotum, et illis similia.	But if the claudication and nodding are recent: then it should be ointment with warm water, in which have been boiled softening herbs, such as the leaves of althaea, and its root, and meitolium, and similar things.
Et fiat ei emplastrum cum emplastro mollificatiuo, sicut dyachilon decenter factum.	And let him make a plaster with soft plaster, as with a decayer made from dyachilons.
Aut sumatur mucilago radicis alteae, et concutiatur cum adipe gallinae, aut oleo sisamino: et emplastretur cum eo.	Or take mucilage of the roots of althaea and mix it with chicken fat or oil of sesamum; and plaster him with it.
Aut sumantur ficus pingues, et terantur cum fimo columbino, et similibus eis quae nominantur ex medicinis diminuentes consolidationem.	Or take young fig tree branches and knead them with clay of columba, and like these that are called medicines which decrease the consolidation.
Et quandoque soluitur nodatio cum fricatione assidua, antiqua, et leni, quae fit cum manibus humidis.	And when the setting has been dissolved by careful, old, and gentle friction, which is done with wet hands.
Et administretur motus membri ad omnem partem in horis omnibus.	And let him move his limbs in every direction during all hours.
Si autem tortuositas iam antecessit, et fortis facta est, et conuersa est in lapidem, et prouocata est necessitas ad curatonem eius cum ferro: tunc oportet, ut secetur superius eius, et soluatur continuatio ossis, et incidatur quod superfluit ex nodatione aut osse cum Incisoriis subtilibus: et administretur facilitas in illo cum sollicitudine et studio.	If however the tortuosity has already preceded and is strong, and has come to rest on a stone, and prompts a need for its cure with an iron: then it should be cut off above the bone, and the continuance of the bone should be solved, and what is superfluous from the setting should be cut away with very small chisels: and ease should be given to him with care and diligence.
¶ De sermone in Dislocatione.	On the subject of dislocation.
Caput XXIIII.	Head 24.
Dislocatio est exitus alicuius iuncturarum a loco suo.	Dislocation is the exit of a joint from its place.
Quare prohibetur a motu suo, et foedatur figura membri.	Why does it restrain itself from its own movement, and is fixed in form.
Et facit accidere super infirmum dolores, et laesiones uehementes.	And causes great pain to the weak and painful injuries.
Quando ergo accidit alicui dislocatio, tunc oportet festinare ad restaurationem eius: neque tardet eam omnino.	When therefore a dislocation happens, then let him hurry to restore it: he should not delay it in any way.
Nam si tardatur, apostematur locus, et fortasse cum eo reductio dislocationis.	For if he is delayed, the place will become stiff, and with it may come a reduction of the dislocation.
Propter illud ergo non oportet, ut moueatur, neque extendatur in hora apostemationis eius.	Therefore, it should not be moved, nor be extended in the time of its stiffening.
Quoniam multotiens facit accidere spasmum, et dolores laedentes.	For it often causes a spasm to occur, and painful injuries.
Verum quando accidit illud, tunc oportet, ut properes ad phlebotomiam infirmi.	But when that happens, then let him prepare for the bloodletting.
Deinde dimittatur, donec quiescat apostema.	Then dismiss it, until it quiets down with the stiffness.
Deinde embrocetur membrum cum aqua calida et oleo.	Then the member is kneaded with warm water and oil.
Deinde reducatur cum facilitate.	Then reduce it with ease.
Et curetur omne membrum cum eo cuius rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And heal all members with it, when the memory of the remedy comes to its place.
Ego quidem iam ordinaui capitula dislocationis, etiam secundum quod praecessit in fractura, a superiori parte corporis usque ad inferiorem eius.	I have already arranged the chapters on dislocations and also on fractures, from the upper part of the body to the lower.
¶ De cura dislocationis Mandibulae inferioris.	On the treatment of a dislocated jaw (lower).
Caput XXV.	Chapter XXV.
Parum dislocantur duae Mandibulae nisi raro.	The two jaws are rarely dislocated.
Et dislocatio ambarum fit secundum unum duoru modorum.	And the dislocation of the jaw occurs in only one of two ways.
Aut enim remouentur a locis suis remotione parua, et mollificantur parumper.	Or they are removed from their places by a small distance, and are slightly softened.
Aut dislocantur dislocatione integra, completa, donec mollificentur ad partem pectoris, donec currat saliua infirmi, et non possit tenere eam, neque possit claudere os suum, et inuoluatur lingua eius cum sermone.	Or they are dislocated completely and intact, until they are softened towards the breast, until the saliva of the wound runs away, and he is not able to keep it shut, nor can he close his mouth, and his tongue hangs out with a gurgling sound.
Quando autem dislocatio eius est parua, tunc redit in pluribus dispositionibus per se cum paucitate.	When the dislocation of this is small, then it returns to its place by itself with a little difficulty.
Si uero est dislocatio completa, integra: tunc oportet, ut administretur reductio eius uelociter, et non tardetur penitus: et est, ut teneat minister caput infirmi: et intromittat medicus pollicem manus suae unius in radicem Mandibulae dislocationis inter os eius, si dislocatio est a parte una.	If the dislocation is complete and intact: then it should be administered to reduce it quickly, and there should be no delay: and it is as if the doctor holds the jaw with his thumb at the base of the dislocation between his teeth, if the dislocation is from one side only.
Aut intromittat duos pollices suos simul, si dislocatio est a duabus partibus.	Or introduce two thumbs simultaneously, if the dislocation is from both sides.
Et reliqui digiti manuum eius sint extra, quibus aequet.	And the remaining fingers of his hand are outside, with which he equalizes it.
Et praecipe infirmo, ut mundificet Mandibulas suas, et absoluat eas ad manducandum ad omnem partem.	And order the sick person to clean his jaws, and allow them to chew on all sides.
Et medicus aequet Mandibulam, et impellat Mandibulam, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And the doctor equalizes the jaw and pushes it back into place.
Quod si difficilis sit reductio eius, praecipue si sunt ambae Mandibulae simul: tunc administra uaporationem cum aqua calida, et oleo, donec fiat facilis reductio ambarum: neque tardes reductionem ambarum omnino, sicut diximus.	If reducing it is difficult, especially if both jaws are involved: then administer a vapour with hot water and oil until the reduction becomes easy: do not delay reducing the jaws at all, as we have said.
Cum ergo redeunt et aequantur, et clauditur os infirmi, et non mollificantur: tunc pone super eas puluillos pannorum, cum ceroto quod sit factum ex cera: et oleo rosato.	When they are closed and equalized, and the mouth is shut, and they do not soften: then place a few cotton pads over them, with a patch made of wax: and rub it with rose oil.
Deinde ligetur cum facilitate cum ligamentis mollibus.	Then bind it with ease using soft ligaments.
Et sit somnus infirmi super dorsum suum: et caput eius sit stans inter duo puluinaria, ut non moueat ipsum ad dextram et sinistram: neque conetur, uel cogatur masticare aliquid: imo ponatur cibus eius sorbitio lenis, donec quando remouentur dolores, et nodatur Mandibula: tunc comedat quod uult, et administretur illud cum facilitate.	Then let him sleep with ease on his back; and let his head rest between two pillows so that he does not move to the right or left: nor let him chew anything; but let his food be soft, until such time as the pains ease, and let the jaws be loosed: then let him eat what he wants, and give it to him easily.
Non laboret super operationem oris sui apud comestionem et potum, et oscitationem, donec nodetur Mandibula, et sanetur.	Do not cause pain during the surgery on his mouth or when drinking or swallowing, until such time as the jaws are loosed, and he is healed.
Quod si difficilis fiat reductio duarum Mandibuiarum, quando dislocantur in hora aliqua, et non conuertuntur ad loca sua: tunc multotiens accidunt inde febres, et soda assidua: et fortasse soluitur uenter infirmi, et fortasse uomit choleram puram.	If it is difficult to reduce the two jaws when they are dislocated at some time and do not return to their places: then often fever and sodium result from this; and perhaps the stomach becomes weak, and perhaps pure choler is discharged.
Cum ergo uides illud: tunc scias, quia est perditio, et multotiens moritur ille cui accidit illud in decem diebus.	So when you see this: then know that it is a loss, and he often dies who experiences this in ten days.
¶ De reducione dislocationis Furculae, et extremitatis humeri.	Regarding the reduction of a dislocated femur and shoulder blade.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter 26: Head.
Furcula quidem non dislocatur ex latere intrinseco, propter continuationem suam cum pectore.	The furcata (shoulder blade) does not dislocate from the inside due to its connection with the chest.
Et dislocatur quandoque ad exteriora: et declaratur illud sensui.	And it dislocations when it is pushed outward: and gives a sense of pain.
Et restauratio eius est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat brachia sua.	And its restoration is so that he lies sick on his back, and extends his arms.
Deinde coarta locum cum palma tua coartatione forti, nam ipsa redibit.	Then, with a strong grasp of your hand, bind the place, for it will return to its place.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stringe eam.	Then place a cloth on top, and hairs, and tighten it.
Extremitates uero eius quae sequuntur cubitum, et continuantur cum eo, non dislocantur, nisi raro.	The extremities that follow the bed, and continue with him, do not dislocate unless they are rarely pushed.
Quod si dislocatur die aliquo: tunc oportet, ut reducatur et aequetur secundum quod diximus, et quod praeparatur tibi.	If it dislocations on a certain day: then it should be reduced and made even as we have said, and you should be prepared.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam.	Then place a cloth on top, and tighten it.
Et praecipe infirmo, adhaerere tranquillitati et quieti, donec sanetur.	He should instruct the sick person to adhere to rest and tranquility until they recover.
Et cum hac eadem curatione reducitur extremitas Humeri, quando separatur etiam a loco suo.	And with this same cure, when the extremity of the humerus is reduced, it should also be separated from its place.
¶ De reductione dislocationis Humeri.	De reductione dislocationis Humeri.
Caput XXVII.	Caput XXVII.
Scias, quod Humerus non dislocatur, nisi secundum tres modos.	You should know that the humerus does not dislocate except by three means.
Quorum unus est, ut dislocetur ad partem titillici ad inferiora.	Of which one is such that it dislocates to the tickling side toward the lower part.
Secundus est, ut dislocetur ad partem pectoris.	Of which second is such that it dislocates to the part of the chest.
Et fortasse dislocatur ad superiorem partem Humeri: et illud fit raro.	And perhaps it dislocates to the upper part of the humerus: and this happens rarely.
Et non dislocatur ad posteriora, propter spatulam.	And does not dislocate toward the back, because of the spatula.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora, propter neruos.	And does not dislocate toward the front, because of the nerves.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur et egreditur ad inferiora uersus titillicum: praecipue in illis, quorum carnes sunt paucae.	And indeed it most frequently dislocates and exits to the lower side toward the tickling: mainly in those who have thin flesh.
Quoniam egrediur in eis uelociter, et ingreditur uelociter.	Since it exits them quickly, and enters them quickly.
In illis autem quorum carnes sunt multae, est econtrario illius, scilicet quia egreditur cum difficultate, et ingreditur cum difficultate.	But in those whom the flesh is abundant, it is the opposite; that is, because it exits them with difficulty, and enters them with difficulty.
Et fortasse accidit quibusdam hominibus percussio, aut casus, et apostematur Humerus apostemate calido, et putatur propter illud, quia iam dislocatus est.	And perhaps in some people there is a blow, or a fall, and the humerus is dislocated from the warm; and it is thought because of that, since it has already been dislocated.
Oportet ergo, ut experiaris illud, donec stes super certitudinem eius, et tunc procedas in curatione eius.	It should therefore be such that you experience this, until you are certain about its state, and then proceed with its treatment.
Et cognoscitur dislocatio, quando est ad inferiora uersus titillicum: et distinguas inter Humerum dislocatum, et humerum sanum.	And the dislocation is recognized when it is toward the lower side toward the tickling: and you distinguish between a dislocated humerus and a healthy one.
Nam tu inuenis inter eos diuersitatem manifestam, et inuenis in capite Humeri concauitatem, et sub titillico apud tactum caput humeri quasi ipsum sit ouum: et non potest infirmus reducere manum ad aurem suam, neque mouere eam omnibus motibus.	For there is a great difference between them; and in the head of the humerus there is a concavity, and under the tickling at the touch of the head of the humerus it seems to be the same as itself: and the sick person cannot bring his hand to his ear, nor move it in all its movements.
Et similiter, si dislocatur uersus pectus, aut ad sursum: tunc inuenis manifestum tactum, neque occultatur.	And likewise, if dislocated towards the breast, or upward: then the injury is evident to the touch, and is not hidden.
Et huius quidem dislocationis fit facilis reductio, quando est recens, aut infirmus est puer.	And of this dislocation it is easy to reduce when it is recent, or when the boy is weak.
Et reductio eius est, ut eleuet minister manum suam ad superiora.	And its reduction is, that he should lift his own hand towards the top.
Deinde pone tu pollices tuos sub titillico eius, et eleua iuncturam cum fortitudine ad sursum ad locum suum: et minister eleuet manum suam, et extendat eam ad sursum.	Then put your fingers under his nipple, and with force raise the joint up to its place: and the attendant should lift his hand, and extend it upward.
Deinde ponat eam inferius, ipse enim redit uelociter.	Then let him put it down, for himself he will quickly return.
Si autem non redit per illud quod diximus, et sunt a principio quo accidit dislocatio dies multi: tunc oportet, ut balneetur infirmus in aqua calida, et administretur embrocatio quae mollificat et lenit, sicut si decoquantur radices alteae, et foenugraecum, et mellilotum in aqua, et administretur.	But if he does not return by that which we have said, and there are many days from the time of the dislocation: then it should be, that the sick person bathes in warm water, and an emollient is administered which softens and soothes, such as if roots of aloe, and foenugraecum, and mellilotum were boiled in water, and administered.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et ponatur sub titillico eius sphera et lana, quae sit aequalis inter lenitatem et stricturam.	Then the sick person should lie on his back: and let there be placed under his nipple a sphere and wool, which is equal to the tenderness and the constriction.
Deinde ponat medicus calcaneum suum super spheram, et eleuet caput humeri cum uirtute, et attrahat manum infirmi ad inferiora.	Then the doctor should place his heel over the sphere, and with force should draw the shoulder-blade downward, and should lift the attendant's hand towards the bottom.
Et minister alius teneat caput infirmi, ut non moueatur ad inferiora: ipse namque redit statim.	And another attendant should hold the shoulder so that it does not move downward: for he will immediately return to its place.
Et si uis, reduc eum secundum modum hunc: et est, ut facias esse praesentem uirum qui sit longior infirmo, et stet a parte lateris, et intromittat humerum suum sub titillico infirmi: et eleuet titillicum eius ad superiora, donec sit infirmus suspensus in aere.	And if you wish, reduce it according to this method: and it is so, that the present male who is longer should stand by the side, and introduce his shoulder under the nipple of the attendant: and lift the nipple of him upward, until the sick person hangs suspended in the air.
Et minister alius trahat manum infirmi ad inferiora uentris eius.	Then another attendant should hold the attendant' hand downward.
Si autem infirmus est leuis: tunc oportet, ut suspendatur cum eo aliquid aliud, ut grauet ipsum: nam redit dislocatio statim.	But if the sick person is light: then it should be, that he be suspended with something else, so that he be heavy: for the dislocation will immediately return.
Et reducitur etiam secundum modum alium: et est, ut figatur in terra lignum longum, cuius caput sit rotundum figura: sicut manica mortarii: quod non sit grossum, neque subtile.	It is also reduced in another way: and it is so arranged that the wood of a tree which is long and has a round head, like the handle of a mortar, should not be thick or fine.
Deinde ponatur sub infirmo postquam ponuntur super caput ligni panni lenes: et infirmus sit stans secundum longitudinem ligni.	Then put a thin cloth under the body after they have placed it on top of the wood's head: and the sick man should stand according to the length of the wood.
Deinde extendatur manus eius ad inferiora a parte altera, et extendatur corpus eius ab altera parte cum fortitudine: nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then his hands are extended to the lower part from one side, and his body is extended from the other side with strength: for the junction returns to its place with velocity.
Quod si difficilis sit eius reductio per omnia quae diximus, tunc utere hac cura: et est, ut accipias lignum cuius longitudo sit quantitas duorum brachiorum, et eius latitudo quantitas quatuor digitorum, et grossitudo eius quantitas duorum digitorum: cui sit caput rotundum, ut alleuietur introitus eius in profundum titillici, secundum hanc formam.	If his reduction is difficult through all that we have said, then use this cure: and it is so that you take a piece of wood the length of two arms, and its width is the width of four fingers, and its thickness is the thickness of two fingers; and let its head be round, so that it may relieve the entrance to the deep pit, according to this form.
Deinde ligentur super caput rotundum panni lenes, ut non laedat lignum infirmum.	Then thin cloth should be tied over the round head so that it does not hurt the sick wood.
Deinde ponatur sub titillico infirmi, ut extendatur manus, aut brachium super lignum usque ad inferiora: et ligetur lignum super adiutorium et brachium et extremitatem manus.	Then the sick person should be placed under the pit so that his hands or arm can be extended over the wood to the lower part; and the wood should be tied to the aid and arm and end of the hand.
Deinde ponatur brachium super gradum scalae per latitudinem, et extendatur manus ad inferiora, et dimittatur reliquum corpus suspensum a parte altera.	Then an arm should be placed on the step by its width, and the hand should be extended to the lower part, and the remaining body should be suspended from one side.
Iunctura enim ingreditur statim.	The junction enters immediately.
Cum ergo completur introitus eius secundum quemcunque modum possibile est: tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico spheram aequalis quantitatis ex lana.	When the entrance has thus been completed in any way possible, then you should place under the pit a sphere of equal size made of wool.
Deinde pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum olibano, et albumine oui super humerum totum, sicut reuoluitur desuper.	Then place a prepared plug made of ground incense with olive oil and white powder on the whole shoulder, as it rises from above.
Deinde stringe sub titillico strictura decenti: et reuoluatur ligamentum super emplastrum desuper: et annectatur manus eius ad collum ipsius, et dimittatur, neque moueatur manus eius septem diebus.	Then tie the string under the pit with a tight knot: and let it rise above the plug; and connect his hands to his neck, and leave them alone for seven days.
Et oportet, ut ponatur cibus infirmipaucus, donec confortetur membrum: quoniam est uelocius ad sanationem eius.	It is necessary that food be given to the sick person until he feels better, because it is faster for him to heal.
Deinde ponatur amplior post septem dies, aut quinque, et ex ercitetur cum motu.	Then after seven or five days he should be given more, and then he should be examined with movement.
Si ergo firmatur et non mollificatur, tunc iam sanatus est.	If then it is firm and does not soften, then it is well healed.
Si uero iunctura dislocatur multotiens, propter humiditatem quae accidit ei, aut propter caussam aliam: tunc oportet, ut administretur in ea cauterium cum tribus foraminibus, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo de cauterio.	If then the joint is dislocated many times, because of the moisture that occurs with it, or for another reason: then it is necessary that cauterization be administered to it with three holes, according to what has been said in the chapter on cauterization.
Quod si fiat hoc totum, et soluatur ligamentum post septem dies, et non confirmetur iunctura, et reducatur emplastrum et strictura super ipsum aliquotiens, et non firmetur, et cadat, et non possit eleuare ipsum ad superiora: tunc scias, quod nerui eius qui sunt ad caput humeri, iam incisi sunt, aut extensi, aut mollificati: et scias, quod iunctura nunquam figetur in loco suo.	That if this is done entirely, and the ligament is loosened after seven days, and the joint does not firm up, and the splint and tightness on it are sometimes removed, and it does not harden, and falls, and cannot raise itself to the top: then you should know that the nerves that go to the shoulder have already been cut, or stretched out, or softened: and you should know that the joint is never fixed in its place.
Dislocationis autem quae fit uersus pectus et mammillam, aut ad posteriora reductio, fit cum impulsione et extensione cum manibus: donec redeat, et administretur in ea reliqua strictura et cura, donec sanetur.	But dislocation that happens toward the chest and nipple, or backward reduction, is made with an impact and extension with the hands: until it returns, and cauterization is administered to it with remaining tightness and care, until it heals.
Quod si accidat post sanationem grauitas in membro, et tarditas in motu eius, tunc utatur infirmus balneo multotiens, donec leniatur illa grauitas, et redeat ad naturam eius primam.	That if something happens after healing with a heavy weight on the member, and delay in its movement: then the sick person should use baths many times, until that heaviness is softened, and return to its own nature first.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Cubiti.	On the treatment of dislocation of the cubitus bone.
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter XXVIII.
Scias, quod iunctura Cubiti dislocatur cum difficultate, et similiter redit cum difficultate etiam: et ipsa quidem dislocatur ad omnes partes, et praecipue ad anteriorem, aut ad posteriorem.	You should know that the joint of the cubitus dislocates with difficulty, and in the same way it returns with difficulty, too: and it itself dislocates to all parts, especially to the front, or to the back.
Et eius dislocatio non occultatur tibi: quoniam est cadens sub uisu, et sub tactu, secundum quamcunque figuram dislocetur.	And its dislocation does not conceal itself from you: because it falls with a noise, and with a touch, according to whatever figure it dislocates.
Et quando coniungis cubitum dislocatum cum sano, declaratur tibi illud manifeste.	And when you join the broken hip with a sound one, let it be manifest to thee.
Concauatur enim iunctura, et non potest duplicare brachium, neque tangere cum eo humerum suum.	For the joint will be broken, and the arm cannot be doubled, nor can it touch its own shoulder.
Et oportet, ut properes, et reducas dislocationem statim, antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And you ought to reduce the dislocation immediately, before a cold apostema comes upon him.
Nam si accidit ei apostema calidum, difficilis fit eius reductio: et fortasse non sanatur omnino, praecipue quando est ad posteriora.	For if a hot apostema comes upon him, it is difficult to reduce; and he may not be cured at all, especially when it is behind.
Est enim deterior omnibus speciebus dislocationis, et uehementioris doloris eis: et multotiens descendit cum ea mors.	For this is worse in every respect than dislocation, and more painful; and often death comes with it.
Et restauratio eius quando est ex eis quae possibile est reducere, est, ut extendatur manus eius cum duabus manibus: et brachium eius sit expansum, et manus medici sint supra cubitum et sub eo, et ipse impellat iuncturam cum pollicibus manuum suarum simul, aut cum radice palmae suae, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And the restoration of it is when it can be reduced, to extend his hand with two hands; and his arm is spread out, and the doctor's fingers are above and below the hip, and he pushes the dislocation with his thumbs of his hands simultaneously, or with the root of his palm, until he returns to his place.
Aut uero dislocatio est ad anteriora: tunc redit ita, ut duplicet manum cum manu sua, donec percutiat cum radice palmae suae cubitum qui est dislocatus.	Or rather the dislocation is to the front; then he returns in such a way that he doubles his hand with his own hand until he hits against the root of his palm the hip that is dislocated.
Quod si non obedit dislocatio ad reductionem, tunc administra extensionem uehementem, fortem ualde: et est, ut extendant brachium duo ministri: et teneant ipsum duo ministri etiam, ut non remoueatur apud extensionem.	Which if he does not obey the dislocation to reduction, then administer a harsh and sharp extension; and it is as if two ministers extend the arm: and they hold him too, so that he does not move during the extension.
Deinde reuoluatur brachium ad omnem partem postquam inuoluitur super manum eius pannus duplicatus longus, aut ligamentum latum.	Then the arm is rotated to all parts after it has been turned over a blanket of cloth doubled long, or a wide ligament.
Et quando tangit medicus manu sua iuncturam, inungat ipsam cum oleo: ut sit illud ex eis quae adiuuant in lubricitate iuncturae cum facilitate.	And when the doctor touches the joint with his own hand, he should anoint it with oil so that the joint moves easily with lubrication.
Deinde impellat iuncturam impulsione uehementi, donec redeat.	Then he pushes the dislocation with a harsh push until it is reduced.
Et post reductionem eius oportet, ut ponatur super ipsam emplastrum, in quo sit stipticitas, et exiccatio cum albugine oui: et stringatur strictura decenti.	And after its reduction, let a poultice be placed on it, in which there is stinging, and drying with chalk powder; and it is bound tightly going down.
Et suspendatur brachium a collo infirmi: et dimitte diebus aliquot.	And hang the arm from the neck of the nurse: and let it rest for several days.
Deinde soluatur.	Then untie it.
Si ergo firmatur iunctura in loco suo, tunc solue ligamentum ab ea, et dimitte ipsam.	But if the joint has set in place, then loosen the ligature from it, and let it be.
Et si uides iuncturam non bene stringi, tunc itera emplastrum, et ligamentum, et dimitte ipsam diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	And if you see that the joint is not well tied, then renew the plaster and the ligature, and let it be: for several days let it rest, until it is tied.
Deinde solue ipsam.	Then untie it.
Si autem accidit ei grauitas post reductionem iuncturae, et dispositio sit in motu: tunc administra humectationem in balneatione, et fricationem subtilem, et compressionem, donec liniatur, aut pone super iuncturam iliati, id est, natem arietis pinguem.	But if the weight comes to him after the joint has been reduced and he is in motion: then administer humidification in balneation, and subtle friction, and pressure, until it has healed, or put something over the joint, that is, nat-o-me-um (a mix of olive oil and vinegar).
Deinde ligetur, et dimitte ipsam super eam die et nocte.	Then tie it up, and let it be: for a day and a night.
Deinde aufer eam, et intromitte ipsum in balneum.	Then take it off, and put him in the bath.
Cum ergo sudat, tunc frica iuncturam fricatione temperata.	But when he sweats: then tie the joint with subtle friction.
Deinde itera super ipsam aleliati uice una, et secunda, et tertia cum introitu balnei, donec leniatur.	Then repeat over the joint with a single stroke, and another, and a third time with the entrance into the bath, until it has softened.
Et si uis, pone super ipsam stercus uaccinum, humidum, calefactum cum butyro, et stringe super ipsum.	And if you want: put over the joint dung, moist, heated with butter, and tie over it.
Fac illud aliquotiens.	Do this a few times.
Ipsa namque lenitur, et redit ad dispositionem suam.	This softens it, and it returns to its position.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Almahassem.	The cure for dislocation by Albucasis.
Caput XXIX.	Chapter XXIX.
Mahassem manus multotiens dislocatur, id est, iunctura quae est inter brachium et manum.	Mahessem dislocates the hand, that is, the joint which is between the arm and the hand.
Et reductio dislocationis eius est facilis.	And the reduction of his dislocation is easy.
Econtrario reliquarum iuncturarum.	But the other joints are difficult to reduce.
Verumtamen oportet, ut uelocitas sit in reductione dislocationis eius in hora in qua dislocatur, antequam apostemetur locus: aut accidat in eo apostema calidum.	However, it is necessary that speed be there in the reduction of his dislocation at the time when he dislocates, before the measurement is taken: or happens to him in the case of hot weather.
Et reductio dislocationis in eo est, ut ponas Mahassem manus infirmae super tabulam, et extendat minister manum eius: et ponat medicus palmam suam super eminentiam iuncturae, et impellat eam, donec redeat.	And the reduction of his dislocation is this: that you put Mahessem's weak hand on a table, and let him stretch out his finger of the hand: and that the doctor puts his palm on the eminence of the joint, and pushes it, until it returns.
Verumtamen oportet, ut consyderetur, si palma iam recessit ad uentrem manus: tunc ponat infirmus dorsum manus suae super tabulam apud extensionem et reductionem: et si dislocatio est procedens ad dorsum manus, tunc sit positio manus eius intrinsece super tabulam, id est, interior pars manus eius super tabulam ponatur, ut cadat manus medici super ipsam eminentiam iuncturae.	Indeed, it should be considered if the palm has already receded to the abdomen of the hand: then place the sick hand of his behind a table at extension and reduction; and if dislocation is going towards the back of the hand, then the hand's position should be intrinsece on the table, that is, the inner part of the hand should be placed over the table so that the doctor's hand falls over this eminence of the joint.
Si ergo redit statim, bonum est: et si non, tunc stringe eam cum emplastro sedante apostema: et dimitte ipsum, neque iteres illud.	If it has returned immediately, then it is good; and if not, then bind it with a plaster while it sits with an apostema: and let him go, and do not return to it.
Nam si non tolerat, neque potes super reductionem eius, postquam praetereunt ei dies, uerumtamen iunctura remanet secundum tortuositatem suam: et non nocet infirmo aliquid, nisi quod mollificatur manus, et non potest stringere aliquid: tunc scias, quod nerui sunt abscissi, aut attriti.	For if he does not tolerate it, and you cannot bring it to reduction after the days have passed, yet the joint remains according to its tortuosity: and there is no harm in an infirm man unless his hand becomes soft, and he cannot clench anything: then you should know that the nerves are cut off or rubbed.
Non est ergo ingenium in ea, nisi ut stringatur cum cauterio prope casum eius.	Therefore, it is not a talent in this, except to bind it with a suture near its danger.
Et fortasse non confert illud aliquid.	And perhaps it does not yield anything.
Cum ergo non redit Almahassem, tunc pone super ipsum emplastrum, quod narrauimus.	So when he does not return to Al-Mahasım, then place on him a plaster which we have described.
Deinde stringatur, et dimittatur quinque diebus: postea soluatur et dimittatur, et exercitetur manus.	Then bind it and let it go for five days: then untie it and let it go, and exercise the hand.
Si autem priuatur motus eius, et accidat in ea aliquid grauitatis: tunc leni eam cum aqua calefacta, et fricatione aliquotiens, donec leniatur.	But if its movement is prevented, and something heavy happens to it: then soften it with hot water and sometimes with friction, until it softens.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Digitorum.	The Treatment of Dislocation of the Digits
Caput XXX.	Head XX
Quando dislocatur ex eis Digitus ad omnem partem, uel ex eis Digitus ad dorsum palmae, aut uentrem eius: tunc extende Digitum, et impelle dislocationem pollicibus tuis, donec redeat.	When a finger is dislocated from all sides, or from the back of the palm, or from its bottom: then extend the finger, and push the dislocation with your thumb until it returns.
Deinde sustenta caput Digiti, et suspende ipsum uersus partem ad quam dislocatur, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	Then support the tip of the finger, and suspend it towards the side to which it is dislocated, and let him go for two days.
Deinde suspende eum, et extende ipsum, donec aequetur rectus in illo die suo.	Then suspend him and extend him until he is even with the straight line on that day.
Cum ergo fuerit nox, liga ipsum secundum narrationem ipsam: et non cesses soluere ipsum in die: et exerce eum cum motu: et liga ipsum in nocte.	And then, when it is night, bind him according to his narrative: and do not cease to unbind him on that day: and exercise him with motion: and bind him at night.
Fac illud diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	Make it for a few days until he is tied up.
Et similiter fac cum eo, si dislocatur ad uentrem manus: et liga eum ad partem ipsam, et fac cum eo operationem tuam primam, donec sanetur.	And also do the same with him if his shoulder comes out of place: and bind him to the side that is hurt, and do your work with him until he heals.
Et similiter fac cum eo quando dislocatur ad reliquas partes.	And also do the same with him when his shoulder or any other part comes out of place.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Spondilium dorsi.	§ On the treatment of dislocations of the spine (back).
Caput XXXI.	CHAPTER XXXI.
Quando accidit alicui Spondilium dorsi, aut colli dislocatio completa, aut remouentur Spondiles multae a locis suis: tunc non est in ea curatio, quoniam mors properat infirmo.	When it happens to anyone that the spine or the neck is completely out of joint, or that many spines have been removed from their places: there is no cure for this disease, for death approaches the sick person.
Et signum illius est, quod egestio infirmi egreditur absque uoluntate, neque potest tenere eam: et multotiens mollificantur ex eo quaedam membra eius, aut duo crura eius, aut duo brachia ipsius, aut unum eorum: aut remouetur Spondilis una de loco suo.	And its sign is that the sick person leaves off working willingly, and cannot hold anything: and often some of his limbs become weak from him, or two of his limbs, or two of his arms, or one of them: or one of his spines is removed from its place.
Multotiens enim remouetur, quod multotiens fit remotio earum ad quatuor partes.	For often one is removed again, since it often happens that they are moved on all four sides.
Illa ergo quae remouetur ad posteriora, nominatur Gibbositas.	That which is moved to the back is called  (curved) Hump.
Curatio uero eius est, ut consyderes tunc, si Gibbositas accidit a puericia: tunc non est in ea curatio, neque ex ea est sanatio omnino.	But the cure for that is so that if the   (curved) Hump has happened from infancy: there is no cure for it, and there is no healing at all from it.
In illa autem quae accidit a casu, aut percussione, aut similibus illis, iam dixerunt antiqui modos curationis sermone prolixo.	But in that which has happened from a fall, or from being struck, or from similar things: the old people have long ago told you about the ways of curing it.
Cuius plurimum non redit cum proficuo.	For most of them do not return with profit.
Ego uero iam abbreuiaui ex illo, cuius parum excusat a multo eius ex propinquitate mea ad intentionem: et expositione mea qua exposui illud, et formaui instrumentum eius diuerso modo ab eo quo ostenderunt illud, et exposuerunt ipsum.	I have however shortened that from him, for it does not excuse his being far away from my intention: and my exposure of it and forming an instrument with many different ways out of it, and showing it to himself.
Dico ergo, quod in gibbositate quae accidit ab anteriori parte, non est ingenium, neque sanatio ex ea.	I say then, that in a deformity which occurs from the front part, there is no talent, nor healing from it.
Et similiter in illa quae fit ad duo latera etiam.	And likewise in that which was made on both sides.
Et non curatur ex eis, nisi illa quae accidit in dorso proprie, cum eo quod ego narro: et est, ut extendatur infirmus super faciem suam super podium aequale prope parietem: et expandatur sub eo stramentum humidum, ut non laedatur pectus eius.	And not to be cured from them, unless that which happens in the back of its own is considered: and it is like this, that the sick person extends over his face on a platform equal near the wall: and he expands under it a damp cloth, so that his chest is not hurt.
Deinde ponatur lignum rectum fixum in fouea in terra, in extremitate podii, circiter caput eius: et lignum aliud circiter pedes eius in extremitate altera podii: et minister teneat lignum, et sit non firmatum in fouea.	Then a straight piece of wood should be placed in the footrest on the ground, at the end of the leg, about the head of it: and another piece of wood should be held around the person's feet at the other end of the leg: and the assistant should hold the wood steady, so that it does not stand firm in the footrest.
Et minister alter teneat alterum.	And the other assistant should hold the other one.
Deinde inuolue super caput infirmi, et sub titillicis eius ligamentum lene, firmum: et extende extremitatem ligamenti ad lignum quod est apud caput eius: et liga ipsum in eo.	Then he will turn his head with a soft cloth, and fasten it firmly: and he will extend the end of the ligament to the wood that is at the head: and he will tie himself up in it.
Deinde stringe ligamentum aliud supra anchas eius, et supra genua ipsius, et apud cauillas eius.	Then he will tighten another ligament above his shoulders, and above his knees, and around his loins.
Deinde aggrega ligamenta omnia, et liga ea in ligno altero quod est apud pedes eius.	Then he will tie all the ligaments together, and tie them to the other wood that is at his feet.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem ligni ligamentum, et non remoueantur duo ligna ex locis suis in quibus sunt fixa: uerumtamen non sint firmata, sicut diximus.	Then the assistant will stretch all the ligaments to the side of the wood, and do not remove the two woods from their places where they are fixed: however, they should not be fixed, as we have said.
Et medicus ponat palmas suas super Spondilem cum fortitudine, donec redeat: aut ponat super eam tabulam.	And the doctor should place his palms on the spine with strength, until he has straightened out: or he should place them on the board.
Deinde annectat super tabulam pedes suos, donec redeat.	Then he will attach his feet to the board, until he has straightened out.
Si autem non redit per hanc curationem, tunc accipe tabulam cuius longitudo sit circiter tria brachia.	If, however, he does not recover with this treatment, then take a board whose length is about three arms.
Et caua in pariete de quo diximus quod est prope infirmum, locum in quem ingrediatur extremitas tabulae.	And the wall where we have spoken of, which is near the sick person, should be a place into which the end of the board can be inserted.
Deinde pone medium tabulae super Spondilem.	Then put the middle piece of the board over the spine.
Et ponat pedes suos medicus super extremitatem alteram.	And let the doctor put his feet on the other end.
Et stringat bene, donec coartetur Spondilis, et redeat ad locum suum.	And tighten it well until the spine is cinched and return to its place.
Deinde si uis, operare cum torno quod inuoluitur cum manu tua: et est, ut figas in terram apud caput infirmi in postremo podii duo ligna, quorum longitudo sit brachii unius: et apud caput eius in postremo podii duo ligna.	Then if you want to operate with a tourniquet that is held by your hand: and it is so, that you set on the ground at the head of the bed two logs whose length sits of an arm: and at the head of those two logs.
Et sit longitudo quae est inter omne lignum palmus unus: et iam factum est in omni loco foramen, in quo currit tornum: et firmetur lignum omne in terra multum, ne moueatur omnino.	And the length that is between all the wood is one palm: and now it is done at every place a hole, where the tourniquet runs: and all the wood is made firm on the ground, so that it does not move at all.
Et intromittatur lignum rotundum: et est tornum in quo reuoluitur ligamentum in duobus foraminibus duorum lignorum.	And the round wood is inserted: and the tourniquet is in two holes of the two woods.
Et in extremitate eius est foramen, in quo firmatur lignum, cuius longitudo est palmus cum eo quod reuoluitur: et in duobus lignis aliis est similiter illius.	And at the end of it is a hole, in which the wood is fastened, whose length is a palm with that which rotates: and in two other woods there is the same.
Deinde stringe ligamenta quae strinxisti in pectore infirmi torno quod est apud caput eius: et ligamenta quae strinxisti in cruribus eius in torno quod est apud pedes eius.	Then tighten the ligatures that you have tightened in the chest of the patient with the tourniquet that is at his head: and the ligatures that you have tightened in his thighs with the tourniquet that is at his feet.
Deinde stet apud omne tornum minister, qui torqueat manum suam cum licinio, cum quo reuoluitur tornum: et medicus aequet Spondilem, secundum quod diximus.	Then stand next to every tourniquet assistant who twists his hand with the key, with which the tourniquet rotates: and the doctor makes even the spine, according to what we said.
Haec est forma torni, quae sequitur.	This is the form of the tourniquet, which follows.
Deinde postquam redit Spondilis, et aequatur locus, tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum exiccatiuum cum albumine oui.	Then after the spine has returned and evened out, then it is necessary that you put on dried blood with albumen.
Deinde stuppam.	Then a pillow.
Postea pone supra emplastrum astellam ex tabula, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, aut circiter eos.	Then put above the blood-soaked cloth a board whose width is three fingers, or about them.
Et longitudo eius quantitas quae capiat locum Gibbositatis, et super partem Spondilis sanae.	And the length of it what takes up the space of the hollowness, and on the side of the spine healthy.
Deinde ligetur cum ligamento quod diximus.	Then tighten with a ligature, which we have said.
Et utatur infirmus nutrimento subtili, donec sanetur.	The sick should be fed with a subtle diet until they are well.
Quod si remaneat quiddam eminentiae in loco in fine sanationis: tunc oportet, ut administrentur medicinae quae mollificant, et leniunt, cum administratione tabulae quam narrauimus tempore longo.	If there remains any sign of a malady at the end of recovery: then it is necessary that the medicines which soften and relieve be given with a bland diet over an extended period of time.
Et iam administratur in illo lamina plumbi.	And it is given to him in that leaden bed.
Et quandoque accidit eminentia in postremo Spondilium dorsi: et putatur per eam dislocatio, et est illud os quod iam eminet.	And when there happens a malady at the very end of the back spine: and it is thought that by this dislocation, and it is this mouth which now emerges.
Quare non oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei cum hac medicina: fortasse enim accidere faciet mortem.	Why should he not be put to death with such medicine: for it might perhaps cause death.
¶ De curatione Anchae dislocatae.	On the treatment of a dislocated ankle.
Caput XXXII.	Chapter III2 of The Book of Surgery by Albucasis.
Scias, quod iuncturae Anchae, et iuncturae humeri, non accidit, nisi dislocatio tantum: neque accidit eis quod accidit reliquis iuncturis ex remotione parua, et concauitate.	You should know that a dislocated ankle, and a dislocated shoulder, do not occur unless there is a complete dislocation: nor does it occur to them what happens with other joints due to a small distance and pressure.
Et iunctura quidem Anchae dislocatur secundum quatuor partes.	And the joint of the ankle dislocates according to four parts.
Quod est, quia dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	Because it dislocates towards the front and towards the back.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur ad interiora: et parum dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	And indeed it mostly dislocates towards the inside: and little towards the front and back.
Et curatio dislocationis eius ad interiora, est: quia quando tu coniungis crus infirmi sanum cum infirmo, est longius: et est genu eius eminens plus quam sani, et non potest infirmus duplicare pedem suum apud inguen: et est locus qui sequitur inguen apostematus apostemate calido, propterea, quod caput coxae iam peruenit illic.	And the treatment for this dislocation to the inside is: because when you join the healthy thigh with the sick one, it is longer: and his knee joint emerges more than that of a healthy person, and the sick person cannot double his leg at the hip: and there is a warm place following the hip, so that the head of the hip has already reached it.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad exteriora est, quod sunt accidentia eius contraria istis accidentibus.	And the sign of him who has suffered a dislocation to the outside is, that are opposable signs to these signs.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad anteriora, est, quia expandit crus sanum secundum complementum: uerumtamen non duplicat ipsum absque dolore qui est in genu: et si conatur ad ambulandum, non potest super illud ad anteriora: et retinetur urina eius, et apostematur inguen eius, et apud ambulationem est calcatio eius super calcaneum.	And the sign of him who has suffered a dislocation to the front is, that he spreads out the healthy thigh according to its complement: however, he does not double it without pain in his leg: and if he tries to walk, he cannot step forward on to the front: and he holds back his urine, and is thrust out at the hip, and during walking he catches his foot on the heel.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad posteriora est, ut non expandat genu, neque possit duplicare ipsum antequam duplicet inguen: et est crus eius etiam breuius altero: et inguen est mollificatum, et est caput coxae apud locum ilii.	And the sign of him who has dislocated his hip behind is that he cannot spread his knees without spreading his hips first, and his leg is shorter than the other, and his hips are softened, and the head of the femur is at the place of the hip joint.
Reductio uero huius dislocationis specierum est, ut consyderes tunc, si dislocatio est uetusta, quae iam antiquatur cum habente ipsam.	The reduction of this dislocation is that you should consider then, if the dislocation is fresh, which now grows old with one who has it.
Deinde si tu administres reductionem eius, et remanet secundum dispositionem suam: tunc non est in ea curatio omnino.	Then, if you administer the reduction of it, and remains after its own disposition: then there is no cure at all in it.
Non ergo oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei penitus.	Therefore it should not be assumed that he is completely cured.
In illo autem cuius dislocatio est recens, et est ex una specierum quatuor dislocationis: tunc propera ad hoc, ut uoluas iuncturam, et extendas ipsam ad interiora et ad exteriora, et moueas eam dextra et sinistra: fortasse enim redit, et non indiget alia cura.	But in that one whose dislocation is fresh, and is of the four kinds of dislocations: then approach to this, so that you may loose it, and extend it towards the inside and outside, and move it with your right and left hand: for perhaps it will recover itself, and will not need any other cure.
Si autem non redit hoc modo, tunc oportet, ut praepares ministrum fortem, et extendat crus eius ab inferiori parte: aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento, quod ligetur super crus eius supra genu: et minister alius extendat manum eius desuper, ita ut intromittat manus suas sub titillicis eius.	But if this does not happen in this way, then you should prepare a strong instrument, and extend his leg from the lower part: or with its hands, or with a ligature that binds above the leg: and another minister should extend his hand from above the knee, so that he can put his hands under the skin.
Deinde stringat cum ligamento leni super radicem coxae, et teneat extremitatem ligamenti alterius.	Then he should tie with a soft ligature on the root of the hip, and hold the end of the other ligament.
Et sit extensio eius aut ab anteriori parte inguinis ad partem furculae, aut a posteriori ad partem dorsi.	And let his extension be either from the front part of the groin to the side of the thigh, or from the back to the side of the spine.
Et sit extensio eorum omnium uice una, donec eleuetur infirmus cum corpore suo a terra, et remaneat pendens.	And let all these extensions be bent at once, until he raises himself up with his body from the ground, and remains hanging.
Et haec enim species extensionis est species communis specierum quatuor.	This is indeed a common type of reduction for all four kinds of dislocations.
Si ergo redit dislocatio cum eo quod diximus, est bonum: et si non, tunc necesse est omni speciei illud quod dicam de curatione propria.	But if the dislocation returns with this that I have said, it is good: and if not, then it is necessary for all kinds to say what I mean about their own cure.
In reductione quidem eius propria quando dislocatio est ad interiora, oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super latus suum sanum.	For in his own reduction when dislocation is to the interiors, it should be so that the sick person lies on the healthy side of him.
Deinde ponat ligamentum super radicem coxae, in eo quod est inter caput coxae, et locum qui est sub inguine.	Then he places the ligament over the root of the pelvis, in that which is between the head of the pelvis, and the place which is under the groin.
Deinde extende ligamentum ad sursum a parte inguinis ad altiorem partem corporis, ad partem furculae.	Then he extends the ligament to the top from the part of the groin to the higher side of the body, to the part of the fence.
Deinde accipiat minister alius fortis brachia eius, et minuat locum grossum coxae infirmae, et extendat ad exteriora extensione uehementi.	Then another strong minister takes his arm, and diminishes the place of the large pelvis of the sick person, and extends it to the externals with a great extension.
Iam enim redit ad locum suum.	For he has already returned to his place.
Et haec species est facilioris reliquis speciebus curationis, qua reducitur hoc membrum.	And this species is easier than the other species of cure, by which this member is reduced.
Si autem excusatur super te, et non obedit tibi ad introitum cum hac specie curationis omnino: tunc oportet, ut ligentur duo pedes infirmi simul cum ligamento forti, leni, super duos calcaneos, et super duo genua: et sit longitudo cuiusque a compare suo quantitatis quatuor digitorum: et sit crus infirmum extensum plus altero quantitate duorum digitorum.	If, however, he does not comply with you at all in this entry with this species of cure: then it should be so that two nurses are bound together with a strong ligament, soft, over the two heels, and over the two knees: and let the length of each from its comparison be the quantity of four fingers: and let the trunk of the sick person be extended by one more quantity of two fingers.
Deinde suspendatur infirmus super caput ligni, quod sit in domo: et sit longitudo eius a terra quantitas duorum brachiorum.	Then the sick person should be suspended on the head of the wood, which is in the house: and let the length of him from the ground be the quantity of two arms.
Deinde praecipe iuueni forti, ut muniat caput coxae: et suspendatur cum infirmo inuenis alius: et impellat iuuenis alius, muniens coxam cum fortitudine, nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then command a strong young man to support the head of the pelvis: and let another suspend the sick one with his back: and let another push him with strength, for the turning returns to its place with speed.
In reditione autem eius propria, quando est dislocatio ad exteriora, oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super podium, secundum quod narrauimus in habente gibbositatem.	But in his own reduction, when there is a dislocation to the externals, it should be so that the sick person lies on the ground, according to which we have spoken in having gibbosity.
Et stringatur ligamentum super crus eius, infirmum proprie, et super pectus eius.	And let a ligament be tied around his own weak pelvis and over his chest.
Deinde ponantur duo ligna, unum apud pedes eius, et alterum apud caput ipsius.	Then two logs are placed, one at the feet of him, and another at the head of him.
Deinde ponatur lignum additum in medio podii, fixum bene: super quod inuoluti sint panni humidi, ut non laedat infirmum: et sit lignum inter coxas eius, ut non attrahatur ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then a log is placed in the middle of the pelvis, fixed securely: over which moist cloths are spread so as not to wound the sick person: and let the wood be between his hips, so that it does not attract towards the lower side by extension.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem suam, et medicus aequet reductionem manu sua.	Then all the attendants should spread out to their respective parts and the doctor should give a careful reduction with his hand.
Si ergo obedit ad reuersionem, erit bonum.	If he therefore submits to reversion, it will be good.
Et si non, pone super ipsam tabulam, et preme ipsam, sicut diximus in gibbositate, aequaliter.	And if not, place her on the table, and press her equally as we said in the case of a hunchback.
Verumtamen oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	However, it is necessary that the sick person lie on the sound side.
Et quando dislocatio est ad anteriora, tunc oportet, ut extendatur crus infirmi uelociter: et est secundum hanc eandem narrationem super podium: et ponat medicus palmam manus suae dextrae super inguen infirmum.	And when dislocation is to the front, then it is necessary that the leg of the attendant be spread quickly out; and it is according to this story on a platform: and the doctor should place his hand with his right hand on the knee of the sick person.
Deinde coartet ipsum cum manu altera, et cum illa coartatione pone ipsum extensum ad inferiora ad partem genu.	Then he should tie him up with the other hand, and with that tying place him stretched out to the lower side of the knee.
Et si dislocatio est ad posteriora: tunc non oportet, ut extendatur infirmus ad inferiora, et sit eleuatus super terram: imo oportet, ut sit positus super rem duram, sicut oportet, ut fit etiam si dislocatur ancha eius ad exteriora, secundum illud quod diximus de accubitu eius super duas anchas: et est super faciem eius, et ligamenta extensa: secundum quod diximus nuper.	And if dislocation is to the back: then it is not necessary that the sick person be stretched out to the lower side, and let him sit upright on the ground; but he should be placed on a hard surface, as it is also if his ankle dislocates to the outside, according to what we said about his lying on two ankles: and it is on his face, and the ligaments are extended; according to what we have just said.
Et oportet, ut administretur compressio cum tabula etiam super locum ad quem egreditur iunctura, cum completur reductio secundum quod oportet.	And it is necessary that compression with the table be administered also to the place from which the injury comes out, when reduction is completed in accordance with what is necessary.
Et signum reditionis eius non occultatur tibi: et est, ut extendas duo crura infirmi: et quando uides ea aequalia, et infirmus stringit crus suum, et expandit ipsum absque excusatione: tunc scias, quia iam redit membrum, secundum quod oportet: tunc coniunge duas coxas, et pone emplastrum, et stringe cum imemati, id est, rota: ita, ut non moueatur ancha ad aliquam partium: et adhaereat infirmus quieti tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	And the sign of its return should not be hidden from you: and it is so that you spread out the two legs of the attendants; and when you see them equal, and the sick person tightens his leg, and stretches himself out without complaint: then you will know that his member has returned, in accordance with what is necessary; then join together the two hips, and place a splint, and tie it with a cord, so that it does not move to any part: and let the sick person be quiet for three or four days.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et emplastrum, et compara crus cum altero: tunc si uides ea aequalia in statu, tunc scias, quod dislocatio iam firmata est: absolue ergo infirmum ad ambulandum.	Then loosen the ligaments, and splint, and bring together the legs with each other; then if you see them equal in position, then you will know that the dislocation is now healed; so release the sick person to walk about.
Et si uides aliquid mollificationis: tunc redi, et emplastra illud, et stringe illud secundum stricturam tuam primam: et dimitte illud etiam tribus diebus.	And if you see any softening: then return, and patch it up, and tighten it according to your first order: and also release it after three days.
Deinde solue illud et fac ipsum tardare in ambulatione super utrumque aliquot diebus, donec confortetur bene.	Then remove it and make the wound heal well on its own for a few days, until it is healed.
¶ De dislocationis Genu.	[On the Dislocation of the Knee.]
Caput XXXIII.	CHAPTER XIII.
Genu dislocatur secundum tres modos.	[The knee may be dislocated] in three ways: first, by straightening the leg; second, by flex
Dislocatur ad exteriora, ad interiora, et ad inferiora, scilicet ad posteriora.	(It may be dislocated) to the outside, to the inside, and to the bottom, that is, to the back.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora.	And it is not dislocated to the front.
Et signum dislocationis eius, est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut applicet crus suum ad coxam suam.	[And the sign of its dislocation is that he who has the injury should apply his knee to his hip.]
Si autem non adhaeret cum coxa: tunc scias, quod Genu est dislocatum.	But if it does not attach to the hip: then you shall know that the knee is dislocated.
Et restauratio omnium modorum dislocationis eius est, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum, ita ut iam extendat crus suum si potest super illud, et adhaeret dorsum tuum ad faciem eius: et pone pedem eius inter pedes tuos.	[And the restoration of all types of dislocation is so that the sick person may sit upright and so that his leg may extend behind it if he can, and fasten his back to his face: and place his foot between your feet.
Deinde adhaerere fac Genu eius cum palmis tuis, et recta eas inter digitos tuos super Genu eius.	Then attach the knee of the injured person with your palms, and hold them straight between your fingers over his knee.
Deinde applica cum palma tua duo latera Genu eius cum fortitudine.	Then apply your two palms to the sides of his knee with strength.
Et minister alius extendat pedem eius, donec redeat Genu ad locum suum.	And another person extends his foot, until he brings the knee back to its place.
Et signum reditionis est, ut adhaereat crus cum coxa in lenitate, non laboriose.	[And the sign of restoration is that the hip should attach to the knee with ease, not with effort.]
Deinde emplastra ipsum, et adhaerere fac crus cum coxa.	Then patch him up, and fasten the hip to the knee.
Deinde liga ea simul cum uitta tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then bind them together at the same time with sutures for three or four days.
Deinde solue ea.	Then remove the bindings.
Et non utatur infirmus ambulatione aliquot diebus, donec sanetur.	And do not let the sick person walk for a few days until he is healed.
Si autem recusatur tibi reductio eius, tunc administra extensionem fortem cum ligamentis, quorum praecessit narratio in curatione anchae, donec redeat.	But if you do not bring him back to you by a strong extension of the ligaments, which is described in the cure of aching joints, until he returns to his place: then bind him up with ligatures, and administer a strong extension with the ligaments, until he heals.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Calcanei.	On the treatment of a dislocated calcaneus.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter III.
Calcaneus quandoque remouetur remotione parua, et quandoque dislocatur secundum complementum.	When the calcaneus is occasionally displaced with only a small degree, and sometimes dislocated from its second component.
Et dislocatio eius fit, aut ad interiora, aut ad exteriora.	And this displacement of it occurs either internally or externally.
Et signum dislocationis eius est, quod uides Calcaneum inflatum, procedentem ad partem ad quam dislocatur.	And the sign of this displacement is that you see the calcaneus swollen, protruding toward the side to which it is displaced.
Curatio autem remotionis eius, est facilis reditionis: et est, ut extendatur cum facilitate cum manibus, et aequetur, donec redeat.	The cure for this displacement is easy; and it is to extend it with ease by the hands, and to make it even, until it comes back.
In curatione autem eius quando dislocatur secundum complementum, oportet, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum: et teneat ipsum minister fortis ualde a posteriori parte dorsi eius, in medio ipsius.	But in the treatment of it when it is dislocated from its second component, you should make the sick person sit upright: and hold him by the rear part of his back, firmly in the middle of him.
Deinde tene tu cum manu tua dextra pedem eius a superiori parte eius, et cum manu tua sinistra ab inferiori parte pedis eius loco cauillae.	Then take hold of it with your right hand from the upper part of it, and with your left hand from the lower part of the foot near the nail.
Deinde trahe pedem ad tecum manu tua dextra.	Then draw the foot toward you with your right hand.
Deinde cum sinistra duabus uicibus.	Then with two fingers of your left hand.
Deinde extende cum sinistra, et impelle pectus pedis cum dextra uersus crus absque labore.	Then extend it with your left hand, and press the chest of the foot toward the leg with your right hand without any effort.
Fac illud bis, sicut narrauimus.	Do this twice, as we have described.
Deinde impelle pectus pedis ad crus in uice tertia, et tu trahis cauillam.	Then press the chest of the foot toward the leg in a third direction, and you pull on the nail.
Si ergo redit in uice una, aut in duabus secundum hunc modum, et uides pedem aequatum, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera operationem super ipsum: quoniam ipse redit.	If it then comes back in a single direction or in two directions like this, and you see the foot even, it is good; but if not, then repeat the action on him: for he will come back.
Si autem prohibetur tibi reductio eius cum eo quod narrauimus: tunc fac iacere infirmum super dorsum suum super terram, et fige paxillum in terra firmatum ualde, ut cadat inter coxas eius: et tu iam inuoluisti super ipsum pannum, ut non laedat infirmum.	But if it is forbidden to you to reduce it with that which we have described: then let the sick person lie on his back on the ground, and fix a sturdy leg in the ground so that it falls between his thighs; and you may now roll over him the cloth so as not to hurt him.
Deinde accipiat minister coxam eius: postea extendat minister alter pedem, aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento quod liget super collum pedis.	Then let the servant of the sick person take his leg: then the other servant shall extend it, or with his hands, or with a band that binds around the neck of the foot.
Deinde extendat omnis minister contra extensionem comparis sui: et paxillus sit stans inter duas coxas infirmi retinens eum, ut non attrahatur corpus eius ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then all the ministers shall stand against the extension of their own body; and the nurse shall stand between the two hips holding him, so that his body is not drawn down to the lower side during the extension.
Deinde aequet medicus dislocationem manibus suis, et minister alter teneat crus sanum ad inferiora.	Then the doctor shall make his hands equal, and the other minister shall hold the healthy leg from below.
Nam dislocatio redit cum uelocitate.	For the dislocation returns with velocity.
Quando ergo redit dislocatio, et declaratur tibi sanitas reditionis eius: tunc pone emplastrum et stuppam, et stringe ipsam cum ligamentis firmiter, et liga pedem cum ligamento ad crus.	When therefore the dislocation returns, and appears to you that the restoration is sound: then place a strap and support, and tighten it with ligaments firmly, and bind the foot with the ligament to the leg.
Et oportet, ut caueas uel timeas de neruis, qui sunt supra calcaneum posterius, ut non sit ligamentum super eos uehemens, et laedat eos.	And it is necessary that you should beware and fear the nerves which are above the heel at the back, lest the ligaments be too tight on them, and they hurt them.
Deinde dimitte ipsum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then let him go for two days, or three.
Quod si mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum: deinde solue ipsum in die tertio, aut quarto: et prohibe infirmum ab ambulatione quadraginta diebus.	That if the ligament softens, tighten it again: then حلّه in a third day, or a fourth day: and forbid the sick from walking for forty days.
Si uero conatur ambulare ante illud spacium, non fit securitas quin dissoluatur super ipsum dislocatio, et corrumpatur, et non recipiat post illud curationem.	But if he should attempt to walk before that space, there is no security but the dislocation would break again, and be corrupted, and receive no cure after it.
Quod si accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc oportet, ut administres in sedatione eius illud, in quo praecessit narratio nostra in alio loco ex curatione, et embrocationem, donec remoueatur.	That if he should happen to have a feverish swelling: then you shall administer to him in a sedative that which we have already mentioned in another place from the treatment, and an emulsion, until it subsides.
¶ De dislocatione Digitorum pedis, et cura.	Of the dislocation of the toes of the foot and their cure.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter L XV.
Oportet, ut aequetur quod dislocatur ex eis cum extensione pauca absque labore: et illud quidem non est difficile, imo est facile.	It is necessary that he should be equal when he is dislocated from them with a little extension without work: and that is not difficult, indeed, it is easy.
Si autem dislocatio est in quibusdam nodis dorsi pedis: tunc oportet, ut faciat sedere infirmus pedem suum super locum aequalem terrae, aut super tabulam: et est stans sicut ambulans.	But if the dislocation is in some of the joints of the back of the foot: then it is necessary that he should make his sick foot stand on an equal place of the earth, or on a table: and it stands as one who walks.
Deinde tu sta, et pone pedem tuum super illud quod eminet ex illis iuncturis.	Then stand still, and put your foot upon that which protrudes from them by the joint.
Deinde calca illud cum pede tuo cum uirtute, donec redeat, et uideas ipsum iam aequatum, et non appareat in loco eminentia.	Then press that bone with your foot with strength, until it returns, and the appearance is already equal, and does not appear at all in the place eminence.
Deinde pone sub uentre pedis eius tabulam quae capiat pedem totum, cui sint duo capita.	Then put under the stomach of his foot a plate which catches the whole foot, which has two heads.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti tribus diebus.	Then tighten him with a strap for three days.
Deinde solue ipsum, et fac quiescere eum ab ambulatione diebus multis, donec stringatur et securetur a reductione.	Then solve him, and let him rest from walking for several days, until he is tightened and made secure by the reduction.
¶ De speciebus dislocationis cum uulnere uel fractura.	As for the species of dislocation with the ulna or fracture.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter XXXVI.
Quando accidit aliquid ex illo, et conaris curationem eius, et ipsius restaurationem, multotiens succedit mors: et propter illud non oportet, ut praesumat super curationem eius, quod est huiusmodi, nisi qui est prudens in arte longi usus, misericors, pius, tardus, non audax, neque praesumptuosus: et ut utatur in incaeptionce medicinis quae sedant apostemata calida tantum: et dimittat infirmum diuino iudicio.	When something like this happens and you are concerned about his cure and recovery, often death succeeds: and because of this you should not presumptiously take upon yourself to direct his cure, which is of this kind, unless you be prudent in the art, compassionate, merciful, slow, not bold, and not presumptuous; and use only such medicines as sit on the aphorism's warm sides: and dismiss the sick with divine judgment.
Nisi uideas, aut speras salutem a perditione cum lenitate aegritudinis, et in quo apparet quiddam spei.	Unless you hope for salvation from perdition with gentleness of sickness, and in which there appears some hope of salvation.
Conare ergo reductionem eius statim in principio rei, antequam accidat apostema calidum.	Consider therefore the reduction of him at once at the beginning of the thing, before a warm aphorism happens.
Si ergo redit membrum, secundum quod uolumus, tunc administra regimen quod sedat apostema: et cura uulnus cum eo quod conuenit ei ex unguentis desiccatiuis.	But if the member returns, according to our directions, then administer a regime which sits on the aphorism; and care for the ulna with him when it suits him from an ointment of dried herbs.
Quod si dislocatio est cum fractura, et accidunt in osse satagiae separatae, tunc conare ablationem earum, et fac in illo quod diximus in aegritudinibus simplicibus ex eo quod praecessit in locis earum.	That if the dislocation is with fracture, and things in the bones separate, then consider removal of them, and do in him what we said in simple illnesses because it preceded in those places.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, et custodi teipsum ab introitu in uiam timoris: secundum quod praecessit praedicatio mea tibi.	And be careful according to your strength, and guard yourself from the entrance into a path of fear: because my prediction went before you.
Nam illud est melius tibi apud Creatorem tuum, et magis permanens ad gloriam tuam, et magis saluum tuo corpori apud illos in tuo tempore.	For that is better for you with your Creator, and more lasting to your glory, and more safe to your body with them in your time.
