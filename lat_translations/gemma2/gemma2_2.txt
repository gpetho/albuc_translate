Praefatio.	Preface.
Postquam compleui uobis o Filii, librum hunc, qui est postremus scientiae in medicina cum complemento ipsius, et consecutus sum finem in eo, ex expositionibus eius, et ipsius declarationibus, uisum est mihi, ut compleam ipsum uobis cum hoc Tractatu qui est pars operationis, id est, chirurgiae cum manu.	After I have completed for you, O sons, this book which is the last of knowledge in medicine with its completion, and I have reached an end in it, from its expositions, and its own declarations, it seemed to me that I should complete it for you with this Treatise which is a part of the operation, that is, surgery with the hand.
Quoniam operatio cum manu prostrata est in regione nostra, et tempore nostro priuata omnino: donec fortasse periit scientia eius, et abscissum est uestigium eius: et non remanserunt ex ea, nisi descriptiones paruae in libris antiquorum, quas mutauerunt manus: et accidit eis error et haesitatio, donec clausae sunt intentiones eius, et elongata est uis ipsius: Visum est mihi, ut uiuificem eam cum ordinatione huius Tractatus in ea secundum uiam ex positionis, et declarationis, et abbreuiationis: et ut ueniam cum formis ferramentorum Cauterii, et reliquorum instrumentorum operis: cum fit ex declarationis additione, et ex properatione eius quod est necesse.	Because surgery with the hand has been in our region and time completely deprived, until perhaps the knowledge of it perished, and its trace was cut off: and there remained from it, except for small descriptions in books of ancients, which were altered by hands: and error and hesitation happened to them, until their intentions were closed, and the force of it was lengthened. It seemed to me, that I should vivify it with the order of this Treatise according to the way of exposition, and declaration, and abbreviation: and that I should come to forms of cautery instruments, and the rest of instruments of work: with the addition of declaration, and the preparation of it which is necessary.
Caussa autem propter quam non inuenitur bonus artifex eius cum manu sua in hoc nostro tempore, est: quia ars medicinae est longa, et oportet auctorem eius exercitari ante illud in scientia anatomiae, quam narrauit Galenus, donec sciat iuuamenta membrorum, et ipsorum formas, et eorum coniunctionem, et separationem, et habeat cognitionem ossium, et neruorum, et lacertorum, et numerum ipsorum, et eorum egressionem, et uenarum pulsatilium, et quietarum, et locorum exitus earum.	The cause why a good artificer of this art is not found with his own hand in our time is: because the art of medicine is long, and it is necessary for its author to be trained beforehand in the knowledge of anatomy as Galen narrated, until he knows the workings of the limbs, and their forms, and their connection, and separation, and has knowledge of bones, and nerves, and tendons, and their number, and their emergence, and the pulsation of veins, and quiet ones, and the places of their exit.
Et propter illud dixit Hippocrates, quod nomen cum nomine est multum, et cum opere est paucum, et praecipue in arte manus.	And for this reason Hippocrates said that the name when it is with a name is much, and when it is with work little, and especially in the art of the hand.
Nos uero iam diximus de illo in introitu huius libri.	We have now spoken of that at the beginning of this book.
Quoniam qui non est sciens, quod diximus de anatomia, non euacuatur, quin iam cadat in errorem, quo interficiuntur homines: sicut ego uidi multos ex illis, qui formantur de hac scientia, et iactant se de ea absque scientia, et sine experimento.	For he who is not learned about what we have said concerning anatomy, cannot be purged but will fall into error, by which men are killed: just as I have seen many of those who fashion themselves from this science, and boast about it without knowledge, and without experience.
Quod est, quia uidi medicum stolidum secuisse apostema scrophulosum in collo mulieris, et incidit quasdam arterias in collo: quare fluxit sanguis mulieris, donec cecidit mortua inter manus eius.	That is, because I saw a foolish physician cut an abscess on the neck of a woman, and he struck some arteries in her neck; therefore blood flowed from the woman until she fell dead in his hands.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui praesumpsit ut extraheret lapidem uiro, qui processerat in aetate, et lapis erat magnus.	And I saw another physician who dared to remove a stone from a man who had reached old age, and the stone was large.
Peruenit ergo ad eum, et extraxit ipsum cum frusto uesicae.	Therefore it came to him, and he removed it with the bladder fragment.
Quare mortuus est uir in tertio die.	Therefore the man died on the third day.
Et ego quidem iam uocatus fueram ad extrahendum ipsum: et uidi ex magnitudine lapidis, et dispositione infirmi, quod moriretur.	And I indeed had been called to remove it; and I saw from the size of the stone, and disposition of the sick man, that he would die.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui accipiebat stipem apud quendam Ducum terrae nostrae propter medicinam: et accidit eunucho nigro, qui erat apud ipsum, fractura in crure eius prope calcaneum: et properauit medicus cum ignorantia sua, et strinxit fracturam super uulnus cum puluinaribus, et astellis strictura forti, et non dimisit uulneri expirationem.	And I saw another physician who was receiving a stipend from a certain Duke in our land for medicine: and it happened to an eunuch, black, who was with him, that he broke his leg near his heel: and the physician, in his ignorance, hastened, and bound the fracture over the wound with splints, and straps tightly, and did not allow the wound to breathe.
Deinde absoluit eum secundum desyderia sua.	Then he completed it according to his desires.
Postea dimisit eum diebus aliquot, et praecepit ei, ne solueret ligamentum: et stetit sic donec apostematum est crus eius, et ipsius pes, et peruenit ad perditionem.	Afterward he dismissed him for several days, and commanded him not to loosen the bandage: and he stood thus until the abscess had taken hold of his leg and foot, and came to ruin.
Vocatus sum ergo ad eum: et properaui ad soluendum ligamentum: et consecuta est tranquillitas, et euasit a doloribus suis.	Therefore I was summoned to him: and I hastened to solve the ligament: and there followed tranquility, and he was eased from his pains.
Verumtamen corruptio iam confirmata erat in membro: et non potui refraenare ipsam.	However, the corruption had already been confirmed in the limb: and I could not restrain it.
Pon ergo cessauit corruptio perambulare in membro, donec periit.	Therefore, when corruption has ceased to travel through the limb until it perishes.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui perforauit apostema cancerosum: et ulceratum est post dies, donec magnificata est malicia eius cum domino ipsius.	And I saw another physician who perforated a cancerous abscess; and it ulcerated after days, until the evil of it was magnified with its lord.
Quod est, quia quando est cancer purus ex humore melancholico, tunc non oportet ut perueniatur ad eum cum ferro omnino, nisi sit in membro quod toleret, ut abscindatur totum eius.	That is, because when a pure cancer is from melancholic humor, then it ought not to be reached with iron at all, unless it is in a limb which can bear to have the whole of it cut off.
Et propter illud o Filii, necesse est uobis, ut sciatis, quod operatio cum manu diuiditur in duas diuisiones: scilicet, operationem cui associatur salus: et operationem, cum qua est periculum in pluribus dispositionibus.	And because of this, my sons, it is necessary for you to know that an operation divided by hand into two divisions: namely, the operation which is associated with health; and the operation, with which there is danger in many dispositions.
Et ego iam excitaui in omni loco huius libri, in quo uenit operatio, in qua est terror et timor.	And I have now aroused myself in every place of this book, where there is an operation, which has fear and dread.
Quare necesse est uobis, ut caueatis illud, et dimitatis ipsum: ut non inueniant stolidi uiam ad loquendum, et dehonestandum.	Therefore it is necessary for you to avoid that, and halve it: so that fools do not find a way to speak and dishonor it.
Accipite ergo mensuram cum sollicitudine et protectione, et infirmos uestros cum facilitate et firmitudine, et utimini uia meliore perducente gratia Dei ad salutem et successionem laudabilem: et dimittite aegritudines terribiles difficilis sanationis: et tollite animas uestras ab eo quod facit uos timere, ut ingrediatur super uos haesitatio in fide uestra et commodo uestro.	Therefore, take measurements with care and protection, and your patients with ease and firmness, and use the better way leading through God's grace to health and a praiseworthy succession: and dismiss terrible illnesses of difficult healing: and remove your souls from what makes you fear, so that hesitation may enter upon you in your faith and your well-being.
Est enim magis remanens ad gloriam uestram, et sublimius in mundo isto, et postremo ad quantitates uestras.	It is indeed more enduring for your glory, and more sublime in this world, and finally to your quantities.
Galenus enim iam dixit in quibusdam suis admonitionibus.	For Galen indeed said in some of his instructions.
Non medicetis aegritudinem malam: ne nominemini medici mali.	Do not treat a bad illness: so that you are not called a bad doctor.
Iam autem diuisi hunc Tractatum secundum tria Capitula. ¶	Now however this Treatise is divided according to three Chapters.
Capitulum primum.	Chapter One.
De Cauterio cum igne, et Cauterio cum medicina acuta, capitulatum, et ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum, et ferramentis Cauterii: et omni quod necessarium est in operatione. ¶	Of cautery with fire and cautery with sharp medicine, chaptered and ordered from the head to the feet, and the forms of instruments and cautery tools: and everything that is necessary in the operation.
Capitulum secundum.	Second chapter.
De sectione et perforatione, phlebotomia et uentosis, et uulneribus: et extractione sagittarum, et similibus illius: et totum capitulatum, ordinatum formis instrumentorum. ¶	On incision and piercing, bloodletting and ventosa, and wounds: and the extraction of arrows, and similar things: and the whole chapter, arranged by forms of instruments.
Capitulum tertium.	Chapter three.
De restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus illius: capitulatum, ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum.	On restoration, and dislocation, and cure of twisting, and similar things: chaptered, ordered from head to foot, and forms of instruments.
Soli Deo Gloria.	Glory to God alone.
Liber Chirurgici Albucasis.	The Surgical Book of Albucasis.
Pars I.	Part I.
¶ De Iuuamento, et Nocumento Cauterii: et quibus complexionibus conueniat, et quo tempore: et si cum ferro, uel auro.	On the Benefit and Harm of Cautery: And What Complexions it is Suitable For, and at What Time: And Whether with Iron or Gold.
Caput I.	Chapter I.
Sed Ante Quidem Quam rememorer operationis cum eo, oportet ut dicam qualitatem Iuuamentorum eius, et Nocumentorum ipsius: et in qua complexione exhibeatur.	But before we recall the operation with him, it is necessary that I say the quality of his benefits, and harms, and in what complexion they are shown.
Dico ergo, quod sermo de qualitate iuuamenti Cauterii, et nocumenti eius, est sermo prolixus, et subtilis, scientia, et secretum occultum.	I say therefore, that the discourse on the quality of cautery and its effect is a lengthy and subtle science, and a hidden secret.
Etiam locuta fuit in eo multitudo sapientum, et dissenserunt in eo: et mihi quidem sufficit parum ex sermonibus eorum, timens prolongationem.	Even many wise men spoke about it, and disagreed about it; and for me enough is the little from their words, fearing a prolongation.
Dico ergo, quod Cauterium confert uniuersaliter omni complexioni, quae est cum materia, et absque materia: excaeptis duabus complexionibus, quae sunt complexio calida absque materia, et complexio sicca absque materia.	Therefore, I say that cautery is universally effective against every constitution, whether with matter or without matter, except for two constitutions: the hot constitution without matter and the dry constitution without matter.
In complexione autem calida et sicca cum materia dissenserunt.	When compounded with hot and dry material they disagreed.
Quidam enim dixerunt, quod Cauterium iuuatiuum est in ea.	Some have said that the cautery is helpful in this.
Et dixerunt alii contrarium illius, scilicet quod Cauterium non est conueniens in aegritudine, quae est ex caliditate et siccitate: quoniam natura ignis est caliditas: et inconueniens est, ut sanetur ex agritudine calida et sicca, cum calido et sicco.	And others said the opposite of this, namely that cauterization is not suitable in a sickness which is from heat and dryness, because nature is heat; and it is unsuitable for it to be healed from hot and dry sickness with heat and dryness.
Et dixit ille qui dicit contrarium illius: quod per Cauterium fit iuuamentum in omni aegritudine calida et sicca, quae accidit in corporibus hominum: quoniam quando tu comparas corpus hominis, et humiditates eius, ad complexionem ignis, inuenis corpus hominis frigidum.	And he who says the opposite of this said: that by cauterization benefit is done in all sickness hot and humid which happens in the bodies of men: because when you compare the body of a man, and its humidities, to the complexion of fire, you find the body of a man cold.
Et ego quidem dico per sermonem eius: quia ex perimentum iam detexit mihi illud aliquotiens.	And I indeed say through his discourse: because from experiment I have already found it many times.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut ueniat super illud, nisi qui iam probatus est, et exercitatus in capitulo Cauterii exercitio ultimo, et cognouit diuersitatem complexionum hominum, et dispositionem aegritudinum in se ipsis, et caussas earum, et accidentia ipsarum, et spacium temporis earum.	Nevertheless, it is not proper that he should come upon this, unless he who has already been proven and exercised in the last exercise of the chapter on cauterization, and has known the diversity of human constitutions, and the disposition of illnesses in themselves, and their causes, and accidents, and the space of time for them.
Ex reliquis autem complexionibus non est super uos timor: et praecipue in aegritudinibus frigidis et humidis.	Of the remaining mixtures there is no need for fear, especially in cold and moist diseases.
Iam enim conuenerunt omnes medici super eas: et non dissenserunt in iuuamento cum Cauterio in eis.	For now all the physicians have come together on these matters: and they have not disagreed in the help with cauterization in them.
Et scitote filii, quod ex secreto curationis per Cauterium cum igne, et bonitate eius super Cauterium cum medicina comburente est: quoniam ignis est simplex, cuius actio non peruenit, nisi ad membrum quod cauterisatur: et non nocet membro alio coniuncto cum eo, nisi nocumento paruo.	And know, sons, that from the secret of healing by cautery with fire, and its goodness over cautery with burning medicine, it is: because fire is simple, whose action does not reach unless to the member which is cauterized; and it does not harm another member joined with it, except for slight harm.
Medicinae uero comburentis actio peruenit ad illud quod elongatur ex membris: et fortasse facit accidere in membro aegritudinem difficilis sanationis, et fortasse interficit.	The action of burning medicine comes to that which lengthens from the limbs, and perhaps causes pain in the member that is difficult to heal, and perhaps it kills.
Ignis autem propter subtilitatem suam et bonitatem substantiae suae, non facit illud, nisi superfluat.	Fire, however, because of its subtlety and goodness of its substance, does not do it unless it is superfluous.
Iam uero innotuit nobis illud per experimentum, propter longitudinem seruitutis et studii cum arte, et stationem super ueritatem rerum: et propter illud excusor a longitudine sermonis.	Now we have ascertained this through experience, because of the length of service and study with the art, and the standing over the truth of things; and for this I excuse myself from the length of the discourse.
Et si non esset, quia non licet huic libro meo, afferrem uobis secretum occultum in igne, et qualitatem operationis eius in corporibus expulsionis suae, qua expellit aegritudines sermone philosophico demonstratiuo, qui acueretur a mentibus uestris.	And if it were not so, because it is not permitted to me in this my book, to bring you the secret hidden in fire, and the quality of its operation in bodies of its expulsion, which expels ailments by a philosophical and demonstrative discourse, that would accord with your minds.
Et scitote filii, quod ipsi dissentiunt in tempore, in quo conuenit fieri cauterium, et ponunt melius tempus ueris.	And know, sons, that they disagree about the time when it is fitting to do cauterization, and put forward a better time for truth.
Et ego dico, quod cauterium conuenit in omni tempore: propterea, quod nocumentum accidens propter tempus submergitur in iuuamento, quod attrahitur cum cauterio.	And I say that cautery is suitable at all times: because the harm caused by time is submerged in the benefit which is drawn with cautery.
Et praecipue si cauterium est propter dolores ex doloribus necessariis, fortibus, festinis, qui non tolerant tarditatem: propterea quod timetur ex eis, quod accidat malicia quae est maior, quam paruum nocumentum intrans propter tempus.	And especially if the cauterization is because of pains from necessary pains, strong and urgent ones which do not tolerate delay; because it is feared from them that a worse evil may occur, than a small harm resulting from time.
Et non cadat in mentibus uestris o filii illud, quod non extimant, nisi uulgus et stolidi medici, scilicet quod illi aegritudini quae sanatur per cauterium, non est reditio semper: et ponunt illud consequens, et res non est sicut putant: propterea quod cauterium non est, nisi loco medicinae, quae alterat complexionem, et exiccat humiditates quae sunt caussae, quare accidunt dolores.	And let it not enter your minds, O sons, that which the vulgar and foolish physicians fear, namely that in those sicknesses which are cured by cauterization, there is not always a return: and they place this as a consequence, and things are not as they think: because cauterization is, unless in medicine's place, which alters complexion, and dries up humidities which are the cause, wherefore pains occur.
Verumtamen cauterium superfluit super medicinam per uelocitatem ualetudinis suae, et uirtutem suae operationis, et uehementiam dominii sui: et possibile est, ut redeat aegritudo hora aliqua temporis secundum complexionem infirmi, et locationem aegritudinis suae, et uirtutem eius: et quod praeparatur in corpore eius ex aggregatione superfluitatum in eo: et quod peruenit ad ipsum in acquisitione sua ex cibis, et similibus illis ex caussis, nisi fit aegritudo, in qua administratur cauterium.	Nevertheless, a cautery is superfluous over medicine by the speed of its health, and the strength of its operation, and the violence of its domain: and it is possible that sickness may return at some time according to the complexion of the sick person, and the location of his sickness, and the virtue of it: and that which is prepared in his body from the aggregation of superfluities in it: and that which comes to him in its acquisition from foods, and similar things from causes, unless sickness occurs, in which cautery is administered.
Aegritudo subtilis in membro paucarum superfluitatum, et humiditatum, sicut cauterium dentis, propter dolorem, et similia illi, possibile est enim, ut non redeat in eo ille dolor.	A slight pain in a limb of little swelling and humidity, such as toothache, because of the pain, and things similar to it, for it is possible that the pain does not return there.
Sed illud fit in paucis.	But that is done in few cases.
At uero sermo uulgi iterum, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, est sermo rectus: non ad illud quod ipsi intendunt in illo: quoniam ipsi credunt, quod non est curatio quae conferat cum medicina, neque cum alio post occasum cauterii.	But again the common saying that cautery is the last resort of medicine is a correct saying: not for what they intend by it: because they believe that it is not a cure which can be compared with medicine, nor with anything else after the use of cautery.
Res autem est econtrario illius, et intentio, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, non est, nisi quod quando nos administramus modos curationis in aliqua aegritudinum, et non conferunt illae medicinae: deinde administramus in fine rei cauterium, et confert: tunc inde cadit, quod cauterium est postremum mediciuae, non secundum intentionem quam intelligunt uulgus et multistolidorum medicorum.	The matter is contrary to that which some think, and the intent is that cauterization is last in medicine, not because it is never used, but rather when we administer methods of healing for certain illnesses, and those medicines do not help; then at the end of the matter we administer cauterization, and it helps. Therefore it falls that cauterization is last in medicine, not according to the intention which the common people and many foolish physicians understand.
Antiqui autem dixerunt, quod cauterium cum auro est melius, quam cauterium cum ferro: et non dixerunt illud, nisi propter aequalitatem auri, et sublimitatem substantiae suae: et dixerunt, quod non facit pus locus cauterii.	The ancients said that a cautery with gold is better than one with iron; and they did not say this except because of the equality of gold, and the sublimity of its substance; and they said that it does not make pus the place of the cautery.
Verum non est illud absolute: quoniam ego iam probaui illud, et inueni, quod ipsum non facit illud in quibusdam corporibus absque aliis.	However, that is not absolutely true, because I have already proven it and found that it does not do that in certain bodies without others.
Et cauterium cum ipso est bonum, et melius quam cum ferro, sicut dixerunt.	And a cautery with itself is good, and better than with iron, as they have said.
Verumtamen quando tu ignis cauterium in igne ex auro, non declaratur tibi, quando ignitur secundum quantitatem quam uis, propter rubedinem auri: et quando properat ad ipsum frigus, et si addis super ipsum ignitionem, liquescit in igne, et uertitur in laminas.	However, when you heat the cautery iron in a fire of gold, it is not clear to you when it ignites according to the quantity that you wish, because of the redness of gold. And when it hastens toward itself the cold, and if you add on it ignition, it melts in the fire, and turns into laminas.
Quare cadit artifex ex illo in occupationem: et propter illud fit Cauterium cum ferro apud nos uelocius et propinquius, ex rectitudine ad operationem.	Therefore the artificer falls from that into the occupation: and for this reason cautery is made with iron among us quicker and nearer, from straightness to operation.
Et ego quidem iam ordinaui hoc Capitulum in Cauterio, secundum capitula: et ordinaui ea a capite usque ad pedes: ut alleuient quaerenti illud quod uult ex eo.	And I indeed have now arranged this Chapter on Cauterization, according to chapters: and I have arranged them from head to foot: that those seeking it may find what they want from it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Caput in commissura coronali.	On the way of cauterization of the head in the coronal suture.
Caput II.	Chapter II.
Confert hic cauterizatio ad dominium humiditatis et frigiditatis super cerebrum: quae duae sunt caussae sodae, et multitudinis fluxus humorum ex capite ad partes oculorum et aurium, et multitudinis somni, et doloris dentium, et doloris gutturis: et uniuersaliter omnis aegritudinis, quae accidit ex frigiditate, sicut paralisis, et sodae, epilepsiae, et apoplexiae, et similia illis ex aegritudinibus.	This application of cauterization addresses the dominion of humidity and coldness over the brain: which two are causes of dropsy and the abundance of fluid flow from the head to the parts of the eyes and ears, and the abundance of sleep, and toothache, and sore throat: and universally all ailments that occur from coldness, such as paralysis, and dropsy, epilepsy, and apoplexy, and similar ailments.
Modus cauterizationis est, ut praecipias infirmo: ut euacuetur in primis cum medicina solutiua mundificante caput tribus noctibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod exigit uirtus infirmi, et eius aetas, et consuetudo eius.	The method of cauterization is that you instruct the sick person to evacuate first with a cleansing solution medicine the head for three nights, or four, according to what demands the strength of the sick person, and his age, and his custom.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radi faciat caput suum cum nouacula.	Then bid him make a cut in his head with a knife.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas quadratum, ita quod iam posuit manus suas super pectus suum.	Then make him sit between your hands, so that he has already placed his hands over his chest.
Deinde pone radicem palmae tuae super radicem nasi sui inter oculos suos.	Then place the root of your palm over the root of his nose between his eyes.
Vbicumque ergo peruenerit digitus tuus medius, signa locum illum cum incausto.	Whenever therefore your middle finger shall have been injured, mark that place with a non-caustic.
Deinde igni Cauterium Oliuare: cuius haec est forma.	Then, a cautery of oil is made in the fire. Its form is this.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum signatum cum incausto, descensione, qua constringatur manus tua paulatim, et tu reuolues ipsum.	Then place it upon the marked spot with the unconstrained, descent, whereby your hand may be gradually tightened, and you turn it.
Deinde leua manum tuam uelociter, et aspicias locum.	Then lift your hand quickly, and look at the place.
Quod si uides iam detegi ex osse quantitatem capitis alkiel, aut quantitatem zeuherbi, tunc eleua manum tuam.	If you now see that from the bone the quantity of alkiel or the quantity of zeuherbi has been revealed, then raise your hand.
Et si non, itera manum tuam ferro ipso, aut cum alio ab ipso si infrigidatur: donec uideantur ossa, quae dixi tibi.	And if not, repeat your hand with the iron itself, or with another from itself if it cools: until you see the bones which I told you.
Deinde sume aliquid ex sale, et solue illud in aqua, et imbibe in ipso cotum, et pone super locum: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then take something of salt and dissolve it in water, and drink it into the same wound, and put it over the place: and let it stand for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, et dimitte illum super locum, donec destruatur eschara ignis.	Then place upon it a cloth soaked in butter and leave it on the spot until the fire has been destroyed.
Deinde cura illud cum unguento tetrapharmacon, usquequo sanetur.	Then care for it with ointment of four drugs until it is healed.
Iam dixerunt, quod quanto uulnus plus remanet apertum, emittit pus: quare est melius et magis iuuatiuum.	They have said that the greater the wound remains open, the more it emits pus, wherefore it is better and more helpful.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum, ut cauterizetur cutis usque ad os: et teneatur Cauterium, donec aduratur quiddam spissitudinis ossis.	And some of them said that the skin should be cauterized up to the bone, and hold the cautery until something of the thickness of bone is burned.
Deinde radatur post illud quod adustum est ex osse, deinde curetur.	Then, after that which was burned is removed from the bone, it is then cared for.
Et dicunt alii, quod oportet ut cum cauterio perueniatur ad ultimum, donec imprimat in os impressionem for tem, ita quod cadat os, quod fit sicut forma kirate: aut instrumentum quod mulieres ponunt infuso alphabeti parui: et extimant, quod exspirantur ex hoc loco uapores capitis, et dimittatur uulnus apertum tempore longo.	And others say that it is necessary that with the cauterizing instrument one should arrive at the very last point, until it imprints a form into the bone, so that the bone may fall off, which is done like the shape of a kirate: or an instrument that women put into the small alphabet infusion: and they believe that vapors of the head are exhaled from this place, and the open wound may be dismissed for a long time.
Deinde curetur, donec consolidetur.	Then it is cared for until it solidifies.
Mihi autem non uidentur hae duae species Cauterii omnino nisi in quibusdam hominibus secundum uiam timoris.	To me, these two kinds of cautery appear to be nothing but, in certain men, according to the way of fear.
Et dimittere ipsum, apud me est melius cum salute ipsius.	And it is better for him to be released, in my opinion, with his health preserved.
Debilitatur enim caput ex solutione continuitatis ipsius naturalis: sicut testificati sumus in reliquis membris: et praecipue quando caput infirmi debile est natura: et species quidem Cauterii prima est magis salua et melior apud me, et ea utor: operare ergo cum ea in salute.	The head is weakened from the breaking of its natural continuity, as we have testified in the other limbs; and especially when the head of the weak patient is naturally feeble. And indeed the first species of cautery is more salutary and better with me, and I use it; therefore operate with it in health.
¶ De modo cauterizandi capitis in dolore totius capitis.	On the method of cauterizing the head in pain throughout the head.
Caput III.	Chapter III.
Quando in toto Capite accidit dolor chronicus: et prolongatur illud in infirmo, et utitur hyeris, et cochiis, et caputpurgiis, et oleis, et empleumatis.	When a chronic pain occurs throughout the entire head: and it is prolonged in the infirm, and he uses leeches, and cauteries, and cephalic purges, and oils, and emplastrum.
Et praecipue si iam cauterizatum est cauterio uno, quod narrauimus, et non confert ei aliquid ex illis: tunc considera.	And especially if it has already been cauterized with one cautery, which we have narrated, and nothing helps it from those things: then consider.
Nam si caput infirmi est fortis creationis natura, et non est debile, et inuenit frigus uehemens: tunc cauteriza cum cauterio alio sub illo parum.	If the head of the patient is of strong constitution and not weak, and it finds intense cold, then cauterize with a cautery below it slightly.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio, do nec pertranseat cutis, et discooperiatur ex osse quantitas, quam narrauimus.	Then cauterize it over every horn of its head with a cautery, so that it does not penetrate the skin, and expose the quantity from the bone, which we have recounted.
Et cauteriza ipsum cauterio uno in occipitio capitis sui, in loco qui nominatur uas: et est locus in quo ponitur uentosa: et eleua matum tuam in hoc, et non discooperias os.	And cauterize him with one cautery on the back of his head, in the place which is called vas; and it is a place where the windpipe is put; and raise your mat here, and do not uncover the bone.
Infirmus enim inuenit propter illud dolorem uehementem, et diuersum a dolore reliquorum cauteriorum capitis omnium.	He found himself in pain because of this strong pain, and different from the pain of the rest of the burns on all parts of the head.
Et ego dicam hoc Cauterium in loco suo: et oportet quod sit cauterium, quo cauterizantur cornua capitis, et occiput eius subtilius cauterio, quo cauterizatur medium capitis.	And I shall say this about the cautery: and it should be a cautery, by which the horns of the head are cauterized, and the back of its head more subtly cauterized, than that with which the middle of the head is cauterized.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in hemicrania, tam cum medicina adustiua, quam cum ferro.	On the manner of cauterization in headache, both with a burning medicine and with iron.
Caput IIII.	Chapter IV.
Quando accidit in parte capitis dolor et soda, aut extenditur dolor usque ad oculum, et euacuatur cum medicinis mundificantibus caput, et administratur reliqua curatio, quam dixi in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert illud totum: tunc cauterizatio in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterizatio cum medicina acuta comburente: aut cum ferro.	When pain and swelling occur in the head region, or the pain extends to the eye, and the head is cleaned with purifying medicines, and the rest of the treatment is administered, which I have said in the divisions of illnesses, and this does not help at all: then cauterization in it is according to two modes: either cauterization with a burning sharp medicine: or with iron.
Cauterium autem cum medicina acuta comburente, est, ut accipias dentem unum allii, et excortices ipsum, et abscindas extremitates eius ex duobus lateribus.	But cautery with a sharp burning medicine is, to take one tooth from another and to scrape it, and cut off the extremities of it on both sides.
Deinde scinde locum doloris in tempore cum phlebotomo lato, donec fiat in eo locus sub cute, in quo dens capitur.	Then cut the place of pain with a wide lancet until a place under the skin is made where the tooth is caught.
Intromitte ergo eum in ipso sub cute, donec occultetur: deinde stringe super ipsum cum puluillo constrictione decenti, et dimitte ipsum quantitate quindecim horarum deinde solue eum, et extrahe allium, et dimitteuulnus duobus diebus, aut tribus: postea pone super ipsum cotum submersum in butyro, donec locus efficiat pus: deinde cura ipsum cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Therefore introduce it into the skin itself until it is covered; then tighten it above with a ball of constriction that is decent, and leave it for fifteen hours, then untie it, and remove it, and let the wound lie for two or three days; afterwards put upon it a poultice submerged in butter until the place forms pus; then care for it with ointment until it heals.
Et si uis fac illud cum quibusdam medicinis comburentibus, quas ego scripsi in tractatu duodecimo, de Medieinis adurentibus.	And if you wish to do it with some burning medicines, which I have written about in the twelfth treatise, on Burning Medicines.
Cauterizatio uero eius cum ferro, est secundum hunc modum.	The cauterization of it with iron is according to this manner.
Igni Cauterium, cuius forma haec est.	A burning cautery, whose form is this.
Et nominatur Clauilis: quoniam forma capitis eius est sicut forma claui, in quo est quiddam curuitatis, et in medio eius est quaedam eminentia parua.	And it is called Clauis: because the shape of its head is like the shape of a key, in which there is some curvature, and in the middle of it is a small prominence.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum, et retine manum tuam: et tu reuolue ferrum paulatim cum uelocitate: et sit quantitas quae aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, sicut medietas eius.	Then place it over the site, and hold your hand; and you revolve the iron gradually with speed; and let the quantity that is burned be as the thickness of the skin, as much as half of it.
Et eleua manum tuam, ut non aduratur arteria, quae est inferius, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And lift your hand so that the artery below is not burned and blood does not flow.
Deinde imbibe cotum in aqua salis, et pone super locum, et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus: deinde pone cotum cum butyro: postea cura cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Then soak a cloth in salt water, and place it over the area, and leave it there for three days; then place the cloth with butter: afterwards care with ointment until healed.
Et si uis, cauteriza hanc hemicraniam cum extremitate cultellari secunda Cauterii.	And if you wish, cauterize this hemicrania with the second end of the knife from the cautery.
Et caue ab incisione arteriae in hac hemicrania, non antiqua proprie.	And beware of cutting an artery in this headache, not one that is old properly.
¶ De modo cauteriezandi in hemicrania antiqua.	On the manner of cauterizing in old headache.
Caput V.	Chapter V.
Quando curas hemicraniam, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione praecedente, et quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio: et uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei quod diximus ex cauterio primo cum medicina, aut cum cauterio cum igne, tunc oportet ut ignias Cauterium cultellare, donec albificetur postquam signas super locum doloris cum linea, cuius longitudo sit medietas digiti, aut quasi illud: et depone manum tuam uice una, et stringe eam donec incidas arteriam, et peruenias usque ad os.	When you treat a headache, with that which we said from the preceding cure, and that which we said in the divisions of illnesses, and it does not help the cure: and you see from the illness, that what we said from the first cauterization with medicine, or with fire cauterization, is not sufficient, then it is necessary to use a knife cautery until it whitens, after marking the place of pain with a line, whose length is half a finger, or about that: and put your hand on one side, and squeeze it until you cut the artery and reach the bone.
Verumtamen necesse est tibi, ut caueas a continuatione mandibulae, quae mouetur apud masticationem, ne aduratur latus, aut neruus qui mouet ipsam, unde accidat spasmus.	Nevertheless it is necessary for you to avoid the continuation of the jawbone which moves during chewing, lest the side be burned or the nerve that moves it, whence spasm occurs.
Et esto super custotiam, et cautelam de fluxu sanguinis arteriae, quae abscisa est.	And let there be watch and caution of the flow of blood from the artery, which is cut.
In abscisione enim eius est timor, et praecipue ei qui ignorat illud quod facit, et non est studiosus, nec expertus: et dimittit operationem cum eo in primis.	For in the cutting away of it there is fear, and especially to him who does not know what he is doing, and is neither studious nor experienced; and he abandons the operation with this primarily.
Et ego ueniam cum rememoratione regiminis fluxus sanguinis accidentis ex arteria secundum modum suum, et in loco suo huius libri.	And I come with a remembrance of the regimen of blood flow accidents from the artery according to my manner, and in the place of this book of mine.
Quod si uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei hoc Cauterium, et uides corpus infirmi tolerans cauterium in medio capitis, sicut narrauimus, cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	If you see that from illness, the cauterization does not suffice for him, and you see the body of the sick person enduring the cauterization in the middle of the head, as we have narrated, take care of the wound until it is healed.
Et si uis, administra Cauterium, quod diximus in capitulo extractionis arteriae cum Cauterio habente duos cultellos.	And if you wish, administer a cautery, which we said in the chapter on extracting an artery with a cautery having two blades.
Est enim cauterizatio melior hac et magis conferens.	For indeed cauterization is better this way and more effective.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Aurium.	On the mode of cauterization in the pain of the Ears.
Caput VI.	Chapter VI.
Quando accidit in Aure dolor a frigore, et curatur cum solutiuis, et reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione, et non remouetur dolor, tunc igni Cauterium: et est illud quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma est haec.	When pain occurs in the ear due to cold and is treated with solutions and the rest of the care that we have said in the division, and the pain does not go away, then cauterize with fire: and this is what is called a Point, whose form is this.
Deinde puncta cum eo post eius ignitionem in circumitu auris totius, sicut reuoluitur: aut in circumitu utriusque, si simul dolor est in utrisque.	Then the points with it after its ignition around the ear whole, as it revolves; or around both if pain is at both.
Et elonga te cum Cauterio a radice auris parumper, postquam signaueris loca cum encaustro: et sit cauterii quantitas decem punctorum in omni aure, et quasi illa.	And lengthen yourself with the cautery from the root of the ear slightly, after you have marked the places with encaustic: and let the quantity of the cautery be ten punctures in each ear, and like that.
Deinde cura loca, donec sanentur.	Then care for the places, until they heal.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tortura.	On the manner of cauterization in torsion.
Caput VII.	Chapter VII.
Tortura quae curatur cum cauterizatione, non est nisi ex speciebus, quae accidunt ex phlegmate, secundum quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum.	A torture which is cured with cauterization is nothing except from the kinds that happen from phlegm, according to what we have said in the divisions of diseases.
Et deuita cauterizationem speciei, quae accidit ex exiccatione, et spasmo nerui.	And avoid cauterization of a kind that occurs from drying and spasm of the nerve.
Quando curas hanc speciem torturae cum hyeris, et caputpurgiis, et gargarismis, et non confert curatio tua, tunc oportet ut cauterizes infirmum tribus Cauteriis: uno apud radicem auris, et secundo parum inferius a timpore suo, et tertio apud coniunctionem duorum labiorum.	When you treat this kind of torture with hyenas, and head cleansers, and gargles, and your treatment does not help, then it is necessary that you cauterize the patient with three cauteries: one at the root of the ear, and a second slightly lower than its time, and a third at the junction of the two lips.
Et pone Cauterium tuum ex contrario partis infirmae.	And place your cautery from the opposite part of the weak.
Quoniam mollificatio non accidit, nisi in parte quae apparet sana.	Because softening does not occur unless in the part that appears healthy.
Et forma cauterizationis est, ut cauterizes ipsum Cauterio in directo extremitatis auris superioris sub cornu capitis parum: et alio in timpore: cuius longitudo sit secundum longitudinem pollicis.	And the form of cauterization is, that you cauterize it with a cautery in the direct extremity of the upper part of the ear under the horn of the head a little; and at another time: whose length should be according to the length of the finger.
Et depone manum tuam cum cauterio, donec comburatur quantitas medietatis spissitudinis cutis.	And lay your hand with the cautery until the amount of half the thickness of the skin is burned.
Et haec est forma Cauterii, et est species ex cultellari, cuius forma praemissa est: uerumtamen non est subtilior ea parum, sicut uides: et oportet ut sit cultellus in eo superfluae grossitudinis parum.	And this is the shape of the cauterizer, and it is a type from a knife, whose form is preceded: truly, however, it is not too subtle, as you see: and it ought to be that the knife in it is of superfluous thickness little.
Deinde cura loca, cum eo quod praecessit: donec sanetur.	Then care for the place, as that which preceded: until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Apoplexia antiqua.	On the method of cauterization in old apoplexy.
Caput VIII.	Chapter VIII.
QUando antiquatur Apoplexia, et curas eam cum eo quod diximus, et non confert medicatio tua, et infirmus non habet febrem, tunc cauteriza eum quatuor cauteriis super omne cornu capitis sui, et cauterio in medio capitis, sicut diximus, et cauterio in occipitio capitis, secundum quod praecessit: et modus cauterii sit secundum quod praecessit.	When Apoplexia has become chronic, and treatment with what we have said does not help, and the patient does not have a fever, then cauterize him with four cauteries on every horn of his head, and with a cautery in the middle of the head, as we have said, and with a cautery at the back of the head, according to what preceded: and the method of cautery shall be according to what preceded.
Etiam cauterizatur cum Cauterio super os stomachi: et est magis ultimum.	It is also cauterized with a cautery over the mouth of the stomach: and it is more ultimate.
Deinde curetur, cum eo quod praecessit.	Then he cares for it, as that which preceded.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Obliuione.	On the method of cauterizing in obliquation.
Caput IX.	Chapter IX.
Oportet ut in potu dentur in primis infirmo hyerae magnae, et pillulae mundificantes cerebrum.	It is necessary that in a drink be given first of all to the sick large sheets of wool, and pills that cleanse the brain.
Deinde rade caput infirmi totum, et pone super occipitium eius emplastrum de synapi descriptum in tractatu emplastrorum: et pone ipsum aliquotiens.	Then shave the head of the sick person entirely, and place on top of his occipital bone a plaster described in the treatise on plasters made from synapis: and place this several times.
Ipsum namque est modus Cauterii: et fac illud secundum ordinem eundem, quem dixi illic.	This is indeed the mode of cautery and perform it according to the same order which I said there.
Si ergo sanatur per illud, bonum est.	If therefore it is healed by that means, it is good.
Si non: tunc fac ei cauteria tria in posteriori parte capitis sui, quae sint descendentia a superiori parte capitis usque ad inferiorem partem oculi: et pone inter omne cauterium grossitudinem digiti.	If not, then make three cauteries on the posterior part of his head, which should be descending from the upper part of the head to the lower part of the eye: and place between each cautery the thickness of a finger.
Deinde cura Cauterium, cum eo quod praecessit.	Then take care of cauterization, as with what preceded it.
Si autem uis additionem, et infirmus est tolerans illud: tunc fac ei Cauterium in medio.	If you wish an addition, and the weak one tolerates it, then make a cautery for him in the middle.
Quod si uis additionem: tunc cauteriza ipsum super duo cornua.	If you wish an addition, then cauterize it over two horns.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: sitque Cauterium oliuare secundum formam, quae praemissa est.	Then care for it until it heals: let cautery be olive oil according to the form which has been set forth.

Deinde rade caput infirmi: postea cauteriza ipsum cauterio in medio capitis, et cauterio super omne cornu capitis, et cauterio super posterius ipsius, et tribus super spondiles colli.	Then shave the head of the patient; afterwards cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head, and with a cautery over every horn of the head, and with a cautery over its back part, and with three cauteries over the vertebrae of the neck.
Si autem indiges in aegritudine mollificatione corporis pluribus illis, et infirmus est tolerans, et aegritudo est fortis: tunc cauteriza ipsum quatuor cauteriis super spondiles dorsi, et ultima cum cauterio, donec comburatur ex cute plurimum eius, et eleua manum tuam.	If however you need in illness softening of the body by more of those things, and he is weak enduring, and the illness is strong: then burn him with four cauteries upon the vertebrae of the back, and the last with a cautery until it is burned from the skin most of it, and raise your hand.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: et sic cauterium Oliuare.	Then care for it until it is healed: and so cauterize with olive oil.

Caput XI.	Chapter XI.
Non Cauterizatur epilepticus, nisi ille cuius epilepsia est ex phlegmate.	An epileptic is not cauterized unless his epilepsy is from phlegm.
Oportet ergo ut mundifices cerebrum eius in primis cum hyeris, et cum reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione: quando infirmus est magnus, aut est tolerans in accaeptione medicinarum.	Therefore it is necessary that you cleanse the brain of him first with a hare's dung, and with the rest of the care which we have said in the division: when he is greatly ill, or is enduring in receiving medicine.
Si autem est puer, qui non tolerat medicinas, tunc administratur gargarisma, et masticationes mundificantes cerebrum, ante illud diebus multis cum bonificatione ciborum.	If it is a boy who does not tolerate medicines, then a gargle and cleansing chewing substances are administered for the brain, many days before with improvement of foods.
Deinde rade caput eius, postea cauteriza ipsum Cauterio uno in medio capitis, secundum quod praecessit in modo: et cauterio alio in occipitio eius, et super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio.	Then scrape the head of him, afterwards cauterize it with one cautery in the middle of the head, according to what preceded in manner: and with another cautery on the back of his head, and over every horn of his head with a cautery.

Et si caussa melancholiae est superfluitas decliuis ad melancholiam, et est corpus infirmi humectum, tunc da ei in potu quod mundificet cerebrum eius, secundum quod praecessit in diuisione: deinde rade caput infirmi, et fac postea tortellam decenter factam ex lino, sicut circulum.	And if the cause of melancholy is excess of phlegm to melancholy, and the body of the sick person is wet, then give him in a drink that cleanses his brain, according to what preceded in the division; then shave the head of the sick person, and afterwards make a compress properly made from linen, like a circle.

Deinde cauteriza ipsum super duo timpora duobus cauteriis, si est incaeptio descensus aquae in duobus oculis simul: aut ex latere uno, si est incaeptio aquae in oculo uno: et abscinde cum cauterio omnes uenas et arterias quae sunt sub cute: et sint cauteria in ea longa in latitudine timporum: et caue a fluxu sanguinis.	Then cauterize it over the two temples with two cauteries, if the beginning of water descending is in both eyes at once: or from one side, if the beginning of water is in one eye: and cut off with a cautery all the veins and arteries that are under the skin: and let the cauteries be long in the width of the temples: and beware of the flow of blood.
Quod si uides aliquid ex eo, tunc abscinde eum statim cum quacumque medicina est possibile: et ego ueniam cum sapientia, quae est in extractione arteriarum, et abscisione earum, et cautela a fluxu sanguinis.	If you see anything of that sort, then immediately cut it away with whatever medicine is possible: and I will come with the wisdom which is in the extraction of arteries, and their cutting, and caution against the flow of blood.

Quando lachrymae oculorum sunt antiquae, assiduae: et sunt super uenas, et arterias quae sunt in manifesto capitis exterius, uerificatur quod illud est ex superfluitatibus frigidis, phlegmaticis: tunc cauteriza cauterio eodem quod narraui in incaeptione aquae descendentis, cauterio in medio capitis, et duobus cauteriis super duo timpora, et duobus cauteriis in ceruice sub duobus ossibus.	When the tears of the eyes are old, continuous: and they are on the veins and arteries which are in the manifest head externally, it is verified that it is from superfluities cold, phlegmatic: then cauterize with a cautery the same as I narrated in the beginning of the descending water, a cautery in the middle of the head, and two cauteries on the two temples, and two cauteries in the neck under the two bones.

Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum supra duo supercilia parum duobus cauteriis in omni parte: et elongentur a duobus timporibus: et sit longitudo omnis cauterii, secundum longitudines supercilii: et non ultimes manum tuam cum cauterio, imo secundum quantitatem quod aduritur tertia palpebrae.	And if you wish, cauterize it above the two eyebrows with two cauteries in every part; and let them extend from the two temples; and let the length of each cauteris be according to the lengths of the eyebrow; and do not let your hand touch the cautery beyond the third eyelid.

¶ De modo cauterizandi Palpebram cum pili inuersantur pungentes oculum.	On the mode of cauterizing the eyelid when hairs turn inward and pierce the eye.
Caput XVII.	Chapter XVII.
Cauterium in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum igne: aut cauterium cum medicina comburente.	A cautery is done in two ways: either with fire cautery or with a burning medicine cautery.
In cauterio autem cum igne, praecipe infirmo ante illud, ut dimittat pilos suos, si est ex illis qui mundant eos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	In cauterization with fire, command the infirm person before it to let his hair go, if he is of those who trim them, until they are lengthened and made equal.
Si autem pungunt eum apud ortum suum: tunc constringe oculos eius cum uitta, ut non moueantur, donec nascantur.	If he is pricked at his birth place, then bind his eyes with a cloth so that they may not move until the birth has taken place.
Cum ergo nascuntur et aequantur, tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo: deinde signa super Palpebram oculorum eius cum encaustro, signo quod sit secundum figuram folii myrti: et sit principium signi prope pilos.	When therefore they are born and equalized, then place the head of the sick person in your bosom: then mark above the eyelid of his eyes with encaustic, a mark which is according to the figure of the myrtle leaf: and let the beginning of the mark be near the hairs.
Deinde pone cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum.	Then place a moistened cloth in white of egg: or in the mucus of psyllium over the eye.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	Then a cautery of fire, whose form is this.
Deinde cauteriza super figuram, quam signasti paulatim in uicibus multis, donec comburatur superficies cutis, quae est sicut figura folii myrti, totam apparentem proprie.	Then cauterize over the figure which you have marked little by little in many stages until the surface of the skin is burned, which is like the shape of a myrtle leaf, completely apparent properly.
Et signum sanitatis operis tui est: ut si uideas Palpebram oculi iam contrahi, et pilos eleuari apud puncturam oculi.	And the sign of the health of your work is: that if you see the eyelid already contracting, and hairs being removed at the point of the eye.
Eleua ergo manum tuam tunc: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Therefore elevate your hand then and let it rest for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur eschara.	Then place over it a poultice with butter, until the scab is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointment until it heals.
Quod si redeat aliquod ex pilis post horam, et mollificetur palpebra: tunc itera Cauterium super illum locum, sicut fecisti in primis.	If something returns from the hairs after an hour, and the eyelid softens: then repeat cauterization over that place, as you did at first.
Si autem pili sunt in inferiori: tunc cauteriza ipsam, donec eleuetur ad locum suum naturalem: et aequetur ut non pungant pili oculum.	If hairs are in the lower eyelid: then cauterize it until it is raised to its natural place: and it should be so that the hairs do not prick the eye.

Est ut praecipias infirmo, ut dimittat pilos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	It is as if you should instruct the sick one, so that he let down his hairs, until they are lengthened and made equal.
Fac ex charta de panno formam folii myrti.	Make from cloth a form of myrtle leaf.
Deinde accipe ex sapone cognito, et ex calce non imbibita ex unoquoque pondus uncia I aut quasi illud: deinde tere ea simul contritione bona, et fac illud cum festinatione, ut non infrigidetur.	Then take from known soap and from the unsoaked lime, a weight of an ounce from each; then rub them together well with good friction, and make it quickly, so that it does not become cold.
Deinde ex pande ex eo super chartam quam fecisti sicut formam folii myrti, et pone ipsum super palpebram oculi unius, aut duorum.	Then from the pad take from it onto the paper which you made like the form of a myrtle leaf, and place it over the eyelid of one eye, or two.
Et pone sub oculo cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: et caput infirmi sit in sinu tuo.	And place under the eye a pad soaked in albumin of egg; and let the head of the sick person be in your lap.
Et pone digitum tuum indicem super medicinam, et preme ipsum parumper.	And place your index finger upon the medicine, and press it for a short while.
Et tu moueas ipsum quotiens sentit infirmus mordicationem medicinae: quoniam inuenit eius mordicatio sicut ignis.	And you shall strike it as many times as the sick man feels the bite of medicine; for he finds its bite like fire.
Dum ergo perseuerat hoc quod ipse inuenit mordicatio, tunc dimitte medicinam, et moue ipsam cum digito tuo.	While therefore he persevered in that which he himself invented, biting, then let go medicine, and move it with your finger.
Cum ergo quiescit mordicatio, tunc remoue medicinam, et ablue oculum cum aqua.	When therefore the biting subsides, then remove medicine and wash the eye with water.
Et considera tunc, si uides palpebram eleuari, sicut eleuatur apud contractionem cum igne, aut cum incisione, est bene: et si non, tunc itera super ipsam ex medicina super locum, in quo non imprimit medicina, et non denigrat, donec aequetur operatio tua, et contrahatur oculus.	And consider then, if you see the eyelid raised, as it is raised with contraction with fire, or with incision, it is well: and if not, then repeat over it from medicine on the place, in which the medicine does not imprint, and does not darken, until your operation is equal, and the eye contracts.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur cutis adustionis.	Then place over it a cot with butter until the skin is burned away.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento diaphinicon, aut alio, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with diaphana ointment, or another, until it is healed.
Et necesse est tibi apud operationem, ut custodias ultima custodia, ne in oculum cadat aliquid ex medicina.	And it is necessary for you during surgery that you guard carefully, lest anything from the medicine fall into the eye.
Quod si mollificatur palpebra post dies, et pugnat ex capillis aliquid in oculo, tunc itera medicinam super illum locum, qui mollificatur ex palpebra proprie, sicut fecisti in primis.	If the eyelid softens after days, and something from the hair fights in the eye, then repeat the medicine on that place which softens from the eyelid itself, just as you did at first.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for him until he is healed.
Et haec est forma folii myrti.	And this is the shape of the myrtle leaf.
Et scias, quod oculi hominum diuersificantur in magnitudine, et paruitate.	And know that the eyes of humans differ in size and smallness.
Ergo secundum illud sit consideratio tua: et non occultatur uia rectitudinis illi, cui est studium de hac arte.	Therefore, according to this, let your consideration be: and the way of righteousness is not hidden from him who has a study in this art.

Sit concauum, sicut forma cannae pennae uulturis ab extremitate una, cum qua fit Cauterium: et si uis sit penetrans usque ad extremitatem aliam, et si uis sit sursum sic tenta.	Let it be concave, like the shape of a goose feather quill from one end, with which cautery is made; and if you wish, let it be penetrating to the other end, and if you wish, let it be raised upwards so.
Verumtamen hoc concauum est melius ad opus tuum.	Nonetheless this hollow thing is better for your work.
Deinde exprime fistulam, si est aperta, et extrahe ex ea saniem, et exicca ipsam: et si non est aperta, tunc aperi eam, et extrahe pus eius.	Then express the fistula if it is open, and remove the pus from it, and dry it; and if it is not open, then open it, and remove its pus.
Deinde pone tunc super eam Cauterium, quod fit ignitum ualde.	Then place upon it a cauterium, which is made very hot.
Et tene cum eo manum tuam parumper apud Cauterium ab oculo, ad partem nasi, ut non erret manus tua, aut inquietetur infirmus: et ponas Cauterium in adipe oculi, et corrumpas ipsum.	And hold your hand with it for a short time at the cautery by the eye, to the part of the nose, so that your hand does not stray or the sick man rests; and place the cautery in the fat of the eye, and corrupt it.
Si ergo peruenis in principio Cauterii tui usque ad os, erit bene.	If therefore you come at the beginning of your cautery up to the bone, it will be well.
Et si non: tunc itera Cauterium semel, aut bis, si indiges illo: et dimitte illud tribus diebus.	And if not: then repeat cautery once, or twice, if it requires it: and dismiss it for three days.
Deinde pone Cotum cum butyro, et cura ipsum cum unguento exiccatiuo, donec sanetur.	Then place a poultice with butter, and take care of it with a drying ointment, until it heals.
Quod si praeterierint ei quadraginta dies, et non sanatur: tunc pone super ipsum medicinam acutam corrosiuam, donec detegatur os: et rade ipsum secundum quod uenit in capitulo suo.	If forty days have passed and it is not healing, then put on top of it medicine sharp and corrosive, until the bone is uncovered; and scrape it according to what comes in its chapter.
Et est modus alius Cauterii fistulae, quem quidam primi dixerunt.	And there is another mode of cautery of a fistula, which some first said.
Intende ad locum fistulae, et finde ipsum: deinde pone in ipsam fissuram camahan subtile, id est, Cannulam subtilem, cuius forma haec est.	Attend to the place of the fistula, and find it: then place in its fissure a fine camel hair, that is, a fine cannula, whose form is this.
Et funde in ipsum quantitatem drachmae ex plumbo liquefacto, et tene manum tuam cum Canna retentione bona, et non moueatur infirmus omnino, ut non currat, uel perueniat plumbum liquefactum ad oculum eius.	And pour into it the quantity of a drachma of lead melted, and hold your hand with a good retaining cane, and let the sick man not move at all, so that it may not run, or the melted lead may reach his eye.
Et oportet ut ponas super oculum infirmi cotum infusum in albumine oui, aut in aqua.	And it is necessary that you place over the eye of the sick a compress soaked in albumin or in water.
Plumbum enim comburit locum fistulae, et sanat ipsam sanatione mirabili.	For lead, indeed, burns the place of the fistula and heals it with a marvelous healing.
Quod si sanatur fistula, cum eo quod diximus ex Cauterio, et curatione, est bonum.	If a fistula is healed, as we have said from cautery and treatment, it is good.
Et si non, tunc necesse est administrare foramen nasi, et reducere fistulam ad cursum nasi, secundum quod ueniet in loco suo sibi proprio.

When an abscess occurs at the root of the gum, or on the palate, or at the roots of the teeth: then it makes pus, and bursts; afterwards it matures, and pus runs, and a fistula is formed; afterwards cures itself, and no treatment helps in it, then it is necessary to apply cauteries according to the quantity that takes hold in the fistula.

And if you wish, immerse linen or wool felt in cold butter, and place it upon the aching tooth: and place upon it heated iron until the fire reaches the depth of the concavity of the tooth.
Cauterizatio autem eius cum igne est, ut intendas ad cannulam aeris, aut cannulam ferri.	The cauterization of it with fire is, that you bring it to a tube of air, or a tube of iron.

Et cauteriza cum eo cauterium unum, donec comburatur cutis tota, et perueniat ad siphac, donec egrediatur sanies tota: deinde cura ipsum curatione exiturarum, donec sanetur.	And cauterize with it one cautery, until the whole skin is burned, and it reaches the fascia, until all pus exits: then take care of its treatment of fistulas, until it heals.
Et non oportet ut hac cauterii specie utatur, nisi cuius studium in arte medicinae prolongatur: et per cuius manus concurrunt aegritudines istae cum experimento aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super huiusmodi operationem.	And it is not right that this cautery be used unless one's study in the art of medicine is prolonged, and by whose hands these pains occur with experience many times; then indeed let him dare to perform this kind of operation.
At uero dimittere ipsam, apud me est melius.	But to dismiss her with me is better.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Pleuresi.	On the method of cauterization in pleurisy.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter XXXI.
Dixerunt antiqui, cauterium cum radicibus aristolochiae ad Pleuresim frigidam secundum hunc modum.	The ancients said that a cautery with roots of asarum was applied to cold pleurisy in this way.
Et est, ut recipias ex radicibus aristolochiae siccae longae, radicem unam longiorem, quae ex ea inuenitur, et sit sicut grossitudo digiti.	And it is, that you receive from the roots of dried and long birthwort, one root longer, which is found in it, and let it be like the thickness of a finger.
Deinde submerge eam in oleo: et accende ipsam in igne.	Then immerse it in oil: and kindle it in fire.
Deinde cauteriza cauterio uno in eo quod est inter continuationem furculae cum collo, et duobus cauteriis paruis sub guidezi parum decliuibus ad partem, quae est sub barba.	Then cauterize with one cautery where it is between the continuation of the fork and the neck, and with two small cauteries under a slightly sloping guide to the part that is under the beard.
Et duobus cauteriis etiam in eo, quod est inter costam quintam et sextam decliuibus ad posteriora parumper: et cauterio alio in medio pectoris, et alio supra stomachum.	And with two cauteries also in that which is between the fifth and sixth ribs sloping toward the rear a little: and another cautery in the middle of the chest, and another above the stomach.
Et tribus cauteriis a posterioribus: uno in eo quod est inter duas spatulas: et duobus cauteriis a duobus lateribus pectoris, inferius cauterio quod est inter duas spatulas.	And with three cauteries from behind: one where it is between two spatulas: and two cauteries from the two sides of the chest, lower cautery which is between two spatulas.
Et non oportet ut comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit in manifesto cutis odorando.	And you ought not to press your hand with the cautery, indeed let it be in plain sight on the skin, smelling.
Et iam dixerunt quidam antiqui, quod ex hominibus sunt qui utuntur cauterio ex ferro simili radio: et igniunt, et intus mittunt ipsum in eo quod est inter costas, donec perueniatur cum eo ad ipsum apostema, et egrediatur sanies: sicut diximus in apostemate Epatis.	And some ancients have said that there are people who use a cautery from iron similar to a rod: and they ignite it, and put it inside where it is between the ribs, until it reaches the abscess with it, and pus comes out: just as we said in the case of an abscess of the liver.
Sed in hac perforatione cum cauterio est ex timore, quod aut moritur infirmus statim, aut accidit in loco fistula, cui non est sanatio.	But in this perforation with a cautery there is fear, that either the weak one dies immediately or it happens in place a fistula, which has no healing.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Splenem Caput XXXII.	On the manner of cauterizing the spleen. Chapter XXXII.
Quando tu curas aegritudinem splenis, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua, tunc cauterium in ea est secundum tres modos, qui omnes sunt recti.	When you treat the illness of the spleen, as we have said from the treatment in the division of illnesses, and your treatment is not effective, then cauterization in it is according to three ways, which are all right.
Quorum unus est, ut facias tria cauteria, aut quatuor lineando secundum longitudinem splenis secundum figuram cauteriorum Epatis, quorum praecessit figura.	Of which one is, to make three cauteries, or four lining according to the length of the spleen according to the figure of the cauteries of the Liver, whose figure preceded.
Et sit inter omne cauterium quantitas grossitudinis digiti, aut plus parum.	And let the amount of cautery be the thickness of a finger, or slightly more or less.
Et sit modus cauterii, quem diximus in cauterio epatis aequaliter.	And let the way of cautery be, which we said in the cautery of the liver, equally.
Et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio: et sit infirmus resupinus super dorsum suum.	And do not press your hand with the cautery: and let the weak one lie on his back.
Et modus alius de cauterizatione est: ut ignias cauterium habens duo uerua, quod diximus in capitulo dislocationis humeri: et eleua cutem, quae est in directo splenis, ubi peruenit cubitus infirmi sinister: et sit eleuatio tua qua eleuas cutem secundum latitudinem corporis, ut cadant cauteria secundum longitudinem corporis.	And another method of cauterization is: to have a cautery with two handles, which we said in the chapter on dislocation of the shoulder: and elevate the skin which is over the spleen, where the elbow of the left arm reaches; and let your elevation be according to the width of the body, so that the cauteries fall along the length of the body.
Deinde intromitte duo uerua ignita ualde, donec cum eis penetres cutem a parte altera: deinde extrahe cauterium: fiunt ergo cauteria quatuor.	Then insert two burning rods carefully until they penetrate the skin on the other side; then remove the cautery: therefore four cauteries are made.
Et si uis cauteriza cum cauterio alio habente tria uerua.	And if you wish to cauterize with a cautery having three handles.
Deinde cura cauterium postquam dimittis ipsum emittere pus diebus multis: est enim magis conferens quamque reliqua quae praecesserunt ex curatione.	Then care for the cautery after you let it discharge pus for many days: for it is more beneficial than all that preceded from healing.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Hydropisi.	On the method of cauterization in dropsy.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter XXXIII.
Cauterium non cadit in Hydropisi, nisi ascliti proprie.	Cautery does not fall into dropsy except with proper incision.
Quando tu curas Hydropicum cum modis curationis, quos diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, et cauterio uno super stomachum, et cauterio alio super epar, et cauterio super splenem, et cauteriis duobus post dorsum inter spondiles, et uno in directo pectoris, et alio in directo stomachi: et sit quantitas profunditatis cauterii propinqua spissitudini cutis.	When you treat Hydropsy with the methods of treatment which we have said in the division, and the treatment does not help, then it is necessary that you cauterize it with four cauteries around the navel, and one cautery over the stomach, and another over the liver, and one over the spleen, and two cauteries behind the back between the vertebrae, and one directly on the chest, and another directly on the stomach: and let the quantity of the depth of the cautery be near the thickness of the skin.
Deinde dimitte cauterium apertum, ut emittat pus tempore longo.	Then release the open cautery so that it may discharge pus for a long time.
Et non euacues infirmum a curatione post cauterium cum eo: quod oportet ut aggregentur ei duae intentiones: et festinabit ad ipsum sanatio cum auxilio Dei.	And do not remove the weak one from treatment after cauterization with him: for it is necessary that two intentions be joined to him: and he will hasten to himself healing with the help of God.
Forma uero cauterii cum quo cauterizatur uenter, sit clauilis: secundum quod praecessit forma eius: et illius cum quo cauterizatur dorsum, sit oliuaris secundum quod praecessit eius forma.	The shape of the cautery used to cauterize the abdomen should be a clamp, according to what preceded; and the shape of that one used to cauterize the back should be an olive, according to what preceded its form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Pedes, et Crura.	On the manner of cauterizing feet and legs.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter XXXIV.
Quando apostemantur in Hydropico, et replentur aqua citrina: oportet ut cauterizes super dorsum Pedis in nocrati, quae est inter auricularem et anularem: et eleua manum tuam cum cauterio, et non torqueas ipsum: deinde eleua manum tuam: et non iteres ipsum omnino.	When abscesses occur in the Hydropsy (a condition of fluid accumulation), and they are filled with yellow water: it is necessary to cauterize on the dorsum of the foot, which is between the auricular and annular areas: and raise your hand with the cautery, and do not twist it: then raise your hand: and do not repeat it at all.
Resudet enim aqua citrina, et sit cauterium secundum hanc formam.	The water will boil then, and let the cautery be according to this form.
Deinde fac super duo crura duo cauteria in omni crure, et fiat cauterium cum extremitate cultellari cauterii: et fiat cauterium secundum longitudinem cruris, unum sub genu, et alterum inferius eo, circiter medium cruris: et super omnem coxam cauteria duo: et dimitte cauterium apertum absque curatione tempore longo: ut resudet ex eo aliquod aquae: deinde cura ipsum cum reliquis quae diximus.	Then make on each of the two legs two cauteries in every leg, and let the cautery be made with the edge of the knife of the cautery: and let the cautery be made according to the length of the leg, one below the knee, and the other lower, about the middle of the leg: and on each hip two cauteries: and dismiss the open cautery without cure for a long time: so that something of water will be reduced from it: then care for it with the rest which we have said.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in solutione Ventris.	On the manner of cauterization in the solution of the abdomen.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter XXXV.
Quando est solutio uentris ex frigore et humiditatibus, donec debilitet uirtutes retentiuam et digestiuam, quae sunt in stomacho et intestinis: et curatur illud cum modis curationis, et non sanatur: et uides infirmum tolerantem cauterium exuberantis uirtutis, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio magno super stomachum suum, secundum quod praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi cum cauterio circuli, et quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici subtilibus, cum cauterio clauili subtili: et cauterio super alcatin supra alhosos magno, aut duobus cauteriis.	When there is a solution of the belly from cold and moisture until it weakens the retaining and digestive powers which are in the stomach and intestines: and it is cured with modes of cure, and it does not heal: and you see the infirm person enduring the cautery of exuberant virtue, then cauterize him with a great cautery above his stomach, according to what preceded in the cautery of the stomach with a circular cautery, and four cauteries around the navel fine, with a subtle cautery clauili: and a cautery above the alcatin above the alehosos large, or two cauteries.
Et si uides humiditates exuberantes, et infirmum tolerantem illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio super pectinem, et cauterio super omne ilium: et fortasse addes duo cauteria parua super stomachum prope magnum.	And if you see abundant moistures, and the patient bearing it weakly, then cauterize it with a cautery over the comb, and with a cautery over all of the groin; and perhaps add two small cauteries near the large stomach.
Est enim curatio proficiens, cuius iuuamentum non errat.	It is indeed a healing method whose benefit does not err.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Hemorroidas.	On the method of cauterizing hemorrhoids.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter XXXVI.
Quando in ano sunt Hemorroides antiquae multae, aut una, et sunt ex humoribus grossis, frigidis, aut humiditatibus corruptis, et curantur cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: tunc cauteriza tribus cauteriis super inferiorem spondilem dorsi sub almeidati parumper triangulatim, et cauterio sub umbilico quasi duobus digitis.	When there are many old hemorrhoids in the anus, or one, and they are from thick humors, cold ones, or corrupt humidities, and they are cured with what we said in the division, and the cure does not help: then cauterize with three cauterizations above the lower vertebra of the back under the slightly triangular almeidati, and cauterization below the navel like two fingers.
Et si cogitas, quod stomachus eius infrigidatus sit, et cibus eius non digeratur, et faciem eius uides apostemari, tunc cauteriza eum super stomachum cauterio magno, secundum quod praecessit: et cauterio super Epar eius, et alio super Splenem ipsius, cum cauterio clauili: et dimitte cauterium apertum tempore aliquo: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if you think that his stomach is chilled, and his food is not digested, and you see his face suppurating, then cauterize him over the stomach with a large cautery, according to what preceded: and cauterize him over his spleen, and another over his spleen, with a clauili cautery: and release the open cautery after some time: then care for him until he heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi althelul post abscisionem eorum.	On the method of cauterizing the  artery after its section.
Caput XXXVII.	Chapter XXXVII.
Quando tu abscindis althelul, tunc ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	When you cut the flesh, then apply the cautery of fire that is like a ray.
Deinde intromittite ipsum ignitum in ipsum althelul abscisum: et ultima manum tuam, donec perueniat cauterium ad orificium uenae, ex qua currit sanguis: fac illud semel, aut bis.	Then introduce the burning instrument into the cut flesh; and with your last hand, until the cautery reaches the opening of the vein from which blood runs, do this once or twice.
Si ergo althelul fuerint multa, tunc cauteriza unumquodque cauterio secundum quod narrauimus.	If therefore many ulcers are present, then cauterize each one with a cautery according to what we have narrated.
Deinde cura ea, cum eo quod confert eis ex unguentis, donec sanentur.	Then care for that, with what ointment it helps, until they are healed.
Et si cauterizas eum cauterio magno super alcatin, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if you cauterize him with a large cautery on linen, it is more ultimate in healing.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Fistulam in ano.	On the manner of cauterizing a fistula in the anus.
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter XXXVIII.
Quando non obedit infirmus sectioni et operi quod narrauimus in loco suo, et terretur ab illo, fortasse sanatur cum cauterio.	When the sick man does not obey the incision and operation which we have narrated in its place, and is terrified by it, perhaps he heals with cauterization.
Cum ergo accidit alicui Fistula, et antiquatur, currit pus ex ea, et humiditates corruptae.	When therefore it happens to someone that he has a fistula, and it becomes old, pus runs out of it, and corrupt humors.
Dignius ergo quod oportet est, ut probes eam cum tenta subtili.	Therefore it is fitting that you examine it with a fine probe.
Deinde cognosce quantitatem profunditatis eius cum tenta.	Then know the quantity of its depth with a probe.
Deinde ignias cauterium, quod est simile radio.	Then use cauteries of fire, which are like a ray.
Deinde intromit te ipsum ignitum in ipsam Fistulam et quantitatem in qua intrauit clauus.	Then introduce yourself, ignited, into the fistula itself and the quantity into which the nail has entered.
Et itera super eam cauterium, donec comburantur illa omnia corpora corrupta, semel, aut bis, aut ter, secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	And repeat the cautery on it, until all those corrupted bodies are burned, once, or twice, or three times, according to the quantity of your necessity.
Et custodi te ab adustione nerui, si est illic, aut uenae magnae: aut si Fistula uadit ad corpus uesicae, aut ad corpus intestini, tunc custodi te ab istis locis omnibus.	And guard yourself from burning the nerve if it is there, or the large vein: or if a fistula goes to the body of the bladder, or to the body of the intestine, then guard yourself from all these places.
Et non facias illud, nisi quando fistula est in loco carnoso: et cogitas, quia non est penetrans.	And do not do this unless there is a fistula in a fleshy place: and you consider that it is not penetrating.
Deinde cura locum usquequo sanetur.	Then care for the place until it is healed.
Si autem sigillatur locus, et abscinduntur ab eo materiae, et remanet sic tempore longo: tunc scias, quia iam sanatus est integre.	If, however, the place is sealed, and materials are cut away from it, and it remains so for a long time, then you shall know that it has been completely healed.
Et si non abscindunt ab eo materiae, tunc scias quia est penetrans, aut in profundo eius est os corruptum, aut quasi illud ex illis: quorum rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And if they do not cut away the matter from it, then know that it is penetrating, or there is a rotten opening in its depth, or like one of those: whose recollection will come in its place.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Renes.	On the manner of cauterizing the kidneys.
Caput XXXIX.	Chapter XXXIX.
Quando accidit in Renibus dolor ex frigore, aut ex uentositate grossa, et minuitur propter illud coius infirmi, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum super almethenem super ipsos renes, cauterio super omnem renem cum cauterio clauili, cuius praecessit rememoratio.	When pain occurs in the kidneys from cold or from a great wind, and it is lessened because of this ailment of the weak, then it is necessary that you cauterize it above almethenem above the kidneys themselves, with a cautery over the whole kidney with a cautery clauili, whose preceding mention has occurred.
Et fortasse cauterizamus ipsum secundo in ipso almeidatu.	And perhaps we shall cauterize it a second time within the flesh itself.
Quare uenient tria lineata.	Therefore, there will be three lines.
Ergo erunt magis ultima in iuuamento.	Therefore they will be more useful in the healing.
¶ De modo cauteritzandi Vesicam.	On the mode of cauterizing the bladder.
Caput XL.	Chapter XL.
Quando accidunt in Vesica debilitas, et mollificatio a frigo re et humiditatibus, donec non retineat infirmus urinam, tunc cauteriza ipsum in inferiori parte suminis super Vesicam, ubi incipiunt pili pectinis, et cauterio a dextra suminis, et alio a sinistra illius: et sit longitudo illius cauterizationis lateris secundum quantitatem nodi pollicis: et cauteriza ipsum cauterio inferiori dorsi, aut duobus cauteriis, si indiges illo: et sit secundum quod praecessit cauterium clauile.	When weakness and softening occur in the bladder due to cold and humidity until it no longer retains weak urine, then cauterize its lower part above the bladder where the hairs of the comb begin, and one cautery from the right side of the pubis, and another from the left of it: and let the length of this cauterization be according to the quantity of a knuckle; and cauterize it with a lower back cautery, or two cauteries if it is needed by that: and let the cautery be closed as before.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Matricem.	On the method of cauterizing the Matrix.
Caput XLI.	Chapter XLIX.
Quando accidunt in Matrice frigus et humiditates, et prohibetur per illud ab impregnatione, et corrumpuntur menstrua eius, et tardatur prouocatio eorum, et accidit ei apud aduentum eorum dolor, tunc oportet ut cauterizetur tribus cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, sicut diximus in cauterizatione uesicae, et cauterio super alcatim inferius dorso, aut duobus cauteriis: et sit cauterium clauile.	When cold and moisture occur in the womb and it prevents impregnation, and her menses are corrupted, and their arrival is delayed, and pain occurs to her at their advent, then it is necessary that she be cauterized with three cauteries around the navel, as we said in the cauterization of the bladder, and cauterium on a cushion below the back, or two cauteries: and let the cautery be clauile.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Ancham in dislocatione.	On the manner of cauterizing a wound in a dislocation.
Caput XLII.	Chapter XLII.
Quando effunduntur humiditates mucosae ad pixidem Anchae, et fiunt caussa exitus eius a loco suo: et signum illius est, quod prolongatur crus super alterum, quando comparantur adinuicem: et inuenitur locus dislocationis in eo uacuus.	When the mucous humidities are poured out to the Anchae  and become the cause of its exit from its place: and the sign of this is that one leg is lengthened over the other, when they are compared side by side: and the place of dislocation is found empty in it.
Oportet ergo ut cauterizes infirmum super pixidem Anchae ipsius cauterio simili circulo: postquam tu signas cum encaustro in circumitu pixidis, sicut reuoluitur: et ut cadat ipsa pixis in medio circuli.	Therefore, it is necessary that the one who cauterizes the diseased part above the margin of its own cautery makes a similar circle: after you have marked with encaustic on the circumference of the margin, as it turns: and so that the itself falls in the middle of the circle.
Et sit cauterium cuius forma praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi.	And let the cautery be of the form that preceded in the cauterization of the stomach.
Quod si tibi non est praesens hoc cauterium, tunc cauteriza ipsum tribus cauteriis, cum cauterio oliuari magno: et fiat cauterio profunditas secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis totius.	If you do not have this cautery at hand, then cauterize it with three cauteries, with a large olive-wood cautery, and let the depth of the cautery be according to the quantity of the thickness of the whole skin.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for him until he is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Sciatica.	On the method of cauterizing in sciatica.
Caput XLIII.	Chapter XLIII.
Quando accidit dolor in pixide anchae, et sunt caussa illius frigus et humiditates: et curatur infirmus cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, et antiquatur illud: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum ab humoribus grossis cum pillulis foetidis, aut cum pillulis artificialibus, et similibus.	When pain occurs in the hip joint, and the cause of it is cold and moisture: and the sick person is treated with what we have said in the division, and the treatment does not help, and it gets old: then it is necessary that you free the sick person from gross humors with fetid pills, or with artificial pills, and similar things.
Deinde cauteriza eum.	Then cauterize him.
Et modus cauterii in ea est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum medicinis adurentibus, aut cauterium cum igne.	And the mode of cauterization in it is according to two modes: either cautery with medicines that burn, or cautery with fire.
Cauterium cum igne, est secundum multos modos.	Burning with fire is according to many ways.
Quorum unus est, ut cauterizes super pixidem anchae ipsius tribus cauteriis triangulatis, secundum hanc formam.	One of these is, that you cauterize on a piece of wax of the anus with three triangular cauteries, according to this form.
Et fac eis profunditatem bonam, uel malam.	And make a good depth for them, or bad.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium quantitatis grossitudinis digiti: sitque cauterium oliuare.	And let there be a space which is between every cautery the thickness of a finger; and let the cautery be oiled.
Quandoque autem fit cauterium in medio super caput anchae ipsius.	Sometimes a cauterization is done in the middle above the head of the hip bone.
Quare sunt quatuor cauteria.	Therefore there are four cauteries.
Et si uis cauteriza cum circulo, cuius praecessit forma in cauterizatione dislocationis anchae, uno: ut sit circulus continens ancham totam.	And if you wish to cauterize with a circle, whose form preceded in the cauterization of the dislocation of the hip, one: so that it be a circle containing the whole hip.
Et combure spissitudinem cutis totius.	And burn the thickness of the whole skin.
Iste est modus cauterii in Sciatica, quando dolor est adhaerens anchae ipsi, et non extenditur usque ad coxam et crus.	This is the method of cautery for sciatica, when the pain adheres to the hip itself, and does not extend to the hip and leg.
Si autem extenditur usque ad coxam et crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis super coxam, super locum ad quem innuit illic infirmus, in quo est dolor, et cauterio tuo super cauillam quatuor digitis ad partem syluestrem parumper: et sit cauterium cultellare.	If it extends as far as the hip and leg, then cauterize it with two cautery instruments above the hip, above the place where the sick person indicates, where there is pain, and with your cautery over the tail four finger widths to the left side a little: and let the cautery be a knife-shaped one.
Et sit profunditas cauterii secundum profunditatem spissitudinis cutis.	And let the depth of the cautery be according to the depth of the thickness of the skin.
Quod si infirmus innuit quod dolor extenditur usque prope digitos pedis, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic ubi innuit cum cauterio puncti, tribus, aut quatuor, aut pluribus, si indiget illo.	If the patient says that the pain extends almost to the toes of the foot, then cauterize him there where he indicates with a cautery, point, three, or four, or more, if it is needed.
Et si innuit dolorem esse sub genu uersus crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic cauterio uno cultellari.	And if he indicates pain being under the knee towards the leg, then cauterize it there with a one-bladed knife cautery.
Et caue tibi in omni cauterizatione tua, ut non ultimes cum cauterio ad hoc ut comburas neruum, aut arteriam magnam, et attrahas per illud super infirmum nocumentum malum, aut contractionem.	And beware in all your cauterizations that you do not come to the extreme with the cautery so as to burn nerves, or a great artery, and draw through it upon the infirm a bad evil, or contraction.
Et ego quidem iam uidi unum et alium, ex eis qui cauterizauerunt supra cauillam, et ultimauerunt in cauterizatione, et inflatum est crus, donec tumor consecutus est pedem, et perforatus est totus, et corruptus est totus pes: deinde accidit solutio uentris, et mors post illud.	And I myself have seen one and another of those who cauterized above the tendo Achilles and continued in cauterization, and the leg became inflated until a tumor was formed on the foot, and the whole foot was perforated and corrupted; then there followed solution of the abdomen, and death after that.
Quod si dolor est in duabus partibus simul, cauteriza utramque secundum hunc modum.	If pain is in two parts at once, cauterize both according to this method.
Et sapientes quidam dixerunt in cauterizatione anchae, cuius cauterii iste est modus.	And some wise men have said concerning the cauterization of the anus, whose cautery this is the mode.
Fac simile samio ex ferro, cuius diametrus sit medietas palmi: et sit apud orificium suum secundum grossitudinem nuclei dactyli, aut minus parumper: et intra illud samium sit samium tertium.	Make a saw like this from iron, whose diameter is half a palm's breadth: and let it be at its opening according to the thickness of a finger's knuckle, or a little less: and inside that saw let there be a third saw.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne samium per quantitatem nodi pollicis: et sint samia aperta a duabus partibus: et sit altitudo eorum quasi nodus, aut duo nodi: et fac eis manubrium ex ferro decenter aptatum in samiis.	And let there be space which is between every stitch the amount of a finger's joint: and let the stitches be open from two parts: and let their height be like a knuckle, or two knuckles: and make for them a handle from iron properly fitted in the stitches.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Deinde igniatur in igne, donec rubeat, et proiiciat scintillas: deinde ponatur super pixidem anchae infirmo accubitato super latus sanum.	Then it is set on fire until it glows red and throws off sparks; then it is placed upon the wax of the healthy side lying over the ailing side.
Cauteriza ergo eum tribus cauteriis rotundis in uice una.	Therefore, cauterize him with three round cauteries in one vice.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then dismiss him for three days.
Postea emplastra cum butyro: et dimitte uulnus apertum diebus multis.	Afterwards apply plasters with butter and let the open wound be left for many days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointment until it heals.
Inquit Albucasis, hac specie cauterii o filii, parum usi sumus, propter terrorem aspectus eius: et propterea, quod paucos inuenimus qui expectent super ipsum.	Albucasis says, about this type of cautery, O sons, we have used it little, because of the fear of its appearance: and therefore, because we have found few who await upon it.
Verumtamen est ex bonis cauteriis ei qui suffert, et inuenit cum eo locum eius.	Nevertheless, it is good for those who suffer from burns and find a place for it with them.
Cauterium autem cum medicinis adurentibus est, ut tu facias duo samia habentia perforatam armillam, in quam descendit cardo portae eius ex aere, aut ferro, longitudo parietis: quorum in altitudinem eorum sint duo nodi, aut quasi ipsi.	The cautery however when with burning medicines is to make two samia having perforated armillas, into which descends the hinge of its door from brass or iron, the length of the wall:  in whose height there are two knots, or as themselves.
Et sit spacium quod est inter utraque quantitas grossitudinis digiti, et sint aperta inferius et superius: et sit quod contineant se adinuicem, secundum hanc formam.	Let there be a space between the two parts of the size of a finger's width, and let them be open below and above: and let them contain themselves against each other, according to this form.
Deinde depone eam super pixidem anchae, infirmo iacente super latus sanum.	Then place it upon the bed of the hip, the infirm lying on his sound side.
Et comprime manum tuam super pixidem anchae multum.	And press your hand upon the pimple of the anus much.
Deinde funde inter duos circulos ex aqua calida, quae sit calefacta cum igne parumper, et tene eam quantitate horae temporalis: et toleret infirmus mordicationem eius, et ipsius adustionem, nam ipse inuenit mordicationem sicut ignis, donec quiescat mordicatio.	Then pour between two circles hot water, which has been heated with fire a little, and hold it for the quantity of an hour's time: and let the sick person endure its biting and scorching, for he himself finds the biting as if from fire until the biting subsides.
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum instrumento, et absterge aquam calidam ab ancha tota cum aqua dulci: deinde dimitte illud tribus diebus.	Then raise your hand with an instrument and wipe away the hot water from the whole wound with sweet water; then let it be left alone for three days.
Et pone super illud butyrum, donec remoueatur nigredo adustionis: et dimitte illud diebus aliquot, et curret ex eo pus.	And place over this butter until the blackness of the burn is removed; and let it stand for several days, and pus will flow from it.
Est enim ultimum in iuuamento.	It is indeed the last thing in healing.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointments, until it heals.
Quod si extendatur dolor usque ad coxam, aut crus: fac ei statuam in eo quod continet aquam, secundum quod fecisti in ancha aequaliter.	If the pain extends to the hip or leg, make for him a splint in what contains water, according to how you made it even.
Et iste est modus aquae calidae: et ego iam scripsi eam in tractatu rectificationis medicinarum.	And this is the way of hot water: and I have already written it in the treatise on the rectification of medicines.
Sume alcali, et calcis non extinctae amborum ana partem unam: tere utraque, et pone ea in ollam nouam, cuius inferior pars sit perforata foramine uno paruo, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum radius: et pone sub fundo ollae ollam aliam uitreatam: et proiice super alcali et calcem ex aqua dulci, quod submergat utraque per digitum: post quam tu comprimas ea manu tua compressione bona: et dimite ollam, donec descendat aqua acuta inferiori parte ollae uitreatae.	Take alkali and unquenched quicklime, each one half a part: grind both, and place them in a new pot, whose lower part is perforated with a small hole, according to the quantity that will enter it [the radius]: and place under the bottom of the pot another pot vitrified. And pour over the alkali and quicklime from sweet water, so that both are submerged by a finger: after which you compress them with your hand good compression: and let go the pot until the sharp water descends to the lower part of the vitrified pot.
Deinde aggrega illam aquam totam, et proiice eam super aliam calcem: et cola, donec renouetur.	Then collect that whole water and pour it over another lime; and stir until it is renewed.
Ipsa enim erit tunc fortis acuitatis ualde, quae administratur in multis operationibus medicinae, et in cauterizatione reliquorum membrorum.	For it will then be very sharp and strong, which is administered in many operations of medicine, and in cauterizing the remaining limbs.
Quoniam efficit operationem ignis ipsius.	Because it performs the operation of fire itself.
Et ex medicinis sunt, cum quibus cauterizantur ancha, etiam sicut tesisie, et mel anacardi, et calx cum sapone, ita quod utraque sint permixta. ¶	And of medicines are those with which they cauterize wounds, just as with the testicles, and honey of cashew nuts, and lime mixed with soap, so that both are mixed together.
Et Galenus quidem narrando retulit, cuiusdam uiri ex antiquis curationem, qua curatus est dolor anchae et uenae sciaticae: et magnificauit esse eius ualde.	And Galen indeed narrating reported, of a certain man from ancient times, the cure by which he was cured of pain in the hip and sciatic vein: and magnified it to be very great.
Et dixit, quia non indiguit alia curatione, et quia sanatus est ex uice una, donec retulit, quia ipse fortasse intrauit balneum delatus, et exiuit ex eo iam sanus.	And he said that it did not need other treatment, and because it was healed from one application, until it returned, because perhaps he himself entered the bath brought in, and came out of it already healthy.
Et est, ut accipiatur ex seitaragi uiridi: et si non inuenitur uiride, sumatur siccum, recens: et teratur multum cum aliquanto adipe, et ponatur super ancham, ubi est dolor, aut crus, aut in coxa: et ligetur, et dimittatur quantitate trium horarum, aut per quantitatem quod sentiat infirmus sedationem adustionis.	And it is, as it is taken from the green seitaragi: and if it is not found green, take dry, fresh; and it is prepared much with a little fat, and put upon the place, where there is pain, or leg, or in the hip; and it should be left on for three hours or until the patient feels a burning sensation.
Deinde intromitte eum in balneum.	Then introduce him into the bath.
Cum ergo roridum fit corpus eius, intromitte ipsum in solium.	When therefore the body becomes damp, introduce it into the socket.
Nam dolor recedit, et sanatur.	For pain departs, and healing takes place.
Et scias, quia non oportet ut utatur aliquis cauterio cum istis medicinis, nisi post euacuationem corporis.	And know that no one should use a cautery with these medicines, unless after evacuation of the body.
Et Dioscorides qui dem dixit, quod stercus caprarum, quando cum eo cauterizatur uena sciatica, confert ei: et fit cauterium secundum hunc modum.	And Dioscorides said that when the sciatic vein is cauterized with goat dung, it helps; and the cautery is made in this way.
Sumatur lana, et imbibatur oleo antiquo, et ponatur super locum profundum, qui est inter pollicem pedis, et inter focile, et est propinquior focili.	Take wool, and soak it in old oil, and place it over the deep place which is between the thumb of the foot, and between the big toe, and it is closer to the big toe.
Deinde accipe stercus caprarum siccum, et inflamma ipsum in igne, donec fiat carbo.	Then take dry goat dung, and set it aflame until it becomes charcoal.
Deinde pone ipsum super lanam, et dimitte ipsum, donec extinguatur.	Then place him upon wool, and let him be, until it is extinguished.
Deinde itera illud.	Then again.
Non cesses ergo facere illud, usquequo perueniat sensus super mediatione usque ad ancham, et quiescat dolor.	Therefore, do not cease doing this until you feel sensation through the mediation up to the depth and rest of pain.
Et iste modus cauterii nominatur cauterium Vaccinum.	And this method of cauterization is called cautery of the Cow.
¶ De cauterizatione doloris Dorsi.	On cauterizing back pain.
Caput XLIIII.	Chapter XLIV.
Quandoque accidit dolor in Dorso ex caussis multis, aut a casu, aut a percussione, aut euacuatione superflua, et illis similibus, ex infusione materiei frigidae, et humidae: et cauterium quidem non cadit, nisi in hac specie sola, quae fit ex infusione materiei frigidae.	Sometimes pain occurs in the back from many causes, either from a fall, or a blow, or the evacuation of superfluities, and similar things, from the infusion of cold and humid matter: and cauterization does not apply except in this single case, which is caused by the infusion of cold matter.
Oportet ergo post euacuationem infirmi cum pillulis foetidis, et eis similibus, ut fiant super Dorsum, ubi est dolor, tres lineae secundum latitudinem almeidati ipsius, postquam signas cum encaustro in omni linea quinque cauteria, aut plura secundum quantitatem quae uenit ex tolerantia infirmi uirtute eius: et fiat cauterizatio cum cauteriopuncti.	Therefore, after evacuating the sick person with foul-smelling pills and similar ones, three lines should be made on the back where the pain is, according to the width of the patient's loin, after signs have been marked with encaustic paint on every line five cauteries, or more according to the amount that comes from the endurance of the patient's strength; and cauterization should be made with a cauterizer.
Et si uis, cauteriza tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor, cum cauterio clauili mediali, secundum hanc formam.	And if you wish, cauterize with three or four cautery instruments, with a medial clamp cautery, according to this form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in incaeptine Gibbositatis.	On the mode of cauterization in an incision of gibbosity.
Caput XLV.	Chapter XLVI.
Multotiens accidit haec aegritudo infantibus paruis.	This ailment often happens to young children.
Et signum incaeptionis eius in pueris est: quod accidit super eum strictura in anhelitu apud eleuationem, et motum: et inuenis in ultima spondilium Dorsi et nodorum eius, quod iam incaepit eminere super reliquos spondiles.	And the sign of its beginning in children is: that which happens above him constriction in breathing at elevation, and movement: and you find in the last vertebra of the back and its knots, which has already begun to protrude above the other vertebrae.
Cum ergo uides illud, et uis facere illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio quod sit circulus secundum hanc formam.	When therefore you see that, and wish to make that, then cauterize it with a cautery which is circular according to this form.
Et capiat cauterium super omnem partem spondilis aequaliter: et si uis cauteriza in circumitu spondilis cum cauterio puncti duas lineas, aut tres: et sint puncta propinqua adinuicem.	And let him take the cautery over every part of the spine equally: and if you wish cauterize around the spine with a cautery point two lines, or three: and let the points be close to each other.
Deinde cura locum, donec sanetur cum eo quod diximus.	Then care for the place until it heals with that which we said.
Et caue, ne administres cauterium in gibbositate, quae fit in spasmo nerui.	And beware, lest you administer cautery in the hump that arises from a nerve spasm.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Podagra, et doloribus iuncturarum.	On the manner of cauterization in gout and joint pains.
Caput XLVI.	Chapter XLVI.
Quando dolores iuncturarum sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, quae effunduntur ad cuiuslibet membra corporis, tunc quando accidunt dolores in pedibus, de consuetudine medicorum est, ut nominent illud Podagram proprie.	When pains in the joints are from cold moisture that flows to any limb of the body, and when they happen in the feet, it is customary for physicians to call it Podagra properly.
Cum ergo curatur Podagra frigidae caussae cum modis curationis, et non remouentur dolores, tune cauterium remouet eos.	When therefore gout is treated because of cold causes with methods of treatment, and the pains are not removed, then a cautery removes them.
Et est, ut cauterizes eum post euacuationem in circumitu iuncturae pedum, cauteriis multis: et sit cauterium Oliuare.	And it is, that you cauterize him after evacuation at the juncture of the feet, with many cauteries: and let the cautery be Olive oil.
Cuius haec est forma.	This is its form.
Et si indiges ut punctes super faciem pedis, tunc fac cum cauterio puncti.	And if you need to make points on the face of the foot, then make them with a cautery.
Quod si ascendunt dolores usque ad genua, aut reliquas iuncturas, et multotiens accidit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super omne genu tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor ab omni parte, cum hoc eodem cauterio Clauili.	If the pains ascend to the knees or other joints, and this often happens, then cauterize the entire knee with three or four cauterizations from all sides, with the same cautery as Claudius.
Si autem necessaria sunt tibi plura hoc cauterio, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	If you need more of this burning with a cautery, then burn it again with a cautery.
Et non submergas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit circiter spissitudinem cutis tantum.	And do not submerge your hand with the cautery, but rather let it be about the thickness of only the skin.
Si autem ascendunt dolores ad genua, et dorsum: tunc administra quod diximus ex cauterio in capitulo suo.	If however pains ascend to the knees and back: then administer what we have said from cautery in its chapter.
Quod si dolores sunt in manibus tantum, tunc puncta in circumitu focilium, sicut reuoluuntur duae lineae.	If the pains are only in the hands, then points are pricked around the circumference of the focus, as two lines revolve.
Si autem remanet ex doloribus in digitis, tunc puncta eos, super omnem nodum punctum, et super pectinem manus.	If pain remains in the fingers, then prick them above every node and on the palm of the hand.
Si autem ascendunt dolores post dies ad cubitos, aut ad humeros, tunc cauteriza utrosque ab omni parte.	If pains should rise after days to the shoulders or elbows, then cauterize both from every part.
Et non euacues infirmum ex regimine bono, ex recaeptione medicinarum.	And do not evacuate the infirm from good regimen, from receiving medicine.
Nam si bonum fiat regimen, et euacuetur phlegma, sanabitur auxilio Dei cum isto cauterio.	If a good regimen is followed and the phlegm is evacuated, it will heal with the help of God and this cautery.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Rupturis.	On the manner of cauterizing in ruptures.
Caput XLVII.	Chapter XLVII.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, et descendit intestinum, aut zirbum ad testiculum, et est illud incipiens propinquum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo dimittere comestionem in die suo.	When a rupture occurs in the groin and the intestine or testicle descends, and this is beginning to be near, then it is necessary for you to order the patient to abstain from eating on his day.
Et utatur ex lenientibus, quo descendat stercus a uentre suo.	And let him use gentle laxatives, so that stool descends from his belly.
Deinde sedeat inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et praecipe ei, ut teneat anhelitum suum, donec egrediatur, uel appareat zirbum, aut intestinum.	Then he should sit between your hands upon his back: and bid him hold his breath until it comes out, or appears, the tumor, or intestine.
Deinde reduc ipsum digitis tuis, et signa cum encaustro sub Ruptura super os pectinis, cum signo cuius extremitas sit similis medietati circuli ad superiora corporis.	Then reduce it with your fingers, and mark with encaustic under the fracture on the breastbone, with a sign whose extremity is similar to the half of a circle toward the upper body.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma, donec ueniat album, et proiiciat seintillas.	Then the fire cautery, whose shape this is, until it becomes white and throws sparks.
Deinde reduc intestinum, aut zirbum ad concauitatem suam.	Then reduce the intestine, or bowel, to its cavity.
Deinde ponat minister manum suam super locum, ut non exeat intestinum: et tu iam aperuisti inter crura infirmi, et posuisti sub eo puluinar, et seruiens alius super crura eius, et alius super pectus eius qui tenet manus.	Then the assistant places his hand over the place so that the intestine does not come out: and you have already opened between the legs of the sick person, and placed a cloth under him, and one servant on his legs, and another on his chest who holds his hands.
Deinde depone cauterium super ipsum signum, manu tua cum cauterio stante recta.	Then lay the cauterizer upon the very mark, with your hand holding the cautery straight.
Et tene ipsum, donec cum eo consequaris os: aut itera cum eo uice alia, si non consecutus fueris cum eo in prima usque ad os.	And hold it until you get to the bone with it; or repeat this with another instrument, if you have not reached the bone with it at first until you do.
Et prudenter obserua ab exitu intestini in hora cauterizationis tuae, ne comburas ipsum, et eueniat per illud super infirmum aut mors, aut malicia magna.	And carefully observe from the exit of the intestine at the hour of your cauterization, lest you burn it, and there may come through it upon the weak either death, or great evil.
Et scias, quod quando tu non consequeris cum cauterio os, non confert operatio tua.	And know that when you do not succeed with a cauterizing tool in closing the bone, your operation is of no use.
Et oportet ut sit cauterium infantium subtile, secundum mensuram eorum.	And it is necessary that the cautery for infants be fine, according to their measure.
Deinde cura cum reliquis unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care with the rest of the ointment, until it heals.
Et sit infirmus iacens super dorsum suum quadraginta diebus, donec sigilletur uulnus.	And let the infirm be lying on his back for forty days, until the wound is sealed.
Et oportet, ut ponas nutrimentum eius longitudine temporis curationis eius, quod leniat uentrem eius: ut non exeat intestinum apud conamen et egestionem.	And it is necessary that you put nourishment in him according to the length of time of his healing, so that he may soften his belly, so that it does not go out of the intestine at defecation and excretion.
Deinde quando uult surgere post quadraginta dies, tunc administra ligamentum decenter factum, et teneat ipsum quadraginta diebus aliis.	Then when he wishes to rise after forty days, then administer a properly made bandage and have him hold it for forty days again.
Et minoretur a labore, et repletione cibi et potus, et uocibus uehementibus.	And he should abstain from labor and repletion of food and drink, and loud voices.
Nam quando utitur hoc regimine, ita sanatur sanatione integra.	For when this regimen is used, it heals with complete healing.
Et ego dicam curationem Rupturarum cum incisione in capitulo suo.	And I will say the treatment of ruptures with incisions in its chapter.
Quando autem Rupturae accidunt in reliquo uentre, et sunt incipientes, et uis ut non addantur, tunc cauteriza Rupturam eius cauterio rotundo secundum quantitatem eius: et sit illud quod aduritur ex tunc sicut tertia eius.	When ruptures occur in the rest of the abdomen, and they are beginning, and you wish that they not be added to, then cauterize the rupture with a round cautery according to its size: and let that which is burned from then on be as one third of it.
Deinde cura ipsum, cum eo quod diximus: et non addetur.	Then care for it as we have said: and nothing more be added.
Et iam dixerunt quidam primi: ut cauterizetur Ruptura cum cauterio triangulato, secundum hanc formam.	And now some first said that a rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cautery, according to this form.
Postquam signatur cum encaustro, et ponitur linea quae est per latitudinem in latere superiori Rupturae, et linea altera ad inferius.	After it is marked with wax and a line which is across the width on the upper side of the rupture is placed, and another line below.
Et depone manum tuam in medio cum cauterio clauili.	And place your hand in the middle with a closed cauterizer.
Sed cauterium primum est facilius et melius.	But a cautery is first easier and better.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in doloribus propter casum, aut percussionem.	On the manner of cauterization in pains caused by a fall, or percussion.
Caput XLVIII.	Chapter XLVIII.
Quando accidit in quibusdam membris a casu, aut percussione dolor: et perseuerat ille dolor tempore longo, et non confert in eo curatio cum medicinis: tunc oportet ut cauterizetur cum cauterio Puncti.	When pain occurs in certain limbs from an accident or blow, and that pain persists for a long time, and does not help with treatment with medicines: then it is necessary that it be cauterized with a pointed cautery.
Et sit cauterium omnis membri cauterium secundum magnitudinem eius, et ipsius paruitatem, et debilitatem eius, et ipsius uirtutem, et locationem torsionis, et doloris ex eo.	And let the cautery of every limb be a cautery according to its size, and its suitability, and its weakness, and its strength, and the location of the torsion, and the pain from it.
Si ergo sanatur ex cauterio primo, est bene.	If therefore it is cured by the first cautery, it is well.
Si non: tunc itera super ipsum cauterium.	If not, then repeat cauterization over it.
Quoniam de consuetudine horum dolorum est, ut permutentur ex membro ad illud quod appropinquat ei.	Because it is customary for these pains to shift from one limb to another that is near it.
Quare oportet ut consequaris eos cum cauterio, donec sanetur infirmus.	Therefore it is necessary that you follow them with a cautery until the sick person heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Lepra.	On the way to cauterize in leprosy.
Caput XLIX.	Chapter XLIX.
Leprosi autem quandoque iuuantur cauterio iuuamento maximo.	Leprosy is sometimes helped by cautery with great benefit.
Et praecipue species Leprae, quae fit propter putrefactionem phlegmatis et melancholiae: cum ergo uis cauterizare ipsam considera.	And especially the kind of leprosy, which is caused by the rotting of phlegm and melancholy: therefore when you wish to cauterize it, consider this.
Si ergo Lepra est ineipiciens, et curasti eam cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non descendit, neque stat: et times super infirmum, quod comprehendat corruptio super totam complexionem eius: tunc cauteriza eum super caput quinque cauteriis: uno in medio capitis noto, et secundo inferius eo uersus frontem apud finem capillorum, et duobus super duo cornua, et uno posterius super nucea ceruicis.	If therefore leprosy is incurable, and you have treated it with what we said in the division, and it has not descended nor stood; and you fear over the infirm that corruption will encompass the whole complexion of him: then cauterize him on the head with five cauteries: one in the middle of the head known, and a second below toward the forehead at the end of the hairs, and two above the two horns, and one behind on the nape of the neck.
Et ultima manum tuam cum cauterio parumper, donec imprimat in os impressionem paruam, et dislocentur ex eo cortices: ut alleuietur expiratio uaporum grossorum ex eo, et cauteriza cauterio etiam super ipsum splenem, secundum quod praecessit.	And lastly your hand with the cautery briefly, until it makes a slight impression in the bone, and the layers of skin are separated from it, so that the expiration of thick vapor from it may be alleviated, and cauterize also the spleen with the cautery, as above.
Sin autem Lepra iam sparsa est super infirmum, et apparet manifeste: tunc oportet ut cauterizes cum istis cauteriis, quae diximus in capite, et cauterio super extremitatem nasi, et duobus cauteriis super duas maxillas, et duobus cauteriis super spondiles colli, et sex super spondiles dorsi, et uno magno super alhahosos apud gran caudae et uno supra ipsum, in ipso almeidati: et duobus super anchas: scilicet super omnem ancham uno, et duobus super genua: uno super omne genu, et duobus super humeros, et duobus super cubitos, et duobus super teneritudines pectoris sui: et cauteriza ipsum super omnem iuncturam, ex iuncturis digitorum manuum suarum, et pedum suorum: et cauteriza super omnem calcaneum pedum suorum, et focilia manuum suarum.	If leprosy has already spread over the infirm person, and appears manifestly: then it is necessary that you cauterize with these cauteries which we have said in the beginning, and a cautery on the extremity of the nose, and two cauteries on the two maxillas, and two cauteries on the vertebrae of the neck, and six on the vertebrae of the back, and one large one on the bones near the root of the tail and one above it, in the very middle: and two on the buttocks; namely, on every buttock with one, and two on the knees; one on every knee, and two on the shoulders, and two on the forearms, and two on the tendernesses of his chest: and cauterize him on every joint, from the joints of the fingers of his hands, and feet: and cauterize on every heel of his feet, and wrist of his hands.
Et caue tibi a neruis qui sunt super postremum calcanei, ut non comburas eos.	And be careful of the nerves which are above the heel bone, so that you do not burn them.
Et quandoque cauterizatur cauterio super os pectinis, et alio super os stomachi, et alio super epar.	And sometimes it is cauterized with a cautery above the bone of the breastbone, and another above the bone of the stomach, and another above the ribs.
Et scias, quod quanto plus addis cauterium, est magis iuuamentum, et magis conferens.	And know that the more you add cauterium, it is more helpful and more effective.
Et scias, quod infirmus non inuenit in cauterio dolorem, sicut inueniunt ipsum sani: propterea, quod corpus eius iam stupefactum est.	And know that the infirm does not find pain in cauterization as they who are healthy find it, because the body of him is already numbed.
Et oportet ut sint cauteria ex magnitudine, et paruitate secundum membra et iuncturas: secundum quod praecessit ex speciebus ferramentorum.	And it is necessary that the cauteries be of size and shape according to limbs and joints; as was said previously from the kinds of instruments.
Deinde cura cauterium ex farina herbi cum melle, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care is taken with a cautery made from herb flour and honey, and the rest of the treatment, until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Stupore.	On the manner of cauterization under anesthesia.
Caput L.	Chapter L.
Quando stupet aliquod membrum, et curatur cum medicinis, et oleis, et emplastris, et non sanatur, tunc cauteriza ipsum membrum stupefactum cauteriis, secundum quod meretur magnitudo membri, aut paruitas eius.	When a certain limb is numbed, and it is treated with medicines, and oils, and plasters, and does not heal, then cauterize that numbed limb with cauteries, according to what the size of the limb deserves, or its smallness.
Et sit cauterium tuum intrans in spissitudinem cutis parumper.	And let your cautery be inserted into the thickness of the skin a little.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointment until it heals.
Et quandoque cauterizatur ad quiddam stuporis, qui accidit manui, et pedi, in spondilibus dorsi apud exitum neruorum, qui mouent illud membrum: et remouetur stupor.	And sometimes it is cauterized to a certain numbness, which happens to the hand and foot, in the shoulder blades of the back at the exit of the nerves that move that limb: and the numbness is removed.
Verum non praesumat super illud, nisi qui est sapiens in anatomia membrorum, et egressione neruorum mouentium corpus.	Truly, he should not presume over it, unless he is wise in the anatomy of the limbs, and the exit of the moving nerves from the body.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Albaras.	On the method of cauterizing in Albaras.
Caput LI.	Chapter LI.
Quando antiquatur Albaras, et non confert in eo aliquid ex ingeniis medicinae: tunc cauteriza super ipsam cauterio profundo parumper, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis, donec remoueatur albedo, et mutetur color eius.	When Albucasis says this and does not contribute something from the minds of medicine: then cauterize above it with a deep cauterization for a short time, according to the quantity of the thickness of the skin, until the white is removed, and its color is changed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum farina herbi, et lentis cum oleo rosa, et foliis arnoglossae, et sanguine columbae, et sanguine hyrundinis: de unoquoque sit pars una: misceantur haec omnia, et liniantur super pannum, et adhaereant loco, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with flour of herb, and lentils with rose oil, and arnoglossae leaves, and dove blood, and swallow blood: let each be one part: mix all these things, and spread them on cloth, and adhere to the place until it heals.

Sapientes autem dixerunt, ut cauterizetur cauterio ultimo in medio.	Wise men have said that it should be cauterized with the last cautery in the middle.
Mihi autem non uidetur illud: quoniam timeo quod ulceretur: et ego iam uidi illud aliquotiens.	It does not seem right to me because I fear that it would ulcerate, and I have already seen this happen several times.
Et rectius est, ut cauterizetur in circumitu eius cum circulo, sicut diximus: aut cauteriis multis.	And it is more correct that it be cauterized around it with a circle, as we have said; or with many cauteries.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Adubelati.	On the method of cauterizing in Adubelati.
Caput LIII.	Chapter LIII.
Quando aliquis habet Adubelati, et tardatur in maturatione, aut propter superfluitatem facientem eam, aut propter aetatem infirmi, quando est decrepitus pauci sanguinis, aut propter tempus, et uis festinare in maturatione Adubelati, tunc cauteriza in circumitu eius cum cauteriis paruis multis punctando.	When someone has an abscess and it delays in ripening, either because of the excess matter causing it, or because of the age of the patient, when he is old with little blood, or because of time, and one wishes to hasten the ripening of the abscess, then cauterize around it with small cauteries punctating many times.
Deinde dimitte eam.	Then let it go.
Nam ipsa festinabit cum maturatione.	For itself it will hasten with ripening.
Si autem uis perforationem eius cum cauterio, tunc igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma.	If you wish to make a perforation of it with a cautery, then ignite the cautery, which has this form.
Et depone ipsum in medio Adubelati, donec penetret cutem: et sit cauterium ab eo quod sequitur infirmus, ut alleuietur cursus puris.	And place it in the middle of the Abulati, until it penetrates the skin; and let the cautery be from what follows weak, so that the course may be eased with pure.
Deinde cura ipsum donec sanetur.	Then care for him until he is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in malo corrodente.	On the manner of cauterizing in a bad gnawing wound.
Caput LIIII.	Chapter LIII.
Corrodens non est nisi corruptio in membro ambulans, et corrodit ipsum: sicut ignis comedit ligna sicca.	Consumption is nothing but corruption in a limb that walks, and it eats into it; just as fire consumes dry wood.
Si ergo uides corrodentem in loco qui toleret cauterium cum igne, tunc igni cauteria multa, clauilia parua et magna, secundum quod conueniet illi loco in quo est corrodens.	If therefore you see a lesion in a place that will bear cautery with fire, then apply much cautery with fire, small and large clamps, according to what is suitable for the place in which the lesion is.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum ab omni parte donec eradices corruptionem totam, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid penitus.	Then cauterize it from every part until you eradicate the entire corruption, and let nothing of it remain at all.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super loca cauterizata sulphur tritum cum oleo, donec eradicentur escharae omnes, et omnis corruptio.	Then dismiss him for three days, and put over the cauterized places sulfur rubbed with oil, until all the scabs are eradicated, and all corruption is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis generantibus carnem.	Then care for him with ointments that generate flesh.
Si ergo uides, quod post tres dies caro nascitur natiuitate sana, in qua non est corruptio, est bonum.	If therefore you see that after three days flesh is born with a healthy birth, in which there is no corruption, it is good.
Et si non: tunc itera cauterium super illud quod remansit ex locis corruptis.	And if not: then apply a cautery again upon that which remains from the places corrupted.
Et corrodens medicatur quandoque cum medicina acuta.	And it is sometimes treated with a sharp medicine when it corrodes.
Ipsa namque surgit loco cauterii.	For it rises in place of cautery.
Verumtamen cauterium cum igne est uelocioris iuuamenti: et ego quidem iam dixi cauterizationem eius cum medicina acuta in diuisione: accipe ergo eam illic quando ea indiges.	Nevertheless, cauterization with fire is more rapid healing; and indeed I have already said cauterization of it with sharp medicine in division: therefore accept it there when you need it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Clauis, et Verucis.	On the method of cauterizing in nails and warts.
Caput LV.	Chapter LVII.
Multotiens accidit in inferioribus partibus pedum haec aegritudo: et est res grossa, filtrata, quae laedit pedem.	Often this ailment happens in the lower parts of the feet: and it is a thick, filtered thing, which hurts the foot.
Et cauterium quidem in eis est secundum duos modos: cauterium cum igne, et cauterium cum aqua calida.	And indeed a cautery is used in these two ways: cautery with fire, and cautery with hot water.
Quantum autem cum igne est, ut ignias cauterium concauum simile pennae uulturis: quod fiat ex ferro, secundum quantitatem quod contineat clauum ab omni parte: et sit subtilium marginum.	As much as it is with fire, so the cautery should be like a concave feather of an eagle's wing, made from iron according to the quantity which contains the nail on all sides and have a subtle margin.
Deinde depone ipsum ignitum super clauum.	Then place it burning upon a stake.
Deinde reuolue manum cum cauterio in circumitu claui, donec perueniat cauterium ad profunditatem claui: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, donec incipiat emittere pus.	Then roll the hand with a cautery around the nail, until the cautery reaches the depth of the nail; and let it go for three days, until it begins to discharge pus.
Deinde emplastra ipsum cum maluis syluestribus, contritis cum sale: et dimitte emplastrum super ipsum in nocte.	Then place a plaster on it with willow bark and pounded salt, and leave the plaster over it at night.
Ipse enim eradicabitur ex radicibus suis.	For it will be eradicated from its roots.
Deinde cura locum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then care for the place with a healing ointment until it is healed.
Quod si sunt non conuersi, et multotiens accidunt in superficie corporis, praecipue in manibus et pedibus: tunc administres in eis cauterium cum aqua calida: et est, ut accipias cannulam ex aere, aut ferro, aut ex penna uulturis: et depone eam super clauum, aut althelul.	If they are not converted, and often happen on the surface of the body, especially in the hands and feet: then administer cauterium to them with hot water: and it is, that you take a tube from copper, or iron, or from the quill of a vulture: and lay it upon a nail, or an althelul.
Deinde proiice in cannulam ex aqua calida quantitatem paucam: retine manum tuam, et tu reuolue eam cum compressione manus tuae parumper, ut imprimatur margo cannulae in radice claui, et inueniat aqua calida uiam ad profundum, ad radicem claui: et expectet infirmus parumper super mordicationem aquae calidae hora una.	Then pour a small quantity of hot water into the tube: hold your hand and roll it with the compression of your hand for a short time so that the edge of the tube is imprinted on the root of the nail, and the hot water finds its way to the deep, to the root of the nail: and let the patient wait for a short time over the application of the hot water for one hour.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, nam clauus eradicatur cum radicibus suis.	Then let it go, for a claw is eradicated with its roots.
Ita fac cum eis uno post unum, donec uenias super omnes qui ex eis sunt in corpore.	Thus do with them one after another, until you come upon all who are in the body from among them.
Deinde cura eos postquam eradicantur, cum eo quod generat carnem ex unguentis.	Then care for them after they are removed, with that which generates flesh from ointment.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tremore.	On the manner of cauterizing in tremor.
Caput LVI.	Chapter LXVI.
Quando accidit alicui Tremor ex frigore in neruo, aut ex febre quartana, aut alio: tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis, aut quinque super spondiles dorsi, et inter omnem spondilem cauterio, et in pectore eius cauterio, et super stomachum eius cauterio.	When someone has a tremor from cold in the nerve, or from quartan fever, or otherwise: then it is necessary that you cauterize it with four cauteries, or five on the vertebrae of the back, and between every vertebra with cautery, and on his chest with cautery, and on his stomach with cautery.
Tremor enim quiescit cum cauterio oliuari, et festinat sanitas aegritudinis frigidae.	For tremor rests with a clyster of oil and health hastens in cold sickness.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Albathir.	On the manner of cauterizing Albathir.
Caput LVII.	Chapter XLVII.
Quandoque expelluntur in corpore Albathir foedae, id est, pustulae, quae fiunt a materiis grossis corruptis.	Sometimes foul matter, that is, pustules, are expelled from the body of Albathir, which are made from corrupted thick substances.
Oportet ergo in primis cum apparent, ut cauterizentur super omne caput pustulae cauterio subtili cum ligno myrti, cuius extremitas accensa est cum igne.	Therefore it is necessary at first when they appear, that the head of every pustule be cauterized with a fine cautery of myrtle wood, whose end has been set on fire with fire.
Aut cum radice aristolochiae longae.	Or with the root of long birthwort.
Aut cum cauterio lenticulari.	Or with a lentil-shaped cautery.
Et quandoque cauterizantur ademenul, in principio expulsionis suae secundum hunc modum: et non augentur: et disrumpitur superfluitas faciens eos, et sanatur ex eis.	And sometimes, when the boils are cauterized at the beginning of their discharge, in this way: and they do not increase; and the superfluousness is broken by them, and it heals from them.
Verumtamen oportet ut fiat illud post euacuationem cum phlebotomia.	Nevertheless, it ought to be done after evacuation with bloodletting.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fluxu sanguins ex arteria in uulnere.	On the manner of cauterizing a flow of blood from an artery in a wound.
Caput LVIII.	Chapter LVIII.
Multotiens accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, quae incisa est apud uulnus, quod accidit extrinsecus, aut apud incisionem apostematis, aut cauterium membri, et similia eis: et fit difficile abscindere eum.	Often there is a flow of blood from the artery which has been cut at a wound, whether it happens externally, or at the incision of an abscess, or cauterization of a limb, and the like; and it becomes difficult to stop it.
Cum ergo accidit alicui illud, tunc propera cum manu tua ad orificium arteriae, et pone super ipsum digitum tuum indicem: et stringe eum multum, donec obsessus sit sanguis sub digito tuo, et non egrediatur ex eo aliquid.	When this happens to someone, then hasten with your hand to the opening of the artery, and place your index finger upon it: and press it very hard until the blood is stopped under your finger, and nothing comes out from it.
Deinde pone in ignem cauteria oliuaria parua, et magna numero plura: et suffla super ea, donec fiant ignita ualde.	Then place in the fire a small oil-burning cautery, and many more; and blow over them until they are well ignited.
Deinde accipe ex eis unum, aut paruum, aut magnum, secundum uulnus et locum, in quo disrupta est arteria, et depone cauterium super ipsam uenam, post quam tu remoues digitum tuum festinanter: et tene cauterium, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then take from them one, or a little, or much, according to the wound and the place where the artery is broken, and place the cautery over the vein itself, after which you remove your finger quickly: and hold the cautery until the blood is cut off.
Quod si expellatur cum eleuas digitum ab orificio arteriae, et extinguis cauterium, tunc accipe cauterium aliud festinanter, ex cauteriis quae in igne sunt praeparata.	If it is expelled with the finger from the opening of the artery and the burning cautery is extinguished, then take another cautery more quickly, prepared from cauteries which are in fire.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum uno post aliud, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Therefore, do not cease doing it with one after another until the blood is cut off.
Et caue, ne comburas neruum qui est illic, et accidat super infirmum malicia alia.	And beware, lest you burn the nerve that is there, and an other evil befall the sick person.
Et scias, quod quando ex arteria fluit sanguis, tunc non est possibile abscindere ipsum: praecipue quaudo arteria est magna, nisi cum uno quatuor modorum.	And know that when blood flows from an artery, then it is not possible to cut it off except with one of four ways.
Aut cum cauterio, sicut diximus.	Or with a cautery, as we said.
Aut cum extractione, quando non est extracta.	Or with extraction when it is not extracted.
Nam quando extrahitur, contrahuntur extremitates eius, et abscinditur sanguis.	For when it is drawn out, the extremities of it contract, and blood is cut off.
Aut ligetur cum filo ligatione forti.	Or it may be tied with a strong ligature of thread.
Aut ponantur super ipsum medicinae de proprietate, quarum est abscindere sanguinem, et stringatur cum puluinari constrictione decenti.	Or let medicines of property be placed upon it, which are for cutting blood and tie it with a ligature in a proper manner.
Qui autem administrat abscisionem eius cum ligamento, et strictura cum panno, aut positione rerum comburentium, et similium, non confert ei penitus, nisi raro.	He who administers the cutting away of it with a bandage, and constriction with a cloth, or the placing of burning things, and similar things, does not completely apply it, except rarely.
Si autem accidat alicui illud, et non sit ei praesens medicus, neque medicina: tunc incipiat cum positione digiti indicis super orificium uenae ipsius, sicut narrauimus, et constrictione eius ualde, donec obsessus sit sanguis a superiori parte uulneris, et super arteriam.	If it happens to someone and there is no present physician, nor medicine: then begin with the position of the index finger over the opening of the vein of himself, as we have narrated, and constriction of it greatly, until the blood is stopped from the upper part of the wound, and over the artery.
Et digitus non remoueatur, desuper ipsum cum aqua frigida uehementis frigoris semper, donec congeletur sanguis, et ingrossetur, et abscindatur.	And the finger should not be moved, and it is to be always moistened from above with cold water of vehement coldness until the blood congeals and thickens, and it is cut off.
Et interim consideret in eo, quid indiget ex cauterio, aut ex medicina.	And meanwhile let him consider in it what is needed from cautery, or from medicine.
¶ Partis Primae Finis.	End of the First Part.
Liber Chirurgici Albucasis Pars II.	Book of Surgery by Albucasis Part II.
¶ De Incisione, Perforatione, et Phlebotomia in uulneribus, et his similibus.	On Incisions, Puncture, and Bloodletting in Wounds, and Similar Conditions.
Iam Diximus in Capitulo Primo, omnem aegritudinem in qua conueniens est cum igne cauterium et medicina comburente, et occasiones eius, ipsius caussas, et instrumenta eius, et formas cauteriorum.	We have said in the first chapter all about illness in which it is fitting to combine cautery with fire and burning medicine, and its opportunities, its causes, and its instruments, and the forms of cauteries.
Et posui illic capitula a uertice usque ad pedem.	And I placed heads there from the crown to the foot.
Et ego procedam in hoc capitulo illa eadem uia: ut alleuietur super quaerentem quaesitum eius.	And I shall proceed in this chapter along the same path so that he who seeks may find what he is looking for.
Et antequam incipiam illud, oportet ut addiscatis o filii, quod in hoc capitulo est ex terrore illud quod est in capitulo primo de cauterizatione.	And before I begin this, it is necessary that you learn, O sons, that in this chapter there is the same thing as in the first chapter on cauterization.
Et propter illud oportet, ut sit cautela in eo uehementior, quoniam in operatione quae est in hoc capitulo, multotiens cadit euacuatio cum sanguine, cum quo stat uita apud apertionem uenae, aut incisionem super apostema, aut apertionem exiturae, aut curationem uulneris, aut extractionem sagittae, aut incisionem super lapidem, et illis similia: ex quibus omnibus associatur tremor, et timor, et cadit in pluribus eorum mors.	And for this reason, it is necessary that caution be taken with greater diligence, because in the operation which is in this chapter, very often evacuation occurs with blood, by which life stands at risk during the opening of a vein, or incision over an abscess, or opening of a fistula, or healing of a wound, or extraction of an arrow, or incision over a stone, and similar things: from all of which there accompanies trembling, and fear, and in many of them death occurs.
Et ego moneo uos, ne cadat super uos illud in quo est haesitatio, nam quandoque cadunt ad uos in hac arte modi hominum cum modis infirmitatum.	And I warn you, let not that which is in doubt fall upon you, for sometimes men with ways of sickness come to you with ways of this art.
Ex eis enim est qui irascitur cum aegritudine sua, et est leuis apud eum mors: propter uehementiam eius quod inuenit ex infirmitate sua et longitudine eius maliciei.	From these things there is one who becomes angry with his sickness, and for him death is light; because of the vehemence he finds from his infirmity and length of his malice.
Et cum aegritudine est ex timore quod significat mortem.	And with pain is fear that means death.
Et ex eis est, qui dat tibicensum suum, et ditat te cum eo, sperans sanitatem, et aegritudo eius est perniciosa.	And of these there is one who gives his tibiae and nourishes you with it, hoping for health, and his sickness is pernicious.
Non ergo oportet ut consentiatis ei qui uenit ad uos ex eis, cuius modus est talis.	Therefore, you ought not to consent to him who comes to you from those, whose manner is such.
Et sit cautela uestra uehementior, quam cupiditas et uestra rapacitas.	Let your caution be greater than your greed and avarice.
Et non praesumatis super aliquid ex illo, nisi post scientiam certam, quae uerificat apud uos illud ad quod peruenit successio laudabilis.	And do not presume anything from that, unless after certain knowledge which verifies with you that which to which it has arrived a praiseworthy succession.
Et utimini in curatione omnium infirmorum uestrorum, prognosticatione et indicatione de eo ad quod conuenienter sit salus.	And attend to the care of all your sick, with prognosis and indication of that which is fitting for their health.
In illo namque est uobis adiutorium super acquisitionem famae et gloriae, et memoriae et laudis.	In this therefore is your help above the acquiring of fame and glory, and memory and praise.
Inspiret uobis Deus o filii, intellectum suum, et non auferat uobis directionem et inspirationem: quoniam illud est in manu eius.	May God inspire you, sons, with his understanding, and may he not take away from you guidance and inspiration; for that is in his hand.
Et ego quidem ordinaui hoc Capitulum distinguendo per capitula, secundum quod praecessit in capitulo Cauterii, a ceruice usque ad pedes: ut alleuietur uobis quaesitum quod uultis ex eo, et quo indigetis.	And I indeed have ordered this Chapter by dividing it into sections, according to what preceded in the chapter on cautery, from the neck to the feet; so that the seeking which you want from it and in which you need it might be eased.
¶ De curatione Aquae quae aggregatur in capitibus puerorum.	On the cure of water that collects in the heads of children.
Caput I.	Chapter I.
Scias, quod haec infirmitas multotiens accidit pueris apud partum: aut quando stringit obstetrix caput pueri absque leuitate.	Know that this infirmity often happens to boys at birth or when a midwife squeezes the head of the boy without lightness.
Et quandeque accidit etiam ex caussa occulta quae non scitur.	And whenever it happens also from a hidden cause which is unknown.
Et ego quidem non uidi hanc aegritudinem in aliis quam in pueris: et ad omnem quem ex eis uidi properauit mors: propter illud ergo uisum est mihi dimittere operationem in ea.	And I indeed did not see this ailment in others than in children: and to every one whom of them I saw it hastened death: therefore it seemed good to me to omit the operation in it.
Et ego quidem uidi ex eis puerum, cuius caput impletum erat aqua, et caput magnificabatur in omni die, donec non poterat sedere super seipsum, propter magnitudinem capitis sui: et humiditas augmentata fuit, donec mortuus est.	And I myself saw among them a boy whose head was filled with water, and his head grew larger each day until he could no longer sit on himself because of the size of his head; and the moisture increased until he died.
Et haec quidem humiditas, aut aggregatur inter cutem et os: aut aggregatur sub osse super sifac.	And this moisture indeed either gathers between the skin and bone: or it gathers under the bone over the fascia.
Et operatio in illo, si est humiditas inter cutem et os, et apostema est paruum, tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis fissura una in latitudine: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo nodi, donec currat humiditas.	And the operation on this, if there is moisture between the skin and bone, and the abscess is small, then it is necessary that you make a fissure in the middle of the head, one in width: and let the length of the fissure be as two knots, until the moisture runs.
Et haec est forma spatumilis.	And this is the shape of a spatula.
Si ergo humiditas est magis augmentata, et apostema est maius, tunc pone eas duas fissuras, secundum formam hanc.	If therefore the humidity is more increased, and the abscess is greater, then place those two incisions, according to this form.
Et si humiditas est sub osse, et signum eius est, quod uides commissuras capitis apertas ab omni parte: et aqua deprimitur quando comprimis eam manu tua ad interiora, et non occultatur tibi illud: tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis tribus fissuris, secundum hunc modum.	And if the moisture is under the bone, and its sign is that you see the seams of the head open from every part: and water is depressed when you press it with your hand to the interior, and it does not hide from you: then you must make three fissures in the middle of the head, according to this manner.
Et post incisionem extrahe humiditatem totam.	And after incision, remove the entire humidity.
Deinde stringe fissuras cum pannis et puluillis.	Then bind the fissures with cloths and wool.
Deinde embroca illud desuper cum uino et oleo usque ad diem quintum.	Then stitch it above with wine and oil until the fifth day.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et cura uulnus cum tentis, et unguentis.	Then loosen the ligament, and take care of the wound with a bandage, and ointment.
Et non dimittas stringere caput cum aequalitate.	And do not let go of tightening the head with equality.
Et ciba infirmum omni cibo sicco paucae humiditatis, usquequo confortetur membrum, et sanetur.	And feed the sick with every dry food of little moisture, until the limb is strengthened and healed.
Et modus alius incisionis est, ut consideres ubi apparet magnitudo apostematis, et collectio aquae.	And another way of cutting is, that you should consider where the magnitude of the abscess appears, and the collection of water.
Quoniam quandoque est in occipitio plus, aut in sincipite, aut in dextra, aut in sinistra.	Because sometimes it is in the back of the head, or on the forehead, or on the right, or on the left.
Ascende ergo cum incisione ubi apparet tibi apostema et impletio aquae: et scinde illud secundum quod tibi possibile est.	Therefore ascend with the incision where the abscess and water filling appear to you: and split it according to what is possible for you.
Et obserua, ne incidas arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis, et moriatur infirmus ex illo fluxu cum euacuatione humiditatis.	And observe, that you do not cut the artery, and that there does not occur a flow of blood, and that the sick person does not die from that flow with the evacuation of moisture.
¶ De incisione Arteriarum quae sunt post aures.	On the incisions of arteries which are behind the ears.
Caput II.	Chapter II.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri ad oculos, aut ad pectus, et antiquatur illud, et non confert curatio medicinarum: tunc magis ultima curatio est in illo, incisio harum duarum arteriarum.	When a certain person has catarrh to the eyes or chest and it gets old and medicine does not help; then the last cure for this is an incision of these two arteries.
Oportet ergo quando uis incidere eas, ut radat infirmus caput suum.	Therefore, when you wish to cut them, let the sick man shave his head.
Deinde frica locum cum panno aspero, ut appareant arteriae.	Then rub the place with a rough cloth so that the arteries appear.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum, cum quolibet panno suo.	Then let the weak man tie his neck with any of his cloths.
Deinde considera, ubi pulset uena.	Then consider where the vein pulses.
Et loca utriusque sunt loca quae sunt post aures depressa: et raro occultatur, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	And the places of both are places which are behind the ears depressed: and rarely is it concealed, except in certain men.
Deinde signa cum encaustro super utraque: et incide utramque cum spatumili utrimque acuro, incisione perueniente ad os: et fiat illud per latitudinem capitis.	Then mark both with a cauterizer, and cut both with a spatula, each side being sharpened to the bone, with the incision reaching the bone, so that it is across the width of the head.
Et si uis, intromitte spatumile sub arteria, et incide eam ad superiora cum incisione.	And if you wish, insert a spatula under the artery, and cut it upward with the incision.
Et sit longitudo incisionis quasi duo digiti iuncti.	And let the length of the incision be as two joined fingers.
Nam quando inciditur uena, egreditur sanguis egressione pulsatili, qui salit ad interiora saltu frequenti.	For when a vein is cut, blood flows out with a pulsatile emission, which leaps to the interior with frequent leaps.
Si autem arteria non apparet sensui, tunc oportet ut mensures ab aure quantitatem spacii trium digitorum.	If however the artery does not appear to the sense, then it is necessary that measurements be taken from the ear to determine the quantity of space three fingers' width.
Deinde signa cum encaustro, et finde usque ad os.	Then signs with an encasing and fine up to the bone.
Et illud quod oportet emittere ex sanguine, est VI uncia et fortasse emittis ex eo plus, aut minus.	And that which ought to be emitted from blood is VI ounces and perhaps you emit more, or less from it.
Totum illud secundum quantitatem quae apparet tibi ex uirute infirmi et repletione arteriae eius.	All of it according to the quantity which appears to you from the strength of the patient and the filling of his artery.
Deinde considera ad uulnus.	Then consider the wound.
Tunc si remanet ad os ex sifac aliquid, tunc incide illud, ut non accidat apostema calidum: tunc stringe uulnus cum liciniis ex panno lini.	Then if something remains at the bone from the incision, then cut it so that a hot abscess does not occur; then bind the wound with linens made of flax cloth.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointment until it heals.
¶ De extractione arteriarum, quae sunt in timporibus.	On the extraction of arteries that are in the temples.
Caput III.	Chapter III.
Quando accidit homini hemicranea antiqua, aut catarri acuti propter humiditates acrimoniales, et caliditate in lacertis timporum, aut soda antiqua, uehemens, et similia illis: et medicatur cum modis curationis medicinae, et non confert illud: tunc experti sumus in his aegritudinibus extractionem arteriarum ex timporibus, aut cauterizationem earum, sicut narrauimus.	When a person has an old headache or acute catarrh due to acrimonious humors and heat in the temples, or an old, violent sore and similar ones: and it is treated with modes of medical cure, and it does not benefit: then we have experimented in these ailments extraction of the arteries from the temples, or cauterization of them, as we have narrated.
Et modus operationis in extractione earum, est, ut radat infirmus pilos qui sunt in timporibus, et intendat ad arteriam apparentem in timpore.	And the way of operating in the extraction of them is, that the unhealthy hairs which are on the temples, should be shaved and applied to the apparent artery in the temple.
Ipsa namque ostenditur tibi ex pulsu suo, et raro occultatur nisi in paucis hominibus, aut uehementia frigoris.	For indeed it is shown to you from its pulse, and rarely is it concealed except in a few men, or in the vehemence of cold.
Quod si occultatur tibi, tunc stringat infirmus caput suum cum quolibet panno suo: deinde frica locum cum panno aspero.	If it is concealed from you, then the weak person should bind his head with any cloth of his own; then rub the place with a rough cloth.
Aut uapora locum cum aqua calida, donec appareat tibi apparitione manifesta.	Or place steam with hot water until an appearance becomes manifest to you.
Deinde accipe spatumile, quod paulo ante formaui.	Then take the spatula which I formed a little while ago.
Deinde excoria cum eo cutem cum facilitate, donec peruenias ad arteriam.	Then scrape away the skin with it until you reach the artery.
Deinde proiice in eam uncinum, et extrahe eam ad superiora, donec extrahas eam ex cute, et facias eam euadere ex tunicis quae sunt sub ea ab omni parte.	Then throw into it a hook and draw it upwards until you have drawn it out of the wound and made it come out from the tunics which are beneath it on every side.
Si autem arteria est subtilis: tunc inuolue eam cum extremitate uncini.	If however the artery is slender, then wind it with the point of a hook.
Deinde incide ex ea partem secundum quantitatem qua elongentur extremitates eius, et contrahantur, et non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Then cut from that part according to the amount by which the extremities are lengthened, and contract them, so that there is no flow of blood.
Nam si non inciditur, et si non abscinditur, non ascendit sanguis penitus.	For if it is not struck and if it is not cut off, blood does not rise fully.
Deinde euacua ex sanguine ana VI unci, usque ad .III.	Then evacuate from blood six ounces, up to three.
Quod si arteria est magna: tunc oportet ut liges eam in duobus locis ex filo duplo, forti, ex serico: aut ex chordis alhohod, ut non properet ad ipsam putrefactio ante consolidationem uulneris, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	If the artery is large, then it must be ligated in two places with a double, strong thread of silk, or with alhuhod cords, so that it does not quickly go to putrefaction before the wound has consolidated, and blood flow occurs.
Deinde incide superfluitatem, quae est inter duo ligamenta.	Then cut away the superfluous flesh that is between two ligaments.
Fac illud in illa hora, aut post horam aliam.	Do this at that hour, or after another hour.
Et si uis, cauteriza eam cauterio usque ad os, cum cauterio cultellari: donec incidantur extremitates eius, et stabit loco eiusdem operis.	And if you wish, cauterize it with a cautery up to the bone, with a knife-shaped cautery: until its extremities are cut and it will stand in place of the same work.
Et est melius opus, nisi si infirmus habet febrem, autest calefactae complexionis.	And it is better to work, unless if the sick person has a fever, or an heated constitution.
Quoniam cauterium est ex eis, quae iuuant ad finiendas humiditates.	Because cautery is one of those things that help to end moisture.
Ergo est melius iuuamentum.	Therefore it is better healing.
Et oportet post extractionem arteriarum, ut impleatur locus cotto antiquo: et ponantur super ipsum puluilli decenter facti.	And it is necessary after the removal of arteries that the place be filled with old burnt cotton: and put upon it wool pads made centrally.
Et post solutionem curetur cum medicinis siccis, quae faciunt nasci carnem, et cum liciniis, donec sanetur.	And after the dissolving it is treated with dry medicines which make flesh grow, and with poultices until it heals.
Quod si interim dum operaris accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, tunc propera ad abscindendum eum cum cauterio, aut ut impleas locum cum zegi: et stringe manum tuam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If, while you are operating, a flow of blood from an artery occurs, then hasten to cut it off with a cautery, or to fill the place with zea. And grasp your hand, until the blood is stopped.
Quod si nihil ex illis est tibi praesens, tunc pone super locum digitum tuum, donec congeletur sanguis.	If none of those things are present for you, then place your finger on the location until the blood clots.
Et embroca locum cum aqua uehementis frigoris, donec quiescat acuitas, et stringatur secundum quod oportet.	And embrocate the place with water of violent cold until the sharpness subsides, and tighten it as is necessary.
Et ex eo quod est leuius et facilius extractione arteriae, est, ut cauterizes uenam cum hoc cauterio habente duos cultellos: sitque acuitas duorum cultellorum similis almagdatem.	And because it is lighter and easier to extract the artery, it is that you cauterize the vein with this cautery having two blades: and let the sharpness of the two blades be similar to an almond.
Verumtamen sunt multo minoris acuitatis, quam duo cultelli.	Nevertheless they are of much less sharpness than two knives.
Quoniam si sunt acutae, sicut duo cultelli, properat utrisque frigus: et non incidunt carnem cum uelocitate.	Because if they are sharp, like two knives, one should apply cold to both; and they do not cut flesh with speed.
Cum ergo in eis est aliquantulum grossitudinis, tenetur in eis calor ignis, et abscinditur caro uelociter: cum hoc ergo opus est melius omni opere, et leuius, et facilius.	Therefore, when there is a slight thickness in them, heat of fire is applied to them, and flesh is quickly cut away; therefore, this work is better than all works, lighter and easier.
Et sit spacium quod est inter duos cultellos quantitas grossitudinis digiti, postquam tu signas duo loca cum encaustro: et depone utrosque ignitos ualde, donec perueniant ad os, et incidant uenam in duobus locis: ut elongetur quod est inter extremitates eius.	And let the space between the two knives be the quantity of the thickness of a finger, after you have marked the two places with encaustic wax: and lay both burning ones gently until they reach the bone, and cut the vein in two places; so that it may be lengthened from its extremities.
Nam non consolidantur cum hoc cauterio penitus.	For these are not thoroughly solidified with this cautery.
Et haec est forma cauterii.	And this is the shape of the cautery.
¶ De cura cursus lachrymarum acutarum assiduarum ab oculis.	On the treatment of acute and persistent tearing from the eyes.
Caput IIII.	Chapter IV.
Quando sunt lachrymae assiduae, et est cursus earum ex uenis, quae sunt super craneum capitis exterius: et non confert in eis aliquid curationis medicinae cum medicinis, et uides faciem infirmi iam rubere, et sentit in fronte sua deambulationem, sicut est deambulatio formicarum: et oculi eius sunt extenuati, humidi, ita quod iam corrosi sunt pili eorum cum corrosione: et calefactae sunt palpebrae eius ex acuitate lachrymarum: tunc antiqui indiguerunt in curatione earum hac operatione, et denominauerunt eam curationem, cum Ense.	When there are constant tears, and there is a flow of them from the veins that are above the skull externally: and it does not help anything with medicines in their cure, and you see the face of the sick already red, and he feels a wandering on his forehead, like the walking of ants: and his eyes are exhausted, humid, so that even the hairs of them have been corroded with corrosion: and his eyelids have been heated from the sharpness of the tears: then the ancients devised in their cure by this operation, and they named this cure, With a Sword.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere pilos qui sunt in fronte sua.	And it is, as you instruct the sick person to remove the hairs that are on their forehead.
Deinde incide in fronte tres fissuras aequedistantes secundum longitudinem frontis: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo digiti, et fissura una sit aequedistans longitudini nasi in medio frontis, et secunda secundum longitudinem parumper a motu lacertorum, et tertia a parte altera: et caue ab incisione arteriarum quae sunt in duobus lateribus: et elonga manum tuam a continuatione duarum mandibularum, et sit spacium omnis incisionis quantitas trium digitorum coniunctorum: et sit tibi frustum spongiae praeparatum, aut panni siccati multi, cum quibus exsicces sanguinem.	Then cut three equidistant incisions on the forehead according to the length of the forehead: and let the length of the incision be about two fingers' width, and one incision be equidistant from the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, and the second according to the length a little from the movement of the arms, and the third from the other part: and beware of the incision of the arteries which are on the two sides: and extend your hand from the continuation of the two jaws, and let the space of all incisions be the quantity of three fingers joined: and let there be prepared for you a piece of sponge, or many dry cloths, with which you will dry the blood.
Deinde intromitte spatumile duarum acutarum extremitatum, cuius mox sequens est forma.	Then introduce a spatula with two pointed ends, whose following shape is.
Ab incisione quae est a parte timporis, usque ad incisionem secundam: et excoria cum eo totam cutem, quae est inter duas incisiones, cum sifac, quod est super os.	From the incision which is on the side of the temple, up to the second incision; and scrape with it all the skin, which is between the two incisions, with the sifac, which is over the bone.
Deinde fac illud etiam ab incisione media usque ad incisionem secundam.	Then make it also from the middle incision to the second incision.
Deinde extrahe hoc spatumile, et intromitte in incisionem primam iterum instrumentum aliud, quod nominatur cultellare acutum, ab una parte lene, non acutum ab altera parte.	Then remove this spatula and insert into the first incision again another instrument, which is called a sharp chisel, blunt on one side, sharp on the other.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its shape.
Et pone latus eius acutum uersus carnem annexam cum cute, et latus eius lene uersus os: et impelle ipsum, donec perueniat ad fissuram mediam: et abscinde cum eo omnia uasa, quae descendunt a capite ad oculos: praeter quod continuetur incisio usque ad illud quod apparet de cute.	And place the sharp side of it against the attached flesh with the skin, and the blunt side towards the bone; and drive it until it reaches the median fissure; and cut with it all the vessels which descend from the head to the eyes; except that the incision should continue up to what appears from the skin.
Deinde fac illud in fissura media usque ad fissuram aliam.	Then make it in the middle fissure until another fissure.
Et postquam currit ex sanguine quantitas aequalis, exprime loca ex frustis sanguinis coagulati.	And after an equal quantity of blood has run out, squeeze the places from clots of congealed blood.
Deinde pone in omnem fissuram licinium ex cotto ueteri, et pone super eos puluillos imbibitos in uino, et oleo, aut aceto.	Then put in every wound of flesh from cooked entrails, and put on them small pellets soaked in wine, and oil, or vinegar.
Et uide ut non accidat apostema calidum.	And see that a hot abscess does not occur.
Et in die tertia solue ligamentum, et administra infusionem multam cum aqua tepida.	And on the third day, dissolve the ligament and administer a large infusion with warm water.
Deinde cura illud ex unguento basilicon, et reliquis quibus curantur uulnera: usquequo sanetur.	Then care for it with ointment of bdellium and the rest with which wounds are cured, until it is healed.
¶ De cura lachrymarum acutarum et catarrorum ad oculos ex interioribus capitis.	On the treatment of acute and chronic tears and catarrh of the eyes from internal parts of the head.
Caput V.	Chapter V.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri acuti, acres, assidui: et uides oculos eius extenuatos, paruos, et iam debilitatus est aspectus eorum: et palpebrae ulceratae, et cadunt pili ex eis, et in profundo capitis est dolor acutus, laedens, et sternutatio consequens: tunc sume ex istis accidentibus, quod illae materiae, et catarri non ueniunt, nisi ex uenis multis.	When someone suffers from acute, sharp, persistent catarrh: and you see their eyes weakened, small, and their appearance already debilitated: and the eyelids are ulcerated, and hairs fall out of them, and there is a sharp, painful pain deep in the head, followed by sneezing: then take from these occurrences that these materials and catarrh do not come unless from many veins.
Et melior curatio in eis est haec.	And better treatment for them is this.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere frontem suam.	And it is, as you prescribe, for the sick man to shave his forehead.
Deinde incide in eam fissuram unam in medio frontis, aut alterius parumper per latitudinem, et incipe cum fissura a timpore sinistro ad timpus dextrum: et sit incisio usque ad os: et elonga manum tuam a lacertis timporum, qui mouentur apud masticationem: donec quando detegitur os: et exsiccabis totum sanguinem cum spongia.	Then cut in that fissure one in the middle of the forehead, or another a little across its width, and begin with the fissure from the left temple to the right temple: and let the incision be up to the bone: and lengthen your hand from the temples, which move when chewing: until when the bone is revealed: and you shall dry all the blood with sponges.
Tunc separa inter duo labia fissurae cum cotto ueteri, aut cum liciniis ex lino.	Then separate between the two lips of the fissure with a boiled sheep's gut, or with lint made from linen.
Deinde stringe desuper cum puluillis: et imbibe puluillos cum uino et oleo, ut non accidat apostema calidum.	Then bind from above with pledgets: and soak the pledgets with wine and oil so that a hot abscess may not occur.
Et quando soluis illud, et uides quod apostema calidum iam imminuitur: tunc oportet ut frices os, donec incipiat in eo nasci caro.	And when you have loosened it, and see that the hot abscess is already diminishing: then it is necessary for you to cover the bone until flesh begins to grow in it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum regimine exiccatiuo quod facit nasci carnem: sicut si accipias ex farina tritici partes duas, et ex colophonia quatuor partes: et praepares ex eis emplastrum, et administretur ad natiuitatem carnis in istis uulneribus.	Then care for it with a drying regimen which causes flesh to be born; such as if you take two parts of wheat flour and four parts of colophony; and prepare a plaster from these, and administer it to the nativity of flesh in these wounds.
¶ De cura eius quod cadit in Aurem.	On the care of that which falls into the ear.
Caput VI.	Chapter VI.
Omne Quod in Aurem cadit, est una quatuor specierum: aut lapis mineralis, aut simile lapidi, sicut ferrum, et uitrum: aut est ex planta, sicut est cicer, et fabae: aut est res fluxibilis, sicut aqua, et acetum, et eis similia: aut aliquod animal.	Everything that falls into the ear is one of four kinds: either a mineral stone, or something like a stone, such as iron and glass: or it is from a plant, such as beans and chickpeas: or it is a fluid thing, such as water, vinegar, and things like these: or something animal.
Quando ergo cadit in aurem lapis, aut genus lapidis ex eis quae non adduntur, neque crescunt in aure, expone Aurem soli: si ergo uides lapidem, tunc distilla in Aurem aliquid ex oleo uiolato, aut sisamino.	When therefore a stone falls into the ear, or a kind of stone from those which do not grow in the ear, expose the ear to the sun: if therefore you see the stone, then distill into the ear something from beaten oil, or sesame.
Deinde administra extractionem eius, et fac sternutare cum condisi, et opila nares apud aduentum sternutationis, postquam tu ponis in circumitu auris frusta ex pannis, aut lana, et extendis aurem ad superiora.	Then administer the extraction of it, and make him sneeze with the condiment, and plug his nostrils at the entrance of sneezing, after which you place around the ear pieces of cloth, or wool, and extend the ear upwards.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum hac cura.	It often happens with this treatment.
Si autem non egreditur, tunc administra extractionem eius cum Gesti, id est, Pizigarolis subtilibus: cuius forma est haec.	If it does not come out, then administer its extraction with Gesti, that is, Pizigarolis thin ones: whose form is this.
Si ergo egreditur cum gesti, est bonum.	If therefore he comes out with a gasp, it is good.
Et si non, tunc administra extractionem eius cum uncino caeco subtili paucae duplicationis.	And if not, then administer its extraction with a subtle hooked probe of little duplication.
Si ergo non egreditur per illud, tunc fac cannulam ex aere, et intromitte extremitatem cannulae in foramen auris multum, et opila quod est in circumitu cannulae cum caera mollificata cum oleo, ut non sit uento uia nisi cannulae: deinde extrahe cum uento tuo attractione forti.	If therefore it does not come out through that [opening], then make a tube of metal, and introduce the end of the tube into the ear hole deeply, and put wax which is around the circumference of the tube with softened lard, so that there be no way for the wind except through the tube; then draw out with your own breath forcefully.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus.	For it often occurs with that which we have narrated.
Si autem non egreditur hoc modo: tunc accipe ex helkalimbat, aut ex uisco, id est, gluten praeparato, cum quo capiuntur aues, rem modicam: et pone ipsum in extremitate radii postquam tu inuoluis super eam cotum decenter positum: deinde intromitte ipsum in foramen auris cum facilitate, postquam tu exiccas aurem ab humiditate.	If this method does not work: then take from helkalimbat, or from visco, that is, prepared gluten, with which birds are caught, a small amount: and place it at the end of the radius after you have wrapped upon it a cotum placed centrally: then introduce it into the ear opening easily, after you have dried the ear from moisture.
Si ergo non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc propera ad scindendum, antequam accidat apostema calidum, aut spasmus.	If therefore it does not come out with all that we have narrated, then hasten to cut (it), before a hot abscess or spasm occurs.
Et modus fissurae est, ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis in cephalica: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum mensuram uirtutis eius.	And the mode of incision is that a phlebotomist should first cut the infirm on the head: and draw out of him blood according to the measure of his virtue.
Deinde fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et conuerte aurem eius ad superiora, et finde fissuram paruam in radice auris apud adipem eius in loco depresso ipsi: et sit fissura lunaris figurae, donec peruenias ad lapidem: deinde aufer eum cum eo, quod est tibi possibile ex instrumentis.	Then make the sick person sit between your hands, and turn his ear upward, and find a small fissure at the root of the ear in the depressed place among the fat: and let the fissure be of a lunar shape until you reach the stone; then remove it with what instruments are possible to you.
Deinde sue fissuram ab hora tua cum uelocitate, et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then suture the fissure at your time with speed, and care for it until it heals.
Quod si res cadens in aurem est ex uno granorum, quae crescunt, et inflantur: tunc administra extractionem eius.	If a thing falling into the ear is from one of the grains that grow and swell, then administer its extraction.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc accipe spatumile tenue, subtile, secundum hanc formam.	If it does not obey you at the exit, then take a thin, subtle spatula, according to this form.
Et administra cum eo abscisionem illius speciei ex granis, quae cadunt in aurem, et non facias illud, quando tu cogitas, quod illud granum iam humectatum est per uaporem auris, donec ponis ipsum frusta multa: deinde extrahe ea cum uncinis, aut cum gesti subtili, aut cum suctione, sicut diximus, nam extractio eius alleuiatur.	And administer with that the removal of that kind from the grains, which fall into the ear, and do not do this when you think that grain is already moistened by the vapor of the ear, until you place it in a piece of many: then extract them with hooks, or with a fine bristle, or with suction, as we have said, for its extraction will be eased.
In aqua autem quae ingreditur in aurem, oportet ut utatur infirmus sternutatione cum condisi in primis: et iam impleuit aurem suam cum aliquanto cotto ueteri: et est iacens super illam aurem, in qua est aqua.	In the water that enters the ear, it is necessary for the sick person to use sneezing with condensation first of all: and already filled his ear with a little cooked leather: and he is lying on that ear, in which is the water.
Si ergo egreditur per illud, est bonum.	If therefore it goes out through that, it is good.
Et si non: tunc accipe lapides multos, secundum longitudinem digiti, tenues, lenes, et calefac eos cum igne parumper, et intromittat infirmus ex eis unum in foramen auris suae: et saliat super pedem suum unum ex illa parte, et percutiat cum lapide alio super lapidem qui est in aure.	And if not: then take many stones, according to the length of the finger, thin, soft, and heat them with fire a little, and let the sick person insert one of these into the hole of his ear: and he shall jump on one foot from that side, and strike with another stone upon the stone which is in the ear.
Non ergo cesset facere illud cum lapide et lapide, donec egrediatur tota aqua.	Therefore, do not cease to do this with stone and stone until all the water comes out.
Et iam egreditur aqua ita, ut accipias ex parpyro, aut ex iunco unum, et intromittas extremitatem eius unam in aurem: et accendas extremitatem alteram cum igne, donec comburatur plurimum eius.	And now water goes out, so that you may take from papyrus, or from rush one, and insert one end of it into the ear: and set the other end on fire until it burns most of it.
Deinde itera iuncum alium, et fac illud multotiens, donec egrediatur tota aqua: et extrahe ipsam cum cannula secundum quod praemissum est in lapide.	Then insert another hook and do this many times until all the water comes out; and draw it out with a tube according to what was said before, in the stone.
In extractione autem animalis intrantis in eam, si est parui corporis, ut pulex, et ei simile, cura ipsum sicut dixi in diuisione.	In the extraction of an animal entering it, if it is small in size, like a flea, and the like, take care of it as I said in the division.
Sed si est corporis magni, quod appareat sensui: tunc administra extractionem eius cum gesti, et uncinis: et res eius est facilior omnibus, quae tenentur in aure.	But if it is a large body that appears to the sense: then administer its extraction with pliers and hooks: and the matter of it is easier than all things that are held in the ear.
In extractione autem uermis generati in aure, quando curas eum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et in tractatu distilationum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut aspicias aurem in sole.	In the extraction of a worm generated in the ear, when you have treated it with what we said in the division and in the treatment of distillations, and your treatment does not help; then it is necessary that you look at the ear in the sun.
Si ergo apparet illic aliquid ex uermibus, tunc extrahe illud cum gesti, aut cum uncinis subtilibus.	If therefore something appears there from worms, then remove it with forceps or with fine hooks.
Si autem non apparet illic aliquid, tunc accipe cannulam, cuius haec est forma, stricta inferius, ampla superius: et intromitte extremitatem subtilem in aurem secundum quantitatem quod tolerat eam infirmus: deinde suge cum ea suctione forti.	If nothing appears there, then take a tube, whose form is this, narrow below, wide above: and insert the slender end into the ear according to the amount that the sick person can tolerate it; then suck with it with strong suction.
Fac illud multotiens, donec egrediantur omnes uermes.	Do this many times until all the worms come out.
Si autem non obediunt tibi ad exitum, tunc opila circumitum cannulae cum caera, sicut dixi in lapide.	If they do not obey you to the exit, then wrap the tip of the cannula with wax, as I said on the stone.
Quod si non egrediuntur cum eo quod diximus: tunc administra distillationes quas iam experti sunt antiqui in interfectione uermium: et inuenies illud in tractatu distillationum.	If they do not emerge with what we have said: then administer distillations which the ancients have already tested in the destruction of worms: and you will find it in the treatise on distillations.
Et sit effusio tua qua effundis olea et medicinas in aurem cum hoc instrumento, cuius forma depicta est hic.	And let your pouring of oil and medicines into the ear be with this instrument, whose form is depicted here.
Sicut uides fac ipsum ex argento, aut aere, inferius strictum, in quo sit foramen paruum, amplum superius.	As you see, make it of silver or copper, narrower below, with a small hole, wider above.
Sit ergo ut impellens quod est in concauitate cannulae, sit ex aere decenter factum.	Therefore, let what is in the concavity of the tube be made of properly shaped copper.
Et si uis, accipe radium, et inuolue in extremitate eius cottum inuolutione decenti: deinde proiice oleum, aut succum, aut quod uis ex istis medicinis in cannulam: et ipsa sit in aure: deinde intromitte radium cum cotto desuper, et exprime ipsum manu tua compressione temperata, donec impellatur oleum in concauitate auditus, et sentiat ipsum infirmus interius: et illud quod infunditur in aurem, sit iam calefactum cum igne parumper: et caue ne sit res quae distillatur in eam frigida ualde: medicinae enim non tolerant illud.	And if you wish, take a reed, and wrap cotton at its end with a decent wrapping: then throw oil or juice or what you wish of these medicines into a cannula: and let it be in the ear: then introduce the reed with cotton from above, and squeeze it with your hand with moderate compression, until oil is driven into the cavity of the hearing, and the sick person feels it inside. And that which is poured into the ear, should already have been warmed with fire for a little while: and beware lest what is distilled into it be very cold: for medicines do not tolerate this.
¶ De cura opilationis accidentis Auri.	On the treatment of an accident of ear wax buildup.
Caput VII.	Chapter VII.
Quandoque egrediuntur quidam infantes ex uentribus matrum suarum non perforati.	Sometimes infants emerge from the wombs of their mothers unperforated.
Et iam accidit etiam quibusdam hominibus opilatio in meatu Auris a uulnere, aut carne nata in ea.	And it also happens to some people that there is an obstruction in the ear canal from a wound, or flesh born in it.
Et haec opilatio quandoque fit in profundo foraminis Auris, quam non consequitur uisus: et quandoque accidit ad exteriora foraminis parum, et consequitur eam uisus.	And this application sometimes occurs deep within the ear canal, which is not seen by sight; and sometimes it happens to the outer part of the ear canal a little, and it is seen by sight.
Illa ergo quae accidit in profundo Auris, et quam non comprehendit aspectus, est in pluribus dispositionibus difficilis sanationis.	Therefore that which happens deep within the ear, and which sight does not comprehend, is in many dispositions difficult to heal.
Et in illa quam consequitur uisus, oportet ut ponas Aurem infirmi in sole, et aspicias in ea: tunc si uides opilationem apparentem, aperi eam cum spatumili subtili, cuius forma est haec quae sequitur, sit extremitas eius in qua sit quaedam latitudo parua, cuius quaedam pars sit acuta: et reliquum spatumile sit duarum laterum lenium: ut non laedat aurem.	And in that which follows the use, you ought to place the ear of the sick person in the sun, and look into it: then if you see a seeming hairiness, open it with a fine spatula, whose form is this which follows, let its extremity be in which there is a small breadth, of which part is sharp: and the rest of the spatula be gentle on two sides: so that it does not harm the ear.
Si ergo opilatio est a carne nata in meatu auris: tunc tene eam cum uncino subtili, et incide eam cum facilitate uehementi, donec auferatur tota caro.	If therefore an ear discharge is born of flesh in the ear canal; then hold it with a fine hook, and cut it with ease of violence until the whole flesh is removed.
Quod si opilatio est in profundo auris: tunc accipe radium subtilem, lenem, et calefac ipsum cum igne parumper: deinde mitte ipsum in meatum auris.	If a pain is deep within the ear, then take a fine, soft rod and heat it with a little fire; then put it into the ear canal.
Si ergo senseris opilationem cum eo, quod inuenit infirmus cum grauitate auditus, conare apertionem eius cum facilitate: et caue, ne uulneres neruos auris.	If therefore you sense obstruction with that which the sick man finds with heaviness of hearing, try to open it with facility; and beware, lest you wound the nerves of the ear.
Deinde pone in aurem licinium secundum quantitatem amplitudinis foraminis, quod inuoluisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud aliquot diebus, donec sis securus de consolidatione uulneris.	Then place licorice in the ear according to the amount of the opening's size which you have covered with Egyptian ointment; do this for several days, until you are certain about the wound's consolidation.
Aut accipe licinium, et infunde ipsum in aqua rosata, et pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, et utere ipso.	Or take licorice and infuse it in rose water, and pulverize over it ground saffron, and use it.
Quod si uides aurem iam apostemari: tunc oportet ut extrahas licinium, et permittas ipsum cum licinio alio, quod inuolues in caeroto quod sit factum cum oleo rosato, donec sedetur apostema calidum: deinde cura ipsum usquequo sanetur.	If you see an ear already suppurating, then it is necessary that you extract the pus, and allow it with another cloth, which is wrapped in a poultice that has been made with rose oil, until the abscess becomes seated warm: then take care of it until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis: tunc submerge spongiam, aut pannos in aqua frigida, et pone super eam aurem: et utere reliqua curatione, quae abscindit fluxum sanguinis praedicta in tractatu distillationum.	If, however, there occurs a flow of blood, then immerse a sponge or cloths in cold water and place them over the ear; and use the rest of the treatment which cuts off the flow of blood as has been prescribed in the treatise on distillations.
¶ De cura Altheli palpebrarum.	On the Treatment of Styes of the Eyelids.
Caput VIII.	Chapter VIII.
Isti Althelil qui accidunt in Palpebris oculi, quandoque sunt humidi, et sunt sicci.	Injuries of the eyelid which occur in the eye, sometimes are humid, and sometimes are dry.
Oportet ergo ut teneas eos cum tenaliis: aut cum uncino, et incidas eos cum spatumili a radicibus suis.	Therefore, it is necessary that you hold them with forceps: or with a hook, and cut them with a spatula from their roots.
Deinde pone super loca zegi tritum.	Then place over the places a mixture of zegi rubbed.
Si autem ex eis fluat sanguis, tunc cauteriza eos cum cauterio lenticulari subtili.	If blood flows from them, then cauterize them with a subtle lentil cautery.
Et cauterizare eos, est melius post incisionem.	And it is better to cauterize them after incision.
Multotiens enim redeunt quando remanet ex radicibus suis aliquid.	For many times they return when something remains from their roots.
Et quando cauterizantur cum igne, comburuntur illae radices, et non redeunt.	And when they are cauterized with fire, those roots burn and do not return.
¶ De cura Grandinum palpebrarum oculi.	On the treatment of granula of the eyelids of the eye.
Caput IX.	Chapter IX.
Multotiens accidit in palpebris aliquid quod assimilatur Crandini in fortitudine sua, et sua duricie, et propter illud nominatur Grando: et est aggregatio humiditatis grossae in palpebra superiore, et palpebra inferiore.	Many times something happens in the eyelids that is similar to a grain of sand in its hardness and thickness, and because of this it is called a granuloma: and it is an aggregation of thick moisture in the upper eyelid, and the lower eyelid.
Operatio ergo in eis est, ut consideres tunc, si est Grando procedens in eo, quod apparet de palpebra, et mouentur ad omnem partem, et res eius est facilis.	The operation therefore is, that you should consider then, if there is a granuloma proceeding in it, which appears from the eyelid, and move to every part, and its matter is easy.
Finde ergo super eam fissura per latitudinem.	Therefore find a fissure over it lengthwise.
Deinde excoria eam ab omni parte cum facilitate, donec euadat.	Then scrape it from every part with ease until it weeps.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncino, et abscinde ipsam.	Then suspend it with a hook, and cut it off.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi abscisio eius, nisi postquam tu penetras palpebram cum incisione parumper, tunc nocet infirmo illud in aliquo.	If it is not prepared for you, its cutting, except after you have penetrated the eyelid with a slight incision, then it will harm the sick person in some way.
Quod si fissura est magna: tunc aggrega ipsam cum sutura: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	If the fissure is large: then gather it together with suture: and care for it, until it heals.
Et si est parua, non superueniet tibi malum ex ea.	And if it is small, no evil will come to you from it.
Vnguentum enim restaurat ipsam, et incarnat eam.	For the ointment restores it and makes flesh of it.
Et si grando est decliuis ad interiora auris uersus superficiem intrinsecam, tunc inuersa palpebram, et suspende grandinem cum uncino: praeter quod indigeas incisione, et preme eam ab omni parte.	And if the fold is large and sloping towards the inner surface of the ear, then turn the eyelid back, and suspend the fold with a hook: except that you need to make an incision, and press it from every part.
Quod si elongatur palpebra per incisionem, non nocet illud in aliquo.	If the eyelid is lengthened through an incision, it does not harm in any way.
Deinde ablue oculum post incisionem grandinis, cum aqua salsa: et cura locum cum eo quod incarnat, donec sanetur infirmus.	Then wash the eye after the cutting with salt water: and take care of the place with that which is applied, until it heals.
¶ De cura Axirnath palpebrarum.	On the treatment of injuries to the eyelids.
Caput X.	Chapter X.
Axirnath est adeps qui generatur in tunicis palpebrae superioris: et plurimum quidem accidit illud pueris: et ipsum grauat oculos eorum, et accidunt eis catarri in matutinis, et non possunt intueri lumen solis, propterea, quod lachrymae properant ad eos, et propter illud uides eos discumbere super facies suas semper, et super eas dormiunt, et sunt palpebrae eorum sub superciliis humidae, quas iam cooperuit inflatio: et eminentia quidem Axirnath apparens est oculo, et quando tu premis locum cum digitis tuis, sentis Axirnath inter eos.	A tumor is fat that is generated in the tunic of the upper eyelid: and it happens very much to boys: and it weighs down their eyes, and they get catarrh in the mornings, and they cannot look at the light of the sun because tears flow to them, and therefore you see them lie down on their faces always, and on those they sleep, and their eyelids are under the eyebrows wet, which has already been covered by inflation: and the tumor indeed is visible to the eye, and when you press the place with your fingers, you feel the fat between them.
Et modus operationis eius est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the mode of operation is that he places his head in your bosom.
Deinde accipe pannum lini, et praepara in eo licinia, et fac ex illo licinio circulum secundum quantitatem quod continet Axirnath ab omni parte.	Then take a linen cloth and prepare a groove in it, and make a circle from that groove according to the amount which contains Asirnath from every part.
Deinde pone eum super eam, et preme cum digitis tuis ab omni parte, ut aggregetur Axirnath in medio circuli.	Then place him upon it, and press with your fingers from every part, so that Axirnath may be gathered in the middle of the circle.
Deinde finde in medio illius humiditatis cum spatumili incidente fissuras per latitudinem, et non sit fissura maior illa quae fit in phlebotomia in profundo.	Then find in the middle of that moisture with a sharp instrument make incisions lengthwise, and let not the incision be greater than that which is made in phlebotomy in depth.
Aut oportet ut findas cutem totam, donec peruenias ad Axirnath in pluribus enim dispositionibus procedit Axirnath ex fissura secundum formam frusti pinguedinis albae.	Or it is necessary that you cut through the whole skin until you reach Axirnath, for in many arrangements Axirnath proceeds from the fissure according to the form of white, fatty wood.
Extrahe ergo eam cum panno, quem infiltrasti inter digitos tuos ad exteriora: et tu reuoluis manum tuam ad dextram et sinistram, donec dispergatur: et caue, ne addas in fissura, ut non peruenias cum spatumili ad oculum, et laedas eum.	Therefore, extract it with a cloth which you have saturated between your fingers to the outside: and you will turn your hand to the right and left, until it is scattered: and beware, lest you add it into the fissure, so that you do not reach the eye with the spatula, and wound it.
Si autem non appareat tibi Axirnath in principio fissurae, tu addas in fissura parum cum facilitate, donec procedat Axirnath.	If, however, Axirnath does not appear to you at the beginning of the fissure, you add a little into the fissure with ease, until Axirnath proceeds.
Deinde extrahe eam, sicut diximus.	Then extract it, as we said.
Deinde submerge pannos in aceto et aqua, et pone eos super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis.	Then submerge cloths in vinegar and water, and place them over the spot, and bind it with bandages.
Et ex hominibus sunt qui terunt salem, et ponunt ipsum in concauitate fissurae, ut liquefiat quod remansit ex illa humiditate.	And there are some men who rub salt and place it in the hollow of the fissure so that it melts what remains of its moisture.
Deinde cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then care for the same, until it is healed.
Si autem accidat in loco apostema calidum, tune cura ipsum cum emplastris sedatiuis, donec sanetur.	If a hot abscess occurs in a place, then treat it with soothing plasters until it heals.
¶ De modis Ataxmir oculi, id est, cum palpebra mollificatur oculi, unde fit ut rugetur sicut non debet.	On the ways of a cataract of the eye, that is, when the eyelid softens the eye, so that it becomes wrinkled as it should not.
Caput XI.	Chapter XI.
Quando nascuntur in palpebris oculi pili additi praeter cursum sub pilis naturalibus, et antiquantur: tunc ipsi nocent oculo, et faciunt accidere modos aegritudinum, sicut lachrymas assiduas, et mollificationem palpebrarum, et albuginem, donec fit illud caussa destructionis oculi.	When hairs grow on the eyelids besides the course of the natural hairs, and they age: then these harm the eye, and cause ways of disease to happen, such as frequent tearing, and softening of the eyelids, and clouding, until that becomes a cause for the destruction of the eye.
Et Ataxmir quidem oculi curatur secundum quatuor modos.	And a cataract of the eye is treated according to four modes.
Aut per cauterium cum igne.	Or with fire using cauterization.
Aut cum medicina acuta, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo cauterii.	Or with acute medicine, according to what was previously stated in the chapter on cautery.
Aut curatur Ataxmir per incisionem et suturam.	Or it is cured with an incision and suture.
Aut per cannas, secundum quod ego dicam.	Or through tubes, as I shall say.
Oportet ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	It is necessary that you place the head of the sick person in your bosom.
Deinde conuerte palpebram oculi manu tua sinistra.	Then turn the eyelid of the eye with your left hand.
Si ergo conuertitur, bonum est.	If therefore it turns, it is good.
Et si non: intromitte acum in eam, in qua sit filum ab inferiori parte palpebrae, et fac penetrare acum cum filo desuper, et sit illud prope pilos ipsos, id est, prope marginem palpebrae, in quo nascuntur pili: et trahe filum ad superiora cum palpebra, et conuerte eam cum radio.	And if not: introduce a needle into it, where the thread is from the lower part of the eyelid, and make the needle penetrate with the thread from above, and let it be near the hairs themselves, that is, near the edge of the eyelid, in which hairs are born: and draw the thread upwards with the eyelid, and turn it with a stick.
Deinde finde in interiori parte palpebrae sub pilis additis cum spatumili incidente a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus.	Then find in the inner part of the eyelid under the added hairs with a spatula, cutting from the greater lacrimal gland to the lesser lacrimal gland.
Deinde extrahe filum, et pone sub palpebra puluillum paruum ex cotto, aut panno: deinde signa super palpebram cum encaustro, quod sit sicut figura folii myrti.	Then remove the thread, and place under the eyelid a small piece of cooked linen or cloth: then mark over the eyelid with encaustic wax, so that it is like the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Verumtamen oportet, ut fit figura secundum quantitatem et eleuationem palpebrae: quoniam iam diuersificatur illud in hominibus.	Nevertheless, it is necessary that the figure be made according to the quantity and elevation of the eyelid, because this varies in different people.
Ex eis enim est, qui indiget ut incidatur ex palpebra quantitas magna, secundum quantitatem quae mollificatur a palpebra.	Of these there is one who needs to be incised from the eyelid an amount that is large according to the quantity which is softened from the eyelid.
Deinde cum spatumili finde super duas lineas quas signasti, et incipe a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus, et sit fissura una prope pilos naturales, sicut est grossitudo radii.	Then when you have marked two lines with your spatula, begin from the larger lacrimal gland to the smaller one, and let there be a fissure near the natural hairs, as thick as the thickness of the radius.
Deinde intromitte uncinum in uno duorum angulorum cutis.	Then insert a hook into one of the two angles of the skin.
Deinde excoria ipsam totam.	Then scrape away the whole area.
Deinde aggrega cum sutura duo labia, cum acu et filo lana subtili: et absterge sanguinem, et fac adhaerere quod superfluit ex filis super duo supercilia, cum quibusdam rebus inuiscantibus, si uis facere illud: et si non, non cures.	Then, with a needle and fine wool thread, gather together the two lips of the wound. Wipe away the blood, and make the excess threads adhere to the two eyebrows, with some sticky things, if you wish to do this; and if not, don't worry about it.
Deinde dimitte suturam et fila usque ad tres dies, aut quatuor: postea cura illud.	Then dismiss the suture and thread up to three days, or four: afterwards care for it.
Et si uis, dimitte uulnus absque sutura, et cura ipsum cum eo, quod exsiccat et constringit.	And if you wish, leave the wound without suture, and care for it so that it dries and tightens.
Nam palpebra eleuatur apud sigillationem uulneris et aggregationem eius: sed futura est melior.	For the eyelid should be raised during the sealing and closing of a wound; but it will be better later.
Hunc modum curandi Ataxmir docuerunt antiqui.	This way of healing a wound was taught by the ancients, Albucasis.
Verumtamen in eo est sollicitudo super infirmum, et est ex bona operatione, et non est in eo timor.	But there is anxiety about the sick person, and it is from a good operation, and there is no fear in it.
Et modus alius est in Ataxmir etiam: et est, ut signes super palpebram figuram, quae sit sicut figura folii myrti, sicut narrauimus.	And another method is in Ataxmir also: and it is, as signs on the eyelid make a figure like the shape of a myrtle leaf, as we have narrated.
Deinde eleua palpebram cum tribus uncinis separatis, aut aggregatis, secundum formam hanc quae sequitur, deinde incide quod superfluit cum forficibus paruis, secundum hanc formam, cum aequalitate incisionis.	Then lift the eyelid with three separate or combined hooks, according to the following form, then cut away the excess with small scissors, according to this form, with equality of incision.
Si autem non est tibi possibile tenere uncinum, et non aequatur illud: tunc accipe acum in qua sit filum, et intromitte ipsum in medio figurae: et intromitte filum aliud prope lachrymale maius, et filum secundum prope lachrymale minus: et aggrega inter digitos tuos fila cum aequalitate.	If it is not possible for you to hold a hook and it is not equal: then take an awl in which there is a thread, and introduce it into the middle of the figure: and introduce another thread near the larger lacrimal, and the second thread near the smaller lacrimal: and gather together between your fingers the threads with equality.
Deinde eleua manum tuam eleuatione aequali: et eleua cutem super quam est signatum cotum, sicut narrauimus.	Then lift your hand with an equal elevation: and lift the skin over which the incision is made, as we have narrated.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then gather together the two lips of the wound with a suture: and care for it until it is healed.
Si uero accidat apostema apud incisionem tuam, aut fissuram tuam: seda illud apostema cum caeroto, et his similibus, ex unguentis sedantibus.	If however a boil should occur at your incision or fissure, treat that boil with cauteries and similar things, from sedative ointments.
Et quandoque accidit palpebrae etiam, ut conuertantur pili eius.	And sometimes it happens to the eyelid, that its hairs turn.
Oportet ergo ut utaris in ea quod diximus in incisione: sed sutura utrisque magis est artificialis.	Therefore, you should use what we have said about incisions; but sewing both sides is more artificial.
¶ De cura Ataxmir cum cannis.	On the treatment of a toothache with dogs.
ET Est, ut conuertas palpebram, et scindas fissuram quae est deintus, secundum quod narraui.	And it is, that you convert the eyelid, and cut the fissure which is within, according to what I have told you.
Deinde arte fac duas cannas, aut duo ligna subtilia: quarum longitudo sit secundum longitudinem palpebrae, et latitudo earum sit minor latitudine spatumilis: et tu iam incidisti in extremitatibus utriusque ab utrisque partibus ubi tenes fila.	Then with the art make two pipes or two slender rods: whose length shall be according to the length of the eyelid, and their width shall be less than the width of a spatula: and you have already incised at the extremities of both sides where you hold the threads.
Deinde aggrega utramque cum subtilitate super illud quod superfluit ex palpebra oculi, et stringe duas cannas ab utrisque partibus strictura forti, et dimitte eam diebus aliquot.	Then gather both together with subtlety over that which is superfluous from the eyelid of the eye, and tighten two reeds from both parts with strong constriction, and release it after a few days.
Cutis enim stricta morietur, et denigrabitur, et putrefiet, donec cadet per se.	For if the skin is tightly bound it will die and blacken and putrify until it falls away of itself.
Si ergo tardatur, tunc incide eam cum forficibus.	If therefore it delays, then cut it with scissors.
Deinde cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it heals.
Cum ergo consolidatur, eleuatur palpebra: et non pungunt pili.	When therefore it is consolidated, the eyelid is elevated; and hairs do not prick.
Et haec est forma duarum cannarum, quas facies secundum hanc figuram, et quantitatem in longitudinem et latitudinem.	And this is the shape of two tubes, which you will make according to this figure, and quantity in length and width.
¶ De eleuatione pilorum pungentium in oculo cum acu.	On the elevation of piercing hairs in the eye with a needle.
Caput XII.	Chapter XII.
Operatio in illo est, ut accipias acum subtilem, et intromittas in eam filum ex serico subtile, lene.	The operation consists in taking a fine needle and introducing into it a fine silk thread gently.
Deinde aggreges extremitates eius, et nodes utramque nodo subtili ualde: et sit longitudo filorum palmus unus.	Then gather the extremities of it, and knots both sides with a subtle knot: and let the length of the threads be one palm.
Deinde compone in Alinxotati filum aliud subtile sub eo in breui, et noda extremitates eius si uis.	Then take another fine thread of silk and place it beneath the first in a short space, and knot its ends if you wish.
Deinde ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo, et sit prope solem ut declaretur operatio: quoniam est operatio subtilis, uel minuta.	Then the patient puts his head in your bosom, and let it be near the sun as the operation is declared; because it is a subtle or minute operation.
Deinde intromitte acum cum alinxotati in radicem palpebrae, et fac eam penetrare in palpebram festinanter, donec extrahas eam desuper pilum naturalem.	Then insert a point with an alembic into the root of the eyelid, and make it penetrate quickly into the eyelid until you withdraw it from above the natural hair.
Deinde trahe pilum usque supra alinxotati: et intromitte in alinxotati illum pilum: si est unus, aut duo, aut tres, non plures.	Then draw the arrow up beyond the point of piercing: and introduce the arrow into that point of piercing: if it is one, or two, or three, no more.
Deinde trahe manum tuam cum eo, donec egrediatur pilus cum alinxotati in palpebra cum pilo naturali.	Then draw your hand with it until the hair comes out with its root along with the natural hair on the eyelid.
Si autem trahatur alinxotati, et non egrediatur pilus cum ea: trahes alinxotati ad inferiora, cum filo quod tu composuisti in ea, donec egrediatur alinxotati ex foramine superiori, et uideas eam uisione oculi: tunc enim trahes alinxotati, et filum: et extrahe utraque, et claude oculum: et dimitte ipsum clausum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec adhaereat pilus loco suo, et nascatur super ipsum caro.	If it is drawn out and the hair does not come out with it, draw the alinxotati down to the lower part, with the thread that you have composed in it, until the alinxotati comes out of the upper opening, and you see it with the eye: then pull on the alinxotati and the thread, and extract both, and close the eye. And release it closed for two days or three, until the hair adheres to its place, and flesh is born above it.
Quod si pilus est breuis, tunc aut associa ei pilum longum ex pilis naturalibus, et eleuatur cum eo: aut dimitte ipsum, donec elongetur post spacium, et tunc eleua ipsum.	If the hair is short, then either associate with it a longer hair from natural hairs, and elevate it with it; or let it be, until it lengthens after a space, and then elevate it.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae accidit in palpebra superiori.	On the treatment of a pterygium which occurs in the upper eyelid.
Caput XIII.	Chapter XIII.
Quando accidit oculo haec Alxatrati, nominatur Leporina.	When this happens to the eye, it is called Leporina.
Et haec Alxatrati est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	And this is either natural or accidental, according to Al-Zahrawi.
Accidentalis ergo fit ex consolidatione uulneris, aut sectionis, aut cauterii, et similium illis.	Therefore, an accident occurs from the consolidation of a wound, or section, or cautery, and similar things.
Et modus operationis in ea est, ut tu findas illam consolidationem, et ut separes labia eius, et ponas in eo quod est inter ea licinium ex lino, et liges eam, donec sanetur.	And the method of operation on this is, that you find that consolidation and that you separate its lips, and you place between them a ligature made of linen, and you bind it, until it heals.
Et non oportet, ut utaris in curatione eius rebus quae exiccant et constringunt: nam si tu facis illud, redit Alxatrati deterior quam fuit: imo utere in ea rebus quae mollificant, sicut foenumgraecum: et embroca cum aqua, in qua cocta sit althea, semen lini: et unguento dyaquilon, quod liquefactum sit cum aliquo ex oleis: et inuolue cum eo licinium, et cura cum eo.	And it is not right that you should use things which dry and constrict in the treatment of this [wound]; for if you do so, Alxatrati returns worse than it was; rather, use things that soften it, such as hay: and embroca with water in which althea has been cooked, flax seed: and unguentum dyaquilon, which has been liquefied with some oil; and envelop with this licorice, and care for it with this.
Et thesaurus curationis tuae est, ut coneris omni ingenio, ut non consolidetur, secundum formam quae fuit in primis.	And your treasure of healing is that you try with every skill that it not be solidified, according to the form which it was at first.
Et haec quidem operatio quam diximus, non est nisi quaedam rectificatio Alxatrati, ut non redeat forma loci secundum quod fuit omnino.	And this operation which we have said, is nothing but a certain rectification of Alcatiraet, so that it does not return to the form of the place according to what it was entirely.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae fit in palpebra inferiori, et est rugatio uel contractio sursum ad dextrum et sinistrum.	Concerning the treatment of a pterygium which occurs in the lower eyelid and is a wrinkle or contraction upward to the right and left.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter XIV.
Haec Alxatrati quae fit inferius, est quae uere nominatur Alxatrati.	This is the Alxatrati which is performed below, it is truly named Alxatrati.
Et est naturalis, et est accidentalis.	It is natural and it is accidental.
Et accidentalis fit ex uulnere, aut fissura, aut cauterio, et illis similibus.	And an accidental wound is made from a cut, or fissure, or cautery, and those similar things.
Et uia operationis in ea est, ut accipias acum, in qua sit filum duplum, et tingas eam in carnem, et facias eam penetrare a lachrymali sinistro usque ad lachrymale dextrum, donec perueniat filum in duabus extremitatibus carnis.	And the way of operation in this is, that you take a needle, in which there is a doubled thread, and dye it in meat, and make it penetrate from the left lacrimal duct to the right lacrimal duct, until the thread comes to both extremities of the flesh.
Deinde extende carnem ad superiora cum acu, et incide eam cum spatumili lato.	Then extend the flesh upward with a knife, and cut it with a broad spatula.
Si ergo redit figura palpebrae secundum quod oportet, est bonum.	If therefore the shape of the eyelid returns as it should, it is good.
Et si non, accipe radium, et pone ipsum in fissuram, et conuerte cum eo palpebram: et finde duas fissuras in latere interiore palpebrae, et sint extremitates duarum fissurarum ex duobus angulis incisionis, donec concurrant et fiat ex eis angulus: donec quando aggregantur fiat figura earum haec figura, et est litera lauda graeca.	And if not, take a probe and put it in the fissure, and turn it with it the eyelid: and find two fissures on the inner side of the eyelid, and let the ends of the two fissures be from two angles of the incision, until they meet and an angle is made of them; until when they are gathered together this figure is made, and it is the Greek letter lambda.
Deinde aufer illam carnem per quantitatem, quod est latus eius acutum inferius, ab eo quod sequitur palpebram.	Then remove that flesh by the amount, which is its acute side below, from what follows the eyelid.
Deinde aggrega partes separatas: sue eam cum filo lanae.	Then gather the separated parts; sew them together with a woolen thread.
Deinde cura eas cum eo quod diximus, de medicinis mollificantibus, et liciniis, donec sanentur.	Then care for them with what we have said, about softening medicines and poultices, until they are healed.
Et si Alxatrati accidat ex fissura, et sutura, aut cauterio: tunc oportet ut findas fissura plana sub pilis palpebrarum, etiam secundum quod praecessit.	And if a laceration occurs from a cut, and suture, or cautery: then it is necessary that you find the fissure flat under the hairs of the eyelid, also according to what preceded.
Deinde separa inter duo labia cum licinio, secundum quod diximus.	Then separate between the two lips with a linctus, as we have said.
Et summa sermonis de cura Alxatrati, quando est desuper, aut inferius, est, ut currat in ea operatio, secundum quod praeparatur ex forma Alxatrati.	And the summary of the discourse on the care of an Alxatrati, when it is above or below, is that the operation should be carried out according to how it is prepared from the form of an Alxatrati.
Ipsa namque est multarum diuersitatum in forma: et artifex prudens praeparat ingenium cum quocunque modo est possibile ei, donec redire faciat figuram ad formam naturalem, aut prope eam, et ipsemet infirmus, secundum quod conuenit ei ex operatione et instrumentis in plurimis dispositionibus.	For indeed there are many varieties in form: and a wise artificer prepares the instrument with whatever mode is possible to him, until he makes the figure return to its natural form, or near it, and himself also the infirm according to what is fitting for him from the operation and instruments in many arrangements.
¶ De adhaerentia palpebrae oculi cum coniunctiua, aut cornea.	On the adhesion of the eyelid of the eye with the conjunctiva, or cornea.
Caput XV.	Chapter XV.
Quandoque accidit haec consolidatio multis hominibus, ita ut consolidetur palpebra superior cum albedine oculi, et prohibeat ipsum ab operationibus suis naturalibus.	Sometimes this consolidation happens to many people, so that the upper eyelid adheres to the white of the eye and prevents it from performing its natural functions.
Oportet ergo quod intromittas extremitatem radii sub palpebra, et eleues eam sursum: aut extendas eam cum uncino: deinde incide adhaerentiam cum spatumili subtili, quod non sit cum acuitate incisionis spatumilium, imo sit obtusum parumper: ut non inquietetur infirmus apud operationem, et remoueatur spatumile, et laedat oculum cum acuitate sua: et sit incisio tua quasi tu excories illam adhaerentiam cum facilitate, donec quando redit palpebra secundum formam suam naturalem, et sanetur adhaerentia tota.	Therefore, you ought to insert the extremity of the radius under the eyelid and raise it upward; or extend it with a hook: then cut the adhesion with a spatula, which should not be sharp at the point of the spatula, but rather blunt for a little while: so that the sick person may not be troubled during the operation, and the spatula be removed, and injure the eye with its sharpness: and let your incision be as if you were scraping off that adhesion with ease, until when the eyelid returns to its natural form, and the adhesion is healed entirely.
Funde tunc in oculum aquam salsam, cum aqua ablue ipsum: aut distilla in ipsum ex sief facto, ex ziniar dissoluto cum aqua.	Then pour salt water into the eye, and wash it with water; or distill into it from a sieve made, from linen dissolved with water.
Deinde separa inter palpebram et oculum cum licinio lini: et pone super oculum lanam infusam cum albugine oui: et post diem tertium utere sief, et cum solidatiuis, donec sanetur.	Then separate between the eyelid and eye with a linen cloth: and place over the eye wool soaked in alum mixed with white of egg: and after the third day use sieve, and with solids, until it heals.
¶ De incisione ungulae et eminentiae carnis lachrymarum.	On the incision of the nail and the prominence of the flesh of tears.
Caput XVI.	Chapter XVI.
Scias, quod ungula est secundum duos modos.	Know that a nail is according to two modes.
Aut est neruosa: et est similis sifac duro, subtili.	Or it is nervy and is similar to a hard, fine sieve.
Aut est non neruosa, similis humiditati congelatae albae: quae quando tangit cam ferrum, aut conaris capere eam cum uncino, abscinditur, et non figitur in ea uncinus.	Or it is not a nerve, similar to frozen water of white color: which when it touches iron, or you try to seize it with a hook, it breaks off, and the hook does not fasten in it.
Et utraeque species non incipiunt, nisi a lachrymali maiore, usquequo uadit paulatim, donec cooperit uisum, et prohibet lumen, et motum oculi.	And both kinds do not begin unless from the larger lacrimal duct, until it goes gradually, until it covers what is necessary, and prevents light and the movement of the eye.
Et modus operandi in incisione eius est: ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the mode of operation in its incision is: that the sick person should place his head in your bosom.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et eleua palpebram manu tua.	Then open his eyes, and lift up the eyelid with your hand.
Deinde collige ungulam cum uncino paucae duplationis, et extende eam ad superiora.	Then collect a thread with a small hook and extend it upwards.
Deinde accipe acum, et intromitte in eam pilum ex pilis equi, et bouis, aut uaccae: et sit filum forte, et duplica extremitatem acus parumper, et fige eam in medio ungulae: et penetra eam cum acu, et liga cum filo ungulam, et extende eam ad superiora: et excoria cum pilo latus ungulae quod sequitur pupillam, ac si tu serres eam cum pilo usque ad postreimnum eius.	Then take a needle and insert into it a thread made of horse hair, ox hair, or camel hair: and let the thread be strong, and double the end of the needle for a short distance, and fix it in the middle of the hoof: and pierce it with the needle, and bind the hoof with the thread, and extend it upwards: and scarify with a hair the side of the hoof which follows the pupil, and if you join it with hair until its very end.
Deinde incide residuum in radice lachrymalis cum spatumili subtili, aut cum forficibus paruis: et dimitte carnem lachrymalis naturalem, ut non accidat ex incisione eius cursus lachrymarum assiduus.	Then cut the remaining part at the root of the tear duct with a fine scalpel, or with small forceps: and let go the natural flesh of the tear duct, so that there does not happen from its incision an incessant flow of tears.
Et quandoque extenditur ungula cum uncino solo: aut cum filo, sicut diximus.	And sometimes a nail is extended with a hook on the ground: or with a thread, as we have said.
Deinde excoriatur cum spatumili leni, cuius haec est forma.	Then it shall be scraped with a spatula of gentle form.
Et caue, ne tangat spatumile tunicam corneam, et accidat in ea ruptura, et perforetur pupilla.	And be careful, lest the spatula touch the corneal tunic and a rupture occur in it, and the pupil be pierced.
Deinde post incisionem, proice in oculum aliquid salis contriti, aut ex sief facto ex ziniar, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then after the incision, throw into the eye something of salt ground, or made from sief of ziniar, and leave it until the next day.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur.	Then care for him with what is necessary, until he is healed.
Quod si ungula est non neruosa, et non potes intromittere in eam acum, neque figitur in ea uncinus, tunc multotiens curatur haec species ungulae cum medicinis, et sanatur sicut narraui in diuisione.	If the nail is not nerved and you cannot insert a needle into it, nor does a hook catch in it, then this kind of nail is often cured with medicines, and heals as I have said in the division.
Quod si uis incidere eam, tunc aperi oculum infirmi, et accipe spatumile subtile, lene, debilis acuitatis, secundum hanc formam.	If you wish to cut it, then open the eye of the sick person, and take a subtle, gentle, and slightly pointed spatula, according to this form.
Et rade ungulam desuper rasione cum subtilitate.	And shave the area from above with subtlety.
Quod si uides quod ipsa rarificatur et confringitur, et imprimit in eam rasio, tunc distilla ex hora tua in oculum ex sief facto ex ziniar, aut ex sief rubeo, aut sale trito: et opila oculum usque ad diem alium.	If you see that it itself thins and breaks, and a razor is imprinted on it, then distill from your hour in the eye from sief made from ziniar, or from red sief, or from ground salt: and close the eye until the next day.
Deinde itera super ipsam operationem, donec remoueatur totum eius.	Then repeat over the same operation until the whole thing is removed.
Nisi contrarium sit tibi in oculo apostema calidum: tunc enim dimitte ipsam, et cura apostema, donec sanetur.	If you have a hot boil in your eye, then let it alone and treat the boil until it heals.
Deinde itera operationem super ipsam cum rasione, donec sanetur.	Then repeat the operation on it with reason until it heals.
Eminentia autem carnis lachrymalis, si nocet in oculo nocumento magno, suspendatur cum uncino, et incide ex ea partem eius: et non ultimes incisionem, ut non accidat cursus lachrymarum.	The eminence of the lacrimal flesh, if it harms in the eye with great harm, is to be suspended with a hook, and an incision is made from its part. And do not make the incision until the end, so that the flow of tears does not occur.
Deinde stilla in lachrymale sief rubeum, aut factum ex ziniari, donec sanetur.	Then a drop of red lead, or prepared from cinnabar, should be put into the tear duct until it heals.
¶ De incisione Alguardenic, et carne nata in oculo.	On the incision of Alguardenic, and flesh born in the eye.
Caput XVII.	Chapter XVII.
Nascitur quandoque in quibusdam oculis hominum caro rubea composita, uel superposita, donec cooperit pupillam, aut appropinquat, aut stringit super palpebras, et fortasse conuertit palpebras ad exteriora: et assimilatur rosae balaustinae.	Sometimes in some human eyes a red fleshy mass is born, either placed upon or piled over so that it covers the pupil or approaches it or constricts over the eyelids, and perhaps turns the eyelids outward; and it resembles the rose's balustrade.
Et operatio in ea etiam est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the operation in this is also that the sick person places their head in your bosom.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et collige illam carnem totam cum uncinis conuenientibus ad illud: et tene illud cum forcipe uno, aut gesti.	Then open his eyes, and collect that whole flesh with suitable hooks to it: and hold it with one forceps, or tongs.
Deinde incide carnem in primis, donec finiatur totum eius cum incisorio.	Then cut the flesh first, until the whole of it is finished with the cutting instrument.
Et caue ab oculo, ut non laedas ipsum apud operationem: et sit incisio tua qua ipsam incidis, aut cum spatumili, quod narrauimus in incisione ungulae: aut cum forficibus paruis, cum quibus colligitur asebel, secundum quod ueniet forma eius post hoc capitulum.	And be careful about the eye so that you do not injure it during the operation: and let your incision be with the same instrument which we have described in the incision of the fingernail, or with small forceps, with which the asebel is gathered, according to what will come after this chapter.
Cum ergo completur incisio tua, et remouetur tota alguardenici, tunc imple oculum ex sale contrito: aut distilla in eum puluerem rubeum, et similia illi ex medicinis corrosiuis: et pone super oculum deforis cottum cum albugine oui: ut securetur ab apostemate calido.	When therefore the incision is complete, and the whole algue-warden has been removed, then fill the eye with salt rubbed fine: or distill into it powder red, and similar to it from corrosive medicines: and place over the eye a pad of cloth with the membrane of an egg: so that it may be secured from hot abscess.
Quod si remanet ex alguardenici aliquid, et dominatur tibi sanguis calidus, et times apostema calidum: tunc dimitte oculum, et cura ipsum cum eo quod sedat apostema.	If anything remains from the surgical procedure, and hot blood dominates you, and you fear a hot abscess: then let go of the eye, and care for it with that which soothes the abscess.
Deinde itera super ipsum cum operatione, donec sanetur.	Then repeat over it with the operation until it is healed.
Et similiter fac cum carne addita quae accidit in oculo ex hac specie.	And similarly do with flesh added which happens in the eye of this kind.
Verumtamen oportet, ut alienes curationem omnis oculi debilis ex uia naturali, aut ex uia accidentali, operando cum ferro: et non intromittas manum tuam in aliqua harum operationum, donec uideas, quod illud membrum est tolerans illam operationem.	Nevertheless, it is necessary that the care of every weak eye, whether by natural or accidental means, be operated on with iron: and do not put your hand into any of these operations until you see that that limb is enduring that operation.
¶ De collectione Sebel ex oculo.	On the collection of pus from the eye.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter XVIII.
Sebel sunt uenae rubeae quae texuntur super oculum, et prohibent uisui operationem suam: et debilitant oculum cum longitudine dierum.	There are red veins which are woven over the eye, and they prevent the sight from operating its function: and they weaken the eye as days pass.
Necesse est ergo tibi in primis, ut consideres, si oculus in quo est Sebel, est fortis, et non est in eo aegritudo aliqua, praeter Sebel: tunc collige Sebel eius.	It is therefore necessary first of all, that you consider if the eye in which the pimple is, is strong, and there is no pain in it other than the pimple: then collect the pimple from it.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo.	And it is, as you should instruct the sick person, to put their head in your bosom.
Deinde suspende illas uenas cum uncino uno, aut duobus secundum prudentiam tuam: et sit uncinus subtilis duplationis, secundum hanc formam, aut sint duo uncini gradat in corpore uno, secundum hanc formam.	Then suspend those veins with one hook, or two according to your prudence: and let the hook be a fine double one, according to this form, or let there be two hooks graded in one body, according to this form.
Deinde collige cum forficibus subtilibus illas uenas cum subtilitate, et absterge sanguinem hora post horam, donec uideas illas uenas remoueri ex oculo, et resoluuntur: et caue ne laedas oculum cum extremitatibus spatumilis.	Then collect with fine forceps those veins with subtlety, and remove the blood hour by hour, until you see those veins removed from the eye, and are resolved: and beware that you do not wound the eye with the edges of the spatula.
Et sit operatio tua in meridie coram sole, et sis firmus in operatione tua ualde: ut non incidas nisi illas uenas.	And let your operation be in midday before the sun, and be steadfast in your operation greatly: that you do not cut except those veins.
Et cum tu expleueris, tunc distilla in oculum sief uiride, aut rubeum: ut sua acuitate corrodat quod remansit ex sebel.	And when you have finished, then distill into the eye a green or red liquid: so that its sharpness corrodes what remains of the scab.
Si autem non est tibi possibile colligere illud totum in illa hora, tunc emplastra oculum cum eo, quod sedat dolorem oculi: et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur dolor eius: et securetur ab apostemate calido: deinde itera super ipsum secundum modum eundem, donec sanetur.	If it is not possible for you to collect all of it in that hour, then apply a plaster to the eye with that which soothes the pain of the eye; and leave it for several days until the pain subsides; and ensure it is free from hot suppuration; then repeat over it according to the same method until it heals.
Et haec est forma forficis.	And this is the shape of the forceps.
¶ De reductione Arissati ad nasum.	On the reduction of a dislocation to the nose.
Caput XIX.	Chapter XIX.
Nominant medici Arissati Fistulam, quam curas cum cauterio, aut cum medicina acuta comburente, secundum quod praecessit eius narratio.	Physicians call a fistula an Arissat; it is treated with a cautery, or with a sharp medicine burning, according to what has preceded in its account.
Et si non sanatur, tunc non est ingenium in ea: nisi ut findas super apostema apud natiuitatem eius, et extrahas totam humiditatem quae est in eo et pus, donec detegatur os.	And if it does not heal, then there is no skill in it; unless you find a boil at its birth and extract all the moisture which is in it and the pus, until the bone is uncovered.
Cum ergo detegitur os, et uides in eo corruptionem, aut nigredinem, tunc rade ipsum cum instrumento, cuius forma est haec.	When therefore the bone is revealed, and you see in it corruption or blackness, then scrape it with an instrument, whose shape is this.
Et nominatur Asperi capitis.	And it is called Asper's head.
Fiat ex ferro indo, et sit caput eius rotundum sicut azir, quod sit punctatum punctatione limae, aut punctatione aliskilferi punctatione subtili: et pone ipsum super locum corruptum ossis.	Make it of iron, and let its head be round like an azir, which is marked with the sharpening of a file, or the marking of an aliskilfer, finely marked: and place it upon the site of the damaged bone.
Deinde reuolue ipsum inter digitos tuos, et tu preme manum tuam parumper, donec scias quod illa corruptio iam rasa est: et fac illud aliquotiens.	Then roll it between your fingers, and you press your hand for a short time until you know that the corruption is already scraped away: and do this several times.
Deinde restaura locum cum medicinis exiccatiuis stipticis.	Then restore the place with medicinal and astringent dressings.
Si ergo consolidatur locus, et nascitur in eo caro, et abscinditur cursus saniei: et remanet quadraginta diebus, et non renouatur, et non apostematur, et non accidit in eo accidens: tunc scias quia iam sanatus est.	If therefore the place is consolidated, and flesh is born in it, and the course of healing is cut off: and it remains for forty days, and is not renewed, and does not suppurate, and no accident happens to it: then you shall know that it is now healed.
Et si non, tunc non est in eo ingenium, nisi reducere fistulam ad foramen nasi, secundum hanc formam.	And if not, then there is no talent in him, unless he reduces the fistula to the nostril hole, according to this form.
Et est, ut detegas ab osse secundo cum ferro, aut cum medicina acuta: et cum detectum est os, tunc accipe terebrum secundum hanc formam, sit extremitas ferrea, triangulata: et lignum eius sit pyramis extenuata usque ad extremitatem, sicut uides.	And it is, as you cut away from the second bone with iron, or with sharp medicine: and when the bone has been exposed, then take the terebrum according to this form, let its iron end be triangular: and let the wood of it be a pyramid tapering down to the end, just as you see.
Deinde pone illud super os ipsum: et sit illud prope lachrymale: et elonga manum tuam ab oculo parum.	Then place it over the bone itself: and let it be near the tear duct: and extend your hand from the eye a little.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum terebro, donec penetret os, et sentiat illud infirmus: per hoc quod inuenit uentum exire ex eo, quando tenet manum suam super nasum suum.	Then roll your hand with the probe until it penetrates the orifice and feels it weak; by this you will find that air comes out of it when you hold your hand over your nose.
Ergo tunc restaura locum cum medicinis stipticis exiccantibus, sicut docui te.	Therefore then restore the place with astringent medicines as I have taught you.
Cum ergo nascitur caro, et induratur locus: tunc materia quae effundebatur ad exteriora, redit ad nasum: est ergo leuius illud super infirmum.	When therefore flesh is born, and the place hardens: then the matter which flowed outwards, returns to the nose: it is therefore lighter on the weak.
¶ De reductione eminentiae Oculi.	On the reduction of the prominence of the eye.
Caput XX.	Chapter XX.
Quando eminet Oculus cum totalitate sua, et non accidit in uisu nocumentum, neque diminutio: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum: deinde phlebotomes eum: postea ponas uentosas in ceruice absque scarificatione, sed cum suctione.	When the eye projects with its entirety and there is no harm or diminution in sight, then it is necessary to loosen the patient; then phlebotomize him; afterward place ventilators in the neck without scarification, but with suction.
Deinde pone super Oculum linimentum quod fit ex acacia, et aloe, et olibano, et sarcocolla.	Then place a liniment over the eye made from acacia, and aloe, and frankincense, and sarcocolla.
Deinde stringe Oculum desuper super emplastrum cum puluillis multis.	Then bind the eye from above over the dressing with many little pads.
Et modus puluillorum est: ut accipias pannos lenes, multos, et duplicetur omnis pannus ex eis super quatuor: fac ex eis multos: deinde pone eos unum super alium, secundum quantitatem qua indiget Oculus: deinde stringe super ipsos cum panno duro strictura forti.	And the manner of some is: that you may take soft cloths, many, and every cloth be doubled from these over four: make many from them: then put them one upon another, according to the quantity that the eye needs: then bind over them with a hard cloth a strong band.
Et itera uentosas cum suctione sine scarificatione.	And repeated blowing with suction without incision.
Deinde aufer uentosas, et dimitte oculum strictum die et nocte.	Then remove the wind-filled [parts], and let the eye remain closed day and night.
Si autem ligamentum iterum mollificatur, tunc oportet ut stringatur multum: deinde aufer ligamentum post diem et noctem, sicut diximus.	If the ligament again softens, then it is necessary that it be tightly bound; then remove the ligament after a day and night, as we have said.
Si ergo uides oculum iam redisse uuae tunicae, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam, et uentosas, donec sanetur.	If therefore you see the eye already returning to its white tunic, it is good; and if not, then repeat the plasters, and pills, and strictures, and wind-bags, until it heals.
¶ De incisionie Vuae tunicae.	On the Incision of the Vaginal Pouch
Caput XXI.	Chapter XXI.
Quando accidit disruptio in tunica Vuea, deinde eminet et procedit extra palpebras sicut granum Vuae, et foedatur forma hominis propter illud, et uis incidere illud: tunc operatio in eo est, secundum quod narro: et est, ut intromittas acum in radice Vuae ab inferiori ad superiorem partem.	When rupture occurs in the tunic Vulvae, then it protrudes and proceeds outside the eyelids like a grain of Vulvae, and the form of man is defiled because of it, and the desire to cut it arises: then the operation on it is, according to what I say: and it is, that you insert a point into the root of Vulvae from the lower to the upper part.
Deinde intromitte acum aliam in qua sit filum duplum a parte lachrymalis, et fac eam penetrare: et dimitte acum primam secundum dispositionem suam.	Then introduce another needle with a double thread from the lacrimal part, and make it penetrate: and let go of the first needle according to its position.
Deinde incide locum fili dupli, et liga cum eo partem Vuae in circumitu acus: et stringe eam multum.	Then cut the place of a double thread and tie with it the part of the vein in the circumference of the needle: and tighten it very much.
Deinde extrahe acum, et pone super oculum lanam infusam in albugine oui: et dimitte eum, donec cadat filum cum Vua.	Then draw out the point, and place upon the eye wool soaked in albumen on the white of the eye; and let him go until the thread falls with glue.
Deinde cura oculum cum eo, quod confortat ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then care for the eye with that which comforts it, until the wound is healed.
Et quandoque stringitur Vua ab omni parte cum circulo ex panno, donec addat oculus eminentiam magnam.	And sometimes the eye is constricted with a circle from cloth on every side until the eye gives great prominence.
Deinde perforetur cum spatumili subtili, quod perueniat ad profundum oculi, et currat humiditas albuginea, et descendat oculus, et ingrediatur statim: deinde stringe eum, donec sanetur.	Then it shall be pierced with a fine spatula until it reaches the depth of the eye, and the moisture of the white part will come out, and the eye will descend, and immediately enter; then tighten it until it heals.
¶ De curatione Alcomnati.	On the treatment of an Alcumnatus (gangrene).
Caput XXII.	Chapter XXII.
Haec Aegritudo quae nominatur Alcomnati, non, est nisi sanies, quae aggregatur in oculo, similis aquae descendenti, et non est ipsa.	This sickness called Alcomnati is nothing else but pus that gathers in the eye, like water flowing down, and it is not itself.
Et modus operandi in ea est, ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem praeparatum, uel directum.	And the way of operating on it is, that you make the patient sit on a prepared seat, or upright.
Deinde accipe caput eius manibus tuis a partibus duabus, et moue ipsum, donec uideas saniem peruenire ad inferiora oculis tuis.	Then take the head with your hands from both parts and move it until you see the sanie come to the lower part with your eyes.
Deinde figatur, et non descendat, et absoluatur lumen: et uideat infirmus res sicut uidebat: et si non descendit inferius, scias quia est aqua.	Then it is bound and not allowed to descend, and the opening is closed: and may the sick person see things as he used to see: and if it does not descend below, know that it is water.
Si autem non praeparatur descensus saniei cum eo quod diximus, tunc fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas.	If, however, the descent of the sound is not prepared with what we have said, then make the sick person sit between your hands.
Deinde accipe spatumile subtile, et finde cum eo supra panniculum corneum parumper apud continuationem coniunctiuae cum tunica cornea in corona, donec egrediatur sanies.	Then take a fine spatula and find with it above the skin layer a short distance at the continuation of the junction with the corneal tunic in the crown, until pus comes out.
Cum ergo egreditur, tunc distilla in oculum aquam calidam in qua miscuisti mel: aut aquam in qua iam bullisti foenumgraecum et mel: deinde curetur cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When he goes out, then distill into the eye warm water in which you mixed honey: or water in which you have already boiled hay and honey: then care for it with the rest of the care until it heals.
¶ De cura aquae, quae descendit in oculo, uel cataracta.	On the treatment of water that descends into the eye, or cataract.
Caput XXIII.	Chapter XXIII.
Iam Diximus species aquae in diuisione, et quae conuenit ad perforandum sermone declarante et exponente, tunc accipe illud idem secundum sanitatem.	We have now spoken of the kinds of water used in division, and which is suitable for piercing, as has been explained and stated. Then receive the same according to health.
Tunc ergo oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas quadratum, oppositum lumini, prope solem: et liga oculum eius sanum, et stringe eum ualde: deinde palpebram oculi eius manu tua dextra, si oculus in quo est aqua, est oculus sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Therefore, it is necessary for you to make the sick person sit between your hands, square, opposite the light, near the sun: and bind his healthy eye, and tighten him well: then the eyelid of his eye with your right hand, if the eye in which there is water is the left eye; or with your left hand, if the eye is the right.
Deinde accipe manu tua dextra almagda, si oculus est sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then take with your right hand the almond if the eye is left; or with your left hand if the eye is right.
Deinde pone extremitatem almagda prope coronam per grossitudinem radii in ipsa albedine oculi apparente lachrymalis minoris: deinde impelle almagda cum uirtute: et tu reuoluis cum eo manum tuam, donec penetret in albuginem oculi: et sentias, quod almagda iam peruenit ad rem uacuam.	Then place the tip of the spatula near the crown along the thickness of the radius in the white of the eye appearing to be that of the smaller tear duct; then push the spatula with force: and you revolve with it your hand until it penetrates into the white of the eye: and feel that the spatula has already arrived at the empty space.
Et oportet, ut sit mensura itineris almagda ad profundum, mensura spacii quod est a pupilla usque ad finem nigredinis: et est corona oculi.	And it is necessary that the measure of the journey from the almond to the depth be the measure of the space which is from the pupil to the end of the blackening, and this is the crown of the eye.
Uidebis enim ea in ipsa pupilla uisione oculi, propter claritatem tunicae corneae.	You will see it in the pupil itself, in the eye's vision, because of the clarity of the cornea.
Deinde pone almagda usque ad locum in quo est aqua.	Then place the almond until it reaches the place where the water is.
Deinde preme ipsum inferius uice una post aliam.	Then press it downwards with one finger after another.
Si ergo descendit aqua statim, tunc infirmus uidet illud super quod aperit uisum suum statim, et almagda in oculo suo.	If therefore water descends, then the sick person sees it above which he opens his sight immediately, and the almond in his eye.
Deinde quiescas paululum.	Then rest for a little while.
Si ergo descendat aqua, tunc depone eam secundo, praeter quod egrediatur almagda.	If therefore water should descend, then lay it down second, except that it may leave the almond.
Quando ergo figitur, et non ascendit: tunc extrahe almagda cum facilitate: et tu reuoluis manum tuam paulatim.	When therefore it is fixed, and does not ascend: then remove the almond with ease: and you turn your hand gradually.
Deinde dissolue in aqua aliquid ex sale claro gemmae: et ablue cum eo oculum deintus.	Then dissolve in water something of clear salt gemmae: and bathe with it the eye inside.
Deinde pone extra oculum totum stuppam, aut lanam infusam oleo rosato, et albugine oui: et liga cum eo oculum sanum.	Then place a whole wad of cotton or wool soaked in rose oil and albumen into the eye, and bind the eye with it to the healthy one.
Nos autem, et illi qui sunt nostri temporis, ponimus super eum ciminum tritum cum albumine oui.	We, however, and those who are of our time, put upon it a powder of cinchona with albumin of egg.
Quod si non obedit tibi almagda ad introitum in oculum propter duriciem suam, quoniam ex hominibus est, cuius oculus est durus ualde: tunc oportet ut accipias spatumile, quod nominatur Alberid, cuius haec est forma.	If the eyelid does not yield to your entry into the eye because of its hardness, for it is from men whose eyes are hard indeed: then you must take a tool called an Alberid, which has this form.
Pefora ergo cum eo ipsam coniunctiuam tantum, et non ultimes manum tuam in foramine: et non est nisi ut facias uiam ad almagda locum subtilem.	Therefore, pierce with it only the junction itself, and do not thrust your hand into the foramen: and there is nothing else but to make a way to the almond-shaped place underneath.
Deinde intromitte almagda, secundum quod diximus.	Then introduce the almond, as we have said.
Et apud complementum operis tui, praeparetur infirmo dormitorium decenter factum, in quo dormiat super dorsum suum in domo tenebrosa: et prohibeatur ab omnibus motibus, et a tussi: et pone cibum eius illud quo lenitur natura eius: et non moueat caput suum dextra, neque sinistra omnino.	And at the completion of your work, prepare for the patient a well-made bedchamber, in which he should lie on his back in a darkened room; and forbid him all motion, and from coughing; and place before him that food which soothes his nature; and let him not move his head right or left at all.
Et sit ligamentum secundum dispositionem suam usque ad diem tertium.	And let the bandage be in its place until the third day.
Deinde solue illud in illa domo tenebrosa, et experire uisum eius: et fac eum uidere res.	Then dissolve it in that dark house, and try its nature; and make him see things.
Deinde reduc ligamentum usque ad diem septimum.	Then reduce the ligament up to the seventh day.
Et non oportet ut faciat illud in hora curationis, aut post incisionem statim: imo oportet, ut alienes illud: propterea quod aqua ascendit uelociter per aspectum uehementem.	And it is not proper that he should do this at the hour of healing, or after the incision immediately: indeed it is necessary that he should avoid this; because water rises quickly through vehement sight.
Si autem accidit apostema calidum: tunc oportet ut soluas oculum ante septimum: et rectifica illud cum eo quod sedat apostema, donec sedatur: tunc absolue ipsius uisum, et pone super faciem eius orale quo regatur uisus eius sub eo diebus aliquot, ipso existente in illa domo tenebrosa.	If a hot abscess occurs, then it is necessary that you loosen the eye before the seventh day, and rectify it with something that will soothe the abscess until it is soothed; then loose its sight, and place over its face an oral thing which regulates its sight under those days, with it being in that dark house.
Deinde egrediatur a domo gradatim, et conuersetur in casis suis.	Then he should leave his house gradually and turn back in his own case.
Et scias, quod in zaltea non excusatur discipulus a uisione aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super operationem.	And know that in surgery a pupil is not excused from viewing often; then indeed he may dare to operate.
Et iam quidem peruenit ad nos quidam ex illis qui sunt de Alayrach, qui dixit, quod factum fuit in Alayrach magdan perforatum, quo sugitur aqua.	And now indeed a certain one came to us from those who are from Al-Rayy, who said that it was made in Al-Rayy a great well, which sucks up water.
Verum ergo non uidi aliquem in terra uostra, qui fecerit illud: neque legi illud in aliquo ex libris antiquorum: et est possibile, ut sit illud nouum.	Therefore, truly I did not see anyone in your land who has done that; nor read it in any of the ancient books; and it is possible that it is new.
Et istae sunt formae specierum ex magda, ut stet super ea qui ea ignorat.	And these are the forms of kinds from the wound, so that he who is ignorant may stand upon them.
Fiant ex aere proprie: et sint extremitates eorum cum hac eadem subtilitate triangulatae, et extremitas acuta.	They shall be made of metal properly, and their extremities shall be triangular with this same subtlety, and the sharp end.
Formae magda.	Forms of the uterus.
¶ De cura Carnis natae in naso.	On the care of flesh born in the nose.
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter XXIV.
Quandoque nascuntur in naso Carnes diuersae additae, ex quibus est aliquid quod assimilatur scorpioni multorum pedum: et ex ea est caro cancerosa, lapidea, fusci coloris: et ex ea est quae est caro lenis, non fusci coloris.	Sometimes growths of different kinds are born in the nose, of which one is similar to many scorpions' feet: and from this there is cancerous flesh, stony, dusky in color; and from this there is flesh that is soft, not dusky in color.
In ea ergo quae ex istis carnibus est lenis, non fraudulenta, neque cancerosa, oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas oppositum soli, et aperi nares eius, et proiice uncinum in illas carnes: deinde trahe eas ad exteriora, et incide quod comprehendisti ex eis cum spatumili subtili acuto a parte una, donec scias quod caro tota iam ablata est.	In that which from these flesh is gentle, not fraudulent, nor cancerous, it ought to be done that you make the sick person sit between your hands opposite to the ground, and open his nostrils, and project the hook into those fleshes: then draw them to the exterior, and cut what you have grasped of them with a spatula subtle and sharp on one part, until you know that the whole flesh is already removed.
Quod si remaneret aliquid ex ea cuius abscisio non est possibilis: tunc rade illud cum uno instrumentorum subtilium cum facilitate, donec non remaneat ex eo aliquid.	If anything remained of which the removal is not possible: then scrape it with one fine instrument with ease until nothing remains of it.
Si autem sanguis tibi dominatur, aut accidat apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei per id quod oportet: aut est ex apostematibus malignis, tunc propera cauterizando eum, donec abscindatur sanguis, et auferantur omnes carnes.	If blood masters you, or a hot abscess occurs: then oppose it as is necessary; or if it is from malignant abscesses, then hasten to cauterize it until the blood is cut off and all flesh is removed.
Deinde proiiciatur in nasum post incisionem acetum, et aqua, aut uinum.	Then vinegar and water, or wine, are poured into the nose after the incision.
Si autem aperitur nasus, et procedat ex eo humiditas usque ad palatum, tunc scias quia iam sanus est.	If, however, the nose is opened and moisture proceeds from it up to the palate, then you know that it is now healed.
Si uero non penetrat humiditas, secundum quod oportet, tunc scias quod intra ipsum est caro nata in superioribus ossibus naris, ad quae non peruenit cum incisione instrumentum.	If moisture does not penetrate as it should, then know that within it is flesh born in the upper bones of the nose, to which the instrument does not reach with the incision.
Tunc ergo oportet, ut intromittas filum lini cui sit quaedam grossitudo, et noda in eo nodos multos: et pone inter omnem nodum quantitatem digiti, aut minus: et ingeniet infirmus, ut mittat extremitatem unam fili in nasum cum radio, aut cum quo possibile est ei postquam fecerit ipsum simile azer: et trahat odoratum suum, donec perueniat usque ad caassum, et egrediatur super guttur suum.	Therefore, it is necessary that you introduce a thread of linen which has some thickness, and knots many knots on it; and place between every knot the quantity of a finger, or less; and instruct the infirm person, so that he may put one end of the thread into the nose with a reed, or with whatever possible is to him after he has made it similar an azer; and draw his own scent until it comes as far as the caassum, and emerges over his throat.
Et multotiens quidem faciunt simile huic Attomi pueri in scholis: et est res facilis ei, qui uult.	And many times indeed boys similar to this Attomi make in schools: and it is an easy thing for him who wants.
Deinde pone duas extremitates fili, extremitatem unam quae egreditur super nasum, et alteram quae remansit in naso.	Then place two ends of the thread, one end which comes out over the nose, and the other which remains in the nose.
Deinde ac ministra serraturam carnis cum nodis qui sunt in filo.	Then and with a minister the closing of the flesh with knots which are on the thread.
Fac illud donec scias quod carnes iam sunt cum nodis fili.	Do this until you know that the flesh is now with knots of thread.
Deinde extrahe filum: et pone in nasum post abstersionem sanguinis licinium quod imbibisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud tribus diebus, aut plus, donec unguentum corrodat totum quod remansit ex carnibus.	Then withdraw the thread: and put it in the nose after the removal of the blood clot which you have soaked in Egyptian ointment; do this for three days, or more, until the ointment corrodes all that remains of the flesh.
Deinde pone in fine rei in nasum cannulam de plumbo, diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	Then place a lead tube at the end of the thing for a few days until it heals.
Si autem indiget curatione quae exiccet, utere illa.	If however care is needed which dries, use that one.
Ad caputpurgium faciendum, cum quo distillantur olea, et aliae medicinae in nasum, fac illud ex argento, aut aere: quod sit simile lampadi paruae, apertum sicut conchula: et meatus eius similiter.	To make a cauterizing instrument for the nose, which is used to distill oil and other medicines into the nostril, make it of silver or copper; let it be like a small lamp, open like a shell; and its passage similar to that.
Et si uis fac cannulam clausam, sicut canna.	And if you wish to make a closed tube, like a reed.
Et conchula instrumenti ad caputpurgium faciendum, sit plena, detecta: cui sit manubrium in postremo eius, cum quo teneas ipsam, quando calefacis in ea oleum, aut quod uis ex succis, et rebus fluxibilibus.	And the instrument for making a surgical probe should be full and open-ended: which should have a handle at its end, with which you hold it when you heat oil in it, or whatever else from juices and flowing things.
Et haec est forma instrumenti.	And this is the form of the instrument.
¶ De cura Thelul nasi.	On the treatment of a nose injury.
Caput XXV.	Chapter XXV.
Multotiens nascitur in extremitate nasi Thelul, et magnificatur, et augmentatur cum diebus, donec foedus fit aspectus eius.	Many times a tumor is born at the extremity of the nose, and it grows larger, and increases with days until its appearance becomes foul.
Et propter illud oportet, ut in cidas illud in principio apparitionis eius, et eradices totum eius.	And therefore it is necessary that at the beginning of its appearance, you should cut away this and eradicate its roots entirely.
Deinde pone super locum, aut cauterium, aut medicinam comburentem quae stat loco eius.	Then place upon the spot, either a cautery, or burning medicine which stands in its place.
Si ergo tardatur incisio eius, donec magnificetur, tunc considera, si est lapideum, durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro: quoniam apostema est cancerosum.	If therefore the incision is delayed until it increases in size, then consider if it is stony, hard, dark-colored, with few sensations: then do not touch it with iron, because it is a cancerous abscess.
Multotiens enim uidi, qui incidit hmoni apostema, et accidit ex eo malicia magna super illum qui ipsum habebat.	Many times indeed I have seen one who fell ill with a collection of pus and much evil befell him who had it.
Et si apostema est lenis tactus, non fusci coloris, et uides quod incisio possibilis est in toto eius, tunc euacua infirmum, et incide ipsum sine timore, absque pauore: et cura locum cum eo quod exiccat et constringit, donec sanetur.	And if the abscess is mild to the touch, not dusky in color, and you see that incision is possible throughout its whole, then evacuate the sick person, and cut into it without fear, without trembling: and care for the place with something that dries and constricts, until it heals.
¶ De sutura nasi, et labii, et auris.	On the suture of the nose, and lip, and ear.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter XXVI.
Scias Quia quando accidit solutio continuitatis in una harum cartilaginum, parum confert in ea operatio, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	Know that when there is a loosening of continuity in one of these cartilages, it is little help to operate on it, except in some people.
Oportet ergo quando accidit alicui aliquid ex illo, ut consideres, si est uulnus recens cum sanguine suo: et tunc aggrega duolabia uulneris cum sutura: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Therefore, when something of that sort happens to someone, you should consider if it is a wound fresh with its own blood: and then gather the edges of the wound with suture; then take care of it until it heals.
Et si solutionis continuitatis labia iam separata sunt, et facta est unaquaeque pars sana: tunc oportet ut excories omnem partem a cute sua apparente, donec sanguinetur.	And if the lips of continuity have already been separated, and each part has been made healthy: then it is necessary that you scrape off the entire part with its own sharp edge until it bleeds.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cum sutura, et stringe ea, et pulueriza super ipsum sanguinem draconis, et olibanum trita: et pone supra pulueres frustum emplastri diafinicon, et alicuius alterius ex emplastris consolidatiuis: et dimitte ipsum ligatum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then gather together the two lips with suture, and tighten them, and pulverize upon it the blood of dragons, and frankincense ground; and put above the powders a piece of diaphana plaster, and some other kind of solidifying plaster: and dismiss him bound for two days, or three.
Deinde solue ipsum, et permuta medicinam: et dimitte ipsum, donec abscindantur fila per se.	Then dissolve it, and change the medicine: and let it be until the threads are cut by themselves.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointment until it heals.
Modus autem suturae est, ut aggreges solutionem continuitatis, aut cum acubus, sicut narrauimus in sutura uentris: aut aggrega solutionem cum filo, sicut feci te scire.	The method of sewing is to bring together the edges of the rupture, either with needles, as we have recounted in the stitching of the abdomen: or bring the edges together with thread, as I have told you.
¶ De extractione nodorum labiorum.	On the removal of lip nodes.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter XXVII.
Multis Quidem hominibus accidunt plaerumque in interioribus labiorum suorum apostemata dura similia granis herbi: et quaedam eorum minora, et maiora.	Many people indeed suffer from abscesses, most of them in the inner lips of their mouth, hard like grains of herb; and some are smaller, and some larger.
Ergo oportet ut conuertas labium, et findas super omnem nodum eius, et suspendas ipsum cum uncino, et incidas ipsum ab omni parte.	Therefore, it is necessary that you convert the lip, and bind it over every node of it, and suspend it with a hook, and cut it from every part.
Deinde impleas locum post incisionem zegi trito, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then fill the place after the incision with pounded wool until the blood is stopped.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto, et curetur locus cum eo, in quo est stipticitas, usquequo sanentur uulnera.	Then it shall be covered with vinegar, and the place where there is a clotting shall be cared for with it until the wounds are healed.
¶ De incisione carnis natae super gingiuam.	On the cutting of flesh born above the gum.
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter XXVIII.
Multotiens nascitur super gingiuam caro addiat, quam antiqui nominant abuluss.	Many times flesh is born above the gum, which the ancients call an abulus.
Oportet ergo ut suspendas eam cum uncino: aut teneas eam cum forcipibus, et incidas eam apud radicem suam, et dimittas saniem currere, aut sanguinem.	Therefore you ought to suspend it with a hook: or hold it with forceps, and cut it at its root, and let the pus or blood flow.
Deinde pone super locum zegi tritum, aut alios pulueres stipticos, exiccatiuos.	Then place over the rubbed zege spot, or other powdered astringents, drying agents.
Quod si redit illa caro post curationem, nam multotiens redit, tunc incide eam secundo, et cauteriza ipsam: ipsa namque non redit post cauterium.	If that flesh returns after treatment, for it often does return, then cut into it a second time and cauterize it: for it will not return after cauterization.
¶ De rasione Dentium cum ferro.	On extracting teeth with iron.
Caput XXIX.	Chapter XXIX.
Quandoque aggregantur in superficiebus Dentium ab interiori et extetiori parte, et inter gingiuas cortices asperi, turpes, et quandoque denigrantur, et citrini fiunt, et uirides, donec peruenit ex illo corruptio ad gingiuam, et foedi fiunt dentes per illud.	Sometimes they are gathered on the surfaces of the teeth from the inner and outer part, and between the gums, rough, unsightly, and sometimes they turn yellow and green until corruption comes from it to the gum, and the teeth become foul through this.
Oportet ergo ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et caput eius in sinu tuo, et rade molam et dentem, in quo apparent tibi cortices, et res similis arenae: donec non remaneat ex eis aliquid, et similiter fac de nigredine, et uiriditate, et citrinitate, et aliis donec mundentur.	Therefore you must make the sick person sit between your hands, and his head in your bosom, and with a rasp and file, on which appear to you crusts, and something like sand: until nothing remains of them, and similarly do of blackness, and greenness, and yellowness, and others until they are cleansed.
Si ergo auferatur quod in eis est a principio rasionis, bonum est: et si non, tunc itera super eos rasionem die alio, secundo, et tertio, donec ad ultimum perueniat studium in eo quod uis.	If therefore that which is in them from the beginning of reason is removed, it is good: and if not, then iterate over them reasoning on another day, second, and third, until the last study comes to what you wish.
Et scias, quod dens indiget rasoriis diuersarum formarum, multarum figurarum: secundum quod praeparatur operationi tuae: proptera, quod rasorium quo raditur dens ab inferiori parte, est aliud a rasorio quo raditur inter dentes, secundum formas alias.	And know that the tooth needs razors of different forms and figures, according to how you prepare for your operation; therefore, the razor with which the tooth is shaved from the lower part is different from the razor with which the tooth is shaved between the teeth, according to other forms.
Et istae formae rasoriorum sint apud te praeparatae, quas uides.	And these forms of razors should be prepared for you, which you see.
¶ De extractione doloris Dentium.	On the Extraction of Toothache.
Caput XXX.	Chapter XXX.
Oportet ut cures Dentem a dolore suo cum omni ingenio, et tardes in eradicatione eius.	One must treat a tooth with pain with all one's skill, and be tardy in its extraction.
Non est enim quod uicem eius suppleat quando eradicatur: quoniam est substantia sublimis: donec quando non est excusatio de eradicatione eius, tunc oportet quando cogitur infirmus eradicare ipsum, ut firmetur, et certificetur apud te dens dolens.	For there is nothing that can replace it when it is removed: because it is a sublime substance: so that unless there is an excuse for its removal, then when the infirm person is forced to remove it, he must strengthen it and be certain with you of the aching tooth.
Multotiens enim decipit infirmum dolor, et putat quia est in dente saha et eradicat ipsum: deinde non recedit dolor, donec eradicetur dens infirmus.	For many times indeed does pain deceive the sick man, and thinks that it is in the tooth's nerve and pulls it out; then the pain does not recede until the weak tooth is pulled out.
Nos enim iam uidimus illud ex operatione phlebotomatorum.	For we have now seen that from the operation of vein-cutters.
Cum ergo certificatur apud te dens dolens ipsemet, tunc oportet ut scarifices in circumitu dentis cum spatumili, in quo sit quiddam uirtutis, donec soluatur gingiua ab omni parte: deinde moue ipsum digitis tuis, aut cum forcipibus subtilibus in primis paulatim, donec concutias ipsum.	When therefore it is certified to you that a tooth aches itself, then it is necessary that you scarify around the tooth with a spatula, in which there is some virtue, until the gums are loosened from every part; then move it with your fingers, or with subtle forceps first gradually, until you shake it.
Deinde loca tunc in eo forcipes magnos locatione bona, et caput infirmi inter genua tua: quod iam bene tenuisti, ita quod non moueatur: deinde trahe dentem secundum rectitudinem, ut non frangas ipsum.	Then place the large forceps in that location, and the head of the patient between your knees: which you have already held well so that it does not move; then pull the tooth according to a straight line, so that you do not break it.
Si ergo non egreditur, tunc accipe aliquod illorum instrumentorum, et intromitte ipsum sub eo ab omni parte cum facilitate, et conare motionem eius, sicut fecisti in primis.	If therefore it does not emerge, then take some of those instruments and introduce it under it from every side with ease, and try the movement of it, just as you did at first.
Si autem dens est perforatus, aut corrosus: tunc oportet ut impleas illud foramen panno: et stringas ipsum cum extremitate radii subtilis, ut non frangatur in hora constrictionis tuae super ipsum cum forcipibus.	If, however, the tooth is perforated or corroded: then it is necessary that you fill that hole with a cloth: and bind it with the extremity of a fine thread, so that it does not break in the hour of your constriction upon it with forceps.
Et oportet, ut exquisite agas cum scarificatione in circumitu gingiuae ab omni parte multum.	And it is necessary that you carefully perform the incision around the gum on every part much.
Et custodi fortitudinem tuam, ut non frangas ipsum, et remaneat pars eius, et redeat super infirmum ex ea malicia quae sit maior dolore eius primo.	And guard your strength so that you do not break it, and let its part remain, and return above the infirm from that evil which is greater pain of it first.
Et caue, ne facias illud quod ignorantes faciunt phlebotomatores in festinatione sua, et audacia ipsorum super eradicationem eius, praeter quod administrent illud quod narrauimus.	And beware, lest you do what ignorant phlebotomists do in their haste and their boldness in the removal of it, besides that which we have recounted.
Multotiens enim faciunt euenire super homines infirmitates magnas, quarum difficiliores sunt ut frangantur, et remaneant radices eius omnes, aut quaedam earum: aut ut extrahant ipsum cum quibusdam ossibus mandibulae: sicut testificati sumus multotiens illud.	Many times indeed they cause great diseases to happen to men, of which the more difficult are to break and remain roots of them all or some of them: or to extract him with some bones of the jaw: as we have been testified many times this.
Deinde colluatur post eradicationem eius cum uino, aut cum aceto et sale.	Then it shall be covered after its removal with wine, or vinegar and salt.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis ex locis (multotiens enim accidit) tunc tere aliquid ex zegi, et imple cum eo locum: et si non, cauteriza ipsum si non confert tibi zegi.	If it happens that blood flows from the places (for often this happens), then press something out of gauze, and fill the place with it; and if not, cauterize it if you are not able to use gauze.
Formae forcipum subtilium quibus mouetur dens in primis, sint longarum extremitatum, breuis manubrii, grossi, ut non duplicentur quando cum eis premitur super dentem: sint sicut uides grossorum manubriorum, donec quando stringis cum eis, non dent seipsas, neque duplicentur: breuium extremitatum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut ex faled decenter facti, directarum extremitatum: et in eorum extremitatibus sint dentes, quorum quidam ingrediantur in quosdam, et stringant constrictione decenti, forti.	The shapes of fine forceps which are used for moving teeth first, let their long ends be, short handles, thick, so that they do not double when with them is pressed upon the tooth: let them be like you see of handles which are thick until when you tighten them, they do not bend themselves nor double: short ends, and let them be made of iron or from steel well-made, straight ends. And in their ends let there be teeth, of some of which enter into some, and tightly bind by a decent, strong constriction.
Et quandoque fiunt extremitates sicut forma oris auis quae nominatur ciconia, et sunt fortis constrictionis.	And sometimes extremities are made like the shape of the beak of a bird called a stork, and they are of strong constriction.
¶ De eradicatione Dentium, et extractione ossium mandibularum fractorum.	On the removal of teeth and the extraction of fractured jawbones.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter XXXI.
Quando remanet apud eradicationem Dentis qui frangitur aliquid, tunc oportet ut ponas super locum cotum cum butyro die uno, aut duobus diebus, donec mollificetur locus: deinde intromitte ad ipsum algasti, aut forcipes: quorum extremitates assimilantur ori auis quae nominatur ciconia.	When something remains at the site of a broken tooth's extraction, it is necessary to place butter on the area for one or two days, until the place softens; then introduce into it an algasti, or forceps, whose extremities resemble the beak of a bird called a stork.
Forma autem haec est forcipum.	The shape of this is a forceps.
Sint extremitates eorum factae sicut lima deintus: aut sicut aliskilfegi.	Let their extremities be made like a file inwards: or like an awl.
Si ergo non obedit tibi ad exitum cum istis forcipibus, tunc oportet, ut caues super radicem, et detegas carnem totam, et intromittas instrumentum quod nominatur Palanca parua, cuius forma est haec.	If therefore it does not obey you towards the exit with these forceps, then it is necessary that you hollow above the root, and uncover all the flesh, and introduce the instrument which is called Little Lever, whose form is this.
Sit breuis extremitatis, grossae parumper: et non sit imbibitum, ut non frangatur.	Let the short end of the extremity be somewhat thick and not soaked, so that it does not break.
Si ergo egreditur radix per illud, est bonum: et si non, iuuare oportet cum istis instrumentis aliis quorum formae sunt istae.	If therefore the root comes out through that, it is good: and if not, it is necessary to help with these other instruments whose shapes are these.
Forma primi triangulatae extremitatis, in qua est quaedam grossitudo.	The form of the first triangular extremity, in which there is some thickness.
Forma triangulatae extremitatis subtilis.	The form of a slender pointed extremity.
Etiam iuuatur cum hoc instrumento habente duos ramos, cuius haec est forma.	It is also used with this instrument having two branches, whose shape is this.
Et cum aliis instrumentis et ferramentis quae praecesserunt in rasione dentium.	And with other instruments and tools which preceded in the extraction of teeth.
Etiam sit iuuamentum cum hoc instrumento quod assimilatur uncino magno, huius formae, triangulatae extremitatis tortae, in qua est quiddam grossitudinis, ut non frangatur: et sit non imbibitum.	Also be the wound instrument with this which is assimilated to a great hook, of this shape, triangular tip twisted, in which there is something of thickness so that it does not break; and let it not be soaked.
Et scias, quod instrumenta dentium sunt multa: et similiter reliqua instrumenta non computantur, et artifex prudens, subtilis in arte sua inuenit per se ipsum instrumentum, secundum quod significant ei operatio et aegritudines ipsae.	And know that instruments for teeth are many: and similarly the rest of the instruments are not counted, and a prudent craftsman, subtle in his art, finds for himself the instrument, according to what the operation and the ills themselves signify to him.
Quoniam ex agritudinibus sunt ad quas non dixerunt antiqui instrumentum, propter diuersitatem specierum earum.	Because they are from agriculture and those things which the ancients did not say about instruments because of the diversity of their kinds.
Si autem frangatur os ex mandibula, aut ex aliis ossibus oris, aut putrefit: tunc perscrutare super ipsum in loco suo cum eo quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis et forcipibus quae dixi in extractione radicum, et iuuare cum gesti, cuius forma est haec.	If a bone of the jaw or any other bone of the mouth is fractured, or rots: then examine it in its place with that which is fitting to it from instruments and forceps which I have said in the extraction of roots, and help with the pliers, whose shape is this.
Sit in eo quiddam grossitudinis paulatim, ut stringatur, uel teneatur cum eo os, et non fugiat et uadat, donec egrediatur os: et restaura locum cum medicinis conuenientibus ad illud.	Let there be something of thickness gradually, so that it may tighten or be held with the bone, and not escape and flow, until the bone comes out: and restore the place with appropriate medicines to it.
Si autem in osse est putredo parua, tunc rade ipsum a putredine sua, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	If there is a small amount of rot in the bone, then scrape it away from its rot, and care for it until it heals.
De serratura Dentium eminentium super alios.	Of the locking together of teeth that are higher than others.
Caput XXXII.	Chapter XXXII.
Quando Dentes eminent non secundum cursum suum naturalem, foeda fit per illud forma: et praecipue quando accidit illud in mulieribus, et puellis, scilicet uenalibus.	When teeth protrude beyond their natural course, a foul form is produced; and especially when this happens in women and girls, namely those of the vulva.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	Therefore, it is necessary that you consider.
Nam si dens est natus post dentem alium, et non locatur, uel est possibilis eius serratura, neque limatura ipsius: tunc eradica ipsum: et si est annexus cum dente alio, tunc incide ipsum cum isto instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	If a tooth is born after another tooth and does not fit, or it is possible to file it down, then remove it. And if it is attached to another tooth, then cut it with this instrument, whose shape is this.
Est simile rostro paruo, et fit ex ferro indo, acutae extremitatis ualde.	It is similar in form to a small beak, and is made of tempered iron, with a very sharp point.
Et sit incisio tua qua ipsum incidis in diebus multis, et propter duriciem dentis, et ut non commoueatur alius ex dentibus.	Let your incision be made on that tooth for many days, and because of the hardness of the tooth, so that it is not moved by another tooth.
Si autem est eminens expositus limaturae suae: tunc lima ipsum cum lima ex indo, cuius forma est haec.	If it is prominent, exposed from its scraping: then a file him with a file from India, whose form is this.
Sit totum ex indo, et manubrium eius minutorum punctorum ualdae, sicut lima cum qua fiunt acus: cum quo limetur dens paulatim in diebus multis cum facilitate, ut non commoueatur dens, et cadat: deinde leni ipsum, in fine rade ipsum cum quibusdam rasoriis.	Let the whole thing be from ivory and the handle of it of small punctures like a file with which needles are made: with which the tooth is gradually filed in many days with ease, so that the tooth is not disturbed, and falls out; then smooth it, at the end scrape it with certain razors.
Quod si est dens, ex quo frangatur pars, et laedit linguam: tunc oportet ut limes eum etiam, donec auferatur asperitas illius fractionis, et aequetur: et applanetur, et non laedat linguam, neque corrumpat sermonem.	If it is a tooth that has broken off and hurts the tongue, then it is necessary to grind it down until the roughness of the fracture is removed and it is smoothed out, so that it does not hurt the tongue nor impair speech.
¶ De retatione Dentium cum filis auri.	On the retention of teeth with gold wires.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter XXXIII.
Quando accidit Dentibus anterioribus concussio et commotio a percussione, aut casu: et non potest infirmus stringere super illud quod comedit ut non cadat: et curasti eos cum medicinis stipticis, et non ualuit curatio: tunc ingenium in eis est, ut stringantur cum filo auri: quoniam argentum fit uiride, et putrefit post dies: sed aurum nunquam mutatur.	When a concussion and shaking of the front teeth occurs from a blow or an accident; and the weak one cannot grasp what he eats so that it does not fall; and you have treated them with staunching medicines, and the treatment did not avail: then the mind is inclined in them to be bound together with gold wire; because silver turns green and rots after days; but gold never changes.
Et sit filum medium in subtilitate et grossicie secundum quantitatem quod capiat inter Dentes.	And let the thread be of medium thickness and coarseness according to the quantity that it takes between the teeth.
Et forma quidem retationis est, ut accipias filum, et intromittas duplum eius inter duos dentes sanos: deinde texeas cum duabus extremitatibus fili inter dentes motos, siue unus sit, aut plures, donec peruenias cum tela usque ad dentem sanum alterius partis.	And the form of this suturing is that you take a thread and insert half of it between two healthy teeth; then you weave with both ends of the thread between the loose teeth, whether there be one or several, until you reach the healthy tooth on the other side.
Deinde itera texturam usque ad partem a qua incaepisti: et stringe manum tuam cum subtilitate et sapientia, donec non remoueatur prorsus: et sit constrictio tua qua stringis filum, apud radices dentium, ut non euadat.	Then again weave the texture until you reach the part from which you began: and grasp your hand with subtlety and wisdom, until it is moved no longer: and let your constriction, as you tighten the thread, at the roots of the teeth, be such that it does not escape.
Deinde incide extremitates fili superfluentes cum forficibus: et aggrega utrumque, et conuerte eas cum gesti: et occulta ipsas inter dentem sanum et dentem motum, ut non laedat linguam: deinde dimittatur ita strictum dum remanet.	Then cut the superfluous ends of the thread with scissors: and gather both together, and turn them with a twist: and hide them between the sound tooth and the moving tooth, so that it does not injure the tongue: then let it be left thus tight until it remains.
Si autem soluitur, aut inciditur, stringe eos cum filo alio, et stabit cum eo taliter tempore toto.	If it is loosened or cut, bind them with another thread, and it will remain so throughout the entire time.
Et haec est forma Dentium, et figura retationis duorum dentium sanorum, et duorum dentium motorum, sicut uides.	And this is the form of teeth, and the figure of the rotation of two sound teeth, and two moved teeth, as you see.
Et quandoque fit, ut redeat dens unus, aut duo post casum urriusque in locis suis, et retentur sicut narrauimus, et remaneant: et non facit illud nisi artifex, prudens, et expertus.	And sometimes it happens, that one or two teeth return to their places after a blow, and remain there as we have narrated, and this is done only by an artificer who is wise and experienced.
Et quandoque aptatur aliquod ex ossibus uaccinis: et fit ex eo sicut forma dentis, et ponitur in loco, ex quo munitur dens et stringitur, sicut diximus: et remanet, et seruitur cum eo tempore longo.	And sometimes a piece from the bones of the jaw is fitted and shaped like a tooth, and it is put in its place, so that it strengthens the tooth and is tightened as we have said; and it remains, and serves with it for a long time.
¶ De incisione ligamenti quod accidit sub lingua, et prohibet loquelam.	On an incision of the ligament that happens under the tongue and prevents speech.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter XXXIV.
Quandoque ligamentum hoc quod accidit sub lingua, est aut naturale, cum quo nascitur homo, aut accidentale, a uulnere quod iam consolidatum est.	Sometimes this ligament which occurs under the tongue is either natural, with which a person is born, or accidental, from a wound that has already healed.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi in capite eius in sinu tuo, et eleua linguam eius: deinde incide illud ligamentum neruosum per latitudinem, donec soluatur lingua a retentione sua.	And the operation on it is, that you open the mouth of the sick person in his head in your armpit, and elevate his tongue; then cut that nerve ligament across, until the tongue is released from its retention.
Quod si in eo fuerit quiddam duriciei et nodationis, et fuerit illud ex consolidatione uulneris: tunc proiice in illud uncinum, et finde illud per latitudinem, donec incidas ligamentum, et soluatur nodatio.	If there is something hard and knotted in it, and it is from the clotting of a wound, then throw into it a hook, and find it along its width until you cut the ligament, and the knot is loosened.
Et caue, ne sit fissura in profundo carnis, et incidas arteriam illic, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And beware lest there be a fissure deep in the flesh, and you cut the artery there, and blood flow occurs.
Deinde colluatur in uestigio incisionis cum aqua rosata, aut cum aceto, aut aqua frigida.	Then it shall be washed in the wound with rose water, or vinegar, or cold water.
Deinde pone sub lingua licinium ex lino, quod teneat infirmus in omni nocte: ut non consolidetur secundo.	Then place under the tongue a piece of linen, which the sick person shall keep in all night: so that it will not become consolidated again.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc pone super locum zegi tritum.	If it happens that there is a flow of blood, then place on the location ground and rubbed.
Si uero uincit te sanguis, tunc cauteriza locum cum cauterio lentiginoso, quod conuenit ad illud: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	If blood overcomes you, then cauterize the place with a dull cautery, which is suitable for that; then take care of it with the rest of the treatment, until it is healed.
¶ De extractione Ranulae quae fit sub lingua.	On the extraction of a ranula which occurs under the tongue.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter XXXV.
Quandoque accidit sub lingua apostema quod assimilatur Ranae paruae, prohibens linguam ab operatione sua naturali: et fortasse magnificatur adeo, donec implet os.	Sometimes a boil occurs under the tongue that resembles a small frog, preventing the tongue from performing its natural function: and perhaps it grows so large until it fills the mouth.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi coram sole: et considera apostema.	And the operation on it is, that you open the sore of the infirm before the sun: and consider the abscess.
Si ergo uides ipsum fusci coloris, aut nigri, durum, cui non inuenit infirmus sensum: tunc non tangas ipsum, quoniam est cancer.	If therefore you see it of a dusky color, or black, hard, which finds no sensation by the sick person; then do not touch it, for it is cancer.
Et si est decliue ad albedinem, in quo est humiditas, tunc proiice in ipsum uncinum, et incide ipsum cum spatumili subtili, et libera ipsum ab omni parte.	And if it is inclined to the groin, where there is moisture, then throw into it the hook, and cut it with a fine spatula, and free it from every part.
Quod si uincit te sanguis in hora tuae operationis, tunc pone super ipsum zegi tritum, donec abscindatur sanguis: deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec extrahas ipsum cum complemento eius.	If blood defeats you in the hour of your operation, then place on it crushed ziziphus, until the bleeding stops; then return to your operation, until you have extracted it with its complement.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto et sale: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then it shall be covered with vinegar and salt: and care for it with the rest of the appropriate treatment until it heals.
¶ De curatione apostematis duarum Amigdalarum.	On the treatment of abscesses of the two tonsils.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter XXXVI.
Quandoque accidunt inter guttur godad, id est, glandulae, quae similantur algodad, quae accidunt deforis: et nominantur duae Amigdalae: quas quando curas cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non sanantur, tunc considera.	Sometimes there occur between the throat and tongue, that is, glands, which are similar to amigdalae, which occur in the mouth: and these are named two amigdalae: which when treated with that which we said in the division, and do not heal, then consider.
Si ergo est apostema durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro.	If therefore a boil is hard, dusky in color, with few sensations: then do not touch it with iron.
Et si est rubei coloris, et radix eius est grossa: tunc non tangas ipsum etiam cum ferro, timens fluxum sanguinis, imo dimitte ipsum, donec maturetur.	And if it is of a red color and its root is thick: then do not touch it even with iron, fearing the flow of blood, rather leave it alone until it matures.
Et tunc aut perforabis ipsum: aut rumpetur per se.	And then either you will pierce it, or it will break by itself.
Et si est albi coloris, rotundum, et est radix eius subtilis: tunc oportet ipsum incidi.	And if it is white in color, round, and its root is slender: then it ought to be cut.
Et operatio in ipso est, ut consideres ante operationem suam, si quieuit apostema eius calidum quiete completum, aut imminuitur quadam diminutione: tunc ergo fac sedere infirmum coram sole, et caput eius sit in sinu tuo: et aperi os eius, et accipiat seruiens inter manus suas, et premat linguam eius inferius cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	And the operation on him is, that before you operate, see if his abscess has calmed down in peace, and is complete, or has diminished by some reduction: then, therefore, make the sick man sit facing the sun, and his head be in your bosom: and open his mouth, and let a servant receive between his hands, and press his tongue downwards with an instrument whose shape is this.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere, quod sit subtile sicut cultellus.	Let it be made from silver or copper, which is as fine as a knife.
Cum ergo premis cum eo linguam, et ostenditur tibi apostema, et cadit super ipsum uisus tuus: tunc accipe uncinum, et fige ipsum in amigdalam, et extrahe eam ad exteriora quantum potes, praeter quod trahas cum ea aliquid ex tunicis.	When therefore you press upon it with him and a pimple is shown to you and falls upon it by your sight: then take an awl and fix it in the tonsil and draw it out to the outside as much as you can, besides drawing up with it something from the coats.
Deinde incide eam cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma quae sequitur.	Then cut it with an instrument, whose form follows.
Assimilatur forficibus: uerumtamen extremitates eius sint curuatae, ita quod orificium cuiusque earum est in directo alterius acute: unde cura ut sit ex ferro indo, aut alfuled imbibitum.	It is like forceps; however, its extremities should be curved so that the opening of each is directed directly at the other sharply: therefore care should be taken that it be made of iron or soaked in alum.
Si autem non est praesens hoc instrumentum, tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili, cuius haec est forma.	If this instrument is not present, then cut it with a spatula, whose form is this.
Sit acutum a parte una, non acutum a parte altera.	Be sharp on one side, not sharp on the other.
Et postquam incidis amigdalam unam, incide alteram secundum hanc eandem speciem incisionis.	And after you have cut one tonsil, cut the other following this same type of incision.
Deinde post incisionem gargarizet infirmus cum aqua frigida, aut cum aceto et aqua.	Then after the incision the sick person gargle with cold water, or with vinegar and water.
Si autem accidat ei fluxus sanguinis, gargarizet cum aqua in qua bulliti sunt cortices granatorum: aut folia myrti, et similia illis ex stipticis, donec abscindatur fluxus sanguinis: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	If it happens to him that there is bleeding, let him gargle with water in which the rinds of pomegranates have been boiled: or myrtle leaves, and things similar to these from astringents, until the bleeding stops; then take care of him until he heals.
Et quandoque nascuntur in gutture apostemata alia, praeter amigdalas duas.	And sometimes abscesses are born in the throat other than the two tonsils.
Incide ergo ea secundum quod dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum aequaliter.	Therefore, cut it according to what I said in the incision of two tonsils equally.
Et ego quidem iam medicatus fui mulierem ex apostemate, quod natum erat inter guttur eius, quod trahebat ad fuscedinem, pauci sensus, quod iam fere clauserat guttur: et mulier respirabat a meatu stricto, et iam prohibuerat ei comestionem, et potum aquae: et iam peruenerat ad mortem, si remansisset uno die, aut duobus diebus.	And I myself had treated a woman from an abscess which was born between her throat, which she drew towards the blackness, with few senses, which it almost entirely closed her throat: and the woman was breathing through a narrow passage, and already it had prevented her from eating, and drinking water: and already she had come close to death, if she had remained for one day, or two days.
Et apostema tantum ascenderat, quod emiserat duos ramos, donec exierant super duo foramina nasi.	And the abscess had grown so large that it had emitted two branches until they came out above the two nostrils.
Properaui ergo festinanter, et fixi in unum eorum uncinum.	I therefore hastened and fixed one of them hooks in place.
Deinde traxi ipsum, et tracta ex eo est portio magna.	Then I drew it out, and a large portion came out with it.
Deinde abscidi eam, ubi comprehendi ex foramine nasi.	Then cut it where it is grasped from the hole of the nose.
Deinde feci illud ei quod processit ex foramine nasi altero.	Then I did that which had protruded from the other nostril opening.
Deinde aperui os eius, et pressi linguam eius: et postea fixi uncinum in ipsum apostema: deinde abscidi ex eo partem eius, et non cucurrit ex eo nisi sanguis paucus: absolutum est ergo guttur mulieris, et incepit statim bibere aquam, deinde accepit ex cibo.	Then I opened her mouth and pressed down on her tongue: and afterward I fixed a hook into the abscess; then I cut away a part of it, and there came out of it only a little blood: therefore the woman's throat was healed, and she immediately began to drink water, then she took some food.
Non ergo cessaui incidere ex illo apostemate multotiens tempore longo: et apostema succedebat loco eius quod incidebam, donec prolongatum est nimis et cum ea illud.	Therefore I did not cease to cut into that abscess many times over a long period of time; and an abscess would succeed the place which I was cutting, until it became too long and with it that.
Ingeniaui ergo, et cauterizaui apostema inter guttur.	Therefore, I conceived and cauterized an abscess between the throat.
Stetit ergo ab additione: deinde ambulaui a parte, et non sciui quid fecit Deus cum ea post me.	Therefore, I set it up; then I walked away from the part, and I did not know what God did with it after me.
¶ De incisione apostematis uuulae.	On the incision of a vulval abscess.
Caput XXXVII.	Chapter XXXVII.
Quando descendit catarrus ad uuulam, et apostematur, et est long: tunc ipsa nominatur perpendicularis: et si est in inferiori parte grossa, rotunda, tunc ipsa nominatur uua.	When catarrh descends to the womb, and it becomes ulcerated, and is long: then itself is called perpendicular. And if it is in the lower part thick, round, then itself is called womb.
Quando curatur cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: et uides quod apostema calidum quieuit ab ea, et est subtilis: tunc oportet ut incidas eam.	When it is treated as we have said in the division, and the treatment does not help: and you see that the hot abscess has quieted from it, and is subtle: then it is necessary that you cut into it.
Et quae ex ea est aggregata rotunda, et non est ei longitudo, et est sanguinea, aut fusci coloris, aut nigri, et non est ei sensus: tunc oportet ut deuites incisionem eius.	And if from it there is a rounded mass gathered together, and it has no length, and it is bloody, or brownish in color, or black, and it has no feeling: then it is necessary to make an incision into it.
In ea enim est timor super infirmum.	There is fear over the weak in that.
Oportet ergo quando uides eam secundum modum quem dixi ex albedine, et longitudine sua, ut facias sedere infirmum coram sole: et premas linguam eius cum instrumento, cuius praecessit narratio: deinde fige uncinum in uuam, et trahe eam inferius: et incide eam cum uno duorum instrumentorum quae dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum.	Therefore, when you see it according to the manner which I have said, and its width, and length, that you make the sick person sit facing the sun; and press his tongue with an instrument, of which the previous account was given; then fix the hook in the uvula, and pull it downwards; and cut it with one of the two instruments which I have said for the incision of the two tonsils.
Et oportet ut non incidas ex ea, nisi illud quod additur super naturalem terminum sine additione.	And it is necessary that you do not cut from it, except what is added above the natural termination without addition.
Nam si tu incidis ex ea plus, laedes uocem et sermonem.	If you cut more from it, you will injure voice and speech.
Deinde post incisionem utere eo quod narrauimus in incisione duarum amigdalarum: et cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then after the incision use what we have narrated concerning the incision of two tonsils: and take care of it until it heals.
Si autem terretur infirmus ab incisione: tunc oportet ut utaris ingenio in cauterizatione eius absque timore et pauore.	If, however, the patient fears the incision, then it is necessary that you use your ingenuity in its cauterization without fear and trembling.
Et modus cauterii in ea non est, nisi cum aqua acuta: et est, ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	And the way of cauterizing in it is, except with sharp water; and it is, as you place the head of the sick person in your bosom.
Deinde preme linguam eius cum instrumento quod diximus.	Then press the tongue of him with the instrument that we said.
Deinde accipe ex aqua quam dixi tibi in capitulo cauterizandi, et confice cum ea calcem non extinctam, et pone eam non spissam, neque subtilem, et imple ex ea concauitatem huius instrumenti, cuius haec est forma.	Then take from the water which I told you about in the chapter on cauterization, and mix it with unquenched lime, and put it not thick, nor thin, and fill the cavity of this instrument with it, whose form is this.
Sit extremitati eius in qua ponitur medicina concauitas, sicut concauitas cochlearis radii.	Let the extremity to which the medicine is applied be concave, like the concavity of a spoon's handle.
Et pone instrumentum cum medicina super uuulam ipsam: et infirmus sit iacens super latus suum, ut currat saliua ex ore eius ex intrinseca medicina, ut non descendat ex ea ad guttur ipsius aliquid, et laedat ipsum.	And place the instrument with medicine upon the wound itself: and let the patient be lying on his side, so that the saliva from his mouth may flow out of the inner medicine, so that it may not descend from it to his throat, and harm him.
Deinde tene manum tuam cum medicina.	Then hold your hand with medicine.
Et tu ex primas eam super uuulam quantitate medietatis horae, donec uideas eam iam denigratam, et sedatam mordicationem medicinae.	And you will apply it from the first hour over the wound in half the quantity of the hour until you see it already blackened and subdued by the medicinal bite.
Et si uis ut accipias cotum, et inuoluas ipsum super extremitatem radii, et infundas cotum cum medicina, et intromittas radium cum coto in cannulam desuper, donec adhaereat cotum super uuulam.	And if you wish to receive the cotum and wrap it over the end of the radius, and fill the cotum with medicine, and introduce the radius with the cotum into a tube from above, until the cotum adheres to the uulum.
Fac illud multotiens, donec consequaris quod uis de cauterizatione uuae.	Do this many times until you achieve what you desire from the cauterization of the vein.
Deinde dimitte eam: ipsa namque arescit et cadit post tres dies, aut quatuor.	Then let it fall away; for itself dries up and falls off after three days, or four.
Quod si indiges ut iteres medicinam, itera ipsam: et post cauterizationem absterge in circumitu uuae cum coto imbibito in butyro, et mundifica cum eo quod est in circumitu eius ex medicina: et colluatur cum aqua frigida.	If you wish to repeat the medicine, repeat it; and after cauterization wipe around the wound with a cloth soaked in butter, and cleanse with that which is around it of the medicine; and cover it with cold water.
Et curetur extrinsecus cum embrocis, et deintus cum gargarismis, donec sanetur.	And it is treated externally with compresses, and internally with gargles, until it heals.
Haec ergo species curationis est salubrior incisione et longinquior a timore.	Therefore this kind of healing is healthier with incision and farther from fear.
Et quandoque curatur uuula etiam cum eo quod est subtilius quam cauterium et incisio: curatur enim cum suffumigatione, secundum hunc modum.	And sometimes an ulcer is treated even when it is more subtle than cauterization and incision: for it is treated with fumigation, according to this method.
Sume calamentum, et hyssopum, et origanum, et rutam, et sseah, et chamomillam, et abrotanum, et similia eis ex herbis: et aggrega ea omnia, aut quaedam eorum in olla, et submergantur cum aceto, et bulliant: et olla sit lutata cum luto decenter: et sit in medio ollae foramen, super quod componatur instrumentum concauum secundum hunc modum.	Take a cloth, and hyssop, and oregano, and rue, and sesame, and chamomile, and wormwood, and similar herbs of these: and gather all these, or some of them in a pot, and submerge them with vinegar, and let them boil: and let the pot be lined with clay properly: and let there be a hole in the middle of the pot, on which an instrument is placed concave according to this way.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere: et intromittatur extremitas, in qua est granatum, in os infirmi, donec ascendat uapor ad uuulam super cannulam, donec obscuretur uuula multum.	Make it from silver or copper, and insert the end, which has the grain, into the bone of the infirm until the vapor ascends to the bladder above the tube, until the bladder is darkened much.
Deinde itera super ipsam multotiens, donec arescat.	Then repeat over it many times until it becomes white.
Et caue, ne facias hanc curationem in principio aduentus apostematis.	And beware, that you do not make this cure at the beginning of the arrival of the abscess.
Plaerumque enim addit in apostemate: et non oportet ut facias illud nisi apud declinationem apostematis eius calidi.	Generally, he adds to an abscess: and it should not be done unless at the decline of its heat.
Si autem non est praesens tibi hoc instrumentum, tunc accipe cannam, et compone in extremitate eius corticem oui: ut non comburatur os infirmi: quoniam cortex oui prohibet uaporem comburere os: et haec est ex bona curatione cum salute.	If this instrument is not present to you, then take a tube, and put cork on the end of it: so that the bone of the sick person does not burn: because cork prevents steam from burning the bone: and this is good cure with health.
¶ De extractione spinarum, et ossium de gula.	On the extraction of thorns, and bones from the throat.
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter XXXVII.
Multotiens adhaeret in gutture os, aut spina piscis, aut aliud.	Often a piece of bone adheres in the throat, or a fish spine, or something else.
Oportet ergo ut extrahas quod ex eis est apparens super quod cadit uisus, postquam premis linguam cum instrumento apud solem, et declaratur tibi quod est in gutture.	Therefore, you ought to remove what is apparent from them which falls under the sight, after pressing the tongue with an instrument at the sun, and it is declared to you what is in the throat.
Et quod non apparet tibi et occultatur in gutture, oportet ut facias uomere infirmum antequam digeratur cibus in stomacho.	And that which does not appear to you and is hidden in the throat, it is necessary for you to make vomit weak before food is digested in the stomach.
Fortasse enim egredietur res annexa per uomitum.	Perhaps indeed it will emerge the annexed thing through vomit.
Aut deglutiat infirmus frustum napi, aut radicem lactucae, aut deglutiat buccellam panis sicci: aut accipiat frustum spongiae marinae siccae lenis: et liga ipsum in filo, deinde deglutiat ipsum.	Let the sick person swallow a piece of barley bread, or the root of lettuce, or swallow a mouthful of dry bread: or take a piece of dried marine sponge, soft, and tie it with a thread, then swallow it.
Cum ergo peruenit ad locum ubi sunt spinae, aut os, et extrahitur, tunc egreditur.	When therefore it arrives at the place where the spines or bones are, and is drawn out, then it comes forth.
Si ergo non egreditur cum eo quod diximus: tunc utere instrumento ex plumbo secundum hanc formam.	If therefore it does not come out with what we said: then use an instrument of lead according to this form.
Sit grossius quam Radius parumper, et in extremitate eius sit curuitas, quam intromittat in guttur suum cum facilitate: et ipse habeat caput suum eleuatum sursum.	Let it be thicker than the radius a little, and at its end let there be a curvature, so that it may enter its gullet with ease; and let it also have its head elevated upward.
Et caueat a tactu suae epiglotis, ut non accidat ei tussis, et impellat cum eo os, aut spinam, aut intromittat ipsum medicus manu sua.	And let him beware of touching his epiglottis, so that it does not happen to him that he coughs and drives in with it his mouth, or a pin, or introduce himself the physician with his hand.
Verum quod infirmus intromittat, hoc est melius: propter scientiam suam de loco rei annexae: et impellat inferius, aut trahat manum suam cum instrumento sursum, totum illud secundum quantitatem quae praeparatur ei, donec egrediatur.	Truly it is better if the sick person himself inserts it, because of his knowledge of the location of the thing attached: and he should push downwards, or draw his hand with the instrument upwards, the whole thing according to the quantity which is prepared for him, until it emerges.
¶ De extractione Sanguisugae.	On the removal of the leech.
Caput XXXIX.	Chapter XXXIX.
Quando medicatur sanguisuga cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex curatione cum medicinis, et non confert, tunc considera in gutture infirmi coram sole, siue apud solem postquam premis linguam eius cum instrumento quod narraui tibi.	When a leech is treated with what I said in the division on treatment with medicines, and it does not help, then consider in the throat of the sick person in front of the sun, or in the sun after pressing his tongue with the instrument that I told you about.
Si ergo cadit uisus tuus super sanguisugam, extrahe eam cum uncino paruo, aut cum gesti subtilibus decenter.	If therefore your sight falls upon a leech, remove it with a small hook, or with fine tweezers.
Quod si non est possibile cum eis: tunc accipe cannulam concauam, et intromitte eam in guttur infirmi usque prope guttur: deinde intromitte in concauitatem cannulae ferrum ignitum cum igne.	If it is not possible with them: then take a concave tube and insert it into the throat of the sick person up to almost the gullet; then insert into the cavity of the tube a burning iron with fire.
Fac illud multotiens: et abstineat infirmus ab aqua tota die.	Do this many times: and let the sick person abstain from water all day.
Deinde accipiat uitreatam plenam aqua frigida, et aperiat os eius in ea: et colluat os suum cum ea, et non deglutiat ex ea aliquid: et moueat aquam una hora post aliam cum manu sua.	Then let him take a mouthful of cold water, and open his mouth in it: and put his mouth into it, and do not swallow anything from it: and move the water every hour with his hand.
Sanguisuga enim ilico cum sentit aquam cadit.	For when the leech feels water, it immediately falls.
Si autem non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc suffumiga infirmum cum cimicibus, aut cum asa cum instrumento quod narraui in suffumigatione uuulae.	If it does not come out as we have narrated, then fumigate the sick person with cumin, or with asa with the instrument which I have narrated in the fumigation of the vulva.
Fac illud multotiens, quoniam ipsa cadet.	Do this many times, because it itself will fall.
Et modus operationis in suffumigatione est, ut accipias ollam, in qua sint prunae uiuae cum igne: et olla sit cooperta cum coopertorio, in cuius medio sit foramen: et componatur in illo foramine extremitas instrumenti.	And the method of operation in fumigation is that you take a pot, in which are live plums with fire: and let the pot be covered with a lid, in the middle of which there is a hole: and let the extremity of the instrument be placed in that hole.
Deinde proiice suffumigationem, et ponat infirmus os suum in extremitate cannulae, et claudat os suum, ut non egrediatur suffumigatio, donec scias quod suffumigatio iam peruenit ad sanguisugam.	Then throw the fumigation and let the sick person put his mouth at the end of the tube, and close his mouth so that the fumigation does not go out, until you know that the fumigation has already reached the bloodsucker.
Nam sanguisuga statim cadet.	For the leech will immediately fall off.
Quod si non cadit, tunc itera suffumigationem multotiens.	If it does not fall, then repeat fumigation many times.
Et toleret infirmus sitim, et comedat salsa, et allia, et non bibat aquam.	And let the weak endure thirst, and eat salt and other things, and not drink water.
Necesse est ergo ut egrediatur cum hoc regimine.	It is therefore necessary that he should depart with this regimen.
Et haec est forma instrumenti cum quo extrahitur sanguisuga ex gutture, quando cadit super ipsam uisus.	And this is the form of the instrument with which bloodsucker is extracted from the throat, when it falls upon itself.
Est simile forcipibus, sicut uides: nisi quia est ei haee curuitas quae intromittitur ad guttur.	It is similar to forceps, as you see: except that it has this curvature which goes into the throat.
Et extremitas eius similis ori auis quae nominatur ciconia, in quo est asperitas limae: quando comprehendit aliquid, non dimittit ipsum omnino.	And its extremity is similar to the beak of a bird called a stork, in which there is the roughness of a file: when it grasps something, it does not let go of it at all.
¶ De apertione Apostematum, et eorum sectione, et cura in genere.	On the opening of abscesses, and their incision, and care in general.
Caput XL.	Chapter XL.
Apostematum species sunt multae, multorum modorum, secundum quod uenit rememoratio eorum, scilicet unius, et unius in hoc libro: et sunt diuersae in perforatione eorum, et sectione ipsorum ex duobus modis.	There are many kinds of boils, many different ways, according to how they are remembered, namely one, and one in this book: and they are diverse in their piercing, and their cutting from two ways.
Quorum unus est ex specie apostematis in seipso, et eo quod comprehendit ex humiditatibus.	Of which one is of a kind of abscesses within itself, and that which it comprehends from humidities.
Et modus secundus est propter loca, in quibus accidit ex corpore.	And the second mode is because of the places, in which it happens from the body.
Quoniam apostema accidens in capite, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in ano: et apostema accidens in loco carnoso, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in iuncturis: et unicuique eorum est iudicium suum ex operatione.	Because an abscess occurring on the head is different from an abscess occurring in the anus: and an abscess occurring in a fleshy place is different from an abscess occurring in the joints: and to each of these their own judgment by operation.
Et ex apostematibus sunt quae non oportet ut perforentur, nisi post maturationem saniei in eis, et complementum eius: et ex eis sunt, quae oportet ut perforentur, dum sunt cruda, et non maturantur secundum complementum.	And from abscesses there are some which ought not to be pierced unless after the ripening of the healing in them, and the completion of it: and from these there are some which ought to be pierced while they are raw, and do not ripen according to the completion.
Sicut apostemata quae sunt propinqua iuncturis.	Like abscesses that are near the joints.
Quoniam apostema quando accidit prope iuncturam, et prolongatur esse eius, donec putrefit quod est in circumitu eius fortasse corrumpuntur ligamenta, aut nerui illius iuncturae: quare est caussa propior contractionis illius membri.	Because an abscess when it happens near a joint and is prolonged to be so, until it rots what is around it, perhaps the ligaments or nerves of that joint are corrupted: therefore it is a proper cause of the contraction of that limb.
Aut est apostema apud membrum principale: quoniam si tu tardas perforationem eius, donec maturetur, nocebit uel illi, uel per illud membro principali.	Either it is an abscess at a principal member: because if you delay its piercing until it matures, it will harm either him or through that principal member.
Aut est prope anum, perfora ergo ipsum immaturum: et non oportet, ut perfores, apostema crudum, non completae digestionis, nisi quod est prope anum, ut non putrefiat profundum, et longetur ad interiora ani, et fiat fistula, aut fiat in termino eius quod non sanatur.	If it is near the anus, pierce it unripe: and it is not necessary to pierce a fresh abscess, not completely digested, unless it is near the anus so that it does not putrefy deep, and lengthens to the interior of the anus, and becomes a fistula, or becomes at its end what does not heal.
Oportet ut scias horam perforationis apostematis, quod maturatum est secundum complementum: et est apud sedationem doloris, recessionem febris, et diminutionem rubedinis, et pulsationis, et acuitatem capitis apostematis: et reliqua signa.	It is necessary that you know the hour of perforation of an abscess, which has matured according to its completion: and this is found in the sedation of pain, the recession of fever, and the diminution of redness, and pulsation, and the sharpness of the head of the abscess: and other signs.
Et oportet, ut facias eandem perforationem in inferiori loco apostematis, et uehementioris eminentiae: et sit perforatio uadens in longitudine corporis, si apostemata sunt in partibus manuum et pedum, et locis lacertorum, et chordarum, et neruorum, et arteriarum, et ad ultimum in omnibus locis aequalibus, quibus non est reflexio.	And it is necessary that you make the same perforation in the lower part of the abscess and of the more prominent eminence: and let the perforation be sharp in length of the body, if the abscesses are in the parts of the hands and feet, and places of the limbs, and tendons, and nerves, and arteries, and finally in all equal places, where there is no reflection.
In illis autem quae reflectuntur, uade cum perforatione secundum illud membrum.	In those things which are reflected, go with a perforation according to that limb.
Quando uero apostema est in locis carnosis: tunc melius est ut dimittas perforationem eius, donec confirmetur eius digestio, sicut diximus secundum complementum.	When an abscess is in fleshy places, it is better to let its discharge out, until its digestion is confirmed, as we said according to the completion.
Quoniam si tu perforas ipsum ante illud, prolongatur cursus uirus ex eo, et est multae sordis et sordiciei, et fortasse indurantur labia eius, et profunditas eius.	For if you pierce it before that place, the course of the pus from it is prolonged, and there is much dirt and filth, and perhaps the lips of it and its depth will harden.
Et quaedam apostemata perforantur secundum latitudinem corporis apud necessitatem: aut secundum illud quo indiget membrum.	And certain abscesses are pierced according to the width of the body as needed; or according to what the limb needs.
Et oportet, ut administres in apostematibus paruis perforationem paruam, et in apostematibus magnis perforationem amplam: aut sectiones multas per similitudinem magnitudinis apostematis.	And it is necessary that you administer in small abscesses a small perforation, and in large abscesses a wide perforation; or many sections according to the similarity of the size of the abscess.
Et sunt ex apostematibus, in quibus oportet ut concauetur cutis: et incidatur quando iam facta est sicut pannus, et facta est in termino, quod iam mortua est: sicut illud quod accidit in multis, ut dubelet, et bubonibus.	And they are from abscesses, in which it is necessary that the skin be concaved: and it should be cut when already made like a cloth, and made at the end, which is already dead: such as happens to many, so that it may ulcerate, and buboes.
Et ex eis sunt quae secantur sectione habente tres angulos.	And among these are those that are cut with a three-angled incision.
Et ex eis est, ex quo inciditur sicut figura folii myrti.	And of these there is one which occurs like the figure of a myrtle leaf.
Sicut apostema inguinum.	Like an inguinal abscess.
Et ex eis sunt in quibus administratur sectio rotunda, et sectio lunaris: et similes eis ex sectionibus.	And among these there are those in which a round incision is administered, and a lunar incision: and similar to these incisions.
Illud uero cui non est caput, sicut sunt apostemata lenia superficialia, oportet ut perfores ipsum perforatione superficiali, uel plana tantum.	For that which has no head, such as superficially soft boils, it is necessary to perforate it with a superficial or only flat puncture.
Et oportet, quando apostema est grossum, et iam collegit saniem multam, et perforas ipsum, ut non properes et extrahas pus totum in illa hora: imo extrahe ex ipso partem eius.	And it is necessary, when the abscess is large and has already collected much pus, and you pierce it, that you do not hasten and extract all the pus in that hour: rather, extract a part of it.
Deinde opila apostema usque ad diem alium.	Then apply a poultice to the abscess until the next day.
Deinde extrahe quiddam ex pus iterum.	Then remove something from the pus again.
Fac illud multotiens secundum gradationem, donec egrediatur: praecipue si infirmus est debilis uirtutis, aut mulier praegnans, aut puer paruus, aur senex decrepitus: spiritus enim animalis ab animali multotiens resoluitur cum egressione saniei: et fortasse moritur infirmus, et tu non percipis.	Do this many times according to the gradation until it comes out: especially if the man is weak in strength, or a pregnant woman, or a small child, or an old man decrepit, for indeed the animal spirit is much dissipated from the animal with the discharge of phlegm: and perhaps the weak one dies, and you do not perceive it.
Caue ergo hoc capitulum cautela magna.	Therefore, this chapter should be read with great caution.
Et post perforationem tuam, qua ista perforas apostemata, oportet ut abstergas uulnus: et considera.	And after you have pierced your abscess, it is necessary that you cleanse the wound and consider.
Si ergo est uulnus apostematis paruum, aut est sectio plana, tunc administra licinia ex lino, aut coto antiquo.	If therefore is a wound of little inflammation, or is a flat incision, then administer a poultice from linen, or old cloth.
Et si est apostema magnum, et fissurae perforationis multae sunt, oportet tunc ut intromittas in omnem fissuram licinium, donec perueniant adinuicem.	And if there is a large abscess and there are many fissures of perforation, it is then necessary that you insert into each fissure licorice until they come to meet each other.
Et si in apostemate abscidisti partem cutis, aut in circumitu concauasti eam: tunc oportet ut impleas eam coto ueteri, aut sicut quando texitur pannus, aut raditur lanugine lini absque humiditate: et stringe ipsum usque ad tertium diem.	And if in an abscess you have cut away a part of the skin, or in its circumference have hollowed it out: then it is necessary that you fill it with sheep's wool, or as when a bandage is applied, or be powdered with flax lint without moisture: and bind it until the third day.
Deinde proiice ipsum, et cura illud cum eo quod oportet ex unguento, donec sanetur.	Then throw it out, and care for it with that which is necessary from ointment, until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis in hora tuae operationis, tunc administra aquam frigidam, et acetum, postquam imbibitur in eis pannus: et ponis ipsum super locum fluxus sanguinis multotiens.	If blood flow occurs during your operation, then administer cold water and vinegar after a cloth has been soaked in them: and place it over the place of blood flow many times.
Si autem perseuerat fluxus sanguinis, tunc oportet ut administres regimen, et curationem, et pulueres, quae narraui in locis multis huius nostri libri, et ex diuisione.	If the flow of blood persisted, then it is necessary that you administer a regimen and treatment and powders, which I have recounted in many places in this book of mine, and from the division.
Si autem est in tempore hyemis, et locus apostematis est multorum neruorum: tunc oportet ut infundas puluillos cum uino, et oleo calidis: et ponas eos super loca.	If it is wintertime, and the site of the abscess is near many nerves, then you should pour hot pills mixed with wine and oil onto the place.
Et si fuerit in aestate, et loca sunt carnosa: tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos imbibitos in aqua, et oleo, aut eum uino et oleo, et totum illud frigidum.	And if it be in summer, and the places are fleshy: then it is necessary that you place poultices soaked in water, and oil, or him with wine and oil, and the whole cold.
Donec quando erit dies tertius, sicut diximus, tunc oportet ut soluas apostema, et abstergas ipsum, et administres in curatione eius quod ei conuenit, donec sanetur.	Until the third day, as we have said, then it is necessary that you loosen the abscess, and cleanse it, and administer to its cure what is fitting for it, until it heals.
Hoc est ergo quod necessarium est ex cognitione curationis apostematum uniuersaliter.	This is therefore what is necessary from the knowledge of the treatment of abscesses universally.
Secundum semitam uero distinctionis, iam dixi de omni apostemate, qualiter est uia ad curationem eius capitulatim singulariter.	According to the method of distinction, I have already said about every kind of abscess, how the way to its cure is taken chapter by chapter individually.
¶ De sectione apostematum quae accidunt in cute capitis.	On the incision of boils that occur in the scalp.
Caput XLI.	Chapter XLIX.
Accidunt in cute capitis apostemata parua, et sunt ex speciebus Nodorum, quos continent tunicae, quae sunt eis sacci: quasi ipsa sint hausolati gallinae.	Small abscesses occur in the skin of the head, and they are of the kind of boils, which contain pouches, which are like little bags of a hen's udder.
Et ipsorum species sunt multae.	And their kinds are many.
Ex eis sunt pingues: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditatem similem limo: et ex eis quae continent humiditatem similem frisatis et pultibus: et eis similibus, et ex eis sunt, quae sunt lapidea dura.	Some of them are fatty; and some contain moisture similar to mud; and some contain moisture similar to gruel and porridge; and the like, and some are hard and stony.
Et in sectione omnium, et ipsorum extractione non est timor, dum apud ipsorum sectionem non facit contrarietatem arteria.	And in the sectioning of all and their extraction there is no fear, as long as it does not oppose an artery at their sectioning.
Et operatio in sectione eorum est, ut experiaris ea cum instrumento, cuius forma uenit post haec, quod nominatur Intromissum, donec scias quid contineat.	And the operation in their cutting is, that you may experience it with an instrument, whose form comes after these, which is named Intromissum, until you know what it contains.
Nam si est illud quod continet humiditas, tunc seca ipsum sectione secundum longitudinem sectione superficiali: secundum hanc formam.	If it contains moisture, then dry it out with a cutting along its length, superficially: according to this form.
Et incipe cum sectione ex linea b. ad lineam, g. Cum ergo euacuatur humiditas, tunc excoria kistin quae continet illam humiditatem, et non dimittas ex ea aliquid penitus.	And begin with a cut from line b to line g. When the moisture has been evacuated, then scrape out the cyst which contains that moisture, and do not let anything come out of it completely.
Multotiens enim redit, si remanet ex ea aliquid.	Many times indeed it returns, if anything remains of it.
Deinde submerge cotum in unguento aegyptio, si est praesens: et si non, in aqua et sale: et imple cum eo uulnus, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then immerse the cotton in Egyptian ointment, if it is present: and if not, in water and salt: and fill the wound with it, and leave it until the next day.
Ipsum enim corrodet quod remansit ex kisti.	For it will also corrode that which remains of the cyst.
Deinde itera super ipsum cotum cum aegyptio secundo, et tertio, et si indiges illo, donec confidas quia non remanserit ex kisti aliquid, tunc enim cura uulnus cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then repeat upon the same wound with the Egyptian second, and third, and if it does not suit you with that, until you are confident that nothing will remain from the cyst, then take care of the wound with ointment, until it is healed.
Quod si apostema continet nodum pinguem: tunc seca ipsum secundum hanc formam, sectione habente formam crucis: et proiice uncinos inter duolabia sectionis, et excoria ipsum ab omni parte: et conare uirtutem tuam in extractione tunicae quae continet ipsum.	If it contains a fleshy node, then cut it according to this form, with the incision having the shape of a cross: and throw hooks between the lips of the incision, and scrape it from every part: and strive your strength in extracting the tunic that contains it.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi arteria, tunc fac illud quod narrabo tibi post.	If an artery does opposition for you, then do that which I will tell you after this.
Et similiter fac in apostemate, si est lapideum, ex sectione, et curatione eadem, secundum quod diximus.	And similarly do in an abscess, if it is stony, from the cutting and the same care, according to what we have said.
Et sectio super apostema lapideum est facilior: quoniam est pauci sanguinis et humiditatis.	And the section over a stony abscess is easier; because it has little blood and moisture.
Et quandoque sunt quaedam horum apostematum quae sunt in capite in quibusdam hominibus, cum quibus penitus non est humiditas.	And sometimes there are some of these abscesses that are in the head in certain men, with which there is no moisture at all deep within.
Quod est: quia ego secui super apostema in capite mulieris uetulae, et inueni apostema sicut lapis solidus et durus, asper, albus, qui non poterat frangi: et si percuteretur cum eo aliquis proiiciendo, uulnerat ipsum.	That is because I cut into an abscess on the head of an old woman, and I found an abscess like a solid and hard stone, rough, white, which could not be broken; and if anyone struck it with something throwing, it would wound him.
In aliis uero apostematibus accidentibus in capite, praeter haec scilicet apostemata quae accidunt in capitibus puerorum, et apud radices aurium, sectio eorum omnium sit sectio superficialis.	In other abscesses occurring in the head, besides these namely abscesses that occur in the heads of children, and at the roots of the ears, the section of all of them should be a superficial section.
Vel pone perforationem eorum semper ab inferiori parte eorum, ut alleuietur cursus saniei ad inferiora.	Or place the perforation of them always from the lower part of them, so that the course of healing may be eased to the lower parts.
Deinde cura ea cum eo quod conuenit eis ex curatione.	Then care should be taken with that which is suitable for healing them.
¶ De sectione Strophularum in collo.	On cutting the windpipe constrictions in the neck.
Caput XLII.	Chapter XLII.
Multotiens acccidunt ista apostemata in collo, et sub assellis, et inguinibus: et quandoque accidunt in reliquo corpore.	Very often these abscesses occur in the neck, and under the arm pits, and in the groin: and sometimes they occur in the rest of the body.
Et super illa quae ex eis accidunt in collo, sunt unum, et multa: et generantur ab inuicem: et omnis Strophula ex eis est intra tunicam propriam ei, sicut est in nodis et apostematibus capitis, sicut narrauimus.	And above those which happen to them in the neck, there are one and many: and they are generated from each other: and every Strophula is from them within its own tunic, just as it is in knots and abscesses of the head, as we have narrated.
Et species harum Strophularum sunt multae.	And there are many kinds of these Strophulars.
Et ex eis enim sunt lapideae: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates: et ex eis sunt malignae, quae non obediunt curationi.	And of these there are stones: and of these there are those which contain humors: and of these there are malignant ones, which do not obey cure.
In illa ergo quam ex eis uides bonae dispositionis in tactu, cuius manifestum est propinquum colori cutis, et mouetur ad omnem partem, et non est annexa cum neruis colli, neque cum guidegi, neque cum arteria, neque est profunda: oportet ut seces eam sectione superficiali a superiori parte ad inferiorem partem corporis ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. et excoria eam ab omni parte: et extende duo labia cutis cum uncino, aut cum uncinis multis, si indiges illo, sicut diximus in apostematibus capitis, et extrahe eam paulatim.	In that one therefore which you see of good disposition in touch, whose manifest color is close to the skin, and moves to every part, and is not attached with nerves of the neck, nor with guidegi, nor with artery, nor is deep: it is necessary that you cut it with a superficial incision from the upper part to the lower part of the body from line b. to line g., and scrape it from every part: and extend two lips of the skin with a hook, or with many hooks, if you need it, as we said in abscesses of the head, and extract it gradually.
Et est super cautelam, ut non incidatur uena, aut neruus.	And it is a precaution that one should not hit a vein or a nerve.
Et sit spatumile non acutum ualde: ut non addat tibi manum tuam cum incisione, aut inquietet infirmum, et incidas quod non est necesse.	And let the spatula not be too sharp: so that it not add your hand with the incision, or trouble the sick person, and cut what is not necessary.
Si autem incidis uenam, aut arteriam, aut prohibet te ab operatione, tunc pone in uulnus zegi tritum, aut quosdam pulueres qui abscindunt sanguinem, et stringe uulnus, et dimitte ipsum, donec quiescat acuitas apostematis, et mollificetur uulnus: uel incipit et uult putrefieri.	If you cut a vein or an artery, and this prevents you from operating, then place in the wound crushed zege or some powders that stop blood flow, and tightly bind the wound, and leave it until the sharpness of the abscess subsides and the wound softens: or until it begins to want to putrefy.
Nam sanguis abscinditur tuncia Redi ergo ad operationem tuam, donec compleas.	For blood is cut off with the tunic.  Therefore go back to your operation until you have finished it.
Deinde inquire digito tuo indice, si remansit aliquid ex Strophulis aliis paruis: ergo incide eas, et munda eas.	Then inquire with your index finger if anything remains of the small strophuli; therefore cut them and cleanse them.
Quod si est in radice Strophulae uena magna: tunc oportet ut non incidas illam Strophulam ex radice sua: imo oportet ut liges eam cum filo duplato forti, et dimittas eam donec cadat per se absque nocumento.	If a large vein is in the root of the strangulation: then it is necessary that you do not cut that strangulation from its root: rather it is necessary that you tie it with double strong thread, and let it fall by itself without harm.
Deinde imple uulnus coto ueteri, quod iam submersisti in unguento aegyptio.	Then fill the wound with cotton wool which you have already submerged in Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum.	Then care for it.
Si inciditur Strophula tota, tunc oportet ut aggreges labia duo uulneris: et suas ipsum statim, postquam uides quia prorsus non remansit superfluitas.	If the entire strophula is cut, then it is necessary to join the two lips of the wound together; and its own, immediately after you see that there is no longer any superfluity.
Si autem uides quod remansit superfluitas propter magnitudinem Strophulae, tunc oportet ut intendas ad incidendam radicem eius, et extrahendam eam: et administra suturam quam diximus.	If, however, you see that there remains an excess because of the size of the Strophula, then it is necessary that you extend yourself to cut its root and remove it: and administer the suture which we said.
Et quae ex Strophulis continet humiditates, perfora illam perforatione superficiali: ut appareat tibi locus maturitatis eius: et pone perforationem ab eo quod sequitur inferius corporis, sicut diximus.	And what contains moisture from the strophules, perforate it with a superficial perforation: so that the place of its maturity appears to you: and place the perforation below where follows the lower part of the body, as we said.
Deinde administra post perforationem licinia cum unguento, et similia eis, ut corrodat quod remansit ex corruptione, donec quando uides uulnus iam mundatum esse: tunc cura ipsum cum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	After the perforation, administer a poultice with ointment and similar things so that it will corrode what remains of the corruption until when you see the wound already cleansed; then care for it with an ointment that generates flesh until it is healed.
¶ De sectione Epiglotis ab apostemate intra guttur accidente.	On the cutting away of the epiglottis due to an abscess within the throat.
Caput XLIII.	Chapter XLIII.
Dixerunt antiqui hanc sectionem in Epigloti, et non uidi aliquem in terra nostra, qui eam fecerit: et haec est scriptura sermonis eorum.	The ancients said that this incision was made in the epiglottis, and I did not see anyone in our land who had done it; and this is the writing of their words.
In habentibus autem synanchiam, oportet ut deuitetur sectio Epiglotis: cum non fiat iuuamentum per illud: propterea, quod omnes uenae et pulmo sunt infirmi.	When someone has a strangulation, it is necessary to make a section of the epiglottis: because if this is not done, no help comes because all the veins and lungs are weak.
In illis uero qui habent apostema calidum in ore, aut gutture, aut duabus amigdalis, quando non est aegritudo in cannali, oportet uti sectione Epiglotis, ad fugiendum ex perditione quae fit ex praefocatione.	In those who have a hot abscess in the mouth, or throat, or at both tonsils, when there is no pain in the canal, it is necessary to use a section of the epiglottis to avoid destruction which occurs from pre-inflammation.
Oportet ergo quando uolumus illud, ut secemus Epiglotim sub tribus circulis Epiglotis, aut quatuor, sectione parua per latitudinem, in eo quod est inter duos circulos per quantitatem, quod sit sectio in sifac, non in cartilagine: et iste quidem locus est conueniens sectioni, quoniam est priuatus carne, et uasa sanguinis ab eo sunt longinqua.	Therefore when we want to cut the epiglottis, under three or four circles of the epiglottis, it is necessary with a small incision across, in that which is between two circles by the amount, that the section be in the fascia and not in cartilage: and this place is convenient for the section because it is devoid of flesh, and blood vessels are far from it.
Quod si medicator est timidus, tunc oportet ut extendat cutem gutturis cum uncino.	If the surgeon is timid, then he ought to extend the skin of the throat with a hook.
Deinde findat cutem, donec quando peruenit ad cannalem: deuitet uas sanguinis, si uidet ex eis aliquid.	Then he cuts the skin until he comes to the canal: if he sees anything from them (the vessels of blood), he evacuates it.
Deinde secet sifac quod narrauimus: et significatur super sectionem cannalis ex phlegmate quod egreditur ex ea, cum eo quod disrumpitur, et abscisione uocis.	Then he cuts the siphon which we have recounted: and it is signified above the incision of the channel from the phlegm that issues from it, with that which is broken and the cutting off of the voice.
Et dimitte uulnus apertum tempore aliquo.	And leave the open wound for some time.
Cum ergo remouetur hora in qua timetur praefocatio, aggrega duo labia uulneris cutis, et sue ipsam solam absque cartilagine.	When therefore it is removed at the hour when cataract is feared, collect together the two lips of the wound of skin, and sew itself alone without cartilage.
Deinde administra medicinas quae faciunt nasci carnem, usquequo sanetur.	Then administer medicines that cause flesh to grow, until it is healed.
Inquit Albucasis.	Says Albucasis.
Summa huius sermonis quem narrauimus, expositio non est, nisi quando uident, quod aliquod horum apostematum iam opilauit guttur infirmi: et sublimatus est infirmus super mortem, et uult intersecari anhelitus eius: uadunt ad secandum Epiglotim, ut respiret infirmus super locum uulneris quadam respiratione, et saluetur a morte: et propter hoc praeceperunt dimittere uulnus apertum, donec consumatur malicia aegritudinis, et est malicia eius tribus diebus, et quasi ipsa: tunc ergo praecaeperunt suere uulnus, et curare ipsum, donec sanetur.	The summary of this discourse which we have narrated is not an exposition, unless when they see that some of these abscesses has already opened the throat of the sick person: and the sick person has been raised up above death, and wants to be intersected by his breath: they go to cut the Epiglottis, so that the sick person may breathe over the place of the wound with some breathing, and may be saved from death: and for this reason they ordered to let the open wound until the evil of illness is finished, and it is its malice in three days, and as itself: then therefore they ordered to sew the wound, and care for it until it heals.
Et illud quod uidi per me ipsum est, quod una ancilla accaepit cultellum, et misit cum in guttur suum, et incidit cum eo partem cannalis pulmonis.	And that which I saw with my own eyes was that one handmaid took a knife and put it into her throat and cut a part of the windpipe with it.
Et uocatus sum ad curationem eius, et inueni eam mugire, sicut est mugitus mortui.	And I was called to treat him, and I found him moaning, as is the moan of a dead man.
Detexi ergo a uulnere, et inueni sanguinem qui egressus fuerat ex uulnere paruum.	I therefore examined the wound, and found blood which had flowed out of the wound a little.
Confisus ergo sum, quod ipsa non absciderat uenam, neque guidegi: et uentus egrediebatur ex uulnere.	Therefore I was troubled that she had not cut off the vein nor guided it, and wind was going out of the wound.
Properaui ergo, et sui uulnus, et curaui ipsum, donec sanum est: et non accidit ancillae aliquid, nisi raucedo in uoce: et rediit post dies ad meliorem dispositionum suarum.	Therefore, I took care of his wound and cared for him until it was healed; and nothing happened to the maidservant except a hoarse voice; and she returned after days to better condition.
Hinc ergo dico: quod in sectione Epiglotis non est timor.	Therefore I say: that in the cutting of the epiglottis there is no fear.
¶ De sectione Herniae gutturis.	On the incision of a hiatal hernia.
Caput XLIIII.	Chapter XLIV.
Hoc Apostema nominatum Hernia gutturis, est apostema magnum, secundum colorem corporis: et est in mulieribus multum.	This abscess called a hernia of the throat is a large abscess, according to the color of the body: and it occurs much in women.
Et est secundum duos modos: aut enim est naturale: aut est accidentale.	And it is according to two modes: either indeed it is natural; or it is accidental.
In naturali certe non est ingenium.	Certainly, it is not natural talent.
Accidentale uero est secundum duos modos: quorum unus est similis nodis pinguibus.	Accidental is according to two modes: one of which is like lumps of fat.
Et modus alter, est similis apostemati quod fit ex nodatione arteriae.	And another way is similar to a boil that arises from the tying of an artery.
Et in ipso est timor, et non oportet ut praesumptio fiat ad ipsum cum ferro, nisi in eo quod est paruum: et tu proba ipsum, et inuestiga ipsum cum Intromisso.	And in this there is fear, and it ought not to be presumed against it with a sword, unless in that which is small; and you prove it, and investigate it with the insertion.
Si ergo inuenis ipsum simile nodo pingui, et non est suspensum cum aliqua uenarum: tunc seca ipsum, sicut secantur nodi: et extrahe ipsum cum eo quod continet ex kisti, si est in kisti: et si non, tunc perscrutare totum eius.	If therefore you find a similar knot, plump and not suspended with any veins: then cut it, as knots are cut: and remove it with what it contains from the cyst, if it is in a cyst: and if not, then examine the whole of it.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod oportet ex curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for the place as much as is necessary until it heals.
¶ De sectione super species Nodorum.	On incision over types of swellings.
Caput XLV.	Chapter XLIV.
Nodorum multae sunt species, et ego iam dixi omnes species eorum in diuisione: et oportet ut narrem hic differentiam inter Nodum, et Exituram: cum sit dubitationem faciens.	There are many kinds of knots, and I have already said all their kinds in the division: and it is necessary that I tell here the difference between a Knot, and an Fistula: when there is doubt-making.
Dico ergo, quod cum Exitura est caliditas, et febris, et dolores uehementes, donec sedatur ebullitio superfluitatis, et completur putrefactio: tunc enim quiescunt febris et calor.	I say therefore, that when the heat, and fever, and violent pains shall be settled until the boiling of superfluity is calmed, and putrefaction is complete: then indeed the fever and heat will rest.
Cum Nodo uero non est caliditas, neque febris, neque dolores, et continet eos kistis sifachin, qui est eis saccus proprius, et est secundum colorem corporis: et est incaeptio eorum sicut cicer, et fit sicut batecha, et maior et minor.	When a node there is no heat, nor fever, nor pain, and it contains them in a bag called sifachin, which is proper to them, and is according to the color of the body: and its beginning is like a lentil, and it becomes like a batecha, and greater and lesser.
Et sunt secundum duas species: aut pingues: aut continent humiditatem.	And they are according to two kinds: either fatty or containing moisture.
Et colores humiditatis sunt multi, secundum quod dixi in diuisione.	And the colors of humidity are many, according to what I said in the division.
Oportet ergo, quando peruenis ad curationem Nodi, ut experiaris eum, et inquiras ipsum in primis cum instrumento quod nominatur Intromissum, secundum quod ueniet forma eius in capitulo quod est post hoc.	Therefore, when you come to the treatment of a Node, you must examine it and inquire about it first with the instrument called Intromissum, according to what its form will be in the chapter that is after this.
Et modus inquisitionis apostematum, et Nodorum omnium est, ut accipias hoc instrumentum, et intromittas ipsum in humidiorem locum, quem inuenis in apostemate: et tu reuolue digitos tuos cum eo paulatim, donec scias quod instrumentum iam penetrauit cutem.	And the manner of investigating abscesses, and all nodules is, that you take this instrument and insert it into the moister place which you find in the abscess: and you revolve your fingers with it gradually until you know that the instrument has already penetrated the skin.
Deinde ultima manum tuam secundum mensuram magnitudinis apostematis.	Then your last hand according to the measure of the size of the abscess.
Deinde extrahe Intromissum, et considera illud quod egrediur in uestigio eius.	Then remove what was introduced and consider what comes out in its trail.
Si ergo egreditur humiditas currens, quicunque color sit: tunc seca ipsum sectione superficiali, secundum quod dixi in reliquis apostematibus.	If therefore a running humidity exits, whatever the color: then dry it with a superficial incision, according to what I said in the rest of abscesses.
Et si non egreditur humiditas in uestigio Intromissi, tunc scias quia est pinguis: seca ergo super ipsum sectione habente formam crucis, secundum formam hanc, sicut docui te: et suspende ipsum cum uncinis, et excoria cutem ab omni parte cum facilitate: et custodi kistin si potes super illud, ut extrahas ipsam sanam cum Nodo.	And if moisture does not issue from the track of introduction, then know that it is fatty: therefore make a dry incision over it in the form of a cross, according to this shape, as I have taught you; and suspend it with hooks, and scrape the skin from every part with ease; and guard the cyst if you can above it, so that you may extract it sound with the Node.
Si autem disrumpitur kistis apud operationem, et non est possibile extrahere ipsam sanam, multotiens enim accidit illud, tunc extrahe ipsam frustatim, donec non remaneat ex ea aliquid.	If, however, the bladder bursts during the operation, and it is not possible to remove it whole, since this often happens, then remove it piece by piece until nothing remains of it.
Nam si remanet ex ea aliquid parum, aut multum, redit Nodus secundum plurimum.	If there remains something little, or much, from it, a Knot returns according to the greatest amount.
Quod si uincit te, et remanet ex eo parum: tunc imple uulnus apud completionem tuam, quibusdam pulueribus corrosiuis acutis: et stringe uulnus, et pone supra ipsum quod sedet apostema calidum, et cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	If it overcomes you, and there remains a little from it, then fill the wound at its completion with some sharp corrosive powders: and tighten the wound, and place above it what sits abscesses hot, and care for it with the rest of the cure until it heals.
Si ergo est Nodus magnus, tunc sue duo labia eius, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat.	If therefore it is a large knot, then cut two lips of it, and care for it with that which becomes flesh.
Si autem est tibi contraria uena pulsatilis, aut non pulsatilis: tunc propera, et imple locum zegi trito, et dimitte ipsum strictum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec putrefiat uulnus, et quiescat ebullitio sanguinis: deinde redi ad incidendum illud quod remansit ex Nodo.	If the vein is against you, pulsating or not pulsating, then hasten, and fill the place with crushed zeige, and release it strict for two days, or three, until the wound putrefies, and the boiling of blood rests: then return to cutting that which remains from the Node.
¶ De foris instrumentorum pro sectione et perforatione.	On instruments for cutting and piercing the mouth.
Caput XLVI.	Chapter XLVI.
EX Eis sunt formae Intromissorum, et sunt trium specierum.	Of these there are forms of instruments introduced, and they are of three kinds.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et ex eis est medium, et ex eis est paruum.	Of these there is a great one, and of these there is a medium one, and of these there is a small one.
Fiant ex ferro alfulud quadratarum extremitatum decenter, ut festinent introitum in apostemate.	Let iron probes of square extremities be made, centered, so that they hasten entry into an abscess.
Et istae sunt formae Experientium, et no, id est, perforantia: et unum eorum nominatur beris, idest, peforans: et sunt trium specierum.	And these are the forms of Experiences, and not, that is to say, piercing: and one of them is named beris, that is, piercing: and they are of three kinds.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et medium, et paruum.	Of these there are great, and medium, and small.
Conueniunt, ut inuestigentur per ea apostemata, et exiturae, et fistulae, et bubones ab eo quod inter ea est ex ossibus.	It is necessary that these abscesses and openings and fistula are investigated through what is between them from the bones.
Et aliis fiunt rotunda, tersa, lenia, sicut acus magnae quibus subsellia suuntur, ex citrino scilicet, aut ex aere, aut ferro, aut argento.	And others are made round, smooth, and blunt, like large needles which they use to stitch the wounds with, from brass, or copper, or iron, or silver.
Et meliora eorum sunt quae fiunt ex citrino.	And the better ones are made from citron.
Et fiunt Experientia etiam de plumbo nigro, quae conueniunt ut per ea experiantur fistulae, quarum concauitate sunt reflexiones, ut reflectantur cum lenitate sua cum illis reflexionibus.	And experience is also made with black lead, which are suitable for testing fistulas, the concavity of which is such that they are reflected with their gentleness when reflected with those reflections.
Et sunt iterum trium specierum.	And there are again three kinds.
Quoniam ex eis sunt longa, ex eis media, et ex eis breuia, secundum quantitatem amplitudinis fistulae et stricturae eius.	Because some are long, some medium, and some short, according to the quantity of the width and constriction of the fistula.
Forma Vncinorum, et sunt multarum specierum.	The shape of hooks, and there are many kinds.
Quoniam ex eis sunt simplices, scilicet quibus est curuitas una: et sunt trium specierum sicut uides, Magni, Medii, et Parui.	Because they are simple, that is, those which have one care; and there are three kinds as you see, Great, Medium, and Small.
Et ex eis sunt Vncini caeci: et sunt trium specierum.	And of these are blind pouches: and they are of three kinds.
Et ex eis sunt uncini habentes duas curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et ex eis sunt uncini habentes tres curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et omnes isti sunt necessarii in loco suo.	And of these there are hooks having two curves, and they are of three kinds: and of these there are hooks having three curves, and they are of three kinds: and all these are necessary in their place.
Et istae sunt formae Scalpellorum, quibus secantur et excoriantur Nodi, et apostemata: et sunt trium specierum: quoniam ex eis est magnum, medium, et paruum.	And these are the forms of scalpels, with which knots and abscesses are cut and scraped; and they are of three kinds: because there is a large one, a medium one, and a small one.
Eorum extremitates quibus fit sectio sunt acutae, extremitates aliae sunt non acutae: et non ponuntur taliter, nisi ut cum eis fiat iuuamentum in excoriatione Nodorum apud timorem incisionis uenae, aut nerui: et ut sanetur per ea infirmus, et inueniat tranquillitatem parumper ex adustione quam inuenit apud excoriationem apostematis.	The extremities that are cut are sharp, and the other extremities are not sharp; and they are not placed like this, except that aid may be given to them in the scraping of nodules out of fear of incision of a vein, or nerve; and that the weak man may heal by them, and find for a short time tranquility from burning as he finds in the scraping of an abscess.
Istae sunt Magda, et sunt specierum trium.	These are called Magda and they are of three kinds.
Fiunt ex aere, et sunt similia Radio, cum quo fit alcohol: et in extremitate lata est puncta Spatumilis occultata: et in ea currit ad interiora, et ad exteriora quando uis, sicut uides.	They are made of metal, and are similar to a still, with which alcohol is made: and at the wide end there is a small point hidden, Spatula; and through it it runs to the interior, and to the exterior when you wish, as you see.
Forma Spatumilium quae absconduntur inter digitos apud perforationem apostematum: et non percipiunt ea infirmi: et sunt trium specierum, magnum, medium, et paruum.	The shape of a wound concealed between the fingers at the site of an abscess perforation; these are not felt by the sick, and there are three kinds, large, medium, and small.
Fomae Ventosarum cum quibus abscinditur fluxus sanguinis: et sunt trium specierum, magnae, mediae, et paruae.	Wounds of the winds with which the flow of blood is severed; and they are of three kinds, large, medium, and small.
Fiant ex aere, aut citrino, rotundae, ad longitudinem parumper, sicut uides: et sint ad subtilitatem.	They are made from copper or citron, round, of slight length, as you see: and let them be fine.
Et oportet ut sint istae species Ventosarum apud te magnae, et paruae: ut abscindas per eas sanguinem cum uelocitate apud necessitatem, et tunc quando non est tibi praesens medicina.	And it is necessary that these kinds of Winds be with you both large and small, so that you may cut off blood with speed when necessary, and then when medicine is not present to you.
Verumtamen non utaris eis in abscisione sanguinis in omni loco corporis, et non utaris nisi in locis carnosis: sicut lacertis cruris, et coxae, et lacertis brachiorum, et mammillarum, et uentris, et inguinum, et similibus eis, ex lacertis carnosis, humidis.	However, do not use them for cutting blood in every part of the body, and do not use them except in fleshy places: such as the groin of the leg, and the hip, and the armpit, and the nipples, and the abdomen, and the inguinal region, and the like, from fleshy, moist incisions.
Et quandoque fiunt ex eis instrumenta parua alia similia corticibus fisticorum, secundum suam formam: quibus abscinditur sanguis quando fluit ex loco phlebotomiae, aut apud incisionem uenae, aut arteriae: et quandoque fiunt ex eis rotundae secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes instruments are made from these similar to the peelings of figs, according to their shape; with which blood is cut when it flows from the site of phlebotomy, or at the incision of a vein, or artery: and sometimes they are made round according to this form.
¶ De cura Mammillarum hominum quae mammillis mulierum assimilantur.	On the care of the breasts of men which are like the breasts of women.
Caput XLVII.	Chapter XLVII.
Quandoque inflantur Mammillae quorundam hominum apud complementum somni (id est, cum incipiunt pollui in somno) donec similantur mammillis mulierum: et remanent apostemosae foede.	Sometimes the breasts of some men become swollen at the time of sleep (that is, when they begin to dream) until they resemble a woman's breasts; and they remain festering with pus.
Qui ergo abhorret illud, oportet ut secet super mammillas sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Deinde excoria pinguedinem totam.	Whoever avoids this, it is necessary that he cut above the nipples with a lunar incision, according to this form from line, b, to line, g. Then scrape away all the fat.
Postea imple uulnus ex medicamine incarnatiuo.	Afterward fill the wound with medicinal ointment.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then bring together the two lips of the wound with a suture, and take care of it until it is healed.
Si autem declinat mammilla ad inferiora, et mollificatur propter magnitudinem suam, sicut accidit mulieribus: tunc oportet ut findatur in duobus lateribus suis superioribus duabus sectionibus similibus figurae lunari, quarum unaquaeque continetur cum altera apud fines utriusque, donec sit linea maior continens minorem, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Postea excoria cutem quae est inter duo labia, et aufer pinguedinem, et administra quod diximus de sutura et pulueribus, quod est necessarium ex curatione, donec sanetur.	If however the nipple inclines to the lower part and softens because of its size, as happens to women: then it is necessary that two incisions similar in figure to a lunary be found on its two upper sides, each one containing the other at the limits of both, until there is a greater line containing the lesser, according to this form from line, b, to line, g. Afterward scrape the skin which is between the two lips and remove the fat, and administer what we have said about sutures and powders, which is necessary for healing, until it heals.
Si autem non comples incisionem eius quod oportet te incidere, propter inquietudinem infirmi, aut propter fluxum sanguinis: tunc oportet ut impleas uulnus coto submerso unguento corrosiuo, et dimitte ipsum, donec corrodat illud quod remansit ex pinguedine.	If, however, you are not able to make the incision as needed because of the patient's distress or because of bleeding, then it is necessary that you fill the wound with a paste submerged in corrosive ointment and let it sit until it corrodes what remains of the flesh.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for him until he heals.
¶ De perforatione apostematis, quod accidit sub Titillico.	On the incision of an abscess that occurs under the nipple.
Caput XLVIII.	Chapter XLVIII.
Ista apostemata quae accidunt sub Titillico, sunt ex speciebus Strophularum dura, quae continet kistis, et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates.	These abscesses that occur under the nipple are of a kind of hard struma, which contains cysts, and from these there are those that contain moisture.
Quae ergo sunt ex eis quae continent humiditates, oportet ut secentur sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam, ex linea b. ad lineam, g. cum ergo euacuatur totum quod est in apostemate ex sanie, tunc imple ipsum coto ueteri, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	What therefore are those which contain humors, it is necessary that they be cut with a lunar section, according to this form, from line b. to line g. For when all that is in the abscess of blood is evacuated, then fill it with old ointment, and dismiss it until the next day.
Deinde auferatur cotum, et curetur cum unguento conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then the clot is removed, and it is treated with a suitable ointment until it heals.
Quod si apostema fuerit ex specie nodorum Strophularum, tunc scinde super ipsum, sicut diximus in sectione super Strophulas aequaliter.	If the abscess is of the kind of Strangles nodules, then cut over it as we have said in the section on Strangles, equally.
Si autem extenditur uulnus in hoc ut emittat pus, tunc administra in eo cauterium, secundum quod diximus in eo quod praemissum est.	If, however, the wound extends in this way that it emits pus, then administer to it a cautery, according to what we said previously.
¶ De sectione apostematis quod accidit propter Arteriam et Venam.	On the incision of an abscess that occurs because of an artery and vein.
Caput XLIX.	Chapter XLIX.
Quando disrumpitur Arteria, et consolidatur cutis quae est supra eam, tuno multotiens accidit inde apostema: et similiter accidit Venae etiam, ut accidat in ea apostema et inflatio.	When an Artery is ruptured and the skin above it is closed, many times abscesses happen from there; and similarly, with Veins, abscesses and swelling happen as well.
Et signa quibus cognoscitur, quod apostema et inflatio sint propter Arteriam et Venam, sunt: quoniam, quando apostema est propter arteriam, est longum, aggregatum in profundo corporis: et quando impellis apostema digits tuis, sentis quasi sit ei stridor.	And the signs by which it is known that an abscess and inflammation are due to the Artery and Vein are: because when an abscess is due to the artery, it is long, gathered deep in the body: and when you press the abscess with your fingers, you feel as if there were a creaking sound.
Et illud quod est propter Venam, est rotundum in manifesto corporis.	And that which is for the vein is round upon the visible body.
Et sectio super hoc apostema est error, et praecipue quod est sub ascellis, et inguinibus, et collo, et in locis multis corporis: et est magnum ualde.	And a section above this abscess is an error, and especially that which is under the armpits, and groin, and neck, and in many places of the body: and it is very great.
Oportet ergo ut deuitetur eius cura cum ferro, et quod ex eis etiam est in extremitatibus, aut in capite, oportet ut deuitetur.	Therefore it is necessary that its care be carried out with iron, and what also from them exists in the extremities, or in the head, it is necessary that it be carried out.
Super illud ergo quod ex eis est ex inflatione orificii Arteriae, finde in cute sectione in longitudine.	Therefore, regarding that which is from them [the wounds] by inflation of the orifice of the Artery, find in skin a cut in length.
Deinde aperi sectionem cum uncinis, postea Arteriam: et libera eam ex tunicis, donec detegatur.	Then open the incision with hooks, afterwards the Artery: and free it from the tunics until it is revealed.
Deinde intromitte sub ea acum, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, et stringe Arteriam cum filo duplo in duobus locis, secundum quod docui te in extractione duarum Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then insert the needle under it and make it penetrate to the other side, and tighten the artery with a double thread in two places, according to what I taught you in extracting the two arteries that are in the temples.
Deinde punge locum, qui est inter duo ligamenta cum spatumili, donec egrediatur sanguis qui est in eo totus, et soluatur apostema.	Then pierce the place which is between two ligaments with a lancet, until all the blood that is in it comes out and the abscess is dissolved.
Deinde administra curationem quae generat pus, donec cadant ligamenta: postea cura illud cum unguentis conuenientibus ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then administer a cure that generates pus until the ligaments fall away; afterward care for it with ointments suitable to it, until it heals.
Quod si fuerit apostema propter sectionem Venae, tunc oportet ut teneas manu tua quod tibi possibile est ex apostemate cum cute.	If it is an abscess due to the incision of a vein, then you must hold with your hand as much as possible from the abscess with skin.
Deinde intromitte acum sub loco quem tenuisti manu tua, et fac eam penetrare: et sit in ea filum duplum, donec extrahas ipsum ex latere altero.	Then introduce a needle under the place which you have held with your hand, and make it penetrate: and let there be in it a thread double, until you draw it out from the other side.
Deinde liga cum ipso apostema ligamento bono: secundum quod dixi tibi in ligamento uuae, a duabus partibus cum duabus extremitatibus fili.	Then tie the ligature with the abscess itself, according to what I told you about the ligation of the vein, from two parts with two extremities of thread.
Si autem times quod extrahatur filum, tunc intromitte acum aliam cum filo alio sub apostemate toto apud incisionem acus: preme, et stringe fila tua in quatuor locis.	If you fear that the extracted thread may be left behind, then introduce another needle with a different thread beneath the whole abscess at the incision; press and tighten your threads in four places.
Deinde seca apostema in medio sui, donec quando egreditur quod in eo est: tunc incide superfluitatem cutis, et dimitte quod ligatum est ex ea.	Then dry out the abscess in its middle, until when it discharges what is in it; then cut away the excess of skin, and release what is bound from it.
Deinde pone super ipsum puluillum quem submersisti in uino, et oleo.	Then put upon it the little bit which you have submerged in wine and oil.
Deinde administra curationem, quae fit cum liciniis et unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then administer treatment with liniments and ointments until it heals.
¶ De apostemate quod accidit ex torsione Neruorum.	On an abscess that happens from a twisting of the nerves.
Caput L.	Head L.
Sicut accidit apostema in Arteria et Vena, similiter accidit apostema in Neruis: quod accidit in eis percussio, aut accidit a labore superfluo, et similibus: et fit plurimum illis in locis adiutoriorum, aut calcanei, et in omni loco in quo mouentur iuncturae: et est apostema graue.	Just as an abscess occurs in arteries and veins, so it also occurs in nerves; which occurs in them from a blow, or from excessive labor, and similar things: and it most often occurs in those places of the helpers, or heel bone, and in every place where joints move: and it is a serious abscess.
Similatur color eius reliquo corpori, et est in pluribus dispositionibus absque dolore: et quando stringitur cum uehementia, sentit in eo infirmus simile stupori.	Its color is similar to the rest of the body, and it is found in many arrangements without pain: and when it is squeezed with vehemence, it feels in it weak like a stupor.
Et non est apostema aggregatum in profundo corporis, imo est sub cute, et ipsum mouetur ad omnem partem, et non uadit ad anteriora, uel ante, neque retro ad posteriora.	And it is not an abscess gathered deep within the body, rather it is under the skin, and it moves to every part, and it does not go forward or ahead, nor backward to the back parts.
Quod ergo ex eis est in iuncturis, non oportet ut inuadatur cum ferro.	Therefore, what is found of these things in joints, it ought not to be invaded with iron.
Fortasse enim accidet contractio.	For perhaps contraction will happen.
In illo autem quod ex eis est in capite, aut in fronte, finde cutem cum spatumili.	In that which is in the head, or on the forehead, cut the skin with a sharp instrument.
Si ergo est apostema paruum, tunc tene ipsum cum forficibus, et abscinde ipsum a radice.	If therefore is a small abscess, then hold it with forceps and cut it from the root.
Et si est magnum, tunc suspende ipsum eum uncino, et excoria ipsum: deinde aufer ipsum, et aggrega uulnus cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if it is large, then suspend it with a hook, and scrape it; then remove it, and gather the wound together with suture: and take care of it until it heals.
¶ De sectione apostematis, quod accidit in uentre.	On the incision of an abscess that occurs in the abdomen.
Caput LI.	Chapter LI.
Accidunt quibusdam hominibus multotiens in uentribus eorum, et in reliquis corporibus ipsorum, thelil, quae nominantur Fungalia, per similitudinem ipsorum cum fungis.	Sometimes certain people get growths in their bellies and other parts of their bodies, which are called Fungalia, because of their similarity to mushrooms.
Quorum radix est subtilis, et ipsorum caput est grossum, et conuersa sunt labia eorum.	Whose root is subtle, and their head is coarse, and their lips are reversed.
Et est ex eis paruum: et est ex eis quod magnificatur ualde.	And there are some of them which are small: and there are some of them which are greatly magnified.
Et ego quidem iam uidi uirum, et in uentre eius erant duo thelil, quae erant magis quam rebus aliis similia fungis: non erat differentia inter ea, alba, minutae radicis, et inuersabantur labia eorum, et findebantur, et humiditas currebat ex eis semper.	And I myself have seen a man, and in his belly there were two growths, which were more like fungi than other things: there was no difference between them, white, small roots, and their lips were reversed, and they were found, and humidity flowed from them always.
Incidi ergo ea, et inueni in pondere unius quasi X et VIII uncia et in altero quasi VI uncia Et operatio in incisione eorum est, ut consideres tunc, si infirmus est humidus, et color thelil est albus, humidum, subtilis radicis: tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili lato, et sint in praesentia tua cauteria in igne.	Therefore, I cut them, and I found in one about X and VIII ounces and in the other about VI ounces. And the operation in the incision of them is, that you consider then, if the patient is humid, and the color is white, moist, fine root: then cut it with a wide spatula, and let there be cauteries in fire present to you.
Multotiens enim expellitur apud sectionem eius sanguis multus: propera ergo si te uincit sanguis, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	For often much blood is expelled during its section: therefore if you are overcome by blood, then cauterize it.
Quod si uides infirmum pauidum et timidum ab incisione cum ferro, tunc accipe filum ex plumbo decenter factum, et stringe cum eo athelul: cuius modus est quem diximus, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	If you see someone weak and fearful of the incision with iron, then take a leaden thread properly made, and bind it with it to the athulus: whose manner is what we have said, and release him for two days.
Deinde adde in strictura plumbi.	Then add lead to the constriction.
Non ergo cesses stringere plumbum, quotiens imprimit in thelil, donec abscindatur, et cadat per se absque labore.	Therefore, do not cease to tighten the lead until it is imprinted in the lil, until it is severed and falls by itself without labor.
Si autem thelil grossae fuerit radicis, tunc in incisione eius est quiddam timoris et pauoris: praecipue quod est in uentre.	If however the root is thick, then there is some fear and anxiety in its incision, especially since it is in the belly.
Verumtamen possibile est, ut incidas medietatem eius.	Nevertheless it is possible, that you cut in half of it.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum, ut non redeat.	Then cauterize it so that it does not return.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then take care of the wound until it is healed.
Et caue ne praesumas incidere thelil quod est fusci coloris, pauci sensus, foedi aspectus: ipsum enim est apostema cancerosum: et ego ueniam cum rememoratione Cancri post hoc.	And be careful not to cut into that which is dark in color, with few senses, and foul appearance; for it is a cancerous abscess: and I shall come back with a remembrance of Cancer after this.
¶ De cura eminentiae Vmbilici.	On the treatment of umbilical prolapse.
Caput LII.	Chapter LII.
Fit eminentia Vmbilici ex caussis multis.	A prominence of the navel occurs from many causes.
Aut ex fissuris sifac, quod super uentrem est: et exit ex eo althub, aut intestinum, secundum quod accidit in reliquis rupturis.	Or from fissures which are above the belly: and it exits from this either the large intestine, or the small intestine, according to what happens in other ruptures.
Aut ex sanguine qui fluit ex Vena, aut ex Arteria, secundum quod praemissum est.	Either from blood flowing from a Vein, or from an Artery, according to what has been said before.
Aut ex uentositate coartata in eo.	Or compressed by a tight bandage.
Si autem est propter fissuram sifac, et exitum thirbi: tunc est color apostematis similis colori corporis: et est lene, absque dolore: et apparet diuersi situs.	If it is due to a fissure and the discharge of pus: then the color of the abscess is similar to the color of the body: and it is soft, without pain: and it appears in various locations.
Et si est propter egressionem intestini, tunc est situs eius, cum eo quod narrauimus, uehementioris diuersitatis.	And if it is due to the extrusion of the intestine, then its location is, with that which we have narrated, of greater diversity.
Cum ergo tu premis ipsum digitis tuis, occultatur: deinde redit, et fortasse est cum eo sonitus: et magnificatur multum apud introitum balnei, et laborem uehaementum.	When therefore you press it with your fingers, it disappears; then it returns, and perhaps there is a sound with it; and it becomes much magnified at the entrance of the bath, and causes labor.
Si uero est propter humiditatem, est lene, tunc non occultatur quando premis ipsum manu tua, neque constringium, neque additur.	If it is due to moisture, it is soft, then it is not concealed when you press it with your hand, nor is there constriction, nor addition.
Quod si est propter sanguinem, tunc cum istis signis apparet apostema ad nigredinem de cliue.	If it is due to blood, then with these signs the abscess appears black on the skin.
Si autem est propter carnem natam: tunc est apostema graue, grossum, durum, et figitur secundum quantitatem unam.	If it is due to flesh born: then it is a serious, large, hard abscess, and it sets according to the quantity of one.
Si uero est propter uentositatem, tunc tactus eius est lenis.	If it is because of windiness, then its touch is gentle.
Et operatio in illo est, ut consideres tunc, si eminentia umbilici est propter sanguinem Arteriae, aut Venae, aut uentositatem: tunc oportet ut prohibearis a curatione eius.	And the operation on that one is, when you consider if the prominence of the navel is due to blood from the Artery or Vein, or windiness; then it is necessary for you to prohibit its cure.
Nam in illo est timor et pauor, sicut docui te in capitulo, in quo dixi apostemata propter arteriam et uenam.	For in that there is fear and trembling, as I have taught you in the chapter, in which I said abscesses because of the artery and vein.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est propter intestinum, aut zirbum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, quatenus teneat anhelitum suum, et stet stans extensus.	If the prominence of the umbilicus is due to the intestine or a tumor, then you ought to instruct the sick person to hold his breath and stand upright extended.
Deinde signa cum encaustro in circumitu umbilici totius.	Then signs with a plaster around the whole umbilicus.
Postea praecipe ei, ut resupinetur inter manus tuas super dorsum suum.	Then command him to lie on his back between your hands.
Deinde circunda cum spatumili lato in circumitu umbilici super locum quem signasti cum encaustro.	Then with a spatula wide around the umbilicus on the place which you marked with encrusting.
Postea extende medium apostematis ad superiora, cum uncino magno.	Afterwards extend the middle of the abscess to the upper part, with a large hook.
Deinde liga eum in circumitu forti cum filo, aut cum chorda de serico ligamento firmo: et sit nodus ligamenti alenxotati.	Then bind him around with strong thread, or with a silk cord, firm binding: and let the knot of the ligament be secure.
Deinde aperi medium apostematis extensum supra ligamentum.	Then open the middle of the abscess extended above the ligament.
Si ergo inueneris ipsum iam captum a ligamento: tunc extrahe alenxotati, et intromitte in ipsum digitum indicem, et impelle intestinum ad interiora uentris: et si inueneris zirbum, tunc accipe ipsum cum uncino, et incide superfluitatem eius.	If therefore you find it already captured by the ligament: then extract the alien body and introduce your index finger into it, and drive the intestine to the interior of the belly: and if you find a tumor, then take it with a hook, and cut away its superfluity.
Si autem contraria est tibi arteria, aut uena: tunc circunda ipsum multum.	If, however, the artery or vein is opposite you, then wind around it much.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam.	Then return to your operation.
Et accipe duas acus, et intromitte in eis duo fila fortia: et intromitte duas acus in circumitu quem fecisti circa apostema in modum crucis, quas facis penetrare.	Take two needles, and insert into them two strong threads: and insert two needles into the circle that you made around the abscess in the form of a cross, so that they penetrate.
Deinde stringe apostema in quatuor locis super acus: et si uis, aufer acus, et dimitte locum, donec putrefiat caro extensa: et cadat per se: aut incide ipsam quando subtiliatur et putrefit.	Then bind the abscess in four places over the needle: and if you wish, remove the needle, and let go of the place, until the extended flesh rots: and it falls by itself: or cut into it when it becomes subtle and rots.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with what is necessary from ointment until it heals.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est ex carne nara in eo, aut ex humiditate: tunc oportet ut concaues apostema, sicut diximus.	If a protrusion of the navel is from flesh or moisture then it is necessary to concave the abscess as we have said.
Et extrahas sanguinem, aut humiditatem, quam inuenis in eo.	And you will draw out blood, or moisture, which you find in it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod solidat locum.	Then care for it with that which solidifies the place.
¶ De cura CANCRI.	On the treatment of cancer.
Caput LIII.	Chapter fifty-three.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Cancri, et qualiter est uia ad curationem eius cum medicinis: et cauendum ab eo cum curatione eius cum ferro, ut non ulceretur: et diximus Cancrum generatum in matrice, et cautelam a curatione eius.	We have said in the division of the types of cancer, and how is the way to cure it with medicines: and beware of it when curing it with iron, so that it does not ulcerate: and we have said about cancer generated in the womb, and caution in its treatment.
Et dixerunt antiqui, quod quandoque Cancer est in loco, ubi possibilis est eius eradicatio: sicut Cancer qui est in mammillis, aut in coxa, et eis similibus, ex membris locatis ad extrahendum totum eius: praecipue quando est incipiens paruus.	And the ancients said that sometimes cancer is in a place where it is possible to eradicate it, such as cancer that is in the breast or in the hip, and similar places, from limbs located to remove the whole of it, especially when it is beginning small.
Quando uero antiquatur, et est magnus, non oportet ut appropinques ei.	When however it is old and large, it ought not to be approached.
Ego enim non potui sanare ex eo aliquem: neque uidi alium ante me qui peruenerit ad illud.	For I was not able to heal anyone from it; nor did I see another before me who had come to that.
Et operatio in eo, quando est locatus sicut diximus, est, ut praecedas, et soluas infirmum ex cholera nigra aliquotiens.	And the operation on it, when it is located as we said, is, as before, and to purge the sick person from black bile several times.
Deinde phlebotoma ipsum si inuenis cum repletione manifesta.	Then if you find the lancet with a manifest filling.
Deinde praepara infirmum praeparatione, in qua locetur cum operatione.	Then prepare the weak with preparation, in which it will be spoken with the operation.
Deinde proiice in Cancrum uncinos qui conueniunt ei.	Then project into the cancer hooks that are suitable for it.
Postea concaua ipsum ab omni parte cum cute, secundum perscrutationem, donec non remaneat aliquid ex radicibus eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere, et non abscindas ipsum uelociter, imo exprime loca, et absterge sanguinem grossum totum manu tua, aut cum quo possibile est ibi ex instrumentis.	Afterwards hollow it out from every part with the skin, according to examination, until nothing remains of its roots: and let blood flow, and do not cut it quickly, moreover express the places, and wipe away the gross blood all with your hand, or with whatever instrument is possible there.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi fluxus sanguinis grossi ex incisione arteriae, aut uenae: tunc cauteriza uenam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If, however, a thick flow of blood occurs from the incision of an artery or vein: then cauterize the vein until the blood is cut off.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
¶ De cura Hydropisis.	On the treatment of dropsy.
Caput LIIII.	Chapter LIII.
Iam narrauimus in diuisione species Hydropisis, et qualiter fit aggregatio aquae: et signa omnis speciei, et curationem eius cum medicinis.	Now we recount in the division of kinds of dropsy, and how the gathering of water is made: and the signs of every kind, and its cure with medicines.
Et illa quae curatur cum ferro, non est nisi species asclitis sola: et non approximatur cum ferro speciei timpanitis: neque speciei hyposarcae penitus: nam illud mortale est.	And that which is cured with iron is only a kind of ascites alone; and it does not approach with iron the species of tympanitis; nor the species of hydrops entirely; for that is mortal.
Quando tu iam medicatus es hanc speciem Hydropisis timpanitis cum medicinis, et non contulit medicatio tua: tunc considera.	When you have already treated this kind of hydrops tympanitis with medicines, and your treatment did not help, then consider.
Nam si infirmo iam consecuta est debilitas, aut est cum eo infirmitas alia praeter Hydropisim: sicut si sit cum eo tussis, aut uentris solutio, et similia illis: tunc caue ne mediceris ei cum ferro: quoniam est timor illud.	If weakness has already come upon the sick person, or if there is another illness besides dropsy: such as if he has a cough, or a flux of the belly, and the like: then beware that you do not treat him with iron: for there is fear of this.
Si autem uides infirmum exuberantis uirtutis, neque est cum eo aegritudo praeter Hydropisim solam: et non est puer, neque senex: tunc modus operationis in eo est, ut tu eleues infirmum stantem inter manus tuas, et minister post ipsum exprimat uentrem eius manu sua impellendo aquam ad inferiorem partem pectinis.	If you see a patient with excessive vigor and there is no illness except for dropsy alone: and he is not a child, nor an old man; then the mode of operation in him is that you elevate the patient standing between your hands, and let your assistant press his belly with his hand, driving the water to the lower part of the breastbone.
Deinde accipe spatumile spinosum, secundum hanc formam.	Then take a spathe prickly, according to this form.
Sit duarum partium acutarum, longum, acutae extremitatis sicut Spatumile.	Let it be two parts acute, long, and the acute end like a spatula.
Verumtamen in eo sit quiddam breuitatis paulatim, ut non pertranseas cum eo apud operationem usque ad intestinum, et laedas ipsum.	Nevertheless, there should be something of brevity gradually, so that you do not pass through it with it at the time of the operation to the intestine, and wound it.
Deinde considera.	Then consider.
Nam si est generatio Hydropisis ex parte intestinorum, tunc oportet ut elongeris cum sectione ab umbilico quantitate trium digitorum, ad inferiora in directo eius supra pectinem.	If the formation of dropsy is from a part of the intestines, then it is necessary to lengthen with a cut from the navel three finger widths, down to the direct below the breastbone.
Si uero generatio Hydropisis est propter aegritudinem epatis: tunc sit sectio tua sinistra ab umbilico tribus digitis.	If however the generation of hydropy is because of the sickness of the liver, then let your section be on your left from the navel three fingers.
Et si generatio eius est propter splenem, tunc sit sectio in latere dextro: et non oportet etiam ut sit sectio in latere super quod uult iacere infirmus, ut non currant superfluitates ad illum locum debilem.	And if its formation is due to the spleen, then a section should be made on the right side: and it ought not also to be a section on the side where the sick person wants to lie, so that superfluities do not flow to that weak place.
Deinde perfora cum instrumento cutem totam.	Then pierce the whole skin with an instrument.
Deinde intromitte in illam sectionem, et eleua manum tuam cum Spatumili inter cutem, et sifac, quasi tu excories ipsum: et sit quantitas quae excoriatur quantitas unguis, aut circiter ilud.	Then introduce into that incision and raise your hand with the Spatula between the skin and flesh, and scrape it as if you were scraping it: and let the quantity which is scraped be the quantity of a fingernail, or about that.
Deinde perfora sifac, donec perueniat Spatumile ad locum uacuum: et est locus aquae.	Then pierce the abscess until the spatula comes to the place of emptiness: and that is the place of water.
Deinde extrahe ipsum, et intromitte in foramen instrumentum, cuius haec est forma.	Then draw it out, and introduce into the opening an instrument which has this form.
Et est simile cannulae: fit ex argento, aut aere, aut aurichalco, lene, tersum: cui in inferiori parte sui est foramen paruum, et in lateribus eius sunt tria foramina, duo ab una parte, et unum a parte altera: et facia est extremitas eius incisa, secundum modum incisionis calami, sicut uides: in extremitate eius superiore est armilla.	And it is similar to a cannula: it is made of silver, or copper, or brass, soft, smooth: which has a small hole in its lower part, and on its sides are three holes, two from one side, and one from the other side: and its end is cut, according to the manner of cutting a reed, as you see: at the upper end of it there is a ring.
Nam quando instrumentum peruenit ad aquam, tunc ipsa descendit statim super instrumentum, ergo euacua ex aqua in hora quantitatem mediam.	For when an instrument comes to water, then itself immediately descends upon the instrument, therefore it evacuates out of water in an hour a medium quantity.
Quoniam si tu euacuas ex ea plus quam oportet, in hora fortasse moritur infirmus per resolutionem spiritus sui animalis: aut accidit ei syncopis quae appropinquat morti.	For if you evacuate from it more than is necessary, perhaps the sick person will die in an hour through resolution of his animal spirit; or he will fall into a fainting spell that approaches death.
Verum euacua ex ea secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius, et secundum quod significant tibi dispositiones infirmi ex uirtute pulsus eius, et ex bonitate eius.	But evacuate from it according to the quantity of its virtue, and according to what the dispositions of the sick man signify to you from the virtue of his pulse, and from its goodness.
Deinde extrahe instrumentum, et retine aquam.	Then remove the instrument, and hold the water.
Quod est, quia retinetur statim propter cutem quae retinet foramen quod est super sifac: de quo narraui, ut perfores ipsum secundum illum modum.	This is because it is held back immediately because of the skin which retains the opening which is above the sifac: of which I have told you, as to pierce it according to that mode.
Deinde itera instrumentum die altero, si uides infirmum tolerare illud: et extrahe etiam ex aqua quantitatem paruam.	Then on the next day repeat the instrument if you see the patient can tolerate it; and also remove a small quantity from the water.
Fac illud diebus aliquot sine timore, et custodi te ab errore: donec non remaneat ex aqua nisi parum.	Do this for several days without fear, and guard yourself from error until there remains only a little water.
Si autem times super infirmum, et dimittis ex aqua rem multam: tunc cura ipsum cum sepultura in harena calida, et sudore multo in balneo et sole, et expectet super sitim: et cura ipsum cum medicinis exiccatiuis, donec sanetur: et cauteriza super stomachum, et epar, et splenem, post extractionem aquae: secundum quod narraui in eo quod praecessit.	If however you treat the weak one, and let much water out of him, then care for him with burial in hot sand, and with much sweat in a bath and sun, and let him wait on thirst. And care for him with drying medicines, until he is healed: and cauterize over the stomach, and liver, and spleen, after the extraction of water: according to what I have narrated in what precedes.
¶ De cura infantium qui nascuntur locis urinae eorum non perforatis.	On the care of infants who are born with their urinary openings not perforated.
Caput LV.	Chapter LVII.
Quando egreditur aliquis infantium ex uentre matris suae, et caput mutonis eius est non perforatum, aut est foramen strictum, aut in non suo loco.	When someone is born from the womb of his mother, and the head of his infant is not perforated, or it has a narrow opening, or it is not in its proper place.
Oportet ergo succurrere cum perforatione eius statim cum nascitur cum Spatumili subtili ualde, secundum hanc formam.	Therefore it is necessary to assist with its perforation immediately when it is born with a Spatula carefully and delicately, according to this form.
Deinde pone in foramine clauum subtilem ex plumbo, et liga ipsum: et tene ipsum tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then put a thin lead peg into the hole, and bind it: and hold it for three or four days.
Quando ergo uult urinam emittere, remoueatur, et mingat.	When therefore he wishes to pass urine, let him remove it, and urinate.
Deinde reduc ipsum.	Then reduce it.
Et si tu non ponis plumbum, iam possibile est, ut urina quae incedit super locum, non permittat ipsum claudi.	And if you do not place lead, it is now possible that the urine which flows over the place, will not allow it to close.
Ille autem cuius foramen est strictum, medicatur cum plumbo, sicut diximus, diebus multis, donec amplificetur.	He whose opening is narrow is treated with lead, as we have said, for many days until it is enlarged.
Illi autem in quibus est foramen in non suo loco, laeduntur.	Those who have a hole in a place not their own are harmed.
Quod est, quia ex eis qui nascitur, foramen est apud finem capitis uirgae: quare non potest mingere ad anteriora, donec eleuat uirgam manu sua ad superiora.	That is because from those who are born, there is an opening at the end of the penis: therefore it cannot urinate forward until he raises the penis with his hand upwards.
Neque est ei generatio, propterea, quod sperma non potest peruenire ad matricem secundum rectitudinem: et est aegritudo foeda ualde.	Therefore, there is no generation because the semen cannot reach the womb in a straight line; and it is a very foul ailment.
Et modus operationis in illo est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum.	And the way of operating on him is that he be laid upon his back.
Deinde extende caput uirgae eius manu tua sinistra extensione uehementi, et incide caput capitis uirgae ex loco priapi, cum acumine, aut spatumili acuto: sicut est incisio calami, aut sicut tu radis aliquid, ut medium eius ueniat simile capiti uirgae: et ut cadat foramen in medio secundum quod oportet.	Then extend the head of the twig with your left hand forcefully, and cut the head of the twig from the place of the phallus, with a sharp point, or with a sharp spatula: just as is the incision of a reed, or as you would cut something with a knife, so that its middle comes out like the head of the twig: and so that it falls in the middle according to what is necessary.
Et caue tibi apud operationem tuam a fluxu sanguinis.	And beware during your operation of bleeding.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	Many times indeed it happens.
Oppone ergo ei cum eo quod abscindit sanguinem, et cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Therefore oppose him with that which stops the blood, and care for the wound until it heals.
¶ De Albather quae accidunt in praeputio et capite uigae, et corruptione, nigredine, et adhaerentia.	On Al-Butus which occur in the foreskin and head of the penis, and corruption, blackness, and adherence.
Caput LVI.	Chapter LVI.
Multotiens accidunt istae Albather in uirga, et est eminentia carnis foedae.	These things often happen to Albucasis in a staff, and it is a prominence of foul flesh.
Et ex ea alia est maligna, et alia non maligna.	And from that some are malignant, and some are not malignant.
Non malignam ergo oportet ut suspendas cum uncino subtili, et abscindas eam, donec mundes eam totam.	Therefore, you ought not to suspend a non-malignant growth with a fine hook and cut it away until you have completely removed it.
Deinde pone super eam cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio.	Then place upon it a cloth immersed in Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud cum unguento dyafinicon, donec sanetur.	Then care for it afterward with dyacin ointment until it heals.
Quod si Albather est maligna, foedi coloris, tunc oportet ut administres in ea cauterium post incisionem eius et ipsius rasionem.	If Albather is malignant, of foul color, then you must administer cautery to it after its incision and the burning away of its root.
Si autem Albather est in praeputio captiui, non circumcisi, et est pars Albather inter praeputium, et pars eius extra: tunc oportet ut auferas Albather, quae est intus in primis, donec quando consolidatur, tunc cura ipsum exterius: quoniam quando tu curas eam simul, non securatur praeputium quin preforetur.	If, however, the glans is caught in the foreskin of an uncircumcised patient, and part of the glans is within the foreskin and part outside: then you must first remove the glans that is inside, until it has healed, then care for the external part; because when you treat both at the same time, the foreskin does not heal but is perforated.
Et iam accidunt etiam in testiculis, et praeputio nigredo et corruptio.	And now also happen in the testicles and foreskin blackening and corruption.
Oportet ergo, ut tu concaues totum quod iam denigratum est, et quod uult corrumpi, aut iam corruptum est.	Therefore it is necessary for you to hollow out everything that has been blackened and which wants to rot or which is already rotten.
Deinde line super ipsum post illud cum melle quod iam concussum est cum farina corticum granatorum, et herbi tritorum cribellatorum.	Then a line over it after that with honey which has already been mixed with flour and the rind of pomegranates, and crushed herb of cress.
Deinde cura illud cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra cauterium cum cauterio lunari, secundum hanc formam.	If there happens to be a flow of blood, then administer cautery with a lunar cautery, according to this form.
Cauterium enim est iuuatiuum ad duas dispositiones simul, scilicet ad fluxum sanguinis, et uulnus quando corrumpitur.	For cauterization is helpful for two dispositions at once, namely for the flow of blood and for a wound when it is corrupted.
Quod si corroditur caput uirgae, et destruitur totum in hora: tunc oportet ut intromittas in meatum priapi cannulam ex plumbo, ut mingat infirmus super eam.	If the head of the staff is eroded and destroyed completely in an hour, then it is necessary to insert into the urethra a lead pipe so that the patient may urinate on top of it.
In adhaerentia uero praeputii cum capite uirgae, et haec quidem adhaerentia non accidit, nisi in eo cuius praeputium est sanum, et non exigitur super ipsum circumcisio: et quandoque accidit adhaerentia propter uulnus, aut apostema: oportet ergo ut excories eam cum Spatumili obtuso, donec soluatur ligamentum, et liberetur caput uirgae ab omni parte.	In the adhesion of the foreskin to the head of the penis, and this adhesion does not occur unless in one whose foreskin is healthy, and circumcision is not required on it: and sometimes adhesion occurs because of a wound, or an abscess: therefore it is necessary to scrape it with a blunt Spatula until the ligament is loosened, and the head of the penis is freed from every part.
Quod si est difficile discernere ea exquisite, tunc oportet ut excories aliquid ex capite uirgae, et ex praeputio.	If it is difficult to distinguish these fine things, then one must excise something from the head of the penis and from the foreskin.
Quod est, quia praeputium quando est subtile, fortasse perforatur propter subtilitatem suam uelociter.	That is because when the prepuce is thin, perhaps it will be perforated because of its thinness quickly.
Deinde separa inter praeputium, et caput uirgae cum panno lini subtili, qui iam madefactus est in aqua frigida, ut non adhereant iterum.	Then separate between the foreskin and the head of the penis with a fine linen cloth which has already been moistened in cold water so that they do not stick again.
Deinde curetur cum uino stiptico, donec consolidetur.	Then it is treated with a wine compress until it solidifies.
¶ De mundificatione infantium, et curatione ex errore eis accidente.	On the purification of infants and the treatment of illnesses that befall them through error.
Caput LVII.	Chapter LVII.
Circumcisio non est solutio continuitatis, sicut reliqua uulnera: uerumtamen cum sit ex operatione nostra, uoluntate nostra, et usus eius sit in pueris proprie, est necesse ut signemus in ea operationem meliorem, et uiam leuiorem perducentem ad salutem.	Circumcision is not a solution of continuity, like other wounds: however, since it is performed by our operation, by our will, and its use is proper to boys, it is necessary that we mark in it a better operation, and a smoother way leading to salvation.
Dico ergo, quod antiqui non dixerunt circumcisionem in aliquo suorum librorum: quoniam non utuntur in legibus suis, et non est nisi quod acquisiuimus per experimentum.	Therefore I say, that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books; because they do not use it in their laws, and it is only what we have acquired by experience.
Quod est, quia ego inueni maiorem partem artificum, et phlebotomatorum uti mundificatione, circumcidendo cum nouacula, et cum forficibus: et utuntur alfecati, et ligaudo cum filo, et incisione cum ungula.	That is because I found that most artisans and bloodletters use purification, cutting with a scalpel and forceps: and they use pliers and tie with thread, and incision with a nail.
Et ego quidem iam probaui omnes istos modos, et non inueni meliorem mundificatione cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo.	And I myself have proven all these methods, and I have not found a better one than cleansing with forceps and binding with thread.
Quoniam in mundificatione cum nouacula, multotiens effugit cutis.	For when skin is scraped with a knife during cleansing, often it escapes.
Quoniam cutis praeputii duas habet tunicas: ergo forsitan inciditur cutis superior, et temanet tunica inferior: cogitur ergo ad incisionem ad incidendum alteram, et dolorem futurum.	Because the skin of the prepuce has two layers: therefore, perhaps the upper skin is cut and the lower tunic remains: therefore it is necessary to make an incision to cut the other, and the future pain.
Et cum mundificatione quae fit per alfecati, id est, digitalis, quo utuntur sutores, non securatur incisio extremitatis uirilis membri: quoniam fortasse ingreditur in foramen eius.	And when cleansing is done with the alfacat, that is to say, a finger, which surgeons use, the incision of the extremity of the male member is not made secure because perhaps it enters its foramen.
In mundificatione autem cum ungula, fortasse euadit ferrum, et corrumpit operationem tuam: et cutis quidem pueri est breuis natura, et multotiens nascuntur taliter, quod non indigent mundificatione: et iam uidi illud.	In purification, however, if the nail comes out, perhaps it will damage your operation; and indeed the skin of a boy is brief in nature, and many times they are born thus, that they do not need purification; and I have already seen this.
Mundificationis autem cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo, bonum experimentum detexit mihi: quoniam forfices sunt proportionalis incisionis: propterea, quod acuitas quae est superius, est sicut acuitas quae est inferius.	I discovered a good method of purification with forceps and a ligature made of thread, because the forceps are proportionate to the incision; because the sharpness which is above is like the sharpness which is below.
Cum ergo premis manum tuam, proportionantur duae acuitates, et incidunt secundum operationem unam in tempore uno: et fit compressio simili figura, continens cutem uirgae ab omni parte, cum qua non cadit error omnino.	When therefore you press your hand, the two sharpnesses are proportioned, and they cut according to the operation one at a time; and a compression is made with a similar figure, containing the skin of the twig from every part, so that no error falls at all.
Et modus operationis propriae est, ut facias extimare, puerum praecipue, si est ex eis qui intelligunt parumper, quod tu non facis, nisi quod ligas filum in uirga sua tantum: et dimittas ipsum usque ad diem alium.	And the way of operating on it is, that you make a child, especially one who understands briefly, think that you do nothing but tie a thread to his stick; and dismiss him until the next day.
Deinde fac eum gaudere et laetari omnimodo quo possibile est tibi illud, ex eo quod recipit intelligentia sua.	Then make him rejoice and be glad in every way that is possible for you from that which he receives through his understanding.
Deinde fac eum stare inter manus tuas praeparatae staturae, et non sit sedens: et occulta forfices in manica tua, aut sub pede tuo, ne uideat eos puer omnino, neque aliquid ex instrumentis.	Then make him stand between your hands, prepared posture, and not sitting: and conceal the forceps in your sleeve, or under your foot, that the boy may see them at all, nor anything of the instruments.
Deinde intromitte manum tuam ad uirgam eius, et suffla in cutem, et trahe eam sursum, donec egrediatur caput uirgae.	Then introduce your hand into its stick, and puff into the skin, and draw it upward until the head of the stick emerges.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex eo quod aggregatur in ea sordicie.	Then cleanse it of what is gathered in it, from filth.
Deinde liga locum signatum cum filo duplo.	Then tie the marked place with a doubled thread.
Postea liga inferius eo parumper ligamentum secundum.	Then bind the lower part with a small bandage following after.
Deinde tene cum indice tuo, et pollice locum ligamenti inferioris retentione bona, et incide inter duo ligamenta.	Then hold with your index finger and thumb the place of the lower ligament well, and cut between the two ligaments.
Deinde eleua cutem sursum uelociter, et extrahe caput uirgae.	Then lift the skin upward quickly, and extract the head of the splinter.
Deinde dimitte sanguinem currere paulatim (est enim melius) et pone puluerem desuper: et super puluerem pannum in quo expansus est uitellus oui decocti in aqua rosata, concussum cum oleo ros.	Then let the blood flow gradually (for it is better), and put powder on top; and above the powder, a cloth in which a vitellus boiled in rose water has been soaked, mixed with rose oil.
Recenti bono: et dimitte eum super ipsum usque ad diem alium: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Recently well: and let him rest upon it until another day: and take care of him with the rest of the care, until he is healed.
Forma autem forficis ad mundificationem haec est.	The form of the forceps for cleansing is this.
Sint hebetes duae extremitates, et sint incidentes: ne egrediatur in eis ramus claui: et sit longitudo duarum acuitatum, sicut longitudo duorum manubriorum aequaliter.	Let the two extremities be blunt, and let them meet: let no branch of the bone emerge from them; and let the length of the two points be equal to the length of the two handles.
Error uero cadens in mundificatione est: quoniam fortasse effugit cutis intrinseca tota, aut pars eius apud incisionem.	The error occurring during cleansing is this: for perhaps the whole skin has escaped internally, or a part of it at the incision.
Ergo oportet, ut extendas eam ex hora tua cum ungue tuo ante apostemationem loci: et incidas eam secundum aequalitatem.	Therefore it is necessary that you extend it from your hour with your finger before suppuration of the place: and cut it according to equality.
Quod si non potes tenere eam cum ungue tuo, tunc extrahe eam cum uncino, et incide eam.	If you cannot hold it with your fingernail, then remove it with a hook and cut it.
Si autem praeterierint ei tres dies, et remanet quod est sub uirga inflatum, apostematum: tunc dimitte illud, donec sedetur apostema calidum, et excoria illud cum facilitate, et incide illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi: et caue tibi a capite uirgae.	If three days have passed and the swelling under the rod remains, it is an abscess: then release it until the abscess sits hot, and scrape it with ease, and cut into it according to what is prepared for you, and beware of the head of the rod.
Non enim nocebit ei illud.	It will not harm him.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod consolidat uulnus ex pulueribus, quos narrauimus in tractatu de pulueribus: et si inciditur ex cute supra mensuram, et euadit ad superiora, non nocet ei illud etiam.	Therefore treat it with that which consolidates a wound from powders, which we have narrated in the treatise on powders: and if it happens to be cut above measure, and escapes to the upper regions, it does not harm it even then.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod diximus, donec sanetur.	Therefore, treat it with what we said until it heals.
¶ De extractione Vrinae retentae in uesica.	On the extraction of urine retained in the bladder.
Caput LVIII.	Chapter LVIII.
Urinae retentio in uesica, fit ab opilatione facta ex lapide, aut sanguine congelato, aut pus, aut carne nata, et similibus illis ex eis quae diximus ex modis curationis in diuisione.	Retention of urine in the bladder occurs from an obstruction caused by a stone, or frozen blood, or pus, or flesh born, and similar to those we have said about the modes of healing in the division.
Et si non soluitur Vrina, et uides retentionem eius esse propter Lapidem, qui iam est in collo uesicae: tunc oportet ut sit infirmus super genua sua curuatus.	And if it is not released urine, and you see that its retention is because of a stone which is already in the neck of the bladder; then it is necessary that he be lying on his knees.
Deinde componantur pedes eius super dorsum eius, et extendat uentrem suum ex superiori parte dorsi eius, et stringat infirmus anhelitum suum quantum possibile est ei.	Then let his feet be laid upon his back, and let him extend his belly from the upper part of his back, and let the weak one draw in his breath as much as possible.
Cogitur ergo cum collo uesicae ad expulsionem Lapidis ad posteriora: quare absoluitur Vrina.	Therefore it is necessary when the bladder's neck is moved for the removal of a stone, that urine be discharged entirely.
Quod si non soluitur cum eo quod diximus, et uehemens sit res super infirmum: tunc oportet ut administres extractionem eius cum instrumento, quod nominatur siringa, cuius haec est forma Sit ex argento, et sit subtile, lene, concauum sicut cannula pennae auis in subtilitate radii, longum in similitudine palmi unius et medii: cui sit cannula subtilis in capite eius.	If it is not loosened with what we have said, and the matter is severe upon the infirm person: then it is necessary that you administer its extraction with an instrument which is called a syringe, whose shape is this. Let it be of silver, and be subtle, soft, concave like a bird’s feather tube in subtlety of radius, long in similarity to one and half palm: to which let there be a subtle tube in its head.
Et modus exitus Vrinae per ipsum est, ut accipias filum duplicatum, et liges in extremitate eius lanam, aut cotum, ligatura bona: et intromittas extremitatem fili in inferiori parte Siringae: et incide cum forficibus si superfluit aliquid ex lana, uerum intromitte in cannulam cum uehementia, sicut alzer.	And the way of exit of Urine through him is, that you take a doubled thread, and tie on one end of it wool or cotton, a good ligature: and insert the end of the thread into the lower part of the Syringe: and cut with scissors if anything superfluos from the wool, but introduce into the tube with force, as alzer.
Deinde inunge siringam cum oleo, aut cum butyro, et albugine oui: et fac sedere infirmum super sedem, et embroca uesicam, et ipsius uirgam cum oleis humidis, et oleo oliuae, et aqua tepida.	Then anoint the syringe with oil, or with butter, and egg white; and make the sick person sit on a seat, and embrocate the vein, and its rod with moist oils, and olive oil, and warm water.
Deinde intromitte siringam in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat ad radicem uirgae.	Then introduce the syringe into the rod with ease, until it reaches the root of the rod.
Deinde dupla ipsam superius a parte umbilici.	Then double it above from the navel.
Deinde impelle siringam intra ipsam, donec perueniat ad Vesicam, et sentiat eam infirmus iam peruenisse ad rem uacuam: et non fit hoc secundum hunc ordinem, nisi quoniam meatus, in quo uadit, est in quo est tortuositas.	Then drive the syringe into it, until it reaches the vesicle, and feels that it has come weak to the empty thing: and this is not done in this order, unless because the passage, in which it goes, is in which there is a winding.
Deinde extende filum cum lana paulatim.	Then extend the thread with wool gradually.
Vrina enim sequetur lanam.	Urine will follow wool.
Deinde extrahe eam, et fac currere Vrinam per uiam urinae: et itera siringam, et non cesses facere illud, donec euacuetur uesica, et inueniat infirmus alleuiationem.	Then remove it and make urine flow through the urethra: and repeat with the syringe, and do not cease doing this until the bladder is emptied, and the patient finds relief.
¶ De qualitate clisterizationis uesicae cum Clepshydra.	On the quality of enema with a clepsydra.
Caput LIX.	Chapter LXIX.
Quando accidit in uesica ulcus, aut sanguis in ea congelatur, aut coartatur in ea pus, et uis distillare in eam aquas et medicinas: tunc fiat cum instrumento quod nominatur Clepshydra, et haec est forma eius.	When a sore occurs in the bladder, or blood freezes in it, or pus is constricted in it, and water and medicines are distilled into it; then let a tool called a Clepshydra be made, and this is its form.
Est enim surda, id est, clausa.	It is indeed closed, that is, sealed.
Et in eo sunt tria foramina, duo ex parte una, et unum ex parte altera, sicut uides.	And in it there are three openings, two on one side, and one on the other side, as you see.
Et locus concauus, in quo est illud quod impellit, sit secundum quantitatem quod opilet ipsum sine additione, donec quando trahitur cum eo aliquid, ex humiditatibus attrahatur: et quando impellitur, cum eo expellatur ad longinquum: secundum quod facit clepshydra, qua proiicitur naphta, id est, ignis graecus in praeliis martis.	And the concave place, where that which drives it is, let it be according to the quantity that it needs itself without addition, until when it is drawn with something, it draws from the moistures: and when it is driven, with it expel to a great distance: according to what the clepshydra does, which throws naphta, that is, Greek fire in the battles of Mars.
Cum ergo uis proiicere humiditates in uesicam, intromitte extremitatem clepshydrae in humiditatem, et trahe cum eo quod impellit ad superiora, humiditas enim trahitur in concauitatem clepshydrae.	When therefore you wish to draw moisture into a vein, introduce the end of a syringe into the moisture, and draw with it what drives it upward, for moisture is drawn into the cavity of the syringe.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem eius in uirgam, secundum quod narrauimus in siringa.	Then introduce the end of it into a rod, according to what we have narrated concerning the syringe.
Deinde impelle humiditatem cum eo quod impellit illa namque humiditas peruenit ad uesicam statim, ita quod sentit eam infirmus.	Then drive moisture with it, for that moisture comes to the wound immediately, so that the weak one feels it.
Forma clisteris subtilis quo clisterizatur uesica.	The form of a thin enema with which the bladder is cleansed.
Fiat ex argento, aut auricalco: cuius caput altius sit simile alcama paruo, et sub eo sinus inter quem cadat ligamentum.	Make it out of silver, or gold-plate; whose head be higher like a small clamp, and below that a recess where the ligature shall fall.
Deinde accipe uesicam arietis, et pone in ea humiditatem, qua uis clisterizare uesicam.	Then take a sheepskin bladder and put in it the moisture with which you wish to irrigate the bladder.
Deinde liga eam inter duos sinus ligatura forti cum filo duplo: et calefac illam humiditatem parumper super ignem.	Then bind it between two sinuses with a strong ligature of double thread: and heat that moisture for a short time over fire.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem clisteris in uirgam, postea stringe manum tuam super uesicam cum humiditate strictura decenti, donec sentiat infirmus, quod illa humiditas iam peruenit ad uesicam.	Then insert the end of the clyster into the rod, afterwards tighten your hand over the vessel with moisture of a suitable constriction, until the sick person feels that the moisture has already arrived at the vessel.
Si autem non est tibi praesens uesica, tunc accipe frustum pergameni, et fac ex eo circulum, et perfora ipsum ab omni rotunditate sua.	If you do not have a bladder present, then take a piece of parchment and make a circle out of it, and pierce it all around its entirety.
Deinde intromitte filum forte in illis foraminibus, sicut reuoluuntur.	Then insert a strong thread into those openings, as they turn.
Deinde aggrega circulum, sicut aggregatur alsofratu: postquam tu ponis in eo illud quod uis ex humiditatibus, et oleis, et aquis.	Then gather a circle, as it is gathered with plaster; after you have placed in it what you wish from moistures, and oils, and waters.
Deinde liga ipsum in instrumento: et fac cum eo sicut fecisti cum uesica ex expressione cum manu tua, donec perueniat humiditas ad uesicam.	Then bind him in the instrument and do with it as you did with the bladder from expression with your hand until humidity comes to the bladder.
¶ De extractione Lapidis.	On the Extraction of Stones.
Caput LX.	Chapter LX.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Lapidis, et curationem eius cum medicinis: et dixi differentiam inter Lapidem generatum in renibus, et uesica, et signa illius totius: et dixi Lapidem in quo cadit operatio cum manu et sectio: et est Lapis generatus in uesica proprie: et ille qui figitur in uirga: et ego sum narrans illud cum expositione manifesta et abbreuiatione.	We have spoken in the division of kinds of Stone, and its treatment with medicines: and I have said the difference between Stone generated in the kidneys, and bladder, and signs of the whole of it: and I have said the Stone in which the operation falls with hand and section: and it is Stone generated in the bladder properly: and he who is fixed in a rod: and I am narrating it with manifest exposition and abbreviation.
Dico ergo, quod Lapis generatus in uesica, plurimum accidit pueris.	Therefore I say that a stone generated in the bladder happens most often to boys.
Et ex signis eius est, quod urina egreditur ex uesica similis aquae in subtilitate sua: et apparet in ea harena alba, et fricat infirmus uirgam suam, et laborat cum ea, et multotiens pendet.	And from the signs of it is that urine exits from the bladder similar to water in its fineness: and there appears in it white sand, and the weak man rubs his staff with it, and he labors with it, and often hangs down.
Deinde erigitur, et egreditur cum eo anus in multis eorum.	Then it is erected, and it goes out with him in many of them.
Et est facilis sanatio puerorum, ex eo usquequo consequuntur quatuordecim annos.	And healing is easy for boys up to the age of fourteen.
Et est difficilis in senibus.	And it is difficult in the elderly.
In iuuenibus autem est media, in eo quod est inter illud: et eius cuius Lapis est maior, curatio facilior: et si paruus, est econuerso illius cura.	In youths, however, it is medium, in that which is between those: and of that whose Stone is greater, healing is easier: and if small, its cure is reversed.
Cum ergo peruenimus ad curationem, oportet in primis, ut mundificemus infirmum cum clisteri, quod extrahat totum stercus quod est in intestinis suis: ipsum enim quandoque prohibet inuentionem Lapidis apud inquisitionem.	When we come to the cure, it is first necessary that we cleanse the sick person with enemas, which will draw out all the feces that are in his bowels: for this sometimes prevents the finding of the Stone when it is sought.
Deinde accipiatur infirmus cum pedibus suis, et concutiatur, et moueatur ad inferiora: ut descendat Lapis ad profundum uesicae, aut saliat de loco alto aliquotiens.	Then take the patient with his feet and shake him and move him downwards so that the stone descends to the depth of the bladder, or leaps from a height several times.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas praeparatum, et manus eius sint sub coxis ipsius, ut fiat uesica tota decliuis ad inferiora.	Then make him sit between your hands, and his hands be under his hips, so that the whole bladder may slope downwards.
Deinde perquire eum, et tange eum extrinsecus.	Then inquire about him, and touch him externally.
Si ergo sentis Lapidem in spacio, tunc propera statim cum sectione super ipsum.	If therefore you feel a stone in the space, then hasten immediately with a section upon it.
Quod si non cadat sub tactu tuo omnino, tunc oportet ut abstergas digitum indicem cum oleo manus sinistrae, si infirmus est puer: aut digitum medium si est iuuenis completus: et intromittas ipsum in anum suum, et perquire de Lapide, donec stat sub digito tuo: et conuerte eum paulatim ad collum uesicae.	If it does not fall under your touch at all, then you must wipe the index finger with the oil of the left hand, if the boy is weak: or the middle finger if he is a complete young man: and insert it into his anus, and inquire about the Stone until it stands under your finger: and turn him gradually to the neck of the bladder.
Deinde preme super ipsum cum digito tuo, et impelle ipsum ad exteriora aduersus locus, cuius sectionem uis: et praecipe ministro, ut premat uesicam manu sua, et praecipe alii ministro, ut extendat testiculos manu sua dextra ad superiora: et alia manu sua, ut remoueat cutem, quae est sub testiculis in parte a loco in quo est sectio.	Then press upon it with your finger, and push it outwards towards the place whose section you wish: and order your assistant to press the scrotum with his hand, and order another assistant to extend the testicles with his right hand upwards: and with the other hand, to remove the skin which is under the testicles in the part where the incision is.
Deinde intromitte Spatumile incidens, cuius forma haec est.	Then introduce a spoon-shaped blade, whose form is this.
Et finde in eo quod est inter anum et testiculos, et non in medio, ad latus natis sinistrae: et sit sectio super ipsum lapidem, et digitus tuus sit in ano: et fiat sectio transuersa, ut sit sectio exterius ampla, et interius stricta, secundum quantitatem quod sit possibile egressio Lapidis ex ea non maior.	And find in it what is between the anus and testicles, and not in the middle, to the side of the left hip: and let the incision be above the stone, and your finger be in the anus: and let a transverse incision be made, so that the external incision is wide, and the internal is narrow, according to the quantity that it is possible for the stone to exit from it not greater.
Fortasse enim comprimit digitus, qui est in ano Lapidem apud sectionem, et egreditur absque difficultate.	Perhaps a finger which is in the anus compresses the stone at the point of incision, and it comes out without difficulty.
Et scias, quod ex Lapide est cui sunt anguli et margines, quare fit difficilis exitus eius propter illud.	And know that from a stone which has corners and margins, because of this it is difficult its exit.
Et ex eo est lenis, similis glandulae, et rotundus: et fit facilis egressus eius.	And from that it is smooth, like a gland, and round: and its exit is easy.
Ei ergo cui sunt anguli, et margines, adde in fissura.	Therefore, to him who has angles and margins, add to the fissure.
Quod si non egreditur ita, tunc oportet ut ingenies super ipsum: aut stringas super eum cum gesti decenter, cuius extremitas sit sicut Luna, quae stringat super Lapidem, et non euadat ab ea: aut ut intromittas sub eo instrumentum subtile, curuatae extremitatis.	If it does not come out in this way, then it is necessary that you apply pliers over it, or tie over it with a band tightly, whose end should be like the Moon which tightens over Stone and does not escape from it, or to insert under it an instrument subtle, of curved extremity.
Si autem non potes super cum, tunc amplifica foramen parumper.	If you cannot get it in above, then enlarge the opening a little.
Quod si uincit te aliquid ex sanguine, abscinde ipsum cum zegi.	If something from blood overcomes you, cut it off with a zig.
Si uero lapis est plus quam unus, tunc impelle in primis magnum ad os uesicae.	If a stone is more than one, then drive first the large one to the mouth of the bladder.
Deinde incide super ipsum.	Then cut upon it.
Postea impelle paruum post illud: et similiter fac si sunt plures duobus.	Then push a small piece after that: and similarly do if there are more than two.
Quod si magnus est ualde, tunc ignorantia est ut seces super ipsum sectione magna.	If it is large, then ignorance is great as to cut over it with a large incision.
Quoniam accidit infirmo una duarum rerum, aut ut moriatur, aut accidit ei distillatio urinae assidua: proptera, quia non consolidatur locus omnino.	Because it happens to a sick person, one of two things, either that he will die or that there is frequent discharge of urine because the place does not heal at all.
Verum administra expulsionem eius, donec egrediatur: aut ingenia in fractura eius cum forficibus, donec extrahas eum frustatim.	But administer expulsion until it comes out: or use instruments in its fracture with forceps, until you remove it bit by bit.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc imple uulnus thure, et aloe, et sanguine draconis: et stringe ipsum, et pone super ipsum pannum infusum oleo et uino, aut oleo rosato, et aqua frigida: ut sedetur apostema calidum.	When therefore you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with frankincense, and aloe, and dragon's blood: and bind it, and put upon it a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or rose oil, and cold water: that a hot abscess may sit.
Deinde resupina infirmum super collum suum, et non soluas ligamentum, usque ad diem tertium.	Then place the sick person on their back over his neck, and not loosen the ligatures until the third day.
Cum ergo solueris ipsum, embroca locum cum aqua, et oleo multo.	When therefore you have loosened it, pack the place with water and much oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dyafinicon, et unguento basilicon, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with dyacin ointment and basilica ointment until it heals.
Si autem accidit in uulnere apostema calidum additum, et corrosi, et illi similia: sicut si congeletur sanguis in uesica, et prohibeatur ex eo urina: et cognoscitur illud ex egressione sanguinis cum urina.	If, however, a hot abscess, and corrosive, and similar to these occurs in the wound: as if blood congeals in the bladder, and urine is prevented from it; and this is known by the emission of blood with urine.
Intromitte ergo digitum tuum in uulnus, et extrahe illum sanguinem.	Therefore insert your finger into the wound and draw out the blood from it.
Nam si remanet, prouocat ad corruptionem uesicae, et putrefactionem eius.	For if it remains, it provokes the corruption of the bladder, and its putrefaction.
Deinde ablue uulnus cum aceto, et aqua, et sale: et oppone omni speciei cum eo quod conuenit ex curatione, usquequo sanetur.	Then wash the wound with vinegar and water and salt, and apply to it of every kind what is fitting for its cure until it heals.
Et oportet in horis curationis totius, ut liges duas coxas, et aggreges, caussa medicinarum quae ponuntur super locum.	And it is necessary in the hours of the healing of the whole, that you bind two thighs, and join them, because of the medicines which are placed upon the place.
Quod si lapis est paruus, et sit in meatu uirgae, et figitur in eo, et prohibetur urinae exitus: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod narro antequam peruenias ad sectionem.	If the stone is small and is in the urethra, and it is lodged there and prevents the outflow of urine: then treat it with what I told you before you come to the incision.
Multotiens enim a sectione excusaris per hanc curationem, iam enim probaui illud.	For many times indeed you will be excused from surgery by this cure, for I have already proved this.
Et est, ut accipias Perforatorium ex ferro alferico, cuius haec est forma, triangulatae extremitatis, acutum, fixum in ligno.	And it is, as you take a perforator from iron steel, whose form is that of a triangular end, sharp, fixed in wood.
Deinde accipe filum, et liga cum eo uirgam sub lapide ut non redeat ad uesicam.	Then take a thread and tie it with a stick under a stone so that it does not return to the wound.
Deinde intromitte ferrum perforans in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat Perforatorium ad ipsum lapidem: et reuolue Perforatorium manu tua in ipso lapide paulatim: et coneris perforationem eius, donec facias ipsum penetrare a parte altera.	Then insert the piercing iron into the rod with ease, until the perforator reaches the stone itself; and revolve the perforator with your hand in the stone gradually; and try to make its perforation, until you cause it to penetrate from the other side.
Urina namque absoluitur statim.	Urine however is perfected immediately.
Deinde preme manum tuam super illud quod remansit ex lapide ab exteriori parte uirgae.	Then press your hand upon that which remains of the stone from the outer part of the shaft.
Ipse enim frangitur, et egreditur cum urina, et sanatur infirmus.	He is broken, and he exits with urine, and the sick man is healed.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi haec curatio, propter aliquid quod prohibet ab illo: tunc liga filum sub lapide, et filum aliud supra lapidem.	If this treatment is not prepared for you because of something that prevents it, then tie a thread under the stone and another thread above the stone.
Deinde seca super lapidem in ipsa uirga inter duas ligaturas.	Then dry over a stone in the very rod between two ligatures.
Deinde extrahe ipsum.	Then remove it.
Postea solue ligamentum, et mundifica sanguinem congelatum, qui fit in uulnere.	Afterwards, dissolve the ligament, and cleanse the congealed blood which forms in the wound.
Et non est necessarium ligamentum fili sub lapide, nisi ut non redeat ad uesicam: et ligamentum aliud desuper, nisi ut quando soluitur filum post egressionem lapidis, redeat cutis ad locum suum, et cooperiat uulnus: et propter illud necesse est tibi illud quando ligas filum superius, ut eleues cutem ad superiora, ut redeat apud complementum tuum, et cooperiat uulnus, sicut diximus.	And it is not necessary to place a thread beneath the stone, unless it is so that it does not return to the wound; and another ligament from above, unless when the thread is loosened after the removal of the stone, the skin returns to its place, and covers the wound; and for this reason it is necessary for you when you tie the upper thread, that you elevate the skin upwards, so that it may return to its proper place, and cover the wound, as we have said.
¶ De extractione Lapidis mulierum.	On the Extraction of Stones from Women.
Caput LXI.	Chapter LX I.
Parum generatur Lapis in mulieribus.	A stone is rarely produced in women.
Si autem accidat alicui earum lapis, tunc difficilis est curatio, et prohibetur propter modos multos.	If someone should happen to have one of these stones, then the treatment is difficult, and it is prohibited for many reasons.
Vnus eorum est: quod mulier fortasse est uirgo.	One of these is: that a woman perhaps is a virgin.
Et secundus est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem quae detegat seipsam medico, quando est casta, aut ex habentibus maritos.	And the second is because you do not find a woman who will reveal herself to a doctor when she is chaste, or from those who have husbands.
Tertius est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem bene scientem hanc artem, praecipue operationem cum manu.	Thirdly, because you do not find a woman well-versed in this art, especially the operation with the hand.
Et quartus est longinquitas a loco lapidis: quare indiget sectione profunda, et in illo est timor.	And the fourth is the distance from the place of the stone: therefore a deep incision is needed, and there is fear in this.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad illud, tunc oportet ut accipias mulierem medicam, bene scientem: et parum inuenitur.	If necessity compels it, then it is necessary to take a female physician, well-knowing; and few are found.
Si uero priuaris ea, tunc quaere medicum castum, subtilem, et praesenta mulierem obstetricem bene doctam in re mulierum, aut mulierem quae in hac arte innuit partem artis: fac ergo eam praesentem, et praecipue ei, ut faciat totum quod praecipis ei ex inquisitione super lapidem.	If you do this first, then seek a chaste, subtle physician and present the woman to a midwife well-versed in women's matters, or a woman who practices this art. Do this for her, and especially instruct her to do everything that you prescribe to her based on the examination of the stone.
In primis quod est, ut aspiciat si mulier est uirgo: tunc oportet ut intromittat digitum in anum eius, et quaerat lapidem.	First of all, it is necessary to see if the woman is a virgin: then one should insert a finger into her anus and seek the stone.
Si ergo inuenit ipsum, coartet eum sub digito suo, et tunc praecipe obstetrici, ut intromittat digitum suum in uuluam infirmae, et inquirat super lapidem, postquam ponit manum suam sinistram super uesicam, et comprimit eam compressione bona.	If therefore he finds it, he will compress it under his finger, and then orders the midwife to insert her finger into the womb of the weak woman, and to inquire about the stone, after she has placed her left hand over the uterus, and compresses it with good pressure.
Si ergo inuenit lapidem, tunc oportet ut gradatim moueat eum ab orificio uesicae ad inferiora cum summa uirtutis suae, donec perueniat cum eo ad radicem coxae.	If therefore he finds the stone, then it is necessary that he move it gradually from the opening of the bladder to the lower regions with the greatest of his skill, until he comes to the root of the hip.
Deinde secet super eum apud oppositionem medietatis uuluae apud radicem coxae, ex quacunque parte praeparatur ei, et sentit lapidem in illa parte: et digitus eius non remoueatur a lapide, coartans sub eo: et sit sectio parua in primis.	Then he cuts above it at the middle of the thigh at the root of the hip, from whatever part it is prepared, and feels the stone in that part: and his finger shall not be moved from the stone, pressing under it: and let the section be small at first.
Deinde intromittat radium super illam sectionem.	Then he inserts a probe above that incision.
Si ergo sentit lapidem, tunc addat in sectionem secundum quantitatem proportionatam quod lapis egreditur ab ea.	If therefore he feels the stone, then let him add to the incision according to the quantity proportionate to what the stone issues forth from it.
Et scias, quod species lapidis sunt multae.	And know that there are many kinds of stone.
Ex his enim est paruus, et magnus, lenis et asper, longus, et rotundus habens ramos.	From these things is small, and large, gentle and rough, long, and round having branches.
Scias ergo species eius, ut significetur tibi per hoc super illud quod uis.	Therefore, know its kind, as it shall be signified to you by this over that which you see.
Si ergo uincit te sanguis, tunc adde in loco zegi tritum, et tene ipsum hora una, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If blood overcomes you, then add crushed zegerib to the place and hold it for one hour until the bleeding stops.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis: et fac, ut praepares tecum ex instrumentis, quae dixi in extractione lapidis in uiris, ut adiuueris per ea in operatione tua.	Then return to your operation until the stone comes out; and do, that you prepare with you from instruments, which I said in the extraction of the stone in men, so that you may help through these in your operation.
Quod si uincit te fluxus sanguinis, et scis quod expulsio sanguinis est ex arteria quae incisa est: tunc pone puluerem super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis strictura decenti: et non mutes illud: et dimitte lapidem, et non extrahas ipsum.	If a bleeding wound overcomes you, and you know that the blood is flowing from an artery that has been cut: then place powder over the location, and bind it with little pieces of a suitable bandage: and do not move it: and dismiss the stone, and do not extract it.
Fortasse enim morietur mulier infirma.	Perhaps the weak woman will die.
Deinde cura uulnus.	Then, care for the wound.
Cum ergo sedatur acuitas sanguinis post dies, et putrefit locus, tune redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis.	When therefore the sharpness of the blood has subsided after days, and the place has rotted, then return to your operation until the stone emerges.
¶ De sectione suiper Herniam aquosam.	On cutting a hydrocele.
Caput LXII.	Chapter LXII.
Ramex aquosa non est, nisi aggregatio humiditatis in sifac albo, quod est sub cute testiculi continente ouum: et nominatur sifac.	The ramie of water is not, except for a collection of moisture in the white sifac, which is under the skin containing the testicle; and it is called sifac.
Et quandoque est in panniculo proprio sibi, quem praeparauit ei natura in parte oui, donec putetur: quod est ouum aliud, et est cutis testiculi inter sifac album, quod diximus: et non fit illud nisi raro.	And sometimes it is in the own tunic which nature has prepared for it in the part of the scrotum, until it seems to be: which is another egg, and it is the skin of the testicle between the white sifac, which we have said; and this is not done except rarely.
Et generatio quidem huius ramicis, est ex debilitate quae accidit testiculis: quare effunditur ad eos haec materia.	And this kind of branching is produced from weakness which happens in the testicles: therefore this matter flows to them.
Et quandoque accidit ex percussione super testiculos.	And sometimes it happens from a blow upon the testicles.
Et haec humiditas est habens colores multos.	And this moisture has many colors.
Aut enim est color eius decliuis ad citrinitatem, aut est sanguineus rubeus, aut faeculentus, niger, aut est aquosus albus, et est illud quod est plus.	Either its color is sloping toward yellowness, or it is reddish-blood colored, or it is dark, black, like feces, or it is watery white, and this is the most common of these.
Et signa quibus scitur ubi sit aggregatio aquae, sunt ista.	And signs by which it is known where the collection of water is, are these.
Nam si est in sifac albo quod diximus, tunc apostema est rotundum ad longitudinem parumper sicut figura oui: et non apparet testiculus, quoniam humiditas continet eum ab omni parte.	If it is in a white band, as we said, then the abscess is round to a short length, like the shape of an eye; and the testicle does not appear because moisture holds it back on all sides.
Et si est humiditas in panniculo proprio sibi, tunc apostema est rotundum cum parte oui, et propter hoc extimat homo quia est ouum aliud.	And if there is moisture in the own cloth, then an abscess is round with a part of egg white, and therefore a man thinks that it is another egg.
Et si humiditas est inter cutem testiculorum et sifac album, tunc cadit sub sensu.	And if humidity is between the skin of the testicles and the white tunic, then it falls under sensation.
Quando ergo uis cognitionem coloris humiditatis, tunc experire colorem humiditatis in apostemate cum Intromisso quadrato, cuius forma praecessit.	When therefore you wish to know the knowledge of the color of moisture, then experience the color of moisture in an abscess with a square having been inserted, whose form preceded.
Secundum illud ergo quod egreditur in uestigio Intromissi, iudica de illo quod est inter ipsum.	Therefore, according to what emerges from the trace of the introduction, judge that which is between them.
Cum ergo uenimus ad curationem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, ut phlebotometur si possibile est ei illud, et uides corpus eius plenum.	When therefore we come to treatment with iron, then it is necessary that you instruct the sick person, that he be bled if possible, and see his body full.
Deinde resupinetur super dorsum suum super rem altam parum, et pone sub eo pannos multos.	Then it is laid back on its back over a somewhat elevated thing, and cloths are placed beneath it.
Deinde sede tu super sinistram eius, et praecipe ministro, ut sedeat a dextra eius, qui extendat uirgam eius ad unum duorum laterum cutis testiculorum, et ad partem mirach uentris.	Then sit you on his left side, and bid the minister to sit on his right side, who shall extend his rod to one of the two sides of the skin of the testicles, and to the part called "mirach" of the abdomen.
Deinde accipe spatumile latum, et seca cutem testiculorum ex medio per longitudinem, usque prope pectinem: et fiat sectio secundum rectitudinem aequedistantis lineae quae diuidit cutem testiculorum, donec perueniat ad sifac album comprehendens: et excoria ipsum et obserua, uel caue ex hoc, ut seces ipsum: et sit excoriatio tua qua ipsum excorias, ex parte quae suspenditur cum ouo plus: et subtiliter scrutare cum excoriatione secundum quantitatem quod tibi possibile est.	Then take a wide spatula and cut the skin of the testicles from the middle lengthwise, as far as almost the pubic bone: and let the incision be made according to the right line which divides the skin of the testicles, until it reaches the white covering: and scrape this off and observe, or carefully avoid cutting into this, so that you do not sever it: and let your scraping be on the part that hangs with the egg more: and carefully examine with the scraping according to the quantity that is possible to you.
Deinde perfora sifac plenum aqua perforatione ampla, et extrahe totam aquam.	Then pierce the syringe full of water with a wide perforation and draw out all the water.
Deinde separa inter duo labia sectionis cum uncinis, et extende sifac ad superiora, et non tangas cutem testiculorum comprehendentem: et incide sifac qualitercunque est possibile tibi incidere ipsum, aut cum totalitate sua, aut frustatim, praecipue latus eius subtile.	Then separate between the two lips of the incision with hooks, and extend the scalpel upwards, and do not touch the skin containing the testicles: and cut the scrotum however you can, either in its entirety or piecemeal, especially its subtle side.
Nam si tu non exquisite perscrutaris, in incisione eius non fit securitas, quin aqua redeat.	For if you do not carefully examine it, there is no safety in its incision, but water returns.
Si autem procedit ouum exterius a cute sua in hora operationis tuae: tunc quando compleueris sectionem sifac, reduc ipsum.	If, however, an external egg proceeds from its shell during your operation: then when you have completed the incision of the wound, reduce it back in.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cutis testiculorum cum sutura.	Then gather together the two skin flaps of the testicles with a suture.
Deinde cura ipsum sicut reliqua uulnera, donec sanetur.	Then care for it as for other wounds, until it is healed.
Quod si inuenis ouum corruptum ex nigredine alia, tunc oportet ut liges uasa, quae sunt suspensorium, timens fluxum sanguinis.	If you find a corrupted egg from another blackness, then it is necessary that you ligature the vessels which are suspensory, fearing the flow of blood.
Deinde abscinde testiculum cum suspensorio, et extrahe ouum: postea cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then cut away the testicle with its suspensory ligament, and extract the egg: afterwards take care of it as we have said.
Si uero aqua est aggregata in duabus partibus, tunc scias quia sunt duae ramices: seca ergo partem aliam secundum quod fecisti in altera aequaliter.	If water is gathered in two parts, then know that there are two branches: therefore dry the other part according to what you have done in the other one equally.
Et si aequatur tibi, ut sit operatio una, tunc fac: deinde absterge sanguinem.	And if it seems fit to you that there be one operation, then do so; afterward wipe away the blood.
Et intromitte in sectiones lanam submersam in oleo, aut in oleo rosato: et pone deforis lanam aliam quam submersisti in uino et oleo, et expande eam super duos testiculos, et mirach uentris: et pone desuper pannos duplicatos, et sunt puluilli: et liga eos desuper cum ligamento, quod est habens sex secundum hanc formam.	And introduce into the sections cloth submerged in oil, or in rose-colored oil; and place before the opening another piece of cloth which you have submerged in wine and oil, and expand it over the two testicles, and the miracle of the belly; and place above doubled cloths, and are small rolls; and bind them above with a bandage which is having six according to this form.
Deinde sumantur duo panni, et suantur, et impleantur la na carminata, secundum hanc similitudinem: et fiant extremitates quibus premitur ex coto, aut lana humida: et aggregentur cum strictura in lumbari bracharum: et una extremitatum accipiat super anum usque ad dorsum, et secunda accipiat ad partem pectinis: et duae extremitates super duas coxas inferius, et duae extremitates aliae super duo inguina, et aggregetur strictura tota in lumbari bracharum.	Then two cloths are taken, and they are sewn, and they are filled with carminative, according to this likeness: and the ends by which it is pressed are made of felt, or damp wool: and they are assembled with the binding in the lumbar brace: and one end takes over the anus up to the back, and the second takes to the chest part: and two ends above the two lower hips, and two other ends above the two groins, and the whole binding is assembled in the lumbar brace.
Et, quandoque artificialiter medicatur haec ramex cum cauterio loco sectionis cum ferro: et est, ut accipias cauterium cultellare subtile, et seces cum eo cutem testiculorum: et est ignitum, secundum quod narrauimus: donec quando detegitur sifac album continens aquam: tunc accipe cauterium, secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes this branch is treated artificially with a cautery at the place of the incision with iron: and it is, that you take a thin knife-shaped cautery, and cut with it the skin of the testicles: and it is ignited, according to what we have narrated: until when it reveals the white sifac containing water: then take the cautery, according to this form.
Assimilatur literae graecae.	It assimilates like the Greek letter.
Deinde perfora cum eo illud sifac, et est ignitum, donec egrediatur humiditas tota.	Then pierce it with that, and it is ignited until all moisture departs.
Deinde extende sifac cum uncinis, et excoria cum cauterio subtili ignito, et incide ipsum secundum quod possibile est tibi, donec eradices totum eius.	Then extend the scalpel with hooks, and scrape away with a fine burning cautery, and cut into it as much as is possible for you, until you have removed all of it.
Et caue ex ouo, ne tangat ipsum ignis.	And be careful from the egg, lest fire touch it.
Et scias, quod haec operatio est saluior, et longinquior a fluxu sanguinis, et melior quam operatio cum sectione.	And know that this operation is more healing and farther from blood flow, and better than the operation with incision.
Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit in hora sectionis, aut in hora cauterii apostema calidum, aut fluxus sanguinis, aut aliquid aliud: tunc oportet ut cures quod contrarietatem tibi facit ex illo cum curatione quae conuenit ei, secundum quod praemissum est.	If, however, something contrary happens to you at the time of incision, or at the time of cauterization, an abscess that is hot, or bleeding, or something else: then it is necessary that you cure what is contrary to you from it with the cure that is suitable for it, according to what was said before.
Si autem infirmus est timidus, et non expectat super hanc operationem, propter horribilitatem suam: tunc administra perforationem secundum quod ego narro illud: et est.	If, however, the sick person is fearful and does not await this operation because of its horror: then administer the perforation as I narrate it: and it is.
Quando certificatur tibi apud te per illud quod diximus de significationibus, quod ramex est aquosa: tunc oportet quod facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	When it is made certain to you by that which we said of significations, that the ramus is watery; then it is necessary that you make the sick person sit upon a seat elevated.
Deinde perfora apostema in inferiori parte sui cum spatumili lato: et pone perforationem secundum longitudinem corporis, et sit apertio ampla, donec currat aqua tota.	Then pierce the abscess in its lower part with a wide spatula: and place the perforation according to the length of the body, and let the opening be wide until water runs through completely.
Deinde pone super locum cotum, et liga ipsum, et dimitte ipsum ut currat residuum aquae: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then place over the common location a cloth and tie it, and allow it to run until the residue of water runs out; then care for it until the wound heals.
Si autem contrarietas sit egressioni aquae in hora qua perforas ipsam: et non sit illud nisi propterea, quia panniculus albus contrarietatem facit in orificio uulneris, et prohibet exitum aquae: tunc oportet ut intromittas pennam in uulnus, aut instrumentum cum quo extrahitur aqua hydropicorum, cuius forma praecessit: aut adde in operatione uulneris parumper.	If however the contrary is that of the water's exit at the hour when you perforate it; and this is not otherwise, because the white panniculus makes a contrary force in the wound opening, and prevents the exit of water: then it is necessary to insert a feather into the wound, or an instrument with which hydropic water is extracted, whose shape preceded: or add a little to the operation of the wound.
Et scias, quod aqua redit, et aggregatur post sex menses, aut circiter eos.	And know that water returns and is gathered after six months, or about those.
Cum ergo aggregatur, tunc pertoretur secundum eundem modum, et pertransibit infirmus dies suos.	When therefore it is gathered together, then it shall be returned according to the same mode, and the sick person shall pass his days.
¶ De cura Ramicis carnosae.	On the treatment of fleshy branches.
Caput LXIII.	Chapter LXIII.
Scias, quod in sectione super hanc Ramicem, est ex timore perducente ad perniciem in pluribus dispositionibus.	Know that in sectioning above this branch, it is due to fear leading to harm in many situations.
Quapropter uidetur mihi eius dimissio saluari ex ea.	Therefore it seems to me his discharge from that is salutary.
Et ego sum rememorans operationem in ea, et species apostematis.	And I am remembering the operation on it, and the appearance of the abscess.
Dico ergo, quod accidunt apostemata multa in corporibus, ex quibus componuntur testiculi: et fit illud ex caussis multis, scilicet.	Therefore I say, that many abscesses occur in bodies, of which some are formed in the testicles: and this comes about from many causes, namely.
Aut ex superfluitate acuta, uel acri, quae effunditur ad testiculos.	Either from an excess of sharp, acute pain, which flows down to the testicles.
Aut ex percussione.	Or by percussion.
Et est color apostematis secundum colorem corporis, et non inuenitur ei dolor: et est apostema graue.	And the color of an abscess is according to the color of the body, and pain is not found in it, and it is a grave abscess.
Et fortasse est apostema lapideum, cuius color est fuscus, et non est sensus ei.	And perhaps it is a stony abscess, whose color is dusky, and there is no feeling in it.
Et quandoque fit ex nodatione arteriarum, et inflatione earum: sicut iam praecessit eius rememoratio: aut ex inflatione uenarum.	And sometimes it happens from the tying of arteries and their inflation: as has already been recalled above: or from the inflation of veins.
Quod ergo est ex eis ex inflatione arteriarum, cognoscitur per dispositionem apostematis, quando comprimis ipsum digitis tuis.	Therefore, what is from them due to the inflation of the arteries, is known by the arrangement of the abscess, when you compress it with your fingers.
Et non oportet ut tangas ipsum prorsus.	And you should not touch it at all.
Illud uero quod fit ex inflatione uenarum, non dispergitur ex eo aliquid apud compressionem cum digitis.	That which is done by inflation of the veins, does not disperse anything when compressed with fingers.
Et iam possibile est, quod super hanc speciem fiat sectio, et super reliquas carnes: et est, ut seces cutem testiculorum.	And now it is possible that a section can be made on this kind of thing, and on the remaining flesh: and it is, as to cut the skin of the testicles.
Deinde extende ouum ad sursum, et extrahe ipsum cum sifach albo: et libera suspensorium ex uasis, et liga uasa: et incide suspensorium postquam tu liberas ipsum ab omni parte ex partibus oui.	Then extend the egg upwards and remove it with a white cloth: and free the suspension from the vessels, and tie the vessels: and cut the suspension after you have freed it from every part of the parts of the wound.
Si ergo ouum consolidatum est cum illis carnibus natis, tunc oportet ut attrahas ouum, et incidas ipsum.	If therefore the egg is consolidated with those fleshly matters born, then it ought that you draw the egg, and cut into it.
Et si adhaerentia est inter aliquid ex siphaket, aut in eo quod est inter uasa: tunc oportet ut liberes totam illam adhaerentiam, et incidas eam incisione rotunda.	And if there is adherence between something from the siphon, or in what is between vessels: then it is necessary that you free the entire adhesion, and cut it with a round incision.
Si autem est natiuitas carnis in loco adhaerentiae quae est retro: tunc oportet ut incidas totum eius, et extrahas ouum, sicut diximus.	If however the birth of flesh is in the place of adherence which is behind; then it is necessary that you cut the whole of it, and extract the egg, as we have said.
Cum ergo completur operatio tua, tnnc imple uulnus in lana infusa in oleo rosato, et uino: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When therefore your operation is complete, then fill the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and wine; then take care of it with the rest of the cure until it heals.
¶ De cura Ramicis, quae est cum Vite.	On the treatment of branches, which is with a vine.
Caput LXIIII.	Chapter LXIV.
Uitis est apostema inuolutum quadam inuolutione, simile botro, cum mollificatione testiculorum: et fit difficilis super infirmum motus et exercitium, et deambulatio.	An ulcer is a boil enclosed by some kind of wrapping, similar to a hernia, with softening of the testicles; and it makes difficult movement over the weak one, and exercise, and walking.
Et in curatione huius aegritudinis est ex timore, propter illud cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And in the healing of this illness there is fear, because of the remembrance of that which preceded it.
Verum oportet, ut dicamus operationem in ea secundum quod fecerunt primi.	Truly, it is necessary that we speak of the operation according to what the first ones did.
Dico ergo, quod oportet ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	Therefore I say that it is necessary that you make the sick person sit on a raised seat.
Deinde impelle suspensorium testiculorum ad inferiora.	Then drive the testicular suspensory downwards.
Deinde tene cutem testiculorum cum digitis tuis, cum uasis quae sunt propinqua uirgae: et teneat ea minister alius, et extendat ea extensione uehementi.	Then hold the skin of the testicles with your fingers, together with the folds which are near the scrotum: and let another person hold it, and stretch it with a forceful extension.
Deinde incide cum spatumili lato acuto sectione transuersa in directo uasorum, donec detegantur uasa.	Then make an incision with a wide sharp spade-like instrument transversely into the direct vessels, until the vessels are discovered.
Deinde excoria ab omni parte, sicut diximus tibi in extractione Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then scrape from every part, as we have told you in the extraction of the arteries that are in the temples.
Postea fige in eis acum in qua sit filum duplum, et liga ipsum in primo locorum quibus accidunt Vites: et liga ipsum iterum in ultimo eorum.	Then make a knot in which there is a thread double, and tie it at the first place where the veins occur: and tie it again at their last.
Deinde seca ea in media sectione recta secundum longitudinem corporis, et extrahe quod aggregatur ex humiditatibus faeculentis corruptis.	Then dry it in the middle section straight according to the length of the body, and extract what is gathered from foul-smelling corrupt moistures.
Deinde cura uulnus cum curatione reliquorum uulnerum, in quibus uis generari saniem, ut cadant uasa quae nutriunt unum testiculorum.	Then care for a wound as with the care of other wounds, in which pus is to be generated, so that vessels which nourish one testicle fall away.
Non est enim malum per illud.	It is not evil because of it.
Si autem accidat Vitis omnibus uasis, tunc oportet ut extrahantur propter hoc testiculi cum uasis: ut non priuetur ouum nutrimento, propter incisionem, et tabescat, uel arescat, et non sit iuuamentum cum eis.	If it happens that the veins are all cut by a wound, then they must be removed with the testicles so that the egg is not deprived of nourishment because of the incision and does not waste away or burn up and be without benefit from them.
¶ De cura Ramicis intestinalis.	On the treatment of intestinal volvulus.
Caput LXV.	Chapter LXVIII.
Euentus huius Ramicis est ex sectione, quae accidit in sifach extenso super uentrem in parte inguinum ex mirach uentris.	This ailment of Ramicis comes from a cut that occurs on the extended sifach over the abdomen in the groin region from the mirach of the abdomen.
Quare descendunt intestina ex illa Ruptura ad unum testiculorum.	Therefore intestines descend from that rupture to one testicle.
Et haec Ruptura est aut ex sifach, aut extensione eius.	And this rupture is either from a tearing, or an extension of it.
Et accidunt istae duae species ex caussis multis.	And these two kinds occur from many causes.
Aut ex percussione.	Or by percussion.
Aut saltu.	Or by jumping.
Aut clamore.	Or with shouting.
Aut eleuatione rei grauis, et similibus.	Or by elevating a heavy thing, and similar things.
Et signum, quando est ex extensione sifach.	And a sign, when it is from the extension of the siphon.
Est quod accidit paulatim in tempore longo, et non accidit subito: et est apostema aequale uersus profundum: propterea, quod sifach comprimit intestinum.	This is what happens gradually over a long time, and does not happen suddenly: and it is an abscess equal to the depth; because of this, the siphon compresses the intestine.
Et signum eius quando est ex sectione sifach, quia facit accidere ex principio sui dolorem uehementem subito: et est apostema diuersum, apparens sub cute propinque: et illud est propter exitum intestini, et cursus eius ad exteriora sifach.	And its sign when it is from a cut in the skin, because it causes a sudden violent pain from its beginning: and it is an abscess different, appearing under the skin nearby; and this is because of the exit of the intestine, and its course to the outside of the skin.
Et quandoque egreditur cum intestino zirbum: et nominatur haec Ramex intestinalis, et zirbia: et quandoque fit cum uentositate.	And sometimes it comes out with a piece of intestine: and this is called Intestinal Ream; and the piece: and sometimes it is done with wind.
Et quandoque currit in intestinum stercus, et retinetur illic: et est cum eo pernicies infirmi: quoniam facit accidere dolorem prauum, et praecipue quando premitur.	And sometimes feces run into the intestines and are retained there: and this is harmful to the sick person because it causes bad pain, especially when it is pressed upon.
Et in curatione specierum aegritudinis huius cum ferro est timor: quare oportet ut caueatur casus in ea.	And in the treatment of this kind of disease with iron there is fear: therefore it ought to be guarded against accidents.
Et modus operationis est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut reducat intestinum manu sua ad interiora concauitatis suae, si obedit reditui.	And the way of operating is that you order the sick person to bring back the intestine with his hand into the cavity of his body, if he obeys the return.
Deinde resupinetur super collum suum inter manus tuas: et eleua crura eius.	Then he is laid back on his neck between your hands; and raise his legs.
Deinde extende cutem quae sequitur cutem ad superiora, et seca cutem testiculorum totam per longitudinem.	Then extend the skin that follows the skin above, and cut the skin of the testicles entirely along its length.
Deinde fige in duobus labiis sectionis uncinos, secundum quod indiges ad aperiendum sectionem cum eis: et sectio sit secundum quantitatem, quod sit possibile, ut egrediatur ex ea ouum.	Then fix hooks on the two lips of the incision, according to what you need to open the incision with them: and let the incision be according to the quantity, as far as is possible, so that an egg may come out of it.
Deinde excoria siphak, et quae sunt sub cute testiculorum, donec quando detegitur sifach album, durum ab omni parte: tunc intromitte digitum tuum indicem in eo quod sequitur testiculum, in eo quod est inter siphach album, quod est sub cute oui, et inter sifach secundum, et absolue cum eo adhaerentiam quae est in posteriori parte oui.	Then scrape the spermatic cord and what is under the skin of the testicles until when it reveals a white, hard scrotum from all parts: then introduce your index finger into what follows the testicle, into what is between the white scrotum, which is under the skin, and the second scrotum, and separate with it the adhesion which is in the posterior part.
Deinde moue cum manu dextra ad interiora cutem testiculorum: et cum hoc extende sifach album ad sursum, cum manu sinistra: et eleua ouum cum sifach ad partem sectionis: et praecipe ministro, ut extendat ouum ad sursum: et tu solue adhaerentiam, quae est retro solutione completa.	Then move with your right hand to the interior of the skin of the testicles: and with this extend the white cloth upward, with your left hand: and elevate the testicle with the cloth to the part of the section: and order the assistant to extend the testicle upwards: and you dissolve the adhesion, which is behind complete solution.
Et quaere digitis tuis, ut non sit aliquid illic ex intestino inuoluto in sifach albo duro.	And search with your fingers so that there is nothing there from the intestine rolled up in the white hard cloth.
Si autem inuenis ex eo aliquid: tunc impelle ipsum ad uentrem inferius.	If you find anything from it, then drive it down to the lower belly.
Deinde accipe acum, in qua sit filum grossum, factum licinium ex decem filis: et intromitte ipsam apud postremum sifach, id est, tunicae, quod est sub cute testiculorum quae sequitur sectionem: deinde incide extremitates quae eminent ex filo, donec sint quatuor fila.	Then take a needle with a thick string made of ten threads: and introduce it into the last sifach, that is, the tunic which is under the skin of the testicles which follows the section: then cut the extremities which protrude from the thread until there are four threads.
Deinde compone quaedam eorum super quaedam cum figura quae sit in modo crucis: et liga cum eis alsifach, de quo diximus, quia est sub cute testiculorum ligamento uehementi, donec non possit aliquod ex uasis, quae nutriunt eos mittere ad eos aliquid: ut non accidat inde apostema calidum.	Then arrange some of them over some with a figure in the shape of a cross: and tie them with alsifach, which we said before, because it is under the skin ligament of the testicles, firmly, until no part of the vessels, which nourish them can send anything to them; so that a hot abscess does not occur from there.
Et pone iterum ligamentum secundum extra ligamentum primum, longinquum ab eo minus duobus digitis.	And place again the ligament second outside the first ligament, long from it by less than two fingers.
Et post ista duo ligamenta dimitte ex sifach, quod est sub cute testiculorum, quantitatem magnitudinis digiti: et incide reliquum totum secundum rotunditatem, et aufer ex eo ouum.	And after these two ligaments are let go from the siphash, which is under the skin of the testicles, the quantity of the size of a finger: and cut the rest all according to the roundness, and take out from it the ovum.
Deinde seca in inferiori parte cutis testiculorum sectione, ex qua currit sanguis, et sanies: sicut narrauimus in eo quod praemissum est.	Then dry in the lower part of the skin of the testicles make a cut from which blood and pus run, as we have said before.
Deinde administra lanam submersam in oleo, et pone in uulnus: et administra ligamentum quod narrauimus.	Then administer wool soaked in oil, and place it in the wound: and administer the bandage that we have mentioned.
Et quandoque cauterizatur sifach album quod diximus, post incisionem eius timendo de fluxu sanguinis.	And sometimes a white lead (sifach) which we have mentioned is cauterized after its incision, fearing a flow of blood.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	It often happens.
Et dimitte ligamentum, donec cadat per se.	And let the ligament be loosened until it falls of itself.
Si autem tardatur casus eius, tunc embrocetur cum aqua calida: et pone super ipsum illud quod diximus, donec cadat.	If, however, his case is delayed, then it will be rinsed with hot water: and put on top of it what we have said, until it falls.
Deinde cura uulnus cum reliqua curatione uulnerum, donec curetur.	Then care for the wound with the rest of wound care, until it is healed.
¶ De Ramice uentosa.	On the Windpipe.
Caput LXVI.	Chapter LXVI.
IN Hac Ramice non uidi aliquem qui ausus fuerit super curationem eius cum ferro.	In this treatise I have not seen anyone who has dared to treat it with iron.
Et primi quidem dixerunt, quod fit sicut narrauimus in Ramice quae est cum Vite.	And first of all they said that it is done as we narrated in the Rue which is with the Vine.
Quod est, ut liges uasa post sectionem super ea cum facilitate inferius: deinde seca in medio, et cura postremo cum eo quod aperit ipsum, donec cadant uasa: et cura uulnus, secundum quod diximus, donec sanetur.	That is, as you bind the bowels after incision over them with ease below: then dry in the middle, and care lastly with that which opens it, until the bowels fall. And care for the wound, according to what we said, until it is healed.
¶ De disruptione quae fit in inguinibus.	On rupture that occurs in the groin.
Caput LXVII.	Chapter LXIV.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, sicut diximus, et eminet locus, et non descendit ad testiculos aliquid ex intestinis: et si descendit, est illud parum, et redit in omnibus horis: uerum si prolongatur cum ea tempus, additur fissura in sifach, donec descendunt intestina in sifach.	When a rupture occurs in the groin, as we have said, and the place is prominent and nothing from the intestines descends to the testicles; and if it does descend, it is small, and returns every hour; but if it is prolonged with it for a time, a fissure is added in the sifach until the intestines descend into the sifach.
Et accidit illud ex extensione sifach, quod est in inguinibus, sicut diximus.	And this happens from extension of the sifach, which is in the groin, as we have said.
Quod est, quia extenditur sifach: deinde mollificatur, et apostematur locus, et eminet.	That is because it extends; then it softens, and the place becomes pus-filled and prominent.
Et cura eius est cum cauterio, sicut praecessit eius narratio.	And its treatment is with a cautery, as its narrative preceding this has stated.
Et quandoque curatur cum ferro, secundum hunc modum: et est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum inter manus tuas.	And sometimes it is treated with iron, according to this method: and let the sick person lie on his back between your hands.
Deinde seca locum Rupturae apostematum et eminentem, sectione per latitudinem, secundum quantitatem trium digitorum.	Then dry the place of rupture and abscesses and prominent, with a cut across, according to the quantity of three fingers.
Deinde stringe alsifak et, quae sunt sub cute, donec quando detegitur sifach album, quod est sub cute quae sequitur ipsum.	Then tighten the alsifak and, which are under the skin, until when the white sifach is revealed, which is under the skin that follows it.
Tunc accipe radium, et pone ipsum super locum eminentem ex sifach, et preme ipsum ad profundum uentris.	Then take a probe and place it on the prominent spot from the scrotum and press it deep into the belly.
Deinde sue duo loca eminentia super extremitatem radii ex sifach, et annecte cum sutura unum eorum cum altero: deinde extrahe extremitatem radii.	Then sew the two prominent places above the extremity of the radius from the sifach, and connect one with the other with a suture; then extract the extremity of the radius.
Et non incidas alsifach omnino, neque tendas ouum, neque aliud, sicut feci te scire in curatione ramicis intestinalis.	And do not cut the omentum at all, nor pull the intestine, nor anything else, as I have taught you to do in the treatment of a rupture of the intestine.
Deinde cura illud curatione uulnerum.	Then comes the care of wounds.
Cum ergo incidis fila, mundifica illud, et restaura uulnus, donec consolidetur.	When therefore you cut the threads, cleanse it, and restore the wound until it solidifies.
Sisach enim contrahitur, et non additur eminentia Rupturae.	If the wound is contracted, and there is no prominence of the rupture.
Et cauterium est melius in hoc loco: quoniam est propinquius ad salutem.	And a cautery is better in this place; because it is nearer to health.
¶ De mollificatione cutis testiculorum.	On softening the skin of the testicles.
Caput LXVIII.	Chapter LXVIII.
Multotiens mollificatur cutis testiculorum in quibusdam hominibus, propter quod mollificantur carnes quae sunt inter ea, et foedatur aspectus eius.	Many times the skin of the testicles is softened in some men, because of which the flesh which is between them is softened, and its appearance is defiled.
Ergo necesse est ei qui rogatur in curatione eius, ut faciat iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et incidat totam cutem quae mollificata est super cutem naturalem.	Therefore it is necessary for him who is asked to cure this, that he make the sick person lie upon his back, and cut the whole skin which has been softened over the natural skin.
Deinde aggreget duo labia cum sutura: et si uis, sue in primis superfluitatem cutis mollificatae tribus suturis, aut quatuor, et firma suturam.	Then he will bring together the two lips with suture: and if you wish, sew in the first place the excess of softened skin with three sutures, or four, and a firm suture.
Deinde incide inter sututuras.	Then cut between the sutures.
Deinde cura curatione reliquorum uulnerum, usquequo sanetur, et cadant fila.	Then care for the healing of the remaining wounds, until they heal, and the threads fall away.
¶ De Castratione.	On Castration.
Caput LXIX.	Chapter LIX.
Scias, quod Castratio in lege nostra excommunicata est: et propter illud liceret mihi, ut non rememorarer eius in libro meo isto: et non est necessaria rememoratio eius, nisi propter duos modos.	Know that castration is forbidden in our law: and for this reason it was permitted to me not to remember it in my book; and it is not necessary to remember it, except for two modes.
Quorum unus est, ut sit illud in scientia medici quando interrogatur de ea: et ut sciat curationem eius cui accidit.	One of these is that it should be in the knowledge of a physician when he is asked about it: and that he may know the cure of him who has it.
Et modus alter est, quod nos multotiens indigemus castratione quorundam animalium, propter iuuamenta nostra per illud, sicut arietum, hyrcorum, et gattorum, et similium ex animalibus.	And another method is that we often need the castration of certain animals for our benefit, such as rams, goats, and cats, and similar animals.
Dico ergo, quod Castratio fit secundum duos modos.	Therefore I say that castration is done in two ways.
Aut per attritionem.	Or through rubbing.
Aut per fissuram, et sectionem.	Either through a fissure, and section.
In illa autem quae fit per attritionem, uia operationis est: quod nos faciamus sedere animal in aqua calida, donec mollificentur testiculi eius, et leniantur, et pendeant: deinde attere eos manu tua, donec resoluantur et non appareant sub tactu.	In that which is done by friction, the way of operation is: that we make the animal sit in hot water until its testicles soften and become pliable and hang down; then rub them with your hand until they dissolve and do not appear under touch.
In castratione autem per fissuram et sectionem, oportet ut teneas animal, et premas cutem testiculorum eius cum manu sinistra.	In castration by a slit and incision, it is necessary to hold the animal and press the skin of its testicles with the left hand.
Deinde liga suspensorium, et seca super omne ouum sectione una, donec quando procedunt duo oua: tunc incide ea postquam excoriaueris utrumque, et non dimittas super ea ex sifaket aliquid praeter sifac subtile, quod est super uasa.	Then bind the suspensory ligament, and cut above all the egg with one section, until when two eggs proceed: then cut them after you have scraped both, and do not let anything be placed over them except a fine plaster, which is over the vessels.
Et iste modus castrationis est melior eo qui fit per attritonem: quoniam attritio fortasse relinquit aliquid ex testiculis, quare desiderat animal coitum.	And this way of castration is better because it is done by attrition: for perhaps attrition leaves something of the testicles, wherefore the animal desires copulation.
Deinde cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Then care for the wound until it heals.
¶ De cura Hermafroditae duorum modorum.	On the treatment of a hermaphrodite in two ways.
Caput LXX.	Chapter LXX.
Hermafrodita ex uiris est secundum duos modos.	A hermaphrodite is from males according to two modes.
Vnus eorum est, quia apparet in eo quod sequitur spacium, aut in cute testiculorum, in eo quod est inter duos testiculos, figura quasi uulua mulieris, in qua sunt pili: et quandoque currit urina ex eo quod est in cute testiculorum.	One of them is because it appears where the following space is, or in the skin of the testicles, where there is between two testicles, a figure like a woman's vulva, which has hair: and sometimes urine flows from that which is in the skin of the testicles.
In mulieribus autem est species una, et est uulua mulieris super pectinem sicut testiculi uiri parui omnino, eminentes ad exteriora: quorum unus est sicut priapus uiri, et duo sicut duo testiculi.	In women there is one kind, and it is the vulva of a woman above the comb like small testicles of a man, protruding to the outside: of which one is like the priapus of a man, and two like two testicles.
Et curatio trium specierum, duarum ex uiris, et speciei unius ex mulieribus, est: quia oportet ut incidas carnes additas, donec effugiat impressio earum.	And the cure of three kinds, two from men, and one kind from women, is: because it is necessary that you cut the added flesh until the impression of it escapes.
Deinde cura eas curatione reliquorum uulnerum.	Then care for the wounds remaining to be healed.
In specie autem secunda uirorum, ex qua egreditur urina, quae est in cute testiculorum, non est operatio, neque est eius curatio omnino.	In the second kind of men, from which urine comes forth, which is in the skin of the testicles, there is no operation, nor is there any cure at all.
¶ De incisione Tentiginis, et carnis eminentis in uuluis mulierum.	On the incision of the labium majus and the protruding flesh in all women.
Caput LXXI.	Chapter LXXI.
Tentigo fortasse additur super rem naturalem, donec foedatur et turpis fit aspectus eius: et quandoque magnificatur in quibusdam mulieribus adeo, donec expanditur sicut in uiris, et peruenit usque ad coitum.	It is possible that a protrusion is added above the natural thing, until it becomes soiled and ugly in appearance; and sometimes it is magnified in some women to such an extent that it expands like in men, and comes even to the point of intercourse.
Oportet ergo ut teneas superfluitatem Tentiginis manu, aut cum uncino, et incidas: et non ultimes in incisione, praecipue in profundo radicis: ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Therefore you ought to hold the superfluity of tissue with your hand, or with a hook, and make an incision; and do not reach the end of the incision, especially in the deep part of the root, lest blood flow occurs.
Deinde cura ipsam curatione uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then care for the wound itself, until it is healed.
Caro autem orta, est caro quae nascitur in orificio matricis, donec impleat ipsum: et fortasse egreditur ad exteriora secundum similitudinem caudae: et propter illud quidam primi nominant aegritudinem caudatam.	Flesh that has grown is flesh that is born in the opening of the womb until it fills it, and perhaps it emerges to the outside according to the likeness of a tail. And because of this some first call the ailment "tailed.
Oportet ergo ut incidamus eam sicut incidimus Tentiginem, et curemus eam, donec sanetur.	Therefore we ought to cut it as we cut a hernia, and treat it until it heals.
¶ De cura Alratica, quae est uulua mulieris non perforata.	On the treatment of Al-Ratica, which is a woman's fistula that is not perforated.
Caput LXXII.	Chapter LXXII.
Alratica est, ut sit uulua mulieris non perforata, aut sit foramen paruum.	The vulva of a woman should be unperforated or have a small opening.
Et est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	And it is either natural or accidental.
Accidentalis est ex aegritudine quae praecessit: et ipsa quidem fit aut ex carne nata addita, aut sifach subtili, aut spisso: et fit aut in profundo matricis, aut in lateribus eius, aut in superiore ipsius, aut inferiori eius: et prohibet a coitu et impregnatione, et partu, et fortasse prohibet menstrua.	An accident occurs from illness that precedes it; and indeed it happens either from flesh added naturally, or pus fine or thick; and it happens either in the depth of the womb, or on its sides, or on its upper part, or lower part; and it forbids intercourse and impregnation, and childbirth, and perhaps it forbids menstruation.
Et cognitio illius fit per aspectum obstetricis, si opilatio est apparens propinqua.	And its knowledge is made by the appearance of the midwife, if pregnancy is apparent near.
Si autem non est apparens, tunc quaere eam digitis tuis, aut cum radio.	If it is not apparent, then seek it with your fingers, or with a rod.
Si autem opilatio est ex sifach subtili, et est propinqua duobus labiis: tunc propera, et disrumpe ipsam.	If the swelling is from a superficial abscess and is close to both lips, then hasten, and rupture it.
Et est, ut ponas super duo labia puluillos.	And it is, as you place little balls upon the two lips.
Deinde pone indices tuos duarum manuum simul, et mulier sit super dorsum suum expansis cruribus suis.	Then place your fingers of both hands together, and let the woman lie on her back with her legs spread wide.
Deinde extende duo labia cum fortitudine, donec disrumpatur sifach subtile, et aperiatur opilatio.	Then extend the two lips with force until the subtle siphon is torn apart and the opening is revealed.
Deinde accipe lanam, et imbibe eam in oleo, et pone ipsam super locum: et coeat mulier omni die, ut non consolidetur locus uice alia.	Then take wool and soak it in oil, and place it over the area: and let the woman every day, so that the place does not congeal with another vice.
Si autem sifach est grossum, spissum: tunc oportet ut seces ipsum cum spatumili lato simili folio myrti.	If however the  sifac is thick and coarse: then it is necessary to cut it with a spatula broad similar to a myrtle leaf.
Si autem opilatio est ex carne nata, tunc suspende eam cum uncinis, et incide eam: et sint tecum medicinae quae fluxum sedant sanguinis absque mordicatione, sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus aggregatum cum albugine oui.	If the wound is from flesh, then suspend it with hooks and cut into it: and have with you medicinal agents that will stop the flow of blood without biting, such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and also a mixture with egg white.
Deinde administra cannulam ex plumbo amplam, ut non consolidetur uulnus uelociter, teneat eam diebus aliquot: et administra licinium ex lino sicco, deinde curetur reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then administer a lead pipe wide, so that the wound does not close quickly, hold it for several days; and administer linen from dry flax, then care for the rest of the cure, until it heals.
Et quandoque nasciur in matrice natiuitas carnium aliarum: oportet ergo ut incidantur secundum hunc modum: dum non est apostema cancerosum apostemati enim canceroso quod est in matrice, non fiat contrarietas cum ferro omnino.	And sometimes a birth of flesh occurs in the womb. It is therefore necessary that it be cut according to this method: as long as there is no cancerous ulcer, for a cancerous ulcer which is in the womb should not be opposed with iron at all.
¶ De cura hemorroidarum, Athehelil, et Bothor rubeae in uuluis mulierum.	On the treatment of hemorrhoids, Athihelil, and the redness of the vulva in women.
Caput LXXIII.	Chapter Seventy-Third.
Hemorroides quidem sunt apertio orificiorum uenarum, donec currit ex eis sanguis multus assidue.	Hemorrhoids indeed are an opening of the veins' mouths, so that much blood runs continually from them.
Cum ergo antiquantur hemorroides, fiunt thelil: et iam dixi in diuisione species earum, et signa ipsarum: et dicam hic quae ex eis recipiunt curationem, et quae non.	When hemorrhoids are old, they become piles: and I have already said in the division of their kinds, and signs of them: and I shall say here what remedies they receive from them, and what they do not.
Dico ergo, quod hemorroides quae sunt in orificio matricis, et non apparent sensui: tunc non est ei curatio cum ferro.	Therefore I say that hemorrhoids which are in the opening of the womb, and do not appear to the sense, then there is no cure for them with iron.
Quae autem ex eis sunt in orificio matricis super quas cadit sensus, sunt quae curantur.	Those which are within the opening of the womb over which the sense falls are those that are cured.
Oportet ergo ut intromittas mulierem in domum frigidam.	Therefore, it is necessary that you introduce the woman into a cold house.
Deinde extende athehelil cum forficibus, aut cum panno aspero, et incide eas ex radicibus suis.	Then extend the atheril with forceps, or with a rough cloth, and cut it from its roots.
Deinde pulueriza super eas apud fluxum sanguinis ex uno puluerum incisiuorum absque mordificatione: sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus, et similia eis.	Then pulverize upon them at the flow of blood from one powder of incisions without corruption: such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and so on, and things similar to these.
Deinde impellat pedes eius ad parietem hora una.	Then he shall drive his feet against the wall for one hour.
Postea depone eam in aquam frigidam.	Afterwards place it in cold water.
Quod si perseuerat fluxus sanguinis: tunc fac eam sedere in decoctione sumach, et corticum granatorum, et gallarum, et similium.	If the bleeding persisted, then make her sit in a decoction of sumac, and bark of pomegranate, and roosters, and similar things.
Deinde accipe farinam hordei, et confice eam cum melle et aceto, et fac emplastrum cum eo super dorsum eius.	Then take barley flour and mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a poultice with it on his back.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis cum eo, bonum est: et si non, fac adhaerere dorso uentosas, et mammillis, absque scarificatione.	If blood is cut with it, that is good: and if not, make it adhere to the back with sponges, and pads, without scraping.
Deinde accipe lanam, et submerge in succo tarathit, aut succo arnoglossae, aut succo ramorum alaulat, id est, aglanter, uino pontico, et fac adhaerere loeo.	Then take wool and immerse it in the juice of tharadith, or the juice of arnoglossa, or the juice of alaulat branches, that is, aglantar, Pontic wine, and make it adhere to the lion's mane.
Cum ergo quiescit apostema, tunc cura locum cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	When therefore the abscess rests, then care for the place with ointment until it heals.
Albarth uero rubeum est simile capitibus alhaasse, et est asperi aspectus.	Albarth and red is similar to heads of alhaasse, and is rough in appearance.
Oportet ergo ut incidas quod apparet ex eo, secundum quod dixi in thelil aequaliter: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Therefore, you should cut what appears from it, according to what I said in the previous point equally: and take care of it until it heals.
¶ De perforatione Exiturae quae accidit in matrice.	Of the piercing of the Extirations which occurs in the womb.
Caput LXXIIII.	Chapter LXXIV.
Accidunt in matrice species multae apostematum, sicut cancer, et apostema lapideum, et ulcera, et adubelati, et alekilati, id est, herpes, aestiomemus, et fistulae, et hemorroides, et ragadiae, et thelil, et apostema calidum.	Many kinds of abscesses occur in the womb, such as cancer, and stone abscesses, and ulcers, and buboes, and blisters, that is, herpes, aestiomemus, and fistulas, and hemorrhoids, and ragadiae, and thelil, and hot abscess.
Et ego quidem iam dixi omnes has aegritudines et species earum, et signa ipsarum, et earum curationes in diuisione: necesse est ut dicam in hoc tractatu apostema calidum quod accidit in matrice, quando est ex apostematibus quae colligunt saniem, et uis scire qualiter fit eius apertio cum ferro.	And I have indeed already said all these ailments and their kinds, and their signs, and their cures in the division: it is necessary that I say in this treatise about a hot abscess which happens in the womb, when it is from abscesses which collect pus, and you wish to know how its opening is made with iron.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	Therefore, it is necessary that you consider.
Tunc si dolor apostematis in incaeptione sua est acutus cum percussione sua, et flamma, et febre: et uides ipsum rubere: si cadit super ipsum sensus, tunc non properes cum perforatione eius: et cura ipsum cum eo eo quod iuuat super maturationem, donec quando quiescat acuitas accidentium.	Then if the pain of an abscess in its beginning is acute with percussion, and heat, and fever: and you see it red: if sensation falls upon it, then do not hasten with its perforation: and care for it with that which helps on maturation, until when the sharpness of accidents rests.
Tunc oportet ut facias sedere mulierem super sedem quae labeat duo sedilia, et reclinetur, uel appodietur super dorsum suum, et aggreget pedes suos ad partem inferiorem uentris: et sint coxae eius expansae, et ponat brachia sua sub genibus suis, et liget utraque ligamento conueniente ad illud.	Then it is necessary that you make the woman sit upon a seat which has two seats, and recline, or lean back upon her back, and bring her feet to the lower part of the belly: and let her hips be spread, and put her arms under her knees, and bind each one with a suitable bandage.
Deinde sedeat obstetrix a latere dextro, et administra instrumentum quo aperitur orificium matricis.	Then let the midwife sit at the right side and administer the instrument which opens the orifice of the womb.
Cuius forma uenit in eis quae sunt post.	Whose form comes in those which are after.
Et oportet quando uis administrare hoc instrumentum, ut figas cum Radio profundum matricis mulieris: ut non sit illud quod ingreditur ex instrumento plus, quam profundum matricis, et laedat infirmam.	And it is necessary when you wish to administer this instrument, that you fasten with a rod the deep part of the womb of the woman; so that what enters from the instrument be not more than the depth of the womb, and harm the weak one.
Si autem fuerit instrumentum magis quam profundum, tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos super tecturam profundi matricis: ut prohibeatur introitus instrumenti totius in profundum matricis: et oportet ut ponat uertiginem, quae currit in instrumento, ex latere superiore: et ut teneat instrumentum, et ut reuoluat minister uertiginem, donec aperiatur profundum matricis.	If the instrument is more than deep, then you should place pads on the roof of the deep uterus so that the entrance of the whole instrument into the deep uterus is prevented: and you should place a winding, which runs in the instrument, from the upper side: and so that it holds the instrument, and so that the minister revolves the winding until the deep uterus is opened.
Cum ergo apparet Exitura, et tangitur manu, et est lenis et mollis: tunc oportet ut seces ipsam apud caput suum cum spatumili lato.	When therefore it appears as a protrusion, and is touched by hand, and is soft and pliable: then it is necessary that one should cut it at its head with a broad spatula.
Cum ergo euacuatur sanies, tunc oportet ut ponas in uulnus licinium submersum in oleo rosaceo: aut oleo uiridi, in quo sit quaedam stipticitas: et pone licinium, et extrahe sectionem in profundo matricis.	When the pus has been evacuated, then it is necessary to place a linen pad submerged in rose oil in the wound; or green oil, which has some astringency. And place the pad, and withdraw the section deep into the matrix.
Et pone exterius super matricem, et super pectinem lanam mundam submersam in aqua, in qua bullitae sunt maluae.	And place the exterior over the matrix, and over the wool comb submerged in water, in which mallows have been boiled.
Deinde curetur post duos dies cum unguento quod conuenit ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then it is treated after two days with ointment which is fitting for it, until it heals.
Et quandoque abluitur matrix et uulnus, ita quod clisterizatur cum aqua et melle: deinde cum aqua in qua bullita est radix lilii, aut aristolochia longa: deinde redeat ad unguentum.	And sometimes the womb and wound are washed so that it is clystered with water and honey; then with water in which lily root or long asarabacca has been boiled; then return to ointment.
Quod si uulnus absconditum fuerit interius in matrice, tunc oportet ut prohibearis ex curatione eius cum ferro, imo cura ipsum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione.	If a wound is hidden inside the womb, then it is necessary to prevent its healing with iron, rather care for it with what we have said in the division.
¶ Doctrinae Obstetricum, qualiter medicentur embriones uiui, secundum figuram non naturalem egressi.	The doctrines of obstetrics, how to treat embryos living, according to the unnatural figure.
Caput Lxxu.	Chapter LXXI.
Necesse est Obstetrici, ut cognoscat in primis figuram partus naturalis.	It is necessary for an obstetrician to know first of all the form of a natural birth.
Ex signis ergo eius est, quod quando uides mulierem comprimi ad inferiora, et desiderat odorare aerem, et alleuiatur super eam quod super ipsam est de partu, et festinat exitus embrionis: tunc scias quod iste partus est secundum figuram naturalem, et est exitus eius super caput suum, et secundina cum eo: aut suspensa, uel pendens ex umbilico.	Therefore, from these signs you will know that when you see a woman pressing down below, and she desires to smell the air, and is lifted up above her which is on her from childbirth, and hastens the exit of the embryo: then you will know that this birth is according to the natural figure, and its exit is above its head, and secondary with it; or suspended, or hanging from the navel.
Cum ergo uides haec signa, tunc oportet ut comprimatur uenter eius, ut descendat embrio uelociter.	When therefore you see these signs, then it is necessary that the belly be compressed so that the embryo may descend quickly.
Nam quando descendit super caput suum, descendit secundina cum eo, et mundatur ex illis superfluitatibus mundificatione bona.	For when he lowers himself over his head, he lowers secondarily with him, and he is cleansed from those superfluities by a good cleansing.
Qui autem est praeter hunc partum, est innaturalis, illaudabilis.	Whoever is beyond this birth, is unnatural, blameworthy.
Quoniam quandoque egreditur foetus super pedes suos, et egreditur corpus eius ante caput ipsius, et pedes eius, et manus eius una, aut pes eius unus: aut egreditur caput eius et manus eius: aut egreditur uentrinus: et fortasse conuertitur super collum suum, et similia ex figuris illaudabilibus.	Because sometimes the fetus emerges on its feet, and its body emerges before its head, and one of its feet, and one of its hands, or sometimes only its head and hand emerge; or perhaps it emerges with its belly, and similar things from these praiseworthy figures.
Necesse est ergo Obstetrici, ut sit prudens, subtilis in istis rebus omnibus, et caueat sibi ab errore et decaeptione: et ego sum ostendens omnem figuram ex eis, et qualiter est ingenium in ea, et significetur per illud, et stetur super ipsum.	Therefore, it is necessary for the midwife to be prudent, subtle in all these things, and to guard herself from error and failure: and I am showing every figure of them, and how the ingenuity is in each, and shall be signified by that, and shall stand upon it.
Quando egreditur foetus super caput suum egressione sua naturali, et uehemens fit illud super mulierem, et difficilis fit ei partus, et uides uirtutem eius iam debilitatam: tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, aut mulieres teneant eam: et uapora uuluam eius cum foenugraeco decocto, et cum oleis humidis.	When the fetus emerges from the head during its natural birth, and it becomes forceful against the woman, and childbirth becomes difficult for her, and you see that her strength is already weakened: then make her sit upon a seat, or let women hold her; and apply vapors of wool of her vulva with boiled fennel, and with humid oils.
Deinde intromittat Obstetrix inter digitos suos Spatumile paruum, et findat cum eo secundinam, et secet eam ungue suo, donec currat quod est in ea ex humiditate: et preme uentrem mulieris, donec descendat foetus.	Then the midwife shall insert between her fingers a small spatula, and find with it the second one, and cut it with her nail until it runs which is in it of moisture; and press the woman’s belly until the fetus descends.
Si autem non descendit, tunc oportet ut clisterizetur mulier ex mucillagine foenugraeci, cum oleo sisamino.	If it does not descend, then a woman must be given an enema of fig seed with sesame oil.
Deinde praecipe ei post clistere, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi, et tene os eius et nasum ipsius hora una.	Then command him after an enema that he be compressed: and make him sneeze with the condiment, and hold his mouth and nose for one hour.
Foetus enim egredietur statim.	For the fetus will immediately emerge.
Quod si egrediantur duae manus foetus in primis, iunc oportet ut reducas eas cum facilitate paulatim.	If two hands of the fetus come out first, it is necessary that you join them together so that you may gradually reduce them with ease.
Si autem non obedit in introitu, tunc pone mulierem super sedem, et eleua pedes eius sursum: deinde concute sedem super terram: et mulier teneatur, ut non cadat apud concussionem.	If it does not yield on entry, then place the woman upon a seat and elevate her feet upwards: then strike the seat against the ground: and let the woman be held so that she does not fall during the concussion.
Si ergo non egrediuntur manus, et moritur foetus: tunc incide eas, et extrahe residuum foetus: et liga manum eius cum panno, et extrahe ipsum cum aequalitate: nam ipse egredietur.	If therefore the hands do not come out, and the fetus dies: then cut them open, and remove the remainder of the fetus: and tie its hand with a cloth, and draw it out with equality; for itself will come out.
¶ Exitus embrionis super pedes suo.	The exit of the embryo from the feet of its mother.
Quando egreditur foetus super pedes suos, tunc oportet ut impellat eos sursum: deinde conuertat foetum paulatim: postea aequet ipsum.	When the fetus comes out on its feet, then it is necessary to push them upward; then turn the fetus gradually; afterward make it even.
Deinde accipiat unum pedum eius, et extendat eum paulatim.	Then he shall take one of his feet and gradually extend it.
Cum ergo egrediuntur usque ad coxas, tunc praecipe ei, ut comprimatur, et fac eam sternutare cum condisi: egredietur enim, si Deus uoluerit.	When they emerge as far as the hips, then order him to be compressed, and make him sneeze with condiments: for he will emerge, if God wills.
Et si non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc reduc foetum paulatim, donec ponas eum secundum figuram naturalem.	And if it does not come out as we have described, then gradually reduce the fetus until you place it according to its natural form.
Nam ipse egredietur tunc egressu facili.	For then he will exit with easier passage.
Quod si prohibeatur cum eo toto quod narrauimus: tunc accipe ex mucillagine alteae, et oleo sisamino, et gummi soluto: et percute totum in mortario percussione bona: deinde line cum eo uuluam mulieris, et inferius uentris eius.	If that which we have recounted is prohibited, then take from the mucilage of aloe, and sesame oil, and gum dissolved: and pound the whole in a mortar with good percussion; then apply it to the vulva of a woman, and below her belly.
Deinde fac eam sedere in aqua tepida, donec consequatur hypocundria.	Then make her sit in lukewarm water until she obtains a lower backache.
Cum ergo uides quod iam calefacta sunt inferiora eius, tunc fac ei sief de myrrha: et suppone ipsum.	When therefore you see that the lower parts are already heated, then make for him a salve of myrrh: and apply it to him.
Quando ergo tenet sief hora una, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	When therefore he holds the knife one hour, then make him sit upon a seat.
Deinde fac eam sternutare: et stringe ipsius os et nasum: et preme inferiorem partem uentris compressione facili.	Then make him sneeze: and hold shut his mouth and nose: and press the lower part of the belly with easy compression.
Nam foeus egredietur statim.	For the abscess will burst at once.
¶ Exitus foetus super genua et manus.	The exit of the fetus above the knees and hands.
Quando egreditur secundum hanc formam, tunc ingeniet in intromittendo manus suas paulatim.	When it comes out according to this form, then one will be able to put his hands into it gradually.
Deinde resupinetur mulier super collum suum, et pendeant pedes eius ad inferiora: et ipsa sit iacens super lectum, et complicet manus suas.	Then she is laid back on her neck, and her feet hang down to the lower part; and she lies on a bed, and clasps her hands.
Deinde preme supra uentrem eius paulatim.	Then press upon his belly gradually.
Deinde extrahe quod est sub pedibus eius ex puluinaribus, donec sit praeparata in inferiori parte.	Then extract what is under his feet from the dust, until it is prepared in the lower part.
Quod si non egreditur foetus, tunc accipe pedes eius, et moue eos motu uehementi.	If the fetus does not emerge, then take its feet and move them with a strong motion.
Deinde preme quod est supra hypocundria paulatim, donec ascendat foetus ad superiora.	Then press what is above the hypogastrium gradually until the fetus ascends to the upper regions.
Deinde intromittat manus suas, et aequet foetum paulatim: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimatur, donec egrediatur foetus.	Then he will insert his hands and gradually bring out the fetus; and instruct the woman to press until the fetus emerges.
¶ Exitus foetus latitudinaliter pendens ex manibus.	The fetus hangs lengthwise from the hands.
Ingenietur in reductione manus eius.	He will invent in the reduction of the hand.
Si autem non potest reducere eam, tunc eleua mulierem, et fac eam ambulare.	If he cannot reduce it, then raise the woman up, and make her walk about.
Si uero ambulare non potest, tunc fac eam iacere super lectum: et concute crura eius concussione uehementi.	If he cannot walk, then make him lie on a bed: and shake his legs with a vigorous shaking.
Deinde administra linimentum quod praeparasti ex mucillaginibus.	Then administer the liniment which you have prepared from gums.
Quod si accipit eam partus, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	If she receives it in childbirth, then make her sit upon a seat.
Deinde stude in reductione manus, et aequa foetum secundum figuram naturalem: et fac sternutare mulierem, et praecipe ei, ut comprimat se, donec egrediatur.	Then study in reducing the hand, and equalize the fetus according to its natural shape: and make her sneeze, and command her to press herself until it comes out.
¶ Exitus foetus super collum suum, expansis manibus, et est facies eius ad dorsum matris suae.	The fetus exits through the neck of its mother, with outstretched hands, and its face is toward the back of its mother.
Oportet ut teneat Obstetrix manum foetus, deinde reuoluat eum paulatim, et aequet eum cum facilitate.	The midwife must hold the fetus in her hand, then turn it gradually and align it with ease.
Cum ergo aequatur, tunc pone super uuluam eius quod narrauimus ex oleo et mucillaginibus.	When therefore it is made equal, then place upon its surface what we have narrated from oil and mucus.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut moueatur paulatim.	Then command him to be moved gradually.
Cum ergo feceris illud, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, et praecipe ei ut inclinetur ad latus dextrum.	When therefore you have done that, then make her sit upon a seat, and command her to incline to the right side.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi.	Then order him to press it; and make him sneeze with condiments.
¶ Exitus foetus praeparati super latus.	The prepared fetus is laid upon its side.
Quando descendit ad orificium matricis secundum hunc modum cum secundina, tunc scinde secundinam cum ungue tuo, donec euacuetur ex humiditate.	When it descends to the opening of the womb in this way with a sponge, then split the sponge with your finger until it is emptied of moisture.
Si ergo suspenditur super faciem foetus, et collum eius, tunc incide eam ex umbilico: ut non retineatur, et moriatur.	If therefore it is suspended over the face of the fetus, and its neck, then cut it from the navel: that it may not be retained, and die.
Deinde impelle foetum ad interiora, donec ponas eam secundum quod oportet: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimat se aliquotiens: ipse enim egredietur exitu leui.	Then drive the fetus into the insides until you place it as is necessary: and command the woman to compress herself several times: for he himself will come out through a light exit.
¶ Exitus Geminorum, aut foetuum multorum.	The exit of twins, or many fetuses.
Scias, quod Gemini multotiens nascuntur: et quandoque nascuntur tres, et quatuor.	Know that twins often are born; and sometimes three, and four.
Verumtamen illud extraneum est, et raro contingit.	However, this is foreign and rarely happens.
Quinque uero est res extra naturam, et non uiuunt penitus: et continet eos, quamuis multiplicentur, secundina una: et separantur per sifach, distinguens inter eos ligatum in umbilico cuiusque eorum.	There are five things outside nature and do not live entirely: and they contain them, although they multiply, according to one: and they are separated by a siphon, distinguishing between them the ligament tied at the navel of each of them.
Et quandoque egrediuntur sicut egreditur foetus unus exitu naturali, facili: et egrediuntur exitu illaudabili, sicut narrauimus.	And sometimes they emerge as one fetus emerges from the natural exit, easily; and they emerge from a praiseworthy exit, as we have narrated.
Quod si difficiles fuerint quidam eorum apud partum, et perueniunt ad illud quod diximus ex figuris innaturalibus, tunc cura eos sicut narrauimus: et sit ob stetrix subtilis, et faciat quod facit cum facilitate et tarditate, et ingenietur secundum omnem figuram cum eo quod praeparatur ei ex ingenio ducente ad salutem.	If some of these are difficult during labor and arrive at what we said from unnatural figures, then care for them as we have narrated: and let the midwife be subtle, and do what she does with ease and slowness, and devise according to every figure with that which is prepared for her from ingenious guidance to health.
¶ Rememoratio eius quod formatur in matrice ex embrionibus, et abortiuntur.	A reminder of how it is formed in the womb from embryos, and miscarriages occur.
Quandoque formatur in matrice unus, et duo, et tres, et quatuor, et quinque, et sex, et septem, et plures decem: et iam uerificatum est apud me, quod mulier abortiendo emisit septem, et alia quindecim, omnes formatos.	Sometimes one, and two, and three, and four, and five, and six, and seven, and more than ten are formed in the womb: and it has already been verified to me that a woman miscarrying emitted seven, and another fifteen, all formed.
Quod factum est mensuratione gloriosi sapientis.	That which was done by measurement of the glorious wise man.
Hoc ergo totum oportet ut sit in scientia Obstetricis.	Therefore, this whole thing ought to be in the science of Obstetrics.
Fortasse enim perueniet ad eam simile illius: opponat ergo ei cum illo quod oportet	Perhaps it will come to him similar to that: he should therefore oppose it with it as is necessary.
¶ De extractione foetus mortui.	On the extraction of a dead fetus.
Caput LXXVI.	Chapter LXXVI.
Quando curas foetum mortuum cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex medicatione, et non egreditur, et cogeris uti operatione cum manu, tunc oportet ut consideres.	When you treat a dead fetus with what I said in the division of medicine, and it does not come out, and you are forced to use surgery with your hand, then you must consider.
Si ergo mulier est sanae uirtutis, et non est cum aliquo ex accidentibus, ex quibus timetur super eam perditio: tunc oportet ut resupinetur mulier super lectum, super dorsum suum, et sit caput eius inclinatum inferius, et crura eius eleuata: et ministra teneat eam a duabus partibus, aut ligetur ad lectum, ut non extrahatur corpus eius apud extractionem foetus.	If therefore the woman is of sound virtue and is not with any of those things from which her destruction is feared; then it ought to be that the woman be laid upon the bed on her back, and her head be inclined downwards, and her legs elevated: and let the minister hold her by two parts, or fasten her to the bed, so that her body may not be drawn out during the extraction of the fetus.
Deinde humecta os matricis ex oleis humidis cum mucillagine alteae, et foenugraeci, et seminis lini.	Then moisten the bone of the uterus with oily humid substances along with althea gum, fennel seed, and flaxseed.
Deinde inungat Obstetrix manum suam cum istis oleis et mucillaginibus: deinde intromittat eam in matricem cum facilitate.	Then let the midwife anoint her hand with these oils and ointments, then introduce it into the uterus with ease.
Deinde quaerat cum ea locum in quo figat uncinos ex foetu, et loca conuenientia ad illud.	Then he will look for a place where he will set the hooks from the fetus, and places suitable for it.
Considera ergo tunc, si foetus est praeparatus ut descendat super caput suum: tunc fige uncinos in oculos eius, aut in collo eius, aut in ore eius, aut in palato ipsius, aut sub barba eius, aut in furcula ipsius, aut in locis propinquis costis, et sub hypocundriis.	Therefore consider then, if the fetus is prepared to descend upon its head: then fix hooks into its eyes, or on its neck, or in its mouth, or on its palate, or under its beard, or in its clavicle, or in places near the ribs, and under the hypogastrium.
Si autem descensus est super pedes eius, tunc in pectine, et costis eius mediis.	If however the descent is upon his feet, then in the hip bone and ribs of his middle.
Et oportet, ut teneat uncinum cum manu dextra: et ponat curuitatem eius in eo quod est inter digitos sinistrae manus: et intromittat cum manu cum facilitate, et figat uncinum in aliquo illorum locorum quae diximus, donec perueniat ad rem uacuam.	And it is necessary that he hold the hook with his right hand: and place its curve in that which is between the fingers of the left hand: and introduce it with his hand with facility, and fix the hook in one of those places which we have said, until he comes to the empty thing.
Deinde figat in oppositione eius uncinum alium, aut tertium, si indiges: ut sit contractio aequalis, et non declinet ad partem.	Then he will place another hook opposite it, or a third one if necessary, so that the contraction is equal and does not lean to one side.
Deinde extendatur extensione aequali, et non sit extensio secundum rectitudinem tantum, imo moueatur ad omnem partem, ut alleuietur exitus eius: sicut fit cum dente apud eradicationem eius.	Then it shall be extended by an equal extension, and not let the extension be according to straightness only, but rather be moved to every part, so that the exit may be relieved; just as is done with a tooth when it is being extracted.
Et oportet in eo quod est inter illud, ut mollificetur extensio.	And it is necessary that what is between them be made more flexible.
Quod si retineatur ex eo pars, tunc oportet ut inungat Obstetrix quosdam digitos cum oleo, et intromittat eos ex parte, ut reuoluat cum eis quod retinetur.	If a part is retained from that, then the midwife ought to anoint some fingers with oil and introduce them from the side so as to rotate what is held with them.
Si ergo egreditur pars foetus, tunc permutentur uncini ad locum alium qui sit altior: fac hoc donec egrediatur foetus totus.	If therefore a part of the fetus comes out, then change the hooks to another place which is higher: do this until the whole fetus emerges.
Si ergo egreditur manus ante alia, et non est possibile reducere eam, propter coartationem eius: tunc oportet, ut inuoluatur super eam pannus.	If therefore the hand comes out before other parts, and it is not possible to reduce it because of its constriction: then it is necessary that a cloth be wrapped over it.
Deinde extrahe eam donec quando egreditur tota, incide eam aut in iunctura plantae, aut in cubito: et ita oportet ut facias in manu altera, et in duobus pedibus.	Then extract it until the whole thing comes out, cut it either at the joint of the foot or in the elbow; and thus you must do with one hand, and with both feet.
Si autem caput foetus est magnum, aut accidit ei coartatio in exitu, aut est in capite eius aqua aggregata: tunc oportet ut intromittat inter digitos Spatumile spinosum, et findat cum eo caput, et extrahat aquam: aut disrumpat ipsum cum instrumento quod nominatur Almisdac: cuius forma uenit cum formis reliquorum instrumentorum in capitulo quod est post hoc.	If however the head of the fetus is large, or it has constriction at its exit, or there is water gathered in its head: then it is necessary that he insert between his fingers a pointed spatula, and find it with it and extract the water; or break it apart with an instrument called Almisdac: whose form comes with the forms of the other instruments in the chapter which is after this.
Similiter faciat si foetus est magni capitis natura, tunc oportet ut seces algengematu: aut extrahas ipsum cum misdach, sicut diximus.	Similarly, if the fetus has a large head, then it is necessary to cut open the birth canal; or extract it with forceps, as we have said.
Deinde attrahas ossa cum forcipibus.	Then draw out the bones with forceps.
Quod si egrediatur caput, et coartetur apud furculam: tunc findatur, donec effundatur humiditas quae est in pectore.	If the head comes out and is tied at the fork: then it should be sought until the moisture which is in the chest is discharged.
Si autem non complicatur, neque obedit ad exitum: tunc incide caput frustatim, secundum quod possibile est tibi.	If it does not complicate, nor obey an exit: then cut off the head piecemeal, according to what is possible for you.
Quod si inferius uentris est apostematum, aut est in eo hydropisis: tunc oportet ut perfores ipsum, donec currat humiditas ex eo.	If it is an abscess or hydrops in the lower abdomen, then it must be incised until the moisture drains from it.
Si uero foetus est super pedes suos, tunc attractio eius est facilis, et directio eius ad os matricis est leuis.	If however the fetus is on its feet, then its extraction is easy, and its direction to the mouth of the womb is light.
Si autem coartatur apud uentrem, aut pectus: tunc oportet ut extrahas ipsum cum panno quem inuoluisti super manum tuam: et findat uentrem, aut pectus, donec currat quod est in eis.	If it is constricted in the belly, or the chest: then it is necessary that you remove it with the cloth which you have wrapped on your hand: and find the belly, or chest, until it heals what is within them.
Si autem auferuntur reliqua membra, et redit caput: tunc intromittat Obstetrix manum sinistram.	If the remaining limbs are removed and the head returns, then the midwife shall insert her left hand.
Si ergo os matricis est apertum, tunc intromittat manum in profundum matricis, et quaerat cum ea caput, et attrahat ipsum cum digitis usque ad os matricis: deinde intromittat in eo uncinum unum, aut uncinos duos, et attrahat ipsum cum eo.	If therefore the opening of the womb is open, then he shall insert his hand into the depth of the womb, and with it seek out the head, and draw it up with his fingers to the opening of the womb: then he shall insert into it one hook, or two hooks, and draw it up with that.
Quod si os matricis coartatur, propter apostema calidum quod accidit ei: tunc non oportet ut laboretur super ipsum, imo oportet tunc administrare effusionem rerum humidarum, pinguium: et administra emplastra: et sedeat in aquis quae mollificant et humectant.	If the mother's jaw is constricted, because of a hot abscess that happens to it; then it is not necessary for it to be scraped over, rather it is necessary then to administer an effusion of moist, fatty things; and administer plasters; and sit in waters which soften and moisten.
Quod si foetus est super latus suum, tunc possibile est ut aequetur: tunc administretur quod diximus in foetu uiuo.	If the fetus is on its side, then it is possible to equalize it; then administer what we said about the living fetus.
Quod si non est possibile illud, tunc incidatur frustatim, et extrahatur.	If that is not possible, then cut it in pieces and remove it.
Et oportet ut non dimittas aliquid ex secundina intus omnino.	And it is necessary that you let nothing out of the second [instrument] inside at all.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc administra quod diximus in apostematibus calidis quae accidunt in matricibus.	When therefore you have completed your operation, then administer what we have said about hot abscesses which occur in wombs.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc descendat in aquis stipticis, et administra reliquam curationem.	If it happens that there is a bleeding, then let it descend into water of astringents and administer the rest of the treatment.
Et ego quidem iam uidi mulierem, in cuius uentre mortuus erat foetus: deinde impregnata est super ipsum uice alia, postea mortuus est foetus alius etiam.	And I have indeed seen a woman, in whose belly a fetus had died; then she became pregnant again over it, afterwards another fetus also died.
Accidit ergo ei post tempus longum apostema in umbilico suo, et inflatum est, donec apertum est: et coepit emittere pus.	Therefore, a long time after this, he developed an abscess at his navel, and it became swollen until it opened, and it began to discharge pus.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius, et medicatus sum ei tempore longo: et non consolidatum est uulnus.	Therefore I was called upon to cure him, and treated him for a long time; and the wound did not close.
Posui ergo super ipsum ex quibusdam emplastris fortis attractionis: et exiuit ex loco os.	I therefore placed upon it from certain plasters of strong traction: and it emerged from the place bone.
Deinde praeterierunt ei dies aliquot, et exiuit os aliud.	Then after some days, another bone came out.
Miratus sum ergo inde, cum in uentre non sit os.	I was amazed therefore, since there is no opening in the belly.
Cogitaui ergo, quia erant ex ossibus foetus mortui.	Therefore, I thought, because they were from the bones of a dead fetus.
Inquisiui ergo uulnus, et extraxi ossa multa, muliere existente in melioribus dispositionibus suis: et iam uixit taliter tempore longo, et mittit ex loco pus parum.	I therefore inquired about the wound, and extracted many bones, with a woman being in better dispositions of herself; and now she has lived thus for a long time, and sends out from the place a little pus.
Et ego non firmaui hic hoc extraneum, nisi quoniam in eo est scientia, et adiutorium ad illud, quod administrat medicus artifex cum manu ex curatione.	And I did not set forth this foreign thing here unless it contained knowledge, and aid to that which the physician craftsman administers with the hand from healing.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum necessariorum in extractione foetus.	On the forms of instruments necessary for the extraction of a fetus.
Caput LXXVII.	Chapter LXXVII.
Hic inferius est forma Strictorii, quo aequantur libri, cui aequaliter sunt duae uertigines in duabus extremitatibus duorum lignorum.	Here is the shape of the Straitjacket, by which books are leveled, to which two whorls are equally placed at the two extremities of two logs.
Verumtamen haec Vertigo oportet ut sit subtilior strictorio: et ut fiat, aut ex ebano, aut ex ligno bussi.	Nevertheless, this vertigo ought to be of a finer constriction; and that it may be so, let it be made either out of ebony or out of boxwood.
Et sit latitudo omnis ligni quasi duo digiti: et margo cuiusque amborum est quasi digitus unus, et longitudo cuiusque eorum est palmus et medietas: et in medio duorum lignorum sunt duo additamenta ex genere eiusdem ligni, quae iam firmata sunt in utrisque, quorum longitudo est medietas palmi et plus parum: et latitudo utriusque est quasi duo digiti, aut plus parum.	And let the width of all the wood be like two fingers: and the edge of each of the two is like one finger, and the length of each of them is a palm and a half: and in the middle of the two pieces of wood are two additions of the same kind of wood, which are already fastened on both sides, whose length is half a palm and a little more: and the width of each is like two fingers, or a little more.
Et ista duo additamenta intromittuntur in os matricis, ut aperiatur cum eis quando tu reuoluis duas Vertigines.	And these two additions are inserted into the mouth of the womb, so that it may be opened with them when you turn two whirls.
Forma Vertiginis qua aperitur matrix.	The form of dizziness when the womb is opened.
Forma alia ad simile illius, subtilior, et leuior.	Another form, similar to this one, more delicate and lighter.
Fiat ex ligno ebani, aut bussi, secundum similitudinem forcipum.	Make it from ebony wood, or boxwood, according to the likeness of forceps.
Verumtamen in extremitate eius sint duo additamenta, sicut uides hic supra: et longitudo omnis additamenti ex eis est quasi palmus: et latitudo utriusque est, duo digiti.	Nevertheless, at its end there should be two additions, as you see here above: and the length of the whole addition from these is like a palm: and the width of both is, two fingers.
Cum ergo uis aperire matricem cum eo, tunc fac sedere mulierem super lectum, pendentibus pedibus eius, aperto quod est inter crura eius.	When therefore you wish to open the womb with it, then make her sit on a bed, with her feet hanging down, with that which is between her legs open.
Deinde intromitte ista duo additamenta coniuncta in matricem: et tu es tenens extremitatem instrumenti inferius inter coxas eius.	Then introduce these two additions joined into the matrix: and you are holding the lower end of the instrument between his hips.
Deinde aperi manum tuam cum instrumento, sicut facis cum forficibus, aequaliter secundum quantitatem quam uis ex apertione oris matricis, donec faciat Obstetrix quod uult.	Then open your hand with an instrument, as you do with forceps, equally according to the amount that you wish from the opening of the mouth of the womb, until the midwife does what she wants.
Forma Vertiginis alterius quam dixerunt antiqui Forma Impellentis quo impellitur foetus.	The form of vertigo which the ancients called the form of the driving force by which the fetus is driven.
Forma Almisdac, qua conteritur caput magnum: et assimilatur forcipi, cui sunt dentes in extremitate, sicut uides.	The form of a mallet used to crush the large skull and it is similar to forceps which have teeth at their end as you see.
Et quandoque fit oblungum, sicut forcipes secundum hanc formam, sicut uides, cui sunt dentes sicut dentes serrae, quo inciditur et conteritur.	And sometimes it is made oblong, like forceps according to this form, as you see, which has teeth like saw teeth, with which one cuts and crushes.
Forma Almisdac quo conteritur caput paruum.	The form of a small anvil for crushing the head.
Forma Vncini habentis spinam unam.	Form of a wound having one spine.
Forma Vncini habentis spinas duas.	Form of forceps having two spines.
Forma forcipis cui sunt dentes serrae, cum quo conteritur caput foetus.	Form of forceps with serrated teeth, with which the head of a fetus is crushed.
Forma Spatumilis habentis duas extremitates ad abscindendum caput.	The shape of a spatula has two extremities for cutting off the head.
Forma duorum Spatumilium etiam latorum.	The shape of two spatulas, also called awls.
Ista instrumenta omnia exercentur, et quanto plus multiplicantur species eorum, et praeparata sunt apud artificem, est uelocior ad operationem suam, et altior apud homines, propter quantitatem suam.	All these instruments are practiced and the more they multiply in kind and are prepared by the craftsman, the faster they are for their operation and the higher they are among men, because of their quantity.
Non ergo despicies ex eis instrumentum, quin sit apud te praeparatum.	Therefore, you should not disdain from among these instruments that one be prepared for you.
Inexcusabilis est enim necessitas eorum.	Their necessity is inexcusable.
¶ De extractione Secundinae.	On the Extraction of a Second Stone.
Caput LXXVIII.	Chapter LXXVIII.
Quando retinetur Secundina apud partum, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmae, ut retineat anhelitum suum.	When the secundina is retained at childbirth, then it is necessary that you instruct the weak woman to retain her breath.
Deinde fac eam sternutare cum condisi: et stringe manum tuam super os eius, et nares ipsius.	Then make him sneeze with the condiment: and grasp your hand over his mouth, and his nostrils.
Si ergo egreditur per hoc, bonum est.	If therefore it comes out through this, it is good.
Si non: tunc accipe ollam, et perfora in coopertorio foramen: et pone in ea herbas aperientes os matricis, sicut calamentum, rutam, et anetum, et camomillam, et sseham, et cassiam ligneam, et centauream: accipe omnes istas herbas, aut quasdam earum, et submerge eas cum aqua, et pone eas super ignem.	If not: then take a pot, and perforate in the lid a hole: and put in it herbs that open the matrix, such as  calamentum, rue, and agrimony, and chamomile, and marshmallow, and willow bark, and centaury: take all these herbs, or some of them, and submerge them with water, and put them over the fire.
Deinde pone embulam arundinis super foramen coopertorii ollae, et extremitatem aliam in os matricis: et teneat eam donec perueniat uapor ad concauitatem matricis.	Then place a bundle of reeds over the opening of the container and the other end in the uterus; and hold it until vapor reaches the cavity of the uterus.
Deinde fac eam sternutare, sicut diximus.	Then make her sneeze, as we have said.
Secundina enim egredietur cum facilitate.	For Secundina will easily come out.
Si autem remaneat post hanc curationem, et non egrediatur: tunc praecipe Obstetrici, ut submergat manum suam in oleo sisamino, aut mucillagine alteae.	If however it remains after this treatment and does not come out: then order the midwife to submerge her hand in sesame oil, or a thick althea poultice.
Deinde intromittat in uuluam, et quaerat cum ea Secundinam.	Then he introduces it into the vulva, and seeks with it the Second one.
Cum ergo inuenerit eam, tunc accipiat eam, et extendat ipsam paulatim.	When therefore he has found it, then let him take it and extend it gradually.
Si autem fuerit annexa in profundo matricis, tunc intromittat manum, secundum quod narrauimus, donec quando inuenerit Secundinam, et extrahat eam paulatim secundum rectitudinem, ut non cadat matrix apud attractionem uehementem: imo oportet, ut permutetur cum facilitate ad latera dextra et sinistra: deinde addatur in quantitatem attractionis.	If it is attached deep in the womb, then he will insert his hand, according to what we have recounted, until he finds the Secondine and extracts it gradually according to straightness, so that the womb does not fall down at a violent pull: indeed it ought to be turned with ease to the right and left sides; then add in the quantity of the attraction.
Ipsa enim obedit tunc, et seruatur, et euadit ab adhaerentia.	For it then obeys, and is preserved, and departs from adhesion.
Quod si os matricis est coartatum, sicut nos iam narrauimus: cura eam cum sternutatione, et ex medicatione ollae cum herbis.	If the pelvic bone is constricted, as we have already narrated: care for it with sneezing and from medication of a pot with herbs.
Si autem non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc caue ne fatigeris super eam in iteratione extractionis.	If it does not come out with all that we have narrated, then beware of tiring yourself on its repeated extraction.
Verum oportet, ut quod egreditur ad os matricis ex ea, liges ad coxam mulieris.	It is true that what comes out to the mouth of the uterus from it should be tied to the hip of a woman.
Deinde clisteriza eam cum unguento tetrapharmacon.	Then irrigate it with ointment tetrapharmakon.
Ipsum enim putrefaciet eam post dies, et dissoluetur, et egredietur.	For it will indeed rot after days, and dissolve, and it will come out.
Verumtamen quando putrefit, eleuatur ex ea odor malus ad stomachum et caput, et laedit illud infirmam.	But when it decays, a bad smell arises from it to the stomach and head, and harms the weak one.
Oportet ergo ut administrentur suffumigationes conuenientes ad illud.	Therefore it is necessary that appropriate fumigations be administered to it.
Quidam autem antiquorum iam experti sunt suffumigationem nasturtii, et ficuum siccarum.	Some ancients already experimented with fumigation of nasturtium and dried figs.
Forma instrumenti quo suffumigatur mulier apud retentionem Secundinae et menstruorum.	The form of the instrument with which a woman is fumigated during the retention of the Second [menstrual cycle] and menstruation.
Fiat ex uitro simile alcama, aut ex zere: et ponatur extremitas ampla super ignem: et suffumigatio sit posita super prunas: teneat eam, donec consumatur illa suffumigatio: et itera aliam.	Make from a jar similar to an alembic, or from grease; and place the broad end over fire; and let fumigation be placed over prunes: hold it until that fumigation is consumed; and repeat another.
¶ De curatione Ani non perforati.	On the treatment of an unperforated anus.
Caput LXXIX.	Chapter seventy-ninth.
Nascuntur multi puerorum, et Ani eorum sunt non perforati, quos iam opilauit sifac subtile.	Many boys are born with their anuses not perforated, which have already been examined by a subtle sifac.
Oportet ergo, ut obstetrix perforet illud sifac digito suo: et si non, perforet ipsum cum Spatumili acuto: et caueat lacertum, ne tangat eum.	Therefore, let the midwife pierce that siphon with her finger; and if not, pierce it with a sharp spatula; and let her beware of the edge, lest she touch it.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam infusam in uino et oleo.	Then place over it a cloth soaked in wine and oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum ungentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointment until it is healed.
Si autem times quod opiletur, tunc pone in foramine cannulam de plumbo diebus multis, et auferatur quando puer uult egerere.	If however it is deemed necessary to place a plug, then put in the hole a lead pipe for many days, and remove it when the child wishes to recover.
Et iam accidit opilatio Ani etiam ex consolidatione uulneris, aut apostematis.	And it sometimes happens that a fistula occurs in the anus even from the closing of a wound or an abscess.
Oportet ergo ut secetur illa consolidatio, deinde curetur cum eo quod diximus ex curatione et plumbo.	Therefore it is necessary that that consolidation be cut, then treated with what we have said from treatment and lead.
¶ De curatione Fistularum quae accidunt in inferiori parte.	On the treatment of fistulas that occur in the lower part.
Caput LXXX.	Chapter LXXX.
Fistulae quae accidunt in inferiori, sunt Nodatio, et Grossitudo quae accidunt prope anum deforis: aut in spacio unius partium: et est Fistula una, aut plures.	fistulas which occur in the lower [region], are Knot and Swelling which occur near the anus of the mouth: or in the space of one part: and it is one fistula, or more.
Cum ergo antiquatur illa Nodatio, aperitur, et currit ex ea humiditas aquosa alba, aut pus subtile.	When therefore that Knotting becomes obsolete, it is opened and a watery humidity, white, or a subtle pus flows out of it.
Et quandoque sunt ex istis Fistulis penetrantes.	And sometimes there are among these penetrating fistulas.
Ergo penetrantes cognoscuntur per illud quod egreditur ex egestione, et uentositate, quando utitur infirmus egestione: et fortasse egreditur ex eis uermis.	Therefore, penetrating wounds are known by what comes out through excretion and windiness, when the sick person uses excretion: and perhaps it emerges from them worms.
Et sunt ex eis Fistulae quando sunt in spacio penetrantes usque ad uesicam, et usque ad meatum uirgae.	And there are among these fistulas when they are in a penetrating space up to the bladder, and up to the male organ's passage.
Et sunt ex eis penetrantes usque ad iuncturam coxae, et usque ad nodum caudae.	And they are penetrating up to the hip joint and to the knot of the tail.
Ex eo autem quo cognoscitur Fistula penetrans usque ad anum, etiam a non penetrante, est, ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum: et intromittas tentam subtilem in Fistulam ex aere, aut ferro: quando non est tortuositas.	From this it is known if a fistula penetrates to the anus, even a non-penetrating one, as you introduce your index finger into the anus: and introduce a thin probe into the fistula from bronze or iron: when there is no twisting.
Quod si in ea est tortuositas, tunc intromitte in eam tentam ex plumbo subtilem, aut pilum ex pilis equarum, donec sentias tentam, aut pilum in digito tuo.	If there is a twisting in it, then introduce into it a thin lead probe or a horsehair probe until you feel the probe, or the probe in your finger.
Quod si non sentis ipsam penitus, neque procedit ex foramine aliquid ex egestione, neque uentositas, neque uermis sicut dixi: tunc scias, quia est non penetrans: propera ergo ad curationem.	If you do not feel it thoroughly, and nothing proceeds from the hole by excretion, nor windiness, nor worm as I said; then know that it is not penetrating: therefore hasten to treatment.
Et quando Fistula est penetrans usque ad uesicam, aut ad meatum urinae: tunc significatio eius est exitus urinae ex ea, et prohibitio eius ab hoc ut consolidetur locus cum medicinis.	And when a fistula is penetrating to the bladder or to the urinary tract, then its signification is the excretion of urine from it, and the prohibition of it from this so that the place may be consolidated with medicines.
Si uero est penetrans usque ad iuncturam coxae, aut ad os coxae: tunc signum eius est, quod perueniat tenta usque illuc, si non est in ea tortuositas usque ad os: et inuentio doloris in circumitu partis, et quod egreditur pus ex ea semper: et quod non ualeat in ea medicatio, neque consolidatur cum unguento.	If it penetrates to the joint of the hip or to the bone of the hip: then its sign is that the probe arrives there, if there is no crookedness up to the bone: and finding of pain around the area, and that pus comes out of it always: and that medicine does not avail in it, nor does it solidify with ointment.
Et in istis Fistulis omnibus penetrantibus non est curatio omnino: et curatio earum est labor et uanitas ei, ex stultis medicis, super quem formatur.	And in these fistulas that penetrate through it there is no treatment at all; and the treatment of them is toil and vanity for him, out of foolish physicians, upon whom it is formed.
In illa autem quae non est penetrans, et non antiqua, speratur sanatio cum serro: secundum quod ego narro tibi, et ego iam probaui: et est, ut iaceat infirmus inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et eleua crura eius usque supra coxas ipsius, et coxae eius sint inclinatae ad uentrem ipsius.	In that which is not penetrating, and not old, healing is expected with a saw, according to what I tell you, and I have already proven it: and it is, that the sick person lie between your hands on his back: and raise his legs up to his hips, and let his hips be inclined to his belly.
Deinde intromittetentam plumbi, aut aeris, si est in Fistula tortuositas, donec scias ubi peruenit tenta.	Then introduce a lead probe, or of copper, if there is winding in the fistula, until you know where it reaches the tip.
Si autem sentit eam infirmus circa anum, tunc oportet ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum.	If he feels her weak around the anus, then you ought to insert your index finger into the anus.
Si ergo sentis in digito tuo tentam iam penetrasse per seipsam detectam, praeter quod sentias inter digitum tuum, et inter ipsum sifac, aut carnem: tunc ergo scias certe, quia est penetrans: non ergo labores in ea, quoniam non est eius sanatio, sicut diximus.	If therefore you feel in your finger that something has already pierced through itself, detected besides that which you feel between your finger and the skin or flesh: then you know for certain that it is piercing; do not therefore labor on it, because it is not healing, as we have said.
Dixerunt tamen, quia sanatur in quibusdam hominibus caro, et ex medicatione qua ei speratur iuuamentum, est, ut ignias cauterium subtile secundum amplitudinem Fistulae, sicut praecessit, et intromittas ipsum ignitum in Fistulam, donec perueniat circa anum.	However, they say that in some people flesh heals and with the medicine which is hoped to help, it is as if fine cauteries are put into the fistula according to its size, as was said before, and you introduce the burning one into the fistula until it reaches near the anus.
Deinde itera illud bis, aut ter, donec scias, quia iam adustae sunt omnes illae carnes additae filtratae, quae sunt similes cannulae pennae auis.	Then repeat this twice, or thrice, until you know that all those added and filtered parts of flesh, which are like the quill of a bird’s feather, have been burnt.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, donec egrediantur illae carnes, quae adustae sunt: deinde cura illud cum unguentis generantibus carnem et consolidantibus.	Then take care of it with a covering of butter until the burned flesh has come out; then take care of it with ointments that generate and consolidate flesh.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est.	If therefore he is healed, it is good.
Et si non, tunc non sanatur cum alia curatione unquam.	And if not, then it is never cured with any other treatment.
Et si egreditur tenta, et non peruenerit usque ad digitum tuum, qui est in ano, et est inter ipsum et tentam uelamen spissum ex carne, aut sifac: et uides Fistulam in eo quod sequitur superficiem cutis, tunc seca cutem ab initio Fistulae, et tu uadis secando cum tenta quod est in fistula, donec perueniat secatio ubi peruenit tentae extremitas, et liberatur tenta et cadit.	And if the probe goes out and does not reach your finger which is in the anus, and there is between it and the probe a thick layer of flesh, or skin; and you see an opening in that which follows the surface of the skin, then cut the skin from the beginning of the opening, and you go cutting with the probe which is in the fistula, until the cutting reaches where the end of the probe arrives, and the probe is freed and falls.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas, quae assimilantur cannulae pennae auis, ut non remaneat ex eis aliquid.	Then cleanse those filtered meats which are similar to the quill of a bird's feather, so that nothing remains from them.
Si autem uincit te sanguis, et soluit inter te et inter operationem tuam ut seces illas carnes: tunc melius quod fit, et uelocioris iuuamenti, cauterizare eam cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta.	If blood overcomes you, and loosens between you and your operation so that you cut those flesh: then better that which is done, and more rapid help, cauterize it with fire, or with a sharp medicine.
Quoniam cauterium cum igne aggregat habitudines bonas, adustionem illarum carnium additarum, et abscisionem sanguinis, et exiccationem humiditatum.	Because a cautery with fire gathers good qualities,  the burning of those added tissues, and the cutting off of blood, and the drying up of humors.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, aut caulibus tritis, donec locus emittat pus, et egrediantur illae carnes adustae in pus.	Then treat it with licenses wrapped in butter, or ground celery stalks, until the place emits pus and those charred meats come out into the pus.
Deinde cura tunc uulnus cum unguentis consolidatiuis, generantibus carnem duram: et sunt medicinae in quibus sunt stipticitas et exiccatio.	Then the wound is treated with ointments that consolidate it and generate hard flesh; and there are medicines which have astringency and dryness.
Nam quando restaurantur, tunc iam sanatur: et non times iterationem.	For when they are restored, then it is already healed: and do not fear a repetition.
Si autem Fistula iam peruenit usque ad profundum ani, et elongatur a superfluitate corporis: tunc intromitte digitum tuum in anum, et inquire cum eo.	If however fistula has already come to the depth of the anus, and extends from the superfluity of the body: then introduce your finger into the anus, and inquire with it.
Si ergo sentis tentam, et inter te, et inter eam est uelamen ex sifac, aut carne, et est propinqua penetrationi: tunc non est operatio in illo, nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	If therefore you feel a wound, and between you and it is a covering of silk or flesh, and it is near to penetration: then there is no operation on that, unless according to the way of trust and hope.
Quod est, quia administratur in eo unus trium modorum: aut ut cauterizes ipsam, sicut diximus: aut seces eam, donec consequaris concauitatem eius, ut sit possibile tibi intromittere licinia, et curationem ex proximo.	That is, because it is administered in one of three ways: either you cauterize it, as we have said; or you cut it until you reach its hollow space, so that it is possible for you to insert a ligature, and the cure from next.
Et non procedas multum cum sectione, ut non incidas lacertum continentem anum, et accidat super infirmum exitus egestionis absque uoluntate.	And do not proceed much with the incision, so that you do not cut the ligament containing the anus, and it happens over the weak exit of excrement without volition.
Deinde cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then take care of it as we have said.
Fortasse enim sanabitur: aut elonges ipsum uelamen, et mundes ipsum postquam secas ipsum usque prope anum, sicut diximus, aut cum tenta, aut cum instrumento alio acutae extremitatis.	Perhaps it will heal: or stretch the wound itself and clean it after drying it almost to the anus, as we have said, either with a probe, or with another instrument of sharp extremity.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas quae sunt in sectione, usque ubi potes cum perscrutatione.	Then purify those filtered tissues that are in the section, as far as you can with examination.
Deinde conare restaurationem uulneris totius cum sectione, et orificio superiore ubi consolidatur: et remanet Fistula aperta in interiore parte anus, et erit leuius super infirmum.	Then endeavor the restoration of the whole wound with a cut, and an opening above where it is consolidated; and let a fistula remain open in the inner part of the anus, and it will be lighter upon the weaker [part].
Et quandoque suitur Fistula secundum hunc modum: et est, quando intromittis tentam in Fistulam: et est in latere ani circa superficiem corporis cum cute et margine ani: tunc accipe tentam perforatae extremitatis, quae est sicut acus aleskef, id est, praeparantium coria, secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes a fistula is treated in this way: and it is when you insert a probe into the fistula: and it is on the side of the anus near the surface of the body with skin and edge of the anus: then take a probe with a perforated end, which is like an awl, that is, prepared leather, according to this form.
Et intromitte in eam filum inuolutum ex quinque filis, et circiter ea.	And introduce into it a thread wrapped from five threads, and about it.
Deinde intromitte tentam cum filo in Fistulam, donec consequatur concauitatem eius.	Then insert a probe with a thread into the fistula until it reaches its cavity.
Si ergo est penetrans in margine ani interius prope, tunc extrahe filum ex illo foramine: ita ut intromittas digitum tuum in anum, et extrahas extremitatem fili, et aggreges duas extremitates simul: et stringe utramque, et dimitte illud die uno, aut duobus diebus: et quanto plus incidit filum in carne, stringe ipsum bene, donec incidantur illae carnes quae sunt inter duas extremitates fili, et cadant: deinde cura uulnus, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	If therefore it is penetrating in the margin of the anus internally near, then draw out the thread from that opening: so that you introduce your finger into the anus, and draw out the extremity of the thread, and join the two extremities together: and tightly grasp both, and release it one or two days: and the more the thread sinks into the flesh, tighten it well, until those fleshes which are between the two extremities of the thread sink in, and fall: then take care of the wound, until it consolidates and heals.
Si autem orificium Fistulae non est penetrans: tunc fac ipsum penetrare quocunque modo praeparatur tibi, nisi sit in profundo multum.	If, however, the opening of the fistula is not penetrating, then make it penetrate in any way you can prepare for yourself, unless it is deep in a great deal.
Non enim inest tibi, ut facias illud propter lacertum, ut non incidas ipsum.	For you ought not to do it for a wound so that you don't cut into it.
Deinde fac cum ea sicut diximus, donec sanetur.	Then do with it as we have said, until it heals.
Forma Spatumilis spinosi quo finditur Fistula, cuius curuitas est acuta ualde, et pars altera est non acuta, ut non incidat illud quod non est necesse, sicut uides.	The shape of a spina knife which is used to make an incision for a fistula, the care of which is very acute, and one part is not acute so that it does not cut what is not necessary, as you see.
¶ De sutura Hemorroidarum, ex quibus currit sanguis ex incisione earum: et cura fissurarum.	Concerning the stitching of hemorrhoids from which blood flows when cut, and the treatment of fissures.
Caput LXXXI.	Chapter LXXXI.
Sunt Hemorroides secundum duos modos.	There are hemorrhoids in two ways.
Aut enim sunt intra anum, similes uesicis carbonum, uel prunarum: aut quasi ipsae sint grana uuae.	Or they are like pieces of charcoal or plums within the anus, or like seeds of a fig.
Et ex eis sunt paruae, et magnae: et sanguis currit ex eis semper, et est una, et sunt multae.	And of these there are small ones, and large ones: and blood runs from them always, and there is one, and there are many.
Et sunt extra anum, et in extremitatibus eius.	And they are outside the anus, and at the extremities of it.
Verumtamen istae quae sunt extra anum, sunt secundum plurimum paucae humiditatis, ex quibus currit aqua citrina, aut parum sanguinis cursu assiduo: et sunt secundum colorem corporis.	But those things which are outside the anus are, for the most part, very few in moisture, from which runs yellow water or little blood in constant flow; and they are according to the color of the body.
Et curatio eius quae est intra anum, est, ut praecipias infirmo ut assellet: et exprimatur, donec egrediatur anus, et appareant athelil tibi.	And the cure of it which is within the rectum, is, that you instruct the sick person to strain: and it be expressed until it comes out of the anus, and appear to you atheists.
Propterea ergo et suspende cum uncinis: aut tene eos cum ungue tuo.	Therefore also suspend with hooks: or hold them with your finger.
Deinde incide eos apud radices suas.	Then cut them at their roots.
Si autem non retinentur in eis uncini, propter humiditatem eorum et ipsorum mollificationem: tunc cape eos cum panno aspero, aut cum coto ex diploide lanea, et extrahe eos cum digitis tuis.	If they are not held by the forceps because of their moisture and softening: then take them with a rough cloth, or with a pad from double wool, and remove them with your fingers.
Deinde incide eos, et pulueriza super eos post incisionem quosdam pulueres calidos, ut stent eis loco cauterii.	Then cut them open, and apply some hot powders over them after the incision, so that they may take their place as cauterization.
Aut cauteriza eos secundum quod praecessit in capitulo cauterizandi.	Or cauterize them according to what preceded in the chapter on cauterization.
Deinde cura eos cum reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then care for them with the rest of the treatment, until they are healed.
Quod si non obedit anus egressioni, tunc clisteriza infirmum clisteri in quo sit mordicatio parua, ut lauetur cum eo quod est in ano, et obediat egressioni uelociter, quando exprimit se infirmus.	If the old woman does not obey evacuation, then cleanse the sick person with a clyster containing a small amount of biting substance, so that it may wash what is in the anus and obey the exit quickly when the sick person expels it.
Si autem athelil sunt extrinseci ab ano, tunc res eorum est leuis, facilis: et est ut capias eos cum ungue tuo, aut capias eos cum uncino, et incidas eos.	If, however, they are external to the anus, then their affair is light, easy: and it is as you capture them with your nail, or you capture them with a hook, and cut them.
Deinde cura eos cum eo quod diximus, donec sanentur.	Then care for them with that which we have said, until they are healed.
Et qui abhorret incisionem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut administres suturam eorum secundum hunc modum.	And if one shuns cutting with a knife, then it is necessary that you administer suture of them according to this manner.
Accipe filum inuolutum, et intromitte ipsum in acum.	Take a thread wrapped and insert it into the needle.
Deinde extrahe athelil ad superiora, et fac ipsum penetrare cum acu in radice eius ex parte altera: et inuolue duas extremitates fili, in inferiori parte acus, et sint latitudinaliter: et stringe athelil strictura forti.	Then draw the athil upwards, and make it pierce with a needle at its root on the other side: and wind two ends of the thread onto the needle in the lower part, and let them be lengthwise: and tighten the athil tightly.
Deinde noda filum, et extrahe acum.	Then knot the thread, and extract the needle.
Fac illud cum omnibus athelil, et dimitte ex eis unum: nec suas ipsum, ut currat ex eo superfluitas sanguinis.	Do this with all atelis, and let go from them one: nor its own, so that it may run out of it superfluity of blood.
Deinde pone super anum pannum infusum in oleo rosato, aut caeroto, et pone ipsum super anum: et praecipe infirmo, ut quiescat.	Then put over the anus a cloth soaked in rose oil, or oil of cedar, and place it over the anus: and bid the sick man to rest.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, donec cadat.	Then let it go, until it falls.
Cum ergo cadunt athelil, cura eos cum unguentis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	When therefore they fall asleep, care for them with ointment and the rest of healing until they are healed.
¶ De cura Fissurarum.	On the treatment of fissures.
Multotiens enim accidunt ex exiccatione stercoris, et constrictione naturae.	For many times indeed they happen from drying of dung, and constriction of nature.
Cum ergo antiquantur, et non ualet in eis medicina: tunc oportet ut radas cum puncta Spatumilis, aut cum ungue tuo, donec fiant humidae, et auferatur ab eis cortex superior qui prohibet eas a consolidatione.	When therefore they do not heal, and medicine does not work on them: then it is necessary that you scrape with the point of a spatula, or with your fingernail, until they become moist, and the outer skin which prevents their consolidation be removed from them.
Deinde cura eas, donec consolidentur secundum quod oportet.	Then care for them until they are consolidated as is necessary.
Si autem non consolidantur: tunc itera eas cum rasione uehementiori quam prima, donec sanguinentur multum, et excorientur deinde cura eas, donec sanentur.	If they do not knit together: then again dress them with more intense reason than the first, until they bleed much, and then they are scraped, and afterwards take care of them until they heal.
¶ De curatione Almirmar inuersorum, et non inuersorum: et Athelil siccorum, et Formicae.	On the treatment of inversions of the alar cartilage, both inverted and not inverted; and of Athelil (cartilaginous growths) and Formicae (benign tumors).
Caput LXXXII.	Chapter LXXXII.
Scias quod Almirmar non est nisi nodus rotundus secundum colorem corporis, similis capiti claui: et fit in toto corpore, praecipue in inferioribus partibus pedum, et digitis: et accidit ex eis dolor apud ambulationem.	Know that Almirmar is nothing but a round knot according to the color of the body, similar to the head of a nail: and it occurs in the whole body, especially in the lower parts of the feet, and fingers: and pain occurs with them when walking.
Oportet ergo ut secetur quod est in circumitu claui, et teneatur cum forficibus, aut cum uncino, et eradicetur ex radice sua.	Therefore it is necessary that what is around the nail be cut and held with forceps or a hook, and eradicated from its root.
Deinde cura illud: et si uis cauteriza illud secundum quod praecessit in capitulo suo.	Then take care of it; and if you wish, cauterize it according to what preceded in its chapter.
Ex athelil autem siccis unus est eminentia parua, aspera, filtrata, rotunda supra superficiem corporis.	From the athellium, however, there is one small prominence, rough, filtered, round on the surface of the body.
Et multotiens accidunt in manibus puerorum.	And many times happen in the hands of children.
Et curatio eius est, ut extendas athelil, et incidas ipsum: aut stringas ipsum cum filo de serico: aut cum pilo, donec cadat.	And its cure is, that you extend the [afflicted area], and cut it: or bind it with a silk thread: or with hair, until it falls off.
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum secundum quod praemissum est cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta: et iam eradicantur athelil inuersi, et non inuersi cum instrumento quod ego dicam.	And if you wish, cauterize it according to what has been said before with fire, or with a sharp medicine: and now the athelil are eradicated, both inverted and not inverted with the instrument which I shall tell you about.
Formica autem est etiam eminentia parua filtrata, grossa, super superficiem corporis, uadens in profundum ualde: et quando inuenit eam frigus, sentitur in ea simile mordicationi formicae, et fit in corpore toto: et plurimum eius fit in manibus.	A sting from an ant is also a small eminence filtered and coarse on the surface of the body, penetrating deep: and when it finds cold in it, it feels like a bite from an ant in it, and it happens throughout the body: and most of it happens in the hands.
Et curatio eius est, ut accipias cannulam ex penna anseris, aut penna uulturis forti: et pone illam cannulam super Formicam, donec contineat circulus cannulae ex partibus eius.	And its cure is, that you take a tube from the feather of a goose, or the feather of a strong hawk: and place that tube over the Ant, until the circle of the tube contains it from its parts.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum cannula, donec seces quod est in circumitu Formicae: et ponas eam in profundo carnis, et eradices Formicam ex radice eius.	Then roll your hand with a probe until you cut what is around the ant: and place it deep in the flesh, and eradicate the ant from its root.
Et si uis, fac illud cum cannula aeris, aut ferri, secundum hanc formam.	And if you wish, make it with a tube of air, or iron, according to this form.
Sit superius cannulae ad sublimitatem trahens surdum inuolutum, ut alleuietur super digitum apprehensio eius et ipsius reuolutio.	Let the upper part of the tube be drawn up to a height so that the grip on the finger is relieved and its turning is easier.
Et si uis cauteriza Formicam secundum quod praemissum est in cauterizatione Athelil in capitulo de cauterio.	And if you wish to cauterize a Fornica according to what was previously stated in the cauterization of Aethil in the chapter on cauterization.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum quae administrantur ad Clisteria in aegritudinibus Ani, et solutionis uentris, et colicae.	On the forms of instruments that are administered to the bowels in ailments of the anus, and the solution of the belly, and colic.
Caput LXXXIII.	Chapter LXXXIII.
Quandoque Clistere fit ex argento, aut ex aurichalco, aut ex aere fuso, aut malleato.	Sometimes a clyster is made from silver, or from electrum, or from cast copper, or hammered copper.
Et quandoque fit ex istis Instrumentis paruum, et magnum, secundum illos in quibus administrantur.	And sometimes these instruments are made small and large, according to those in which they are administered.
Illud ergo quod administratur in curatione puerorum paruorum, sit paruum: et quorum ani sunt debiles, aut dolorosi, sic et clisteria eorum.	Therefore, what is administered in the cure of young children should be little, and those whose anuses are weak or painful, so also their genitals.
Clistere magnum.	Large enema.
Cistere paruum.	Small bladder.
Canna eius, id est, caput superius in quo ligatur uter, sit amplum secundum hunc modum: et sit ei distinctio ut ligetur uter sicut uides, et extremitas eius inferior quae intromittitur in anum, sit surda, id est, non aperta, lenis, ualde, trahens ad subtilitatem: et in uno laterum eius sint duo foramina, et in latere altero foramen unum.	Its shaft, that is, the upper part in which the uterus is tied, should be wide according to this method: and let there be a distinction so that the uterus may be tied as you see, and its lower end which enters the anus, be closed, that is, not open, smooth, gentle, drawing to subtlety: and on one side of it there are two holes, and on the other side one hole.
Et sit amplitudo foraminis secundum grossitudinem radiorum, et grossius parum, et sit uter in quo ponuntur medicinae ex uesica animalis: aut ex charta ouis, quae sit secundum formam asofrati paruae: cuius radix sit palmus unus.	And let the width of the opening be according to the thickness of the rays, and a little thicker, and let it be one in which medicines are placed from the bladder of an animal; or from sheepskin, which is according to the shape of a small asphodel: whose root is one palm.
Et perforetur foraminibus multis sicut reuoluitur, et sit spacium quod est inter omne foramen grossitudo digiti.	And it is pierced with many holes as it revolves, and let the space that is between every hole be the thickness of a finger.
Deinde intromitte in illa foramina filum forte ex filo crudo, quod sit ex decem filis, aut circiter ea, et aggrega cum eo utrem sicut asofrati.	Then insert into those openings a strong thread from raw fiber, which is to be of ten threads, or about that many, and tie it together with it like the lining of a bag.
Cum ergo ponitur in eo uter, stringatur in capite clisteris inter duo distinguentia constrictione forti.	When therefore it is placed in that (the womb), it is tightened at the head with a clyster between two distinguishing constrictions with strong force.
Deinde clisteriza cum eo.	Then give him an enema.
Et haec est forma circuli utris hic depicta, et foraminum.	And this is the form of the circle of the uterus here depicted, and the foramen.
Qualitas autem clisterizandi cum eo, est: ut impleas utrem, aut uesicam ex medicina, quae sit calefacta secundum quantitatem tolerantiae infirmi: et caue ne sit calida ualde, aut frigida ualde.	The quality of administering a clyster with it is this: that you fill the rectum or bladder with medicine, which has been heated according to the amount that the patient can tolerate; and beware that it is not too hot or too cold.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et eleuet crura sua ad superiora: et pone sub eo inthaan, id est, corium super quod iacent homines, aut linteamen.	Then the patient is laid on his back and his legs are raised to a higher position; and beneath him there is placed a thing called  *inthan*, that is, leather upon which men lie, or linen.
Deinde inunge extremitatem Clisteris cum oleo, aut cum albugine oui, aut cum mucillagine foenugraeci, aut similium.	Then anoint the extremity with oil, or with egg white, or with flaxseed mucilage, or something similar.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in anum cum facilitate.	Then introduce it into the anus with ease.
Deinde accipiat minister utrem cum duabus manibus suis simul, et exprimat ipsum cum uehementia, donec euacuet totum quod est in Clisteri in intestinum.	Then let the attendant take the womb with both hands and press it vigorously until all that is in the intestine is evacuated.
Deinde extrahe Clistere, et eleuet infirmus crura sua ad parietem.	Then remove the clyster and let the sick person raise his legs against the wall.
Quod si medicina cogit eum ad exitum, tunc teneat quantum potest.	If medicine compels him to an outlet, then let him hold it as much as he can.
Et si dormit cum ea nocte tota, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if he sleeps with it all night, it is more useful in healing.
Si autem clisterizas eum in aegritudinibus solutionis uentris, et festinat exitus eius: tunc itera clistere, donec sanetur.	If however you give him enemas in diseases of the belly, and his death is hastened, then repeat the enema until he recovers.
Quod si in ano sunt hemorroides, aut apostemata laedentia, tunc sit clistere subtile ualde, lene, ex clisteribus quibus clisterizantur pueri.	If there are hemorrhoids or painful boils in the anus, then let there be a gentle, subtle enema, from enemas which are used for children.
Et haec sit forma clisteris subtilis super quod sit stricta cutis.	And this be the form of a fine clyster for that which is strict skin.
¶ De curatione Vulnerum capitis sine fractura ossis.	On the treatment of wounds of the head without fracture of bone.
Caput LXXXIIII.	Chapter LXXXIV.
Iam dixi in diuisione de curatione uulnerum quod conueniebat libro, et ego dicam hic curationem eorum cum manu, et cum medicinis secundum complementum.	I have said in the division of the cure of wounds what was fitting for the book, and I will say here the cure of them with hand, and with medicines according to complement.
Dico ergo, quod uulnera diuersificantur secundum illud quo fiunt uulnera, et secundum locum super quem cadit uulnus.	Therefore I say that wounds are diversified according to how they are made, and according to the place upon which the wound falls.
Res ergo quibus fiunt uulnera multotiens, sunt sicut iactus lapidis: aut incisio ensis, aut cultelli: aut percussio cum lancea, aut ligno, aut sagitta: et similibus illis ex rebus multis.	The things therefore by which wounds are made very often, are such as a stone cast: or the cutting of a sword: or knife: or a blow with a spear, or wood, or arrow: and similar things from many such.
Vulnera autem quae fiunt secundum loca corporis sunt, sicut uulnus quod cadit super caput, aut collum, aut pectus, aut uentrem, aut epar: et similia ex eis membris.	Wounds that are made according to the places of the body are, such as a wound that falls upon the head, or neck, or chest, or belly, or thigh: and similar ones from those limbs.
Et ego sum narrans curationes quorundam uulnerum, ut ponam eam ratiocinationem et regulam super reliqua uulnera.	And I am telling of the treatments of some wounds, that I may put that reasoning and rule over the rest of the wounds.
Et ego incipiam a uulneribus capitis simplicibus: quoniam rememoratio compositorum ueniet in principio capituli tertii.	And I begin with simple head wounds: for the memory of compositions will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
Dico ergo.	Therefore I say.
Quando accidit in capite uulnus simplex, et non est fractura ossis: considera tunc, si est ex iactu lapidis, aut ei similibus, et iam fregit cutem tantum: et est uulnus magnum, et times super infirmum euentum apostematis calidi: tunc propera, et phlebotoma cephalicam statim: et non tardes illud: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius: si non fuerit prohibens aliquid a phlebotomia, praecipue si fuerit sanguis qui egreditur ex uulnere paucus.	When a simple wound occurs in the head and there is no fracture of the bone: consider then, if it is from a stone thrown or something similar, and has only broken the skin: and the wound is large, and fear the bad outcome of a hot abscess: then hurry, and immediately perform a cephalic phlebotomy: and do not delay this: and draw out of it blood according to the quantity of its power: if nothing prohibits phlebotomy, especially if it is blood that flows from the wound little.
Et sit phlebotomia ex contrario partis uulneratae.	And let phlebotomy be performed from the opposite side of the wound.
Et caueat infirmus sibi a repletione, et uino, et cibis grossis.	And let the sick person beware of repletion, and wine, and heavy foods.
Si autem minutionem prohibet aliquid, tunc minoretur ex cibo, et non appropinquet carnibus, neque uinis.	If something prevents a reduction, then it should be reduced by food, and it should not be brought near meats, nor wine.
Et pone super uulnus si accidit ei apostema calidum, cotum infusum in oleo rosato solo, aut cum uino in quo est stipticitas.	And place over the wound if a hot abscess occurs, a poultice infused in rose oil alone, or with wine in which there is astringency.
Si autem securus fueris ab apostemate calido, tunc pone super uulnus, si est recens cum sanguine suo, et non mutauit ipsum aer, puluerem quem ego narrabo post paululum: et si iam mutauit ipsum aer, tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, donec sanetur.	If you are certain about the hot boil, then place over the wound, if it is fresh with its blood, and has not yet changed the air, the powder which I will tell you about after a little while: and if it has already changed the air, then place on it some ointment until it heals.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, aut est ex incisione ensis, et similium: et non aggregantur labia eius per puluillos, tunc aggrega ipsa cum sutura, secundum quod ego narrabo in uulneribus uentris de sutura eorum.	If, however, the wound is large, or is from a sword cut, and similar things: and its lips do not gather together by means of little threads, then gather them themselves with sutures, according to what I shall tell in wounds of the belly about their sutures.
Si autem uulnus iam detectum est ab osse, et pendet, et non est retentio eius, nisi in suspensorio paruo: tunc incide ipsum.	If now a wound has been detected by the bone, and it hangs, and there is no retention of it, except in a small suspension; then cut into it.
Deinde cura uulnus cum medicinis, et restaura in eo carnem duram loco cutis, et praecipe infirmo, ut alatur cibis in quibus est grossitudo, sicut sunt capita, et triticum coctum, donec sit ut puls: et eis similia.	Then care for the wound with medicines, and restore in it hard flesh in the place of skin, and instruct the infirm person to be nourished with foods that are thick, such as heads and cooked wheat, until it is like porridge; and similar things.
Quod si inuenis in cute putrefactionem, et non adhaeret ossi: tunc incide putrefactum totum, et proiice ipsum: deinde cura illud.	If you find in the skin putrefaction, and it does not adhere to bone, then cut out the whole putrefaction, and throw it away; then take care of it.
Si autem in his uulneribus est arteria, aut uena ex qua fluit sanguis: et non abscinditur per medicinas, tunc inquire super arteriam.	If in these wounds is an artery or a vein from which blood flows, and it is not cut by medicines, then inquire about the artery.
Si ergo inuenis eam non sectam, tunc seca eam cum Spatumili, aut liga eam.	If therefore you find it not cut, then cut it with a Spatula, or bind it.
Quod si necessitas prouocat quando non confert illud quod diximus, tunc cauteriza eam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If necessity provokes when that which we said does not help, then cauterize it until the blood is cut off.
Si autem uulnera ista sunt parua, simplicia, tunc res eorum est facilis, leuis: ita ut puluerizes super ea hunc puluerem: quoniam consolidat ea antequam mutet ea aer.	If these wounds are small and simple, then their treatment is easy and light: so that you apply this powder over them; because it consolidates them before they change in air.
¶ Modus Pulueris incarnatiui.	Mode of Powdered Flesh.
Recipe olibani partem unam, et sanguinis draconis partes duas, et calcis non extinctae partes tres: teratur totum multum, et cribelletur: et impleatur ex eo uulnus, et constringatur constrictione bona, donec adhaereat super ipsum bene, et coaguletur cum sanguine.	Take one part of olibanum, two parts of dragon's blood, and three parts of unburnt quicklime: grind the whole thing thoroughly, and sift it: then fill a wound with it, and constrict it well with a good band until it adheres well to it and clots with the blood.
Deinde stringe ipsum desuper cum puluillis, et dimitte ipsum, neque soluas ipsum dum permanet, ita quod non apostemetur.	Then bind it above with pads and release it, and do not loosen it while it remains, so that it does not gape open.
Nam non eradicatur ab eo medicina, donec sanatur.	For it is not removed from him medicine, until he is healed.
Et quandoque facit illud calx sola, quando non sunt tibi in praesenti olibanum, et sanguis draconis etiam facit eandem operationem in multis ex uulneribus magnis, quando conuenit ut ponatur super ea et stringantur, et sunt uulnera recentia cum sanguine suo, quae non alterauit aer.	And sometimes it does this alone, when you do not have frankincense at hand, and dragon's blood also performs the same operation in many of the large wounds, when it is suitable to be placed upon them and bound, and are fresh wounds with their own blood, which has not been changed by air.
Quod si iam alterauit ea aer quadam alteratione, praecipue quando est in tempore aestatis, tunc non est in positione huius pulueris intentio: cura ergo ipsum cum eo quod diximus, ita ut ponas super ea quaedam unguenta digestiua: aut ponas super ea pultes ex farina hordei, factas cum aqua et melle, donec emittant pus.	If it has already been changed by some kind of alteration, especially when it is in summer time, then there is no point in the application of this powder: therefore take care of it with what we have said, so that you place on top of it some medicinal ointments: or place on top of it poultices made from barley flour, mixed with water and honey, until they discharge pus.
Deinde cura ea reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then care for the rest of the treatment until they are healed.
Si uero accidat cum uulnere fractura in osse, et est parua, tunc extrahe illud cum Gesti: et ego iam dicam curationem fracturarum capitis in eo quod futurum est.	If it happens with a wound and fracture in the bone, and it is small, then remove it with forceps; and now I will speak about the cure of fractures of the head as it will be later on.
¶ De uulneribus Colli.	On wounds of the neck.
Caput LXXXV.	Chapter LXXXV.
SI Autem uulnus accidat in Collo, tunc non est inter ipsum differentia in medicatione, et inter uulnus capitis quando est simplex.	If a wound occurs in the neck, then there is no difference in treatment between it and a wound on the head when it is simple.
Si autem iam incisus est neruus Colli, aut arteria: tunc si est neruus, non est in eo ingenium, nisi ut deuitetur curatio eius cum eo quod facit stipticitatem uehementem, sicut ziniar, et zegi, et eis similia.	If a nerve of the neck or an artery has already been cut, if it is a nerve, there is no use in curing it unless its treatment is carried out with something that causes strong clotting, such as ziniar and zegi and similar things.
Quoniam nocent neruis, et contrahunt eos.	Because they harm nerves and contract them.
Et non ponas super uulnus aliquid frigidum omnino: quoniam substantia neruorum est frigida, et continuatio eius est cum cerebro, quod est sublimius membrorum: et sit illud quo curatur ex medicinis lene, sicut calx lota cum aqua dulci aliquotiens infusa cum oleo, aut cum oleo rosato, et tuthia, quando abluitur etiam cum aqua dulci: et reliqui lapides minerales, secundum hunc modum, et unguenta humida.	And you shall not place anything cold upon the wound at all; because the substance of nerves is cold, and its continuation is with the brain, which is most sublime of the members; and let it be treated as healed with medicines mild, such as chalk washed with sweet water several times infused with oil, or with rose oil, and turpentine, and when it is also washed with sweet water: and other mineral stones, in this way, and moist ointments.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, tunc administra suturam: aut coarta labia eius cum puluillis.	If the wound is large, then administer sutures: or tie together its edges with a ligature.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for him until he heals.
Si uero uulneri est profunditas, aut accidit in eo sinus in inferiori parte eius, in quo iam aggregatur pus, tunc perfora ipsum in magis depresso loco in eo.	If now the depth of a wound is great, or if there is a cavity in the lower part of it, in which pus has already gathered, then pierce it in a more depressed place within it.
Quod si iam incisa est in uulnere arteria, et consecutus est sanguinem eius fluxus: tunc separa, uel seca eam, et liga ipsam: aut cauteriza eam, si prouocat necessitas ad illud.	If already cut in a wound is an artery and its blood flow has been followed, then separate, or dry it, and bind it: or cauterize it if necessity requires it.
Si autem iam incidit spondiles gutturis, aut totum, et saluatae sunt alhaudegi: tunc aggrega labia cutis cum sutura super cannam gutturis, et non tangas guttur, imo aequa ipsum, et reduc ipsum super figuram naturalem.	If now the spondele of the throat has fallen in, or the whole, and the wounds have been healed: then gather the lips of skin with suture above the stem of the throat, and do not touch the throat, indeed make it equal to itself, and reduce it back to its natural figure.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti, et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot.	Then tighten it with a proper bandage, and leave it for several days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis in quibus est stipticitas et exiccatio, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with an ointment that has astringency and drying properties until it heals.
Si autem uulnus iam fecit impressionem in osse, tunc perquire ipsum: tunc si in ipso sunt fragmenta ossis, extrahe ea omnia, aut quae potes ex eis: et quod non praeparatur, dimitte illud, donec putrescat uulnus, et separetur et alleuietur egressio eius.	If the wound has already made an impression on the bone, then examine it; and if there are fragments of bone in it, remove all of them, or as many as you can; and what cannot be prepared, leave it until the wound putrefies, and its discharge separates and is relieved.
Quod si uulnus fuerit recens, tunc pulueriza super ipsum puluerem quem narraui.	If the wound is fresh, then sprinkle powder on it which I have recounted.
Si autem uidetur in uulnere os, et fit Fistula: tunc cura ipsam cum eo cuius rememoratio uenit in capitulo suo.	If however a bone is seen in the wound, and a fistula forms, then care for it with that one whose memory comes to mind in its chapter.
¶ De uulnere in Spatulis.	On a wound in the armpits.
Caput LXXXVI.	Chapter LXXXVI.
SI Est percussio lanceae, aut cultelli: et uides eius profunditatem, tunc considera.	If it is a wound from a lance or knife, and you see its depth, then consider it.
Si ergo ex uulnere egreditur uentositas, quando anhelat ex eo infirmus, tunc scias, quia uulnus est mortale.	If therefore wind proceeds from the wound, when he breathes out of it who is ill, then know that the wound is mortal.
Quod si non fuerit ei profunditas, et est recens cum sanguine suo: tunc non ponas in eo a prima hora puluerem, neque stringas ipsum, ut non retineatur sanguis in profunditate eius, et reuertatur ad cor, et interficiat infirmum: sed pone in ipso unguentum attractiuum, et solue ipsum in die bis.	If it is not deep and is fresh with its own blood: then do not put powder in it from the first hour, nor bind it, so that the blood is not retained in its depth, and returns to the heart, and kills the sick person; but put ointment on it, and dissolve it twice a day.
Si uero unguentum non est tibi praesens, tunc pone in orificio uulneris cotum uetustum, ut sugat illud quod egreditur de eo ex humiditatibus: et fac ut dormiat infirmus super uulnus, ut currat quod aggregatur in eo.	If ointment is not present to you, then put into the opening of the wound a worn cloth, so that it may draw out what comes forth from it from the moistures; and make that the sick person sleep upon the wound, so that it may heal which gathers in it.
Si uero iam praeterierint uulneri tres dies, aut plures, et non accidit infirmo spasmus, neque tremor cordis malus, neque strictura in anhelitu, et uides reliquas dispositiones eius bonas: tunc scias, quia uulnus est saluum.	If now three days or more have passed from the wound, and no spasms occur to the sick person, nor an evil tremor of the heart, nor stricture in breathing, and you see the rest of his dispositions good, then know that the wound is safe.
Cura ergo ipsum et cum liciniis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Therefore care for it itself and with permissions, and the rest of the cure, until it is healed.
Si uero excusatur sanatio eius, et iam aperitur semper, tunc scias, quia iam factum est Fistula.	If, however, healing is excluded and it is always opened, then know that a fistula has already been made.
Cura ergo ipsam ex capitulo suo.	Therefore, care for it from its own chapter.
Et si uulnus est ex incisione ensis, aut cultelli, et est simplex in superficie pectoris, aut dorsi: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit ex sutura, si est magnum: aut cum puluere, si est paruum.	And if the wound is from a sword or knife cut and is simple on the surface of the chest or back: then treat it with what preceded regarding suture, if it is large; or with powder, if it is small.
Si autem iam fecit impressionem in osse, et incidit ex eo frusta: tunc inquire uulnus, et propera ad extrahendum illa frusta, si sunt separata.	If, however, he has already made an imprint in the bone, and a fragment has come out of it: then inquire about the wound, and hasten to remove those fragments, if they are separated.
Si uero non sunt separata, tunc dimitte ea, donec putrefiat uulnus, alleuiatur enim extractio eorum.	If they are not separated, then leave them until the wound putrefies, for extraction will be easier.
Reliquorum autem uulnerum accidentium in reliquis membris iudicium in curatione, est iudicium eius quod diximus.	The judgment of accidents of wounds in the remaining members is in the cure as we said.
¶ De uulneribus Ventris, et exitu intestini, et exitura eorum.	On wounds of the abdomen and the exiting of the intestines, and their emergence.
Caput LXXXVII.	Chapter LXXXVII.
Disruptio quae accidit uentri, est magna, et media, et parua.	The rupture which happens to the belly, is great, and medium, and small.
Ex magna igitur quandoque egreditur intestinum, aut numerus intestinorum.	Therefore, sometimes a large intestine, or number of intestines, emerges.
Quare fit intromissio eorum, et eorum sutura uehementior et difficilior.	Therefore it is made with an introduction of them, and their sewing stronger and more difficult.
Et disruptio parua etiam fit difficilis ex modo alio.	And a small rupture is also difficult to repair in another way.
Sequitur ergo, ut sit reductio eorum difficilior, si non properas in intromissione sua ad locum suum statim: quoniam inflatur, aperitur, et ingrossatur: quare fit difficilis introitus eius.	Therefore, it follows that the reduction is more difficult if you do not hasten in its introduction to its place immediately; because it inflames, opens, and grows larger; therefore the entrance into it becomes difficult.
Propter hoc ergo fit melior disruptionum disruptio media: quoniam cum ea non fit difficilis reductio intestini, sicut fit dissicilis in his duabus speciebus.	Therefore, a middle disruption of ruptures is better because with it the reduction of the intestine is not difficult, as it is in these two kinds.
Scias, quod sutura uenris est secundum quatuor modos.	Know that the suture of the vulva is according to four modes.
Duae suturae communes conueniunt in sutura uentris, et in sutura reliquorum uulnerum corporis: et duae suturae aliae proprie communicant reliquis uulneribus.	Two common sutures are used in the suture of the abdomen, and in the suture of other wounds of the body: and two other sutures properly communicate with the rest of the wounds.
Verumtamen sunt magis propriae cum sutura uentris: et ego narro tibi unamquamque cum expositione, et declaratione.	But they are more proper with sutures of the abdomen: and I tell you each one with an explanation, and a declaration.
Dico ergo, quia quando uulnus est paruum, et egreditur ex eo aliquid ex intestino, et fit difficile reducere ipsum: tunc illud est propter unum duorum modorum.	I say therefore, that when a wound is small and something comes out of it from the intestine, and it is difficult to reduce it: then this is because of one of two modes.
Aut propter paruitatem disruptionis, sicut diximus: Aut quoniam in intestino est inflatio propter frigus aeris.	Or because of the smallness of the rupture, as we have said; or because there is inflation in the intestine because of the coldness of the air.
Quando ergo illud est ita, tunc oportet ut calefacias ipsum, ita ut submergas spongiam, aut pannum humidum in aqua tepida sola.	When therefore that is so, then it is necessary that you heat it, so that you submerge a sponge, or a humid cloth in lukewarm water alone.
Aut decoquas in aqua squinantum, et cyperum, et spicam, et embroces cum ea intestinum, donec resoluatur inflatio.	Or boil it in water with squill, and cypress, and cumin, and embrocations with it the intestine until the inflation is resolved.
Quandoque facit illud uinum in quo est stipticitas: et est melius quam aqua sola in resolutione inflationis.	Sometimes it makes wine which has astringency: and it is better than water alone in resolving swelling.
Cum ergo uides inflationem iam resolui, tunc humecta intestinum cum aqua in qua decocta est altea, aut malua.	When therefore you see that the swelling has already been resolved, then moisten the intestine with water in which the quince or mallow has been boiled.
Nam per illud alleuiatur introitus eius cum re parua.	For that the entrance of it may be eased with a small thing.
Si autem excusatur reditus eius post hanc curationem, tunc finde in disruptione parum, cum instrumento quo secantur hemorrhoides.	If, however, his return is excused after this cure, then find in the rupture a little, with the instrument with which hemorrhoids are cut.
Et curatio prima est melior quando praeparatur, quam sectio: et non fit coactio ad secandum post necessitatem et defectum instrumenti.	And the first cure is better when it is prepared than when it is cut; and no force should be used to cut after necessity and lack of instruments.
Sit pars eius una quae est torta, acuta, et pars eius altera non acuta, et extremitas subtilis non sit cum subtilitate Spatumilis, imo sit obtusior parumper: et est illa quae similatur caiada, sicut uides.	Let there be a part of it which is twisted, sharp, and another part of it not sharp, and the thin end be not as fine as that of a spatula, but rather be a little duller; and it is like a caida, as you see.
Cum ergo amplificatur uulnus, et ingreditur intestinum, tunc oportet, ut sit reductio eius secundum formam suam naturalem in loco suo sibi proprio, si possibile est super illud: quoniam est melius.	When therefore the wound is enlarged and enters the intestines, then it is necessary that there be a reduction of it according to its natural form in its proper place, if possible above it: because it is better.
Quando uero disruptio est ampla in inferiori parte uentris: tunc oportet ut facias iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et pone crura sua altiora capite suo.	When a rupture is widespread in the lower part of the abdomen: then it is necessary that you make the sick person lie on his back, and place his legs higher than his head.
Et si est in superiore parte uentris, tunc pone caput eius, et pectus ipsius altiora quam eius inferiora.	And if it is in the upper part of the belly, then place its head and breast higher than its lower parts.
Et similiter si est disruptio in una duarum partium uentris, tunc pone intentionem tuam, et tuam considerationem semper in hoc, ut pars in qua est uulnus sit altior parte altera.	And similarly if there is a rupture in one of the two parts of the belly, then put your attention and your consideration always on this, that the part in which is the wound be higher than the other part.
Et ita oportet, ut admimistres illud in uulneribus magnis, et in uulneribus mediis.	And so it is necessary that you administer this in large wounds and in medium-sized wounds.
In uulneribus autem paruis, pone illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	In small wounds however, place it as it is prepared for you.
Deinde fac ut sit praesens inter manus tuas minister pius, qui teneat disruptionem totam manu sua: et aggrega labia eius.	Then make it that there be present among your hands a pious assistant, who shall hold the entire rupture with his hand: and bring together its lips.
Deinde detege ex ea ei qui sequitur suturam aliquid post aliquid: et iste est modus suturae communis unius.	Then cover up from that he who follows the suture something after something: and this is the way of common suture of one.
Et est, ut accipias acum, aut numerum acuum secundum quantitatem amplitudinis uulneris.	And it is, as you receive an awl, or a number of awls according to the quantity of width of the wound.
Deinde dimitte ab extremitate disruptionis quantitatem digiti anularis, id est, medici: et fige acum unam praeter quod intromittas in eam filum in duabus extremitatibuis cutis, cum duabus extremitatibus sifac quod est sub cute ab interioribus, donec facias eam penetrare ab alia parte, et tu iam aggregasti duas extremitates cutis, et duas extremitates sifac: et fiunt quatuor ordines.	Then release from the end of the rupture the quantity of the ring finger, that is, of the doctor; and fix one point with a needle, besides which you insert a thread in the two extremities of the skin, with the two extremities of the fascia that is under the skin from the insides, until you make it penetrate from another part, and you have already gathered together two extremities of skin, and two extremities of fascia: and four orders are made.
Deinde stringe cum filo duplo in circumitu acus aliquotiens a duabus partibus simul, quousque sint aggregata duo labia uulneris aggregatione decenti.	Then bind with double thread around the wound, several times from two parts simultaneously, until the two lips of the wound are united by a decent gathering.
Deinde dimitte grossitudinem digiti etiam, et fige in eis acum aliam: postea reta eam cum filo, sicut fecisti cum acu prima.	Then let go of the thickness of the finger also, and place another point in it; afterwards tie it with a thread, as you did with the first point.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum eo quo indiges ex acubus, donec compleas constrictionem uulneris totius.	Therefore, do not cease doing this with him as much as you need from the awl until you complete the constriction of the whole wound.
Et sint acus mediae inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem: quoniam acus subtiles ualde uelociter incidunt carnem: et grossae sunt difficilis introitus in cutem: propter illud oportet ut sint mediae in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	And let the needles be of medium thickness between size and fineness; because fine needles very quickly pierce the flesh: and thick ones are difficult to enter the skin; therefore they ought to be of medium thickness and size.
Et non oportet, ut figatur acus in duabus extremitatibus cutis propinquae multum: ut non incidatur caro uelociter, et aperiatur uulnus ante consolidationem sui, et non elongentur etiam cum sutura, ut non prohibeatur uulnus a consolidatione.	And it is not proper that a needle be fastened in the two extremities of the skin too much: so that flesh may not be cut quickly, and the wound may not open before its consolidation, and also that they may not be lengthened with the suture, so that the wound may not be prevented from consolidation.
Deinde incide extremitatem acuum, ut non laedant infirmum apud somnum suum: et pone eis puluillos ex pannis ab omni parte, qui teneant extremitates acuum: et dimitte eos, donec scias quod uulnus iam consolidatum est.	Then cut the end of the awl so that it does not harm the sick person in his sleep: and put small pads made of cloth on every side of them, which will hold the ends of the awls: and let them go until you know that the wound is already healed.
Et haec quidem species suturae cum acubus taliter est conuenientior in uulneribus paruis.	This kind of suture with needles is more suitable for small wounds.
Quoniam sufficit in sutura eorum acus una, aut duae, aut circiter eas.	For it suffices in stitching them one needle, or two, or about as many.
Sutura autem secunda communis est, ut aggreges cum sutura extremitates quatuor: extremitates, duas cutis, et extremitates duas sifac in uice una, cum acu in qua sit filum inuolutum aequale in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	The second kind of suture is common, as it joins the extremities with four sutures: two extremities of skin and two extremities of fascia in one place, with a needle on which there lies thread equal in fineness and thickness.
Deinde quando penetraueris cum acu has extremitates quatuor, reduc acum a parte a qua incaepisti eadem, ut cadat filum retatum a superiori parte uulneris: ut sit sutura, sicut sutura panni quo stringuntur panni, et pone inter omnem suturam quantitatem grossitudinis digiti minoris.	Then when you have pierced with the point these four extremities, withdraw the point from the part from which you began, so that the thread held up from the superior part of the wound may fall: so that it is a suture, like a suture of cloth that is tightened by tightening cloths, and put between each suture the amount of thickness less than that of the smallest finger.
Hanc autem suturam sciunt homines.	These people know this suture.
Et cum hac sutura ego sui uulnus quod acciderat uiro in uentre suo, qui fuerat uulneratus cum cultello, et erat disruptio uulneris maior palmo uno: et exierat ex intestinis circiter duos palmos ex intestino medio, et erat disruptio in medio uentris.	And with this suture I treated the wound that had happened to a man in his belly, who had been wounded with a knife, and the wound was one palm wide: and about two palms of the intestine had come out from the middle intestine, and there was a rupture in the middle of the belly.
Reduxi ergo illud postquam stetit intestinum eius extra uulnus xxiiii horis.	Therefore I reduced it after having stood the intestine of him outside the wound for twenty-four hours.
Consolidatum est ergo uulnus in spacio quod fuit circiter XV dies: et curaui ipsum, et sanatus est: et uixit post illud annis multis, conuersatus in suis dispositionibus.	Therefore the wound was consolidated in a space of about fifteen days: and I took care of it, and it healed: and he lived after it for many years, converted to his dispositions.
Et medici iudicauerant, quod non sanaretur.	And the physicians had judged that he would not be healed.
Et ex miraculo fuit, quod non curaui illud cum unguento.	And it was a marvel that I did not treat it with ointment.
Quoniam fui in loco in quo non inueniebatur unguentum, neque aliquid ex medicinis.	Because I was in a place where there was no ointment, nor anything of medicines.
Posui ergo super uulnus cotum uetustum bis in die, et assiduaui ablutionem eius cum aqua mellis, donec sanatum est.	Therefore I placed upon the old ulcer a poultice twice a day, and diligently washed it with honeyed water until it was healed.
Duas autem species suturae proprias dicam secundum narrationem sermonis.	I will say two kinds of sutures proper according to the account of speech.
Et est, ut incipias cum sutura acuta: et intromittas acum ab exteriori ad interiorem partem.	And it is, as you begin with a sharp suture: and insert the point from the outer to the inner part.
Cum ergo penetrat acus in cutem, et in lacertum euntem secundum longitudinem et latitudinem totius corporis: dimitte extremitatem sifac in latere in quo intromisisti acum, et fac penetrare in extremitatem aliam ab interiori parte ad exteriorem in extremitate altera mirach.	When therefore a needle penetrates the skin and enters the flesh following the length and width of the whole body: let go of the end of the needle on the side where you inserted it, and make it penetrate into the other end from the interior part to the exterior in the other extremity miraculously.
Cum ergo feceris eam penetrare, tunc fac eam penetrare secundum hoc in eadem hac extremitate mirach ab exteriori parte ad interiorem: et dimitte extremitatem sifac, quae est in hoc latere, et fac penetrare acum in extremitatem alteram ab interiori parte ad exteriorem: et fac penetrare cum penetratione tua qua facis eam penetrare in sifac extremitate mirach, quae est in parte eius, donec penetret in ipsum totum.	When therefore you have made it penetrate, then make it penetrate according to this in the same extremity marvelous from the outside part to the inside: and let go the extremity ifac, which is on this side, and make penetrate the point in the other extremity from the inside part to the outside: and make penetrate with the penetration that you make it penetrate in ifac extremity marvelous, which is in its part, until it penetrates into the whole.
Deinde incipe etiam ab hoc eodem latere, et sue ipsum cum extremitate, quae est ex sifac in latere alio, et extrahe acum ex cute quam penetrauit.	Then begin also from this same side, and sew it with its extremity which is on the other side, and extract the point from the skin which has penetrated it.
Deinde reduc eam in illam cutem, et sue extremitatem sifac, quae est in latere alio, cum hac extremitate mirach: et extrahe eam ex cute quae est ex parte eius, et fac illud uice una, et alia: et fac illud uice post uicem, usquequo suas extrinsecum totum secundum illud exemplum.	Then put it back into that skin, and sew its extremity which is on the other side, with this extremity marvelously: and take it out of the skin which is on its part, and make it one piece, and another: and make it one piece after another, until you have finished all its outer part according to this example.
Et summa huius suturae, est ut suas sutura pellipariorum qua suunt pelles: ita ut suas sifac uice una ex parte una extremitate cutis: et ut dimittas eam uice alia ex parte alia, donec compleas.	And the sum of this suture is that you make your sutures with skins thinner than those which are skins: so that you bring one end to one extremity of the skin and let it go on the other side until you complete it.
Secunda species suturae propriae, quam dixit Gale nus.	The second kind of suture, as Gale has said.
Iste eius sermo narratus est, ut suas eam secundum similitudinem, qua suunt eas quidam medicantium, ita quod aggregant omnem partem ad comparem suam conuenientem per naturam: et applicant extremitatem sifac ad eius aliam extremitatem, et extremitatem mirach ad extremitatem eius aliam.	This speech of his is narrated as if he were to gather together all parts according to the similarity which certain physicians have, so that they gather every part to its own corresponding part by nature; and apply the end of sifac to its other end, and the end of mirach to its other end.
Et illud fit secundum quod narro tibi.	And that is done as I tell you.
Oportet ut figas acum in extremitatem mirach propinquam tibi ab exteriori parte, et facias eam penetrare ad interiorem in eo solo: et dimittas duas extremitates sifac.	You ought to place a sharp point at the end of a trocar near the extremity from the outside, and make it penetrate to the inside in that alone: and let go the two extremities of the trocar.
Deinde reuolue acum, et fac eam penetrare ab exteriori parte ad interiorem in duas extremitates sifac, scilicet utrinque.	Then roll back the point and make it penetrate from the outer part to the inner in two extremities, namely on both sides.
Deinde reuolue utrasque, etiam fac penetrare utrasque ab interiori usque ad exteriorem, in duas extremitates mirach alias, quae sunt in latere opposito.	Then turn both [sides] over, and also make them penetrate from the inner part to the outer, into two opposite extremities.
Et iste modus suturae est melior sutura communi facili, et est sutura cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And this method of suture is a better suture than the common one, and it is the suture whose previous description was given.
Iste est ergo sermo Galeni etiam.	This is therefore also the word of Galen.
Et dixerunt quidam.	And some said.
Retificatur sutura uentris cum duabus acubus.	The suture of the abdomen should be made with two needles.
Quod est, ut intromittas in eis utrisque filum unum: et incipe cum intromissione acus, ex eo quod est apud te, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, secundum suturam eorum qui suunt coria aequaliter.	That is, to introduce into both one thread: and begin with the introduction of a needle, from that which is with you, and make it penetrate to the other side, according to the suture of those who are equally matched skin.
Et scias, quod quando disruptio est in medio uentris: tunc sutura eius est difficilior quam reliquorum locorum uentris.	And know that when a rupture is in the middle of the belly, then its suture is more difficult than of the rest of the places of the belly.
Iudicium uero medicationis uulneris, est iudicium reliquorum uulnerum.	The judgment of treatment of a wound is the judgment of the rest of wounds.
Quod est, quia quando tu consequeris uulnus recens cum sanguine suo, antequam alteret ipsum aer: et reducis intestinum, et suis ipsum, et aptas ipsum: tunc pone super puluerem incarnatiuum.	That is, because when you obtain a fresh wound with its blood, before air alters it; and you reduce the intestine, and your own, and make it fit: then place over it powder of earth.
Quod si aer iam alterauit uulnus: tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, quae sunt tibi praesentia, donec faciant pus: et cadant fila, et consolidentur sifac, et mirach.	If the air has already altered the wound: then place over it some ointment that you have present, until they make pus: and let the strands fall away, and consolidate the skin, and marvel at it.
Deinde cura illud sicut est curatio reliquorum uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it as is the cure of other wounds, until it heals.
Si autem non sunt tibi praesentes medicinae, tunc pone super ipsum statim, exquo incipit emittere pus, cotum uetus: et permuta ipsum bis in die, sicut docui te, donec sanetur.	If medicines are not present to you, then put upon it immediately, from where it begins to emit pus, an old cloth: and change it twice a day, as I have taught you, until it is healed.
Nam tu non indiges medicatione alia in pluribus dispositionibus, quando uulnera sunt simplicia.	For you do not need other medicines in many cases when wounds are simple.
Si autem times, quod communicet uulnus membris principalibus in laesione, tunc oportet ut submergas lanam lenem in oleo temperatae caliditatis, aut in oleo rosato: et pone ipsam in circumitu locorum quae sunt inter inguina, et sub ascellas.	If you fear that the wound will communicate to the principal limbs through injury, then it is necessary to submerge soft wool in oil tempered with warmth, or in rose oil; and place it in the region of the places which are between the groins, and under the armpits.
Quod si sentit dolorem, aut punctiones, aut putrefactionem in intestinis suis (nam multotiens accidit illud) tunc clisteriza ipsum cum uino stiptico, nigro, tepido: praecipue si putredo iam peruenit in intestino, et facta est exitura penetrans usque ad concauitatem eius.	If he feels pain, or punctures, or putrefaction in his bowels (for this often happens), then cleanse him with a wine clyster, thick, black, warm: especially if the rot has already reached the intestine, and an exit wound has been made reaching to its concavity.
Et scias, quod illud quod est ex intestino grosso, est facilioris sanationis: et quod ex eis est ex subtili, difficilioris sanationis.	And know that what is from the large intestine is of easier healing; and that which is from those finer ones is of more difficult healing.
Intestinum autem quod nominatur Ieiunum, non suscipit sanationem ex uulnere quod accidit in eo omnino: et illud est propter multitudinem eius, quod est ex uenis, et magnitudine earum, et propter subtilitatem corporis eius, et propinquitatem ipsius naturae neruorum.	The intestine called the jejunum does not receive healing from a wound that happens in it at all: and this is because of its multitude, which is from veins, and its magnitude, and because of the subtlety of its body, and the closeness of its nature to nerves.
Si autem illud quod procedit ex uulnere est zirbum, et consequeris ipsum recens: reduc ipsum secundum reductionem tuam, qua reducis intestina aequaliter.	If what proceeds from the wound is a zither, and you find it fresh: reduce it according to your reduction, which you use to reduce intestines evenly.
Si uero praeteriit ei spacium, et iam factum est uiride, aut nigrum: tunc oportet ut stringas ipsum cum filo supra locum qui denigratus est ex eo, ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	If, however, the space has passed and it is already green or black: then it is necessary that you tie it with a thread above the place which has darkened from it, so that there does not occur a flow of blood.
In zirbo enim sunt uenae et arteriae.	In the wrist there are veins and arteries.
Deinde incide quod est praeter illud ligamentum, et pone duas extremitates fili pendentes ex inferiori parte uulneris extra ipsum: ut alleuietur super te attractio eius, et extractio ipsius apud casum zirbi, et emissionem pus uulneris.	Then cut what is beyond that ligament, and place two pendant thread ends from the lower part of the wound outside it: so that the traction on top of you may be relieved, and its extraction in case of a zirbi, and the discharge of pus from the wound.
¶ Rememoratio uulneris quod accidit in Intestino.	Remembering a wound that happened in the intestines
Quando accidit disruptio in Intestino, et est parua: tunc possibile est, ut restauretur in quibusdam hominibus: propterea, quia ego uidi qui fuit uulneratus in uentre suo cum percussione lanceae, et erat uulnus a dextra stomachi, et antiquatum est uulnus: et factum Fistula, et exiuit ex eo egestio, et uentositas.	When rupture occurs in the intestine and is small, it is possible for it to be restored in some people; because I saw someone who was wounded in his belly with a blow from a lance, and the wound was on the right side of the stomach, and the wound was old; and a fistula was made, and discharge and flatulence came out of it.
Posui ergo curationem, usque quod ego non fui confisus in sanatione eius: neque cessaui subtiliare ipsum, donec sanatus est, et consolidatus est locus.	Therefore I made treatment until I was not confident in his healing; and I did not cease to treat him carefully until he was healed and the place was consolidated.
Postquam ego uidi locum iam consolidatum, timui super infirmum, quod accideret super infirmum accidens malum in uentre suo: et non accidit ei ex illo accidens malum.	After I saw that the place was already consolidated, I feared for the weak part, that an evil accident might happen to the weak part in his belly: and no evil accident happened to him from that.
Et remansit in melioribus dispositionibus suis, comedens et bibens, et futuens, et intrauit balneum, et exercitatus est in dietis suis.	And he remained in better dispositions, eating and drinking, and resting, and entered the bath, and exercised in his diets.
Et iam dixerunt quidam experimentatorum, quia quando accidit in Intestino uulnus, et est paruum: tunc oportet ut ligetur secundum hunc modum.	And now some experimenters have said that when a wound happens in the intestine and it is small, then it ought to be ligated according to this method.
Et est, ut accipias formicas magnorum capitum.	And it is, as you would take ants of large heads.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, et pone formicam unam ex eis quae habeant os apertum super duo labia uulneris.	Then gather together the two lips of the wound, and place a single ant with an open mouth on top of the two lips of the wound.
Cum ergo capit super ea, et stringit os suum, abscinde caput eius, adhaeret enim, et non soluitur.	When therefore he takes hold of it and tightens his mouth, cut off its head, for it adheres and does not loosen.
Deinde pone formicam aliam prope primam, et non cesses facere illud cum formica post formicam secundum quantitatem uulneris totius.	Then place another ant near the first one, and do not cease doing this with an ant after each ant according to the quantity of the entire wound.
Deinde reduc ipsum, et sue uulnus.	Then reduce it and suture the wound.
Illa enim capita remanent annexa in Intestino, donec cibetur Intestinum, et sanetur, et non accidat infirmo nocumentum penitus.	For those heads remain attached in the intestines until the intestines are fed and healed, and no further harm befalls the sick person.
Et iam possibile est, ut ligetur Intestinum etiam cum filo subtili: quod abstersum est ex intestino animalis, annexo cum eo postquam intromittitur in acum.	And now it is possible to suture the intestine even with a fine thread: which has been taken from the intestine of an animal and attached to it after it is inserted into the needle.
Et est, ut accipias extremitatem huius fili ex intestino, et excarnetur multum.	And it is, that you may take the end of this thread from the intestine, and it shall be much un-fleshed.
Deinde liga in extremitate eius filum lini subtile inuolutum.	Then a ligature at its extremity with a fine thread of linen wrapped.
Deinde intromitte illud filum in acum, et sue cum eo intestinum.	Then introduce that thread into the point, and sew with it the intestine.
Deinde reduc ipsum in disruptionem.	Then reduce it back into its parts.
Et iste modus suturae cum formicis et intestino, non est nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	And this method of suturing with ants and intestine is only according to the way of trust and hope.
Scias, uulnus quod est magnum, amplum, praecipue si est in uno intestinorum gracilium: tunc non est ingenium nisi subtiliatio, neque est eius sanatio omnino.	Know that a wound which is large and wide, especially if it is in one of the slender intestines, then there is no skill except subtlety, and there is no cure at all.
¶ De cura Zuchemen, et Fistularum.	On the care of fistulas and carbuncles.
Caput LXXXVIII.	Chapter LXXXVIII.
Scias, quod omne uulnus, aut apostema quando ueterascit et antiquatur, et fit ulcus, et non consolidatur, et emittit pus semper, et non abscinditur: tunc nominatur uniuersaliter in quocunque membro fuerit Fistula, et nos nominamus ipsum Zuchemen.	Know that every wound, or abscess when it grows old and becomes antiquated, and becomes an ulcer, and does not heal, and emits pus always, and is not cut off: then it is called universally in any limb a fistula, and we call it Zuchemen.
Et Fistula quidem est secundum ueritatem nodatio filtrata, dura, alba: cum qua non est dolor, cui est concauitas pennae auis: et propter illud nominant eam quidam Risati, id est, pennam.	And a fistula indeed is truly a knot filtered, hard, white: with which there is no pain, to which there is the concavity of a bird's feather: and because of this some call it Risati, that is, feather.
Et est in quibusdam horis humida, quae emittit pus.	And there are some hours which are moist, that it emits pus.
Et fortasse scinditur humiditas in quibusdam horis.	And perhaps moisture is divided in certain hours.
Et quandoque est haec humiditas multa, et est pauca: et est grossa, et est subtilis.	And sometimes this humidity is much, and sometimes little; and it is coarse, and sometimes fine.
Et ego iam praemisi in diuisione, tunc cum dixi uulnera, quod omne ulcus quod non sanatur, neque nascitur in eo caro, non est illud nisi propter unam nouem caussarum.	And I have already said in the division, when I spoke of wounds, that every ulcer which does not heal, and in which no flesh is born, is not because of one new cause.
Quarum una est, aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore: aut propter maliciam eius: aut quoniam inter ipsum, et super labia eius est caro dura, prohibens natiuitatem carnis: aut quia est multae sordis et sordiciei: aut quoniam ulcus in seipso est putridum, et materia quae mittitur ei est malae qualitatis: aut quoniam medicina est inconueniens in curatione eius: aut quoniam corruptio cadens in regione est genus pestilentiae, aut per proprietatem in regione, sicut accidit in Caesaraugusta: in qua fit difficilis digestio aegritudinum, et tardatur in ea sanatio apostematum per naturam: aut quoniam in eo est os unum, aut numerus ossium.	One of these is because of the small amount of blood in the body; or because of its malice; or because between it and above its lips there is hard flesh, preventing the birth of flesh; or because there is a lot of dirt and filth; or because an ulcer within itself is putrid, and the matter sent to it is of bad quality; or because the medicine is unsuitable in its treatment; or because corruption falling in the region is a type of plague; or because of the property of the region, as happens in Caesaraugusta; where digestion of illnesses is difficult, and the healing of abscesses is delayed by nature; or because it has one bone, or a number of bones.
Et ego iam ostendi omnes istas caussas et signa earum, et curationes ipsarum cum medicinis in diuisione: et oportet hic ut faciam te scire curationem Fistulae et Zuken, quae fit per uiam operationis cum manu.	And I have now shown all these causes and signs of them, and their cures with medicines in division: and it is necessary here that I make you know the cure of Fistula and Zuken, which is done by way of operation with the hand.
Scias ergo, quod Fistula accidit in omnibus membris corporis.	Know therefore that fistula occurs in all members of the body.
Nam ex eis sunt Fistulae quae perueniunt ad uenas magnas et arterias, aut neruos, aut sifac: aut ad intestinum, aut ad uesicam, aut ad aliquam ex costis: aut ad aliquam ex spondilibus dorsi, aut ad aliquam iuncturarum compositarum compositione: sicut manus, et pedis: et ex eis sunt quae uadunt ad propinquitatem membri principalis, et similium.	For among these are fistulas that come to the large veins and arteries, or nerves, or fascia, or to the intestine, or bladder, or to one of the ribs, or to one of the vertebrae of the back, or to one of the joints composed in composition: such as the hands, and feet: and from these there are those that go to the proximity of the principal member, and similar ones.
Quae ergo ex his Fistulis est secundum hunc modum, est ex aegritudinibus difficilis sanationis, et non recipit curationem, et occupatio cum ea est labor et ignorantia.	Therefore, according to this method, fistulas are from ailments difficult to heal and do not receive treatment, and dealing with them is labor and ignorance.
Quod si est ex Fistulis aliqua cuius profunditas non peruenit ad haec loca quae dixi: et speras, et confidis in curatione eius, et uis peruenire ad cognitionem illius, tunc accipe tentam ex aere, aut ferro, si Fistula tendit secundum rectitudinem, et perquire eam cum ipsa.	If it is from a fistula of which the depth does not reach these places which I have said: and you hope, and trust in its cure, and wish to reach the knowledge of it, then take a probe of copper, or iron, if the fistula extends in a straight line, and examine it with it.
Si autem in Fistula est tortuositas, tunc inuestiga eam cum tenta de plumbo subtili.	If there is a winding shape in a fistula, then investigate it with a thin lead probe.
Quoniam plumbum cum lenitate sui corporis alleuiatur, et curuatur circa tortuositatem.	Because lead, because of the softness of its body, is lifted and bent around a curve.
Quod si Fistula est habens orificia multa, non est tibi possibile ut significes super eam cum tenta.	If a fistula has many openings, it is not possible for you to point to it with a probe.
Clisteriza ergo ex eis orificium ex orificiis suis.	Therefore, make a clyster from those openings out of their openings.
Nam humiditas qua clisterizas ipsum, uadit uersus orificia alia, et currit ex eis.	For humidity which you apply with a clyster into it, flows through other openings and runs out of them.
Deinde exquisite inquire secundum quem modum est tibi possibile: ut cognoscas quod illic est os, aut neruus, et est Fistulae concauitas longinqua, aut propinqua: aut est Fistula una cui sunt orificia multa, et sta super totum illud, cum summa fortitudinis tuae: cum interrogatione tua, qua interrogas infirmum, et inuentione doloris apud compressionem cum manu tua super locum, et similibus ex significationibus et caussis accidentibus apostemati.	Then inquire carefully according to the way it is possible for you: so that you may know whether there is a bone or a nerve, and whether the fistula's cavity is distant or near: or whether it is one fistula which has many openings, and stay over all of it, with the utmost strength of yours: with your questioning, by whom you question the sick person, and finding pain upon compression with your hand on the place, and similar signs and causes of accidents to abscess.
Cum ergo steteris super omnia illa statione uera, tunc uade ad curationem secundum confidentiam: et est, ut consideres tunc, si est Fistula propinqua apparens, aut in loco saluo longinquo a iunctura, aut a neruo, aut arteria, aut uena, aut uno locorum quae dixi tibi: tunc seca Fistulam secundum quod praemissum est ex narratione mea, et aufer quod est in ea ex filtratione, et carnibus corruptis, quod nascitur in orificio eius ex carne, aut thelul, et similibus: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	When therefore you stand over all these things truly, then go to the cure according to confidence: and it is, that you consider then, if there is a Fistula appearing nearby, or in a place safe far from the joint, or from the nerve, or artery, or vein, or one of the places which I told you: then dry the Fistula according to what was previously stated from my narration, and remove what is in it from the filtration, and corrupted flesh, which is born in its opening from flesh, or pus, and similar things: and take care of it until it heals.
Si autem Fistula est longinquae profunditatis, et est secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut seces eam in profundo quantum est tibi possibile.	If however the fistula is of great depth, and is according to straightness, then it is necessary that you cut it in depth as much as is possible for you.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex omnibus carnibus eius corruptis.	Then cleanse it from all its corrupted flesh.
Deinde administra licinia inuoluta in medicinis acutis: et intromitte ea usque ad concauitatem Fistulae quam comprehendisti cum ferro: fac cum ea illud aliquotiens, donec corrodat medicina acuta totum quod remansit in concauitate Fistulae ex corruptione.	Then administer a linen cloth wrapped in sharp medicines: and introduce it as far as the cavity of the fistula which you comprehended with iron: do this several times until the sharp medicine corrodes all that remains in the cavity of the fistula from corruption.
Deinde restaura ipsam cum unguentis quae generant carnem sanam, donec sanetur.	Then restore it with ointments that generate healthy flesh until it heals.
Si uero non sanatur per illud, tunc cauteriza ipsam secundum quod narrauimus.	If it does not heal by that means, then cauterize it according to what we have narrated.
Si ergo caussa Fistulae est os, et certificatur apud te illud: tunc inquire ipsum, et seca ipsum secundum quod narraui tibi: si non prohibet te aliquid ex uena, aut neruo, aut membro principali, sicut diximus.	If therefore the cause of the fistula is bone, and it is confirmed to you; then inquire into it, and dry it according to what I have told you; if nothing hinders you from a vein, or nerve, or principal member, as we have said.
Si ergo detegitur tibi os, et est in eo quiddam corruptionis, et nigredinis: tunc rade ipsum, donec auferatur corruptio eius tota.	If therefore a bone is shown to you, and there is something of corruption and blackness in it: then scrape it, until the whole corruption is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for him with it that he may be healed until it is incorporated.
Quod si non sanatur, et emittat pus sicut faciebat: tunc scias, quod tu non peruenisti ad totam eradicationem corruptionis.	If it does not heal and discharges pus as it used to do: then you will know that you have not arrived at the complete eradication of corruption.
Detege ergo super illud secundo, et exquisite fac rasionem eius, et mundificationem ipsius cum ultima fortitudine tua.	Therefore, cleanse it again carefully, and make a precise reason for it, and purify it with your utmost strength.
Deinde restaura ipsum.	Then restore him.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est: et si non, tunc scias quod illa corruptio est in profunditate longinqua corporis, quam non es consecutus.	If therefore it heals, it is good; and if not, then you know that that corruption is in the deep distant part of the body, which you have not reached.
Non est ergo tibi in ea ingenium, nisi dimittere ipsam naturae.	Therefore there is no skill for you in it, unless you leave it to nature.
Quod si corruptum est os paruum, et est possibile tibi, attrahe ipsum cum forficibus subtilibus quae conueniunt ad illud.	If a small bone is broken, and it is possible for you, draw it together with fine forceps that are suitable for it.
Si autem sunt ossa multa, tunc exquisite fac attractionem eorum omnium, neque dimittas ex eis aliquid cum tua fortitudine.	If there are many bones, then make an exact traction of them all, and do not let anything slip from them with your strength.
Si uero contrarietatem facit tibi aliquid ex humiditatibus, et non est in incisione eorum timor, uel error: tunc incide illas humiditates et carnes, si sunt illic, et libera ossa.	If something is hindering you from the dampness and there is no fear or mistake in the incision of it, then cut those dampnesses and flesh, if they are there, and free the bones.
Si uero non est tibi praeparatio auferendi ossa ex hora tua, tunc pone super uulnus quod putrefaciat ipsum: et dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat quod est in circumitu illorum ossium ex carnibus et humiditatibus.	If you do not have the preparation to remove the bone from your hour, then place over the wound that it may rot; and dismiss it until it rots what is around those bones of flesh and moisture.
Et custodi uulnus ut non consolidetur.	And guard the wound so that it does not close up.
Et constringatur sectio quam tu secuisti in operatione tua.	And the section which you cut in your operation should be tightened.
Imo pone super ipsum, si times, cotum submersum sulfure trito cum oleo: aut cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio, aut aliquo unguentorum uiridium.	If you are afraid, place on top of it a sponge submerged in sulfur rubbed with oil: or a sponge submerged in Egyptian ointment, or some ointment of viridity.
Nam quando putrefient illae scilicet humiditates, et separantur ex eis ossa, alleuiatur ablatio eorum, et ipsorum attractio.	For when those humidities rot, and the bones separate from them, the removal of them is eased, and their drawing out.
Si autem est os unum magnum, sicut os cruris, aut os coxae, et similia illis, et quod ex eo corruptum est, est pars magna: tunc rade ipsum rasione ultima, donec auferatur illa nigredo et corruptio.	If it is a large single bone, such as the femur or hip bone, and similar to these, and that which has been corrupted from it is a large part, then carefully remove it with the last rasp until the blackness and corruption are removed.
Deinde restaura uulnus.	Then restore the wound.
Si uero quod est in eo corruptum, est pars magna, et corruptio iam consecuta est medullam ossis, tunc necesse est serrare ipsum, et incidere ipsum totum usque ad locum, ubi peruenit corruptio: tunc cura ipsum, donec consolidetur.	If now what is in it is corrupted, a large part is corrupted, and the corruption has already reached the bone marrow, then it is necessary to saw it, and cut it entirely until the place where the corruption reaches: then care for it until it solidifies.
Et ego narro tibi zuken, quae accidit uiro in crure suo: ut ponas ipsam exemplum et adiutorium super operationem tuam.	And I tell you, zekken, which happened to a man in his leg: that you may put this same example and help above your operation.
Fuit uir iuuenis aetate circiter triginta annos, cui accidit dolor in crure suo, a caussa quae mota est super ipsum intra corpus, id est, ab interioribus, donec peruenerunt materiae ad crus, et apostematum est apostemate magno: et non fuit ei caussa extrinseca.	There was a young man, about thirty years of age, to whom pain came in his leg, caused by something that moved into it from within the body, that is, from the insides, until the matter reached the leg, and he had a large abscess: and there was no external cause for it.
Extensum est ergo cum eo tempus cum errore medicorum, donec apertum est apostema, et concurrerunt cum eo materiae multae.	Therefore, time was extended with him due to the error of the doctors until a boil opened and many materials gathered with it.
Et postposita est curatio eius, donec fistulatum est crus, et facta sunt in eo orificia multa: quae omnia emittebant pus, et humiditates corporis.	And after the treatment had been applied, until the leg was fistulated, and many openings were made in it: which all emitted pus, and the humors of the body.
Curauit ergo ipsum multitudo medicorum circiter duos annos, et non fuit in eo sapiens in arte manus, donec uocatus sum, et uidi crus eius, et materias quae currebant ex illis orificiis cursu magno: etiam omne uiri corpus iam tabuerat, et color eius citrinus erat.	Therefore a multitude of physicians treated him for about two years, and there was no wise man in the art of hands until I was called, and I saw his leg, and the materials that flowed from those openings with great flow: also all the body of the man had already wasted away, and its color was yellowish.
Intromisi ergo tentam in uno locorum orificiorum, et peruenit tenta ad os.	I therefore introduced a probe into one of the places of openings, and the probe reached the mouth.
Deinde perscrutatus sum orificia omnia: et inueni ea peruenire ad se inuicem ex omnibus partibus cruris.	Then I carefully examined all the openings: and I found them to be connected with each other from all parts of the leg.
Properaui ergo, et secui super unum illorum orificiorum, donec detexi partem ossis: et inueni ipsum corruptum: quod iam corrosum erat, et denigratum, et putruerat, et perforatum erat, donec penetrauerat usque ad medullam.	Therefore I proceeded and cut into one of the openings until I discovered the part of the bone: and I found it corrupted: which was already corroded and blackened, and putrid, and perforated until it had penetrated to the marrow.
Serraui ergo quod detectum est mihi, et praeparatum ex osse corrupto.	Therefore I have prepared what was discovered to me from corrupt bone.
Et deputaui, quod non esset in osse nisi illa corruptio, quam abscidi, et serraui.	And I have shown that there was not in the bone except for that corruption which should be cut away and sawed.
Et ego iam eradicaueram eam.	And I had already removed it.
Deinde posui restaurationem uulneris cum medicinis consolidatiuis spacio longo.	Then I placed a restoration of the wound with medicinal consolidatives for a long space.
Et non est consolidatum.	And it is not set.
Deinde tentaui, et detexi super os secundo supra detectionem primam: et inueni corruptionem continuam cum osse: et serraui quod apparuit mihi etiam ex illa corruptione.	Then I examined, and found above the bone, second to the first discovery: and I found continuous corruption with the bone: and I sawed what appeared to me even from that corruption.
Deinde conatus sum restaurationem eius.	Then I tried to restore it.
Et non est restauratum.	And it was not restored.
Detexi ergo super ipsum iterum, et non cessaui incidere os particulatim, et conari restaurationem eius: et non est restauratum, donec incidi ex osse circiter palmum unum, et extraxi illud cum medulla sua.	Therefore, I again examined it, and did not cease to cut the bone piece by piece, and attempt its restoration: and it was not restored until I cut out of the bone about one palm's breadth, and extracted it with its marrow.
Deinde restauraui ipsum cum medicinis, et consolidatum est uelociter, et sanatum: et non fuit necessaria haec iteratio in operatione eius, et sectione ipsius, nisi propter dispositionem debilitatis infirmi, et paucitatem tolerantiae eius, et timorem meum super ipsum de morte: quoniam accidebat ei in omnibus horis ex superfluitate euacuationis syncopis mala.	Then I restored him with medicines, and it was quickly consolidated and healed: and this repetition of the operation on him and its section was not necessary, except because of the disposition of the weakness of the sick man, and the smallness of his tolerance, and my fear for him about death; for he fainted in all hours from the excess of evacuation.
Sanatus est ergo sanatione integra: et nata est in loco ossis caro dura, et bona facta est dispositio in corpore suo, et rediit uirtus eius: et conuersatus est in dispositionibus suis: et non fecit ei contrarietatem in ambulatione nocumentum omnino.	Therefore he was healed with complete healing: and firm flesh was born in the place of the bone, and a good arrangement was made in his body, and his strength returned: and he turned back to his dispositions: and he did not do him any harm in walking at all.
Si autem os eminens in loco corporis iam fractum est: tunc oportet ut serres ipsum, secundum hunc modum: et est: ut accipias ligamentum, et stringe ipsum in extremitate ossis eminentis: et praecipe alicui, qui extendat ipsum ad sursum: et pone ligamentum aliud ex lana grossius ligamento primo.	If however a protruding bone in the body has already been broken, then it is necessary to bind it, according to this method: and it is: that you take a ligament and tightly wind it at the extremity of the protruding bone: and command someone who will extend it upward: and place another ligament from wool thicker than the first.
Deinde liga ipsum super carne, quae est suh osse: et extende extremitatem eius, ut trahas carnem ad inferiora: et tu detegis carnem super locum quem uis serrare, ut non laedat Serra carnem.	Then bind the same over the flesh which is under the bone: and extend the extremity of it so that you draw the flesh downwards: and you will expose the flesh over the place which you wish to suture, so that it does not injure the sawing.
Pone lignum, aut tabulam sub osse inferius decenter: quoniam quando facis illud, non prohibetur quin secet carnem corruptam.	Place a piece of wood, or a board beneath the bone lower in the middle because when you do this, it does not prevent cutting corrupt flesh.
Et oportet ut sit Serratura super locum corruptum parumper, ut non sit in concauitate ossis corruptio: et non appareat in apparitione sua sensui, et cogat ad Serraturam sui uice alia.	And it is necessary that a lock be placed over the place corrupted for a short time, so that there is no corruption in the concavity of the bone; and that it does not appear in its appearance to the sense, and compels to the lock of itself another vice.
Quod si os est corruptum, et non est eminens, imo continuatur pars eius cum parte: et corruptio est in medio eius, aut in parte ipsius: tunc detege carnem ab omnibus partibus totam.	If the bone is broken and not protruding, but its part continues with another part, and the corruption is in the middle of it or in a part of it, then uncover the flesh from all sides entirely.
Deinde pone lignum inferius.	Then place the lower wood.
Postea serra illud ex parte prima, ubi est corruptio, donec continuetur Serratura ex parte altera: et sit Serratura secundum longitudinem a corruptione parumper, secundum quod diximus.	Afterwards, saw it on the first part, where is corruption, until the serration continues on the other part: and let the serration be according to the length from the corruption a little, as we have said.
Quod si corruptio est in iunctura, incide ipsam iuncturam corruptam, et serra os ubi continuatur ex parte altera.	If corruption is in the joint, cut into the corrupted joint itself, and saw the bone where it continues from the other part.
Si uero corruptio est in continuatione duarum iuncturarum, tunc non est in ea ingenium nisi abrasio.	If a corruption is in the continuity of two joints, then there is no remedy except scraping.
Quod si corruptio est in pectine manus, aut in pectine pedis: tunc res in eo est difficilis ualde.	If corruption is in the breast of the hand, or in the breast of the foot: then the matter in it is very difficult.
Verum oportet, ut inquiras corruptionem qualiter appareat tibi.	Truly it is necessary that you inquire how the corruption appears to you.
Et abradas eam, et mundes ipsam secundum quamcunque dispositionem tibi possibile est, et cum quocunque ingenio rectificatur tibi: quando non facit tibi contrarietatem Vena, aut Neruus.	And having scraped it, and made smooth according to whatever arrangement is possible for you, and with whatever skill it can be rectified for you, when it does not oppose you, Vein, or Nerve.
Et scias quod incisoria, et Serrae ad incidendum ista ossa sunt multa, secundum situm ossium, et praparationem eorum, et ipsorum grossitudinem, et subtilitatem eorum, et magnitudinem, et paruitatem ipsorum, et duriciem ipsorum, et eorum raritatem.	And know that the instruments for cutting and saws for cutting these bones are many, according to the location of the bones, and their preparation, and their thickness and fineness, and their size and smallness, and their hardness and their rareness.
Quapropter oportet, ut praepares omni speciei operationis instrumentum conueniens ad illam operationem.	Therefore it is necessary that instruments appropriate for each kind of operation be prepared.
Et scias, quod operationes istae significant tibi super speciem instrumenti quo indiges, quando tecum est studium longum.	And know that these operations signify to you about the kind of instrument with which you will need when it is a matter of study for you over a long time.
Et cognitio modorum huius artis, testimonium modorum aegritudinum: tunc enim iam inuenies per teipsum illud quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis ad omnem infirmitatem.	And knowledge of the modes of this art is a testimony to the modes of ailments: for then indeed you will find by yourself that which is suitable for it from instruments to every infirmity.
Et ego sum firmans tibi in ultimo huius capituli numerum instrumentorum, quae pones exempla super quae incides, et probationem qua experiaris super alia.	And I am confirming to you at the end of this chapter the number of instruments that you will place examples upon which you will cut, and the test which you will try on others.
Forma Serrae.	The Form of the Saw.
Forma alterius Serrae.	The form of another saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	Shape of another saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	Shape of another saw.
Haec forma Serrae depicta, sit decenter facta.	This figure of the saw is depicted correctly.
Fiat arcus eius superior, acuitas eius ex ferro: et manubrium eius ex buxo, et sit pyramidale decenter factum.	Let its arch be above, its sharpness from iron: and its handle from boxwood, and let it be pyramidal in shape made off-center.
Forma Rasorii iuncturarum.	The form of the knife for joints.
Sit caput huius Rasorii, secundum formam capitis claui stellati: et puncta eius sint secundum formam punctorum elischetfegi.	Let the head of this razor be, according to the form of the head of a star-shaped bolt: and its points be according to the form of the points of elischetfegi.
Et non conuenit, nisi ut fricentur cum eo capita iuncturarum, quando corrumpuntur, aut os amplum, et magnum est.	And it does not befit, unless they are rubbed with it the heads of joints, when they are corrupted, or bone is wide and large.
Forma maioris Rasorii.	Form of the Larger Razor.
Forma medii Rasorii.	Form of the Middle Surgical Knife.
Forma Rasorii lati.	Form of a Broad Scalpel.
Forma Rasorii in quo est concauitas.	The shape of the razor with its concave side.
Forma Rasorii alterius subtilis.	The form of another fine razor.
Forma Rasorii alterius curuatae extremitatis.	Form of a lancet for another curved extremity.
Forma Rasorii parui, subtilis tentae.	The form of a surgical knife is small and thin.
Forma Rasorii cum quo inciduntur ossa.	The form of the rasp with which bones are incised.
Forma etiam Rasorii magni.	The form also of a large scalpel.
Hoc similatur Radio, et extremitas est sicut Serra: exhibetur in locis multis ex rasione ossium.	This is similar to a chisel, and its extremity is like a saw: it is used in many places for cutting bone.
Forma Rasorii quod conuenit ad rasionem eius quod perforatum est ex ossibus.	The shape of a scalpel suitable for the reason that it is perforated from bones.
Extremitas eius triangula, acutarum est extremitatum.	The extremity of it is triangular, and acute are its extremities.
Fit ex Indi.	It comes from India.
Et similiter oportet, ut fiant omnia quae diximus ex Rasoriis, et Incisoriis, et Serris.	And similarly, it is necessary that all things which we have said be done from Rasors, and Incisors, and Saws.
¶ De incisione extremitatum, et Serratura ossium.	On the incision of limbs, and the setting of bones.
Caput LXXXIX.	Chapter LXXXIX.
Putrefiunt extremitates, aut ex caussa extrinseca, aut intrinseca.	The extremities putrefy, either from an external cause or an internal one.
Cum ergo medicatus fueris illam corruptionem curatione medicinarum, et non confert curatio: et uides corruptionem incidere in membrum, quam non repercutit aliquid: tunc oportet ut incidas illud membrum usque ubi consequitu corruptio, ut euadat infirmus per illud a morte, aut a malicia quae est maior defectu membri.	When therefore you have medicated that corruption with medicines, and the cure does not avail; and you see the corruption encroaching on a limb, which is not struck by anything: then it is necessary that you should cut that limb until where the corruption follows, so that the sick man may escape through that death, or from the evil which is greater defect of the member.
Et signum cui accidit illud est, quod denigratur membrum, donec putetur: quod ignis combussit ipsum, aut putrefit post nigredinem: donec inciditur illa putredo usque ad illud quod sequitur illud membrum, et serpit in totum corpus.	And the sign to which this happens is that the limb is blackened until it is thought to be burned by fire or rotten after the blackness: until that rot reaches what follows that limb and spreads throughout the body.
Propera ergo cum incisione eius, et similiter si caussa corruptionis est a percussione quorundam uenenosorum: sicut scorpionis marini, et uiperae, et rutellae, et similium.	Therefore, it is proper to make an incision with it, and similarly if the cause of corruption is from the sting of certain venomous creatures: such as the sea scorpion, viper, rattle snake, and similar ones.
Si ergo corruptio, aut percussio est in extremitate digiti, tunc incide digitum, et non des spacium corruptioni, ut incedat usque ad reliquam manum.	If therefore decay or a blow is in the extremity of the finger, then cut into the finger, and do not leave space for the decay, so that it may proceed even to the rest of the hand.
Et similiter si accidit in manu, tunc incide eam ex radice focilis, et non des spacium corruptioni, donec capiat in focili brachii.	And similarly if it happens in the hand, then cut it from the root of the finger, and do not leave space for corruption until it reaches the base of the arm.
Et si inuadit in eo, tunc incide brachium apud cubitum in iunctura sua.	And if it enters there, then cut the arm at the elbow joint.
Si autem pertransit corruptio, et uides eum circiter cubitum: tunc in illo est mors infirmi.	If, however, corruption passes through and you see him around the arm; then there is death in the patient.
Et administrare praeter illud ex curatione, est quantitas uirtus.	And besides that from the cure, the quantity of virtue is administered.
Et similiter fac de pede, quando inuadit corruptio in digito, tunc incide ipsum apud unum nodorum: et si capit in pectine pedis, tunc incide pedem totum.	And similarly do this with the foot when corruption attacks a toe, then cut it at one of the joints: and if it seizes the sole of the foot, then cut the whole foot.
Si autem ascendit ad genu, tunc incide crus apud iuncturam genu.	If it ascends to the knee, then cut the leg at the knee joint.
Quod si corruptio iam peruenit supra genu, tunc non est in ea ingenium, nisi dimissio, et relinquere infirmum morti.	If corruption has already come above the knee, then there is no skill in it, except to release and leave the sick to death.
Et modus incidendi membrum, aut serrandi ipsum est, ut stringas ligamentum in inferiori, quem uis incidere: et stringe ligamentum aliud supra locum.	And the way of cutting a limb, or sewing it up is, that you tie a ligament below, which you wish to cut: and tie another ligament above the place.
Et extendat minister ligamentum unum ad inferiora: et extendat minister aliud ligamentum superius ad sursum.	And let one servant extend a ligature downward: and let another servant extend a ligature upward.
Et tu separa carnem quae est inter duo ligamenta, cum Spatumili lato, donec detegatur caro tota.	And you separate the flesh which is between the two ligaments, with a wide spatula, until the whole flesh is uncovered.
Deinde incidatur, aut serretur.	Then it is incised, or sutured.
Et oportet, ut ponas ab omnibus partibus pannum lini, et non tangat Serra locum sanum: et accidat infirmo laesio addita, et apostema calidum.	And it is necessary that you place linen from all parts, and that the saw does not touch the healthy place: and let there be added to the infirmity a lesion and a hot abscess.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis interius dum operaris, tunc cauteriza locum uelociter: aut pone super ipsum quosdam pulueres abscindentes sanguinem.	If a flow of blood occurs within while you are operating, then cauterize the place quickly: or put upon it some powders that stop blood.
Deinde redi ad medicationem tuam, donec compleatur.	Then return to your treatment until it is completed.
Deinde liga membrum uulneratum cum ligamento conueniente ei, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then bind the wounded limb with a suitable bandage, and take care of it until it heals.
Et ego narro tibi quod accidit uiro in pede suo, hoc idem accidens quod narro tibi.	And I tell you what happened to a man in his foot, this same thing that I tell you.
Quod est, quia accidit in pede suo nigredo, cum adustione quae assimilatur combustioni ignis: et corruptio illa in primis accidit in digito suo, donec coepit pedem totum.	That is because blackness occurred in his foot, when a burn took place which is similar to the burning of fire: and that corruption first happened in his finger, until it began the whole foot.
Properauit ergo uir ex seipso, postquam uidit corruptionem incidere in membro cum uehementia eius, quod inuenit ex dolore, et adustione eius: et incidit ipsum apud iuncturam, et sanatus est.	Therefore a man healed himself, after he saw corruption had fallen upon the limb with violence of it, which he found from pain and burning; and it struck him at the joint, and he was healed.
Et postquam praeteriit ei tempus longum, accidit ei illa eadem corruptio in digito manus suae indice.	And after a long time had passed, the same corruption happened to his index finger of his right hand.
Venit ergo ad me, et conatus sum recuperare illam superfluitatem cum eo quod posui super manum ex medicinis post mundificationem corporis eius: et non repercussa est superfluitas, et coepit incedere in digitum alium: donec coepit coruptio in manum.	Therefore he came to me, and I tried to recover that superfluity with what I had placed on his hand from medicines after the purification of his body: and the superfluity was not found, and it began to move into another finger; until corruption began in the hand.
Vocauit ergo me, ad incidendum manum eius: et nolui illud, sperans ex me super repercussionem illius superfluitatis: et timui etiam super ipsum apud incisionem manus eius mortem.	Therefore he called me to cut his hand: and I refused it, hoping for an improvement from my own part of the excess; and I also feared for his death upon the cutting of his hand.
Quoniam uirtus uiri erat super casum.	For the man's virtue was above chance.
Postquam ergo desperauit de me, reuersus est ad terram suam: et peruenit ad me de eo, quia properauit, et incidit manum suam totam: et sanatus est.	After that therefore he despaired of me, he returned to his land: and it came to me concerning him, because he was hasty, and he fell with his whole hand: and he was healed.
Et non attuli hanc narrationem, nisi ut sit adiutorium super illud quod cadit de genere huius aegritudinis: et ut sit significatio qua significetur, et secundum quam agatur.	And I have not brought forward this account, except that it may be an aid regarding what falls under the kind of this illness: and that it may be a signification which shall signify, and according to which it is carried out.
¶ De cura Sinuum, et qualitate clisterizationis cum medicinis.	On the treatment of sinuses and the quality of enemas with medicines.
Caput XC.	Chapter XC.
Quando accidit apostema in quibusdam membris carnosis, et prolongatur spacium apostematis, donec collectionem facit saniei: deinde rumpitur, aut perforatur, et egreditur quod in eo est ex sanie, et remanet locus uacuus quasi sit uas: et cutis quae est super ipsum sicut pannus qui iam subtiliatus est: et non peruenit ad ultimum in corruptione sua, neque imprimit in os, neque in neruum, neque in ligamentum: meretur ut nominetur Sinus: et non nominatur Fistula: uerumtamen si prolongatur spacium eius, donec imprimat corruptio in aliquid horum membrorum, tunc nominatur Fistula, aut zuken.	When a boil occurs in certain fleshy limbs and the space of the boil lengthens until it forms a collection of pus: then it is ruptured or perforated, and that which is in it emerges from the pus, and a hollow place remains like a vessel: and the skin which is above it is like a cloth which has already been finely woven: and it does not reach the last stage of corruption, nor does it imprint on the bone, nor on the nerve, nor on the ligament: it deserves to be called a Sinus: and it is not called a Fistula: but if its space lengthens until corruption imprints on any of these members, then it is called a Fistula, or zuken.
Et cura eius est, ut incidas illam cutem totam sicut reuoluitur: et praecipue quando subtiliata est, et facta sicut pannus: et confidis quia non aaehaeret cum loco, propter corruptionem suam.	And the cure of it is that you cut that skin altogether as it turns back; and especially when it has been made thin, and made like cloth; and trust that it will not adhere to the place because of its corruption.
Si autem speras quod adhaereat cutis, et non consequitur ex eo corruptio illa ultima consecutione: et si in cute est spissitudo ex carne, tunc cura ipsum cum Clisteri: et est, ut consideres ad Sinum.	If you hope that it adheres to the skin, and does not follow from this the last corruption: and if there is thickness of flesh in the skin, then care for it with a clyster. And it is, as you consider to the sinus.
Tunc si est magnus, et pus quod emittitur ex eo est foetidi odoris: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum medicamine aegyptio, quod est aceti, et olei, et ziniar, partes recipiens aequales, aggregentur in uase: et decoquantur super ignem, donec rubeat medicamen: et ueniat in spissitudinem mellis.	If it is large, and the pus that flows out of it has a fetid odor: then cleanse it with an Egyptian medicine, which is vinegar, oil, and ziniar, equal parts received, are gathered in a vessel: and they are boiled over fire until the medicine boils: and it comes to the thickness of honey.
Deinde accipe ex eo quod tibi necesse est: et dissolue ipsum cum aqua et melle, et clisteriza cum eo Sinum: et stringe orificium eius, et dimitte medicinam in eo ad quantitatem duarum horarum.	Then take from that what you need: and dissolve it with water and honey, and give a clyster with it to the Sinus: and tighten its opening, and let the medicine remain there for the amount of two hours.
Deinde extrahe ipsum cum expressione: fac illud diebus tot, donec mundificetur Sinus, et remoueatur foetor.	Then remove it with expression: do this for so many days until the sinus is cleansed and the stench is removed.
Et quandoque clisterizatur cum aqua cineris, quando non est tibi praesens hoc medicamen: et est, ut accipias cinerem lignorum uitis, aut cinerem ex lignis ilicis: et proiicias super eam aquam.	And sometimes it is cleansed with water and ashes when that medicine is not present to you; and it is so that you may take the ashes of willow wood or ashes from holly trees; and pour them onto the water.
Deinde cola eam, et clisteriza cum ea, donec confidas quod Sinus iam ablutus est.	Then colate it and give it a clyster until you are confident that the sinus has been evacuated.
Quod si infirmo non est tolerantia super medicamen aegyptium, neque aquam cineris, tunc clisteriza ipsum cum aqua et melle, cui iam permixtum est aliquid ex ziniar contrito.	If the patient cannot tolerate the Egyptian medicine or water of ash, then administer a clyster with water and honey to which has been mixed something of ground zinc.
Aut clisteriza ipsum cum melle et uino permixtis, quoniam de proprietate mellis est, ut mundificet, et abluat: et uinum facit adhaerere Sinum, praecipue quando in uino est superfluitas stipticitatis et siccitatis.	Or cleanse it with a clyster of honey and wine mixed together, because honey has the property of cleansing and washing; and wine makes the sinus adhere, especially when there is an excess of astringency and dryness in the wine.
Cum facis illud aliquotiens, et confidis quod Sinus corruptio iam remota est: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum eo quod facit nasci carnem in eo.	When you have done this several times and trust that the corruption of the sinus has already been removed: then irrigate it with that which makes flesh grow there.
Et est, ut accipias ex emplastro dyafinicon: et dissoluas ipsum cum oleo rosato, et uino stiptico: aut clisteriza ipsum cum quibusdam medicinis, et unguentis aliis, quorum proprietates scripsi in tractatu unguentorum.	And it is, that you may receive from the diafinicon plaster: and dissolve it with rose oil, and stiptic wine: or clysterize it with some medicines, and other ointments, whose properties I have written in the treatise on ointments.
Quod si orificium Sinus est strictum, in quo non capit cannula clisteris: tunc amplifica ipsum cum ferro parumper: aut pone in ipso licinium inuolutum in unguento aegyptio, aut in unguento basilicon, donec amplificetur.	If the opening of the sinus is narrow, so that a clyster tube cannot enter; then widen it with a small iron tool; or put a linen cloth smeared with Egyptian ointment or basil oil into it, until it widens.
Et similiter si est orificium etiam amplum, tunc aggrega labia eius cum sutura: et dimitte ex eo quantitatem in quam ingrediatur clistere sine additione.	And similarly if the opening is also wide, then gather its lips together with suture; and release from it the quantity into which a clyster would enter without addition.
Et similiter si orificium eius ex quo currit pus, est eleuatum ad superiora: tunc seca ipsum in depressiori loco qui est in ipso, ut currat ex eo pus usque inferius: quoniam pus quando coartatur in profunditate Sinus, prohibet carnem generari in eo.	And similarly if the opening from which the pus flows is elevated upwards: then dry it in the lower place that is within it, so that the pus may flow from it downwards; for when pus is constricted in the depth of the sinus, it prevents flesh from being generated there.
Quod si non est tibi possibile secare Sinum circiter inferius eius secundum quod uis: tunc conare, ut praepares membrum praeparatione qua currat ex eo pus cum facilitate secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	If it is not possible for you to cut the sinus approximately below it as you wish: then try, that you prepare the limb with preparation which drains pus from it with ease according to how it is prepared for you.
Conare, ut non retineatur in eo aliquid ex pus omnino: et accipe medicinas consolidatiuas quae ponuntur super signum, conuenientes ad illud quod uis.	Attempt so that nothing of pus remains therein at all; and take medicinal substances for consolidation which are placed upon the mark, suitable to what you wish.
Et extende eas super pannum lini.	And spread them over linen cloth.
Et sit pannus tantae quantitatis, qua fiat communicatio totius Sinus.	And let the cloth be of such a size that communication is made throughout the whole sinus.
Deinde incide cum forficibus in directo orificii Sinus foramen, amplius orificio Sinus parumper.	Then cut with forceps at the direct opening of the sinus foramen, a little wider than the opening of the sinus.
Deinde extende ex unguentis lenibus super pannum alium, secundum quantitatem foraminis: et pone eum super ipsum positione longinqua ab orificio Sinus, ut alleuietur exitus pus ex eo: et non auferas pannum magnum, nisi post dies aliquos uice una.	Then extend from the ointments gently over another cloth, according to the amount of the hole: and place it over it in a position distant from the opening of the Sinus, so that the exit of pus from it may be relieved: and do not remove the large cloth, unless after some days once.
Ille autem qui est super orificium Sinus, est ille quem remoues in omni hora, ut egrediatur quod aggregatur in eo ex pus: et ut scias, an illud quod currit ex eo uirus, est multum, aut parum: aut digestum, aut indigestum.	He who is above the opening of the sinus is he whom you remove at every hour so that what has gathered there from pus may depart; and so that you may know, whether what runs out of it is much or little, digested or indigested.
Et cum hoc iterum considera locum Sinus ipsius, an in ipso sentiat dominus eius dolorem, aut non sit in eo dolor, et an sit in eo apostema, aut non sit in eo apostema.	And with this consider again the place of the sinus, whether the master feels pain in it himself, or if there is no pain in it, and whether there is an abscess in it, or if there is not an abscess in it.
Cum ergo protenditur medicatio tua taliter, et uides materiam quae egreditur super orificium Sinus, tunc scias, quod Sinus iam adhaeret, aut approximat adhaerentiae: tunc ergo solue ipsum in mane, aut in tertio die: et quando soluis uulnus, tunc permuta pannum alium, et renoua unguentum.	When therefore your medicine is applied thusly, and you see the material which emerges above the opening of the Sinus, then know that the Sinus has already adhered, or approximates to adherence: then therefore dissolve it in the morning, or on the third day; and when you dissolve the wound, then change the cloth, and renew the ointment.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post spacium longum uirus subtile, tunc non desperes de adhaerentia eius, nam sanatio eius appropinquat, quoniam ex hominibus sunt qui tardant generationem carnis in uulneribus suis, et ex eis sunt qui agunt econtrario illius.	If a subtle virus emerges from the sinus after a long time, then do not despair about its adherence, for its healing is approaching, because there are some men who delay the generation of flesh in their wounds, and there are others who act contrary to this.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post dies multos pus indigestum, tunc scias quod sinus non adhaeret.	If after many days undigested pus exits from the sinus, then know that the sinus does not adhere.
Si ergo tardatur adhaerentia Sinus, et prolongatur res eius: tunc adde in exiccatione medicinarum, uerum faciant medici, ut sint medicinae in substantia sua humidae, et in uirtute sua siccae: sicut unguentum dyafinicon, quando additur in eo superfluitas additionis ex zegi.	If therefore adhesion of the sinus is delayed, and the matter is prolonged: then add to the drying of the medicines, truly let physicians do so that they be medicines in their substance humid and in their virtue dry: such as ointment of dyafinicon, when superfluity of addition from zegi is added to it.
Et ex magis ultimo quo curatur, est, ut accipias unguentum dyafinicon, et soluatur cum oleo rosato, et roretur super ipsum uinum antiquum aequale in substantia sua.	And from the very last way it is cured, it is, that you take an ointment of diafenicum, and let it be dissolved with rose oil, and heated over it old wine equal in its substance.
Deinde confice ipsum cum eo, et utere ipso.	Then make it with that, and use it.
Et iam facit simile huic actioni, quando non est tibi praesens unguentum dyafinicon, mel, quando decoquis ipsum, donec ingrossetur, et uteris eo.	And now he does something similar to this action, when you do not have dyafinicon ointment at hand, honey, when you have boiled it until it thickens, and you use it.
Aut accipe myrrham, et aloen, et olibanum: tere totum, et pulueriza illud super mel dum est super ignem.	Or take myrrh, and aloe, and frankincense: rub it all together, and pulverize it upon honey while it is over the fire.
Deinde line super ipsum pannum, et stringe ipsum super Sinum: et line cum melle quod decoquisti, donec ingrossatum est: et pulueriza super ipsum species, et pone super ipsum pannum, et stringe eum.	Then place a strip over the cloth and tighten it over the sinus: and the strip with honey that you have boiled until it has thickened: and pulverize spices on top of it, and place them on the cloth and tighten it.
Et quandoque administratur in illo aristolochia longa, et radices lilii coelestis, et est lilium: et farina herbi, et centaurea.	And sometimes it is administered with long birthwort, and roots of celestial lily, and there is lily; and herb flour, and centaury.
Utere eis simplicibus, aut aggregatis, tere ea, et cribella ipsa: et pulueriza super mel quod narraui, et utere eo.	Use these simple ones, or aggregated ones, rub them and also the sieves themselves: and pulverize them over honey which I told you about, and use it.
Quod si prolongatur res Sinus, et non sanatur hac curatione: tunc scias, quod in profundo eius est corruptio: aut iam facit impressionem in ossibus, aut in reliquis membris duris, aut ligamentis: tunc cura ipsum curatione Fistularum, secundum quod praemissum est.	If the matter of the sinus prolongs and does not heal with this cure: then know that corruption is in its depth: or it already makes an impression on the bones, or on the other hard members, or on ligaments: then cure it with the cure of fistulas, according to what has been said before.
¶ De cura Panaritii et unguis attritae, et incisione digiti additi, et sectione.	On the treatment of a whitlow and a worn nail, and on the incision of an added finger, and sectioning.
Caput XCI.	Chapter XCIX.
Panaritium est apostema quod nascitur sub ungue pollicis manus, aut pedis: et fortasse nascitur in reliquis digitis.	A pimple is an abscess that is born under the nail of the thumb of the hand, or of the foot: and perhaps it is born in the other fingers.
Cum ergo prolongatur res eius, et negligitur curato eius, et apostematur apostemate calido: aut corrumpitur, et emittit pus, donec corrodit radicem unguis: et fortasse corrumpit eam totam, et fortasse peruenit corruptio ad os, donec est ei odor foetidus: et fit extremitas digiti lata, et fit color eius fuscus.	When therefore the matter is prolonged and its treatment is neglected, and it festers with a hot fever: or it rots and discharges pus until it corrodes the root of the nail: and perhaps it rots it entirely, and perhaps the corruption reaches the bone, until it has a foul odor: and the extremity of the finger becomes wide, and its color becomes dark.
Quando ergo tu curas ipsum, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut incidas cum ferro totam superfluitatem quae remansit ex ungue.	When therefore you care for the same thing, with that which we said in division, and your cure does not help: then it is necessary that you cut with a knife all the superfluity which remains from the nail.
Deinde cauteriza uulnus post illud.	Then cauterize the wound after that.
Cauterium enim iuuatiuum est ualde.	A cautery is indeed valuable.
Si uero os est sanum, et est unguis etiam sana, et additiones uacuae unguis iam comprimunt carnem ad interiora, et incipiunt pungere ipsam, et laedunt eam: tunc oportet ut ponas Radium subtilem sub angulo unguis quae pungit carnem, et impelle eam sursum: et incide eam carnem cum facilitate, et pone super illud quod remanet de carne ex medicinis comburentibus, corrosiuis, donec remoueatur totum eius.	If however the bone is sound, and the nail also sound, and the additions of the nail already compress the flesh towards the interior, and begin to prick it, and injure it: then you must place a fine radium under the angle of the nail that pricks the flesh, and drive it upwards; and cut that flesh with ease, and place upon that which remains of the flesh from burning medicines, corrosives, until all of it is removed.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
Si autem corruptio iam imprimit in os, tunc oportet ut incidas illud os, et extrahas ipsum: non enim sanatur unquam dum permanet in eo os corruptum.	If decay has already set into the bone, then it is necessary to cut open that bone and remove it; for it will never heal while that decayed bone remains.
Quod si uides corrosionem et corruptionem incedere in digitum, tunc incide eum in uno nodorum, secundum quod praemissa est eius rememoratio.	If you see that corrosion and decay are progressing in a finger, then cut it at one of the joints, according to what has been said before about its recollection.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of him until he is healed.
Si autem accidat ungui attritio, aut percussio: et contingit in ea dolor uehemens, tunc oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	If it happens that a nail is rubbed or struck, and there comes upon it a violent pain, then it is necessary to let blood from the one who is afflicted first of all.
Deinde seca unguem cum Spatumili acuto sectione transuersa de sursum ad uisum.	Then dry the nail with a sharp spatula and make a transverse incision from the base upwards as desired.
Et custodi, ne sectio perueniat ad carnem quae est sub ungue, nam tu facies accidere per illud super infirmum dolorem uehementem, et erit caussa ad natiuitatem carnis additae in loco.	And guard, lest the incision reach the flesh which is under the nail, for you will cause to happen through it a very fierce pain upon the weak, and it will be a cause for the birth of flesh added in its place.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod sedat dolores.	Then care for the place with that which allays pains.
Digitus uero additus qui nascitur in quibusdam manibus hominum, fortasse est carnosus totus: et fortasse sunt in quibusdam eorum ossa, et fortasse est in eo unguis: et quidam eorum nascitur in radice iuncturae, aut est natiuitas eius in quibusdam nodis digiti.	The finger which is born in some hands of men, is perhaps all fleshy: and perhaps there are bones in some of them, and perhaps it has a nail: and some of them are born at the root of the joint, or its birth is in some nodes of the finger.
Ille ergo qui nascitur in quibusdam nodis digiti, non mouetur: et ille qui nascitur apud iuncturam digiti, fortasse mouetur.	Therefore, he who is born in certain nodes of a finger, does not move; and he who is born at the joint of a finger, perhaps moves.
Eius ergo qui ex eis est carnosus, sectio eius facilis est.	Therefore, section of that which is fleshy from them is easy.
Quod est, ut incidas ipsum apud radicem suam cum Spatumili lato.	That is, as you cut it at its root with a wide spatula.
Eius autem cuius natiuitas est in radice iuncturae curatio, est difficilis.	The treatment of one whose nativity is at the root of the joint is difficult.
Abstine ergo ab incisione eius.	Therefore, abstain from cutting it.
In illo uero qui nascitur in digito apud ultimum nodorum, tunc oportet ut incidas in primis carnem eius incisione rotunda usque ad os.	In that one who is born in the finger at the last of the knots, then it is necessary that you cut first his flesh with a round incision until to the bone.
Deinde serra os cum una illarum Serrarum conuenientium ad illud.	Then saw with one of those saws suitable for it.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for him until he is healed.
Consolidatio autem quae accidit digitis adinuicem, multotiens accidit aut ex natiuitate hominis, id est, nascitur cum eo, aut a consolidatione uulneris, aut combustione ignis, et similibus.	The consolidation which happens to the fingers together, often happens either from birth of man, that is, it is born with him, or from the closing of a wound, or burning by fire, and similar things.
Oportet ergo ut seces illam consolidationem, donec redeant digiti secundum formam suam naturalem.	Therefore it is necessary that he cut that consolidation, until the fingers return according to their natural form.
Deinde pone inter eos licinia, aut pannos infusos in oleo rosato: ut non consolidentur uelociter, et separa inter eos: aut pone inter eos laminam plumbi subtilem, donec consolidetur locus secundum quod oportet.	Then place between them strips of linen or cloths soaked in rose-colored oil, so that they may not solidify quickly, and separate them; or place between them a thin sheet of lead until the place has solidified as it should.
Et similiter si accidat consolidatio quibusdam digitis cum palma, tunc seca illam consolidationem, secundum quod praeparatur et conuenit figurae membri.	And similarly if it happens that some fingers are solidified with the palm, then cut that consolidation, according to how it is prepared and suits the shape of the limb.
¶ De incisione Vitium.	On the Incision of a Tumor.
Caput XCII.	Chapter XCII.
Uites sunt Venae inuolutae, grossae, plenae superfluitatibus melancholicis quae accidunt in pluribus membris corporis: et plurimum euentus earum est in cruribus, praecipue in cruribus iter agentium et laborantium, et portantium.	There are veins that are enveloped, large, full of superfluities melancholic which occur in many members of the body: and most often happen in the legs, especially in the legs of travelers and laborers, and those who carry burdens.
Oportet ergo ut administres excussionem corporis ex cholera nigra aliquotiens excussione forti.	Therefore it is necessary that you administer an incision of the body from black bile several times with a strong excision.
Deinde phlebotoma patientis eas basilicam.	Then the lancet is applied to the basilica of the patient.
Curatio uero earum cum ferro, est secundum duos modos.	The cure of them with iron is according to two modes.
Vnus eorum est, ut secentur, et extrahatur sanguis niger.	One of them is that they are cut and black blood is taken out.
Et modus alter est, ut eleuetur Vena, et extrahatur tota.	And another method is, that the vein be lifted up and drawn out entirely.
Sectio uero eius est secundum hunc modum.	The section is as follows.
Embroca crus in primis cum aqua calida multum, donec resoluatur sanguis grossus faeculentus.	Suture the leg first with hot water until the thick, foul blood dissolves.
Deinde stringe crus infirmi a superiori parte coxae eius, usque ad inferiorem partem genu cum uitta.	Then bind the leg of the infirm from the upper part of its hip, down to the lower part of the knee with a bandage.
Deinde seca uenam in loco uno, aut duobus, aut tribus sectione ampla.	Then dry the vein in one place, or two, or three places with a wide incision.
Deinde eleua, id est, extrahe sanguinem in manu tua ab inferiori parte cruris, usque ad sursum, et a superiori oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	Then elevate, that is, draw out the blood from your hand from the lower part of the leg, up to the top, and let the phlebotomist first use the lancet on the weak person.
Deinde seca unguem cum usque inferius: donec egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uides sufficere, et quam tolerat uirtus infirmi.	Then dry the nail until it comes out from below until the quantity of blood that you see is sufficient and as much as the strength of the weak person can tolerate.
Postea liga eam: et praecipe ei, ut abstineat a cibis generantibus choleram nigram: et itera euacuationem et phlebotomiam, quando implentur Venae, et nocet illud infirmo.	Thereafter bind it: and command him to abstain from foods that produce black bile; and repeated evacuations and phlebotomy, when the veins are full, and this is harmful to the sick person.
Eleuatio autem eius est secundum hunc modum.	The raising of it is according to this manner.
Rade crus infirmi, si in ea sunt pili multi.	Remove the leg bone if there are many hairs in it.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in balneum: aut embroca ipsum in crure eius cum aqua calida, donec rubeat, et exuberentur Venae: aut exercitetur exercitio forti, si non est ei praesens balneum, donec calefiat membrum.	Then introduce it into the bath: or embrocate it on his leg with hot water until it becomes red and the veins swell; or exercise him vigorously if there is no bath present, until the limb heats up.
Deinde seca cutem in directo uenae sectione per longitudinem: aut in ultimo eius apud genu, aut in inferiori parte eius apud calcaneum.	Then dry the skin in a direct vein incision along its length: or at its last part near the knee, or in the lower part near the heel.
Deinde aperi cutem cum uncinis, et excoria uenam ab omni parte, donec appareat sensui: et est apud apparitionem eius, quod uides eam rubeam ad nigredinem decliuem.	Then open the skin with hooks, and excise the vein from every part until it appears to the sense: and at its appearance, you see it red to blackness inclining.
Cum ergo uadit ex cute, uides eam albam quasi sit chorda.	When therefore it comes out of the skin, you see it white as if it were a string.
Deinde intromitte sub ea Radium, donec quando eleuatur et egreditur de cute: suspende eam cum uncino caeco, leni.	Then introduce under it a probe until it is lifted and emerges from the skin; suspend it with a crooked hook, gently.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam prope illam sectionem tribus digitis.	Then make another dry incision near that incision three fingers wide.
Deinde excoria cutem a superiori parte uenae, donec appareat.	Then scrape the skin from the upper part of the vein until it appears.
Deinde eleua eam cum Radiis sicut fecisti, et suspende eam cum uncino alio, sicut fecisti in primis.	Then lift it with the rays as you did before, and suspend it with another hook, as you did at first.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam, aut sectiones plures, si indiges illo.	Then make another dry incision, or several incisions, if you need them.
Deinde eleua, et incide ipsam ultima sectione apud calcaneum.	Then elevate and cut it at its last section near the heel bone.
Deinde extrahe eam ad sectionem quae est supra eam.	Then extract it to the incision which is above it.
Et fac illud, donec extrahas eam ex sectione quae est superior, uel altior sectionibus omnibus, donec quando egreditur tota: tunc incide eam.	And do this until you have removed it from the incision which is higher, or from all higher incisions, until when it exits entirely: then cut into it.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad extrahendum, et eleuandum: tunc intromitte acum cum filo forti duplo, et liga eam, et extrahe ipsam: aut intromitte sub ea Radium: et reuolue manum tuam ad omnem partem, donec egrediatur.	If it does not obey you to be pulled out and lifted up, then introduce a needle with a strong doubled thread, and tie it, and pull it out: or introduce under it a Rod: and revolve your hand to every part until it comes out.
Et caue, ne incidatur.	And beware, lest it fall.
Nam si incidatur, fit difficile tibi eleuare eam ualde, et ingreditur super infirmum ex ea nocumentum.	For if it cuts, it will be difficult for you to remove it well, and it will enter upon the weak from it harm.
Cum ergo extraxeris eam totam: tunc pone super locum uulnerum lanam submersam in uino et oleo rosato, aut oleo: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	When therefore you have extracted it whole: then place over the wound's place linen submerged in wine and rose oil, or oil: and take care of it until it is healed.
Quod si Vitis est contracta, habens tortuositatem cui sit inuolutio ad partes, et non est sicut diximus secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut findas super eam ad omnem partem tortuositatis eius, et loca inuolutionis ipsius.	If the vein is contracted, having a twisting that winds around to parts, and is not as we have said according to straightness, then it is necessary for you to feel over it to every part of its twisting, and the places of its winding.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncinis, donec eleues eam totam: et caue apud sectionem tuam super eam ne incidas uenam, aut uulneres: nam difficile fiet super te eleuare, uel extrahere eam.	Then suspend it with hooks until you have raised it entirely; and be careful at the incision that you do not cut a vein or wound it; for it will be difficult to raise or remove it from you.
Conserua ergo prudentiam tuam.	Therefore, keep your prudence.
Forma Incidentis quo sanatur Vitis.	The shape of an incision that heals a grapevine.
Forma Vncini caeci.	Form of the Blind Pouch
Non est ei curuitas sicut reliquis Vncinis, neque est acutae extremitatis, ut non uulneret uenam: et est grossae flectuositatis, lenis: quoniam si esset subtilis, incideret uenam subtilitate sua: imo sit ei superflua grossitudo, sicut diximus.	It is not as troublesome as the others [surgical instruments], nor is it sharp at its extremity so that it does not wound a vein; and it has great flexibility, smooth: for if it were fine, it would wound a vein with its fineness; indeed let its excess be of thickness, just as we have said.
De extractione Venae cruris.	On the Extraction of the Vein of the Leg.
Caput XCIII.	Chapter XCIII.
Haec Vena generatur in cruribus in terris calidis, sicut Alizegi, et terra Arabum, et in terris aridis, calidis, paucae teneritatis, id est, in quibus non nascitur herba, neque arbor.	This vein is generated in the legs in hot lands, like those of Alizegi, and Arabia, and in dry, hot lands with little tenderness, that is, in which no grass grows nor trees.
Et fortasse generatur in locis aliis corporis praeter crura.	And perhaps it is generated in other places of the body besides the legs.
Et generatio quidem eius est a putrefactione quae accidit sub cute, sicut accidunt intra corpora serpentes et uermes ascarides, et uermes generati inter cutem et carnem.	And its generation is from decay that happens under the skin, just as it happens inside bodies of snakes and roundworms and worms generated between skin and flesh.
Et signum incaeptionis euentus huius Venae est, quod accidit in crure inflammatio uehemens.	And the sign of the beginning of this vein's injury is that a fierce inflammation happens in the leg.
Deinde uesicatur locus.	Then the place is cut.
Deinde incipit Vena exire ex loco illius uesicationis, quasi sit radix plantae, aut animal.	Then begins the vein to come out of the place of that incision, as if it were the root of a plant, or an animal.
Cum ergo apparet ex ea extremitas eius, tunc oportet ut inuoluas super ipsam frustum plumbi, cuius pondus sit ex drachma keil, usque ad drachmas II et noda ipsam: et dimitte plumbum suspensum ex crure.	When therefore the extremity appears, then it is necessary that you wind around it the piece of lead, whose weight is from a drachma to two drachmas and tie it: and let go the suspended lead from the leg.
Quotiens ergo egreditur ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, inuolue illud in plumbo, et noda illud.	Whenever therefore something comes out of it to the outside, envelop that thing in lead and tie a knot in it.
Quod si prolongatur multum, tunc incide partem eius, et inuolue residuum.	If it is prolonged much, then cut a part of it, and wrap up the remainder.
Et non incidas eam radicitus antequam egrediatur tota.	And do not cut it root and branch before it comes out entirely.
Quoniam si incidis, contrahitur, et ingreditur in carnem: et facit accidere apostema, et putredinem in loco, et ulcus malum.	For if it cuts, it contracts and enters into flesh; and it causes a boil to happen, and rot in the place, and a bad ulcer.
Quapropter oportet, ut suauiter tractetur, et extrahatur paulatim, donec egrediatur ex ultimo sui, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid in corpore: et ex hac quidem Vena egreditur in quibusdam hominibus quod est in longitudine sua quinque palmorum et decem.	Therefore it is necessary that it be gently treated and extracted gradually until it comes out from its last part, and nothing of it remains in the body; and from this vein it emerges in some people which is in length five palms and ten.
Et iam peruenit ad me, quia exiuit uiro ex XX palmis.	And now it has come to me, because a man came out of twenty palms.
Si autem inciditur tibi in hora medicationis tuae: tunc intromitte radium in foramine eius, et perfora eam foramine longo, cum corpore, donec euacuetur totum quod est in ea ex materia: et administra putrefactionem loci cum medicinis diebus aliquot.	If it happens to you at the time of your treatment: then introduce a rod into its hole, and perforate it with a long hole, with the body, until everything that is in it of matter is evacuated: and administer the rotting of the place with medicines for several days.
Deinde cura ipsum curatione apostematum.	Then care for its cure as a boil.
Et haec quidem Vena quandoque habet ramos multos, praecipue quando apparet in iunctura pedis, aut in pede ipso: et accidunt ei orificia multa, et egreditur ex omni orificio ramus.	And this vein indeed sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears in the joint of the foot, or in the foot itself: and many openings occur to it, and a branch comes out from every opening.
Cura ergo ipsam, sicut diximus in diuisione, et cum eo quod praemissum est.	Therefore, treat the wound, as we said in the division, and with what has been previously stated.
¶ De sectione super Vermes generatos sub cute, et dicitur Aegritudo bouina.	On incisions over worms generated under the skin, and it is called a cow's ailment.
Caput XCIIII.	Chapter XCI
Haec Aegritudo nominatur in quadam terra apud nos Aegritudo bouina: propterea, quia multotiens accidit bouibus, et est uermis paruus unus, qui nascitur inter cutem et carnem.	This ailment is called among us  in a certain land the "ox ailment": because it often happens to oxen, and there is a small worm that is born between the skin and flesh.
Et uadit in corpore toto, ascendendo et descendendo: et ostenditur sensui apud ambulationem eius de membro ad membrum, donec disrumpit ubicumque disrumpit in cute locum, et egreditur.	And it travels throughout the whole body, ascending and descending: and it is shown to the sense in its walking from limb to limb, until it breaks wherever it breaks in the skin, and exits.
Et generatio eius est ex putredine quorundam humorum.	And its generation is from the corruption of some humors.
Sicut accidunt uermes et serpentes, id est, lumbrici, et ascarides in uentre.	As worms and serpents, that is, roundworms and pinworms, occur in the belly.
Et timetur ex malicia eius.	And it is feared from its malice.
Quia quando ipse uadit in corpore, et eleuatur ad caput, et peruenit ad locum: tunc fortasse aperit in eo, et egreditur, et destruit oculum: et accidit illud multotiens.	For when he enters into the body and is elevated to the head and reaches the place, then perhaps he opens it and goes out and destroys the eye: and this happens many times.
Cum ergo uis curare eum, et extrahere ipsum, tunc non fit illud nisi apud ambulationem eius, et apparitionem ipsius sensui.	When therefore you wish to cure him, and to extract him, then it is done only when he walks, and appears to his senses.
Oportet ergo, ut stringas quod est supra eum, et quod est sub eo cum ligamento constrictione forti.	Therefore, you must bind what is above it and what is below it with a strong ligature constriction.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then dry it over itself, and extract it.
Quod si profundatur in carne, et non inuenis ipsum: tunc pone super locum cauterium cum igne, donec moriatur.	If it goes deep into the flesh, and you do not find it, then place a cautery over the place with fire, until it dies.
Et maius quod timetur, est corruptio eius, qua corrumpit oculum, sicut diximus.	And the greater thing that is feared is its corruption, which corrupts the eye, as we have said.
Si autem uides eum iam peruenisse in capite prope oculum, tunc stringe sub eo supercilium strictura bona.	If you see that it has arrived near the eye in the head, then tightly bind the eyebrow below it with a good bandage.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then dry it above itself, and remove it.
Et oportet ut utatur infirmus mundificatione sui corporis, cum medicinis soluentibus humores putridos malos.	And it is necessary that the sick person make use of purification of his body, with medicines dissolving bad, putrid humors.
Et caueat sibi a cibis generantibus putrefactionem.	And let him beware of foods that produce decay.
¶ De sectione super aegritudinem Nakir.	On incision for Nakir's illness.
Caput XCV.	Chapter XC.
Haec aegritudo nominatur in terra nostra Nakir: et est dolor qui accidit in quibusdam membris: deinde permutatur de membro ad membrum.	This illness is called Nakir in our country: and it is a pain that happens in certain limbs: then it changes from limb to limb.
Et ego quidem iam uidi ipsum, secundum quod narro tibi.	And I indeed have already seen it, as I tell you.
Vocatus sum ad mulierem infirmam in quibusdam uillis.	I was called to a woman who was ill with some wounds.
Et detexit brachium suum, et uidi inflationem paruam in uena funis brachii.	And he uncovered his arm, and I saw a small swelling in the vein of the arm's tendon.
Et postquam remansi hora una, uidi unam inflationem incedere cum focili, sicut incedit uermis, ascendendo ad humerum eius uelocius quam esse potest: ut sit sicut argentum uiuum, quando currit de loco ad locum.	And after one hour had passed, I saw one inflation moving with a worm, as a worm moves, ascending to its shoulder more quickly than it could: so that it was like living silver when it runs from place to place.
Recessit ergo dolor ex illo loco, et fixus est in humero.	Therefore pain departed from that place and was fixed in the shoulder.
Deinde sedi hora una, et cucurrit in reliquum corpus, donec perueniret in brachium aliud.	Then he sat for one hour, and it ran into the rest of the body until it reached the other arm.
Deinde narrauit mihi, quia reuoluebatur in toto corpore suo, secundum quod uidi.	Then he told me that he was rolling over his whole body, as I saw.
Miratus sum ergo de uelocitate permutationis eius de membro ad membrum.	I was amazed therefore at the speed of its transference from limb to limb.
Et ego quidem ante illud non uideram hanc aegritudinem oculis meis taliter secundum hunc modum.	And indeed before that I had not seen this illness with my eyes in this way according to this manner.
Verumtamen uidi multos, qui inueniunt dolorem permutari de membro ad membrum: et non uidi ipsum oculis, sicut uidi eum in muliere.	Nevertheless, I have seen many who find pain to be transferred from limb to limb; and I have not seen it with my own eyes, as I saw it in a woman.
Et ego non cogito illud esse, nisi quod est propterea, quod mulier fuit ex illis qui sunt ex uillis sicci corporis detectarum uenarum: hinc ergo apparet sensui illa uentositas permutata.	And I do not think it is otherwise, except because the woman was from those who have veins of the dry body discovered, hence therefore appears to the sense that lightness transformed.
Et est necesse, ut non appareant secundum hanc rationem in illis qui sunt deliciosi, et corporibus humidis, occultarum uenarum.	And it is necessary that they not appear according to this reason in those who are delicate and with moist bodies, of hidden veins.
Cum ergo uis curationem eius, et sentit patiens illud dolorem: tunc si est apparens tibi oculo, sicut diximus, tunc stringe supra ipsum, et sub ipso uelociter: et seca supra ipsum, donec egrediatur illa uentositas coartata: et cauteriza locum.	When therefore you wish to cure it, and the patient feels that pain: then if it appears to you as we said, then tightly grasp above it, and below it quickly: and dry above it until that windiness is expelled by constraint: and cauterize the place.
Si autem non uides ipsum oculis tuis: tunc cura ipsum cum excussione corporis, et cum eo quod expellit uentositates, et carminat eas cum pillulis foetidis, et pillulis de serapino, et similibus.	If you do not see it with your own eyes, then treat it with a bodily purge and with that which expels wind and flatulence, and treats them with foul pills and pills of saffron, and similar things.
¶ De extractione Sagittarum.	On the Extraction of Arrows
Caput XCVI.	Chapter XCVI.
Sagittae diuersificantur secundum species suas, et secundum loca in quibus cadunt ex corpore.	Arrows differ according to their kinds and according to the places in which they fall from the body.
Earum uero diuersitas est: quoniam ex eis sunt quae habent cuspides magnos, et paruos: et concauae, et surdae.	Their diversity is: because some have large points and small ones: and concave and deaf ones.
Et ex eis sunt quae habent tres angulos.	And there are those which have three angles.
Et ex eis quibus sunt linguae.	And from those who have tongues.
Et ex eis quibus sunt astellae.	And from those which have stars.
Illae uero quae sunt secundum membra in quibus cadunt, est secundum duos modos.	Those which are according to the limbs in which they fall, are according to two ways.
Aut enim membra sunt ex membris principalibus concauis, sicut cerebrum, et cor, et epar, et pulmo, et renes, et intestina, et uesica, et eis similia.	Or indeed members are from the principal members concave, such as the brain and heart and liver and lung and kidneys and intestines and bladder and similar things.
Quando ergo cadit in aliquo horum membrorum, et apparent tibi signa mortis, quae ego narro tibi post, tunc oportet ut deuites extractionem illius sagittae ex eis, nam mors consequitur illum in quo est, in pluribus dispositionibus.	When therefore it falls into any of these limbs, and the signs of death appear to you, which I tell you after, then it is necessary that you avoid the extraction of that arrow from them, for death follows him in whom it is, in many arrangements.
Et quando non apparent tibi ista signa mala, et sagitta non est absconsa in profunditate membri, tunc extrahe ipsam, et cura uulnus.	And when these signs of evil do not appear to you, and the arrow is not hidden in the depth of the limb, then draw it out, and care for the wound.
Ex signis enim cerebri quando cadit in eo sagitta, et penetrat os, et egreditur siphac quod est super cerebrum, est: quoniam accidunt ex illo soda uehemens, et scotomia, et uertigo, et rubedo in oculis, et inflatio, et rubedo linguae, et spasmus, et permixtio intellectus, et uomitus cholerae.	When a dart falls into the brain and enters through the opening, and exits through the soft part above the brain, these are the signs: because violent vomiting occurs from it, along with dimness of vision, vertigo, redness in the eyes, swelling, redness of the tongue, spasms, confusion of the mind, and vomiting of bile.
Et fortasse egreditur sanguis ex naribus, aut auribus.	And perhaps blood may issue from the nostrils, or ears.
Et fortasse abscinditur sermo, et destruitur uox.	And perhaps speech is cut off, and the voice is destroyed.
Et egreditur ex loco uulneris humiditas alba similis pulti.	And moisture white, like a poultice, emerges from the wound's location.
Et exit ex eo simile aquositati carnis.	And there comes forth from it a discharge like water from flesh.
Si ergo apparent tibi ista signa, tunc abstine a curatione, et extrahe sagittam si non egreditur.	If therefore these signs appear to you, then abstain from treatment, and remove the arrow if it does not exit.
Signa autem sagittae quando cadit in corde, sunt: quod ipsa est prope mammillam sinistram: et sentit cum ea quasi ipsa sit fixa in re dura, non in re uacua.	The signs of an arrow when it falls into the heart are: that it is near the left breast, and he feels as if it were fixed in a hard thing, not in an empty one.
Et fortasse sagittae est motus similis motui pulsus: et currit ex uulnere sanguis niger.	And perhaps the movement of an arrow is similar to the movement of a pulse: and blood runs out of the wound black.
Et sequitur illud frigus extremitatum, et sudor frigidus, et syncopis.	And following this comes coldness of the extremities and cold sweat, and fainting.
Scias ergo, quod mors descendit procul dubio.	Therefore know that death comes without a doubt.
Et signum sagittae quando uulnerat pulmonem, est exitus sanguinis spumosi ex uulnere: et uasa quae sequuntur collum, apostematur, et mutatur color infirmi.	And the sign of an arrow wound to the lung is the exit of frothy blood from the wound: and the vessels that follow the neck become inflamed, and the color of the sick person changes.
Et expirat spiritum magnum, altum: et quaerit attractionem aeris frigidi.	And he expires great, high spirit: and seeks the attraction of cold air.
Quod si cadat sagitta in uelamen, quod est in pectore: tunc est prope costas paruas: et fit anhelitus magnus cum dolore uehementi, cum suspirio: et mouentur omnia membra humerorum.	If an arrow falls into the covering of the chest, which is near the ribs, a great sigh comes with intense pain, and all the limbs of the shoulders move.
Et si cadat sagitta in stomachum, tunc fortasse egreditur ex uulnere ex cibo aliquid indigestum.	And if an arrow falls into the stomach, then perhaps something indigested from food will emerge from the wound.
Et si cadit sagitta in Ventrem, et figitur in eo: egreditur aliquid stercoris ex uulnere, aut zirbum, aut intestinum quod iam disruptum est.	And if an arrow falls into the abdomen and is fixed in it, something of excrement comes out of the wound, or a part of the intestine which has already been torn.
Non est ergo spes in curatione eius, neque in extractione sagittae.	There is therefore no hope of cure for it, nor in the removal of the arrow.
Quod si sagitta cadat in Vesicam, et egrediatur urina: et procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, et fortior sit dolor super infirmum: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	If an arrow falls into the bladder and urine flows out, and something proceeds from it to the outside, and the pain is stronger over the weak one: then you know that it is mortal.
Reliqua autem membra, sicut facies, et collum, et guttur, et spatula, et adiutorium, et spondiles dorsi, et furcula, et coxa, et crus, et eis similia ex membris saluantur secundum plures dispositiones: quando non inuenit sagitta arteriam, aut neruum: et non est sagitta uenenosa.	The remaining members, such as the face, and neck, and throat, and spatula, and helper, and vertebrae of the back, and collarbone, and hip, and leg, and similar members are healed according to many arrangements: when it does not find the artery, or nerve: and it is not a poisonous arrow.
Et ego narro tibi quod uidi de esse harum sagittarum, ut significes per illud super curationem tuam.	And I tell you what I saw of these arrows, so that you may signify by it your cure.
Quod est, quia cuidam uiro cecidit sagitta in lachrymali oculi eius, in radice nasi.	This is because to a certain man an arrow fell into his lacrimal gland of the eye, at the root of the nose.
Extraxi ergo eam ipsi ex parte altera, sub adipe auris eius: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei in oculo eius nocumentum.	Therefore, I extracted it from the other side, under the fat of his ear: and he was healed, and no harm came to his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam Iudaeo, quae cecidit ei in adipe oculi sui sub palpebra inferiori: et sagitta iam occultata erat, et non consecutus sum ex ea nisi extremitatem paruam eius, cum qua adhaeret in ligno suo: et erat sagitta magna ex sagittis arcuum Turcorum, cum ferro leni, in qua non sunt aures.	And I extracted another arrow from a Jew, which had fallen into the fat of his eye under his lower eyelid: and the arrow was already hidden, and I did not remove it except for its small end, with which it adhered to its shaft: and the arrow was large of the arrows of the Turkish bows, with a mild iron, in which there are no ears.
Sanatus est ergo Iudaeus, et non accidit in oculo eius accidens malum.	Therefore the Jew was healed and no evil happened to his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam ex gutture Christiani.	And I extracted another arrow from the throat of a Christian.
Et erat sagitta arabica, et est illa cui sunt aures.	And there was an Arabian arrow, and it is that which has ears.
Secui ergo super ipsam inter duas guidegi: et iam submersa erat in gutture eius.	Therefore I followed her along within two guides; and now she was submerged in her throat.
Subtiliatus sum ergo cum ea, donec extraxi eam: et sanatus est Christianus.	Therefore I carefully removed it until I extracted it: and Christian was healed.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam uiro quae ceciderat in uentre eius: et cogitauimus, quia moreretur ex ea.	And I extracted another arrow from a man who had fallen into his belly: and we thought that he would die from it.
Postquam ergo praeterierunt ei triginta dies, et non mutatum est super eum aliquid ex dispositionibus eius, secui super sagittam: et ingeniaui super eam, et extraxi eam: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei accidens malum.	After thirty days had passed, and nothing in his condition had changed, I cut above the arrow: and I devised a plan upon it, and extracted it: and he was healed, and no misfortune happened to him.
Et uidi uirum cui cecidit sagitta in dorso eius, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam.	And I saw a man whose arrow had fallen on his back, and the wound was consolidated upon it.
Postquam ergo fuit post septem annos, exiuit sagitta in radice coxae eius.	After that, after seven years, an arrow came out at the root of his hip.
Et uidi mulierem cui cecidit in uentre suo sagitta, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam, et remansit sagitta intra ipsam: et non mutata est ex dispositionibus eius aliqua, et mulier non inuenit ei nocumentum in aliqua ex operationibus suis naturalibus.	And I saw a woman to whom an arrow fell into her belly, and the wound was consolidated on her, and the arrow remained inside her; and she was not changed in any of her dispositions, and the woman did not find harm to her in any of her natural operations.
Et uidi uirum alium, cui cecidit sagitta in facie sua: et consolidatum est uulnus, et remansit, non inueniens ei multum dolorem: et similia istis multa.	And I saw another man to whom an arrow fell into his face: and the wound was consolidated, and it remained, not finding much pain for him: and similar things to these many.
Et extraxi sagittam uiro ex principibus Regis, quae ceciderat ei in medio nasi sui, et iam declinauerat ad partem dextram parumper: et occultata erat sagitta tota.	And I removed an arrow from a man of the king's princes, which had fallen into the middle of his nose, and already had slanted to the right side a little: and the arrow was completely hidden.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius post casum sagittae usque ad tres dies.	Therefore I was called upon to treat him after the arrow wound for three days.
Inueni ergo uulnus sagittae strictum ualde.	I therefore found a wound from an arrow very tight.
Inquisiui ergo eam cum tenta subtili, et non sensi eam: et ipse quidem inueniebat punctionem et dolorem sub aure sua ex parte dextra.	Therefore I inquired about it with a subtle probe, and I did not feel it: and he himself was finding pricking and pain under his ear on the right side.
Speraui ergo, quod erat illa punctio ex extremitate sagittae.	Therefore I hoped that the prick was from the tip of the arrow.
Emplastraui ergo locum cum emplastro in quo erat uirtus attractiua, et digestiua, confidens apud me, quod apostemaretur locus, et appareret mihi signum sagittae, ut secarem super eam: et non accidit in loco accidens significans quod sagitta consecuta sit locum.	I therefore applied a dressing to the place with a poultice that had the power of attraction and digestion, trusting that the place would fester, and there would appear a sign like an arrow so that I might cut across it: but it did not happen in the place, an accident indicating that the arrow followed the place.
Assiduaui ergo cum emplastro super eum diebus multis: et non accidit accidens, et consolidatum est uulnus interim: et remansit infirmus de extractione eius spacio dierum, donec sensit sagittam die quodam intra nasum suum.	Therefore I diligently applied a plaster to it for many days; and no accident occurred, and the wound became solid in the meantime; and he remained weak from its extraction for a space of days, until one day he felt an arrow inside his nose.
Et narrauit mihi illud.	And he told me that.
Posui ergo super illud uulnus medicinam acutam, corrosiuam diebus multis, donec apertum est: et cum tenta tentaui ipsum, et sensi extremitatem sagittae subtilem quae adhaeret in ligno.	Therefore I placed upon the wound a medicine sharp and corrosive for many days until it was opened: and when I probed it with a probe, and felt the subtle tip of the arrow adhering to the wood.
Deinde addidi in apertione uulneris per illam medicinam acutam, donec apparuit nobis uisibiliter extremitas sagittae: et praeteriit mihi cum eo spacium temporis circiter quatuor menses.	Then I added to the opening of the wound that sharp medicine, until the extremity of the arrow appeared visibly to us; and about four months passed with him in that time.
Deinde postquam amplificatum est uulnus, et possible fuit mihi intromittere forcipes in ipsam, et mouere ipsam, et non obediuit ad exitum: tunc non cessaui subtiliare, et ingeniare super eam cum modis ingeniorum, donec coepi super eam die quodam cum forcipibus decenter factis, secundum quod ueniet forma eorum in fine capituli, donec extraxi eam.	Then after the wound was enlarged, and it was possible for me to introduce forceps into it, and move it, and it did not obey to come out: then I did not cease to be subtle and ingenious over it with ways of ingenuity, until on one day I began over it with forceps made properly, according to what will come in the form of them at the end of the chapter, until I extracted it.
Deinde restauraui uulnus.	Then I restored the wound.
Et medici quidem iudicant, quod cartilago nasi non restauratur.	And indeed physicians judge that cartilage of the nose is not restored.
Restauraui ergo ipsam, et consolidatum est uulnus, et sanatus est infirmas sanitate integra: nec nocuit ei aliquid omnino.	Therefore, I restored it, and the wound was consolidated, and the infirm person was healed in complete health: and nothing harmed him at all.
Et ego narro tibi qualitatem extractionis quarundam sagittarum: ut ponas illud regulam et significationem super illud quod non dixi.	And I tell you the quality of the extraction of certain arrows: so that you may place that rule and meaning above what I have not said.
Quoniam partes huius artis et distinctiones earum non comprehenduntur cum narratione: neque comprehendit illud liber, et artifex prudens comparat cum pauco super multum: et cum eo quod est paesens, super illud quod est absens: et inuenit operationem nouam, et instrumentum nouum apud descensus rerum extranearum huius artis quando accidunt.	Because the parts of this art and their distinctions are not contained with the narration; nor does that book contain it, and a wise artificer compares little to much; and what is present to what is absent; and he finds a new operation and a new instrument among the descents of foreign things of this art when they occur.
Dico ergo, quod sagittae non egrediuntur ex membris quibus sunt fixae, nisi secundum duos modos.	Therefore I say that arrows do not come out of limbs where they are fixed unless according to two modes.
Aut per attractionem ex loco ex quo intrauit.	Or by drawing it out from where it entered.
Aut contrario partis alterius.	Or conversely of the other part.
Et illa quae egreditur unde intrauit, aut est sagitta procedens in loco carnoso: et attrahitur, et egreditur.	And that which goes out where it entered, is either an arrow going into fleshy place: and it is drawn and comes out.
Quod si non obedit ad exitum ex hora in qua cadit: tunc oportet ut dimittas ipsam aliquot diebus, donec putrefiat caro quae est in circumitu eius: et alleuietur attractio eius, et eius egressio.	If it does not obey to be brought out within the hour in which it falls: then you ought to let it go for several days, until the flesh which is around it putrefies, and the attraction of it is lessened, and its exit.
Et similiter si figitur in osse, et non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc dimitte ipsam etiam aliquot diebus: et itera eam cum attractione et motione omni die, donec egreditur.	And similarly if it is lodged in the bone and does not yield to you for exit, then leave it also for several days: and repeat it with traction and motion every day until it exits.
Quod si non obedit tibi ad exitum post dies, tunc oportet ut perfores in circumitu sagittae in ipso osse ab omni parte cum terebro subtili, donec amplificentur sagittae.	If it does not obey you at the end after days, then it is necessary that you perforate around the arrow in the bone itself from every part with a subtle borer until the arrows are amplified.
Deinde attrahe eam, et extrahe ipsam.	Then draw it out, and remove it.
Si autem sagitta est fixa in capitis osse, et iam processit in uno uentrium cerebri, et apparent ex infirmo quaedam illorum accidentium quae dixi: tunc abstine ab attractione sagittae, et dimitte eam, donec aequetur esse eius post dies.	If however the arrow is fixed in the bone of the head and has already progressed into one ventricle of the brain, and certain of those accidents which I have said appear from the sick person, then abstain from drawing out the arrow, and release it until it may be equal to be removed after days.
Nam si sagitta peruenit ad sifach, tunc mors non prolongatur ei.	For if an arrow has reached the liver, then death does not delay him.
Et si sagitta non est fixa, nisi in corpore ossis tantum, et non penetrat usque ad sifach: et remanet infirmus aliquot diebus, et non accidit ei ex illis accidentibus aliquid: tunc ingenia in attractione sagittae et extractione eius.	And if the arrow is not fixed, only in the bone and does not penetrate to the fascia, and remains weak for some days, and nothing happens to him from those accidents, then the minds are in the drawing of the arrow and its extraction.
Si autem est fixa ualde, et non obedit tibi ad attractionem: tunc administra terebella in circumitu sagittae, sicut narraui tibl: deinde cura locum, donec sanetur.	If however it is fixed tightly and does not obey you to be drawn out: then administer a leech around the arrow's circumference, as I have told you; then care for the place until it heals.
Si autem Sagitta iam absconsa est in loco corporis, et occultatur et absconditur a sensu: tunc inquire eam cum tenta.	If, however, the arrow is already hidden in the place of the body and it is concealed and hidden from sense: then seek it with a probe.
Si autem sentis eam, tunc attrahe eam cum quibusdam instrumentis quae conueniunt attractioni eius.	If you feel it, then draw it out with certain instruments which are suitable for its drawing out.
Si autem non potes super eam, propter constrictionem uulneris, et propter longitudinem sagittae in profundo: et non est illic os, neque neruus, neque uena: tunc finde super eam, donec amplificetur uulnus, et sit possibile extrahere sagittam.	If however you cannot pull it out because of the constriction of the wound, and because of the length of the arrow deep within: and there is no bone, nor nerve, nor vein there: then find over it, until the wound enlarges, and it is possible to extract the arrow.
Quod si sunt ei aures quibus teneatur, tunc libera carnem fixam in eis ab omni parte, omni ingenio quo potes illud, et ingenia, si non potest super euasionem carnis in fractura aurium, et contorsione earum, donec euadat.	If the ears are being held closed, then free the fixed flesh within them from every part, with every effort that you can, and with efforts, if it cannot be done over the protrusion of flesh in the fracture of the ears, and their twisting, until it drains.
Et tu quando administras extractionem Sagittae, in quocumque loco est, tunc utere contorsione manus tuae, cum forficibus ad partes omnes, donec facias eam euadere: et subtilia ultima subtilitate, ut non frangatur Sagita, et fiat difficilis tibi attractio eius, et ipsius extractio.	And when you administer the extraction of an arrow, wherever it is, then use the twisting of your hand, with forceps to all parts, until you make it come out: and with the most subtle last subtlety, so that the arrow does not break, and its attraction becomes difficult for you, and its extraction.
Quod si non potes super eam ex hora una, tunc dimitte eam diebus aliquot, donec putrefiant quae sunt in circumitu eius.	If you are not able to work on it for one hour, then dismiss her for several days until those around it putrify.
Deinde itera eam: alleuietur enim tuncia Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra quod diximus ex curatione in capitulo suo: et custodi uirtutem tuam ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, aut chordae.	Then repeat this: for if the wound is relieved. But if a bleeding contrary to you does, then administer that which we said from the cure in its chapter: and guard your strength from cutting the vein, or nerve, or tendon.
Et administra ingenium omni modo quo tibi possibile est euasionis Sagittae: et sit illud cum facilitate, et tranquillitate, uel tarditate, et firmitate, sicut narraui tibi.	And administer the mind in every way that is possible to you for the release of the arrow; and let it be with ease, and tranquility, or slowness, and firmness, just as I have told you.
Et oportet, ut facias cum trahis Sagittam, ut infirmus sit secundum figuram, secundum quam fuit apud casum Sagittae in ipso.	And it is necessary that you do when you pull out the arrow, that the weak be according to the figure, according to what was with the case of the arrow in itself.
Quoniam est magis iuuatiuum.	Because it is more helpful.
Si autem non est tibi possibile illud, tunc administra quod tibi est possibile ex figuris.	If that is not possible for you, then administer what is possible for you from the figures.
Sagitta autem quae egreditur ex contrario partis alterius, aut iam procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora: aut facit gibbositatem extremitas Sagittae per sensum ex superiore parte cutis propinquae, et uides eam eminentem: seca ergo super eam, et sit sectio secundum quantitatem quod capiant in ea forcipes.	The arrow that comes out from the opposite part of another, or something already proceeds from it to the exterior: or makes a convexity of the extremity of the arrow by feeling from the upper part of the skin close, and you see it protruding: therefore dry above it, and let the section be according to the quantity which the forceps take in it.
Deinde attrahe eam: ipsa namque fit facilis ad exitum.	Then draw it out: for indeed it becomes easy to exit.
Si uero retinetur in osse, tunc torque manum tuam secundum rotunditatem, donec imprimat Sagitta in osse, et amplificet sibiipsi: deinde trahe ipsam.	If it is held in the bone, then turn your hand according to the roundness until the arrow presses into the bone and enlarges itself; then draw it out.
Et si non: dimitte eam diebus aliquot: deinde itera eam, donec egrediatur.	And if not: dismiss her for a few days; then repeat it, until it comes out.
Quod si lignum Sagittae est in ea, tunc impelle ipsam cum eo.	If a wood of the shaft is in it, then drive it out with that.
Si autem cecidit lignum, et uis administrare impulsionem: tunc intromitte ad eam instrumentum concauum, ut ingrediatur concauitas eius in caudam Sagittae: deinde impelle eam cum ipso.	If a wood has fallen, and you wish to administer force: then introduce an instrument into it with a concave part, so that the concave part of it enters into the tail of the Arrow; then drive it in together with it.
Si autem Sagita est concaua, tunc impelle eam cum instrumento intrante in ipsam.	If, however, the arrow is concave, then drive it in with an instrument entering into it.
Sagitta enim alleuiatur per illud.	For the arrow is lifted up by this.
Quod si Sagitta est toxicata, tunc oportet, ut concaues carnem totam, in qua est uenenum: si est tibi possibile illud.	If the arrow is poisoned, then it is necessary to cut out all the flesh where the poison is; if that is possible for you.
Deinde cura eam cum eo quod conuenit ad illud.	Then care for it as is fitting.
Quod si Sagitta est cadens in pectore, aut in uentre, aut in uesica, aut in latere: et est propinqua ex eo quod tangis cum tenta, et possibile est tibi secare super eam: tunc seca, et caue ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, et extrahe eam.	If a dart is falling into the chest, or in the belly, or in the bladder, or in the side: and it is near because you touch it with your fingers, and it is possible for you to cut above it: then cut, and be cautious about the incision of the vein, or nerve, and extract it.
Deinde sue uulnus, si uides, et cura illud, donec sanetur.	Then suture the wound if you see it, and care for it until it heals.
Et haec est forma Forcipum, quibus extrahuntur Sagittae.	And this is the form of Forceps, with which arrows are removed.
Sint extremitates similes rostro auis, quae factae sunt sicut ferra: quando capiunt super Sagittam, non dimittunt eam.	Let the extremities be like the beak of a bird, which is made like iron: when they seize upon an arrow, they do not let it go.
Et fiunt ex eis species multae, magnae, et paruae, et mediae, secundum quantitatem magnitudinis Sagittae, et paruitatis eius, et amplitudinis uulneris, et constrictionis eius.	And many kinds are made from them, great and small, and medium, according to the quantity of magnitude of the arrow, and its smallness, and the width of the wound, and its constriction.
Forma Impellentis concaui.	Shape of the concave implement.
Et forma Impellentis surdi.	And the shape of the impeller for deafness.
Hoc est surdae extremitatis sicut Radius, ut alleuietur introitus eius in sagittam concauam, et impellatur cum eo.	This is for the end of a hard bone as if it were a radius, so that its entrance may be eased into a concave arrow and driven with it.
Huius extremitas impellentis concauae est concaua sicut penna auis: ut alleuietur introitus sagittae in ipsam et impulsio eius.	The extremity of this thrusting tool is concave like a bird's feather, so that the entrance of the arrow into it and its impact may be eased.
¶ De phlebotomia Venarum.	On the incision of veins.

Place a sharp point which is at the head of the Fossa upon the vein itself, and strike upon it with a comb, or with some other thing in this manner: and let blood flow according to the quantity that you wish.
Deinde solue perforationem infirmi, et stringe eam, donec sanetur.	Then close up the wound of the patient and bind it until it heals.
Et quandoque aperitur cum phlebotomo lato.	And sometimes it is opened with a wide vein-cutter.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut sit phlebotomus acutae extremitatis, sicut reliqui phlebotomi, imo sit latae extremitatis.	However, it ought not to be a sharp-edged incision of the extremity, like the rest of the incisions, but rather one of a broad edge.
Et phlebotoma eam secundum transuersionem: quoniam os est propinquum: et fortasse in eo frangetur phlebotomus quando est subtilis.	And the lancet should be applied across it, because the bone is close; and perhaps the lancet will break when it is fine.
¶ De phlebotomia Venarum in duobus Lachrymalibus.	On bloodletting of the veins in the two lacrimals.
Iuuamentum autem duarum Venarum quae sunt in duobus Lachrymalibus duorum oculorum, est ad oculum ex scabie et rubedine: et sebel in oculo, et aegritudinibus faciei.	A wound of two veins which are in the two lacrimals of the two eyes is to the eye from scabies and redness: and it is painful in the eye, and pains in the face.

Et fiat phlebotomia secundum transuersum ad longitudinem parum, cum phlebotomo paruo, lato parumper, nam in loco non est caro.	And let a phlebotomy be made transversely along a short length, with a small lancet, not too wide, for there is no flesh in the place.
Si enim phlebotomus est subtilis extremitatis, fortasse frangitur.	If the lancet is too fine at the extremity, it may perhaps break.
Deinde fac currere ex sanguine quantum est tibi necesse.	Then make it flow out of the blood as much as is necessary for you.
Et pone super eas cotum, et stringe eas nocte una, et solue eas.	And place upon them a pad, and bind them together at night one, and unbind them.
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Nasi.	On bloodletting of the veins of the nose.
Venae autem Nasi phlebotomia, est conferens ad febrem acutam, et sodam uehementem, et aegritudines faciei, sicut hemigraneam, et rubedinem quae accidit in facie: praecipue quando est antiqua.	The bloodletting of the veins of the nose is brought about by acute fever and violent phlegm and pains of the face, such as a migraine, and redness which happens on the face, especially when it is old.

Then hold his nose with your left hand, and take a fine, long lancet, and place it in the middle of his harelip, between that which distinguishes the nose according to straightness.
Quoniam uena non apparet sensui illic, et quia sanguis incipit fluere statim.	Because the vein does not appear to the sense there, and because blood begins to flow immediately.
Et oportet, ut ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo parumper: et facias currere ex sanguine secundum necessitatem tuam.	And it is necessary that you put your hand last with a lancet and make blood flow according to your need.
Deinde liga ipsam nocte una.	Then bind it tight at night with one bandage.
Ipsa enim restauratur uelociter.	It is indeed restored quickly.
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Guidegi.	On the phlebotomy of veins according to Guy de Chauliac.
Duarum uero Guidegi phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad constrictionem anhelitus, et incaeptionem leprae, et aegritudines melancholicas, et impetiginem et ulcera mala, et corrodentibus, id est, herpetibus estiomenis.	The use of two veins for phlebotomy is good for the constriction of breath, and the beginning of leprosy, and melancholy illnesses, and sores that are bad, and ulcers that are corroding, that is to say, those that are caused by herpes.

Deinde fac similiter de uena alia.	Then do similarly with the other vein.
Postea solue ligamentum, et stringe duas uenas strictura media: ut non praefocetur infirmus.	Afterwards, dissolve the ligament, and tightly bind two veins in the middle section: so that the patient does not bleed excessively.
Et dimitte eam usque mane.	And let her be released until morning.
Sanatur enim uulnus.	A wound is healed.
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Algeberich.	On bloodletting from veins, by Al-Gebar.
Venae autem Algeberich phlebotomiae iuuamentum est: quia confert ad alcolam in ore, et corruptionem gingiuae: et ulcera mala: et fissuras labiorum, et ulcera mala, etiam quae sunt in naso, et in circumitu eius.	The veins of Albucasis are a help for phlebotomy: because it brings relief to the mouth from alcohol and gum disease; and ulcers that are bad; and fissures of the lips, and bad ulcers, even those which are in the nose and around it.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae earum est, ut facias sedere infirmum coram te: et stringe collum eius cum uitta.	And the quality of bloodletting is that you make the sick person sit before you: and bind his neck with a cloth.
Deinde reuolue labium eius, et aspice ad duas uenas: quarum una est a dextera labii, et secunda a sinistra eius: et demonstratio utriusque est per nigredinem ambarum.	Then roll back the lip and look at two veins: one is from the right side of the lip, and the second from the left side of it: and the demonstration of both is by the blackness of both.
Et illud uerum est: quia in circumitu earum sunt uenae minutae, nigrae.	And this is true: for in the circuit of them are veins small and black.
Incide ergo utramque incisione incidente.	Therefore, make both incisions with a cutting.
Si autem dubitatio est super te, et non scis quae earum est: tunc intende ad incisionem maioris earum, et ipsarum manifestiorem.	If there is doubt about you, and you do not know which of them it is: then attend to the incision of the greater ones, and those more manifest.
Et similiter fac de duabus uenis quae sunt in labio superiore: et plurimum quidem currit consuetudo cum eo: et incide duas uenas quae sunt in labio inferiori.	And similarly do this with the two veins that are in the upper lip: and very much indeed is it customary to do so: and cut the two veins that are in the lower lip.
¶ De phlebotomia Venae sub lingua post Cephalicae phlebotomiam.	On Phlebotomy.  Veins under the tongue after cephalic phlebotomy.
Duarum uero Venarum quae sunt sub lingua phlebotomiae iuuamentum: est, quod phlebotomia Cephalicae est ad praefocationes quae sunt in gutture, et aegritudinem uuulae, et aegritudines oris.	Of the two veins which are under the tongue, a benefit from phlebotomy is this: that cephalic phlebotomy is good for inflammations that are in the throat, and for pain of the uvula, and for pains of the mouth.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eas est, ut sedeat infirmus inter manus tuas coram sole: et eleualinguam eius, et aspice sub lingua a latere eius uno uenam, et a latere eius alio uenam: et color utriusque decliuis ad nigredinem.	And the quality of phlebotomy is such that the sick person should sit between your hands before the sun: and elevate his tongue, and look under his tongue on one side for a vein, and on the other side for a vein; and the color of both sloping towards blackness.
Phlebotoma ergo utramque: et custodi, ne ultimes manum tuam in phlebotomando eas.	Therefore cut both veins: and guard, so that you do not put your hand at the last in cutting the veins.
Nam sub eius sunt arteriae, et fortasse accidet fluxus sanguinis ex illis arteriis.	For under it are arteries, and perhaps there will be a flow of blood from those arteries.
¶ De tribus Venis in cubito.	On the three veins in the elbow.
Venae autem tres quae phlebotomantur in cubito, sunt in quarum phlebotomia cucurrit consuetudo in omnibus hominibus.	The veins that are cut in the arm, of which the practice of bloodletting is customary in all men, there are three.
Et phlebotomia earum fit secundum duos modos.	And bloodletting is done according to two modes.
Aut pungendo cum phlebotomo myrtino lato: aut oliuari ad subtilitatem decliui: aut secando cum phlebotomo cultellari, et est Alnesil.	Or by pricking with a broad myrtle-wood lancet: or an olive tree to the fineness of the slope: or cutting with a knife lancet, and this is Alnesil.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its shape.
Sic Alnesil est, quod conuenit ad sectionem.	Thus Al-Zahrawi is, which is suitable for the cutting.
Et ex eis sunt species latae, et subtiles secundum amplitudinem uenarum et stricturam earum Forma phlebotomi myrtini sit lata, sicut uides.	And among these there are broad and fine kinds, according to the width of the veins and their constriction. The form of the phlebotomy knife should be broad, as you see.
Et conuenit ad aperiendas uenas concauas, plenas, procedentes, apparentes, grossas, et illas quae continent sanguinem grossum, turbidum.	And it is appropriate to open the concave, full, emerging, apparent, thick veins, and those which contain thick, turbid blood.
Et iste phlebotomus est minoris latitudinis, et subtilioris extreminatis.	And this lancet is of lesser width and more delicate tip.
Et conuenit ad phlebotomiam uenarum subtilium, quae continent sanguinem subtilem citrinum	And it is fitting for phlebotomy of the veins delicate, which contain blood fine and yellowish.
¶ De phlebotomia Basilicae.	On Phlebotomy in Basilica
Basilicae autem quae est una harum trium uenarum phlebotomiae iuuamentum est.	The basilica, which is one of these three veins, is helpful for bloodletting.
Quia extrahit sanguinem ex aegritudinibus, quae sunt sub gutture et collo, ex eo quod sequitur pectus, et uentrem: et conuenit phlebotomatori cum phlebotomat eam, ut caueat, et sit super timorem ex ea nam sub ea est arteria.	Because it draws blood from ailments that are in the throat and neck, because it follows the chest, and the belly: and it behooves the phlebotomist with the phlebotomy, that he beware, and be above fear from it for under it is an artery.
Si ergo errat, et addit in punctura phlebotomi, incidet illam arteriam, et accidet fluxus sanguinis.	If therefore he errs, and adds in the incision of a vein, he will cut that artery, and there will be a flow of blood.
Quapropter oportet, ne phlebotomet eam cum phlebotomo pungente: imo sit secans cum Alnesil.	Therefore it is necessary that she be not lanced with a sharp lancet; rather let it be cutting with an Alnesil.
Quod si non apparet Basilica apparitione manifesta, tunc oportet, ut alienes ipsam, et permuteris ad aliam, aut quaeras aliquem ramum eius: aut phlebotomes loco eius Funem brachii.	If Basilica does not appear with manifest appearance, then it is necessary that one take the same from elsewhere and change it to another, or seek out some branch of it; or cut a vein in the arm instead of its place.
Ipsa enim est manifesta, et seca eam cum phlebotomo Anesil, sicut diximus.	For it is manifest and dry it with the phlebotome Anesil, as we have said.
Si autem uis phlebotomiam ipsius eiusdem, tunc oportet ante stricturam brachii, ut tangas locum, donec cognoscas locum pulsus.	If you wish to perform phlebotomy on him, then it is necessary before the constriction of the arm, so that you touch the place until you know the place of the pulse.
Deinde signa super locum cum encaustro, postea brachium, et seca uenam sectione concaua cum phlebotomo Alnesil, sicut diximus.	Then signs over the place with wax, then the arm, and dry the vein with a concave incision with the Alnesil lancet, as we said.
Et caue ne cadat percussio per spacium a loco arteriae.	And take care that the blow does not fall through the space from the place of the artery.
Et quando uides, cum tu stringis ligamen, inflationem in loco quem signasti cum encaustro, tunc illa inflatio est inflatio arteriae: deuita ergo eam.	And when you see, when you tighten the ligature, an inflation at the place which you marked with the cautery, then that inflation is the inflation of the artery: therefore avoid it.
Quod si uides sanguinem apud phlebotomiam salire, sicut urina pueri, et est sanguis subtilis, rubeus: tunc scias, quia est ex sanguine arteriae.	If you see blood rising in phlebotomy like a boy's urine, and it is thin blood, red: then you know that it is from the artery's blood.
Tunc ergo propera, et pone digitum tuum super ipsum spacio longo, deinde aufer digitum tuum.	Therefore hasten, and place your finger upon it for a long space, then remove your finger.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis (multotiens namque abscinditur) tunc stringe brachium, et dimitte ipsum: et caueat infirmus a motione eius: et sit super timorem eius.	If therefore blood is cut (for it is often cut), then bind the arm and let it go: and let the sick person beware of movement of it: and be above his fear.
Et non moueat ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	And let it not be moved for several days until it is healed.
Si autem non abscinditur sanguis, et uincit te: et non est tibi praesens in momento tuo medicina, tunc incide arteriam, si apparet tibi.	If blood does not cease flowing and overcomes you, and medicine is not present at the moment for you, then cut the artery if it appears to you.
Nam extremitates eius contrahuntur, et abscinditur sanguis.	For its extremities are contracted, and blood is cut off.
Aut accipe corticem fistici, et finde eum: accipe medietatem unam, et stringe eam super locum uenae strictura decenti, cum ligamento et puluillis usque ad diem alium.	Or take a piece of fisetum bark and pound it fine; take half of it, and bind it over the place of the vein constriction appropriately, with a ligature and pads until the next day.
Tunc si abscinditur sanguis, est bonum.	Then if the blood is cut off, it is good.
Et si non: tunc cura ipsum cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio ex loco puluerum abscindentium fluxum sanguinis: et abscisio sanguinis eius non est difficilis in pluribus dispositionibus, propter locum paruum uulneris, et possibilitatem ligamenti ex brachio.	And if not so: then care for it with him whose predecessor was remembrance of the place of dust cutting off blood flow: and the cutting off of his blood is not difficult in many dispositions, because of the small place of the wound, and the possibility of tying from the arm.
¶ De phlebotomia uenae Fuscae.	On the vein for bloodletting, the Fusca.
Venae autem Fuscae phlebotomiae iuuamentum est, quod trahit sanguinem ex superiori parte capitis, et inferiore corporis: propterea, quia est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae, sicut diximus.	The veins of the arm are beneficial for bloodletting, because they draw blood from the upper part of the head and lower part of the body: because it is composed of the Basilica branch and the Cephalic branch, as we said.
Et conuenit phlebotomanti eam, ut sit super timorem ex phlebotomia eius, nam sub ea est neruus.	And it is fitting for the phlebotomist that he be above fear from his phlebotomy, for under it is a nerve.
Si ergo addit in punctura phlebotomi, et inuenit neruum, accidit in ea stupor, et difficilis fit sanatio eius, et fortasse non sanatur penitus.	If therefore he adds in the puncture of phlebotomy, and finds a nerve, it happens in it numbness, and difficult becomes its healing, and perhaps not healed fully.
Et iste neruus multotiens apparet sensui.	And this nerve appears many times to the sense.
Si autem occultatur in quibusdam hominibus, et est subtilis, et non ostenditur: tunc oportet ut ponas phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas, sectionem cum Alnesil, et deuita neruum cum fortitudine tua.	If it is hidden in some men and is subtle and does not show itself: then you must place your phlebotomy there where you will make the incision with the Alnesil and deviate the nerves with your strength.
Quod si uena est inter duos neruos, tunc finde uenam in longitudine.	If a vein is between two nerves, then find the vein in length.
¶ De uena Cephalica.	On the cephalic vein.
Phlebotomiae autem uenae Cephalicae iuuamentum est, quia attrahit sanguinem ex capite, et confert ad aegritudines oculorum.	The phlebotomy of the cephalic veins is a benefit because it draws blood from the head and brings it to aid eye ailments.
Et oportet in hac uena proprie, si uis, ut phlebotomes eam pungendo cum phlebotomo oliuari, aut cum phlebotomo myrtino: quoniam est saluior uenarum omnium, quoniam non est subea arteria, neque neruus.	And it is necessary in this vein properly, if you wish, that a phlebotome be used to puncture it with an olive-wood phlebotome, or with a myrtle-wood phlebotome: because it is the safest of all veins, because there is no artery beneath it, nor a nerve.
Verumtamen conuenit tibi apud phlebotomiam, ut deuites cum phlebotomo caput lacerti tantum, et quaeras locum leniorem: et non nocet ei, si non inuenitur cum percussione prima, ut iteretur super eam cum phlebotomia aliquotiens.	Nevertheless, it is fitting for you in phlebotomy, that you avoid cutting the head of the lizard only with the lancet, and seek a softer place: and it does not harm him if, when the first percussion is not found, to repeat over it with the lancet several times.
Verumtamen fortasse apostematur in quibusdam hominibus quando non phlebotomatur in percussione prima, sed non nocet ei illud apostema in aliquo.	Nevertheless perhaps a boil may arise in certain men when it is not cut out in the first percussion, but it does not harm him in any way.
¶ De utilitate Phlebotomiae, et cautelis in ea obseruandis.	On the usefulness of phlebotomy, and the precautions to be observed in it.
Qualitas autem Phlebotomiae, et accidentia eius ex ea, in cuius rectificatione oportet te cogitare.	The quality of phlebotomy, and its accidents from it, which you ought to consider in its correction.
Primum ergo illius est de quo oportet ut scias, quod phlebotomia non administratur, nisi in conseruatione sanitatis, et perseuerantia eius, et cautela ab aduentu aegritudinum.	First of all, it is important for you to know that phlebotomy is not administered unless it is for the preservation of health and its persistence, and caution against the arrival of illnesses.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in una uenarum trium quae sunt in cubito, scilicet Cephalica, et Fusca, et Basilica.	And that a phlebotomy is made in one of the three veins which are in the elbow, namely Cephalic, and Black, and Basilica.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in principio Veris super ieiunium, in uere, et aestate: et autumno, et hyeme post comestionem, quando apparent significationes repletionis.	And that venesection may be performed at the beginning of Spring on an empty stomach, in summer, and in autumn, and in winter after a meal, when signs of fullness appear.
Et fiat phlebotomia in die primo, aut in tertio, postquam praeterierint de die tres horae.	And a bloodletting should be performed on the first day, or on the third day, after three hours have passed.
Phlebotomia autem quae administratur in aegritudinibus, non habet horam determinatam: sed quando prouocat conuenientia et necessitas ad illud, in nocte, aut die, et in omni hora, et in omni tempore.	Bloodletting, which is administered in illnesses, does not have a determined hour: but when it provokes convenience and necessity to that, at night, or day, and at every hour, and at every time.
Et non oportet, ut phlebotomentur pueri, donec ueniant super eos quatuordecim anni.	And it is not right that boys should be bled until they reach fourteen years of age.
Neque phlebotometur mulier praegnans, nisi a mense quarto usque ad septimum.	A pregnant woman should not be bled except from the fourth to the seventh month.
Neque phlebotomentur senes, qui iam pertransierunt sexaginta annos.	The elderly, who have passed sixty years, should not be bled.
Cum ergo aliquis uult phlebotomari propter quemcumque modum sit: oportet, ut mundificet intestina sua ante phlebotomiam cum clisteri leni, si in eis est stercus multum retentum: ut non attrahant uenae apud phlebotomiam ex intestinis superfluitates putridas nocentes membris principalibus.	When therefore someone wants to undergo phlebotomy for any reason, it is necessary that he cleanse his bowels before phlebotomy with a gentle enema if there is much feces retained in them: so that the veins at phlebotomy do not draw up putrid superfluities from the intestines harmful to the principal members.
Neque phlebotometur patiens toctina, id est, satietatem nauseatiuam: neque crapulatus, neque euadens ab ebrietate, donec remoueatur illud ab eis.	Nor should a patient who is vomiting be bled, that is, suffering from nausea, nor one who has been drinking too much, nor one who is recovering from drunkenness, until that is removed from them.
Neque infirmus cum hydropisi.	Nor one with dropsy.
Et caueatur phlebotomia iterum post colicam passionem, et uomitum, et fluxum uentris, et multiplicationem coitus, et laboris, et exercitii, et uigiliarum, et ieiunii, et omnis quod dissoluit uirtutem ex re corporea aut animali.	And let phlebotomy be avoided again after colic passion, and vomiting, and flux of the belly, and multiplication of intercourse, and labor, and exercise, and vigils, and fasting, and all that dissolves the strength from the body or animal.
Deinde considera in subtilitate humorum ante illud, si sanguis est grossus cum cibis et potibus, et medicinis: si possibile est ei illud.	Then consider the subtlety of humors before that, if blood is thick with food and drink, and medicines: if it is possible for it.
Deinde introeat balneum, si non prohibet ipsum aliquid: aut exercitetur aliquo exercitio, ut subtilietur sanguis.	Then he should enter the bath, if nothing prevents him; or he should exercise in some way, so that the blood may be made more subtle.
Et pone phlebotomiam eius in pectore, circa tertiam diei, sicut diximus: et conare, ut euacuetur pectus eius illa die ex omnibus accidentibus animalibus malis: sicut angustia, et ira, et timor: et ex omnibus accidentibus corporeis, sicut labor, et poena, et superfluicoitus, et illis similia.	And place his phlebotomy in his chest, around the third day, as we have said; and try, so that his chest may be emptied on that day of all animal bad accidents: such as constriction, and anger, and fear: and from all bodily accidents, such as labor, and punishment, and superfluity, and those similar.
Et sedi suae faciat esse praesentes res cum quarum usu cucurrit consuetudo hominum ex aromaticitate, et odoramento, et tripudio et similibus illis per quantitatem possibilitatis.	And let him make his seat to be present with things of which use men have grown accustomed from fragrance, and smell, and frolic, and similar ones in the amount of possibility.
Deinde sedeat phlebotomator super puluinari, quod sit altius quam puluinar phlebotomandi: postea extrahat brachium suum, et fricet ipsum phlebotomator manu sua bis, aut ter.	Then let the bloodletter sit on a stool which is higher than the patient's bed; afterwards he shall draw out his arm and rub it with his hand two or three times.
Deinde stringat ligamentum cum corrigia, et inuoluat eam bis.	Then tighten the ligament with corrections, and wrap it twice.
Et sit strictura temperata, quoniam strictura quando est inaequalis, aut per superfluitatem in strictura, tunc prohibet cursum sanguinis: aut in mollificatione, tunc etiam prohibet cursum sanguinis.	And let the constriction be moderate, because when a constriction is unequal, either by excess in the constriction, then it prevents the course of blood; or in softening, then it also prevents the course of blood.
Deinde post stricturam oportet, ut fricet phlebotomandus manus suas simul adinuicem, donec inflentur uenae, et declarentur sensui.	Then after the constriction, it is necessary for the one cutting to rub his hands together until the veins swell and become evident to the sense.
Deinde abstergat phlebotomator phlebotomum cum pauco oleo, antiquo proprie.	Then the surgeon removes the leech with a little oil, properly old.
Deinde ponat digitum suum indicem manus sinistrae super ipsam uenam sub loco cuius phlebotomiam uult, parum: ut non fugiat uena, et cassetur percussio.	Then he places his index finger of the left hand over the vein in the place where he wants to perform phlebotomy, lightly: so that the vein does not escape and the percussion may fall.
Quoniam ex uenis est quam inuenis sicut chordam fugientem apud phlebotomiam: et ex eis est quae est plena uentositate: et quando ponis phlebotomum super eam, contrahitur sub phlebotomo, et decipitur phlebotomator, et non aperit phlebotomus uenam: et si aperit eam, est stricta: propter illud ergo oportet, ut firmetur phlebotomator, et sit sollicitus in his rebus omnibus.	Because the vein is like a fleeing string in phlebotomy; and from them is that which is full of windiness; and when you place the phlebotomist upon it, it contracts under the phlebotomist, and the phlebotomist is deceived, and does not open the vein; and if he opens it, it is strict; therefore it is necessary that the phlebotomist be firm and solicitous in all these things.
Deinde deponat phlebotomum.	Then he puts down the lancet.
Si ergo aperitur uena ex uice una, tunc bonum est.	If therefore a vein is opened from one vice, then it is good.
Et si non, tunc itera illud uice alia sub illo loco parum, aut supra ipsum cum festinatione: si non apostematur locus.	And if not, then repeat this under another place a little below it, or above it with haste; if the place does not suppurate.
Quod si apostematur, aut expauescit infirmus, tunc dimitte eum die, aut duobus diebus: et non stringat ligamentum.	If it is suppurating or a weak person flees, then dismiss him on the day or two days, and do not tie a bandage tightly.
Fortasse enim attrahet apostema calidum.	Perhaps it will draw a hot abscess.
Neque ingrediatur balneum.	He should not enter a bath.
Deinde iteret phlebotomiam, si amat.	Then he would repeat bloodletting, if he wished.
Quod si apertio est parua, aut currit sanguis subtiliter: et times ut non egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uis: tunc itera phlebotomum in foramine ipso secundum rectitudinem, et adde in operatione parum.	If the opening is small, or blood flows gently: and you fear that the quantity of blood which you desire will not come forth; then repeat the incision into the wound according to straightness, and add little to the operation.
Et fac illud cum festinatione, antequam apostemetur locus, apostematus enim locus est in multis hominibus apud operationem paruam.	And do this with haste, before the place becomes closed up, for a closed place is found in many men at the time of a minor operation.
Si ergo uides ipsum iam apostematum, tunc non iteres super ipsum omnino, non enim excusat apud te aliquid.	If therefore you see the abscess itself, then do not return upon it at all, for it excuses nothing before you.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex faece olei: quoniam alleuiat cursum sanguinis.	And place over it something of the oil of feces; because it will alleviate the course of blood.
Et est melior in hoc loco quam oleum ipsum, et quam reliqua olea.	And it is better in this place than oil itself, and than the rest of the olive.
Et similiter administra faecem olei in omni phlebotomia tua, qua phlebotomas uenas apud prohibitionem cursus sanguinis: et faciunt illud tyriaca alfarach, et sagzenea, quando ponitur ex una earum super locum.	And similarly administer the feces of oil in all your bloodletting, wherever you cut veins to prohibit the flow of blood; and they make this from tyriaca alfarach, and sagzenea, when it is placed over the place from one of them.
Sanguis enim subtiliatur et resoluitur, quando est grossus.	Blood is refined and dissolved when it is thick.
Quod si accidat in loco phlebotomiae apostema magnum, nam multotiens accidit, praecipue ei qui non est phlebotomatus nisi uice illa, aut est apertio uenae parua, tunc propera et pone super locum spongiam infusam in aqua et sale, calefacta parumper: et stringe eam hora una: quoniam soluitur.	If a large abscess occurs at the site of incision, which often happens, especially to those who are not routinely bled or have only a small vein opened, then quickly place a sponge soaked in hot water and salt over the area and bind it for one hour, because it will loosen.
Et oportet, ut facias illud post exitum sanguinis ex uena ipsa, cum complemento sui, aut ex uena alia.	And it is necessary that you do this after the blood has exited from the very vein, with its completion, or from another vein.
Quod si remanet in loco post dies aliquid nigredinis, aut uiriditatis, non nocet illud: et si uis, pone super ipsum aliquid aloe, aut myrrhae solutorum: aut aliquid ex succo menthastri, id est, calamenti aut simile illius.	If something remains in place after days, some blackness or greenness, it does no harm: and if you wish, put on top of it something of aloe, or myrrh dissolved, or something from the juice of mint, that is, a balm or something similar to it.
Et multotiens quidem accidunt apostemata et eminentiae apud phlebotomiam Basilicae.	And abscesses and swellings frequently occur in bloodletting at the Basilica.
Pone ergo manum tuam super ipsam, tunc si inuenis molliciem apud compressionem tuam super ipsam, tunc illa eminentia est mala.	Therefore place your hand upon it, then if you find softness at your compression upon it, then that prominence is bad.
Caue ergo, ut ponas super eam aliquid ex eo quod diximus.	Therefore, take care that you place something upon it from what we have said.
Nam fortasse fluet ex ea sanguis arteriae.	For perhaps blood will flow from it of the artery.
Sed fac emplastrum ei cum eo in quo est stipticitas, ut induretur locus.	But make a plaster for him with that which has astringency, that the place may be closed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for him with the rest of the care until he is healed.
Et oportet, ut extrahas omni homini ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis suae.	And it is necessary that you extract from every man according to the quantity of his virtue.
Et quod apparet ex colore uincente super sanguinem.	And what appears from the color winning over blood.
Nam sanguis si est niger, tunc dimitte ipsum exire, donec rubeat: et similiter si uides ipsum grossum: tunc dimitte eum, donec subtilietur: et similiter si est acutus, donec auferatur acuitas eius.	For if the blood is black, then let it flow out until it turns red; and similarly if you see it thick, then let it flow out until it becomes thin; and similarly if it is sharp, until its sharpness is removed.
Et oportet ei qui est plenus, fortis, et indiget extractione sanguinis uice una, ut amplificetur phlebotomia uenae, et sit phlebotomus latus: et in eo qui est debilis, sit econtrario illius.	And he who is full, strong, and needs bloodletting only once, let the incision of the vein be widened, and let the phlebotomy be broad; and in him who is weak, let it be the opposite of this.
Et oportet, ut extrahat ipsum in uicibus, et ut sit foramen strictum: et melius quod administratur in phlebotomia uenae est, ut sit transuersa sectio, non punctura.	And it is necessary that he extract it with a probe, and that the hole be narrow; and it is better that what is administered in bloodletting of the vein is a transverse section, not a puncture.
Et iste modus phlebotomiae est saluus a fluxu sanguinis, et ab incisione nerui: et est laudabilior, et saluior quam phlebotomia per latitudinem et longitudinem.	And this method of bloodletting is safe from the flow of blood, and from the cutting of the nerve: and it is more praiseworthy, and safer than bloodletting across width and length.
Et cui consueuit peruenire apud phlebotomiam syncopis, oportet ut cibes ante phlebotomiam modico pane infuso in aqua granati muzi: aut secaniabin, si est calefactus: et extrahas ei ex sanguine in tribus uicibus, aut quatuor.	And to one who is accustomed to fainting during bloodletting, it is necessary that before bloodletting he eat bread slightly soaked in pomegranate juice or boiled grains, if heated: and draw out his blood in three or four ounces.
Et si est infrigidatae complexionis, tunc accipiat ante phlebotomiam panem infusum in syrupo miua, aut in syrupo de melle aromatizato cum speciebus, aut in syrupo aromatizato odorifero.	And if it is of a chilled constitution, then let him take before phlebotomy bread soaked in syrup of myrrh, or in a syrup of honey flavored with spices, or in an aromatic fragrant syrup.
Quod si accidat syncopis apud phlebotomiam, et est caussa eius exitus sanguinis multi: tunc oportet, ut sumat in potu aquam carnis, et syrupum odoriferum subtilem: et utatur aromaticitate cum algalia, et liniatur pectus eius cum ea: et utatur reliquis quae diximus in diuisione in capitulo syncopis ex euacuatione.	If fainting occurs during bloodletting, and the cause is the exit of much blood, then it is necessary that he should take in a drink of meat water, and a subtle fragrant syrup; and use aromatics with sea salt, and liniment his chest with it; and use the rest which we have said in the division in the chapter on fainting from evacuation.
Qui autem uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo: oportet ei cuius phlebotomia est propter euacuationem multam, et uirtus eius est debilis, ut soluat sanguinem paulatim per quantitatem uirtutis in diebus continuis.	He who wishes to bleed his arm and release his blood the second time: it is necessary for him whose phlebotomy is due to excessive evacuation and whose strength is weak, to release his blood gradually according to the amount of strength in continuous days.
Qui uero uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo, et est corpus eius forte: tunc faciat illud post septem horas, aut nouem a phlebotomia sua prima.	Whoever wants to drain his arm and loosen his blood second, and his body is strong: then let him do it after seven hours, or nine from his first incision.
Qui autem uult attrahere sanguinem ex corpore suo ad contrarium partis ad quam declinat: oportet ut euentetur ei in die secundo, aut in tertio.	Whoever wants to draw blood from his body to the opposite part to which it declines: it is necessary for him to be bled on the second or third day.
In cuius uero corpore est sanguis multus iam calefactus, et acuitur, et facit accidere febrem: oportet, ut egrediatur ex eo sanguis in uice una, et extrahatur ex eo quantitas multa: et amplificetur apertio usquequo accidat syncopis: postquam tu fueris conseruans omnes conditiones phlebotomiae: et ut ponas manum tuam super pulsum eius apud cursum sanguinis, ut non accidat mors loco syncopis.	In whose body there is much blood already heated, and it becomes sharp, and makes fever happen: it is necessary that the blood should leave from it in one vein, and a large quantity be drawn out of it; and the opening should be enlarged until syncope occurs; after you have kept all the conditions of phlebotomy; and so that you place your hand upon his pulse at the course of the blood, so that death does not happen instead of syncope.
Multotiens enim accidit illud, quando ignorat phlebotomator, et cadit negligentia.	Many times indeed it happens that the phlebotomist is ignorant, and negligence falls.
Et non oportet quando uis soluere brachium, et soluere sanguinem secundo, cum iam clausum sit orificium uenae, et fiat difficilis exitus sanguinis, ut prematur super ipsum cum uehementia, et curuatum extendatur uelociter.	And it is not necessary when you want to loosen the arm and loose the blood a second time, when already the opening of the vein is closed and difficult exit of the blood is made, that you press upon it with vehemence, and quickly stretch out the cupped vessel.
Nam illud est malum ualde, imo dimitte ipsum, donec phlebotometur secundo.	For that is a grievous evil, indeed let it be left alone until it is opened by a second incision.
Aut remoue cum acuitate phlebotomi illud quod coagulatum est ex sanguine in orificio uenae, et pone super ipsum aliquid salis dissoluti in aqua.	Or remove with the sharpness of a phlebotomy instrument that which has clotted from blood at the opening of the vein, and place upon it something dissolved salt in water.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex tyriaca alfaroch, aut sagzenea, et pone ipsum compressione leni, donec egrediatur sanguis.	And place upon it something of tyriaca alfaroch, or sagzenea, and place it with a gentle compression, until the blood flows out.
Si uero iam apostemata est uena, tunc dimitte eam, et non tegas eam, donec sedetur apostema.	If a vein has already been opened in an abscess, then let it be left open and not tied up until the abscess sits.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad soluendum sanguinem secundo, et non est excusatio, tunc aut phlebotoma ipsum supra illum locum, aut in brachio alio in uena alia.	If necessity compels bloodletting a second time and there is no excuse, then either the phlebotomist should cut above that place or in another arm in another vein.
Funis autem brachii phlebotomatur loco Fuscae, et Basilicae, cum non inueniuntur, et sunt occultae, quoniam est composita ex eis.	The brachial vein is cut at the site of Fuscca and Basílica, if they are not found and are hidden, because it is composed of them.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus manum suam in aqua calida, donec rubeat focile, et appareat uena manifeste.	And the quality of bloodletting is that the sick person should put his hand into hot water until the vein becomes red and appears plainly.
Deinde stringatur super ipsam cum ligamento parum constrictione media.	Then it is bound over itself with a bandage of moderate constriction in the middle.
Deinde phlebotoma secundum transuersationem paulatim, non latitudinaliter, neque secundum longitudinem: et sit apertio ampla, et sit phlebotomia tua qua eam phlebotomas super iuncturam manus parumper.	Then the incision is made with the lancet according to transversal direction, not lengthwise or laterally; and let the opening be wide, and let your incision be such that it cuts across the joint of the hand for a short distance.
Quod si prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera manum in aqua calida, et dimitte sanguinem currere in aqua, donec consequaris necessitatem tuam.	If he prevents the exit of blood, then immerse your hand in hot water, and let the blood flow into the water until you achieve your need.
Si autem fueris in diebus aestatis, tunc excusaris ab iteratione manus in aqua calida.	If, however, you are in the days of summer, then you are excused from the repetition of hands in hot water.
Et plurimum quidem ponitur cursus sanguinis in aqua calida in tempore hyemis.	And indeed very much blood flow is put in warm water in time of winter.
Et phlebotomia huius uenae est saluior omnibus uenis, quoniam non est sub ea uena pulsatilis, neque neruus.	And bloodletting from this vein is healthier than all veins, because there is no pulsating artery beneath this vein, nor a nerve.
Phlebotomia uero Saluatellae manus dextrae, est conferens aegritudinibus epatis.	A bloodletting of the right hand of Saluatella is beneficial for liver ailments.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringas mahason manus cum ligamento, aut manu tua, postquam tu intromittis eam in aquam calidam, donec infletur uena, et demonsteretur sensui ualde.	And the quality of phlebotomy is that you tie a vein with a band on the hand, or with your own hand, after you have put it into warm water until the vein swells and becomes apparent to the sense.
Deinde phlebotoma eam transuersando.	Then with the lancet crossing it.
Et si incidis eam totaliter, non nocebit ei illud in aliquo.	And if you cut it entirely, it will not harm him in anything.
Et conserua, ne ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo.	And preserve, so that you will not bring your hand to the vein cutter at last.
Sub ea enim sunt nerui digitorum denudati ex carne.	Under this are the nerves of the fingers stripped of flesh.
Deinde itera manum ad aquam calidam, et dimitte currere sanguinem in ea.	Then again the hand to the warm water, and let blood run in it.
Nam si tu non iteras eam in aqua calida, coagulatur sanguis in orificio uenae, et prohibetur a cursu.	For if you do not repeat it in hot water, the blood clots in the opening of the vein, and its course is prevented.
Cum ergo extraxeris ex sanguine quantitatem necessitatis, tunc pone super uenam oleum et sal: ut non consolidetur uelociter.	When therefore you have extracted from the blood the quantity of necessity, then place upon the vein oil and salt: that it may not solidify quickly.
Et similiter oportet, ut facias cum omni ramo stricto.	And similarly, it is necessary that you do with every strict branch.
Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae eius ex manu sinistra, est: quoniam est conferens ad aegritudines splenis: et similiter fac in phlebotomia eius, sicut fecisti in secunda aequaliter.	The incision for phlebotomy from the left hand is because it is connected to spleen ailments; and similarly do so in phlebotomy as you did in the second equally.
Saphenae autem phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad aegritudines quae sunt in inferiori parte corporis, sicut aegritudines matricum, et retentionem menstruorum, et infirmitates renum, et ulcera coxarum et crurium antiqua, et similia ex aegritudinibus.	The benefit of cutting the saphenous vein is for ailments that are in the lower part of the body, such as pains of the womb, and retention of menses, and infirmities of the kidneys, and ulcers of the hips and legs, old, and similar illnesses.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus pedem suum in aquam calidam: et faciat super ipsum fricationem, donec exuberent uenae: et liga supra iuncturam pedis cum corrigia.	And the quality of phlebotomy is that the sick person puts his foot into warm water, and he makes friction upon it until the veins become swollen, and binds above the joint of the foot with a bandage.
Et uenae quidem locus est apud calcaneum, apparens uersus pollicem: et ramificantur ex ea in facie pedis rami multi.	And indeed veins are located at the heel bone, appearing towards the thumb: and they branch out from it on the face of the foot many branches.
Phlebotoma ergo eam in ampliore ramo eius, aut apud calcaneum in aggregatione eius: quoniam est melius et saluius.	Therefore, the phlebotomy is performed in the larger branch of the vein, or at the heel in its cluster; because it is better and more salutary.
Quod si phlebotomas eam in facie pedis, tunc caue a neruis qui sunt sub ea super faciem pedis.	If one cuts the vein on the face of the foot, then carefully cut away from the nerves that are below it on the face of the foot.
Et pone phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas ex transuerso, quasi tu uelis incidere eam: et sit phlebotomus Nesil.	And place your incision for venesection as you wish to make it transversely, and let the scalpel be Nesil.
Si autem prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera pedem eius in aqua calida: et dimitte sanguinem currere in eam, donec euacuatur.	If the outflow of blood is prevented, then immerse the foot of it in warm water: and let the blood flow into it until it is evacuated.
Quod si errat uenam phlebotomator in prima uice, tunc iteret cum phlebotomia ad superiora parumper, nam locus est saluus, et non times ex eo maliciam, quando tu caues a neruis, sicut diximus.	If the vein cutter errs in the first attempt, then return with phlebotomy to the upper part for a short time, because the place is safe, and do not fear malice from it when you are careful of the nerves, as we said.
Et similiter cum Saphena pedis alterius aequaliter.	And similarly with the saphenous vein of the other foot equally.
Venae autem Sciaticae locus, sicut diximus, est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	The location of the Sciatic veins, as we have said, is at the heel from the inside side.
Et iuuamentum phlebotomiae eius est, ad dolorem anchae, quando est propter sanguinem calidum.	And the benefit of bloodletting is for pain in the hip, when it is because of hot blood.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut ingrediatur infirmus balneum, et festinet: et stringe crus eius a latere anchae usque supra calcaneum quatuor digitis, cum uitta subtili longa: non enim apparet nisi propter illud.	And the quality of phlebotomy is that the sick person should enter the bath and hasten: and he should bind his leg from the side of the hip to above the heel with a thin cord four fingers wide, for it does not appear otherwise.
Quando ergo apparet, tunc phlebotoma eam secundum quodcumque ingenium est tibi possibile, aut secundum transuersionem: et est melius, aut ut incidas eam incisione, aut seces eam sectione.	When therefore it appears, then the phlebotomist shall cut it according to what is possible for you, or according to the direction; and it is better, or that you cut it with an incision, or sever it with a section.
Locus enim eius est saluior, et ipsa est in pluribus hominibus occulta ualde.	For its location is safer, and it is hidden in many people's bodies indeed.
Quod si non inuenis eam, et non apparet sensui omnino: tunc phlebotoma aliquem ramum eius, et est ille qui apparet in dorso pedis, et uersus auricularem: et caue a neruis, et fac currere ex sanguine quantitatem quam uis.	If you do not find it, and it does not appear at all to the sense: then the phlebotomist will take some branch of it, and that which appears on the back of the foot, and towards the ear; and be careful from nerves, and make it run out of blood in the quantity that you wish.
Deinde solue stricturam, et pone super locum phlebotomiae corium, et stringe locum.	Then loosen the constriction, and place over the site of the incision skin, and bind the area.
Uelociter enim sanatur.	It heals quickly indeed.
¶ De Ventosatione, et qualitate usus eius.	On Wind-letting and its quality of use.
Caput XCVIII.	Chapter XCIII.
Uentosae fiunt ex cornibus, et ex aere, et ex uitro.	Instruments are made from horns, and from bronze, and from glass.
Et Ventosatio quidem fit secundum duos modos.	And indeed punction is done according to two modes.
Cum scarificatione, et extractione sanguinis: et alter est uentosatio sine scarificatione.	With scarification, and drawing of blood: and another is venesection without scarification.
Et haec Ventosatio quae est sine scarificatione, est secundum duos modos.	And this kind of suction which is without incision, is according to two modes.
Aut enim est cum igne.	Or it is with fire.
Aut est absque igne.	Or it is without fire.
Et uentosis quae administrantur cum scarificatione et extractione sanguinis sunt quatuordecim loca corporis.	And there are fourteen places in the body which are treated with cupping and incisions and blood letting.
Quorum unus est, Ventosatio Alnocrati, et est postremum capitis: et Alkehel, et est medium colli: et uentosae Alhagdahim, et sunt duae laminae colli a duabus partibus simul: et uentosae menti, et est sub mandibula in inferiori oris: et uentosae duarum spatularum: et uentosae Alachosos super finem caudae: et uentosae duorum focilium, et sunt medium duorum brachiorum: et uentosae duorum crurium: et uentosae duarum cauillarum.	There is one that is named Alnocrati Ventus and it is in the rear of the head: and Alkehel and it is in the middle of the neck: and Alhagdahim Ventose, and these are two laminae of the neck from two parts simultaneously: and Ventose of the mind, and it is under the mandible in the lower mouth: and Ventose of two spatulas: and Ventose Alachosos above the end of the tail: and Ventose of two focilium, and these are the middle of the two arms: and Ventose of two legs: and Ventose of two tails.
Et Ventosatio quidem non extrahit sanguinem tibi ex uenis minutis sparsis in carne, et propter illud non cadit uirtus ex eis, sicut est casus eius ex phlebotomia.	And indeed ventosa does not draw blood from veins dispersed in the flesh, and for that reason virtue does not fall from them, as is the case with phlebotomy.
Neque oportet, ut administretur uentosatio siue cum igne, aut absque igne in aliqua aegritudinum quae fiunt ex repletione, donec euacuetur totum corpus.	It is not necessary to administer cauterization, whether with fire or without fire, in certain illnesses that arise from fullness, until the entire body has been evacuated.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad Ventosationem ex aegritudine, aut propter consuetudinem, administramus eam in omni hora in principio mensis, in fine eius, et in medio ipsius, et in quocumque tempore fuerit.	If necessity compels us to perform venesection because of sickness or habit, we administer it at any hour, at the beginning of the month, at its end, and in the middle, and at any time whatsoever.
Quod est, quia ex hominibus est qui quando multiplicatur in eo sanguis, donec indiget extractione eius per uentosationem, inuenit in capite suo grauedinem, et sodahan.	It is because among men, when blood multiplies in him until it needs to be drawn out through venesection, he finds heaviness in his head and a headache.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit repletionem et rubedinem in facie sua, capite suo, et collo suo.	And of these is he who found suppuration and redness on his face, head, and neck.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit pruritum in facie sua, et fronte sua, et tenebrositatem, et hebetudinem in oculis suis.	And among these is he who finds itching in his face, and forehead, and dimness, and dullness in his eyes.
Et ex eis est qui scalpit locum uentosationis suae.	And there is one who cuts the place of his windpipe.
Et ex eis est cuius risus multiplicatur.	And there is one whose laughter is multiplied.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit gustum sanguinis in ore suo: aut apostematur lingua, et expuit sanguinem.	And of these is one who finds a taste of blood in his mouth; or his tongue becomes ulcerated and he spits out blood.
Et ex eis est cuius somnus multiplicatur.	And there is one whose sleep multiplies.
Et ex eis est qui uidet in somno suo sanguinem et rubedinem, et interfectos, et plagas, et quae sunt similia illis.	And among these are those who see in their sleep blood and redness, and wounds, and things similar to these.
Quando ergo uidemus aliquid ex illis, et proprie si est in tertia media mensis: praecipimus tunc uentosationem fieri, postquam praeterierunt de die duae horae, aut tres.	When therefore we see something from those things, and properly if it is in the third week of the month: we prescribe then that ventilation be done, after two hours or three have passed.
Iuuamentum autem Ventosationis nuchae, est: quoniam ipsa confert ad grauitatem in capite, et quod effunditur ad oculos.	A wound of the neck from a sword thrust is: because it carries to the weight on the head, and what flows forth to the eyes.
At uero oportet, ut sit illud post euacuationem totius corporis.	But it is necessary that after evacuation of the whole body,
Et haec quidem Ventosa est loco phlebotomiae Cephalicae.	And this indeed is a type of  cupping in the place of cephalic bloodletting.
Et non licet, ut utatur ea qui est frigidae complexionis, aut in quo est catarrus.	And it is not permitted to use this on someone who has a cold constitution, or who has a cold.
Nam infert ei nocumentum magnum.	For it does great harm to him.
Et propter illud non oportet, ut utantur ea senes, et in cuius capite sunt aegritudines frigidae.	Therefore, it is not proper for them to use these things, those who are old and have cold pains in their head.
Qui autem super eam fit assiduus, generatur super eum obliuio.	Whoever is diligent over it, forgetfulness is generated over him.
Et propter illud oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut deponat manum suam cum uentosa parumper ad inferiora, timendo ex generatione obliuionis.	And for this reason it is necessary that you instruct the Ventosa to place his hand with the wind-pump briefly lower down, fearing from the production of oblivion.
Ventosatio aut Alkehel, est loco phlebotomiae Fuscae, et phlebotomiae Basilicae, et propter illud confert asmati, et constrictioni anhelitus, et fissurae instrumenti anhelitus, et tussi, et repletioni.	Bloodletting by the Alkehel method, is in the place of phlebotomy at Fuscae and Basilicae, and because of this it induces shortness of breath, constriction of breathing, instrumental breakage, coughing, and repletion.
Et oportet, ut impellatur Ventosa Alkehel parumper, quoniam si ponitur inferius, generat debilitatem in corde, et stomacho.	And it is necessary that a small pump be driven by Alkehel, because if it is placed below, it generates weakness in the heart and stomach.
Ventosatio uero alhagdahim, confert doloribus accidentibus in capite, et obtalmiae, et hemigraneae, et perforationi, et dolori in radicibus dentium: et est loco phlebotomiae Basilicae.	Bloodletting for the head calms pains that occur suddenly in the head, and also headaches, migraines, toothaches, and pain at the roots of the teeth; it is a place for bloodletting according to Basil.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne premat manum suam cum scarificatione: ut non incidat arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And it is necessary that you instruct the Operator not to press his hand with the scraping, so that he does not cut an artery and a flow of blood occurs.
Ventosatio autem sub mento, confert alcolae in ore, et corruptioni gingiuae, et similibus eis ex aegritudinibus quae sunt in ore: et stat loco phlebotomiae alieherich, quae sunt in duobus labiis.	Bloodletting under the chin is used for inflammation of the gums and similar ailments in the mouth; it takes the place of other phlebotomies which are in both lips.
Ventosatio autem spatularum, confert ad alchafacham, quae fit ex replexione, et caliditate.	The blowing of the spatula is referred to as alchafacha, which is done from reflection and heat.
Ventosatio uero interiorum partium duorum focilium, confert iuuamentum phlebotomiae uenarum trium, Basilicae, et Fuscae, et Cephalicae: quoniam ipsa attrahit sanguinem ex omnibus illis uenis minutis, quae sunt in carne: et attrahunt illae uenae minutae ex uenis aliis grossioribus eis, donec peruenit attractio ad uenas tres.	The evacuation of the interior parts by two incisions helps the phlebotomy of the three veins, Basilica, and Fusca, and Cephalic; because it draws blood from all those small veins that are in the flesh: and those small veins draw from other larger veins until the attraction reaches the three veins.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne multum procedat in scarificatione: quoniam locus est denudatus carne, et sub eo sunt nerui et arteriae.	And it is necessary that you instruct the Ventosator not to proceed too far in the cutting; because the place is stripped of flesh, and beneath it are nerves and arteries.
Ventosa autem quae uentosatur super alchausos, confert hemorroidibus Ani, et ulceribus inferioribus.	The suction cup, when applied to a wound, is useful for hemorrhoids and ulcers of the lower parts of the body.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut sit uentosa magna, et ut sit ex aere: quoniam locus indiget suctione forti, et fortasse franguntur Ventosae subtiles: et scarificetur scarificatione magna.	And it is necessary that you instruct the Ventusator to be large and of brass; because a place needs strong suction, and possibly fine Ventusators break. And let it be scraped with a deep scraping.
Ventosae autem crurium minuunt diminutione manifesta: quoniam attrahunt sanguinem ex toto corpore, et conferunt doloribus antiquis in renibus, et matricibus, et uesica: prouocant menstrua, et conferunt bothor, et ademenul: et stant loco phlebotomiae duarum saphenarum, et alhorcobeni.	Leeches on the legs diminish by manifest decrease; for they draw blood from the whole body, and bring together old pains in the kidneys, and wombs, and bladder: they cause menstruation, and bring together boils, and shortness of breath: and they stand in place of two saphenous vein openings, and other.
Verumtamen debilitant corpus multum, et faciunt accidere syncopim in pluribus hominibus.	Nevertheless they weaken the body a great deal, and cause syncope to happen in many people.
Et Ventosarum alhorcobeni iuuamentum est propinquum iuuamento Ventosarum duorum crurium.	And the treatment of winds [of the abdomen] is similar to the treatment of winds [of the two legs].
Qualitas positionis Ventosarum est, ut ponas uentosam in primis uacuam, et sugas suctione temperata: et non prolonges positionem uentosarum, sed pone eas uelociter, et remoue eas uelociter, ut ueniant humores ad locum aduentu aequali: et non cesses iterare illud et continuare, donec uideas locum iam rubere et inflari, et appareat rubedo sanguinis: tunc ergo scarifica, et itera suctione paulatim.	The quality of the position of the instruments is that you place the instrument first empty and draw by a temperate suction. And do not prolong the position of the instruments, but put them quickly and remove them quickly so that humors come to the place with an equal arrival.  And do not cease to repeat this and continue until you see the place already red and swollen, and it appears redness of blood; then therefore scarify, and repeat the suction gradually.
Deinde considera in dispositione corporum.	Then consider the arrangement of the bodies.
Nam qui ex hominibus est tenerae carnis, rarorum pororum, oportet ut scarifices ipsum semel, non plus: ut non ulceretur locus.	For one who is of tender flesh and few pores, it is necessary that he be scarified once, no more, so that the place may not ulcerate.
Et praecipe Ventosatori, ut amplificet scarificationem, et profundet parum: et temperet suctionem in facilitate, et uelocitate, et motu suaui.	And instruct the Ventor (suction pump), so that it may enlarge the scarification and make it slightly deep; and moderate suction in ease, and speed, and its own movement.
Quod si in sanguine est grossitudo, tunc oportet, ut scarifices ipsum bis.	If there is a thickening in the blood, then it is necessary to scarify it twice.
In uice quidem prima aperitur uia subtiliationi sanguinis, et aquositati eius: et in secunda quidem perscrutationi exquisitae extractionis sanguinis grossi.	In the first incision there is opened a way for the thinning and liquefaction of blood; and in the second, a thorough examination of the extraction of thick blood.
Si uero sanguis est faeculentus ualde, tunc fiat scarificatio uice tertia: ut consequatur ultimum.	If the blood is foul indeed, then let a third incision be made so that it may come to an end.
Et ad ultimum, quando uolumus extrahere sanguinem paulatim, uel parumper, sufficit nobis scarificatio una.	And lastly, when we wish to draw blood gradually, or a little at a time, one incision suffices us.
Quod si uolumus extractionem sanguinis multi, scarificamus scarificatione plurima.	If we want many blood extractions, we make many incisions.
Et si nos mensuramus, quod sanguis est grossus: tunc oportet, ut scarificetur scarificatione profunda: et terminus aequalis in scarificatione, est profunditas cutis.	And if we measure that the blood is thick, then it is necessary that it be scarified with a deep scarification, and an equal limit in the scarification is the depth of the skin.
¶ Quid sit illud quod oportet administrari ex oleis apud positionem Ventosarum, et quid caueat uentosandus.	What ought to be administered from oils at the positioning of the winds, and what should a wind be cautious of.
IN illo quidem cuius cutis est grossa, dura, fusca, et pori eius sunt stricti, oportet ut ungantur loca Ventosare cum oleis apertiuis, lenitiuis, resolutiuis: si est in tempore aestatis, sicut est oleum alkeiri, aut oleum uiolatum, aut oleum de amigdalis dulcibus, aut oleum de semine cucurbitae.	In that case, whose skin is thick, hard, dark, and whose pores are narrow, it is necessary to anoint the places of Ventosoar with oils that are opening, soothing, and dissolving: if it is in summer time, such as alkeiri oil, or violet oil, or almond oil, or oil from pumpkin seed.
Et si est in tempore hyemis, tunc oleum narcissinum, aut oleum de lilio, aut oleum camomellinum, aut sarbatinum: et eis similia.	And if it is in wintertime, then narcissus oil, or lily oil, or chamomile oil, or syrup: and the like.
Si uero superfluitas est grossa, frigida: tunc oleum sit amaracinum, aut oleum de balsamita aut oleum alben, aut oleum anetinum: et eis similia.	If however the superfluity is thick and cold, then let the oil be of bitter almond, or balm oil, or alb oil, or anise oil: and the like.
Si uero uentosandus est amplorum pororum, tenerae carnis: tunc oportet, ut prohibeatur ab oleo, et oportet ut isti abluant loca Ventosarum earum post uentosationem cum aqua rosata, aut cum aqua frigida, aut cum aqua solatri, aut cum aqua cucurbitae, aut cum aqua portulacae: et similibus eis.	If a large wound is to be cleaned, of tender flesh: then it ought to be prevented from oil, and it ought to be washed by those places of the winds after the cleansing with rosewater, or with cold water, or with solar water, or with gourd water, or with purslane water: and similar ones.
Ille autem cuius sanguis est multae humiditatis, abluat uentosas cum aceto, aut cum aqua myrti, et sumach: et similibus eis.	He who has much moisture in his blood shall wash with vinegar, or myrtle water, and sumac, and the like.
Cuius autem superfluitates sunt grossae, abluat uentosas suas cum uino antiquo, aut cum aqua samsuci, aut decoctione aneti, aut camomillae: et eis similibus.	If, however, the superfluities are coarse, he shall wash his wounds with old wine, or with fig water, or with an extract of dill, or chamomile: and with things similar to these.
Et oportet, ut caueatur uentosatio in balneo, aut in uestigio balnei, imo oportet, ut administretur post exitum ex balneo per horam, aut per horas duas.	And it is necessary that a bath be avoided, or the trace of a bath, indeed it is necessary that it be administered after leaving the bath for one hour, or for two hours.
Et non oportet, ut dormiat aliquis post uentosationem.	And it is not necessary for someone to sleep after venesection.
¶ Quid est quo oportet ut regatur Ventosandus, aut Phlebotomatus ante uentosationem.	What is required to be regulated before venesection, either a bloodletting?
ET post eam oportet, ut consideres in primis: tunc si Ventosatus, aut Phlebotomatus sit cholericus, et uincunt super sanguinem eius acuitas et inflammatio: tunc oportet, ut accipiat infrigidantia, sicut granatum muzum: et etiam endiuiam cum aceto et lactuca, et secaniabin, et iuleb: et eis similia.	And after that, you ought to consider first: then if it is  sanguineous and feverish, or if the wound is being cut (opened) by bile, and its sharpness and inflammation overpower his blood: then he ought to receive refrigerants such as pomegranate juice; and also endive with vinegar and lettuce, and secaliabinum, and iuleb; and things similar to these.
Et pone cibaria eius pullos, et carnes ouium sekebiget, et cibos conditos cum agresta: et eis similia.	And place his food chicks and the flesh of sheep he will relish, and foods cooked with herbs: and similar things.
Et cuius complexio est frigida, oportet ut sumat in potu syrupum de melle, aut de almiua, aut alsecaniabin de seminibus factum: et sumat uinum odoriferum medium, quod est inter uetus et nouum: et praecipiatur, ut utatur paucitate cibi.	And if its condition is cold, it ought to take in drink a syrup of honey, or of almiua, or alsecaniabin made from seeds: and let it take medium-scented wine, which is between old and new: and let it be prescribed that it use little food.
Et pone cibum eius pullos, et canebir: et passeres, id est, paruas aues: et pullos columborum issiadebet.	And put food for him of chicks, and sparrows, that is, small birds, and young doves he should give.
Et oportet, ut potus die uentosationis et phlebotomiae plus sit quam cibus: et oportet, ut detur in potu in quibusdam hominibus in horis tyriaca alfaroch, aut medicamen de musco, id est, muscata, aut alesselithe ante uentosationem: et ante phlebotomiam, aut post: ut confortentur membra principalia, et subtilietur sanguis.	And it is necessary that the drink on the day of bleeding and incision be greater than food; and it is necessary that in some men there be given in the drink at times tyriaca alfaroch, or medicine of musk, that is, muscata, or alesselithe before bleeding; and before phlebotomy, or after: so that the principal limbs may be comforted, and the blood may be refined.
Et non oportet, ut sumant eam in potu calefacto.	And it is not proper that they should take it in heated drink.
¶ De Ventosis sine scarificatione.	On Varices without Incision
Uentosae autem quae sunt sine scarificatione, sunt Ventosae quae ponuntur super epar, et splenem, et podagram, et super uentrem, umbilicum, et loca renum, et pixidem anchae: quoniam ista membra non sufferunt scarificationem super se.	Those which are without incisions, however, are those placed upon the liver, spleen, foot, and over the stomach, navel, and places of the kidneys, and anus; because these members do not endure incisions upon them.
Et non quaeritur per eas, nisi aut attactio ex membro sanguinis ad membrum: sicut ponimus Ventosam super mammillas in aegritudine fluxus sanguinis narium.	And these are not sought except for either attachment from a limb of blood to a limb; such as we place the leech on the nipples in the suffering of the flow of blood of the nose.
Et utimur eis, ut soluamus a membro uentositatem frigidam inuiscatam in membro: sicut ponimus uentosam super uentrem, et umbilicum.	And we use them to release cold airiness from the limb that is unseen; such as when we place it upon the stomach and the navel.
Ipsa enim rarificat membrum, et calefacit ipsum, et remouet dolorem propterea, quia resoluit illam uentositatem.	For it indeed thins the limb, and heats it, and removes pain because it dissolves that windiness.
Etiam ponitur super renes, quando accidit in eis opilatio, aut lapis.	It is also placed upon the kidneys when a calculus or stone occurs within them.
Uirtute enim attractionis suae fortasse aperit opilationem, aut eradicat lapidem ex loco suo.	For perhaps, by the virtue of its traction, it opens an abscess, or removes a stone from its place.
Et similiter facit quando ponitur super epar, et splenem apud uentositatem terendam in eis utrisque.	And similarly he does when it is placed upon the hypochondria, and the spleen among the others should be washed in both of these.
Et istae Ventosae administrantur uacuae cum sectione tantum.	And these ventosa are administered with incisions only.
Et quandoque administrantur cum igne.	And sometimes they are administered with fire.
Et quandoque administrantur plenae aqua tepida in aegritudinibus pleuresis: et illud est, ut impleatur Ventosa, et sit magna, aqua calida sola, aut aqua in qua decoctae sint herbae quae conueniunt.	And sometimes they are administered full with warm water in ailments of pleurisy: and that is, so that it be filled with a cupping glass, and be large, hot water alone, or water in which have been boiled herbs that are suitable.
¶ Forma Ventosae administratae cum igne.	The shape of a cupping glass administered with fire.
Sit amplitudo orificii eius duorum digitorum apertorum, secundum quod formauimus: et quantitas eius in profundo sit medietas palmi: et sit in latere eius in loco qui est circiter medium eius, foramen paruum, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum acus: fiat ex aere simul, aut citrino, grossorum marginum, lenium, aequalium, tersorum: ut non laedat membrum apud positionem suam super ipsum: et sit in medio eius uirga transuersa ex aere, aut ferro, ubi ponitur candela cum igne.	Let the width of its opening be two finger-widths, according to what we have formed: and let its quantity in depth be half a palm: and let there be a small hole on its side, in the place which is about the middle of it, according to the quantity that a needle can enter into it: let it be made of copper or yellow metal, with broad, smooth, equal edges, so that it does not injure the limb upon its placement upon it: and let there be a transverse rod in its middle, of copper or iron, where a candle is placed with fire.
Et iam fit haec uentosa magna, maior ea quam narrauimus, et parum minor illa, secundum aegritudines et aetatem eius qui utitur.	And now this large one is made, larger than we have narrated, and somewhat smaller than that, according to the pains and age of him who uses it.
Ventosae enim puerorum, et extenuatorum sunt aliae, quam uentosae uirorum, et grossorum corporum.	For boys and thin people are different types of lancets than for men and stout-bodied individuals.
Qualitas autem ponendi hanc uentosam cum igne super membrum, est, ut accendas licinium cum igne ex lino decenter, aut candelam paruam ex caera: et pone eam super medium uirgae transuersae quae est in medio uentosae: ut sit accensus ignis circiter inferiorem partem uentosae, ut non comburatur corpus infirmi.	The quality of placing this winnowing with fire on the limb is, that you set alight a wick with fire from linen properly, or a small candle from wax: and place it over the middle of the transverse beam which is in the middle of the winnowing: so that the fire may be kindled around the lower part of the winnowing, so that the body of the sick person is not burned.
Deinde ponatur super membrum: et digitus sit super foramen quod dixi, donec quando tenemus uentosam: dum indigemus, auferamus digitum, et egredietur uapor super illud foramen, et soluetur uentosa statim.	Then a finger is placed over the limb and over the hole that I have mentioned, until when we hold it with wind; while we need it, we remove the finger, and vapor will exit through that hole, and the wind will be immediately released.
Deinde igni licinium secundum modum suum, et itera eam, si indiges illa.	Then apply heat with a burning stick according to its measure, and repeat it if you need it.
In Ventosa autem quae administratur in aegritudine pleuresis cum aqua, non est uirga transuersa, neque foramen: et non administratur, nisi quia impletur aqua, et ponitur super membrum tantum.	In the case of suction which is administered in a sickness of pleurisy with water, there is no transverse rod, nor hole; and it is not administered unless it is filled with water, and placed upon the limb only.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et haec Ventosa quanto plus est magna, ut capiat aquam multam, est melior.	And this suction cup, the larger it is so that it can take much water, is better.
¶ De suspensione Sanguisugarum.	On the Suspension of Bloodsuckers.
Caput XCIX.	Chapter XCIX.
Sanguisugae non administrantur in pluribus, nisi in quibus membris non est possibilis positio uentosarum, propter paruitatem eorum, sicut labium, et gingiua, et eis similia.	Leech therapy is not administered in many cases, except where the positioning of leeches is not possible due to their small size, such as on the lip and gums and similar parts.
Aut in membro denudato a carne, sicut digitus, et nasus, et eis similia.	Or in the exposed member, such as the finger, and nose, and things similar.
Et qualitas utendi eis est: ut ueneris ex Sanguisugis quae sunt in aquis dulcibus, mundis a putredinibus.	And the quality of using them is: that you take them from leeches which are in sweet waters, clean from rot.
Deinde dimittantur die et nocte in aqua dulci, donec famelicae sint, et non remaneat in uentre earum aliquid.	Then they are put in fresh water day and night until they are famished, and there is nothing left in their belly.
Deinde euacuetur corpus in primis cum phlebotomia, et cum uentosis.	Then the body shall be evacuated first with phlebotomy and with ventoses.
Deinde absterge membrum infirmi, donec rubeat.	Then wipe the limb of the infirm, until it is red.
Postea ponantur super ipsum.	Afterwards they shall be placed upon it.
Cum ergo implentur, et cadunt, et est possibilis suctio loci cum uentosa, tunc est magis ultimum in iuuamento: et si non, tunc ablue locum cum aceto.	When they are therefore filled and fall and there is possible suction of the place with a windy one, then it is more ultimate in aid: and if not, then wash the place with vinegar.
Deinde cum aqua multa, et fricetur, et exprimatur.	Then with much water, it is rubbed and squeezed.
Quod si prolongatur cursus sanguinis post casum Sanguisugarum, et est illud resudando: tunc infunde pannum lini in aqua frigida, et pone ipsum desuper, donec abscindatur resudatio.	If the flow of blood continues after the application of  blood-sucking leeches and it is still oozing, then place a linen cloth soaked in cold water on top of it until the bleeding stops.
Quod si multiplicatur sanguis, tunc pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, aut gallas, et similia eis ex stipticis: donec abscindatur sanguis.	If blood multiplies, then pulverize upon it pounded zegi or gallic acid, and things similar to these from styptics, until the blood is stopped.
Aut ponantur super locum medietates fabarum excorticatarum: et dimittantur, donec adhaereant fabae in loco, nam sanguis abscinditur.	Or let pads of scraped beans be placed upon the area and left there until the beans adhere to the place, because blood is stopped.
Et oportet si necessaria est iteratio Sanguisugarum, quando est possibile, mutare eas.	And it is necessary if repetition of bloodletting is required, when possible, to change them.
Si autem prohibentur Sanguisugae a suspensione, tunc abstergatur locus cum sanguine recenti.	If leeches are forbidden from being suspended, then the place should be wiped with fresh blood.
Aut fige acum in locis, donec egrediatur aliquid ex sanguine.	Or fix a point in the places until something comes out of blood.
Deinde ponantur, nam ipsae quando sentiunt aliquid ex sanguine, adhaerent statim.	Then they are placed, for when they feel something from blood, they immediately adhere.
Quando ergo uis ut cadant, pulueriza super eas aliquid ex aloe trito, aut salem, aut cinerem: et cadent statim.	When therefore you wish them to fall, pulverize upon them something from pounded aloe, or salt, or ashes: and they will fall immediately.

¶ Sermo uniuersalis de restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus.	A universal discourse on restoration, and dislocation, and cure of torsion, and similar things.
Caput I.	Book I.
Hoc Capitulum etiam multotiens est necessarium in arte Medicinae, et est restauratio fracturae, et dislocationis accidentium in ossibus.	This chapter is also very necessary in the art of medicine, and it is the restoration of a fracture and a dislocation of accidents in the bones.
Scitote o Filii, quia iactant se de hoc Capitulo stolidi medicorum et uulgi, et qui non inspexerunt unquam antiquorum librum, neque legerunt ex eo literam.	Know, O Sons, that those who are foolish among the doctors and the common people boast about this Chapter, and those who have never looked upon an ancient book nor read a letter from it.
Et propter hanc caussam fit, quod iste modus ex scientiis in terra nostra est priuatus.	And because of this reason, this mode is deprived of sciences in our land.
Et ego non obuiaui in eo unquam bono omnino, et non adeptus sum ex eo illud, quod sum adeptus nisi propter longitudinem lectionis librorum antiquorum, et studium super intellectum eorum, donec extraxi scientiam illius ex eis.	And I have never found anything good in it at all, and I have not attained from it what I have attained except because of the length of reading the books of antiquity, and study over their understanding until I extracted the knowledge of it from them.
Deinde adhaesi experimento et studio longitudine uitae meae.	Then by experience and study throughout the length of my life.
Et iam descripsi uobis ex illo in hoc Capitulo totum quod continet scientia mea: et super quod praeteriit experimentum meum, postquam abbreuiaui illud uobis, et liberaui illud ex occupatione elongationis, et abbreuiaui illud fine abbreuiationis, et ostendi illud fine declinationis: et formaui in eo formas multas ex formis instrumentorum quae administrantur in eo, cum sit ex additione declinationis, sicut feci in duobus Capitulis praecedentibus.	And now I have described to you in this Chapter all that contains my knowledge: and above what has passed my experiment, after I have abbreviated it for you, and released it from the occupation of elongation, and I have abbreviated it at the end of abbreviation, and I have shown it at the end of declination: and I have formed in it many forms from the forms of instruments which are administered in it, as it is by addition of declination, as I did in the two preceding Chapters.
¶ Summae, et collectiones ex esse fracturae ossium, ex eis quarum praemissio necessaria est, antequam incipiamus rememorationem membrorum fractorum, et diuersorum, si uniuscuiusque.	Summaries and collections are from the being of fractures of bones, from those whose preliminary is necessary, before we begin the remembrance of broken members, and diverse, of each one.
Caput II.	Chapter II.
Oportet, ut dicamus in prologo huius Capituli, summas sermonis, et capitula, ad quarum intellectum cogitur in primis artifex ad stationem super earum ueritatem: scilicet ut uos, et qui sunt prompti, sciant, uel addiscant hanc artem nobilem, et alii a uobis.	It is necessary, as we say in the prologue to this Chapter, that the highest matters and chapters, to the understanding of which the artificer is first compelled to station himself over their truth: namely, that you, and those who are ready, may know, or learn this noble art, and others from you.
Dico, ergo, quod quando accidit alicui fractura, aut dislocatio, aut torsio, aut casus: tunc oportet, ut properes in primis ad phlebotomandum eum, et soluendum ipsum, aut utraque simul: si non prohibeat aliquid, sicut debilitas uirtutis: aut est ille cui accidit aliquid ex illis puer, aut senex decrepitus: aut est tempus uehementis caloris, aut uehementis frigoris ualde.	I say therefore that when a fracture or dislocation or torsion or fall happens to someone, then it is necessary to hasten first of all to bleed him and to loosen him, or both at the same time: if something does not prevent it, such as weakness of strength: or he is one to whom something of these things has happened out of those children, or a decrepit old man: or the time is one of violent heat, or violent cold.
Deinde sit contentus in cibo suo, oleribus frigidis, et carnibus auium, et haedorum: et prohibe uinum, et carnes grossas, et repleri ex cibis et omni cibo qui replet uenas sanguine.	Then let him be content with his food, with cold herbs and the flesh of birds and hares: and forbid wine and coarse meats, and filling oneself with foods and all food that fills the veins with blood.
Donec quando securus sis ex apostemate calido, et non times effusionem materiei ad membrum: tunc redeat infirmus ad regimen suum primum cum quo cucurrit consuetudo eius.	Until you are secure from the hot abscess, and do not fear the discharge of material to the limb: then let the sick man return to his first way of life with which he is accustomed.
Cum ergo incipit os fractum restaurari, tunc oportet, ut cibetur infirmus cibis nutrientibus nutrimento multo, grosso, graui, in quibus sit uiscositas: sicut cibaria facta ex tritico cocto cum aqua, et rizum, et capita, et pedes, et uentres uaccarum, et oua, et pisces recentes: et uinum grossum, et similia illis.	When therefore a broken bone begins to be restored, then it is necessary that the sick person should be fed with nourishing foods, much, thick, heavy, in which there is viscosity: such as food made from cooked wheat with water, and rye, and heads, and feet, and bellies of oxen, and eggs, and fresh fish: and thick wine, and similar things.
Cum hoc enim regimine fit coagulatio fracturae uelocius, et melius.	With this regimen, coagulation of a fracture occurs faster and better.
Et scias, quod ossa fracta, quando sunt in uiris qui sunt in prima senectute, et decrepitis, non est possibile, ut continuentur et consolidentur secundum naturam suam semper, propter exiccationem membrorum eorum: et consolidantur et continuantur quae ex eis sunt in fine lenitatis, sicut ossa puerornm paruorum.	And know that broken bones, when they are in men who are in their first old age and decrepit, it is not possible, that they may be continued and consolidated according to their own nature always, because of the drying up of their limbs: and they consolidate and continue which are from them in the end of softness, like the bones of little children.
Verumtamen natura annectit super os fractum ex omni parte aliquid simile glutino, in quo est grossitudo, quo adhaeret et stringit ipsum, donec conglutinantur adinuicem, et ligantur adinuicem, donec uenit in fine fortitudinis et firmitudinis, sicut fuit in primis, donec non prohibet ipsum aliquid ab operationibus suis: et propter hanc caussam est necesse, ut ponas nutrimentum infirmi cibaria, in quibus sunt grauitas, et uiscositas, et grossitudo, sicut diximus.	Nevertheless, nature joins together something like glue over a broken bone from every part, which has thickness, to which it adheres and binds it until it is glued together and bound together, until it comes to the end of strength and firmness, just as it was at first, until nothing prevents it from performing its functions: and for this reason it is necessary that you put nourishment for the sick food in which there are heaviness, viscosity, and thickness, as we said.
Et scias, quod fracturae species sunt diuersae, secundum diuersitatem membrorum: quoniam fractura cruris, est diuersa a fractura ossis capitis: et fractura ossis pectoris, est diuersa a fractura ossis dorsi: et similiter reliqua membra omnia diuersa existunt adinuicem: et ego ueni cum rememoratione omnis speciei fracturae expositae in Capitulo suo distinctae ab alia.	And know that the kinds of fractures are diverse, according to the diversity of limbs: because a fracture of the thigh is different from a fracture of the bone of the head: and a fracture of the bone of the chest is different from a fracture of the bone of the back: and similarly all the rest of the members exist diversely one from another: and I have come with remembrance of every kind of fracture exposed in his Chapter distinguished from another.
Et diuersificantur species fracturae ossis etiam in seipsa.	And the kinds of bone fracture are also diversified within themselves.
Quoniam fit fractura eius arcuata, praeter quod accidant in ea astellae.	Because it is fractured in an arched shape, besides that stars occur in it.
Et quandoque fit fractura eius secundum longitudinem ossis: et sunt fracturae eius satagiae, id est, astellae, et additiones procedentes, sicut sunt in calamo, cum aptatur cultello ad scribendum.	And sometimes a fracture of it is made according to the length of the bone: and there are fractures of it star-shaped, that is, with stars, and additions proceeding, as are in a pen, when it is fitted with a knife for writing.
Et non procedentes: et est fractura cum uulnere et disruptione in capite: et est fractura fissura parua.	And not proceeding: and it is a fracture with a wound and disruption in the head: and it is a small fissure fracture.
Et omni speciei est ingenium, uel instrumentum proprium in restauratione eius, secundum quod ueniet rememoratio eius, distincta in locis suis.	And every kind has a disposition or instrument proper to its restoration, according to what will come about its remembrance, distinct in its places.
Et ex eo quo cognoscitur fractura ossis, est tortuositas eius, et ipsius eminentia: et apparitio eius sensui, et sonitus eius quando comprimis ipsum manu tua.	And from that which is known as a fracture of bone, is its crookedness, and its prominence; and its appearance to the sense, and its sound when you compress it with your hand.
Quando ergo non est in loco tortuositas apparens, neque sonitus apud tactum tuum cum tangis os cum agitatione, neque inuenit infirmus magnum dolorem: tunc non est illic fractura, imo possibile est, ut sit tortuositas, aut fissura parua: non ergo oportet, ut moueas ipsum cum manu et compressione omnino, imo pone super ipsum ex medicinis, quarum uenit rememoratio, post momentum illud quod conuenit loco: deinde stringatur strictura subtili.	When therefore there is no apparent twisting in the place, nor a sound at your touch when you touch the bone with agitation, nor does the sick person find great pain: then there is no fracture there, indeed it is possible that there is twisting, or a small fissure: therefore you ought not to move it with your hand and compression at all, rather put upon it from medicines, of which the remembrance comes, after the time which is convenient in place: then the bandage shall be tightened subtly.
Et scias, quod locus quando arcuatur, et scinditur in duo, praeter quod accidant in eo satagiae, uerumtamen remouetur omnis pars a compari sua: tunc oportet tibi, ut incipias ab hora tua ad rectificationem eius, aequando ipsum antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And know that when the place is bent and split into two, besides which boils may occur there, nevertheless all part is removed from its pair: then it is necessary for you to begin at your hour for its rectification, leveling it before a hot abscess occurs in it.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum, tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec quiescat apoestema.	If however it happens to him that a hot abscess occurs, then let it be left alone for several days until the abscess rests.
Deinde aequa ipsum secundum quemcunque modum potest ex lenitate et ingenio.	Then equal it according to whatever way can be by gentleness and skill.
Et scias, quod restauratio eius, et ipsius aequatio, est facilior quam ossis, in quo accidunt satagiae.	And know that its restoration and its equalization is easier than bone, in which happen wounds.
Deinde stringe ipsum, secundum quod ueniet tibi rememoratio eius.	Then bind it as much as you remember.
Si uero in osse sunt satagiae, tunc necessaria est extensio huius membri fracti ex duabus partibus, si manus sit, aut pes: aut cum manu tua, si membrum est paruum: aut cum duobus funibus, aut cum fune et manu.	If there are splinters in the bone, then it is necessary to extend this broken limb from two parts, if it is a hand or foot: or with your own hand, if the limb is small: or with two ropes, or with a rope and hand.
Et sit positio tua qua ponis membrum super locum aequalem, secundum figuram suam naturalem, donec quando extenduntur partes membri fracti: tunc conare, ut redire facias illas additiones omni ingenio, et secundum quemcunque modum potes in locis suis: et caue secundum fortitudinem tuam, ne accidat super infirmum per operationem tuam dolor, neque laesio: et conare secundum fortitudinem tuam, ut applices unum duorum ossium cum socio suo, secundum meliores formas.	And let your position be such that you place the limb upon a level place, according to its natural form, until when the parts of the broken limb are extended: then try, as best you can, to return those additions to their places: and beware, according to your strength, that there does not happen pain or injury to the weak by your operation: and try, according to your strength, to apply one of the two bones with its fellow, according to better forms.
Et oportet in illa hora, ut tentes et tangas ipsum manu tua.	And it is necessary at that hour, that you test and touch him with your hand.
Si ergo uides illic aliquid diuersum, rectifica ipsum, et aequa illud per quantitatem tuae uirtutis.	If therefore you see something different there, rectify it, and make it equal by the quantity of your virtue.
Et caue extensionem uehementem, et compressionem fortem, sicut faciunt multi stolidorum.	And avoid violent extension and strong compression, as many fools do.
Multotiens enim faciunt accidere per operationem illam suam apostema calidum, aut contractionem in membro: sicut iam uidimus illud ex operationibus eorum multotiens.	Often indeed they cause a hot abscess or a contraction in the limb to happen through that operation of theirs, as we have already seen from their operations many times.
Deinde annecte post aequationem, et decentem operationem, et stricturam illius membri, et quietem, et tranquillitatem: et mone infirmum super ipsum.	Then bind after the setting, and a decent operation, and stricture of that limb, and rest, and tranquility: and warn the sick person about it.
Et fac ipsum cauere, ne moueat ipsum in hora suarum uigiliarum, et somni sui apud reuolutionem suam, et agitationem suam, et apud egestionem suam, et omnes motus suos ultima uirtute sua.	And make him guard himself so that he does not move himself at the hour of his vigils, and sleep of his turning, and agitation, and evacuation, and all his movements with his last strength.
Et ut caueat, ne sit positio membri positio cum qua sequatur dolor.	And so that he may avoid a position of the member which is followed by pain.
Quod est, quia quando sentit in dispositione positionis membri dolorem, aut laesionem: tunc oportet, ut permutes ipsum ad dispositionem aliam ab illa cum qua non sentiat dolorem.	That is, because when he feels pain or injury in the position of a limb, then it is necessary that he changes it to another position from the one in which he does not feel pain.
Et caue cum illo, ut sit positio eius illa aequalis, recta: ut non accidat in membro tortuositas, quando restauratur.	And be careful with it, so that its position is equal, straight: so that there does not happen twisting in the limb when it is restored.
Et qualitas stricturae membri fracti est, secundum quod narro.	And the quality of the constriction of the broken limb is, according to what I say.
Scias, quod membra fracta diuersificantur in paruitate sua, et eorum magnitudine, et ipsorum forma.	Know that broken limbs differ in their smallness and their size and their form.
Quae ergo ex eis sunt parua, sicut brachium, et digitus, et focile, et similia eis, tunc oportet, ut sit inuolutio panni mollis, subtilis.	Therefore, if these are small things, such as an arm, and a finger, and a foot, and the like, then it ought to be a soft, fine cloth wrapping.
Quae autem ex eis sunt grossa, sicut coxa, et crus, oportet ut sit in eis inuolutio lata, dura.	Those which are gross among them, such as the hip and leg, it is necessary that there be a broad, hard wrapping on them.
Quoniam ligamentum latum, connectit membrum magnum, et stringit ipsum ab omni parte strictura aequali, ita quod non ingreditur ipsum macula.	Because the broad ligament connects the large limb and binds it from every part with an equal constriction, so that it does not enter the mark.
Deinde incipe post euacuationem tuam ab aequatione ponere linimentum conueniens ad illud, in stuppa leni super locum fracturae ipsius.	Then after evacuation, begin to apply a suitable ointment on top of it, in a soft sponge over the site of the fracture itself.
Deinde incipe inuoluere ligamentum super locum fracturae ipsius tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod meretur membrum: et stringe manum tuam parumper cum ligamento.	Then begin to wrap the bandage over the place of the fracture with three or four turns, according to what the limb deserves: and tighten your hand a little with the bandage.
Deinde uade cum eo ad partem superiorem a loco fracturae, et stringe minus quam fuit strictura tua, qua strinxisti locum fractum.	Then go with him to the upper part from the place of the fracture, and tighten less than the tightness that you tightened the fractured place.
Deinde elonga te cum inuolutione a loco fracturae parumper, et mollifica stricturam paulatim, donec capias ex loco sano rem magnam.	Then extend yourself with the rolling from the place of the fracture for a short time, and soften the constriction gradually, until you grasp a large piece from the healthy place.
Deinde accipe uittam aliam, et inuolue eam iterum super locum fractum inuolutionibus.	Then take another strip of linen and wrap it again over the broken place with bandages.
Postea uade cum inuolutione ad partem inferiorem a fractura.	Then go with the wrapping towards the lower part from the fracture.
Et sit operatio tua in strictura inuolutionis, et mollificatione eius, secundum quod diximus in inuolutione prima superiore.	And let your operation be in stricture of the involution, and its softening, according to what we said in the first preceding involution.
Deinde pone inter inuolutiones ex stuppa leni, aut panno, cum quo aequetur tortuositas fracturae, si est in ea tortuositas: et si non, non ponas in ea aliquid.	Then put between the folds a soft lint or cloth, with which the twisting of the fracture is equalized, if it has a twist: and if not, do not put anything in it.
Deinde inuolue super ipsam uittam aliam.	Then cover over it with another bandage.
Postea aequa super has inuolutiones astellas decenter factas statim, si non est in loco inflatio, neque apostema calidum.	Afterward, having made these equal and careful sutures, if there is no swelling in the place, nor a hot abscess.
Si autem in ea est inflatio, aut apostema: tunc pone super eam quod sedet illud apostema, et auferat inflationem: et dimitte eam aliquot diebus.	If there is swelling or an abscess in it, then place on top of it that which sits above the abscess and removes the swelling. And let it be for several days.
Deinde stringe super ipsam tunc astellas.	Then tighten over the very star itself.
Et sint Astellae ex medietatibus cannae latae, rasae, formatae sapienter: aut sint ex ligno unde fiunt cribra, quae fiunt ex pino, aut geraid, id est, ramis palmae, aut calingi: et sit amplitudo omnis Astellae, secundum hanc formam, et hanc eandem figuram.	And let the probes be from the middle of a wide reed, scraped and skillfully formed; or let them be from wood out of which sieves are made, which are made from pine, or geraid, that is, branches of palm, or calingi: and let the width of every probe be, according to this form, and this same figure.
Verumtamen oportet, ut Astella quae ponitur super ipsam tracturam, sit grossior et latior parumper, quam reliquae Astellae: et longitudo Astellae sit secundum quod licet membro ex magnitudine et paruitate.	However, the asterisk that is placed over the very lesion itself ought to be somewhat thicker and wider than the remaining asterisks, and the length of the asterisk should be according to what is fitting for the member based on its size and smallness.
Deinde stringe super Astellas cum uitta alia, secundum stricturam primam eandem.	Then bind over the Astella with another bandage, according to the first tightness.
Deinde liga desuper cum filis decenter, secundum quod diximus de strictura: et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae plus: et quanto plus elongatur a fractura sit, strictura minor.	Then bind above with threads properly, according to what we said about constriction: and let it be that your constriction be above the place of the fracture more; and the more it is elongated from the fracture, the less constriction.
Et oportet, ut sint fila media in grossitudine et subtilitate, et sint ex lino molli.	And it is necessary that the threads be of medium thickness and fineness, and that they be made of soft linen.
Quoniam si fila sunt grossa, sicut uidi ex operatione stolidorum ponentium fila sua ex chordis lini tortis, est error magnus: quoniam cadit strictura cum eis extra qualitatem.	Because if the threads are thick, as I saw from the operation of foolish people who put their threads from twisted hempen cords, it is a great error because the constriction falls with them outside the quality.
Et fila subtilia iterum non conueniunt: quoniam tu non consequeris per stricturam cum eis illud quod uis.	And fine threads do not again become suitable because you do not obtain through the stricture that which you desire.
Et non oportet, ut sit inter astellam et astellam minus quam digitus.	And it is not right that there be less than a finger's width between the stars.
Quod si laeditur infirmus per extremitates astellarum post stricturam in locis sanis: tunc pone sub eis ex stuppa leni, aut lana carminata, donec nihil laedatur ex illo.	If a patient is hurt by the extremities of the instruments after constriction in healthy places: then place under them from soft wool or carmine-dyed wool until nothing is harmed from it.
Quando autem est fractura cum uulnere, et accidit disruptio in cute, ego ueniam cum rememoratione eius in capitulo secundum singularitatem.	When, however, there is a fracture with a wound, and rupture occurs in the skin, I will come with a remembrance of it in the second chapter according to singularity.
Et scias, quod non omne membrum fractum oportet ut stringatur cum astellis a primo die.	And know that not every broken limb ought to be bound with splints from the first day.
Quod est, quia membrum quando est magnum, non oportet ut ponas superipsum astellas, nisi post quinque dies, aut septem, aut plus, secundum securitatem tuam ab euentu apostematis calidi.	That is, because when a limb is large, it should not be placed above itself with stars [i.e., a dressing or bandage], except after five days, or seven, or more, according to your security from the event of a hot abscess.
Et iste est modus emplastrorum, quibus restaurabant antiqui, quae ponuntur super fracturam et dislocationem.	And this is the way of plasters, which the ancients used to restore, which are placed upon a fracture and dislocation.
¶ Modus Emplastri communis abbreuiati, restaurans fracturam, conueniens pluribus complexionibus, praecipue mulieribus, et pueris: quoniam est ex eo super quod non uincit calor, neque frigus.	The method of a common poultice shortened, restoring a fracture, suitable for many complexions, especially women and children; because it is from that which does not overcome heat, nor cold.
Et est, ut accipias ex puluere molendini, et est medulla farinae quae pendet in parietibus molendini apud motum molae: et conficias ipsum sicut est, praeter quod cribelles ipsum cum albugine oui: et pone confectionem eius non spissam, neque subtilem.	And it is, as you take from the flour mill dust, and there is marrow of flour which hangs on the walls of the mill near the movement of the millstone: and you make it like this, except that strain it with the membrane of an egg white: and place its composition not thick, nor thin.
Deinde utere eo.	Then use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, restaurantis fracturam, et dislocationem, et torsionem.	A mode of plaster for restoring a fracture, and dislocation, and twisting.
Recipe almess, et laudani, et acaciae, et enulae, et mugath: et suc, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V et alethil ʒ XX terantur omnia, et cribellentur, et misceantur cum aqua alethil: aut cum albugine oui, si complexio infirmi est calefacta.	Take marshmallow, and laurel, and acacia, and enula, and mugwort: and juice of all, each ʒ X myrrh, and aloes of both each ʒ V and alethil ʒ XX are ground together, and sifted, and mixed with alethil water: or with egg white, if the complexion of the sick is heated.
Deinde utere hoc emplastro.	Then use this plaster.
Nam ipsum est bonae compositionis, restaurat ossa fracta uelociter, et confert pluribus hominibus.	For it is of good composition, restores broken bones quickly, and benefits many people.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, quod etiam confert fracturae et torsioni.	Another method of poultice, which also benefits fractures and sprains.
Recipe mugath, et mess, et alteae albae, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V acaciae ʒ VI boli armeni ʒ XX terantur omnia contritione multa, et cribellentur, et conficiantur cum aqua, aut albugine oui: et administrentur.	Take mugath and mess and white alum, each 10 grains; myrrh and aloes, each 5 grains; acacia, 6 grains; Armenian bolis, 20 grains. Grind all together thoroughly, sift them, and make a mixture with water or egg white. Administer.
¶ Modus Emplastri ad iuncturas, et ossa separata ex locis suis: et sedat dolorem accidentem eis, et scissuram ossis, et fracturam.	The method of a plaster for joints and bones separated from their places; and it sits the pain that happens to them, and the split of bone, and fracture.
Sumatur lana succida, et submergatur in aceto, et oleo decocto: et ponatur super locum.	Take wool that has not been spun and submerge it in vinegar and oil boiled: and place it over the location.
Et in hoc quidem Emplastro non est uirtus restaurationis, sed est bonum in sedatione apostematis calidi: et expellit dolores proprie.	And in this plaster there is no virtue of restoration, but it is good in the sedation of a hot abscess: and it drives out pains properly.
¶ Modus Emplastri, quod restaurat os fractum.	The Method of a Plaster for Restoring a Broken Bone
Sume folia fici surdi, et folia papaueris syluestris: et tere omnia, et fac emplastrum ex utrisque.	Take leaves of fig tree and leaves of wild poppy; and pound everything, and make a plaster from both.
¶ Modus Emplastri abbreuiati, administrati apud restaurationem fracturae ossis: et quando tu uis resolutionem residui apostematis.	The mode of a shortened poultice, administered at the restoration of a bone fracture; and when you wish the dissolution of the residue of an abscess.
Recipe radicis alteae, et camomillae, et florum uiolarum, et farinae herbi, omnium ana partem unam: terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum uino, si non est membrum calefactum.	Take root of althea, and chamomile, and violet flowers, and herb flour, all one part each: pound all things together, and make them into wine, unless the limb is heated.
Si uero est calefactum, tunc confice illud cum aqua coriandri humidi, aut cum aqua, et utere eo.	If it is hot, then make it with moist coriander water, or with water, and use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius fortioris in resolutione, quam istud primum, quando accidit apostema durum apud restaurationem membri.	Another method of a stronger poultice for dissolving a hard abscess when restoring a limb occurs.
Recipe radicis alteae, et seminis lini, et balaustiae, et melliloti, et samsuci, et floris uiolarum, et camomillae, omnium ana, partem unam, terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum aqua salicis, aut cum aqua dulci, aut cum uino.	Take root of althaea, and flaxseed, and balm, and melilot, and samsum, and violets flower, and chamomile, each one part, grind all together, and make with willow water, or with sweet water, or with wine.
Totum illud secundum caliditatem membri, et quietem caloris eius.	All of it according to the heat of the limb, and the quietness of its heat.
Hippocrates uero non dixit in libro suo, quod ponatur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius, nisi caerotum factum ex caera, et oleo: non aliud: et narrauit, ut sit medium inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem.	However Hippocrates did not say in his book that a thing should be placed on a broken limb during its restoration, except for a pad made of felt and oil: nothing else; and he narrated that it should be a medium between thickness and thinness.
Galeno autem uisum est, ut ponantur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius res, in quibus est exiccatio caliditatis, sicut myrrha, et aloes et olibanum, et similia eis ex eis quae narrauimus.	Galen thought that things should be placed on the broken limb during its restoration, in which is dryness of heat, such as frankincense, and aloes, and olibanum, and similar things to those which we have mentioned.
¶ Modus Emplastri quod confert ad laesionem et dolorem.	The method of a poultice that is applied to a wound and pain.
Recipe mugath, et ciceris, et capillorum hominis incisorum, aut pennae auis, et alteae, et salis partes aequales: terantur, et cribellentur, et conficiantur: et fiat ex eo emplastrum.	Take ground lentils, and mugwort, and the hair of man cut or feathers of a bird, and oak leaves, and salt, in equal parts; pound them, sift them, and mix them together; and make an ointment from this.
Quantitas autem secundum quam oportet, ut remaneat ligatura, deinde soluatur, est, ut consideres tunc, si non accidit infirmo dolor, neque pruritus, neque mouetur os fractum a loco suo: tunc non resoluas ipsum diebus multis.	The quantity, however, according to what is necessary, when the bandage should remain, is then to consider if no pain happens to the sick man, nor itching, nor is the broken bone moved from its place: then do not unravel it for many days.
Quod si accidat ei in loco pruritus uehemens, aut dolor inquietans, aut inflatio: tunc propera, et solue in hora ipsum, et aufer emplastrum ab eo: et accipe pannum lenem, aut spongiam marinam lenem, humidam: et submerge eam in aqua tepida, et ablue cum ea locum, donec quiescat pruritus, et sedetur dolor.	If it should happen that there is itching, severe or restless pain, or swelling in the place: then quickly, and within the hour, dissolve and remove the dressing from it; and take a soft cloth, or a soft sea sponge, moisten it in lukewarm water, and wash the place with it until the itching subsides and the pain settles.
Deinde dimitte membrum quiescere una hora.	Then let the limb rest for an hour.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam succidam, submersam in aceto et oleo, aut oleo rosato: et liga super ipsum nocte una, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido, et quiescat inflatio membri, et remoueatur dolor eius.	Then place on top of it a cloth dipped in vinegar and oil, or rose oil: and bind over it at night for one night until you are secure from the hot abscess, and the swelling of the limb rests, and the pain of it is removed.
Deinde itera ipsum ad stricturam subtilem, et emplastrum paruum: et non stringas ipsum constrictione tua prima, et subtilia cum eo, donec sanetur.	Then lead it again to the subtle stenosis, and a small poultice: and do not bind it with your first constriction, and more subtly with it, until it heals.
Quod si uides, quod apostema, et rubedo, et dolor, et inflatio, et omnia accidentia iam remota sunt penitus, et indiges emplastro et strictura, tunc itera illud sicut fecisti in primis aequaliter.	If you see that the abscess, redness, pain, and swelling, and all accidents have been removed completely, and the indigestion has disappeared from the plaster and constriction, then treat it again as you did at first equally.
Quod si non accidit membro aliquid ex eis quae diximus, tune non soluas ipsum, nisi post tres dies, aut quatuor, aut quinque, aut septem.	If nothing of those things we said happens to a member, then you do not loosen it unless after three days, or four, or five, or seven.
Et quando que dimittitur uiginti diebus totum illud, secundum quod apparet tibi ex solutione membri, sicut diximus, donec quando adhaeret fractura, et approximat coagulatio carnis super eam: adde etiam tunc in strictura plus quam strictura tua prima tota: et adde etiam in ingrossatione cibi infirmi, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius.	And when it is discharged after twenty days, the whole thing, according to what appears to you from the solution of the limb, as we said, until when the fracture adheres and the coagulation of flesh approaches above it: also add then in the constriction more than your first constriction altogether: and also add in the thickening of food for the sick, according to what precedes the recollection of it.
Si autem uides locum fracturae iam exiccari, et extenuari plus quam oportet: tunc scias, quod nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad ipsum.	If you see that the place of the fracture has already dried up and has widened more than necessary, then know that nourishment is prevented from reaching it.
Embroca ergo ipsum cum aqua tepida apud omnem uicem qua soluis ipsum, et sit illud in omnibus tribus diebus, et alleuia stricturam parumper.	Therefore, soak it with lukewarm water at every opportunity where you have dissolved it, and let it be so for all three days, and alleviate the stricture a little.
Per hanc ergo operationem currit ad membrum nutrimentum, et sanatur uelociter.	Therefore, through this operation nourishment flows to the limb and it heals quickly.
Illud autem quod faciunt stolidi restauratores ex fractura membri uice alia, quando non restauratur in primis, secundum quod oportet, et restauratur secundum tortuositatem, est error ex operatione eorum, et timor magnus: et si esset rectum, dixissent illud antiqui in libris suis, et operati fuissent cum eo.	This, however, which fools who restore from a broken limb make as vice versa, when it is not restored primarily as it ought to be, and restored according to the crookedness, is an error from their operation, and great fear: and if it were straight, they would have said this in their books of old, and they would have operated upon it.
Et ego non uidi alicubi eorum uestigium in illo omnino, et rectius est, ut non fiat illud.	And I did not see anywhere their trace in that at all, and it is better that it not be done.
¶ De factura accidente in capite.	On making an incision in the head.
Caput III.	Chapter III.
Species fracturae sunt diuersae, et figurae eius multae: et caussae eius sunt distinctae.	There are diverse kinds of fractures, and many forms of them; and their causes are distinct.
Nam ex fractura est quae fit a percussione cum ense: et percussio aufert os totum usquequo peruenit ad siphac, quod est sub osse, sicut facit axia in ligno: et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Axialis.	For from the fracture that is made by a blow with a sword: and the blow takes away the bone whole as far as it reaches to the siphac, which is under the bone, just as an axe does in wood: and because of this this kind of fracture is named Axial.
Aut ensis incidit quiddam ossis, et incidit faciem eius, et non penetrat incisio usque ad ultimum eius: et nominatur haec species fracturae Kalaan, id est, Leuatio absolute.	Or if a sword strikes something in the bone and strikes its face but the incision does not penetrate to its end, this kind of fracture is called Kalaan, that is, Absolute Leuatio.
Et est uulnus duarum fracturarum, aut magnum, aut paruum.	And there is a wound of two fractures, either large or small.
Et ex fractura est, quae est contritio, aut attritio: et caussa eius est percussio cum lapide, aut casus super lapidem, aut eis similia.	And from a fracture is, which is crushing or attrition: and its cause is a blow with a stone, or a fall upon a stone, or things similar to these.
Et haec fractura est etiam aut penetrans, quae iam appropinquat panniculo, quod est sub osse: aut est in facie ossis: et est uulnus harum duarum fracturarum etiam aut paruum, aut magnum.	And this fracture is also either penetrating, which already approaches the tissue beneath the bone, or is on the face of the bone; and is a wound of these two fractures also either small or large.
Et ex fractura est, quae est occulta in osse in subtilitate capilli: et est fissura parua, et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Capillaris.	And from fracture is this, which is hidden in the bone in the fineness of a hair: and it is a small fissure, and because of this this kind of fracture is named capillary.
Et ex eis est fractura, quae fit a casu, aut percussione lapidis, et eis similium, quae faciunt ingredi laminam ossis ad interiora, et fit loco concauitas: sicut accidit caldariis aeris, quando occurrit eis percussio, et ingreditur pars eorum ad interiora.	And of these there is a fracture that happens from a fall, or the strike of a stone, and things similar to it, which cause the lamina of bone to enter into the interior, and a concavity is made: just as happens to copper caldrons when they are struck, and part of them enters into the interior.
Et plurimum quidem fit illud in capitibus humidorum ossium, sicut sunt capita puerorum.	And this is most often found in the heads of moist bones, such as the heads of children.
Et fiunt omnibus istis speciebus fracturae satagiae separatae, et ego ueniam cum rememoratione illius totius in loco suo.	And these are all kinds of fractures separated, and I come with remembrance of the whole thing in its place.
Et cognoscimus omnes has species fracturae per detectionem super eam, et inquisitionem earum cum tentis, et ablationem carnium corruptarum, quae sunt super eas.	And we know all these kinds of fractures by examination upon them, and inquiry into them with probes, and removal of corrupted flesh that is upon them.
Species uero Capillaris cognoscitur per hoc, quod detegitur super os, et abstergitur, et linitur super ipsum cum encaustro: fractura enim apparet nigra.	A capillary species is recognized by this, that it is uncovered over the bone, and removed, and smoothed over it with encaustic; for indeed a fracture appears black.
In curatione autem fracturae, considera in primis accidentia infirmi: tunc si uides ex accidentibus quod significet significatione manifesta super timorem, sicut uomitus cholerae, et extensio, et amissio intellectus, et abscisio uocis, et syncopis, et febris acuta, et egressus oculorum, et rubedo eorum, et similia eis ex accidentibus in pluribus dispositionibus, proculdubio non sanatur: et si uides accidentia non terrentia te, et speras salutem: tunc incipe curationem eius.	In the treatment of a fracture, first consider the circumstances of the patient; then, if you see from the circumstances that which signifies manifest meaning fear, such as vomiting, cholera, extension, and loss of intellect, and cutting off of voice, and syncopes, and acute fever, and exit of eyes, and redness of them, and similar to these circumstances in many dispositions, undoubtedly it is not cured; and if you see the circumstances are not earthly to you, and you hope for salvation: then begin the treatment of him.
Quod est, si uenit ad te uulneratus in primis cum uulneratur: et est illud in diebus hyemis, tunc oportet, ut studeas in ablatione ossis ante diem quartumdecimum secundum omnem dispositionem.	That is, if a wounded person comes to you, first of all when he is wounded and it is winter, then it is necessary that you strive for the removal of the bone before the sixteenth day according to every arrangement.
Et si est in diebus aestatis, tunc oportet, ut properes remouere os ante diem septimum, antequam corrumpatur quod est sub osse ex panniculo, et accidant illa accidentia quae narrauimus.	And if it is in the days of summer, then it is necessary that you hasten to remove the bone before the seventh day, before that which is under the bone from the flesh rots, and those things which we have narrated happen.
Quod si fractura ossis iam peruenit ad panniculum tangentem cerebrum, et est cum minutiis, et attractione: tunc oportet, ut incidas partem comminutam, et attritam, secundum quod narro tibi.	If a fracture of the bone has already reached the membrane touching the brain, and it is with small pieces, and friction: then it is necessary that you cut the broken part, and rubbed, according to what I tell you.
Et est, ut radas caput uulnerati: et detege super os secundum quemcunque modum possibile est tibi: et secundum figuram uulneris, et quod leue est super infirmum.	And it is, as you cut the head of the wounded: and cover over the bone according to whatever way possible to you: and according to the shape of the wound, and what is light on the weak.
Quod si accidat tibi apud detectionem ossis fluxus sanguinis, aut apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet.	If it happens to you when detecting a bone that there is bleeding, or a hot abscess: then oppose it with what is necessary.
Et est, ut impleas locum cum pannis infusis in uino, et oleo rosato: et facias quiescere uulnus, donec sedetur apostema, et sis securus a fluxu sanguinis.	And it is, that you fill the place with cloths soaked in wine, and rose oil: and make the wound rest, until it sits pus, and you are secure from the flow of blood.
Deinde incipe in curatione ossis, et ablatione eius.	Then begin in the treatment of bone, and its removal.
Et illud fit secundum unum duorum modorum.	And this is done according to one of two modes.
Modus quidem unus est, ut incidas os cum Incisorio strictae aciei: et haec est forma eius.	There is one way to cut the jaw with a straight and sharp incision knife: and this is its form.
Dende administra Incisorium aliud post Incisorum latius eo parumper: et haec est forma eius.	Then administer another incision wider than the previous incisions, and this is its form.
Deinde administra etiam Incisorium aliud latius etiam quam secundum.	Then administer also another incision wider than the second.
Et modus secundus est, ut sit apud te numerus Incisoriorum diuersorum: quorum quaedam sint latiora quibusdam, et quaedam eorum breuiora quibusdam: et sint in ultimo acuitatis extremitatum suarum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut fuled: et utere facilitate in percussione super Incisorium, ut non concutiat caput, et laedat ipsum.	And the second way is that you have a number of different scalpels, some wider than others, and some shorter than others: and let them be at the last extremity of sharpness, and let them be made of iron or steel: and use ease in striking upon the scalpel so that it does not jar the head, nor injure it.
Si autem os est forte, durum: tunc oportet, ut perfores in circumitu eius, antequam tu administres Incisoria, cum Terebris quae nominantur Terebra non profundantia: et non nominantur ita, nisi quoniam ipsa non pertranseunt terminum ossis carnei ad illud, quod est post ipsum: propterea, quod Terebro est extremitas rotunda super illud, quod est sub capite eius acuto, similis margini, et circulus paruus prohibet submergi, et pertransire spissitudinem ossis.	If however the bone is hard and strong: then it is necessary that you perforate around it before administering the cutting instrument, with boring tools which are called Terebrae not going deeply; and they are not called so unless because they themselves do not pass through the limit of the bone to the flesh beyond it, because the Terebra has a rounded end above that which is under its sharp head, similar to a margin, and a small circle prevents submerging and passing through the thickness of the bone.
Et conuenit tibi, ut accipias ex istis Terebris numerum multum, quorum unumquodque conueniat quantitati spissitudinis ossis, donec praesens sit tibi omni craneo Terebrum: cuius extremitatis acutae quantitas in longitudine et breuitate sit, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis illius cranei.	And it is fitting for you to take from these terebrae a great number, of which each one should be suitable in quantity and thickness of bone, until you have at hand for the skull a terebrum: whose acute extremity quantity in length and shortness shall be according to the quantity of thickness of that skull.
Et haec est forma trium specierum Terebrorum, uel Trepanorum.	And this is the form of three kinds of terebrae, or trepanes.
Qualitas autem perforandi in circumitu ossis fracti, est: ut ponas Terebrum super os, et reuoluas ipsum digitis tuis, donec scias, os iam penetratum esse.	The quality of penetrating in the circumference of a broken bone is: that you place the terebrum over the bone, and turn it with your fingers until you know that the bone has already been penetrated.
Deinde permuta Terebrum ad locum alium, et pone quod est inter omne foramen quantitatem grossitudinis radii, aut circiter illud.	Then move the terebrum to another location, and place it where there is a space between all holes, equal in size to the thickness of the radius, or about that.
Deinde incide cum Incisoriis quod est inter omne foramen ex osse: et fac illud subtilius quam potes super illud ex fine leuitatis, sicut diximus, donec eradices os, aut manu tua, aut cum aliquo alio ex quibusdam instrumentis, quae parasti ad illud: sicut tenaliae, et forpices subtiles.	Then cut with a cutting tool where it is between every foramen in the bone: and make it more finely than you can above it from the end of its lightness, as we have said, until you remove the bone, or with your own hand, or with some other of certain instruments which you have prepared for it: such as pincers, and subtle forceps.
Et oportet, ut caueas omni cautela, ne tangat Terebrum, aut Incisorium aliquid ex siphac.	And it is necessary, that you guard with all care, lest the terebrum or scalpel touch anything from the bandage.
Cum ergo circumieris os perforando, et separatum fuerit a siphac, si fuerit continuum cum eo, et extraxeris ipsum, oportet ut radas, et aeques extremitatem eius quod remanet in osse cum instrumento alio simili Incisorio.	When therefore you go around the bone by perforating it, and having separated it from the sphenoid, if it was continuous with it, and having extracted it, it is necessary that you rasp it, and make the equal extremity of it which remains in the bone with another similar instrument like a cutting knife.
Verumtamen oportet, ut sit tenuis et subtilis magis aliis Incisoriis.	Nevertheless, it ought to be thin and subtle, more so than other incisions.
Quod si remanet aliquid ex ossibus paruis, et satagiae: tunc accipe ea cum facilitate, cum eo quod est apud te ex instrumentis.	If anything remains of the small bones and splinters, then take them with ease, with that which you have among your instruments.
Deinde cura uulnus post illud cum liciniis, et unguentis quae diximus.	Then, after this, care for the wound with the lotions and ointments that we have said.
Et modus alius operationis est facilis, prorsus longinquus a timore: quem dixit Galenus, et laudauit ipsum laude magna: et iste est sermo eius.	And another mode of operation is easy, very far from fear: which Galen said, and praised him with great praise: and this is his word.
Necese est tibi in primis, ut incipias detegere partem ossis ex loco, in quo fractura est uehementior, et manifestior: donec quando detexeris illam partem, et posueris sub eo extremitatem huius Incisorii lenticularis, cuius haec est forma.	First it is necessary for you to begin to uncover the part of the bone from the place in which the fracture is more severe and more manifest: until when you have uncovered that part, and placed beneath it the extremity of this lenticular Incision, whose this is the form.
Et pars lenticularis, lenis non incidit aliquid: et pars acuta eius in duabus lateribus eius uadens in longitudinem, sicut uides: ut sit pars lenticularis innixa ad siphac, facie eius incidente acuta in osse.	And the lens-shaped part, it does not strike anything soft; and the pointed part of it, biting on two sides of it lengthwise, as you see: so that the lens-shaped part is attached to the hipbone, its face striking the bone with a point.
Deinde percute super Incisorium a parte una cum malleo paruo, donec incidas totum os cum facilitate, sicut reuoluitur: et tu sis securus ex panniculo, quod non accidat in eo accidens, quod timeas prorsus.	Then strike upon the incision with one side of a small hammer until you cut through the whole bone with ease, as it revolves; and be sure from the cloth that no accident will happen in it which you should fear at all.
Et si medicans non esset stultior hominum, et magis ignarus eius, nec esset dormiens, tunc si remaneret aliquid annexum ossi ex panniculo in quibusdam locis, incideret ipsum ab eo cum extremitate incisorii lenticularis ipsius, et liberaret ipsum ab eo cum facilitate.	And if the surgeon were not a fool among men, and more ignorant of it, nor asleep, then if something remained attached to the bone from the flap in some places, he would cut it off from it with the edge of the lenticular incision tool, and free it from it with ease.
Liberatur enim ab eo sine nocumento, et absque timore.	It is released from it without harm, and without fear.
Et si fractura ossis non penetret usque ad panniculum, et illud quod abscinditur ab osse est facies eius, et remanent in ipso asperitas et satagiae subtiles: tunc oportet, ut radas illam asperitatem, et eradices illas satagias cum rasoriis subtilibus ex quibus praeparasti numerum diuersarum quantitatum, ut sit tibi possibile administrare ex eis in omni loco conuenientiora eorum, et rectiora ipsorum, secundum illud ad quod perducit te operatio, et ipsum os fractum, et figura eius.	And if the fracture of a bone does not penetrate to the subcutaneous tissue, and that which is cut off from the bone is its face, and there remain in it roughness and subtle splinters: then it is necessary to shave away that roughness, and to eradicate those splinters with fine razors of which you have prepared a number of various sizes, so that it may be possible for you to administer them in every convenient place, and to make them straighter, according to what the operation leads you to, and the broken bone itself, and its figure.
Et oportet, ut administres in rasione tua, qua in primis radis os, latius illorum rasoriorum.	And it is necessary that you administer in your work, especially on bones, broader than their rasps.
Deinde utere post ipsum subtiliore eo.	Then use something finer after it.
Et non cesses facere illud secundum continuitatem, donec peruenias ad administrandum tenuius, et subtilius eorum omnium.	And do not cease doing this according to continuity, until you arrive at administering finer and more subtle of them all.
In unaquaque autem fissurarum reliquarum paruarum capillarium, et fractura subtili, oportet ut administres curam, secundum illud quod perducit ad rectificationem eius.	In every wound of whatever kind, and in the case of small capillaries and fine fractures, it is necessary that you give care according to what leads to its repair.
Et est res quae non occultatur super omnem, cui in hac arte est quodlibet studium, et stetit super illud quod scripsimus, et ostendimus in fracturis magnis.	And there is a matter which is not hidden from everyone who has some study in this art, and it stands upon what we have written and shown in great fractures.
Si autem panniculus detectus retinetur, quando tu eradicas os: tunc oportet, ut accipias pannum lini, secundum quantitatem uulneris, et submerge ipsum in oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super orificium uulneris.	If however the subcutaneous tissue is detected and retained when you remove the bone; then it is necessary that you take a linen cloth, according to the quantity of the wound, and submerge it in rose oil, and place it over the opening of the wound.
Deinde accipe pannum alium duplicatum, aut triplicatum, et submerge ipsum in uino et oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super pannum primum: et fac illud quam facilius potes super illud, ut non grauetur siphac.	Then take another piece of cloth, doubled or tripled, and immerse it in wine and rose oil, and place it on top of the first cloth; and do this as easily as you can so that it does not irritate the wound.
Deinde administra supra ipsum ligamentum latum: et non stringas ipsum, nisi per quantitatem quae teneat uulnus tantum: et dimitte ipsum cum hac cura die uno, aut diebus duobus, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido.	Then administer above this broad ligament and do not tighten it unless by the quantity which will hold the wound only: and release it with this care on one day, or two days, until you are certain about the hot abscess.
Deinde solue ipsum, et administra post illud medicinas cum quibus est superflua siccitas: sicut radices lilii, et farina herbi, et puluis thuris, et aristolochia, et similia eis: et est, ut facias ex istis medicinis puluerem, qui puluerizetur super uulnus sicut sunt siccae.	Then dissolve it and administer afterwards medicines with which there is superfluous dryness: such as lily roots, and herb flour, and frankincense powder, and aristolochia, and things similar to these: and let it be so that you make from these medicines a powder, which shall be powdered over the wound as they are dry.
Et uniuersaliter administra in illo omnem medicinam de proprietate cuius est ut abstergat, et non mordicet.	And universally administer in it all medicine of the property of which it is that it cleanses and does not bite.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, ut uulnus in curatione tua sit limpidum: neque sit in ea sordes unguenti, neque sordicies.	And take care according to your ability, so that the wound in your care be clean: and let there not be in it filth of ointment, nor dirtiness.
Neque dimittas uirus aggregari in eo omnino: quoniam quando uirus aggregatur super panniculum cerebri, corrumpit eum, et putrefacit ipsum, et accidit super infirmum post illud malicia magna: et iam accidit in siphac capitis, cum mundificatur ab eo os, praecipue quando negligitur cura eius, nigredo in superficie eius.	And do not allow the pus to gather there at all; because when pus gathers over the brain's fat, it spoils it and rots it, and a great evil happens to the sick person afterward; and this sometimes happens in the skull, when it is cleansed from it, especially when care for it is neglected, blackness appears on its surface.
Considera ergo tunc, si accidunt infirmo accidentia quae diximus, scias, quia est pernitiosum proculdubio.	Therefore consider, if accidents happen to the sick which we have said, know that it is undoubtedly harmful.
Et si nigredo non accidit, nisi a medicina quae ponitur super ipsum, et est in uirtute illius medicinae, ut faciat illam nigredinem: tunc oportet, ut accipias ex melle partem unam, ex oleo rosato partes tres, et linias cum eis pannum.	And if blackness does not occur, except from the medicine which is placed upon it, and it is in the power of that medicine to make that blackness; then it is necessary that you should take one part of honey, three parts of rose oil, and linen with them cloth.
Deinde pone ipsum super siphac: postea cura ipsum cum speciebus curationis quae conueniunt, donec sanetur.	Then place him on a couch: afterwards take care of him with appropriate types of healing until he heals.
¶ De restauratione Nasi quando frangitur.	On the restoration of the nose when it is broken.
Caput IIII.	Chapter IV.
Scias, quod non franguntur ex Naso nisi duae partes eius superiores simul, aut una earum: propterea, quod ipse sunt duo ossa: quoniam inferius eius est cartilaginosum, non frangitur, et non accidit ei nisi attritio, et tortuositas, et simitas.	Know that the two upper parts of the nose are broken only together or one of them; because they are two bones: for the lower part is cartilaginous and it does not break but only attrition, twists, and similar things happen to it.
Si frangitur una duarum partium eius, tunc oportet, ut intromittas digitum paruum in foramen Nasi, et aeques illam fracturam digito tuo indice, et pollice deforis, donec redeat Nasus super figuram suam naturalem: et fiat illud arte, cum facilitate.	If one of the two parts is broken, then it is necessary to insert a small finger into the hole of the nose and equal that fracture with your index finger and thumb until the nose returns to its natural form; and let this be done skillfully and easily.
Et caue, ne accidat per operationem tuam illam super infirmum dolor.	And beware, lest it happen through your operation that pain come upon the weak one.
Quod si fractura est in superiore parte Nasi, et non perueniat ad illam digitus: tunc oportet, ut aequetur extremitate radii, in quo sit grossitudo parua.	If the fracture is in the upper part of the nose and the finger cannot reach it, then it is necessary that the extremity of the radius be made equal, in which there is a small thickness.
Si uero fractura est in duabus partibus, tunc fac simile illius: et propera cum restauratione eius in die primo fracturae, si est possibile.	If a fracture is in two parts, then make something similar to it, and hasten with its restoration on the first day of the fracture, if it is possible.
Et si non, tunc post diem septimum, aut decimum apud quietem apostematis calidi.	And if not, then after the seventh, or tenth day at rest of the hot abscess.
Deinde intromitte in extremitate Nasi licinium ex panno lini, si fractura est in parte una: aut intromite duo licinia si fractura est in duabus partibus: et sit in licinio grossitudo tantae quantitatis, quae impleat foramen Nasi.	Then introduce a linen plug into the end of the Nose, if the fracture is in one part: or introduce two plugs if the fracture is in two parts: and let there be in the plug a thickness such that it fills the opening of the Nose.
Et dixerunt quidam antiquorum restauratorum, ut infundantur licinia in butyro, et permutentur omni die.	And some of the old restorers said that one should pour liniment into butter and change it every day.
Illud uero non uidetur mihi, imo oportet, ut infundatur licinium in albugine oui, confecto cum puluere molendini.	It does not seem to me, indeed it ought not, that chalk be poured into the albuginea after it has been mixed with mill dust.
Deinde dimitte licinium, donec firmetur os, et induretur cartilago.	Then release the ligature until the bone is firm and the cartilage has hardened.
Et quandoque intromittitur in Nasum loco licinii penna anseris, postquam inuoluitur super ipsam pannus lenis: et fit, quod ipsa tenet fracturam Nasi uehementius, et ut non prohibeatur infirmus ab inspiratione.	And sometimes a goose feather is introduced into the nose in place of a ligature, after it has been wrapped with a soft cloth: and this holds the fracture of the nose more firmly, so that the patient is not prevented from breathing.
Et non est haec res necessaria.	And this thing is not necessary.
Si uis, fac illud: et si uis, fac licinia.	If you wish, do it; and if you wish, do differently.
Quod si accidat Naso iterum dum operaris apostema calidum, emplastra nasum cum caeroto, aut cum coto infuso in oleo rosato, aut modico ex dyaquilon.	If it happens that the nose becomes again inflamed while you are operating, apply a plaster to the nose with cauterization, or with a cloth soaked in oil of roses, or a small amount of diacoylon.
Si autem non accidit apostema calidum, tunc oportet, ut emplastres ipsum cum farina sisami, et puluere thuris confecti cum albugine oui.	If however a hot abscess does not occur, then it is necessary to apply a poultice made with sesame flour and the powder of frankincense mixed with egg white.
Deinde pone super ipsum stuppam lenem, et non liges Nasum cum aliquo omnino.	Then place a soft wad on top of it, and do not apply anything at all to the nose.
Si uero franguntur ossa Nasi fractura parua, aut comminuuntur, tunc oportet, ut scindas super ea, et extrahas ipsa cum instrumentis quae conueniunt eis.	If bones of the nose are broken, a small fracture or splintered, then it is necessary that you cut over them and remove them with instruments which are suitable for them.
Deinde sue scissuram, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat, et consolidat ex emplastris conuenientibus ad illud, uel unguentis.	Then suture the cut, and take care of it with that which is to be engrafted and consolidated from appropriate plasters or ointments.
Quod si accidat inter Nasum uulnus, tunc oportet, ut cures ipsum cum liciniis: et administres cannulam de plumbo, donec sanetur.	If a wound occurs between the nose, then it is necessary to cure it with lead dressings, and administer a lead tube until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Mandibulae inferioris, quando disrumpitur.	On the restoration of the lower jaw when it is broken.
Caput V.	Chapter V.
Quando disrumpitur Mandibula inferior, et fractura eius non est cum uulnere: conspice tunc si est fractura eius deforis tantum, et non frangitur in duo, et curuatur ad interiora: tunc cognitio eius est facilis.	When the lower jaw is broken, and the fracture is not with a wound: then look if the fracture is only on the outside, and it does not break in two, and it bends inwards: then its knowledge is easy.
Oportet ergo, si est fractura eius in parte dextra, ut intromittas digitum indicem sinistrae in os infirmi: similiter si fractura est in mandibula sinistra, tunc intromitte indicem manus dextrae: et impelle cum eo gibbositatem fracturae deintus cum facilitate ad exteriora cum manu tua altera ab interiori parte ossis decenter, et cum eo aequa ipsam.	Therefore, if there is a fracture in the right part, you must insert your left index finger into the bone of the injured person; similarly, if the fracture is in the left jawbone, then insert the right hand's index finger: and push with it the bump of the fracture inward with ease to the outside with your other hand from the inner part of the bone centrally, and with it equalize it.
Quod si fractura mandibulae iam separata est in duo, tunc oportet, ut administres extersionem a duabus partibus, secundum rectitudinem: donec possibilis sit aequatio eius.	If the fracture of the jawbone has already been separated into two parts, then it is necessary for you to administer traction from the two parts, according to straightness, until it is possible to make them equal.
Si autem iam accidit in dentibus commotio, aut disruptio: tunc stringe illos de quibus speras quod remaneant cum filo auri, aut argenti, aut seta.	If however a shaking or disruption occurs in the teeth: then bind those of which you hope that they will remain with a thread of gold, silver, or silk.
Deinde pone super mandibulam fractam caerotum.	Then place a pad over the broken jawbone.
Deinde pone super ipsum pannum duplicatum, et pone super pannum astellam magnam decenter factam: aut frustum cutis soleae aequale, in longitudinem mandibulae.	Then place over this doubled cloth, and place on top of the cloth a large pad made centrally; or a piece of sole skin equal in length to the jawbone.
Deinde liga ipsum desuper, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ligatura eius, et conuenit ipsius applicatio, donec non destruitur: et praecipe infirmo, uti tranquillitate et quiete: et pone cibum eius sorbitiones lenes.	Then bind the same from above, according to how the bandage is prepared for you, and it is fitting for its application until it is destroyed: and order the sick person to be in tranquility and quiet; and place food of his imbibing gentle.
Si autem estimas, quod iam alteratur aliquid figurae aliquo modorum: tunc propera, et solue ipsum in die tertio.	If you judge that something is changing in the figure in any way: then hasten and dissolve it on the third day.
Deinde rectifica quod alteratum est ex eo, et emplastra ipsum ex puluere molendini, cum albugine oui, aut cum farina sisami, postquam tu abstuleris caerotum: et pone super emplastrum lanam lenem.	Then rectify what has been altered from it, and apply a plaster to it from ground meal powder, with albuginea of egg white, or with sesame flour, after you have removed the cauterization: and place soft wool over the plaster.
Dum ergo permanet annexum illud emplastrum super ipsum, et non alteratur ossis dispositio, dimitte ipsum, ne soluas, donec sanetur: aut stringe fracturam.	Therefore, as long as that plaster remains attached to it, and the bone's arrangement is not altered, let him be released, so that you do not loosen it, until it heals; or bind the fracture.
Multotiens enim stringitur haec fractura in tribus septimanis.	Often indeed this fracture is set in three weeks.
Quod si interim accidat apostema calidum, tunc administra illud quod diximus multotiens in sedatione eius, donec remoueatur illud apostema.	If meanwhile a hot abscess occurs, then administer that which we have said many times for its appeasement until the abscess is removed.
Et si fractura est cum uulnere, considera.	And if the fracture is with a wound, consider.
Namsi iam separatur ex osse frustum, aut a satagie: tunc subtilia te in hoc, ut auferas illa frusta satagiae cum eo quod conuenit tibi in ablatione eorum ex instrumentis.	Now the fragment is separated from the bone, or from the saw; then be more subtle in this, that you remove those fragments of the saw with that which is convenient to you in their removal from the instruments.
Si uero orificium uulneris est strictum, tunc amplifica ipsum cum phlebotomo secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	If, however, the opening of the wound is narrow, then widen it with a lancet according to the amount of necessity you have.
Deinde quando abstuleris illa satagie, et non remanserit ex eis aliquid, sue tunc orificium uulneris, si est amplum: et si non, pone super ipsum ex emplastris quae conueniunt ad illud, et incarnant illud, donec sanetur.	Then when you have removed those rags and nothing remains of them, then close the wound opening, if it is wide; and if not, put over it from plasters that are suitable for it, and they will cover it until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Furculae, quando frangitur.	On the restoration of the collarbone, when it is broken.
Caput VI.	Chapter VI.
Plurimum quidem frangitur Furcula ab anteriore parte ex parte humeri, et fractura eius fit secundum unum trium modorum.	The clavicle is indeed broken most frequently from the front part of the shoulder and its fracture occurs according to one of three modes.
Aut enim frangitur et separatur in duo, praeter quod accidant in ea satagiae: et est facilius ad restaurationem eius.	Or it breaks and is separated into two, besides which things happen to it; and it is easier to restore it.
Aut ita, quod accidunt in osse satagiae: et est difficilius ad restaurationem.	Or thus, which happen in the bone of a shaft: and it is more difficult for restoration.
Aut ita, quod est fractura cum uulnere.	Or so, which is a fracture with a wound.
Et operatio in ea quando fractura est absque uulnere, est, ut facias praesentes esse duos ministros, ut teneat unus eorum adiutorium quod sequitur Furculam fractam, et alter extendat collum uersus partem.	And the operation on it when there is a fracture without a wound, is, that you make two assistants present, so that one of them holds the aid which follows the broken Fork, and the other extends the neck towards the part.
Deinde aequa fracturam digitis tuis, donec fiat forma eius, secundum quod oportet: et non sit in ea eminentia, neque concauitas.	Then equalize the fracture with your fingers until its form is made, according to what is necessary: and let there be neither prominence nor concavity in it.
Quod si indiges extensione plus, tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico infirmi spheram ex panno, aut lana: et sit magnitudo eius secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae: et extende, et eleua Furculam, et coarta spheram manu tua, donec aeques fracturam, secundum quod oportet.	If the swelling extends more, then it is necessary to place under the patient's swollen area a sphere from cloth, or wool: and let its size be according to the quantity of your need: and extend and elevate the forceps, and constrict the sphere with your hand, until the fracture is equal, according to what is needed.
Quod si non potes trahere extremitatem Furculae ad exteriora: propterea, quia peruenit ad profundum: tunc oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et ponas sub humero eius puluinar medium in magnitudine, et premat minister humerum eius ad inferiora, donec eleuetur os Furculae quod est in profundo ad sursum: atque tunc rectifica fracturam, et aequa eam digitis tuis.	If you cannot draw the extremity of the clavicle outwards because it has reached deep within; then, it is necessary to make the patient lie down on his neck and put a pillow medium in size under his shoulder, and have an assistant press the shoulder downwards until the part of the clavicle which is deep rises upwards; and then straighten the fracture and make it even with your fingers.
Si autem sentis sathaiatum ex Furcula, et mouetur: tunc oportet, ut findas super illud, et extrahas ipsum alsathaiatum cum facilitate.	If you feel a foreign object from the collarbone, and it moves: then it is necessary to locate it above it and extract that foreign object with ease.
Si autem est retentum in osse, tunc ingenia in incisione eius cum uno Incisoriorum quae praeparasti ad illud, postquam tu posueris sub Furcula instrumentum quod seruat sifach: et est instrumentum ex ligno, aut ex ferro.	If it is retained in the bone, then use your ingenuity in its incision with one of the Cutters which you have prepared for this purpose, after you have placed under the Forcipes an instrument which saves sifach. And this instrument is made of wood or iron.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Assimilatur cochleari cui non est concauitas.	It is like a spoon which has no concavity.
Et sit latitudo eius secundum illud quo indiges eo ex magnitudine ossis, et paruitate eius.	Let its width be according to that which you need it to be from the size of the bone, and its nature.
Longitudo uero eius etiam secundum quod possibile est tibi ad operationem.	Its length is also according to what is possible for you to the operation.
Et habeat duas extremitates, sicut uides: et extremitas una sit ampla, et altera stricta.	And let it have two extremities, as you see: and one extremity be wide, and the other narrow.
Si autem disruptio uulneris quod scidisti quando extraxisti sathaiatum ossis, est ampla, et securaris ab apostemate calido: tunc aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura.	If, however, the wound that you made when extracting a piece of bone is wide, and it is threatened by hot suppuration, then gather the two lips of the wound together with suture.
Et si disruptio est parua, aut times apostema calidum: tunc imple uulnus cum pannis, et puluillis secundum quantitatem scissurae uulneris.	And if the rupture is small, or a hot abscess threatens: then fill the wound with cloths, and wool according to the quantity of the wound's cut.
Quod si accidat apostema calidum, tunc infunde pannum in oleo rosato, et aceto, et uino, et pone super ipsum.	If a hot abscess occurs, then pour linen cloth soaked in rose oil, vinegar, and wine, and place it on top of it.
Strictura uero ossis quando est absque uulnere, et absque sectione, est, ut ponas super os emplastrum factum ex farina molendini cum albugine oui.	A stricture of bone when it is without a wound and without a section, is, as you put over the bone a plaster made from flour of mill with albumen of egg.
Et pone stuppam lenem super ipsum.	And place a soft plug upon it.
Deinde pone spheram sub titillico eius, si indiges illa.	Then place a sphere under its point, if you need it so.
Deinde accipe himematem, id est, rotam quam tenent Saraceni, quae sit longa ualde: et sit latitudo eius palmi unius, aut circiter illud.	Then take a hemamath, that is, a board which the Saracens hold, which is long quite a bit; and let its width be one palm, or thereabouts.
Deinde pone puluillum duplicatum super stuppam et emplastrum.	Then place a small doubled piece over the wool and ointment.
Deinde accipe astellam ex tabula subtili, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, et in longitudine similiter.	Then take a star from a fine board, whose width is three fingers wide, and similarly in length.
Deinde inuolue eam in panno.	Then wrap it in a cloth.
Deinde inuolue pannum illum cum astella in loco alhimemati qui cadit super fracturam et locum.	Then wrap that cloth with a star in the place of the hematoma which falls upon the fracture and its location.
Deinde pone alhimemati super fracturam sicut reuoluiur, et inuolue eam super collum eius, et sub titillico eius sano, et sub titillico eius infirmo: et reduc eam super omnem partem, et quomodo uides quod strictura tenet fracturam strictura decenti: et est illud, quod non occultatur super te, et totum, ut non remoueatur astella desuper os fractum.	Then place the alheminati upon the fracture as it is revolved, and envelop it upon his neck, and under its sound splint, and under its diseased splint: and reduce it upon every part, and how you see that a stricture holds the fracture a stricture decent: and this is that which is not concealed over thee, and the whole, so that it not be removed as star from above the broken bone.
Et propter hoc oportet, ut aspicias infirmum in omni die.	Therefore, it is necessary that you look at the sick person every day.
Quotiens ergo mollificatur ligamentum, et uides astellam iam remoueri: tunc rectifica illud, et stringe ligamentum.	Whenever therefore the ligament is softened, and you see the star already removed: then rectify it, and tighten the ligament.
Deinde pone somnum infirmi super dorsum eius, et pone sub titillico eius apud somnum eius puluinar paruum in nocte, ut cum eo eleuetur adiutorium eius a latere ipsius.	Then place the patient's sleep upon his back, and place under his pillow at his sleep a small cushion at night, so that when he is raised it will help him from the side of himself.
Eleuatur ergo fractura furculae per eleuationem humeri.	Therefore, the fracture of the clavicle is elevated by elevating the shoulder.
Aut liga brachium eius ad collum ipsius: et non soluas ligamentum, si non accidat in loco accidens ex pruritu, aut ab apostemate, usque ad duodecim dies.	Either bind his arm to his neck: and do not untie the bandage, unless an accident happens in place from itching, or from a boil, until the twelfth day.
Deinde renoua emplastrum, si uideris faciem eius ad illud.	Then renew the plaster, if you see its face to it.
Et adde in strictura, et dimitte ipsum, donec restauretur et coaguletur.	And add to the stricture, and let it go, until it is restored and coagulated.
Et fractura quidem furculae stringitur et confortatur secundum plurimum in uigintiocto diebus: et quandoque fit in quibusdam hominibus in minore illo.	And indeed a fracture of the collarbone is tightened and fortified for as long as possible in twenty-eight days; and sometimes it is done in certain men in less than that.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spatulae.	On the restoration of a scapula fracture.
Caput VII.	Chapter VII.
Raro frangitur Spatula, et in loco lato eius: et non franguntur ex ea nisi margines eius.	A spatula is rarely broken, and if it breaks, it does so in its broad part, and only its edges break from it.
Quando ergo frangitur ex eo locus, et frangitur in medio eius, et non cognoscitur illud nisi per tactum: tunc secundum quod est figura fracturae conare praeparationem eius.	When therefore that place is broken from it, and broken in the middle of it, and that thing is not known except by touch: then according to what figure the fracture is, try preparation of it.
Et reduc eam super figuram naturalem omni modo ingenii, quod est tibi possibile.	And reduce her back to her natural shape in every way possible.
Deinde pone super locum puluerem molendini cum albugine oui, et stuppam lenem, et pone desuper puluillum ex panno duplato.	Then place over the place powder of mill with albuginea of an egg, and a soft plug, and put on top a little from doubled cloth.
Deinde pone super ipsum astellam latam ex tabula subtili secundum quantitatem Spatulae totius, aut ampliorem ea parum.	Then place over it a wide plate from a board, subtle according to the quantity of the whole spatula, or slightly larger.
Si uero sub astella est concauitas in aliquo locorum Spatulae, tunc aequa illam concauitatem cum stuppa leni, donec descendat astella secundum aequalitatem.	If, however, there is a concavity under the star [surgical instrument] in some places, then equal that concavity with soft padding until the star descends according to equality.
Deinde ftringe desuper cum alhimemati longa, constrictione decenti, et firmitudine astellae, donec non remoueatur a loco suo.	Then tightly bind from above with long alum and a suitable constriction, and steadfastness of a star, until it is not removed from its place.
Et considera ligamentum in omni die.	And consider the ligament every day.
Quotienscunque ergo mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum, et aequa astellam si remoueatur a loco suo: et iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	Therefore, whenever a ligament is softened, tighten it, and if the bone is moved from its place, set it even, and let the sick person lie on his sound side.
Et Spatula quidem restauratur in uiginti diebus, aut in uigintiquinque diebus.	And the spatula is indeed restored in twenty days, or in twenty-five days.
Quando ergo completur iste numerus, tunc solue ligamentum: et tu sis in securitate.	When therefore this number is complete, then loosen the ligament: and you shall be in safety.
Nam ipsa est ex ossibus quorum communitio non timetur, neque eorum solutio.	For it is made from bones whose union is not feared, nor their separation.
Si autem procedat ex osse frustum, et pungit sub cute: tune scinde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum.	If however a piece of bone proceeds and pierces under the skin: then cut above it, and remove it.
Et fac quod diximus in fractura furculae ex sedatione apostematis calidi, si accidat ex eo aliquid.	And do what we said about a fracture of the collarbone from the heat of an abscess, if anything happens from it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Pectoris.	On the restoration of a broken breastbone.
Caput VIII.	Chapter VIII.
Pectus quandoque frangitur in medio sui, et raro accidit illud.	The breast sometimes breaks in the middle of itself, and this rarely happens.
Extremitates eius quidem plurimum franguntur, et comminuuntur ex accidentibus eius.	The extremities of it are indeed very much broken and shattered by accidents.
Quando frangitur eius medium, quod declinat ad inferiora, et accidit ei dolor uehemens, et difficultas in anhelitu, et tussis: et fortasse euomit sanguinem, et declaratur concauitas in osse fracto, et non occultatur sensui, Restauratio eius est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et pone inter Spatulas eius puluinar.	When the middle of it is broken, which slopes downward, and a violent pain occurs to him, and difficulty in breathing and coughing: and perhaps he vomits blood, and the concavity in the broken bone is declared and not hidden from the sense, Restoration of it is, that the sick person be laid on his back: and put between the Spatulas of his legs.
Deinde preme humeros eius, et aggrega costas a duabus partibus uel lateribus cum manibus: et subtiliare in aequatione eius, secundum omnem modum quo possibile est illud et conuenit, donec redeat figura ossis, secundum quod oportet.	Then press his shoulder blades together and bring the ribs from both sides with your hands: and gently adjust them into their proper position, as much as possible and convenient, until the bone returns to its shape as it should be.
Deinde pone super ipsum emplastrum et stuppam, et pone desuper astellam ex tabula subtili ex salice, aut chalingi, et ex eis similibus in leuitate, postquam tu inuoluis eam in panno.	Then place upon this a plaster and wool, and place on top a splint from thin board of willow, or ash, and similar things in lightness, after you have wrapped it in cloth.
Deinde subtiliare in ligando eam super os fractum, ut non remoueatur: et uade cum ligatura secundum rotunditatem ad dorsum aliquotiens, et stringe ipsum strictura decenti.	Then carefully bind it above the broken bone so that it does not move; and go with the bandage according to the roundness to the back several times, and tighten it with a decent constriction.
Deinde considera ligaturam in omni hora, et quotienscumque mollificatur, stringe eam: et si necessitas eius prouocat ad solutionem eius apud pruritum, uel corrosionem quae accidit in loco, aut dolorem, aut apostema: tunc propera, et solue eam, et eradica emplastrum, et rectifica quod accidit cum modo curationis eius.	Then consider the bandaging at all hours, and whenever it softens, tighten it. And if necessity requires its release because of itching, or corrosion that occurs in the place, or pain, or abscess: then hasten, and loosen it, and remove the dressing, and correct what has happened with the mode of its treatment.
Deinde reduc emplastrum, si uides ad illud faciem: et annecte ei stricturam, donec sanetur.	Then place the dressing back on if you see it has adhered to that surface: and bind a constriction around it until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Costarum, quando franguntur.	On the restoration of ribs when they are broken.
Caput IX.	Chapter IX.
Scias, quod Costarum fractura non accidit, nisi in locis grossis quae sequuntur dorsum, et ex extremitatibus earum ab anteriori parte.	Know that a fracture of the ribs does not occur except in the large places which follow the back, and from their extremities on the front part.
Et non accidit eis attritio, nisi propterea, quia sunt cartilaginosae.	And this does not happen to them from attrition, except because they are cartilaginous.
Et cognitio ipsius non occultatur sensui apud inquisitionem cum digitis.	And its knowledge is not hidden from the sense during examination with the fingers.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, ut aeques fracturam cum digitis secundum modum possibilem, donec aequetur figura, secundum quod oportet.	And restoration of it is made so that the fracture be equal with the fingers according to as much as possible, until the figure be made equal, according as it ought.
Deinde emplastra, et stringe os fractum cum astella, si indiget illo.	Then apply plasters, and bind the broken bone with a splint if it is needed.
Et si fractura Costarum est decliuis ad interiora: tunc accidit infirmo dolor uehemens, et punctura, sicut punctura illa quae accidit illi qui habet pleuresim: propterea, quod os pungit uelamen, et etiam ei accidit difficultas anhelitus, et tussis, et uomitus sanguinis multi: et haec est difficilis curationis.	And if a rib fracture is sloping inward: then there happens to the patient a very strong pain, and a stabbing, like that which happens to him who has pleurisy: because the bone pricks the membrane, and also he gets difficulty breathing, and coughing, and vomiting of much blood: and this is difficult to cure.
Et iam ingeniati sunt antiqui in ea cum ingeniis multis: et ex eis sunt qui dicunt, ut ponas cibos infirmi qui generent inflammationem et uentositatem, ut inflammetur uenter, et extendatur, et impellatur fractura ad exteriora.	And now the ancients were ingenious in this with many ingenuities: and of these there are those who say, that you put foods into the infirm which generate inflammation and wind, so that the belly may be inflamed, and extended, and the fracture driven to the outside.
Nos uero abhorremus, ut non fiat caussa uelox ad faciendum apostema calidum, si non accidit.	We however abhor that it may not be a cause quickly to make a hot abscess, if it does not occur.
Si autem iam accidit, tunc addit in eo.	If however this has already happened, then he adds to it.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: ponatur super locum uentosa, deinde sugatur cum fortitudine, et est similius ratiocinationi.	And some of them said: let a wind be placed over the place, then suck it with force, and this is similar reasoning.
Verumtamen timetur, quod attrahat uentosa superfluitates ad locum, propter dispositionem debilitatis.	However, it is feared that it will draw windy superfluities to the place because of the predisposition to weakness.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: oportet ut cooperiatur locus cum lana quae iam submersa est in oleo calido: et ponantur puluilli inter Costas, donec impleatur: ut sit ligatura aequalis quando inuoluis eam secundum rotunditatem.	And some of them said that the place ought to be covered with wool which has already been immersed in hot oil, and let small pads be placed between the ribs until it is filled, so that it may be an equal bandage when you wrap it according to its roundness.
Deinde curetur infirmus curatione pleuresis ex cibo et medicina.	Then the sick person is treated with treatment for pleurisy from food and medicine.
Quod si coartat infirmum res uehemens, quam non tolerat, et os pungit uelamen punctura laedente, et timemus super infirmum: tunc oportet, ut scindamus super locum, et detegamus a Costa fracta.	If the weak thing is constrained by violent force which it cannot endure, and the bone pierces the flesh with a piercing wound, and we fear for the weakened person; then it is necessary that we cut above the place, and expose the broken rib.
Deinde ponamus super ea instrumentum quod conseruat sifac, cuius rememoratio praecessit: et incidamus os cum facilitate, et incidamus ipsum.	Then we place upon it an instrument that preserves the suture, whose recollection preceded: and let us cut the bone with ease, and let us cut it.
Deinde aggregemus duo labia uulneris, si est magnum cum sutura: et curemus ipsum cum emplastris, donec sanetur.	Then we shall bring together the two lips of the wound, if it is large with suture; and let us treat it with plasters until it heals.
Quod si accidat interim apostema calidum, tunc propera, et infunde puluillos in oleo rosato, et pone super locum: et curetur infirmus cum eo quod conuenit apostemati.	If it happens during this time that a hot abscess occurs, then hasten, and pour in small pellets in rose oil, and place over the spot: and let the sick person care for it as is fitting for an abscess.
Interim etiam resupinetur super latus super quod dormit, donec sanetur.	Meanwhile, he is also laid on his side on which he sleeps until he heals.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spondilium dorsi et colli.	On the restoration of a fracture of the vertebra of the back and neck.
Caput X.	Chapter X.
Ossibus quidem colli quandoque aduenit fractura, et raro accidit eis attritio: et similiter Spondilibus dorsi etiam.	Sometimes a fracture occurs in the bones of the neck, and rarely they are worn down: and similarly in the vertebrae of the back also.
Cum ergo accidit illud alicui, et uis scire, an sanetur, an non sanetur: tunc confidera.	When therefore this happens to someone, and you wish to know, whether he will be healed or not healed: then have confidence.
Nam si uides manus eius iam mollificatas, et stupefactas, et mortuas: et non potest mouere eas, neque extendere eas, neque constringere eas: et quando constringis eas cum digitis tuis, et pungis eas cum acu, non sentit illud, et non sentit in eis dolorem: tunc scias, quia non sanatur, et in pluribus dispositionibus est mortale.	If you see his hand already softened, and stunned, and dead: and he cannot move it, nor extend it, nor constrict it: and when you constrict it with your fingers, and prick it with a sharp point, he does not feel it, and does not feel pain in them: then know, that it is not healing, and in many dispositions it is mortal.
Quod si mouet eas, et sentit in eis constrictionem cum digitis et puncturam: tunc scias, quia nucha ossis salua est, et quod infirmus sanabitur cum curatione.	If he moves them and feels constriction with his fingers and a prick: then you shall know that the nape of the bone is safe, and that the patient will heal with treatment.
Quod si eueniat Spondilibus dorsi simile illius, et uis scire, an sanetur etiam, an non: tunc considera ad pedes eius: tunc si uides quod mollificati sunt, et accidit in eis illud quod accidit in manibus: deinde quando iacet super dorsum suum, egreditur uentositas et egestio absque uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super uentrem suum, egreditur egestio sine uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super dorsum suum, et uult mingere, et non potest: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	If it happens to the ribs of the back similar to this one, and you wish to know, whether it will be healed also, or not: then consider to the feet of him: then if you see that they are softened, and what happens in them happens in the hands: then when he lies on his back, windiness and defecation occur without his will: and when he rolls over onto his stomach, defecation occurs without his will: and when he rolls over onto his back, and wants to urinate, but cannot: then know, that it is mortal.
Non ergo labores in curatione eius.	Therefore, no labor should be taken in its treatment.
Si uero non accidit ei aliquid ex illo, res est leuior.	If however nothing of that sort happens to him, the matter is lighter.
Et curatio eius quod accidit ex illo est, ut coneris sedationem apostematis calidi: ita, ut ponas super Spondilem attritam oleum rosatum solum: aut cum uitellis oui assati.	And the cure of this which happens from it is, that you try the sedation of a hot abscess: so, that you place upon the rubbed spine oil of roses alone: or with heated asses' fat.
Pone super ipsam illud aliquotiens in die, donec quando sedatur apostema calidum: tum pone super locum unum ex emplastris confortantibus, exiccantibus, et stringe super ipsum cum ligamento: et praecipe infirmo, ut utatur quiete et tranquillitate.	Place upon it this several times a day until when the hot abscess settles down: then place upon the spot one of the strengthening, drying plasters, and bind over it with a bandage: and order the sick person to use rest and tranquility.
Nec dormiat super partem cum qua inuenit dolorem, donec sanetur.	He must not sleep upon the part where he found pain until it is healed.
Quod si accidit apud attritionem ossis sathaiatum, aut aliquid quod iam separatum fit ex eo: tunc oportet, ut seces super cutem, et auferas illud.	If it happens during bone scraping that something has been separated from the bone, then it is necessary to cut on the skin and remove it.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, si est magnum, cum sutura.	Then gather together the two lips of the wound, if it is large, with a suture.
Deinde cura ipsum cum aliquo incarnatiuo, ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with some ointment, until it is healed.
Si uero frangitur postremum ossis alhausos, et est finis caudae: tunc oportet, ut intromittas pollicem manus sinistrae in anum, et aeques os fractum manu altera, secundum quod possibile est, et secunda aequatione.	If the last bone of the spine is broken and it is the end of the tail: then it is necessary that you insert your thumb of the left hand into the anus, and with the other hand equalize the broken bone, as much as possible, and according to a second equation.
Deinde pone super ipsum, et aufer ipsum: et cura uulnus cum curatione quae praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then place over it and remove it: and take care of the wound with the same care as before, until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Anchae.	On the restoration of the Anus.
Caput XI.	Chapter XI.
Raro franguntur ossa Ancharum.	Bones of the Ancharum are rarely broken.
Quod si franguntur, tunc fractura eorum non est, nisi comminutio in extremitatibus ipsorum: et scinduntur in longitudine, et declinantur ad interiora: et accidit infirmo dolor in loco, et punctura: et stupescit crus quod frangitur.	If they are broken, then their fracture is not, unless a comminution at the extremities of them: and they are split lengthwise, and incline inwards: and there happens a feeble pain in the place, and puncture: and the leg that breaks becomes numb.
Et restauratio quidem eius est, ut extendas manum tuam super ipsum, donec stes super fracturam qualiter est figura eius.	And restoration of it is, that you extend your hand over it, until you stand over the fracture as to how its figure is.
Quod si fractura est in extremitatibus eius tantum, tunc aequa illam fracturam, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ex aequatione, donec assimiletur figurae suae naturali.	If the fracture is only in the extremities of it, then make that fracture equal, according to how it is prepared for you from the equation, until it assimilates to its natural figure.
Si autem fractura est in longitudine, aut iam declinat ad interiora: tunc fac iacere infirmum super uentrem suum, donec praeparetur tibi restauratio illius fracturae.	If, however, the fracture is in length, or already leans inward, then make the sick person lie on their belly until you prepare the restoration of that fracture.
Quando ergo aequaueris ipsam, pone super ipsam emplastrum: deinde pone super ipsam astellam ex ligno, aut ex cute: et stringe strictura super quam non timeas permutationem fracturae, neque remotionem astellae.	When therefore you have equalized it, place upon it a plaster; then place upon it a splint of wood, or of skin: and tighten the binding over which you do not fear the alteration of the fracture, nor the removal of the splint.
Et aequa concauitatem illorum cum eo quod impleat eam, donec capiat eam strictura secundum aequalitatem: et praecipe infirmo, ut dormiat super dorsum suum, aut super latus suum sanum.	And equal the concavity of them with that which fills it, until it takes it in stricture according to equality: and bid the sick man to lie upon his back, or upon his healthy side.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc cessa ab extensione eius, et ipsius restauratione, donec sedetur apostema calidum: et pone super ipsum quod sedet ipsum, secundum quod praecessit, deinde redi ad restaurationem eius: et stringe ipsum sicut oportet.	If a hot abscess occurs to him, then cease from extending and restoring it until the hot abscess sits; and place upon it what was previously said, then return to its restoration; and bind it as is fitting.
Si uero accidit in osse satagie, aut comminuitur, extrahe.	If a spear head has been lodged in bone, or if it is broken off, remove it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Adiutorii.	On the restoration of a fracture with aid.
Caput XII.	Chapter XII.
Adiutorium est illud, quod est inter cubitum usque ad caput Spatulae.	A helpful tool is that which is between the elbow and the head of a spatula.
Si ergo frangitur, tunc restauratio eius est secundum unum duorum modorum.	If therefore it is broken, then its restoration is according to one of two modes.
Quorum unus est: ut accipias lignum planum mediae grossitudinis, secundum hanc formam, quae sequitur.	One of these is: that you take a flat piece of wood of medium thickness, according to this shape which follows.
Et ligentur in duabus extremitatibus duo ligamenta.	And two ligaments shall be tied at both extremities.
Deinde suspendatur ex loco eleuato: et sedeat infirmus super sedem.	Then it shall be suspended from the elevated place: and let the sick person sit upon the seat.
Deinde proiiciat brachium suum fractum super lignum, donec perueniat ad titillicum eius, in cuius medio sit annexa curuitas ligni.	Then he should place his broken arm on a piece of wood until it reaches the middle of its groove, where the curvature of the wood is situated.
Deinde suspende desuper ipsum aliquid graue, ut extendat ipsum minister ad inferiora.	Then suspend something heavy from above so that it extends the instrument downwards.
Deinde aequet medicus fracturam manibus suis simul, donec redeat fractura, secundum quod oportet.	Then the doctor sets the fracture with his hands until the fracture returns, as it should.
Et modus alter est, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et suspende manum eius a collo ipsius cum ligamento.	And another way is, that the sick person be laid upon his neck and one of his hands be suspended from his neck with a bandage.
Deinde praecipe duobus ministris, ut teneat unus eorum illud quod est supra fracturam cum manibus suis: et ut alter teneat inferius eius, et extendat unusquisque eorum ad partem suam.	Then direct two assistants to hold one of them above the fracture with their hands; and let the other hold below it, and each extend it to his part.
Et si uis, ut sit extensio fortior, tunc stringe sub fractura cum ligamento, et supra ipsam cum ligamento alio: et extendat ea unusquisque duorum ministrorum ad duas partes suas.	And if you wish, that it may be a stronger extension, then bind under the fracture with one ligament, and above it with another ligament: and let each of the two attendants extend to their own parts.
Si ergo fractura est propinqua extremitati humeri, tunc oportet, ut ponatur unum ligamentum sub titillico, et alterum sub fractura uersus cubitum.	If therefore the fracture is near the extremity of the shoulder, then it is necessary that one ligament be placed under the skin and another under the fracture towards the elbow.
Et similiter si fractura est propinqua cubito: tunc oportet, ut ponatur ligamentum super illum locum, et super cubitum ipsum.	And similarly if the fracture is near the elbow: then it is necessary that a bandage be placed over that place, and over the elbow itself.
Deinde aequa fracturam cum facilitate absque labore, donec quando aequatur fractura secundum quod oportet, et applicatur applicatione bona: tunc stringe eam, si non accidit apostema calidum.	Then, with ease and without labor, make the fracture even, until the fracture is made even as it should be, and apply a good application: then bind it, if a hot abscess does not occur.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam usque ad diem septimum.	If however a hot abscess occurs, then let the constriction be released until the seventh day.
Et pone super ipsum lanam succidam imbibitam in aceto et oleo rosato, donec quando quiescit apostema: tunc stringe eam: et modus stringendi eam est, ut ponas emplastrum super fracturam.	And place on it a cloth soaked in vinegar and rose oil, until when the abscess quiets: then bind it: and the way of binding it is, as you would place a plaster over the fracture.
Deinde pone inuolutionem ex panno nouo super emplastrum.	Then place a wrapping from new cloth over the plaster.
Deinde aggreget brachium super adiutorium ipsum, et ponat manum suam apertam super humerum suum.	Then he brings together the arm over his helper, and places his hand open over his shoulder.
Et pone pannum, et stringe super adiutorium brachium, ut brachium stet loco astellarum: si non prohibet te ab illo aliquid, neque alteretur super te aliquid ex osse fracto.	And place a cloth, and bind over the auxiliary arm, that the arm may stand in the place of the stars; if nothing prevents you from this, nor is anything changed upon you from the broken bone.
Quod si times, quod alteretur super te ex osse fracto aliquid, tunc utere astellis: et est, ut ponas super fracturam ipsam astellam quae sit latior et fortior reliquis astellis.	If you fear that something might be altered over you from a broken bone, then use splints: and it is, that you place over the fracture itself a splint which is wider and stronger than the other splints.
Et ponas inter omnem astellam latitudinem digiti: et sit longitudo astellarum secundum fracturam cum additione trium digitorum ab omni parte.	And place between each splint the width of a finger: and let the length of the splints be according to the fracture with the addition of three fingers from every part.
Deinde stringe super astellas strictura quam dixi in principio capituli.	Then tighten the constriction above the stars as I said at the beginning of the chapter.
Et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae strictior.	And it is that your stricture be above the place of fracture stricter.
Et quanto plus elongatur fractura, sit strictura minor.	And the more elongated the fracture, let the constriction be less.
Si ergo uides situm astellarum et stricturam, sicut diximus, in hora qua restauras membrum statim, tunc fac: et si times apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam et astellas usque ad diem septimum, sicut diximus.	If therefore you see the situation of the stars and constriction, as we have said, in the hour when you restore the limb immediately do this: and if you fear a hot abscess, then dismiss the constriction and the stars until the seventh day, as we have said.
Deinde considera ligamentum in omnibus tribus diebus, ut non accidat in loco pruritus, aut inflatio, aut prohibeatur cibus peruenire ad membrum, propter dispositionem superfluitatis stricturae.	Then consider the ligament for all three days, so that itching or swelling does not occur in the place, nor is food prevented from reaching the limb, because of the arrangement of the surplus stricture.
Rectifica ergo illud totum, secundum quod diximus.	Therefore, rectify that whole thing, as we have said.
Si uero es super fiduciam, ut non accidat ex illo aliquid: tunc non soluas ligamentum, nisi post tres dies, aut plus.	If you are over confident that nothing will come from it: then do not loosen the ligament, except after three days, or more.
Et sit dormitio infirmi super dorsum suum, et manus eius super stomachum suum: et pone sub adiutorio culcitram plenam lana aequaliter.	And let the patient's sleep be on his back, and his hands over his stomach: and place under his armpit a cushion full of wool equally.
Et considera in omni hora noctis, aut diei, ut non soluatur figura membri fracta, aut mollificetur ligamentum.	And consider at every hour of night or day that the figure of a broken limb not be loosened, nor the ligament softened.
Rectifica ergo illud totum uirtute tua.	Therefore rectify that altogether with your skill.
Et pone cibum infirmi secundum ordinem quem praemisimus, ita ut sit cibus subtilis in primis, donec incipiat os stringi: tunc oportet, ut ingrosses cibum eius.	And give food to the sick according to the order which we have previously stated, so that it be fine food at first, until he begins to clench his jaw; then it is necessary that you make his food coarser.
De consuetudine enim adiutorii et cruris est, ut stringatur in quadraginta diebus: tunc ergo oportet, ut soluatur, et administretur balneum, et medicetur cum unguentis quae rectificant illud.	It is customary for the aid and leg to be bound for forty days; therefore, it should be loosened and a bath given, and it should be medicated with ointments that correct it.
Quod si fractura fuerit foeda, attrita: tunc non soluas ab ea ligamentum et astellas usque ad quinquaginta dies, et usque ad duos menses.	If the fracture be foul, rubbed; then thou shalt not loose from it the ligament and splints up to fifty days, and up to two months.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Brachii.	On the restoration of a broken arm.
Caput XIII.	Chapter XIII.
Brachium est compositum ex duobus ossibus, quae nominantur duo focilia.	The arm is composed of two bones, which are called the two ulnae.
Quorum unum est paruum: et est illud quod sequitur pollicem.	One of these is small: and that which follows the thumb.
Et alterum est magnum, et est illud quod est positum sub paruo ab inferiori parte.	And another is large, and it is that which is placed below the small one from the lower part.
Fortasse ergo frangitur focile maius solum, aut paruum: et fortasse franguntur simul.	Perhaps therefore the greater bone is broken alone, or a little. And perhaps both are broken together.
Quando ergo frangitur focile paruum superius, tunc restauratio eius est facilis, et sanatio eius est facilior.	When therefore a small upper bone is broken, then its restoration is easy, and its healing is easier.
Et quando frangitur focile inferius, est fractura eius mala, et sanatio eius difficilis.	And when the lower leg bone is broken, it is a bad fracture, and its healing is difficult.
Et deterior ea est, quando franguntur duo ossa simul.	And it is worse when two bones are broken at the same time.
Si ergo os quod frangitur est focile parum superius, tunc conuenit medico apud restaurationem eius, ut ponat extensionem paruam cum facilitate, donec aequet ipsum.	If therefore the bone that is broken is a little above the socket, then it behooves the physician when restoring it, to put a small extension with facility, until he equalizes it.
Si uero focile magnum est illud quod fractum est: tunc oportet, ut ponat stricturam fortiorem ualde.	If however a large bone is that which is broken: then it is necessary that a stronger bandage be placed.
Et oportet, ut ponat figuram manus apud restaurationem eius, et ipsius extensionem extensam super puluinar.	And it is necessary that he place the figure of the hand at its restoration and the extension of it extended over the pillow.
Et sit pollex manus ad superiora altior omnibus digitis: et sit articularis inferior omnibus digitis, uel reliquis: et infirmus sedens quadratus super seipsum, et sit puluinar coram eo, uel in directo eius, in altitudine, ut non incurrat infirmus laborem.	And let the thumb of the hand be higher than all the fingers above, and let its lower joint be higher than all the fingers, or the rest: and let the weak one sitting square on itself, and let it be placed in front of the pulley or directly in its height, so that the weak one does not incur labor.
Deinde extendat minister Brachium ab inferiori parte, aut manu sua, aut cum ligamento.	Then let the assistant extend the arm from the lower part, either with his hand or with a band.
Et minister alius extendat desuper similiter.	And another assistant shall extend from above similarly.
Deinde aequet medicus os, donec reducat ipsum secundum meliorem figuram quam potest.	Then the physician straightens the bone until he brings it back to the best possible shape.
Quod si in fractura ossis sunt satagiae, tunc conare reducere omne frustum in loco suo uirtute tua.	If there are splinters in a bone fracture, then try to return every fragment to its place with your skill.
Si uero apparet in eo sathaiatum separatum, et pungit cutem, et non est tibi spes in restauratione eius: tunc finde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum secundum modum quem diximus in eis quae praemissa sunt.	If, however, a separated wound appears, and it penetrates the skin, and you have no hope of restoration of it: then find upon it, and remove it according to the manner which we said in those things which precede.
Si autem fractura est cum uulnere, ego iam feci ad illud capitulum singulare, ergo accipe curationem illius inde.	If however the fracture is with a wound, I have already made for that a separate chapter, therefore receive the cure from there.
Quod si accidat in principio tuae restaurationis apostema calidum, tunc line pannum cum caeroto facto ex oleo rosato, et caera alba, et sit medium inter spissitudinem et subtilitatem: et stringe pannum super ipsum strictura subtili, donec quando sedatur apostema: tunc remoue caerotum, et pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum albumine oui.	If it happens at the beginning of your restoration that a hot abscess occurs, then take cloth with a lint made from rose oil and white wax, and let it be medium between thickness and fineness: and bind the cloth over it with a fine bandage until when the abscess is calmed; then remove the lint, and put on a plaster prepared from ground powder with egg white.
Deinde pone astellas, et sit astella quae ponitur super fracturam ipsam latior parumper, et fortior.	Then place splints, and let the splint that is placed over the fracture itself be a little wider, and stronger.
Et scias, quod numerus astellarum Brachii est sex in pluribus dispositionibus: siue sit fractura in focili uno, aut in duobus focilibus simul.	And know that the number of stars of the arm is six in various arrangements: whether it is a fracture in one follis, or in two foci simultaneously.
Deinde pone stricturam tuam super locum fracturae fortiorem et uehementiorem, et aliquanto plus cum strictura ad superiora fracturae, aut ad inferiora eius: aut pone stricturam molliorem strictura eius parumper, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius in principio capituli.	Then place your splint over the fracture site firmer and more rigid, and a little bit more with the splint to the upper part of the fracture, or to the lower part of it: or place a softer splint its width a little, according to what was said before at the beginning of the chapter.
Et sint panni qui inuoluuntur super fracturam, panni lenes, humidi: et non sint duri, asperi.	And let there be cloths which are wrapped over the fracture, soft cloths, moist; and let them not be hard, rough.
Et sit filum quo stringitur ex lino proprie, medium inter subtile et grossum, sicut narrauimus.	And let the thread used for tightening be made of linen properly, medium between fine and coarse, as we have narrated.
Et considera membrum et ligamentum post dies.	And consider the limb and ligament after days.
Quod si accidat aliquid cuius rectificatio sit necessaria, sicut pruritus qui accidit membro: tunc oportet, ut embroces membrum cum aqua calefacta, donec quiescat ille pruritus, et dimittas membrum non constrictum, donec quiescat, deinde itera stricturam.	If something happens which requires correction, such as an itch that occurs in a limb: then it is necessary to embrocate the limb with hot water until the itch subsides, and release the limb without constriction until it subsides, then repeat the constriction.
Quod si strictura iam mollificata est, et os iam remotum, et similia illis: tunc rectifica illud totum uirtute tua, et considera iterum.	If the constriction has already been softened and the bone removed, and similar things to these: then rectify it all with your skill, and consider it again.
Nam si nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad membrum, propter superfluitatem stricturae, tunc oportet, ut mollifices ipsum parumper, et dimittas ipsum aliquot diebus, donec currat ad ipsum nutrimentum, deinde stringe ipsum.	If food is prevented from reaching a limb because of the excess tightness of a constriction, then it is necessary that you soften it a little and loosen it for a few days until nourishment reaches it, then tighten it again.
Si autem non accidit infirmo aliquid eorum quae diximus, tunc non oportet, ut soluatur, nisi post uiginti dies, aut circiter hos.	If, however, nothing of those things which we have said happens to the sick person, then it is not necessary for him to be released, unless after twenty days, or thereabouts.
Deinde suspendatur manus infirmi ad collum eius.	Then the hand of the infirm person shall be suspended to their neck.
Et sit collum eius aequale, et custodiatur uirtute sua a motibus agitatiuis.	And let its neck be equal, and guarded by its virtue from agitated movements.
Et fac eum dormire super dorsum suum.	And make him lie on his back.
Et scias, quod haec fractura in triginta diebus, aut in triginta duobus diebus restauratur: et fortasse restauratur in uigintiocto diebus.	And know that this fracture is restored in thirty days, or in thirty-two days: and perhaps it is restored in twenty-eight days.
Totum illud est secundum dispositiones complexionum, et dispositiones uirtutis.	The whole thing is according to the dispositions of temperaments, and dispositions of virtue.
¶ De restauratione fracturarum Manus.	On the restoration of broken hands.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter XIV.
Scias, quod pectini Manus, et nodis digitorum raro accidit fractura.	Know that fractures of the hands and finger joints are rare.
Et non accidit ei, nisi attritio multotiens.	And this does not happen to it unless rubbed many times.
Quando ergo accidit plantae fractura, aut attritio: tunc oportet, ut sedeat infirmus quadratus: et coram eo sit sedes secundum aequalitatem.	When therefore a fracture or abrasion of the foot occurs, then it is necessary that the sick person sits square and before him there be a seat according to equality.
Deinde pone Manum eius super eam extensam.	Then place his hand over it extended.
Deinde extendat minister ossa fracta, et aequet ea medicus, donec quando coniunguntur coniunctione bona.	Then the attendant shall stretch out the broken bones, and the physician shall align them until they join together with a good connection.
Tunc oportet, ut ponat emplastrum et stuppam, si non accidat apostema calidum.	Then it is necessary that he put on a plaster and a plug, if a hot abscess does not occur.
Deinde pone astellam desuper secundum quantitatem loci: et tu iam inuoluisti eam in panno lini.	Then put the splint on top according to the quantity of the place: and you have now wrapped it in linen cloth.
Si autem fractura est ad inferiora circiter uentrem plantae, tunc fac simile spherae ex panno: et praecipe infirmo, ut coartet super eam cum planta sua fracta: deinde stringatur cum panno longo.	If the fracture is about the lower part of the belly of the foot, then make a sphere like thing out of cloth; and command the sick person to bind over it with his broken foot; then bind with a long cloth.
Et sit astella ex corio, in quo sit lenitas, ut applicetur corium cum corpore plantae: et stringe eam, secundum quod oportet.	And let a star be made from leather, with softness so that it may be applied to the flesh of the foot; and bind it as needed.
Si autem fractura est ad exteriora, tunc oportet: ut ponas astellam desuper, et astellam aliam ab inferiori in planta: et sit manus aperta recta.	If, however, the fracture is to the outside, then it is necessary: that you place a splint on top, and another splint from below in the sole: and let the hand be open straight.
Deinde pone stricturam, sicut reuoluitur manus: et extende inter digitos cum ligamento.	Then place a constriction, as the hand is turned; and extend between the fingers with a bandage.
Quod si accidat fractura alicui nodorum digitorum, tunc si est pollex, aequetur secundum quod oportet.	If a fracture should happen to any of the joints of the fingers, then if it is the thumb, it must be set according to what is proper.
Deinde stringatur cum planta: et si amas, pone ei astellam rectam, paruam: ut eleuetur fractura, et non moueatur.	Then tie it with a bandage: and if you wish, place a straight splint, small: so that the fracture may be elevated and not moved.
Si autem fractura est reliquis digitis, sicut medio, et indici, aut auriculari, et anulari, tunc aequetur, et ligetur cum digito sano qui sequitur eum: aut ligentur omnes secundum continuationem: et est melius.	If the fracture is in the remaining fingers, such as the middle, and index, or little, and ring finger, then it is to be straightened, and bandaged with the healthy finger that follows it: or all are to be bandaged according to the continuation: and this is better.
Aut pone super ipsum astellam paruam, sicut diximus in pollice.	Or place upon it a small splint, as we said in the thumb.
Et considera in restauratione tua, et post ipsam dispositionem apostematis calidi: et oppone cum eo quod oportet, quando accidit aliquid ex illo, secundum quod iteratur eius narratio.	And consider in your restoration, and after the very arrangement of the hot abscess: and oppose with it what is necessary, when something happens from it, according to how its narration recurs.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Coxae.	On the restoration of a fractured hip.
Caput XV.	Chapter XV.
OS Coxae multotiens frangitur, et declaratur sensui: quoniam conuertitur ad interiorem et posteriorem partem.	The hip bone is broken many times, and it is declared to the senses because it turns to the inner and outer part.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, quod stringitur ligamentum supra fracturam, et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	And the restoration of it is done so that one ligament is tightened above the fracture, and another ligament below the fracture.
Et infirmus prostretur super faciem suam.	And the sick person shall lie upon his face.
Deinde extendat omne ligamentum minister ad partem suam secundum aequalitatem: et hoc, quando est fractura in medio ossis.	Then he will extend every ligament of the limb to its own part according to equality: and this, when there is a fracture in the middle of the bone.
Si autem est fractura propinqua radici Coxae, tunc sit ligamentum ad partem pectinis, ut cadat extensio ad sursum: et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	If, however, there is a fracture near the root of the hip, then one ligament should be to the side of the crest, so that its extension goes upward; and another ligament below the fracture.
Et sic similiter si est fractura propinqua genu, tunc sit ligamentum propinquum genu, ut sit extensio ad inferiora.	And so similarly if there is a fracture near the knee, then let the ligament near the knee be, so that it extends to the lower part.
Deinde aequet medicus os utriusque manibus suis, donec reducat ipsum secundum similitudinem figurae naturalis: et coniugatur os coniunctione bona.	Then the physician straightens the bone with both of his hands, until he reduces it according to the likeness of its natural shape: and the bone is joined together with a good joining.
Tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum et stricturam, si non accidit membro apostema.	Then it is necessary that you place a plaster and a constriction, if an abscess does not occur in the member.
Quod si accidat in eo apostema: tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur apostema calidum, deinde redi ad curationem tuam.	If it happens that an abscess occurs there, then dismiss it for some days, until the abscess sits hot, then return to your treatment.
Strictura autem eius ita sit.	Its stricture should be so.
Oportet ut inuoluas super fracturam imema duram, id est, bindam: et dupla eam bis, aut ter: et remaneat ex ea superfluitas.	It is necessary that you envelop over the fracture a hard cloth, that is, a bandage: and double it twice, or thrice: and let there remain from it an excess.
Deinde inuolue crus, donec perueniat calcaneus apud radicem natis.	Then wrap the leg, until you reach the heel at the root of the thigh.
Et intromitte filum longum inter Coxam et crus prope genu ad inferiora, et ueniant extremitates fili a superiori parte duarum partium.	And introduce a long thread between the hip and leg near the knee to the lower part, and let the ends of the thread come from the upper part of the two parts.
Deinde reuolue super Crus et Coxam quod superfluit ex alimema.	Then roll over onto the thigh and hip what is superfluous from the alimentary canal.
Deinde pone super Coxam in loco fracturae ipsius astellas, et pone ex eis astellam unam super os cruris.	Then place upon the hip at the site of the fracture one splint, and place from them one splint over the bone of the leg.
Deinde imple uacuitates inter crus et coxam cum pannis lenibus, ut aequetur strictura.	Then fill the spaces between the leg and hip with soft cloths, so that the constriction is even.
Deinde incipe cum strictura forti a medio super locum fracturae tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor.	Then begin with a firm bandage from the middle of the fracture site, for three or four turns.
Et quanto plus elongaris cum ligamento a loco fracturae, sit strictura tua minor et mollior, et lenior.	And the more elongated with the ligament from the place of the fracture, your constriction will be less and softer, and milder.
Deinde intende ad duas extremitates fili, quod tu intromisisti inter coxam et crus.	Then attend to the two extremities of the thread which you inserted between the hip and the leg.
Liga ergo cum utrisque tres astellas quae sunt desuper.	Therefore bind with both three stars which are above.
Deinde uade cum duabus extremitatibus fili ad inferiora, donec peruenias ad cauillam pedis.	Then go with two ends of a thread downward until you reach the heel bone.
Et cum utrisque stringe etiam extremitates astellarum a parte altera: ut non remoueatur ligamentum ex loco suo.	And when both are tightened, also tighten the extremities of the stars from the other side: so that the ligament is not removed from its place.
Deinde dimitte stricturam super illud, dum permanet, ita quod non accidat membro corrosio, neque apostema, neque inflatio, et similia eis.	Then release the stricture over it while it remains, so that it does not happen to the member that it be corroded or have an abscess or inflation and similar things.
Quod si accidat aliquid ex illo.	If something should happen from that.
Propera ergo cum solutione eius, et rectifica illud quod accidit inde totum, secundum quod diximus multotiens.	Therefore, it is proper with its resolution, and correct that which happened from it entirely, according to what we have said many times.
Si uero in osse est frustum ex osse quod pungat: tunc oportet, ut aeques illud, si est tibi possibile.	If there is a piece of bone in the bone that pierces: then it is necessary, that you make it equal, if it is possible for you.
Et si non, finde super illud, et remoue illud: et cura cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio, donec sanetur.	And if not, then find above it and move it: and take care with it whose predecessor was remembered until it heals.
Et quandoque stringitur haec fractura Coxae, praeter quod addantur ei astellae, sicut diximus in adiutorio et brachio.	And sometimes this fracture of the hip is tightened, besides which stars are added to it, as we said in the auxiliary and arm.
Verumtamen in restauratione eius taliter fracta, non accidit infirmo claudicatio.	Nevertheless, in the restoration of it thus broken, lameness does not occur in the infirm person.
Et si restauratur sola, praeter quod applicetur ei crus alterum, tunc necesse est, ut claudicet ille cuius est, semper.	And if only one [leg] is restored, besides that a second leg is applied to it, then it will be necessary for the one who belongs to it to limp forever.
Et scias, quod Coxa stringitur in quinquaginta diebus, uel additur parum, aut minuitur parum: totum illud est secundum diuersitatem complexionum, et reliquarum dispositionum.	And know that the hip is strapped for fifty days, or a little is added, or a little is taken away: all of it is according to the diversity of complexions, and the rest of the arrangements.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Rotulae genu.	On the restoration of a broken knee cap.
Caput XVI.	Chapter XVI.
Scias, quod Rotulae genu raro accidit fractura, sed accidit ei attritio multotiens.	Know that a fracture of the kneecap is rare, but attrition happens to it very often.
Si uero accidit ei fractura, tunc non nisi aut fissura, aut foramen in partibus suis.	If, however, a fracture occurs, then only a fissure or a hole in its parts.
Et est illud cum uulnere, et absque uulnere.	And it is with a wound, and without a wound.
Et statur super illud totum cum sensu.	And a sense is placed upon it altogether.
Et restauratio eius est ita, ut aequetur quod disruptum est ex partibus eius cum digitis, donec aggregetur, et coniungatur secundum quod possibile est ex aequatione et facilitate, et fabricatione.	And its restoration is such that it be made equal to what was broken from its parts with fingers, until it is gathered together, and joined according to what is possible from equality and facility, and fabrication.
Deinde pone emplastrum ex farina sisami, uel molendini, cum albumine oui: et pone super ipsum astellam rotundam, si indiges illa: et stringe desuper strictura conueniente ad illud.	Then place a plaster made from sesame flour or millet with egg white; and place on top of it a round pad, if you deem it necessary; and bind tightly over it with a suitable bandage.
Deinde considera omnes dispositiones quas narrauimus in reliquis fracturis: sicut apostema calidum, et similia illi: ita, ut opponas omni accidenti cum eo quod conuenit ei, donec sanetur.	Then consider all the arrangements that we have described in other fractures: such as a hot abscess, and things similar to it: so that you may oppose every accident to what is suitable for it, until it heals.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Cruris.	On the restoration of a broken leg.
Caput XVII.	Chapter XVII.
Scias, quod Cruri sunt duo ossa, quorum unum est grossum, et nominatur nomine Cruris: et alterum subtile, et nominatur Focile.	Know that there are two bones in the leg, one of which is large and is called the Femur; and the other is fine, and is called the Fibula.
Et accidit utrisque ex speciebus fracturae quod accidit duobus ossibus brachii: et propter illud fit restauratio eius, sicut restauratio brachii aequaliter, et operatio est una.	And it happens with both kinds of fractures that happen to the two bones of the arm: and for this reason its restoration is done, just as the restoration of the arm equally, and the operation is one.
Quod si franguntur duo ossa simul, conuertitur Crus ad omnes partes.	If two bones are broken at the same time, the leg turns to all parts.
Et si frangitur os subtilius, conuertitur Crus ad anteriorem partem.	And if a bone is broken more finely, the shinbone turns towards the anterior part.
Et si frangitur os grossius, inuenis illud inferius: et est ex eis quae non occultantur tibi.	And if a thicker bone is broken, find its lower part: and it is of those which are not concealed from you.
Deinde administra extensionem, et aequationem, et ligationem astellarum secundum illud aequaliter.	Then administer extension and equalization and binding of the stars according to that equally.
Verumtamen oportet, si fractura Cruris est fractura foeda, habens sethagie multa: ut sit extensio minor, et lenior alleuiatione tua.	Nevertheless, if a fracture of the thigh is a foul fracture, having many fragments, so that it may be less extension and milder alleviation yours.
Et in Crure quidem est ex operatione quiddam super brachium: et est, ut quando tu aequas astellas, et comples omnem operationem tuam, tunc accipe duas fascias ex ligno pini, quod administratur in fabricatione solariorum quod ponitur sub tabulis: et fiunt ex spatulis palmae: et elige ex eis quibus est grossitudo parua, et neque sint ex minutis: et sit longitudo earum secundum longitudinem Cruris a genu usque inferius.	And in the leg, indeed, there is something from the operation on the arm: and it is, as when you equal the stars, and complete all your operation, then receive two fascias of pine wood, which is administered in the making of solar panels that are placed under tables: and they are made of palm spatulas: and choose from them those which have a small thickness, and not be from the small ones: and let their length be according to the length of the leg from the knee down.
Deinde inuolue super unamquamque pannum duabus inuolutionibus secundum longitudinem eius.	Then wrap over each piece of cloth two wrappings according to its length.
Et pone unam partem Cruris a parte una, et alteram a parte altera: et sint ex genu usque inferius pedis.	And place one part of the thigh from one side, and the other from the other side: and let them be from the knee down to the foot.
Deinde liga duas fascias in tribus locis ex duabus extremitatibus et medio.	Then bind two fasciae in three places from the two extremities and the middle.
Cum enim strictura prohibetur, Crus declinat ad dextram et sinistram, et stat statione bona.	When therefore a stricture is prohibited, the leg leans to the right and left, and stands in a good position.
Et iam quidem administretur cunabulum ex ligno secundum longitudinem Cruris, et ponatur in eo Crus, ut conseruet ipsum a motu.	And now indeed let a bedstead be administered out of wood according to the length of the leg, and let it be placed upon it the leg, so that it may conserve it from motion.
Et plurimum quidem oportet, ut facias illud in fractura quando cum ea est uulnus proprie.	And most of all, it is necessary that you do this in a fracture when there is a wound along with it properly.
Deinde considera Crus in omni die, et stude cum eo studio ultimo ab apostemate, aut inflatione, aut reliquis aliis.	Then consider the leg every day, and study it with the utmost diligence from abscess, or inflammation, or other ailments.
Si ergo accidit aliquid ex illis, tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur, si Deus uoluerit.	If therefore anything of these things happens, then oppose it with that which is necessary, until it is healed, if God will.
De fractura ossium Pedis, et Digitorum.	On the fracture of bones of the foot and fingers.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter XVIII.
Calcaneo quidem non accidit fractura penitus.	A fracture of the heel bone does not occur completely.
Ossibus uero Pedis accidit quandoque fractura, et Digitis parum etiam accidit fractura: et non accidit eis nisi attritio in pluribus dispositionibus.	Sometimes a fracture occurs in the bones of the foot, and sometimes in the fingers. And it does not occur to them except from attrition in many positions.
Quod si accidit ossibus Pedis fractura, et uides illa ossa sublimari super se adinuicem, tunc ponat infirmus Pedem suum super terram praeparatam, sicut ambulans.	If a fracture of the bones of the foot occurs and you see those bones being raised above each other, then place the sick man’s foot on the prepared ground, as if walking.
Deinde sta tu, et pone Pedem tuum super illud quod eleuatur ex illis ossibus: postea preme, uel calca eam: et aequa ipsam, donec redeat in locis suis.	Then stand, and put your foot upon that which elevates from those bones: afterward press, or tread on it: and make it even, until it returns to its place.
Deinde pone emplastrum, et stuppam desuper: et pone sub uentre Pedis tabulam paruam, cui sint duo capita plana.	Then place a plaster, and above it a stuffing: and under the sole of the foot put a small board, which has two flat ends.
Deinde stringe eam cum Pede strictura decenti, postquam tu inuoluis eam cum pannis, et reliquis quibus indiget.	Then bind it with a foot bandage of decent size, after you have wrapped it with cloths and whatever else it needs.
Cum ergo praetereunt ei tres dies, aut quatuor, tunc solue ligamentum.	When therefore three or four days have passed, then untie the ligament.
Nam tu inuenies ossa aequata, siue sint fracta, aut sint dislocata.	For you will find bones, whether they are equal or broken, or displaced.
Operatio ergo in eis est, sicut uides.	The operation therefore is, as you see.
Si autem franguntur aliqui digiti, tunc restaura eos, et aequa ipsos secundum quod narraui tibi in restauratione digitorum manus.	If some fingers are broken, then restore them and make them equal according to what I have told you in the restoration of the fingers of the hand.
Deinde pone digito tuo astellam secundum longitudinem digiti, et sit latior eo parumper: deinde pone sub Pede hanc tabulam quam narraui tibi, et stringe eam strictura decenti.	Then place your finger as a splint according to the length of your finger, and let it be slightly wider than that; then put under the foot this table which I have told you about, and tighten it with a decent constriction.
Si uero quod frangitur ex ossibus est duo, aut tria, aut plus, tunc pone super omnem digitum astellam suae quantitatis, inuolutam in panno lini: et stringe tabulam in inferiori Pedis: et sit stans super unum capitum tabulae extra uentrem Pedis, ut teneat retentione bona.	If what is broken from the bones is two or three or more, then place on top of every finger an asterisk of its own quantity, wrapped in a linen cloth: and bind the tablet to the lower foot: and let it stand on one head of the tablet outside the belly of the foot, so that it may hold good retention.
Et conuenit tibi, ut non obliuiscaris, quin consideres omnia quae dixi tibi in reliquis fracturis ex accidentibus quae diximus: et oppone omni accidenti cum eo quod oportet.	And it is fitting for you, that you do not forget, but that you consider all things which I have said to you about the remaining fractures from accidents which we have spoken of; and oppose every accident with that which is proper.
¶ De fractura Vuluae mulieris, et ossis pectinis, et uirgae uiri.	Concerning the fracture of a woman's vulva, and the bone of the breast, and the male groin.
Caput XIX.	Chapter XIX.
Quando frangitur Vulua mulieris, tunc fac eam sedere quadratam.	When the vulva of a woman is broken, then make her sit square.
Deinde inclina eam ad partem dorsi ipsius parumper, et teneatur retro.	Then incline it to the part of his back for a short time, and hold it back.
Deinde impleat obstetrix Vuluam eius coto, donec impleat eam: et fiat in Vulua ex eo sicut sphera.	Then let the midwife fill the womb with cot until it is filled, and let a sphere be made in the womb from it.
Deinde concutiatur mulier, et eleua dorsum eius paulatim.	Then a woman shall be struck, and her back shall be raised gradually.
Illud enim cotum egreditur, donec fiat ante portam Vuluae sicut sphera, et os fractum redit.	It does indeed come out until it is made before the gate of the vagina like a sphere, and the broken bone returns.
Deinde pone puluillum super dorsum eius.	Then put a little something on his back.
Quando ergo uult mingere, remoueat cotum cum facilitate, deinde mingat: et reduc ipsum secundum modum, quo intromisisti ipsum in primis: deinde redeat ad puluillum suum primum.	When therefore he wants to urinate, he should remove the cloth with ease, then urinate: and reduce it back according to the way you inserted it in the first place, then return to his original position.
Faciat illud septem diebus, aut circiter, os ipsum enim restauratur.	Let him do this for seven days, or thereabouts, for the bone itself is restored.
Et si uis, accipe uesicam ouis, et stringe super foramen eius cannulam arundinis, et intromitte uesicam totam in Vuluam eius.	And if you wish, take a sheep’s bladder and place over its opening a reed pipe, and insert the whole bladder into its vulva.
Deinde suffla in cannulam cum uirtute, donec infletur uesica intra Vuluam, fractura enim redit.	Then blow into the tube with force until the bladder inside the Vulva is inflated, for the fracture returns.
Deinde impleatur cum coto, et stet aliquot diebus, secundum quod narrauimus, donec sanetur.	Then it should be filled with dung, and stand for several days, according to what we have said, until it heals.
Et quando frangitur os Pectinis uiri, aut mulieris, tunc administra in restauratione eius, et ipsius aequatione illud quod narrauimus in osse Anchae.	And when the bone of the breast of a man or woman is broken, then administer in its restoration and its equating that which we have narrated about the bone of the hip.
Et non occultatur rectum in his fracturis propinquis, quae parum contingunt, praecipue cui est quiddam studii, uel usus.	And the rectum is not hidden in these nearby fractures, which occur infrequently, especially to someone who has some study or use of it.
Et intellige librum meum istum multum, quoniam fractura ipsa significat tibi in pluribus dispositionibus uiam rectam in restauratione sui, et strictura sui: intellige ergo.	And understand this book of mine greatly, because the fracture itself signifies to you in many dispositions the straight way in the restoration of itself, and its constriction: therefore understand.
In Virga autem uiri quando frangitur, accipe guttur anseris: et intromitte uirgam in ipso.	When a man's phallus breaks, take a goose neck: and insert the rod into it.
Deinde pone super ipsum inuolutionem ex panno, et inuoluatur, et dimittatur tribus diebus, aut circiter eos, et sanabitur, si Deus uoluerit.	Then place over it a bandage of cloth, and wrap it up, and dismiss him for three days, or thereabouts, and he will heal, if God wills.
¶ De restauratione fracturae ossium, quando est cum uulnere.	On the restoration of a bone fracture when it is accompanied by a wound.
Caput XX.	Chapter XX.
Conuenit ei cui accidit fractura cum uulnere, praecipue si est magnum, sicut os coxae, aut adiutorii, aut simile illi, ut properes, et phlebotomes ipsum statim: si attestantur tibi conditiones phlebotomiae, sicut praemisimus.	It is necessary for one who has a fracture with a wound, especially if it is large, such as of the hip bone or of the arm, or similar to that, that he hasten and perform a phlebotomy immediately on him; if the conditions for phlebotomy are present, as we have previously stated.
Quod si uulnus effluit sanguinem, tunc oportet, ut properes ad abscisionem eius, ita ut puluerizes super ipsum zegi tritum: si non est tibi praesens aliud.	If a wound is bleeding, then you must hasten to its division so that powder made from it, ground over it, if nothing else is at hand.
Deinde incipe restaurare fracturam in illo eodem die: et non postponas illud, si non accidit apostema.	Then begin to restore the fracture on that very day, and do not postpone it, unless an abscess occurs.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte restaurationem eius usque ad diem nonum, donec sedetur apostema.	If a hot abscess occurs, then let the restoration of it be postponed until the ninth day, until the abscess settles.
Et non appropinques ei in die tertio, et quarto omnino, nam tu faceres ei accidere accidentia mala.	And do not approach him on the third day, and on the fourth entirely, for you would cause him to happen misfortunes.
Si autem os fractum est eminens super cutem detectum: tunc oportet, ut coneris reducere ipsum, et aequare ipsum manibus tuis cum facilitate et extensione parua.	If however a broken bone is protruding above the skin and exposed: then it is necessary that you try to reduce it, and make it level with your hands with ease and small extension.
Si autem non praeparatur extensio eius, et ipsius aequatio manibus tuis: tunc reduc ipsum cum isto instrumento.	If, however, it is not prepared the extension of it, and its equality with your hands: then reduce it with this instrument.
Et est instrumentum quod fit ex ferro, cuius longitudo est quantitas septem digitorum, aut octo: et eius latitudo est secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And there is an instrument which is made of iron, whose length is the quantity of seven fingers, or eight: and its width is according to the quantity of the wound.
Et propter illud necesse est medico, ut accipiat ex eis tria, aut quatuor secundum quantitatem qua indiget ad illud ex curatione in omni specie fracturae.	And for this reason it is necessary for a doctor to take from them three, or four according to the quantity which he needs for that cure in every kind of fracture.
Et sit rotundum: et sit in eo grossitudo parua, ut non duplicetur apud compressionem super ipsum in hora operationis: et sit acutae extremitatis, cui sit margo in extremitatibus suis.	And let it be round: and let there be a small thickness in it, so that it not be doubled upon itself during compression upon it at the hour of the operation: and let it have an acute extremity, which has a margin at its extremities.
Et sit superius eius ad grossitudinem ex medietate eius usque ad inferiora.	And let its upper part be of a thickness from its middle to the lower part.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Oportet in Hac Operatione, ut ponatur extremitas eius acuta curuata super extremitatem ossis eminentis: et impelle ipsum cum eo uice una, donec quando redit os et aequatur quadam aequatione.	It is necessary in this operation that the pointed end be placed over the prominent end of the bone, and drive it with this vice until when the bone returns and is made equal to some equation.
Conare ergo aequare extremitates fracturae adinuicem.	Therefore, strive to make the extremities of the fracture equal.
Quod si extremitates eius fracta est subtilis, et non accipit eam instrumentum accaeptione bona, tunc opotet, ut incidas extremitatem illius ossis, donec instrumentum potestatem habeat eius.	If the extremity is fractured finely and does not receive it with a good grip of the instrument, then one must cut the extremity of that bone until the instrument has power over it.
Si uero non potes reducere eos cum eo quod narrauimus omnino, tunc incide ipsum cum eo quod conuenit ei ex Incisoriis quae diximus: aut serra ipsum cum una serrarum quocunque modo possibile est tibi.	If you are not able to reduce them as we have described above, then cut the one with what is appropriate for it from the Incisions which we have said; or saw it with a saw in any way possible to you.
Deinde rade illud quod remanet in osse ex asperitate et corticibus minutis.	Then scrape what remains in the bone of roughness and small cortical layers.
Cum ergo reducitur os, et inuenit infirmus post reductionem eius dolorem uehementem laedentem, tunc scias, quod os non rediit ad locum suum naturalem.	When therefore the bone is reduced and he finds after the reduction of it a violent pain wounding, then know that the bone has not returned to its natural place.
Fac ergo illud.	Do therefore that thing.
Nam tu confers infirmo iuuamentum magnum, cum completur restauratio tua quam facis ossi.	For when you have set a large injury in the weak, and when your restoration of the bone is completed.
Tunc submerge pannum in uino stiptico, nigro.	Then immerse the cloth in black vinegar.
Et proprie si est in aestate.	And properly if it is in summer.
Et non ponas super uulnus caerotum, neque aliquid in quo sit oleum: ut non faciat accidere in ipso putredinem et corruptionem.	And do not place a cauterizing substance over the wound, nor anything that contains oil; so that it may not cause decay and corruption to occur within it.
Deinde administra astellas in hora complementi tui a restauratione ossis.	Then administer stars at the hour of the completion of your restoration of bone.
Et dimitte uulnus detectum: ita, ut incidas cum forficibus foramen in inuolutionibus secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And let the wound be opened: so that you cut with scissors a hole in the folds according to the size of the wound.
Et caue omni cautela, ne stringas uulnus cum fractura.	And with all caution, lest you bind a wound with a fracture.
Multotiens enim fecerunt istud stolidi medici: et fecerunt accidere super infirmos suos aut mortem, aut corrosionem, aut zuchem, id est, saniem.	Many times indeed have done this foolish physicians: and have made happen upon their sick either death, or corruption, or zuchem, that is, gangrene.
Et sit strictura tua mollis, lenis, diuersa stricturae fracturarum reliquarum.	And let your constriction be soft, gentle, different from other fractures' constrictions.
Quod si uulnus est malum, aut est uulnus magnum, et times super ipsum quaedam accidentia mala quae narrauimus, et inuenis dolorem in loco suspensum: tunc non oportet, ut ponas super ipsum astellas.	If the wound is bad, or it is a large wound, and fears some evils upon it that we have recounted, and you find pain in the suspended place: then it is not necessary that you should put stars (plaster) upon it.
Et fac eis inuolutiones ex pannis duris in loco astellarum, et stringe ipsum cum eis.	And make for them rolls of stiff cloths in place of the stars, and bind him with them.
Cum autem est post diem unum, aut dies duos, et uides uulnus iam incipere, ut in eo generetur pus: tunc aufer desuper ipsum pannum quem posuisti super ipsum cum uino.	When, however, it is after one day, or two days, and you see the wound already beginning to produce pus: then remove from above the cloth which you placed upon it with wine.
Deinde administra licinia, et unguenta cum quibus de consuetudine nostra est, ut medicemur uulnera: sicut unguentum tetrapharmacon, et similia illi.	Then administer a liniment and ointments with which it is our custom to treat wounds, such as ointment tetrapharmacon and the like.
Et conuenit tibi, ut soluas ligamentum.	And it is fitting for you that you loosen the ligament.
Et considera uulnus in omni die mane et uespere, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	And consider the wound every day morning and evening until it is consolidated and healed.
Et oportet, ut praeparetur membrum taliter, ut currat ex eo pus ad inferiora cum facilitate.	And it is necessary that the limb be prepared so that pus may run out of it easily downwards.
Quod si praetereunt uulneri dies multi, et non consolidatur, neque abscinditur pus ab eo: tunc scias, quod illic sunt satagie ossis parua.	If many days pass over wounds and it does not heal, and pus is not cut away from it: then know that there are small fragments of bone there.
Quare oportet, ut inquiras uulnus cum tenta.	Therefore it is necessary that you inquire about a wound when touched.
Quot uero ex illis alsatagie sunt separata, remoue ea, et extrahe ipsa.	How many of those abscesses are separated, remove them, and extract them.
Et quae ex eis sunt non separata, et pungunt membrum, et faciunt accidere dolorem, conare incidere ea, et auferre ea omni modo quo possibile est tibi illud.	And those that are not separated from them, and prick the limb, and make it happen pain, try to cut them, and remove them in every way that is possible to you.
Quod si accidat uulneri zuchen, aut ekileten, id est, estiomenus, aut species alia corruptionis et putrefactionis: tunc oportet, ut opponas unicuique ex eis cum eo quod conuenit ei ex curatione, cuius praecessit narratio in capitulo suo.	If it happens that the wound is suppurating, or festering, that is, with a discharge of pus, or another kind of corruption and putrefaction: then it is necessary that you oppose to each one of these things what is fitting for its treatment, whose preceding account was given in its own chapter.
Et ex eo in quo oportet ut stet sermo meus, et cui facias praesentem mentem tuam quando frangitur os, et eminet super membrum, sicut os coxae, et adiutorii, et similia eis ex membris magnis, est, ut non praesumas attractionem eius, multotiens enim accidit ex illo mors, imo dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat.	And in that which is necessary for my speech to stand and to whom you should direct your present mind when a bone is broken and protrudes above the limb, as in the hip bone, and the leg bones, and similar ones from the large limbs, it is that you do not presume to attract it. For many times death happens from this, indeed let it go until it decays.
Fortasse enim cadet per se post uiginti dies, aut triginta.	Perhaps it will fall of itself after twenty days, or thirty.
Tunc ergo cura uulnus, si uidetur tibi: et sinon, dimitte ipsum.	Therefore, take care of the wound if it seems to you: and if not, let it be.
¶ De curatione Nodationis in uestigio fracturae.	On the treatment of a knot in the wound of a fracture.
Caput XXI.	Chapter XXI.
Multoties accidit haec Nodatio in uestigio sanationis fracturae.	This knot often occurs in the course of healing a fracture.
Praecipue, quae est prope iuncturas: et foedatur ex ea figura membri.	Especially which is near the joints and spoils its shape.
Et fortasse prohibet membrum ab operatione sua naturali.	And perhaps it prevents the limb from its natural operation.
Considera ergo tunc, si nodatio est recens: administra in ea medicinas quae stipticitatem habent, sicut aloe, et olibanum, et myrrha, et sarcocolla, et acacia, et similia eis.	Therefore, consider if the knot is recent: administer to it medicines that have astringency, such as aloe, and frankincense, and myrrh, and sarcocolla, and acacia, and things similar to these.
Ita, ut accipias ex istis quasdam, aut omnes eas: et confice eas cum uino stiptico, aut cum albumine oui, aut cum aceto: et pone eas super nodationem in stuppa, et stringe eas super ipsam strictura bona.	Therefore, so that you may receive some of these, or all of them: and prepare them with wine, or with egg white, or with vinegar: and place them over the knot in cotton wool, and bind them over it with a good tightening.
Et dimitte stricturam, nec soluas eam diebus multis.	And release the constriction, and do not loosen it for many days.
Deinde solue eam, et itera aliam, donec remoueatur nodatio.	Then loosen it, and repeat another one, until the knot is removed.
Aut stringe super ipsam laminam plumbi decenter.	Or bind over the lead plate itself centrally.
Plumbo enim est proprietas remouendi omne quod timetur ex membris.	For lead is a property of removing everything that is feared from the limbs.
Si autem nodatio iam in lapidem conuersa est, et stricta est, et festine prouocat necessitas ad auferendum eam: tunc finde super eam ex superiori parte eius, et incide superfluitatem eminentem: aut rade eam cum quibusdam rasoriis, donec remoueatur: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	If however the knot has already been converted to stone and is tight, and haste necessitates its removal; then find on it from above its part and cut away the protruding excess; or shave it with certain razors until it is removed; and take care of it until it heals.
¶ De curatione quando restauratur, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, non secundum naturam suam.	On the care when a limb is restored and remains after that subtle, not according to its own nature.
Caput XXII.	Chapter XXII.
Quando restauratur fractura ossis, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, debile: tunc non fit illud nisi propter caussas multas.	When a bone fracture is restored, and the limb after that remains subtle, weak; then it is not made except for many causes.
Quarum una est, multitudo solutionis ligamenti et ligationis eius non secundum quod oportet: aut propter superfluitatem stricturae ligamentorum, donec prohibeatur nutrimentum currere ad membrum: aut propter multitudinem embrocationis superfluae in non sua hora: aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore infirmi, et debilitatem eius.	One of these is the multitude of solution of the ligament and its ligation not as it ought, either because of the excess stricture of ligaments, until nourishment is prevented from flowing to the limb; or because of the multitude of superfluous embrocation at a time that is not its own; or because of the scantiness of blood in the body of the infirm, and its weakness.
Et curatio illius est, cibare infirmum, et tenerum facere corpus eius, donec multiplicetur sanguis in eo.	And the treatment of this is, to nourish the sick person and make his body tender, until blood multiplies within him.
Et administra balneum.	And administer a bath.
Et intromitte gaudium et laeticiam super eum.	And introduce joy and gladness over him.
Deinde pone picem super membrum: ut attrahat pix ad ipsum nutrimentum multum.	Then place resin over the limb: so that it will attract the resin to itself with much nourishment.
Et assiduet embrocationem eius cum aqua tepida, donec currat nutrimentum, et redeat ad figuram suam naturalem.	And keep applying it with warm water until it runs clear, and returns to its natural shape.
¶ De curatione ossium fractorum quando restaurantur tortuose.	On the healing of broken bones when they are set crookedly.
Caput XXIII.	Chapter XXIII.
Quando accidit membro iam restaurato post sanationem eius tortuositas, et eminentia ossi fracto, aut nodatio: et foedatur per illud forma membri, uerumtamen membrum non prohibetur ab operatione sua naturali: tunc non oportet ut recipias sermonem eius, qui existimat, ut frangatur membrum denuo.	When it happens that a limb, already restored after its healing, has crookedness, and prominence of the broken bone, or knotting; and is defaced by this form of the limb, yet the limb is not prevented from its natural operation: then it is not necessary to receive the word of him, who thinks that the limb should be broken anew.
Et iam fuerunt multi stolidorum medicorum et restauratorum, qui fecerunt illud in terra nostra.	And now there have been many stupid physicians and healers who have done that in our land.
Et haec quidem operatio est uituperabilis ualde, perducens ad mortem, uel timorem magnum, ut scilicet sit mortalis.	And this operation indeed is very blameworthy, leading to death, or great fear, so that it may be mortal.
Verum si claudicatio et nodatio sunt recentes: tunc oportet, ut embrocetur cum aqua tepida, in qua decoctae sint herbae mollificantes, sicut folia alteae, et radix eius, et mellilotum, et illis similia.	But if the lameness and stiffness are recent: then it is necessary that it be poulticed with lukewarm water, in which softening herbs have been boiled, such as the leaves of althea, and its root, and melilot, and similar ones.
Et fiat ei emplastrum cum emplastro mollificatiuo, sicut dyachilon decenter factum.	And let a plaster be made for him with a softening plaster, like dyachylon properly made.
Aut sumatur mucilago radicis alteae, et concutiatur cum adipe gallinae, aut oleo sisamino: et emplastretur cum eo.	Either mucus from the root of althea is taken and mixed with chicken fat, or sesame oil: and it is applied as a poultice with this.
Aut sumantur ficus pingues, et terantur cum fimo columbino, et similibus eis quae nominantur ex medicinis diminuentes consolidationem.	Or take fat figs and grind them with dove dung, and those similar things that are called from medicines diminishing coagulation.
Et quandoque soluitur nodatio cum fricatione assidua, antiqua, et leni, quae fit cum manibus humidis.	And sometimes a knot is loosened with constant friction, old and gentle, which is done with wet hands.
Et administretur motus membri ad omnem partem in horis omnibus.	And movement of the limb should be given to every part throughout the whole day.
Si autem tortuositas iam antecessit, et fortis facta est, et conuersa est in lapidem, et prouocata est necessitas ad curatonem eius cum ferro: tunc oportet, ut secetur superius eius, et soluatur continuatio ossis, et incidatur quod superfluit ex nodatione aut osse cum Incisoriis subtilibus: et administretur facilitas in illo cum sollicitudine et studio.	If the twisting has already occurred, and it has become strong and converted into stone, and necessity arises for its treatment with iron: then it is necessary to cut above it, and loosen the continuity of the bone, and cut away what is superfluous from the knot or bone with fine cutters: and administer ease in this with care and diligence.
¶ De sermone in Dislocatione.	On speech in dislocation.
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter XXIV.
Dislocatio est exitus alicuius iuncturarum a loco suo.	A dislocation is an exit of some joint from its place.
Quare prohibetur a motu suo, et foedatur figura membri.	Therefore, it is prohibited from its movement, and its member's figure is defiled.
Et facit accidere super infirmum dolores, et laesiones uehementes.	And he causes pain and grievous wounds to happen upon the sick person.
Quando ergo accidit alicui dislocatio, tunc oportet festinare ad restaurationem eius: neque tardet eam omnino.	When therefore dislocation happens to anyone, then it is necessary to hasten to its restoration: and do not delay it at all.
Nam si tardatur, apostematur locus, et fortasse cum eo reductio dislocationis.	If this is delayed, the place becomes a boil, and perhaps with it a reduction of the dislocation.
Propter illud ergo non oportet, ut moueatur, neque extendatur in hora apostemationis eius.	Therefore, it should not be moved or extended at the hour of its suppuration.
Quoniam multotiens facit accidere spasmum, et dolores laedentes.	For it often causes spasms and painful aches.
Verum quando accidit illud, tunc oportet, ut properes ad phlebotomiam infirmi.	But when this happens, then it is necessary that you hasten to the phlebotomy of the sick man.
Deinde dimittatur, donec quiescat apostema.	Then let it be left alone until the abscess rests.
Deinde embrocetur membrum cum aqua calida et oleo.	Then the limb will be cauterized with hot water and oil.
Deinde reducatur cum facilitate.	Then it is to be returned with ease.
Et curetur omne membrum cum eo cuius rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And he will cure every limb with it whose remembrance comes to its place.
Ego quidem iam ordinaui capitula dislocationis, etiam secundum quod praecessit in fractura, a superiori parte corporis usque ad inferiorem eius.	I have indeed arranged the chapters on dislocations, also according to what preceded in fractures, from the upper part of the body down to the lower.
¶ De cura dislocationis Mandibulae inferioris.	On the treatment of a dislocation of the lower jawbone.
Caput XXV.	Chapter XXV.
Parum dislocantur duae Mandibulae nisi raro.	The two mandibles are rarely dislocated.
Et dislocatio ambarum fit secundum unum duoru modorum.	And dislocation of both occurs according to one of two modes.
Aut enim remouentur a locis suis remotione parua, et mollificantur parumper.	Or if they are removed from their places by little removal and softened for a short time.
Aut dislocantur dislocatione integra, completa, donec mollificentur ad partem pectoris, donec currat saliua infirmi, et non possit tenere eam, neque possit claudere os suum, et inuoluatur lingua eius cum sermone.	Or they are dislocated by dislocation, intact, complete, until they soften to the part of the chest, until pus runs from the wound of the patient, and he cannot hold it, nor can he close his mouth, and his tongue is involved with speech.
Quando autem dislocatio eius est parua, tunc redit in pluribus dispositionibus per se cum paucitate.	When its dislocation is small, then it returns to several dispositions by itself with little.
Si uero est dislocatio completa, integra: tunc oportet, ut administretur reductio eius uelociter, et non tardetur penitus: et est, ut teneat minister caput infirmi: et intromittat medicus pollicem manus suae unius in radicem Mandibulae dislocationis inter os eius, si dislocatio est a parte una.	If it is a complete dislocation, then it must be reduced quickly and not delayed at all:  and let the attendant hold the head of the sick person, and let the physician insert his thumb into the root of the mandible dislocation between its bone, if the dislocation is on one side.
Aut intromittat duos pollices suos simul, si dislocatio est a duabus partibus.	Or he may insert two fingers at once, if the dislocation is from two parts.
Et reliqui digiti manuum eius sint extra, quibus aequet.	And the remaining fingers of his hand be outside, with which he makes even.
Et praecipe infirmo, ut mundificet Mandibulas suas, et absoluat eas ad manducandum ad omnem partem.	And command the sick person to clean his jawbone and make it whole for eating on every side.
Et medicus aequet Mandibulam, et impellat Mandibulam, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And the physician straightens the Jawbone and pushes the Jawbone until it returns to its place.
Quod si difficilis sit reductio eius, praecipue si sunt ambae Mandibulae simul: tunc administra uaporationem cum aqua calida, et oleo, donec fiat facilis reductio ambarum: neque tardes reductionem ambarum omnino, sicut diximus.	If the reduction is difficult, especially if both mandibles are involved at the same time, then administer vapor with hot water and oil until easy reduction of both occurs. Do not delay the reduction of both altogether, as we have said.
Cum ergo redeunt et aequantur, et clauditur os infirmi, et non mollificantur: tunc pone super eas puluillos pannorum, cum ceroto quod sit factum ex cera: et oleo rosato.	When therefore they return and are made equal, and the bone of the infirm is closed, and they are not softened: then place upon them little wads of cloth, with a cerate which is made from wax: and rose oil.
Deinde ligetur cum facilitate cum ligamentis mollibus.	Then it is bound with ease with soft ligatures.
Et sit somnus infirmi super dorsum suum: et caput eius sit stans inter duo puluinaria, ut non moueat ipsum ad dextram et sinistram: neque conetur, uel cogatur masticare aliquid: imo ponatur cibus eius sorbitio lenis, donec quando remouentur dolores, et nodatur Mandibula: tunc comedat quod uult, et administretur illud cum facilitate.	Let the patient's sleep be upon his back; and let his head be standing between two cushions, so that he does not move it to the right or left; nor attempt, or be forced, to chew anything; rather, let his food be a gentle broth, until when the pains are removed, and the jaw is knit; then let him eat what he wants, and administer it with ease.
Non laboret super operationem oris sui apud comestionem et potum, et oscitationem, donec nodetur Mandibula, et sanetur.	He should not labor over the operation of his mouth at eating and drinking, and speaking, until the jaw has been set and healed.
Quod si difficilis fiat reductio duarum Mandibuiarum, quando dislocantur in hora aliqua, et non conuertuntur ad loca sua: tunc multotiens accidunt inde febres, et soda assidua: et fortasse soluitur uenter infirmi, et fortasse uomit choleram puram.	If the reduction of the two jaws is difficult when they are dislocated at some time and do not return to their places, then many times fevers and constant thirst occur from this, and perhaps the belly of the sick person is loosened, and perhaps he vomits pure bile.
Cum ergo uides illud: tunc scias, quia est perditio, et multotiens moritur ille cui accidit illud in decem diebus.	When therefore you see that: then you will know, that it is destruction, and many times he who happens to have it dies within ten days.
¶ De reducione dislocationis Furculae, et extremitatis humeri.	On the reduction of dislocation of the collarbone and shoulder.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter XXVI.
Furcula quidem non dislocatur ex latere intrinseco, propter continuationem suam cum pectore.	The furcula is not dislocated from within because of its continuity with the chest.
Et dislocatur quandoque ad exteriora: et declaratur illud sensui.	And sometimes it is dislocated outwards: and this is made known to the sense.
Et restauratio eius est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat brachia sua.	And its restoration is, that he lie down the sick on his back, and stretch out his arms.
Deinde coarta locum cum palma tua coartatione forti, nam ipsa redibit.	Then grasp the place with the palm of your hand firmly, for it will return.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stringe eam.	Then place upon the very same plaster, and pads, and bind it.
Extremitates uero eius quae sequuntur cubitum, et continuantur cum eo, non dislocantur, nisi raro.	The extremities which follow the elbow and continue with it, are not dislocated, except rarely.
Quod s dislocatur die aliquo: tunc oportet, ut reducatur et aequetur secundum quod diximus, et quod praeparatur tibi.	If it becomes dislocated on some day, then it is necessary that it be reduced and set equal as we have said, and which was prepared for you.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam.	Then place over the same dressing and lint, and constriction.
Et praecipe infirmo, adhaerere tranquillitati et quieti, donec sanetur.	And command the sick person to adhere to tranquility and quiet until he is healed.
Et cum hac eadem curatione reducitur extremitas Humeri, quando separatur etiam a loco suo.	And with this same cure the limb of the shoulder is reduced when it is also separated from its place.
¶ De reductione dislocationis Humeri.	On the Reduction of a Dislocation of the Shoulder.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter XXVII.
Scias, quod Humerus non dislocatur, nisi secundum tres modos.	Know that the humerus is not dislocated except in three ways.
Quorum unus est, ut dislocetur ad partem titillici ad inferiora.	Of which one is, that it be dislocated to the part of the little toe downwards.
Secundus est, ut dislocetur ad partem pectoris.	The second is, that it be dislocated to the side of the breast.
Et fortasse dislocatur ad superiorem partem Humeri: et illud fit raro.	And perhaps it is dislocated to the upper part of the humerus: and that happens rarely.
Et non dislocatur ad posteriora, propter spatulam.	And it is not displaced posteriorly because of the spatula.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora, propter neruos.	And it is not dislocated anteriorly, because of the nerves.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur et egreditur ad inferiora uersus titillicum: praecipue in illis, quorum carnes sunt paucae.	And most frequently it is displaced and goes out toward the lower part towards the groin: especially in those whose flesh is little.
Quoniam egrediur in eis uelociter, et ingreditur uelociter.	Because it comes out quickly, and goes in quickly.
In illis autem quorum carnes sunt multae, est econtrario illius, scilicet quia egreditur cum difficultate, et ingreditur cum difficultate.	In those with a lot of flesh, the opposite is true, namely that it comes out with difficulty and goes in with difficulty.
Et fortasse accidit quibusdam hominibus percussio, aut casus, et apostematur Humerus apostemate calido, et putatur propter illud, quia iam dislocatus est.	And perhaps it happens to some men by a blow or a fall, and the humerus becomes inflamed with a hot abscess, and this is thought to be because it is already dislocated.
Oportet ergo, ut experiaris illud, donec stes super certitudinem eius, et tunc procedas in curatione eius.	Therefore, you ought to experiment with it until you stand upon the certainty of it, and then proceed in its cure.
Et cognoscitur dislocatio, quando est ad inferiora uersus titillicum: et distinguas inter Humerum dislocatum, et humerum sanum.	And it is known that dislocation occurs when there is a turning downwards of the nipple; and distinguish between a dislocated shoulder, and a healthy shoulder.
Nam tu inuenis inter eos diuersitatem manifestam, et inuenis in capite Humeri concauitatem, et sub titillico apud tactum caput humeri quasi ipsum sit ouum: et non potest infirmus reducere manum ad aurem suam, neque mouere eam omnibus motibus.	And you find among them a manifest diversity, and you find in the head of the Humerus a concavity, and under the touch at the head of the humerus as if it were an egg: and the weak one cannot reduce the hand to his ear, nor move it in all movements.
Et similiter, si dislocatur uersus pectus, aut ad sursum: tunc inuenis manifestum tactum, neque occultatur.	And similarly, if it is dislocated towards the chest, or upwards: then you find a manifest touch, and it is not hidden.
Et huius quidem dislocationis fit facilis reductio, quando est recens, aut infirmus est puer.	And this dislocation is easily reduced when it is recent, or when the child is weak.
Et reductio eius est, ut eleuet minister manum suam ad superiora.	And its reduction is that he raises his hand up.
Deinde pone tu pollices tuos sub titillico eius, et eleua iuncturam cum fortitudine ad sursum ad locum suum: et minister eleuet manum suam, et extendat eam ad sursum.	Then place your thumbs under his little finger and raise the joint with strength upwards to its place; and let the assistant raise his hand and extend it upwards.
Deinde ponat eam inferius, ipse enim redit uelociter.	Then he places it lower, for he himself returns quickly.
Si autem non redit per illud quod diximus, et sunt a principio quo accidit dislocatio dies multi: tunc oportet, ut balneetur infirmus in aqua calida, et administretur embrocatio quae mollificat et lenit, sicut si decoquantur radices alteae, et foenugraecum, et mellilotum in aqua, et administretur.	If it does not return through what we have said, and many days have passed since the dislocation occurred at first: then it is necessary for the sick person to bathe in hot water, and an embrocation which softens and soothes be administered, such as if roots of marshmallow, fennel, and melilot are boiled in water, and it be given.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et ponatur sub titillico eius sphera et lana, quae sit aequalis inter lenitatem et stricturam.	Then the patient is laid flat on his back: and under his armpit a sphere of wool is placed, which is equal between softness and tightness.
Deinde ponat medicus calcaneum suum super spheram, et eleuet caput humeri cum uirtute, et attrahat manum infirmi ad inferiora.	Then the physician places his heel upon a sphere, and elevates the shoulder with strength, and draws the hand of the infirm to the lower parts.
Et minister alius teneat caput infirmi, ut non moueatur ad inferiora: ipse namque redit statim.	And another attendant shall hold the head of the sick person so that it is not moved downwards: for it indeed returns immediately.
Et si uis, reduc eum secundum modum hunc: et est, ut facias esse praesentem uirum qui sit longior infirmo, et stet a parte lateris, et intromittat humerum suum sub titillico infirmi: et eleuet titillicum eius ad superiora, donec sit infirmus suspensus in aere.	And if you wish, reduce him according to this method: and it is that you make present a man who is longer than the weak one, and stands on his side, and inserts his shoulder under the weakened one's armpit: and he elevates the armpit of his upwards until the weak one is suspended in the air.
Et minister alius trahat manum infirmi ad inferiora uentris eius.	And another assistant shall draw the hand of the infirm to the lower part of his belly.
Si autem infirmus est leuis: tunc oportet, ut suspendatur cum eo aliquid aliud, ut grauet ipsum: nam redit dislocatio statim.	If the patient is weak: then it is necessary that something else be suspended with him so that he may weigh down; for the dislocation returns immediately.
Et reducitur etiam secundum modum alium: et est, ut figatur in terra lignum longum, cuius caput sit rotundum figura: sicut manica mortarii: quod non sit grossum, neque subtile.	And it is reduced also according to another manner: and is, as a long piece of wood is laid on the ground, whose head is round in figure: like a death shroud's sleeve: that it not be thick, nor thin.
Deinde ponatur sub infirmo postquam ponuntur super caput ligni panni lenes: et infirmus sit stans secundum longitudinem ligni.	Then a soft cloth is placed under the patient after linen has been placed over his head; and the patient shall stand upright according to the length of the wood.
Deinde extendatur manus eius ad inferiora a parte altera, et extendatur corpus eius ab altera parte cum fortitudine: nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then his hand is extended toward the lower part on the other side, and his body is extended from the other side with strength; for the joint returns to its place with speed.
Quod si difficilis sit eius reductio per omnia quae diximus, tunc utere hac cura: et est, ut accipias lignum cuius longitudo sit quantitas duorum brachiorum, et eius latitudo quantitas quatuor digitorum, et grossitudo eius quantitas duorum digitorum: cui sit caput rotundum, ut alleuietur introitus eius in profundum titillici, secundum hanc formam.	If its reduction through all that we have said proves difficult, then use this treatment: take a piece of wood whose length is the quantity of two arms, and whose width is the quantity of four fingers, and whose thickness is the quantity of two fingers: which should have a rounded head, so that it may ease the entry of its depth into the pudendum, according to this form.
Deinde ligentur super caput rotundum panni lenes, ut non laedat lignum infirmum.	Then soft cloths are tied over the round head so that it does not injure the weak wood.
Deinde ponatur sub titillico infirmi, ut extendatur manus, aut brachium super lignum usque ad inferiora: et ligetur lignum super adiutorium et brachium et extremitatem manus.	Then a plank is placed under the sick person's hand so that it can be extended, or the arm above the wood up to the lower part, and the wood is bound over the helper and the arm and extremity of the hand.
Deinde ponatur brachium super gradum scalae per latitudinem, et extendatur manus ad inferiora, et dimittatur reliquum corpus suspensum a parte altera.	Then the arm is placed upon the step of the ladder lengthwise, and the hand is extended downward, and the rest of the body is let down suspended from the other side.
Iunctura enim ingreditur statim.	The suture enters at once.
Cum ergo completur introitus eius secundum quemcunque modum possibile est: tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico spheram aequalis quantitatis ex lana.	When therefore the entrance is completed according to whichever way is possible: then it is necessary that you place under the linen sphere of equal quantity from wool.
Deinde pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum olibano, et albumine oui super humerum totum, sicut reuoluitur desuper.	Then place a prepared plaster made from ground powder with frankincense and egg white over the entire shoulder, as it turns over above.
Deinde stringe sub titillico strictura decenti: et reuoluatur ligamentum super emplastrum desuper: et annectatur manus eius ad collum ipsius, et dimittatur, neque moueatur manus eius septem diebus.	Then tighten the suture under a proper bandage: and the ligature is rolled over the plaster from above: and his hand is tied to his neck, and let it be laid down, and let not the hand be moved for seven days.
Et oportet, ut ponatur cibus infirmipaucus, donec confortetur membrum: quoniam est uelocius ad sanationem eius.	And it is necessary that little food be given to the sick person until the limb is strengthened; because it is swifter to its healing.
Deinde ponatur amplior post septem dies, aut quinque, et ex ercitetur cum motu.	Then a larger one should be placed after seven days, or five, and it is removed with movement.
Si ergo firmatur et non mollificatur, tunc iam sanatus est.	If therefore it is set and does not soften, then now it is healed.
Si uero iunctura dislocatur multotiens, propter humiditatem quae accidit ei, aut propter caussam aliam: tunc oportet, ut administretur in ea cauterium cum tribus foraminibus, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo de cauterio.	If a joint is dislocated many times because of moisture that occurs to it, or because of another cause: then it is necessary that a cautery with three holes be administered to it, according to what was said before in the chapter on cauterization.
Quod si fiat hoc totum, et soluatur ligamentum post septem dies, et non confirmetur iunctura, et reducatur emplastrum et strictura super ipsum aliquotiens, et non firmetur, et cadat, et non possit eleuare ipsum ad superiora: tunc scias, quod nerui eius qui sunt ad caput humeri, iam incisi sunt, aut extensi, aut mollificati: et scias, quod iunctura nunquam figetur in loco suo.	If all of this is done and after seven days the ligament is loosened and the joint does not hold together, and the plaster is reapplied and tightened over it several times, and it does not firm up, and falls off, and it is not possible to raise it upward: then know that the nerves which are to the shoulder head have already been cut or stretched or softened: and know that the joint will never set in its place.
Dislocationis autem quae fit uersus pectus et mammillam, aut ad posteriora reductio, fit cum impulsione et extensione cum manibus: donec redeat, et administretur in ea reliqua strictura et cura, donec sanetur.	Reduction of a dislocation which occurs towards the chest and nipple, or to the rear, is carried out with impulse and extension with the hands until it returns, and then the rest of the constriction and care are administered until it heals.
Quod si accidat post sanationem grauitas in membro, et tarditas in motu eius, tunc utatur infirmus balneo multotiens, donec leniatur illa grauitas, et redeat ad naturam eius primam.	If after healing heaviness occurs in the limb and slowness of its movement, then let the sick person use a bath many times, until that heaviness is lessened and it returns to its original nature.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Cubiti.	On the treatment of elbow dislocation.
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter XXVIII.
Scias, quod iunctura Cubiti dislocatur cum difficultate, et similiter redit cum difficultate etiam: et ipsa quidem dislocatur ad omnes partes, et praecipue ad anteriorem, aut ad posteriorem.	Know that the joint of the elbow is dislocated with difficulty, and similarly it returns with difficulty; and indeed it is dislocated to all parts, and especially to the anterior, or to the posterior.
Et eius dislocatio non occultatur tibi: quoniam est cadens sub uisu, et sub tactu, secundum quamcunque figuram dislocetur.	And its dislocation is not hidden from you: because it is falling under sight, and under touch, according to whatever form it is dislocated.
Et quando coniungis cubitum dislocatum cum sano, declaratur tibi illud manifeste.	And when you join the dislocated thigh with the healthy one, it will be made manifest to you.
Concauatur enim iunctura, et non potest duplicare brachium, neque tangere cum eo humerum suum.	The joint is concave, and it cannot bend the arm, nor touch its own shoulder with it.
Et oportet, ut properes, et reducas dislocationem statim, antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And it is necessary that you hurry and reduce the dislocation immediately, before a hot abscess happens to it.
Nam si accidit ei apostema calidum, difficilis fit eius reductio: et fortasse non sanatur omnino, praecipue quando est ad posteriora.	For if it happens that he has a hot abscess, its reduction is difficult; and perhaps it does not heal at all, especially when it is towards the rear.
Est enim deterior omnibus speciebus dislocationis, et uehementioris doloris eis: et multotiens descendit cum ea mors.	It is indeed worse than all kinds of dislocations, and causes more violent pain; and many times death descends with it.
Et restauratio eius quando est ex eis quae possibile est reducere, est, ut extendatur manus eius cum duabus manibus: et brachium eius sit expansum, et manus medici sint supra cubitum et sub eo, et ipse impellat iuncturam cum pollicibus manuum suarum simul, aut cum radice palmae suae, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And the restoration of it when it is one of those things which is possible to reduce, is, that the hand be extended with two hands: and the arm be expanded, and the hands of the physician be upon the upper arm and beneath it, and he himself push the joint with his thumbs or with the root of his palm until it returns to its place.
Aut uero dislocatio est ad anteriora: tunc redit ita, ut duplicet manum cum manu sua, donec percutiat cum radice palmae suae cubitum qui est dislocatus.	Or if the dislocation is to the front: then it returns so that it doubles its hand with its own hand until it strikes with the root of its palm the elbow which is dislocated.
Quod si non obedit dislocatio ad reductionem, tunc administra extensionem uehementem, fortem ualde: et est, ut extendant brachium duo ministri: et teneant ipsum duo ministri etiam, ut non remoueatur apud extensionem.	If the dislocation does not yield to reduction, then administer a violent, strong extension; and let two men extend the arm, and let two others also hold it, so that it is not moved during extension.
Deinde reuoluatur brachium ad omnem partem postquam inuoluitur super manum eius pannus duplicatus longus, aut ligamentum latum.	Then the arm is turned to every part after it has been wrapped above its hand with a doubled length of cloth, or a wide bandage.
Et quando tangit medicus manu sua iuncturam, inungat ipsam cum oleo: ut sit illud ex eis quae adiuuant in lubricitate iuncturae cum facilitate.	And when the physician touches a joint with his hand, he should anoint it with oil so that it may be one of those which help in the lubrication of the joint with ease.
Deinde impellat iuncturam impulsione uehementi, donec redeat.	Then drive the joint with a vehement impulse until it returns.
Et post reductionem eius oportet, ut ponatur super ipsam emplastrum, in quo sit stipticitas, et exiccatio cum albugine oui: et stringatur strictura decenti.	And after reduction it is necessary that a plaster be placed upon it, which has astringency and drying power with the membrane of an egg; and the bandage should be tightened moderately.
Et suspendatur brachium a collo infirmi: et dimitte diebus aliquot.	And the arm shall be suspended from the neck of the infirm: and let it be released for several days.
Deinde soluatur.	Then it should be loosened.
Si ergo firmatur iunctura in loco suo, tunc solue ligamentum ab ea, et dimitte ipsam.	If therefore the joint is set in its place, then untie the ligament from it, and release it.
Et si uides iuncturam non bene stringi, tunc itera emplastrum, et ligamentum, et dimitte ipsam diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	And if you see the joint not closing well, then apply a fresh dressing and bandage again, and leave it for several days until it closes.
Deinde solue ipsam.	Then dissolve it.
Si autem accidit ei grauitas post reductionem iuncturae, et dispositio sit in motu: tunc administra humectationem in balneatione, et fricationem subtilem, et compressionem, donec liniatur, aut pone super iuncturam iliati, id est, natem arietis pinguem.	If however it happens to him heaviness after the reduction of the joint, and the arrangement is in motion: then administer moistening in bathing, and subtle friction, and compression, until it is lined up, or place on top of the hip joint, that is, a thick lamb's wool.
Deinde ligetur, et dimitte ipsam super eam die et nocte.	Then it is ligated, and let it be left upon it day and night.
Deinde aufer eam, et intromitte ipsum in balneum.	Then take it out, and introduce it into the bath.
Cum ergo sudat, tunc frica iuncturam fricatione temperata.	When therefore he sweats, then rub the joint with friction tempered.
Deinde itera super ipsam aleliati uice una, et secunda, et tertia cum introitu balnei, donec leniatur.	Then it is repeated over the same area with a single, second, and third wipe with a washcloth, until softened.
Et si uis, pone super ipsam stercus uaccinum, humidum, calefactum cum butyro, et stringe super ipsum.	And if you wish, place over the same manure, moist, heated with butter, and bind over it.
Fac illud aliquotiens.	Do this several times.
Ipsa namque lenitur, et redit ad dispositionem suam.	For indeed it is softened and returns to its proper state.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Almahassem.	On the treatment of a dislocated shoulder, Al-Zahrawi.
Caput XXIX.	Chapter XXIX.
Mahassem manus multotiens dislocatur, id est, iunctura quae est inter brachium et manum.	The joint of the hand is often dislocated, that is, the joint between the arm and hand.
Et reductio dislocationis eius est facilis.	And the reduction of its dislocation is easy.
Econtrario reliquarum iuncturarum.	Contrary to other joints.
Verumtamen oportet, ut uelocitas sit in reductione dislocationis eius in hora in qua dislocatur, antequam apostemetur locus: aut accidat in eo apostema calidum.	Nevertheless, it is necessary that speed be in the reduction of a dislocation in the hour in which it occurs, before the place is suppurated: or a hot suppuration will happen in it.
Et reductio dislocationis in eo est, ut ponas Mahassem manus infirmae super tabulam, et extendat minister manum eius: et ponat medicus palmam suam super eminentiam iuncturae, et impellat eam, donec redeat.	And the reduction of a dislocation is that you place the hand of the infirm person upon the board, and let the assistant extend her hand; and the physician places his palm upon the prominence of the joint, and drives it until it returns.
Verumtamen oportet, ut consyderetur, si palma iam recessit ad uentrem manus: tunc ponat infirmus dorsum manus suae super tabulam apud extensionem et reductionem: et si dislocatio est procedens ad dorsum manus, tunc sit positio manus eius intrinsece super tabulam, id est, interior pars manus eius super tabulam ponatur, ut cadat manus medici super ipsam eminentiam iuncturae.	Nevertheless, it ought to be considered, if the palm has already retreated to the stomach of the hand: then let the infirm person place the back of his hand upon a table at extension and reduction: and if the dislocation is proceeding to the back of the hand, then let the position of his hand be intrinsically above the table, that is, the inner part of his hand above the table, so that the hand of the physician may fall upon that eminence of the joint.
Si ergo redit statim, bonum est: et si non, tunc stringe eam cum emplastro sedante apostema: et dimitte ipsum, neque iteres illud.	If therefore it returns immediately, it is good: and if not, then bind it with a soothing plaster for an abscess: and dismiss him, and do not repeat it.
Nam si non tolerat, neque potes super reductionem eius, postquam praetereunt ei dies, uerumtamen iunctura remanet secundum tortuositatem suam: et non nocet infirmo aliquid, nisi quod mollificatur manus, et non potest stringere aliquid: tunc scias, quod nerui sunt abscissi, aut attriti.	If he does not tolerate it, and you cannot bring about its reduction after days have passed, yet the joint remains according to its crookedness; and it does not harm the sick person, except that it softens the hand, and is unable to grasp anything: then know that the nerves have been severed or rubbed.
Non est ergo ingenium in ea, nisi ut stringatur cum cauterio prope casum eius.	There is therefore no intelligence in it, unless it be tightened with a cautery near its case.
Et fortasse non confert illud aliquid.	And perhaps that thing doesn't matter.
Cum ergo non redit Almahassem, tunc pone super ipsum emplastrum, quod narrauimus.	When therefore Almahassem does not return, then place upon him the plaster which we have recounted.
Deinde stringatur, et dimittatur quinque diebus: postea soluatur et dimittatur, et exercitetur manus.	Then it is bound and left for five days; afterward it is loosened and left, and the hand is exercised.
Si autem priuatur motus eius, et accidat in ea aliquid grauitatis: tunc leni eam cum aqua calefacta, et fricatione aliquotiens, donec leniatur.	If movement is prevented and something heavy happens to it, then soften it with warm water and friction several times until it softens.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Digitorum.	On the treatment of finger dislocations.
Caput XXX.	Chapter XXX.
Quando dislocatur ex eis Digitus ad omnem partem, uel ex eis Digitus ad dorsum palmae, aut uentrem eius: tunc extende Digitum, et impelle dislocationem pollicibus tuis, donec redeat.	When a finger is dislocated from its place, whether it be to any part, or from its place in the palm of the hand, to its back, or to its belly: then extend the finger, and push the dislocation with your thumbs until it returns.
Deinde sustenta caput Digiti, et suspende ipsum uersus partem ad quam dislocatur, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	Then support the head of the finger, and suspend it towards the part toward which it is dislocated, and let it be for two days.
Deinde suspende eum, et extende ipsum, donec aequetur rectus in illo die suo.	Then suspend him, and extend him, until he is equal to straight on that day of his.
Cum ergo fuerit nox, liga ipsum secundum narrationem ipsam: et non cesses soluere ipsum in die: et exerce eum cum motu: et liga ipsum in nocte.	When therefore night shall have come, bind it according to its own story: and do not cease to loosen it in the day: and exercise him with motion: and bind it at night.
Fac illud diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	Do this for several days until it tightens.
Et similiter fac cum eo, si dislocatur ad uentrem manus: et liga eum ad partem ipsam, et fac cum eo operationem tuam primam, donec sanetur.	And similarly do with it if it is dislocated to the belly of the hand: and bind it to that part, and make with it your first operation, until it heals.
Et similiter fac cum eo quando dislocatur ad reliquas partes.	And similarly do when it is dislocated to the other parts.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Spondilium dorsi.	On the cure of a dislocation of the vertebrae of the back.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter XXXI.
Quando accidit alicui Spondilium dorsi, aut colli dislocatio completa, aut remouentur Spondiles multae a locis suis: tunc non est in ea curatio, quoniam mors properat infirmo.	When it happens to someone that their spinal column in the back or neck is completely dislocated, or many vertebrae are removed from their places: then there is no cure for it, because death rushes upon the sick person.
Et signum illius est, quod egestio infirmi egreditur absque uoluntate, neque potest tenere eam: et multotiens mollificantur ex eo quaedam membra eius, aut duo crura eius, aut duo brachia ipsius, aut unum eorum: aut remouetur Spondilis una de loco suo.	And the sign of it is that the stool of the sick person comes out without will, and he cannot hold it: and many times some limbs of him are softened, or two legs of him, or two arms of him, or one of them: or a single hip bone is removed from its place.
Multotiens enim remouetur, quod multotiens fit remotio earum ad quatuor partes.	For it is often removed, which is often removed to four parts.
Illa ergo quae remouetur ad posteriora, nominatur Gibbositas.	Therefore, that which is moved to the rear, is called Gibbosity.
Curatio uero eius est, ut consyderes tunc, si Gibbositas accidit a puericia: tunc non est in ea curatio, neque ex ea est sanatio omnino.	Now as for its cure, consider this, if hunchback occurs from childhood, then there is no cure in it, nor is there any healing whatsoever from it.
In illa autem quae accidit a casu, aut percussione, aut similibus illis, iam dixerunt antiqui modos curationis sermone prolixo.	In that which happens by chance, or percussion, or similar things, the ancients have already said ways of healing in verbose speech.
Cuius plurimum non redit cum proficuo.	Of which very much does not return with profit.
Ego uero iam abbreuiaui ex illo, cuius parum excusat a multo eius ex propinquitate mea ad intentionem: et expositione mea qua exposui illud, et formaui instrumentum eius diuerso modo ab eo quo ostenderunt illud, et exposuerunt ipsum.	I myself have abbreviated from that, which little excuses me because of its nearness to my intent; and in my exposition which I have exposed it, and fashioned its instrument in a different way than they showed it, and exposed it.
Dico ergo, quod in gibbositate quae accidit ab anteriori parte, non est ingenium, neque sanatio ex ea.	Therefore I say that in a hunchback which occurs from the front part, there is no skill nor healing from it.
Et similiter in illa quae fit ad duo latera etiam.	And similarly in that which is done on both sides also.
Et non curatur ex eis, nisi illa quae accidit in dorso proprie, cum eo quod ego narro: et est, ut extendatur infirmus super faciem suam super podium aequale prope parietem: et expandatur sub eo stramentum humidum, ut non laedatur pectus eius.	And it is not cured from these, unless that which happens on the back properly, as I tell you: and it is, that the sick person be stretched out over his face over a level platform near the wall: and there should be spread under him a wet cloth, so that his chest is not harmed.
Deinde ponatur lignum rectum fixum in fouea in terra, in extremitate podii, circiter caput eius: et lignum aliud circiter pedes eius in extremitate altera podii: et minister teneat lignum, et sit non firmatum in fouea.	Then a straight fixed piece of wood is placed in the hole in the ground at the foot's end, about the head of it: and another piece of wood about its feet at the other end of the foot: and let the servant hold the wood, and not be fastened in the hole.
Et minister alter teneat alterum.	And one assistant shall hold another.
Deinde inuolue super caput infirmi, et sub titillicis eius ligamentum lene, firmum: et extende extremitatem ligamenti ad lignum quod est apud caput eius: et liga ipsum in eo.	Then wrap over the head of the sick person, and under the tie of his ligament soft and firm: and extend the extremity of the ligament to the wood which is at its head: and bind it there.
Deinde stringe ligamentum aliud supra anchas eius, et supra genua ipsius, et apud cauillas eius.	Then tighten another ligament above its bends, and above its knees, and at its groin.
Deinde aggrega ligamenta omnia, et liga ea in ligno altero quod est apud pedes eius.	Then gather all the ligaments and tie them to a second stick that is at his feet.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem ligni ligamentum, et non remoueantur duo ligna ex locis suis in quibus sunt fixa: uerumtamen non sint firmata, sicut diximus.	Then let every assistant extend to the part of the stick a ligament, and do not remove two ligaments from their places where they are fixed; but however, let them not be fastened, as we have said.
Et medicus ponat palmas suas super Spondilem cum fortitudine, donec redeat: aut ponat super eam tabulam.	And the physician places his palms upon the spine with strength until it returns, or places a board upon it.
Deinde annectat super tabulam pedes suos, donec redeat.	Then he ties his feet to the board until he returns.
Si autem non redit per hanc curationem, tunc accipe tabulam cuius longitudo sit circiter tria brachia.	If it does not return through this treatment, then take a board whose length is about three spans.
Et caua in pariete de quo diximus quod est prope infirmum, locum in quem ingrediatur extremitas tabulae.	And the hollow in the wall of which we said that it is near the sick person, place in which the end of the board may enter.
Deinde pone medium tabulae super Spondilem.	Then place the middle board over the Spondilem.
Et ponat pedes suos medicus super extremitatem alteram.	And the physician shall place his feet upon the other extremity.
Et stringat bene, donec coartetur Spondilis, et redeat ad locum suum.	And he will pull tight well until the vertebra be contracted, and return to its place.
Deinde si uis, operare cum torno quod inuoluitur cum manu tua: et est, ut figas in terram apud caput infirmi in postremo podii duo ligna, quorum longitudo sit brachii unius: et apud caput eius in postremo podii duo ligna.	Then if you wish, operate with a lathe that is wrapped with your hand: and it is, as to fasten in the ground at the head of the sick man in the last foot two logs, whose length is the length of one arm: and at his head in the last foot two logs.
Et sit longitudo quae est inter omne lignum palmus unus: et iam factum est in omni loco foramen, in quo currit tornum: et firmetur lignum omne in terra multum, ne moueatur omnino.	Let the length between any piece of wood be one palm; and now a hole has been made everywhere, through which the drill runs: and let the whole wood be firmly set in the ground so that it moves not at all.
Et intromittatur lignum rotundum: et est tornum in quo reuoluitur ligamentum in duobus foraminibus duorum lignorum.	And a round piece of wood is introduced: and it is a  turning tool in which the ligament is rotated in the two holes of two pieces of wood.
Et in extremitate eius est foramen, in quo firmatur lignum, cuius longitudo est palmus cum eo quod reuoluitur: et in duobus lignis aliis est similiter illius.	And at the end of it is an opening, into which a piece of wood is fixed, whose length is a palm with that which revolves; and in two other pieces of wood there is similarly that one.
Deinde stringe ligamenta quae strinxisti in pectore infirmi torno quod est apud caput eius: et ligamenta quae strinxisti in cruribus eius in torno quod est apud pedes eius.	Then tighten the ligaments which you tightened in the chest of the sick person with a rope which is near his head: and the ligaments which you tightened in his legs with a rope which is near his feet.
Deinde stet apud omne tornum minister, qui torqueat manum suam cum licinio, cum quo reuoluitur tornum: et medicus aequet Spondilem, secundum quod diximus.	Then let there be at every lathe a servant who will turn his hand with a linen cloth, with which the lathe is turned; and the physician shall level the Spondyle, according to what we have said.
Haec est forma torni, quae sequitur.	This is the form of the forceps that follows.
Deinde postquam redit Spondilis, et aequatur locus, tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum exiccatiuum cum albumine oui.	Then after the sponge is returned and the place is leveled, it is necessary to place a dry dressing with egg white.
Deinde stuppam.	Then a plug.
Postea pone supra emplastrum astellam ex tabula, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, aut circiter eos.	Afterwards, place above the plaster a star from wood, whose width is three fingers, or about so many.
Et longitudo eius quantitas quae capiat locum Gibbositatis, et super partem Spondilis sanae.	And its length is the quantity that it takes up in the place of hunchbackness, and over the part of the healthy vertebra.
Deinde ligetur cum ligamento quod diximus.	Then it is bound with the ligament which we have said.
Et utatur infirmus nutrimento subtili, donec sanetur.	And let the sick person use fine nourishment until he is healed.
Quod si remaneat quiddam eminentiae in loco in fine sanationis: tunc oportet, ut administrentur medicinae quae mollificant, et leniunt, cum administratione tabulae quam narrauimus tempore longo.	If something remains prominent at the end of healing: then it is necessary that softening and soothing medicines be administered, along with the application of the board which we narrated a long time ago.
Et iam administratur in illo lamina plumbi.	And now a lead plate is administered in it.
Et quandoque accidit eminentia in postremo Spondilium dorsi: et putatur per eam dislocatio, et est illud os quod iam eminet.	And sometimes there occurs a prominence in the last vertebra of the back; and it is thought to be through this dislocation, and it is that bone which now protrudes.
Quare non oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei cum hac medicina: fortasse enim accidere faciet mortem.	Therefore it is not necessary that a presumption be made with this medicine; for perhaps it will cause death.
¶ De curatione Anchae dislocatae.	On the treatment of a dislocated shoulder.
Caput XXXII.	Chapter XXXII.
Scias, quod iuncturae Anchae, et iuncturae humeri, non accidit, nisi dislocatio tantum: neque accidit eis quod accidit reliquis iuncturis ex remotione parua, et concauitate.	Know this, that the joints of the Ancha, and the joints of the shoulder, do not occur, unless dislocation only; and it does not happen to them what happens to other joints from slight removal, and concavity.
Et iunctura quidem Anchae dislocatur secundum quatuor partes.	And indeed the articulation of the ankle is dislocated in four parts.
Quod est, quia dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	That is because it is displaced anteriorly and posteriorly.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur ad interiora: et parum dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	And it is moved most certainly inwards; and little outwards, and backwards.
Et curatio dislocationis eius ad interiora, est: quia quando tu coniungis crus infirmi sanum cum infirmo, est longius: et est genu eius eminens plus quam sani, et non potest infirmus duplicare pedem suum apud inguen: et est locus qui sequitur inguen apostematus apostemate calido, propterea, quod caput coxae iam peruenit illic.	And the cure of its dislocation inwards is: because when you join the broken leg to the sound one, it is longer: and its knee is more prominent than that of a healthy one, and the broken leg cannot bend at the groin: and there is a place following the groin that is an abscess with hot pus, because the hip head has already reached there.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad exteriora est, quod sunt accidentia eius contraria istis accidentibus.	And the sign of him who has a dislocation outwards is that those things which are on the outside are contrary to those things which are inside.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad anteriora, est, quia expandit crus sanum secundum complementum: uerumtamen non duplicat ipsum absque dolore qui est in genu: et si conatur ad ambulandum, non potest super illud ad anteriora: et retinetur urina eius, et apostematur inguen eius, et apud ambulationem est calcatio eius super calcaneum.	And the sign of one who has a dislocation forward is, because he stretches his healthy leg according to its proportion; however, he does not double it without pain which is in the knee: and if he attempts to walk, he cannot pass over it forward: and his urine is retained, and his groin suppurates, and when walking his foot falls upon his heel.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad posteriora est, ut non expandat genu, neque possit duplicare ipsum antequam duplicet inguen: et est crus eius etiam breuius altero: et inguen est mollificatum, et est caput coxae apud locum ilii.	And the sign of him to whom this dislocation happens is that he does not straighten his knee, nor can he bend it before he bends his groin: and his leg is also shorter than the other: and his groin is softened, and the head of the hip is at the place of the ilium.
Reductio uero huius dislocationis specierum est, ut consyderes tunc, si dislocatio est uetusta, quae iam antiquatur cum habente ipsam.	The reduction of this dislocation is, as you consider, if the dislocation is old, which already grows stale with having it.
Deinde si tu administres reductionem eius, et remanet secundum dispositionem suam: tunc non est in ea curatio omnino.	Then if you administer its reduction, and it remains according to its disposition: then there is no treatment at all in it.
Non ergo oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei penitus.	Therefore it is not necessary that full presumption be made of him.
In illo autem cuius dislocatio est recens, et est ex una specierum quatuor dislocationis: tunc propera ad hoc, ut uoluas iuncturam, et extendas ipsam ad interiora et ad exteriora, et moueas eam dextra et sinistra: fortasse enim redit, et non indiget alia cura.	In that one, however, whose dislocation is recent, and is of one of the four kinds of dislocation: then hasten to this, so that you may wish the joint, and extend it both inwards and outwards, and move it with your right and left hand: for perhaps it will return, and does not need other care.
Si autem non redit hoc modo, tunc oportet, ut praepares ministrum fortem, et extendat crus eius ab inferiori parte: aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento, quod ligetur super crus eius supra genu: et minister alius extendat manum eius desuper, ita ut intromittat manus suas sub titillicis eius.	If this method does not work, then it is necessary that you prepare a strong assistant, and he should extend the leg of the patient from its lower part: either with his hands, or with a bandage which is tied above the knee; and another assistant should extend the hand of the patient from above, so that he may insert his hands under the testicles.
Deinde stringat cum ligamento leni super radicem coxae, et teneat extremitatem ligamenti alterius.	Then he will tighten with a soft bandage on the root of the hip and hold the other end of the bandage.
Et sit extensio eius aut ab anteriori parte inguinis ad partem furculae, aut a posteriori ad partem dorsi.	And let its extension be either from the anterior part of the groin to the point of the collarbone, or from the posterior to the part of the back.
Et sit extensio eorum omnium uice una, donec eleuetur infirmus cum corpore suo a terra, et remaneat pendens.	And let their extension all be as one, until the sick person is lifted with his body from the ground, and remains hanging.
Et haec enim species extensionis est species communis specierum quatuor.	And this kind of extension is a common kind of the four kinds.
Si ergo redit dislocatio cum eo quod diximus, est bonum: et si non, tunc necesse est omni speciei illud quod dicam de curatione propria.	If therefore the dislocation returns with that which we said, it is good: and if not, then it is necessary to do all kinds of that which I will say concerning the cure proper.
In reductione quidem eius propria quando dislocatio est ad interiora, oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super latus suum sanum.	When indeed a dislocation is toward the interior, it ought that the sick person be laid on his healthy side in the reduction.
Deinde ponat ligamentum super radicem coxae, in eo quod est inter caput coxae, et locum qui est sub inguine.	Then he places a ligature above the root of the hip, where it is between the head of the hip and the place which is under the groin.
Deinde extende ligamentum ad sursum a parte inguinis ad altiorem partem corporis, ad partem furculae.	Then extend the ligament upward from the groin area to the higher part of the body, to the collarbone.
Deinde accipiat minister alius fortis brachia eius, et minuat locum grossum coxae infirmae, et extendat ad exteriora extensione uehementi.	Then let another attendant take strong arms and reduce the large place of the weak hip, and extend it outward with violent extension.
Iam enim redit ad locum suum.	For now he returns to his place.
Et haec species est facilioris reliquis speciebus curationis, qua reducitur hoc membrum.	And this kind is easier of healing than the rest, in which this limb is reduced.
Si autem excusatur super te, et non obedit tibi ad introitum cum hac specie curationis omnino: tunc oportet, ut ligentur duo pedes infirmi simul cum ligamento forti, leni, super duos calcaneos, et super duo genua: et sit longitudo cuiusque a compare suo quantitatis quatuor digitorum: et sit crus infirmum extensum plus altero quantitate duorum digitorum.	If he excuses himself from you and does not obey you for the entry with this kind of treatment at all: then it is necessary that two feet of the infirm be bound together simultaneously with a strong, soft bandage, above the two heels, and above the two knees; and let the length of each be four finger widths from its counterpart; and let the infirm leg be extended more than the other by two finger widths.
Deinde suspendatur infirmus super caput ligni, quod sit in domo: et sit longitudo eius a terra quantitas duorum brachiorum.	Then let the sick person be suspended over the head of a piece of wood that is in the house: and let its length from the ground be the quantity of two arms.
Deinde praecipe iuueni forti, ut muniat caput coxae: et suspendatur cum infirmo inuenis alius: et impellat iuuenis alius, muniens coxam cum fortitudine, nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then command the strong young man to brace the hip joint; and let another support him who is injured; and let another youth brace the hip with strength, for the joint returns to its place with speed.
In reditione autem eius propria, quando est dislocatio ad exteriora, oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super podium, secundum quod narrauimus in habente gibbositatem.	In its reduction, however, when it is a dislocation to the outside, it is necessary that the sick person lie on a platform, according to what we have narrated in him who has a hunchback.
Et stringatur ligamentum super crus eius, infirmum proprie, et super pectus eius.	And a bandage be tied over the leg of him, the infirm one, and over his chest.
Deinde ponantur duo ligna, unum apud pedes eius, et alterum apud caput ipsius.	Then two boards are placed, one at his feet, and the other at his head.
Deinde ponatur lignum additum in medio podii, fixum bene: super quod inuoluti sint panni humidi, ut non laedat infirmum: et sit lignum inter coxas eius, ut non attrahatur ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then a piece of wood added in the middle of the foot should be placed, well fixed: upon which wet cloths should be wrapped so that it does not harm the sick person: and let the wood be between his hips, so that it is not pulled down towards the lower parts when extending.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem suam, et medicus aequet reductionem manu sua.	Then let every assistant extend his part, and the physician equalize the reduction with his hand.
Si ergo obedit ad reuersionem, erit bonum.	If therefore he obeys restoration, it will be good.
Et si non, pone super ipsam tabulam, et preme ipsam, sicut diximus in gibbositate, aequaliter.	And if not, place upon that same table, and press it down, as we said in the hunchback, equally.
Verumtamen oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	Nevertheless, it is necessary that the sick person lie on his healthy side.
Et quando dislocatio est ad anteriora, tunc oportet, ut extendatur crus infirmi uelociter: et est secundum hanc eandem narrationem super podium: et ponat medicus palmam manus suae dextrae super inguen infirmum.	And when the dislocation is to the front, then it is necessary that the leg of the injured person be extended quickly; and this is according to this same account upon a footstool: and the physician places the palm of his right hand above the groin of the injured person.
Deinde coartet ipsum cum manu altera, et cum illa coartatione pone ipsum extensum ad inferiora ad partem genu.	Then he constricts it with the other hand, and with that constriction, he places it extended below to the part of the knee.
Et si dislocatio est ad posteriora: tunc non oportet, ut extendatur infirmus ad inferiora, et sit eleuatus super terram: imo oportet, ut sit positus super rem duram, sicut oportet, ut fit etiam si dislocatur ancha eius ad exteriora, secundum illud quod diximus de accubitu eius super duas anchas: et est super faciem eius, et ligamenta extensa: secundum quod diximus nuper.	And if the dislocation is to the rear: then it is not necessary for the infirm to be extended downwards and raised above the ground: rather, it is necessary that he be placed upon a hard thing, as it is necessary, as we said, if an inch of his is dislocated outwards, according to what we said about his lying on two boards: and it is above his face, and ligaments are extended: according to what we said recently.
Et oportet, ut administretur compressio cum tabula etiam super locum ad quem egreditur iunctura, cum completur reductio secundum quod oportet.	And it is necessary that a compression be administered with a board also over the place to which the joint goes out, when the reduction is completed as it ought.
Et signum reditionis eius non occultatur tibi: et est, ut extendas duo crura infirmi: et quando uides ea aequalia, et infirmus stringit crus suum, et expandit ipsum absque excusatione: tunc scias, quia iam redit membrum, secundum quod oportet: tunc coniunge duas coxas, et pone emplastrum, et stringe cum imemati, id est, rota: ita, ut non moueatur ancha ad aliquam partium: et adhaereat infirmus quieti tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	And the sign of its return is not hidden from you: and it is, that you extend the two legs of the weak one: and when you see them equal, and the weak one tightens his leg, and expands it without excuse: then know, that now the limb returns, according to what is necessary: then join the two hips, and put a plaster, and tighten with an imemati, that is, a wheel: so that it not move any part: and adhere the weak one in quiet for three days, or four.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et emplastrum, et compara crus cum altero: tunc si uides ea aequalia in statu, tunc scias, quod dislocatio iam firmata est: absolue ergo infirmum ad ambulandum.	Then solve the ligament, and the dressing, and compare the leg with the other: then if you see them equal in state, then know that the dislocation is already fixed: therefore discharge the sick person to walk.
Et si uides aliquid mollificationis: tunc redi, et emplastra illud, et stringe illud secundum stricturam tuam primam: et dimitte illud etiam tribus diebus.	And if you see anything softening: then return, and plaster it, and bind it according to your first stricture: and let it stand for even three days.
Deinde solue illud et fac ipsum tardare in ambulatione super utrumque aliquot diebus, donec confortetur bene.	Then resolve it and make it slow down in walking on both sides for several days, until it is well strengthened.
¶ De dislocationis Genu.	On the dislocation of the knee.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter XXXIII.
Genu dislocatur secundum tres modos.	The knee is dislocated in three ways.
Dislocatur ad exteriora, ad interiora, et ad inferiora, scilicet ad posteriora.	It is dislocated externally, internally, and downwards, namely backwards.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora.	And it is not dislocated forward.
Et signum dislocationis eius, est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut applicet crus suum ad coxam suam.	And the sign of its dislocation is that you bid the infirm person apply his leg to his hip.
Si autem non adhaeret cum coxa: tunc scias, quod Genu est dislocatum.	If it does not adhere with the hip, then you know that the knee is dislocated.
Et restauratio omnium modorum dislocationis eius est, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum, ita ut iam extendat crus suum si potest super illud, et adhaeret dorsum tuum ad faciem eius: et pone pedem eius inter pedes tuos.	And the restoration of all kinds of dislocation of it is that you make the weak person sit straight so that he can now extend his leg if he can, and stick your back to his face: and place his foot between your feet.
Deinde adhaerere fac Genu eius cum palmis tuis, et recta eas inter digitos tuos super Genu eius.	Then make his knee adhere with your palms, and straighten them between your fingers upon his knee.
Deinde applica cum palma tua duo latera Genu eius cum fortitudine.	Then apply with your palm both sides of his knee with fortitude.
Et minister alius extendat pedem eius, donec redeat Genu ad locum suum.	And another assistant shall extend his foot until the knee returns to its place.
Et signum reditionis est, ut adhaereat crus cum coxa in lenitate, non laboriose.	And the sign of its return is that the leg adheres to the hip with ease, not laboriousness.
Deinde emplastra ipsum, et adhaerere fac crus cum coxa.	Then apply a plaster and adhere the leg to the hip.
Deinde liga ea simul cum uitta tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then bind that together with three or four strips of linen.
Deinde solue ea.	Then loosen it.
Et non utatur infirmus ambulatione aliquot diebus, donec sanetur.	And let not the sick person walk for several days until he is healed.
Si autem recusatur tibi reductio eius, tunc administra extensionem fortem cum ligamentis, quorum praecessit narratio in curatione anchae, donec redeat.	If, however, reduction is refused to you, then administer a strong extension with ligaments, of which the preceding narrative in the treatment of the ankle has been related, until it returns.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Calcanei.	On the treatment of a calcaneus dislocation.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter XXXIV.
Calcaneus quandoque remouetur remotione parua, et quandoque dislocatur secundum complementum.	Sometimes the calcaneus is removed with a small incision, and sometimes it is dislocated according to its joint.
Et dislocatio eius fit, aut ad interiora, aut ad exteriora.	And its dislocation occurs, either inward or outward.
Et signum dislocationis eius est, quod uides Calcaneum inflatum, procedentem ad partem ad quam dislocatur.	And the sign of its dislocation is that you see the calcaneus inflated, proceeding to the part to which it dislocates.
Curatio autem remotionis eius, est facilis reditionis: et est, ut extendatur cum facilitate cum manibus, et aequetur, donec redeat.	The cure of its removal is easy and consists in stretching it gently with the hands and leveling it until it returns.
In curatione autem eius quando dislocatur secundum complementum, oportet, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum: et teneat ipsum minister fortis ualde a posteriori parte dorsi eius, in medio ipsius.	In the treatment of this condition when it is dislocated according to the completion, it is necessary that you make the sick person sit straight: and let him be held by a strong servant very firmly from the posterior part of his back, in the middle of it.
Deinde tene tu cum manu tua dextra pedem eius a superiori parte eius, et cum manu tua sinistra ab inferiori parte pedis eius loco cauillae.	Then hold you with your right hand his foot from its upper part, and with your left hand from the lower part of his foot in place of the heel.
Deinde trahe pedem ad tecum manu tua dextra.	Then draw the foot toward you with your right hand.
Deinde cum sinistra duabus uicibus.	Then with two left incisions.
Deinde extende cum sinistra, et impelle pectus pedis cum dextra uersus crus absque labore.	Then extend with the left and push the chest of the foot with the right towards the leg without effort.
Fac illud bis, sicut narrauimus.	Do that twice, as we have narrated.
Deinde impelle pectus pedis ad crus in uice tertia, et tu trahis cauillam.	Then drive the breast of the foot toward the leg in the third space, and you draw the tendon.
Si ergo redit in uice una, aut in duabus secundum hunc modum, et uides pedem aequatum, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera operationem super ipsum: quoniam ipse redit.	If therefore it returns in one, or in two, according to this mode, and you see the foot even, it is good: and if not, then repeat the operation on it; because it itself returns.
Si autem prohibetur tibi reductio eius cum eo quod narrauimus: tunc fac iacere infirmum super dorsum suum super terram, et fige paxillum in terra firmatum ualde, ut cadat inter coxas eius: et tu iam inuoluisti super ipsum pannum, ut non laedat infirmum.	If it is forbidden to you to reduce it with what we have told you: then make the sick person lie on his back on the ground, and place a small pillow firmly on the ground, so that it falls between his hips: and you have already wrapped him in cloth, so that he does not harm the sick person.
Deinde accipiat minister coxam eius: postea extendat minister alter pedem, aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento quod liget super collum pedis.	Then let the assistant take hold of his hip: afterwards let another assistant stretch out his foot, either with his hands or with a bandage which is tied above the ankle.
Deinde extendat omnis minister contra extensionem comparis sui: et paxillus sit stans inter duas coxas infirmi retinens eum, ut non attrahatur corpus eius ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then let every assistant extend against the extension of his own comparison: and a pillow shall stand between the two hips of the infirm retaining him, so that his body is not pulled down during the extension.
Deinde aequet medicus dislocationem manibus suis, et minister alter teneat crus sanum ad inferiora.	Then the physician reduces the dislocation with his hands, and another assistant holds the healthy leg down toward the lower part.
Nam dislocatio redit cum uelocitate.	For dislocation returns with speed.
Quando ergo redit dislocatio, et declaratur tibi sanitas reditionis eius: tunc pone emplastrum et stuppam, et stringe ipsam cum ligamentis firmiter, et liga pedem cum ligamento ad crus.	When therefore a dislocation returns, and health of its return is declared to you: then place a plaster and padding, and bind it firmly with ligaments, and tie the foot with a ligament to the leg.
Et oportet, ut caueas uel timeas de neruis, qui sunt supra calcaneum posterius, ut non sit ligamentum super eos uehemens, et laedat eos.	And it is necessary that you be careful or fearful of the nerves which are above the heel bone, so that the ligament above them may not be too strong and injure them.
Deinde dimitte ipsum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then let him be dismissed after two days, or three.
Quod si mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum: deinde solue ipsum in die tertio, aut quarto: et prohibe infirmum ab ambulatione quadraginta diebus.	If the ligament is softened, tighten it; then loosen it on the third or fourth day, and forbid the sick person from walking for forty days.
Si uero conatur ambulare ante illud spacium, non fit securitas quin dissoluatur super ipsum dislocatio, et corrumpatur, et non recipiat post illud curationem.	If he nevertheless attempts to walk before that time, there is no safety unless the dislocation dissolves over him, and it is corrupted, and does not receive after that cure.
Quod si accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc oportet, ut administres in sedatione eius illud, in quo praecessit narratio nostra in alio loco ex curatione, et embrocationem, donec remoueatur.	If it happens that he has a hot abscess, then it is necessary to administer that which we previously narrated elsewhere concerning the treatment of this, and an ointment, until it is removed.
¶ De dislocatione Digitorum pedis, et cura.	On the dislocation of the toes of the foot, and its treatment.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter XXXV.
Oportet, ut aequetur quod dislocatur ex eis cum extensione pauca absque labore: et illud quidem non est difficile, imo est facile.	It is necessary that what is dislocated be equal with it by extension little without labor; and indeed this is not difficult, but rather is easy.
Si autem dislocatio est in quibusdam nodis dorsi pedis: tunc oportet, ut faciat sedere infirmus pedem suum super locum aequalem terrae, aut super tabulam: et est stans sicut ambulans.	If the dislocation is in certain joints of the foot's back: then it is necessary that he who is infirm make his foot sit upon an equal place to the earth, or upon a board: and stand thus as if walking.
Deinde tu sta, et pone pedem tuum super illud quod eminet ex illis iuncturis.	Then you stand, and put your foot upon that which projects from those joints.
Deinde calca illud cum pede tuo cum uirtute, donec redeat, et uideas ipsum iam aequatum, et non appareat in loco eminentia.	Then press it with your foot with strength until it returns and you see it level, and there is no prominence in the place.
Deinde pone sub uentre pedis eius tabulam quae capiat pedem totum, cui sint duo capita.	Then place under his foot a board which will catch the whole foot, which has two heads.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti tribus diebus.	Then tighten it with a bandage for three days.
Deinde solue ipsum, et fac quiescere eum ab ambulatione diebus multis, donec stringatur et securetur a reductione.	Then loosen it and have him rest from walking for many days, until it becomes tight and secure from the reduction.
¶ De speciebus dislocationis cum uulnere uel fractura.	On the kinds of dislocations with wound or fracture.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter XXXVI.
Quando accidit aliquid ex illo, et conaris curationem eius, et ipsius restaurationem, multotiens succedit mors: et propter illud non oportet, ut praesumat super curationem eius, quod est huiusmodi, nisi qui est prudens in arte longi usus, misericors, pius, tardus, non audax, neque praesumptuosus: et ut utatur in incaeptionce medicinis quae sedant apostemata calida tantum: et dimittat infirmum diuino iudicio.	When something happens from this, and you attempt its cure and restoration, many times death follows: and for that reason it is not fitting that one should presume to undertake the cure of this kind, unless he is prudent in the art, long-experienced, merciful, pious, slow, not bold, nor presumptuous; and that he may use in the inception medicines which pacify hot abscesses only; and dismiss the sick by divine judgment.
Nisi uideas, aut speras salutem a perditione cum lenitate aegritudinis, et in quo apparet quiddam spei.	Unless you see or hope for health from death with gentleness of sickness and in which something appears hopeful.
Conare ergo reductionem eius statim in principio rei, antequam accidat apostema calidum.	Therefore, attempt to reduce it immediately at the beginning of the matter, before a hot abscess occurs.
Si ergo redit membrum, secundum quod uolumus, tunc administra regimen quod sedat apostema: et cura uulnus cum eo quod conuenit ei ex unguentis desiccatiuis.	If therefore the limb returns, according to what we wish, then administer a regimen that soothes the abscess; and care for the wound with that which is fitting for it from drying ointments.
Quod si dislocatio est cum fractura, et accidunt in osse satagiae separatae, tunc conare ablationem earum, et fac in illo quod diximus in aegritudinibus simplicibus ex eo quod praecessit in locis earum.	If the dislocation is with a fracture, and there are fragments of bone separated, then try to remove them, and do what we said in simple ailments from that which preceded concerning their locations.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, et custodi teipsum ab introitu in uiam timoris: secundum quod praecessit praedicatio mea tibi.	And beware according to your strength, and guard yourself from entering the way of fear: according to what my proclamation has preceded you.
Nam illud est melius tibi apud Creatorem tuum, et magis permanens ad gloriam tuam, et magis saluum tuo corpori apud illos in tuo tempore.	For that is better for you before your Creator, and more enduring for your glory, and more healthful for your body among those who are with you in your time.
