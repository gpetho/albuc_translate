The author of this book said: O my children, when I completed this book for you, which is the theoretical part of medicine in its entirety, and reached the ultimate goal in its clarity and explanation, I saw fit to complete it for you with this treatise which is about the practical work by hand.
For skilled handiwork in our country and in our time is completely non-existent, to the point where its knowledge has almost been forgotten and its trace cut off.
Only slight traces of it remain in the books of the ancients, which hands have corrupted and in which errors and confusion have occurred until their meanings became locked and their benefits distant.
So I saw fit to revive it and compose this treatise about it in the way of explanation, clarification and conciseness, and to include illustrations of cauterization instruments and other tools of the work, as this adds to the clarity and is among the most important things needed.
The reason why there is no skilled craftsman with his hands in our time is because the medical craft is lengthy, and its practitioner needs to train beforehand in the science of anatomy which Galen described.
Until he understands the benefits of organs, their forms, their temperaments, their connections and separations, and knowledge of the bones, nerves, muscles, their numbers and exits, and the pulsing and still vessels and their exit points.
Therefore Hippocrates said that physicians in name are many but in deed are few, especially in handiwork, and we have mentioned some of this in the introduction of this book.
For whoever is not knowledgeable in what we mentioned of anatomy will inevitably fall into errors by which he kills people, as I have witnessed many times from those who imagined themselves in this science and claimed it without knowledge or expertise.
For I saw an ignorant physician who cut into a scrofulous tumor in a woman's neck, and severed some of the neck arteries, so the woman bled until she fell dead before him.
And I saw another physician who proceeded to extract a stone from an elderly man, and the stone was large, so he acted recklessly and extracted it with a piece of the bladder tissue.
The man died after about three days, and I had been called to extract it but saw from the size of the stone and the patient's condition what I estimated would happen to him.
And I saw another physician who was earning his living with one of the commanders of our country as a doctor.
A black boy in his care suffered a fracture in his leg near the heel with a wound, and the physician in his ignorance hastened to bind the fracture over the wound with bandages and splints, binding it tightly and not leaving the wound any breathing space.
Then he left him to his desires, then left him for days and ordered him not to loosen the bandage until his leg and foot became swollen and he approached death.
I was called to him and quickly loosened the bandage, so he found relief and recovered from his pains, except that corruption had already taken hold in the limb and I could not reverse it.
The corruption continued to spread in the limb until he perished.
And I saw another physician lance a cancerous tumor, and it ulcerated after days until its owner's affliction became severe, because when cancer is purely from black bile, it should not be approached with iron at all.
Unless it is in an organ that can tolerate complete excision.
Therefore, O my children, you should know that handiwork divides into two types: work accompanied by safety and work that leads to destruction in most cases.
And I have pointed out in every place that comes in this book the work that contains risk and fear, so you should beware of it and reject it.
Lest the ignorant find a way to criticism and reproach, so take for yourselves caution and vigilance, and for your patients gentleness and steadfastness.
Practice the superior path that leads to safety and praiseworthy outcomes, and avoid dangerous diseases that are difficult to cure.
Keep yourselves above what you fear might bring suspicion upon you in your religion and worldly affairs, for it is more lasting for your standing and more elevating for your worth in this world and the next.
For Galen said in some of his commandments: Do not treat an evil disease, lest you be called evil physicians.
And I have divided this treatise into three chapters.
The First Chapter.
On cauterization by fire and cauterization by caustic medicine, organized systematically from head to foot, including illustrations of instruments, cautery irons, and everything needed for manual operation.
And the Second Chapter.
On incision, lancing, bloodletting, cupping, wounds, extraction of arrows and such matters, all systematically organized with illustrations of instruments.
And the Third Chapter.
On setting bones, treating dislocations, sprains and such matters, systematically organized from head to foot with illustrations of instruments.
The First Chapter.
On Cauterization.
Before we discuss its practice, we should mention its benefits and harms, and in which temperament it should be used.
I say that the discussion of the nature of cauterization's benefits and harms is a lengthy discourse, a subtle science, and a hidden secret about which many wise men have spoken.
They differed in their views, and I have summarized their words briefly to avoid lengthy exposition.
I say that cauterization is generally beneficial for every imbalanced temperament, whether with material or without material, except for two temperaments: the hot temperament without material and the dry temperament without material.
As for the dry temperament with material, they differed about it - some said cauterization is beneficial for it, while others contradicted this, saying cauterization is not suitable for an illness caused by heat and dryness because fire's nature is hot and dry.
It is impossible to cure a hot and dry disease with a hot and dry remedy, but those who argue the opposite say that cauterization by fire can benefit a hot and dry disease that occurs in human bodies.
Because when you compare the human body and its moisture to the temperament of fire, you find the human body to be cold.
And I agree with this statement because experience has revealed this to me many times, however, one should not imagine this matter except for those who have trained and practiced extensively in cauterization.
And who understands the different temperaments of people and the nature of diseases themselves, their causes, symptoms, and duration.
As for the other temperaments, you need not fear them, especially cold and wet diseases, for all physicians agree on them and do not differ about the benefit of cauterization for them.
Know, my sons, that among the secrets of treatment is cauterization by fire and its superiority over cauterization by caustic medicine, because fire is a simple substance whose effect does not exceed the cauterized organ nor harm another connected organ except slightly.
Cauterization by caustic medicine may extend its effect to distant organs and might cause a disease in the organ that is difficult to treat and might even kill, while fire, due to its nobility and the excellence of its substance, does not do this unless used excessively.
This has become clear to us through experience from long service and attention to the craft and understanding of the truth of the matter.
For this reason, I have dispensed with lengthy discourse, and were it not inappropriate for this book of mine, I would have presented to you a profound secret about fire and how it acts upon bodies and eliminates diseases, with philosophical, demonstrative speech that would be too subtle for your understanding.
Know, my sons, that they have differed about the time suitable for cauterization, and they made spring the best time.
I say that cauterization may be suitable in any season because the harm occurring due to the season is overwhelmed by the benefit obtained through cauterization.
Especially if the cauterization is for necessary, strong, urgent pains that cannot tolerate delay for fear they might be followed by an affliction greater than the slight harm entering from the season.
Do not imagine, my sons, what the common people and ignorant physicians fancy, that cauterization which cures a disease will never allow its return and make it permanent.
The matter is not as they supposed because cauterization is like a medicine that alters the temperament and dries the moistures which are the cause of pain occurring.
However, cauterization is superior to medicine in the speed of its success, the strength of its action, and the power of its authority.
The disease may return at some time depending on the patient's temperament, the establishment of their illness and its strength, and what accumulates in their body of excess humors and their negligence in acquiring them from foods and such causes.
Unless the disease for which cauterization is used is mild and in an organ with little excess and moisture.
Like cauterizing a tooth for pain and such, for it is possible that pain may not return to it, and this occurs in the minority of cases.
As for the common saying that cauterization is the last resort in medicine, it is a correct statement but not for the reasons they believe, as they think that no treatment with medicine or otherwise is beneficial after cauterization, but the matter is contrary to this.
The meaning of "cauterization is the last resort in medicine" is that when we have used various types of treatments for an illness and those medicines did not work, then we use cauterization as a last resort and it works - this is why it is said that cauterization is the last resort in medicine.
Not in the sense understood by the common people and many ignorant physicians.
The ancients mentioned that cauterization with gold is better than with iron, and they said this because of gold's balanced nature and noble essence, and they said that the cauterized area does not suppurate, but this is not absolute.
Because I have tested this and found that it only works this way in some bodies and not others, and cauterization with it is better and superior to iron as they said, except that when you heat the cautery instrument in fire made of gold, you cannot tell when it is heated to the degree you want due to gold's redness.
And because it cools quickly, and if you increase its heat, it melts in the fire and dissolves, causing trouble for the practitioner, therefore cauterization with iron is quicker for us and closer to proper practice, God willing.
I have arranged this chapter on cauterization into sections organized from head to foot to make it easier for the student to find what they want, God willing.
First Section.
On single cauterization of the head.
This cauterization benefits from the dominance of moisture and cold in the brain, which are causes of headache and frequent discharges from the head to the eyes and ears, excessive sleep, tooth pain, and throat pains.
And in general, for every disease that occurs from cold such as paralysis, epilepsy, stroke, and similar diseases.
The procedure for this cauterization is to first order the patient to purge with a purgative medicine that cleanses the head for three or four nights according to what the patient's strength, age, and habits require.
Then order him to shave his head with a razor, then seat him before you cross-legged with his hands placed on his chest.
Then place the base of your palm on the base of his nose between his eyes, and where your middle finger ends, mark that spot with ink.
Then heat the olive-shaped cautery which is of this form.
If bone is exposed about the size of a pin head or a vetch seed, remove your hand; if not, reapply your hand with the same iron or another if it has cooled.
Until you see the amount of bone I mentioned to you, then take some salt, dissolve it in water, soak a piece of cotton in it and place it on the spot and leave it for three days.
Then apply cotton soaked in ghee and leave it until the scab from the burn falls off, then treat it with the quaternary ointment until it heals, God willing.
They have said that the longer the wound remains open, draining pus, the better and more beneficial it is.
Some mentioned that one should cauterize the skin to the bone and hold the cautery until some of the bone's thickness burns, then scrape away what was burned from the bone, then treat it.
Others said one should be thorough with the cauterization until it makes a strong impression on the bone until a piece of bone falls off like a carat or small disc, and they claimed that the head's vapors are released from that spot, and the wound should be left open for a long time.
Then treat until it heals, but I do not support these two types of cauterization at all except in some people and as a risk, and leaving it alone is better in my opinion and safer, because when it happens, the head weakens when its natural continuity is broken, as we have observed in other organs.
Especially when the patient's head is naturally weak, and the first type of cauterization is safer and better in my opinion, and it is what I use, so practice it and you will be safe, God willing.
Second Section.
On cauterization of the head also.
When chronic pain occurs in the whole head and persists with the patient, and they have used medicines, poultices, nasal drops, oils, and compresses, especially if they have already had the single cauterization we described and none of that benefited them, then observe.
If the patient's head is naturally strong in constitution and not weak, and they feel severe cold, then cauterize another spot slightly above the first one.
Then cauterize each horn of his head with a cauterization until the thickness of the skin is gone and the amount of bone we described is exposed.
And cauterize a spot at the back of his head in the place known as the axe, and lighten your hand in this one and do not expose the bone, for the patient will feel severe pain unlike the pain of all other head cauterizations, and I will mention this cauterization in its place.
The cautery used for the horns of the head and its back should be finer than the cautery used for the middle of the head, and this is its form.
Chapter Three.
On cauterization for non-chronic migraine.
If pain occurs in one side of the head with headache and the pain extends to the eye, then purge the patient with medicines that cleanse the head and use all the other treatments that I mentioned in the classification of diseases, and if that doesn't work, then cauterization can be done in two ways.
Either cauterization with sharp burning medicine or with iron.
As for cauterization with burning medicine, take a single clove of garlic, peel it and cut its ends from both sides, then make an incision at the site of pain in the temple with a wide lancet until there is space under the skin that can fit the clove.
Insert it under the skin until it disappears, then bind it firmly with bandages and leave it for about fifteen hours, then untie it and remove the garlic and leave the wound for two or three days, then apply.
Place cotton soaked in ghee on it until the site suppurates, then treat it with ointment until it heals, God willing. If you wish, you can do this with some of the burning medicines that I mentioned in the eighteenth treatise on burning medicines.
As for cauterizing it with iron, it is done in this manner: heat the cautery that looks like this:.
It is called the nail cautery because its head is like a nail with some doming and has a small protrusion in its middle.
Then place it on the site of pain and hold your hand while rotating the iron slightly, and the amount you burn should be about half the thickness of the skin.
Lift your hand so as not to burn the artery below which would cause bleeding, then soak cotton in salt water and place it on the site and leave it for three days.
Then apply cotton with ghee, then treat it with ointment until it heals, God willing.
If you wish, you can cauterize this migraine with the protruding knife-like end of the cautery, being careful not to cut the artery, especially in this non-chronic migraine.
Chapter Four.
On cauterization of chronic migraine.
If you have treated the migraine with what we mentioned of the previous treatment and what we mentioned in the classification of diseases, and the treatment doesn't work, and you see that the condition cannot be managed by what we mentioned of the first cauterization with medicine or cauterization with fire.
Then you should heat the knife-like cautery until it turns white, after marking the site of pain with a line half a finger long or so, and release your hand once while pressing firmly until you cut the artery and reach near the bone.
However, you should be careful of touching the jaw that moves during chewing so you don't burn the muscle or nerve that moves it, which would cause spasm.
Be cautious and vigilant about bleeding from the artery you cut, for there is risk in cutting it.
Especially for one who is ignorant of what to do and is not experienced and practiced - abandoning the procedure is preferable.
The management of bleeding that occurs from the artery will be mentioned properly in its place in the book, God willing. If you see that the condition cannot be managed by this cauterization.
And you see that the patient's body can tolerate it, then cauterize a spot in the middle of the head as we described and treat the wound until it heals, God willing.
If you wish, you can use the cauterization that we mentioned in the chapter on arterial extraction with the double-bladed cautery, for it is better and more effective than this.
Chapter Five.
On cauterization for ear pains.
If pain occurs in the ear due to cold and is treated with purgatives and other treatments that we mentioned in the classification but the pain doesn't go away, then heat the cautery called the point cautery that looks like this.
Then make points with it after heating it around the entire ear in a circle, or around both if the pain is in both.
Keep the cauterization slightly away from the base of the ear after marking the site with ink, and make about ten points of cauterization for each ear or thereabouts, then treat the sites until they heal, God willing.
Chapter Six.
On cauterization for facial paralysis.
The facial paralysis that is treated with cauterization is only of the type that occurs from phlegm as I mentioned in the classification of diseases.
And avoid cauterizing the type that occurs from dryness and nerve spasm.
When you have treated this type of facial paralysis with electuaries, nasal drops, and gargles and your treatment doesn't work, then the patient should be cauterized with three cauterizations.
One at the base of the ear, the second slightly below his temple, and the third at the meeting of the lips.
Make your cauterization on the opposite side of the diseased part because the relaxation occurs on the side that appears healthy.
The form of cauterization is that you cauterize a spot opposite the upper tip of the ear slightly below the horn of the head, and another in the temple, and its length should be about the length of a thumb.
Lower your hand with the cautery until you burn about half the thickness of the skin, and this is the image of the cautery which is a type of knife-like instrument previously illustrated, except it is slightly more delicate as you see.
The knife should be slightly thicker, then treat the area as previously mentioned until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Seven.
On Cauterizing Chronic Apoplexy.
When apoplexy becomes chronic and you have treated it as we mentioned but your treatment was not effective and the patient has no fever, then cauterize them with four cauterizations.
One cauterization on each horn of their head, one cauterization in the middle of the head as we mentioned, and one cauterization at the back of the head as previously described.
The description of the cauteries is as previously mentioned, and you may also apply a cauterization on the mouth of the stomach which would be more effective, then treat as previously mentioned.
Chapter Eight.
On Cauterizing Forgetfulness.
That which is caused by phlegm - the patient should first be given major purgatives and pills that purify the brain.
Then shave their entire head and apply the mustard plaster described in the chapter on plasters multiple times, for it is a type of cauterization.
Do this in the exact order I mentioned there, and if they are cured by this, fine, otherwise cauterize them with three cauterizations at the back of their head, arranged in a line from the top of the head to the bottom of the neck.
Make the space between each cauterization the width of a finger, then treat the cauterization as previously mentioned. If you want to increase and the patient can tolerate it, cauterize the middle cauterization.
If you want to increase further, cauterize on the horns then treat until healed, and the cautery should be olive-shaped as previously illustrated.
Chapter Nine.
On Cauterizing Paralysis and Total Body Relaxation.
You should first proceed with purifying the head with purgatives as we mentioned, then shave the patient's head, then cauterize once in the middle of the head, once on each horn of the head, and once on its back.
And three times on the vertebrae of the neck, and if you need more than that for the condition of body relaxation, and the patient can tolerate it and the disease is strong and established, then cauterize four times on the vertebrae of the back.
Press firmly with the cautery until you burn most of the skin then lift your hand, then treat as previously mentioned until healed God willing, and the cautery should be olive-shaped.
Chapter Ten.
On Cauterizing Epilepsy.
Only cauterize the epileptic whose epilepsy is caused by phlegm, and you should first purify their brain with major purgatives and with all the treatment we mentioned in the classification if the patient is adult and can tolerate taking medicines.
But if they are a child who cannot tolerate medicines, then use gargles and mouth washes that purify the brain for many days before that, while improving their nutrition.
Then shave their head then cauterize once in the middle of the head as previously described and another cauterization at its back.
And one cauterization on each horn of their head, and if the patient is strong and can tolerate it, apply the cauterizations mentioned for the paralysis and body relaxation patient on the vertebrae of the neck and back vertebrae, and the cautery should be olive-shaped as previously described.
If the patient is a child, make the cautery delicate like this illustration.
Chapter Eleven.
On Cauterizing Melancholia.
If the cause of melancholia is corrupt humors and thick phlegm, apply the cauterizations we mentioned for the paralysis patient.
If the cause of melancholia is excess tending toward black bile and the patient's body is moist, give them what purifies their brain as previously mentioned in the classification.
Then shave the patient's head then make a firm ring of linen like a circle then place it in the middle of their head while the patient sits cross-legged held from all sides, then take one pound of aged sheep butter.
Then heat it on fire moderately until a finger can tolerate being inserted in it, then pour it in the middle of the head in the circle and leave it until it cools, do this to the patient once every week along with the rest of their good regimen until they heal God willing.
And if you wish, cauterize with many small dots without holding your hand with the cautery but rather just hovering for this type of cauterization moistens the brain moderately.
Then apply cotton soaked in butter or chicken fat.
Chapter Twelve.
On cauterizing cataracts in the eye.
When you identify the beginning of a cataract in the eye through the signs mentioned in the classification, hasten to give the patient what purifies his head, protect him from all moistures, and make him sweat in the bath on an empty stomach for days.
Then order him to shave his head and cauterize once in the middle of the head, then cauterize twice on the temples if the beginning of the cataract is in both eyes, or on one side if it is in one eye.
Then cut with the cautery all the veins and arteries under the skin, and let the cauterizations be long across the temples, and guard against blood loss.
If you see any of it [bleeding], stop it immediately by whatever treatment possible, and we will come to the wisdom of extracting and cutting arteries and protecting against bleeding.
And two deep cauterizations should be made in the nape below the two bones.
Chapter Thirteen.
On cauterizing chronic tears.
If the eye tears are chronic and continuous, and they are caused by the veins and arteries that are on the outside of the head, and you are certain that this is from cold, thick phlegmatic excess, then cauterize as I described exactly in the beginning of cataracts.
One cauterization in the middle of the head and two on the temples and two in the nape below the two bones, and if you need more, cauterize once on each side of the tail of the eye at the end of the eyebrow with a small cautery.
Chapter Fourteen.
On cauterizing nose putrefaction.
If you have treated it with what we mentioned in the classification and the treatment wasn't successful, hasten to give the patient the quqaya for three nights, then shave his head and cauterize the middle cauterization with the olive-shaped cautery.
Then cauterize with the nail-shaped cautery twice above the eyebrows slightly below the hair and be careful of the artery not to cut it, and this is the shape of the nail-shaped one.
Chapter Fifteen.
On cauterizing drooping eyelids.
If the eyelid droops due to illness or moisture, cauterize the eyelid once with this crescent-shaped cautery.
And if you wish, cauterize slightly above the eyebrows twice on each side and stay away from the temples, and let each cauterization be along the length of the eyebrow.
Don't let your hand be excessive in cauterizing, but only enough to burn a third of the skin, and the shape of the cautery should be of this description.
Chapter Sixteen.
On cauterizing the eyelid.
If its eyelashes turn inward and prick the eye, there are two types of cauterization.
Either cauterization with fire or cauterization with burning medicine. As for cauterization with fire, order the patient beforehand to leave his eyelashes if he is someone who plucks them, until they grow long and even.
If they prick him when they grow, bind his eyes with a bandage so they don't move until they grow, and when they have grown and evened out, place the patient's head in your lap then mark on the eyelid with ink a mark in the shape of a myrtle leaf.
The mark should begin near the eyelashes, then place under the eyelid cotton soaked in egg white or psyllium mucilage, then heat a cautery of this shape.
Then cauterize over the shape you marked little by little many times until the surface of the skin which is in the shape of the myrtle leaf is all burned, especially its surface, and the sign of your work being correct is that you see the eyelid has retracted and the hair has risen from the flesh of the eye.
Remove your hand then and leave it for three days, then apply cotton with butter until the scab falls off, then treat it with ointment until it heals, God willing. If any hair returns after time and the eyelid droops.
Then repeat the cauterization on that spot as you did the first time. If the hair is in the lower eyelid, cauterize it until it returns to its natural position and the hair doesn't prick the eye. As for cauterization with burning medicine, order the patient to leave the eyelashes until they grow long and even.
Then make from paper the shape of a myrtle leaf, then take regular soap and unslaked lime, one dirham weight or so of each, and grind them together well, and do this quickly lest it dry.
Then spread it on the paper you made in the shape of a myrtle leaf and place it on one or both eyelids and place under the eye cotton soaked in egg white with the patient's head in your lap.
Place your index finger over the medicine and press it slightly while moving it whenever the patient feels a burning sensation from the medicine, for they will feel a burning like fire. As long as they feel the burning, leave the medicine and move it with your finger. When the burning subsides, remove the medicine and wash the eye with water.
Observe, and if you see the eyelid has risen as it rises during cauterization with fire or cutting - if not, reapply the medicine to the area where it hasn't taken effect and hasn't blackened until you complete your work and the eye is lifted. Then place cotton with butter on it until the burn crust falls off.
Then treat it with palm ointment or another until it heals. During the procedure, you must be extremely careful that none of the medicine falls into the eye. If the eyelid becomes loose after days and some hair grows into the eye,
Reapply the medicine to that specific loose area of the eyelid as you did initially, then treat it until it heals. This is the image of the myrtle leaf.
Know that people's eyes differ in size, small and large, so adjust your lifting accordingly. The correct way is not hidden from those who have experience in this craft.
Chapter Seventeen.
On Cauterizing the Fistula That Occurs in the Corner of the Eye.
If you have treated the fistula with what we mentioned in the classification of diseases and your treatment hasn't worked, then it should be cauterized in this manner.
Order the patient to place their head in your lap, and have an assistant hold their head firmly between your hands so it neither moves nor shakes.
Then place cotton soaked in egg white or psyllium mucilage on their eyes, then heat the cautery tool which is of this shape.
It should be hollow like an eagle's feather quill on one end where the cauterization occurs, and if you wish, the other end can be perforated, or if you prefer, it can be solid like a probe, though this hollow one is better for your work, God willing.
Then squeeze the fistula if it's open and extract the pus and dry it, or if it's not open, open it and extract its pus, then immediately place the very hot cautery on it and hold it steady until you reach the bone.
Keep your hand slightly away from the eye toward the nose during cauterization, lest your hand slip or the patient jerks and the cautery falls into the fat of the eye and damages it. If you reach the bone on the first cauterization, fine; if not, repeat with the cautery a second time if needed.
Leave it for three days, then apply cotton with butter and treat it with drying ointment until it heals. If forty days pass without healing, apply the sharp, caustic medicine until the bone is exposed and strip it as will be mentioned in its chapter, God willing.
Another method of cauterizing the fistula mentioned by some ancients: Proceed to the fistula site, cut it, then place in the cut itself a thin funnel of this shape.
Pour into it about one dirham's weight of molten lead and hold the funnel firmly and tightly, and the patient must not move at all lest the molten lead flow into their eye. You should place cotton soaked in egg white or water on the patient's eye.
For the lead burns the fistula site and heals it wonderfully. If the fistula heals with what we mentioned of cauterization and treatment, fine; if not, then it's necessary to perform nasal perforation and redirect the fistula to the nasal passage as will be mentioned in its specific place.
Chapter Eighteen.
On Cauterizing Lip Fissures.
Frequently fissures occur in the lip called the "hair-line," especially in children's lips where it often occurs. If you have treated this fissure with what we mentioned in the classification and the treatment hasn't worked, then heat a small knife-like cautery of this shape.
Its hollow should be as thin as a knife, then place it hot quickly into the fissure itself until the cauterization reaches the depth of the fissure, then treat it with cerates until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Nineteen.
On cauterizing fistulas occurring in the mouth.
If swelling occurs in the base of the gums, palate, or at the roots of the molars, then becomes purulent and bursts, and the flow of pus creates a fistula, and you have treated it but the treatment was not effective, then you should heat a cautery iron to the size that fits into the fistula.
Then insert it hot into the fistula opening and hold your hand steady until the heated iron reaches its depth and end, and do this once or twice, then treat it afterward with what we mentioned of treatment until it heals, God willing.
If the discharge stops and it heals, fine; if not, then the area must be exposed and the decayed bone removed according to what will come in its chapter, God willing.
Chapter Twenty.
On cauterizing teeth and loose gums.
If the gums become loose due to moisture and the teeth become mobile, and you have treated them with medicines without success, place the patient's head in your lap, then heat the cautery iron whose illustration will come after this, after placing the tube on the tooth.
Insert the hot cautery quickly through the tube and hold your hand briefly until the patient feels the heat of the fire reaching the root of the tooth, then lift your hand, then repeat the cautery several times as needed, then have the patient fill their mouth with salt water.
They should hold it for a while then spit it out, for the loose tooth will become firm and the loose gum will tighten and the corrupt moisture will dry up.
Chapter Twenty-One.
On cauterizing tooth pain.
If tooth pain is due to cold or if there are worms in it, and treatment with medicines has not been successful, then cauterization can be done in two ways: either cautery with clarified butter or cautery with fire.
As for cautery with clarified butter, take cow's clarified butter and heat it in an iron spoon or shell, then take cotton and wrap it around the end of a probe, then dip it in the heated clarified butter and place it quickly on the painful tooth and hold it until it cools.
Then repeat this several times until the power of the fire reaches the root of the tooth, and if you wish, you may dip wool or cotton in cold clarified butter and place it on the painful tooth and put the heated iron above it until the fire reaches the bottom of the tooth.
As for cauterizing it with fire, take a copper or iron tube with some thickness in its body so that the heat of the fire does not reach the patient's mouth, then heat the cautery whose illustration will come and place it on the tooth itself and hold your hand until the cautery cools - do this several times.
The pain will go away either that very day or another day, and following this cauterization, the patient should fill their mouth with good clarified butter and hold it for a while then spit it out, and this is the illustration of the cautery.
Cauterize with whichever end you wish and as circumstances allow, and this is the illustration of the tube.
Chapter Twenty-Two.
On cauterizing scrofula.
If scrofula is caused by phlegm and cold humors and does not respond to maturation by medicines, and you want quick maturation, heat the hollow cautery iron which has this illustration, with both ends open.
So the smoke can exit from the other end during cauterization, and place it hot on the swelling itself once and a second time if needed until it reaches the depth of the swelling, and if the swelling is small, make the cautery according to the size of the swelling.
Then leave it for three days and apply cotton soaked in clarified butter until what was burned by the fire goes away, then treat it with ointment and wicks until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Twenty-Three.
On cauterization for hoarseness of voice and shortness of breath.
If humors overwhelm the windpipe, especially if this occurs with coldness of temperament, the patient should first be purged with purgative medicines, then cauterize once in the hollow of the throat at the base of the larynx in the depressed area.
Be careful not to reach the larynx with the cauterization and burn only half of the skin, then cauterize another time at the joint of the neck at its last vertebra deeply, and the cautery should be nail-shaped according to the description that preceded.
Then treat it with what was previously mentioned until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Twenty-Four.
On cauterizing lung disease and cough.
If the cough and lung disease are due to cold humors, and the patient has neither fever nor consumption, and the disease is chronic, then cauterize with two cauterizations above the collarbones in the soft, hollow, depressed areas, and another cauterization in the middle of the chest between the breasts.
The cautery should be nail-shaped according to the previously shown form, and if you wish, your cauterization can be done as dots using the cautery called "the point" which was previously shown in the section about cauterizing ear pain, and the dots should be about thirty in number.
Then treat it as previously mentioned until it heals, and you can make a three-pronged cautery of this form, and the cauterization is hastened because you cauterize three burns at once, and this is the form of the cautery.
Chapter Twenty-Five.
On cauterizing the armpit.
If the head of the humerus is dislocated due to slippery humors, or if it doesn't stay in place when reset from its dislocation until it becomes habitual, returning then dislocating at the slightest movement as we have observed, then the dislocation should first be reduced.
Then the patient should lie on their back or on the healthy side, then lift the skin inside the armpit upward with the fingers of your left hand if the joint has dislocated inward.
Then heat the two-pronged cautery which is of this form.
Then cauterize the skin until it penetrates to the other side, and the cauterization pattern will be four burns, and it can be cauterized with a three-pronged cautery making the pattern six burns, and the prongs should be as thin as a rose thorn.
And this is the form of the three-pronged cautery.
One more can be added to this number making eight burns, then apply ground antimony with salt to the cautery, then require the patient to rest and not move the limb for a time until it strengthens, and if the dislocation is upward, which rarely occurs.
Cauterize above the shoulder with either one good nail-shaped cauterization or many dot cauterizations, for the joint will strengthen, the moisture will disappear, and the patient will heal.
Chapter Twenty-Six.
On cauterizing the stomach.
If cold and excessive moisture occur in the stomach until it deviates from its temperament, and catarrh to it increases, and it has been treated with various treatments without success, then the patient should lie on their back and extend their legs and arms, then cauterize with three cauterizations.
One cauterization below the xiphoid process by a finger's width with a nail-shaped cautery, and two cauterizations below on either side of the single cauterization so that the pattern of burns forms a triangle, and space them apart so they don't merge when they suppurate, and the depth of the cautery should be about two-thirds the thickness of the skin, and the pattern of the cauterizations should be.
Of this form and this exact measure, no more.
And if you wish, you may cauterize with one large cauterization in the middle of the stomach of this form.
And the cautery used for this single cauterization should be circular in shape, of this form.
And the stomach can be cauterized with dots for those who fear this cauterization, by marking dots on the stomach with ink to the extent you want, then cauterizing with a dotted cautery, then treat it with the previously mentioned treatment until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Seven.
On cauterizing the cold liver.
If pain occurs in the liver due to cold and moisture or due to thick wind until it deviates extremely from its natural temperament, and the patient has been treated with what we mentioned in the classification without success.
Then the patient should lie on their back and mark three cauterizations with ink in this form and this exact measure on the liver below the costal cartilages where the human elbow reaches.
And the distance between each cauterization should be the width of a finger, and the cauterization should be straight along the length of the body, and do not press your hand firmly with the cautery.
And the amount you burn of the skin's thickness should be half, no more, and the patient should be standing on their feet, but if they cannot stand then they should be lying down with legs extended and arms raised, and this is the form of the cautery.
And you can cauterize these burns with the knife-shaped cautery if you have gentleness and skill in the craft, and be careful not to go too deep in cauterizing lest you burn through the entire skin and burn the abdomen and reach the intestines, for the skin there is thin, so know this.
Chapter Twenty-Eight.
On treating liver tumor by cauterization.
When an abscess occurs in the liver and you want to know whether that tumor is in the liver tissue or in its membrane, if it is in the liver tissue, the patient feels heaviness and pain without sharpness.
And if it is in the liver membrane, there is severe sharpness with the pain, and if you see that physicians have failed to treat it, the patient should lie on their back, then mark the swollen area with ink.
Then heat the cautery iron in fire, which is the cautery that resembles a probe, and this is its form.
And cauterize it with one cauterization until the entire skin is burned and the cauterization reaches the membrane until all the pus comes out, then treat it with abscess treatment until it heals.
This type of cauterization should only be used by one who has long experience in medicine and has treated these diseases through repeated experience, only then should they proceed with such work, though in my opinion, leaving it alone is better.
Chapter Twenty-Nine.
On cauterizing pleurisy.
The ancients mentioned cauterization with birthwort roots for cold pleurisy in this manner: take one root of the dry long birthwort, the longest you can find, about the thickness of a finger, then dip it in oil and light it in fire.
Then make one cauterization between where the collarbone meets the neck, and two small cauterizations slightly below the jugular veins, angled toward the area under the jaw, and two large cauterizations above the breasts between the third and fourth ribs.
And also two cauterizations between the fifth and sixth ribs slightly angled backward, and another cauterization in the middle of the chest, another above the stomach, and three cauterizations from behind - one between the shoulder blades and two on the sides of the spine below the cauterization that is between the shoulders.
You should not press deeply with the cauterization, but rather keep it superficial on the skin as a warming; some of the ancients mentioned that some people used an iron cautery like a probe, heating it and inserting it between the ribs until it reached the tumor itself.
And extract the pus as we mentioned in liver tumor, but in this puncturing by cauterization there is risk: either the patient dies immediately or a permanent fistula develops in the area with no cure.
Chapter Thirty.
On cauterizing the spleen.
If you have treated the spleen disease with what we mentioned of treatment in the classification and your treatment wasn't successful, then cauterization for it is done in three ways, all of them correct; one of them is to make three or four cauterizations lined up along the length of the spleen.
In the form of liver cauterizations which we previously described, with the distance between each cauterization being about the thickness of a finger or slightly more, and the form of the cautery should be the same as we mentioned for liver cauterization, and don't press deeply with the cauterization, and the patient should be lying on their back.
The other approach is at the elbow, and you lift the skin opposite to the spleen where the patient's left elbow ends, and you lift the skin opposite to the spleen where the patient's elbow ends, and your lifting of the skin should be across the body so that the cauterizations fall along the length of the body.
Then insert the two heated skewers until they penetrate the skin from the other side, then remove the cautery so there will be four cauterizations, and if you wish you may cauterize with the other cautery that has three skewers.
Then treat the cauterized area after letting it discharge pus for many days, as this is more effective than all the previously mentioned treatments.
Chapter Thirty-One.
On cauterizing dropsy.
Cauterization only benefits especially in ascitic dropsy; if you have treated the patient with dropsy using the types of treatment we mentioned in the classification and your treatment wasn't successful, then you should make four cauterizations around the navel and one cauterization on the stomach.
And another cauterization on the liver and one on the spleen and two behind his back between the vertebrae, one opposite his chest and another opposite his stomach, and the depth of cauterization should be about the thickness of the skin, then leave the cauterization open to discharge pus for a long time.
And don't leave the patient without treatment after cauterization with what is necessary to combine both approaches for faster healing, and the form of the cautery used for the back should be nail-shaped as previously illustrated, and the one used for the back should be olive-shaped.
Chapter Thirty-Two.
On Cauterizing the Feet and Legs.
When they swell in dropsy and fill with yellow fluid, one should cauterize on the top of the foot in the depression between the little toe and ring toe.
Keep your hand steady with the cautery and do not twist it, then lift your hand and do not repeat it at all, for the yellow fluid will seep out, and the cautery should be in this form.
Then cauterize the legs with two burns on each leg, using the knife-like end of the cautery, making the cauterization along the length of the leg - one below the knee and another lower near the middle of the leg - and two burns on each thigh.
Leave the cauterization open without treatment for a long time so the fluid seeps out, then treat it with the rest of what we mentioned.
Chapter Thirty-Three.
On Cauterizing for Diarrhea.
When diarrhea is from cold and moisture until it weakens the retaining and digestive powers in the stomach and intestines, and this has been treated with various treatments without cure, and you see the patient can tolerate cauterization and has sufficient strength, then cauterize them with a large burn on their stomach.
As previously mentioned in stomach cauterization with the circular cautery, and four small burns around the navel with the fine nail-like cautery, and one large burn or two burns on the lower back above the coccyx.
If you see abundant moisture and the patient can tolerate it, then cauterize once on the pubic area and once on each flank, and you might add two small burns on the stomach near the large one, for it is a successful treatment that will not fail to benefit, God willing.
Chapter Thirty-Four.
On Cauterizing Hemorrhoids of the Anus.
When there are chronic multiple hemorrhoids in the anus, or a single one, caused by thick cold humors or corrupt moistures, and they have been treated with what we mentioned in the classification without success, then cauterize the patient with three burns on the lower vertebrae slightly below the table in a triangular pattern.
And one burn two fingers' width below the navel, and if you determine that their stomach has become cold and their food is not digesting, and you see their face is swollen, then cauterize them with a large burn on the stomach as previously mentioned, and a burn on their liver.
And another on their spleen with a nail-like cautery, and leave the cauterization open for a time, then treat it until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Thirty-Five.
On Cauterizing Warts.
After cutting them, when you have cut the wart, heat the probe-like cautery then insert it hot into the cut wart itself and keep your hand steady until the cautery reaches the mouth of the vessel from which blood flows, doing this once or twice.
If there are many warts, cauterize each one as we described, then treat them with suitable ointments until they heal, and if you also make a large cauterization on the lower back, it will be more beneficial.
Chapter Thirty-Six.
On Cauterizing Fistulas That Occur in the Anus and Its Surroundings.
If the patient does not accept the incision and procedure we described in its place and is afraid of that, sometimes it can be cured by cauterization. When someone develops a fistula and it becomes chronic, with pus and corrupt fluids flowing from it, first you should probe it with a thin probe.
Then know the extent of its depth with the probe, then heat the probe-like cautery and insert it hot into the fistula itself, following the straight path of the fistula's depth to the extent the probe entered, and repeat the cauterization until all those corrupt tissues are burned, once or twice or thrice as needed.
And be careful not to burn any nerves if present there, or large vessels, and if the fistula leads to the body of the bladder or to the body of the intestine.
Be careful of all these areas, and only do this when the fistula is in a fleshy area and you determine it is not penetrating, then treat the area until it heals. If the area seals and the discharge stops and remains so for a time, know that it has healed completely.
And if the discharge does not stop, know that it is penetrating or has corrupt bone in its depth or something similar that will be mentioned in its place.
Chapter Thirty-Seven.
On Cauterization of the Kidneys.
If pain occurs in the kidneys due to cold or thick wind, and because of this the patient's sexual function decreases, then you should cauterize on the loins over the kidneys themselves, one cauterization on each kidney with the nail-shaped cautery that was previously mentioned, and sometimes we cauterize a third time in the same area so there are three cauterizations in a row, which is more effective in benefit.
Chapter Thirty-Eight.
On Cauterization of the Bladder.
If weakness and laxity occur in the bladder due to cold and moisture until the patient cannot hold urine, then cauterize once below the navel over the bladder where the pubic hair begins, and once to the right of the navel and another to its left.
The cauterization after burning should be on each side about the size of a thumb joint, and cauterize once in the lower back or twice if you need that, and the cautery should be nail-shaped as mentioned before.
Chapter Thirty-Nine.
On Cauterization of the Uterus.
If matter occurs in the uterus from cold and moisture, and because of this conception is prevented and her menstruation is corrupted and its flow is difficult, or pain occurs when it comes, then you should make three cauterizations around the navel as we mentioned in the cauterization of the bladder.
And one cauterization on the lower back below the spine, or two, and the cautery should be nail-shaped.
Chapter Forty.
On Cauterization of Hip Dislocation.
Mucous fluids may flow to the hip socket, causing it to leave its position, and its sign is that the leg becomes longer than the other when you compare them to each other, and you find emptiness in the location of the dislocation, so you should cauterize the patient on the hip socket itself with a circular-like cauterization.
After marking with ink around the socket as it circles so the socket itself falls in the middle of the circle, and the cautery should be the one whose image was previously shown in stomach cauterization, and if this cautery is not available to you, then make three cauterizations with the large olive-shaped cautery.
And make the cauterization deep enough for the thickness of the entire skin, then treat it until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Forty-One.
On Cauterization of the Sciatic Nerve.
If pain occurs in the hip socket and its cause is cold and moisture, and you have treated the patient with what we mentioned in the classification and the treatment was not effective and it became chronic, then the patient should be purged of thick humors with stinking pills or aloe pills and the like.
Then cauterize him, and the method of cauterization in this case is of two types: either cauterization with burning medicines or cauterization with fire, and cauterization with fire can be done in many ways, one of which is to cauterize three triangular cauterizations on the hip socket itself in this pattern.
Make them appropriately deep, and the distance between each cauterization should be about the thickness of a finger, and the cautery should be olive-shaped, and sometimes a cauterization is made in the middle on the head of the hip itself, making four cauterizations, and if you wish, you can cauterize with the circle that was previously mentioned in the cauterization of hip dislocation as a single cauterization.
So that the circle encompasses the entire hip and burns the thickness of the entire skin. This is the description of cauterization in sciatica when the pain is confined to the hip itself and does not extend to the thigh and leg.
If it extends to the thigh and leg, then make two cauterizations on the thigh at the location where the patient indicates pain, and one cauterization above the heel tendon by four fingers slightly to the lateral side, and the cautery should be knife-shaped and the depth of the cauterization should be only as deep as the thickness of the skin.
And if he indicates that the pain extends toward the toes, then cauterize where he indicates with the point cautery three or four times or more if needed, and if he indicates pain below the knee toward the leg, then cauterize there with one knife-shaped cauterization.
And be careful in all your cauterizations not to reach with the burning to the point where you burn a major nerve or artery, as this would cause serious harm or disability to the patient.
And I have witnessed one and two of those who were cauterized above the heel tendon and the cauterization was excessive, so the leg became infected until the infection reached the foot and it all perforated and the entire leg was corrupted, then diarrhea and death occurred after that. If the pain is in both sides, cauterize them both in exactly this manner.
And some scholars among the wise men have mentioned regarding hip cauterization a cauterization whose description is as follows: make something like a cup from iron with its diameter being half a span, and at its mouth it should be as thick as a date pit or slightly less, and inside that cup is another cup and a third cup.
The distance between each cup should be about the size of a thumb joint, and the cups should be open from both sides, with a height of about one or two joints, and they should have an iron handle firmly fixed into the cups, and this is its form.
Then heat it in fire until it becomes red and sparks fly, then place it on the hip joint while the patient is leaning on their healthy side, and cauterize three circular burns at once, then leave it for three days and dress it with ghee and leave the wound open for many days.
The author of this book says: We rarely used this type of cauterization due to its ugliness and frightening appearance, and because we rarely find anyone who can endure it, although it is among the best cauterizations for those who can bear it and when applied to the correct spot.
As for cauterization with burning medicines, it is done by making two rings like the ones used for door latches, made of copper or iron.
Their edges should be raised about two joints or so, with a space between them about the thickness of a finger, and they should be open at both top and bottom, held together in this form.
Then lower it onto the hip joint while the patient lies on their healthy side, and grip firmly with your hand, then pour slightly heated caustic water between the two circles and hold it for about an hour in the sand clock, and the patient must endure its sting and burn, for it burns like fire.
Until the stinging subsides, then lift your hand with the instrument and wipe all the caustic water from the hip with fresh water, then leave it for three days and apply ghee until the burn blackness disappears, and leave it for days to discharge pus, for this is more beneficial.
Then treat it with ointments until it heals. If the pain extends to the thigh or leg, make a mold that holds water just as you did with the hip. This is the description of the caustic water, which I have recorded in the treatise on medicine preparation.
Take one part each of potash and unslaked lime, grind them and put them in a new pot with a single small hole pierced in its bottom, just large enough to insert a probe, and place another glazed pot under the bottom of the first pot.
Pour enough fresh water over the potash and lime to cover them by a finger's width after pressing them well with your hand, and leave the pot until the caustic water drains into the lower glazed pot, then collect all that water and pour it over fresh lime and potash again.
It will then become very strong in its caustic effect, useful in many medical procedures and in cauterizing various body parts as it acts exactly like fire. Among the medicines used to cauterize the hip are also thapsia, cashew honey, and lime mixed with soap as liniments.
Galen related a story about one of the ancients' treatment for hip pain and sciatica, greatly emphasizing its importance and claiming it needed no other treatment and would cure in a single application.
So much so that sometimes a patient would be carried into the bath and leave cured. It involves taking fresh harmel plant, or if unavailable, recent dried harmel, grinding it well with some fat and placing it on the hip where the pain is, or on the leg or thigh.
Bind it and leave it for about three hours or until the patient feels the burning sensation subside, then enter them into the bath. When their body becomes moist, put them in the pool, and the pain will go away and heal, God willing. If it doesn't heal, reapply the compress after ten days.
It will heal, God willing. Know that no one should use cauterization with these medicines except after purging the body. Dioscorides mentioned that goat droppings when used to cauterize sciatica are beneficial.
The cauterization is done in this manner: Take wool soaked in old oil and place it on the deep spot between the thumb and forearm, closer to the forearm, then take a dry goat dropping.
Ignite it with fire until it becomes like coal, then place it on the wool and leave it until it extinguishes, then take another and continue doing this until the sensation reaches through the upper arm to the hip and the pain subsides, God willing. This type of cauterization is called dung cauterization.
Chapter Forty-Two.
On cauterizing back pain.
Back pain occurs from many causes, either from a fall, a blow, excessive discharge, or similar causes, and it can be from the flow of cold, wet matter, and cauterization is only applicable in this type alone.
After purging the patient with stinking pills and the like, for pain caused by the flow of cold matter, you should cauterize their back where the pain is in three rows across the width of the area itself, after marking the location with ink, with five cauterizations or more in each row depending on what you see of the patient's tolerance and strength.
The cauterization should be done with a dot cautery, and if you wish, you can cauterize three or four times with a medium-sized nail cautery of this shape.
Chapter Forty-Three.
On cauterizing the beginning of a hump.
This condition often occurs in young children, and the sign of its beginning in the child is that they experience shortness of breath when standing and moving, and you find in their lower vertebrae a protruding vertebra that stands out from the rest.
When you see this and want to stop it, cauterize it with a circular cautery of this shape.
So that the cauterization covers each side of the vertebra evenly, and if you wish, you can cauterize around the vertebra with a dot cautery in two or three rows, with the dots close to each other, then treat the area until it heals as we mentioned.
Be careful not to use cauterization in humps caused by nerve spasms.
Chapter Forty-Four.
On cauterizing gout and joint pains.
When joint pains are caused by cold humors flowing to any part of the body, and when the pains occur in the feet, doctors typically call this gout specifically.
If cold-caused gout is treated with the types of treatment we mentioned in the classification and the pains do not go away, then cauterization will remove them by cauterizing around the foot joint with many cauterizations after purging, using a medium-sized olive-shaped cautery of this shape.
If you need to make dots on the top of the foot, do so with a dot cautery, and if the pains rise to the knees or other joints, which often happens, cauterize each knee with three or four cauterizations on each side with this same olive-shaped cautery.
If more cauterization than this is needed, do it but don't press your hand deeply with the cautery - just to the thickness of the skin only, and if the pains rise to the hips or back, use what we mentioned about cauterization in its chapter.
If the pains are in the hands only, make dots around the forearms in two circular rows, and if the pains remain in the fingers, make a dot on each knuckle and on the metacarpus, and if the pains rise after days to the elbows or shoulders.
Cauterize them from each side, and the patient should not be without good management and taking medicines, for if they improve their diet and purge the phlegm, they will heal with this cauterization, God willing.
Chapter Forty-Five.
On cauterizing hernias.
If a hernia occurs in the groin and some intestine and omentum descend to the testicle, and this is recent and new, you should order the patient to stop eating that day and to use laxatives to move the stool from their bowels.
Then they should lie on their back before you, and you order them to hold their breath until the omentum or intestine protrudes, then return it with your finger, then mark with ink below the hernia on the pubic bone a mark resembling a half-circle with its ends pointing toward the upper body.
Then heat a cautery of this shape.
Until it becomes white and throws sparks, then return the intestine or omentum to the cavity, then have an assistant place his hand on the spot so the intestine doesn't protrude, and you have spread the patient's legs and placed a pillow under them, and another assistant ties their legs.
And another on their chest holding their hands, then lower the cautery onto the mark itself with your hand holding the cautery upright and steady, and hold it until you reach the bone or repeat it again if you didn't reach the bone with the first attempt.
And be very careful to prevent intestinal protrusion during cauterization lest you burn it, which would cause either death or great affliction for the patient. Know that if your cauterization doesn't reach the bone, your procedure won't succeed. The cautery iron for children should be delicate according to their size, and for adults according to their size.
Then treat the cauterized area after three days with clarified butter until the fire's scab falls off, then treat it with other ointments until it heals. The patient should lie on their back for forty days until the wound closes.
Their diet during treatment should be what softens their bowels, lest the intestine protrudes during straining and defecation. Then when they want to stand after forty days, use a firm bandage and maintain it for another forty days, and reduce strain, fullness from food and drink, and loud shouting.
For if this regimen is followed thus, complete healing will occur, God willing. I will mention the treatment of hernias by incision in its chapter, God willing. As for hernias that occur elsewhere in the abdomen and are beginning, if you want to prevent its increase, cauterize the hernia with a circular cauterization according to its size.
The amount of skin you burn should be about two-thirds of it, then treat it as we mentioned, and it will not increase, God willing. Some ancients have mentioned cauterizing the hernia with a triangular cautery of this shape.
After marking the hernia with ink, place the horizontal line at the upper side of the hernia and the other line below, and lower your hand in the middle with a single nail-shaped cauterization. The first cauterization method is easier and better, God willing.
Chapter Forty-Six.
On Cauterizing Sprains.
When pain occurs in some limbs from a fall or blow and that pain persists for a long time and treatment with medicines doesn't succeed, it should be cauterized with a point cautery, and the cauterization of each limb should be according to its size, whether large or small, and its weakness or strength.
If the pain and sprain are established in it, then if it heals from the first cauterization, good; if not, repeat the cauterization, because it is the nature of these pains to move from the limb to what's near it, so you should follow them with cauterization until the patient heals.
Chapter Forty-Seven.
On Cauterizing Leprosy.
As for lepers, they benefit greatly from cauterization, especially the type of leprosy that comes from putrefied phlegm and black bile.
When you want to cauterize it, observe: if the leprosy is beginning and you've treated it as we mentioned in the classification, and it hasn't diminished or stopped, and you fear for the patient that corruption will overtake their entire temperament, then cauterize five cauterizations on the head.
One in the known middle of the head, the second lower toward the forehead at the hairline, two on the temples, and one behind on the hollow of the nape, and press your hand with the cautery a little until it affects the bone slightly.
And scales fall from it to facilitate the release of thick vapors from it, and also cauterize once on the spleen itself as previously mentioned. If the leprosy has persisted in the patient and appeared clearly, you should make these cauterizations we mentioned in the head.
And one cauterization on the tip of the nose, two on the cheeks, two on the vertebrae of the neck, six on the vertebrae of the back, one large one on the coccyx at the base of the tail, another above it on the table itself, and two on the hips, one on each hip.
And two on the knees, one on each knee, two on the shoulders, two on the elbows, two on the chest bones, and cauterize each joint of their fingers and toes with one cauterization, and on each ankle of their feet and wrists of their hands.
And be careful of the nerve that's on the back of the ankles lest you burn them. And cauterize once on the pubic bone, another on the mouth of the stomach, and another on the liver. Know that the more cauterization you add, the more beneficial and effective it will be.
Know that the patient doesn't feel the pain of cauterization as a healthy person would because their body has become numb. The cautery irons should be in size according to the limbs and joints as previously mentioned in the descriptions of the irons.
Then treat the cauterization with bitter vetch flour with honey and other treatments until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Forty-Eight.
On cauterizing numbness: When a body part becomes numb and is treated with medicines, oils, and compresses but does not heal, then cauterize the numb part itself with cauterizations according to what the size of the organ deserves, whether large or small, and let your cauterization penetrate slightly into the thickness of the skin.
Then treat it with ointment until it heals, and sometimes numbness that occurs in the hand and foot is cauterized in the vertebrae of the back at the exit point of the nerve that moves that organ, and the numbness disappears.
And none should attempt this except one who is knowledgeable in anatomy and the exit points of the nerves that move the body.
Chapter Forty-Nine.
On cauterizing vitiligo.
When vitiligo persists and no medical treatment works for it, then cauterize it with a cauterization that goes slightly deep according to the thickness of the skin until the whiteness goes away and its color changes.
Then treat it with lentil flour with rose oil and plantain leaves and pigeon blood or swallow blood, one part of each, mix everything and apply it on a cloth and keep it on the area until it heals.
Chapter Fifty.
On cauterizing cancer.
When cancer is in its early stages and you want to stop it, cauterize around it with a circular cautery as it goes around, and some wise men have mentioned cauterizing intensely in its center, but I don't recommend this as I expect it to ulcerate, and I have witnessed this multiple times.
The correct approach is to cauterize around it in a circle as we said or with multiple cauterizations.
Chapter Fifty-One.
On cauterizing abscess.
When someone develops an abscess that is slow to mature, either due to the causative excess or due to the patient's age if they are elderly with little blood, or due to the season, and you want to hasten the maturation of the abscess, cauterize around it with many small cauterizations in a dotted pattern.
Then leave it, for it will quickly mature, and if you want to lance it with cautery, heat the cautery tool of this shape.
And insert it in the center of the abscess until it penetrates the skin, and let the cauterization be toward the bottom to facilitate pus drainage, then treat it as necessary until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-Two.
On cauterizing gangrene.
Gangrene is corruption that spreads in the organ and consumes it as fire consumes dry wood, so if you see gangrene in a location that can tolerate cauterization by fire, heat many nail-shaped cauteries, both small and large, according to what is suitable for that location where the gangrene is.
Then cauterize it from all sides until all the corruption is eliminated and nothing remains of it at all, then leave it for three days and apply ground sulfur with oil to the cauterized areas until all the scab and all the corruption falls off.
Then treat it with flesh-growing ointments, and if after three days you see that the flesh is growing healthily without corruption, fine, otherwise repeat the cauterization on the remaining corrupted areas, and gangrene can be treated with caustic medicine.
For it serves the purpose of fire, working faster, and I have mentioned its treatment with caustic medicine in the classification, so take it from there when you need it.
Chapter Fifty-Three.
On cauterizing inverted and non-inverted corns.
Often this condition occurs in the soles of the feet and it is something rough that causes pain to the foot, and cauterization for it is of two types: either cauterization by fire or cauterization by caustic water.
As for cauterization by fire, it is to heat the hollow cautery that resembles a vulture's feather, made of iron according to what surrounds the corn from all sides, and it should be thin-edged, then lower it hot onto the corn, then rotate your hand with the cautery around the corn until the cautery reaches the depth of the corn.
And leave it for three days until it starts to suppurate, then dress it with wild mallow pounded with salt and leave the dressing on it overnight, for it will be uprooted from its roots, then treat the wound site with flesh-growing ointment until it heals, and if the corns are not inverted.
And often they occur on the surface of the body, especially on the hands and feet, then you should take a tube of copper or iron or vulture's feather and lower it onto the corn or wart, then pour a small amount of caustic water into the tube.
Hold your hand while rotating it with slight pressure from your hand so that the edge of the tube affects the base of the nail, allowing the sharp water to find its way to penetrate to the base of the nail, and the patient should endure the sting of the sharp water for a while.
Then leave it, for the nail will be uprooted with its roots. Do this one by one until you have treated all of them in the body, then treat their sites after removal with flesh-growing ointments.
Chapter Fifty-Four.
On Cauterizing Shivers.
If someone experiences shivers from cold in the nerves or from quartan fever or otherwise, you should cauterize them with four or five cauterizations on the vertebrae of the back, with a cauterization between each vertebra, and one cauterization on their chest.
And one cauterization on their stomach with the olive-shaped cautery, for the shivers will calm and the cold illness will quickly mature.
Chapter Fifty-Five.
On Cauterizing Pustules Occurring in the Body.
Ugly pustules may appear in the body from cold, thick, corrupt matter, so at their first appearance, you should cauterize each pustule's head with a gentle cauterization using a myrtle stick whose tip has been ignited by fire, or with long birthwort root, or with a lentil-shaped cautery.
Boils can be cauterized at their first eruption in this manner, so they won't increase, and the causing excess will disperse, and the patient will recover - though this should only be done after bleeding the patient.
Chapter Fifty-Six.
On Cauterizing Bleeding That Occurs When Cutting an Artery.
Often bleeding occurs from an artery that has been cut during an external wound, or when cutting open a tumor, or cauterizing a limb, and similar cases, making it difficult to stop.
If this happens to someone, quickly place your index finger on the mouth of the artery and press it firmly until the blood is contained under your finger and nothing comes out, then place several small and large olive-shaped cauteries in the fire and blow on them until they become very hot.
Then take one of them, either small or large depending on the wound and the location where the artery has burst, and place the cautery directly on the vessel after quickly removing your finger, and hold the cautery until the bleeding stops.
If blood spurts when you lift your finger from the artery's mouth and extinguishes the cautery, quickly take another cautery from those prepared in the fire, and continue doing this one after another until the bleeding stops.
Be careful not to burn any nerve that might be there, lest you cause another affliction for the patient, and know that when an artery bleeds, stopping it is not possible, especially if the artery is large, except by one of four ways: either by cauterization as we said, or by cutting it if it hasn't been cut completely.
For if it is cut, its ends will contract and the bleeding will stop; or it can be tied firmly with threads; or medications that stop bleeding can be applied along with firm bandaging with compresses.
As for those who try to stop it with a bandage or by binding with rags or applying burning substances and the like, it will never stop by these means except rarely, and if this happens to someone and no physician or medicine is present, they should immediately place their index finger on the wound opening itself as we described.
And press it very firmly until the blood is contained, and pour extremely cold water continuously over the wound and on the artery while the finger remains in place, until the blood congeals, thickens, and stops, and during this time consider what is needed in terms of cauterization or medication.
Book Two.
On Incision, Lancing, Bloodletting, Wounds, and Similar Matters.
Khalaf said: We have mentioned in the first book every disease in which cauterization by fire and burning medicine is suitable, along with its causes, reasons, instruments, and forms of cauteries, and I arranged it in chapters from horn to foot.
And I will follow in this book the exact same approach to make it easy for the student to find what they seek.
Before I begin with that, you should know, my sons, that this book contains more risk than what was in the first book on cauterization.
Therefore, greater caution is needed in this matter, as work in this field often involves the loss of blood which sustains life, whether through opening a vein, incising a tumor, draining an abscess, treating a wound, removing an arrow, cutting for bladder stones, and similar procedures which all carry risk and fear, and in many cases result in death.
I advise you against falling into matters of uncertainty, for in this craft you will encounter various types of people with different ailments. Among them are those who have grown weary of their illness and care not for death.
Due to the severity of their illness and long suffering, and the disease shows signs indicating death. And among them are those who offer you their wealth and would enrich you hoping for health, while their disease is fatal. You should not assist anyone who comes to you with these characteristics at all.
Let your caution be greater than your desire and eagerness, and do not proceed with any of this except with certain knowledge that confirms to you a favorable outcome, and in all your treatment of patients, employ prognosis and warning about what will lead to safety.
For in this you will find help in gaining praise, glory, remembrance, and commendation. May God inspire you, my sons, with His guidance and not deprive you of correctness and success, for that is in His hands, there is no god but He.
I have arranged this chapter in sections as previously done in the chapter on cauterization, from horn to foot, to make it easier for you to find what you want from it, God willing.
Chapter One.
On treating water that collects in children's heads.
This ailment frequently occurs in children at birth when the midwife presses the child's head without gentleness, and it may also occur from an unknown hidden cause.
I have not seen this condition in anyone but children, and all whom I saw among them died quickly, therefore I saw fit to abandon treating it. Indeed, I saw among them a boy whose head was filled with water and the head grew larger every day.
Until the boy could not sit up by himself due to the size of his head, and the moisture kept increasing until he perished.
This moisture either collects between the skin and bone or collects under the bone on the membrane, and the procedure for this, if the moisture is between the skin and bone and the swelling is small, is to make a single transverse incision in the middle of the head, with the length of the incision about two knots until the moisture drains, and this is the form of the lancet.
If the moisture is more and the swelling greater, make two intersecting incisions in this form:
If the moisture is under the bone, and its sign is that you see the head's sutures open from all sides and the water sinks when you press it with your hand inward, and this is not hidden from you, you should make three incisions in the middle of the head in this form.
After the incision, remove all the moisture, then bind the incisions with cloths and pads, then dress it from above with wine and oil until the fifth day, then undo the bandage and treat the wound with wicks and ointments, and do not cease binding the head moderately, and feed the patient every dry food with little moisture.
Until the limb strengthens and heals, and another description of the incision is to look where the swelling appears most prominent and where water collects, for it may be more in the back of the head or in its front or on the right or on the left.
Then aim your incision where the swelling and water collection appears to you, and make the incision as you can, and be careful not to cut an artery causing bleeding that would lead to the patient's death from that bleeding along with the draining of moisture.
Chapter Two.
Cutting of the two arteries behind the ears known as the pulsating ones.
When someone suffers from acute catarrh in the eyes or chest that becomes chronic and medicine does not help, the most effective treatment is cutting these two arteries.
If you want to cut them, you should first shave the patient's head with a razor, then rub the area with a rough cloth to make the artery visible, then tighten the patient's neck with their excess garment, then look for where the vessel pulsates. Their locations are in the two depressed areas behind the ears, and they are rarely hidden except in some people.
Then mark them with ink, then cut them with the sharp scalpel down to the bone, doing this across the head. If you wish, you can insert the scalpel from under the artery and pull it upward while cutting, and the length of the cut should be about two fingers pressed together.
When the vessel is cut, the blood will emerge in a pulsating manner, leaping forward in regular spurts. If the artery is not visible to touch, you should measure three fingers' width from the ear, then mark with ink and cut to the bone. What you should do is...
Release about six ounces of blood on average, though sometimes more or less depending on what you observe of the patient's strength and the fullness of their arteries. Then examine the wound, and if any membrane remains on the bone, cut it away.
To prevent hot inflammation, pack the wound with a linen wick, then treat it with ointments until it heals.
Chapter Three.
On Extracting the Arteries in the Temples.
When a person suffers from chronic migraine or acute catarrh due to sharp humors and heat in the temple muscles, or severe chronic headache and the like, and various medical treatments have been tried without success, we have found success in these diseases by extracting the arteries from the temples or cauterizing them as we described.
The procedure for extraction is to shave the hair at the temples and locate the visible artery in the temple, which you can identify by its pulse, and it is rarely hidden except in rare individuals.
Or during severe cold. If it's hidden from you, have the patient tighten their neck with their excess garment, then you rub the area with a cloth or apply hot water compresses until the artery becomes clearly and distinctly visible.
Then take the scalpel which is of this form.
Then carefully separate the skin until you reach the artery, then insert a hook and pull it upward until you extract it from the skin and free it from the membranes beneath it from all sides. If the artery is thin, twist it with the tip of the hook.
Then cut off a portion of it sufficient for its ends to separate and contract without causing hemorrhage, for if it is not severed and cut, the blood will not stop at all. Then drain between three to six ounces of blood.
If the artery is large, you should tie it in two places with strong doubled thread, either silk or lute strings so that rot doesn't set in before the wound heals, which would cause bleeding.
Then cut the excess between the two ties, doing this either immediately or after some time. If you prefer to cauterize it to the bone with a knife-shaped cautery until its ends are severed, this serves the same purpose or better, as we said.
Unless the patient has fever or hot temperament, because cauterization helps eliminate fluids and thus becomes more beneficial. After extracting the arteries, the area should be packed with old cotton, firm pads placed over it, and after releasing, treated with dry medications that grow flesh and with wicks until it heals, God willing.
If bleeding occurs during your procedure from the artery, hasten to cut it either by cauterization or by filling the area with vitriol and pressing with your hand until the blood stops. If none of these are available to you, place your finger until the blood clots.
Pour very cold water on the area until the intensity subsides and bind it as necessary. What is lighter and easier than extracting the artery is to cauterize the vessel with this two-bladed cautery after marking the spots with ink.
Lower it very hot until it reaches the bone and cuts the vessel in two places so that its ends separate, for it will never heal with this cauterization. This is the form of the cautery.
The two blades should be sharp like small scissors but much less sharp than a knife, because if they were as sharp as knives, they would cool quickly and not cut the flesh rapidly. When they have some thickness, they retain the heat of the fire.
And cut the flesh quickly. This procedure is better than all others and lighter and easier. The distance between the two blades should be about the thickness of a finger.
Chapter Four.
On treating the continuous flow of hot tears to the eyes.
When tears are continuous and their flow comes from the vessels on the outside of the skull, and no medical treatment with medicines helps, and you see the patient's face has reddened.
And they feel in their forehead a crawling sensation like ants, and their eyes are emaciated and moist, their eyelashes have eroded and their eyelids are irritated from the sharpness of tears, so the ancients were compelled to treat it with this procedure which they call treatment by the sword, which is to order the patient to shave the hair on their forehead.
Then make three parallel incisions along the length of the forehead, with each incision being about two fingers long, the first incision parallel to the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, the second slightly away from the movement of the temple muscle, and the third on the other side.
And be careful not to cut the two arteries on the sides and keep your hand away from the jaw connection, and the distance between each incision should be three fingers pressed together, and have prepared pieces of sponge or many dry cloths ready to absorb the blood.
Then insert the double-edged scalpel which is of this form.
From the incision near the temple to the middle incision, and use it to separate all the skin between the two incisions along with the membrane on the bone, then do the same from the middle incision to the third incision, then remove this scalpel.
And insert into the first incision another tool called a knife that is sharp on one side and smooth on the other side, and this is its form:.
And position its sharp side upward toward the flesh attached to the skin and its smooth side toward the bone, and push it until it reaches the middle incision, and cut with it all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes without the cutting reaching the outer skin.
Then do the same from the middle incision to the other incision, and after a moderate amount of blood flows, squeeze the areas to remove clotted blood, then place in each incision a wick of old cotton and put on it a compress that has been moistened with wine and oil or vinegar and oil.
To prevent hot inflammation, and on the third day remove the bandage and apply frequent fomentation with lukewarm water, then treat it with basilicon ointment with rose oil and whatever else you treat wounds with until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Five.
On treating tears and catarrhs flowing to the eyes from inside the head.
When someone experiences frequent, sharp, burning catarrhs continuously, and you see their eyes emaciated and small, with weakened vision and ulcerated eyelids, and their eyelashes have fallen out.
And there is a sharp, painful ache in the depth of the head and consecutive sneezing, know from these symptoms that these substances and catarrhs come from many deep vessels, and the best treatment for them is this treatment, which is to order the patient to shave their forehead then make a single incision in the middle of the forehead.
Or slightly higher across, and begin the incision from the left temple to the right temple, and let the incision be to the bone, and keep your hand away from the moving temple muscles used in chewing until when the bone is exposed and all blood is absorbed with the sponge.
Then separate between the lips of the incision with old cotton or linen wicks, then bind from above with compresses and soak the compresses with wine and oil to prevent hot inflammation, and when you remove them and see that the hot inflammation has decreased, you should scrape the bone until flesh begins to grow in it.
Then treat it with the drying regimen that grows flesh, such as taking two parts wheat flour and four parts colophony and preparing from them an ointment and using it for flesh growth in such wounds.
Chapter Six.
On treating what falls into the ear.
All that falls into the ear is one of four types: either mineral stone or stone-like materials such as iron and glass, or plant seeds like chickpeas and date pits and similar things, or liquid substances like water and vinegar and the like.
And either animals, so when a pebble or something similar falls into the ear that doesn't expand in the ear, face the ear toward the sun and if you see the pebble, drop in some violet oil or sesame oil, then try to remove it by moving the head or causing sneezing with hellebore.
Block the nostrils when the sneeze comes after placing a ring of rags or wool around the ear and pull the ear upward, as it often comes out with this treatment. If it doesn't come out, then try to remove it with the fine forceps that looks like this.
If it comes out with the forceps, good, but if not then try to remove it with a fine blunt hook with slight curvature. If it doesn't come out with that, then make a tube of copper and insert the end of the tube into the ear hole carefully.
Seal around the tube with wax softened with oil so there is no path for air except through the tube, then draw strongly with your breath and it often comes out this way. If it doesn't come out with what we described, then take a small amount of Nabataean gum or prepared bird-lime and put it on the end of the probe.
After wrapping it tightly with cotton, insert it gently into the ear hole after drying the ear of moisture. If it doesn't come out with all we described, then proceed to make an incision before inflammation or spasm occurs.
The method of incision is to first bleed the patient from the cephalic vein and remove blood according to their strength, then seat the patient before you and turn their ear upward and make a small crescent-shaped incision at the base of the ear near the lobe in the depressed area.
Make the incision crescent-shaped until you reach the pebble, then extract it with whatever instruments possible, then stitch the incision immediately and quickly and treat it until it heals.
As for if the thing that fell in the ear is one of the seeds that swells and expands, try to remove it with what we mentioned. If it doesn't come out, then take a thin, fine lancet of this shape.
Try to cut that type of seed that has fallen into the ear, and you should only do this when you are certain that the seed has been moistened by the ear's vapor until you can break it into many small pieces, then remove them with the blunt hook or fine forceps or by suction.
As we mentioned, this makes their removal easier. As for water that has entered the ear, the patient should first use hellebore to induce sneezing while filling their ear with some old cotton and lying on the side of the ear with water in it, and if it comes out this way.
If not, then take many stones the length of fingers, thin and smooth, warm them slightly with fire, and have the patient insert one into their ear hole and hop on one leg from that side and strike another stone against the stone in the ear.
Keep doing this stone by stone until all the water comes out. The water can also be removed by taking a piece of papyrus or a feather and inserting one end into the ear and lighting the other end with fire until most of it burns, then use another feather.
Do this several times until all the water comes out, or draw it out with the tube as previously mentioned for the pebble. As for removing animals that have entered it, observe - if it is small-bodied like a flea or similar, treat it as mentioned in the classification and as for.
If its body is large and visible to the senses, try to remove it with forceps and hooks - it is easier than all other things that get stuck in the ear. As for removing worms that develop in the ear, if you have treated them with what we mentioned in the classification in the chapter on drops and your treatment wasn't successful.
You should look at the ear in the sun, and if any worms appear to you, remove them with forceps or fine hooks. If none appear to you, then take a tube that looks like this.
Narrow at the bottom, wide at the top, insert the thin end into the ear as much as the patient can tolerate, then suck strongly with it. Do this several times until all the worms come out. If they don't respond to extraction, seal around the tube with wax as I mentioned to you regarding the stone.
If they don't come out with what we mentioned, then use the drops that I mentioned which the ancients have tried for killing worms. You will find this in the treatise on drops. Pour the oils and medicines into the ear using this instrument, and this is its image:
As you see, make it from silver or copper, narrow at the bottom with a small hole, wide at the top. If you wish, the plunger inside the tube can be made of fitted copper, or if you prefer, take a probe and wrap cotton tightly around its tip.
Then pour the oil, extract, or whatever medicine you want into the tube while it's in the ear, then insert the cotton-tipped probe from above and press with your hand moderately until the oil is pushed into the ear canal and the patient feels it.
The liquid you pour into the ear should be slightly warmed by fire. Beware of putting anything too cold or too hot into it, as the ear cannot tolerate that.
Chapter Seven
On treating blockage occurring in the ear.
Some children are born from their mothers' wombs with their ear canals not perforated.
Some people also develop blockage in the ear canal from wounds or flesh growing in it, and this blockage may be deep in the ear canal where sight cannot reach it.
It may also occur closer to the outer opening of the hole where sight can reach it. That which occurs deep in the ear and cannot be seen is in most cases difficult to cure, while that which can be seen should be treated by placing the patient's ear in the sun.
Look into it, and if you see the blockage clearly, open it with a fine scalpel of this form:
Its tip should have some width, slightly sharpened on one side, while the rest of the scalpel should be smooth on both sides so as not to harm the ear. If the blockage is from flesh that has grown in the ear canal, hold it with a fine hook and cut it very gently until all the flesh is removed.
If the blockage is deep in the ear, take a smooth fine probe, warm it slightly in fire, then insert it into the ear canal. If you feel the blockage, along with what the patient experiences of hearing heaviness, attempt to lance it gently.
Be careful not to wound the ear nerve, then place in the ear a wick sized according to the width of the hole, having smeared it with Egyptian ointment. Do this for days until you are safe from the wound healing closed, or take a wick, moisten it with water and sprinkle ground vitriol on it.
Use this, and if you see the ear has become inflamed with hot swelling, you should remove the wick and replace it with another wick that has been smeared with cerotum made with rose oil until the hot swelling subsides, then treat it until it heals.
If bleeding occurs, dip a sponge or cloth in cold water and place it on the ear, and use the rest of the treatment that stops bleeding mentioned in the treatise on drops.
Chapter Eight
On treating warts that occur on the eyelids.
These warts that occur on the eyelids may be moist or dry. You should hold them with forceps or a hook and cut them from their roots with a scalpel, then apply ground vitriol to the spot.
If they bleed, cauterize them with a fine lentil-shaped cautery. Cauterization after cutting is better, and often they return if any of their roots remain, but when cauterized with fire, those roots are burned and do not return.
Chapter Nine
On treating hail-like formations occurring in the eyelids.
Often something occurs in the eyelids that resembles hail in its hardness and solidity.
That is why it is called hail, and it is an accumulation of thick fluid in the upper and lower eyelid. The procedure for it is to examine, and if the hailstone is protruding on the outer eyelid and moves in all directions, its matter is simple: make a horizontal incision on it.
Then gently separate it from all sides until it comes free, then hook it with the hook and cut it out. If you cannot cut it except by penetrating through the eyelid with the cut, this will not harm the patient at all. If the incision is large, close it with stitches and treat it until it heals."
If it is small, there is no concern for you about it, as the ointment will heal and bind it. If the cold growth is inclined toward the inside of the eyelid toward the inner surface, then turn the eyelid over and catch the growth with a hook without needing to make an incision, and cut it off from all sides.
If you penetrate the eyelid with the cut, it will not cause any harm. Then wash the eye after cutting the growth with salt water and treat the area with what binds until the patient is cured.
Chapter Ten.
On the treatment of the fatty tumor that occurs in the eyelid.
The fatty tumor is a mass of fat that forms in the layers of the upper eyelid, and it occurs most often in children. It weighs down their eyes and causes them to have discharge in the early morning, and they cannot look at sunlight.
Because tears come to them quickly.
Therefore, you see them always leaning on their faces and sleeping on them, and their eyelids under the eyebrows are moist and swollen, and the protrusion of the fatty tumor is visible to the eye. When you press the area with your fingers, you feel the fatty tumor between them. The procedure is to have the patient place their head in your lap.
Then take a linen cloth and prepare from it a wick, and make from that wick a circle of sufficient size to surround the fatty tumor from all sides, then place it on it and press with your fingers from all sides to gather the fatty tumor in the center of the circle.
Then make an incision in the center of that moisture with the thin scalpel, a transverse incision that should not be larger than the incision made in bloodletting. As for depth, you should cut through all the skin until you reach the fatty tumor.
In most cases, the fatty tumor will protrude from the incision like a piece of white fat, so pull it out with a cloth you have wrapped between your fingers while rotating your hand right and left until it is removed. Be careful not to enlarge the incision lest the scalpel reach the eye and harm it.
If the fatty tumor does not appear at the first incision, you should carefully increase the incision slightly until the fatty tumor protrudes, then pull it as we said. Then dip cloths in vinegar and water and place them on the area and bind it with a pad. Some people grind salt.
And place it inside the incision to dissolve what remains of that moisture, then treat it until it heals. If hot swelling occurs in the area, treat it with soothing dressings until it heals.
Chapter Eleven.
On the types of eyelid lifting.
When extra eyelashes grow in the eyelid outside the natural course beneath the natural eyelashes and become chronic, they harm the eye and cause various diseases such as constant tearing, eyelid laxity, whiteness, and thickness until this becomes a cause for eye failure.
Eyelid lifting is done in four ways: either by cauterization with fire, or with sharp medicine as previously mentioned in the chapter on cauterization, or the lifting may be done by cutting and suturing, or with reed as I will mention.
You should place the patient's head in your lap, then turn the eyelid over with your left hand. If it turns over, fine; if not, insert a needle with thread from below the eyelid and pass the needle with thread from above, and this should be near the hair itself, and pull the thread upward with the eyelid.
And turn it over with the probe, then make an incision in the inner eyelid below the extra hair with the thin scalpel from the larger canthus to the smaller canthus, then remove the thread and place under the eyelid a small pad of cotton or cloth, then mark on the eyelid with ink.
Like the shape of a myrtle leaf, except that the shape should be according to how much you want to lift the eyelid, because people vary in this - some need a good amount to be cut from the eyelid according to how much the eyelid has drooped.
And some need less cutting, all according to the drooping of the eyelid. Then cut with the scalpel along the two lines you marked, starting from the larger canthus to the smaller canthus, and one cut should be near the natural hair about the thickness of a probe.
Then insert the hook into one of the corners of the skin and peel it all off, then join the two edges with stitching using a needle and fine wool thread, and wipe away the blood and stick the excess threads to the eyebrows with some adhesive substances if.
If you wish to do that, otherwise it doesn't matter. Then leave the stitches and threads for about three or four days, then treat it. If you prefer, you can leave the wound without stitching and treat it with what dries and constricts, for the eyelid will rise when the wound heals and comes together, though stitching is better.
This method of lifting was mentioned by the ancients, though it is burdensome for the patient, yet it is good work without danger. There is another method of lifting where you mark on the eyelid a shape like a myrtle leaf as we described.
Then lift the eyelid with three hooks, either separated or together, in this manner:
Then cut the excess from the eyelid with small scissors in this manner, cutting moderately:
If you cannot hold the hooks steady and they don't work well for you, take a needle with thread and insert it in the middle of the shape, and insert another thread near the larger corner of the eye, and a third thread near the smaller corner, and gather the threads moderately between your fingers, then lift your hand steadily.
Lift all the marked skin as we described, then join the wound edges with stitches and treat until healed. If hot swelling occurs during your cutting or incision, calm that swelling with cerates and similar soothing ointments.
The lower eyelid can also have its lashes turn inward, so you should use what we mentioned of cutting, stitching, and lifting with fire and sharp medicine. Lifting with fire or sharp medicine is more effective and easier on the patient than cutting and stitching, though cutting and stitching in both cases is more skillful.
Lifting with reed is done in this manner: turn the eyelid and make the incision from inside as I described, then make two thin reeds or wooden pieces as long as the eyelid and narrower than a lancet.
They should be notched at both ends where the threads will hold, then carefully bring them together over the excess eyelid skin and tie the reeds firmly from both sides, leaving them for days until the bound skin dies, blackens, and decays.
Until it falls off by itself, but if it delays, cut it with scissors then treat until it heals. When it heals, the eyelid will lift and the lashes won't prick the eye. This is the form of the two reeds, make them in this shape and exactly this length and width:
Chapter Twelve
On lifting pricking hair from the eye with a needle.
If there are one or two hairs, the procedure is to take a fine needle and thread it with smooth, fine silk thread, then bring its ends together and tie them in a very fine knot, with the thread about a span long.
Then attach another finer, shorter thread to the loop, and tie its ends if you wish. Then have the patient rest their head in your lap near sunlight so the procedure is clear, as it is delicate work. Then insert the needle with the loop at the base of the excess hair.
Pass it through the eyelid quickly until it emerges above the natural hairs, then pull the thread up with the loop and insert into the loop that hair if it's one, or two, or three but no more.
Then pull your hand until the hair comes out with the loop in the eyelid with the natural hair. If you pull the loop and the hair doesn't come with it, pull the loop down with the thread you attached to it until the loop comes out of the upper hole.
Then return the hair into it and pull them - do this until it rises in the upper hole and you can see it clearly. Then remove the loop and thread, and bandage the eye, leaving it bandaged for two or three days until the hair stays in place and flesh grows over it.
If the hair is short, either attach to it a long hair from the natural hairs so it rises with it, or leave it until it grows longer after some time, then lift it.
Chapter Thirteen.
On treating the eversion that occurs in the upper eyelid of the eye.
This eversion is called "rabbity" and it is either congenital or acquired - the acquired type occurs from the healing of a wound, incision, cauterization, or similar causes.
The method of treatment is to incise that healed area and separate its edges, then place between them a cotton wick and bind it until it heals, and one should not use in its treatment things that dry and constrict.
For if you do that, the eversion will return worse than it was - rather, use things that relax like fenugreek and fomentation with water in which marshmallow and flaxseed have been boiled, and diachylon ointment melted with some oils, applied to the wicks and treated with it.
The key to its treatment is to strive by every means to prevent it from healing in the way it was before, and this procedure we mentioned is only a partial correction of the eversion, not returning the site completely to how it was before.
Chapter Fourteen.
On treating the eversion that occurs in the lower eyelid.
This eversion that occurs below is what is truly called ectropion and it can be congenital or acquired - the acquired type occurs from a wound, incision, cauterization, or similar causes.
The method of operation is to take a needle with a doubled thread and insert it into the flesh, passing it from the left canthus to the right canthus until the thread is at the ends of the flesh, then pull the flesh upward with the needle and cut it with a broad scalpel.
If the shape of the eyelid returns to how it should be, fine; if not, take a probe and place it on the site of the incision and turn the eyelid with it, then make two incisions on the inner side of the eyelid, with the ends of the incisions from the corners of the cut you made until they meet to form an angle.
Until when joined their shape becomes similar to this shape:
Which is the Greek letter lambda, then remove that flesh to the extent that its sharp side is below what follows the eyelid, then join the separated parts with two sutures using wool thread, then treat it with what we mentioned of relaxing medicines and wicks until it heals.
And if the eversion occurred from an incision or suturing or cauterization, one should make a simple incision below the eyelash hair also as previously mentioned, then separate between the edges with wicks as we described.
The summary of treating eversion whether upper or lower is to conduct the operation according to what presents itself to you from the condition of the eversion, for it can vary greatly in appearance, and the skilled practitioner devises the technique by whatever means possible.
Until he returns the shape to its natural form or close to it, and the disease itself will guide you to what is suitable for it in terms of procedure and instruments in most cases.
Chapter Fifteen.
On the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or cornea.
This adhesion occurs to many people where the upper eyelid adheres to the white of the eye, preventing it from easy movement and hindering its natural functions, so one should insert the tip of a probe under the eyelid.
And lift it upward or pull it with a hook, then cut the adhesion with a fine scalpel that should not be as sharp as regular scalpels but rather slightly blunt so the patient doesn't become anxious during the procedure causing the scalpel to slip and harm the eye with its sharpness, and your cutting should be as if you're peeling away that adhesion.
And wait until the eyelid returns to its natural position and the adhesion heals completely, then pour salt water into the eye to wash it or drop into it verdigris collyrium dissolved in water, then separate between the eyelid and eye with a cotton wick.
And place above the eye wool moistened with egg white, and after the third day use healing collyria until it heals.
Chapter Sixteen.
On cutting pterygium and protrusion of flesh in the corners of the eyes.
The pterygium occurs in two types: either it is fibrous, resembling a tough thin membrane, or it is non-fibrous, resembling a white coagulated fluid that, when touched with an instrument or attempted to be grasped with a hook, breaks apart.
And no hook can hold it, and both types begin from the greater corner of the eye until they gradually creep forward until they cover the pupil and prevent light and eye movement, and the method of operation in cutting it is to have the patient place his head in your lap.
Then have him open his eyes and lift the eyelid with your hand, then grasp the pterygium with a slightly curved hook and pull it upward, then take a needle threaded with a horse or cow hair and a strong thread, bend the needle tip slightly, and pierce it through the middle of the pterygium.
Pass it through with the needle and tie the pterygium with the thread and pull it upward, and separate with the hair the side of the pterygium that is next to the pupil as if you are sawing it with the hair to its end, then cut the remainder at the base of the corner with a fine scalpel or small scissors and leave the natural flesh of the corner.
Lest cutting it cause constant tearing, and you may pull the pterygium with the hook alone or with the thread as we said, then separate it with the smooth-tipped scalpel which is of this form:
And be careful that the scalpel does not touch the corneal membrane causing a tear in it leading to protrusion of the pupil, then after cutting apply to the eye some ground salt or verdigris collyrium and leave it until the next day, then treat it as necessary until it heals.
If the pterygium is non-fibrous and you cannot insert a needle into it nor can a hook hold it, this type of pterygium is often treated with medications and heals as I described in the classification, and if you want to cut it, open the patient's eye.
Take a fine smooth scalpel with a weak edge of this form:
And gently scrape the pterygium from above, and if you see it becoming loose and crumbling and the scraping is effective, immediately drop into the eye some verdigris collyrium or red collyrium or ground salt and bandage the eye until the next day.
Then repeat the procedure until it is all gone, unless inflammation occurs in the eye, in which case leave it and treat the inflammation until it heals, then resume the scraping procedure until it heals, and as for protrusion of flesh in the corner of the eye.
If the protrusion severely harms the eye, hook that protrusion with the hook and cut off some of it, but do not cut too deeply lest it cause constant tearing, then drop red or verdigris collyrium in the corners until it heals.
Chapter Seventeen.
On cutting granulation tissue and excess flesh growth in the eye.
In some people's eyes, red flesh grows in layers until it covers or nearly covers the pupil or overflows onto the eyelids, and sometimes the eyelids turn outward, and it resembles pomegranate flowers.
The procedure for this is to have the patient place his head in your lap, then have him open his eyes and grasp all that red flesh with hooks suitable for this purpose.
Or hold it with forceps or clamp, then cut the flesh piece by piece until you remove all of it by cutting, and protect the eye lest you harm it during the procedure, and your cutting should be done either with the scalpel we described for cutting pterygium or with small scissors.
Like those used to remove pannus, as will be shown in the chapter following this chapter.
When you complete your cutting and all the granulation tissue is gone, fill the eye with ground salt or drop in red powder and similar caustic medications, and place cotton with egg white on the eye externally to prevent inflammation.
If any granulation tissue remains and you are overwhelmed by bleeding and fear inflammation, leave the eye and treat it with what calms inflammation, then return to the procedure until it heals, and do likewise with excess flesh that occurs in the eye of this type.
However, you should avoid treating any eye that is weak by nature or by accident with surgical instruments, and do not undertake any of these procedures until you see that the organ can withstand that procedure.
Chapter Eighteen.
On Extracting the Veins from the Eye.
The veins are red vessels that spread over the eye, preventing vision and weakening the eye over time. You must first examine [the eye], and if the eye with the veins is strong and has no other disease except the veins,
then extract them. This is done by instructing the patient to place their head in your lap, then hook those vessels with one or two hooks, depending on your skill, and the hooks should be fine and curved in this manner:.
or [you can use] two double-headed hooks in one handle, in this form:.
Then, gently cut those vessels with fine scissors, and wipe the blood occasionally until you see that those vessels have disappeared from the eye and the blood has flowed out. Be careful not to harm the eye with the tips of the scissors, and do your work in the presence of the sun for half the day.
And be very diligent in your work, lest you cut anything other than those veins. When you are done, drop the green or red collyrium into the eye, so that its pungency may consume what remains of the veins. If you cannot extract all of it in that session, then bandage the eye with what soothes the pain of the eye.
Leave it for days until the pain subsides and the hot swelling is secure, then repeat the procedure in the same manner until this condition is cured. This is the form of the scissors.
And [the technique is that] the patient's head should be in the student's lap, and another [assistant] dries the tears and examines the front and back of the eye, and you [the surgeon] are in charge of the work. The principle in the work is to open the eye with fixed or triangular speculums held by a skilled assistant.
The patient's head should be in the assistant's lap, and another [assistant] dries the tears and examines the front and back of the eye, and you have the choice to start the extraction from the top of the eye or the bottom, and it is preferable to fix two hooks on the upper side, one at the end of the eyebrow and the other at its beginning.
And hold them between the middle and index fingers, then attach the hooks from underneath in front of them, then hold them between the little and ring fingers. Gently raise your hand until you see all the veins have risen, then cut the smallest vein if you wish with scissors, or if you wish, with a fine lancet.
And insert the probe onto a needle and thoroughly examine the entire vein until it rises on the conjunctiva, and do not cut the drying [application], for the tears and blood will flow over you.
Then cut with the scissors what is in excess above and below the eyebrow, so that nothing remains stuck except in the cornea. If you can lift it off the cornea, remove it with the probe - this is better. And it may be possible in some people.
And if you cut it, the excised area will be inflamed for days, its pain will subside, and the hot swelling will be secured, then repeat the work on it.
Chapter Nineteen. 
On Returning the Fistula to the Nose.
The doctors call the fistula a sinus. If you have treated it with cautery or the pungent, burning medication as described before, and it has not healed, the only remedy is to incise the swelling when it matures, and extract all the moisture or pus in it,
until the bone is exposed. If you see decay or blackness in the bone, remove it with this instrument: .
And it is called the "rough-headed" [instrument]. It is made of Indian steel, its head rounded like a button, engraved with fine grooves like a rasp or a file. Place it on the site of the bone decay, then turn it between your fingers, gripping your hand slightly, until you know that the decay has been removed.
Do this several times, then bandage the site with drying, astringent medications. If the site closes and the flesh grows, and the flow of pus stops, and it remains so for forty days without recurrence or inflammation or incident,
then know that it has healed. Otherwise, there is no remedy except to return the sinus to the nasal aperture, in this manner: Expose the bone again, either with the iron or the pungent medication. When the bone is exposed, take a perforator like this: .
Its tip is triangular, and its shaft is conical, tapered towards the tip as you see. Then place it on the bone itself, near the inner corner of the eye, a little distant from the eye, then turn your hand with the perforator until it penetrates the bone, and the patient feels the air coming out of it when they hold their hand over their nose.
At that point, bandage the site with the drying, astringent medications as I have taught you. When the flesh has grown and the site has hardened, the matter that was flowing outward will return to the nose, and that will be easier for the patient, God willing.
Chapter Twenty.
On the Reduction of the Eye.
If the entire eye is protruded and there is no injury or diminution in vision, the patient should be laxed, then bled in the cephalic vein, then a cupping glass should be applied to the occiput without scarification, and gently suctioned.
Then a topical application should be placed on the eye, made from acacia, aloe, frankincense, and verdigris. Then the eye should be bandaged with many folds, and the description of the folds is that you take soft, numerous rags and fold each one into four layers to make many.
Then place them one on top of the other according to the need of the eye, then bind them tightly with a firm cloth and reapply the cupping glass by suction without scarification, then remove the cupping glass and leave the eye bandaged for a day and a night.
If the bandage becomes loose during that time, it should be tightened well. Then remove the bandage after a day and a night as we said. If you see the eye has returned, otherwise repeat the dressing, folds, binding, and cupping glass until it returns.
Chapter Twenty-One. 
On the Excision of the Iris.
If a hernia appears in the iris layer, then it protrudes outside the eyelids like the appearance of grapes, and the appearance of the person is disfigured because of that, and you want to cut it, the work on it is as I describe.
And it is that you insert a needle into the base of the iris from below to above, then you insert another needle with a folded thread from the side of the lacrimal point and pass it through, and leave the first needle as it is.
Then cut the place of the bend of the folded thread and tie part of the iris around the needle and tighten it well, then remove the needle and place wet cotton soaked in egg white on the eye and leave it until the threads fall off with the iris, then treat the eye with what strengthens it.
Until the wound heals, and you may bind the iris from all sides with a circle of cloth until the eye becomes more protruded, then prick it gently with a thin lancet until it reaches the depth of the eye, so the vitreous humor drains and the eye descends and atrophies in place, then bind it until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Two.
On the Treatment of the Hypopyon.
This disease which is called the hypopyon is only a collection of pus in the eye resembling flowing water but it is not, and the way of working on that is that you seat the patient upright on a chair, then take his head with your hands from the two sides.
And move it until you see the pus move to the bottom in your eye, then hold it and do not move, and the light is released and the patient sees things as he used to see them, and if the pus does not descend to the bottom as we mentioned, we know that it is water, and if the descent of the pus is not achieved by what we have mentioned.
Otherwise, seat the patient before you, then take a thin lancet and incise slightly above the corneal membrane at the junction of the conjunctiva and the corneal membrane in the limbus, until the material comes out.
And when it comes out, instill hot water in which honey or water in which fenugreek and honey have been boiled, then treat with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Three.
On the Couching of the Descending Water in the Eye.
We have mentioned the types of water in the classification and which of them is suitable for couching with detailed and explained speech, take it from there correctly. Then it is necessary to seat the patient before you in a cross-legged position facing the light near the sun.
And bind his healthy eye and tighten it well, then raise his eyelid with your left hand if the eye with the water is the left eye, or with your right hand if it is the right eye.
Then place the tip of the couching needle near the limbus at the thickness of a probe in the white of the eye from the side of the smaller lacrimal point, then push the couching needle forcefully as you rotate it in your hand until it penetrates into the white of the eye and you feel the couching needle has reached something empty.
And it is necessary that the depth to which the couching needle goes be the distance that is from the child to the end of the black, which is the limbus of the eye, for you see the copper in the same observer as the eye, due to the clarity of the corneal membrane, then direct the couching needle upwards to the place where the water is. 
Then press it downwards repeatedly, if the water descends immediately, the patient will see what is opened for him from the moment the couching needle is in his eye, then calm down a little, if the water rises, lower it again without removing the couching needle.
