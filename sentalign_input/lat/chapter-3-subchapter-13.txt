On the restoration of fractures of the hand.
Chapter 14.
Know that fractures rarely occur in the palm of the hand and in the joints of the fingers.
And it does not happen except by repeated trauma.
When, therefore, a fracture or injury of the hand occurs, it is necessary for the patient to sit squarely, and a seat should be placed level in front of him.
Then place his hand extended over it.
Then let the assistant stretch the broken bones, and the physician should align them until they come together well.
Then it is necessary to apply a plaster and lint, unless a warm swelling appears.
Then place a splint over it according to the size of the area, and you have already wrapped it in a linen cloth.
If, however, the fracture is near the lower part around the palm’s center, then make a spherical pad from cloth and instruct the patient to press on it with the fractured palm; then secure it with a long cloth.
And the splint should be made of soft leather, so that it can be applied closely to the hand’s body; and bind it as necessary.
If the fracture is on the outer side, then it is necessary to place a splint on top and another underneath the hand, with the hand open and straight.
Then apply a binding, wrapping the hand, and extend between the fingers with a bandage.
If a fracture occurs in one of the finger joints, then if it is the thumb, it should be aligned as necessary.
Then bind it with the palm; and if desired, place a small, straight splint to elevate the fracture and prevent movement.
If, however, the fracture is in the other fingers, such as the middle, index, pinky, or ring finger, then it should be aligned and bound with the healthy finger next to it; or all can be bound together in sequence, which is better.
Or place a small splint over it, as we said for the thumb.
And consider your restoration, and after the setting, treat any warm swelling that arises accordingly, as previously described.
