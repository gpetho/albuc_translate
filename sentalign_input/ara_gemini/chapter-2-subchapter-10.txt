The tenth chapter on the treatment of sharanaq that appears in the eyelid.
A sharnaq is a small lump that forms in the layers of the upper eyelid, and it occurs most often in children, making their eyes heavy and causing them to experience colds in the early mornings.
They are unable to look at sunlight because tears quickly come to their eyes, and so you see them constantly leaning on their faces, and they sleep on them, and their eyelids under their eyebrows are moist, swollen, and the protrusion of the sharnaq is visible.
And when you press the area with your fingers, you will feel the sharnaq between them.
The procedure is to place the patient's head in your lap, then take a linen cloth, prepare a wick from it, and make a circle from that wick to the extent that it surrounds the sharnaq from all sides, then place it on it and press with your fingers from all sides to gather the sharnaq in the center of the circle, then make a horizontal incision in the middle of that moist area with a lancet, and the incision should not be larger than the incision made for bloodletting.
As for the depth, you should incise the entire skin until you reach the sharnaq, and in most cases the sharnaq will protrude from the incision in the form of a white piece of fat, so pull it out with a cloth that you have wrapped between your fingers while turning your hand right and left until it is completely removed.
Beware of increasing the size of the incision, lest the lancet reach the eye and harm it.
If the sharnaq does not appear to you at the beginning of the incision, then you should increase the incision slightly and gently until the sharnaq appears, then pull it out as we mentioned.
Then dip a cloth in vinegar and water and place it on the area and bandage it with a soft dressing.
Some people crush salt and place it in the cavity of the incision to dissolve what remains of that moisture, then treat it until it heals.
If a hot swelling occurs in the area, treat it with soothing compresses until it heals.
