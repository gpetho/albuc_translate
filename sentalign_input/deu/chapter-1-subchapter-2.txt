Second chapter.
Of the cauterization of the head.
When in the entire head there is chronic and long-lasting pain and this has been prolonged in the patient, and he uses warm packs, cupping, head purges, poultices, ointments, suppositories, chickens, and the like, and especially if it has already been cauterized with a cautery which we recount and none of those causes provide relief, then consider if the patient's head is of strong constitution in its nature; and it is not fragile and has found great coldness, then cauterize with another cautery a little below that.
Then cauterize that on the horn of his head with a cautery until the skin is split.
Incise the skin and expose the amount of bone which we have recounted and cauterize it with a cautery on the back part of the head in the place called "vas" â€” and it is that place where cupping is done.
And ease your hand in that, and do not expose the bone, because the patient finds much greater pain from that than from any other head cautery.
And I will tell this cautery in its place, because the cautery with which the horns of the head and the occiput are cauterized is a more subtle cautery than that with which the middle of the head is cauterized; and this is its form.
