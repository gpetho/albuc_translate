This third part of the book, too, is an essential necessity in the practice of medicine; it concerns the setting of the fracture or dislocation occurring in bones.	This chapter is often necessary in the art of medicine and concerns the restoration of fractures and dislocations in bones.	0.6786481
You should know, my sons, that ignorant practitioners and laymen and those who have never turned the pages of a single book of the Ancients about it, nor studied a single letter of it, arrogate this part of the art to themselves.	Know, O Sons, that foolish doctors and the common people boast of this chapter, though they have never looked into any ancient book nor read a single letter from it.	0.74832016
For this reason this section of the science has died out in our parts; I have myself found no one competent in it; and whatever skill I have, I have derived for myself by my long reading of the books of the Ancients and my thirst to understand them until I extracted the knowledge of it from them.	And for this reason, this method of knowledge is deprived in our land. And I have never found anything good in it, nor did I gain anything from it except through extensive reading of ancient books and studying their understanding, until I extracted its knowledge from them.	0.7865242
Then through the whole of my life I have adhered to experience and practice.	Then I applied myself to experimentation and study throughout my life.	0.8794961
So now I have described for you in this book all that my knowledge has encompassed on the subject and that my experience has encountered; I have made it accessible for you and rescued it from the abyss of prolixity; I have reduced it to a brief outline; and have explained it most clearly. I have made for you many drawings of the instruments that are used in it, which is an adjunct to explanation, as I did in the two previous books.	And now I have written for you in this chapter all that my knowledge contains on this matter, based on my experiments, after I have abbreviated it for you, freed it from unnecessary length, abbreviated it to the point of abbreviation, and demonstrated it clearly; I have also designed many forms of instruments used in it, with added details, as I did in the two preceding chapters.	0.8708003
