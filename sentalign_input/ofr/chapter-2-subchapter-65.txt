of the rupture of the peritoneum/abdominal wall
The occurrence of this hernia is due to the tear that happens in the peritoneum/abdominal wall, or the stretching over the belly in the area of the groin, which causes the intestines to descend through this rupture to one of the testicles;
and this rupture is either of the peritoneum/abdominal wall itself, or from its stretching, and these two types arise from many causes:
from a blow, or a jump, or shouting, or lifting a heavy load, and similar things;
and the signs, when it is from the stretching of the peritoneum/abdominal wall, are that it occurs little by little, over a long time, and does not happen suddenly;
and the swelling is even down to the depths, because the peritoneum/abdominal wall presses upon the intestine.
And the sign, when it is from a tear in the peritoneum/abdominal wall, is that it causes sudden pain at the onset, and the swelling appears uneven, close under the skin, and this is because of the protrusion of the intestine and body outside of the peritoneum/abdominal wall.
And sometimes the omentum descends with the intestine, and is retained there, and causes the patient to suffer great pain, especially when it is pressed.
And in these treatments, one is afraid of iron (cautery), so it should be avoided.
And the way to do this is to instruct the patient to put the intestine back inside the wound with his hand, if he can put it back in;
then he should be supported on his neck between your hands, and lift his thighs;
then spread the scrotum above, and cut all the skin of the testicles lengthwise;
then insert hooks into the lips of the incision as needed to open the wound, and they should be such that the egg can come out;
then peel away the tunic which is under the skin of the testicles, until the hard white tunic is uncovered on all sides;
then put your index finger into that which follows the testicle, into that which is between the white tunic which is under the skin of the egg, and between the second tunic, and separate that which is behind the egg, and between the second tunic;
and then move with your right hand inside the scrotum, and stretch the white tunic upwards with your left hand, and lift the testicle with all the tunic towards the incision;
and instruct the assistant to stretch the testicle upwards, and untie that which is attached behind the ligature;
and search with your fingers if there is any of the intestine wrapped in the hard white tunic, and if you find any, push it back into the abdomen;
then take a needle with a thick thread made of ten strands, and put it in the back part of the tunic, which is behind the skin of the scrotum;
after the incision, then cut the ends of the threads that appear, so that there are four threads;
then bring them together, one on top of the other, in the form of a cross, and tie the tunic, which we said is under the skin of the scrotum, with a strong ligature in two places;
then wrap the ends of the threads and tie them tightly in two places, so that none of the vessels that nourish them can enter it, preventing an abscess from forming;
and place another ligature along the first ligature, two fingers' length from it, and after these two ligatures, leave a finger's width of the tunic, which is under the skin of the scrotum;
and then all the rest, following the roundness of the testicle;
then cut in the part that is under the skin of the scrotum, until the blood and pus flow, as we have said before;
then apply wool soaked in oil, and place it on the wounds, and apply the ligature that we have mentioned.
And sometimes the white tunic that we have mentioned is cauterized, after the incision, for fear of bleeding.
For this happens often, and leave the ligature until it falls off by itself;
and if it is slow to fall off, then it should be moistened with warm water, and apply what we have said, until it falls off;
then treat the wound with another treatment, until it is completely healed.
