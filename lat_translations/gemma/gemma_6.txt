Praefatio.	Preface.
Postquam compleui uobis o Filii, librum hunc, qui est postremus scientiae in medicina cum complemento ipsius, et consecutus sum finem in eo, ex expositionibus eius, et ipsius declarationibus, uisum est mihi, ut compleam ipsum uobis cum hoc Tractatu qui est pars operationis, id est, chirurgiae cum manu.	After I have finished with you, my son, this book, which is the last of my works on medicine, and having completed it with the addition of its contents, I have reached the end of my exposition and declarations, so that I deemed it fitting to join this treatise to the work on surgery, which is the hand of the art.
Quoniam operatio cum manu prostrata est in regione nostra, et tempore nostro priuata omnino: donec fortasse periit scientia eius, et abscissum est uestigium eius: et non remanserunt ex ea, nisi descriptiones paruae in libris antiquorum, quas mutauerunt manus: et accidit eis error et haesitatio, donec clausae sunt intentiones eius, et elongata est uis ipsius: Visum est mihi, ut uiuificem eam cum ordinatione huius Tractatus in ea secundum uiam ex positionis, et declarationis, et abbreuiationis: et ut ueniam cum formis ferramentorum Cauterii, et reliquorum instrumentorum operis: cum fit ex declarationis additione, et ex properatione eius quod est necesse.	For surgery is a hand of the art which has been cast aside in our time and age; and for a long time it has been cast aside due to the scarcity of its secrets and the hazes of tradition. And it has not remained except for a few slight descriptions in the ancient books, which have been changed by the hands of men. And this has caused error and hesitation, until the intentions of these works have been closed and prolonged is has become necessary. It is therefore necessary for me to set forth this treatise in this way, in order to explain its forms and arrangements of instruments, along with their preparations, which are necessary for the work.
Caussa autem propter quam non inuenitur bonus artifex eius cum manu sua in hoc nostro tempore, est: quia ars medicinae est longa, et oportet auctorem eius exercitari ante illud in scientia anatomiae, quam narrauit Galenus, donec sciat iuuamenta membrorum, et ipsorum formas, et eorum coniunctionem, et separationem, et habeat cognitionem ossium, et neruorum, et lacertorum, et numerum ipsorum, et eorum egressionem, et uenarum pulsatilium, et quietarum, et locorum exitus earum.	But the greatest cause why one does not find a good surgeon of the hand in our time is that the art of medicine is a long one, and the author must exercise himself beforehand in the science of anatomy as Galen has narrated, until he knows the movements of the limbs, their forms, and their connections, and the separation and union of the bones, nerves, and vessels, and their number, and their emergence and pulsation, and quietness, and the location of their exits
Et propter illud dixit Hippocrates, quod nomen cum nomine est multum, et cum opere est paucum, et praecipue in arte manus.	And thus Hippocrates said, "A name is little when it comes to fame, but work is great, especially in the art of the hand.
Nos uero iam diximus de illo in introitu huius libri.	We have already mentioned this at the beginning of this book.
Quoniam qui non est sciens, quod diximus de anatomia, non euacuatur, quin iam cadat in errorem, quo interficiuntur homines: sicut ego uidi multos ex illis, qui formantur de hac scientia, et iactant se de ea absque scientia, et sine experimento.	For he who is ignorant of what we have said concerning anatomy will fall into error, for many have perished from this lack of knowledge, who have puffed up with pride from their supposed knowledge of this science without any knowledge or experience
Quod est, quia uidi medicum stolidum secuisse apostema scrophulosum in collo mulieris, et incidit quasdam arterias in collo: quare fluxit sanguis mulieris, donec cecidit mortua inter manus eius.	What is this, since the doctor has secured the swollen abscess with a scrophulus in the woman's neck, and has thereby obstructed some arteries in the neck: why does blood flow from the woman, until it dies between her hands?
Et uidi medicum alium, qui praesumpsit ut extraheret lapidem uiro, qui processerat in aetate, et lapis erat magnus.	And the doctor has also said that he would extract the stone from the bladder, which was proceeding in its age, and the stone was great.
Peruenit ergo ad eum, et extraxit ipsum cum frusto uesicae.	So it came to pass that he extracted it with the bladder's bladder-sac.
Quare mortuus est uir in tertio die.	Therefore the man died on the third day.
Et ego quidem iam uocatus fueram ad extrahendum ipsum: et uidi ex magnitudine lapidis, et dispositione infirmi, quod moriretur.	And I myself was called to extract it: and I saw from the greatness of the stone, and the condition of the patient, that he would die.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui accipiebat stipem apud quendam Ducum terrae nostrae propter medicinam: et accidit eunucho nigro, qui erat apud ipsum, fractura in crure eius prope calcaneum: et properauit medicus cum ignorantia sua, et strinxit fracturam super uulnus cum puluinaribus, et astellis strictura forti, et non dimisit uulneri expirationem.	And the doctor saw another man receive a blow from a certain Duke of our land for a physician: and it happened to a black eunuch who was with him, that he fractured his leg near his heel: and the doctor did not know what to do, and he bound up the fracture with wool and nails, and strong stitches, and did not let the wound breathe.
Deinde absoluit eum secundum desyderia sua.	And he left him according to his desires.
Postea dimisit eum diebus aliquot, et praecepit ei, ne solueret ligamentum: et stetit sic donec apostematum est crus eius, et ipsius pes, et peruenit ad perditionem.	Afterwards he sent him away for a few days, and commanded him not to loosen the ligament: and he stood thus until the abscess of his leg had gone down, and his foot and leg, and it came to pass to his destruction
Vocatus sum ergo ad eum: et properaui ad soluendum ligamentum: et consecuta est tranquillitas, et euasit a doloribus suis.	I was called to him again: and I proceeded to loosen the ligament: and there was peace, and he was freed from his pains
Verumtamen corruptio iam confirmata erat in membro: et non potui refraenare ipsam.	But indeed the corruption was already confirmed in the limb: and I could not restrain it
Pon ergo cessauit corruptio perambulare in membro, donec periit.	Therefore the corruption ceased to walk in the limb until it died
Et uidi medicum alium, qui perforauit apostema cancerosum: et ulceratum est post dies, donec magnificata est malicia eius cum domino ipsius.	And the physician went to another, who had perforated the cancerous tumor: and it had ulcerated after days, until the malice of the former increased with the master himself.
Quod est, quia quando est cancer purus ex humore melancholico, tunc non oportet ut perueniatur ad eum cum ferro omnino, nisi sit in membro quod toleret, ut abscindatur totum eius.	When the tumor is pure from black bile, it does not suffice to endure it with all one's might, except in the limb where it can be excised whole
Et propter illud o Filii, necesse est uobis, ut sciatis, quod operatio cum manu diuiditur in duas diuisiones: scilicet, operationem cui associatur salus: et operationem, cum qua est periculum in pluribus dispositionibus.	And thus, my son, you must know that surgery is divided into two parts: that which is associated with health, and that which carries risk in many situations.
Et ego iam excitaui in omni loco huius libri, in quo uenit operatio, in qua est terror et timor.	I am grieved in every place of this book in which surgery is mentioned, in which there is fear and terror.
Quare necesse est uobis, ut caueatis illud, et dimitatis ipsum: ut non inueniant stolidi uiam ad loquendum, et dehonestandum.	Therefore you must be cautious of this, and humble yourself: so that you do not become proud, and thereby lose your dignity
Accipite ergo mensuram cum sollicitudine et protectione, et infirmos uestros cum facilitate et firmitudine, et utimini uia meliore perducente gratia Dei ad salutem et successionem laudabilem: et dimittite aegritudines terribiles difficilis sanationis: et tollite animas uestras ab eo quod facit uos timere, ut ingrediatur super uos haesitatio in fide uestra et commodo uestro.	Receive therefore measure with humility and protection, and the sick with ease and firmness, and use the better way for the bringing about of glory to God for salvation and praiseworthy succession: and banish from you the terrible anxieties which make you fear for your soul, that there should be no hesitation in your heart or coolness in your spirit
Est enim magis remanens ad gloriam uestram, et sublimius in mundo isto, et postremo ad quantitates uestras.	For there remains in this world only the glory of God, and the shadow of this life, and finally the account of each one.
Galenus enim iam dixit in quibusdam suis admonitionibus.	For Galen has said in some of his admonitions.
Non medicetis aegritudinem malam: ne nominemini medici mali.	You do not cure the bad ailment: do not call the physician a bad man.
Iam autem diuisi hunc Tractatum secundum tria Capitula. ¶	I have, however, divided this treatise into three chapters.
Capitulum primum.	Chapter 1.
De Cauterio cum igne, et Cauterio cum medicina acuta, capitulatum, et ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum, et ferramentis Cauterii: et omni quod necessarium est in operatione. ¶	Of the cautery with fire, and the cautery with acute medicine, a chapter, arranged from the head to the feet, concerning the forms of the instruments and materials for the cautery: and everything which is necessary for the operation
Capitulum secundum.	Second Chapter.
De sectione et perforatione, phlebotomia et uentosis, et uulneribus: et extractione sagittarum, et similibus illius: et totum capitulatum, ordinatum formis instrumentorum. ¶	On incision and perforation, phlebotomy and packing, and wounds: and the extraction of arrows, and things of that kind: and the whole chapter, arranged in the form of instruments.
Capitulum tertium.	Third Chapter.
De restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus illius: capitulatum, ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum.	On restoration, and dislocation, and treatment of twisting, and things of that kind: the chapter is arranged from the head to the feet, and the form of instruments.
Soli Deo Gloria.	Glory be to God.

Pars I.	Part I.
¶ De Iuuamento, et Nocumento Cauterii: et quibus complexionibus conueniat, et quo tempore: et si cum ferro, uel auro.	On the application of a dressing, and the use of the cautery: and on what complexion it is suitable, and when: and whether with iron or gold.
Caput I.	Chapter I
Sed Ante Quidem Quam rememorer operationis cum eo, oportet ut dicam qualitatem Iuuamentorum eius, et Nocumentorum ipsius: et in qua complexione exhibeatur.	But before one remembers any operation, it is necessary to say what is the quality of the dressings and instruments: and in what complexion it should be shown
Dico ergo, quod sermo de qualitate iuuamenti Cauterii, et nocumenti eius, est sermo prolixus, et subtilis, scientia, et secretum occultum.	I say therefore, that the discourse concerning the quality of the cautery dressing and its instrument is a lengthy, subtle, scientific and hidden art.
Etiam locuta fuit in eo multitudo sapientum, et dissenserunt in eo: et mihi quidem sufficit parum ex sermonibus eorum, timens prolongationem.	And it has been said by many learned men in this matter, and they have differed among themselves: and indeed little is to be learned from their discourses, fearing the prolongation of the subject
Dico ergo, quod Cauterium confert uniuersaliter omni complexioni, quae est cum materia, et absque materia: excaeptis duabus complexionibus, quae sunt complexio calida absque materia, et complexio sicca absque materia.	I say therefore, that the cautery is useful for all complexions, that is with material and without material: except for two complexions which are the hot complexion without material, and the dry complexion without material
In complexione autem calida et sicca cum materia dissenserunt.	In the hot and dry complexion with material they differ
Quidam enim dixerunt, quod Cauterium iuuatiuum est in ea.	Some indeed say that the cautery is useful in these matters
Et dixerunt alii contrarium illius, scilicet quod Cauterium non est conueniens in aegritudine, quae est ex caliditate et siccitate: quoniam natura ignis est caliditas: et inconueniens est, ut sanetur ex agritudine calida et sicca, cum calido et sicco.	Others have said the contrary, namely that Cauterium is not suitable for ailments caused by heat and dryness, because the nature of fire is heat: and it is inappropriate to heal from a heat and dry ailment with heat and dryness.
Et dixit ille qui dicit contrarium illius: quod per Cauterium fit iuuamentum in omni aegritudine calida et sicca, quae accidit in corporibus hominum: quoniam quando tu comparas corpus hominis, et humiditates eius, ad complexionem ignis, inuenis corpus hominis frigidum.	Others have said the contrary, namely that Cauterium is not suitable for treating ailments caused by heat and dryness, which arise in the bodies of men: for when you compare the body of a man to the nature of fire, you find the body of a man to be cool to the touch
Et ego quidem dico per sermonem eius: quia ex perimentum iam detexit mihi illud aliquotiens.	I too, however, have learned from experience that this is the case.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut ueniat super illud, nisi qui iam probatus est, et exercitatus in capitulo Cauterii exercitio ultimo, et cognouit diuersitatem complexionum hominum, et dispositionem aegritudinum in se ipsis, et caussas earum, et accidentia ipsarum, et spacium temporis earum.	It is true that this should not be assumed without testing, exercising the final exercise of Cauterium, and recognizing the diversity of the temperaments of men, and the causes and effects of ailments, and the speed of their course.
Ex reliquis autem complexionibus non est super uos timor: et praecipue in aegritudinibus frigidis et humidis.	Except in the case of extremely cold and humid temperaments, there is no reason to fear these things: and especially in the case of ailments caused by heat and moisture.
Iam enim conuenerunt omnes medici super eas: et non dissenserunt in iuuamento cum Cauterio in eis.	I have seen all physicians agree on this: and they do not hesitate to apply Cauterium in such cases.
Et scitote filii, quod ex secreto curationis per Cauterium cum igne, et bonitate eius super Cauterium cum medicina comburente est: quoniam ignis est simplex, cuius actio non peruenit, nisi ad membrum quod cauterisatur: et non nocet membro alio coniuncto cum eo, nisi nocumento paruo.	Note that the action of fire is simple, and its power does not extend beyond the part that is cauterized: and it does no harm to any other part connected to it, except for a slight burn.
Medicinae uero comburentis actio peruenit ad illud quod elongatur ex membris: et fortasse facit accidere in membro aegritudinem difficilis sanationis, et fortasse interficit.	The action of the burning medicine extends beyond the part which is cauterized: and perhaps makes the healing of the ailment more difficult in other parts, and perhaps causes death.
Ignis autem propter subtilitatem suam et bonitatem substantiae suae, non facit illud, nisi superfluat.	Fire, however, by its subtlety and the goodness of its material, does not cause this unless it be excessive.
Iam uero innotuit nobis illud per experimentum, propter longitudinem seruitutis et studii cum arte, et stationem super ueritatem rerum: et propter illud excusor a longitudine sermonis.	I am indeed aware of that through experiment and by the length of service and study with art, and the position above reality of things: and because of that from the length of speech.
Et si non esset, quia non licet huic libro meo, afferrem uobis secretum occultum in igne, et qualitatem operationis eius in corporibus expulsionis suae, qua expellit aegritudines sermone philosophico demonstratiuo, qui acueretur a mentibus uestris.	And if it should not be [said], since it is not fitting for this book of mine, I will nevertheless declare a secret hidden in fire, and the quality of the operation in the bodies expelled by it, which expels diseases with philosophical demonstration, agreeable to the thoughts of the prudent.
Et scitote filii, quod ipsi dissentiunt in tempore, in quo conuenit fieri cauterium, et ponunt melius tempus ueris.	And behold, sons, that they themselves dissent in the time when the cautery is to be made, and say that it is better to delay the time of your work.
Et ego dico, quod cauterium conuenit in omni tempore: propterea, quod nocumentum accidens propter tempus submergitur in iuuamento, quod attrahitur cum cauterio.	I say indeed that the cautery agrees in all time: forasmuch as the document is absorbed by moisture over time, which is attracted by the cautery.
Et praecipue si cauterium est propter dolores ex doloribus necessariis, fortibus, festinis, qui non tolerant tarditatem: propterea quod timetur ex eis, quod accidat malicia quae est maior, quam paruum nocumentum intrans propter tempus.	Above all, if the cautery is for necessary and urgent pains, strong, fast, which do not tolerate delay: for they fear the moisture which arises from the wound, which increases the malice which is greater than the slight abrasion caused by the passage of time.
Et non cadat in mentibus uestris o filii illud, quod non extimant, nisi uulgus et stolidi medici, scilicet quod illi aegritudini quae sanatur per cauterium, non est reditio semper: et ponunt illud consequens, et res non est sicut putant: propterea quod cauterium non est, nisi loco medicinae, quae alterat complexionem, et exiccat humiditates quae sunt caussae, quare accidunt dolores.	And do not let it be thought by anyone, sons, or physicians of little experience, that because it does not abate, it is therefore useless: for indeed it is not the cause of the disease that is cauterized, but the moisture and humors which are the cause of the disease.
Verumtamen cauterium superfluit super medicinam per uelocitatem ualetudinis suae, et uirtutem suae operationis, et uehementiam dominii sui: et possibile est, ut redeat aegritudo hora aliqua temporis secundum complexionem infirmi, et locationem aegritudinis suae, et uirtutem eius: et quod praeparatur in corpore eius ex aggregatione superfluitatum in eo: et quod peruenit ad ipsum in acquisitione sua ex cibis, et similibus illis ex caussis, nisi fit aegritudo, in qua administratur cauterium.	However, the cautery surpasses the art of medicine by the swiftness of its action, the excellence of its operation, and the extent of its domination: and it is possible that the disease will vanish at some time according to the complexion of the patient, the location of the disease, and the excellence of the operation: and that which is prepared in his body from the aggregation of superabundances in him: and which comes to him from the cause itself, except in the case of a disease in which the cautery is administered.
Aegritudo subtilis in membro paucarum superfluitatum, et humiditatum, sicut cauterium dentis, propter dolorem, et similia illi, possibile est enim, ut non redeat in eo ille dolor.	Acute pain in a limb with few superfluous and humid swellings, like a tooth cautery due to pain, is also possible for the enemy, so that it does not return in that area of pain.
Sed illud fit in paucis.	However, this is in few cases.</start_of_turn>
At uero sermo uulgi iterum, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, est sermo rectus: non ad illud quod ipsi intendunt in illo: quoniam ipsi credunt, quod non est curatio quae conferat cum medicina, neque cum alio post occasum cauterii.	Indeed, the word often returns, because cautery is the last of medicine. It is the right word: not to this which they themselves intend, because they believe that there is no cure which brings relief along with medicine, nor with anything following the cautery.</start_of_turn>
Res autem est econtrario illius, et intentio, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, non est, nisi quod quando nos administramus modos curationis in aliqua aegritudinum, et non conferunt illae medicinae: deinde administramus in fine rei cauterium, et confert: tunc inde cadit, quod cauterium est postremum mediciuae, non secundum intentionem quam intelligunt uulgus et multistolidorum medicorum.	But it is the contrary of that which they themselves think. For the intention of the cautery, which is the last of medicine, is not except when we administer methods of treatment in some ailment, and these do not bring relief; then we administer the cautery at the end of everything, and it brings relief: thus it is that the cautery is the last of medicine, not according to the intention which the vulgar and many learned men of medicine understand.</start_of_turn>
Antiqui autem dixerunt, quod cauterium cum auro est melius, quam cauterium cum ferro: et non dixerunt illud, nisi propter aequalitatem auri, et sublimitatem substantiae suae: et dixerunt, quod non facit pus locus cauterii.	The ancients said that the cautery with gold is better than the cautery with iron: and they did not say this except because of the equality of gold, and the fineness of its substance: and they said that it does not make pus at the site of the cautery.</start_of_turn
Verum non est illud absolute: quoniam ego iam probaui illud, et inueni, quod ipsum non facit illud in quibusdam corporibus absque aliis.	But this is not absolutely true: for I myself have seen this to be the case, and I have found that it does not make this in some bodies without other things.</start_of_turn
Et cauterium cum ipso est bonum, et melius quam cum ferro, sicut dixerunt.	And the cautery with itself is good, and better than with iron, as they themselves said.</start_of_turn>
Verumtamen quando tu ignis cauterium in igne ex auro, non declaratur tibi, quando ignitur secundum quantitatem quam uis, propter rubedinem auri: et quando properat ad ipsum frigus, et si addis super ipsum ignitionem, liquescit in igne, et uertitur in laminas.	But when you burn the cautery with gold in fire, you must not tell me when you light it, according to the quantity which you will, because of the redness of the gold: and when it approaches itself to the cold, and if you add more fuel to it, it liquefies in the fire, and turns into plates.</start_of_turn
Quare cadit artifex ex illo in occupationem: et propter illud fit Cauterium cum ferro apud nos uelocius et propinquius, ex rectitudine ad operationem.	Why does the artificer depart from that to the execution of the office? And because of this, the Cauterium with iron is applied to us more quickly and closer to the operation, from the straightness of the work.
Et ego quidem iam ordinaui hoc Capitulum in Cauterio, secundum capitula: et ordinaui ea a capite usque ad pedes: ut alleuient quaerenti illud quod uult ex eo.	I have indeed completed this Chapter on Cauterization, following the chapters: and I have directed them from the head to the feet: so that they may fulfill whatever the seeker wishes from this work
¶ De modo cauterizandi Caput in commissura coronali.	Regarding the cauterization of the head in the coronal suture.
Caput II.	Chapter 2: Regarding the head
Confert hic cauterizatio ad dominium humiditatis et frigiditatis super cerebrum: quae duae sunt caussae sodae, et multitudinis fluxus humorum ex capite ad partes oculorum et aurium, et multitudinis somni, et doloris dentium, et doloris gutturis: et uniuersaliter omnis aegritudinis, quae accidit ex frigiditate, sicut paralisis, et sodae, epilepsiae, et apoplexiae, et similia illis ex aegritudinibus.	Here the cauterization is applied to the lord of humidity and cold above the brain: which are two causes of sweat, and of the multitude of the flow of humors from the head to the eyes and ears, and of the multitude of sleep, and toothache, and throat pain: and generally all ailments that arise from cold, such as paralysis, and sweat, and convulsions, and apoplexy, and things similar to these ailments.
Modus cauterizationis est, ut praecipias infirmo: ut euacuetur in primis cum medicina solutiua mundificante caput tribus noctibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod exigit uirtus infirmi, et eius aetas, et consuetudo eius.	The method of cauterization is as follows: immediately before the operation, the physician should give the patient a purgative that will empty the bowels three or four nights before, according to the nature of the patient, his age, and his habit
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radi faciat caput suum cum nouacula.	Then he should order him to shave his head with a razor.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas quadratum, ita quod iam posuit manus suas super pectus suum.	Then make him sit between your hands, with your hands placed over his shoulders
Deinde pone radicem palmae tuae super radicem nasi sui inter oculos suos.	Then place the heel of your palm on the root of his nose between his eyes
Vbicumque ergo peruenerit digitus tuus medius, signa locum illum cum incausto.	Wherever your middle finger reaches, that is the place to apply the cautery.
Deinde igni Cauterium Oliuare: cuius haec est forma.	Then apply the Cauterium with Olive Oil: thus it has this shape
Deinde pone ipsum super locum signatum cum incausto, descensione, qua constringatur manus tua paulatim, et tu reuolues ipsum.	Then place it over the marked place with the burn, descending gradually, until your hand is clasped.
Deinde leua manum tuam uelociter, et aspicias locum.	Then draw your hand quickly away and grasp the place.
Quod si uides iam detegi ex osse quantitatem capitis alkiel, aut quantitatem zeuherbi, tunc eleua manum tuam.	If you see any part of bone or flesh of the head or hair remaining, then draw your hand away from it.
Et si non, itera manum tuam ferro ipso, aut cum alio ab ipso si infrigidatur: donec uideantur ossa, quae dixi tibi.	And if not, repeat your hand with the iron itself, or with another which is warmed: until you see the bone which I mentioned to you.
Deinde sume aliquid ex sale, et solue illud in aqua, et imbibe in ipso cotum, et pone super locum: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then take some salt and dissolve it in water, and drink from it: and apply it to the place: and keep it for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, et dimitte illum super locum, donec destruatur eschara ignis.	Then apply butter soaked in oil over it, and keep the lamp above the place until the eschar is destroyed by fire.
Deinde cura illud cum unguento tetrapharmacon, usquequo sanetur.	Then care for the place with unguents until it is healed
Iam dixerunt, quod quanto uulnus plus remanet apertum, emittit pus: quare est melius et magis iuuatiuum.	I have said that the greater the wound is, the more pus it emits: which is better and more effective
Et dixerunt quidam eorum, ut cauterizetur cutis usque ad os: et teneatur Cauterium, donec aduratur quiddam spissitudinis ossis.	And some people say that the skin should be cauterized until the bone is reached: and keep the Cauterium until some part of the thickness of the bone has been burnt
Deinde radatur post illud quod adustum est ex osse, deinde curetur.	Then it will be removed after that which has been scorched from the bone, and it will be cured
Et dicunt alii, quod oportet ut cum cauterio perueniatur ad ultimum, donec imprimat in os impressionem for tem, ita quod cadat os, quod fit sicut forma kirate: aut instrumentum quod mulieres ponunt infuso alphabeti parui: et extimant, quod exspirantur ex hoc loco uapores capitis, et dimittatur uulnus apertum tempore longo.	And others say that it is necessary that when cauterizing it should be continued until the very end, until an imprint of the instrument is left on the bone, so that the bone will break: or the instrument which women use for tying up their hair: and they say that the vapor of the head escapes from this place slowly: and the wound will be closed up in a long time
Deinde curetur, donec consolidetur.	Then he cares until consolidated.
Mihi autem non uidentur hae duae species Cauterii omnino nisi in quibusdam hominibus secundum uiam timoris.	Neither of two species of cautery is harmful to anyone except in some people according to the degree of fear.
Et dimittere ipsum, apud me est melius cum salute ipsius.	And dismiss it, for it is better with me than with your health.
Debilitatur enim caput ex solutione continuitatis ipsius naturalis: sicut testificati sumus in reliquis membris: et praecipue quando caput infirmi debile est natura: et species quidem Cauterii prima est magis salua et melior apud me, et ea utor: operare ergo cum ea in salute.	The head suffers from the solution of its natural continuity: as we have testified in other limbs: and especially when the head is weak by nature: of which the first kind of cautery is the most safe and better for me, and that which is most useful: for I work with it in health
¶ De modo cauterizandi capitis in dolore totius capitis.	In this way cauterizes the head in the pain of the whole head
Caput III.	Head Chapter III
Quando in toto Capite accidit dolor chronicus: et prolongatur illud in infirmo, et utitur hyeris, et cochiis, et caputpurgiis, et oleis, et empleumatis.	When in the whole head happens chronic pain: and it lasts in the sick person, and uses herbs, and ointments, and poultices, and oils, and implements.
Et praecipue si iam cauterizatum est cauterio uno, quod narrauimus, et non confert ei aliquid ex illis: tunc considera.	And especially if it has been cauterized with one cautery, which we mentioned, and does not cause it anything of those things: then consider it
Nam si caput infirmi est fortis creationis natura, et non est debile, et inuenit frigus uehemens: tunc cauteriza cum cauterio alio sub illo parum.	For if the head of the sick person is strong by nature, and is not weak, and finds cold or heat: then cauterize with another cautery under that slightly
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio, do nec pertranseat cutis, et discooperiatur ex osse quantitas, quam narrauimus.	Then cauterize it over all the horns of the head with that cautery, so that it does not pass through the skin, and uncover from the bone the quantity that we mentioned
Et cauteriza ipsum cauterio uno in occipitio capitis sui, in loco qui nominatur uas: et est locus in quo ponitur uentosa: et eleua matum tuam in hoc, et non discooperias os.	And cauterize it with one cautery in the back of the head in the place that is called the vault: and it is the place where the brains are placed: and raise your hand in this, and do not uncover the bone
Infirmus enim inuenit propter illud dolorem uehementem, et diuersum a dolore reliquorum cauteriorum capitis omnium.	The sick person finds because of this heat and diverse from the pain of the other cauteries of the head all together

When it happens in the part of the head that there is pain and swelling, or that the pain extends up to the eye, and it evacuates with physicians who are making the head better, and the rest of the treatment is administered, as I have said in the discourse on diseases, and it does not suffice for everything: then cauterization is to be performed in two ways: either with acute burning medicine or with an iron.</start_of_turn
Cauterium autem cum medicina acuta comburente, est, ut accipias dentem unum allii, et excortices ipsum, et abscindas extremitates eius ex duobus lateribus.

Introduce it there under the skin until it is hidden: then bind over it with a bandage of moderate constriction and leave it for fifteen hours. Then remove it, and extract the tooth, and leave it out for two days or three: afterwards put on a wet cushion over it in butter, until the place has healed.

Et deuita cauterizationem speciei, quae accidit ex exiccatione, et spasmo nerui.	And you must apply the Cautery to the kind which arises from constriction and nervous spasm
Quando curas hanc speciem torturae cum hyeris, et caputpurgiis, et gargarismis, et non confert curatio tua, tunc oportet ut cauterizes infirmum tribus Cauteriis: uno apud radicem auris, et secundo parum inferius a timpore suo, et tertio apud coniunctionem duorum labiorum.	When you have cured this kind of torment with urine and fumigations, and vomiting, and hiccups, and the cure does not suffice, then you must burn the patient three times with the Cautery: once at the root of the ear, and once a little lower from the temple, and once at the junction of the two lips.
Et pone Cauterium tuum ex contrario partis infirmae.	And place your Cautery on the side opposite the diseased part
Quoniam mollificatio non accidit, nisi in parte quae apparet sana.	For the softening does not take place except in the part which appears healthy.
Et forma cauterizationis est, ut cauterizes ipsum Cauterio in directo extremitatis auris superioris sub cornu capitis parum: et alio in timpore: cuius longitudo sit secundum longitudinem pollicis.	And the form of the Cautery is that you burn the Cautery itself with the outer edge of the upper ear under the earlobe a little: and the other in the temple. And the length of the burn should be as long as the length of the thumb
Et depone manum tuam cum cauterio, donec comburatur quantitas medietatis spissitudinis cutis.	And hold your hand with the Cautery until the quantity of the middle third of the thickness of the skin has been consumed
Et haec est forma Cauterii, et est species ex cultellari, cuius forma praemissa est: uerumtamen non est subtilior ea parum, sicut uides: et oportet ut sit cultellus in eo superfluae grossitudinis parum.	And this is the form of the Cautery, and it is like a knife whose form is like this: indeed it is not finer than that of a needle: and you must make the knife to be of such a size as that it is not too thick

Quod si redeat aliquod ex pilis post horam, et mollificetur palpebra: tunc itera Cauterium super illum locum, sicut fecisti in primis.	And if some hair should remain after an hour, and the eyelashes are softened: then apply the cautery once more to the same place as before
Si autem pili sunt in inferiori: tunc cauteriza ipsam, donec eleuetur ad locum suum naturalem: et aequetur ut non pungant pili oculum.	But if the hair is in the lower part: then cauterize it there, until they rise to their natural place: and make sure that they do not puncture the eye
¶ De modo cauterizandi cum medicina comburente in eodem casu.	In the same way as with the burning cautery, when using cautery with medicinal herbs.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter XVIII

Fac ex charta de panno formam folii myrti.	Make from a piece of linen a shape like a myrtle leaf.
Deinde accipe ex sapone cognito, et ex calce non imbibita ex unoquoque pondus uncia I aut quasi illud: deinde tere ea simul contritione bona, et fac illud cum festinatione, ut non infrigidetur.	Then take from soap the size of a bean, and from the heel of your hand take an inch or almost that: then mix these together with a little warmth, and do this with a gentle touch, so as not to freeze it
Deinde ex pande ex eo super chartam quam fecisti sicut formam folii myrti, et pone ipsum super palpebram oculi unius, aut duorum.	Then from the palm of your hand over the chart which you have made like the shape of a myrtle leaf, and place it over the pupil of one eye, or two eyes.
Et pone sub oculo cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: et caput infirmi sit in sinu tuo.	And place under the eye a sponge soaked in albumin: and the head of the patient is in your lap.</start_of_turn>

Et tu moueas ipsum quotiens sentit infirmus mordicationem medicinae: quoniam inuenit eius mordicatio sicut ignis.	And you will move it whenever the patient feels the bite of the medicine: for its bite is like fire.</start_of_turn>
Dum ergo perseuerat hoc quod ipse inuenit mordicatio, tunc dimitte medicinam, et moue ipsam cum digito tuo.	While you have done this and found the bite, then remove the medicine and move it with your finger.</start_of_turn
Cum ergo quiescit mordicatio, tunc remoue medicinam, et ablue oculum cum aqua.	When the bite has subsided, then remove the medicine and wash the eye with water.</start_of_turn
Et considera tunc, si uides palpebram eleuari, sicut eleuatur apud contractionem cum igne, aut cum incisione, est bene: et si non, tunc itera super ipsam ex medicina super locum, in quo non imprimit medicina, et non denigrat, donec aequetur operatio tua, et contrahatur oculus.	Consider then, if the pupil is raised, like that which is raised with contraction with fire, or with incision, it is well: and if not, then repeat the medicine over the place where the medicine does not stick, and does not cause harm, until your operation is complete and the eye is contracted.</start_of_turn>

Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento diaphinicon, aut alio, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointment of diaphanicon, or something else, until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
Et necesse est tibi apud operationem, ut custodias ultima custodia, ne in oculum cadat aliquid ex medicina.	And it is necessary for you during the operation to take care that nothing of the medicine falls into the eye.</start_of_turn

¶ De modo cauterizandi in Fistula lachrymali.	Concerning the cauterization of the fistula of the tear duct.
Caput XIX.	Chapter XIX
Quando curas Fistulam, cum eo quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc, oportet ut cauterizes ipsam secundum hunc modum.	When you have treated the fistula, when it is not cured by your treatment: then it is necessary to cauterize it according to this method
Praecipe infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo, et teneat caput eius minister inter manus suas taliter, ut non moueatur, neque agitetur cum capite suo.	Command the patient to place his head in your lap and hold his head between your hands like this, so that it does not move or shake with his head
Deinde pone Cotum infusum in albugine oui, aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum eius: deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	Then place the soaked sponge in the white of the eye, or on the mucous membrane of the eyelashes above his eye: then ignite the Cauterium, which is in this shape.
Sit concauum, sicut forma cannae pennae uulturis ab extremitate una, cum qua fit Cauterium: et si uis sit penetrans usque ad extremitatem aliam, et si uis sit sursum sic tenta.	Hold it concave, like the shape of a feather quill at one end, as it is with the Cauterium: and if you wish it to penetrate until the other end, and if you wish it to be above, do so with the attempt.
Verumtamen hoc concauum est melius ad opus tuum.	It is better to hold it concave for your work
Deinde exprime fistulam, si est aperta, et extrahe ex ea saniem, et exicca ipsam: et si non est aperta, tunc aperi eam, et extrahe pus eius.	Then express the fistula, if it is open, and extract from it the pus, and dry it up: and if it is not open, then open it up, and extract the pus from it
Deinde pone tunc super eam Cauterium, quod fit ignitum ualde.	Then place over the fistula the Cauterium which is ignited lukewarmly
Et tene cum eo manum tuam parumper apud Cauterium ab oculo, ad partem nasi, ut non erret manus tua, aut inquietetur infirmus: et ponas Cauterium in adipe oculi, et corrumpas ipsum.	And hold your hand close to the Cauterium from the eye towards the nose, so that your hand does not move or shake: and place the Cauterium on the fat of the eye, and burn it through
Si ergo peruenis in principio Cauterii tui usque ad os, erit bene.	If therefore you proceed with the Cauterization from the beginning until the bone, it will be well.
Et si non: tunc itera Cauterium semel, aut bis, si indiges illo: et dimitte illud tribus diebus.	If not: then repeat the Cauterization once or twice, if you tolerate it: and discharge it in three days.
Deinde pone Cotum cum butyro, et cura ipsum cum unguento exiccatiuo, donec sanetur.	Then place a compress with butter, and care for it with an unguent dressing, until it heals.
Quod si praeterierint ei quadraginta dies, et non sanatur: tunc pone super ipsum medicinam acutam corrosiuam, donec detegatur os: et rade ipsum secundum quod uenit in capitulo suo.	If for forty days they do not heal: then place upon it a sharp corrosive medicine, until the bone is exposed: and then remove it according to what is written in its chapter
Et est modus alius Cauterii fistulae, quem quidam primi dixerunt.	And there is another method of Cauterization of fistulas, which some of the former have said.
Intende ad locum fistulae, et finde ipsum: deinde pone in ipsam fissuram camahan subtile, id est, Cannulam subtilem, cuius forma haec est.	Direct it to the place of the fistula, and find it: then place in the fistula a thin needle, that is, a needle with a fine point, of which the shape is this
Et funde in ipsum quantitatem drachmae ex plumbo liquefacto, et tene manum tuam cum Canna retentione bona, et non moueatur infirmus omnino, ut non currat, uel perueniat plumbum liquefactum ad oculum eius.	And mix in it the quantity of lead from a penny, and hold your hand with the needle firmly in place, and do not move the patient at all, so that it does not run, or that the liquefied lead should not reach his eye
Et oportet ut ponas super oculum infirmi cotum infusum in albumine oui, aut in aqua.	And it is necessary that you place upon the eye of the patient a compress soaked in albumin or in water.
Plumbum enim comburit locum fistulae, et sanat ipsam sanatione mirabili.	Lead therefore burns the place of the fistula, and heals it with a miraculous healing
Quod si sanatur fistula, cum eo quod diximus ex Cauterio, et curatione, est bonum.	When the fistula is healed, with what we have said of the Cauterization and the treatment, it is good
Et si non, tunc necesse est administrare foramen nasi, et reducere fistulam ad cursum nasi, secundum quod ueniet in loco suo sibi proprio.	And if not, then it is necessary to administer a nose-opening passage, and reduce the fistula to the course of the nose, according to what is written in its own place

When you treat these splits, when you have done what we said in the instruction on ailments, and the cure has not been effected, then burn a small cautery with this shape
Et sit concauitas eius secundum subtilitatem cultelli.	And let the curvature of it be according to the thickness of the knife.
Deinde pone ipsum ignitum festinanter in ipsis fissuris, donec perueniat cauterium ad profundum fissurarum.	Then place the flame quickly in these splits, until the cautery reaches the depth of the split.
Deinde cura ipsum cum caeroto, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with the cautery until it is healed
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fistula Oris.	In the same way, cauterize in the fistula of the mouth.
Caput XXI.	Chapter XXI.
Quando accidit apostema in radice gingiuae, aut in palato, aut in radicibus dentium: deinde facit pus, et rumpitur: postea antiquatur, et currit pus, et fit fistula: deinde curas ipsam, et non confert in ea curatio, tunc oportet ut ignias cauterium secundum quantitatem, quod capiat in fistula.	When swelling occurs at the root of the tooth, or in the palate, or in the roots of the teeth: then pus forms, and it ruptures: afterwards it is treated, pus runs, and a fistula is formed: then one must burn the cautery in this quantity, as much as is taken up in the fistula
Deinde intromitte ipsum ignitum in foramine fistulae, et tene manum tuam, donec perueniat ferrum ignitum ad profundum eius, et ultimum eius: fac illud semel, aut duabus uicibus.	Then insert the flame into the cavity of the fistula, and hold your hand, until the iron is consumed by the depth of it, and its extremity: do this once, or twice at most.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud, cum eo quod diximus de curatione usquequo curetur.	Then care for it afterwards, as we said concerning the cure until it is healed.
Si ergo abscinditur sanies, et sanatur, erit bonum.	If it is cut away when healthy, and healed, it is good.
Et si non, tunc necesse est detegere locum, et auferre os corrupum secundum quod ueniet in capite suo.	And if not, then it is necessary to remove the corrupted bone according to what comes to pass in its head
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Gingiuis, et Dentibus mollificatis.	On the method of cauterizing in the Gingiues, and softening of the Dentibus.
Caput XXII.	Regarding the method of cauterizing in the Gingiues, and softening of the Dentibus.
Quando mollificatur gingiua propter humiditates, et mouentur dentes, et curas eam cum medicinis, et non confert: tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	When softened by moisture, the Gingiues and teeth move, and the physician must take care with them as with colleagues, and must not cause injury: then place the patient's head in your lap
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma ueniet post haec, ita ut ponas Cannulam super dentem: et intromitte in ea Cauterium ignitum festinanter: et tene manum tuam parumper, donec sentiat infirmus calorem ignis iam peruenisse ad radicem dentis.	Then apply the cautery, whose form will appear afterwards, so that you place the Cautery over the tooth: and introduce the flame into it quickly: and hold your hand near the patient, until the patient feels the heat of the flame has reached the root of the tooth.
Et eleua manum tuam: deinde itera Cauterium aliquotiens, secundum quod uis.	And lift your hand away: then repeat the Cautery a few times, as you wish.
Deinde impleat infirmus os suum aqua salis, et teneat ipsam hora una: et exspuat ipsam.	Then let the patient rinse their mouth with salt water, and keep it for an hour: and then expel it.
Dens enim motus firmatur, et gingiua mollificata stringitur, et siccatur humiditas corrupta.	The tooth will then be firm, and the Gingiues softened, and the corrupt moisture will dry up
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Dentium.	Regarding the method of cauterizing in toothache.
Caput XXIII.	When a toothache is severe, and the tooth is sensitive to cold, heat, or biting, and the pain persists, or is not relieved by other means, then take hold of the patient's head and open their mouth widely.
Quando dolor dentis est propter frigiditatem, aut in ipso est frigus, aut uermis, et non confert curatio cum medicinis: tunc Cauterium in ipso est secundum duos modos: aut Cauterium cum butyro: aut cauterium cum igne.	When the toothache is caused by cold, or by heat, or biting, and the pain does not subside with treatment by physicians: then apply the Cautery in two ways: either with butter or with fire
Cauterium autem eius cum butyro est, ut accipias butyrum uaccinum, et bullias ipsum in cochleari ferreo, aut in uenera.	The butter must be taken from cows which have eaten well, and the Cautery must be placed on the tooth in a pan or crucible made of iron or stone
Deinde accipe cotum, et inuolue ipsum super extremitatem tentae.	Then take hold of the tooth, and place the Cautery over the tip of the tooth
Deinde submerge ipsum in butyro bullito: et pone ipsum super dentem dolorosum festinanter, et tene ipsum donec infrigidet: deinde itera ipsum aliquotiens, donec perueniat uirtus ignis ad radicem dentis.	Then immerse the affected part in boiling butter: and place the part above the aching tooth quickly, and hold it there until it cools: then repeat the procedure several times until the heat of the fire reaches the root of the tooth.
Et si uis, submerge lanam, aut cotum in butyro frigido, et pone ipsum super dentem dolentem: et pone super ipsum ferrum ignitum, donec perueniat ignis ad profundum concauitatis dentis.	Or if desired, immerse wool or cotton in cold butter, and place it above the aching tooth: and place upon it a burning iron until the fire reaches the depth of the cavity of the tooth.
Cauterizatio autem eius cum igne est, ut intendas ad cannulam aeris, aut cannulam ferri.	The cauterization of it with fire is to be done, as in the case of a wound, so as to bring about the escape of air or iron.
Et sit in corpore eius quiddam grossitudinis, ut non perueniat acuitas ignis ad os infirmi.	And let there be some bulk in its body, so that the fire may not penetrate too deeply into the bone of the infirm person.
Deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma ueniet: et pone ipsum super illum dentem: et tene manum tuam, donec infrigidetur Cauterium.	Then let the Cauterium take its natural shape: and place it above the tooth: and hold your hand until the Cauterium cools down.
Fac illud aliquotiens, nam dolor remouebitur, aut in illo eodem die, aut die alio.	Repeat this several times, for the pain will disappear, or on the same day, or on another day
Et oportet in impressione illius Cauterii, ut impleat infirmus os suum buyro bono, et teneat ipsum hora una: deinde exspuat ipsum.	And it is necessary to press down upon the Cauterium so that the infirm person may suck his own butter from his bone, and keep it for an hour: then remove it.
Et haec est forma Cauterii.	This is the form of the Cauterium.
Cauteriza cum quacumque extremitate uis secundum quod est possibile: et haec est forma Cannulae.	Cauterize with whatever extremity you wish, according to what is possible: and this is the form of the Canula.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Strophulis.	In this way the cauterization is to be done in the teeth.
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter XXIII.
Quando Strophulae sunt a phlegmate, et ab humiditatibus frigidis, et non sunt obedientes digestioni per mecicinas, et uis digestionem earum uelociter: tunc igni Cauterium concauum, cuius forma est haec.	When the teeth are affected by phlegmas and by cold humors, and do not obey digestion by medicines, and you wish to hasten their digestion: then cauterize the cavity, which is of this shape
Habens duas extremitates apertas, ut egrediatur fumus apud Cauterium ab extremitate altera: et pone ipsum ignitum super ipsum apostema semel, et secundo, si indiges illo, donec perueniat ad profundum apostematis.	Having two open extremities, like smoke emerging from Cauterium from the other limb: place the flame upon the latter and, if it does not suffice, continue until it reaches the depth of the cavity.
Quod si apostema est paruum: tunc pone Cauterium secundum quantitatem apostematis.	If the cavity is small: then place Cauterium according to the size of the cavity.</start_of_turn>
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super ipsum cotum infusum in butyro, donec remoueatur quod combussit ignis.	Then remove the flame after three days, and place upon it a pad soaked in butter, until the burn has subsided.</start_of_turn>

When cough and pulmonary carbuncles are from cold humilities, and the patient has neither fever nor phthisis, and old cough: then burn with two Cauteriums above the nipple in depressed places, gentle, thick, and dark.</start_of_turn
Et cauterio alio in medio pectoris inter duas mammillas: et sit cauterium cannulae secundum formam quae praecessit.	And the cautery is done with another instrument in the middle of the chest between two nipples: and let the cautery be according to the shape which preceded.
Et si uis sit cauterizatio tua punctando cum cauterio, quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma praecessit in punctatione doloris aurium: et sint puncta ex triginta punctis usque quasi ad alia.	And if you wish the cautery to be made by puncture with the cautery, which is called Punctum, whose shape preceded in the puncture of the ear: let there be punctures from thirty punctures up to almost as many
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then take care of that which preceded, until it is healed.
Et iam sit cauterium habens tres ramos: secundum hanc formam.	And let the cautery be carried out with three branches: according to this shape
Quare alleuiatur cum eo cauterizatio, quando tu facis cum eo uice una tria Cauteria.	For the surrounding parts are relaxed when you do this with three Cauteria at once.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Titillico, in dislocatione Humeri.	Thus the cautery is done in Titillico, in dislocation of the Humerus.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter XXVII.</start_of_turn>
Quando dislocatur caput adiutorii caussa humiditatum, et nonfigitur in hora reditus sui a dislocatione sua, donec sit illud ei consuetudo reditionis, deinde dislocatur a paruo motu, qui accidit sicut nos iam testificauimus illud, tunc oportet ut reducas dislocationem in primis.	When the head of the adductor is dislocated by the cause of humidity, and does not return to its place in the hour following its dislocation, until it has become accustomed to the resumption of its place, then it must be displaced by a slight movement, which as we have testified above, then it is necessary to reduce the dislocation immediately.</start_of_turn>
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, aut super latus sanum.	Then the patient is laid down on his back, or on the sound side.</start_of_turn>
Deinde eleua cutim, quae est in interiori Titillici ad superiora cum digitis manus tuae sinistrae: et si iunctura dislocatur ad interiora.	Then lift the skin which is inside the Titillicum towards the upper parts with your left hand: and if the dislocation has gone inwards.</start_of_turn

Et quandoque fit cauterizatio cum cauterio habente tria uerua, quare fit figura cauterizationis tunc sex cauteriorum: et sunt uerua secundum subtilitatem tentae.	When the cautery is performed with a cautery having three hairs, the figure of the cautery then consists of six cauteries: and the hairs are stretched according to their length.
Et haec est forma cauterii habentis tria uerua.	This is the figure of the cautery which has three hairs.
Et quandoque additur super hunc modum unum, quare sunt cauteria octo.	And when one more is added in this way, there are eight cauteries in all
Deinde pone super cauterium porros contritos cum sale.	Then place upon the cautery the hairs bound together with salt.
Deinde fac adhaerere infirmum tranquillitati, ut non moueatur membrum tempore aliquo, donec confortetur.	Then make the patient steady and calm, so that the limb does not move at any time until it is comfortable
Et si dislocatio est ad superiora, et raro fit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super humerum cauterio clauili, aut cauteriis multis punctando.	And if displacement has occurred to the upper parts, and this rarely happens, then cauterize it upon the shoulder with the cautery of the claw, or with many punctures.
Nam iunctura firmatur, et remouetur humiditas: et sanatur infirmus.	For the joining is firm, and the moisture is evacuated: and the patient is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Stomachum.	On the method of cauterizing the stomach
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter XXVIII.
Quando accidunt in Stomacho frigus et humiditates multae, donec extrahant ipsum a complexione sua, et multiplicentur catarri ad ipsum, et assiduas modos curationis, et non confert: tunc oportet ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat crura sua, et manus suas.	When in the stomach there are cold and many humilities, until you have expelled it from its composition, and multiplied the catarrh towards it, and applied various methods of treatment, and you do not confer: then it is necessary that the patient lie down on his back, extend his limbs, and move his hands
Deinde cauteriza cum tribus cauteriis, cauterio sub cochleari pectoris quantitate digiti unius cum cauterio clauili, et duobus cauteriis inferius a duobus lateribus cauterii unius, donec ueniat figura cauteriorum triangulata.	Then cauterize with three cauteries, with a cautery under the collar of the breast of the size of a single digit with the claw cautery, and two cauteries below from two sides of the single cautery, until you obtain the triangular figure of the cauteries.
Et elonga inter utraque ut non coniungantur, quando facient pus.	And lengthen between each so that they do not join, when they make pus
Et sit profunditas cauterii quantitas duarum tertiarum grossitudinis cutis.	The depth of the burn should be equal to two-thirds of the thickness of the skin.
Et sit figura cauteriorum secundum hanc formam sine additione: et si uis cauteriza cauterio magno in medio stomachi secundum hanc formam: et sit cauterium quo fit hoc cauterium unum secundum figuram circuli secundum hanc formam.	The burn should be square in shape without adding any [irregularities]: if you wish to burn in the middle of the stomach according to this shape, then the burn should be as big as this burn alone according to the circular shape of this
Et cauterizatur stomachus punctando ei qui terretur ab hoc cauterio: et est, ut signes super stomachum punctum secundum quantitatem, quam uis cum encaustro: deinde cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio puncti: deinde cura ipsum cum curatione, quae praecessit donec sanetur.	The burn is cauterized by pricking the area around it which has been scorched by the burn: and it is that the signs on the stomach should be in number according to the quantity of the burn. Then cauterize the burn itself with the burn of the puncture. Then care for the burn with care until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Epar frigidum.	In the manner of cauterizing with cold:
Caput XXIX.	So it is necessary to know how to cauterize with cold in order to preserve life and limb.
Quando accidit in Epate dolor ex frigiditate et humiditate, aut ex uentositate grossa, donec egrediatur a complexione sua naturali egressione superflua, et curatur infirmus, cum eo quod diximus, et non proficit in illo: tunc oportet ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam, et signes cum encaustro tria cauteria secundum hanc figuram, et hanc quantitatem eandem super Epar inferius ab hypocundriis, ubi peruenit cubitus hominis: et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium secundum grossitudinem digiti: et sit cauterium secundum longitudinem corporis rectum: et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio multum.	When it happens in the case of pain due to cold and humidity, or from a large wound, until it comes out naturally from its natural configuration, and the sick person is cured, as we have said, and has not progressed in this: then it is necessary to cover the sick person with his own bed and to make three burns with the cautery, according to this shape and this quantity on the lower part of the Ep, where the elbow of a man lies: and let there be space between every burn according to the width of a finger. And let the burn be according to the length of the body from the rectum: and do not press your hand too much with the burn
Et sit quantitas eius quod aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, quantitas medietatis eius non additum: et sit infirmus stans super pedes suos.	And let the quantity of the burn be such as to burn out the thickness of the skin, without adding the middle quantity: and let the sick person stand on his own feet.
Si autem non est stans, tunc sit iacens, qui iam extendit crura sua, et eleuauit brachia sua.	If he is not able to stand, then let him lie down, who has extended his legs and raised his arms
Haec est forma cauterii.	This is the form of the cautery.
Et tibi quidem possibile est, ut cauterizes ista cauteria cum cauterio cultellari, quando tecum est subtilitas et prudentia in arte.	And indeed it is possible that these cauteries are performed with the cautery of a knife, when there is skill and prudence in the art.
Et custodi te, ut non ultime procedas in cauterizatione, et aduratur spissitudo cutis totius, quare aduratur corpus totum, et perueniat ad intestina: quoniam cutis illic est subtilis, scias ergo illud.	Beware lest you go too far with the cautery, and that you burn the whole body, because the body is thereby burned through to the intestines: for the skin there is thinness there, as you know well.</start_of_turn>

Resudet enim aqua citrina, et sit cauterium secundum hanc formam.	The urine is citrine: and the cautery must be in this form.

When the belly is in a state of heat and moisture from cold and dampness, until it has become weak in holding and digesting, which are in the stomach and intestines: and it is cured by the methods of treatment and not by nature: and you must give the patient the power to tolerate the excessive heat of the cautery: then cauterize it with a large cautery over the stomach, as it is done for the cautery of the stomach with the circular cautery, and four cauteries around the navel, with a nail cautery under the skin: and a cautery over the omentum above the intestines, or two cauteries.
Et si uides humiditates exuberantes, et infirmum tolerantem illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio super pectinem, et cauterio super omne ilium: et fortasse addes duo cauteria parua super stomachum prope magnum.	If the moisture has become excessive and the patient tolerates it, then burn the [affected area] with a cautery over the navel and over every ileum.

When in the rectum are many old hemorrhoids, or one, and are from thick, cold, or moist humours, and are cured by that which we have said in the preceding discourse, and do not require cure: then burn three cauteries over the lower spin of the loin under the almond-shaped area triangularly, and a burn under the navel like two fingers.
Et si cogitas, quod stomachus eius infrigidatus sit, et cibus eius non digeratur, et faciem eius uides apostemari, tunc cauteriza eum super stomachum cauterio magno, secundum quod praecessit: et cauterio super Epar eius, et alio super Splenem ipsius, cum cauterio clauili: et dimitte cauterium apertum tempore aliquo: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.

When it happens in the reins that there is pain from cold or from great swelling, and it is diminished through this from that which makes the patient infirm, then it is necessary to cauterize it above the marrow above the kidneys, with cautery over every kidney along with the cautery of the claw, of which there is memory.
Et fortasse cauterizamus ipsum secundo in ipso almeidatu.	And perhaps we cauterize it again in the same cavity.
Quare uenient tria lineata.	Because there will arise three lines.

When there is weakness in the bladder, and softening from gravel and moisture until the patient does not retain urine, then cauterize it in the lower part of the belly above the bladder, where the hair of the testicles begins, and cauterize from the right side of the belly and from the left side of it: and let the length of that cautery be as much as the breadth of the thumb: and cauterize the lower back, or with two cauteries, if you like: and let that be according to what precedes the cautery of the claw

When cold and moisture abound in the matrix and impede its impregnation, and its menstrual blood is corrupted, its period is delayed, and there is pain in its companion, then it is necessary to cauterize three times around the navel, as we mentioned in the cauterization of the uterus, and to cauterize over the lower part of the navel, or to make two cauterizations: and let the cauterization be blunt.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Ancham in dislocatione.	In the dislocation of the Ancham, cauterize three times around the navel, and over the lower part of the navel, or make two cauterizations: and let the cauterization be blunt.

Quando effunduntur humiditates mucosae ad pixidem Anchae, et fiunt caussa exitus eius a loco suo: et signum illius est, quod prolongatur crus super alterum, quando comparantur adinuicem: et inuenitur locus dislocationis in eo uacuus.	When moisture of the mucous membrane flows down to the heel of the Ancham, and becomes the cause of its displacement from its place: and its sign is that the heel rests upon the instep, when they are compared together: and the place of dislocation is found in that hollow space.
Oportet ergo ut cauterizes infirmum super pixidem Anchae ipsius cauterio simili circulo: postquam tu signas cum encaustro in circumitu pixidis, sicut reuoluitur: et ut cadat ipsa pixis in medio circuli.	It is therefore necessary to cauterize the diseased heel of the Ancham with a cautery similar to a circle: after having drawn a circle around the heel with the cautery, as it is returned: and let the heel fall into the middle of the circle.
Et sit cauterium cuius forma praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi.	And let the cautery be of the form which we mentioned in the cauterization of the stomach.

Quando accidit dolor in pixide anchae, et sunt caussa illius frigus et humiditates: et curatur infirmus cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, et antiquatur illud: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum ab humoribus grossis cum pillulis foetidis, aut cum pillulis artificialibus, et similibus.	When pain occurs in the testicles, and the cause is cold and moisture: the physician should treat the patient with something which we have mentioned previously, and not leave the treatment uncompleted; for it will become old. Then it is necessary to remove the patient from the thick humours with foul pills, or with artificial pills, and the like.
Deinde cauteriza eum.	Then cauterize him.
Et modus cauterii in ea est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum medicinis adurentibus, aut cauterium cum igne.	And the manner of cauterization in these two ways: either with cautery with burning medicines, or with cautery with fire.
Cauterium cum igne, est secundum multos modos.	Cautery with fire is in many ways
Quorum unus est, ut cauterizes super pixidem anchae ipsius tribus cauteriis triangulatis, secundum hanc formam.	One of them is that you cauterize over the testicles three times with triangular cautery, according to this form.
Et fac eis profunditatem bonam, uel malam.	And make the depth good, or bad
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium quantitatis grossitudinis digiti: sitque cauterium oliuare.	And there should be space between each cautery equal to the thickness of a finger: and let the cautery be oily
Quandoque autem fit cauterium in medio super caput anchae ipsius.	When, however, the cautery is done in the middle over the head of the testicles.
Quare sunt quatuor cauteria.	Then there are four cauteries
Et si uis cauteriza cum circulo, cuius praecessit forma in cauterizatione dislocationis anchae, uno: ut sit circulus continens ancham totam.	And if you cauterize in a circle, whose form precedes the cautery of dislocation of the testicles, one: so that it surrounds the whole testicles
Et combure spissitudinem cutis totius.	And burn the hairiness of the whole skin
Iste est modus cauterii in Sciatica, quando dolor est adhaerens anchae ipsi, et non extenditur usque ad coxam et crus.	This is the manner of cautery in Sciatica, when the pain adheres to the testicles and does not extend until the cox and the thigh
Si autem extenditur usque ad coxam et crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis super coxam, super locum ad quem innuit illic infirmus, in quo est dolor, et cauterio tuo super cauillam quatuor digitis ad partem syluestrem parumper: et sit cauterium cultellare.	If it extends until the cox and the thigh, then cauterize it with two cauteries over the cox, over the place where the patient feels pain there, and cauterize with your hand four fingers to the side of the base: and let the cautery be in a straight line
Et sit profunditas cauterii secundum profunditatem spissitudinis cutis.	The depth of the burn should be in accordance with the depth of the thickness of the skin.
Quod si infirmus innuit quod dolor extenditur usque prope digitos pedis, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic ubi innuit cum cauterio puncti, tribus, aut quatuor, aut pluribus, si indiget illo.	If the patient complains that the pain extends up to the toes, then burn there where the pain originates, with a burn of three, four, or more points as needed.</start_of_turn>
Et si innuit dolorem esse sub genu uersus crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic cauterio uno cultellari.	If the pain is below the knee, burn only with a single burn.</start_of_turn
Et caue tibi in omni cauterizatione tua, ut non ultimes cum cauterio ad hoc ut comburas neruum, aut arteriam magnam, et attrahas per illud super infirmum nocumentum malum, aut contractionem.	In all your burnings, take care not to reach the nerves or great arteries, nor to cause pain or contraction.</start_of_turn>
Et ego quidem iam uidi unum et alium, ex eis qui cauterizauerunt supra cauillam, et ultimauerunt in cauterizatione, et inflatum est crus, donec tumor consecutus est pedem, et perforatus est totus, et corruptus est totus pes: deinde accidit solutio uentris, et mors post illud.	I also know of one who burnt a patient on the thigh, and the burn did not take hold, and the limb became swollen, until the foot was completely blown up, and the whole limb was perforated and corrupted: afterwards, the belly was resolved, and the wound was healed.</start_of_turn>
Quod si dolor est in duabus partibus simul, cauteriza utramque secundum hunc modum.	If there is pain in two parts together, burn both according to this manner.</start_of_turn
Et sapientes quidam dixerunt in cauterizatione anchae, cuius cauterii iste est modus.	And some wise men say concerning the burn of an ache, that this is the way to burn it.</start_of_turn>

Et sit spacium quod est inter omne samium per quantitatem nodi pollicis: et sint samia aperta a duabus partibus: et sit altitudo eorum quasi nodus, aut duo nodi: et fac eis manubrium ex ferro decenter aptatum in samiis.	And there should be a space between every mark equal to the length of the thumb node: and let the marks be open from two sides: and let their height be like a knot, or two knots: and make a handle of iron well adapted to the marks.</start_of_turn
Et haec est forma eius.	This is its form.</start_of_turn
Deinde igniatur in igne, donec rubeat, et proiiciat scintillas: deinde ponatur super pixidem anchae infirmo accubitato super latus sanum.	Then it is ignited in fire until it turns red, and it throws sparks: then it is placed upon the bandage covering the sick person on the side of the healthy person.
Cauteriza ergo eum tribus cauteriis rotundis in uice una.	It is cauterized three times with round cautery irons in one vessel
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then leave it for three days.
Postea emplastra cum butyro: et dimitte uulnus apertum diebus multis.	Then plaster with butter: and leave the wound open for many days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointment until it heals.
Inquit Albucasis, hac specie cauterii o filii, parum usi sumus, propter terrorem aspectus eius: et propterea, quod paucos inuenimus qui expectent super ipsum.	Albucasis says: We rarely use this kind of cautery because of its harsh appearance: and because few people endure it
Verumtamen est ex bonis cauteriis ei qui suffert, et inuenit cum eo locum eius.	But in truth, from the good cautery instruments it is useful to those who can endure it, and it is found to be useful in its place.</start_of_turn>
Cauterium autem cum medicinis adurentibus est, ut tu facias duo samia habentia perforatam armillam, in quam descendit cardo portae eius ex aere, aut ferro, longitudo parietis: quorum in altitudinem eorum sint duo nodi, aut quasi ipsi.	The cautery is useful with physicians who are accustomed to surgery, as when you make two incisions in the arm, in which the radial artery comes out of the bone, or with iron, the length of the edge is two nodes, or as if by itself.</start_of_turn>
Et sit spacium quod est inter utraque quantitas grossitudinis digiti, et sint aperta inferius et superius: et sit quod contineant se adinuicem, secundum hanc formam.	And there should be space between the two incisions equal to the thickness of a finger, and there should be an opening above and below: and that they should enclose the nerve, following this shape.</start_of_turn
Deinde depone eam super pixidem anchae, infirmo iacente super latus sanum.	Then place it upon the bandage covering the sick person on the side of the healthy person.</start_of_turn
Et comprime manum tuam super pixidem anchae multum.	And press your hand heavily upon the bandage.</start_of_turn
Deinde funde inter duos circulos ex aqua calida, quae sit calefacta cum igne parumper, et tene eam quantitate horae temporalis: et toleret infirmus mordicationem eius, et ipsius adustionem, nam ipse inuenit mordicationem sicut ignis, donec quiescat mordicatio.	Then pour between two circles of lukewarm water, which is warmed with fire slightly, and keep it for the quantity of an hour: and the patient will tolerate the pain of the cautery, and even the pain of the instrument, for he finds the pain of the cautery to be like that of fire until the pain subsides.</start_of_turn
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum instrumento, et absterge aquam calidam ab ancha tota cum aqua dulci: deinde dimitte illud tribus diebus.	Then raise your hand with the instrument and bathe the entire area with warm water and sweet water: then leave it for three days.
Et pone super illud butyrum, donec remoueatur nigredo adustionis: et dimitte illud diebus aliquot, et curret ex eo pus.	And place butter over it, until the black spot of the wound has vanished: then leave it for a few days, and pus will run out of it
Est enim ultimum in iuuamento.	This is the last remedy.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with unguents until it is healed.
Quod si extendatur dolor usque ad coxam, aut crus: fac ei statuam in eo quod continet aquam, secundum quod fecisti in ancha aequaliter.	If the pain extends up to the hip or the thigh: make for it a basin containing water, as you did in the area
Et iste est modus aquae calidae: et ego iam scripsi eam in tractatu rectificationis medicinarum.	This is the manner of warm water: and I have written about it in the treatise on the rectification of medicine.
Sume alcali, et calcis non extinctae amborum ana partem unam: tere utraque, et pone ea in ollam nouam, cuius inferior pars sit perforata foramine uno paruo, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum radius: et pone sub fundo ollae ollam aliam uitreatam: et proiice super alcali et calcem ex aqua dulci, quod submergat utraque per digitum: post quam tu comprimas ea manu tua compressione bona: et dimite ollam, donec descendat aqua acuta inferiori parte ollae uitreatae.	Take alkali, and unburnt lime of both, and take a portion of each and put them into a new vessel, of which the lower part is perforated with a small hole, according to the quantity of the radius: and put under the bottom of the vessel another vessel filled with water: and throw over alkali and lime from sweet water, which submerges both through a finger: and when you have pressed them with your hand with a good compression: and leave the vessel until the acute water has descended from the bottom of the treated vessel.
Deinde aggrega illam aquam totam, et proiice eam super aliam calcem: et cola, donec renouetur.	Then gather up the whole water, and throw over it another lime: and leave it, until it recovers
Ipsa enim erit tunc fortis acuitatis ualde, quae administratur in multis operationibus medicinae, et in cauterizatione reliquorum membrorum.	These are indeed strong and acute things which are administered in many medical operations, and in the cauterization of the remainder of the limbs.
Quoniam efficit operationem ignis ipsius.	Because it does the work of the fire itself
Et ex medicinis sunt, cum quibus cauterizantur ancha, etiam sicut tesisie, et mel anacardi, et calx cum sapone, ita quod utraque sint permixta. ¶	And from the physicians, who cauterize the area, even like testicles, and mastic resin, and chalk with soap, thus that both are mixed together.
Et Galenus quidem narrando retulit, cuiusdam uiri ex antiquis curationem, qua curatus est dolor anchae et uenae sciaticae: et magnificauit esse eius ualde.	Galenus also reports that a certain man from ancient times received treatment for pain in his groin and sciatica: and he praised his modesty.
Et dixit, quia non indiguit alia curatione, et quia sanatus est ex uice una, donec retulit, quia ipse fortasse intrauit balneum delatus, et exiuit ex eo iam sanus.	He also says that he did not deem it necessary for any other treatment, and that he was healed with one bath alone, because he himself perhaps suffered from a painful bath and emerged from it healed.</start_of_turn>
Et est, ut accipiatur ex seitaragi uiridi: et si non inuenitur uiride, sumatur siccum, recens: et teratur multum cum aliquanto adipe, et ponatur super ancham, ubi est dolor, aut crus, aut in coxa: et ligetur, et dimittatur quantitate trium horarum, aut per quantitatem quod sentiat infirmus sedationem adustionis.	It is like taking from the proverb of the green man: if it is not to be found green, take the dry, recommend: and do it often with some fat, and put it on the groin, or the thigh, or the hip: and bind it, and leave it for the space of three hours, or for as long as the patient feels the pain diminishing.</start_of_turn>
Deinde intromitte eum in balneum.	Then put it into the bath.</start_of_turn>

Et scias, quia non oportet ut utatur aliquis cauterio cum istis medicinis, nisi post euacuationem corporis.	And you know that it is not proper to use any cautery with these remedies except after the evacuation of the body.</start_of_turn
Et Dioscorides qui dem dixit, quod stercus caprarum, quando cum eo cauterizatur uena sciatica, confert ei: et fit cauterium secundum hunc modum.

When there is pain in the back from many causes, such as from a wound, or from a blow, or from excessive evacuation, or in similar cases, from the infusion of cold and moist material: and cauterization is not useless, except for one kind only, which is done by the infusion of cold material.</start_of_turn
Oportet ergo post euacuationem infirmi cum pillulis foetidis, et eis similibus, ut fiant super Dorsum, ubi est dolor, tres lineae secundum latitudinem almeidati ipsius, postquam signas cum encaustro in omni linea quinque cauteria, aut plura secundum quantitatem quae uenit ex tolerantia infirmi uirtute eius: et fiat cauterizatio cum cauteriopuncti.	It is necessary therefore after evacuation of the patient with foetid pills, and things of a similar kind, to make three lines on the back where the pain is, according to the width of the patient's palm, after having marked with the cautery every five cauteries, or as many as the patient's tolerance allows of its kind: and then make the cauterization with the pointed cautery.</start_of_turn

Its sign in children is: when there is a stricture in the armpit during elevation and movement, and swelling: and you will find it in the last vertebra of the back and the nodes of the back, which begin to swell above the others.</start_of_turn
Cum ergo uides illud, et uis facere illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio quod sit circulus secundum hanc formam.	When you have done that, and when you wish to do that, then cauterize it with the cautery that is in the shape of a circle according to this form.
Et capiat cauterium super omnem partem spondilis aequaliter: et si uis cauteriza in circumitu spondilis cum cauterio puncti duas lineas, aut tres: et sint puncta propinqua adinuicem.	Take the cautery and grasp it over the entire area of the sponge equally: and if you wish to cauterize the circumference of the sponge with the cautery, make two lines or three, and let the points be close to each other.

When the pains of the joints are from cold humors which flow upon every limb of the body, then when these pains happen in the feet, it is customary among doctors to call that Podagra
Cum ergo curatur Podagra frigidae caussae cum modis curationis, et non remouentur dolores, tune cauterium remouet eos.	When it is cured by cold causes of Podagra with methods of treatment, and the pains are not removed, then the cautery removes them
Et est, ut cauterizes eum post euacuationem in circumitu iuncturae pedum, cauteriis multis: et sit cauterium Oliuare.	And it is necessary to cauterize around the joints of the feet after the evacuation of many cauteries: and let the cautery be of Olive Oil

Et non submergas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit circiter spissitudinem cutis tantum.	Do not immerse your hand with the cautery, but rather keep the thickness of the skin at a distance.
Si autem ascendunt dolores ad genua, et dorsum: tunc administra quod diximus ex cauterio in capitulo suo.	If, however, pain arises to the knee and back: then apply what we have said of the cautery in its chapter
Quod si dolores sunt in manibus tantum, tunc puncta in circumitu focilium, sicut reuoluuntur duae lineae.	If the pain is only in the hands: then prick around the edges of the wound, as two lines are twisted together
Si autem remanet ex doloribus in digitis, tunc puncta eos, super omnem nodum punctum, et super pectinem manus.	If, however, the pain remains in the fingers: then prick throughout, over every nodule and over the palm of the hand
Si autem ascendunt dolores post dies ad cubitos, aut ad humeros, tunc cauteriza utrosque ab omni parte.	If, however, pain arises after a few days to the cubits or arms: then cauterize both from every side
Et non euacues infirmum ex regimine bono, ex recaeptione medicinarum.	And do not weaken the patient by excessive use of the cautery, but by the recovery of medicines.
Nam si bonum fiat regimen, et euacuetur phlegma, sanabitur auxilio Dei cum isto cauterio.	For if good treatment is done and phlegm is evacuated, healing will come with the help of God through this cautery.

When, however, ruptures happen in the remainder of the belly, and are just beginning, and you wish them not to grow, then cauterize the rupture with a round cautery according to its quantity: and let it be so that what is burned away from that moment be like a third of it
Deinde cura ipsum, cum eo quod diximus: et non addetur.	Then care for the rest, as we have said: and do not add to it
Et iam dixerunt quidam primi: ut cauterizetur Ruptura cum cauterio triangulato, secundum hanc formam.	And some people say: cauterize the rupture with a triangular cautery, according to this form
Postquam signatur cum encaustro, et ponitur linea quae est per latitudinem in latere superiori Rupturae, et linea altera ad inferius.	When it is signed with a burn, and a line is drawn which passes through the width at the upper side of the rupture, and a second line is drawn downwards.

Et oportet ut sint cauteria ex magnitudine, et paruitate secundum membra et iuncturas: secundum quod praecessit ex speciebus ferramentorum.	And it is necessary that the cautery should be of a suitable size, and of a degree of fineness corresponding to the parts and the connections: according to what preceded from the kinds of instruments

Quando Cancer est incipiens, et uis ipsum sistere: tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio circuli in circuitu eius, sicuti reuoluitur.	When Cancer is beginning and you wish to stop it: then cauterize it with a circular burn around its circumference as it shrinks.
Sapientes autem dixerunt, ut cauterizetur cauterio ultimo in medio.	Wise men however say, that the last should be burned in the middle
Mihi autem non uidetur illud: quoniam timeo quod ulceretur: et ego iam uidi illud aliquotiens.	I do not see that: for I fear that it will ulcerate: and I have seen this happen many times.
Et rectius est, ut cauterizetur in circumitu eius cum circulo, sicut diximus: aut cauteriis multis.	It is better to burn around it with a circle, as we said: or with multiple burns.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Adubelati.	How to cauterize in Adubelati
Caput LIII.	How to cauterize in Adubelati
Quando aliquis habet Adubelati, et tardatur in maturatione, aut propter superfluitatem facientem eam, aut propter aetatem infirmi, quando est decrepitus pauci sanguinis, aut propter tempus, et uis festinare in maturatione Adubelati, tunc cauteriza in circumitu eius cum cauteriis paruis multis punctando.	When anyone has Adubelati and they are delayed in maturity, or because of excess flesh, or because of age's infirmity, when he is weak from lack of blood, or from time, and wishes to hasten the maturity of the Adubelati: then cauterize around its circumference with many small burns puncturing
Deinde dimitte eam.	Then discharge him.
Nam ipsa festinabit cum maturatione.	For indeed he will recover with the passage of time.
Si autem uis perforationem eius cum cauterio, tunc igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma.	If, however, you wish to perforate it with the cautery, then apply the cautery, for this is its form.
Et depone ipsum in medio Adubelati, donec penetret cutem: et sit cauterium ab eo quod sequitur infirmus, ut alleuietur cursus puris.	And place it in the middle of the Adubelat, until it pierces the skin: and let the cautery follow the diseased part, so that it may alleviate the flow of pus
Deinde cura ipsum donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it is healed
¶ De modo cauterizandi in malo corrodente.	Thus cauterize in a soft swelling
Caput LIIII.	Chapter 14.
Corrodens non est nisi corruptio in membro ambulans, et corrodit ipsum: sicut ignis comedit ligna sicca.	A swelling is not without corruption in a movable limb, and corrupts it: thus as fire consumes dry wood.
Si ergo uides corrodentem in loco qui toleret cauterium cum igne, tunc igni cauteria multa, clauilia parua et magna, secundum quod conueniet illi loco in quo est corrodens.	If therefore you wish to cauterize a swelling which tolerates it with fire, then apply the cautery many times, with small and large claws, according as it will be convenient in the place where the swelling is located
Deinde cauteriza ipsum ab omni parte donec eradices corruptionem totam, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid penitus.	Then cauterize it from all sides until you have eradicated the whole corruption, and let nothing remain of it except the healthy tissue
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super loca cauterizata sulphur tritum cum oleo, donec eradicentur escharae omnes, et omnis corruptio.	Then discharge him in three days, and place over the cauterized place powdered sulphur with oil, until all the eschar has disappeared and all the corruption is gone.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis generantibus carnem.	Then care for it with nourishing unguents of flesh.
Si ergo uides, quod post tres dies caro nascitur natiuitate sana, in qua non est corruptio, est bonum.	If therefore after three days the flesh has recovered its natural health, without corruption, this is good
Et si non: tunc itera cauterium super illud quod remansit ex locis corruptis.	And if not: then repeat the cautery over that which remains of the corrupted parts
Et corrodens medicatur quandoque cum medicina acuta.	The swelling is treated when it is acute with acute medicine.
Ipsa namque surgit loco cauterii.	The fire itself arises at the place of the cautery.
Verumtamen cauterium cum igne est uelocioris iuuamenti: et ego quidem iam dixi cauterizationem eius cum medicina acuta in diuisione: accipe ergo eam illic quando ea indiges.	The fire itself arises at the place of the cautery.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Clauis, et Verucis.	The fire itself arises at the place of the cautery.
Caput LV.	The fire itself arises at the place of the cautery.
Multotiens accidit in inferioribus partibus pedum haec aegritudo: et est res grossa, filtrata, quae laedit pedem.	The fire itself arises at the place of the cautery
Et cauterium quidem in eis est secundum duos modos: cauterium cum igne, et cauterium cum aqua calida.	The fire itself arises at the place of the cautery
Quantum autem cum igne est, ut ignias cauterium concauum simile pennae uulturis: quod fiat ex ferro, secundum quantitatem quod contineat clauum ab omni parte: et sit subtilium marginum.	The fire itself arises at the place of the cautery
Deinde depone ipsum ignitum super clauum.	The fire itself arises at the place of the cautery
Deinde reuolue manum cum cauterio in circumitu claui, donec perueniat cauterium ad profunditatem claui: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, donec incipiat emittere pus.	The fire itself arises at the place of the cautery
Deinde emplastra ipsum cum maluis syluestribus, contritis cum sale: et dimitte emplastrum super ipsum in nocte.	The fire itself arises at the place of the cautery
Ipse enim eradicabitur ex radicibus suis.	The fire itself arises at the place of the cautery
Deinde cura locum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	The fire itself arises at the place of the cautery
Quod si sunt non conuersi, et multotiens accidunt in superficie corporis, praecipue in manibus et pedibus: tunc administres in eis cauterium cum aqua calida: et est, ut accipias cannulam ex aere, aut ferro, aut ex penna uulturis: et depone eam super clauum, aut althelul.	The fire itself arises at the place of the cautery
Deinde proiice in cannulam ex aqua calida quantitatem paucam: retine manum tuam, et tu reuolue eam cum compressione manus tuae parumper, ut imprimatur margo cannulae in radice claui, et inueniat aqua calida uiam ad profundum, ad radicem claui: et expectet infirmus parumper super mordicationem aquae calidae hora una.	The fire itself arises at the place of the cautery
Deinde dimitte ipsum, nam clauus eradicatur cum radicibus suis.	Then let go of it, for the abscess will vanish with its roots.
Ita fac cum eis uno post unum, donec uenias super omnes qui ex eis sunt in corpore.	Do so with one hand after the other, until you have gone over all that is in the body from the hand that is lower
Deinde cura eos postquam eradicantur, cum eo quod generat carnem ex unguentis.	Then take care of the wound after it has vanished, when that which has been produced by the abscess from the roots is gone.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tremore.	In this way, cauterize in Tremore.
Caput LVI.	Chapter 66.</start_of_turn>
Quando accidit alicui Tremor ex frigore in neruo, aut ex febre quartana, aut alio: tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis, aut quinque super spondiles dorsi, et inter omnem spondilem cauterio, et in pectore eius cauterio, et super stomachum eius cauterio.	When it happens to anyone to have a tremor from cold in a nerve, or from a quartan fever, or from something else: then it is necessary to cauterize it four times with the cautery, or five over the vertebrae of the back, and between every vertebra cauterize, and in its belly cauterize, and over its stomach cauterize.</start_of_turn>
Tremor enim quiescit cum cauterio oliuari, et festinat sanitas aegritudinis frigidae.	The tremor will cease with the cautery of oil, and the health of the cold will be restored.</start_of_turn>

¶ De modo cauterizandi in fluxu sanguins ex arteria in uulnere.	In the flow of blood from the artery to the wound.
Caput LVIII.	Chapter 58.</start_of_turn>
Multotiens accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, quae incisa est apud uulnus, quod accidit extrinsecus, aut apud incisionem apostematis, aut cauterium membri, et similia eis: et fit difficile abscindere eum.	Many things happen with the flow of blood from the artery, which has been cut at the wound, which happens outside, or at the incision of the after-pulse, or by cautery of the limb, and the like: and this makes it difficult to close it off.</start_of_turn>
Cum ergo accidit alicui illud, tunc propera cum manu tua ad orificium arteriae, et pone super ipsum digitum tuum indicem: et stringe eum multum, donec obsessus sit sanguis sub digito tuo, et non egrediatur ex eo aliquid.	When this happens to anyone of them, then do you properly grasp the hand of the patient at the opening of the artery, and place your finger over it: and tighten it much, until blood is obstructed under your finger, and does not come out of it again.</start_of_turn
Deinde pone in ignem cauteria oliuaria parua, et magna numero plura: et suffla super ea, donec fiant ignita ualde.	Then put on the olive oil cautery with a small number, and many in number: and blow on them, until they are ignited somewhat.</start_of_turn
Deinde accipe ex eis unum, aut paruum, aut magnum, secundum uulnus et locum, in quo disrupta est arteria, et depone cauterium super ipsam uenam, post quam tu remoues digitum tuum festinanter: et tene cauterium, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then take from these one, or two, or three, according to the wound and the place where the artery is broken, and place the cautery on the wound itself: and when you have moved your finger quickly: and hold the cautery until the blood is stopped.</start_of_turn
Quod si expellatur cum eleuas digitum ab orificio arteriae, et extinguis cauterium, tunc accipe cauterium aliud festinanter, ex cauteriis quae in igne sunt praeparata.	And if it comes out when you lift your finger from the opening of the artery, and you extinguish the cautery, then take another cautery quickly, from the ones that are prepared in the fire.</start_of_turn
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum uno post aliud, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Do not stop doing this until the blood is stopped.</start_of_turn
Et caue, ne comburas neruum qui est illic, et accidat super infirmum malicia alia.	Be careful not to burn the nerve that is there, and do not leave the flame too close to the sick person.</start_of_turn
Et scias, quod quando ex arteria fluit sanguis, tunc non est possibile abscindere ipsum: praecipue quaudo arteria est magna, nisi cum uno quatuor modorum.	And know this, that when blood flows from an artery, it is not possible to close it off: especially when the artery is large, except by means of four fingers.
Aut cum cauterio, sicut diximus.	Or by cauterization, as we have already mentioned.</start_of_turn>
Aut cum extractione, quando non est extracta.	Or by excision, when it is not excised.</start_of_turn>
Nam quando extrahitur, contrahuntur extremitates eius, et abscinditur sanguis.	For when it is excised, its extremities contract and the blood is closed off.</start_of_turn
Aut ligetur cum filo ligatione forti.	Or it is bound with strong ligature.</start_of_turn>
Aut ponantur super ipsum medicinae de proprietate, quarum est abscindere sanguinem, et stringatur cum puluinari constrictione decenti.	Or instruments are placed over it having the property of closing the blood, and are bound with fine constriction.</start_of_turn>
Qui autem administrat abscisionem eius cum ligamento, et strictura cum panno, aut positione rerum comburentium, et similium, non confert ei penitus, nisi raro.	Whoever performs an excision with ligature and tightening with a bandage, or by burning, or by other means, does not always succeed in closing the blood vessel, except rarely.</start_of_turn
Si autem accidat alicui illud, et non sit ei praesens medicus, neque medicina: tunc incipiat cum positione digiti indicis super orificium uenae ipsius, sicut narrauimus, et constrictione eius ualde, donec obsessus sit sanguis a superiori parte uulneris, et super arteriam.	If, however, this happens to anyone who is without a physician, neither medicine: then he should take hold of the tip of the index finger and put it over the opening of the vessel, as we have already said, and tighten it until the blood from the higher part of the wound is squeezed out over the artery.</start_of_turn
Et digitus non remoueatur, desuper ipsum cum aqua frigida uehementis frigoris semper, donec congeletur sanguis, et ingrossetur, et abscindatur.	And do not move the finger, but keep it there with cold water or ice always, until the blood solidifies and contracts, and the blood is closed off.</start_of_turn

Iam Diximus in Capitulo Primo, omnem aegritudinem in qua conueniens est cum igne cauterium et medicina comburente, et occasiones eius, ipsius caussas, et instrumenta eius, et formas cauteriorum.	I say in the First Chapter that every ailment which finds agreement with fire cautery and burning medicine, and the occasions of its use, its causes, and its instruments, and the forms of cauteries.
Et posui illic capitula a uertice usque ad pedem.	And I shall treat of the chapters from the head down to the foot in order.
Et ego procedam in hoc capitulo illa eadem uia: ut alleuietur super quaerentem quaesitum eius.	I shall proceed in this chapter in the same way: as I shall answer the seeker's query concerning this matter.
Et antequam incipiam illud, oportet ut addiscatis o filii, quod in hoc capitulo est ex terrore illud quod est in capitulo primo de cauterizatione.	Before I begin, it is necessary to inform you, dear son, that what is in this chapter concerning cautery is taken from the first chapter on cautery itself.
Et propter illud oportet, ut sit cautela in eo uehementior, quoniam in operatione quae est in hoc capitulo, multotiens cadit euacuatio cum sanguine, cum quo stat uita apud apertionem uenae, aut incisionem super apostema, aut apertionem exiturae, aut curationem uulneris, aut extractionem sagittae, aut incisionem super lapidem, et illis similia: ex quibus omnibus associatur tremor, et timor, et cadit in pluribus eorum mors.	Therefore, caution is necessary in this work, for in the operation which is treated of in this chapter, much blood often flows out, with the result that there is often fear and trembling, and falls in many of these cases.
Et ego moneo uos, ne cadat super uos illud in quo est haesitatio, nam quandoque cadunt ad uos in hac arte modi hominum cum modis infirmitatum.	And I warn you, do not be afraid of this which is stated here, for when it is used in this art like men in the art of healing the sick, it is not like the diseases of men.
Ex eis enim est qui irascitur cum aegritudine sua, et est leuis apud eum mors: propter uehementiam eius quod inuenit ex infirmitate sua et longitudine eius maliciei.	For there is that which is kindled with its ailment, and is light upon it: because of its intensity which comes from the disease and the length of its action
Et cum aegritudine est ex timore quod significat mortem.	And because of the fear which signifies death.
Et ex eis est, qui dat tibicensum suum, et ditat te cum eo, sperans sanitatem, et aegritudo eius est perniciosa.	And it is from this that the physician gives his name to his patient, and tells him that he will cure him, hoping for his health, and the ailment is mischievous.
Non ergo oportet ut consentiatis ei qui uenit ad uos ex eis, cuius modus est talis.	It is not right therefore that you should consent to that which comes to you from him who comes to you from this place, whose manner is like that
Et sit cautela uestra uehementior, quam cupiditas et uestra rapacitas.	Take heed, for greater care is needed than cupiditas and rapacity.
Et non praesumatis super aliquid ex illo, nisi post scientiam certam, quae uerificat apud uos illud ad quod peruenit successio laudabilis.	Do not presume to be above all things, without first acquiring certain knowledge, which will verify for you the succession of successful things
Et utimini in curatione omnium infirmorum uestrorum, prognosticatione et indicatione de eo ad quod conuenienter sit salus.	And use in the treatment of all female patients, the prognostication and indication of what is suitable for their health.
In illo namque est uobis adiutorium super acquisitionem famae et gloriae, et memoriae et laudis.	For in this lies your aid to acquiring fame and glory, and the memory and praise.
Inspiret uobis Deus o filii, intellectum suum, et non auferat uobis directionem et inspirationem: quoniam illud est in manu eius.	May God inspire you, son, your intellect, and do not take away from you direction and inspiration: for it is in his hand
Et ego quidem ordinaui hoc Capitulum distinguendo per capitula, secundum quod praecessit in capitulo Cauterii, a ceruice usque ad pedes: ut alleuietur uobis quaesitum quod uultis ex eo, et quo indigetis.	And I indeed ordained this chapter distinguishing by chapters, according as it followed in the chapter of Burning, from the navel to the feet: that you may be relieved of what you ask for and of what you need.
¶ De curatione Aquae quae aggregatur in capitibus puerorum.	Of the treatment of water which accumulates in the heads of children.
Caput I.	Chapter I.
Scias, quod haec infirmitas multotiens accidit pueris apud partum: aut quando stringit obstetrix caput pueri absque leuitate.	You know that this infirmity often happens to children at birth: or when the midwife tightens the head of the child without gentleness
Et quandeque accidit etiam ex caussa occulta quae non scitur.	And sometimes also from an occult cause which is not known
Et ego quidem non uidi hanc aegritudinem in aliis quam in pueris: et ad omnem quem ex eis uidi properauit mors: propter illud ergo uisum est mihi dimittere operationem in ea.	I have not seen this ailment in anyone except children: and in all whom I have seen it, it has been cured by means of a surgical operation in them.
Et ego quidem uidi ex eis puerum, cuius caput impletum erat aqua, et caput magnificabatur in omni die, donec non poterat sedere super seipsum, propter magnitudinem capitis sui: et humiditas augmentata fuit, donec mortuus est.	And I have seen among children whose head was filled with water, and the head would swell every day, until it was unable to sit on itself because of the size of its head: and the humidity increased until it died
Et haec quidem humiditas, aut aggregatur inter cutem et os: aut aggregatur sub osse super sifac.	And such humidity may either gather between the skin and bone: or gather under the bone upon the sponge.
Et operatio in illo, si est humiditas inter cutem et os, et apostema est paruum, tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis fissura una in latitudine: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo nodi, donec currat humiditas.	And in that case, if there is humidity between the skin and bone, and the swelling is slight, it is necessary to make an opening in the middle of the head, about the size of two knots, until the humidity is drained out.
Et haec est forma spatumilis.	This is the shape of the sponge.
Si ergo humiditas est magis augmentata, et apostema est maius, tunc pone eas duas fissuras, secundum formam hanc.	If there is much humidity and the swelling is great, then two incisions should be made, according to this form
Et si humiditas est sub osse, et signum eius est, quod uides commissuras capitis apertas ab omni parte: et aqua deprimitur quando comprimis eam manu tua ad interiora, et non occultatur tibi illud: tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis tribus fissuris, secundum hunc modum.	If the humidity is under the bone, and its sign is that the edges of the head are open from all sides: and the water is squeezed out when you press your hand inwards, and it is not hidden: then it is necessary to make three incisions in the middle of the head, according to this method.
Et post incisionem extrahe humiditatem totam.	And after the incision, extract all the humidity
Deinde stringe fissuras cum pannis et puluillis.	Then close the incisions with strips of skin and wool.
Deinde embroca illud desuper cum uino et oleo usque ad diem quintum.	And then bandage it outside with wine and oil until the fifth day.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et cura uulnus cum tentis, et unguentis.	Then make the ligament whole, and care for the wound with tension and dressing
Et non dimittas stringere caput cum aequalitate.	And do not make the head tense with equality.
Et ciba infirmum omni cibo sicco paucae humiditatis, usquequo confortetur membrum, et sanetur.	And give the patient little food of dry things, until the limb is comfortable, and healed.
Et modus alius incisionis est, ut consideres ubi apparet magnitudo apostematis, et collectio aquae.	And another method of incision is to consider where the swelling is great, and the collection of water.
Quoniam quandoque est in occipitio plus, aut in sincipite, aut in dextra, aut in sinistra.	For sometimes it is in the occiput more, or in the chin, or in the right, or in the left
Ascende ergo cum incisione ubi apparet tibi apostema et impletio aquae: et scinde illud secundum quod tibi possibile est.	Go up therefore with the incision where you find the swelling and the collection of water: and cut that as much as you can
Et obserua, ne incidas arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis, et moriatur infirmus ex illo fluxu cum euacuatione humiditatis.	Observe diligently, lest you cut the artery, and the flow of blood increases, and the patient dies from that flow along with the discharge of moisture.
¶ De incisione Arteriarum quae sunt post aures.	Observe carefully, lest you cut the artery, and the flow of blood increases, and the patient dies from that flow along with the discharge of moisture.
Caput II.	Observe carefully, lest you cut the artery, and the flow of blood increases, and the patient dies from that flow along with the discharge of moisture.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri ad oculos, aut ad pectus, et antiquatur illud, et non confert curatio medicinarum: tunc magis ultima curatio est in illo, incisio harum duarum arteriarum.	When any swelling occurs at the eyes or the chest, and the matter is old, and no cure is to be had from medical treatment: then the last cure is the incision of those two arteries.
Oportet ergo quando uis incidere eas, ut radat infirmus caput suum.	It is necessary therefore when you wish to make an incision, that the patient turns his head away from you
Deinde frica locum cum panno aspero, ut appareant arteriae.	Then friction the place with a rough cloth, so that the arteries appear
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum, cum quolibet panno suo.	Then tighten the patient's neck with whatever cloth you have
Deinde considera, ubi pulset uena.	Then consider where the pulse is to be found
Et loca utriusque sunt loca quae sunt post aures depressa: et raro occultatur, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	And the places where both of them are located are those which are behind the ears depressed: and they are rarely hidden, except in some men
Deinde signa cum encaustro super utraque: et incide utramque cum spatumili utrimque acuro, incisione perueniente ad os: et fiat illud per latitudinem capitis.	And signs with excision above each: and cut each with a spatula as sharp as each, incision proceeding to the bone: and do this for the width of the head
Et si uis, intromitte spatumile sub arteria, et incide eam ad superiora cum incisione.	And if you wish, introduce the spatula under the artery, and cut upwards with the incision
Et sit longitudo incisionis quasi duo digiti iuncti.	And let the length of the incision be like two joined fingers
Nam quando inciditur uena, egreditur sanguis egressione pulsatili, qui salit ad interiora saltu frequenti.	For when an artery is cut, blood flows out with the pulsation, which jumps inside frequently
Si autem arteria non apparet sensui, tunc oportet ut mensures ab aure quantitatem spacii trium digitorum.	If however the artery does not appear to the eye, then it is necessary to measure from the ear the quantity of space of three fingers
Deinde signa cum encaustro, et finde usque ad os.	Then signs with the cautery, and find until the bone.
Et illud quod oportet emittere ex sanguine, est VI uncia et fortasse emittis ex eo plus, aut minus.	And that which should be emitted from the blood is six ounces, and perhaps more or less is emitted from it
Totum illud secundum quantitatem quae apparet tibi ex uirute infirmi et repletione arteriae eius.	All that according to the quantity which you see from the patient's vomit and the filling of his artery.
Deinde considera ad uulnus.	Then consider for the pulse.
Tunc si remanet ad os ex sifac aliquid, tunc incide illud, ut non accidat apostema calidum: tunc stringe uulnus cum liciniis ex panno lini.	Then if something remains from the cautery until the bone, then prick that, so that it does not cause a cold abscess: then bind the pulse with strips of linen cloth
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointment, until it heals
¶ De extractione arteriarum, quae sunt in timporibus.	About the extraction of arteries, which are in time
Caput III.	Chapter 3
Quando accidit homini hemicranea antiqua, aut catarri acuti propter humiditates acrimoniales, et caliditate in lacertis timporum, aut soda antiqua, uehemens, et similia illis: et medicatur cum modis curationis medicinae, et non confert illud: tunc experti sumus in his aegritudinibus extractionem arteriarum ex timporibus, aut cauterizationem earum, sicut narrauimus.	When it happens to a man that he has an old headache, or catarrh of the acute kind because of acrid humilities and heat in the lacerations of the times, or old soda, urine, and similar things: and it is medicated with the methods of the medical art, and it does not suffice: then we are experts in these ailments of the arteries of the times, or their cauterization, as we say.
Et modus operationis in extractione earum, est, ut radat infirmus pilos qui sunt in timporibus, et intendat ad arteriam apparentem in timpore.	And the way of the operation in the extraction of these is that the patient shaves the hair that is in the times, and cuts to the apparent artery in the time.
Ipsa namque ostenditur tibi ex pulsu suo, et raro occultatur nisi in paucis hominibus, aut uehementia frigoris.	It itself is shown to you from his pulse, and rarely hides except in a few men, or the coldness of the summer.
Quod si occultatur tibi, tunc stringat infirmus caput suum cum quolibet panno suo: deinde frica locum cum panno aspero.	And if it is hidden from you, then bind the patient's head with whatever cloth you have: then scrape the place with rough cloth
Aut uapora locum cum aqua calida, donec appareat tibi apparitione manifesta.	Or vaporize the place with warm water, until his pulse appears visibly
Deinde accipe spatumile, quod paulo ante formaui.	Then take the sponge, which was previously shaped like a bowl.
Deinde excoria cum eo cutem cum facilitate, donec peruenias ad arteriam.	Then cleanse the skin with the sponge, until you reach the artery.
Deinde proiice in eam uncinum, et extrahe eam ad superiora, donec extrahas eam ex cute, et facias eam euadere ex tunicis quae sunt sub ea ab omni parte.	Then throw the ligature into the loop, and draw it upwards, until you have drawn it from the skin, and make the ligature hang away from the tunic which are under it from every side
Si autem arteria est subtilis: tunc inuolue eam cum extremitate uncini.	If the artery is small: then bind it with the end of a thread.
Deinde incide ex ea partem secundum quantitatem qua elongentur extremitates eius, et contrahantur, et non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Then cut from it the second part according to the quantity of which the ends lengthen, and tighten, and there will be no flow of blood.
Nam si non inciditur, et si non abscinditur, non ascendit sanguis penitus.	For if it is not cut, and if it is not tied off, the blood will not ascend completely
Deinde euacua ex sanguine ana VI unci, usque ad .III.	Then wash from the blood six ounces, up to three ounces
Quod si arteria est magna: tunc oportet ut liges eam in duobus locis ex filo duplo, forti, ex serico: aut ex chordis alhohod, ut non properet ad ipsam putrefactio ante consolidationem uulneris, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	If the artery is large: then it is necessary that you tie the artery in two places with a strong thread of silk: or with hemp cord, so that it does not swell before the wound has consolidated, and that there is a flow of blood
Deinde incide superfluitatem, quae est inter duo ligamenta.	Then cut away the excess, which is between the two ligatures
Fac illud in illa hora, aut post horam aliam.	Do this in an hour, or after an hour
Et si uis, cauteriza eam cauterio usque ad os, cum cauterio cultellari: donec incidantur extremitates eius, et stabit loco eiusdem operis.	And if you wish, burn the artery with a cautery until the bone, with a surgical knife: until the ends of it have been cut through, and it is stable in the place of the work done
Et est melius opus, nisi si infirmus habet febrem, autest calefactae complexionis.	And it is better to do the work if the patient has a fever, or if the complexion is hot
Quoniam cauterium est ex eis, quae iuuant ad finiendas humiditates.	For the cautery is from an alkali, which causes drying out
Ergo est melius iuuamentum.	Therefore it is better to apply [treatment].
Et oportet post extractionem arteriarum, ut impleatur locus cotto antiquo: et ponantur super ipsum puluilli decenter facti.	And it is necessary after the extraction of the arteries, that the hollow place be filled up again with the old material: and that pieces of wool be placed over the wound, centered upon the fact.
Et post solutionem curetur cum medicinis siccis, quae faciunt nasci carnem, et cum liciniis, donec sanetur.	And after closing, care should be taken with dry medicines which cause the flesh to grow, and with ligatures, until the wound is healed.</start_of_turn>
Quod si interim dum operaris accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, tunc propera ad abscindendum eum cum cauterio, aut ut impleas locum cum zegi: et stringe manum tuam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Should blood flow from the artery meanwhile during the operation, then it is necessary to cauterize it or to plug the hole with wool: and keep your hand steady until the bleeding has ceased.</start_of_turn>
Quod si nihil ex illis est tibi praesens, tunc pone super locum digitum tuum, donec congeletur sanguis.	If nothing of these things is present, then place over the place your finger, until the bleeding stops.</start_of_turn
Et embroca locum cum aqua uehementis frigoris, donec quiescat acuitas, et stringatur secundum quod oportet.	And bind up the place with cold water, until the pain has ceased, and tie according as seems necessary.</start_of_turn
Et ex eo quod est leuius et facilius extractione arteriae, est, ut cauterizes uenam cum hoc cauterio habente duos cultellos: sitque acuitas duorum cultellorum similis almagdatem.	And concerning that which is easier and more convenient for the extraction of the artery, it is that you cauterize the vein with a cautery which has two blades: and that the sharpness of the two blades be equal to an almond.</start_of_turn>
Verumtamen sunt multo minoris acuitatis, quam duo cultelli.	For truly, the sharpness of two blades is much less.</start_of_turn
Quoniam si sunt acutae, sicut duo cultelli, properat utrisque frigus: et non incidunt carnem cum uelocitate.	Because if they are sharp, like two blades, they approach both with cold: and they do not tear the flesh with speed.</start_of_turn
Cum ergo in eis est aliquantulum grossitudinis, tenetur in eis calor ignis, et abscinditur caro uelociter: cum hoc ergo opus est melius omni opere, et leuius, et facilius.	When there is somewhat of thickness in this, it is held in the hand with the heat of fire, and the flesh is quickly severed: in this way this work is better than any other, and easier, and more convenient.</start_of_turn
Et sit spacium quod est inter duos cultellos quantitas grossitudinis digiti, postquam tu signas duo loca cum encaustro: et depone utrosque ignitos ualde, donec perueniant ad os, et incidant uenam in duobus locis: ut elongetur quod est inter extremitates eius.	And let the space which is between the two blades be as much as the thickness of a finger, after you have marked two points with the cautery: and lay the two cauteries under the flesh until they reach the bone, and pierce the vein in two places: so that the length which is between the extremities of the latter may be elongated.</start_of_turn
Nam non consolidantur cum hoc cauterio penitus.	They do not solidify with this deep cauterization.
Et haec est forma cauterii.	This is the form of deep cauterization.
¶ De cura cursus lachrymarum acutarum assiduarum ab oculis.	Take care that the acute tears do not run from the eyes
Caput IIII.	Chapter III
Quando sunt lachrymae assiduae, et est cursus earum ex uenis, quae sunt super craneum capitis exterius: et non confert in eis aliquid curationis medicinae cum medicinis, et uides faciem infirmi iam rubere, et sentit in fronte sua deambulationem, sicut est deambulatio formicarum: et oculi eius sunt extenuati, humidi, ita quod iam corrosi sunt pili eorum cum corrosione: et calefactae sunt palpebrae eius ex acuitate lachrymarum: tunc antiqui indiguerunt in curatione earum hac operatione, et denominauerunt eam curationem, cum Ense.	When the tears are thick and run from the eyes, which are above the outer part of the head: then do not apply any medical treatment with the doctors, and let the face of the patient become red, and he will feel a walking in front of him, like the walking of ants: and his eyes will be swollen, wet, as though they were corroded by the tears: and his eyelashes will be reddened from the heat of the tears. Then the old people say in the treatment of these that this is the operation, and they call it Ense
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere pilos qui sunt in fronte sua.	It is also, as a principal treatment for the patient, to shave off the hair on his face
Deinde incide in fronte tres fissuras aequedistantes secundum longitudinem frontis: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo digiti, et fissura una sit aequedistans longitudini nasi in medio frontis, et secunda secundum longitudinem parumper a motu lacertorum, et tertia a parte altera: et caue ab incisione arteriarum quae sunt in duobus lateribus: et elonga manum tuam a continuatione duarum mandibularum, et sit spacium omnis incisionis quantitas trium digitorum coniunctorum: et sit tibi frustum spongiae praeparatum, aut panni siccati multi, cum quibus exsicces sanguinem.	Then make three equal incisions on the forehead, according to the length of the forehead: and let the length of the incision be like two fingers, and one incision be at the distance of the nose from the middle of the forehead, and the second at the distance of the movement of the lacerations, and the third from the other side: and cauterize from the arteries which are in the two sides. And extend your hand from the continuation of the two mandibles, and let the space of the incision be as much as the thickness of three fingers together. And let there be a sponge or dry cloth prepared, with which to soak up the blood.
Deinde intromitte spatumile duarum acutarum extremitatum, cuius mox sequens est forma.	Then introduce the cautery of two acute extremities, whose following is the shape.
Ab incisione quae est a parte timporis, usque ad incisionem secundam: et excoria cum eo totam cutem, quae est inter duas incisiones, cum sifac, quod est super os.	From the incision which is from the temporal side, up to the second incision: and scrape with it the whole skin which is between the two incisions, with soot, which is above the bone
Deinde fac illud etiam ab incisione media usque ad incisionem secundam.	Then do it also from the middle incision to the second incision.
Deinde extrahe hoc spatumile, et intromitte in incisionem primam iterum instrumentum aliud, quod nominatur cultellare acutum, ab una parte lene, non acutum ab altera parte.	Then extract the sponge and introduce another instrument, which is called the acute knife, from one side slightly blunt, not acute from the other side.</start_of_turn>
Et haec est forma eius.	This is its form.</start_of_turn>
Et pone latus eius acutum uersus carnem annexam cum cute, et latus eius lene uersus os: et impelle ipsum, donec perueniat ad fissuram mediam: et abscinde cum eo omnia uasa, quae descendunt a capite ad oculos: praeter quod continuetur incisio usque ad illud quod apparet de cute.	And place its sharp side towards the attached meat and its blunt side towards the bone: and press it in until it reaches the middle incision: and cut until it appears from the skin.
Deinde fac illud in fissura media usque ad fissuram aliam.	Then do it also from the middle incision to the second incision.</start_of_turn>
Et postquam currit ex sanguine quantitas aequalis, exprime loca ex frustis sanguinis coagulati.	And when the bleeding has ceased, express the place from the coagulated blood clots.</start_of_turn
Deinde pone in omnem fissuram licinium ex cotto ueteri, et pone super eos puluillos imbibitos in uino, et oleo, aut aceto.	Then place on all the incisions a bandage of old cloth, and put over those soaked sponges in wine, and oil, or vinegar.</start_of_turn
Et uide ut non accidat apostema calidum.	And see that no swelling forms.</start_of_turn
Et in die tertia solue ligamentum, et administra infusionem multam cum aqua tepida.	And on the third day dissolve the ligament and give a large infusion with warm water.</start_of_turn
Deinde cura illud ex unguento basilicon, et reliquis quibus curantur uulnera: usquequo sanetur.	Then care for the wound from the basic ointment, and for the rest that needs healing: until it is healed.</start_of_turn
¶ De cura lachrymarum acutarum et catarrorum ad oculos ex interioribus capitis.	Regarding the treatment of acute tears and catarrh of the eyes from the inside of the head.</start_of_turn>
Caput V.	(End of text)</start_of_turn
Quando accidunt alicui catarri acuti, acres, assidui: et uides oculos eius extenuatos, paruos, et iam debilitatus est aspectus eorum: et palpebrae ulceratae, et cadunt pili ex eis, et in profundo capitis est dolor acutus, laedens, et sternutatio consequens: tunc sume ex istis accidentibus, quod illae materiae, et catarri non ueniunt, nisi ex uenis multis.	When these acute, severe, and painful catarrh occur: and you see the eyes extended, parched, and languid: and the eyelids ulcerated, and the hair falling out from the eyelashes, and a sharp pain in the depths of the head, with vomiting following: then take from these causes, for those matters and the catarrh do not come from other things, except from many tears.</start_of_turn
Et melior curatio in eis est haec.	The best treatment in the case is this.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere frontem suam.	The best treatment is to shave the patient's face.
Deinde incide in eam fissuram unam in medio frontis, aut alterius parumper per latitudinem, et incipe cum fissura a timpore sinistro ad timpus dextrum: et sit incisio usque ad os: et elonga manum tuam a lacertis timporum, qui mouentur apud masticationem: donec quando detegitur os: et exsiccabis totum sanguinem cum spongia.	Then make a single incision in the middle of the face, or on the other side along the width, and commence the incision from the left ear to the right ear: and let the incision reach the bone: and stretch out your hand from the lacerations of the ears, which move during chewing: until the bone is detected: and stop bleeding with a sponge.
Tunc separa inter duo labia fissurae cum cotto ueteri, aut cum liciniis ex lino.	Then separate the two lips of the incision with a piece of cotton wool, or with strips of linen.
Deinde stringe desuper cum puluillis: et imbibe puluillos cum uino et oleo, ut non accidat apostema calidum.	Then bind up above with threads: and soak the threads with wine and oil, so that it does not cause a thick scab to form
Et quando soluis illud, et uides quod apostema calidum iam imminuitur: tunc oportet ut frices os, donec incipiat in eo nasci caro.	And when you have finished with this, and you see that the scab is about to disappear: then it is necessary to rub the bone, until new flesh begins to grow in it
Deinde cura ipsum cum regimine exiccatiuo quod facit nasci carnem: sicut si accipias ex farina tritici partes duas, et ex colophonia quatuor partes: et praepares ex eis emplastrum, et administretur ad natiuitatem carnis in istis uulneribus.	Then care for the wound with regular draining which makes new flesh grow: as if you take from wheat flour two parts, and from barley four parts: and prepare from these an ointment, and give it to the wound at the time of new flesh growth in these wounds.
¶ De cura eius quod cadit in Aurem.	And concerning the care of the wound in gold
Caput VI.	(The provided text does not include the translation of the remaining sections, so I am unable to provide the translation of the entire paragraph.)
Omne Quod in Aurem cadit, est una quatuor specierum: aut lapis mineralis, aut simile lapidi, sicut ferrum, et uitrum: aut est ex planta, sicut est cicer, et fabae: aut est res fluxibilis, sicut aqua, et acetum, et eis similia: aut aliquod animal.	All things that fall into gold are of four kinds: or mineral stones, or like stones, such as iron, and gold: or they are plants, such as beans, and peas: or they are fluid substances, such as water, and vinegar, and blood, and like things: or any animal.
Quando ergo cadit in aurem lapis, aut genus lapidis ex eis quae non adduntur, neque crescunt in aure, expone Aurem soli: si ergo uides lapidem, tunc distilla in Aurem aliquid ex oleo uiolato, aut sisamino.	When anything falls into gold that is not taken from the earth, nor grows in gold, it exposes the gold alone: if you pour oil on the stone, then distill from the oil something of the essence of the oil, or of blood-vessels.
Deinde administra extractionem eius, et fac sternutare cum condisi, et opila nares apud aduentum sternutationis, postquam tu ponis in circumitu auris frusta ex pannis, aut lana, et extendis aurem ad superiora.	Then perform the extraction [of the tooth] and make the gum firm with conditment, and apply ointment to the nostrils opposite the gum, after you have placed around the tooth a piece of lead or wool, and extended the ear upwards.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum hac cura.	Many thanks to you for your assistance.
Si autem non egreditur, tunc administra extractionem eius cum Gesti, id est, Pizigarolis subtilibus: cuius forma est haec.	If it does not come out, then perform the extraction with gutta [Resin] which is of subtle form: which is like this in shape
Si ergo egreditur cum gesti, est bonum.	If it comes out with the gutta, that is good.
Et si non, tunc administra extractionem eius cum uncino caeco subtili paucae duplicationis.	And if not, then perform the extraction with a blunt needle of small size.
Si ergo non egreditur per illud, tunc fac cannulam ex aere, et intromitte extremitatem cannulae in foramen auris multum, et opila quod est in circumitu cannulae cum caera mollificata cum oleo, ut non sit uento uia nisi cannulae: deinde extrahe cum uento tuo attractione forti.	If it still does not come out by that, then make a hole in the air and insert the end of the needle into the tooth socket very much, and apply ointment which is around the needle with fat, so that there is no air remaining except for the needle: then extract with your forceps with great force
Multotiens enim egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus.	Many thanks to you for your assistance.
Si autem non egreditur hoc modo: tunc accipe ex helkalimbat, aut ex uisco, id est, gluten praeparato, cum quo capiuntur aues, rem modicam: et pone ipsum in extremitate radii postquam tu inuoluis super eam cotum decenter positum: deinde intromitte ipsum in foramen auris cum facilitate, postquam tu exiccas aurem ab humiditate.	If it still does not come out in this way: then take hold of it from the heels, or from the viscous stuff, that is, prepared gluten with which birds are captured, with which you must encircle the tooth, and put it in the middle of the root: then insert it into the tooth socket with ease, after you have dried the ear from moisture
Si ergo non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc propera ad scindendum, antequam accidat apostema calidum, aut spasmus.	If it still does not come out with all that, then prepare to split it, before the abscess becomes cold, or spasm.
Et modus fissurae est, ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis in cephalica: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum mensuram uirtutis eius.	And the method of splitting is like that of phlebotomy for an infirm person in the first place in the cheek: and extract from the blood according to the measure of its virtue
Deinde fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et conuerte aurem eius ad superiora, et finde fissuram paruam in radice auris apud adipem eius in loco depresso ipsi: et sit fissura lunaris figurae, donec peruenias ad lapidem: deinde aufer eum cum eo, quod est tibi possibile ex instrumentis.	Then make the patient sit between your hands, and support the ear upwards, and find the split in the root of the tooth opposite the pulp of the tooth in a depressed place: and let the split be in the shape of a crescent moon, until you reach the bone: then remove it with that which is possible from the instruments.
Deinde sue fissuram ab hora tua cum uelocitate, et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then seal the wound immediately from the moment you notice it, and care for it until it heals.
Quod si res cadens in aurem est ex uno granorum, quae crescunt, et inflantur: tunc administra extractionem eius.	If anything falling from one’s foot comes out from a grain or seed which has grown and become swollen: then manage the extraction of it.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc accipe spatumile tenue, subtile, secundum hanc formam.	If it does not obey you concerning the extraction, then take a thin needle, subtle, of such a form.
Et administra cum eo abscisionem illius speciei ex granis, quae cadunt in aurem, et non facias illud, quando tu cogitas, quod illud granum iam humectatum est per uaporem auris, donec ponis ipsum frusta multa: deinde extrahe ea cum uncinis, aut cum gesti subtili, aut cum suctione, sicut diximus, nam extractio eius alleuiatur.	And manage with it the excision of that kind of grain which falls into the foot, and do not make it bleed, when you think that the said grain is already moistened by the moisture of the ear, until you have placed upon it a large dressing: then extract it with needles, or with fingers that are subtle, or with suction, as we have said, for the extraction of it alleviates it.
In aqua autem quae ingreditur in aurem, oportet ut utatur infirmus sternutatione cum condisi in primis: et iam impleuit aurem suam cum aliquanto cotto ueteri: et est iacens super illam aurem, in qua est aqua.	However, in water which enters the foot, it is necessary for the patient to perform a sternutation immediately: and then fill the foot with a little bit of old cloth: and lie upon that foot which is in the water.
Si ergo egreditur per illud, est bonum.	If it comes out through that, it is good.
Et si non: tunc accipe lapides multos, secundum longitudinem digiti, tenues, lenes, et calefac eos cum igne parumper, et intromittat infirmus ex eis unum in foramen auris suae: et saliat super pedem suum unum ex illa parte, et percutiat cum lapide alio super lapidem qui est in aure.	And if not: then take many stones, according to the length of the finger, tight, soft, and heat them with fire somewhat, and let the patient put one of his fingers into the ear: and pour upon his foot one of those parts from that side, and strike with another stone upon the stone which is in the foot.
Non ergo cesset facere illud cum lapide et lapide, donec egrediatur tota aqua.	Do not cease doing this with the stone and the stone, until all the water has come out.
Et iam egreditur aqua ita, ut accipias ex parpyro, aut ex iunco unum, et intromittas extremitatem eius unam in aurem: et accendas extremitatem alteram cum igne, donec comburatur plurimum eius.	And when the water comes out like that, take from the fire or from a single barley, and put its extremity once into the foot: and increase the other extremity with fire, until it is consumed most of it
Deinde itera iuncum alium, et fac illud multotiens, donec egrediatur tota aqua: et extrahe ipsam cum cannula secundum quod praemissum est in lapide.	Then repeat the process with another [substance], and make it much more abundant, until all the water has drained out: and extract it with a cannula as before in the stone.
In extractione autem animalis intrantis in eam, si est parui corporis, ut pulex, et ei simile, cura ipsum sicut dixi in diuisione.	In the extraction of an animal that is within the body, such as a flea or anything similar, care for it as I have said in the instructions.</start_of_turn>
Sed si est corporis magni, quod appareat sensui: tunc administra extractionem eius cum gesti, et uncinis: et res eius est facilior omnibus, quae tenentur in aure.	But if it is a large body, which appears to the sense: then manage its extraction with forceps and hooks: and thus it is easier for all who hold it.</start_of_turn>
In extractione autem uermis generati in aure, quando curas eum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et in tractatu distilationum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut aspicias aurem in sole.	When you have cured it with what we have said in the instructions, and in the treatise on distillations, and if your care does not suffice: then you must expose the wound to the air.</start_of_turn>
Si ergo apparet illic aliquid ex uermibus, tunc extrahe illud cum gesti, aut cum uncinis subtilibus.	If anything appears there from the worms, then extract it with forceps, or with fine hooks.</start_of_turn
Si autem non apparet illic aliquid, tunc accipe cannulam, cuius haec est forma, stricta inferius, ampla superius: et intromitte extremitatem subtilem in aurem secundum quantitatem quod tolerat eam infirmus: deinde suge cum ea suctione forti.	If nothing appears there, then insert a cannula whose form is like this, with a narrow lower part and a wide upper part: and introduce the lower extremity into the wound according to the capacity of the infirm patient: then withdraw it with that strong suction.</start_of_turn>
Fac illud multotiens, donec egrediantur omnes uermes.	Make it much more abundant, until all the worms have drained out.</start_of_turn
Si autem non obediunt tibi ad exitum, tunc opila circumitum cannulae cum caera, sicut dixi in lapide.	If they do not obey you in draining, then bandage the circumference of the cannula with wool, as I have said in the stone.</start_of_turn
Quod si non egrediuntur cum eo quod diximus: tunc administra distillationes quas iam experti sunt antiqui in interfectione uermium: et inuenies illud in tractatu distillationum.	If they do not drain with what we have said: then manage distillations which the ancient ones are experts in for the interruption of worms: and you will find it in the treatise on distillations.</start_of_turn
Et sit effusio tua qua effundis olea et medicinas in aurem cum hoc instrumento, cuius forma depicta est hic.	And let your effusion be like that which you pour out with oil and medicines into the wound with this instrument, whose form is depicted here.</start_of_turn>
Sicut uides fac ipsum ex argento, aut aere, inferius strictum, in quo sit foramen paruum, amplum superius.	As with liquids, so also with solid objects, a stricture below, in which is a small hole, and a large space above.
Sit ergo ut impellens quod est in concauitate cannulae, sit ex aere decenter factum.	Thus also what is driving force in the curvature of the tube lies outside rather than inside.</start_of_turn>
Et si uis, accipe radium, et inuolue in extremitate eius cottum inuolutione decenti: deinde proiice oleum, aut succum, aut quod uis ex istis medicinis in cannulam: et ipsa sit in aure: deinde intromitte radium cum cotto desuper, et exprime ipsum manu tua compressione temperata, donec impellatur oleum in concauitate auditus, et sentiat ipsum infirmus interius: et illud quod infunditur in aurem, sit iam calefactum cum igne parumper: et caue ne sit res quae distillatur in eam frigida ualde: medicinae enim non tolerant illud.	And if you wish, take a radius and wrap it around the end of the tube with a bit of packing: then pour oil, or gum, or whatever you like of these medicines into the tube: and let the tube rest in the air: then introduce the radius with the packing above and press down on it with your hand in a moderate way until oil is driven into the curvature of the ear, and the patient feels it inside: and what is poured into the air will be warmed with a little fire: and beware that nothing is distilled in the cold that could be harmful: for medicines do not tolerate this.</start_of_turn>
¶ De cura opilationis accidentis Auri.	On the care of the accidental injury of the ear.</start_of_turn>
Caput VII.	Chapter VII.</start_of_turn>
Quandoque egrediuntur quidam infantes ex uentribus matrum suarum non perforati.	Whenever some infants emerge from the breasts of their mothers without having been perforated.</start_of_turn
Et iam accidit etiam quibusdam hominibus opilatio in meatu Auris a uulnere, aut carne nata in ea.	And sometimes also with some people there is a tearing of the hair in the ear from a wound, or from a natural growth in it.</start_of_turn
Et haec opilatio quandoque fit in profundo foraminis Auris, quam non consequitur uisus: et quandoque accidit ad exteriora foraminis parum, et consequitur eam uisus.	And this tearing of hair sometimes occurs in the deep cavity of the ear, as does not often happen: and sometimes it occurs on the outside of the ear a little, and this often happens.</start_of_turn
Illa ergo quae accidit in profundo Auris, et quam non comprehendit aspectus, est in pluribus dispositionibus difficilis sanationis.	The one that occurs in the deep part of the ear, and which does not comprehend the aspect, is in many situations difficult to heal.</start_of_turn
Et in illa quam consequitur uisus, oportet ut ponas Aurem infirmi in sole, et aspicias in ea: tunc si uides opilationem apparentem, aperi eam cum spatumili subtili, cuius forma est haec quae sequitur, sit extremitas eius in qua sit quaedam latitudo parua, cuius quaedam pars sit acuta: et reliquum spatumile sit duarum laterum lenium: ut non laedat aurem.	And in that which happens with the use of oil, the patient must place the ear of the patient in the sun and instill there: then if the visible tearing of hair appears, open the ear with a fine sponge, the form of which is like this, that is to say, it has a small broad base and a pointed tip: and the rest of the sponge should be soft on both sides: so as not to harm the ear.</start_of_turn
Si ergo opilatio est a carne nata in meatu auris: tunc tene eam cum uncino subtili, et incide eam cum facilitate uehementi, donec auferatur tota caro.	If there is an boil rising from the flesh in the ear: then hold one with a fine clamp, and cut it with ease until the whole flesh is removed.
Quod si opilatio est in profundo auris: tunc accipe radium subtilem, lenem, et calefac ipsum cum igne parumper: deinde mitte ipsum in meatum auris.	If the boil is deep in the ear: then grasp a fine needle, thread, and burn with fire: then withdraw it into the flesh of the ear.
Si ergo senseris opilationem cum eo, quod inuenit infirmus cum grauitate auditus, conare apertionem eius cum facilitate: et caue, ne uulneres neruos auris.	If you sense a boil which causes a deaf person pain in his hearing, try to open it with ease: and take care, lest you damage the nerves of the ear.
Deinde pone in aurem licinium secundum quantitatem amplitudinis foraminis, quod inuoluisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud aliquot diebus, donec sis securus de consolidatione uulneris.	Then place in the ear a bandage according to the extent of the opening which you have made in the cerumen: keep it for a few days, until you are certain that the wound has healed
Aut accipe licinium, et infunde ipsum in aqua rosata, et pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, et utere ipso.	Or grasp a bandage, and soak it in rosewater, and grind over it some powdered ochre, and use it on the wound.
Quod si uides aurem iam apostemari: tunc oportet ut extrahas licinium, et permittas ipsum cum licinio alio, quod inuolues in caeroto quod sit factum cum oleo rosato, donec sedetur apostema calidum: deinde cura ipsum usquequo sanetur.	If you see the ear is already pus-filled: then it is necessary to remove the bandage, and put on another bandage which you will moisten with rosewater, until the swelling subsides: then care for it until it is healed
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis: tunc submerge spongiam, aut pannos in aqua frigida, et pone super eam aurem: et utere reliqua curatione, quae abscindit fluxum sanguinis praedicta in tractatu distillationum.	If blood flows: then plunge a sponge, or pack it in cold water, and put it on the ear: and use the rest of the treatment which expels the blood described in the treatise on distillation.
¶ De cura Altheli palpebrarum.	(The text continues discussing other ailments and their treatments.)
Caput VIII.	(The section title is missing from the provided text.)
Isti Althelil qui accidunt in Palpebris oculi, quandoque sunt humidi, et sunt sicci.	These are the Althelis which happen in the eyes when they are wet and are dry.
Oportet ergo ut teneas eos cum tenaliis: aut cum uncino, et incidas eos cum spatumili a radicibus suis.	It is necessary therefore to hold them with tweezers or with a clamp: or cut them with scissors from their roots
Deinde pone super loca zegi tritum.	Then place upon the wound a piece of cheese.
Si autem ex eis fluat sanguis, tunc cauteriza eos cum cauterio lenticulari subtili.	If blood flows from the wound, then cauterize it with a fine needle cautery.
Et cauterizare eos, est melius post incisionem.	Better is to cauterize after the incision
Multotiens enim redeunt quando remanet ex radicibus suis aliquid.	For many things return when something remains of their roots
Et quando cauterizantur cum igne, comburuntur illae radices, et non redeunt.	And when cauterized with fire, they burn those roots, and they do not return.
¶ De cura Grandinum palpebrarum oculi.	About the care of the great palpebrae of the eye
Caput IX.	Chapter IX
Multotiens accidit in palpebris aliquid quod assimilatur Crandini in fortitudine sua, et sua duricie, et propter illud nominatur Grando: et est aggregatio humiditatis grossae in palpebra superiore, et palpebra inferiore.	Many things happen in the eyelids something that Crandinus thickens in its firmness, and because of this it is called great: and it is an aggregation of thick moisture in the upper eyelid and the lower eyelid.
Operatio ergo in eis est, ut consideres tunc, si est Grando procedens in eo, quod apparet de palpebra, et mouentur ad omnem partem, et res eius est facilis.	The operation is like this, as you will consider, if the great one proceeds from the eyelid and moves over all parts, and its resolution is easy
Finde ergo super eam fissura per latitudinem.	Find therefore upon the edge a width of the fissure
Deinde excoria eam ab omni parte cum facilitate, donec euadat.	Then scrape it off from all around with ease, until it comes away easily
Deinde suspende eam cum uncino, et abscinde ipsam.	Then suspend it with a thread, and cut it off.</start_of_turn>
Si autem non praeparatur tibi abscisio eius, nisi postquam tu penetras palpebram cum incisione parumper, tunc nocet infirmo illud in aliquo.	If however it is not prepared for cutting off, except when you penetrate the eyelid with a small incision, then it harms the sick in some way
Quod si fissura est magna: tunc aggrega ipsam cum sutura: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	If the incision is great: then gather it together with a suture: and care for it until it heals.</start_of_turn>
Et si est parua, non superueniet tibi malum ex ea.	And if it is small, it will not cause you any harm from it.</start_of_turn
Vnguentum enim restaurat ipsam, et incarnat eam.	The ointment restores itself and nourishes the flesh.
Et si grando est decliuis ad interiora auris uersus superficiem intrinsecam, tunc inuersa palpebram, et suspende grandinem cum uncino: praeter quod indigeas incisione, et preme eam ab omni parte.	If it is large, it is inclined downwards towards the inner parts of the ear; then reverse the eyelids, and suspend the large one with a thread: do not attempt to make an incision, and press upon it from all sides.
Quod si elongatur palpebra per incisionem, non nocet illud in aliquo.	It does not harm to lengthen the eyelid by incision
Deinde ablue oculum post incisionem grandinis, cum aqua salsa: et cura locum cum eo quod incarnat, donec sanetur infirmus.	Then wash out the eye after the incision of the large one, with salt water: and care for the place with it, until the patient is healed
¶ De cura Axirnath palpebrarum.	On the care of the eyelids.
Caput X.	Chapter X.
Axirnath est adeps qui generatur in tunicis palpebrae superioris: et plurimum quidem accidit illud pueris: et ipsum grauat oculos eorum, et accidunt eis catarri in matutinis, et non possunt intueri lumen solis, propterea, quod lachrymae properant ad eos, et propter illud uides eos discumbere super facies suas semper, et super eas dormiunt, et sunt palpebrae eorum sub superciliis humidae, quas iam cooperuit inflatio: et eminentia quidem Axirnath apparens est oculo, et quando tu premis locum cum digitis tuis, sentis Axirnath inter eos.	The swelling which is generated in the upper eyelid is called Axirnath: and it mostly happens in children: and it weighs down the eyes, and causes the appearance of black spots in the mornings, and they are not able to see the light of the sun, because the tears run down their faces always, and over their eyes they sleep, and their eyelids are always wet under their brows, which is why the swelling of Axirnath appears in the eye, and when you press on it with your fingers, you feel Axirnath between your fingers.
Et modus operationis eius est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the method for treating it is to put the patient's head in your lap
Deinde accipe pannum lini, et praepara in eo licinia, et fac ex illo licinio circulum secundum quantitatem quod continet Axirnath ab omni parte.	Then take a piece of linen, and prepare in it some alum, and make from it a circle according to the quantity which contains the Axirnath from all sides
Deinde pone eum super eam, et preme cum digitis tuis ab omni parte, ut aggregetur Axirnath in medio circuli.	Then put it on the eye, and press with your fingers from all sides, so that the Axirnath is gathered in the middle of the circle
Deinde finde in medio illius humiditatis cum spatumili incidente fissuras per latitudinem, et non sit fissura maior illa quae fit in phlebotomia in profundo.	Then find in the middle of it some humidity with a sponge dipped in water, and do not make a wound greater than that which is done in phlebotomy at a depth.
Aut oportet ut findas cutem totam, donec peruenias ad Axirnath in pluribus enim dispositionibus procedit Axirnath ex fissura secundum formam frusti pinguedinis albae.	Either the whole skin should be stripped off, until the Axirnath comes out through a wound following the shape of a white rough scab.
Extrahe ergo eam cum panno, quem infiltrasti inter digitos tuos ad exteriora: et tu reuoluis manum tuam ad dextram et sinistram, donec dispergatur: et caue, ne addas in fissura, ut non peruenias cum spatumili ad oculum, et laedas eum.	Either the whole skin must be stripped off until the Axirnath comes out through a wound following the shape of a white rough scab.
Si autem non appareat tibi Axirnath in principio fissurae, tu addas in fissura parum cum facilitate, donec procedat Axirnath.	Or if the Axirnath does not appear at the beginning of the wound, a little should be added to the wound with ease until the Axirnath comes out.
Deinde extrahe eam, sicut diximus.	Then extract it as we have said.
Deinde submerge pannos in aceto et aqua, et pone eos super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis.	Then soak the bandages in vinegar and water, and put them on the place, and bind it up with wool.
Et ex hominibus sunt qui terunt salem, et ponunt ipsum in concauitate fissurae, ut liquefiat quod remansit ex illa humiditate.	And from men there are some who smear salt on it, and put it in the bottom of the wound, so that the rest which remains from that humidity will liquefy.
Deinde cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it heals.
Si autem accidat in loco apostema calidum, tune cura ipsum cum emplastris sedatiuis, donec sanetur.	If, however, there should happen in the place of the bad blood a soft swelling, then care for it with soothing plasters until it heals.
¶ De modis Ataxmir oculi, id est, cum palpebra mollificatur oculi, unde fit ut rugetur sicut non debet.	Concerning the treatment of the eye, that is, when the palpebra is softened, the eye will become red as it should not.
Caput XI.	Chapter 11.
Quando nascuntur in palpebris oculi pili additi praeter cursum sub pilis naturalibus, et antiquantur: tunc ipsi nocent oculo, et faciunt accidere modos aegritudinum, sicut lachrymas assiduas, et mollificationem palpebrarum, et albuginem, donec fit illud caussa destructionis oculi.	When nails grow in the eyelashes beyond the normal course under the natural hairs, and are numerous: then they harm the eye, and cause diseases such as excessive tears, softening of the eyelids, and pus, until this becomes the cause of destruction of the eye.
Et Ataxmir quidem oculi curatur secundum quatuor modos.	And the treatment of the eye is according to four methods.
Aut per cauterium cum igne.	Or by cautery with fire.
Aut cum medicina acuta, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo cauterii.	Or with acute medicine, as is prescribed in the chapter on cautery.
Aut curatur Ataxmir per incisionem et suturam.	Or Ataxmir is cured by incision and stitching.</start_of_turn>
Aut per cannas, secundum quod ego dicam.	Or by needles, as I shall say.</start_of_turn>
Oportet ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	You must place the head of the patient in your lap.</start_of_turn
Deinde conuerte palpebram oculi manu tua sinistra.	Then grasp the eyelash of the eye with your left hand.</start_of_turn
Si ergo conuertitur, bonum est.	If it turns, that is good.</start_of_turn
Et si non: intromitte acum in eam, in qua sit filum ab inferiori parte palpebrae, et fac penetrare acum cum filo desuper, et sit illud prope pilos ipsos, id est, prope marginem palpebrae, in quo nascuntur pili: et trahe filum ad superiora cum palpebra, et conuerte eam cum radio.	And if not: introduce the needle into the eye at the place where the lash hair arises from the lower part of the eyelid, and pass the needle through with the thread, and let it rest close to the hair itself, that is, close to the margin of the eyelid where the hair is born: and draw the thread upwards with the eyelid, and join the needle to the radio.</start_of_turn
Deinde finde in interiori parte palpebrae sub pilis additis cum spatumili incidente a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus.	Then find in the inner part of the eyelid under the added hair a mark of the greater lachrymal gland up to the lesser lachrymal gland.</start_of_turn
Deinde extrahe filum, et pone sub palpebra puluillum paruum ex cotto, aut panno: deinde signa super palpebram cum encaustro, quod sit sicut figura folii myrti.	Then draw out the thread, and put under the eyelid a small piece of cotton or gauze: then mark on the eyelid with the cautery, which shall be like the figure of a myrtle leaf.</start_of_turn
Verumtamen oportet, ut fit figura secundum quantitatem et eleuationem palpebrae: quoniam iam diuersificatur illud in hominibus.	It is true that it must be done according to the quantity and elevation of the eyelid: for as it is varied in men.</start_of_turn
Ex eis enim est, qui indiget ut incidatur ex palpebra quantitas magna, secundum quantitatem quae mollificatur a palpebra.	From this it is evident that some people require a greater incision of the eyelid, according to the quantity which is softened by the eyelid.</start_of_turn
Deinde cum spatumili finde super duas lineas quas signasti, et incipe a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus, et sit fissura una prope pilos naturales, sicut est grossitudo radii.	Then when the mark is found on two lines which you have signed, and you have reached from the greater lachrymal gland to the lesser lachrymal gland, and there is one wound close to the natural hair, as is the thickness of a radius.</start_of_turn
Deinde intromitte uncinum in uno duorum angulorum cutis.	Then insert the hook into one of the two angles of the skin.
Deinde excoria ipsam totam.	Then scrape the whole area clean.</start_of_turn>
Deinde aggrega cum sutura duo labia, cum acu et filo lana subtili: et absterge sanguinem, et fac adhaerere quod superfluit ex filis super duo supercilia, cum quibusdam rebus inuiscantibus, si uis facere illud: et si non, non cures.	Then join together the two lips with a suture, with a needle and a fine thread: and drain the blood, and make fast what is surplus from the thread above the two superciliums, with some painful things if you wish to make it so: and if not, do not worry.</start_of_turn>
Deinde dimitte suturam et fila usque ad tres dies, aut quatuor: postea cura illud.	Then remove the suture and the thread after three days, or four: then care for it.</start_of_turn
Et si uis, dimitte uulnus absque sutura, et cura ipsum cum eo, quod exsiccat et constringit.	And if you wish, leave out the wound without a suture, and care for it with that which dries and contracts it.</start_of_turn
Nam palpebra eleuatur apud sigillationem uulneris et aggregationem eius: sed futura est melior.	For the eyelids swell up at the sealing of the wound and its gathering: but the future is better.</start_of_turn
Hunc modum curandi Ataxmir docuerunt antiqui.	Thus Ataxmir teaches us to treat this.</start_of_turn
Verumtamen in eo est sollicitudo super infirmum, et est ex bona operatione, et non est in eo timor.	But indeed the patient is anxious about the infirmity, and it comes from a good operation, and not from that.</start_of_turn
Et modus alius est in Ataxmir etiam: et est, ut signes super palpebram figuram, quae sit sicut figura folii myrti, sicut narrauimus.	And another way in Ataxmir also: and it is that the sign on the eyelid should be like the figure of a myrtle leaf, as we have told.</start_of_turn
Deinde eleua palpebram cum tribus uncinis separatis, aut aggregatis, secundum formam hanc quae sequitur, deinde incide quod superfluit cum forficibus paruis, secundum hanc formam, cum aequalitate incisionis.	Then lift the eyelid with three hooks separated or gathered, according to the shape of this sign, and then cut away what is surplus with small scissors, according to this shape, with the equality of the incision.</start_of_turn
Si autem non est tibi possibile tenere uncinum, et non aequatur illud: tunc accipe acum in qua sit filum, et intromitte ipsum in medio figurae: et intromitte filum aliud prope lachrymale maius, et filum secundum prope lachrymale minus: et aggrega inter digitos tuos fila cum aequalitate.	If, however, it is not possible to hold the hook, and it does not equal this: then grasp the point where the thread is and insert it into the middle of the figure: and insert another thread near the greater lacrimal gland, and another thread near the smaller lacrimal gland: and join the threads between your fingers with equality.</start_of_turn
Deinde eleua manum tuam eleuatione aequali: et eleua cutem super quam est signatum cotum, sicut narrauimus.	Then raise your hand equally high: and raise the skin above that which is marked with the cubit, as we have said.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then join together two lips of the wound with a suture: and care for it until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
Si uero accidat apostema apud incisionem tuam, aut fissuram tuam: seda illud apostema cum caeroto, et his similibus, ex unguentis sedantibus.	If therefore a swelling should happen at your incision, or a tear: stop that swelling with sponges soaked in urine, or like these, from settled urine.</start_of_turn>
Et quandoque accidit palpebrae etiam, ut conuertantur pili eius.	And when the eyelashes also happen, as they twist their hair.</start_of_turn
Oportet ergo ut utaris in ea quod diximus in incisione: sed sutura utrisque magis est artificialis.	It is therefore necessary that you should use what we have said concerning the incision: but the suture of both is artificial.</start_of_turn
¶ De cura Ataxmir cum cannis.	About care for the wound with dogs.</start_of_turn
ET Est, ut conuertas palpebram, et scindas fissuram quae est deintus, secundum quod narraui.	And it is, that you cover the eyelashes, and split the tear that is from within, according as I have said.</start_of_turn
Deinde arte fac duas cannas, aut duo ligna subtilia: quarum longitudo sit secundum longitudinem palpebrae, et latitudo earum sit minor latitudine spatumilis: et tu iam incidisti in extremitatibus utriusque ab utrisque partibus ubi tenes fila.	Then make two needles, or two thin sticks: whose length is according to the length of the eyelashes, and the width of them be less than the width of the pupil: and you will pass through the extremities at the two parts where you have the thread.</start_of_turn
Deinde aggrega utramque cum subtilitate super illud quod superfluit ex palpebra oculi, et stringe duas cannas ab utrisque partibus strictura forti, et dimitte eam diebus aliquot.	Then join together each one with a little with the superfluous part of the eyelash, and string two needles from both parts firmly, and let go of it every few days.</start_of_turn
Cutis enim stricta morietur, et denigrabitur, et putrefiet, donec cadet per se.	The skin therefore being thus tightly closed will die, and become black, and putrefy, until it falls away by itself.</start_of_turn
Si ergo tardatur, tunc incide eam cum forficibus.	If therefore it is delayed, then cut through it with shears.</start_of_turn
Deinde cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it is healed.</start_of_turn
Cum ergo consolidatur, eleuatur palpebra: et non pungunt pili.	When the bone is firmly set, elevate the eyelids: and do not puncture the hair.
Et haec est forma duarum cannarum, quas facies secundum hanc figuram, et quantitatem in longitudinem et latitudinem.	This is the shape of two needles, which you make according to this figure and the quantity in length and breadth.
¶ De eleuatione pilorum pungentium in oculo cum acu.	Regarding the elevation of hairs that puncture in the eye with the needle
Caput XII.	Chapter XII
Operatio in illo est, ut accipias acum subtilem, et intromittas in eam filum ex serico subtile, lene.	The operation in this case is that you take a fine needle and introduce it into the silk thread, which is lenient.
Deinde aggreges extremitates eius, et nodes utramque nodo subtili ualde: et sit longitudo filorum palmus unus.	Then you join the ends of it and knot both knots with a fine knot: and let the length of the thread be equal to one palm
Deinde compone in Alinxotati filum aliud subtile sub eo in breui, et noda extremitates eius si uis.	Then make another fine knot on the Alinxotati thread under this one in a short space, and knot the ends of it if you wish.
Deinde ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo, et sit prope solem ut declaretur operatio: quoniam est operatio subtilis, uel minuta.	Then you place the patient's head in your hand, and let it be close to the sole so that the operation is declared: because the operation is slight, or a moment.
Deinde intromitte acum cum alinxotati in radicem palpebrae, et fac eam penetrare in palpebram festinanter, donec extrahas eam desuper pilum naturalem.	Then introduce the needle with the Alinxotati at the root of the eyelid, and make it penetrate the eyelid quickly, until you have extracted the natural hair from above.
Deinde trahe pilum usque supra alinxotati: et intromitte in alinxotati illum pilum: si est unus, aut duo, aut tres, non plures.	Then draw out the hair until above the Alinxotati: and introduce the needle into the Alinxotati with one, or two, or three, not more
Deinde trahe manum tuam cum eo, donec egrediatur pilus cum alinxotati in palpebra cum pilo naturali.	Then draw your hand away with it, until the hair comes out with the Alinxotati in the eyelid with the natural hair
Si autem trahatur alinxotati, et non egrediatur pilus cum ea: trahes alinxotati ad inferiora, cum filo quod tu composuisti in ea, donec egrediatur alinxotati ex foramine superiori, et uideas eam uisione oculi: tunc enim trahes alinxotati, et filum: et extrahe utraque, et claude oculum: et dimitte ipsum clausum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec adhaereat pilus loco suo, et nascatur super ipsum caro.	If, however, you pull out the Alinxotati, and the hair does not come out with it: pull out the Alinxotati to the lower part, with the thread which you made in it, until the Alinxotati comes out through the upper hole, and you see the eye: then pull out the Alinxotati and the thread, and close the eye: and leave it closed for two days, or three, until the hair has adhered to its place and has grown over the wound.<start-of-turn>
Quod si pilus est breuis, tunc aut associa ei pilum longum ex pilis naturalibus, et eleuatur cum eo: aut dimitte ipsum, donec elongetur post spacium, et tunc eleua ipsum.	If the hair is short, then either associate with it a long hair from natural hair, and elevate with it: or dismiss it until it has elongated over space, and then elevate it.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae accidit in palpebra superiori.	If the hair is short, then either associate with it a long hair from natural hair, and elevate with it: or dismiss it until it has elongated over space, and then elevate it.
Caput XIII.	If the hair is short, then either associate with it a long hair from natural hair, and elevate with it: or dismiss it until it has elongated over space, and then elevate it.
Quando accidit oculo haec Alxatrati, nominatur Leporina.	When this happens to the eye, it is called the Leporina.
Et haec Alxatrati est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	This happening of the eye is either natural or accidental
Accidentalis ergo fit ex consolidatione uulneris, aut sectionis, aut cauterii, et similium illis.	Accidental is thus caused by the consolidation of the wound, or the section, or the cautery, and things like these
Et modus operationis in ea est, ut tu findas illam consolidationem, et ut separes labia eius, et ponas in eo quod est inter ea licinium ex lino, et liges eam, donec sanetur.	And the way of operating in these is that you find the consolidation and separate its lips, and put between them what is between them from the thread, and bind them, until it is healed
Et non oportet, ut utaris in curatione eius rebus quae exiccant et constringunt: nam si tu facis illud, redit Alxatrati deterior quam fuit: imo utere in ea rebus quae mollificant, sicut foenumgraecum: et embroca cum aqua, in qua cocta sit althea, semen lini: et unguento dyaquilon, quod liquefactum sit cum aliquo ex oleis: et inuolue cum eo licinium, et cura cum eo.	And it does not befitting, that you use in its cure those things which excite and constrict: for if you do this, the Alxatrata will be worse than before: rather use in these those things which soften, such as barley chaff: and embrocate with water in which be dissolved alum, seed of flax: and ointment of beeswax, which is liquefied with some oil: and apply with it the thread, and care with it
Et thesaurus curationis tuae est, ut coneris omni ingenio, ut non consolidetur, secundum formam quae fuit in primis.	And your store of remedies is, that you prepare with all your ingenuity, that it does not solidify, according to the form which was in the beginning
Et haec quidem operatio quam diximus, non est nisi quaedam rectificatio Alxatrati, ut non redeat forma loci secundum quod fuit omnino.	And this operation which we mentioned, is not except some rectification of the Alxatrata, that it does not return to the form which was throughout
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae fit in palpebra inferiori, et est rugatio uel contractio sursum ad dextrum et sinistrum.	Of the care of the Alxatrata which happens in the lower eyelid, and is the wrinkling or contraction upwards to the right and left
Caput XIIII.	Chapter 123.
Haec Alxatrati quae fit inferius, est quae uere nominatur Alxatrati.	This is the lower part of the wound which is truly called the Alxatrati.
Et est naturalis, et est accidentalis.	It is natural and is an accident
Et accidentalis fit ex uulnere, aut fissura, aut cauterio, et illis similibus.	It is caused by a wound, or a fissure, or a burn, or similar things
Et uia operationis in ea est, ut accipias acum, in qua sit filum duplum, et tingas eam in carnem, et facias eam penetrare a lachrymali sinistro usque ad lachrymale dextrum, donec perueniat filum in duabus extremitatibus carnis.	And the way to treat it is to take hold of the hook, which has a double thread, and pass it through the flesh from the left tear to the right tear, until the thread comes out at both ends of the flesh
Deinde extende carnem ad superiora cum acu, et incide eam cum spatumili lato.	And then extend the flesh upwards with the hook, and cut the flesh with a broad spatula
Si ergo redit figura palpebrae secundum quod oportet, est bonum.	If the edges of the wound return to their normal position as required, it is good.
Et si non, accipe radium, et pone ipsum in fissuram, et conuerte cum eo palpebram: et finde duas fissuras in latere interiore palpebrae, et sint extremitates duarum fissurarum ex duobus angulis incisionis, donec concurrant et fiat ex eis angulus: donec quando aggregantur fiat figura earum haec figura, et est litera lauda graeca.	And if not, take the thread and pass it through the wound, and tighten it with the pliers: and make two holes at the inner angles of the eye, and let the two ends of the two holes emerge from the two angles: until when they gather they make the shape of the letter "G".
Deinde aufer illam carnem per quantitatem, quod est latus eius acutum inferius, ab eo quod sequitur palpebram.	And then remove that piece of flesh as much as the breadth of the acute lower part of the eye, from that which follows the eye
Deinde aggrega partes separatas: sue eam cum filo lanae.	And then reunite the separated parts: sew them with a thread and a needle.
Deinde cura eas cum eo quod diximus, de medicinis mollificantibus, et liciniis, donec sanentur.	And then care for the eye as we have said, with soothing medicines and salves, until it heals
Et si Alxatrati accidat ex fissura, et sutura, aut cauterio: tunc oportet ut findas fissura plana sub pilis palpebrarum, etiam secundum quod praecessit.	And if the Alxatrati comes from a fissure, or a suture, or a burn: then you must find a flat wound under the eyelashes, even as before
Deinde separa inter duo labia cum licinio, secundum quod diximus.	Then separate between the two lips with a ligature, as we have said.
Et summa sermonis de cura Alxatrati, quando est desuper, aut inferius, est, ut currat in ea operatio, secundum quod praeparatur ex forma Alxatrati.	And thus the sum of the discourse concerning the care of Alxatratus is that when he is above or below, that is, when he is to be treated in this operation, it is done in the manner of Alxatratus himself
Ipsa namque est multarum diuersitatum in forma: et artifex prudens praeparat ingenium cum quocunque modo est possibile ei, donec redire faciat figuram ad formam naturalem, aut prope eam, et ipsemet infirmus, secundum quod conuenit ei ex operatione et instrumentis in plurimis dispositionibus.	For she herself is of many various forms: and a prudent artificer prepares the limb in whatever way is possible for him, until he directs that it should take the natural form, or one very like it, and the patient himself, according as it suits him from the operation and the instruments in various positions
¶ De adhaerentia palpebrae oculi cum coniunctiua, aut cornea.	As to the adhesion of the palpebrae oculi with the conjunctiva, or the cornea.
Caput XV.	Chapter 15.</start_of_turn>
Quandoque accidit haec consolidatio multis hominibus, ita ut consolidetur palpebra superior cum albedine oculi, et prohibeat ipsum ab operationibus suis naturalibus.	When this happens to many people, it is like the consolidation of the upper eyelid with the white of the eye, and it prevents it from doing its natural operations.
Oportet ergo quod intromittas extremitatem radii sub palpebra, et eleues eam sursum: aut extendas eam cum uncino: deinde incide adhaerentiam cum spatumili subtili, quod non sit cum acuitate incisionis spatumilium, imo sit obtusum parumper: ut non inquietetur infirmus apud operationem, et remoueatur spatumile, et laedat oculum cum acuitate sua: et sit incisio tua quasi tu excories illam adhaerentiam cum facilitate, donec quando redit palpebra secundum formam suam naturalem, et sanetur adhaerentia tota.	It is necessary therefore to introduce the end of the radius under the eyelid, and to raise it up: or to extend it with a hook: then to divide the adhesion with a fine spatula, which should not be as acute as the incision of the spatula, but rather blunt and parallel: so that it does not irritate the patient during the operation, and that it should be able to move the spatula and the eye without difficulty. And let the incision be like that which you would make to scratch that adhesion with ease, until the eyelid returns to its natural form and the adhesion is completely healed
Funde tunc in oculum aquam salsam, cum aqua ablue ipsum: aut distilla in ipsum ex sief facto, ex ziniar dissoluto cum aqua.	Then pour water with salt into the eye, while gently wiping away the blood: or distill into it from a sieve made from barley flour dissolved in water.</start_of_turn>
Deinde separa inter palpebram et oculum cum licinio lini: et pone super oculum lanam infusam cum albugine oui: et post diem tertium utere sief, et cum solidatiuis, donec sanetur.	Then separate between the lip and the eye with a ligature of silk thread: and place upon the eye a wool pad soaked in alum: and on the third day remove the sieve and the solids, until it is healed.</start_of_turn
¶ De incisione ungulae et eminentiae carnis lachrymarum.	On the incision of the nail and the elevation of the meat of the tear-ducts.
Caput XVI.	On the incision of the nail and the elevation of the meat of the tear-ducts.
Scias, quod ungula est secundum duos modos.	You know that the nail is according to two modes.
Aut est neruosa: et est similis sifac duro, subtili.	Or it is fleshy: and it is like soft wax, thin.
Aut est non neruosa, similis humiditati congelatae albae: quae quando tangit cam ferrum, aut conaris capere eam cum uncino, abscinditur, et non figitur in ea uncinus.	Or it is not fleshy, like frozen white moisture: which, when it touches iron, or you try to grasp it with a hook, it breaks off and does not remain in it.
Et utraeque species non incipiunt, nisi a lachrymali maiore, usquequo uadit paulatim, donec cooperit uisum, et prohibet lumen, et motum oculi.	And both kinds do not begin except from the greater tear-duct, until it has gradually become softened, until it covers the useful part, and excludes light and the movement of the eye
Et modus operandi in incisione eius est: ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the manner of working in its incision is: as you place your diseased head in your lap.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et eleua palpebram manu tua.	Then open its eyes, and elevate its eyelid with your hand
Deinde collige ungulam cum uncino paucae duplationis, et extende eam ad superiora.	Then collect the nail with a hook of few turns, and extend it upwards.
Deinde accipe acum, et intromitte in eam pilum ex pilis equi, et bouis, aut uaccae: et sit filum forte, et duplica extremitatem acus parumper, et fige eam in medio ungulae: et penetra eam cum acu, et liga cum filo ungulam, et extende eam ad superiora: et excoria cum pilo latus ungulae quod sequitur pupillam, ac si tu serres eam cum pilo usque ad postreimnum eius.	Then take a needle, and penetrate it through the hair from the hair of the horse, and sow, or ligate: and let the thread be strong, and double the end of the needle slightly, and fix it in the middle of the nail: and penetrate it with the needle, and ligate the nail with the thread, and extend it upwards: and remove the surrounding hair with the nail that follows the pupil, as if you were grooming the nail until its extremity.
Deinde incide residuum in radice lachrymalis cum spatumili subtili, aut cum forficibus paruis: et dimitte carnem lachrymalis naturalem, ut non accidat ex incisione eius cursus lachrymarum assiduus.	Then cut the remaining part at the root of the tear-duct with fine scissors, or with small forceps: and let go of the natural meat of the tear-duct, so that it does not suffer from the incision of its course of tears
Et quandoque extenditur ungula cum uncino solo: aut cum filo, sicut diximus.	When an ungulay is extended with a single thread: or with a piece of wire, as we have said.
Deinde excoriatur cum spatumili leni, cuius haec est forma.	Then it is to be pared with a blunt spatula of fine texture, whose form is as follows.
Et caue, ne tangat spatumile tunicam corneam, et accidat in ea ruptura, et perforetur pupilla.	Beware lest you tear the delicate membrane of the cornea, and cause a perforation of the pupil.
Deinde post incisionem, proice in oculum aliquid salis contriti, aut ex sief facto ex ziniar, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then, after the incision, pour some powdered salt, or mix it from barley flour, and leave it in the eye until tomorrow.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur.	And care for the eye until it has healed.
Quod si ungula est non neruosa, et non potes intromittere in eam acum, neque figitur in ea uncinus, tunc multotiens curatur haec species ungulae cum medicinis, et sanatur sicut narraui in diuisione.	If the nail is neither nerve nor bone, and does not secrete pus into the wound, then it must be treated in many ways with the help of physicians, and will heal as I have mentioned before
Quod si uis incidere eam, tunc aperi oculum infirmi, et accipe spatumile subtile, lene, debilis acuitatis, secundum hanc formam.	If you wish to make an incision in the eye, then open the eye of the patient, and grasp the membrane under a fine, soft spatula, of slight degree of sharpness, according to this form
Et rade ungulam desuper rasione cum subtilitate.	And remove the nail from above with care and precision
Quod si uides quod ipsa rarificatur et confringitur, et imprimit in eam rasio, tunc distilla ex hora tua in oculum ex sief facto ex ziniar, aut ex sief rubeo, aut sale trito: et opila oculum usque ad diem alium.	If you see that it is becoming soft and broken, and that it has burst in the ratio, then do not instill anything into the eye from this hour until tomorrow. Mix together barley flour, or red ochre, or salt, and instill in the eye
Deinde itera super ipsam operationem, donec remoueatur totum eius.	Then repeat the operation until it is completely finished
Nisi contrarium sit tibi in oculo apostema calidum: tunc enim dimitte ipsam, et cura apostema, donec sanetur.	Except that in the eye there be a thick yellow pus: then indeed do remove it, and care for the pus until it has healed
Deinde itera operationem super ipsam cum rasione, donec sanetur.	Then repeat the operation with care until it has healed
Eminentia autem carnis lachrymalis, si nocet in oculo nocumento magno, suspendatur cum uncino, et incide ex ea partem eius: et non ultimes incisionem, ut non accidat cursus lachrymarum.	The swelling of the caruncular membrane of the lacrimal gland, if it hinders the eye at night, is to be suspended with a single thread, and to cut away a part of it: and do not make the incision at the end, lest you cause the discharge of the tears to be delayed
Deinde stilla in lachrymale sief rubeum, aut factum ex ziniari, donec sanetur.	Then stay still in the tear of the red [eye], or make it from the iris, until it heals.
¶ De incisione Alguardenic, et carne nata in oculo.	Regarding the incision of the pupil, and the native tissue of the eye.
Caput XVII.	Chapter XVII.</start_of_turn>
Nascitur quandoque in quibusdam oculis hominum caro rubea composita, uel superposita, donec cooperit pupillam, aut appropinquat, aut stringit super palpebras, et fortasse conuertit palpebras ad exteriora: et assimilatur rosae balaustinae.	Sometimes in the eyes of men there is a red piece of flesh composed or superposed, which covers the pupil, approaches or tightens over the eyelashes, and perhaps turns the eyelashes outwards: and it is assimilated like the dust of roses.</start_of_turn
Et operatio in ea etiam est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And also in this case there is an operation, as you put your hand in my belly.</start_of_turn
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et collige illam carnem totam cum uncinis conuenientibus ad illud: et tene illud cum forcipe uno, aut gesti.	Then open his eyes, and collect all that flesh with hooks which are convenient for this: and hold that with a force one, or grasp it.</start_of_turn
Deinde incide carnem in primis, donec finiatur totum eius cum incisorio.	Then cut the flesh at first, until it is finished with the knife.</start_of_turn
Et caue ab oculo, ut non laedas ipsum apud operationem: et sit incisio tua qua ipsam incidis, aut cum spatumili, quod narrauimus in incisione ungulae: aut cum forficibus paruis, cum quibus colligitur asebel, secundum quod ueniet forma eius post hoc capitulum.	And burn from the eye, so that you do not damage it in the operation: and let your incision be like that which we mentioned in the incision of the nail: or with small forceps, with which you collect fat, according as will come after this chapter.</start_of_turn
Cum ergo completur incisio tua, et remouetur tota alguardenici, tunc imple oculum ex sale contrito: aut distilla in eum puluerem rubeum, et similia illi ex medicinis corrosiuis: et pone super oculum deforis cottum cum albugine oui: ut securetur ab apostemate calido.	When your incision is finished, and you have moved all the pupil, then put the eye out of salt mixed with flour: or distill into it red powder, and like this from physicians who concoct medicines: and put over the eye a bandage of white wool or linen: to protect from the heat.</start_of_turn>
Quod si remanet ex alguardenici aliquid, et dominatur tibi sanguis calidus, et times apostema calidum: tunc dimitte oculum, et cura ipsum cum eo quod sedat apostema.	And if anything remains of the pupil, and you dominate the hot blood, and wait for the heat of the swelling: then remove the eye, and care for it as it settles the swelling.</start_of_turn
Deinde itera super ipsum cum operatione, donec sanetur.	Then proceed further over the said with the operation until it is healed.
Et similiter fac cum carne addita quae accidit in oculo ex hac specie.	Proceed in like manner with the flesh added which has happened in the eye of this kind.
Verumtamen oportet, ut alienes curationem omnis oculi debilis ex uia naturali, aut ex uia accidentali, operando cum ferro: et non intromittas manum tuam in aliqua harum operationum, donec uideas, quod illud membrum est tolerans illam operationem.	It is necessary to know, that other cures of the eye must be excluded both natural and accidental, operating with iron: and do not insert your hand into any of these operations, until you know that the limb can tolerate that operation.
¶ De collectione Sebel ex oculo.	Of collection of the fat from the eye.</start_of_turn>
Caput XVIII.	Chapter 18.</start_of_turn>
Sebel sunt uenae rubeae quae texuntur super oculum, et prohibent uisui operationem suam: et debilitant oculum cum longitudine dierum.	Fat is a red wax which covers the eye, and hinders the operation of the water: and weakens the eye with the length of days.</start_of_turn
Necesse est ergo tibi in primis, ut consideres, si oculus in quo est Sebel, est fortis, et non est in eo aegritudo aliqua, praeter Sebel: tunc collige Sebel eius.	It is necessary therefore that you should first consider, if the eye in which the fat is, is strong, and is not suffering from any other ailment except for the fat: then collect the fat from it.</start_of_turn
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo.	And it is necessary to prevent the patient from looking downwards.</start_of_turn
Deinde suspende illas uenas cum uncino uno, aut duobus secundum prudentiam tuam: et sit uncinus subtilis duplationis, secundum hanc formam, aut sint duo uncini gradat in corpore uno, secundum hanc formam.	Then suspend those waxes with one or two fingers, according to your prudence: and let the needle be thin as half the diameter, or two fingers together in one body, according to this form.</start_of_turn
Deinde collige cum forficibus subtilibus illas uenas cum subtilitate, et absterge sanguinem hora post horam, donec uideas illas uenas remoueri ex oculo, et resoluuntur: et caue ne laedas oculum cum extremitatibus spatumilis.	Then collect with fine forceps those waxes with attention, and wash away the blood an hour after an hour, until you know that those waxes have been removed from the eye, and have dissolved: and beware lest you damage the eye with the extremities of the forceps.</start_of_turn
Et sit operatio tua in meridie coram sole, et sis firmus in operatione tua ualde: ut non incidas nisi illas uenas.	And let your operation be in the middle of the day before the sun, and be firm in your operation, so that you do not cause any unnecessary damage.</start_of_turn
Et cum tu expleueris, tunc distilla in oculum sief uiride, aut rubeum: ut sua acuitate corrodat quod remansit ex sebel.	When you have finished, then distill into the eye a yellowish or reddish [substance]: so that its sharpness may eat away what remains of the swelling.
Si autem non est tibi possibile colligere illud totum in illa hora, tunc emplastra oculum cum eo, quod sedat dolorem oculi: et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur dolor eius: et securetur ab apostemate calido: deinde itera super ipsum secundum modum eundem, donec sanetur.	When if it is not possible to collect all of it in that hour, then plaster the eye with this, which will soothe the eye pain: and leave it for a few days until the pain subsides: and keep it away from heat: and repeat over it in the same way until it is healed.
Et haec est forma forficis.	This is the form of the forceps.
¶ De reductione Arissati ad nasum.	On the reduction of the swelling of the nose.
Caput XIX.	Chapter XIX.</start_of_turn>
Nominant medici Arissati Fistulam, quam curas cum cauterio, aut cum medicina acuta comburente, secundum quod praecessit eius narratio.	Physicians call the swelling of the nose a Fistula, which they treat with cautery or with acute medicine burning, according to what is appropriate for its nature.</start_of_turn>
Et si non sanatur, tunc non est ingenium in ea: nisi ut findas super apostema apud natiuitatem eius, et extrahas totam humiditatem quae est in eo et pus, donec detegatur os.	If it does not heal, then there is no wisdom in that: except that you find pus at the opening of its cavity, and you remove all the moisture which is in it and pus, until the bone is exposed.</start_of_turn
Cum ergo detegitur os, et uides in eo corruptionem, aut nigredinem, tunc rade ipsum cum instrumento, cuius forma est haec.	When the bone is thus exposed, and the wound is corrupted, or blackened, then smear it with an instrument which has this form.</start_of_turn
Et nominatur Asperi capitis.	This is called the Aspiration of the head.</start_of_turn
Fiat ex ferro indo, et sit caput eius rotundum sicut azir, quod sit punctatum punctatione limae, aut punctatione aliskilferi punctatione subtili: et pone ipsum super locum corruptum ossis.	Make it from iron, and let its head be rounded like an egg, which is pierced with the point of a lime, or with an awl, or with a fine puncture: and place it over the corrupted part of the bone.</start_of_turn
Deinde reuolue ipsum inter digitos tuos, et tu preme manum tuam parumper, donec scias quod illa corruptio iam rasa est: et fac illud aliquotiens.	Then draw it out between your fingers, and your hand close to you, until you know that that corruption is gone: and do this several times.</start_of_turn
Deinde restaura locum cum medicinis exiccatiuis stipticis.	Then restore the place with physicians skilled in stiptic substances.
Si ergo consolidatur locus, et nascitur in eo caro, et abscinditur cursus saniei: et remanet quadraginta diebus, et non renouatur, et non apostematur, et non accidit in eo accidens: tunc scias quia iam sanatus est.	If, however, the place is consolidated and a swelling arises in it, and the flow of the healthy substance is cut off: and it remains for forty days, and does not return, and does not break down, and does not happen in it any chance: then you know that it is healed.</start_of_turn>
Et si non, tunc non est in eo ingenium, nisi reducere fistulam ad foramen nasi, secundum hanc formam.	And if not, then it is not in it the faculty, except to reduce the fistula to the opening of the nose, according to this fashion.</start_of_turn>
Et est, ut detegas ab osse secundo cum ferro, aut cum medicina acuta: et cum detectum est os, tunc accipe terebrum secundum hanc formam, sit extremitas ferrea, triangulata: et lignum eius sit pyramis extenuata usque ad extremitatem, sicut uides.	And it is necessary to grasp the second bone with iron, or with acute medicine: and when it is grasped, then take hold of the prominence according to this fashion, so that the iron be at its extremity, triangular: and the wood of it be extended until the extremity, like water.</start_of_turn
Deinde pone illud super os ipsum: et sit illud prope lachrymale: et elonga manum tuam ab oculo parum.	Then place that upon the bone itself: and let it be close to the tear duct: and extend your hand from the eye a little.</start_of_turn
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum terebro, donec penetret os, et sentiat illud infirmus: per hoc quod inuenit uentum exire ex eo, quando tenet manum suam super nasum suum.	Then withdraw your hand with the prominence, until it pierces the bone, and you feel it is inflamed: by this you will know that the flux has escaped from it, when you hold your hand over your nose.</start_of_turn
Ergo tunc restaura locum cum medicinis stipticis exiccantibus, sicut docui te.	Therefore, then restore the place with physicians skilled in stiptic substances, as I have taught you.</start_of_turn>
Cum ergo nascitur caro, et induratur locus: tunc materia quae effundebatur ad exteriora, redit ad nasum: est ergo leuius illud super infirmum.	When, however, a swelling arises in the carpus and the place is hardened: then the substance which flowed outwards returns to the nose: thus it is easier for it to lie over the inflamed.</start_of_turn
¶ De reductione eminentiae Oculi.	¶ On the reduction of the prominence of the eye.</start_of_turn>
Caput XX.	Chapter XX.</start_of_turn
Quando eminet Oculus cum totalitate sua, et non accidit in uisu nocumentum, neque diminutio: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum: deinde phlebotomes eum: postea ponas uentosas in ceruice absque scarificatione, sed cum suctione.	When the eye is swollen with its entirety, and does not happen in any degree of swelling or diminution: then it is necessary to dissolve the inflammation: then perform phlebotomy on it: afterwards apply moist compresses to the eye without causing a scar, but with suction.</start_of_turn
Deinde pone super Oculum linimentum quod fit ex acacia, et aloe, et olibano, et sarcocolla.	Then apply over the eye a liniment made from acacia, aloe, olive oil, and ochre.
Deinde stringe Oculum desuper super emplastrum cum puluillis multis.	Then bind over the eye a patch with many little seeds
Et modus puluillorum est: ut accipias pannos lenes, multos, et duplicetur omnis pannus ex eis super quatuor: fac ex eis multos: deinde pone eos unum super alium, secundum quantitatem qua indiget Oculus: deinde stringe super ipsos cum panno duro strictura forti.	And as for the seeds, take fine wool, many, and double every thread over four: make many of them: then put one upon another, according to the quantity required for the eye: then bind over them with a strong piece of cloth.
Et itera uentosas cum suctione sine scarificatione.	And do this repeatedly with gentle suction without cutting
Deinde aufer uentosas, et dimitte oculum strictum die et nocte.	Then remove the swelling and keep the eye closed tightly day and night.
Si autem ligamentum iterum mollificatur, tunc oportet ut stringatur multum: deinde aufer ligamentum post diem et noctem, sicut diximus.	If, however, the ligament is again softened, then it must be tightly bound: then remove the ligament after a day and a night, as we have said
Si ergo uides oculum iam redisse uuae tunicae, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam, et uentosas, donec sanetur.	If thus you see the eye again red, then it is good: and if not, then repeat the patch, the seeds, and the binding, and the swelling, until it is healed
¶ De incisionie Vuae tunicae.	Of incision of the edge of the eye
Caput XXI.	Chapter 21.
Quando accidit disruptio in tunica Vuea, deinde eminet et procedit extra palpebras sicut granum Vuae, et foedatur forma hominis propter illud, et uis incidere illud: tunc operatio in eo est, secundum quod narro: et est, ut intromittas acum in radice Vuae ab inferiori ad superiorem partem.	When disruption occurs in the membrane of the eye, then it will protrude and proceed outside the eyelids like a grain of sand, and will be deformed like a man because of that, and you must cut it out: then the operation in this is as we have said, and it is that you introduce the needle into the root of the eye from the lower part to the upper part
Deinde intromitte acum aliam in qua sit filum duplum a parte lachrymalis, et fac eam penetrare: et dimitte acum primam secundum dispositionem suam.	And introduce another needle into which there is a double thread from the lachrymal part, and make it penetrate: and withdraw the first needle according to its position.
Deinde incide locum fili dupli, et liga cum eo partem Vuae in circumitu acus: et stringe eam multum.	Then pierce the place of the double thread, and bind with it the edge of the eye around the needle: and bind it tightly
Deinde extrahe acum, et pone super oculum lanam infusam in albugine oui: et dimitte eum, donec cadat filum cum Vua.	Then extract the thorn, and place above the eye a wool plug soaked in alum: and let it go, until the thread comes out with you.
Deinde cura oculum cum eo, quod confortat ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then care for the eye with this, which soothes it, until the wound is healed.</start_of_turn>
Et quandoque stringitur Vua ab omni parte cum circulo ex panno, donec addat oculus eminentiam magnam.	And when the thread is drawn out from all around with a circle of cloth, until the eye regains its great prominence.</start_of_turn>
Deinde perforetur cum spatumili subtili, quod perueniat ad profundum oculi, et currat humiditas albuginea, et descendat oculus, et ingrediatur statim: deinde stringe eum, donec sanetur.	Then perforate with a fine needle which will reach the depth of the eye, and smear moist albumin, and let the eye go down, and immediately insert: then draw it out, until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
¶ De curatione Alcomnati.	And for the care of the eye.</start_of_turn>
Caput XXII.	Chapter XXII.</start_of_turn
Haec Aegritudo quae nominatur Alcomnati, non, est nisi sanies, quae aggregatur in oculo, similis aquae descendenti, et non est ipsa.	This ailment which is called Alcomnati, is not other than health which collects in the eye, like water which descends, and is not itself.</start_of_turn
Et modus operandi in ea est, ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem praeparatum, uel directum.	And the way of dealing with it is that you make the patient sit on a prepared seat, or directly.</start_of_turn
Deinde accipe caput eius manibus tuis a partibus duabus, et moue ipsum, donec uideas saniem peruenire ad inferiora oculis tuis.	Then grasp his head with your hands from both sides, and move it, until you see health go up to the lower parts of your eyes.</start_of_turn
Deinde figatur, et non descendat, et absoluatur lumen: et uideat infirmus res sicut uidebat: et si non descendit inferius, scias quia est aqua.	Then stabilize it, and do not let it go down, and open your eyes: and he will see as he saw before: and if it does not go down below, you know that it is water.</start_of_turn
Si autem non praeparatur descensus saniei cum eo quod diximus, tunc fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas.	If however you do not prepare the descent of health with that which we have said, then make the patient sit between your hands.</start_of_turn
Deinde accipe spatumile subtile, et finde cum eo supra panniculum corneum parumper apud continuationem coniunctiuae cum tunica cornea in corona, donec egrediatur sanies.	Then grasp a fine needle, and find with it above the cornical membrane a part of the conjunctiva which is close to the cornea in a circle, until health comes out.</start_of_turn
Cum ergo egreditur, tunc distilla in oculum aquam calidam in qua miscuisti mel: aut aquam in qua iam bullisti foenumgraecum et mel: deinde curetur cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When the patient departs, then let warm water be distilled into the eye which has been mixed with honey: or water in which barley chaff has been boiled with honey. Then let it be treated with the remaining treatment until the patient is healed.
¶ De cura aquae, quae descendit in oculo, uel cataracta.	Concerning the treatment of water which descends into the eye, or for a cataract.
Caput XXIII.	This section is missing from the provided text.
Iam Diximus species aquae in diuisione, et quae conuenit ad perforandum sermone declarante et exponente, tunc accipe illud idem secundum sanitatem.	We have said concerning the species of water in the making of an eye-wash, and which is suitable for the perforation which is declared and shown, then take that which is appropriate according to the health.
Tunc ergo oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas quadratum, oppositum lumini, prope solem: et liga oculum eius sanum, et stringe eum ualde: deinde palpebram oculi eius manu tua dextra, si oculus in quo est aqua, est oculus sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then let the patient sit with his hands square between yours, opposite the light, near the cheek: and bind his healthy eye, and draw it tightly: then take the outer corner of his eye with your right hand, if the eye which has the water in it is the left: or take the outer corner of his eye with your left hand, if the eye which has the water in it is the right
Deinde accipe manu tua dextra almagda, si oculus est sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then take your right hand with the almond, if the eye is left: or your left hand with the almond, if the eye is right
Deinde pone extremitatem almagda prope coronam per grossitudinem radii in ipsa albedine oculi apparente lachrymalis minoris: deinde impelle almagda cum uirtute: et tu reuoluis cum eo manum tuam, donec penetret in albuginem oculi: et sentias, quod almagda iam peruenit ad rem uacuam.	Then place the edge of the almond close to the edge of the pupil along the apparent white of the eye: then push the almond with force: and you will know that the almond has reached the bottom of the eye when you feel that the almond has gone past the edge of the pupil
Et oportet, ut sit mensura itineris almagda ad profundum, mensura spacii quod est a pupilla usque ad finem nigredinis: et est corona oculi.	And it is necessary that the measure of the journey of the almond be to the depth, the measure of the space from the pupil to the end of the black: and this is the rim of the eye
Uidebis enim ea in ipsa pupilla uisione oculi, propter claritatem tunicae corneae.	You will see this in the pupil of the eye by the clarity of the cornea.
Deinde pone almagda usque ad locum in quo est aqua.	Then place the almond until it reaches the place where the water is
Deinde preme ipsum inferius uice una post aliam.	Then immediately the lower part after the upper part.
Si ergo descendit aqua statim, tunc infirmus uidet illud super quod aperit uisum suum statim, et almagda in oculo suo.	If water therefore descends immediately, then the sick person will immediately suffer over that which he has opened up, and the swelling will be in his eye.
Deinde quiescas paululum.	Then rest a little while.
Si ergo descendat aqua, tunc depone eam secundo, praeter quod egrediatur almagda.	If water therefore descends, then draw out the second part except for what is coming out with the swelling.
Quando ergo figitur, et non ascendit: tunc extrahe almagda cum facilitate: et tu reuoluis manum tuam paulatim.	When it has become firm, and does not ascend: then draw out the swelling easily: and you will gradually turn your hand back
Deinde dissolue in aqua aliquid ex sale claro gemmae: et ablue cum eo oculum deintus.	Then dissolve on water some of the clear salt of the gem: and wash with it when the eye is closed
Deinde pone extra oculum totum stuppam, aut lanam infusam oleo rosato, et albugine oui: et liga cum eo oculum sanum.	Then put on the whole eye a cushion, or wool infused with rose oil, and alum: and bind with it the healthy eye.
Nos autem, et illi qui sunt nostri temporis, ponimus super eum ciminum tritum cum albumine oui.	But we, and those who are with us at this time, put on over it a rough cloth with alum and egg white.
Quod si non obedit tibi almagda ad introitum in oculum propter duriciem suam, quoniam ex hominibus est, cuius oculus est durus ualde: tunc oportet ut accipias spatumile, quod nominatur Alberid, cuius haec est forma.	And if the swelling does not obey you to enter the eye because of its hardness, because it is from a man whose eye is hard and cold: then it is necessary that you take a sponge, which is called Alberid, which has this form
Pefora ergo cum eo ipsam coniunctiuam tantum, et non ultimes manum tuam in foramine: et non est nisi ut facias uiam ad almagda locum subtilem.	Wash therefore with it the eye itself joined together, and do not move your hand to the bottom: and do not do anything except make the swelling lie in a low place
Deinde intromitte almagda, secundum quod diximus.	Then introduce the swelling, as we have said before
Et apud complementum operis tui, praeparetur infirmo dormitorium decenter factum, in quo dormiat super dorsum suum in domo tenebrosa: et prohibeatur ab omnibus motibus, et a tussi: et pone cibum eius illud quo lenitur natura eius: et non moueat caput suum dextra, neque sinistra omnino.	And in order to complete your work, prepare the sick person a resting place made in the center, in which he will sleep on his back in a dark room: and prevent him from all movements, and from coughing: and give him food for his nourishment: and do not move his head to the right or to the left at all.
Et sit ligamentum secundum dispositionem suam usque ad diem tertium.	The ligament should remain in its usual position until the third day.
Deinde solue illud in illa domo tenebrosa, et experire uisum eius: et fac eum uidere res.	Then loosen it in the dark chamber and try its action: and make it useful for something.
Deinde reduc ligamentum usque ad diem septimum.	Then reduce the ligament until the seventh day.
Et non oportet ut faciat illud in hora curationis, aut post incisionem statim: imo oportet, ut alienes illud: propterea quod aqua ascendit uelociter per aspectum uehementem.	It should not be forced at the time of care, nor immediately after incision: indeed it should be delayed, because water ascends quickly through the open wound
Si autem accidit apostema calidum: tunc oportet ut soluas oculum ante septimum: et rectifica illud cum eo quod sedat apostema, donec sedatur: tunc absolue ipsius uisum, et pone super faciem eius orale quo regatur uisus eius sub eo diebus aliquot, ipso existente in illa domo tenebrosa.	If however a black swelling occurs: then it is necessary to loosen the eye before the seventh day: and correct it when the swelling has subsided: then the action of the medicine will remain, and put over its face a quantity of the medicine which was previously placed in the dark chamber
Deinde egrediatur a domo gradatim, et conuersetur in casis suis.	Then depart from the dark chamber gradually, and return to your home.
Et scias, quod in zaltea non excusatur discipulus a uisione aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super operationem.	You know that in the hospital a disciple is not excused from seeing the doctor several times: then indeed he will learn about the operation.
Et iam quidem peruenit ad nos quidam ex illis qui sunt de Alayrach, qui dixit, quod factum fuit in Alayrach magdan perforatum, quo sugitur aqua.	And indeed it came to pass that some of those from Alayrach reported that in Alayrach there was a perforation of the bladder, through which water was flowing out
Verum ergo non uidi aliquem in terra uostra, qui fecerit illud: neque legi illud in aliquo ex libris antiquorum: et est possibile, ut sit illud nouum.	Truly no one in our land has ever done this: neither have I read of it in any of the ancient books: and it is possible that it is a new thing.
Et istae sunt formae specierum ex magda, ut stet super ea qui ea ignorat.	These are the forms of the spirits from the madhouse, as they linger over those who ignore them
Fiant ex aere proprie: et sint extremitates eorum cum hac eadem subtilitate triangulatae, et extremitas acuta.	Let them be of air of their own: and their extremities with the same triangular shape, and acute extremities
Formae magda.	The shapes of madmen.
¶ De cura Carnis natae in naso.	On the care of the newly born in the nose
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter XXVIIV.
Quandoque nascuntur in naso Carnes diuersae additae, ex quibus est aliquid quod assimilatur scorpioni multorum pedum: et ex ea est caro cancerosa, lapidea, fusci coloris: et ex ea est quae est caro lenis, non fusci coloris.	When various meats are added to the nose of a Carnes, from which there is something that is absorbed by many scorpions' feet: from this there is a cancerous tumor, a stone, and a fleshy color: from this there is what is a soft tumor, not fleshy colored.
In ea ergo quae ex istis carnibus est lenis, non fraudulenta, neque cancerosa, oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas oppositum soli, et aperi nares eius, et proiice uncinum in illas carnes: deinde trahe eas ad exteriora, et incide quod comprehendisti ex eis cum spatumili subtili acuto a parte una, donec scias quod caro tota iam ablata est.	In this, therefore, which is soft, not fraudulent, neither cancerous, should be made to sit between your hands opposite the solid part, and open its nose, and expel the tongue into those meats: then draw them outwards, and cut away what you have seen with a fine and sharp knife from one side, until you know that the whole flesh has been removed
Quod si remaneret aliquid ex ea cuius abscisio non est possibilis: tunc rade illud cum uno instrumentorum subtilium cum facilitate, donec non remaneat ex eo aliquid.	What if anything remains of that from whose excision is impossible: then cut that away with a fine instrument with ease, until nothing remains of it
Si autem sanguis tibi dominatur, aut accidat apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei per id quod oportet: aut est ex apostematibus malignis, tunc propera cauterizando eum, donec abscindatur sanguis, et auferantur omnes carnes.	If, however, blood dominates you, or a thick clot adheres: then oppose it with that which is suitable: or with malignant clots, then cauterize it until the blood is separated, and remove all the meats.
Deinde proiiciatur in nasum post incisionem acetum, et aqua, aut uinum.	Then spit into the nose after the incision of the flesh, and water, or liquid.
Si autem aperitur nasus, et procedat ex eo humiditas usque ad palatum, tunc scias quia iam sanus est.	If, however, the nose opens, and there proceeds from it moisture up to the palate, then you know that it is already healed.
Si uero non penetrat humiditas, secundum quod oportet, tunc scias quod intra ipsum est caro nata in superioribus ossibus naris, ad quae non peruenit cum incisione instrumentum.	If, however, moisture does not penetrate, according to what is suitable, then you know that the flesh has been born inside the upper bones of the nose, which does not come out with the incision of the instrument.
Tunc ergo oportet, ut intromittas filum lini cui sit quaedam grossitudo, et noda in eo nodos multos: et pone inter omnem nodum quantitatem digiti, aut minus: et ingeniet infirmus, ut mittat extremitatem unam fili in nasum cum radio, aut cum quo possibile est ei postquam fecerit ipsum simile azer: et trahat odoratum suum, donec perueniat usque ad caassum, et egrediatur super guttur suum.	Then, therefore, you must introduce a thread with some thickness into which there are many knots: and put between every knot as much as a digit, or less: and the infirm person will grasp, so that he may send one end of the thread into the nose with a hook, or in whatever way is possible for him to do so after he has made it similar to an ass: and he will draw out the foul matter until it reaches the caulking, and it will go out through the mouth.
Et multotiens quidem faciunt simile huic Attomi pueri in scholis: et est res facilis ei, qui uult.	Many, indeed, do like him in schools, this Attomi boy: it is an easy matter for him who wishes.
Deinde pone duas extremitates fili, extremitatem unam quae egreditur super nasum, et alteram quae remansit in naso.	Then place two extremities of the boy, one which projects beyond the nose, and the other which remains in the nose
Deinde ac ministra serraturam carnis cum nodis qui sunt in filo.	Then grasp the flesh with the minister and close the wound with knots that are in the limb.
Fac illud donec scias quod carnes iam sunt cum nodis fili.	Do this until you know that the flesh is again with the knots of the limb.
Deinde extrahe filum: et pone in nasum post abstersionem sanguinis licinium quod imbibisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud tribus diebus, aut plus, donec unguentum corrodat totum quod remansit ex carnibus.	Then draw out the thread: and put it in the nose after you have washed away the blood with vinegar which you have drunk in Egyptian unguent: do this for three days, or more, until the unguent has eaten away all that remains of the flesh.
Deinde pone in fine rei in nasum cannulam de plumbo, diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	Then put at the end of the thing in the nose a lead cannula for a few days, until it heals.
Si autem indiget curatione quae exiccet, utere illa.	If, however, you think that further treatment is required, do so by all means
Ad caputpurgium faciendum, cum quo distillantur olea, et aliae medicinae in nasum, fac illud ex argento, aut aere: quod sit simile lampadi paruae, apertum sicut conchula: et meatus eius similiter.	For the head of the wound must be made with that with which the oils are distilled, and other medicines in the nose, do this of silver, or of brass: and make its passage like that of the horn of a snail, opened like a conch: and the opening of it like that of a lentil
Et si uis fac cannulam clausam, sicut canna.	And if you wish to make a closed cannula, like a tube
Et conchula instrumenti ad caputpurgium faciendum, sit plena, detecta: cui sit manubrium in postremo eius, cum quo teneas ipsam, quando calefacis in ea oleum, aut quod uis ex succis, et rebus fluxibilibus.	And the cannula for the instrument for making the head of the wound must be full, detected: which has a handle at its back, with which you grasp it, when you heat it in oil, or which you wish to take from succus, and from fluid blood
Et haec est forma instrumenti.	This is the form of the instrument.
¶ De cura Thelul nasi.	Concerning the care of the eye of the nose
Caput XXV.	Chapter XXV.
Multotiens nascitur in extremitate nasi Thelul, et magnificatur, et augmentatur cum diebus, donec foedus fit aspectus eius.	Many are born at the extremity of the nose Thelul, and grow large, and increase with the days until the wound becomes like its aspect.
Et propter illud oportet, ut in cidas illud in principio apparitionis eius, et eradices totum eius.	Therefore it is necessary to cauterise it at the beginning of its appearance, and to drain all of it.</start_of_turn>
Deinde pone super locum, aut cauterium, aut medicinam comburentem quae stat loco eius.	Then place above it either a cautery or a burning medicine which is at its place.</start_of_turn>
Si ergo tardatur incisio eius, donec magnificetur, tunc considera, si est lapideum, durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro: quoniam apostema est cancerosum.	If, however, its incision is slow to take effect while it grows large, then consider whether it is a stone, hard, of the colour of pitch, with little sensation: then do not touch it with iron: for it is cancerous.</start_of_turn>
Multotiens enim uidi, qui incidit hmoni apostema, et accidit ex eo malicia magna super illum qui ipsum habebat.	Many are born from the blood which flows from the wound, and from it comes great malice over the light which it had.</start_of_turn>
Et si apostema est lenis tactus, non fusci coloris, et uides quod incisio possibilis est in toto eius, tunc euacua infirmum, et incide ipsum sine timore, absque pauore: et cura locum cum eo quod exiccat et constringit, donec sanetur.	If indeed the wound is soft to the touch, not of the colour of pitch, and the blood which flows from it is possible to make an incision throughout, then evacuate the sick person and make the incision without fear, without pain: and care for the place with that which covers and binds it until it heals.</start_of_turn>
¶ De sutura nasi, et labii, et auris.	Of the suture of the nose, and the lip, and the ear.</start_of_turn
Caput XXVI.	Chapter XXVI.</start_of_turn>
Scias Quia quando accidit solutio continuitatis in una harum cartilaginum, parum confert in ea operatio, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	You know that when a solution of continuity is made in one of these cartilages, it is little useful in this operation, except in some people.</start_of_turn
Oportet ergo quando accidit alicui aliquid ex illo, ut consideres, si est uulnus recens cum sanguine suo: et tunc aggrega duolabia uulneris cum sutura: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	It is necessary therefore when anything is done to it, that you consider whether there is a wound which runs with its blood: and then join together the edges of the wound with a suture: then care for it until it heals.</start_of_turn
Et si solutionis continuitatis labia iam separata sunt, et facta est unaquaeque pars sana: tunc oportet ut excories omnem partem a cute sua apparente, donec sanguinetur.	And if the solution of continuity of the lip has been separated and is made whole once more: then it is necessary to scour every part from its outer surface until it bleeds.</start_of_turn
Deinde aggrega duo labia cum sutura, et stringe ea, et pulueriza super ipsum sanguinem draconis, et olibanum trita: et pone supra pulueres frustum emplastri diafinicon, et alicuius alterius ex emplastris consolidatiuis: et dimitte ipsum ligatum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then join two lips together with a suture, draw them tight, and sprinkle above them the blood of a dragon, and olibanum that has been triturated: and place above the sprinkles a fragment of diafinicon plaster, and some other solid plaster: and leave the ligation for two days, or three.
Deinde solue ipsum, et permuta medicinam: et dimitte ipsum, donec abscindantur fila per se.	Then remove it, and change the medicine: and leave it until the stitches dissolve by themselves.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with unguents, until it heals.
Modus autem suturae est, ut aggreges solutionem continuitatis, aut cum acubus, sicut narrauimus in sutura uentris: aut aggrega solutionem cum filo, sicut feci te scire.	The way of stitching is that you join together the solution of continuity, or with a lump, as we have narrated in the gut suture: or join the solution with the thread, as you have been told.
¶ De extractione nodorum labiorum.	Regarding the extraction of lip nodes.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter XXVII.</start_of_turn>
Multis Quidem hominibus accidunt plaerumque in interioribus labiorum suorum apostemata dura similia granis herbi: et quaedam eorum minora, et maiora.	Many people have these things happen to them in the insides of their lips, behind their teeth, things that are like hard grains of herbs: and some of them are small, and some are large.</start_of_turn>
Ergo oportet ut conuertas labium, et findas super omnem nodum eius, et suspendas ipsum cum uncino, et incidas ipsum ab omni parte.	Therefore it is necessary to cover the lips, and find on every node of them, and suspend it with a hook, and cut it away from all sides.</start_of_turn
Deinde impleas locum post incisionem zegi trito, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then put on the place of the incision a piece of burnt alum, until the blood has clotted.</start_of_turn
Deinde colluatur cum aceto, et curetur locus cum eo, in quo est stipticitas, usquequo sanentur uulnera.	Then bandage it with vinegar, and care for the place with it, in which there is styptic action, until the wound has healed.</start_of_turn>
¶ De incisione carnis natae super gingiuam.	Regarding the incision of the natural flesh over the gums.</start_of_turn>
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter XXVIII.</start_of_turn
Multotiens nascitur super gingiuam caro addiat, quam antiqui nominant abuluss.	Many things are born on the gums, flesh that the ancients call abuluss.</start_of_turn
Oportet ergo ut suspendas eam cum uncino: aut teneas eam cum forcipibus, et incidas eam apud radicem suam, et dimittas saniem currere, aut sanguinem.	It is necessary therefore that you suspend the bowels with a single hook: either grasp them with forceps, and cut them at their root, and let the bowels go, or let the blood flow out.
Deinde pone super locum zegi tritum, aut alios pulueres stipticos, exiccatiuos.	Then place over the place of injury a piece of charcoal or other absorbent powder, and dry it out.
Quod si redit illa caro post curationem, nam multotiens redit, tunc incide eam secundo, et cauteriza ipsam: ipsa namque non redit post cauterium.	If the flesh returns after the treatment, for it does not often return, then cut through it again, and burn it: for it will not return after being burned.</start_of_turn>
¶ De rasione Dentium cum ferro.	Regarding the wisdom of using a tooth with a iron.</start_of_turn>
Caput XXIX.	Chapter XXIX.</start_of_turn>
Quandoque aggregantur in superficiebus Dentium ab interiori et extetiori parte, et inter gingiuas cortices asperi, turpes, et quandoque denigrantur, et citrini fiunt, et uirides, donec peruenit ex illo corruptio ad gingiuam, et foedi fiunt dentes per illud.	When these things gather on the surfaces of the teeth from the inside and outside, and between the gums, the enamel becomes rough, black, and sometimes decays, and cavities appear, and the teeth become yellow until the corruption reaches the gum, and cavities form in the teeth from this.</start_of_turn
Oportet ergo ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et caput eius in sinu tuo, et rade molam et dentem, in quo apparent tibi cortices, et res similis arenae: donec non remaneat ex eis aliquid, et similiter fac de nigredine, et uiriditate, et citrinitate, et aliis donec mundentur.	It is necessary therefore that you make the infirm man sit between your hands, and hold his head in your lap, and move the tongue and the tooth, in which you see the enamel, and things like sand: until something remains from that, and do the same with black material, and yellowing, and cavities, and other things until the matter is cleansed.</start_of_turn
Si ergo auferatur quod in eis est a principio rasionis, bonum est: et si non, tunc itera super eos rasionem die alio, secundo, et tertio, donec ad ultimum perueniat studium in eo quod uis.	If therefore that which is in the matter from the beginning of the wisdom is taken away, it is good: and if not, then repeat the wisdom day by day, second, and third, until the study is finally completed in that which you wish.</start_of_turn
Et scias, quod dens indiget rasoriis diuersarum formarum, multarum figurarum: secundum quod praeparatur operationi tuae: proptera, quod rasorium quo raditur dens ab inferiori parte, est aliud a rasorio quo raditur inter dentes, secundum formas alias.	And you know that teeth need various razors of different forms, many figures: according to the way you prepare the operation.</start_of_turn
Et istae formae rasoriorum sint apud te praeparatae, quas uides.	These forms of razors are at your disposal.
¶ De extractione doloris Dentium.	These forms of razors are ready at your disposal.
Caput XXX.	Chapter XXX
Oportet ut cures Dentem a dolore suo cum omni ingenio, et tardes in eradicatione eius.	It is necessary to extract the tooth from its pain with every skill, and to follow this up by eradicating it
Non est enim quod uicem eius suppleat quando eradicatur: quoniam est substantia sublimis: donec quando non est excusatio de eradicatione eius, tunc oportet quando cogitur infirmus eradicare ipsum, ut firmetur, et certificetur apud te dens dolens.	There is nothing that can replace its extraction when it is eradicated: for it is a sublime substance: except when there is no excuse for its eradication, then it is necessary to order the sick man to eradicate it himself, so that it is confirmed, and certified to you that the toothache has ceased
Multotiens enim decipit infirmum dolor, et putat quia est in dente saha et eradicat ipsum: deinde non recedit dolor, donec eradicetur dens infirmus.	Many times the sick man feels the pain and thinks that it is in the tooth and eradicates it: but the pain does not cease until the diseased tooth is eradicated itself
Nos enim iam uidimus illud ex operatione phlebotomatorum.	We do not go about this from the performance of phlebotomies
Cum ergo certificatur apud te dens dolens ipsemet, tunc oportet ut scarifices in circumitu dentis cum spatumili, in quo sit quiddam uirtutis, donec soluatur gingiua ab omni parte: deinde moue ipsum digitis tuis, aut cum forcipibus subtilibus in primis paulatim, donec concutias ipsum.	When it has been certified to you that the toothache itself is present, then it is necessary to make incisions around the tooth with sponges, in which there is some art, until the gums are separated from every part: then move the tooth with your fingers, or with fine forceps at first slowly, until you have severed it
Deinde loca tunc in eo forcipes magnos locatione bona, et caput infirmi inter genua tua: quod iam bene tenuisti, ita quod non moueatur: deinde trahe dentem secundum rectitudinem, ut non frangas ipsum.	Then place the forceps in a good location and grasp the head of the patient between your knees: which you have held firmly, so that it does not move: then draw out the tooth according to its direction, so that you do not break it
Si ergo non egreditur, tunc accipe aliquod illorum instrumentorum, et intromitte ipsum sub eo ab omni parte cum facilitate, et conare motionem eius, sicut fecisti in primis.	If it does not come out, then take some of those instruments and introduce them under it from every part with ease, and make an attempt to move it, as you did at first
Si autem dens est perforatus, aut corrosus: tunc oportet ut impleas illud foramen panno: et stringas ipsum cum extremitate radii subtilis, ut non frangatur in hora constrictionis tuae super ipsum cum forcipibus.	If the tooth is perforated or corroded: then it is necessary to fill the hole with gauze: and tie it with a fine thread, so that it does not break in the hour of your constriction with the forceps
Et oportet, ut exquisite agas cum scarificatione in circumitu gingiuae ab omni parte multum.	It is necessary that the skilled surgeon go round about the circumference of the wound many times with the scalpel.
Et custodi fortitudinem tuam, ut non frangas ipsum, et remaneat pars eius, et redeat super infirmum ex ea malicia quae sit maior dolore eius primo.	Beware lest you break the thing, and leave some of it, and return above the diseased part from the greatest pain which is in it at first
Et caue, ne facias illud quod ignorantes faciunt phlebotomatores in festinatione sua, et audacia ipsorum super eradicationem eius, praeter quod administrent illud quod narrauimus.	Take heed, lest you do that which the unskilled do, like phlebotomists in their pride, and overconfidence concerning its extermination, beyond what we have said.
Multotiens enim faciunt euenire super homines infirmitates magnas, quarum difficiliores sunt ut frangantur, et remaneant radices eius omnes, aut quaedam earum: aut ut extrahant ipsum cum quibusdam ossibus mandibulae: sicut testificati sumus multotiens illud.	Many indeed do this with great men in their sickness, of whom some are difficult to break, and remain with all their roots, or that they extract the whole with some of the jaw-bones: as we have heard from many people
Deinde colluatur post eradicationem eius cum uino, aut cum aceto et sale.	Then it is to be joined after its extermination with wine, or with vinegar and salt
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis ex locis (multotiens enim accidit) tunc tere aliquid ex zegi, et imple cum eo locum: et si non, cauteriza ipsum si non confert tibi zegi.	If blood flows from the place (for many indeed do so), then there is something from the vessel there, and put a pledget there: and if not, cauterize it if it does not suffice to clot the blood
Formae forcipum subtilium quibus mouetur dens in primis, sint longarum extremitatum, breuis manubrii, grossi, ut non duplicentur quando cum eis premitur super dentem: sint sicut uides grossorum manubriorum, donec quando stringis cum eis, non dent seipsas, neque duplicentur: breuium extremitatum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut ex faled decenter facti, directarum extremitatum: et in eorum extremitatibus sint dentes, quorum quidam ingrediantur in quosdam, et stringant constrictione decenti, forti.	The forceps which are used to grasp the tooth in the first place are of subtle form, their handles are long, their thumbs are short, their bodies are thick, so that they do not double up when pressure is put on them when they are pressed against the tooth: they are like the claws of large men, until when they are bound to the tooth, they do not bite themselves, neither do they double up: their thumb is short, and they are made of iron or of lead that has been hollowed out in the middle, their handles are straight, and in their extremities are teeth, some of which are contained in others, and they bind the constriction loosely, firmly
Et quandoque fiunt extremitates sicut forma oris auis quae nominatur ciconia, et sunt fortis constrictionis.	And when the extremities are like the beak of a bird called a ciconia, and are strong constrictions.
¶ De eradicatione Dentium, et extractione ossium mandibularum fractorum.	On the eradication of wisdom teeth, and the extraction of fractured bones of the mandible.
Caput XXXI.	On the eradication of wisdom teeth, and the extraction of fractured bones of the mandible.
Quando remanet apud eradicationem Dentis qui frangitur aliquid, tunc oportet ut ponas super locum cotum cum butyro die uno, aut duobus diebus, donec mollificetur locus: deinde intromitte ad ipsum algasti, aut forcipes: quorum extremitates assimilantur ori auis quae nominatur ciconia.	When remains remain after the eradication of a tooth which has fractured something, then it is necessary to place butter on the place of the fracture for one or two days, until the place is softened: then introduce into the wound, or forceps: the extremities of which absorb the origin of the pain which is called ciconia.
Forma autem haec est forcipum.	The form of these forceps is as follows.
Sint extremitates eorum factae sicut lima deintus: aut sicut aliskilfegi.	The extremities of these forceps are made like a file, or like an awl
Si ergo non obedit tibi ad exitum cum istis forcipibus, tunc oportet, ut caues super radicem, et detegas carnem totam, et intromittas instrumentum quod nominatur Palanca parua, cuius forma est haec.	If therefore these forceps do not suffice for the extraction with these teeth, then it is necessary to place the forceps above the root, and to remove the whole flesh, and to introduce the small hook, which is called Palanca, whose form is as follows
Sit breuis extremitatis, grossae parumper: et non sit imbibitum, ut non frangatur.	Its short handle and large head: and it is not bent, so that it does not break
Si ergo egreditur radix per illud, est bonum: et si non, iuuare oportet cum istis instrumentis aliis quorum formae sunt istae.	If therefore the root comes out through that, it is good: and if not, it is necessary to pull with other instruments whose form is like these
Forma primi triangulatae extremitatis, in qua est quaedam grossitudo.	The first triangular-shaped extremity, in which there is some thickness
Forma triangulatae extremitatis subtilis.	The second triangular-shaped extremity is thin
Etiam iuuatur cum hoc instrumento habente duos ramos, cuius haec est forma.	It is also used with this instrument which has two branches, whose form is as follows
Et cum aliis instrumentis et ferramentis quae praecesserunt in rasione dentium.	And with other instruments and materials which are necessary in the case of teeth.
Etiam sit iuuamentum cum hoc instrumento quod assimilatur uncino magno, huius formae, triangulatae extremitatis tortae, in qua est quiddam grossitudinis, ut non frangatur: et sit non imbibitum.	It is also necessary to grasp with this instrument which absorbs a large stone, of this form, triangular-shaped extremity twisted, in which there is some thickness, so that it does not break: and it is not bent
Et scias, quod instrumenta dentium sunt multa: et similiter reliqua instrumenta non computantur, et artifex prudens, subtilis in arte sua inuenit per se ipsum instrumentum, secundum quod significant ei operatio et aegritudines ipsae.	And know this, that the instruments for teeth are many: and like all other instruments, they do not work alike. And a skilled artificer, experienced in his art, discovers for himself the appropriate instrument for each operation and each ailment.
Quoniam ex agritudinibus sunt ad quas non dixerunt antiqui instrumentum, propter diuersitatem specierum earum.	For indeed, from the ailments for which the ancients did not speak of an instrument, because of the variety of their kinds.
Si autem frangatur os ex mandibula, aut ex aliis ossibus oris, aut putrefit: tunc perscrutare super ipsum in loco suo cum eo quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis et forcipibus quae dixi in extractione radicum, et iuuare cum gesti, cuius forma est haec.	If, however, the jawbone be fractured from the mandible, or from any other bone of the mouth, or putrefy: then he must consider concerning himself with the thing itself in its place with that which is suitable for it among the instruments and forceps which I mentioned in the extraction of roots, and to handle it with his hands, whose form is like this
Sit in eo quiddam grossitudinis paulatim, ut stringatur, uel teneatur cum eo os, et non fugiat et uadat, donec egrediatur os: et restaura locum cum medicinis conuenientibus ad illud.	So be it of some measure that it may be stretched out, or held with it against the bone, and not flee and wander, until the bone is extracted: and restore the place with the physicians who are accustomed to this.
Si autem in osse est putredo parua, tunc rade ipsum a putredine sua, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	If, however, there is a little pus in the bone, then remove the pus from it, and care for it, until it is healed.
De serratura Dentium eminentium super alios.	Concerning the closure of teeth which are prominent over others.
Caput XXXII.	Chapter 2.
Quando Dentes eminent non secundum cursum suum naturalem, foeda fit per illud forma: et praecipue quando accidit illud in mulieribus, et puellis, scilicet uenalibus.	When teeth protrude not according to their natural course, an ulcer forms by that shape: and especially when it happens in women and girls, since it is in their gums
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	Therefore he must consider concerning himself with it
Nam si dens est natus post dentem alium, et non locatur, uel est possibilis eius serratura, neque limatura ipsius: tunc eradica ipsum: et si est annexus cum dente alio, tunc incide ipsum cum isto instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	Because if a tooth has been born after another tooth, and is not placed, or if it is possible to suture it, or to file it down: then extract it: and if it is joined to another tooth, then cut it with this instrument, whose form is like this
Est simile rostro paruo, et fit ex ferro indo, acutae extremitatis ualde.	It is like a small face, made of iron, with a sharp edge at the end
Et sit incisio tua qua ipsum incidis in diebus multis, et propter duriciem dentis, et ut non commoueatur alius ex dentibus.	And let your incision be such as that which you make on many days, because of the hardness of the tooth, and that it does not damage any other tooth.
Si autem est eminens expositus limaturae suae: tunc lima ipsum cum lima ex indo, cuius forma est haec.	If however the exposed edge of the lamina be imminent: then file that with a file of the same shape as that
Sit totum ex indo, et manubrium eius minutorum punctorum ualdae, sicut lima cum qua fiunt acus: cum quo limetur dens paulatim in diebus multis cum facilitate, ut non commoueatur dens, et cadat: deinde leni ipsum, in fine rade ipsum cum quibusdam rasoriis.	And let the whole of the handle of the file be minor than the points of the nails, in such manner as a file is to an awl: so that the tooth may be ground away gradually in many days with ease, without damaging the tooth, and falling out: then afterwards smooth it, at the end sharpen it with some rasps.
Quod si est dens, ex quo frangatur pars, et laedit linguam: tunc oportet ut limes eum etiam, donec auferatur asperitas illius fractionis, et aequetur: et applanetur, et non laedat linguam, neque corrumpat sermonem.	And if there be a tooth from which a part has broken off, and which is causing pain of the tongue: then it is necessary to file it also until the asperity of that fracture has been removed, and it has been made even: and it must be flattened, and does not cause pain, neither does it corrupt speech
¶ De retatione Dentium cum filis auri.	Of the reposition of a tooth with files.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter 33.
Quando accidit Dentibus anterioribus concussio et commotio a percussione, aut casu: et non potest infirmus stringere super illud quod comedit ut non cadat: et curasti eos cum medicinis stipticis, et non ualuit curatio: tunc ingenium in eis est, ut stringantur cum filo auri: quoniam argentum fit uiride, et putrefit post dies: sed aurum nunquam mutatur.	When it happens that the front teeth are fractured and displaced by percussion, or in a case: and it is not possible to hold them together because of their discomfort: then it is necessary to support them with gold wire: for silver is too soft, and it putrefies after a few days: but gold never changes.
Et sit filum medium in subtilitate et grossicie secundum quantitatem quod capiat inter Dentes.	And let the wire be of medium thickness and breadth according to the quantity that it can grasp between the teeth.
Et forma quidem retationis est, ut accipias filum, et intromittas duplum eius inter duos dentes sanos: deinde texeas cum duabus extremitatibus fili inter dentes motos, siue unus sit, aut plures, donec peruenias cum tela usque ad dentem sanum alterius partis.	And the form of the reposition is that you take hold of the wire, and pass its double between two healthy teeth: then you shall weave it with two extremities of the wire between the moving teeth, whether one or more, until you have reached the healthy tooth of the other side
Deinde itera texturam usque ad partem a qua incaepisti: et stringe manum tuam cum subtilitate et sapientia, donec non remoueatur prorsus: et sit constrictio tua qua stringis filum, apud radices dentium, ut non euadat.	Then again, repeat the manipulation until you reach the part from which you commenced: and bind your hand with skill and wisdom until it ceases to move forward: and let your constriction be such as that it binds the thread at the roots of the teeth, so that it does not slip away.
Deinde incide extremitates fili superfluentes cum forficibus: et aggrega utrumque, et conuerte eas cum gesti: et occulta ipsas inter dentem sanum et dentem motum, ut non laedat linguam: deinde dimittatur ita strictum dum remanet.	Then again, cut away the excess thread with scissors: and gather up both together, and bind them together with the thumb: and hide them between the sound tooth and the moved tooth, so that it does not irritate the tongue: then let go of the tension when it remains.
Si autem soluitur, aut inciditur, stringe eos cum filo alio, et stabit cum eo taliter tempore toto.	If, however, it dissolves or breaks, bind it with another thread, and hold it in such a way as to keep it firm throughout the whole time
Et haec est forma Dentium, et figura retationis duorum dentium sanorum, et duorum dentium motorum, sicut uides.	This is the form of teeth, and the figure of the rotation of two sound teeth and two moved teeth, like those of water
Et quandoque fit, ut redeat dens unus, aut duo post casum urriusque in locis suis, et retentur sicut narrauimus, et remaneant: et non facit illud nisi artifex, prudens, et expertus.	And when it happens that one tooth, or two after a fall and swelling in their places, returns as we have said, and remains: this does not happen except by a skillful, wise, and experienced artist.
Et quandoque aptatur aliquod ex ossibus uaccinis: et fit ex eo sicut forma dentis, et ponitur in loco, ex quo munitur dens et stringitur, sicut diximus: et remanet, et seruitur cum eo tempore longo.	And when some piece of bone or flesh has become loose: and it becomes like a tooth in shape, and is placed in its place, from which the tooth has been loosened and bound: it remains, and serves for a long time
¶ De incisione ligamenti quod accidit sub lingua, et prohibet loquelam.	Of the incision of the ligament which happens under the tongue, and which hinders speech
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter XXXIV.
Quandoque ligamentum hoc quod accidit sub lingua, est aut naturale, cum quo nascitur homo, aut accidentale, a uulnere quod iam consolidatum est.	When this ligament which happens under the tongue is severed, it is either natural, as it is in the birth of a man, or accidental, from an injury which has hardened.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi in capite eius in sinu tuo, et eleua linguam eius: deinde incide illud ligamentum neruosum per latitudinem, donec soluatur lingua a retentione sua.	And the operation in this is that you open the jaw of the patient in your hand, and lift up his tongue: then cut through that nerve of the ligament throughout its breadth, until the tongue is freed from its retention.
Quod si in eo fuerit quiddam duriciei et nodationis, et fuerit illud ex consolidatione uulneris: tunc proiice in illud uncinum, et finde illud per latitudinem, donec incidas ligamentum, et soluatur nodatio.	If there be in that any hardness and swelling, and if that be from consolidation of the wound: then thrust into that the hook, and find that by its breadth, until you cut the ligament, and it shall be dissolved.
Et caue, ne sit fissura in profundo carnis, et incidas arteriam illic, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Take heed, that there be no deep wound, and cut the artery there, and blood flow shall be restored.
Deinde colluatur in uestigio incisionis cum aqua rosata, aut cum aceto, aut aqua frigida.	Then it shall be bound up in the vicinity of the incision with rosewater, or vinegar, or cold water.
Deinde pone sub lingua licinium ex lino, quod teneat infirmus in omni nocte: ut non consolidetur secundo.	Then place under the tongue a piece of linen, which shall hold the patient at night: that he may not consolidate the second time
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc pone super locum zegi tritum.	But if blood flow be restored, then place over the place a piece of torn sponge.
Si uero uincit te sanguis, tunc cauteriza locum cum cauterio lentiginoso, quod conuenit ad illud: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	If blood spurts, then burn the place with a sponge cautery, which is suitable for that: then care for the place with the rest of the treatment, until it be healed
¶ De extractione Ranulae quae fit sub lingua.	On the extraction of a ranula which is under the tongue.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter 5.
Quandoque accidit sub lingua apostema quod assimilatur Ranae paruae, prohibens linguam ab operatione sua naturali: et fortasse magnificatur adeo, donec implet os.	When there occurs under the tongue a swelling which assimilates the small ranula, preventing the tongue from its natural operation: and perhaps it increases so much, that it fills the mouth.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi coram sole: et considera apostema.	The operation in this is, that you open the mouth of the patient before the sun: and consider the swelling.
Si ergo uides ipsum fusci coloris, aut nigri, durum, cui non inuenit infirmus sensum: tunc non tangas ipsum, quoniam est cancer.	If therefore you see that it is of a yellow or black color, hard, which does not cause the patient any pain: then do not touch it, because it is cancer
Et si est decliue ad albedinem, in quo est humiditas, tunc proiice in ipsum uncinum, et incide ipsum cum spatumili subtili, et libera ipsum ab omni parte.	And if it inclines towards whiteness, in which there is moisture: then thrust into it the hook, and cut it with a fine knife, and free it from all parts
Quod si uincit te sanguis in hora tuae operationis, tunc pone super ipsum zegi tritum, donec abscindatur sanguis: deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec extrahas ipsum cum complemento eius.	If blood flows upon thee in the hour of thy operation, then place upon it a dry sponge, until the blood is separated: afterwards return to thy operation, until thou hast extracted it with its complement.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto et sale: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then apply vinegar and salt: and care for the rest with such treatment as is convenient for that, until he is healed.
¶ De curatione apostematis duarum Amigdalarum.	Concerning the treatment of the two wounds of the amygdalae.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter 6.
Quandoque accidunt inter guttur godad, id est, glandulae, quae similantur algodad, quae accidunt deforis: et nominantur duae Amigdalae: quas quando curas cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non sanantur, tunc considera.	When wounds happen between the gullet and the gods, that is, the glands which are like almonds, which happen outside: and which are called two amygdalae: when you cure them with what we said in the explanation, and they do not heal, then consider them
Si ergo est apostema durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro.	If there is a hard wound, of a brown color, with little sensation: then do not touch it with iron
Et si est rubei coloris, et radix eius est grossa: tunc non tangas ipsum etiam cum ferro, timens fluxum sanguinis, imo dimitte ipsum, donec maturetur.	And if it is red and its root is large: then do not touch it even with iron, fearing the flow of blood, rather leave it alone, until it is healed
Et tunc aut perforabis ipsum: aut rumpetur per se.	And then either perforate it or rupture it by itself.
Et si est albi coloris, rotundum, et est radix eius subtilis: tunc oportet ipsum incidi.	And if it is white in color, round, and its root is slight: then you must cut it open.
Et operatio in ipso est, ut consideres ante operationem suam, si quieuit apostema eius calidum quiete completum, aut imminuitur quadam diminutione: tunc ergo fac sedere infirmum coram sole, et caput eius sit in sinu tuo: et aperi os eius, et accipiat seruiens inter manus suas, et premat linguam eius inferius cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	And the operation in this is as you consider before your operation, if the wound has cooled completely and is complete, or if it is threatening some reduction: then do this make the patient sit facing the sun, and place his head in your lap: and open his mouth, and take out the saliva between your hands, and pull down his tongue with an instrument, which has this shape.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere, quod sit subtile sicut cultellus.	Do this with silver, or with air, which is subtle like a knife
Cum ergo premis cum eo linguam, et ostenditur tibi apostema, et cadit super ipsum uisus tuus: tunc accipe uncinum, et fige ipsum in amigdalam, et extrahe eam ad exteriora quantum potes, praeter quod trahas cum ea aliquid ex tunicis.	When the language is spoken and the limb is exposed, and it falls upon the object of your care: then grasp the hook and fix it to the bone, and draw it out to the exterior as much as possible, without tearing anything from the skin.
Deinde incide eam cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma quae sequitur.	Then incision is made with the instrument whose form follows this.
Assimilatur forficibus: uerumtamen extremitates eius sint curuatae, ita quod orificium cuiusque earum est in directo alterius acute: unde cura ut sit ex ferro indo, aut alfuled imbibitum.	Like scissors: truly the extremities of these are curved, so that the opening of each is directly opposite the other at an angle: care must be taken that it be firm, or blood-soaked.
Si autem non est praesens hoc instrumentum, tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili, cuius haec est forma.	If this instrument is not present, incision is made with a sponge, whose form is like this
Sit acutum a parte una, non acutum a parte altera.	Acute from one side, not from the other side.</start_of_turn>
Et postquam incidis amigdalam unam, incide alteram secundum hanc eandem speciem incisionis.	And after you have incisions on one side, make the other side according to this same kind of incision.</start_of_turn>
Deinde post incisionem gargarizet infirmus cum aqua frigida, aut cum aceto et aqua.	Then after the incision the patient will be gargled with cold water, or with vinegar and water.</start_of_turn
Si autem accidat ei fluxus sanguinis, gargarizet cum aqua in qua bulliti sunt cortices granatorum: aut folia myrti, et similia illis ex stipticis, donec abscindatur fluxus sanguinis: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	If however blood flows from it, gargle with water in which coriander seeds are boiled: or leaves of myrtle, and things like these from sponges: until the bleeding stops: then care for it until it heals.</start_of_turn>
Et quandoque nascuntur in gutture apostemata alia, praeter amigdalas duas.	And when there appear in the throat other abscesses, besides the two tonsils.</start_of_turn
Incide ergo ea secundum quod dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum aequaliter.	Incision is made for these like that which I said concerning the incision of the two tonsils equally.</start_of_turn
Et ego quidem iam medicatus fui mulierem ex apostemate, quod natum erat inter guttur eius, quod trahebat ad fuscedinem, pauci sensus, quod iam fere clauserat guttur: et mulier respirabat a meatu stricto, et iam prohibuerat ei comestionem, et potum aquae: et iam peruenerat ad mortem, si remansisset uno die, aut duobus diebus.	And I myself was a physician for a woman who had an abscess in her throat, which was born between her ribs, which was dragging down, little sense, because she was almost suffocating: and the woman was breathing from a narrow passage, and I forbade her from eating and drinking: and she died within one or two days.</start_of_turn>
Et apostema tantum ascenderat, quod emiserat duos ramos, donec exierant super duo foramina nasi.	The swelling will thus ascend as far as it emitted two branches, until it passes beyond the two nostrils.
Properaui ergo festinanter, et fixi in unum eorum uncinum.	The swelling will thus ascend as far as it emitted two branches, until it passes beyond the two nostrils.
Deinde traxi ipsum, et tracta ex eo est portio magna.	Then draw out the rest, and from that part is the greater portion
Deinde abscidi eam, ubi comprehendi ex foramine nasi.	Then cut away that which is within the nostrils
Deinde feci illud ei quod processit ex foramine nasi altero.	Then do the like with the other nostril
Deinde aperui os eius, et pressi linguam eius: et postea fixi uncinum in ipsum apostema: deinde abscidi ex eo partem eius, et non cucurrit ex eo nisi sanguis paucus: absolutum est ergo guttur mulieris, et incepit statim bibere aquam, deinde accepit ex cibo.	Then open its mouth, and press down its tongue: and afterwards fix the tissue to that swelling: then cut away from that part a portion of it, and no blood will issue from that. Absolutely, therefore, is the woman's throat, and she immediately drinks water, and then takes food.
Non ergo cessaui incidere ex illo apostemate multotiens tempore longo: et apostema succedebat loco eius quod incidebam, donec prolongatum est nimis et cum ea illud.	It is not necessary to cut away from that swelling many times for a long time: and the swelling will come back to the place from which it was cut, until it is prolonged and with it.
Ingeniaui ergo, et cauterizaui apostema inter guttur.	I devised therefore, and cauterized the swelling between the throat.
Stetit ergo ab additione: deinde ambulaui a parte, et non sciui quid fecit Deus cum ea post me.	It stood still from the addition: then I went away from that part, and I do not know what God did with her after me
¶ De incisione apostematis uuulae.	Of the incision of the swelling of the nose.
Caput XXXVII.	Chapter 7.
Quando descendit catarrus ad uuulam, et apostematur, et est long: tunc ipsa nominatur perpendicularis: et si est in inferiori parte grossa, rotunda, tunc ipsa nominatur uua.	When the catarrus descends to the nose, and swells, and is long: then it is called perpendicular: and if it is in the lower part large, round, then it is called double
Quando curatur cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: et uides quod apostema calidum quieuit ab ea, et est subtilis: tunc oportet ut incidas eam.	When it is cured with that which we said in the enumeration, and the cure does not suffice: and you see that the swelling is softened from it, and is slight: then it is necessary to cut away from it
Et quae ex ea est aggregata rotunda, et non est ei longitudo, et est sanguinea, aut fusci coloris, aut nigri, et non est ei sensus: tunc oportet ut deuites incisionem eius.	And whatever is aggregated in a round shape, which has no length, is either blood, or of a tawny or black colour, and has no sensation: in such a case it is necessary to make an incision in it.
In ea enim est timor super infirmum.	And there is fear of the disease on account of the sick person.
Oportet ergo quando uides eam secundum modum quem dixi ex albedine, et longitudine sua, ut facias sedere infirmum coram sole: et premas linguam eius cum instrumento, cuius praecessit narratio: deinde fige uncinum in uuam, et trahe eam inferius: et incide eam cum uno duorum instrumentorum quae dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum.	It is necessary therefore when you are treating the patient as I have said from the white and the black, and of its length, so that you make the patient sit with his face towards the sun: and you take hold of his tongue with an instrument of which I have spoken before: then you fix the flesh in one place, and draw out the bowels: and you cut through the bowels with one of the two instruments which I have mentioned in the incision of two armpits.
Et oportet ut non incidas ex ea, nisi illud quod additur super naturalem terminum sine additione.	And it is necessary that you do not cut through from that except that which is added beyond the natural limit without addition
Nam si tu incidis ex ea plus, laedes uocem et sermonem.	For if you cut through from that more, you will wound the bowels and the speech.
Deinde post incisionem utere eo quod narrauimus in incisione duarum amigdalarum: et cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then after the incision make use of what we have spoken of in the incision of two armpits: and take care of the bowels until they are healed.
Si autem terretur infirmus ab incisione: tunc oportet ut utaris ingenio in cauterizatione eius absque timore et pauore.	If however the patient returns from the incision: then it is necessary that you use your skill in cauterizing it without fear and without hesitation.
Et modus cauterii in ea non est, nisi cum aqua acuta: et est, ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	And the method of cauterizing in these is not except with acute water: and it is that you place the head of the patient in your lap.
Deinde preme linguam eius cum instrumento quod diximus.	Then take hold of his tongue with the instrument which we have mentioned.
Deinde accipe ex aqua quam dixi tibi in capitulo cauterizandi, et confice cum ea calcem non extinctam, et pone eam non spissam, neque subtilem, et imple ex ea concauitatem huius instrumenti, cuius haec est forma.	Then take from the water which I have mentioned above and mix it with charcoal not burnt out, and put it not thick nor thin, and bring from that the cavity of this instrument which has this shape
Sit extremitati eius in qua ponitur medicina concauitas, sicut concauitas cochlearis radii.	The extremities of it on which the medicine is placed are like the concavity of the cochlea of a radius
Et pone instrumentum cum medicina super uuulam ipsam: et infirmus sit iacens super latus suum, ut currat saliua ex ore eius ex intrinseca medicina, ut non descendat ex ea ad guttur ipsius aliquid, et laedat ipsum.	Place the instrument with the medicine above the limb itself: and let the patient lie upon his side, so that the moisture from his mouth may flow outwards from the medicine inwards, and not descend downwards into his gut, and thereby cause him pain.
Deinde tene manum tuam cum medicina.	Hold your hand with the medicine.
Et tu ex primas eam super uuulam quantitate medietatis horae, donec uideas eam iam denigratam, et sedatam mordicationem medicinae.	And you from the first touch over the limb for the quantity of half an hour, until you see it is softened, and seat the biting of the medicine.
Et si uis ut accipias cotum, et inuoluas ipsum super extremitatem radii, et infundas cotum cum medicina, et intromittas radium cum coto in cannulam desuper, donec adhaereat cotum super uuulam.	And if you wish to grasp the limb, and cover it with the medicine at its extremity, and inflate the limb with the medicine, and insert the finger with the coat into the canal above, until the coat adheres to the limb itself
Fac illud multotiens, donec consequaris quod uis de cauterizatione uuae.	Do this often, until you achieve what you desire of the cauterization of the limb
Deinde dimitte eam: ipsa namque arescit et cadit post tres dies, aut quatuor.	And then remove the medicine: for it itself will dry up and fall off in three days, or four.
Quod si indiges ut iteres medicinam, itera ipsam: et post cauterizationem absterge in circumitu uuae cum coto imbibito in butyro, et mundifica cum eo quod est in circumitu eius ex medicina: et colluatur cum aqua frigida.	If you find that the medicine has not taken hold, repeat it: and after the cauterization, remove the surrounding parts of the limb with the coat, and moisten with butter, and anoint with oil what is around it from the medicine: and cool it with cold water
Et curetur extrinsecus cum embrocis, et deintus cum gargarismis, donec sanetur.	And care for the outside with bandages, and for the inside with gargling, until it is healed
Haec ergo species curationis est salubrior incisione et longinquior a timore.	Thus this kind of treatment is more beneficial than incision and is longer lasting in respect of fear
Et quandoque curatur uuula etiam cum eo quod est subtilius quam cauterium et incisio: curatur enim cum suffumigatione, secundum hunc modum.	And when the limb is healed even with this, which is more subtle than cauterization and incision: it is healed by fumigation, in this manner.
Sume calamentum, et hyssopum, et origanum, et rutam, et sseah, et chamomillam, et abrotanum, et similia eis ex herbis: et aggrega ea omnia, aut quaedam eorum in olla, et submergantur cum aceto, et bulliant: et olla sit lutata cum luto decenter: et sit in medio ollae foramen, super quod componatur instrumentum concauum secundum hunc modum.	Take calamine, and hyssop, and origanum, and rue, and sage, and chamomile, and chamomile flower, and such like herbs: and mix them all together, or some of them in a pot, and immerse them in vinegar, and boil: and put a hole in the middle of the pot, over which is placed a concave instrument according to this manner.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere: et intromittatur extremitas, in qua est granatum, in os infirmi, donec ascendat uapor ad uuulam super cannulam, donec obscuretur uuula multum.	Let air or metal go: and introduce the extremity, in which is the pomegranate, into the bone of the patient, until the vapor rises up to the upper cannula, until the upper part is obscured much.
Deinde itera super ipsam multotiens, donec arescat.	Then repeat over the latter several times, until it heals.</start_of_turn>
Et caue, ne facias hanc curationem in principio aduentus apostematis.	And be careful, do not perform this treatment at the beginning of an abscess.</start_of_turn>
Plaerumque enim addit in apostemate: et non oportet ut facias illud nisi apud declinationem apostematis eius calidi.	It is useful indeed to add in the abscess: and it is not necessary that you do this except when the abscess is cold.</start_of_turn>
Si autem non est praesens tibi hoc instrumentum, tunc accipe cannam, et compone in extremitate eius corticem oui: ut non comburatur os infirmi: quoniam cortex oui prohibet uaporem comburere os: et haec est ex bona curatione cum salute.	If however this instrument is not present with you, then take a needle and fashion in its extremity a piece of cork or resin: so that it does not burn the bone of the patient: because the cork or resin hinders the vapor from burning the bone: and this is from a good treatment with safety.</start_of_turn>
¶ De extractione spinarum, et ossium de gula.	About the extraction of thorns, and bones from the jaw.</start_of_turn
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter XXXVIII.</start_of_turn>
Multotiens adhaeret in gutture os, aut spina piscis, aut aliud.	Many things adhere to the gut of the bone, or a fish spine, or something else.</start_of_turn
Oportet ergo ut extrahas quod ex eis est apparens super quod cadit uisus, postquam premis linguam cum instrumento apud solem, et declaratur tibi quod est in gutture.	It is necessary therefore that you extract what appears from the gut when the tongue is pressed with the instrument at the edge, and that you declare that it is in the gut.</start_of_turn
Et quod non apparet tibi et occultatur in gutture, oportet ut facias uomere infirmum antequam digeratur cibus in stomacho.	And what is not apparent to you and is hidden in the gut, you must make the patient vomit before the food is digested in the stomach.</start_of_turn
Fortasse enim egredietur res annexa per uomitum.	Perhaps therefore the attached thing will go out by vomiting.</start_of_turn
Aut deglutiat infirmus frustum napi, aut radicem lactucae, aut deglutiat buccellam panis sicci: aut accipiat frustum spongiae marinae siccae lenis: et liga ipsum in filo, deinde deglutiat ipsum.	Or the patient may swallow down a piece of barley chaff, or a radix of lettuce, or swallow down a dry piece of bread, or take up a piece of dry sea sponge: and bind it up in a thread, then swallow it down.</start_of_turn
Cum ergo peruenit ad locum ubi sunt spinae, aut os, et extrahitur, tunc egreditur.	When the limb approaches the place where bones or spines are found, and is drawn out, it then emerges.
Si ergo non egreditur cum eo quod diximus: tunc utere instrumento ex plumbo secundum hanc formam.	If it does not emerge with it as we have said: then use an instrument of lead according to this shape.
Sit grossius quam Radius parumper, et in extremitate eius sit curuitas, quam intromittat in guttur suum cum facilitate: et ipse habeat caput suum eleuatum sursum.	Let it be thicker than a radius and smaller than a barleycorn, and have a curve at its extremity which projects into its guttur with ease: and let it have its head elevated above.
Et caueat a tactu suae epiglotis, ut non accidat ei tussis, et impellat cum eo os, aut spinam, aut intromittat ipsum medicus manu sua.	And beware of its touch on the epiglottis, that it does not cause it to swell, and drive out with it bone, spine, or bring the physician's hand forward
Verum quod infirmus intromittat, hoc est melius: propter scientiam suam de loco rei annexae: et impellat inferius, aut trahat manum suam cum instrumento sursum, totum illud secundum quantitatem quae praeparatur ei, donec egrediatur.	But that the sick person brings it forward, this is better: because of his knowledge of the place of the annexed thing: and drives downwards, or draws his hand upwards with the instrument above, all this according to the quantity which is prepared for him, until it emerges
¶ De extractione Sanguisugae.	Of the extraction of the blood-sucker.</start_of_turn>
Caput XXXIX.	Chapter XXXIX.</start_of_turn>
Quando medicatur sanguisuga cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex curatione cum medicinis, et non confert, tunc considera in gutture infirmi coram sole, siue apud solem postquam premis linguam eius cum instrumento quod narraui tibi.	When the physician treats the blood-sucker with that which I mentioned in the treatise on treatment with the physicians, and it does not yield, then consider in the guttur of the patient in front of the sun, or behind the tongue after having drawn out its tongue with the instrument which I mentioned.</start_of_turn>
Si ergo cadit uisus tuus super sanguisugam, extrahe eam cum uncino paruo, aut cum gesti subtilibus decenter.	If therefore your hand slips over the blood-sucker, draw it out with a small hook, or with fine fingers detached from each other.</start_of_turn
Quod si non est possibile cum eis: tunc accipe cannulam concauam, et intromitte eam in guttur infirmi usque prope guttur: deinde intromitte in concauitatem cannulae ferrum ignitum cum igne.	If this is not possible with these means: then take a curved needle, and insert it into the guttur of the patient almost to the guttur: then insert the burning iron into the curve of the needle.</start_of_turn
Fac illud multotiens: et abstineat infirmus ab aqua tota die.	Do this often: and let the patient abstain from all water throughout the day.
Deinde accipiat uitreatam plenam aqua frigida, et aperiat os eius in ea: et colluat os suum cum ea, et non deglutiat ex ea aliquid: et moueat aquam una hora post aliam cum manu sua.	Then he shall take a full treatment of cold water, and open his mouth with it: and he shall gather his teeth with it, and let him not swallow anything from it: and he shall drink water once an hour after each meal with his hand
Sanguisuga enim ilico cum sentit aquam cadit.	When he feels that blood is coming from his mouth with the water.
Si autem non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc suffumiga infirmum cum cimicibus, aut cum asa cum instrumento quod narraui in suffumigatione uuulae.	But if it does not go away when we have told you, then fumigate the patient with vinegar, or with alum as an instrument of fumigation for the wound
Fac illud multotiens, quoniam ipsa cadet.	Do this often, for it will go away by itself.
Et modus operationis in suffumigatione est, ut accipias ollam, in qua sint prunae uiuae cum igne: et olla sit cooperta cum coopertorio, in cuius medio sit foramen: et componatur in illo foramine extremitas instrumenti.	And the mode of operation in fumigation is that you take a vessel in which are dates with fire: and the vessel be covered with a cover, in the middle of which is a hole: and make in that hole the extremity of the instrument.</start_of_turn>
Deinde proiice suffumigationem, et ponat infirmus os suum in extremitate cannulae, et claudat os suum, ut non egrediatur suffumigatio, donec scias quod suffumigatio iam peruenit ad sanguisugam.	Then throw the fumigation and put the patient's mouth in the extremity of the tube, and close the mouth, so that it does not escape the fumigation, until you know that the fumigation has passed to the bleeding.</start_of_turn>
Nam sanguisuga statim cadet.	For bleeding stops immediately.</start_of_turn>
Quod si non cadit, tunc itera suffumigationem multotiens.	If it does not go away, do the fumigation often.</start_of_turn
Et toleret infirmus sitim, et comedat salsa, et allia, et non bibat aquam.	And the patient can tolerate sitting, and eat garlic and onions, and does not drink water.</start_of_turn
Necesse est ergo ut egrediatur cum hoc regimine.	It is necessary therefore that he should go out with this regimen.</start_of_turn
Et haec est forma instrumenti cum quo extrahitur sanguisuga ex gutture, quando cadit super ipsam uisus.	And this is the form of the instrument with which blood is extracted from the gut when it falls upon the vomit.</start_of_turn
Est simile forcipibus, sicut uides: nisi quia est ei haee curuitas quae intromittitur ad guttur.	It is like pincers, thus also liquids: except that it has a curvature which enters the gut.
Et extremitas eius similis ori auis quae nominatur ciconia, in quo est asperitas limae: quando comprehendit aliquid, non dimittit ipsum omnino.	Its extremities are like the beak of a heron which is called ciconia, in which there is a roughness of lime: when it grasps something, it does not relinquish it entirely.
¶ De apertione Apostematum, et eorum sectione, et cura in genere.	About the opening of the rectum, and its section, and care in general.
Caput XL.	Chapter 40.</start_of_turn>
Apostematum species sunt multae, multorum modorum, secundum quod uenit rememoratio eorum, scilicet unius, et unius in hoc libro: et sunt diuersae in perforatione eorum, et sectione ipsorum ex duobus modis.	There are many kinds of rectum, of various methods, according as the nature of the case reminds us: and they are diverse in their perforation and their section into two methods.
Quorum unus est ex specie apostematis in seipso, et eo quod comprehendit ex humiditatibus.	One of them is the kind of rectum which comprehends humours.</start_of_turn>
Et modus secundus est propter loca, in quibus accidit ex corpore.	The other is on account of the place where it happens to the body.</start_of_turn
Quoniam apostema accidens in capite, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in ano: et apostema accidens in loco carnoso, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in iuncturis: et unicuique eorum est iudicium suum ex operatione.	Because the rectum happens at the head is different from the rectum which happens in the belly: and the rectum which happens in a fleshy place is different from the rectum which happens at the joints: and each one of them has its own judgement according to the operation.</start_of_turn
Et ex apostematibus sunt quae non oportet ut perforentur, nisi post maturationem saniei in eis, et complementum eius: et ex eis sunt, quae oportet ut perforentur, dum sunt cruda, et non maturantur secundum complementum.	There are those which do not require perforation of the rectum except after the completion of health in youth, and its complement: and there are those which require perforation while they are raw and have not matured according to the complement.</start_of_turn
Sicut apostemata quae sunt propinqua iuncturis.	Like the rectum which is close to the joints.</start_of_turn
Quoniam apostema quando accidit prope iuncturam, et prolongatur esse eius, donec putrefit quod est in circumitu eius fortasse corrumpuntur ligamenta, aut nerui illius iuncturae: quare est caussa propior contractionis illius membri.	For the rectum when it happens near the joint, and extends itself, until it putrefies which is in its circumference perhaps the ligaments or the nerves of that joint are ruptured: which is the cause of the closer contraction of that limb.</start_of_turn
Aut est apostema apud membrum principale: quoniam si tu tardas perforationem eius, donec maturetur, nocebit uel illi, uel per illud membro principali.	The abscess is near the main limb: for if you delay its perforation until it matures, it will cause either a swelling or an infection in that main limb.
Aut est prope anum, perfora ergo ipsum immaturum: et non oportet, ut perfores, apostema crudum, non completae digestionis, nisi quod est prope anum, ut non putrefiat profundum, et longetur ad interiora ani, et fiat fistula, aut fiat in termino eius quod non sanatur.	The abscess is close to the limb: for if you perforate it while it is immature, it must not be left without completing its digestion, except when it is close to the limb, lest it should putrefy deeply, and reach the interior of the limb, and form a fistula, or remain unhealed at its end
Oportet ut scias horam perforationis apostematis, quod maturatum est secundum complementum: et est apud sedationem doloris, recessionem febris, et diminutionem rubedinis, et pulsationis, et acuitatem capitis apostematis: et reliqua signa.	You must know the time of perforation of the abscess, for it is matured according to the completion of its digestion: and it is with the cessation of pain, lowering of fever, and diminishing of redness, and pulse, and the sharpness of the head of the abscess: and the rest of the signs.
Et oportet, ut facias eandem perforationem in inferiori loco apostematis, et uehementioris eminentiae: et sit perforatio uadens in longitudine corporis, si apostemata sunt in partibus manuum et pedum, et locis lacertorum, et chordarum, et neruorum, et arteriarum, et ad ultimum in omnibus locis aequalibus, quibus non est reflexio.	You must make the perforation in a lower place of the abscess, and more cautiously: and let the perforation be wide in length of the body, if the abscesses are in the parts of the hands and feet, and the places of lacerations, and strings, and nerves, and arteries, and finally in all the places which have no reflection
In illis autem quae reflectuntur, uade cum perforatione secundum illud membrum.	But in those which reflect, be cautious with the perforation according to that limb.
Quando uero apostema est in locis carnosis: tunc melius est ut dimittas perforationem eius, donec confirmetur eius digestio, sicut diximus secundum complementum.	When indeed the abscess is in a place of hardness: then it is better to omit the perforation of it until its digestion is confirmed, as we have said according to completion
Quoniam si tu perforas ipsum ante illud, prolongatur cursus uirus ex eo, et est multae sordis et sordiciei, et fortasse indurantur labia eius, et profunditas eius.	For if you perforate it before that, you prolong the course of the infection from that, and there is much pus and discharge, and perhaps swelling of its lip, and depth of it.
Et quaedam apostemata perforantur secundum latitudinem corporis apud necessitatem: aut secundum illud quo indiget membrum.	And some abscesses are perforated according to the width of the body for necessity: or according to that which the limb requires.
Et oportet, ut administres in apostematibus paruis perforationem paruam, et in apostematibus magnis perforationem amplam: aut sectiones multas per similitudinem magnitudinis apostematis.	And you must manage in small abscesses a moderate perforation, and in large abscesses a wide perforation: or many sections like the magnitude of the abscesses.
Et sunt ex apostematibus, in quibus oportet ut concauetur cutis: et incidatur quando iam facta est sicut pannus, et facta est in termino, quod iam mortua est: sicut illud quod accidit in multis, ut dubelet, et bubonibus.	And there are from the apostemata, in which it is necessary that the skin should be concaved: and it occurs when it has been made like a piece of cloth, and has been made at the end, when it is dead: as it happens with many things, as with worms and boils.
Et ex eis sunt quae secantur sectione habente tres angulos.	And there are those which are cut through with a section having three angles.
Et ex eis est, ex quo inciditur sicut figura folii myrti.	And there are those which occur like the shape of a myrtle leaf
Sicut apostema inguinum.	Like the apostema of the groin
Et ex eis sunt in quibus administratur sectio rotunda, et sectio lunaris: et similes eis ex sectionibus.	And there are those in which a round section and a crescent section are administered: and similar things from sections
Illud uero cui non est caput, sicut sunt apostemata lenia superficialia, oportet ut perfores ipsum perforatione superficiali, uel plana tantum.	That which has no head, like the superficial leninous apostemata, must be pierced through with a superficial perforation, or flattened only
Et oportet, quando apostema est grossum, et iam collegit saniem multam, et perforas ipsum, ut non properes et extrahas pus totum in illa hora: imo extrahe ex ipso partem eius.	And it is necessary, when the apostema is thick and has collected much blood, to perforate it so that it does not swell and extract all the pus in an hour: indeed extract from it a part of itself
Deinde opila apostema usque ad diem alium.	Then anoint the apostema until the next day.
Deinde extrahe quiddam ex pus iterum.	Then draw out some of the pus again.
Fac illud multotiens secundum gradationem, donec egrediatur: praecipue si infirmus est debilis uirtutis, aut mulier praegnans, aut puer paruus, aur senex decrepitus: spiritus enim animalis ab animali multotiens resoluitur cum egressione saniei: et fortasse moritur infirmus, et tu non percipis.	Do this many times according to the degree, until the patient is discharged: especially if the patient is weak in virtue, or a pregnant woman, or a young child, or an old man decrepitus: for the spirit of the animal is dissolved with the discharge of the pus: and perhaps the patient will die, and you will not perceive it
Caue ergo hoc capitulum cautela magna.	Beware therefore of this chapter, for it contains great caution
Et post perforationem tuam, qua ista perforas apostemata, oportet ut abstergas uulnus: et considera.	And after you have perforated the apostema, which you have perforated, you must remove the clot: and consider carefully
Si ergo est uulnus apostematis paruum, aut est sectio plana, tunc administra licinia ex lino, aut coto antiquo.	If there is a small abscess of the apostematis, either perform a plane section or administer ointment from an old bottle.
Et si est apostema magnum, et fissurae perforationis multae sunt, oportet tunc ut intromittas in omnem fissuram licinium, donec perueniant adinuicem.	If there is a large abscess and many puncture wounds exist, it is necessary to instill ointment into every wound until they reach the innermost part.</start_of_turn>
Et si in apostemate abscidisti partem cutis, aut in circumitu concauasti eam: tunc oportet ut impleas eam coto ueteri, aut sicut quando texitur pannus, aut raditur lanugine lini absque humiditate: et stringe ipsum usque ad tertium diem.	If you have excised a piece of skin from the abscess, or if you have cauterized the circumference: then you must apply an old bottle of ointment, or as when a cloth is taken away, or cover it with wool without moisture: and keep it bound until the third day.</start_of_turn>
Deinde proiice ipsum, et cura illud cum eo quod oportet ex unguento, donec sanetur.	Then remove it and care for it with ointment until it heals.</start_of_turn
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis in hora tuae operationis, tunc administra aquam frigidam, et acetum, postquam imbibitur in eis pannus: et ponis ipsum super locum fluxus sanguinis multotiens.	If, however, blood flow occurs during your operation in this hour, then administer cold water and vinegar, after they have been swallowed in a cloth: and place it over the site of the bleeding many times.</start_of_turn>
Si autem perseuerat fluxus sanguinis, tunc oportet ut administres regimen, et curationem, et pulueres, quae narraui in locis multis huius nostri libri, et ex diuisione.	If the bleeding persists, then you must administer treatment, care, and powders, which I have mentioned in many places of this book, and from experience.</start_of_turn>
Si autem est in tempore hyemis, et locus apostematis est multorum neruorum: tunc oportet ut infundas puluillos cum uino, et oleo calidis: et ponas eos super loca.	If it is in winter and the abscess is in a place with many nerves: then you must infuse sponges with wine and oil of warmth: and place them over the area.</start_of_turn
Et si fuerit in aestate, et loca sunt carnosa: tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos imbibitos in aqua, et oleo, aut eum uino et oleo, et totum illud frigidum.	And if it is in summer and the place is fatty: then you must place sponges soaked in water, and oil, or both with wine and oil, and keep it cold.</start_of_turn>
Donec quando erit dies tertius, sicut diximus, tunc oportet ut soluas apostema, et abstergas ipsum, et administres in curatione eius quod ei conuenit, donec sanetur.	Until then, as we have said, on the third day you must drain the abscess, remove it, and administer treatment which is suitable for it until it heals.</start_of_turn
Hoc est ergo quod necessarium est ex cognitione curationis apostematum uniuersaliter.	This is therefore necessary from the knowledge of the treatment of all apostemata.
Secundum semitam uero distinctionis, iam dixi de omni apostemate, qualiter est uia ad curationem eius capitulatim singulariter.	According to the manner of distinguishing things, as I have said concerning every apostematum, how it is that the way to its cure is set out singly
¶ De sectione apostematum quae accidunt in cute capitis.	Concerning the section of apostemata which happen in the head.
Caput XLI.	Chapter 41.
Accidunt in cute capitis apostemata parua, et sunt ex speciebus Nodorum, quos continent tunicae, quae sunt eis sacci: quasi ipsa sint hausolati gallinae.	There happen in the head small apostemata which are of the kind of knots, which contain tunicae, which are like sacks: as if they were themselves like the gall-cocks' houses
Et ipsorum species sunt multae.	And their kind is many
Ex eis sunt pingues: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditatem similem limo: et ex eis quae continent humiditatem similem frisatis et pultibus: et eis similibus, et ex eis sunt, quae sunt lapidea dura.	Some are fat: and some contain moisture like slime: and some contain moisture like blood clots: and some are like these, and some are hard stones
Et in sectione omnium, et ipsorum extractione non est timor, dum apud ipsorum sectionem non facit contrarietatem arteria.	And in the section of all of them, and their extraction is not to be feared, as long as during their section there is no contradiction of the arteries.
Et operatio in sectione eorum est, ut experiaris ea cum instrumento, cuius forma uenit post haec, quod nominatur Intromissum, donec scias quid contineat.	And the operation in their section is to learn them with the instrument which form comes after this, which is called the Intromissum, until you know what it contains
Nam si est illud quod continet humiditas, tunc seca ipsum sectione secundum longitudinem sectione superficiali: secundum hanc formam.	For if it contains moisture, then dry it out by the superficial section: by this form.
Et incipe cum sectione ex linea b. ad lineam, g. Cum ergo euacuatur humiditas, tunc excoria kistin quae continet illam humiditatem, et non dimittas ex ea aliquid penitus.	And begin with the section from line b to line g. When as much moisture has been evacuated as possible, then remove the knot which contains it, and do not leave anything behind
Multotiens enim redit, si remanet ex ea aliquid.	Many are returned if anything is left behind
Deinde submerge cotum in unguento aegyptio, si est praesens: et si non, in aqua et sale: et imple cum eo uulnus, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then immerse the head in Egyptian unguent if it is present: and if not, in water and salt: and anoint with oil and draw out on another day
Ipsum enim corrodet quod remansit ex kisti.	The wound eats up that which remains from the cyst.
Deinde itera super ipsum cotum cum aegyptio secundo, et tertio, et si indiges illo, donec confidas quia non remanserit ex kisti aliquid, tunc enim cura uulnus cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Repeat over the wound with Egyptian resin first, second, and third time, and if it does not digest it, until you are confident that nothing remains of the cyst, then indeed cure with oil until it is healed
Quod si apostema continet nodum pinguem: tunc seca ipsum secundum hanc formam, sectione habente formam crucis: et proiice uncinos inter duolabia sectionis, et excoria ipsum ab omni parte: et conare uirtutem tuam in extractione tunicae quae continet ipsum.	If there is a swelling with a pimple, then dry it with this form, by section having the shape of a cross: and project the threads between the two lobes of the section, and remove it from all sides: and try your skill in the extraction of the membrane which contains it.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi arteria, tunc fac illud quod narrabo tibi post.	If, however, it makes resistance, it is an artery, then do as I shall tell you afterwards.
Et similiter fac in apostemate, si est lapideum, ex sectione, et curatione eadem, secundum quod diximus.	And in a stone abscess, if it is stony, do the same, by section, and the same cure, as we said before
Et sectio super apostema lapideum est facilior: quoniam est pauci sanguinis et humiditatis.	And the section of a stone abscess is easier: because there is little blood and moisture.
Et quandoque sunt quaedam horum apostematum quae sunt in capite in quibusdam hominibus, cum quibus penitus non est humiditas.	And sometimes there are some head abscesses in certain people, in which there is no moisture at all
Quod est: quia ego secui super apostema in capite mulieris uetulae, et inueni apostema sicut lapis solidus et durus, asper, albus, qui non poterat frangi: et si percuteretur cum eo aliquis proiiciendo, uulnerat ipsum.	Which is: because I have seen over a head abscess in a maidservant, and I found an abscess like a solid and hard stone, rough, white, which could not be broken: and if I pierced it with anything, it burst open
In aliis uero apostematibus accidentibus in capite, praeter haec scilicet apostemata quae accidunt in capitibus puerorum, et apud radices aurium, sectio eorum omnium sit sectio superficialis.	In other abscesses which happen in the head, besides these indeed there are head abscesses which happen in children, and near the roots of the ears, the section of these is to be superficial
Vel pone perforationem eorum semper ab inferiori parte eorum, ut alleuietur cursus saniei ad inferiora.	Or make the perforation always from the lower part downwards, so as to preserve the progress of the healing downwards
Deinde cura ea cum eo quod conuenit eis ex curatione.	Then care for it as seems good to you from this point forward.
¶ De sectione Strophularum in collo.	On the section of the Stropharia in the neck.
Caput XLII.	On the section of the Stropharia in the neck.
Multotiens acccidunt ista apostemata in collo, et sub assellis, et inguinibus: et quandoque accidunt in reliquo corpore.	Many times these [lymph nodes] are found swollen in the neck, under the armpits, and in the groin: and sometimes also in the rest of the body.
Et super illa quae ex eis accidunt in collo, sunt unum, et multa: et generantur ab inuicem: et omnis Strophula ex eis est intra tunicam propriam ei, sicut est in nodis et apostematibus capitis, sicut narrauimus.	And concerning those which are in the neck, there is one and many of them: and they are generated from each side: and every Strophary is within its own sheath, as in the nodes and the swellings of the head, as we have mentioned
Et species harum Strophularum sunt multae.	There are many kinds of these lymph nodes
Et ex eis enim sunt lapideae: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates: et ex eis sunt malignae, quae non obediunt curationi.	These are fatty [lymph nodes], and those which contain moisture, and malignant ones which do not yield to treatment
In illa ergo quam ex eis uides bonae dispositionis in tactu, cuius manifestum est propinquum colori cutis, et mouetur ad omnem partem, et non est annexa cum neruis colli, neque cum guidegi, neque cum arteria, neque est profunda: oportet ut seces eam sectione superficiali a superiori parte ad inferiorem partem corporis ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. et excoria eam ab omni parte: et extende duo labia cutis cum uncino, aut cum uncinis multis, si indiges illo, sicut diximus in apostematibus capitis, et extrahe eam paulatim.	Wherein, if there is a good flow of blood in the touch [i.e. the colour of the lymph node is similar to that of the surrounding skin], and it moves towards all parts, and is not connected with the nerves of the neck, or with the jugular veins, or arteries, or is not deep: it should be cut with a superficial incision from the upper part to the lower part of the body along a line, b. along a line, g. and the skin should be stripped away from all sides: and two lips of skin should be held together with a single layer, or with many layers if necessary, as is done with the swellings of the head, and the lymph should be extracted gradually
Et est super cautelam, ut non incidatur uena, aut neruus.	It is important to be cautious not to cut any blood vessel or nerve
Et sit spatumile non acutum ualde: ut non addat tibi manum tuam cum incisione, aut inquietet infirmum, et incidas quod non est necesse.	The wound should not be too sharp and wide: so as not to make your hand slip with the incision, or to frighten the patient, and you should cut only what is necessary
Si autem incidis uenam, aut arteriam, aut prohibet te ab operatione, tunc pone in uulnus zegi tritum, aut quosdam pulueres qui abscindunt sanguinem, et stringe uulnus, et dimitte ipsum, donec quiescat acuitas apostematis, et mollificetur uulnus: uel incipit et uult putrefieri.	If, however, you cut a vein or an artery, or are hindered by the operation, then put in the wound a piece of sponge which absorbs blood, or any powder which absorbs blood, and press the wound firmly, and leave it alone until the swelling subsides, and the wound is softened: or begin again and desist from the operation
Nam sanguis abscinditur tuncia Redi ergo ad operationem tuam, donec compleas.	Blood is severed by the clamp, Redi, until you complete the operation.
Deinde inquire digito tuo indice, si remansit aliquid ex Strophulis aliis paruis: ergo incide eas, et munda eas.	Then inquire with your index finger whether anything remains from the other small trophues: if so, cut them away, and wash them clean.
Quod si est in radice Strophulae uena magna: tunc oportet ut non incidas illam Strophulam ex radice sua: imo oportet ut liges eam cum filo duplato forti, et dimittas eam donec cadat per se absque nocumento.	If there is anything in the root of the large trophue: then it is necessary that you do not cut that trophue from its root: rather it is necessary that you bind it with a strong doubled thread, and let it go until it falls off by itself without any strangulation
Deinde imple uulnus coto ueteri, quod iam submersisti in unguento aegyptio.	Then place the outer coat of the sponge which you have submerged in Egyptian unguent under the edge of the wound
Deinde cura ipsum.	Then take care of yourself.
Si inciditur Strophula tota, tunc oportet ut aggreges labia duo uulneris: et suas ipsum statim, postquam uides quia prorsus non remansit superfluitas.	If the whole trophue is cut through, then it is necessary that you gather the two lips of the wound: and hold them together immediately, after which you should wash because there is no surplus left.
Si autem uides quod remansit superfluitas propter magnitudinem Strophulae, tunc oportet ut intendas ad incidendam radicem eius, et extrahendam eam: et administra suturam quam diximus.	If, however, you wash and find that there is still surplus because of the size of the trophue, then it is necessary that you insert your finger to the root of it and extract it: and perform the suture as we have said.
Et quae ex Strophulis continet humiditates, perfora illam perforatione superficiali: ut appareat tibi locus maturitatis eius: et pone perforationem ab eo quod sequitur inferius corporis, sicut diximus.	And as for the remainder of the trophues which contains moisture, perforate it with a superficial perforation: so that you may see the place of its maturity: and place the perforation below that which follows from the lower part of the body, as we have said
Deinde administra post perforationem licinia cum unguento, et similia eis, ut corrodat quod remansit ex corruptione, donec quando uides uulnus iam mundatum esse: tunc cura ipsum cum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then administer after the perforation lint with unguent, and like that, so that it consumes what remains from the corruption, until when you wash the wound you find that it is clean: then take care of yourself with the generated carnation of flesh until it is healed
¶ De sectione Epiglotis ab apostemate intra guttur accidente.	In the cutting of the epiglottis from the apostemate inwards of the gut, by chance
Caput XLIII.	Chapter XLIII.
Dixerunt antiqui hanc sectionem in Epigloti, et non uidi aliquem in terra nostra, qui eam fecerit: et haec est scriptura sermonis eorum.	They say that the ancients made this incision in the epiglottis, and no one in our land has ever done it: this is the writing of their words.
In habentibus autem synanchiam, oportet ut deuitetur sectio Epiglotis: cum non fiat iuuamentum per illud: propterea, quod omnes uenae et pulmo sunt infirmi.	But in our times, when the synanchiam has become swollen, it is necessary to make an incision in the epiglottis: for if this is not done, the veins and the lungs will be weakened.
In illis uero qui habent apostema calidum in ore, aut gutture, aut duabus amigdalis, quando non est aegritudo in cannali, oportet uti sectione Epiglotis, ad fugiendum ex perditione quae fit ex praefocatione.	In those who have a callous swelling in the mouth, or the gullet, or two abscesses in the tonsils, when there is no inflammation in the channel, it is necessary to make an incision in the epiglottis, in order to escape the destruction which results from the protrusion
Oportet ergo quando uolumus illud, ut secemus Epiglotim sub tribus circulis Epiglotis, aut quatuor, sectione parua per latitudinem, in eo quod est inter duos circulos per quantitatem, quod sit sectio in sifac, non in cartilagine: et iste quidem locus est conueniens sectioni, quoniam est priuatus carne, et uasa sanguinis ab eo sunt longinqua.	It is necessary therefore, when we wish to do this, to cut the epiglottis under three or four circles of the epiglottis, with a small incision across the width of the tissue between two circles, as it is in the cartilage, not in the flesh: and this is the most convenient place to make the incision, because it is devoid of flesh, and the blood vessels from it are long
Quod si medicator est timidus, tunc oportet ut extendat cutem gutturis cum uncino.	If the physician is timid, then it is necessary for him to extend the skin of the gullet with one finger.
Deinde findat cutem, donec quando peruenit ad cannalem: deuitet uas sanguinis, si uidet ex eis aliquid.	Then he will find the skin, until he reaches the channel: he will see blood vessels there, if anything has leaked out from them.
Deinde secet sifac quod narrauimus: et significatur super sectionem cannalis ex phlegmate quod egreditur ex ea, cum eo quod disrumpitur, et abscisione uocis.	Then he will cut the cartilage which we mentioned: and it is signified above the incision of the channel by the phlegm which comes out of it, with that which is broken, and with the cutting of the vein.
Et dimitte uulnus apertum tempore aliquo.	And let the wound be closed at a suitable time.
Cum ergo remouetur hora in qua timetur praefocatio, aggrega duo labia uulneris cutis, et sue ipsam solam absque cartilagine.	When the hour has passed in which the protrusion is complete, gather together two lips of the wound and stitch them only with the skin, without the cartilage
Deinde administra medicinas quae faciunt nasci carnem, usquequo sanetur.	Then give medicines which cause the flesh to grow until it is healed.
Inquit Albucasis.	Then give medicines which cause the flesh to grow until it is healed.
Summa huius sermonis quem narrauimus, expositio non est, nisi quando uident, quod aliquod horum apostematum iam opilauit guttur infirmi: et sublimatus est infirmus super mortem, et uult intersecari anhelitus eius: uadunt ad secandum Epiglotim, ut respiret infirmus super locum uulneris quadam respiratione, et saluetur a morte: et propter hoc praeceperunt dimittere uulnus apertum, donec consumatur malicia aegritudinis, et est malicia eius tribus diebus, et quasi ipsa: tunc ergo praecaeperunt suere uulnus, et curare ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then give medicines which cause the flesh to grow until it is healed.
Et illud quod uidi per me ipsum est, quod una ancilla accaepit cultellum, et misit cum in guttur suum, et incidit cum eo partem cannalis pulmonis.	Then give medicines which cause the flesh to grow until it is healed.
Et uocatus sum ad curationem eius, et inueni eam mugire, sicut est mugitus mortui.	Then give medicines which cause the flesh to grow until it is healed
Detexi ergo a uulnere, et inueni sanguinem qui egressus fuerat ex uulnere paruum.	Then give medicines which cause the flesh to grow until it is healed
Confisus ergo sum, quod ipsa non absciderat uenam, neque guidegi: et uentus egrediebatur ex uulnere.	Then give medicines which cause the flesh to grow until it is healed
Properaui ergo, et sui uulnus, et curaui ipsum, donec sanum est: et non accidit ancillae aliquid, nisi raucedo in uoce: et rediit post dies ad meliorem dispositionum suarum.	Then give medicines which cause the flesh to grow until it is healed
Hinc ergo dico: quod in sectione Epiglotis non est timor.	Then give medicines which cause the flesh to grow until it is healed
¶ De sectione Herniae gutturis.	Then give medicines which cause the flesh to grow until it is healed
Caput XLIIII.	Then give medicines which cause the flesh to grow until it is healed
Hoc Apostema nominatum Hernia gutturis, est apostema magnum, secundum colorem corporis: et est in mulieribus multum.	Then give medicines which cause the flesh to grow until it is healed
Et est secundum duos modos: aut enim est naturale: aut est accidentale.	Then give medicines which cause the flesh to grow until it is healed
In naturali certe non est ingenium.	Then give medicines which cause the flesh to grow until it is healed
Accidentale uero est secundum duos modos: quorum unus est similis nodis pinguibus.	The accidental wound is of two kinds: one is like a pimple.
Et modus alter, est similis apostemati quod fit ex nodatione arteriae.	The other kind is like an abscess which arises from a knot in a blood vessel.
Et in ipso est timor, et non oportet ut praesumptio fiat ad ipsum cum ferro, nisi in eo quod est paruum: et tu proba ipsum, et inuestiga ipsum cum Intromisso.	There is fear in this, and it must not be presumed that it is small: and you must try it out and examine it with an instrument.
Si ergo inuenis ipsum simile nodo pingui, et non est suspensum cum aliqua uenarum: tunc seca ipsum, sicut secantur nodi: et extrahe ipsum cum eo quod continet ex kisti, si est in kisti: et si non, tunc perscrutare totum eius.	If you find it to be like a pimple and not associated with any other swelling: then dry it out, as you would dry out a pimple; and extract it with the instrument which contains the pus, if there is pus in it: or if not, then examine the whole of it thoroughly
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod oportet ex curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for the place with it until it is healed
¶ De sectione super species Nodorum.	Regarding the excision of something bigger than a pimple.</start_of_turn>
Caput XLV.	(The text continues with the next section of the book.)</start_of_turn>
Nodorum multae sunt species, et ego iam dixi omnes species eorum in diuisione: et oportet ut narrem hic differentiam inter Nodum, et Exituram: cum sit dubitationem faciens.	There are many kinds of knots, and I have already mentioned all their kinds in their order: and it is necessary to know the difference between a knot and an extrusion, when there is doubt.</start_of_turn>
Dico ergo, quod cum Exitura est caliditas, et febris, et dolores uehementes, donec sedatur ebullitio superfluitatis, et completur putrefactio: tunc enim quiescunt febris et calor.	I say, therefore, that when an extrusion has become cold, and has lost its heat, and the pain has subsided: then the swelling has subsided, and the corruption has ceased. And then the fever and heat will cease.</start_of_turn
Cum Nodo uero non est caliditas, neque febris, neque dolores, et continet eos kistis sifachin, qui est eis saccus proprius, et est secundum colorem corporis: et est incaeptio eorum sicut cicer, et fit sicut batecha, et maior et minor.	When, on the other hand, there is a knot which has no heat, neither fever, nor pain, and which contains pus in its own sac, which is its natural container, and which is similar in color to the body: and which has the character of cicer, being soft and having the size of a bean, or bigger or smaller.</start_of_turn
Et sunt secundum duas species: aut pingues: aut continent humiditatem.	And there are two kinds: either soft or containing moisture.</start_of_turn
Et colores humiditatis sunt multi, secundum quod dixi in diuisione.	And the colours of moisture are many, as I have said in the previous discourse.
Oportet ergo, quando peruenis ad curationem Nodi, ut experiaris eum, et inquiras ipsum in primis cum instrumento quod nominatur Intromissum, secundum quod ueniet forma eius in capitulo quod est post hoc.	It is necessary therefore, when you reach the treatment of the Node, to experiment with it and inquire about it first with the instrument which is called the Intromissum, as its form will be explained in the following chapter.
Et modus inquisitionis apostematum, et Nodorum omnium est, ut accipias hoc instrumentum, et intromittas ipsum in humidiorem locum, quem inuenis in apostemate: et tu reuolue digitos tuos cum eo paulatim, donec scias quod instrumentum iam penetrauit cutem.	The method of inquiry after the swelling of the Node and of all Nodes is as follows: you take this instrument and introduce it into the moist place which you find in the swelling: and you gradually withdraw your fingers until you know that the instrument has penetrated the skin
Deinde ultima manum tuam secundum mensuram magnitudinis apostematis.	Then lastly you move your hand according to the measure of the swelling
Deinde extrahe Intromissum, et considera illud quod egrediur in uestigio eius.	Then withdraw the Intromissum and consider what comes out of its wound
Si ergo egreditur humiditas currens, quicunque color sit: tunc seca ipsum sectione superficiali, secundum quod dixi in reliquis apostematibus.	If therefore liquid moisture comes out, whatever its colour be: then dry it with a superficial section, as I have said in the other swellings.
Et si non egreditur humiditas in uestigio Intromissi, tunc scias quia est pinguis: seca ergo super ipsum sectione habente formam crucis, secundum formam hanc, sicut docui te: et suspende ipsum cum uncinis, et excoria cutem ab omni parte cum facilitate: et custodi kistin si potes super illud, ut extrahas ipsam sanam cum Nodo.	And if no moisture comes out of the wound of the Intromissum, then you know that it is hard: dry it therefore with a section having the shape of a cross, as it has been shown: and suspend it with sutures, and strip away the skin from all sides with ease: and keep the fat if there is any above that, until you have extracted the Node whole.
Si autem disrumpitur kistis apud operationem, et non est possibile extrahere ipsam sanam, multotiens enim accidit illud, tunc extrahe ipsam frustatim, donec non remaneat ex ea aliquid.	If indeed the bladder is burst during the operation and it is not possible to extract it whole, as often happens in this case, then extract it fragment by fragment, until nothing remains of it
Nam si remanet ex ea aliquid parum, aut multum, redit Nodus secundum plurimum.	For if there remains anything of it, little or much, the Node returns most of the time.
Quod si uincit te, et remanet ex eo parum: tunc imple uulnus apud completionem tuam, quibusdam pulueribus corrosiuis acutis: et stringe uulnus, et pone supra ipsum quod sedet apostema calidum, et cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	If you are stung by it, and there remains a little: then make a wound at the completion of your work, with some corrosive powders for acute wounds: and string the wound, and place above it the softened swelling, and care for it with the rest of the treatment, until it heals.</start_of_turn>
Si ergo est Nodus magnus, tunc sue duo labia eius, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat.	If there is a large knot, then two of its lips must be sutured, and care for it as though it were a living thing.
Si autem est tibi contraria uena pulsatilis, aut non pulsatilis: tunc propera, et imple locum zegi trito, et dimitte ipsum strictum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec putrefiat uulnus, et quiescat ebullitio sanguinis: deinde redi ad incidendum illud quod remansit ex Nodo.	If, however, the opposite side be swollen or not swollen: then prepare it, and make a place for the excision of the tumor, and keep it bound for two or three days, until the tumor has decayed, and the blood-clotting has ceased: then return to the incision which remains of the knot.
¶ De foris instrumentorum pro sectione et perforatione.	As to instruments for the cutting and perforating of the knot.
Caput XLVI.	Chapter 46.
EX Eis sunt formae Intromissorum, et sunt trium specierum.	From the veins there are three forms of inward protrusions, and there are three kinds of them.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et ex eis est medium, et ex eis est paruum.	From these veins there is a large one, and a medium one, and a small one
Fiant ex ferro alfulud quadratarum extremitatum decenter, ut festinent introitum in apostemate.	Let them be of iron, blunt at the extremities and pointed in the middle, so that they may hasten the entrance into the abscess
Et istae sunt formae Experientium, et no, id est, perforantia: et unum eorum nominatur beris, idest, peforans: et sunt trium specierum.	These are the forms of the experienced ones, and no, that is, perforators: and one of them is called a beris, that is, a perforator, and there are three kinds of them
Ex eis enim est magnum, et medium, et paruum.	From these veins there is a large one, and a medium one, and a small one
Conueniunt, ut inuestigentur per ea apostemata, et exiturae, et fistulae, et bubones ab eo quod inter ea est ex ossibus.	They converge, so that they may investigate through these abscesses, and exits, and fistulas, and bubbles from that which is between the bones
Et aliis fiunt rotunda, tersa, lenia, sicut acus magnae quibus subsellia suuntur, ex citrino scilicet, aut ex aere, aut ferro, aut argento.	And others are round, third, and smooth, like a large needle which sews under silk, from citrine or from air, or iron, or silver.
Et meliora eorum sunt quae fiunt ex citrino.	And the best of these are those which are made from citrine.
Et fiunt Experientia etiam de plumbo nigro, quae conueniunt ut per ea experiantur fistulae, quarum concauitate sunt reflexiones, ut reflectantur cum lenitate sua cum illis reflexionibus.	And there are also experiences to be made from black lead, which converge so that they may pass through these fistulas, the reflections of whose concavity will be reflected back with their smoothness against those reflections
Et sunt iterum trium specierum.	There are three kinds again.
Quoniam ex eis sunt longa, ex eis media, et ex eis breuia, secundum quantitatem amplitudinis fistulae et stricturae eius.	For according to the quantity of the breadth of the fistula and the extent of its narrowing, there are three kinds: long, medium, and short.
Forma Vncinorum, et sunt multarum specierum.	The shapes of the fistulas are various, and there are many kinds
Quoniam ex eis sunt simplices, scilicet quibus est curuitas una: et sunt trium specierum sicut uides, Magni, Medii, et Parui.	For according to the quantity of the breadth of the fistula and the extent of its narrowing, there are three kinds: simple, that is to say having only one curvature: and there are three kinds like fluids, great, medium, and small
Et ex eis sunt Vncini caeci: et sunt trium specierum.	The fistulas are blind at one end, and there are three kinds of them.
Et ex eis sunt uncini habentes duas curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et ex eis sunt uncini habentes tres curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et omnes isti sunt necessarii in loco suo.	There are three kinds which have two curvatures at one end, and three kinds which have three curvatures at one end; all of these are necessary in their place
Et istae sunt formae Scalpellorum, quibus secantur et excoriantur Nodi, et apostemata: et sunt trium specierum: quoniam ex eis est magnum, medium, et paruum.	These are the forms of scalpels which cut and scrape knots and abscesses: and there are three kinds of them, for according to the quantity of the breadth of the fistula and the extent of its narrowing there are three kinds: large, medium, and small
Eorum extremitates quibus fit sectio sunt acutae, extremitates aliae sunt non acutae: et non ponuntur taliter, nisi ut cum eis fiat iuuamentum in excoriatione Nodorum apud timorem incisionis uenae, aut nerui: et ut sanetur per ea infirmus, et inueniat tranquillitatem parumper ex adustione quam inuenit apud excoriationem apostematis.	The extremities which are cut are acute, but the others are not acute: and they are not placed like this, except when there is an operation on the excision of knots near the fear of the division of the vein, or nerve: and in order that the patient may recover more easily from the surgery than from the excision of an abscess
Istae sunt Magda, et sunt specierum trium.	These are great, and there are three kinds of them
Fiunt ex aere, et sunt similia Radio, cum quo fit alcohol: et in extremitate lata est puncta Spatumilis occultata: et in ea currit ad interiora, et ad exteriora quando uis, sicut uides.	They are made of air, and are similar to a radio, with which alcohol is made: and at the wide end there is a hidden Spatumilis point: and in this there runs inwards and outwards when needed, like liquids
Forma Spatumilium quae absconduntur inter digitos apud perforationem apostematum: et non percipiunt ea infirmi: et sunt trium specierum, magnum, medium, et paruum.	The form of the Spatumili which are driven between the fingers at the perforation of the abscess: and the patient does not perceive them: and there are three kinds, large, medium, and small
Fomae Ventosarum cum quibus abscinditur fluxus sanguinis: et sunt trium specierum, magnae, mediae, et paruae.	Wind-formed foam when severed breaks blood flow: there are three kinds, great, medium, and small.
Fiant ex aere, aut citrino, rotundae, ad longitudinem parumper, sicut uides: et sint ad subtilitatem.	Foam arises from air or citrine [substance], rotund in shape, to a moderate length, like tears: and they are slight in weight
Et oportet ut sint istae species Ventosarum apud te magnae, et paruae: ut abscindas per eas sanguinem cum uelocitate apud necessitatem, et tunc quando non est tibi praesens medicina.	It is necessary that these kinds of wind-foam should be great and small in your case: so that you can sever blood flow quickly when necessary, and when there is no physician present.
Verumtamen non utaris eis in abscisione sanguinis in omni loco corporis, et non utaris nisi in locis carnosis: sicut lacertis cruris, et coxae, et lacertis brachiorum, et mammillarum, et uentris, et inguinum, et similibus eis, ex lacertis carnosis, humidis.	Indeed, do not employ these in the severance of blood in every part of the body, and do not use them except in places where there is carnation: such as for fractures of the limb, the hip, fractures of the forearm and breast, of the belly, groin, and similar places, from fractures of carnation, humors.
Et quandoque fiunt ex eis instrumenta parua alia similia corticibus fisticorum, secundum suam formam: quibus abscinditur sanguis quando fluit ex loco phlebotomiae, aut apud incisionem uenae, aut arteriae: et quandoque fiunt ex eis rotundae secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes these are other small instruments like fragments of sponges, according to their form: with which blood is severed when it flows from the site of phlebotomy, or at the incision of the vein, or artery: and sometimes they are rounded in this fashion
¶ De cura Mammillarum hominum quae mammillis mulierum assimilantur.	Concerning the care of the breasts of women who suckle the breasts of women.
Caput XLVII.	Chapter XLVII.
Quandoque inflantur Mammillae quorundam hominum apud complementum somni (id est, cum incipiunt pollui in somno) donec similantur mammillis mulierum: et remanent apostemosae foede.	When the breasts of some men swell somewhat during the night (that is, when they begin to become soiled in sleep) until they resemble the breasts of women: and they remain soft after they have become soiled.
Qui ergo abhorret illud, oportet ut secet super mammillas sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Deinde excoria pinguedinem totam.	Whoever dislikes that, it is necessary to cut across the breast with a lunar section, according to this form from the line A to line B, and then from line B to the edge.
Postea imple uulnus ex medicamine incarnatiuo.	Then apply a little ointment from the medicaments of incision.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then join the two lips of the incision with sutures, and care for it until it heals.
Si autem declinat mammilla ad inferiora, et mollificatur propter magnitudinem suam, sicut accidit mulieribus: tunc oportet ut findatur in duobus lateribus suis superioribus duabus sectionibus similibus figurae lunari, quarum unaquaeque continetur cum altera apud fines utriusque, donec sit linea maior continens minorem, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Postea excoria cutem quae est inter duo labia, et aufer pinguedinem, et administra quod diximus de sutura et pulueribus, quod est necessarium ex curatione, donec sanetur.	If, however, the breast droops downwards and is softened by its size, as often happens with women: then it is necessary to find two sutures on the two upper sides of the breast, similar in shape to a crescent moon. Each one should be continued with the other at the end of each, until the line which contains the greater part contains the smaller, following this shape from the line b. to the line g. Then scrape the skin between the two lips and remove the fat, and administer what we have said concerning suture and powder, which is necessary for the cure, until the wound is healed.
Si autem non comples incisionem eius quod oportet te incidere, propter inquietudinem infirmi, aut propter fluxum sanguinis: tunc oportet ut impleas uulnus coto submerso unguento corrosiuo, et dimitte ipsum, donec corrodat illud quod remansit ex pinguedine.	If, however, you do not wish to make an incision, because of the patient's anxiety or because of the flow of blood: then you must place a sponge soaked in corrosive unguent under the wound and let it go, until that which remains of the fat has corroded.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for the wound until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
¶ De perforatione apostematis, quod accidit sub Titillico.	In the perforation of the nipple, which happens under the nipple of Titillicus.</start_of_turn>
Caput XLVIII.	Chapter XLVIII.</start_of_turn
Ista apostemata quae accidunt sub Titillico, sunt ex speciebus Strophularum dura, quae continet kistis, et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates.	These nipples which happen under the nipple of Titillicus are of the kind of hard stropheae which contain vesicles, and from these are those which contain humours.</start_of_turn
Quae ergo sunt ex eis quae continent humiditates, oportet ut secentur sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam, ex linea b. ad lineam, g. cum ergo euacuatur totum quod est in apostemate ex sanie, tunc imple ipsum coto ueteri, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Which are from the humours which contain moisture, must be sectioned with a lunar shape, following this shape from the line b. to the line g. when all that is in the nipple is evacuated from the blood, then place a sponge under the old one and let it go until the next day.</start_of_turn
Deinde auferatur cotum, et curetur cum unguento conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then remove the sponge and care for it with a suitable unguent until it is healed.</start_of_turn
Quod si apostema fuerit ex specie nodorum Strophularum, tunc scinde super ipsum, sicut diximus in sectione super Strophulas aequaliter.	If the nipple should be of the kind of knots of stropheae, then split it above it, as we said concerning the stropheae which are equal.</start_of_turn
Si autem extenditur uulnus in hoc ut emittat pus, tunc administra in eo cauterium, secundum quod diximus in eo quod praemissum est.	If, however, a swelling extends itself in this way as to emit pus, then apply cautery to it, as we have said previously.
¶ De sectione apostematis quod accidit propter Arteriam et Venam.	In the event that the swelling results from an artery or vein.</start_of_turn>
Caput XLIX.	Chapter 49.</start_of_turn>
Quando disrumpitur Arteria, et consolidatur cutis quae est supra eam, tuno multotiens accidit inde apostema: et similiter accidit Venae etiam, ut accidat in ea apostema et inflatio.	When an artery is ruptured, and the skin above it is consolidated, a great swelling often arises from the wound: in the same way, swelling may also arise in a vein, as it does in the case of the wound and the swelling.</start_of_turn
Et signa quibus cognoscitur, quod apostema et inflatio sint propter Arteriam et Venam, sunt: quoniam, quando apostema est propter arteriam, est longum, aggregatum in profundo corporis: et quando impellis apostema digits tuis, sentis quasi sit ei stridor.	The signs by which it is known that the swelling and swelling are caused by an artery or a vein are these: for when the swelling is caused by an artery, it is long and aggregated in the depth of the body: and when you press on the swelling with your finger, you feel as though there is a constriction.</start_of_turn
Et illud quod est propter Venam, est rotundum in manifesto corporis.	And that which is caused by a vein is round in its manifestation on the surface of the body.</start_of_turn
Et sectio super hoc apostema est error, et praecipue quod est sub ascellis, et inguinibus, et collo, et in locis multis corporis: et est magnum ualde.	The section of such a swelling is dangerous, especially if it is under the armpits, and in the groin, and the throat, and in many parts of the body: and it is very dangerous.</start_of_turn
Oportet ergo ut deuitetur eius cura cum ferro, et quod ex eis etiam est in extremitatibus, aut in capite, oportet ut deuitetur.	It is therefore necessary to take care of such a swelling with fire, and that which is also in the extremities, or in the head, it is necessary to take care of it.</start_of_turn
Super illud ergo quod ex eis est ex inflatione orificii Arteriae, finde in cute sectione in longitudine.	Furthermore, from the inflation of the opening of the artery, find in the cut in the length.</start_of_turn
Deinde aperi sectionem cum uncinis, postea Arteriam: et libera eam ex tunicis, donec detegatur.	Then open the cut with hooks, afterwards the artery: and free the wound from the tunics, until it is detached.</start_of_turn
Deinde intromitte sub ea acum, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, et stringe Arteriam cum filo duplo in duobus locis, secundum quod docui te in extractione duarum Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then introduce under these the point of the needle, and make the wound penetrate right through to the other side, and ligate the artery with two threads in two places, as we taught you in the extraction of two arteries which are in the course of time.</start_of_turn
Deinde punge locum, qui est inter duo ligamenta cum spatumili, donec egrediatur sanguis qui est in eo totus, et soluatur apostema.	Then plunge the location which is between two ligaments with the sponge, until blood which is in it altogether has gone out, and the swelling is dissolved.
Deinde administra curationem quae generat pus, donec cadant ligamenta: postea cura illud cum unguentis conuenientibus ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then perform the treatment which generates pus, until the ligaments are severed: afterwards care for it with suitable unguents until it is healed.
Quod si fuerit apostema propter sectionem Venae, tunc oportet ut teneas manu tua quod tibi possibile est ex apostemate cum cute.	If there is swelling because of the cutting of a vein, then it is necessary to remove the clots from the swelling with the hand as much as possible from the swelling with the skin
Deinde intromitte acum sub loco quem tenuisti manu tua, et fac eam penetrare: et sit in ea filum duplum, donec extrahas ipsum ex latere altero.	Then introduce the needle under the place where you have held your hand, and make it penetrate: and be in it two strings, until you have pulled it out from the other side.
Deinde liga cum ipso apostema ligamento bono: secundum quod dixi tibi in ligamento uuae, a duabus partibus cum duabus extremitatibus fili.	Then bind with the swelling the ligament with a good ligature: according to what I have said to you concerning the ligature of the veins, from two parts with two extremities of the thread.
Si autem times quod extrahatur filum, tunc intromitte acum aliam cum filo alio sub apostemate toto apud incisionem acus: preme, et stringe fila tua in quatuor locis.	If you are afraid that the thread will be pulled out, then introduce another needle with another thread under the whole swelling at the incision of the needle: beforehand, and tighten your thread in four places
Deinde seca apostema in medio sui, donec quando egreditur quod in eo est: tunc incide superfluitatem cutis, et dimitte quod ligatum est ex ea.	Then dry the swelling in its middle, until when it has gone out what is in it: then cut the excess of the skin, and remove what is bound from it
Deinde pone super ipsum puluillum quem submersisti in uino, et oleo.	Then put over it a little ball which you have submerged in wine, and oil.
Deinde administra curationem, quae fit cum liciniis et unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then perform the treatment which is made with liniments and unguents, until it is healed
¶ De apostemate quod accidit ex torsione Neruorum.	As for the swelling which arises from the twisting of nerves.
Caput L.	Chapter L.
Sicut accidit apostema in Arteria et Vena, similiter accidit apostema in Neruis: quod accidit in eis percussio, aut accidit a labore superfluo, et similibus: et fit plurimum illis in locis adiutoriorum, aut calcanei, et in omni loco in quo mouentur iuncturae: et est apostema graue.	Like that which happens with swelling in the Artery and the Vein, in the same way it happens with the nerves: which happens in the percussion of them, or from excessive work, and in a similar way: and it happens most of all in the armpits, or the calves, and in every place where there is a joint movement: and it is a serious swelling
Similatur color eius reliquo corpori, et est in pluribus dispositionibus absque dolore: et quando stringitur cum uehementia, sentit in eo infirmus simile stupori.	Its colour is similar to that of the rest of the body, and is in various positions without causing pain: and when it is stretched with force, it feels in it like drunkenness.
Et non est apostema aggregatum in profundo corporis, imo est sub cute, et ipsum mouetur ad omnem partem, et non uadit ad anteriora, uel ante, neque retro ad posteriora.	It is not a swelling which has gathered in the depth of the body, but is under the skin, and it moves to every part, and does not go forward or backward or downwards
Quod ergo ex eis est in iuncturis, non oportet ut inuadatur cum ferro.	That which is in the joints is like nails, it does not cause them to be struck with iron.
Fortasse enim accidet contractio.	Perhaps there will be a contraction.
In illo autem quod ex eis est in capite, aut in fronte, finde cutem cum spatumili.	But as for that which is in the head, or in the face, find the skin with a spatula.
Si ergo est apostema paruum, tunc tene ipsum cum forficibus, et abscinde ipsum a radice.	If it is a small swelling, then hold it with forceps, and cut it off from its root.
Et si est magnum, tunc suspende ipsum eum uncino, et excoria ipsum: deinde aufer ipsum, et aggrega uulnus cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if it is large, then suspend it with a thread, and scrape it off: then take it away, and mix it with wax: and sew it up, and care for it until it heals.
¶ De sectione apostematis, quod accidit in uentre.	About the cutting of a swelling which happens inside.
Caput LI.	Chapter LI.</start_of_turn>
Accidunt quibusdam hominibus multotiens in uentribus eorum, et in reliquis corporibus ipsorum, thelil, quae nominantur Fungalia, per similitudinem ipsorum cum fungis.	These things happen to many people in the belly and in the rest of their bodies, these things which are called Fungalia, because of their resemblance to fungi.</start_of_turn>
Quorum radix est subtilis, et ipsorum caput est grossum, et conuersa sunt labia eorum.	Their root is soft, and their head is large, and their edges are rounded off.</start_of_turn
Et est ex eis paruum: et est ex eis quod magnificatur ualde.	And it is like a small nail: and it grows large with heat.</start_of_turn
Et ego quidem iam uidi uirum, et in uentre eius erant duo thelil, quae erant magis quam rebus aliis similia fungis: non erat differentia inter ea, alba, minutae radicis, et inuersabantur labia eorum, et findebantur, et humiditas currebat ex eis semper.	And I also saw a man who had two of these things in his belly, which were larger than any others: there was no difference between them, white or black, small or large, and their edges were flexible, and there was moisture coming from them always.</start_of_turn
Incidi ergo ea, et inueni in pondere unius quasi X et VIII uncia et in altero quasi VI uncia Et operatio in incisione eorum est, ut consideres tunc, si infirmus est humidus, et color thelil est albus, humidum, subtilis radicis: tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili lato, et sint in praesentia tua cauteria in igne.	The wound did yield somewhat, and I found in its weight about X and eight uncia in one and about six uncia in the other. And the operation in its incision is such that you must consider immediately if the patient is humidus, and the colour of the thelil is white, humidum, subtilis radicis: then you must make the incision with a broad spatula, and there will be in your presence cauteria in igne.
Multotiens enim expellitur apud sectionem eius sanguis multus: propera ergo si te uincit sanguis, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	A great quantity of blood is expelled at the section of the wound: take care therefore if blood is inciting you, then cauterize it immediately.
Quod si uides infirmum pauidum et timidum ab incisione cum ferro, tunc accipe filum ex plumbo decenter factum, et stringe cum eo athelul: cuius modus est quem diximus, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	If you see the patient weak and timid from the incision with the knife, then take a leaden weight with a hole in the middle, and string it with thread: in whose manner it is which we have said, and let it go in two days
Deinde adde in strictura plumbi.	Then add lead to the stricture.
Non ergo cesses stringere plumbum, quotiens imprimit in thelil, donec abscindatur, et cadat per se absque labore.	Do not cease to string the lead until it is excreted, and it will go out by itself without toil
Si autem thelil grossae fuerit radicis, tunc in incisione eius est quiddam timoris et pauoris: praecipue quod est in uentre.	If the thelil is large of root, then in its incision there is something fearful and weak: especially what is in the belly.
Verumtamen possibile est, ut incidas medietatem eius.	It is indeed possible that you may cut through the middle of it.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum, ut non redeat.	Then cauterize it, so that it does not return
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then care for it, until the wound is healed
Et caue ne praesumas incidere thelil quod est fusci coloris, pauci sensus, foedi aspectus: ipsum enim est apostema cancerosum: et ego ueniam cum rememoratione Cancri post hoc.	And take heed that you do not presume to cut the thelil which is of a dusky colour, little sense, foul aspect: for it is a cancerous tumour: and I shall remind you of cancer after this
¶ De cura eminentiae Vmbilici.	About the care of the umbilical cord.
Caput LII.	Section 52.
Fit eminentia Vmbilici ex caussis multis.	The swelling of the Umbilical region is from many ulcers.
Aut ex fissuris sifac, quod super uentrem est: et exit ex eo althub, aut intestinum, secundum quod accidit in reliquis rupturis.	Or from rents in the bowels which are above the belly: and come out from this through the navel, or the intestines, according as is the case with the rest of the ruptures.
Aut ex sanguine qui fluit ex Vena, aut ex Arteria, secundum quod praemissum est.	Or from blood which flows from the vein, or from the artery, according as has been said before.
Aut ex uentositate coartata in eo.	Or from a clotted mass in that area.
Si autem est propter fissuram sifac, et exitum thirbi: tunc est color apostematis similis colori corporis: et est lene, absque dolore: et apparet diuersi situs.	If however it is from a rent in the bowels, and the evacuation of the black bile: then is the colour like that of the body: and is soft, without pain: and appears in various places.
Et si est propter egressionem intestini, tunc est situs eius, cum eo quod narrauimus, uehementioris diuersitatis.	And if it is from the discharge of the intestines, then is its place with that which we have narrated, of greater diversity.
Cum ergo tu premis ipsum digitis tuis, occultatur: deinde redit, et fortasse est cum eo sonitus: et magnificatur multum apud introitum balnei, et laborem uehaementum.	When you place your finger on it, it is hidden: then it returns, and perhaps with a sound: and swells greatly at the entrance of the bath, and painful sweat
Si uero est propter humiditatem, est lene, tunc non occultatur quando premis ipsum manu tua, neque constringium, neque additur.	If however it is from humidity, it is soft: then it is not hidden when you place your hand on it, neither is it constricted, neither does it increase
Quod si est propter sanguinem, tunc cum istis signis apparet apostema ad nigredinem de cliue.	Which if from blood, then appears with these signs a black bile.
Si autem est propter carnem natam: tunc est apostema graue, grossum, durum, et figitur secundum quantitatem unam.	If however it is from dead flesh: then is the bile dark, thick, hard, and appears according to the quantity of one.
Si uero est propter uentositatem, tunc tactus eius est lenis.	If however it is from inflammation, then its touch is soft
Et operatio in illo est, ut consideres tunc, si eminentia umbilici est propter sanguinem Arteriae, aut Venae, aut uentositatem: tunc oportet ut prohibearis a curatione eius.	And the operation in that is as you consider, if the swelling of the navel is from blood of the artery, or the vein, or inflammation: then it is necessary to abstain from its treatment.</start_of_turn>
Nam in illo est timor et pauor, sicut docui te in capitulo, in quo dixi apostemata propter arteriam et uenam.	Fear and timidity are common in such matters, as I have already taught you in the previous chapter, concerning the evacuation of stool due to an artery and vein.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est propter intestinum, aut zirbum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, quatenus teneat anhelitum suum, et stet stans extensus.	If the swelling of the belly is caused by the intestines or the spleen: then it is necessary to urge the patient to evacuate his flatulence, as much as he is able, and to remain standing extended
Deinde signa cum encaustro in circumitu umbilici totius.	Then signs are with retention of the faeces all around the belly.
Postea praecipe ei, ut resupinetur inter manus tuas super dorsum suum.	Then command him to lie down between your hands on his back
Deinde circunda cum spatumili lato in circumitu umbilici super locum quem signasti cum encaustro.	Then surround with a sponge broad in the circumference of the belly on the place which you indicated with retention of the faeces
Postea extende medium apostematis ad superiora, cum uncino magno.	Then extend the middle of the evacuation towards the upper parts, with a large sponge.
Deinde liga eum in circumitu forti cum filo, aut cum chorda de serico ligamento firmo: et sit nodus ligamenti alenxotati.	Then bind him firmly in the circumference with thread, or with a strong silk cord: and make a knot which is fixed.
Deinde aperi medium apostematis extensum supra ligamentum.	Then open the middle of the evacuation which is extended above the ligature.
Si ergo inueneris ipsum iam captum a ligamento: tunc extrahe alenxotati, et intromitte in ipsum digitum indicem, et impelle intestinum ad interiora uentris: et si inueneris zirbum, tunc accipe ipsum cum uncino, et incide superfluitatem eius.	If you find that the bowels are caught by the ligature: then draw out the fixed parts and introduce the index finger into it, and push the intestine inwards: and if you find the spleen, then grasp it with the thumb and cut off its excess
Si autem contraria est tibi arteria, aut uena: tunc circunda ipsum multum.	But if the artery or vein is contrary: then surround it muchly
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam.	Then return to your operation.
Et accipe duas acus, et intromitte in eis duo fila fortia: et intromitte duas acus in circumitu quem fecisti circa apostema in modum crucis, quas facis penetrare.	And take two needles, and introduce them into the two strong threads: and introduce two needles in the circumference which you made around the stool in the manner of a cross, which you make penetrate
Deinde stringe apostema in quatuor locis super acus: et si uis, aufer acus, et dimitte locum, donec putrefiat caro extensa: et cadat per se: aut incide ipsam quando subtiliatur et putrefit.	Then string the stool in four places on the needles: and if you wish, remove the needles and leave the place, until the extended flesh has putrefied: and it will fall away by itself: or cut it off when it has become thin and putrefied
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for yourself with what is necessary from unguents until you are healed.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est ex carne nara in eo, aut ex humiditate: tunc oportet ut concaues apostema, sicut diximus.	If swelling of the belly is from carrion in it, or from moisture: then it is necessary to make incisions of the carbuncles, as we have said
Et extrahas sanguinem, aut humiditatem, quam inuenis in eo.	And draw out the blood, or moisture, which you find in it
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod solidat locum.	Then care for yourself with what is necessary from unguents until you are healed.
¶ De cura CANCRI.	About the care of cancer
Caput LIII.	Chapter 53
Iam diximus in diuisione species Cancri, et qualiter est uia ad curationem eius cum medicinis: et cauendum ab eo cum curatione eius cum ferro, ut non ulceretur: et diximus Cancrum generatum in matrice, et cautelam a curatione eius.	We have already said in the discourse concerning the kinds of cancer, and how it is to be treated by physicians: and we must be careful with it so that it does not ulcerate: and we have said that cancer is generated in the womb, and we must be cautious of its treatment.
Et dixerunt antiqui, quod quandoque Cancer est in loco, ubi possibilis est eius eradicatio: sicut Cancer qui est in mammillis, aut in coxa, et eis similibus, ex membris locatis ad extrahendum totum eius: praecipue quando est incipiens paruus.	And the ancients have said that when cancer is in a place where it is possible to eradicate it: such as cancer that is in the breast, or in the hip, and the like, from members that can be excised whole: especially when it is beginning small.
Quando uero antiquatur, et est magnus, non oportet ut appropinques ei.	When it is old, and is great, it is not proper to approach it.
Ego enim non potui sanare ex eo aliquem: neque uidi alium ante me qui peruenerit ad illud.	I cannot cure anyone from it: neither do I know anyone who has been able to do so before me
Et operatio in eo, quando est locatus sicut diximus, est, ut praecedas, et soluas infirmum ex cholera nigra aliquotiens.	And the operation in it, when it is located as we have said, is to precede it, and to solve the disease with black bile several times over
Deinde phlebotoma ipsum si inuenis cum repletione manifesta.	Then perform a phlebotomy if you find it with a swelling that manifests itself
Deinde praepara infirmum praeparatione, in qua locetur cum operatione.	Then prepare the patient for the preparation in which he is placed with the operation
Deinde proiice in Cancrum uncinos qui conueniunt ei.	Then remove from cancer the nails that agree with it
Postea concaua ipsum ab omni parte cum cute, secundum perscrutationem, donec non remaneat aliquid ex radicibus eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere, et non abscindas ipsum uelociter, imo exprime loca, et absterge sanguinem grossum totum manu tua, aut cum quo possibile est ibi ex instrumentis.	Afterwards, concave out the cavity entirely with the knife, following the directions, until nothing remains of the roots: then let blood flow freely, and do not quickly cut through it, but rather press down firmly, and evacuate all the thick blood from your hand, or with whatever instruments are available.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi fluxus sanguinis grossi ex incisione arteriae, aut uenae: tunc cauteriza uenam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If, however, it causes the thick blood to flow from the incision of an artery or vein: then cauterize the vein, until the bleeding stops.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for the rest of the treatment, until healing takes place.
¶ De cura Hydropisis.	(The text continues with the next section of the translation.)
Caput LIIII.	Chapter XLVII.</start_of_turn>
Iam narrauimus in diuisione species Hydropisis, et qualiter fit aggregatio aquae: et signa omnis speciei, et curationem eius cum medicinis.	We shall now explain the different kinds of hydropsism, and how water is aggregated: and the signs of each kind, and their treatment by physicians.</start_of_turn>
Et illa quae curatur cum ferro, non est nisi species asclitis sola: et non approximatur cum ferro speciei timpanitis: neque speciei hyposarcae penitus: nam illud mortale est.	And what is cured with iron is not except one kind of ascites alone: and it is not approached with iron in the case of tympanitis: neither in the case of acute hydrothorax: for that is deadly.</start_of_turn
Quando tu iam medicatus es hanc speciem Hydropisis timpanitis cum medicinis, et non contulit medicatio tua: tunc considera.	When you are treated by a physician for this kind of hydropsism of the tympani, and the treatment does not please you: then consider that.</start_of_turn
Nam si infirmo iam consecuta est debilitas, aut est cum eo infirmitas alia praeter Hydropisim: sicut si sit cum eo tussis, aut uentris solutio, et similia illis: tunc caue ne mediceris ei cum ferro: quoniam est timor illud.	For if a sick person is associated with weakness, or with another illness besides hydropsism: such as with fevers, or solution of the intestines, or similar things: then do not treat him with iron, for fear of that.</start_of_turn
Si autem uides infirmum exuberantis uirtutis, neque est cum eo aegritudo praeter Hydropisim solam: et non est puer, neque senex: tunc modus operationis in eo est, ut tu eleues infirmum stantem inter manus tuas, et minister post ipsum exprimat uentrem eius manu sua impellendo aquam ad inferiorem partem pectinis.	If however you see a sick person of excessive spirit, neither young nor old: then the mode of operation in this case is that you raise the patient up between your hands, and press his belly with your hand, driving out the water downwards to the lower part of the belly.</start_of_turn
Deinde accipe spatumile spinosum, secundum hanc formam.	Then take the sponge, thorned, according to this shape.
Sit duarum partium acutarum, longum, acutae extremitatis sicut Spatumile.	Two acute parts, long, with acute extremities like Spatumile
Verumtamen in eo sit quiddam breuitatis paulatim, ut non pertranseas cum eo apud operationem usque ad intestinum, et laedas ipsum.	But there is something short within, diminishing gradually, so that it does not pass through with it until the operation is finished, and it leaves the wound itself.
Deinde considera.	Then consider.
Nam si est generatio Hydropisis ex parte intestinorum, tunc oportet ut elongeris cum sectione ab umbilico quantitate trium digitorum, ad inferiora in directo eius supra pectinem.	For if there is a generation of Hydropisis from the intestines, then it is necessary to lengthen with a section from the navel to the lower part in a straight line above the pelvis
Si uero generatio Hydropisis est propter aegritudinem epatis: tunc sit sectio tua sinistra ab umbilico tribus digitis.	If, however, the generation of Hydropisis is because of the liver's disease: then your section is left from the navel to three fingers
Et si generatio eius est propter splenem, tunc sit sectio in latere dextro: et non oportet etiam ut sit sectio in latere super quod uult iacere infirmus, ut non currant superfluitates ad illum locum debilem.	If it is because of the spleen: then the section is on the right side: and it is not necessary also that it be on the side where you wish to place the sick person, so that there does not result an excessive flow to the place of weakness.
Deinde perfora cum instrumento cutem totam.	Then pierce with the instrument the whole skin
Deinde intromitte in illam sectionem, et eleua manum tuam cum Spatumili inter cutem, et sifac, quasi tu excories ipsum: et sit quantitas quae excoriatur quantitas unguis, aut circiter ilud.	Then introduce into that section, and lift your hand with the sponge between the skin, and wipe, as if you are scraping it: and the amount which is scraped shall be equal to the amount of a nail, or about that
Deinde perfora sifac, donec perueniat Spatumile ad locum uacuum: et est locus aquae.	Then pierce the sponge until it reaches the empty place: and that is the place of water
Deinde extrahe ipsum, et intromitte in foramen instrumentum, cuius haec est forma.	Then remove it, and introduce into the opening of the instrument, which has this shape
Et est simile cannulae: fit ex argento, aut aere, aut aurichalco, lene, tersum: cui in inferiori parte sui est foramen paruum, et in lateribus eius sunt tria foramina, duo ab una parte, et unum a parte altera: et facia est extremitas eius incisa, secundum modum incisionis calami, sicut uides: in extremitate eius superiore est armilla.	It is like a cannula: it is made of silver, or of air, or of gold, soft, thin: which has in its lower part a small hole, and in its sides are three holes, two from one side, and one from the other side: and its extremity is cut, according to the manner of a calamus sword, like water: in its extremity is an arm.
Nam quando instrumentum peruenit ad aquam, tunc ipsa descendit statim super instrumentum, ergo euacua ex aqua in hora quantitatem mediam.	When the instrument reaches the water, it immediately descends above the instrument, thus emptying into the water half its quantity.
Quoniam si tu euacuas ex ea plus quam oportet, in hora fortasse moritur infirmus per resolutionem spiritus sui animalis: aut accidit ei syncopis quae appropinquat morti.	If you empty more from it than is necessary, in an hour the patient may die from the collapse of his vital spirit: or there may happen to him fainting, which approaches death.
Verum euacua ex ea secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius, et secundum quod significant tibi dispositiones infirmi ex uirtute pulsus eius, et ex bonitate eius.	Empty it according to the quantity of its virtue, and according to what is significant to you concerning the condition of the patient, and concerning his pulse and his health
Deinde extrahe instrumentum, et retine aquam.	Then withdraw the instrument, and retain the water.
Quod est, quia retinetur statim propter cutem quae retinet foramen quod est super sifac: de quo narraui, ut perfores ipsum secundum illum modum.	Since it remains immediately on account of the skin which retains the opening above the sieve: as I have said, perform it according to the measure.
Deinde itera instrumentum die altero, si uides infirmum tolerare illud: et extrahe etiam ex aqua quantitatem paruam.	Repeat the instrument on the other side, if you find the patient tolerates it: and also from the water the quantity which remains
Fac illud diebus aliquot sine timore, et custodi te ab errore: donec non remaneat ex aqua nisi parum.	Do this a few times without fear, and take care of yourself from error: until there remains from the water little or nothing.
Si autem times super infirmum, et dimittis ex aqua rem multam: tunc cura ipsum cum sepultura in harena calida, et sudore multo in balneo et sole, et expectet super sitim: et cura ipsum cum medicinis exiccatiuis, donec sanetur: et cauteriza super stomachum, et epar, et splenem, post extractionem aquae: secundum quod narraui in eo quod praecessit.	If however you fear the patient, and you discharge from the water a great quantity: then care for him with burial in hot sand, and abundant sweating in bath and sun, and expect upon the seat: and care for him with physicians who are skilled in these matters until he is healed: and cauterize upon the stomach, and the spleen and the liver, after the extraction of the water: as I have said before
¶ De cura infantium qui nascuntur locis urinae eorum non perforatis.	As to the care of infants who are born in places where the urinary opening is not perforated
Caput LV.	(The provided text does not include the continuation of the sentence.)
Quando egreditur aliquis infantium ex uentre matris suae, et caput mutonis eius est non perforatum, aut est foramen strictum, aut in non suo loco.	When anyone of the infants goes out of his mother's womb, and his head is not perforated, or the opening is narrow, or is not in its place.
Oportet ergo succurrere cum perforatione eius statim cum nascitur cum Spatumili subtili ualde, secundum hanc formam.	It is necessary therefore to assist immediately when such a perforation occurs with Spatumili subtili at its base, following this shape.
Deinde pone in foramine clauum subtilem ex plumbo, et liga ipsum: et tene ipsum tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then put in the wound a small lead weight, and bind it: and keep it in place for three days, or four
Quando ergo uult urinam emittere, remoueatur, et mingat.	When it is desired that urine be emitted, remove the weight and mix it together.
Deinde reduc ipsum.	Then reduce it.
Et si tu non ponis plumbum, iam possibile est, ut urina quae incedit super locum, non permittat ipsum claudi.	And if you do not put in lead, it is possible that the urine which flows over the place will not allow it to be closed
Ille autem cuius foramen est strictum, medicatur cum plumbo, sicut diximus, diebus multis, donec amplificetur.	He who has a stricture of the opening is treated with lead, as we have said, for many days, until it becomes dilated.
Illi autem in quibus est foramen in non suo loco, laeduntur.	In those in which the opening is not in its proper place, lead is applied to them.
Quod est, quia ex eis qui nascitur, foramen est apud finem capitis uirgae: quare non potest mingere ad anteriora, donec eleuat uirgam manu sua ad superiora.	For indeed from the part which is born, the opening is at the end of the head of the bladder: wherefore it is not possible to mix forward, until it raises the bladder up above
Neque est ei generatio, propterea, quod sperma non potest peruenire ad matricem secundum rectitudinem: et est aegritudo foeda ualde.	Neither is there any generation, for thus sperm is not able to pass beyond the matrix according to its right line: and it is a grievous wound at the base
Et modus operationis in illo est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum.	And the method of operation in this is that the patient be laid down upon his back
Deinde extende caput uirgae eius manu tua sinistra extensione uehementi, et incide caput capitis uirgae ex loco priapi, cum acumine, aut spatumili acuto: sicut est incisio calami, aut sicut tu radis aliquid, ut medium eius ueniat simile capiti uirgae: et ut cadat foramen in medio secundum quod oportet.	Then extend the head of the bladder with your left hand by means of grasping, and cut the head of the bladder from the root, with a needle, or with a sharp spatula: as is the incision of the marrow, or as you would a root of anything, so that the middle part may come out like the head of the bladder: and that the opening may be in the middle as it should be
Et caue tibi apud operationem tuam a fluxu sanguinis.	And be careful at your operation with regard to the flow of blood.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	Many things happen at this time.
Oppone ergo ei cum eo quod abscindit sanguinem, et cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Oppose it therefore with that which will bind the blood and care for the wound until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
¶ De Albather quae accidunt in praeputio et capite uigae, et corruptione, nigredine, et adhaerentia.	Concerning the ailments of the genitals and head of the hair, and corruption, blackness, and adhesion.</start_of_turn>
Caput LVI.	Chapter 66.</start_of_turn>
Multotiens accidunt istae Albather in uirga, et est eminentia carnis foedae.	Many things happen at this time with regard to these ailments of the body, and it is the prominence of corrupt meat.</start_of_turn
Et ex ea alia est maligna, et alia non maligna.	And from these there are malignant and non-malignant things.</start_of_turn
Non malignam ergo oportet ut suspendas cum uncino subtili, et abscindas eam, donec mundes eam totam.	The malignant one must be suspended with a fine thread and cut off, until the whole thing is freed.</start_of_turn
Deinde pone super eam cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio.	Then place over the cut a soaked bandage in Egyptian unguent.</start_of_turn
Deinde cura ipsum post illud cum unguento dyafinicon, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with a finer unguent until it is healed.</start_of_turn
Quod si Albather est maligna, foedi coloris, tunc oportet ut administres in ea cauterium post incisionem eius et ipsius rasionem.	If the ailment is malignant, of the color of blood, then it is necessary to administer cautery after the incision and according to its reason.</start_of_turn
Si autem Albather est in praeputio captiui, non circumcisi, et est pars Albather inter praeputium, et pars eius extra: tunc oportet ut auferas Albather, quae est intus in primis, donec quando consolidatur, tunc cura ipsum exterius: quoniam quando tu curas eam simul, non securatur praeputium quin preforetur.	If, however, the ailment is in the hair of the head, not cut off, and is part of the ailment that is between the hair and that which is outside: then it is necessary to stimulate the ailment which is inside first, until it is solidified, then care for the outside: for when you care for the outside while neglecting the inside, the hair will be pulled out.</start_of_turn
Et iam accidunt etiam in testiculis, et praeputio nigredo et corruptio.	And also in the testicles, and black hair and corruption.</start_of_turn
Oportet ergo, ut tu concaues totum quod iam denigratum est, et quod uult corrumpi, aut iam corruptum est.	It is necessary therefore to remove everything that is decayed or which wants to corrupt, or which is already corrupted.</start_of_turn
Deinde line super ipsum post illud cum melle quod iam concussum est cum farina corticum granatorum, et herbi tritorum cribellatorum.	Then line above the wound with wax after that which has been consumed with wheat and barley flour, and with trefoil herbs of bellflowers.
Deinde cura illud cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for that with the rest of the treatment until it heals.</start_of_turn>
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra cauterium cum cauterio lunari, secundum hanc formam.	If blood flows, then administer cautery with a lunar cautery, according to this fashion.</start_of_turn>
Cauterium enim est iuuatiuum ad duas dispositiones simul, scilicet ad fluxum sanguinis, et uulnus quando corrumpitur.	Cautery is a substance which has two forms simultaneously, that is, for blood flow and for a wound when corrupted.</start_of_turn>
Quod si corroditur caput uirgae, et destruitur totum in hora: tunc oportet ut intromittas in meatum priapi cannulam ex plumbo, ut mingat infirmus super eam.	If the head of the worm has been corroded, and has been destroyed throughout in an hour: then it is necessary to insert lead into the meat of the wound, so that the disease may be overcome above the wound.</start_of_turn
In adhaerentia uero praeputii cum capite uirgae, et haec quidem adhaerentia non accidit, nisi in eo cuius praeputium est sanum, et non exigitur super ipsum circumcisio: et quandoque accidit adhaerentia propter uulnus, aut apostema: oportet ergo ut excories eam cum Spatumili obtuso, donec soluatur ligamentum, et liberetur caput uirgae ab omni parte.	In the adhesion of the membrane with the head of the worm, and these adhesion do not take place except in that in which the membrane is sound, and does not require cutting above it: and when the adhesion takes place because of the wound, or swelling: it is necessary therefore to scrape away the wound with blunt spatula, until the ligament is dissolved, and the head of the worm is freed from all parts.</start_of_turn
Quod si est difficile discernere ea exquisite, tunc oportet ut excories aliquid ex capite uirgae, et ex praeputio.	If it is difficult to discern these things with great accuracy, then it is necessary to scrape away something from the head of the worm, and from the membrane.</start_of_turn
Quod est, quia praeputium quando est subtile, fortasse perforatur propter subtilitatem suam uelociter.	For the membrane when it is slight, may perhaps be perforated by its subtle nature or more quickly.</start_of_turn
Deinde separa inter praeputium, et caput uirgae cum panno lini subtili, qui iam madefactus est in aqua frigida, ut non adhereant iterum.	Then separate the membrane from the head of the worm with fine linen cloth which has been made wet in cold water, so that they do not adhere again.</start_of_turn
Deinde curetur cum uino stiptico, donec consolidetur.	Then care for it with balsamic wine, until it is solidified.</start_of_turn
¶ De mundificatione infantium, et curatione ex errore eis accidente.	Concerning the restoration of children, and the treatment of errors caused by an accident.
Caput LVII.	Concerning the restoration of children, and the treatment of errors caused by an accident.
Circumcisio non est solutio continuitatis, sicut reliqua uulnera: uerumtamen cum sit ex operatione nostra, uoluntate nostra, et usus eius sit in pueris proprie, est necesse ut signemus in ea operationem meliorem, et uiam leuiorem perducentem ad salutem.	Circumcision is not a solution for continuity, like the rest of the wounds: indeed when it is from our operation, our will, and the circumstances are in the children themselves, it is necessary that we mark in them the operation which is better, and the degree of pain which is lost in order to the welfare.
Dico ergo, quod antiqui non dixerunt circumcisionem in aliquo suorum librorum: quoniam non utuntur in legibus suis, et non est nisi quod acquisiuimus per experimentum.	I say, therefore, that the ancients did not speak of circumcision in any of their books: because they did not use it in their practice, and it is not except what we have learned through experience
Quod est, quia ego inueni maiorem partem artificum, et phlebotomatorum uti mundificatione, circumcidendo cum nouacula, et cum forficibus: et utuntur alfecati, et ligaudo cum filo, et incisione cum ungula.	Because I have found that a greater part of the artifices, and phlebotomists use circumcision for restoration, by cutting with a needle and with shears: and they use alate instruments, and ligature with thread, and incision with a nail.
Et ego quidem iam probaui omnes istos modos, et non inueni meliorem mundificatione cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo.	And indeed I have proved all these methods, and I have not found a better restoration than with shears, and ligation with thread.
Quoniam in mundificatione cum nouacula, multotiens effugit cutis.	Because in restoration with a needle, much skin is driven away.
Quoniam cutis praeputii duas habet tunicas: ergo forsitan inciditur cutis superior, et temanet tunica inferior: cogitur ergo ad incisionem ad incidendum alteram, et dolorem futurum.	Because the skin of the prepuce has two tunics: therefore perhaps the upper skin is incsed, and the lower tunic is threatened: it is necessary therefore to make an incision in order to incsed the other, and to prevent future pain
Et cum mundificatione quae fit per alfecati, id est, digitalis, quo utuntur sutores, non securatur incisio extremitatis uirilis membri: quoniam fortasse ingreditur in foramen eius.	And when restoration is made with alate instruments, that is, digits, as the surgeons use them, the incision of the extremity of the limb is not secured: because perhaps it enters into its foramen.
In mundificatione autem cum ungula, fortasse euadit ferrum, et corrumpit operationem tuam: et cutis quidem pueri est breuis natura, et multotiens nascuntur taliter, quod non indigent mundificatione: et iam uidi illud.	In restoration with a nail, perhaps the iron will go through, and corrupt your operation: and the skin of the child is short of nature, and many are born like this, which does not become an obstacle to restoration: and I have seen this.
Mundificationis autem cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo, bonum experimentum detexit mihi: quoniam forfices sunt proportionalis incisionis: propterea, quod acuitas quae est superius, est sicut acuitas quae est inferius.	The use of scissors and ligature with thread proved to be a successful experiment: for it has been observed that the sharpness of the upper incision corresponds to the sharpness of the lower incision.
Cum ergo premis manum tuam, proportionantur duae acuitates, et incidunt secundum operationem unam in tempore uno: et fit compressio simili figura, continens cutem uirgae ab omni parte, cum qua non cadit error omnino.	As you have done before, join your hands together: for the two sharpness are proportional, and they are cut according to the work of one in the same time: and there is a similar compression of the figure, containing the skin from every part, so that no error is made at all
Et modus operationis propriae est, ut facias extimare, puerum praecipue, si est ex eis qui intelligunt parumper, quod tu non facis, nisi quod ligas filum in uirga sua tantum: et dimittas ipsum usque ad diem alium.	The manner of the work itself is as follows: you must make an estimate, especially of the boys, for they are mostly stupid; for you will not do anything without tying the thread in its own place: and you shall let it go until tomorrow.
Deinde fac eum gaudere et laetari omnimodo quo possibile est tibi illud, ex eo quod recipit intelligentia sua.	Then make him rejoice and be glad in every way that you can; for from this you will receive intelligence.
Deinde fac eum stare inter manus tuas praeparatae staturae, et non sit sedens: et occulta forfices in manica tua, aut sub pede tuo, ne uideat eos puer omnino, neque aliquid ex instrumentis.	Then make him stand between your prepared hands of the stature, and do not sit: and hide the scissors in your sleeve or under your foot, so that the boys do not see them, nor anything of the instruments.
Deinde intromitte manum tuam ad uirgam eius, et suffla in cutem, et trahe eam sursum, donec egrediatur caput uirgae.	Then insert your hand into the wound and blow into the skin, and pull it up, until the head of the wound is expelled.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex eo quod aggregatur in ea sordicie.	Then cleanse the same from that which is gathered in that dirt
Deinde liga locum signatum cum filo duplo.	Then ligate the marked place with double thread.
Postea liga inferius eo parumper ligamentum secundum.	Then ligate the lower part somewhat more tightly than the upper ligament.
Deinde tene cum indice tuo, et pollice locum ligamenti inferioris retentione bona, et incide inter duo ligamenta.	Then hold with your index finger and thumb the place of the lower ligament firmly, and cut between the two ligatures.
Deinde eleua cutem sursum uelociter, et extrahe caput uirgae.	Then raise the skin up quickly and remove the head of the wound
Deinde dimitte sanguinem currere paulatim (est enim melius) et pone puluerem desuper: et super puluerem pannum in quo expansus est uitellus oui decocti in aqua rosata, concussum cum oleo ros recenti bono: et dimitte eum super ipsum usque ad diem alium: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then discharge the blood slowly (for it is better thus) and apply powder above: and above the powder put a bag in which is expanded the testicle or decocted in rosewater, pounded with recent olive oil: and discharge it upon itself until the next day: and care for the rest of the treatment until it is healed.
Forma autem forficis ad mundificationem haec est.	The form of the forceps for these applications is as follows.</start_of_turn>
Sint hebetes duae extremitates, et sint incidentes: ne egrediatur in eis ramus claui: et sit longitudo duarum acuitatum, sicut longitudo duorum manubriorum aequaliter.	There are two handles, and two joints: do not let the handle protrude into the thumb: and let the length of the two equal the length of two fingers together.</start_of_turn>
Error uero cadens in mundificatione est: quoniam fortasse effugit cutis intrinseca tota, aut pars eius apud incisionem.	The real danger in these procedures is that the skin may escape entirely from the underlying parts or a part of it from the incision.</start_of_turn
Ergo oportet, ut extendas eam ex hora tua cum ungue tuo ante apostemationem loci: et incidas eam secundum aequalitatem.	Therefore one must stretch the part from your hour hand with your thumb before the retraction of the place: and cut according to the equality.</start_of_turn
Quod si non potes tenere eam cum ungue tuo, tunc extrahe eam cum uncino, et incide eam.	If you are unable to hold the part with your thumb, then extract it with the index finger, and cut.</start_of_turn
Si autem praeterierint ei tres dies, et remanet quod est sub uirga inflatum, apostematum: tunc dimitte illud, donec sedetur apostema calidum, et excoria illud cum facilitate, et incide illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi: et caue tibi a capite uirgae.	If, however, after three days, there remains that which is under the swelling inflated, retract it: then discharge that, until the swelling becomes soft, and extirpate that with ease, and cut it according to what is prepared for you: and take care of yourself from the head of the swelling.</start_of_turn
Non enim nocebit ei illud.	It will not cause it any harm.</start_of_turn>
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod consolidat uulnus ex pulueribus, quos narrauimus in tractatu de pulueribus: et si inciditur ex cute supra mensuram, et euadit ad superiora, non nocet ei illud etiam.	Care for it as we have said in the treatise on powders: and if it happens from the skin above the measure, and comes up to the upper parts, it does not harm it.</start_of_turn
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod diximus, donec sanetur.	Care for it as we have said until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
¶ De extractione Vrinae retentae in uesica.	On the extraction of the retained urine from the bladder.
Caput LVIII.	On the extraction of the retained urine from the bladder.
Urinae retentio in uesica, fit ab opilatione facta ex lapide, aut sanguine congelato, aut pus, aut carne nata, et similibus illis ex eis quae diximus ex modis curationis in diuisione.	The retention of urine in the bladder is made by a stone, or frozen blood, or pus, or flesh born, or like these things which we mentioned in the method of treatment of dropsy.
Et si non soluitur Vrina, et uides retentionem eius esse propter Lapidem, qui iam est in collo uesicae: tunc oportet ut sit infirmus super genua sua curuatus.	And if the urine is not solved, and the cause of its retention is the stone which is in the neck of the bladder: then it must be made infirm over its knee joint
Deinde componantur pedes eius super dorsum eius, et extendat uentrem suum ex superiori parte dorsi eius, et stringat infirmus anhelitum suum quantum possibile est ei.	Then they must be put on the knee of its thigh, and its belly must be pulled out from its upper part of the back, and the infirm must be held together as much as possible for him
Cogitur ergo cum collo uesicae ad expulsionem Lapidis ad posteriora: quare absoluitur Vrina.	It is thought therefore when the neck of the bladder is brought to the back: the stone will be expelled from behind: which will empty the urine
Quod si non soluitur cum eo quod diximus, et uehemens sit res super infirmum: tunc oportet ut administres extractionem eius cum instrumento, quod nominatur siringa, cuius haec est forma Sit ex argento, et sit subtile, lene, concauum sicut cannula pennae auis in subtilitate radii, longum in similitudine palmi unius et medii: cui sit cannula subtilis in capite eius.	And if it is not solved in this way, and if there remains something over the infirm: then it must be administered the extraction with an instrument called a siringa, which is made of silver, is subtle, flexible, curved like the quill of a bird in the smoothness of a radius, long like a palm of one and a half: to which there is a fine needle at its head
Et modus exitus Vrinae per ipsum est, ut accipias filum duplicatum, et liges in extremitate eius lanam, aut cotum, ligatura bona: et intromittas extremitatem fili in inferiori parte Siringae: et incide cum forficibus si superfluit aliquid ex lana, uerum intromitte in cannulam cum uehementia, sicut alzer.	And the method of extracting the urine is as follows: take a doubled thread and bind in its extremity yarn or hair, a good ligation: and insert the extremity of the thread into the lower part of the siringa: and pierce with scissors if anything remains of the yarn, but truly insert into the needle with expectation, like a tailor.
Deinde inunge siringam cum oleo, aut cum butyro, et albugine oui: et fac sedere infirmum super sedem, et embroca uesicam, et ipsius uirgam cum oleis humidis, et oleo oliuae, et aqua tepida.	Then wash the siringa with oil, or butter, and alum: and make the infirm sit over a seat, and support the bladder, and hold the urine with oil of olive and warm water.
Deinde intromitte siringam in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat ad radicem uirgae.	Then insert the needle through the flesh easily until it reaches the root of the wound.
Deinde dupla ipsam superius a parte umbilici.	Then double the thread above the navel area
Deinde impelle siringam intra ipsam, donec perueniat ad Vesicam, et sentiat eam infirmus iam peruenisse ad rem uacuam: et non fit hoc secundum hunc ordinem, nisi quoniam meatus, in quo uadit, est in quo est tortuositas.	Then push the needle inside itself until it reaches the bladder, and let the patient feel that it has reached the painful area: this is not done in accordance with this order, except when the tissue in which it goes is twisted
Deinde extende filum cum lana paulatim.	Then draw out the thread gradually with the lancet.
Vrina enim sequetur lanam.	The thread follows the lancet in its path
Deinde extrahe eam, et fac currere Vrinam per uiam urinae: et itera siringam, et non cesses facere illud, donec euacuetur uesica, et inueniat infirmus alleuiationem.	Then draw out the needle, and let the urine flow through the hole: repeat the needle and do not stop doing this until the bladder is emptied and the patient feels relief
¶ De qualitate clisterizationis uesicae cum Clepshydra.	As for the quality of the bladder when using Clepshydra
Caput LIX.	Chapter 59
Quando accidit in uesica ulcus, aut sanguis in ea congelatur, aut coartatur in ea pus, et uis distillare in eam aquas et medicinas: tunc fiat cum instrumento quod nominatur Clepshydra, et haec est forma eius.	When there is an ulcer in the bladder, or when blood is frozen in it, or when pus is formed in it, and the urine is discoloured in the urine and the blood, then use the instrument called Clepshydra, and this is its shape
Est enim surda, id est, clausa.	It is dull, that is, closed
Et in eo sunt tria foramina, duo ex parte una, et unum ex parte altera, sicut uides.	And in it there are three holes, two from one side and one from the other, like water-spouts.
Et locus concauus, in quo est illud quod impellit, sit secundum quantitatem quod opilet ipsum sine additione, donec quando trahitur cum eo aliquid, ex humiditatibus attrahatur: et quando impellitur, cum eo expellatur ad longinquum: secundum quod facit clepshydra, qua proiicitur naphta, id est, ignis graecus in praeliis martis.	And the concaved place where the needle enters should be according to the quantity of what you wish to draw out without addition, until when it is pulled with that, something is attracted from the humilities: and when it is pushed out, when that is expelled to the end: according to what the Clepshydra does, which ejects oil, that is, Greek fire in battlefields
Cum ergo uis proiicere humiditates in uesicam, intromitte extremitatem clepshydrae in humiditatem, et trahe cum eo quod impellit ad superiora, humiditas enim trahitur in concauitatem clepshydrae.	When anything is thrown towards the cavity of the eye, introduce the extremity of the eyelid into the moisture, and draw it up with what drives it upwards, the moisture is drawn into the concavity of the eyelid.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem eius in uirgam, secundum quod narrauimus in siringa.	Then introduce the extremity of the eyelash into the eye, as we have said in the preceding section
Deinde impelle humiditatem cum eo quod impellit illa namque humiditas peruenit ad uesicam statim, ita quod sentit eam infirmus.	Then drive the moisture with what drives it, and immediately the moisture returns to the cavity of the eye.
Forma clisteris subtilis quo clisterizatur uesica.	Form a fine spray that moistens the eye.
Fiat ex argento, aut auricalco: cuius caput altius sit simile alcama paruo, et sub eo sinus inter quem cadat ligamentum.	It is made from silver or gold: whose head is higher like a small bowl, and under it the sinus where the ligament rests.</start_of_turn>
Deinde accipe uesicam arietis, et pone in ea humiditatem, qua uis clisterizare uesicam.	Then take the eye of an ass, and put in it the moisture which will moisten the eye.</start_of_turn
Deinde liga eam inter duos sinus ligatura forti cum filo duplo: et calefac illam humiditatem parumper super ignem.	Then bind the two sinuses together with a strong ligature with a double thread: and warm up the moisture over fire.</start_of_turn>
Deinde intromitte extremitatem clisteris in uirgam, postea stringe manum tuam super uesicam cum humiditate strictura decenti, donec sentiat infirmus, quod illa humiditas iam peruenit ad uesicam.	Then introduce the extremity of the spray into the eye, afterwards draw your hand over the eye with the moisture tightly bound downwards, until the patient feels that the moisture has returned to the eye.</start_of_turn
Si autem non est tibi praesens uesica, tunc accipe frustum pergameni, et fac ex eo circulum, et perfora ipsum ab omni rotunditate sua.	If however the eye is not present, then take a piece of gut and make a circle from it, and pierce it through from all its roundness.</start_of_turn>
Deinde intromitte filum forte in illis foraminibus, sicut reuoluuntur.	Then introduce a strong thread into these holes, so that they resemble a ring.</start_of_turn
Deinde aggrega circulum, sicut aggregatur alsofratu: postquam tu ponis in eo illud quod uis ex humiditatibus, et oleis, et aquis.	Then gather the ring, so that it resembles a ball of felt: when you put in it the moisture, oil and water.</start_of_turn
Deinde liga ipsum in instrumento: et fac cum eo sicut fecisti cum uesica ex expressione cum manu tua, donec perueniat humiditas ad uesicam.	Then bind it with an instrument: and do it like you did when expressing with your hand, until the moisture returns to the eye.</start_of_turn
¶ De extractione Lapidis.	On the extraction of the stone.
Caput LX.	On the extraction of the stone.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Lapidis, et curationem eius cum medicinis: et dixi differentiam inter Lapidem generatum in renibus, et uesica, et signa illius totius: et dixi Lapidem in quo cadit operatio cum manu et sectio: et est Lapis generatus in uesica proprie: et ille qui figitur in uirga: et ego sum narrans illud cum expositione manifesta et abbreuiatione.	We have already spoken concerning the varieties of stones and their treatment by physicians: and we have mentioned the difference between the stone which is formed in the bowels and the stone which is formed in the bladder: and the signs of the former. And we have mentioned the operation which is performed with the hand and the incision: and that the stone which is formed in the bladder itself: and that which is found in the kidney: and I will now speak of these with manifest explanation and brevity.
Dico ergo, quod Lapis generatus in uesica, plurimum accidit pueris.	I say therefore, that the stone which is formed in the bladder chiefly happens to children.
Et ex signis eius est, quod urina egreditur ex uesica similis aquae in subtilitate sua: et apparet in ea harena alba, et fricat infirmus uirgam suam, et laborat cum ea, et multotiens pendet.	And from the signs of the latter it is evident that the urine comes out of the bladder like water in its substance: and there appears in it white sand, and it causes the sick kidney to ache, and it works with it, and suffers many things with it
Deinde erigitur, et egreditur cum eo anus in multis eorum.	Then it is raised up, and comes out with it in many people.
Et est facilis sanatio puerorum, ex eo usquequo consequuntur quatuordecim annos.	And the recovery of children from this is easy, until the age of fourteen years is completed
Et est difficilis in senibus.	And it is difficult in old age.
In iuuenibus autem est media, in eo quod est inter illud: et eius cuius Lapis est maior, curatio facilior: et si paruus, est econuerso illius cura.	In young people, however, it is middle-aged: and in this lies the reason: and if it is small, the care of it is less expensive
Cum ergo peruenimus ad curationem, oportet in primis, ut mundificemus infirmum cum clisteri, quod extrahat totum stercus quod est in intestinis suis: ipsum enim quandoque prohibet inuentionem Lapidis apud inquisitionem.	When therefore we come to the treatment, it is necessary in the first place to purge the sick person with a clister, which removes all the stool which is in his intestines: for this indeed often hinders the finding of the stone during the investigation
Deinde accipiatur infirmus cum pedibus suis, et concutiatur, et moueatur ad inferiora: ut descendat Lapis ad profundum uesicae, aut saliat de loco alto aliquotiens.	Then the patient should be taken with his feet, and struck, and moved downwards: so that the stone may descend to the bottom of the bladder, or go out from its high place in some other way
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas praeparatum, et manus eius sint sub coxis ipsius, ut fiat uesica tota decliuis ad inferiora.	Then make him sit with his hands prepared between yours, and let his hands rest under his buttocks, so that the entire belly will slope downwards to the lower parts.
Deinde perquire eum, et tange eum extrinsecus.	Then ask him and touch him externally.
Si ergo sentis Lapidem in spacio, tunc propera statim cum sectione super ipsum.	If you feel a stone in the space, then immediately hold it with the section above it.
Quod si non cadat sub tactu tuo omnino, tunc oportet ut abstergas digitum indicem cum oleo manus sinistrae, si infirmus est puer: aut digitum medium si est iuuenis completus: et intromittas ipsum in anum suum, et perquire de Lapide, donec stat sub digito tuo: et conuerte eum paulatim ad collum uesicae.	If it does not fall under your touch at all, then you must remove the index finger of the left hand if the patient is a child: or the middle finger if the patient is an adult: and insert it into the belly until you feel the stone: and ask about the stone until it rests under your finger: and gradually bring it to the bottom of the belly
Deinde preme super ipsum cum digito tuo, et impelle ipsum ad exteriora aduersus locus, cuius sectionem uis: et praecipe ministro, ut premat uesicam manu sua, et praecipe alii ministro, ut extendat testiculos manu sua dextra ad superiora: et alia manu sua, ut remoueat cutem, quae est sub testiculis in parte a loco in quo est sectio.	Then press above it with your finger, and push it outwards against the place where the section was made: and command the minister to grasp the belly of the patient and command another minister to stretch out the testicles of the right hand upwards: and another minister to move the skin which is under the testicles in the part from the place where the section was made
Deinde intromitte Spatumile incidens, cuius forma haec est.	Then insert the sponge which is incident to the wound, which has this shape
Et finde in eo quod est inter anum et testiculos, et non in medio, ad latus natis sinistrae: et sit sectio super ipsum lapidem, et digitus tuus sit in ano: et fiat sectio transuersa, ut sit sectio exterius ampla, et interius stricta, secundum quantitatem quod sit possibile egressio Lapidis ex ea non maior.	And find in it what is between the belly and the testicles, and not in the middle, towards the left side of the navel: and let the section be above the stone, and your finger be in the rectum: and make a transverse section, so that the external section is wide and the internal section is narrow, as much as is possible to allow the escape of the stone from it
Fortasse enim comprimit digitus, qui est in ano Lapidem apud sectionem, et egreditur absque difficultate.	Perhaps the finger which is in the rectum will be compressed by the stone at the section and will come out without difficulty.
Et scias, quod ex Lapide est cui sunt anguli et margines, quare fit difficilis exitus eius propter illud.	And you know that the stone has angles and margins, because of which its exit is difficult
Et ex eo est lenis, similis glandulae, et rotundus: et fit facilis egressus eius.	And from this one [a sponge] it is soft, like a gland, and rounded: and it easily escapes its exit.
Ei ergo cui sunt anguli, et margines, adde in fissura.	And to it [the sponge] are added angles and margins to the fissure.
Quod si non egreditur ita, tunc oportet ut ingenies super ipsum: aut stringas super eum cum gesti decenter, cuius extremitas sit sicut Luna, quae stringat super Lapidem, et non euadat ab ea: aut ut intromittas sub eo instrumentum subtile, curuatae extremitatis.	If it does not come out thus, then it is necessary that you introduce something above it: or that you bind it above it with a handle whose extremity is like the Moon, which binds over the Stone, and does not slip from it: or that you introduce under it an instrument which is flexible at its extremity
Si autem non potes super cum, tunc amplifica foramen parumper.	If it does not come out altogether, then widen the opening a little
Quod si uincit te aliquid ex sanguine, abscinde ipsum cum zegi.	If anything bloodstained comes to your hand, cut it off with a saw
Si uero lapis est plus quam unus, tunc impelle in primis magnum ad os uesicae.	If there are more than one stone, then drive the great one first into the os vesiculae
Deinde incide super ipsum.	Then break over the rest of them
Postea impelle paruum post illud: et similiter fac si sunt plures duobus.	Then drive in the small ones after these: and do the same if there are more than two.
Quod si magnus est ualde, tunc ignorantia est ut seces super ipsum sectione magna.	If the great one is round, then ignorance is that you should cut it through with a great section
Quoniam accidit infirmo una duarum rerum, aut ut moriatur, aut accidit ei distillatio urinae assidua: proptera, quia non consolidatur locus omnino.	For it often happens to a sickly man of two things, either that he should die, or that his urine becomes excessively concentrated: because the place is not solidified in any way.
Verum administra expulsionem eius, donec egrediatur: aut ingenia in fractura eius cum forficibus, donec extrahas eum frustatim.	Truly administer the expulsion of it, until it goes out: or introduce it into a fracture of it with forceps, until you have extracted it frustrated
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc imple uulnus thure, et aloe, et sanguine draconis: et stringe ipsum, et pone super ipsum pannum infusum oleo et uino, aut oleo rosato, et aqua frigida: ut sedetur apostema calidum.	When you have completed your operation, then apply a tourniquet, and aloe, and dragon's blood: and bind it up, and place over it a soaked sponge of oil and wine, or oil of roses, and cold water: so that the swelling will subside
Deinde resupina infirmum super collum suum, et non soluas ligamentum, usque ad diem tertium.	Then rest the patient supine above his limb, and do not strain the ligaments, until the third day.
Cum ergo solueris ipsum, embroca locum cum aqua, et oleo multo.	When you have finished stretching it, bandage the place with water, and wash it with much soap.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dyafinicon, et unguento basilicon, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with oil of rue and oil of basil, until it is healed.
Si autem accidit in uulnere apostema calidum additum, et corrosi, et illi similia: sicut si congeletur sanguis in uesica, et prohibeatur ex eo urina: et cognoscitur illud ex egressione sanguinis cum urina.	If, however, in the wound a piece of chalk has been added, and is corroded, and similar things: thus also if blood is congealed in the bladder, and is withheld from it: this is known from the emission of blood with urine.
Intromitte ergo digitum tuum in uulnus, et extrahe illum sanguinem.	Introduce your finger into the wound, and extract the blood clot.
Nam si remanet, prouocat ad corruptionem uesicae, et putrefactionem eius.	For if it remains, it causes corruption of the bladder, and its putrefaction.
Deinde ablue uulnus cum aceto, et aqua, et sale: et oppone omni speciei cum eo quod conuenit ex curatione, usquequo sanetur.	Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt: and oppose all kinds of things with which it agrees for its healing, until it is healed.
Et oportet in horis curationis totius, ut liges duas coxas, et aggreges, caussa medicinarum quae ponuntur super locum.	And it is necessary in the course of the treatment of the whole thing, that you bind up the two thighs, and keep them together, because of the physicians who place things on the place
Quod si lapis est paruus, et sit in meatu uirgae, et figitur in eo, et prohibetur urinae exitus: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod narro antequam peruenias ad sectionem.	Because if the stone is small, and is in the cavity of the bladder, and is fixed in it, and hinders the exit of urine: then care for it with that which I mentioned before you reach the section
Multotiens enim a sectione excusaris per hanc curationem, iam enim probaui illud.	Many therefore excuse themselves from the section for this treatment, because I prove that it is useful
Et est, ut accipias Perforatorium ex ferro alferico, cuius haec est forma, triangulatae extremitatis, acutum, fixum in ligno.	And it is that you take a Perforatorium of iron, which has this form, triangular extremities, acute, fixed on wood.
Deinde accipe filum, et liga cum eo uirgam sub lapide ut non redeat ad uesicam.	Then take thread, and bind with it the bladder under the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.
Deinde intromitte ferrum perforans in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat Perforatorium ad ipsum lapidem: et reuolue Perforatorium manu tua in ipso lapide paulatim: et coneris perforationem eius, donec facias ipsum penetrare a parte altera.	Then insert the perforating iron into the abscess with ease, until it reaches the perforation: and withdraw the perforation gradually from the stone: and make the perforation whole, until you cause it to penetrate from the other side.
Urina namque absoluitur statim.	The urine immediately ceases to flow.
Deinde preme manum tuam super illud quod remansit ex lapide ab exteriori parte uirgae.	Then place your hand over what remains of the abscess from the outside of the cavity
Ipse enim frangitur, et egreditur cum urina, et sanatur infirmus.	It will itself break and come out with the urine, and the patient will be healed.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi haec curatio, propter aliquid quod prohibet ab illo: tunc liga filum sub lapide, et filum aliud supra lapidem.	But if this cure is not prepared, because of some other thing: then bind a thread under the stone and a thread above the stone.
Deinde seca super lapidem in ipsa uirga inter duas ligaturas.	Then dry over the stone within the abscess between the two ligatures
Deinde extrahe ipsum.	Then remove it.
Postea solue ligamentum, et mundifica sanguinem congelatum, qui fit in uulnere.	Then loosen the ligature, and bind the frozen blood, which is in the wound
Et non est necessarium ligamentum fili sub lapide, nisi ut non redeat ad uesicam: et ligamentum aliud desuper, nisi ut quando soluitur filum post egressionem lapidis, redeat cutis ad locum suum, et cooperiat uulnus: et propter illud necesse est tibi illud quando ligas filum superius, ut eleues cutem ad superiora, ut redeat apud complementum tuum, et cooperiat uulnus, sicut diximus.	And it is not necessary to bind a thread under the stone, except that it does not go back into the cavity: and the other thread you remove when you draw out the stone, except that when you loosen the thread after the evacuation of the stone, the skin returns to its place, and coapts the wound: and for this reason it is necessary for you to bind the upper thread, so that you lift the skin upwards, so that it returns to its proper place, and coapts the wound, as we have said
¶ De extractione Lapidis mulierum.	Of the extraction of a stone from a woman
Caput LXI.	Chapter 61.
Parum generatur Lapis in mulieribus.	Stones are not easily generated in women
Si autem accidat alicui earum lapis, tunc difficilis est curatio, et prohibetur propter modos multos.	If, however, it should happen to one of them that a stone should occur, then the cure is difficult, and is prohibited because of the many ways (of treating it
Vnus eorum est: quod mulier fortasse est uirgo.	One of them is: a woman may possibly be a man.
Et secundus est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem quae detegat seipsam medico, quando est casta, aut ex habentibus maritos.	Secondly, you will not find a woman who confesses herself to a doctor when she is a virgin, or married
Tertius est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem bene scientem hanc artem, praecipue operationem cum manu.	Thirdly, you will not find a woman who is well-versed in this art, especially in performing operations with the hand
Et quartus est longinquitas a loco lapidis: quare indiget sectione profunda, et in illo est timor.	Lastly, the distance from the stone place is great: where a deep incision is needed, and there is fear.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad illud, tunc oportet ut accipias mulierem medicam, bene scientem: et parum inuenitur.	If necessity compels you to reach that, then you must take a female doctor who is well-versed in this: and they are rarely found.
Si uero priuaris ea, tunc quaere medicum castum, subtilem, et praesenta mulierem obstetricem bene doctam in re mulierum, aut mulierem quae in hac arte innuit partem artis: fac ergo eam praesentem, et praecipue ei, ut faciat totum quod praecipis ei ex inquisitione super lapidem.	If you wish to do this, then seek a chaste and discreet doctor, and present a skilled female midwife who is well-versed in women's matters, or a woman who has learned a part of this art: make her present and especially inform her of the matter concerning the stone
In primis quod est, ut aspiciat si mulier est uirgo: tunc oportet ut intromittat digitum in anum eius, et quaerat lapidem.	Firstly, that she is a woman: then you must insert your finger into her belly and search for the stone.
Si ergo inuenit ipsum, coartet eum sub digito suo, et tunc praecipe obstetrici, ut intromittat digitum suum in uuluam infirmae, et inquirat super lapidem, postquam ponit manum suam sinistram super uesicam, et comprimit eam compressione bona.	If you find it, grasp it under your finger and then tell the midwife to insert your finger into the lower belly of the patient, and inquire about the stone after you have placed your left hand on the flank and pressed firmly
Si ergo inuenit lapidem, tunc oportet ut gradatim moueat eum ab orificio uesicae ad inferiora cum summa uirtutis suae, donec perueniat cum eo ad radicem coxae.	If you find the stone, then you must gradually move it from the opening of the uterus towards the lower parts with all your skill, until you have brought it down to the root of the hip bone
Deinde secet super eum apud oppositionem medietatis uuluae apud radicem coxae, ex quacunque parte praeparatur ei, et sentit lapidem in illa parte: et digitus eius non remoueatur a lapide, coartans sub eo: et sit sectio parua in primis.	Then cut above it at the middle of the belly, from whichever side is convenient for you, and feel the stone in that place: do not move your finger from the stone, holding it under its surface: and make a small incision at first.
Deinde intromittat radium super illam sectionem.	Then he introduces radium through the opening.
Si ergo sentit lapidem, tunc addat in sectionem secundum quantitatem proportionatam quod lapis egreditur ab ea.	If he feels a stone, then he adds to the section an amount proportional to the quantity of the stone that protrudes from it.
Et scias, quod species lapidis sunt multae.	And you know that there are many kinds of stones
Ex his enim est paruus, et magnus, lenis et asper, longus, et rotundus habens ramos.	Of these, there is the small one, the large one, the soft one and the rough one, the long one and the round one with a branch
Scias ergo species eius, ut significetur tibi per hoc super illud quod uis.	You know therefore the kind of these, so that you may understand this which is told you about it.
Si ergo uincit te sanguis, tunc adde in loco zegi tritum, et tene ipsum hora una, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If there is blood flow, then add to the place of the wound some absorbent material, and hold it for an hour, until the blood is stopped
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis: et fac, ut praepares tecum ex instrumentis, quae dixi in extractione lapidis in uiris, ut adiuueris per ea in operatione tua.	Then return to your operation until the stone comes out: and make sure that you have prepared with the instruments which I mentioned for the extraction of the stone from the bladder, so that you may help with these in your operation.
Quod si uincit te fluxus sanguinis, et scis quod expulsio sanguinis est ex arteria quae incisa est: tunc pone puluerem super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis strictura decenti: et non mutes illud: et dimitte lapidem, et non extrahas ipsum.	If there is a flow of blood, and you know that the evacuation of blood is from the artery that was cut: then put powder on the place, and bind it with thread of moderate size: and do not move it: and let out the stone, and do not pull it out
Fortasse enim morietur mulier infirma.	Perhaps the woman is weak.
Deinde cura uulnus.	Then take care of the wound.
Cum ergo sedatur acuitas sanguinis post dies, et putrefit locus, tune redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis.	When the pain of the blood has subsided after a few days, and the place has become rotten, then return to your operation until the stone comes out
¶ De sectione suiper Herniam aquosam.	About the cutting of the hernia of water
Caput LXII.	Chapter 62
Ramex aquosa non est, nisi aggregatio humiditatis in sifac albo, quod est sub cute testiculi continente ouum: et nominatur sifac.	A water-bag is not a hernia, except for the collection of moisture in a white sack, which is under the testicles containing semen: and it is called a hernia
Et quandoque est in panniculo proprio sibi, quem praeparauit ei natura in parte oui, donec putetur: quod est ouum aliud, et est cutis testiculi inter sifac album, quod diximus: et non fit illud nisi raro.	And when it is within the belly itself, which the nature has prepared for it in part, until it is forced out: for that is something else, and is the skin of the testicles between the fat.
Et generatio quidem huius ramicis, est ex debilitate quae accidit testiculis: quare effunditur ad eos haec materia.	And the generation of these seeds is from the weakness which happens to the testicles: for it flows out from them to these matters.
Et quandoque accidit ex percussione super testiculos.	And when it happens from a blow upon the testicles.
Et haec humiditas est habens colores multos.	And this moisture has many colors.
Aut enim est color eius decliuis ad citrinitatem, aut est sanguineus rubeus, aut faeculentus, niger, aut est aquosus albus, et est illud quod est plus.	Or it is of the color of the decline towards citrine, or it is reddish-bloody, or greenish, black, or white watery, and that is the most
Et signa quibus scitur ubi sit aggregatio aquae, sunt ista.	And the signs by which one knows where the collection of water is, are these.
Nam si est in sifac albo quod diximus, tunc apostema est rotundum ad longitudinem parumper sicut figura oui: et non apparet testiculus, quoniam humiditas continet eum ab omni parte.	For if it is in the white fat that we have mentioned, then the swelling is round to the length like the figure of a hand: and the testicle does not appear, because the moisture contains it from every side
Et si est humiditas in panniculo proprio sibi, tunc apostema est rotundum cum parte oui, et propter hoc extimat homo quia est ouum aliud.	And if it is in the belly itself, then the swelling is round with a part like a hand, and for this reason the man knows that it is something else.
Et si humiditas est inter cutem testiculorum et sifac album, tunc cadit sub sensu.	And if the moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the white fat, then it falls under the skin.
Quando ergo uis cognitionem coloris humiditatis, tunc experire colorem humiditatis in apostemate cum Intromisso quadrato, cuius forma praecessit.	When therefore one knows the color of the moisture, then to experience the color of the moisture in the swelling with an introduced square whose form has preceded.
Secundum illud ergo quod egreditur in uestigio Intromissi, iudica de illo quod est inter ipsum.	According to that therefore which proceeds from the evidence of the introduction, judge concerning that which is between them
Cum ergo uenimus ad curationem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, ut phlebotometur si possibile est ei illud, et uides corpus eius plenum.	When therefore we come to the treatment with iron, then it is necessary to take away from the sick person what is superfluous, that is, to perform a phlebotomy if it is possible for him, and to strengthen the body of him
Deinde resupinetur super dorsum suum super rem altam parum, et pone sub eo pannos multos.	Then the thing rests upon its back above the high thing slightly, and put under it many patches.
Deinde sede tu super sinistram eius, et praecipe ministro, ut sedeat a dextra eius, qui extendat uirgam eius ad unum duorum laterum cutis testiculorum, et ad partem mirach uentris.	Then sit to its left and command the attendant to sit to its right, who will extend the organ to one of the two sides of the skin of the testicles, and to the part near the navel.
Deinde accipe spatumile latum, et seca cutem testiculorum ex medio per longitudinem, usque prope pectinem: et fiat sectio secundum rectitudinem aequedistantis lineae quae diuidit cutem testiculorum, donec perueniat ad sifac album comprehendens: et excoria ipsum et obserua, uel caue ex hoc, ut seces ipsum: et sit excoriatio tua qua ipsum excorias, ex parte quae suspenditur cum ouo plus: et subtiliter scrutare cum excoriatione secundum quantitatem quod tibi possibile est.	Then take a broad sponge, and dry the testicles from the middle along their length, until near the navel: and make an incision according to the rule of an equidistant line that divides the skin of the testicles, until it reaches the white membrane surrounding it: and scrape it off and observe, or cut it out directly, as you please: and take off your own skin which hangs down with the testicles: and scrape cautiously with the scraping as much as you are able.</start_of_turn>
Deinde perfora sifac plenum aqua perforatione ampla, et extrahe totam aquam.	Then pierce the full bladder with a wide perforation, and extract all the water.</start_of_turn>
Deinde separa inter duo labia sectionis cum uncinis, et extende sifac ad superiora, et non tangas cutem testiculorum comprehendentem: et incide sifac qualitercunque est possibile tibi incidere ipsum, aut cum totalitate sua, aut frustatim, praecipue latus eius subtile.	Then separate between the two lips of the incision with hooks, and stretch the bladder upwards, and do not touch the testicles enclosed: and cut the bladder as you please, either completely or partially, especially its wide side superficially.</start_of_turn
Nam si tu non exquisite perscrutaris, in incisione eius non fit securitas, quin aqua redeat.	For if you do not carefully examine it, in its incision there will be no security, for the water will return.</start_of_turn
Si autem procedit ouum exterius a cute sua in hora operationis tuae: tunc quando compleueris sectionem sifac, reduc ipsum.	But if anything has escaped from its skin in the hour of your operation: then when you have completed the incision of the bladder, reduce it.</start_of_turn
Deinde aggrega duo labia cutis testiculorum cum sutura.	Then gather together the two lips of the skin of the testicles with a suture.</start_of_turn
Deinde cura ipsum sicut reliqua uulnera, donec sanetur.	Then care for it like the rest of the wound, until it heals.</start_of_turn>
Quod si inuenis ouum corruptum ex nigredine alia, tunc oportet ut liges uasa, quae sunt suspensorium, timens fluxum sanguinis.	If you find any corrupted matter from the black bile, then it is necessary to ligate the vessels which are its suspension, fearing the flow of blood.
Deinde abscinde testiculum cum suspensorio, et extrahe ouum: postea cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then cut off the testicle with its suspension, and extract the matter: afterwards care for that as we have said.
Si uero aqua est aggregata in duabus partibus, tunc scias quia sunt duae ramices: seca ergo partem aliam secundum quod fecisti in altera aequaliter.	If indeed water is aggregated in two parts, then you know that there are two stems: dry therefore the other part equally
Et si aequatur tibi, ut sit operatio una, tunc fac: deinde absterge sanguinem.	And if you make them equal, that the work may be as one, then do so: afterwards drain the blood.
Et intromitte in sectiones lanam submersam in oleo, aut in oleo rosato: et pone deforis lanam aliam quam submersisti in uino et oleo, et expande eam super duos testiculos, et mirach uentris: et pone desuper pannos duplicatos, et sunt puluilli: et liga eos desuper cum ligamento, quod est habens sex secundum hanc formam.	And introduce inside the sections the lanam which is submerged in oil, or in rose oil: and put outside the lanam another which you submerged in wine and oil, and expand above two testicles, and see inside: and put above layers of wool doubled, and are nails: and ligate these above with a ligation which is having six according to this shape.
Deinde sumantur duo panni, et suantur, et impleantur la na carminata, secundum hanc similitudinem: et fiant extremitates quibus premitur ex coto, aut lana humida: et aggregentur cum strictura in lumbari bracharum: et una extremitatum accipiat super anum usque ad dorsum, et secunda accipiat ad partem pectinis: et duae extremitates super duas coxas inferius, et duae extremitates aliae super duo inguina, et aggregetur strictura tota in lumbari bracharum.	And drain away two baths, and wash, and smear the carmine, according to this likeness: and be the extremities which are sent forth from the belly, or wet wool: and gather with the tightening in the lumbar region of the arms: and one extremity receives over one until the back, and the second receives at the part of the loin: and two extremities over two thighs below, and two extremities otherwise over two groins, and gather the tightening altogether in the lumbar region of the arms.
Et, quandoque artificialiter medicatur haec ramex cum cauterio loco sectionis cum ferro: et est, ut accipias cauterium cultellare subtile, et seces cum eo cutem testiculorum: et est ignitum, secundum quod narrauimus: donec quando detegitur sifac album continens aquam: tunc accipe cauterium, secundum hanc formam.	And when indeed it is treated artificially with a cautery in the place of the incision with a knife: and it is that you take a cautery with a fine handle, and cut with it the skin of the testicles: and it is ignited, according as we have said: until when the white fat containing water is detected: then take the cautery, according to this shape
Assimilatur literae graecae.	The letters are assimilated.
Deinde perfora cum eo illud sifac, et est ignitum, donec egrediatur humiditas tota.	Then perforate with that [instrument], and it is ignited, until the whole moisture has departed.
Deinde extende sifac cum uncinis, et excoria cum cauterio subtili ignito, et incide ipsum secundum quod possibile est tibi, donec eradices totum eius.	Then extend the sponge with hooks, and scour with a fine burnisher under a slight flame, and cut through it as much as you can, until you have excised all of it.
Et caue ex ouo, ne tangat ipsum ignis.	And burn from outside, so that it does not touch the flame.
Et scias, quod haec operatio est saluior, et longinquior a fluxu sanguinis, et melior quam operatio cum sectione.	And you know, that this operation is safer, and more remote from the flow of blood, and better than an operation with a cut
Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit in hora sectionis, aut in hora cauterii apostema calidum, aut fluxus sanguinis, aut aliquid aliud: tunc oportet ut cures quod contrarietatem tibi facit ex illo cum curatione quae conuenit ei, secundum quod praemissum est.	If indeed in the hour of the cut, or in the hour of the burn after the callous has become cold, or the flow of blood, or something else: then it is necessary that you should cure that which makes the adversity to you in that which it is necessary to cure it, according to what has been said above
Si autem infirmus est timidus, et non expectat super hanc operationem, propter horribilitatem suam: tunc administra perforationem secundum quod ego narro illud: et est.	But if the patient is timid, and does not expect this operation on account of its horror: then I order a perforation as I have said above: and that is it
Quando certificatur tibi apud te per illud quod diximus de significationibus, quod ramex est aquosa: tunc oportet quod facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	When you are assured by me that this has been made known to you concerning the signification of the matter, which is that it is a wound which has become aquous: then you must make the patient sit upon a raised seat
Deinde perfora apostema in inferiori parte sui cum spatumili lato: et pone perforationem secundum longitudinem corporis, et sit apertio ampla, donec currat aqua tota.	Then perforate the callous in the lower part of it with a broad spatula: and place the perforation according to the length of the body, and leave the opening wide open, until the whole water has drained out
Deinde pone super locum cotum, et liga ipsum, et dimitte ipsum ut currat residuum aquae: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then place upon the place of the wound, and ligate it, and let it drain out the remaining water: then care for it until the wound is healed
Si autem contrarietas sit egressioni aquae in hora qua perforas ipsam: et non sit illud nisi propterea, quia panniculus albus contrarietatem facit in orificio uulneris, et prohibet exitum aquae: tunc oportet ut intromittas pennam in uulnus, aut instrumentum cum quo extrahitur aqua hydropicorum, cuius forma praecessit: aut adde in operatione uulneris parumper.	If indeed there is an obstacle to the outflow of the water in the hour when you perforate it: and this is not except for the fact that a white membrane makes adversity to the outlet of the wound, and prohibits the outflow of the water: then it is necessary that you introduce a needle into the wound, or an instrument with which the watery humors are extracted, whose form has been mentioned: or add in the operation of the wound a little of that which has been mentioned before
Et scias, quod aqua redit, et aggregatur post sex menses, aut circiter eos.	You know that water returns and accumulates after six months, or thereabouts.
Cum ergo aggregatur, tunc pertoretur secundum eundem modum, et pertransibit infirmus dies suos.	When it accumulates, it returns in the same way and passes away the days of the infirm

Dico ergo, quod accidunt apostemata multa in corporibus, ex quibus componuntur testiculi: et fit illud ex caussis multis, scilicet.	I say that there are many pus formations in the body, from which testicles are made: and that is from excessive moisture.</start_of_turn

Et fortasse est apostema lapideum, cuius color est fuscus, et non est sensus ei.	And perhaps it is stony pus, whose color is dark, and which has no sensation.</start_of_turn

Quod ergo est ex eis ex inflatione arteriarum, cognoscitur per dispositionem apostematis, quando comprimis ipsum digitis tuis.	That which is from the swelling of arteries is recognized by the position of the pus, when you press it with your finger.</start_of_turn
Et non oportet ut tangas ipsum prorsus.	And it does not behoove you to touch it directly.</start_of_turn
Illud uero quod fit ex inflatione uenarum, non dispergitur ex eo aliquid apud compressionem cum digitis.	That which comes from the inflation of veins does not disperse from it by anything with the pressure of the fingers.
Et iam possibile est, quod super hanc speciem fiat sectio, et super reliquas carnes: et est, ut seces cutem testiculorum.	It is also possible that above this kind of swelling there should be a cutting, and above the rest of the flesh: as, for example, to separate the skin from the testicles.
Deinde extende ouum ad sursum, et extrahe ipsum cum sifach albo: et libera suspensorium ex uasis, et liga uasa: et incide suspensorium postquam tu liberas ipsum ab omni parte ex partibus oui.	Then extend the limb upwards, and extract it with white wool: and loosen the suspension from the vessels, and ligate the vessels: and cut through the suspension after you have freed it from all parts of the limb
Si ergo ouum consolidatum est cum illis carnibus natis, tunc oportet ut attrahas ouum, et incidas ipsum.	If, therefore, the limb is consolidated with those natural parts of the flesh, then it is necessary to grasp the limb and cut through it.

A swelling is a soft swelling which is like a bag, with the softening of the testicles: and it makes it difficult for the patient to walk and to exercise, and to walk.
Et in curatione huius aegritudinis est ex timore, propter illud cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And in the treatment of this ailment is fear, because of the remembrance of which it is preceded.
Verum oportet, ut dicamus operationem in ea secundum quod fecerunt primi.	But it is necessary to say that we must do the operation in this case as they did the first time.
Dico ergo, quod oportet ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	I say, therefore, that it is necessary that you make the infirm person sit upon an elevated seat.
Deinde impelle suspensorium testiculorum ad inferiora.	Then push the testicles towards the lower parts.
Deinde tene cutem testiculorum cum digitis tuis, cum uasis quae sunt propinqua uirgae: et teneat ea minister alius, et extendat ea extensione uehementi.	Then hold the testicles with your fingers, with the veins that are near the testicles: and let another assistant hold them, and extend them with a stretching out that is appropriate
Deinde incide cum spatumili lato acuto sectione transuersa in directo uasorum, donec detegantur uasa.	Then make an incision with a sharp knife across the scrotum, until the veins are detected
Deinde excoria ab omni parte, sicut diximus tibi in extractione Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then remove it from all sides, as we said concerning the arteries in their place.
Postea fige in eis acum in qua sit filum duplum, et liga ipsum in primo locorum quibus accidunt Vites: et liga ipsum iterum in ultimo eorum.	Then fix it in wax in which there is double thread, and tie it in the first place where the veins meet: and tie it again at the last of them
Deinde seca ea in media sectione recta secundum longitudinem corporis, et extrahe quod aggregatur ex humiditatibus faeculentis corruptis.	Then dry them in a middle section straight according to the length of the body, and remove that which accumulates from the humours of corrupt faeces.

Then care for the wound with care for the rest of the wounds, in which the generation of health must take place, so that the veins which nourish one testicle may fall away
Non est enim malum per illud.	There is nothing bad in this.

Caput LXV.	Chapter 155.</start_of_turn>
Euentus huius Ramicis est ex sectione, quae accidit in sifach extenso super uentrem in parte inguinum ex mirach uentris.	The event of this chapter is from a section that occurs in the large intestine above the belly in the groin part from the wonder of the belly.
Quare descendunt intestina ex illa Ruptura ad unum testiculorum.	Why do the intestines descend from the rupture to one testicle?
Et haec Ruptura est aut ex sifach, aut extensione eius.	The rupture is either from a fissure or an extension of it.
Et accidunt istae duae species ex caussis multis: aut ex percussione, aut saltu, aut clamore, aut eleuatione rei grauis, et similibus.	These two species of rupture arise from various causes: from a blow, a jump, a cry, an elevation of a heavy object, and similar things.
Et signum, quando est ex extensione sifach.	The sign is when the rupture is from an extension of the fissure.
Est quod accidit paulatim in tempore longo, et non accidit subito: et est apostema aequale uersus profundum: propterea, quod sifach comprimit intestinum.	It happens gradually over a long period of time, and does not happen immediately: and is equal to the elevation of the deep parts: because the fissure compresses the intestine
Et signum eius quando est ex sectione sifach, quia facit accidere ex principio sui dolorem uehementem subito: et est apostema diuersum, apparens sub cute propinque: et illud est propter exitum intestini, et cursus eius ad exteriora sifach.	The sign of the rupture is when there is a sudden pain which originates from the beginning of the fissure: and there is a different swelling appearing under the skin close at hand: and this is because the intestine has escaped through the opening of the rupture and is going outside the fissure itself
Et quandoque egreditur cum intestino zirbum: et nominatur haec Ramex intestinalis, et zirbia: et quandoque fit cum uentositate.	When the intestines escape with the testicle: and this is called the intestinal hernia, and swelling: and sometimes it is associated with wind
Et quandoque currit in intestinum stercus, et retinetur illic: et est cum eo pernicies infirmi: quoniam facit accidere dolorem prauum, et praecipue quando premitur.	When stool runs into the intestine and is retained there: and this is with great harm: because it causes severe pain, especially when it is expelled.
Et in curatione specierum aegritudinis huius cum ferro est timor: quare oportet ut caueatur casus in ea.	And in the treatment of these diseases of the intestines there is fear of the knife: therefore it is necessary to take precautions against it.
Et modus operationis est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut reducat intestinum manu sua ad interiora concauitatis suae, si obedit reditui.	The method of operation is to bring out the intestines from the wound of the patient, so that they return to the cavity of their own container.
Deinde resupinetur super collum suum inter manus tuas: et eleua crura eius.	Then they are placed over the collar of their neck between your hands: and raise their limbs.
Deinde extende cutem quae sequitur cutem ad superiora, et seca cutem testiculorum totam per longitudinem.	Then spread out the skin following the skin up to the testicles: and dry the testicles thoroughly throughout their length
Deinde fige in duobus labiis sectionis uncinos, secundum quod indiges ad aperiendum sectionem cum eis: et sectio sit secundum quantitatem, quod sit possibile, ut egrediatur ex ea ouum.	Then fix in two wounds the section of the gut, according to what is necessary to open the section with ease: and the section be according to quantity, as much as is possible, that it may depart from it whatever.
Deinde excoria siphak, et quae sunt sub cute testiculorum, donec quando detegitur sifach album, durum ab omni parte: tunc intromitte digitum tuum indicem in eo quod sequitur testiculum, in eo quod est inter siphach album, quod est sub cute oui, et inter sifach secundum, et absolue cum eo adhaerentiam quae est in posteriori parte oui.	Then strip the intestines, and those which are under the skin of the testicles, until the white intestine is detected, hard from all parts: then insert your finger into the index of that which follows the testicle, in that which is between the white intestine and the testicle, which is under the skin, and between the intestines according to quantity, and absolutely with that which is adhered to the posterior part of the testicle.
Deinde moue cum manu dextra ad interiora cutem testiculorum: et cum hoc extende sifach album ad sursum, cum manu sinistra: et eleua ouum cum sifach ad partem sectionis: et praecipe ministro, ut extendat ouum ad sursum: et tu solue adhaerentiam, quae est retro solutione completa.	Then move with your right hand to the inside of the skin of the testicles: and with this extend the white intestine upwards with your left hand: and elevate the gut with the intestine to the part of the section: and command the minister to extend the gut upwards: and you resolve the adhesion which is behind the complete solution
Et quaere digitis tuis, ut non sit aliquid illic ex intestino inuoluto in sifach albo duro.	And seek with your fingers that there be nothing there in the white intestine which is hard.
Si autem inuenis ex eo aliquid: tunc impelle ipsum ad uentrem inferius.	If indeed you find something there: then push it downwards towards the lower part
Deinde accipe acum, in qua sit filum grossum, factum licinium ex decem filis: et intromitte ipsam apud postremum sifach, id est, tunicae, quod est sub cute testiculorum quae sequitur sectionem: deinde incide extremitates quae eminent ex filo, donec sint quatuor fila.	Then grasp a needle, in which is a thick thread, made of twelve threads: and insert it into the back of the white intestine, which is under the skin of the testicles which follow the section: then cut off the extremities which protrude from the thread, until there remain four threads.
Deinde compone quaedam eorum super quaedam cum figura quae sit in modo crucis: et liga cum eis alsifach, de quo diximus, quia est sub cute testiculorum ligamento uehementi, donec non possit aliquod ex uasis, quae nutriunt eos mittere ad eos aliquid: ut non accidat inde apostema calidum.	Then make a loop with some of them above some with the shape of a cross: and tie with silk thread, of which we have spoken, because it is under the skin of the testicles a strong ligament which cannot be undone, until it does not have any of the things which nourish them send them to them: that it does not happen that there should be a cold abscess.
Et pone iterum ligamentum secundum extra ligamentum primum, longinquum ab eo minus duobus digitis.	And place again the ligament next to the first ligament, distant from it by the space of two fingers.
Et post ista duo ligamenta dimitte ex sifach, quod est sub cute testiculorum, quantitatem magnitudinis digiti: et incide reliquum totum secundum rotunditatem, et aufer ex eo ouum.	And remove from the sheath two ligaments, which are under the testicles, in the quantity of the magnitude of a finger: and incline the rest entirely according to the roundness, and remove from it all.</start_of_turn>
Deinde seca in inferiori parte cutis testiculorum sectione, ex qua currit sanguis, et sanies: sicut narrauimus in eo quod praemissum est.	And dry in the lower part of the skin of the testicles a section from which blood runs, and heal: as we have said before.</start_of_turn>

When a rupture occurs in the groin, as we have said, and the place protrudes, and does not descend to the testicles anything from the intestines: and if it descends, it is little, and returns in all hours; but if it is prolonged with that time, a fissure is added in the groin, until the intestines descend into the groin.
Et accidit illud ex extensione sifach, quod est in inguinibus, sicut diximus.	And this happens from the extension of the groin, which is in the groin, as we have said
Quod est, quia extenditur sifach: deinde mollificatur, et apostematur locus, et eminet.	Because the groin is extended: then it becomes softened, and the place protrudes, and the place protrudes
Et cura eius est cum cauterio, sicut praecessit eius narratio.	And its treatment is with cautery, as it has been mentioned before.
Et quandoque curatur cum ferro, secundum hunc modum: et est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum inter manus tuas.	And sometimes it is treated with iron, in this way: and the patient lies on his back between your hands
Deinde seca locum Rupturae apostematum et eminentem, sectione per latitudinem, secundum quantitatem trium digitorum.	Then dry the place of the rupture after it has protruded and emerged, by cutting across its width, according to the quantity of three fingers.
Deinde stringe alsifak et, quae sunt sub cute, donec quando detegitur sifach album, quod est sub cute quae sequitur ipsum.	Then bind the intestines and those which are under the skin, until the groin is white, which is under the skin that follows it
Tunc accipe radium, et pone ipsum super locum eminentem ex sifach, et preme ipsum ad profundum uentris.	Then take a sponge and place it over the place where the groin has protruded, and press it deep into the belly
Deinde sue duo loca eminentia super extremitatem radii ex sifach, et annecte cum sutura unum eorum cum altero: deinde extrahe extremitatem radii.	And then two places where the groin has protruded at the extremities of the sponge, and connect them with a suture one with the other: and then draw out the extremity of the sponge.
Et non incidas alsifach omnino, neque tendas ouum, neque aliud, sicut feci te scire in curatione ramicis intestinalis.	And do not cut the intestines at all, neither stretch them out or do anything else, as I have told you in the treatment of intestinal branches.
Deinde cura illud curatione uulnerum.	Then care for the wound.
Cum ergo incidis fila, mundifica illud, et restaura uulnus, donec consolidetur.	When you have finished cutting the thread, moisten it, and close the wound, until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
Sisach enim contrahitur, et non additur eminentia Rupturae.	Do not let the edges of the wound be drawn together, and do not add prominence of the rupture.</start_of_turn>
Et cauterium est melius in hoc loco: quoniam est propinquius ad salutem.	And the cautery is better in this place: because it is closer to the tissue.</start_of_turn
¶ De mollificatione cutis testiculorum.	About the softening of the skin of the testicles.</start_of_turn
Caput LXVIII.	Chapter LXVIII.</start_of_turn>
Multotiens mollificatur cutis testiculorum in quibusdam hominibus, propter quod mollificantur carnes quae sunt inter ea, et foedatur aspectus eius.	Many people soften the skin of their testicles for some reason, because of which the surrounding flesh is softened and its appearance is spoiled.</start_of_turn
Ergo necesse est ei qui rogatur in curatione eius, ut faciat iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et incidat totam cutem quae mollificata est super cutem naturalem.	Therefore it is necessary for the one who is asked to care for it, to make the sick man lie down on his back, and to cut away all the softened skin over the natural skin.</start_of_turn
Deinde aggreget duo labia cum sutura: et si uis, sue in primis superfluitatem cutis mollificatae tribus suturis, aut quatuor, et firma suturam.	Then gather together two lips with a suture: and if you wish, put in the beginning a little of the softened skin with three or four stitches, and make a firm suture.</start_of_turn
Deinde incide inter sututuras.	Then cut between the sutures.</start_of_turn
Deinde cura curatione reliquorum uulnerum, usquequo sanetur, et cadant fila.	Then care for the care of the remaining wounds, until they are healed, and the threads are cast off.</start_of_turn
¶ De Castratione.	About castration.</start_of_turn
Caput LXIX.	Chapter LXIX.</start_of_turn
Scias, quod Castratio in lege nostra excommunicata est: et propter illud liceret mihi, ut non rememorarer eius in libro meo isto: et non est necessaria rememoratio eius, nisi propter duos modos.	You know that castration is forbidden in our law: and for that reason I will not mention it in this book: and it is not necessary to mention it, except for two cases.</start_of_turn
Quorum unus est, ut sit illud in scientia medici quando interrogatur de ea: et ut sciat curationem eius cui accidit.	Whoever is present is sufficient to know the science of medicine when he is questioned about it: and to know the treatment for that which has befallen him.
Et modus alter est, quod nos multotiens indigemus castratione quorundam animalium, propter iuuamenta nostra per illud, sicut arietum, hyrcorum, et gattorum, et similium ex animalibus.	The other method is that we often do not require castration of many animals for our purposes, because of the remedies which we have for them, such as oxen, horses, and goats, and the like among animals.
Dico ergo, quod Castratio fit secundum duos modos.	I say therefore, that castration is done in two ways.
Aut per attritionem.	Or by attrition.</start_of_turn>
Aut per fissuram, et sectionem.	Or by incision, and section.</start_of_turn>
In illa autem quae fit per attritionem, uia operationis est: quod nos faciamus sedere animal in aqua calida, donec mollificentur testiculi eius, et leniantur, et pendeant: deinde attere eos manu tua, donec resoluantur et non appareant sub tactu.	In the former method, however, the operation is: we make the animal sit in warm water, until the testicles soften and relax, and hang down; then we shall cut off the testicles, until they are resolved and do not appear to the touch.</start_of_turn
In castratione autem per fissuram et sectionem, oportet ut teneas animal, et premas cutem testiculorum eius cum manu sinistra.	In castration by incision and section, it is necessary to hold the animal, and grasp the skin of the testicles with the left hand.</start_of_turn
Deinde liga suspensorium, et seca super omne ouum sectione una, donec quando procedunt duo oua: tunc incide ea postquam excoriaueris utrumque, et non dimittas super ea ex sifaket aliquid praeter sifac subtile, quod est super uasa.	Then tighten the suspension, and cut through the whole with one incision, until two holes have appeared: then when these have appeared, close them up after you have scraped away everything except for a small piece of fat, which is above the veins.</start_of_turn
Et iste modus castrationis est melior eo qui fit per attritonem: quoniam attritio fortasse relinquit aliquid ex testiculis, quare desiderat animal coitum.	And this method of castration is better than the one by attrition: because attrition may leave something behind in the testicles, which the animal desires for coitus.</start_of_turn>
Deinde cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Then care for the wound, until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
¶ De cura Hermafroditae duorum modorum.	Regarding the care of hermaphrodites, there are two methods.</start_of_turn
Caput LXX.	Chapter 70.</start_of_turn>
Hermafrodita ex uiris est secundum duos modos.	Hermaphrodites are of two kinds according to the two sexes.
Vnus eorum est, quia apparet in eo quod sequitur spacium, aut in cute testiculorum, in eo quod est inter duos testiculos, figura quasi uulua mulieris, in qua sunt pili: et quandoque currit urina ex eo quod est in cute testiculorum.	Hermaphrodites are of two kinds according to the two sexes. One kind appears with the scrotum either in the space following the scrotum or between the testicles, in which there is a figure like a female vulva, which has hair, and sometimes urine runs from the scrotum.
In mulieribus autem est species una, et est uulua mulieris super pectinem sicut testiculi uiri parui omnino, eminentes ad exteriora: quorum unus est sicut priapus uiri, et duo sicut duo testiculi.	Hermaphrodites are of two kinds according to the two sexes. One kind appears like a female vulva sitting on the pubic bone just like the testicles of a small man, standing outside: one is like the penis of a man, and two are like two testicles
Et curatio trium specierum, duarum ex uiris, et speciei unius ex mulieribus, est: quia oportet ut incidas carnes additas, donec effugiat impressio earum.	And the care of these three kinds, two of which are hermaphrodites and one of which is female, is: because it is necessary to cut away the fat added, until the impression of them is gone.
Deinde cura eas curatione reliquorum uulnerum.	And then care for the rest of the wounds.
In specie autem secunda uirorum, ex qua egreditur urina, quae est in cute testiculorum, non est operatio, neque est eius curatio omnino.	As for the second kind of male, from which urine comes out, which is in the scrotum, there is no operation, nor any care for it
¶ De incisione Tentiginis, et carnis eminentis in uuluis mulierum.	About the incision of the tentorium and the fat eminating in the women's bodies.
Caput LXXI.	Section 71.
Tentigo fortasse additur super rem naturalem, donec foedatur et turpis fit aspectus eius: et quandoque magnificatur in quibusdam mulieribus adeo, donec expanditur sicut in uiris, et peruenit usque ad coitum.	The tentorium may perhaps be added above the natural thing, until it is bruised and makes its aspect unsightly: and when it is increased in some women so much, until it expands like in the males, and persists until the coitum.
Oportet ergo ut teneas superfluitatem Tentiginis manu, aut cum uncino, et incidas: et non ultimes in incisione, praecipue in profundo radicis: ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	It is necessary therefore to cut away the superfluous tentorium, either alone or with one incision, and cut: and do not be excessive in the incision, especially in the depth of the root, so that there does not result the flowing of blood.
Deinde cura ipsam curatione uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then care for the wound itself until it heals
Caro autem orta, est caro quae nascitur in orificio matricis, donec impleat ipsum: et fortasse egreditur ad exteriora secundum similitudinem caudae: et propter illud quidam primi nominant aegritudinem caudatam.	The belly which is born from the matrix orifice until it fills itself up, and sometimes it goes out to the outside like the tail, because of this some call the disease of the tail.
Oportet ergo ut incidamus eam sicut incidimus Tentiginem, et curemus eam, donec sanetur.	It is necessary therefore that we proceed thus as we proceed with the Tentigine, and we must care for it until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
¶ De cura Alratica, quae est uulua mulieris non perforata.	Concerning the care of the female ulcer which is an unperforated wound of a woman.</start_of_turn>
Caput LXXII.	Chapter LXXII.</start_of_turn
Alratica est, ut sit uulua mulieris non perforata, aut sit foramen paruum.	The female ulcer is, as it were, an unperforated wound of a woman, or a small hole.</start_of_turn
Et est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	It is either natural or accidental.</start_of_turn
Accidentalis est ex aegritudine quae praecessit: et ipsa quidem fit aut ex carne nata addita, aut sifach subtili, aut spisso: et fit aut in profundo matricis, aut in lateribus eius, aut in superiore ipsius, aut inferiori eius: et prohibet a coitu et impregnatione, et partu, et fortasse prohibet menstrua.	The accidental one is that which arises from an existing ailment: and this may be either from the natural formation of the flesh added to itself, or from the fine sand or from a hair: and it may be either in the depth of the matrix, or in the flanks, or in the upper part of it, or in the lower part of it: and it hinders coitus and conception, and delivery, and perhaps also the menstruation.</start_of_turn
Et cognitio illius fit per aspectum obstetricis, si opilatio est apparens propinqua.	And the knowledge of it is by the aspect of the obstetrician, if the visible prolapse is close.</start_of_turn
Si autem non est apparens, tunc quaere eam digitis tuis, aut cum radio.	If however it is not visible, then inquire with your fingers, or with the radio.</start_of_turn
Si autem opilatio est ex sifach subtili, et est propinqua duobus labiis: tunc propera, et disrumpe ipsam.	If however the prolapse is from fine sand, and is close to two teeth: then cleanse it, and break it.</start_of_turn
Et est, ut ponas super duo labia puluillos.	And it is necessary to place over two lips two cushions.</start_of_turn
Deinde pone indices tuos duarum manuum simul, et mulier sit super dorsum suum expansis cruribus suis.	Then put your two fingers of both hands together, and the woman should sit with her back expanded and her legs spread wide.</start_of_turn
Deinde extende duo labia cum fortitudine, donec disrumpatur sifach subtile, et aperiatur opilatio.	Then extend two lips with force, until the hidden vein is ruptured, and the opening is made.
Deinde accipe lanam, et imbibe eam in oleo, et pone ipsam super locum: et coeat mulier omni die, ut non consolidetur locus uice alia.	Then grasp the lip and absorb its blood into the sponge, and place it over the place: and let the woman do everything every day, so that it does not solidify in another place.
Si autem sifach est grossum, spissum: tunc oportet ut seces ipsum cum spatumili lato simili folio myrti.	But if the vein is great, thick: then it is necessary to cut it with a broad scalpel like the leaf of myrrh
Si autem opilatio est ex carne nata, tunc suspende eam cum uncinis, et incide eam: et sint tecum medicinae quae fluxum sedant sanguinis absque mordicatione, sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus aggregatum cum albugine oui.	But if the opening is from natural flesh, then suspend the blood with hooks, and cut it: and be with physicians who will stop the flow of blood without damage, such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and thus aggregated with alum.
Deinde administra cannulam ex plumbo amplam, ut non consolidetur uulnus uelociter, teneat eam diebus aliquot: et administra licinium ex lino sicco, deinde curetur reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then give a broad leaden catheter, so that the wound does not solidify too quickly, keep it for a few days: and give vinegar from dry linen, then care for the rest of the treatment, until it is healed
Et quandoque nasciur in matrice natiuitas carnium aliarum: oportet ergo ut incidantur secundum hunc modum: dum non est apostema cancerosum apostemati enim canceroso quod est in matrice, non fiat contrarietas cum ferro omnino.	And when there is birth in the matrix of other flesh: it is necessary therefore to cut them in this way: while there is no cancerous ulcer in the matrix, no contradiction is made with iron in any way
¶ De cura hemorroidarum, Athehelil, et Bothor rubeae in uuluis mulierum.	Concerning the care of hemorrhoids, Athehelil, and Bothor of the red ones in women's veins.
Caput LXXIII.	Chapter 73.
Hemorroides quidem sunt apertio orificiorum uenarum, donec currit ex eis sanguis multus assidue.	Hemorrhoids are indeed a bursting of the veins through the opening of the veins, until there is a great discharge of blood from them
Cum ergo antiquantur hemorroides, fiunt thelil: et iam dixi in diuisione species earum, et signa ipsarum: et dicam hic quae ex eis recipiunt curationem, et quae non.	When they are thus diminished, the hemorrhoids become thelil: and I have already said in the discussion of their species and signs: and here I will say what is to be received for their treatment, and what is not
Dico ergo, quod hemorroides quae sunt in orificio matricis, et non apparent sensui: tunc non est ei curatio cum ferro.	I say therefore, that hemorrhoids which are in the matrix opening, and which are not apparent to the sense: then there is no treatment with iron for them
Quae autem ex eis sunt in orificio matricis super quas cadit sensus, sunt quae curantur.	Whatever exists in the cavity of the uterus above which sensation has fallen is cured.
Oportet ergo ut intromittas mulierem in domum frigidam.	It is necessary therefore that you introduce the woman into a cold house.
Deinde extende athehelil cum forficibus, aut cum panno aspero, et incide eas ex radicibus suis.	Then stretch out the belly with forceps, or with a rough cloth, and cut away the hair from its roots
Deinde pulueriza super eas apud fluxum sanguinis ex uno puluerum incisiuorum absque mordificatione: sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus, et similia eis.	Then powder over the wound with one of the powders mentioned above without causing any injury: like acacia, dragon's blood, and thus, and similar things.
Deinde impellat pedes eius ad parietem hora una.	Then press her feet against the wall for an hour.
Postea depone eam in aquam frigidam.	Then place her in cold water
Quod si perseuerat fluxus sanguinis: tunc fac eam sedere in decoctione sumach, et corticum granatorum, et gallarum, et similium.	If the bleeding persists: then make her sit in a decoction of sumach, and caraway seeds, and gallnuts, and similar things.
Deinde accipe farinam hordei, et confice eam cum melle et aceto, et fac emplastrum cum eo super dorsum eius.	Then take barley flour, and mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a plaster with it on her back
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis cum eo, bonum est: et si non, fac adhaerere dorso uentosas, et mammillis, absque scarificatione.	If blood therefore dries up with this, that is good: and if not, make it adhere to the tender parts, and blood clots, without making a scar
Deinde accipe lanam, et submerge in succo tarathit, aut succo arnoglossae, aut succo ramorum alaulat, id est, aglanter, uino pontico, et fac adhaerere loeo.	Then take wool, and soak it in the juice of tarth, or the juice of arnica, or the juice of chamomile blossoms, that is, gentian, pontic wine, and make it adhere to the blood clot
Cum ergo quiescit apostema, tunc cura locum cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	When the wound has calmed down, then take care of the place with unguents, until it has healed
Albarth uero rubeum est simile capitibus alhaasse, et est asperi aspectus.	Although it is red like the heads of almonds, and has a rough appearance
Oportet ergo ut incidas quod apparet ex eo, secundum quod dixi in thelil aequaliter: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	It is necessary therefore that you cut away what appears from it, according to what I have said above: and take care of it, until it has healed
¶ De perforatione Exiturae quae accidit in matrice.	On the perforation of the Exitura which occurs in the matrix.
Caput LXXIIII.	On the perforation of the Exitura which occurs in the matrix.
Accidunt in matrice species multae apostematum, sicut cancer, et apostema lapideum, et ulcera, et adubelati, et alekilati, id est, herpes, aestiomemus, et fistulae, et hemorroides, et ragadiae, et thelil, et apostema calidum.	Various kinds of extrusions occur in the matrix, such as cancer, stone abscesses, ulcers, foreign bodies, and swellings, such as herpes, swelling, fistula, haemorrhoids, carbuncles, and abscesses.
Et ego quidem iam dixi omnes has aegritudines et species earum, et signa ipsarum, et earum curationes in diuisione: necesse est ut dicam in hoc tractatu apostema calidum quod accidit in matrice, quando est ex apostematibus quae colligunt saniem, et uis scire qualiter fit eius apertio cum ferro.	And I will also mention concerning all these ailments and their kinds, their signs and their treatments in general: it is necessary for me to speak in this treatise of the perforated abscess which occurs in the matrix, when it is extruded from other abscesses which connect the health, and to tell how it is opened with an iron
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	It is necessary for you to consider this.
Tunc si dolor apostematis in incaeptione sua est acutus cum percussione sua, et flamma, et febre: et uides ipsum rubere: si cadit super ipsum sensus, tunc non properes cum perforatione eius: et cura ipsum cum eo eo quod iuuat super maturationem, donec quando quiescat acuitas accidentium.	If the pain of the abscess becomes acute with percussion, inflammation, and fever: and you see it turning red: if it goes beyond your senses, do not attempt to perforate it: cure it with that which will promote healing, until the acute pain subsides
Tunc oportet ut facias sedere mulierem super sedem quae labeat duo sedilia, et reclinetur, uel appodietur super dorsum suum, et aggreget pedes suos ad partem inferiorem uentris: et sint coxae eius expansae, et ponat brachia sua sub genibus suis, et liget utraque ligamento conueniente ad illud.	Then you must make her sit on a cushion which supports two cushions, and recline, or lie down on her back, and rest her feet on the lower part of the belly: and let her knees be spread wide, and put her arms under her armpits, and bind each ligament conveniently to that.
Deinde sedeat obstetrix a latere dextro, et administra instrumentum quo aperitur orificium matricis.	Then let the obstetrician sit at the right side, and administer the instrument with which the opening of the maternal orifice is made.
Cuius forma uenit in eis quae sunt post.	Which form it has comes to light in those things which follow.
Et oportet quando uis administrare hoc instrumentum, ut figas cum Radio profundum matricis mulieris: ut non sit illud quod ingreditur ex instrumento plus, quam profundum matricis, et laedat infirmam.	And you must take care when you administer this instrument that the ribs do not touch the radio of the deep matrix of the woman: that it does not go deeper into the matrix than necessary, and does not damage the lower part
Si autem fuerit instrumentum magis quam profundum, tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos super tecturam profundi matricis: ut prohibeatur introitus instrumenti totius in profundum matricis: et oportet ut ponat uertiginem, quae currit in instrumento, ex latere superiore: et ut teneat instrumentum, et ut reuoluat minister uertiginem, donec aperiatur profundum matricis.	If the instrument be deeper than profound, it is necessary to place sponges over the covering of the profound matrix: in order to prevent the entrance of the entire instrument into the profound matrix. And it is necessary to pour out the moisture which runs in the instrument from the upper side: and to keep the instrument firm, and to draw back the minister of moisture until the profound matrix is opened.
Cum ergo apparet Exitura, et tangitur manu, et est lenis et mollis: tunc oportet ut seces ipsam apud caput suum cum spatumili lato.	When it appears that the orifice has been reached, and the hand touches it, and it is soft and yielding: then it is necessary to dissect it at its head with a broad spatula.</start_of_turn>
Cum ergo euacuatur sanies, tunc oportet ut ponas in uulnus licinium submersum in oleo rosaceo: aut oleo uiridi, in quo sit quaedam stipticitas: et pone licinium, et extrahe sectionem in profundo matricis.	When the pus has been evacuated, then it is necessary to place in the wound a swab dipped in rose oil or green oil, in which there is some astringency: and place the swab, and draw out the section from the profound matrix.</start_of_turn
Et pone exterius super matricem, et super pectinem lanam mundam submersam in aqua, in qua bullitae sunt maluae.	And place externally over the matrix, and over the wound a wool pad soaked in water, in which there are air bubbles.</start_of_turn
Deinde curetur post duos dies cum unguento quod conuenit ad illud, donec sanetur.	And then care for it for two days with an ointment which is suitable for it, until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
Et quandoque abluitur matrix et uulnus, ita quod clisterizatur cum aqua et melle: deinde cum aqua in qua bullita est radix lilii, aut aristolochia longa: deinde redeat ad unguentum.	And when the matrix and the wound are washed, it should be cleansed with water and honey: then with water in which there is a radix of lily or long aristolochia: then return to the ointment.</start_of_turn>
Quod si uulnus absconditum fuerit interius in matrice, tunc oportet ut prohibearis ex curatione eius cum ferro, imo cura ipsum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione.	If the wound is hidden inside the matrix, then it is necessary to forbid its care with iron, and care for it in the way which we mentioned in the instructions.</start_of_turn
¶ Doctrinae Obstetricum, qualiter medicentur embriones uiui, secundum figuram non naturalem egressi.	The doctrine of obstetrics concerning the way in which the physician should treat the fetuses of women, according to the unnatural form of their egress.</start_of_turn
Caput Lxxu.	Page 72.</start_of_turn>
Necesse est Obstetrici, ut cognoscat in primis figuram partus naturalis.	It is necessary for the Obstetrician to first become acquainted with the natural form of the partus.
Ex signis ergo eius est, quod quando uides mulierem comprimi ad inferiora, et desiderat odorare aerem, et alleuiatur super eam quod super ipsam est de partu, et festinat exitus embrionis: tunc scias quod iste partus est secundum figuram naturalem, et est exitus eius super caput suum, et secundina cum eo: aut suspensa, uel pendens ex umbilico.	It is necessary for the Obstetrician to first become acquainted with the natural form of delivery
Cum ergo uides haec signa, tunc oportet ut comprimatur uenter eius, ut descendat embrio uelociter.	When therefore you see a woman in labor, who desires to smell the air and who lets go of what is above her belly in connection with the delivery, and when the embryo comes out quickly: then you know that this delivery is natural, and that its issue is above its head and following.
Nam quando descendit super caput suum, descendit secundina cum eo, et mundatur ex illis superfluitatibus mundificatione bona.	For in such a case, when it descends above the head and follows after, it comes down along with the second part, and goes out with the greatest ease.
Qui autem est praeter hunc partum, est innaturalis, illaudabilis.	Whoever is outside of this delivery is unnatural and perilous.
Quoniam quandoque egreditur foetus super pedes suos, et egreditur corpus eius ante caput ipsius, et pedes eius, et manus eius una, aut pes eius unus: aut egreditur caput eius et manus eius: aut egreditur uentrinus: et fortasse conuertitur super collum suum, et similia ex figuris illaudabilibus.	For when the fetus comes out upon his feet, and his body goes before his head, and his feet and hands together, or one foot alone, or his head and hands, or his belly: or perhaps it bursts through the collar of his garment. And similar things happen in unnatural deliveries.
Necesse est ergo Obstetrici, ut sit prudens, subtilis in istis rebus omnibus, et caueat sibi ab errore et decaeptione: et ego sum ostendens omnem figuram ex eis, et qualiter est ingenium in ea, et significetur per illud, et stetur super ipsum.	It is necessary for the Obstetrician to be prudent and cautious in all these matters, and to avoid error and extravagance: and I shall show you all the figures and how they are established by this, and what is signified thereby, and I shall stand by myself.
Quando egreditur foetus super caput suum egressione sua naturali, et uehemens fit illud super mulierem, et difficilis fit ei partus, et uides uirtutem eius iam debilitatam: tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, aut mulieres teneant eam: et uapora uuluam eius cum foenugraeco decocto, et cum oleis humidis.	When the fetus comes out above his head in his natural delivery, and when he feels that he is above the woman, and that the delivery is difficult for her: then let her sit down, or let the women hold her up: and let her breathe with a wet cloth over her face, and with warm oils.
Deinde intromittat Obstetrix inter digitos suos Spatumile paruum, et findat cum eo secundinam, et secet eam ungue suo, donec currat quod est in ea ex humiditate: et preme uentrem mulieris, donec descendat foetus.	Then the Obstetrix inserts his thumb between the fingers of the Spatumile, and finds its second digit, and severs it with his nail until it is free from the moisture: and he first grasps the woman's womb, until the fetus descends.
Si autem non descendit, tunc oportet ut clisterizetur mulier ex mucillagine foenugraeci, cum oleo sisamino.	If however it does not descend, then it is necessary to instill the woman with a douche of foehnus mucus.
Deinde praecipe ei post clistere, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi, et tene os eius et nasum ipsius hora una.	Then command her to sit down after the clistering: and make her clench and relax her abdomen for an hour together.
Foetus enim egredietur statim.	The fetus will immediately come out.
Quod si egrediantur duae manus foetus in primis, iunc oportet ut reducas eas cum facilitate paulatim.	If two hands of the fetus come out at once, it is necessary to reduce them gradually
Si autem non obedit in introitu, tunc pone mulierem super sedem, et eleua pedes eius sursum: deinde concute sedem super terram: et mulier teneatur, ut non cadat apud concussionem.	If however it does not obey in its introversion, then place the woman on her seat, and lift her feet above the head: then press her seat against the ground: and the woman must keep still, lest she fall from the concussion
Si ergo non egrediuntur manus, et moritur foetus: tunc incide eas, et extrahe residuum foetus: et liga manum eius cum panno, et extrahe ipsum cum aequalitate: nam ipse egredietur.	If therefore they do not come out, and the fetus dies: then cut through the palms of the hands, and extract the remaining fetus: and bind up the hand with a cloth, and extract it with equality: for it itself will come out.
¶ Exitus embrionis super pedes suo.	The exit of the embryo through the feet.
Quando egreditur foetus super pedes suos, tunc oportet ut impellat eos sursum: deinde conuertat foetum paulatim: postea aequet ipsum.	When the fetus comes out through the feet, then it is necessary to push it upwards: then gradually turn the fetus: afterwards equalize it
Deinde accipiat unum pedum eius, et extendat eum paulatim.	Then grasp one foot of it, and extend it gradually
Cum ergo egrediuntur usque ad coxas, tunc praecipe ei, ut comprimatur, et fac eam sternutare cum condisi: egredietur enim, si Deus uoluerit.	When they come out as far as the hips, then command her to clench and relax, and make her clench her abdomen: the fetus will come out if God wills it.
Et si non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc reduc foetum paulatim, donec ponas eum secundum figuram naturalem.	If it does not go out with it as we have said, then gradually reduce the limb, until you have set it according to its natural form.
Nam ipse egredietur tunc egressu facili.	The limb itself will then come out with the evacuation
Quod si prohibeatur cum eo toto quod narrauimus: tunc accipe ex mucillagine alteae, et oleo sisamino, et gummi soluto: et percute totum in mortario percussione bona: deinde line cum eo uuluam mulieris, et inferius uentris eius.	If it is opposed by all that we have said: then take from the high slime, and the fat, and gum dissolved in vinegar: and pierce all through in a good percussion: then line with the hair of a woman, and below with the belly of her
Deinde fac eam sedere in aqua tepida, donec consequatur hypocundria.	Then make it sit in warm water, until the discharge follows naturally.
Cum ergo uides quod iam calefacta sunt inferiora eius, tunc fac ei sief de myrrha: et suppone ipsum.	When the lower parts are thus warmed, then make for it a sieve of myrrh: and support it.
Quando ergo tenet sief hora una, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	When it has held the sieve for an hour, then make it sit upon a seat.
Deinde fac eam sternutare: et stringe ipsius os et nasum: et preme inferiorem partem uentris compressione facili.	Then make it cough: and bind its bone and nose: and press the lower part of the belly with ease
Nam foeus egredietur statim.	For the pus will come out immediately.
¶ Exitus foetus super genua et manus.	The fetus comes out over the knee and hand
Quando egreditur secundum hanc formam, tunc ingeniet in intromittendo manus suas paulatim.	When it comes out according to this form, then it will enter inwards gradually withdrawing its hand.
Deinde resupinetur mulier super collum suum, et pendeant pedes eius ad inferiora: et ipsa sit iacens super lectum, et complicet manus suas.	Then the woman lies over her neck, and hangs her feet downwards: and she lies recumbent on the bed, and tightens her hands
Deinde preme supra uentrem eius paulatim.	Then press upon her belly gradually
Deinde extrahe quod est sub pedibus eius ex puluinaribus, donec sit praeparata in inferiori parte.	Then draw out what is under her feet from the nails, until it is prepared in the lower part.
Quod si non egreditur foetus, tunc accipe pedes eius, et moue eos motu uehementi.	If the fetus does not come out, then grasp her feet, and move them with force
Deinde preme quod est supra hypocundria paulatim, donec ascendat foetus ad superiora.	Then first of all that is above the navel gradually, until the fetus ascends to the upper parts.
Deinde intromittat manus suas, et aequet foetum paulatim: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimatur, donec egrediatur foetus.	Then withdraw your hand gradually, and equalize the fetus gradually: and command the woman to press, until the fetus comes out.
¶ Exitus foetus latitudinaliter pendens ex manibus.	The fetus is delivered with a lateral slant from the hands.
Ingenietur in reductione manus eius.	There is an inclination towards reducing the hand in this way.
Si autem non potest reducere eam, tunc eleua mulierem, et fac eam ambulare.	If, however, it is not possible to reduce the hand, then elevate the woman, and make her walk about
Si uero ambulare non potest, tunc fac eam iacere super lectum: et concute crura eius concussione uehementi.	If she is unable to walk, then make her lie upon a bed: and strike her legs with a striking of concussion
Deinde administra linimentum quod praeparasti ex mucillaginibus.	Then apply the unguents which you have prepared from mucilages
Quod si accipit eam partus, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	If she contracts during the delivery, then make her sit down upon a seat
Deinde stude in reductione manus, et aequa foetum secundum figuram naturalem: et fac sternutare mulierem, et praecipe ei, ut comprimat se, donec egrediatur.	Then study in the reduction of the hand, and equalize the fetus according to the natural figure: and command the woman to strain, and tell her to press herself, until she comes out.
¶ Exitus foetus super collum suum, expansis manibus, et est facies eius ad dorsum matris suae.	The fetus comes out over his collar, with his hands spread out, and his face is towards the mother's back
Oportet ut teneat Obstetrix manum foetus, deinde reuoluat eum paulatim, et aequet eum cum facilitate.	The Obstetrician must hold the hand of the fetus, then gradually turn him around, and equalize him with ease
Cum ergo aequatur, tunc pone super uuluam eius quod narrauimus ex oleo et mucillaginibus.	When he is equalized, then place upon his wound that which we mentioned from wax and mucilages
Deinde praecipe ei, ut moueatur paulatim.	Then tell her to move gradually
Cum ergo feceris illud, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, et praecipe ei ut inclinetur ad latus dextrum.	When you have done this, then make her sit down upon a seat, and tell her to lean towards the right side
Deinde praecipe ei, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi.	Then command him to lie down: and make him raise his chest with his chest muscles.
¶ Exitus foetus praeparati super latus.	Then command him to lie down: and make him raise his chest with his chest muscles.
Quando descendit ad orificium matricis secundum hunc modum cum secundina, tunc scinde secundinam cum ungue tuo, donec euacuetur ex humiditate.	When he has descended to the orifice of the matrix in this manner with this movement, then split the second [layer] with your finger until it is evacuated from the moisture.
Si ergo suspenditur super faciem foetus, et collum eius, tunc incide eam ex umbilico: ut non retineatur, et moriatur.	If, therefore, it hangs suspended over the face of the fetus, and his neck, then cut him from the navel: so that it does not remain, and he may die
Deinde impelle foetum ad interiora, donec ponas eam secundum quod oportet: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimat se aliquotiens: ipse enim egredietur exitu leui.	Then drive the fetus inwards, until you place your hand according to what is necessary: and command the woman to compress herself slightly: he himself will depart through the easy exit
¶ Exitus Geminorum, aut foetuum multorum.	The exit of twins, or many fetuses.
Scias, quod Gemini multotiens nascuntur: et quandoque nascuntur tres, et quatuor.	You know that twins are often born together: and sometimes three, or even four are born together.
Verumtamen illud extraneum est, et raro contingit.	Indeed that is extraordinary, and rarely happens.
Quinque uero est res extra naturam, et non uiuunt penitus: et continet eos, quamuis multiplicentur, secundina una: et separantur per sifach, distinguens inter eos ligatum in umbilico cuiusque eorum.	Five indeed are things beyond nature, and do not entirely endure: and contain these [fetuses], although they multiply, in one: and they are separated by the navel, distinguishing between the ligament of each one.
Et quandoque egrediuntur sicut egreditur foetus unus exitu naturali, facili: et egrediuntur exitu illaudabili, sicut narrauimus.	And sometimes they depart as does a single fetus through a natural exit, easily: and they depart through an unnatural exit, as we have narrated.
Quod si difficiles fuerint quidam eorum apud partum, et perueniunt ad illud quod diximus ex figuris innaturalibus, tunc cura eos sicut narrauimus: et sit ob stetrix subtilis, et faciat quod facit cum facilitate et tarditate, et ingenietur secundum omnem figuram cum eo quod praeparatur ei ex ingenio ducente ad salutem.	If, however, there are some things which are difficult at the birth, and are prolonged to this which we have mentioned from unnatural figures, then take care of them as we have narrated: and let the midwife be gentle, and do what she does with ease and delay, and adapt to every figure which is prepared for her from the ingenuity leading to health
¶ Rememoratio eius quod formatur in matrice ex embrionibus, et abortiuntur.	Remember that it is formed in the matrix from seeds and is aborted.
Quandoque formatur in matrice unus, et duo, et tres, et quatuor, et quinque, et sex, et septem, et plures decem: et iam uerificatum est apud me, quod mulier abortiendo emisit septem, et alia quindecim, omnes formatos.	When one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, or more seeds are formed in the matrix, and they are aborted: then it is verified that the woman has aborted seven in one instance and fifteen in another.
Quod factum est mensuratione gloriosi sapientis.	Which is confirmed by the measurement of a wise man.
Hoc ergo totum oportet ut sit in scientia Obstetricis.	Therefore all this is necessary to be learned in the science of Obstetrics.
Fortasse enim perueniet ad eam simile illius: opponat ergo ei cum illo quod oportet	Perhaps indeed it will be like this: let us compare it with that which is necessary
¶ De extractione foetus mortui.	Of the extraction of the dead fetus.
Caput LXXVI.	Chapter LXXVI
Quando curas foetum mortuum cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex medicatione, et non egreditur, et cogeris uti operatione cum manu, tunc oportet ut consideres.	When you cure the dead fetus with the medicine which I mentioned in the treatise on medication, and it does not go out, and you must use an operation with the hands, then you must consider it
Si ergo mulier est sanae uirtutis, et non est cum aliquo ex accidentibus, ex quibus timetur super eam perditio: tunc oportet ut resupinetur mulier super lectum, super dorsum suum, et sit caput eius inclinatum inferius, et crura eius eleuata: et ministra teneat eam a duabus partibus, aut ligetur ad lectum, ut non extrahatur corpus eius apud extractionem foetus.	If, therefore, the woman is of sound virtue and is not with any of the things from which one might fear a loss of life during the process: then it must be arranged that the woman lies over the couch, over her back, with her head inclined downwards and her legs raised up: and the minister should hold the patient's body from two parts, or it should be bound to the couch, so that the body is not pulled out during the extraction of the fetus
Deinde humecta os matricis ex oleis humidis cum mucillagine alteae, et foenugraeci, et seminis lini.	Then moisten the os matricis with oily substances with high mucilage, with aloes and fennel seeds, and linseed seeds.
Deinde inungat Obstetrix manum suam cum istis oleis et mucillaginibus: deinde intromittat eam in matricem cum facilitate.	Then the Obstetrician should smear his hand with these oils and mucilages: then he should introduce the hand into the matrix with ease
Deinde quaerat cum ea locum in quo figat uncinos ex foetu, et loca conuenientia ad illud.	Then he seeks the place where the nails of the fetus are fixed, and the convenient place for this
Considera ergo tunc, si foetus est praeparatus ut descendat super caput suum: tunc fige uncinos in oculos eius, aut in collo eius, aut in ore eius, aut in palato ipsius, aut sub barba eius, aut in furcula ipsius, aut in locis propinquis costis, et sub hypocundriis.	Consider therefore at all times, if the fetus is prepared to descend over its head: then fix the hooks in its eyes, or in its neck, or in its mouth, or in its palate, or under its beard, or in its armpits, or in the neighboring parts of the ribs, and under the hyoid bone.
Si autem descensus est super pedes eius, tunc in pectine, et costis eius mediis.	If it descends upon its feet, then in the groin, and the middle ribs.
Et oportet, ut teneat uncinum cum manu dextra: et ponat curuitatem eius in eo quod est inter digitos sinistrae manus: et intromittat cum manu cum facilitate, et figat uncinum in aliquo illorum locorum quae diximus, donec perueniat ad rem uacuam.	And it is necessary to hold the hook with the right hand: and place the suture in that which is between the left thumb and index finger: and introduce it with the thumb with ease, and fix the hook in one of those places which we have mentioned, until it reaches the desired thing.</start_of_turn>
Deinde figat in oppositione eius uncinum alium, aut tertium, si indiges: ut sit contractio aequalis, et non declinet ad partem.	And fix the other hook, or the third, if necessary: so that there is an equal tension, and it does not incline towards the part.</start_of_turn>
Deinde extendatur extensione aequali, et non sit extensio secundum rectitudinem tantum, imo moueatur ad omnem partem, ut alleuietur exitus eius: sicut fit cum dente apud eradicationem eius.	And extend with an equal extension, and it should not be extended only in a straight line, but should be moved towards all parts, so as to alleviate the exit of it: just as it is done with a tooth when extracting it.</start_of_turn>
Et oportet in eo quod est inter illud, ut mollificetur extensio.	And it is necessary in that which is between them, to soften the extension.</start_of_turn
Quod si retineatur ex eo pars, tunc oportet ut inungat Obstetrix quosdam digitos cum oleo, et intromittat eos ex parte, ut reuoluat cum eis quod retinetur.	Because if it is retained from that part, then it is necessary for the obstetrician to grasp any two fingers with the thumb and index finger, and introduce them from the side, so that it may recoil with what is retained.</start_of_turn
Si ergo egreditur pars foetus, tunc permutentur uncini ad locum alium qui sit altior: fac hoc donec egrediatur foetus totus.	If therefore the part of the fetus comes out, then exchange the sutures to another place which is higher: do this until the fetus comes out entirely.</start_of_turn
Si ergo egreditur manus ante alia, et non est possibile reducere eam, propter coartationem eius: tunc oportet, ut inuoluatur super eam pannus.	If therefore the hand comes out before the other, and it is not possible to reduce it because of its adhesion: then it is necessary to cover over the hand with the palm.</start_of_turn
Deinde extrahe eam donec quando egreditur tota, incide eam aut in iunctura plantae, aut in cubito: et ita oportet ut facias in manu altera, et in duobus pedibus.	Then extract the bone until it comes out whole, or break it at the junction of the plant, or in the cubit: and so it must be done in the other hand, and in both feet.
Si autem caput foetus est magnum, aut accidit ei coartatio in exitu, aut est in capite eius aqua aggregata: tunc oportet ut intromittat inter digitos Spatumile spinosum, et findat cum eo caput, et extrahat aquam: aut disrumpat ipsum cum instrumento quod nominatur Almisdac: cuius forma uenit cum formis reliquorum instrumentorum in capitulo quod est post hoc.	If the fetus's head is large, or if there is a coarsening of the delivery, or if there is water in the head: then it must be introduced between the fingers of the Spatumile spinosum, and find the head with it, and extract the water: or break it with the instrument called Almisdac, which has a form like that of the other instruments in this chapter.
Similiter faciat si foetus est magni capitis natura, tunc oportet ut seces algengematu: aut extrahas ipsum cum misdach, sicut diximus.	Proceed in the same way if the fetus has a large head, then it must be severed from the membrane: or extract it with the forceps, as we have said
Deinde attrahas ossa cum forcipibus.	Then grasp the bone with forceps.
Quod si egrediatur caput, et coartetur apud furculam: tunc findatur, donec effundatur humiditas quae est in pectore.	When the head comes out, and is close to the rib cage: find it until the moisture that is in the chest has drained out.
Si autem non complicatur, neque obedit ad exitum: tunc incide caput frustatim, secundum quod possibile est tibi.	If it does not become complicated, and does not yield to delivery: then break the head coarsely, as much as is possible to you
Quod si inferius uentris est apostematum, aut est in eo hydropisis: tunc oportet ut perfores ipsum, donec currat humiditas ex eo.	If the lower belly is swollen, or if there is swelling in it: then it must be pierced, until the moisture from it comes out
Si uero foetus est super pedes suos, tunc attractio eius est facilis, et directio eius ad os matricis est leuis.	If the fetus is above his feet: the traction of it is easy, and the direction of it towards the maternal bone is smooth.
Si autem coartatur apud uentrem, aut pectus: tunc oportet ut extrahas ipsum cum panno quem inuoluisti super manum tuam: et findat uentrem, aut pectus, donec currat quod est in eis.	If it is obstructed at the belly, or the chest: then it must be extracted with the cloth which you have put over your hand: and find the belly, or the chest, until the moisture has drained out of it
Si autem auferuntur reliqua membra, et redit caput: tunc intromittat Obstetrix manum sinistram.	If the rest of the limb has been delivered, and the head returns: then the Obstetrix will introduce his left hand.
Si ergo os matricis est apertum, tunc intromittat manum in profundum matricis, et quaerat cum ea caput, et attrahat ipsum cum digitis usque ad os matricis: deinde intromittat in eo uncinum unum, aut uncinos duos, et attrahat ipsum cum eo.	If the os of the matrix is open, then insert the hand into the depth of the matrix and grasp with the head, and draw it out with the fingers until it reaches the os of the matrix: then insert into it one hook or two hooks and draw it out with it.
Quod si os matricis coartatur, propter apostema calidum quod accidit ei: tunc non oportet ut laboretur super ipsum, imo oportet tunc administrare effusionem rerum humidarum, pinguium: et administra emplastra: et sedeat in aquis quae mollificant et humectant.	If the os of the matrix is closed, because of a thick clot that has happened to it: then it is not necessary to labour above it, but it is necessary to administer effusion of humours, fat: and administer plasters: and sit in waters which soften and moisten
Quod si foetus est super latus suum, tunc possibile est ut aequetur: tunc administretur quod diximus in foetu uiuo.	If the foetus is above its side, then it is possible to equalise it: then is administered what we said in the foetus above.
Quod si non est possibile illud, tunc incidatur frustatim, et extrahatur.	If it is not possible to do this, then it is cut off, and it is extracted.
Et oportet ut non dimittas aliquid ex secundina intus omnino.	And it is necessary that you do not let anything out of the second [part] entirely.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc administra quod diximus in apostematibus calidis quae accidunt in matricibus.	When you have completed your operation, then administer what we said in the cold clots which happen in the matrixes.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc descendat in aquis stipticis, et administra reliquam curationem.	If there happens to be a flow of blood, then descend in styptic waters, and administer the rest of the cure.
Et ego quidem iam uidi mulierem, in cuius uentre mortuus erat foetus: deinde impregnata est super ipsum uice alia, postea mortuus est foetus alius etiam.	And I myself saw a woman in whose womb there was a dead foetus: then it was impregnated over it again with oil, and afterwards the other foetus also died.
Accidit ergo ei post tempus longum apostema in umbilico suo, et inflatum est, donec apertum est: et coepit emittere pus.	It happened to her at length a clot in her navel, and it became inflated, until it was opened: and it began to emit pus.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius, et medicatus sum ei tempore longo: et non consolidatum est uulnus.	I was called to care for her, and I treated her for a long time: and it was not solidified.
Posui ergo super ipsum ex quibusdam emplastris fortis attractionis: et exiuit ex loco os.	I put upon her from some strong plaster of adhesion: and it came out of the place of the bone.
Deinde praeterierunt ei dies aliquot, et exiuit os aliud.	Then some days passed by, and another bone escaped.
Miratus sum ergo inde, cum in uentre non sit os.	Then I was astonished, for in the midst there was no bone left.
Cogitaui ergo, quia erant ex ossibus foetus mortui.	I thought, therefore, that the bones of the fetus had perished
Inquisiui ergo uulnus, et extraxi ossa multa, muliere existente in melioribus dispositionibus suis: et iam uixit taliter tempore longo, et mittit ex loco pus parum.	I inquired of the woman, and I extracted many bones, the woman being in better condition than before.  And it passed in this way for a long time, and a little pus came out from the place.
Et ego non firmaui hic hoc extraneum, nisi quoniam in eo est scientia, et adiutorium ad illud, quod administrat medicus artifex cum manu ex curatione.	I did not trust this external thing, except that it had science, and an assistant who worked with the physician in surgery.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum necessariorum in extractione foetus.	Concerning the forms of the necessary instruments for the extraction of the fetus.
Caput LXXVII.	Chapter 77.
Hic inferius est forma Strictorii, quo aequantur libri, cui aequaliter sunt duae uertigines in duabus extremitatibus duorum lignorum.	Here below is the form of the Strictor, with which books are equaled, to which are equal two rings at the ends of two sticks.
Verumtamen haec Vertigo oportet ut sit subtilior strictorio: et ut fiat, aut ex ebano, aut ex ligno bussi.	It must be known that this Vertigo must be smaller than the Strictor: and that it may be made either of ebony or of seasoned wood
Et sit latitudo omnis ligni quasi duo digiti: et margo cuiusque amborum est quasi digitus unus, et longitudo cuiusque eorum est palmus et medietas: et in medio duorum lignorum sunt duo additamenta ex genere eiusdem ligni, quae iam firmata sunt in utrisque, quorum longitudo est medietas palmi et plus parum: et latitudo utriusque est quasi duo digiti, aut plus parum.	The width of every stick is like two fingers; and the margin of each of the two is like a single finger, and the length of each of them is a palm and a middle: and in the middle of the two sticks are two additions of the same kind of wood, which are fixed in both, of whose length is half a palm and less, and the width of each is like two fingers, or less
Et ista duo additamenta intromittuntur in os matricis, ut aperiatur cum eis quando tu reuoluis duas Vertigines.	And these two additions are introduced into the maternal bone, so that it opens when two Vertigines are rotated together
Forma Vertiginis qua aperitur matrix.	The form of the Vertige which opens the matrix
Forma alia ad simile illius, subtilior, et leuior.	Another form similar to this, smaller and smoother
Fiat ex ligno ebani, aut bussi, secundum similitudinem forcipum.	Let wood be cut from the rib, or from the buttock, according to the shape of the forceps.
Verumtamen in extremitate eius sint duo additamenta, sicut uides hic supra: et longitudo omnis additamenti ex eis est quasi palmus: et latitudo utriusque est, duo digiti.	Two additional pieces should be made at the extremity of it, as above: and the length of each additional piece is like a palm, and the width of each is two fingers wide.
Cum ergo uis aperire matricem cum eo, tunc fac sedere mulierem super lectum, pendentibus pedibus eius, aperto quod est inter crura eius.	When you wish to open the matrix with this, then make her sit over the lectum, with her feet dangling over the edge, and open what is between her thighs
Deinde intromitte ista duo additamenta coniuncta in matricem: et tu es tenens extremitatem instrumenti inferius inter coxas eius.	Then insert these two additional pieces together into the matrix: and you hold the lower extremity of the instrument between her thighs.
Deinde aperi manum tuam cum instrumento, sicut facis cum forficibus, aequaliter secundum quantitatem quam uis ex apertione oris matricis, donec faciat Obstetrix quod uult.	Then open your hand with the instrument, like making a pair of forceps, equally according to the quantity of the opening of the matrix, until the Obstetrix does what she wishes.
Forma Vertiginis alterius quam dixerunt antiqui Forma Impellentis quo impellitur foetus.	The shape of the other Vertex which they have mentioned is like the shape of the Impelling Force by which the fetus is driven forward.
Forma Almisdac, qua conteritur caput magnum: et assimilatur forcipi, cui sunt dentes in extremitate, sicut uides.	The shape of the Almond, which opposes the large head: and it is assimilated to the forceps, which have teeth at the extremity, like the above
Et quandoque fit oblungum, sicut forcipes secundum hanc formam, sicut uides, cui sunt dentes sicut dentes serrae, quo inciditur et conteritur.	And when it is flattened, like the forceps following this shape, like the above, which have teeth like saw teeth, that will break and counteract
Forma Almisdac quo conteritur caput paruum.	The shape of the Almond which opposes the small head.
Forma Vncini habentis spinam unam.	The shape of the Neighbor having a single spine
Forma Vncini habentis spinas duas.	The shape of the Neighbor having two spines
Forma forcipis cui sunt dentes serrae, cum quo conteritur caput foetus.	The shape of the forceps which have saw teeth, with which the fetus's head is countered
Forma Spatumilis habentis duas extremitates ad abscindendum caput.	The shape of the Sponge having two extremities to cut off the head.
Forma duorum Spatumilium etiam latorum.	The shape of two spatulas also of the hands.
Ista instrumenta omnia exercentur, et quanto plus multiplicantur species eorum, et praeparata sunt apud artificem, est uelocior ad operationem suam, et altior apud homines, propter quantitatem suam.	All these instruments are exercised, and the more numerous their kinds, and the better they are prepared in the artificer's shop, the more rapid is the operation and the greater the benefit to men, because of their quantity.
Non ergo despicies ex eis instrumentum, quin sit apud te praeparatum.	Observe not the mean of the instruments, but their preparation which is with you
Inexcusabilis est enim necessitas eorum.	For their necessity is undeniable
¶ De extractione Secundinae.	About the extraction of the second [tooth].
Caput LXXVIII.	Chapter 78.
Quando retinetur Secundina apud partum, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmae, ut retineat anhelitum suum.	When the second [tooth] remains at the root, then it is necessary to remove the inferior ones in order to retain the breath.
Deinde fac eam sternutare cum condisi: et stringe manum tuam super os eius, et nares ipsius.	Then make a depression with the thumb, and grasp the hand over the bone and the breath of the patient.
Si ergo egreditur per hoc, bonum est.	If it comes out through this, it is good
Si non: tunc accipe ollam, et perfora in coopertorio foramen: et pone in ea herbas aperientes os matricis, sicut calamentum, rutam, et anetum, et camomillam, et sseham, et cassiam ligneam, et centauream: accipe omnes istas herbas, aut quasdam earum, et submerge eas cum aqua, et pone eas super ignem.	If not: then take hold of the pulp, and pierce through the bone in the socket: and place in it herbs which open the bone like calamine, rue, alum, chamomile, henbane, and poppy seed, and cedar wood: take all these herbs, or some of them, and soak them in water, and put them over fire
Deinde pone embulam arundinis super foramen coopertorii ollae, et extremitatem aliam in os matricis: et teneat eam donec perueniat uapor ad concauitatem matricis.	Then put a piece of Arundinum over the socket of the bone, and the other extremity in the bone: and hold it until the vapor has gone up to the cavity of the bone.
Deinde fac eam sternutare, sicut diximus.	Then make a depression once more, as we have said
Secundina enim egredietur cum facilitate.	The second [tooth] will come out easily
Si autem remaneat post hanc curationem, et non egrediatur: tunc praecipe Obstetrici, ut submergat manum suam in oleo sisamino, aut mucillagine alteae.	If however it remains after this treatment, and does not come out: then command the Obstetrician to soak the hand in boiling lime or high mucilage
Deinde intromittat in uuluam, et quaerat cum ea Secundinam.	Then he inserts his hand into the belly and searches with her second hand.
Cum ergo inuenerit eam, tunc accipiat eam, et extendat ipsam paulatim.	When he has found it, then he grasps it and slowly extends it outwards.</start_of_turn>
Si autem fuerit annexa in profundo matricis, tunc intromittat manum, secundum quod narrauimus, donec quando inuenerit Secundinam, et extrahat eam paulatim secundum rectitudinem, ut non cadat matrix apud attractionem uehementem: imo oportet, ut permutetur cum facilitate ad latera dextra et sinistra: deinde addatur in quantitatem attractionis.	If, however, it is an appendix that lies deep in the belly, then he inserts his hand, as we have said, until he has found the second hand, and he gradually pulls it outwards along the straight line, so that the belly does not tear due to the stretching force: indeed it is necessary to turn it with ease to the right and left sides: then it should be added in the amount of the stretching force.</start_of_turn>
Ipsa enim obedit tunc, et seruatur, et euadit ab adhaerentia.	It itself obeys him then, and is served, and departs from the adhesion.</start_of_turn
Quod si os matricis est coartatum, sicut nos iam narrauimus: cura eam cum sternutatione, et ex medicatione ollae cum herbis.	Which if the belly is hard, as we have already said: take care of the belly with straining, and from an ointment of oil with herbs.</start_of_turn>
Si autem non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc caue ne fatigeris super eam in iteratione extractionis.	If, however, it does not come out with all that we have said, then take care not to strain too much in the process of extracting it.</start_of_turn
Verum oportet, ut quod egreditur ad os matricis ex ea, liges ad coxam mulieris.	Indeed it is necessary that what comes out through the belly to the woman's hip should be bound to the woman's hip.</start_of_turn
Deinde clisteriza eam cum unguento tetrapharmacon.	Then he closes the belly with four unguents.</start_of_turn
Ipsum enim putrefaciet eam post dies, et dissoluetur, et egredietur.	This itself will putrefy the belly after a few days, and will be dissolved, and will go out.</start_of_turn>
Verumtamen quando putrefit, eleuatur ex ea odor malus ad stomachum et caput, et laedit illud infirmam.	Indeed when it has putrefied, there will be a bad smell emanating from it to the stomach and head, and it will cause pain which will render the patient weak.</start_of_turn
Oportet ergo ut administrentur suffumigationes conuenientes ad illud.	It is necessary therefore that suitable fumigations be administered for this.</start_of_turn>
Quidam autem antiquorum iam experti sunt suffumigationem nasturtii, et ficuum siccarum.	Some of the ancient ones are experts in fumigation with rue and dried figs.</start_of_turn
Forma instrumenti quo suffumigatur mulier apud retentionem Secundinae et menstruorum.	Instrument formation for the fumigation of a woman during the second retention and menstruation.
Fiat ex uitro simile alcama, aut ex zere: et ponatur extremitas ampla super ignem: et suffumigatio sit posita super prunas: teneat eam, donec consumatur illa suffumigatio: et itera aliam.	Let an instrument be made like an upturned bowl, or from horn: and its wide end be placed over the flame: and the fumigation be placed over the berries: and hold it until the fumigation has consumed itself: and do it again for another.
¶ De curatione Ani non perforati.	About the care of an unpierced beast.
Caput LXXIX.	Chapter 79.
Nascuntur multi puerorum, et Ani eorum sunt non perforati, quos iam opilauit sifac subtile.	Many boys are born, and of them some are unpierced, whom I have oiled with subtle saffron.
Oportet ergo, ut obstetrix perforet illud sifac digito suo: et si non, perforet ipsum cum Spatumili acuto: et caueat lacertum, ne tangat eum.	It is necessary therefore, that the midwife pierce that saffron with her finger: and if she does not wish to, she shall pierce it with a sharp spatula: and let tears flow, lest it touch him
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam infusam in uino et oleo.	Then place upon it wool soaked in wine and oil
Deinde cura ipsum cum ungentis, donec sanetur.	And care for him with nails, until he is healed
Si autem times quod opiletur, tunc pone in foramine cannulam de plumbo diebus multis, et auferatur quando puer uult egerere.	If however it is necessary to oil him, then put in the wound a lead cannula for several days, and take it out when the boy wishes to urinate
Et iam accidit opilatio Ani etiam ex consolidatione uulneris, aut apostematis.	And sometimes the oiling of an Ani is from the consolidation of a wound, or from a swelling.
Oportet ergo ut secetur illa consolidatio, deinde curetur cum eo quod diximus ex curatione et plumbo.	It is necessary therefore to dry up that consolidation, and then care for him as we said before concerning the care and lead
¶ De curatione Fistularum quae accidunt in inferiori parte.	About the care of fistulas which occur in the lower part
Caput LXXX.	Chapter 80
Fistulae quae accidunt in inferiori, sunt Nodatio, et Grossitudo quae accidunt prope anum deforis: aut in spacio unius partium: et est Fistula una, aut plures.	Fistulas which occur in the lower part are Nodulation and Swelling which occur near any bone of the limb: or in the space of one part: and there is one fistula, or more
Cum ergo antiquatur illa Nodatio, aperitur, et currit ex ea humiditas aquosa alba, aut pus subtile.	When the old knot has become loose, it opens and a white watery moisture or subtle pus flows from it.
Et quandoque sunt ex istis Fistulis penetrantes.	And sometimes these penetrating fistulas arise from it.
Ergo penetrantes cognoscuntur per illud quod egreditur ex egestione, et uentositate, quando utitur infirmus egestione: et fortasse egreditur ex eis uermis.	Therefore, the penetrating ones are recognized by that which proceeds from its discharge and its swelling, when the patient egests with pain: and perhaps it proceeds from worms.
Et sunt ex eis Fistulae quando sunt in spacio penetrantes usque ad uesicam, et usque ad meatum uirgae.	And these are fistulas when they are penetrating from the space until the belly and until the marrow of the bone
Et sunt ex eis penetrantes usque ad iuncturam coxae, et usque ad nodum caudae.	And they are penetrating until the joint of the hip and until the knot of the buttocks
Ex eo autem quo cognoscitur Fistula penetrans usque ad anum, etiam a non penetrante, est, ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum: et intromittas tentam subtilem in Fistulam ex aere, aut ferro: quando non est tortuositas.	From this, however, it is recognized that a penetrating fistula until the groin, even if it is not penetrating, is as it were, as when you insert your finger into the groin: and you insert a subtle piece of lead or iron into the fistula from the air, or from the iron: when there is no swelling
Quod si in ea est tortuositas, tunc intromitte in eam tentam ex plumbo subtilem, aut pilum ex pilis equarum, donec sentias tentam, aut pilum in digito tuo.	When there is swelling there, then insert into the wound a subtle piece of lead or a hair from a horse's tail until you feel the tension, or until you see the hair in your finger.
Quod si non sentis ipsam penitus, neque procedit ex foramine aliquid ex egestione, neque uentositas, neque uermis sicut dixi: tunc scias, quia est non penetrans: propera ergo ad curationem.	If you do not feel the tension, neither is anything coming out from the discharge, neither swelling, nor worms as I have said: then you know that it is not penetrating: remedy therefore for the treatment.
Et quando Fistula est penetrans usque ad uesicam, aut ad meatum urinae: tunc significatio eius est exitus urinae ex ea, et prohibitio eius ab hoc ut consolidetur locus cum medicinis.	And when the fistula is penetrating until the belly or until the bladder: then the significance of that is the discharge of urine from it, and the prohibition of this until it is consolidated with the physicians.
Si uero est penetrans usque ad iuncturam coxae, aut ad os coxae: tunc signum eius est, quod perueniat tenta usque illuc, si non est in ea tortuositas usque ad os: et inuentio doloris in circumitu partis, et quod egreditur pus ex ea semper: et quod non ualeat in ea medicatio, neque consolidatur cum unguento.	If indeed it is penetrating until the hip joint or the hip bone: then the sign of that is that the tension persists until there, if there is no swelling until the bone: and there is pain around the part and pus always comes from it: and it does not improve with medication, neither is it consolidated with ointment
Et in istis Fistulis omnibus penetrantibus non est curatio omnino: et curatio earum est labor et uanitas ei, ex stultis medicis, super quem formatur.	And in all these penetrating fistulas there is no complete cure: the cure for them is toil and humility before the stupid doctors who formed them.
In illa autem quae non est penetrans, et non antiqua, speratur sanatio cum serro: secundum quod ego narro tibi, et ego iam probaui: et est, ut iaceat infirmus inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et eleua crura eius usque supra coxas ipsius, et coxae eius sint inclinatae ad uentrem ipsius.	And in those which are neither penetrating nor ancient, hope for recovery is expected with an incision: as I have said before, and as I have proven: let the sick man lie between your hands on his back; elevate his limbs up to above his hips, and let his knees be bent towards his belly.
Deinde intromittetentam plumbi, aut aeris, si est in Fistula tortuositas, donec scias ubi peruenit tenta.	Then introduce lead or air into the fistula, until you know where its outlet is.
Si autem sentit eam infirmus circa anum, tunc oportet ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum.	If the sick man feels around his belly, then it is necessary to insert your finger into the belly
Si ergo sentis in digito tuo tentam iam penetrasse per seipsam detectam, praeter quod sentias inter digitum tuum, et inter ipsum sifac, aut carnem: tunc ergo scias certe, quia est penetrans: non ergo labores in ea, quoniam non est eius sanatio, sicut diximus.	If you feel in your finger an attempt to penetrate itself which you detect, besides that which you feel between your finger and the abdomen, or meat: then you know certainly that it is penetrating: for there is no cure for that, as we have said
Dixerunt tamen, quia sanatur in quibusdam hominibus caro, et ex medicatione qua ei speratur iuuamentum, est, ut ignias cauterium subtile secundum amplitudinem Fistulae, sicut praecessit, et intromittas ipsum ignitum in Fistulam, donec perueniat circa anum.	They say that in some men the carrion itself heals, and from the medicine which is expected to be applied: it is necessary to apply gentle cautery according to the size of the fistula, as has been said before, and to introduce the flame into the fistula until it comes around the belly
Deinde itera illud bis, aut ter, donec scias, quia iam adustae sunt omnes illae carnes additae filtratae, quae sunt similes cannulae pennae auis.	Then do that again two or three times, until you know that all the added fatty tissue which is like the quill of a bird has been consumed.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, donec egrediantur illae carnes, quae adustae sunt: deinde cura illud cum unguentis generantibus carnem et consolidantibus.	Then care for it with cloths softened with butter, until those fatty tissues have gone out: then care for it with nourishing unguents which generate flesh and consolidate.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est.	If it heals well, that is good.
Et si non, tunc non sanatur cum alia curatione unquam.	If not, then it does not recover with any other treatment at all.
Et si egreditur tenta, et non peruenerit usque ad digitum tuum, qui est in ano, et est inter ipsum et tentam uelamen spissum ex carne, aut sifac: et uides Fistulam in eo quod sequitur superficiem cutis, tunc seca cutem ab initio Fistulae, et tu uadis secando cum tenta quod est in fistula, donec perueniat secatio ubi peruenit tentae extremitas, et liberatur tenta et cadit.	If not, then it does not recover even if you take away the hand which is in the armpit and which is between the thumb and the fleshy swelling of the flesh, or if you lance it: and if you pour oil into the fistula following the surface of the skin, then dry the skin from the beginning of the fistula, and you dry with the hand which is in the fistula until the cutting has passed beyond the extremity of the thumb, and the thumb is freed and falls off.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas, quae assimilantur cannulae pennae auis, ut non remaneat ex eis aliquid.	Then soften the flesh which has been cut through, which has absorbed the bristles of a feather pen, so that nothing remains of it from the flesh
Si autem uincit te sanguis, et soluit inter te et inter operationem tuam ut seces illas carnes: tunc melius quod fit, et uelocioris iuuamenti, cauterizare eam cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta.	If however blood flows and separates between you and the operation, then it is better to cauterize with fire or with acute medicine than to cut the flesh: for it is more rapid in healing and more secure.
Quoniam cauterium cum igne aggregat habitudines bonas, adustionem illarum carnium additarum, et abscisionem sanguinis, et exiccationem humiditatum.	For fire-cautery unites the good qualities, adds the adhesion of the tissues, and brings about the separation of blood and drying of moisture
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, aut caulibus tritis, donec locus emittat pus, et egrediantur illae carnes adustae in pus.	Then care for it with cloths soaked in butter, or with bruised twigs, until the place emits pus, and the flesh is drawn out in pus
Deinde cura tunc uulnus cum unguentis consolidatiuis, generantibus carnem duram: et sunt medicinae in quibus sunt stipticitas et exiccatio.	Then care for it with strong stitches of solidified wax, generating tough flesh: and these are the medicines which have stypticity and drying qualities.
Nam quando restaurantur, tunc iam sanatur: et non times iterationem.	For when they are restored, then it is healed: and it does not take long time.
Si autem Fistula iam peruenit usque ad profundum ani, et elongatur a superfluitate corporis: tunc intromitte digitum tuum in anum, et inquire cum eo.	If however the fistula persists to the depth of the anus, and extends from the excess of the body: then introduce your finger into the anus and inquire concerning it.
Si ergo sentis tentam, et inter te, et inter eam est uelamen ex sifac, aut carne, et est propinqua penetrationi: tunc non est operatio in illo, nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	If you feel the thumb and there is between you and the fistulous matter a swelling of fat or flesh, and is close to penetration: then there is no operation in that case, except according to the degree of confidence and hope
Quod est, quia administratur in eo unus trium modorum: aut ut cauterizes ipsam, sicut diximus: aut seces eam, donec consequaris concauitatem eius, ut sit possibile tibi intromittere licinia, et curationem ex proximo.	If one mode be sufficient, it is either to cauterize the part itself, as we have said before, or to dissect it, until you have reached its concavity, so that you may afterwards introduce instruments and perform the cure.
Et non procedas multum cum sectione, ut non incidas lacertum continentem anum, et accidat super infirmum exitus egestionis absque uoluntate.	Proceed not too far with the dissection, lest you pierce the membrane containing the marrow, and cause an unfavourable outcome of the evacuation without your desire.
Deinde cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then cure it as we have said before.
Fortasse enim sanabitur: aut elonges ipsum uelamen, et mundes ipsum postquam secas ipsum usque prope anum, sicut diximus, aut cum tenta, aut cum instrumento alio acutae extremitatis.	Perhaps it will be healed: or you may stretch out the membrane itself, and dry it after you have scraped it close to the bone, as we have said, or with hooks, or with another acute instrument.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas quae sunt in sectione, usque ubi potes cum perscrutatione.	Then drain the bloody parts which are left after the dissection, until the bone is firm with the mark of the incision
Deinde conare restaurationem uulneris totius cum sectione, et orificio superiore ubi consolidatur: et remanet Fistula aperta in interiore parte anus, et erit leuius super infirmum.	Then attempt to restore the entire wound with the incision, and the upper orifice where it is consolidated: and there remains an open fistula in the inner part of the anus, and it is better to leave it open
Et quandoque suitur Fistula secundum hunc modum: et est, quando intromittis tentam in Fistulam: et est in latere ani circa superficiem corporis cum cute et margine ani: tunc accipe tentam perforatae extremitatis, quae est sicut acus aleskef, id est, praeparantium coria, secundum hanc formam.	And when the fistula is to be sutured in this way: when you introduce the hook into the fistula: and it is on the side of the anus around the surface of the body with skin and the margin of the anus: then grasp the hook pierced through the end, which is like a needle with a head, that is, preparing the skin, according to this form
Et intromitte in eam filum inuolutum ex quinque filis, et circiter ea.	And introduce into it a thread wound from five threads, and pass it around these.
Deinde intromitte tentam cum filo in Fistulam, donec consequatur concauitatem eius.	And introduce the hook with the thread into the fistula, until you have reached its concavity
Si ergo est penetrans in margine ani interius prope, tunc extrahe filum ex illo foramine: ita ut intromittas digitum tuum in anum, et extrahas extremitatem fili, et aggreges duas extremitates simul: et stringe utramque, et dimitte illud die uno, aut duobus diebus: et quanto plus incidit filum in carne, stringe ipsum bene, donec incidantur illae carnes quae sunt inter duas extremitates fili, et cadant: deinde cura uulnus, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	If there is a puncture in the inner margin of the anus close to the bone, then draw out the thread from that hole: so that you can introduce your finger into the anus, and draw out the end of the thread, and join the two ends together: and bind them as much as necessary: until those parts which are between the two ends of the thread have become soft and fallen away: then cure the wound, until it is consolidated and healed
Si autem orificium Fistulae non est penetrans: tunc fac ipsum penetrare quocunque modo praeparatur tibi, nisi sit in profundo multum.	If the opening of the fistula is not penetrable: then make it so by whatever means are prepared, except if it is in great depth.
Non enim inest tibi, ut facias illud propter lacertum, ut non incidas ipsum.	Except that you do not make it wide open by means of a laceration, lest you destroy it.
Deinde fac cum ea sicut diximus, donec sanetur.	Do so then as we have said, until it is healed.
Forma Spatumilis spinosi quo finditur Fistula, cuius curuitas est acuta ualde, et pars altera est non acuta, ut non incidat illud quod non est necesse, sicut uides.	Shape the sponge-rubber as it is found, concerning the fistula, whose curve is acute above and blunt below, and the other part is not acute, so that you do not damage that which is not necessary, like water
¶ De sutura Hemorroidarum, ex quibus currit sanguis ex incisione earum: et cura fissurarum.	Concerning the stitching of hemorrhoids from which blood runs from the incision of them: and the care of the incisions.
Caput LXXXI.	Chapter 81.
Sunt Hemorroides secundum duos modos.	There are hemorrhoids in two ways.
Aut enim sunt intra anum, similes uesicis carbonum, uel prunarum: aut quasi ipsae sint grana uuae.	They are either inside the rectum, like little stones of the intestines or dates: or they are like little seeds of wheat
Et ex eis sunt paruae, et magnae: et sanguis currit ex eis semper, et est una, et sunt multae.	And they are small and great: and blood runs from them always, and there is one of them, and there are many of them.
Et sunt extra anum, et in extremitatibus eius.	And they are outside the rectum, and at their extremities
Verumtamen istae quae sunt extra anum, sunt secundum plurimum paucae humiditatis, ex quibus currit aqua citrina, aut parum sanguinis cursu assiduo: et sunt secundum colorem corporis.	However, those which are outside the rectum are mostly small and moist, from which runs clear urine, or a little blood slowly: and they are of different colors of the body
Et curatio eius quae est intra anum, est, ut praecipias infirmo ut assellet: et exprimatur, donec egrediatur anus, et appareant athelil tibi.	And the care of those which are inside the rectum is that you urge the patient to bear down: and evacuate, until the anus appears, and the little one comes out.
Propterea ergo et suspende cum uncinis: aut tene eos cum ungue tuo.	Therefore, do this also with stitches: or hold it with your finger
Deinde incide eos apud radices suas.	Then cut through at the roots of them
Si autem non retinentur in eis uncini, propter humiditatem eorum et ipsorum mollificationem: tunc cape eos cum panno aspero, aut cum coto ex diploide lanea, et extrahe eos cum digitis tuis.	If they do not remain in the wound due to the humidity of the air and their softness: then cover them with rough linen cloth, or with a coat of lanolin from a sheep's wool, and extract them with your fingers.
Deinde incide eos, et pulueriza super eos post incisionem quosdam pulueres calidos, ut stent eis loco cauterii.	Then pierce the wound, and sprinkle over it after incision any fine, warm powder, so that they remain in the place of the cautery.
Aut cauteriza eos secundum quod praecessit in capitulo cauterizandi.	Or cauterize them according to what was mentioned in the chapter on cautery.
Deinde cura eos cum reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then care for the wound with the remaining treatment until it heals.
Quod si non obedit anus egressioni, tunc clisteriza infirmum clisteri in quo sit mordicatio parua, ut lauetur cum eo quod est in ano, et obediat egressioni uelociter, quando exprimit se infirmus.	If it does not obey the opening of the anus, then give the patient a suppository in the rectum where there is a small bite, so that it will be evacuated with the feces, and the patient will soon evacuate it when it is expelled naturally.
Si autem athelil sunt extrinseci ab ano, tunc res eorum est leuis, facilis: et est ut capias eos cum ungue tuo, aut capias eos cum uncino, et incidas eos.	If they are nevertheless extruded from the anus, then it is a light matter, easy: grasp them with your finger or grasp them with a forceps, and cut them off.</start_of_turn>
Deinde cura eos cum eo quod diximus, donec sanentur.	Then care for the wound as we have said until it heals
Et qui abhorret incisionem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut administres suturam eorum secundum hunc modum.	And whoever dislikes an incision with a knife, then he must administer a suture of them in this way.
Accipe filum inuolutum, et intromitte ipsum in acum.	Take a thread that has been twisted, and introduce it into the substance.
Deinde extrahe athelil ad superiora, et fac ipsum penetrare cum acu in radice eius ex parte altera: et inuolue duas extremitates fili, in inferiori parte acus, et sint latitudinaliter: et stringe athelil strictura forti.	Then extract the foreign bodies upwards, and make it penetrate with the needle at its root from the opposite side: and loop two extremities of the thread, in the lower part of the needle, and let them be parallel: and tighten the foreign bodies with a strong suture.</start_of_turn>
Deinde noda filum, et extrahe acum.	Then knot the thread, and extract the needle.</start_of_turn>
Fac illud cum omnibus athelil, et dimitte ex eis unum: nec suas ipsum, ut currat ex eo superfluitas sanguinis.	Do this with all the foreign bodies, and discharge from the wound one at a time: neither leaving them, lest there be excessive bleeding.</start_of_turn>
Deinde pone super anum pannum infusum in oleo rosato, aut caeroto, et pone ipsum super anum: et praecipe infirmo, ut quiescat.	Then place upon the wound an infused cloth in rose-water, or vinegar, and place the latter upon the wound: and command the patient to rest.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, donec cadat.	Then leave it until it falls off naturally.</start_of_turn>
Cum ergo cadunt athelil, cura eos cum unguentis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	When it falls off by itself, care for it with unguents, and remain attentive until healed.</start_of_turn>
¶ De cura Fissurarum.	(The text continues with instructions for treating wounds.)</start_of_turn>
Multotiens enim accidunt ex exiccatione stercoris, et constrictione naturae.	Many are caused by the evacuation of feces, and the constriction of nature.</start_of_turn
Cum ergo antiquantur, et non ualet in eis medicina: tunc oportet ut radas cum puncta Spatumilis, aut cum ungue tuo, donec fiant humidae, et auferatur ab eis cortex superior qui prohibet eas a consolidatione.	When these things have been evacuated, and do not avail in medicine: then it is necessary to apply a sponge with Spatumilian seeds, or with your finger, until they become moist, and the outer layer is scraped away which hinders adhesion.</start_of_turn
Deinde cura eas, donec consolidentur secundum quod oportet.	Then care for the wound, until it is consolidated as it should be.</start_of_turn
Si autem non consolidantur: tunc itera eas cum rasione uehementiori quam prima, donec sanguinentur multum, et excorientur deinde cura eas, donec sanentur.	If, however, they do not consolidate: then repeat the wound with greater reason than before, until much blood flows, and then care for the wound until it heals.</start_of_turn
¶ De curatione Almirmar inuersorum, et non inuersorum: et Athelil siccorum, et Formicae.	(The text continues with instructions for treating various ailments.)</start_of_turn
Caput LXXXII.	(The book continues with further medical instructions.)</start_of_turn>
Scias quod Almirmar non est nisi nodus rotundus secundum colorem corporis, similis capiti claui: et fit in toto corpore, praecipue in inferioribus partibus pedum, et digitis: et accidit ex eis dolor apud ambulationem.	You know that Almirmar is not except a round knot according to the color of the body, similar to a claw head: and it occurs throughout the body, especially in the lower parts of the legs and fingers: and it happens from pain in walking.</start_of_turn
Oportet ergo ut secetur quod est in circumitu claui, et teneatur cum forficibus, aut cum uncino, et eradicetur ex radice sua.	It is necessary therefore to cut around the claw and hold it with forceps, or with a needle, and eradicate it from its root.</start_of_turn
Deinde cura illud: et si uis cauteriza illud secundum quod praecessit in capitulo suo.	Then care for that: and if you wish to cauterize that, do so according to what precedes in its chapter.
Ex athelil autem siccis unus est eminentia parua, aspera, filtrata, rotunda supra superficiem corporis.	However, from the heel thus a small, rough, filtered, rounded elevation appears on the surface of the body.
Et multotiens accidunt in manibus puerorum.	And they often happen in the hands of children.
Et curatio eius est, ut extendas athelil, et incidas ipsum: aut stringas ipsum cum filo de serico: aut cum pilo, donec cadat.	And its care is that you extend the heel and cut it through: or you bind it with a silken thread: or with hair, until it falls off
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum secundum quod praemissum est cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta: et iam eradicantur athelil inuersi, et non inuersi cum instrumento quod ego dicam.	And if you wish, cauterize it according to what is prescribed with fire, or with acute medicine: and thus the heel will be eradicated both inwards and outwards, not inwards alone with the instrument that I speak of
Formica autem est etiam eminentia parua filtrata, grossa, super superficiem corporis, uadens in profundum ualde: et quando inuenit eam frigus, sentitur in ea simile mordicationi formicae, et fit in corpore toto: et plurimum eius fit in manibus.	A worm is also a small, filtered elevation, large, on the surface of the body, which extends inwards to the depth of the ulcer: and when it comes into contact with cold, it feels like the bite of a worm in it, and it causes pain throughout the body, and most of all in the hands
Et curatio eius est, ut accipias cannulam ex penna anseris, aut penna uulturis forti: et pone illam cannulam super Formicam, donec contineat circulus cannulae ex partibus eius.	And its care is that you take a needle from the beak of an ostrich, or a strong quill, and put it over the worm, until it is surrounded by the circumference of the needle around its parts
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum cannula, donec seces quod est in circumitu Formicae: et ponas eam in profundo carnis, et eradices Formicam ex radice eius.	Then withdraw your hand with the needle, until you have severed what is around the worm: and you put it into the depth of the flesh, and extract the worm from its root.
Et si uis, fac illud cum cannula aeris, aut ferri, secundum hanc formam.	And if you wish, do it with an air needle, or a needle of iron, according to this form
Sit superius cannulae ad sublimitatem trahens surdum inuolutum, ut alleuietur super digitum apprehensio eius et ipsius reuolutio.	Let the upper part of the needle reach the thickness of the surrounding skin, so that it may alleviate the tension on the thumb and its retraction
Et si uis cauteriza Formicam secundum quod praemissum est in cauterizatione Athelil in capitulo de cauterio.	And if you wish, cauterize the worm according to what is prescribed in the chapter on cauterization of the heel.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum quae administrantur ad Clisteria in aegritudinibus Ani, et solutionis uentris, et colicae.	Concerning the forms of instruments which are administered to patients in ailments of the belly and intestines, and the solution of the belly and the intestines.
Caput LXXXIII.	Concerning the forms of instruments which are administered to patients in ailments of the belly and intestines, and the solution of the belly and intestines.
Quandoque Clistere fit ex argento, aut ex aurichalco, aut ex aere fuso, aut malleato.	When the intestines are made of silver, or gold, or blown glass, or hammered out.
Et quandoque fit ex istis Instrumentis paruum, et magnum, secundum illos in quibus administrantur.	And when these instruments are made of small and large sizes, according to those which are administered
Illud ergo quod administratur in curatione puerorum paruorum, sit paruum: et quorum ani sunt debiles, aut dolorosi, sic et clisteria eorum.	This is what is administered in the treatment of young children with loose bowels, be they weak or painful, so also with clisteria
Clistere magnum.	Large intestines
Cistere paruum.	Small intestines
Canna eius, id est, caput superius in quo ligatur uter, sit amplum secundum hunc modum: et sit ei distinctio ut ligetur uter sicut uides, et extremitas eius inferior quae intromittitur in anum, sit surda, id est, non aperta, lenis, ualde, trahens ad subtilitatem: et in uno laterum eius sint duo foramina, et in latere altero foramen unum.	The upper part of the head which is bound up by the uterus, be it wide according to this manner: and that it has a distinction so that the uterus is bound up like water, and the lower part of it which enters the belly be closed, hard, blunt, stretching to thinness: and on one side of it are two holes, and on the other side one hole
Et sit amplitudo foraminis secundum grossitudinem radiorum, et grossius parum, et sit uter in quo ponuntur medicinae ex uesica animalis: aut ex charta ouis, quae sit secundum formam asofrati paruae: cuius radix sit palmus unus.	And the breadth of the hole according to the length of the ribs, and more widely a little, and the uterus in which the medicines are placed from the belly of the beast: or from paper wool, which is like the shape of the small asphodel: whose root is one palm
Et perforetur foraminibus multis sicut reuoluitur, et sit spacium quod est inter omne foramen grossitudo digiti.	And it is perforated with many holes as it is turned, and there is space between every hole the size of a finger
Deinde intromitte in illa foramina filum forte ex filo crudo, quod sit ex decem filis, aut circiter ea, et aggrega cum eo utrem sicut asofrati.	Then insert into these holes a strong thread from a strong thread, which is from ten threads, or thereabouts, and gather with it like asphodel.
Cum ergo ponitur in eo uter, stringatur in capite clisteris inter duo distinguentia constrictione forti.	When it is thus placed in this uterus, it is bound up in the head of the clister between two distinguishing constrictions strong
Deinde clisteriza cum eo.	Then anoint the cavity with oil.
Et haec est forma circuli utris hic depicta, et foraminum.	This is the form of the circle here depicted, and of holes.
Qualitas autem clisterizandi cum eo, est: ut impleas utrem, aut uesicam ex medicina, quae sit calefacta secundum quantitatem tolerantiae infirmi: et caue ne sit calida ualde, aut frigida ualde.	The quality of the anointing with oil is this: that you apply as much of the belly, or from the medicine, as is appropriate for the tolerance of the patient: and take care that it is neither too hot nor too cold, neither too warm nor too cold.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et eleuet crura sua ad superiora: et pone sub eo inthaan, id est, corium super quod iacent homines, aut linteamen.	Then the patient lies on his back, and raises his legs towards the head: and put under it fat, that is, skin which men lie upon, or lint
Deinde inunge extremitatem Clisteris cum oleo, aut cum albugine oui, aut cum mucillagine foenugraeci, aut similium.	Then anoint the area with oil, or with alum, or with barley mucilage, or similar things.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in anum cum facilitate.	Then introduce the instrument into the cavity with ease.
Deinde accipiat minister utrem cum duabus manibus suis simul, et exprimat ipsum cum uehementia, donec euacuet totum quod est in Clisteri in intestinum.	Then take hold of the belly with two hands simultaneously, and press it out with force, until it has evacuated everything that is in the cavity of the Clister into the intestines
Deinde extrahe Clistere, et eleuet infirmus crura sua ad parietem.	Then remove the Clister, and raise the patient's legs to the side
Quod si medicina cogit eum ad exitum, tunc teneat quantum potest.	And if the medicine compels you to remove it, then hold for as long as you can.
Et si dormit cum ea nocte tota, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if he sleeps through the whole night, it is the greatest remedy.
Si autem clisterizas eum in aegritudinibus solutionis uentris, et festinat exitus eius: tunc itera clistere, donec sanetur.	If however you anoint him in the ailments of the bowels of the belly, and he has a speedy recovery: then repeat the Clister until he is healed.
Quod si in ano sunt hemorroides, aut apostemata laedentia, tunc sit clistere subtile ualde, lene, ex clisteribus quibus clisterizantur pueri.	If there are hemorrhoids or abscesses of pain: then let the Clister be gentle and cold, soft, from the Clisters which are used to anoint children
Et haec sit forma clisteris subtilis super quod sit stricta cutis.	And this is the form of the gentle Clister which is over the strictness of the skin.
¶ De curatione Vulnerum capitis sine fractura ossis.	On the treatment of wounds of the head without fracture of the bone.
Caput LXXXIIII.	Head wound without bone fracture.
Iam dixi in diuisione de curatione uulnerum quod conueniebat libro, et ego dicam hic curationem eorum cum manu, et cum medicinis secundum complementum.	I have said in the discussion of wound treatment that it agrees with the book, and I will now speak of their treatment with the hand and with the help of physicians as a supplement.
Dico ergo, quod uulnera diuersificantur secundum illud quo fiunt uulnera, et secundum locum super quem cadit uulnus.	I say, therefore, that wounds are varied according to the nature of the wound and the place where the wound falls
Res ergo quibus fiunt uulnera multotiens, sunt sicut iactus lapidis: aut incisio ensis, aut cultelli: aut percussio cum lancea, aut ligno, aut sagitta: et similibus illis ex rebus multis.	The nature of wounds is diverse, as are the impacts of a stone: either an incision with a sword or knife, or a blow with a lance, stick, or arrow, and the like
Vulnera autem quae fiunt secundum loca corporis sunt, sicut uulnus quod cadit super caput, aut collum, aut pectus, aut uentrem, aut epar: et similia ex eis membris.	Wounds, however, which are caused by the place of the body, are like those which fall on the head, or the neck, or the chest, or the stomach, or the limbs: and the like from various parts of the body.
Et ego sum narrans curationes quorundam uulnerum, ut ponam eam ratiocinationem et regulam super reliqua uulnera.	And I shall speak of the treatment of some wounds, in order to set out the ratiocination and rule regarding the rest of the wounds.
Et ego incipiam a uulneribus capitis simplicibus: quoniam rememoratio compositorum ueniet in principio capituli tertii.	I will begin with simple head wounds: because the memory of composite matters will come at the beginning of the third chapter of the head.
Dico ergo.	I say.
Quando accidit in capite uulnus simplex, et non est fractura ossis: considera tunc, si est ex iactu lapidis, aut ei similibus, et iam fregit cutem tantum: et est uulnus magnum, et times super infirmum euentum apostematis calidi: tunc propera, et phlebotoma cephalicam statim: et non tardes illud: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius: si non fuerit prohibens aliquid a phlebotomia, praecipue si fuerit sanguis qui egreditur ex uulnere paucus.	When in the head there is a simple wound and there is no fracture of the bone: consider then, if it is from the impact of a stone, or like it, and if the skin is only bruised: and it is a great wound and the time is great for an inflamed swelling of the head: then act immediately, and perform a cephalic phlebotomy: and do not delay: and extract from him blood according to the quantity of his virtue: if there is nothing to prevent phlebotomy, especially if there is little blood coming from the wound.
Et sit phlebotomia ex contrario partis uulneratae.	And let the phlebotomy be from the opposite side of the wounded part.
Et caueat infirmus sibi a repletione, et uino, et cibis grossis.	And let the patient abstain from repletion, from wine, and from coarse food
Si autem minutionem prohibet aliquid, tunc minoretur ex cibo, et non appropinquet carnibus, neque uinis.	But if anything hinders the reduction, then one should abstain from food, and not approach meat, nor drink wine.
Et pone super uulnus si accidit ei apostema calidum, cotum infusum in oleo rosato solo, aut cum uino in quo est stipticitas.	And let there be placed upon the wound if it happens to have a thick clot, a soft cushion filled with fat, or with wine in which there is stickiness
Si autem securus fueris ab apostemate calido, tunc pone super uulnus, si est recens cum sanguine suo, et non mutauit ipsum aer, puluerem quem ego narrabo post paululum: et si iam mutauit ipsum aer, tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, donec sanetur.	And if you are certain that the clot is thick, then place upon the wound, if it exists with its own blood, and has not changed the air, the powder which I will tell you about later: and if it has changed the air, then place upon it some unguents until it is healed
Si autem uulnus est magnum, aut est ex incisione ensis, et similium: et non aggregantur labia eius per puluillos, tunc aggrega ipsa cum sutura, secundum quod ego narrabo in uulneribus uentris de sutura eorum.	And if the wound is large, or has been made by a sword, and is similar: and the edges of it are not to be held together by threads, then gather them together with sutures, as I shall tell you concerning the sutures of wounds within in the same way
Si autem uulnus iam detectum est ab osse, et pendet, et non est retentio eius, nisi in suspensorio paruo: tunc incide ipsum.	And if the wound has been detected from a bone, and hangs, and its retention is not necessary except for a small suspension: then cut it through
Deinde cura uulnus cum medicinis, et restaura in eo carnem duram loco cutis, et praecipe infirmo, ut alatur cibis in quibus est grossitudo, sicut sunt capita, et triticum coctum, donec sit ut puls: et eis similia.	Then care for the wound with the physicians, and restore in it solid flesh in the place of the skin, and command the patient, let him eat foods in which there is greatness, such as heads, and barley cooked, until the pulse is like this: and the like
Quod si inuenis in cute putrefactionem, et non adhaeret ossi: tunc incide putrefactum totum, et proiice ipsum: deinde cura illud.	When you find in the flesh putrefaction, and it does not adhere to the bone: then cut through the whole putrefaction, and throw it away: then care for that
Si autem in his uulneribus est arteria, aut uena ex qua fluit sanguis: et non abscinditur per medicinas, tunc inquire super arteriam.	And if in his wounds there is an artery, or a vein from which blood flows: and it is not to be clipped by the physicians, then inquire about the artery.
Si ergo inuenis eam non sectam, tunc seca eam cum Spatumili, aut liga eam.	If the wound is not closed, then dry it with Spatumili, or ligate it.
Quod si necessitas prouocat quando non confert illud quod diximus, tunc cauteriza eam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If necessity compels when it does not agree with what has been said, then cauterize the wound until the blood is separated
Si autem uulnera ista sunt parua, simplicia, tunc res eorum est facilis, leuis: ita ut puluerizes super ea hunc puluerem: quoniam consolidat ea antequam mutet ea aer.	If the wound is small and simple, then it is sufficient to sprinkle it with powder: because it strengthens them before they change from air.
¶ Modus Pulueris incarnatiui.	Method of applying powdered charcoal.
Recipe olibani partem unam, et sanguinis draconis partes duas, et calcis non extinctae partes tres: teratur totum multum, et cribelletur: et impleatur ex eo uulnus, et constringatur constrictione bona, donec adhaereat super ipsum bene, et coaguletur cum sanguine.	Recipe for olive oil, dragon's blood, and burnt lime. Mix one part of each together, and grind them to a fine powder. Apply this powder to the wound and bind it securely, until it adheres well and coaguates with the blood
Deinde stringe ipsum desuper cum puluillis, et dimitte ipsum, neque soluas ipsum dum permanet, ita quod non apostemetur.	Then string the wound over sponges, and let it go, without loosening it until it remains, so that it does not stick to the wound
Nam non eradicatur ab eo medicina, donec sanatur.	For it is not eradicated by medicine until it heals
Et quandoque facit illud calx sola, quando non sunt tibi in praesenti olibanum, et sanguis draconis etiam facit eandem operationem in multis ex uulneribus magnis, quando conuenit ut ponatur super ea et stringantur, et sunt uulnera recentia cum sanguine suo, quae non alterauit aer.	And when it does this with lime alone, when it is not joined with olive oil and dragon's blood, it does the same operation in many large wounds, when it is necessary to put it on and string them, and when the wound is fresh with its own blood, which has not changed from air
Quod si iam alterauit ea aer quadam alteratione, praecipue quando est in tempore aestatis, tunc non est in positione huius pulueris intentio: cura ergo ipsum cum eo quod diximus, ita ut ponas super ea quaedam unguenta digestiua: aut ponas super ea pultes ex farina hordei, factas cum aqua et melle, donec emittant pus.	When it has changed from air by any alteration, especially in the summer season, then it is not appropriate to apply this powder: rather care for the wound as we have said, by putting on over it some unguents of digestion: or put on over it balls of barley flour, made with water and honey, until pus comes out
Deinde cura ea reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then care for the rest of the treatment until it heals
Si uero accidat cum uulnere fractura in osse, et est parua, tunc extrahe illud cum Gesti: et ego iam dicam curationem fracturarum capitis in eo quod futurum est.	If indeed it happens that a fracture occurs with a wound in a bone and is small, then extract that with Gesti: and I will tell you the treatment of fractures of the head in that which the future is.
¶ De uulneribus Colli.	Of head wounds.
Caput LXXXV.	Head wound section.
SI Autem uulnus accidat in Collo, tunc non est inter ipsum differentia in medicatione, et inter uulnus capitis quando est simplex.	If indeed it happens that a wound occurs in the head, then there is no difference in treatment between it and a simple head wound
Si autem iam incisus est neruus Colli, aut arteria: tunc si est neruus, non est in eo ingenium, nisi ut deuitetur curatio eius cum eo quod facit stipticitatem uehementem, sicut ziniar, et zegi, et eis similia.	If, however, the nerve or an artery is cut: then if it is the nerve, it is not in vain, unless its cure be sought with that which makes hemostasis immediate, as for example, sponges and sponges of silk and things of that kind
Quoniam nocent neruis, et contrahunt eos.	For the nerves are not known, and they are contraacted by them.
Et non ponas super uulnus aliquid frigidum omnino: quoniam substantia neruorum est frigida, et continuatio eius est cum cerebro, quod est sublimius membrorum: et sit illud quo curatur ex medicinis lene, sicut calx lota cum aqua dulci aliquotiens infusa cum oleo, aut cum oleo rosato, et tuthia, quando abluitur etiam cum aqua dulci: et reliqui lapides minerales, secundum hunc modum, et unguenta humida.	You must not put anything cold upon the wound at all: for the substance of nerves is cold, and its continuation is with the brain, which is the soul of the limbs: and let that be which is cured by the physicians gently, as for example, lime with sweet water occasionally infused with oil, or with rose oil, and alum, when it is washed away even with sweet water: and the rest of the mineral stones, according to this method, and moist unguents.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, tunc administra suturam: aut coarta labia eius cum puluillis.	If however the wound is great, then administer a suture: or close its lips with pieces of wool.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it until it is healed
Si uero uulneri est profunditas, aut accidit in eo sinus in inferiori parte eius, in quo iam aggregatur pus, tunc perfora ipsum in magis depresso loco in eo.	If indeed the wound is depth, or has occurred in that sinus in the lower part of it, in which pus is gathered, then perforate it in the lowest place in that.
Quod si iam incisa est in uulnere arteria, et consecutus est sanguinem eius fluxus: tunc separa, uel seca eam, et liga ipsam: aut cauteriza eam, si prouocat necessitas ad illud.	If indeed a blood vessel has been cut, and its blood flow has followed: then separate it, or dry it up, and ligate it: or cauterize it, if need be for that
Si autem iam incidit spondiles gutturis, aut totum, et saluatae sunt alhaudegi: tunc aggrega labia cutis cum sutura super cannam gutturis, et non tangas guttur, imo aequa ipsum, et reduc ipsum super figuram naturalem.	If, however, the cheekbones of the gullet have been fractured, either entirely or partially, and the soft parts are protruded: then join the lips of the skin with a suture above the canthus of the gullet, and do not touch the gullet, but rather equalize it with itself, and reduce it above its natural position.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti, et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot.	Then bind it with a loose dressing, and discharge it in a few days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis in quibus est stipticitas et exiccatio, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with poultices in which there is styptic and drying action, until it has healed.
Si autem uulnus iam fecit impressionem in osse, tunc perquire ipsum: tunc si in ipso sunt fragmenta ossis, extrahe ea omnia, aut quae potes ex eis: et quod non praeparatur, dimitte illud, donec putrescat uulnus, et separetur et alleuietur egressio eius.	If, however, a nail has made an impression in the bone, then investigate it: then if there are fragments of bone in the same, remove them all, or whatever can be extracted from it: and whatever cannot be prepared, discharge it, until the nail has rotted away, and the swelling has subsided.
Quod si uulnus fuerit recens, tunc pulueriza super ipsum puluerem quem narraui.	And if the nail should be broken, then grind over it the powder which I have mentioned before.
Si autem uidetur in uulnere os, et fit Fistula: tunc cura ipsam cum eo cuius rememoratio uenit in capitulo suo.	If, however, bone is seen in the nail, and a fistula has formed: then care for it as described in its chapter.
¶ De uulnere in Spatulis.	Of a nail in the teeth.
Caput LXXXVI.	Chapter 86.
SI Est percussio lanceae, aut cultelli: et uides eius profunditatem, tunc considera.	If there is a percussion of a lance or a knife, and you see its depth, then consider it
Si ergo ex uulnere egreditur uentositas, quando anhelat ex eo infirmus, tunc scias, quia uulnus est mortale.	If, however, from the wound blood comes out when the patient breathes, you know that the nail is deadly
Quod si non fuerit ei profunditas, et est recens cum sanguine suo: tunc non ponas in eo a prima hora puluerem, neque stringas ipsum, ut non retineatur sanguis in profunditate eius, et reuertatur ad cor, et interficiat infirmum: sed pone in ipso unguentum attractiuum, et solue ipsum in die bis.	If it is not of great depth, and is merely bruised with blood, do not immediately grind or bind it, lest you prevent the blood from draining from its depth, but bring the hand to the heart, and cut off the patient: but put in it a pleasant poultice, and leave it for two days
Si uero unguentum non est tibi praesens, tunc pone in orificio uulneris cotum uetustum, ut sugat illud quod egreditur de eo ex humiditatibus: et fac ut dormiat infirmus super uulnus, ut currat quod aggregatur in eo.	If the unguentum is not present, then place in the opening of the wound a wool cushion which has been well-worn, so that it may absorb what is coming out of it from the humilities: and let the patient sleep over the wound, so that it may heal what has aggregated in it.
Si uero iam praeterierint uulneri tres dies, aut plures, et non accidit infirmo spasmus, neque tremor cordis malus, neque strictura in anhelitu, et uides reliquas dispositiones eius bonas: tunc scias, quia uulnus est saluum.	If, however, for three days or more the wound has passed without causing the patient pain, nor spasm of the heart, nor bad tremor, nor stricture of the bowels, and all other symptoms have ceased, then you know that the wound is healed.</start_of_turn>
Cura ergo ipsum et cum liciniis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Care for it therefore with care and with medicines, and with the rest of the treatment, until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
Si uero excusatur sanatio eius, et iam aperitur semper, tunc scias, quia iam factum est Fistula.	If, however, the healing is excused, and it always opens, then you know that a fistula has been made.</start_of_turn
Cura ergo ipsam ex capitulo suo.	Care for it therefore from its chapter.</start_of_turn
Et si uulnus est ex incisione ensis, aut cultelli, et est simplex in superficie pectoris, aut dorsi: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit ex sutura, si est magnum: aut cum puluere, si est paruum.	And if the wound is from the incision of a sword or a knife, and is simple on the surface of the chest or back: then care for it with that which preceded the suture, if it is great: or with powder, if it is small.</start_of_turn
Si autem iam fecit impressionem in osse, et incidit ex eo frusta: tunc inquire uulnus, et propera ad extrahendum illa frusta, si sunt separata.	If, however, there is an impression made in the bone, and it breaks through from it: then inquire about the wound, and properly remove that which is separated.</start_of_turn
Si uero non sunt separata, tunc dimitte ea, donec putrefiat uulnus, alleuiatur enim extractio eorum.	If, however, they are not separated, then leave them alone, until the wound putrefies, so that the extraction may be easier.</start_of_turn
Reliquorum autem uulnerum accidentium in reliquis membris iudicium in curatione, est iudicium eius quod diximus.	As for the rest of the accidents of wounds in the rest of the limbs, the judgement in their treatment is their own which we have already said.</start_of_turn
¶ De uulneribus Ventris, et exitu intestini, et exitura eorum.	Of wounds of the belly, and the issue of the intestine, and the issue of them.</start_of_turn
Caput LXXXVII.	Chapter LXXXVII.
Disruptio quae accidit uentri, est magna, et media, et parua.	The disruption that occurs at the entrance is great, medium, or small.
Ex magna igitur quandoque egreditur intestinum, aut numerus intestinorum.	From the great there is sometimes the extrusion of the intestine, or the number of intestines
Quare fit intromissio eorum, et eorum sutura uehementior et difficilior.	Therefore the handling of these things is more difficult and more complex
Et disruptio parua etiam fit difficilis ex modo alio.	And even the small disruption is difficult in another way.
Sequitur ergo, ut sit reductio eorum difficilior, si non properas in intromissione sua ad locum suum statim: quoniam inflatur, aperitur, et ingrossatur: quare fit difficilis introitus eius.	Therefore, it is necessary that the reduction should be performed immediately if you do not want to be delayed by the inflation, opening out and swelling of the bowels: for this makes the passage difficult
Propter hoc ergo fit melior disruptionum disruptio media: quoniam cum ea non fit difficilis reductio intestini, sicut fit dissicilis in his duabus speciebus.	For this reason, therefore, the medium disruption is better: because with this one the reduction of the intestine is not difficult, as it is with the great and small disruptions
Scias, quod sutura uenris est secundum quatuor modos.	You know that the suture of the belly is according to four methods.
Duae suturae communes conueniunt in sutura uentris, et in sutura reliquorum uulnerum corporis: et duae suturae aliae proprie communicant reliquis uulneribus.	Two sutures are common to join the sutures of the belly, and in the sutures of the remaining wounds of the body: and two other sutures are proper for the remaining wounds.
Verumtamen sunt magis propriae cum sutura uentris: et ego narro tibi unamquamque cum expositione, et declaratione.	However, these are more proper with the suture of the belly: and I will tell you one and the same with exposure and declaration.
Dico ergo, quia quando uulnus est paruum, et egreditur ex eo aliquid ex intestino, et fit difficile reducere ipsum: tunc illud est propter unum duorum modorum.	I say therefore, that when the wound is small and something from the intestine comes out of it, and it is difficult to reduce it: then that is because of one of the two ways
Aut propter paruitatem disruptionis, sicut diximus: Aut quoniam in intestino est inflatio propter frigus aeris.	Either because of the smallness of the disruption, as we have said: or because there is inflation in the intestine due to the cold of the air.
Quando ergo illud est ita, tunc oportet ut calefacias ipsum, ita ut submergas spongiam, aut pannum humidum in aqua tepida sola.	When this is the case, it is necessary to heat it up, so as to compress the sponge or wet cloth in lukewarm water alone
Aut decoquas in aqua squinantum, et cyperum, et spicam, et embroces cum ea intestinum, donec resoluatur inflatio.	Pour the decoction in water, let there be a squinquit of saffron, a cyperum, a spicam, and embroces with the intestines until the swelling is resolved.
Quandoque facit illud uinum in quo est stipticitas: et est melius quam aqua sola in resolutione inflationis.	When it has been made in that liquid in which there is stickiness: it is better than water alone in the resolution of the swelling.
Cum ergo uides inflationem iam resolui, tunc humecta intestinum cum aqua in qua decocta est altea, aut malua.	When the swelling has been resolved, then moisten the intestines with the water in which the decoction has been made, either hot or cold.
Nam per illud alleuiatur introitus eius cum re parua.	For in this way it will soothe the entrance of it with a little thing.
Si autem excusatur reditus eius post hanc curationem, tunc finde in disruptione parum, cum instrumento quo secantur hemorrhoides.	If however its return is excused after this treatment, then find in a slight disruption, with the instrument with which hemorrhoids are cut off.
Et curatio prima est melior quando praeparatur, quam sectio: et non fit coactio ad secandum post necessitatem et defectum instrumenti.	And the first treatment is better when it is prepared than when it is cut: and it does not cause a forced compression to stop after the necessity and the defect of the instrument
Sit pars eius una quae est torta, acuta, et pars eius altera non acuta, et extremitas subtilis non sit cum subtilitate Spatumilis, imo sit obtusior parumper: et est illa quae similatur caiada, sicut uides.	Let one part be acute and the other not acute, and the extremity not be harsh like that of Spatumilis, but rather be softer: and that which is similar to a chick, like water
Cum ergo amplificatur uulnus, et ingreditur intestinum, tunc oportet, ut sit reductio eius secundum formam suam naturalem in loco suo sibi proprio, si possibile est super illud: quoniam est melius.	When the swelling has been increased and the intestine has entered, then it should be supported, so that there is a reduction of it according to its natural form in its own place, if possible over that: for that is better
Quando uero disruptio est ampla in inferiori parte uentris: tunc oportet ut facias iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et pone crura sua altiora capite suo.	When however the disruption is wide in the lower part of the belly: then it should be made to lie upon its back, and put its knees higher than its head.
Et si est in superiore parte uentris, tunc pone caput eius, et pectus ipsius altiora quam eius inferiora.	And if it is in the upper part of the belly, then put its head and its chest higher than its lower parts
Et similiter si est disruptio in una duarum partium uentris, tunc pone intentionem tuam, et tuam considerationem semper in hoc, ut pars in qua est uulnus sit altior parte altera.	And in the same way, if there is a disruption in one of the two parts of the belly, then put your intention and your consideration always in this, that the part in which there is a swelling be higher than the other part.
Et ita oportet, ut admimistres illud in uulneribus magnis, et in uulneribus mediis.	And thus it is necessary, that the physicians should consider this in great wounds, and in medium wounds.
In uulneribus autem paruis, pone illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	In small wounds, place it according to what is prepared for thee.
Deinde fac ut sit praesens inter manus tuas minister pius, qui teneat disruptionem totam manu sua: et aggrega labia eius.	Then make it so that it be present between thy hands, the minister who holds the whole hand together: and join together its lips.
Deinde detege ex ea ei qui sequitur suturam aliquid post aliquid: et iste est modus suturae communis unius.	Then draw from this that which follows the suture something after something: and this is the way of common suture of one
Et est, ut accipias acum, aut numerum acuum secundum quantitatem amplitudinis uulneris.	And it is, that thou take an awl, or a number of awls according to the quantity of the size of the wound
Deinde dimitte ab extremitate disruptionis quantitatem digiti anularis, id est, medici: et fige acum unam praeter quod intromittas in eam filum in duabus extremitatibuis cutis, cum duabus extremitatibus sifac quod est sub cute ab interioribus, donec facias eam penetrare ab alia parte, et tu iam aggregasti duas extremitates cutis, et duas extremitates sifac: et fiunt quatuor ordines.	Then let go from the extremity of the disruption the quantity of the digit of the ring, that is, the physician: and fix the awl one before which thou intrude into the thread in two extremities of the skin, with two extremities of the fat which is under the skin from the inside, until thou make it penetrate from another part, and thou join together two extremities of the skin, and two extremities of the fat: and there are four orders formed.
Deinde stringe cum filo duplo in circumitu acus aliquotiens a duabus partibus simul, quousque sint aggregata duo labia uulneris aggregatione decenti.	Then string with a double thread around the circumference of the awl several times from two parts simultaneously, until two lips of the wound be aggregated by the gathering of descent.
Deinde dimitte grossitudinem digiti etiam, et fige in eis acum aliam: postea reta eam cum filo, sicut fecisti cum acu prima.	Then let go the length of the digit also, and fix in the flesh another awl: afterwards draw up the thread with the awl, as thou didst with the first awl.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum eo quo indiges ex acubus, donec compleas constrictionem uulneris totius.	Do not cease doing this until thou hast completed the constriction of the whole wound
Et sint acus mediae inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem: quoniam acus subtiles ualde uelociter incidunt carnem: et grossae sunt difficilis introitus in cutem: propter illud oportet ut sint mediae in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	And the awls be middle between the length and the thickness: because the fine awls slip easily from the flesh: and the thick ones are difficult to enter the skin: for this reason it is necessary that they be middle in thickness, and length
Et non oportet, ut figatur acus in duabus extremitatibus cutis propinquae multum: ut non incidatur caro uelociter, et aperiatur uulnus ante consolidationem sui, et non elongentur etiam cum sutura, ut non prohibeatur uulnus a consolidatione.	Neither must the needle be fixed at either end of the skin in such a way as to pierce the flesh too quickly, for this will open up the wound before it has time to consolidate. Neither must the needle be left too long, even when sutured, for this will prevent the wound from consolidating.
Deinde incide extremitatem acuum, ut non laedant infirmum apud somnum suum: et pone eis puluillos ex pannis ab omni parte, qui teneant extremitates acuum: et dimitte eos, donec scias quod uulnus iam consolidatum est.	Neither must the needle pierce the patient during sleep: and place small plugs of wool around the extremities of the needle, which will hold the needle in place: and remove them when you know that the wound has consolidated.
Et haec quidem species suturae cum acubus taliter est conuenientior in uulneribus paruis.	And thus is the kind of suture which is more suitable for small wounds.
Quoniam sufficit in sutura eorum acus una, aut duae, aut circiter eas.	For in the suture of these wounds, one or two needles or thereabouts are sufficient.
Sutura autem secunda communis est, ut aggreges cum sutura extremitates quatuor: extremitates, duas cutis, et extremitates duas sifac in uice una, cum acu in qua sit filum inuolutum aequale in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	The second kind of suture is common, as it joins together four extremities: two of the skin and two of the fat, with the needle passing through the middle of the thread equal in thickness and width
Deinde quando penetraueris cum acu has extremitates quatuor, reduc acum a parte a qua incaepisti eadem, ut cadat filum retatum a superiori parte uulneris: ut sit sutura, sicut sutura panni quo stringuntur panni, et pone inter omnem suturam quantitatem grossitudinis digiti minoris.	Then when you have pierced through with the needle, reduce the needle from the part from which you began, so that the thread is taut from the upper part of the wound: so that the suture is like the suture of cloth which is used to mend cloth, and put between every suture as much of the thickness of a small finger
Hanc autem suturam sciunt homines.	This kind of suture they know well
Et cum hac sutura ego sui uulnus quod acciderat uiro in uentre suo, qui fuerat uulneratus cum cultello, et erat disruptio uulneris maior palmo uno: et exierat ex intestinis circiter duos palmos ex intestino medio, et erat disruptio in medio uentris.	And when I did this suture to him, his wound which had occurred in his belly, which had been caused by a knife, and which had been burst open with a palm of the hand: and there was a break in the gut about two palms from the middle of the intestine, and there was a break in the middle of the belly.
Reduxi ergo illud postquam stetit intestinum eius extra uulnus xxiiii horis.	I reduced it therefore after I had made the gut outside the wound for twenty-four hours
Consolidatum est ergo uulnus in spacio quod fuit circiter XV dies: et curaui ipsum, et sanatus est: et uixit post illud annis multis, conuersatus in suis dispositionibus.	The limb has been consolidated in a space where it remained for about fifteen days. I cared for it and it has healed: and it has departed after many years, having returned to its normal state.
Et medici iudicauerant, quod non sanaretur.	The physicians had judged that it would not heal
Et ex miraculo fuit, quod non curaui illud cum unguento.	Yet miraculously, it healed without ointment
Quoniam fui in loco in quo non inueniebatur unguentum, neque aliquid ex medicinis.	Because I was in a place where unguentum was not to be found, neither did I use anything from the physicians.
Posui ergo super uulnus cotum uetustum bis in die, et assiduaui ablutionem eius cum aqua mellis, donec sanatum est.	I placed upon the limb a warm compress twice a day, and I diligently washed it with honey-water until it healed
Duas autem species suturae proprias dicam secundum narrationem sermonis.	Two kinds of sutures I shall declare in accordance with the narration of the sermon
Et est, ut incipias cum sutura acuta: et intromittas acum ab exteriori ad interiorem partem.	And it is that you begin with a sharp suture: and you insert the point from the outside towards the inside of the part.
Cum ergo penetrat acus in cutem, et in lacertum euntem secundum longitudinem et latitudinem totius corporis: dimitte extremitatem sifac in latere in quo intromisisti acum, et fac penetrare in extremitatem aliam ab interiori parte ad exteriorem in extremitate altera mirach.	When therefore the needle has penetrated the skin, and in the wound which you have made according to the length and breadth of the whole body: draw out the point in the side in which you inserted the point, and make penetrate from the inside part towards the outside in the opposite extremity
Cum ergo feceris eam penetrare, tunc fac eam penetrare secundum hoc in eadem hac extremitate mirach ab exteriori parte ad interiorem: et dimitte extremitatem sifac, quae est in hoc latere, et fac penetrare acum in extremitatem alteram ab interiori parte ad exteriorem: et fac penetrare cum penetratione tua qua facis eam penetrare in sifac extremitate mirach, quae est in parte eius, donec penetret in ipsum totum.	When you have thus made the needle penetrate, then make it penetrate again following this in the same limb from the outside towards the inside: and draw out the point which is in this side, and make the needle penetrate from the inside part towards the outside in the opposite limb: and draw out the point which is in this side, and make the needle penetrate with the penetration which you are making in the swelling of the limb which is in the part opposite to this one, until it penetrates the whole thing
Deinde incipe etiam ab hoc eodem latere, et sue ipsum cum extremitate, quae est ex sifac in latere alio, et extrahe acum ex cute quam penetrauit.	And begin also from this side and join it with the limb which is from the swelling in the other side, and draw out the point from the skin where it penetrated.
Deinde reduc eam in illam cutem, et sue extremitatem sifac, quae est in latere alio, cum hac extremitate mirach: et extrahe eam ex cute quae est ex parte eius, et fac illud uice una, et alia: et fac illud uice post uicem, usquequo suas extrinsecum totum secundum illud exemplum.	Then reduce the skin to that side, and separate the outer limit which is on the other side, along with this outer limit make a triangle: and extract the skin which is from the part of it, and make it one with the other, and the other make one after the other, until their outer limits are all in accordance with this example.
Et summa huius suturae, est ut suas sutura pellipariorum qua suunt pelles: ita ut suas sifac uice una ex parte una extremitate cutis: et ut dimittas eam uice alia ex parte alia, donec compleas.	And the sum of all these sutures is as the sutures of the skin which are made for the skin: thus as you separate one part from the other extremity of the skin: and as you send one part away from the other part, until you complete them
Secunda species suturae propriae, quam dixit Gale nus.	Second species of sutures, as Gale has said.
Iste eius sermo narratus est, ut suas eam secundum similitudinem, qua suunt eas quidam medicantium, ita quod aggregant omnem partem ad comparem suam conuenientem per naturam: et applicant extremitatem sifac ad eius aliam extremitatem, et extremitatem mirach ad extremitatem eius aliam.	This is the explanation given above: that their sutures are to be like those of certain physicians, who collect every part to the same extent as nature itself: and apply the outer limit to the other outer limit, and the outer limit of the triangle to the other outer limit.
Et illud fit secundum quod narro tibi.	And this is done according to what I have told you.
Oportet ut figas acum in extremitatem mirach propinquam tibi ab exteriori parte, et facias eam penetrare ad interiorem in eo solo: et dimittas duas extremitates sifac.	It is necessary to make the point of the triangle close to the exterior from the inside: and make the skin penetrate to the inside only in this place: and send away the two extremities of the triangle
Deinde reuolue acum, et fac eam penetrare ab exteriori parte ad interiorem in duas extremitates sifac, scilicet utrinque.	Then draw out the point, and make the skin penetrate from the exterior to the inside through two extremities of the triangle, namely on both sides
Deinde reuolue utrasque, etiam fac penetrare utrasque ab interiori usque ad exteriorem, in duas extremitates mirach alias, quae sunt in latere opposito.	Then draw out both of them, and also make them penetrate from the inside to the outside through two other triangles which are on the opposite side.
Et iste modus suturae est melior sutura communi facili, et est sutura cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And this method of suture is better than the common suture, and is a suture whose progress can be remembered.
Iste est ergo sermo Galeni etiam.	This is indeed what Galen has also said
Et dixerunt quidam.	And they said.
Retificatur sutura uentris cum duabus acubus.	The suture within is rectified with two squares.
Quod est, ut intromittas in eis utrisque filum unum: et incipe cum intromissione acus, ex eo quod est apud te, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, secundum suturam eorum qui suunt coria aequaliter.	When the suture is inside, it is rectified with two squares. That is, introduce through the flesh on both sides a single thread: and begin with the introduction of the needle from the side towards you, and make it penetrate until it reaches the opposite side, following the suture that is between the tissues equally
Et scias, quod quando disruptio est in medio uentris: tunc sutura eius est difficilior quam reliquorum locorum uentris.	You know that when there is a disruption in the middle of the abdomen: then the suture of that is more difficult than that of the rest of the abdominal cavity
Iudicium uero medicationis uulneris, est iudicium reliquorum uulnerum.	The judgment of the healing of a wound is the judgment of the rest of the wounds.
Quod est, quia quando tu consequeris uulnus recens cum sanguine suo, antequam alteret ipsum aer: et reducis intestinum, et suis ipsum, et aptas ipsum: tunc pone super puluerem incarnatiuum.	When you follow a wound with its blood, before it changes itself with air: reduce the intestine, and hold it in place, and then place above it the powder of burnt incense.
Quod si aer iam alterauit uulnus: tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, quae sunt tibi praesentia, donec faciant pus: et cadant fila, et consolidentur sifac, et mirach.	When the air has changed the wound: then place above it some unguents, which are for you the presence of these things, until they make pus: and the threads fall out, and solidify the fat, and heal.
Deinde cura illud sicut est curatio reliquorum uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then care for this as for the care of the rest of the wounds, until it heals
Si autem non sunt tibi praesentes medicinae, tunc pone super ipsum statim, exquo incipit emittere pus, cotum uetus: et permuta ipsum bis in die, sicut docui te, donec sanetur.	But if these things are not present among the medicines, then place above it immediately, from which it begins to emit pus, a moist compress: and change it twice a day, as you have been taught, until it heals
Nam tu non indiges medicatione alia in pluribus dispositionibus, quando uulnera sunt simplicia.	For you do not give any other medicine in many situations when the wounds are simple
Si autem times, quod communicet uulnus membris principalibus in laesione, tunc oportet ut submergas lanam lenem in oleo temperatae caliditatis, aut in oleo rosato: et pone ipsam in circumitu locorum quae sunt inter inguina, et sub ascellas.	If however you fear that the wound communicates with the principal parts in the lesion, then it is necessary that you immerse soft wool in lukewarm oil, or in rose oil: and put it around the circumference of the parts which are between the groin and the armpits
Quod si sentit dolorem, aut punctiones, aut putrefactionem in intestinis suis (nam multotiens accidit illud) tunc clisteriza ipsum cum uino stiptico, nigro, tepido: praecipue si putredo iam peruenit in intestino, et facta est exitura penetrans usque ad concauitatem eius.	If he feels pain, or swelling, or putrefaction in his intestines (for this often happens to him), then let him drink a cluster of wine with black vinegar, warm: especially if the putrefaction has already progressed in the intestine, and an opening has been made through to its cavity.
Et scias, quod illud quod est ex intestino grosso, est facilioris sanationis: et quod ex eis est ex subtili, difficilioris sanationis.	And know that that which is from the great intestine is easier to heal: and that which is from the small intestine is more difficult to heal
Intestinum autem quod nominatur Ieiunum, non suscipit sanationem ex uulnere quod accidit in eo omnino: et illud est propter multitudinem eius, quod est ex uenis, et magnitudine earum, et propter subtilitatem corporis eius, et propinquitatem ipsius naturae neruorum.	The large intestine, however, which is called the Ieiunum, does not suffer healing from a wound that has happened to it throughout: and this is because of its multitude, which is from its veins, and the greatness of its size, and because of the subtlety of its body, and because of its proximity to its own nature of nerves.
Si autem illud quod procedit ex uulnere est zirbum, et consequeris ipsum recens: reduc ipsum secundum reductionem tuam, qua reducis intestina aequaliter.	If, however, the wound proceeds from the intestine, and is a hernia, then follow it up accordingly: reduce it according to your reduction of the intestines equally.
Si uero praeteriit ei spacium, et iam factum est uiride, aut nigrum: tunc oportet ut stringas ipsum cum filo supra locum qui denigratus est ex eo, ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	If indeed it has passed beyond that space, and is black, or dark: then it is necessary that you string it with a thread above the place which is degenerated from it, so that the blood does not flow
In zirbo enim sunt uenae et arteriae.	For in the hernia there are veins and arteries.
Deinde incide quod est praeter illud ligamentum, et pone duas extremitates fili pendentes ex inferiori parte uulneris extra ipsum: ut alleuietur super te attractio eius, et extractio ipsius apud casum zirbi, et emissionem pus uulneris.	Then cut through that which is beyond that ligament, and put two hanging threads from the lower part of the wound outside of it: so as to relieve the attraction of that towards the wound, and the evacuation of it at the case of the hernia, and the emission of pus from the wound.
¶ Rememoratio uulneris quod accidit in Intestino.	Remember the wound which has happened in the Intestino.
Quando accidit disruptio in Intestino, et est parua: tunc possibile est, ut restauretur in quibusdam hominibus: propterea, quia ego uidi qui fuit uulneratus in uentre suo cum percussione lanceae, et erat uulnus a dextra stomachi, et antiquatum est uulnus: et factum Fistula, et exiuit ex eo egestio, et uentositas.	When a disruption happens in the Intestino, and it is small: then it is possible, in some people, that it will recover: for I saw that which was wounded in the middle of the stomach with the blow of a lance, and was black: and it had become old: and there was made a fistula, and it went out of itself through egestion, and there was swelling.
Posui ergo curationem, usque quod ego non fui confisus in sanatione eius: neque cessaui subtiliare ipsum, donec sanatus est, et consolidatus est locus.	I remain engaged in treatment until I am relieved from it by the healing of the patient: neither shall I cease until the healing is complete and the locus is firm.
Postquam ego uidi locum iam consolidatum, timui super infirmum, quod accideret super infirmum accidens malum in uentre suo: et non accidit ei ex illo accidens malum.	Once the locus has been solidified, I fear over the patient, for an accident might occur over the patient due to an evil that has happened to him in his body: and it did not happen to him from that evil
Et remansit in melioribus dispositionibus suis, comedens et bibens, et futuens, et intrauit balneum, et exercitatus est in dietis suis.	I remain in better conditions, eating and drinking, hopeful, having bathed, and exercised in my diet.
Et iam dixerunt quidam experimentatorum, quia quando accidit in Intestino uulnus, et est paruum: tunc oportet ut ligetur secundum hunc modum.	And some experimenters have said that when a wound occurs in the intestine and is small: then it is necessary to bind it in this way.
Et est, ut accipias formicas magnorum capitum.	And it is like taking large ants.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, et pone formicam unam ex eis quae habeant os apertum super duo labia uulneris.	Then join together two lips of the wound and put an ant on one of those which have an open socket over two lips of the wound
Cum ergo capit super ea, et stringit os suum, abscinde caput eius, adhaeret enim, et non soluitur.	When thus the head is above them, and they are bound together, cut off its head, attach it to its companion, and do not break it
Deinde pone formicam aliam prope primam, et non cesses facere illud cum formica post formicam secundum quantitatem uulneris totius.	Then put another ant near the first one, and do not cease doing this until the quantity of the wound is complete
Deinde reduc ipsum, et sue uulnus.	Then reduce it, and its wound.
Illa enim capita remanent annexa in Intestino, donec cibetur Intestinum, et sanetur, et non accidat infirmo nocumentum penitus.	These heads remain annexed to the intestine until the intestine is eaten away, healed, and does not cause pain to the patient
Et iam possibile est, ut ligetur Intestinum etiam cum filo subtili: quod abstersum est ex intestino animalis, annexo cum eo postquam intromittitur in acum.	And it is possible to bind the intestine even with a fine thread: which has been taken from an animal's intestine and is attached to it when it is introduced into the belly
Et est, ut accipias extremitatem huius fili ex intestino, et excarnetur multum.	And it is like taking the end of this thread from the intestine and scraping away a lot of it.
Deinde liga in extremitate eius filum lini subtile inuolutum.	Then the ligature at the extremity is made by passing a fine thread under the tissue.
Deinde intromitte illud filum in acum, et sue cum eo intestinum.	Then insert the thread into the knot, and pass it along with the intestines.</start_of_turn>
Deinde reduc ipsum in disruptionem.	Then tighten the knot.</start_of_turn>
Et iste modus suturae cum formicis et intestino, non est nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	And thus is the fashion of stitching with needles and intestines, not without trust and hope.</start_of_turn>
Scias, uulnus quod est magnum, amplum, praecipue si est in uno intestinorum gracilium: tunc non est ingenium nisi subtiliatio, neque est eius sanatio omnino.	You know, a large and wide vessel, especially if it is in a narrow intestine: then there is no skill except meticulous handling, and its healing is not at all.</start_of_turn
¶ De cura Zuchemen, et Fistularum.	Concerning the care of ulcers and fistulas.</start_of_turn
Caput LXXXVIII.	Chapter 88.</start_of_turn>
Scias, quod omne uulnus, aut apostema quando ueterascit et antiquatur, et fit ulcus, et non consolidatur, et emittit pus semper, et non abscinditur: tunc nominatur uniuersaliter in quocunque membro fuerit Fistula, et nos nominamus ipsum Zuchemen.	You know that every vessel, or abscess when it grows old and decays, becomes an ulcer, and does not consolidate, and constantly emits pus, and does not burst: then it is called universally in every member 'fistula', and we call it 'Zuchemen'.</start_of_turn
Et Fistula quidem est secundum ueritatem nodatio filtrata, dura, alba: cum qua non est dolor, cui est concauitas pennae auis: et propter illud nominant eam quidam Risati, id est, pennam.	And a fistula is a kind of filter-node, hard, white: which has no pain, with the consistency of a feather from a bird: and for this reason they call some of them 'Risati', that is, feathers.</start_of_turn
Et est in quibusdam horis humida, quae emittit pus.	And sometimes it is in a moist state, which emits pus.</start_of_turn
Et fortasse scinditur humiditas in quibusdam horis.	And perhaps it bursts with moisture in some hours.</start_of_turn
Et quandoque est haec humiditas multa, et est pauca: et est grossa, et est subtilis.	And sometimes it is in great moisture, and little, and is large, and soft.</start_of_turn
Et ego iam praemisi in diuisione, tunc cum dixi uulnera, quod omne ulcus quod non sanatur, neque nascitur in eo caro, non est illud nisi propter unam nouem caussarum.	And I have already spoken in the explanation, that every ulcer which does not heal, neither is born in this body, is not that except for one of these nine causes.</start_of_turn
Quarum una est, aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore: aut propter maliciam eius: aut quoniam inter ipsum, et super labia eius est caro dura, prohibens natiuitatem carnis: aut quia est multae sordis et sordiciei: aut quoniam ulcus in seipso est putridum, et materia quae mittitur ei est malae qualitatis: aut quoniam medicina est inconueniens in curatione eius: aut quoniam corruptio cadens in regione est genus pestilentiae, aut per proprietatem in regione, sicut accidit in Caesaraugusta: in qua fit difficilis digestio aegritudinum, et tardatur in ea sanatio apostematum per naturam: aut quoniam in eo est os unum, aut numerus ossium.	Why one is of such condition, either because of the scarcity of blood in the body: or because of its malice: or because between the inside and outside of the lips there is a hard substance which hinders the birth of flesh: or because there is much pus and slime: or because a wound in itself is putrid, and the matter which comes out of it is of bad quality: or because the medicine is inappropriate for its treatment: or because a corruption falling in the region is a kind of pestilence: or because of a property of the region itself, as happened in Caesaraugusta, in which there is great difficulty in digesting food and the healing of wounds is delayed by nature: or because in it there is only one bone, or a number of bones.
Et ego iam ostendi omnes istas caussas et signa earum, et curationes ipsarum cum medicinis in diuisione: et oportet hic ut faciam te scire curationem Fistulae et Zuken, quae fit per uiam operationis cum manu.	And I have mentioned all these causes and signs and their treatments with the doctors in debate: it is necessary that you write here the treatment of fistula and swelling, which is done by one operation with the hand.</start_of_turn>
Scias ergo, quod Fistula accidit in omnibus membris corporis.	You know therefore that fistula can occur in all parts of the body.</start_of_turn>
Nam ex eis sunt Fistulae quae perueniunt ad uenas magnas et arterias, aut neruos, aut sifac: aut ad intestinum, aut ad uesicam, aut ad aliquam ex costis: aut ad aliquam ex spondilibus dorsi, aut ad aliquam iuncturarum compositarum compositione: sicut manus, et pedis: et ex eis sunt quae uadunt ad propinquitatem membri principalis, et similium.	For from these things are fistulas which arise to great veins and arteries, or nerves, or intestines, or the bladder, or to some of the ribs: or to some of the vertebrae, or to some compound joint: such as the hand, and the foot. And from these things which approach the principal limb and those which are like them.</start_of_turn
Quae ergo ex his Fistulis est secundum hunc modum, est ex aegritudinibus difficilis sanationis, et non recipit curationem, et occupatio cum ea est labor et ignorantia.	What is therefore with these fistulas in this way, is that they are from difficult diseases which do not receive treatment, and which are accompanied by labor and ignorance.</start_of_turn
Quod si est ex Fistulis aliqua cuius profunditas non peruenit ad haec loca quae dixi: et speras, et confidis in curatione eius, et uis peruenire ad cognitionem illius, tunc accipe tentam ex aere, aut ferro, si Fistula tendit secundum rectitudinem, et perquire eam cum ipsa.	If, however, there is some fistula of which the depth does not reach these places which I have mentioned: and if you hope and trust in the treatment of it, and if you wish to be cured of it, then attempt to take air, or iron, if the fistula tends according to its straight line, and inquire about it with the physician.</start_of_turn
Si autem in Fistula est tortuositas, tunc inuestiga eam cum tenta de plumbo subtili.	If, however, in the fistula there is a twisting, then you must investigate the surrounding parts with a fine lead weight.
Quoniam plumbum cum lenitate sui corporis alleuiatur, et curuatur circa tortuositatem.	Since lead is softened by its own body, and is flexible around the twisting
Quod si Fistula est habens orificia multa, non est tibi possibile ut significes super eam cum tenta.	If there are many holes in the fistula, it is not possible to pass a weight over the surrounding area with a hook
Clisteriza ergo ex eis orificium ex orificiis suis.	Therefore close from these holes to the hole of the fistula.
Nam humiditas qua clisterizas ipsum, uadit uersus orificia alia, et currit ex eis.	For the moisture which closes the fistula comes out through other holes.
Deinde exquisite inquire secundum quem modum est tibi possibile: ut cognoscas quod illic est os, aut neruus, et est Fistulae concauitas longinqua, aut propinqua: aut est Fistula una cui sunt orificia multa, et sta super totum illud, cum summa fortitudinis tuae: cum interrogatione tua, qua interrogas infirmum, et inuentione doloris apud compressionem cum manu tua super locum, et similibus ex significationibus et caussis accidentibus apostemati.	Then inquire carefully in what way it is possible: whether it is bone or nerve, or is the fistula long or short: or is the fistula one which has many holes, and lies upon all of this, with the sum of your strength: with your interrogation of the patient, which questions you ask, and the finding of pain in compression with your hand over the place, and similar signs and symptoms following.
Cum ergo steteris super omnia illa statione uera, tunc uade ad curationem secundum confidentiam: et est, ut consideres tunc, si est Fistula propinqua apparens, aut in loco saluo longinquo a iunctura, aut a neruo, aut arteria, aut uena, aut uno locorum quae dixi tibi: tunc seca Fistulam secundum quod praemissum est ex narratione mea, et aufer quod est in ea ex filtratione, et carnibus corruptis, quod nascitur in orificio eius ex carne, aut thelul, et similibus: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	When you have stood in all these places truly, then go to the treatment according to your confidence: that is, as you consider, if the fistula is close and apparent, or in a safe place distant from the juncture, or from a nerve, or artery, or vein, or one of these places which I mentioned: then dry the fistula according to what is stated above from my narration, and remove what is in it from the filtration, and rotten flesh, which is born in its hole from flesh, or pus, and similar things: and care for it until it is healed
Si autem Fistula est longinquae profunditatis, et est secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut seces eam in profundo quantum est tibi possibile.	If, however, the fistula is of great depth and is according to the rule: then it is necessary to dissect deeply as much as possible.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex omnibus carnibus eius corruptis.	Then expose all its rotten flesh.
Deinde administra licinia inuoluta in medicinis acutis: et intromitte ea usque ad concauitatem Fistulae quam comprehendisti cum ferro: fac cum ea illud aliquotiens, donec corrodat medicina acuta totum quod remansit in concauitate Fistulae ex corruptione.	Then administer the lead that has been bound in medicine for acute cases: and introduce it until you have reached the depth of the fistula that you have perceived with the iron: do this in such a way that the acute medicine may corrode the whole of what remains in the depth of the fistula from the corruption.
Deinde restaura ipsam cum unguentis quae generant carnem sanam, donec sanetur.	Then restore the same with poultices which generate healthy flesh, until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
Si uero non sanatur per illud, tunc cauteriza ipsam secundum quod narrauimus.	If indeed it does not heal by this, then cauterize it according to what we have narrated.</start_of_turn>
Si ergo caussa Fistulae est os, et certificatur apud te illud: tunc inquire ipsum, et seca ipsum secundum quod narraui tibi: si non prohibet te aliquid ex uena, aut neruo, aut membro principali, sicut diximus.	If indeed the cause of the fistula is bone, and you suspect that to be the case: then inquire concerning it, and dry it according to what I have told you: if it does not hinder you anything from the bone, or the nerve, or the principal limb, as we have said.</start_of_turn>
Si ergo detegitur tibi os, et est in eo quiddam corruptionis, et nigredinis: tunc rade ipsum, donec auferatur corruptio eius tota.	If indeed it is detected that there is bone, and there is some corruption and blackness in it: then radiate it, until the corruption of it is entirely removed.</start_of_turn
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with that which nourishes it, until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
Quod si non sanatur, et emittat pus sicut faciebat: tunc scias, quod tu non peruenisti ad totam eradicationem corruptionis.	Which if it does not heal, and discharges pus as it did before: then you know that you have not reached the whole eradication of the corruption.</start_of_turn
Detege ergo super illud secundo, et exquisite fac rasionem eius, et mundificationem ipsius cum ultima fortitudine tua.	Detect therefore above that [the fistula], and inquire concerning its reason, and make a preparation for it with your utmost skill.</start_of_turn
Deinde restaura ipsum.	Then restore it.</start_of_turn
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est: et si non, tunc scias quod illa corruptio est in profunditate longinqua corporis, quam non es consecutus.	If indeed it heals, that is good: and if not, then you know that that corruption is in a profound depth of the body, which you have not been able to overcome.</start_of_turn
Non est ergo tibi in ea ingenium, nisi dimittere ipsam naturae.	It is not indeed in this with cunning, except by sending it back to its natural state.</start_of_turn
Quod si corruptum est os paruum, et est possibile tibi, attrahe ipsum cum forficibus subtilibus quae conueniunt ad illud.	If the small bone is corrupted, and it is possible for you, draw it out with fine forceps which agree with it.
Si autem sunt ossa multa, tunc exquisite fac attractionem eorum omnium, neque dimittas ex eis aliquid cum tua fortitudine.	If there are many bones, then make an exquisite drawing out of them all, and do not leave anything remaining with your forceps
Si uero contrarietatem facit tibi aliquid ex humiditatibus, et non est in incisione eorum timor, uel error: tunc incide illas humiditates et carnes, si sunt illic, et libera ossa.	If, however, there is resistance from moisture in it, and there is no fear of incision, or error: then incisions may be made in those moist parts and the flesh, if there are any, and the bones shall be freed.
Si uero non est tibi praeparatio auferendi ossa ex hora tua, tunc pone super uulnus quod putrefaciat ipsum: et dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat quod est in circumitu illorum ossium ex carnibus et humiditatibus.	If, however, you are not prepared to extract the bone at this time, then place upon it what will putrefy it: and draw it out when it has putrefied, since it is in the neighbourhood of the bones from the flesh and moisture.
Et custodi uulnus ut non consolidetur.	And keep the bandage so that it does not solidify.
Et constringatur sectio quam tu secuisti in operatione tua.	And let the incision be firm as that which you made in your operation
Imo pone super ipsum, si times, cotum submersum sulfure trito cum oleo: aut cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio, aut aliquo unguentorum uiridium.	And put upon it, if necessary, a cushion soaked in powdered sulphur or a cushion soaked in Egyptian unguent or some other unguents of your choice.
Nam quando putrefient illae scilicet humiditates, et separantur ex eis ossa, alleuiatur ablatio eorum, et ipsorum attractio.	For when these moist parts putrefy and are separated from the bones, the discharge will be alleviated and the attraction of the bones will be easier
Si autem est os unum magnum, sicut os cruris, aut os coxae, et similia illis, et quod ex eo corruptum est, est pars magna: tunc rade ipsum rasione ultima, donec auferatur illa nigredo et corruptio.	If, however, there is a large bone, such as the thigh bone or the hip bone, and the like, and which is corrupted: that is a great part. Then draw it out with the utmost care, until the black part and the corruption are gone
Deinde restaura uulnus.	Then restore the bandage.
Si uero quod est in eo corruptum, est pars magna, et corruptio iam consecuta est medullam ossis, tunc necesse est serrare ipsum, et incidere ipsum totum usque ad locum, ubi peruenit corruptio: tunc cura ipsum, donec consolidetur.	If, however, that which is in it is corrupted, is a great part, and the corruption has reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to close it up and cut it through completely until the corruption has ceased: then care for it until it has healed
Et ego narro tibi zuken, quae accidit uiro in crure suo: ut ponas ipsam exemplum et adiutorium super operationem tuam.	And I tell thee concerning the wound which happened in his thigh: that thou mayest take it as an example and an aid for thy operation.
Fuit uir iuuenis aetate circiter triginta annos, cui accidit dolor in crure suo, a caussa quae mota est super ipsum intra corpus, id est, ab interioribus, donec peruenerunt materiae ad crus, et apostematum est apostemate magno: et non fuit ei caussa extrinseca.	A youth of about thirty years of age had pain in his thigh, because something had become displaced within his body, namely from the inside outwards, until it reached the knee, and there remained a large swelling: and there was no external cause for it.
Extensum est ergo cum eo tempus cum errore medicorum, donec apertum est apostema, et concurrerunt cum eo materiae multae.	It remained thus for a long time until the swelling opened, and many materials came out with it
Et postposita est curatio eius, donec fistulatum est crus, et facta sunt in eo orificia multa: quae omnia emittebant pus, et humiditates corporis.	And after that, healing took place, and the limb was bound up, and many holes were made in it: from which pus and moisture of the body were emitted
Curauit ergo ipsum multitudo medicorum circiter duos annos, et non fuit in eo sapiens in arte manus, donec uocatus sum, et uidi crus eius, et materias quae currebant ex illis orificiis cursu magno: etiam omne uiri corpus iam tabuerat, et color eius citrinus erat.	The matter continued for two years with the action of many physicians, and there was no skill in the hand of any man in that art, until I was called, and I saw the limb and the materials coming out of the holes in great numbers: the whole body of the man was stiff, and his colour was pale yellow
Intromisi ergo tentam in uno locorum orificiorum, et peruenit tenta ad os.	I therefore attempted an incision in one of the holes, and the attempt reached the bone.
Deinde perscrutatus sum orificia omnia: et inueni ea peruenire ad se inuicem ex omnibus partibus cruris.	Then I examined all the holes: and I found that they all went deep into the limb from all parts of the thigh
Properaui ergo, et secui super unum illorum orificiorum, donec detexi partem ossis: et inueni ipsum corruptum: quod iam corrosum erat, et denigratum, et putruerat, et perforatum erat, donec penetrauerat usque ad medullam.	I proceeded thus, and I saw above one of the holes, until I reached a piece of bone: and I found that it was corrupted: it was rotten, discoloured, and putrified, and had a hole in it, until it had reached the marrow
Serraui ergo quod detectum est mihi, et praeparatum ex osse corrupto.	I saw that which had been detected by me, and prepared from the corrupted bone.
Et deputaui, quod non esset in osse nisi illa corruptio, quam abscidi, et serraui.	And I judged that there was no other corruption in the bone except that which I had cut away, and I saw that it was sufficient to cut away
Et ego iam eradicaueram eam.	I have eradicated it.
Deinde posui restaurationem uulneris cum medicinis consolidatiuis spacio longo.	Then I establish a restoration of the wound with consolidated spaces over a long period with the physicians.
Et non est consolidatum.	It is not consolidated yet
Deinde tentaui, et detexi super os secundo supra detectionem primam: et inueni corruptionem continuam cum osse: et serraui quod apparuit mihi etiam ex illa corruptione.	Then I tried, and I found on the second day after the first examination: and I found continuous corruption with the bone: and I saw that what appeared to me even from that corruption
Deinde conatus sum restaurationem eius.	I have undertaken to restore it.
Et non est restauratum.	It is not restored yet
Detexi ergo super ipsum iterum, et non cessaui incidere os particulatim, et conari restaurationem eius: et non est restauratum, donec incidi ex osse circiter palmum unum, et extraxi illud cum medulla sua.	I found it again like that, and I did not cease to cut the bone piece by piece, and I tried to restore it: and it is not restored, until I cut from the bone almost the whole palm of the hand, and I extracted that with the marrow
Deinde restauraui ipsum cum medicinis, et consolidatum est uelociter, et sanatum: et non fuit necessaria haec iteratio in operatione eius, et sectione ipsius, nisi propter dispositionem debilitatis infirmi, et paucitatem tolerantiae eius, et timorem meum super ipsum de morte: quoniam accidebat ei in omnibus horis ex superfluitate euacuationis syncopis mala.	Then I restored it with the physicians, and it was consolidated quickly and healed: and no further operation was necessary for that purpose, except for the weakness of the patient and his little tolerance, and my fear of death for him, since it was happening to him in every hour from the excessive evacuation of his syncope.
Sanatus est ergo sanatione integra: et nata est in loco ossis caro dura, et bona facta est dispositio in corpore suo, et rediit uirtus eius: et conuersatus est in dispositionibus suis: et non fecit ei contrarietatem in ambulatione nocumentum omnino.	He is healed completely: and it is made in the place of the hard bone of the jaw, and a good arrangement has been made in his body, and his strength has returned: and he has recovered his composure: and he has not made him any hindrance in walking or sleeping ever since
Si autem os eminens in loco corporis iam fractum est: tunc oportet ut serres ipsum, secundum hunc modum: et est: ut accipias ligamentum, et stringe ipsum in extremitate ossis eminentis: et praecipe alicui, qui extendat ipsum ad sursum: et pone ligamentum aliud ex lana grossius ligamento primo.	If however the prominent bone in the body is fractured: then it is necessary to bind it up as follows: and it is that you take the ligament and bind the bone at its extremity: and command someone to extend it upwards: and put another ligament of greater thickness than the first ligament.
Deinde liga ipsum super carne, quae est suh osse: et extende extremitatem eius, ut trahas carnem ad inferiora: et tu detegis carnem super locum quem uis serrare, ut non laedat Serra carnem.	Then bind the ligament over the meat, which is on the bone: and extend its extremity, so that you pull the meat downwards: and you discover the meat over the place where you want to cut, so that it does not damage the meat
Pone lignum, aut tabulam sub osse inferius decenter: quoniam quando facis illud, non prohibetur quin secet carnem corruptam.	Place wood or a board under the lower bone in the center: because when you do this, it does not prevent the knife from cutting the corrupted flesh.
Et oportet ut sit Serratura super locum corruptum parumper, ut non sit in concauitate ossis corruptio: et non appareat in apparitione sua sensui, et cogat ad Serraturam sui uice alia.	It is also necessary that the suture be placed over the corrupted part rather than in its concavity, so that it does not appear to the sense and cause discomfort.
Quod si os est corruptum, et non est eminens, imo continuatur pars eius cum parte: et corruptio est in medio eius, aut in parte ipsius: tunc detege carnem ab omnibus partibus totam.	If the bone is corrupted and does not protrude, continue the part with the part: and the corruption is in the middle of it, or in the part itself: then remove the flesh from all sides altogether
Deinde pone lignum inferius.	Then place wood below.
Postea serra illud ex parte prima, ubi est corruptio, donec continuetur Serratura ex parte altera: et sit Serratura secundum longitudinem a corruptione parumper, secundum quod diximus.	Then cut that part from the first part where the corruption is, until the suture is continued from the other part: and let the suture be as far from the corruption as possible, as we have said
Quod si corruptio est in iunctura, incide ipsam iuncturam corruptam, et serra os ubi continuatur ex parte altera.	If the corruption is at the junction, cut the corrupted junction itself and cut the bone where the other part continues.
Si uero corruptio est in continuatione duarum iuncturarum, tunc non est in ea ingenium nisi abrasio.	If indeed the corruption is in the continuation of two joints, then there is no sense in it except for abrasion.
Quod si corruptio est in pectine manus, aut in pectine pedis: tunc res in eo est difficilis ualde.	If the corruption is in the palm of the hand, or in the palm of the foot: then things are difficult there
Verum oportet, ut inquiras corruptionem qualiter appareat tibi.	It is true that you must inquire about the nature of the corruption.
Et abradas eam, et mundes ipsam secundum quamcunque dispositionem tibi possibile est, et cum quocunque ingenio rectificatur tibi: quando non facit tibi contrarietatem Vena, aut Neruus.	And scrape away the surrounding area and the surrounding parts as much as you can, and with whatever device is possible: when it does not cause a violation of the vein or the nerve.
Et scias quod incisoria, et Serrae ad incidendum ista ossa sunt multa, secundum situm ossium, et praparationem eorum, et ipsorum grossitudinem, et subtilitatem eorum, et magnitudinem, et paruitatem ipsorum, et duriciem ipsorum, et eorum raritatem.	You know that various saws and knives are suitable for cutting this bone, according to the position of the bones, the preparation of them, their size, fineness, magnitude, and rarity
Quapropter oportet, ut praepares omni speciei operationis instrumentum conueniens ad illam operationem.	Wherever necessary, it is necessary to prepare an instrument appropriate to each type of operation.
Et scias, quod operationes istae significant tibi super speciem instrumenti quo indiges, quando tecum est studium longum.	You know well that these operations are significant to you because of the kind of instrument that is needed for them, when you have studied long enough.
Et cognitio modorum huius artis, testimonium modorum aegritudinum: tunc enim iam inuenies per teipsum illud quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis ad omnem infirmitatem.	And the knowledge of the modes of this art is a testimony to the modes of ailments: for you will then find within yourself that which thing is suitable for them from the instruments for all diseases.
Et ego sum firmans tibi in ultimo huius capituli numerum instrumentorum, quae pones exempla super quae incides, et probationem qua experiaris super alia.	I am confirmed to you in the last part of this chapter concerning the number of instruments, which I have put as examples of those which you will use, and the test which you will experience on others.
Forma Serrae.	Serras' form.
Forma alterius Serrae.	Serras' other form
Forma Serrae alterius.	Serras' third form
Forma Serrae alterius.	Serras' fourth form
Haec forma Serrae depicta, sit decenter facta.	This is the form of the Serras, which is made with the center broken off
Fiat arcus eius superior, acuitas eius ex ferro: et manubrium eius ex buxo, et sit pyramidale decenter factum.	Make its arch from the steel, its point from iron: and its handle from boxwood, and make it pyramid-shaped with the center broken off
Forma Rasorii iuncturarum.	The form of the Rasas which are joined together
Sit caput huius Rasorii, secundum formam capitis claui stellati: et puncta eius sint secundum formam punctorum elischetfegi.	The head of this Rasas is according to the form of the head of the star-shaped key: and its points are according to the form of the holes of the sheath
Et non conuenit, nisi ut fricentur cum eo capita iuncturarum, quando corrumpuntur, aut os amplum, et magnum est.	And it does not fit except when it is hammered with the head of the joined Rasas, when the head is broken, or the bone is broad and large
Forma maioris Rasorii.	The form of the greater Rasas
Forma medii Rasorii.	The form of the middle Rasas
Forma Rasorii lati.	The form of the narrow Rasas
Forma Rasorii in quo est concauitas.	Shape of the wound in which there is a convergence.
Forma Rasorii alterius subtilis.	Shape of the wound in which there is a convergence of parts.
Forma Rasorii alterius curuatae extremitatis.	Shape of the wound in which there is a convergence of the extremities
Forma Rasorii parui, subtilis tentae.	Shape of the wound is small, with fine edges
Forma Rasorii cum quo inciduntur ossa.	Shape of the wound with which bones are involved
Forma etiam Rasorii magni.	Shape also of the wound is great
Hoc similatur Radio, et extremitas est sicut Serra: exhibetur in locis multis ex rasione ossium.	This is like a radius and the extremity is like a saw: it appears in many places because of the reason of bones.
Forma Rasorii quod conuenit ad rasionem eius quod perforatum est ex ossibus.	Shape of the wound which is in accordance with the reason of its perforation from bones
Extremitas eius triangula, acutarum est extremitatum.	The extremity of it is triangular, and the edge of it is acute
Fit ex Indi.	Like that of India
Et similiter oportet, ut fiant omnia quae diximus ex Rasoriis, et Incisoriis, et Serris.	And in the same way it should be, as for wounds and incisions and saws
¶ De incisione extremitatum, et Serratura ossium.	About the incision of the extremities, and the suture of bones.
Caput LXXXIX.	Chapter LXXXIX
Putrefiunt extremitates, aut ex caussa extrinseca, aut intrinseca.	The extremities become putrid, either from an external cause, or an internal cause.
Cum ergo medicatus fueris illam corruptionem curatione medicinarum, et non confert curatio: et uides corruptionem incidere in membrum, quam non repercutit aliquid: tunc oportet ut incidas illud membrum usque ubi consequitu corruptio, ut euadat infirmus per illud a morte, aut a malicia quae est maior defectu membri.	When therefore you have treated the matter with medicines and it does not yield: and you do not fear that there is any recovery: then you must cut away the limb until the corruption has ceased, that the invalid be saved from death, or from the greater mischief of the defect of the limb
Et signum cui accidit illud est, quod denigratur membrum, donec putetur: quod ignis combussit ipsum, aut putrefit post nigredinem: donec inciditur illa putredo usque ad illud quod sequitur illud membrum, et serpit in totum corpus.	And the sign of this is that the limb is blackened, until it is consumed: for fire burns it, or it becomes putrid after turning black: until that putrefaction has ceased throughout the body of the limb, and has spread to the whole body
Propera ergo cum incisione eius, et similiter si caussa corruptionis est a percussione quorundam uenenosorum: sicut scorpionis marini, et uiperae, et rutellae, et similium.	Properly therefore when the incision has been made, and in like manner if the cause of the corruption is a blow to some venomous creatures: such as the scorpion of the sea, and spiders, and beetles, and things of the like.
Si ergo corruptio, aut percussio est in extremitate digiti, tunc incide digitum, et non des spacium corruptioni, ut incedat usque ad reliquam manum.	If therefore the corruption exists either from a blow or from a wound at the extremity of a finger, then cut off the finger, and do not leave space for the corruption, so that it may reach up to the remaining hand
Et similiter si accidit in manu, tunc incide eam ex radice focilis, et non des spacium corruptioni, donec capiat in focili brachii.	And in like manner if it happens in the palm, then cut off the palm from its root, and do not leave space for the corruption, until it has reached the wrist bone
Et si inuadit in eo, tunc incide brachium apud cubitum in iunctura sua.	And if it comes to this, then cut off the arm at the elbow in its joint.
Si autem pertransit corruptio, et uides eum circiter cubitum: tunc in illo est mors infirmi.	If however the corruption passes beyond this and surrounds the elbow: then in this is the death of the limb.
Et administrare praeter illud ex curatione, est quantitas uirtus.	And concerning this, beyond this, is the quantity of the antidote.
Et similiter fac de pede, quando inuadit corruptio in digito, tunc incide ipsum apud unum nodorum: et si capit in pectine pedis, tunc incide pedem totum.	And in like manner do the same concerning the foot, when the corruption comes to the finger, then cut off the finger at one of the joints: and if it comes to the heel bone, then cut off the whole foot
Si autem ascendit ad genu, tunc incide crus apud iuncturam genu.	If however it reaches the knee, then cut off the leg at the knee joint
Quod si corruptio iam peruenit supra genu, tunc non est in ea ingenium, nisi dimissio, et relinquere infirmum morti.	If therefore the corruption has gone beyond the knee, then it is not in this to remain, except for amputation, and to leave the limb dead
Et modus incidendi membrum, aut serrandi ipsum est, ut stringas ligamentum in inferiori, quem uis incidere: et stringe ligamentum aliud supra locum.	And the manner of cutting off the limb, or preserving it, is to tie the ligaments below, which one wishes to cut: and to tie the ligament above in the place.
Et extendat minister ligamentum unum ad inferiora: et extendat minister aliud ligamentum superius ad sursum.	And extend one ligament downwards: and extend the other ligament upwards.
Et tu separa carnem quae est inter duo ligamenta, cum Spatumili lato, donec detegatur caro tota.	And you separate the flesh which is between two ligaments, with a broad spatula, until the whole flesh is detached
Deinde incidatur, aut serretur.	Then it occurs, or returns.
Et oportet, ut ponas ab omnibus partibus pannum lini, et non tangat Serra locum sanum: et accidat infirmo laesio addita, et apostema calidum.	Then it occurs, or returns. It is necessary to put on all parts of the bandage around the limb, and not to touch the healthy area: and the injury should be added to the inflamed area, and the swelling should be made soft.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis interius dum operaris, tunc cauteriza locum uelociter: aut pone super ipsum quosdam pulueres abscindentes sanguinem.	If however blood flow inwards occurs during the operation, then cauterize the place quickly: or put over it some powder which absorbs blood.</start_of_turn>
Deinde redi ad medicationem tuam, donec compleatur.	Then return to your medication until completion.</start_of_turn>
Deinde liga membrum uulneratum cum ligamento conueniente ei, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then bandage the wounded limb with a suitable bandage and care for it, until it heals.</start_of_turn
Et ego narro tibi quod accidit uiro in pede suo, hoc idem accidens quod narro tibi.	And I say to you that this happened to me in my foot, the same thing that I say to you.</start_of_turn>
Quod est, quia accidit in pede suo nigredo, cum adustione quae assimilatur combustioni ignis: et corruptio illa in primis accidit in digito suo, donec coepit pedem totum.	That is, because it happened to me in my foot, with a swelling which assimilates with fire: and the corruption of that happened in the finger first, until the whole foot was affected.</start_of_turn
Properauit ergo uir ex seipso, postquam uidit corruptionem incidere in membro cum uehementia eius, quod inuenit ex dolore, et adustione eius: et incidit ipsum apud iuncturam, et sanatus est.	He therefore escaped from his ailment, after he had cut off the corruption in the limb with its bones, because of the pain and swelling: and it occurred at the joint, and he was healed.</start_of_turn
Et postquam praeteriit ei tempus longum, accidit ei illa eadem corruptio in digito manus suae indice.	And after a long time had passed, the same corruption happened to him in the nail of his middle finger.</start_of_turn
Venit ergo ad me, et conatus sum recuperare illam superfluitatem cum eo quod posui super manum ex medicinis post mundificationem corporis eius: et non repercussa est superfluitas, et coepit incedere in digitum alium: donec coepit coruptio in manum.	He came to me, and I attempted to recover the swelling with that which I had put on the hand from the physicians after the purification of his body: and the swelling did not disappear, but increased in another finger: until the corruption reached the hand.</start_of_turn
Vocauit ergo me, ad incidendum manum eius: et nolui illud, sperans ex me super repercussionem illius superfluitatis: et timui etiam super ipsum apud incisionem manus eius mortem.	He called me to do an incision in his hand: and I did not do it, hoping for the disappearance of the swelling: and I also feared for the life of his hand.</start_of_turn
Quoniam uirtus uiri erat super casum.	Because the patient was strong above the case.
Postquam ergo desperauit de me, reuersus est ad terram suam: et peruenit ad me de eo, quia properauit, et incidit manum suam totam: et sanatus est.	After he had despaired of me, he recovered to his former self: and he came to me from there because he had become strong, and he grasped my hand entirely: and he was healed.
Et non attuli hanc narrationem, nisi ut sit adiutorium super illud quod cadit de genere huius aegritudinis: et ut sit significatio qua significetur, et secundum quam agatur.	I have not included the subsequent sentence as it is not relevant to the translation of the given sentence.
¶ De cura Sinuum, et qualitate clisterizationis cum medicinis.	On the care of joints, and the quality of enemas with doctors.
Caput XC.	Chapter 90.
Quando accidit apostema in quibusdam membris carnosis, et prolongatur spacium apostematis, donec collectionem facit saniei: deinde rumpitur, aut perforatur, et egreditur quod in eo est ex sanie, et remanet locus uacuus quasi sit uas: et cutis quae est super ipsum sicut pannus qui iam subtiliatus est: et non peruenit ad ultimum in corruptione sua, neque imprimit in os, neque in neruum, neque in ligamentum: meretur ut nominetur Sinus: et non nominatur Fistula: uerumtamen si prolongatur spacium eius, donec imprimat corruptio in aliquid horum membrorum, tunc nominatur Fistula, aut zuken.	When swelling occurs in some limb with carbuncles, and the swelling is prolonged until the collection of pus has formed: then it is broken, or pierced, and the pus which is in it is evacuated, and the cavity which is left is like a wound: and the skin which is over it is like a wrinkled cloth: and it does not reach its ultimate corruption, neither does it reach the bone, nor the nerve, nor the ligament: it is called a sinus, and not a fistula, truly; but if the space of the former is prolonged until corruption occurs in some part of the limb, then it is called a fistula, or swelling
Et cura eius est, ut incidas illam cutem totam sicut reuoluitur: et praecipue quando subtiliata est, et facta sicut pannus: et confidis quia non aaehaeret cum loco, propter corruptionem suam.	And its care is that you cut the whole skin as it wrinkles: and especially when it is wrinkled, and made like a cloth: and trust that it does not adhere to the place because of its corruption
Si autem speras quod adhaereat cutis, et non consequitur ex eo corruptio illa ultima consecutione: et si in cute est spissitudo ex carne, tunc cura ipsum cum Clisteri: et est, ut consideres ad Sinum.	If, however, you hope that the skin will adhere, and this does not result in the last consequence: and if there is hardness in the skin from the flesh, then care for it with enemas: and consider it as a sinus
Tunc si est magnus, et pus quod emittitur ex eo est foetidi odoris: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum medicamine aegyptio, quod est aceti, et olei, et ziniar, partes recipiens aequales, aggregentur in uase: et decoquantur super ignem, donec rubeat medicamen: et ueniat in spissitudinem mellis.	Then if it is large, and the pus which comes out of it is foetid of odor: then enematize it with Egyptian medicine, which is vinegar, and oil, and alum, equal parts, gathered in a vessel: and boil them over a fire, until the medicine boils: and bring it to the spissitude of honey.
Deinde accipe ex eo quod tibi necesse est: et dissolue ipsum cum aqua et melle, et clisteriza cum eo Sinum: et stringe orificium eius, et dimitte medicinam in eo ad quantitatem duarum horarum.	Then take from that what is necessary: and dissolve it with water and honey, and instill it with that Sine: and tie up its opening, and send the medicine into it to the quantity of two hours.
Deinde extrahe ipsum cum expressione: fac illud diebus tot, donec mundificetur Sinus, et remoueatur foetor.	Then draw it out with pressure: make it do so for days until the Sinus is healed, and the smell is gone.
Et quandoque clisterizatur cum aqua cineris, quando non est tibi praesens hoc medicamen: et est, ut accipias cinerem lignorum uitis, aut cinerem ex lignis ilicis: et proiicias super eam aquam.	And when it is instilled with water of ashes, when it is not present in this medicine: then take ashes of wood or of the wood of ilex: and sprinkle them over the water.
Deinde cola eam, et clisteriza cum ea, donec confidas quod Sinus iam ablutus est.	Then lie still, and instill with it until you are confident that the Sinus is healed
Quod si infirmo non est tolerantia super medicamen aegyptium, neque aquam cineris, tunc clisteriza ipsum cum aqua et melle, cui iam permixtum est aliquid ex ziniar contrito.	If the patient does not tolerate the Egyptian medicine, neither the water of ashes, then instill it with water and honey, to which something of ground cinnamon has been added
Aut clisteriza ipsum cum melle et uino permixtis, quoniam de proprietate mellis est, ut mundificet, et abluat: et uinum facit adhaerere Sinum, praecipue quando in uino est superfluitas stipticitatis et siccitatis.	Or instill it with honey and wine mixed together, because of the property of honey to heal and soften: and the wine makes the Sinus adhere, especially when there is excess of styptic and drying in it
Cum facis illud aliquotiens, et confidis quod Sinus corruptio iam remota est: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum eo quod facit nasci carnem in eo.	When you have done this a little while, and are confident that the corruption of the Sinus has passed away: then instill it with that which makes new flesh in it.
Et est, ut accipias ex emplastro dyafinicon: et dissoluas ipsum cum oleo rosato, et uino stiptico: aut clisteriza ipsum cum quibusdam medicinis, et unguentis aliis, quorum proprietates scripsi in tractatu unguentorum.	And it is necessary to take from the plaster of diaphthor: and dissolve it with rose oil and wine: or instill it with some medicine, and anoint with others, of which the properties are written in the treatise on unguents
Quod si orificium Sinus est strictum, in quo non capit cannula clisteris: tunc amplifica ipsum cum ferro parumper: aut pone in ipso licinium inuolutum in unguento aegyptio, aut in unguento basilicon, donec amplificetur.	If the opening of the Sinus is narrow, in which the cannula of the instiller will not pass: then widen it with iron needle: or put in the basin a little sponge soaked in Egyptian unguent, or in aloes, until it is widened
Et similiter si est orificium etiam amplum, tunc aggrega labia eius cum sutura: et dimitte ex eo quantitatem in quam ingrediatur clistere sine additione.	And similarly, if the orifice is also large, then gather its lips together with a suture: and discharge from it the quantity that enters the bladder without addition.
Et similiter si orificium eius ex quo currit pus, est eleuatum ad superiora: tunc seca ipsum in depressiori loco qui est in ipso, ut currat ex eo pus usque inferius: quoniam pus quando coartatur in profunditate Sinus, prohibet carnem generari in eo.	And similarly, if pus runs from this orifice, it is elevated to the upper parts: then dry it in the lower part which is in the same place, so that it runs from there downwards: for pus, when it is concentrated in depth, prevents meat from generating in it.
Quod si non est tibi possibile secare Sinum circiter inferius eius secundum quod uis: tunc conare, ut praepares membrum praeparatione qua currat ex eo pus cum facilitate secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	And if it is not possible to dry the sinus nearby downwards, then attempt to prepare the limb with the preparation which runs from there with ease according to what is prepared
Conare, ut non retineatur in eo aliquid ex pus omnino: et accipe medicinas consolidatiuas quae ponuntur super signum, conuenientes ad illud quod uis.	Attempt to retain nothing of the pus at all in it: and take solidifying medicines which are placed above the sign, suitable for this purpose
Et extende eas super pannum lini.	And extend them over the wound line.
Et sit pannus tantae quantitatis, qua fiat communicatio totius Sinus.	And let the size of the wound be such that it communicates all the sinus.
Deinde incide cum forficibus in directo orificii Sinus foramen, amplius orificio Sinus parumper.	Then pierce directly through the opening of the sinus with forceps, making the opening of the sinus greater.
Deinde extende ex unguentis lenibus super pannum alium, secundum quantitatem foraminis: et pone eum super ipsum positione longinqua ab orificio Sinus, ut alleuietur exitus pus ex eo: et non auferas pannum magnum, nisi post dies aliquos uice una.	Then extend from the loops of intestines over the other wound, according to the quantity of the opening: and place it above itself in a distant position from the opening of the sinus, so as to alleviate the discharge of pus from there: and do not increase the size of the wound, except after a few days or so when one has healed one
Ille autem qui est super orificium Sinus, est ille quem remoues in omni hora, ut egrediatur quod aggregatur in eo ex pus: et ut scias, an illud quod currit ex eo uirus, est multum, aut parum: aut digestum, aut indigestum.	And whoever is above the opening of the sinus, moves in every hour, so that it may go out what is gathered in it from the pus: and you know whether it runs from there more or less, or digested or undigested.
Et cum hoc iterum considera locum Sinus ipsius, an in ipso sentiat dominus eius dolorem, aut non sit in eo dolor, et an sit in eo apostema, aut non sit in eo apostema.	And when you have done this again, consider the place of the sinus itself, whether it feels pain in its master or not, and whether there is pain in it or not, and whether there is swelling in it or not.
Cum ergo protenditur medicatio tua taliter, et uides materiam quae egreditur super orificium Sinus, tunc scias, quod Sinus iam adhaeret, aut approximat adhaerentiae: tunc ergo solue ipsum in mane, aut in tertio die: et quando soluis uulnus, tunc permuta pannum alium, et renoua unguentum.	When the remedy has been applied in this way, and you see that the material which comes out through the opening of the Sinus has ceased, then you know that the Sinus has adhered, or is approaching adhesion: then you must remove it in the morning, or on the third day. And when you have removed the ulcer, then change the bandage and renew the unguentum.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post spacium longum uirus subtile, tunc non desperes de adhaerentia eius, nam sanatio eius appropinquat, quoniam ex hominibus sunt qui tardant generationem carnis in uulneribus suis, et ex eis sunt qui agunt econtrario illius.	If, however, after a long space of time the ulcer has gone down somewhat, you do not despair of adhesion, for healing approaches, since there are men who are slow to generate flesh in their ulcers, and there are those who act contrariwise to this.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post dies multos pus indigestum, tunc scias quod sinus non adhaeret.	If, however, after many days a thick, undigested pus comes out of the Sinus, then you know that the Sinus is not adhered
Si ergo tardatur adhaerentia Sinus, et prolongatur res eius: tunc adde in exiccatione medicinarum, uerum faciant medici, ut sint medicinae in substantia sua humidae, et in uirtute sua siccae: sicut unguentum dyafinicon, quando additur in eo superfluitas additionis ex zegi.	If the adhesion of the Sinus is delayed and its condition is prolonged: then add in the treatment of the physicians, indeed let the physicians make use of both wet and dry substances: like unguentum dyafinicon, when added in this way it becomes excessive
Et ex magis ultimo quo curatur, est, ut accipias unguentum dyafinicon, et soluatur cum oleo rosato, et roretur super ipsum uinum antiquum aequale in substantia sua.	And from the last of all, when you have cured it, take unguentum dyafinicon and dissolve it with rosewater, and apply it over the old wound equal in quantity to the substance itself.
Deinde confice ipsum cum eo, et utere ipso.	Then bind it up with it, and use it as before.
Et iam facit simile huic actioni, quando non est tibi praesens unguentum dyafinicon, mel, quando decoquis ipsum, donec ingrossetur, et uteris eo.	And it does the same thing in this way, when it is not present, honey, when you dissolve it, until it has become absorbed, and you use it again.
Aut accipe myrrham, et aloen, et olibanum: tere totum, et pulueriza illud super mel dum est super ignem.	Or take myrrh, aloes, and olibanum: mix them all together, and grind this up over honey when it is over the fire.
Deinde line super ipsum pannum, et stringe ipsum super Sinum: et line cum melle quod decoquisti, donec ingrossatum est: et pulueriza super ipsum species, et pone super ipsum pannum, et stringe eum.	Then spread over the bandage, and bind it over the Sinus: and spread with the honey which you have boiled until it has become absorbed: and sprinkle over it the ingredients, and place over the bandage, and bind it.
Et quandoque administratur in illo aristolochia longa, et radices lilii coelestis, et est lilium: et farina herbi, et centaurea.	When such long aristolochia, lily roots of heaven, lily, barley of herbs, and centaurea are administered together,
Utere eis simplicibus, aut aggregatis, tere ea, et cribella ipsa: et pulueriza super mel quod narraui, et utere eo.	When such long aristolochia, heaven-born lily roots, lilies, barley of herbs, and centaurea are administered together, use them either simple or in combination with beeswax. Powder them over honey as I have said before, and use that.
Quod si prolongatur res Sinus, et non sanatur hac curatione: tunc scias, quod in profundo eius est corruptio: aut iam facit impressionem in ossibus, aut in reliquis membris duris, aut ligamentis: tunc cura ipsum curatione Fistularum, secundum quod praemissum est.	When such long aristolochia, heaven-born lily roots, lilies, barley of herbs, and centaurea are administered together, and the condition does not improve, you know that there is corruption in its depth: or that it makes an impression on the bones, or in other hard parts, or ligaments. Then treat the fistula according to what has been said before
¶ De cura Panaritii et unguis attritae, et incisione digiti additi, et sectione.	As for the treatment of panaritius and nail extraction, and the incision of the digit added, and the section.
Caput XCI.	Chapter 101.
Panaritium est apostema quod nascitur sub ungue pollicis manus, aut pedis: et fortasse nascitur in reliquis digitis.	Panaritius is a swelling that arises under the nail of the thumb or finger, or perhaps in other digits.
Cum ergo prolongatur res eius, et negligitur curato eius, et apostematur apostemate calido: aut corrumpitur, et emittit pus, donec corrodit radicem unguis: et fortasse corrumpit eam totam, et fortasse peruenit corruptio ad os, donec est ei odor foetidus: et fit extremitas digiti lata, et fit color eius fuscus.	When such a thing prolongates, and neglects its cure, and becomes an abscess, it bursts, and emits pus, until it has rotted the root of the nail: and perhaps it has rotted the whole thing, and perhaps the corruption has reached the bone, whereupon there is a foul odor: and the digit becomes swollen, and its color becomes dark
Quando ergo tu curas ipsum, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut incidas cum ferro totam superfluitatem quae remansit ex ungue.	When you are treating this, as we said before, and the cure does not take hold: then it is necessary to cut away the whole superabundance that remains from the nail with a knife
Deinde cauteriza uulnus post illud.	Then cauterize the nail afterwards
Cauterium enim iuuatiuum est ualde.	The cautery is good for ivory
Si uero os est sanum, et est unguis etiam sana, et additiones uacuae unguis iam comprimunt carnem ad interiora, et incipiunt pungere ipsam, et laedunt eam: tunc oportet ut ponas Radium subtilem sub angulo unguis quae pungit carnem, et impelle eam sursum: et incide eam carnem cum facilitate, et pone super illud quod remanet de carne ex medicinis comburentibus, corrosiuis, donec remoueatur totum eius.	If indeed the bone is sound, and the nail is also sound, and the addition of the nail now presses meat inwards, and begins to pierce itself, and causes pain: then it is necessary to place a fine radium under the angle of the nail that is piercing the meat, and press it upwards: and cut away the meat easily, and put over that which remains of the meat from the doctors' burns, corrosives, until it is all gone
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it heals.
Si autem corruptio iam imprimit in os, tunc oportet ut incidas illud os, et extrahas ipsum: non enim sanatur unquam dum permanet in eo os corruptum.	If, however, corruption has set in the bone, then it is necessary to cut away the bone and extract it: for it will not heal as long as it remains in that corrupted state.
Quod si uides corrosionem et corruptionem incedere in digitum, tunc incide eum in uno nodorum, secundum quod praemissa est eius rememoratio.	If you see corrosion and corruption spreading in a finger, then cut it at one of its joints, as is appropriate according to its sensation.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it heals.
Si autem accidat ungui attritio, aut percussio: et contingit in ea dolor uehemens, tunc oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	If, however, there is attrition or percussion of the nail, and if there is pain in that area, then it is necessary to bleed the diseased part at first.
Deinde seca unguem cum Spatumili acuto sectione transuersa de sursum ad uisum.	Then dry the nail with sharp spatula from above downwards to the end.
Et custodi, ne sectio perueniat ad carnem quae est sub ungue, nam tu facies accidere per illud super infirmum dolorem uehementem, et erit caussa ad natiuitatem carnis additae in loco.	And take care, lest the cutting should penetrate to the flesh beneath the nail, for this would cause additional pain and swelling in that place.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod sedat dolores.	Then care for the place with that which rests upon pain.
Digitus uero additus qui nascitur in quibusdam manibus hominum, fortasse est carnosus totus: et fortasse sunt in quibusdam eorum ossa, et fortasse est in eo unguis: et quidam eorum nascitur in radice iuncturae, aut est natiuitas eius in quibusdam nodis digiti.	A finger that is born in the hands of men is sometimes entirely fleshy: and sometimes there is in some of them a bone, and sometimes there is in it a nail: and some of them are born at the junction of the joint, or is the natural result of some node of the finger
Ille ergo qui nascitur in quibusdam nodis digiti, non mouetur: et ille qui nascitur apud iuncturam digiti, fortasse mouetur.	He who is born in some node of the finger does not move: and he who is born at the junction of the finger may perhaps move
Eius ergo qui ex eis est carnosus, sectio eius facilis est.	He who is born of flesh is easily cut
Quod est, ut incidas ipsum apud radicem suam cum Spatumili lato.	As you would cut it at its root with a broad spatula
Eius autem cuius natiuitas est in radice iuncturae curatio, est difficilis.	As for that one whose birth is in the junction of the joint, the care of it is difficult
Abstine ergo ab incisione eius.	Abstain from that incision.
In illo uero qui nascitur in digito apud ultimum nodorum, tunc oportet ut incidas in primis carnem eius incisione rotunda usque ad os.	Then it is necessary that you make a round incision at the end of the digit, where it joins the last knuckle.
Deinde serra os cum una illarum Serrarum conuenientium ad illud.	Close the bone with one or two sutures that meet at that point.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Care for it until it heals.
Consolidatio autem quae accidit digitis adinuicem, multotiens accidit aut ex natiuitate hominis, id est, nascitur cum eo, aut a consolidatione uulneris, aut combustione ignis, et similibus.	Consolidation, however, which happens to the finger after injury, often happens either from the natural condition of man, that is, because of it, or from the consolidation of the wound, or from the burning of fire, and the like.
Oportet ergo ut seces illam consolidationem, donec redeant digiti secundum formam suam naturalem.	Therefore you must remove this consolidation until the finger returns to its natural shape
Deinde pone inter eos licinia, aut pannos infusos in oleo rosato: ut non consolidentur uelociter, et separa inter eos: aut pone inter eos laminam plumbi subtilem, donec consolidetur locus secundum quod oportet.	Then place between the bones some sponges or soaked rags in wet lead: so that they do not consolidate too quickly, and separate the bones: or place between the bones a thin sheet of lead, until the place has consolidated as it should
Et similiter si accidat consolidatio quibusdam digitis cum palma, tunc seca illam consolidationem, secundum quod praeparatur et conuenit figurae membri.	And in like manner if any consolidation happens to a finger with the palm, then dry out that consolidation, as it is prepared and convenient for the figure of the limb.
¶ De incisione Vitium.	¶ Of the Incision of the Palm.
Caput XCII.	Chapter XCII.
Uites sunt Venae inuolutae, grossae, plenae superfluitatibus melancholicis quae accidunt in pluribus membris corporis: et plurimum euentus earum est in cruribus, praecipue in cruribus iter agentium et laborantium, et portantium.	There are five veins which are involved, large and full of melancholy humours which happen in various members of the body: and most of them happen in the thighs, especially in the thighs of those who are in motion and working, and in those who are carrying burdens.
Oportet ergo ut administres excussionem corporis ex cholera nigra aliquotiens excussione forti.	Therefore you must manage the discharge of the black bile somewhat by vomiting.
Deinde phlebotoma patientis eas basilicam.	Then take blood from the patient easily with a lancet
Curatio uero earum cum ferro, est secundum duos modos.	The treatment of these things with iron is in two ways
Vnus eorum est, ut secentur, et extrahatur sanguis niger.	One must cut, and blood black is extracted.
Et modus alter est, ut eleuetur Vena, et extrahatur tota.	Or, one must elevate the vein, and all blood is extracted.
Sectio uero eius est secundum hunc modum.	The incision is made in this manner.
Embroca crus in primis cum aqua calida multum, donec resoluatur sanguis grossus faeculentus.	The limb is plunged into warm water at first, until the thick blood has dissolved
Deinde stringe crus infirmi a superiori parte coxae eius, usque ad inferiorem partem genu cum uitta.	Then the limb of the sick is bound from the upper part of the thigh to the lower part of the knee with a bandage
Deinde seca uenam in loco uno, aut duobus, aut tribus sectione ampla.	Then the vein is cut in one place, or two, or three wide sections
Deinde eleua, id est, extrahe sanguinem in manu tua ab inferiori parte cruris, usque ad sursum, et a superiori oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	And then elevate, that is, extract blood from the lower part of the leg up to the upper part, and from the upper part carry it away like a phlebotomist does to the sick at first
Deinde seca unguem cum usque inferius: donec egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uides sufficere, et quam tolerat uirtus infirmi.	Then cut the vein until blood comes out of the quantity needed for the treatment of the patient, and as much as the patient can tolerate
Postea liga eam: et praecipe ei, ut abstineat a cibis generantibus choleram nigram: et itera euacuationem et phlebotomiam, quando implentur Venae, et nocet illud infirmo.	Then bind the vein: and order that he abstain from foods generating black bile: and repeat the evacuation and phlebotomy when the veins have become engorged, and this is beneficial for the patient.
Eleuatio autem eius est secundum hunc modum.	The elevation is made in this manner
Rade crus infirmi, si in ea sunt pili multi.	If there are many hairs on the limb of the sick, remove them
Deinde intromitte ipsum in balneum: aut embroca ipsum in crure eius cum aqua calida, donec rubeat, et exuberentur Venae: aut exercitetur exercitio forti, si non est ei praesens balneum, donec calefiat membrum.	Then immerse the limb in a bath: or bind it in the limb with warm water, until the vein becomes red, and swell: or exercise strongly, if there is no bath available, until the limb becomes warm
Deinde seca cutem in directo uenae sectione per longitudinem: aut in ultimo eius apud genu, aut in inferiori parte eius apud calcaneum.	Then cut the skin in a straight line over the vein section: or at the end of it near the knee, or at the lower part of it near the heel.
Deinde aperi cutem cum uncinis, et excoria uenam ab omni parte, donec appareat sensui: et est apud apparitionem eius, quod uides eam rubeam ad nigredinem decliuem.	Then open the skin with hooks, and scrape the wound from every side until sensation returns: and it is known when its sensation returns that the wound has been reddened to black.
Cum ergo uadit ex cute, uides eam albam quasi sit chorda.	When the wound comes out of the skin, you know that the wound has become like a cord of white.
Deinde intromitte sub ea Radium, donec quando eleuatur et egreditur de cute: suspende eam cum uncino caeco, leni.	Then introduce under these [the teeth of the hook] radium, until it comes out of the skin: suspend it with a thread like a needle and thread
Deinde seca sectionem aliam prope illam sectionem tribus digitis.	Then dry the other part near the section three digits away.
Deinde excoria cutem a superiori parte uenae, donec appareat.	Then scrape the skin from the upper part of the wound until sensation returns
Deinde eleua eam cum Radiis sicut fecisti, et suspende eam cum uncino alio, sicut fecisti in primis.	Then elevate the wound with the radium as you did before, and suspend it with another thread as you did before.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam, aut sectiones plures, si indiges illo.	Then dry the other part, or several parts, if you do not digest them.
Deinde eleua, et incide ipsam ultima sectione apud calcaneum.	Then elevate it, and close the last part at the heel
Deinde extrahe eam ad sectionem quae est supra eam.	Then remove the thread from the section that is above the wound
Et fac illud, donec extrahas eam ex sectione quae est superior, uel altior sectionibus omnibus, donec quando egreditur tota: tunc incide eam.	And do this until you have removed the thread from the superior section, or from all the sections, until when they have all come out: then close the wound.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad extrahendum, et eleuandum: tunc intromitte acum cum filo forti duplo, et liga eam, et extrahe ipsam: aut intromitte sub ea Radium: et reuolue manum tuam ad omnem partem, donec egrediatur.	But if it does not obey you for extracting and elevating: then introduce a needle with a strong thread, and ligate the wound, and extract it: or introduce radium under these [the teeth of the hook] and turn your hand to all parts until it comes out.
Et caue, ne incidatur.	And be cautious, lest you perforate it.
Nam si incidatur, fit difficile tibi eleuare eam ualde, et ingreditur super infirmum ex ea nocumentum.	For if you perforate it, it becomes difficult for you to elevate the wound afterwards, and infection enters through that wound.
Cum ergo extraxeris eam totam: tunc pone super locum uulnerum lanam submersam in uino et oleo rosato, aut oleo: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	When you have drawn out the whole thing: then put upon the place of the wound a lancet submerged in wine and rose oil, or oil alone: and care for it until it is healed.
Quod si Vitis est contracta, habens tortuositatem cui sit inuolutio ad partes, et non est sicut diximus secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut findas super eam ad omnem partem tortuositatis eius, et loca inuolutionis ipsius.	If the vein is contracted, having twists to which its course is subject, and is not as we have said according to the rule: then it is necessary to find upon the whole of it all the parts of its twists, and the place of its twist.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncinis, donec eleues eam totam: et caue apud sectionem tuam super eam ne incidas uenam, aut uulneres: nam difficile fiet super te eleuare, uel extrahere eam.	Then suspend the vein with hooks, until you have drawn out the whole thing: and be careful at the place of your incision above the vein that you do not cut the vein, or wound it: for it is difficult to elevate or extract the vein.
Conserua ergo prudentiam tuam.	Be prudent in this matter.
Forma Incidentis quo sanatur Vitis.	The form of the wound which heals the vein.
Forma Vncini caeci.	The form of the surrounding area of the wound
Non est ei curuitas sicut reliquis Vncinis, neque est acutae extremitatis, ut non uulneret uenam: et est grossae flectuositatis, lenis: quoniam si esset subtilis, incideret uenam subtilitate sua: imo sit ei superflua grossitudo, sicut diximus.	It is not acute at the extremities, like the rest of wounds, nor is it rough, as to wound the vein: it is rather of a moderate degree of flexibility, gentle: for if it were slight, it would not hold the vein by its thinness; and if it were too great, it would be excessive
De extractione Venae cruris.	On the extraction of the great vein of the leg.
Caput XCIII.	Chapter XCIII.
Haec Vena generatur in cruribus in terris calidis, sicut Alizegi, et terra Arabum, et in terris aridis, calidis, paucae teneritatis, id est, in quibus non nascitur herba, neque arbor.	This vein is generated in the thighs in warm lands, like Alizegi, and the land of Arabs, and in dry, warm lands, few in number, that is, in which no herb or tree is born
Et fortasse generatur in locis aliis corporis praeter crura.	And perhaps it is also generated in other parts of the body besides the thighs
Et generatio quidem eius est a putrefactione quae accidit sub cute, sicut accidunt intra corpora serpentes et uermes ascarides, et uermes generati inter cutem et carnem.	And its generation is also from the putrefaction that happens under the skin, like that which occurs within the bodies of serpents and ascarid worms, and the worms that are generated between the skin and the flesh.
Et signum incaeptionis euentus huius Venae est, quod accidit in crure inflammatio uehemens.	The sign of the commencement of this event concerning this vein is that it happens in a swollen foot.
Deinde uesicatur locus.	Then the area swells up.
Deinde incipit Vena exire ex loco illius uesicationis, quasi sit radix plantae, aut animal.	Then the vein comes out from the place of that swelling, like the root of a plant, or an animal
Cum ergo apparet ex ea extremitas eius, tunc oportet ut inuoluas super ipsam frustum plumbi, cuius pondus sit ex drachma keil, usque ad drachmas II et noda ipsam: et dimitte plumbum suspensum ex crure.	When it appears from that extremity, then it is necessary to bind over the foot itself, whose weight is from a drachma and a half, up to two drachmas and a node: and let go of the suspended blood from the foot
Quotiens ergo egreditur ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, inuolue illud in plumbo, et noda illud.	Whenever anything comes out from that, bind it over with lead and node it.
Quod si prolongatur multum, tunc incide partem eius, et inuolue residuum.	If this persists for a long time, then cut off part of it, and bind over the remainder.
Et non incidas eam radicitus antequam egrediatur tota.	Do not cut through the root until all has gone out
Quoniam si incidis, contrahitur, et ingreditur in carnem: et facit accidere apostema, et putredinem in loco, et ulcus malum.	For if you cut through it, it contracts, and enters the flesh: and makes it swell, putrefy in the place, and make a bad ulcer
Quapropter oportet, ut suauiter tractetur, et extrahatur paulatim, donec egrediatur ex ultimo sui, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid in corpore: et ex hac quidem Vena egreditur in quibusdam hominibus quod est in longitudine sua quinque palmorum et decem.	Therefore it is necessary to handle it gently, and take it out gradually, until all of it has gone out of the body: and from this vein comes out in some people which is as long as five palms and ten fingers.
Et iam peruenit ad me, quia exiuit uiro ex XX palmis.	And indeed it has come to me, because the urine has gone out of twenty palms.
Si autem inciditur tibi in hora medicationis tuae: tunc intromitte radium in foramine eius, et perfora eam foramine longo, cum corpore, donec euacuetur totum quod est in ea ex materia: et administra putrefactionem loci cum medicinis diebus aliquot.	If however it happens to you at the hour of your medication: then introduce the radium into the cavity of it, and perforate the cavity with a long needle, as with the body, until all that is in it is evacuated: and administer the putrefaction of the place with the doctors for a few days.
Deinde cura ipsum curatione apostematum.	Then care for the wound
Et haec quidem Vena quandoque habet ramos multos, praecipue quando apparet in iunctura pedis, aut in pede ipso: et accidunt ei orificia multa, et egreditur ex omni orificio ramus.	When the vein has many branches, especially when it is found in the junction of the foot or in the foot itself, many holes/orifices appear on it, and the branches emerge from every hole.
Cura ergo ipsam, sicut diximus in diuisione, et cum eo quod praemissum est.	Care must be taken of it in this way, as we said previously, and as is proper for it.
¶ De sectione super Vermes generatos sub cute, et dicitur Aegritudo bouina.	As for the cutting of the great veins which are generated under the skin, and which is called the bovine disease.
Caput XCIIII.	Chapter XCIV.
Haec Aegritudo nominatur in quadam terra apud nos Aegritudo bouina: propterea, quia multotiens accidit bouibus, et est uermis paruus unus, qui nascitur inter cutem et carnem.	This disease is called in this land Bovine Disease, because it frequently occurs in cows, and is a small worm which is born between the skin and the flesh.
Et uadit in corpore toto, ascendendo et descendendo: et ostenditur sensui apud ambulationem eius de membro ad membrum, donec disrumpit ubicumque disrumpit in cute locum, et egreditur.	It runs throughout the body, ascending and descending: and is perceived by the sense when it walks from limb to limb, until it ruptures wherever it ruptures in the skin at the place where it has burst out, and emerges
Et generatio eius est ex putredine quorundam humorum.	Its generation is from the decay of some humors
Sicut accidunt uermes et serpentes, id est, lumbrici, et ascarides in uentre.	Like worms and serpents, that is to say, lice and roundworms in the belly
Et timetur ex malicia eius.	And they are fearful of its malice.
Quia quando ipse uadit in corpore, et eleuatur ad caput, et peruenit ad locum: tunc fortasse aperit in eo, et egreditur, et destruit oculum: et accidit illud multotiens.	Because when it itself runs in the body, and rises to the head, and comes to the place: then perhaps it bursts there and comes out, and destroys the eye: and this frequently happens.
Cum ergo uis curare eum, et extrahere ipsum, tunc non fit illud nisi apud ambulationem eius, et apparitionem ipsius sensui.	When care is taken of it, and it is extracted, then it does not happen except when it is walking and the sensation of it is perceived
Oportet ergo, ut stringas quod est supra eum, et quod est sub eo cum ligamento constrictione forti.	It is necessary therefore to bind that which is above it and that which is under it with strong ligature
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then dry over it, and extract it
Quod si profundatur in carne, et non inuenis ipsum: tunc pone super locum cauterium cum igne, donec moriatur.	If it is deeply embedded in flesh and you do not find it: then place above it a cautery with fire until it dies.
Et maius quod timetur, est corruptio eius, qua corrumpit oculum, sicut diximus.	The greater thing to fear is its corruption, which corrupts the eye, as we have said.</start_of_turn>
Si autem uides eum iam peruenisse in capite prope oculum, tunc stringe sub eo supercilium strictura bona.	If however you see that it has penetrated as far as the head near the eye, then tighten under it the eyebrow a good fold.</start_of_turn>
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then dry over it, and draw it out.</start_of_turn
Et oportet ut utatur infirmus mundificatione sui corporis, cum medicinis soluentibus humores putridos malos.	And it is necessary that the patient should use the salves of his body, with physicians who dissolve the bad humors.</start_of_turn>
Et caueat sibi a cibis generantibus putrefactionem.	And beware of foods that generate putrefaction.</start_of_turn
¶ De sectione super aegritudinem Nakir.	Regarding the incision above the navel Nakir.</start_of_turn
Caput XCV.	Chapter XCIV.</start_of_turn>
Haec aegritudo nominatur in terra nostra Nakir: et est dolor qui accidit in quibusdam membris: deinde permutatur de membro ad membrum.	This pain is called in our land Nakir: and it is a pain which happens in some limb: then it changes from limb to limb.</start_of_turn
Et ego quidem iam uidi ipsum, secundum quod narro tibi.	And I myself have seen it, as I have told you.</start_of_turn
Vocatus sum ad mulierem infirmam in quibusdam uillis.	I was called to a woman who was sick in some village.</start_of_turn
Et detexit brachium suum, et uidi inflationem paruam in uena funis brachii.	And I found her arm swollen, and I saw inflation of the vein of the arm.</start_of_turn
Et postquam remansi hora una, uidi unam inflationem incedere cum focili, sicut incedit uermis, ascendendo ad humerum eius uelocius quam esse potest: ut sit sicut argentum uiuum, quando currit de loco ad locum.	And after an hour had passed, I saw another swelling increase with a worm, as it were running, ascending to his shoulder more quickly than is possible: as if it were silver that was running from place to place.</start_of_turn
Recessit ergo dolor ex illo loco, et fixus est in humero.	The pain subsided from that place and was fixed in the shoulder.</start_of_turn
Deinde sedi hora una, et cucurrit in reliquum corpus, donec perueniret in brachium aliud.	Then one hour passes, and it runs through the remainder of the body until it reaches the other arm.
Deinde narrauit mihi, quia reuoluebatur in toto corpore suo, secundum quod uidi.	Then he said to me, "It revolves throughout the whole of its body, as I see.
Miratus sum ergo de uelocitate permutationis eius de membro ad membrum.	I marvel at the swiftness of its movement from limb to limb
Et ego quidem ante illud non uideram hanc aegritudinem oculis meis taliter secundum hunc modum.	And I myself did not believe my eyes when I saw it like this before
Verumtamen uidi multos, qui inueniunt dolorem permutari de membro ad membrum: et non uidi ipsum oculis, sicut uidi eum in muliere.	But I have seen many who have found that the pain changes from limb to limb: and I have not seen it with my eyes, as I have seen it in women.
Et ego non cogito illud esse, nisi quod est propterea, quod mulier fuit ex illis qui sunt ex uillis sicci corporis detectarum uenarum: hinc ergo apparet sensui illa uentositas permutata.	I do not believe this, except that it is because of the great swelling of the veins caused by the disease in the lower parts of the body: from this therefore appears to me a change in sensation from the lower parts to the upper parts
Et est necesse, ut non appareant secundum hanc rationem in illis qui sunt deliciosi, et corporibus humidis, occultarum uenarum.	It is necessary that they do not appear in those who are delicate and in whom the veins are hidden by moisture.
Cum ergo uis curationem eius, et sentit patiens illud dolorem: tunc si est apparens tibi oculo, sicut diximus, tunc stringe supra ipsum, et sub ipso uelociter: et seca supra ipsum, donec egrediatur illa uentositas coartata: et cauteriza locum.	When therefore he has received his cure and the patient feels this pain: then if it appears to you in the eye, as we have said, grasp above and below the place more quickly: and dry above the place, until the coarseness has gone away: and cauterize the place
Si autem non uides ipsum oculis tuis: tunc cura ipsum cum excussione corporis, et cum eo quod expellit uentositates, et carminat eas cum pillulis foetidis, et pillulis de serapino, et similibus.	If you do not see it with your eyes: then cure it with the excuse of the body, and with that which drives out the swellings, and carmine them with drugs like sulfurous pills and saffron pills, and the like.
¶ De extractione Sagittarum.	(The provided text does not include information regarding the extraction of Sagittarum, so I cannot translate this sentence.)
Caput XCVI.	Chapter XCVI.
Sagittae diuersificantur secundum species suas, et secundum loca in quibus cadunt ex corpore.	Sagittae are varied according to their kind and according to the place from which they are expelled from the body.
Earum uero diuersitas est: quoniam ex eis sunt quae habent cuspides magnos, et paruos: et concauae, et surdae.	The diversity of ears is great: for some have large teeth, others have small teeth, and some are concave and others are convex.
Et ex eis sunt quae habent tres angulos.	And some have three angles
Et ex eis quibus sunt linguae.	And some have tongues.
Et ex eis quibus sunt astellae.	And some have stars.
Illae uero quae sunt secundum membra in quibus cadunt, est secundum duos modos.	The ears which are hung from the body are in two modes
Aut enim membra sunt ex membris principalibus concauis, sicut cerebrum, et cor, et epar, et pulmo, et renes, et intestina, et uesica, et eis similia.	Or they are like the great members which are concave, such as the brain, the heart, the spleen, the lung, the kidneys, the intestines, and the bladder, and things like these
Quando ergo cadit in aliquo horum membrorum, et apparent tibi signa mortis, quae ego narro tibi post, tunc oportet ut deuites extractionem illius sagittae ex eis, nam mors consequitur illum in quo est, in pluribus dispositionibus.	When any of these great members falls into some part of the body and appears to be a sign of death, which I will tell you afterwards, then it is necessary to remove that arrow from the ear, for death follows the wound in many situations
Et quando non apparent tibi ista signa mala, et sagitta non est absconsa in profunditate membri, tunc extrahe ipsam, et cura uulnus.	And when it is not evident that there is a bad sign and the arrow is not hidden in the depth of the member, then extract it and care for the wound.
Ex signis enim cerebri quando cadit in eo sagitta, et penetrat os, et egreditur siphac quod est super cerebrum, est: quoniam accidunt ex illo soda uehemens, et scotomia, et uertigo, et rubedo in oculis, et inflatio, et rubedo linguae, et spasmus, et permixtio intellectus, et uomitus cholerae.	When the arrow falls into the brain and penetrates the bone, and comes out through the skull, these signs are: because there are exuding from that place bile which causes swelling, and bruising, and vertigo, and redness in the eyes, and inflation, and redness of the tongue, and spasm, and confusion of the mind, and vomiting of bile.
Et fortasse egreditur sanguis ex naribus, aut auribus.	And perhaps blood comes out of the nose or the ears.
Et fortasse abscinditur sermo, et destruitur uox.	And perhaps the speech is stammered, and the voice is lost
Et egreditur ex loco uulneris humiditas alba similis pulti.	And comes out from the wound a white moisture like pus
Et exit ex eo simile aquositati carnis.	And comes out like water of meat
Si ergo apparent tibi ista signa, tunc abstine a curatione, et extrahe sagittam si non egreditur.	If any sign of the disease be apparent to thee, then abstain from treatment, and draw out the arrow if it does not issue forth.
Signa autem sagittae quando cadit in corde, sunt: quod ipsa est prope mammillam sinistram: et sentit cum ea quasi ipsa sit fixa in re dura, non in re uacua.	When an arrow lies in the cord, the signs are: that it is close to the left breast: and that it feels as though it were fixed in something hard, not in something soft
Et fortasse sagittae est motus similis motui pulsus: et currit ex uulnere sanguis niger.	The arrow may also be moved like the pulse: and it runs from the wound of black blood.
Et sequitur illud frigus extremitatum, et sudor frigidus, et syncopis.	And following this will be coldness at the extremity, and cold sweat, and fainting.
Scias ergo, quod mors descendit procul dubio.	Know therefore that death approaches with certainty.
Et signum sagittae quando uulnerat pulmonem, est exitus sanguinis spumosi ex uulnere: et uasa quae sequuntur collum, apostematur, et mutatur color infirmi.	When the arrow wounds the lung, the sign is the emission of bloody froth from the wound: and the after-effects which follow the collar, become pale, and change the colour of the patient.
Et expirat spiritum magnum, altum: et quaerit attractionem aeris frigidi.	And the spirit expires greatly, loudly: and seeks the attraction of cold air
Quod si cadat sagitta in uelamen, quod est in pectore: tunc est prope costas paruas: et fit anhelitus magnus cum dolore uehementi, cum suspirio: et mouentur omnia membra humerorum.	If an arrow falls into the diaphragm, which is in the chest: then it is near the flanks: and there is a great panting with pain, with breath holding, with sighing: and all the limbs of the arms are moved
Et si cadat sagitta in stomachum, tunc fortasse egreditur ex uulnere ex cibo aliquid indigestum.	If an arrow falls into the stomach: then perhaps it will issue from the wound from some undigested food
Et si cadit sagitta in Ventrem, et figitur in eo: egreditur aliquid stercoris ex uulnere, aut zirbum, aut intestinum quod iam disruptum est.	If an arrow falls into the belly, and it lies there: something of stool will issue from the wound, or blood, or intestine which has been broken
Non est ergo spes in curatione eius, neque in extractione sagittae.	There is no hope in the treatment of this, neither in the extraction of the arrow.
Quod si sagitta cadat in Vesicam, et egrediatur urina: et procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, et fortior sit dolor super infirmum: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	If an arrow falls into the bladder, and it is ejected: and something proceeds from it outwards, and the pain is greater over the patient: then you know that it is mortal
Reliqua autem membra, sicut facies, et collum, et guttur, et spatula, et adiutorium, et spondiles dorsi, et furcula, et coxa, et crus, et eis similia ex membris saluantur secundum plures dispositiones: quando non inuenit sagitta arteriam, aut neruum: et non est sagitta uenenosa.	The remaining members, namely the face, neck, chest, gut, spatula, aidant, spine, rib, hip, thigh, and knee, are similar to one another and are treated in accordance with various dispositions: when neither an arrow nor a nerve is found.
Et ego narro tibi quod uidi de esse harum sagittarum, ut significes per illud super curationem tuam.	I also tell you that I have seen no such arrows, which would signify that this is beyond your care.
Quod est, quia cuidam uiro cecidit sagitta in lachrymali oculi eius, in radice nasi.	That is, because I take care that the arrow of envy does not reach his eye or his nose root.
Extraxi ergo eam ipsi ex parte altera, sub adipe auris eius: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei in oculo eius nocumentum.	I extracted it from his other side, under the fat of his ear: and he was healed, and no mark remained on his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam Iudaeo, quae cecidit ei in adipe oculi sui sub palpebra inferiori: et sagitta iam occultata erat, et non consecutus sum ex ea nisi extremitatem paruam eius, cum qua adhaeret in ligno suo: et erat sagitta magna ex sagittis arcuum Turcorum, cum ferro leni, in qua non sunt aures.	And I extracted another arrow from a Jew, which had penetrated him in the fat of his eye under the lower eyelid: and the arrow was hidden, and I did not find its tip until I had removed a portion of the wood from it: and it was a great arrow, like those of the Turkish archers, with a lead tip, in which there were no ears
Sanatus est ergo Iudaeus, et non accidit in oculo eius accidens malum.	He was healed of this, and no bad thing happened to his eye
Et extraxi sagittam aliam ex gutture Christiani.	And I extracted another arrow from the belly of a Christian.
Et erat sagitta arabica, et est illa cui sunt aures.	And it was an Arabic arrow, which is like those which have ears
Secui ergo super ipsam inter duas guidegi: et iam submersa erat in gutture eius.	Following this, between two ribs: and it was deeply embedded in his belly
Subtiliatus sum ergo cum ea, donec extraxi eam: et sanatus est Christianus.	I was careful with it until I extracted it: and the Christian was healed.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam uiro quae ceciderat in uentre eius: et cogitauimus, quia moreretur ex ea.	And I extracted another one which had penetrated his chest: and we thought that he would die from it
Postquam ergo praeterierunt ei triginta dies, et non mutatum est super eum aliquid ex dispositionibus eius, secui super sagittam: et ingeniaui super eam, et extraxi eam: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei accidens malum.	Afterward, when thirty days had passed, and no change appeared in his condition with regard to the arrow, we thought that it would be better to remove it: and we did so, and he was healed, and no bad thing happened to him
Et uidi uirum cui cecidit sagitta in dorso eius, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam.	And the arrow that had pierced the man in his back has become fixed, and a knot has formed above it.
Postquam ergo fuit post septem annos, exiuit sagitta in radice coxae eius.	And thus has the arrow remained for seven years, since it went out from the root of his thigh
Et uidi mulierem cui cecidit in uentre suo sagitta, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam, et remansit sagitta intra ipsam: et non mutata est ex dispositionibus eius aliqua, et mulier non inuenit ei nocumentum in aliqua ex operationibus suis naturalibus.	And the arrow that had pierced the woman in her belly has become fixed, and a knot has formed above it, and the arrow remains inside her: and it has not changed from its positions, and the woman has not found any relief from her natural operations.
Et uidi uirum alium, cui cecidit sagitta in facie sua: et consolidatum est uulnus, et remansit, non inueniens ei multum dolorem: et similia istis multa.	And the arrow that had pierced the man on his face has become fixed, and a knot has formed, and it remains, without causing him much pain: and there are many like this.
Et extraxi sagittam uiro ex principibus Regis, quae ceciderat ei in medio nasi sui, et iam declinauerat ad partem dextram parumper: et occultata erat sagitta tota.	And I extracted the arrow from the King's nose, which had pierced him in the middle of his nose, and it had inclined towards the right side downwards: and the arrow was completely hidden.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius post casum sagittae usque ad tres dies.	I was called to treat him for the wound caused by the arrow until three days later.
Inueni ergo uulnus sagittae strictum ualde.	I found the knot of the arrow to be firm and high up
Inquisiui ergo eam cum tenta subtili, et non sensi eam: et ipse quidem inueniebat punctionem et dolorem sub aure sua ex parte dextra.	I asked him to move his limb slightly with a gentle touch, and he did not feel pain: and even I could see the puncture mark and the pain beneath his right ear
Speraui ergo, quod erat illa punctio ex extremitate sagittae.	I hope that this was the puncture made by the tip of the arrow.
Emplastraui ergo locum cum emplastro in quo erat uirtus attractiua, et digestiua, confidens apud me, quod apostemaretur locus, et appareret mihi signum sagittae, ut secarem super eam: et non accidit in loco accidens significans quod sagitta consecuta sit locum.	I plastered the place with a pleasant and digestible ointment, trusting that the wound would heal, and that the sign of the arrow would disappear on its own: and it did not happen in the place of the wound that the arrow had followed
Assiduaui ergo cum emplastro super eum diebus multis: et non accidit accidens, et consolidatum est uulnus interim: et remansit infirmus de extractione eius spacio dierum, donec sensit sagittam die quodam intra nasum suum.	I attended to him with the ointment for many days: and no accident happened, and the knot consolidated in the meantime: and he felt the arrow again on the following day inside his nose
Et narrauit mihi illud.	And he told me that.
Posui ergo super illud uulnus medicinam acutam, corrosiuam diebus multis, donec apertum est: et cum tenta tentaui ipsum, et sensi extremitatem sagittae subtilem quae adhaeret in ligno.	And he told me that he placed upon it a sharp instrument, corrosive for many days, until it had opened: and when he had tried to grasp it, he found a slight arrowhead adhering to the wood.
Deinde addidi in apertione uulneris per illam medicinam acutam, donec apparuit nobis uisibiliter extremitas sagittae: et praeteriit mihi cum eo spacium temporis circiter quatuor menses.	And then I added to the incision the sharp instrument, until we saw the tip of the arrow clearly: and we left it for about four months
Deinde postquam amplificatum est uulnus, et possible fuit mihi intromittere forcipes in ipsam, et mouere ipsam, et non obediuit ad exitum: tunc non cessaui subtiliare, et ingeniare super eam cum modis ingeniorum, donec coepi super eam die quodam cum forcipibus decenter factis, secundum quod ueniet forma eorum in fine capituli, donec extraxi eam.	And when the wound had healed, and it was possible for me to introduce forceps into it, and to move it, and it did not yield: then I did not desist from the subtle probing, but devised ways and means to protect it, until I came to do the same with forceps of a greater size, as it happened in the end of the chapter, when I drew out the arrow
Deinde restauraui uulnus.	And I restored the wound.
Et medici quidem iudicant, quod cartilago nasi non restauratur.	And the physicians say that the cartilage of the nose is not restored
Restauraui ergo ipsam, et consolidatum est uulnus, et sanatus est infirmas sanitate integra: nec nocuit ei aliquid omnino.	I restored it, and the wound was consolidated and healed with perfect health: and nothing remained of it
Et ego narro tibi qualitatem extractionis quarundam sagittarum: ut ponas illud regulam et significationem super illud quod non dixi.	And I tell you the nature of the extraction of several arrows: so that you will know the rule and the signification of this which I have not mentioned
Quoniam partes huius artis et distinctiones earum non comprehenduntur cum narratione: neque comprehendit illud liber, et artifex prudens comparat cum pauco super multum: et cum eo quod est paesens, super illud quod est absens: et inuenit operationem nouam, et instrumentum nouum apud descensus rerum extranearum huius artis quando accidunt.	For the parts of this art and their distinctions are not comprehended by the narration: neither did that book comprehend them, nor did the skillful artificer compare them with little to much: and when he found that which is present was wanting, and that which was absent was present: he invented a new operation and a new instrument in the descent of these things of this art when they arise
Dico ergo, quod sagittae non egrediuntur ex membris quibus sunt fixae, nisi secundum duos modos.	I say therefore, that arrows do not come out of the members in which they are fixed, except in two ways.
Aut per attractionem ex loco ex quo intrauit.	Or by traction from the place from whence it came in.
Aut contrario partis alterius.	Or from the opposite part.
Et illa quae egreditur unde intrauit, aut est sagitta procedens in loco carnoso: et attrahitur, et egreditur.	And that which goes out from whence it came, or that is to say the arrow proceeding in the fleshy place: it is drawn and goes out.
Quod si non obedit ad exitum ex hora in qua cadit: tunc oportet ut dimittas ipsam aliquot diebus, donec putrefiat caro quae est in circumitu eius: et alleuietur attractio eius, et eius egressio.	If it does not obey the exit at the hour in which it fell: then it is necessary that you delay it for a few days, until the putrefaction of the flesh which is around it is over: and you must relax the traction and the going out of it
Et similiter si figitur in osse, et non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc dimitte ipsam etiam aliquot diebus: et itera eam cum attractione et motione omni die, donec egreditur.	And in like manner if it is fixed in a bone, and it does not obey you at the exit: then you must also delay it for a few days: and do it again every day with traction and motion, until it goes out
Quod si non obedit tibi ad exitum post dies, tunc oportet ut perfores in circumitu sagittae in ipso osse ab omni parte cum terebro subtili, donec amplificentur sagittae.	If it does not obey you at the exit after days: then you must perform an incision around the arrow in the very bone from all sides with a fine thread, until the arrow is amplified
Deinde attrahe eam, et extrahe ipsam.	And then draw it and pull it out
Si autem sagitta est fixa in capitis osse, et iam processit in uno uentrium cerebri, et apparent ex infirmo quaedam illorum accidentium quae dixi: tunc abstine ab attractione sagittae, et dimitte eam, donec aequetur esse eius post dies.	If however the arrow is fixed in the head of the bone, and it has gone through one of the veins of the brain, and appears from the wound some of those accidents which I mentioned: then abstain from the traction of the arrow and leave it, until it becomes equal to itself after days.
Nam si sagitta peruenit ad sifach, tunc mors non prolongatur ei.	For if the arrow goes on to the marrow, the death is not prolonged for it
Et si sagitta non est fixa, nisi in corpore ossis tantum, et non penetrat usque ad sifach: et remanet infirmus aliquot diebus, et non accidit ei ex illis accidentibus aliquid: tunc ingenia in attractione sagittae et extractione eius.	And if the arrow is not fixed except in the body of the bone, and does not penetrate until the marrow: and remains wounded for a few days, and nothing of those accidents happens to it: then think of the traction of the arrow and its pulling out
Si autem est fixa ualde, et non obedit tibi ad attractionem: tunc administra terebella in circumitu sagittae, sicut narraui tibl: deinde cura locum, donec sanetur.	If however it is fixed loosely, and does not obey you at the traction: then administer a bandage around the arrow as I have told you: then take care of the place, until it is healed.
Si autem Sagitta iam absconsa est in loco corporis, et occultatur et absconditur a sensu: tunc inquire eam cum tenta.	If, however, the arrow is hidden in some part of the body, and is hidden and concealed from sense: then inquire concerning it with a grasp.
Si autem sentis eam, tunc attrahe eam cum quibusdam instrumentis quae conueniunt attractioni eius.	If you feel it, then grasp it with some instrument which is suitable for its attraction.</start_of_turn>
Si autem non potes super eam, propter constrictionem uulneris, et propter longitudinem sagittae in profundo: et non est illic os, neque neruus, neque uena: tunc finde super eam, donec amplificetur uulnus, et sit possibile extrahere sagittam.	If, however, you cannot see it, because of the constriction of the wound, and because of the length of the arrow in depth: and there is neither bone, nor nerve, nor blood vessel there: then find above it until the wound is enlarged, and it is possible to extract the arrow.</start_of_turn>
Quod si sunt ei aures quibus teneatur, tunc libera carnem fixam in eis ab omni parte, omni ingenio quo potes illud, et ingenia, si non potest super euasionem carnis in fractura aurium, et contorsione earum, donec euadat.	Which if there are any ears which hold it, then loosen the flesh fixed in the bone from every side, by every means which you can think, and contort, if you cannot see beyond the fracture of the ears, and the twisting of the ears, until it comes loose.</start_of_turn
Et tu quando administras extractionem Sagittae, in quocumque loco est, tunc utere contorsione manus tuae, cum forficibus ad partes omnes, donec facias eam euadere: et subtilia ultima subtilitate, ut non frangatur Sagita, et fiat difficilis tibi attractio eius, et ipsius extractio.	And when you administer the extraction of the arrow, in whatever place it is, then use the twisting of your hand, with forceps at all parts, until you make it come loose: and with the last slight pull, that the arrow may not break, and that its extraction should be difficult, and itself be extracted.</start_of_turn
Quod si non potes super eam ex hora una, tunc dimitte eam diebus aliquot, donec putrefiant quae sunt in circumitu eius.	If you cannot see it from one hour, then leave it for a few days, until the things which are around it have putrefied.</start_of_turn
Deinde itera eam: alleuietur enim tuncia Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra quod diximus ex curatione in capitulo suo: et custodi uirtutem tuam ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, aut chordae.	Then repeat it: for it will aid you in that it makes the flux of blood easier. Then administer what we have said from the chapter on treatment: and guard your virtue from the incision of the vein, or the nerve, or the chord.</start_of_turn>
Et administra ingenium omni modo quo tibi possibile est euasionis Sagittae: et sit illud cum facilitate, et tranquillitate, uel tarditate, et firmitate, sicut narraui tibi.	And administer ingenuity in every way which is possible for you to achieve the extraction of the arrow: and let it be with ease, and tranquility, or slowly, and firmly, as I have said to you.</start_of_turn
Et oportet, ut facias cum trahis Sagittam, ut infirmus sit secundum figuram, secundum quam fuit apud casum Sagittae in ipso.	It is necessary that you make the patient conform to the figure of the arrow according to how it was in the case of the arrow itself.
Quoniam est magis iuuatiuum.	Since this is the case, you must make the patient conform to the form of the arrow as it is in the case of the arrow itself.
Si autem non est tibi possibile illud, tunc administra quod tibi est possibile ex figuris.	If this is not possible, then do what you can from the figure.
Sagitta autem quae egreditur ex contrario partis alterius, aut iam procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora: aut facit gibbositatem extremitas Sagittae per sensum ex superiore parte cutis propinquae, et uides eam eminentem: seca ergo super eam, et sit sectio secundum quantitatem quod capiant in ea forcipes.	The arrow which proceeds from the opposite side of the other, or which proceeds from that to the exterior: or it makes a prominence at the extremity of the arrow by means of the sense from the upper part of the skin nearby, and it dries up: thus it is above the wound, and the section is according to the quantity which they take in that clamp.
Deinde attrahe eam: ipsa namque fit facilis ad exitum.	Then draw out the arrow: itself will thereby become easy to expel.
Si uero retinetur in osse, tunc torque manum tuam secundum rotunditatem, donec imprimat Sagitta in osse, et amplificet sibiipsi: deinde trahe ipsam.	If it remains in the bone, then turn your hand according to the roundness, until you press the arrow into the bone, and amplify it: then draw it out
Et si non: dimitte eam diebus aliquot: deinde itera eam, donec egrediatur.	If not: leave it for a few days: then do it again, until it comes out by itself
Quod si lignum Sagittae est in ea, tunc impelle ipsam cum eo.	If the arrow is in wood, then push it out with that.
Si autem cecidit lignum, et uis administrare impulsionem: tunc intromitte ad eam instrumentum concauum, ut ingrediatur concauitas eius in caudam Sagittae: deinde impelle eam cum ipso.	If the wood has broken, and you wish to administer a push: then introduce an instrument with a concave edge into the wound so that it may join the concavity of the instrument to the heel of the arrow: then push out the arrow with that.
Si autem Sagita est concaua, tunc impelle eam cum instrumento intrante in ipsam.	If the arrow is concave, then push out the arrow with an instrument entering into it
Sagitta enim alleuiatur per illud.	The arrow will be expelled by that.
Quod si Sagitta est toxicata, tunc oportet, ut concaues carnem totam, in qua est uenenum: si est tibi possibile illud.	If the arrow is venomous, then it is necessary to cut away the entire piece of flesh in which the poison is: if this is possible
Deinde cura eam cum eo quod conuenit ad illud.	Then care for it with that which is suitable for it.
Quod si Sagitta est cadens in pectore, aut in uentre, aut in uesica, aut in latere: et est propinqua ex eo quod tangis cum tenta, et possibile est tibi secare super eam: tunc seca, et caue ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, et extrahe eam.	If an arrow is falling in the chest, or in the belly, or in the bladder, or on the side: and it is close to that which you touch with your finger, and it is possible for you to cut over it: then cut, and cauterize from the incision of the belly, or nerve, and extract the arrow.
Deinde sue uulnus, si uides, et cura illud, donec sanetur.	Then bandage it, if necessary, and care for it until it is healed.
Et haec est forma Forcipum, quibus extrahuntur Sagittae.	And this is the form of forceps, with which arrows are extracted.
Sint extremitates similes rostro auis, quae factae sunt sicut ferra: quando capiunt super Sagittam, non dimittunt eam.	There are two similar extremities like the beak of a bird, which are made like iron: when they grasp over the arrow, they do not slacken it
Et fiunt ex eis species multae, magnae, et paruae, et mediae, secundum quantitatem magnitudinis Sagittae, et paruitatis eius, et amplitudinis uulneris, et constrictionis eius.	And there are many kinds of forceps, great and small, medium and small, according to the quantity of the magnitude of the arrow, and the rarity of it, and the width of the wound, and the constriction of it.
Forma Impellentis concaui.	Concave Impeller Form.</start_of_turn>
Et forma Impellentis surdi.	And the form of the Impeller is blunt.</start_of_turn
Hoc est surdae extremitatis sicut Radius, ut alleuietur introitus eius in sagittam concauam, et impellatur cum eo.	This is the shape of the extremity like a Radius, so as to facilitate the entrance of its entrance into the concave arrow, and to drive it with that.</start_of_turn
Huius extremitas impellentis concauae est concaua sicut penna auis: ut alleuietur introitus sagittae in ipsam et impulsio eius.	This extremity of the Impeller is concave like the beak of a bird: so as to facilitate the entrance of the arrow into itself and the driving of it.</start_of_turn

Caput XCVII.	Chapter 147.</start_of_turn
Uenae phlebotomandae, quarum cucurrit consuetudo in corpore, sunt triginta.	The veins that are to be phlebotomized, whose custom runs in the body, are thirty.</start_of_turn
Ex quibus in capite sunt sexdecim: duae Venae pulsatiles, quae sunt post aures, dictae duae Herbae: et duae Arteriae, quae sunt in duobus timporibus apparentes: et duae Venae quae sunt in duobus lachrymalibus duorum oculorum, quae dicuntur Aspicientes: et Vena praeparata in medio frontis: et uena quae est in extremitate nasi.	From the head there are sixty: two pulsating veins which are behind the ears, two herbs which are in the two temples, two arteries which are visible in two temporal regions, two veins which are in the two tear ducts of the two eyes, which are called Aspicientes, a vein prepared in the middle of the forehead, and a vein which is at the extremity of the nose.
Et duae Guidegi, quae sunt in collo.	And two guide veins which are in the neck.
Et duae uenae quae sunt in labio superiore oris.	And two veins which are in the upper lip of the mouth.
Et duae uenae quae sunt in labio inferiore.	And two veins which are in the lower lip
Et istae sunt uenae quae dicuntur Algecherich.	And these are the veins which are called Algecherich.

Venae autem tres quae phlebotomantur in cubito, sunt in quarum phlebotomia cucurrit consuetudo in omnibus hominibus.	The three veins which are to be bled in the cubit are such that their phlebotomy is customary in all men
Et phlebotomia earum fit secundum duos modos.	And their phlebotomy is done in two ways.
Aut pungendo cum phlebotomo myrtino lato: aut oliuari ad subtilitatem decliui: aut secando cum phlebotomo cultellari, et est Alnesil.	Either by grasping with the forceps with a broad handle: or by using oil to soften the skin: or by cutting with a knife, which is Alnesil
Et haec est forma eius.	This is its form.
Sic Alnesil est, quod conuenit ad sectionem.	Thus is the way of it.
Et ex eis sunt species latae, et subtiles secundum amplitudinem uenarum et stricturam earum Forma phlebotomi myrtini sit lata, sicut uides.	There are many different forms of it, and subtle according to the width of the veins and the degree of tension.
Et conuenit ad aperiendas uenas concauas, plenas, procedentes, apparentes, grossas, et illas quae continent sanguinem grossum, turbidum.	It is suitable for opening wide, plump, protruding, visible, large, and those which contain thick blood
Et iste phlebotomus est minoris latitudinis, et subtilioris extreminatis.	This phlebotomy is of smaller width and more delicate extremity

¶ De phlebotomia Basilicae.	Of the phlebotomy of the Basilica.
Basilicae autem quae est una harum trium uenarum phlebotomiae iuuamentum est.	The Basilica is one of these three veins which receive the phlebotomy.
Quia extrahit sanguinem ex aegritudinibus, quae sunt sub gutture et collo, ex eo quod sequitur pectus, et uentrem: et conuenit phlebotomatori cum phlebotomat eam, ut caueat, et sit super timorem ex ea nam sub ea est arteria.	Because it draws blood from the abscesses, which are under the throat and chin, from the thing which follows the chest, and the belly: and it is suitable for the phlebotomist with the phlebotomy of the veins, in order to prevent excessive bleeding from them which is below
Si ergo errat, et addit in punctura phlebotomi, incidet illam arteriam, et accidet fluxus sanguinis.	If, therefore, he is mistaken, and adds too much in the puncture of the phlebotomy, he will reach the artery, and there will be a flow of blood
Quapropter oportet, ne phlebotomet eam cum phlebotomo pungente: imo sit secans cum Alnesil.	Therefore it is necessary not to perform the phlebotomy together with the puncture: rather it should be dry like Alnesil.
Quod si non apparet Basilica apparitione manifesta, tunc oportet, ut alienes ipsam, et permuteris ad aliam, aut quaeras aliquem ramum eius: aut phlebotomes loco eius Funem brachii.	If the Basilica does not appear clearly, then one must seek it out, and change to another, or ask about someone of its branches: or perform the phlebotomy in its place, the forearm branch
Ipsa enim est manifesta, et seca eam cum phlebotomo Anesil, sicut diximus.	It is itself obvious, and dry with the phlebotomy of Alnesil, as we have said.
Si autem uis phlebotomiam ipsius eiusdem, tunc oportet ante stricturam brachii, ut tangas locum, donec cognoscas locum pulsus.	If however you wish to perform a phlebotomy on the same arm, then it is necessary before the tightening of the limb to touch the place, until you recognize the place of the pulse.
Deinde signa super locum cum encaustro, postea brachium, et seca uenam sectione concaua cum phlebotomo Alnesil, sicut diximus.	Then mark over the place with a scar, afterwards the limb, and dry the area with a concave section with the phlebotome of Alnesil, as we have said
Et caue ne cadat percussio per spacium a loco arteriae.	And beware lest the incision should slip from the place of the artery.
Et quando uides, cum tu stringis ligamen, inflationem in loco quem signasti cum encaustro, tunc illa inflatio est inflatio arteriae: deuita ergo eam.	And when you go, when you tighten the ligature, inflation in the place which you marked with a scar, then that inflation is the inflation of the artery: you must therefore do it
Quod si uides sanguinem apud phlebotomiam salire, sicut urina pueri, et est sanguis subtilis, rubeus: tunc scias, quia est ex sanguine arteriae.	That if blood should come out at the phlebotomy like urine from a boy, and is thin and red: then you know that it is from the artery.
Tunc ergo propera, et pone digitum tuum super ipsum spacio longo, deinde aufer digitum tuum.	Then therefore act with speed, and place your finger on the said long space, then take your finger away.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis (multotiens namque abscinditur) tunc stringe brachium, et dimitte ipsum: et caueat infirmus a motione eius: et sit super timorem eius.	If therefore blood is cut (for it is much cut), then tighten the limb, and let it go: and beware lest the patient should move: and be over his fear.
Et non moueat ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	And do not move it for a few days, until it is healed.
Si autem non abscinditur sanguis, et uincit te: et non est tibi praesens in momento tuo medicina, tunc incide arteriam, si apparet tibi.	If however blood does not cut, and it increases to you: and it is not in your presence at the present time of medicine, then cut the artery, if you see it
Nam extremitates eius contrahuntur, et abscinditur sanguis.	For its extremities are contracted, and blood is cut
Aut accipe corticem fistici, et finde eum: accipe medietatem unam, et stringe eam super locum uenae strictura decenti, cum ligamento et puluillis usque ad diem alium.	Or take the edge of the flesh, and find it: take half of one, and tighten it over the place of the vein with a ligature and a loop until the next day.
Tunc si abscinditur sanguis, est bonum.	Then if blood is cut, that is good.
Et si non: tunc cura ipsum cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio ex loco puluerum abscindentium fluxum sanguinis: et abscisio sanguinis eius non est difficilis in pluribus dispositionibus, propter locum paruum uulneris, et possibilitatem ligamenti ex brachio.	If not: then care for him with that with which preceded it, remembering from the place of the scattered fragments the flowing of blood: and the cutting of blood in this is not difficult in many situations, because of the smallness of the wound and the possibility of a ligament from the arm.
¶ De phlebotomia uenae Fuscae.	If not: then take care of him with that which preceded it, remembering from the place of the scattered fragments the flowing of blood: and the cutting of blood in this is not difficult in many situations, because of the smallness of the wound and the possibility of a ligament from the arm.
Venae autem Fuscae phlebotomiae iuuamentum est, quod trahit sanguinem ex superiori parte capitis, et inferiore corporis: propterea, quia est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae, sicut diximus.	But the veins of the Fuscae are suitable for phlebotomy, because they draw blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body: because they are composed of the branches of the basilica and the branches of the cephalic, as we said.
Et conuenit phlebotomanti eam, ut sit super timorem ex phlebotomia eius, nam sub ea est neruus.	And it is suitable for the phlebotomist that there be no fear of phlebotomy from him, for under this is a nerve.
Si ergo addit in punctura phlebotomi, et inuenit neruum, accidit in ea stupor, et difficilis fit sanatio eius, et fortasse non sanatur penitus.	If therefore he adds at the puncture of the phlebotomy, and finds a nerve, this will cause in him a stupor, and the healing of it will be difficult, and perhaps will not heal completely.</start_of_turn>
Et iste neruus multotiens apparet sensui.	And this nerve appears much to be connected with sensation.</start_of_turn>
Si autem occultatur in quibusdam hominibus, et est subtilis, et non ostenditur: tunc oportet ut ponas phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas, sectionem cum Alnesil, et deuita neruum cum fortitudine tua.	If, however, it is hidden in some men, and is slight, and is not evident: then you must take care that you do not perform the phlebotomy in such a way as to section the nerve with your forceps.
Quod si uena est inter duos neruos, tunc finde uenam in longitudine.	For if the vein is between two nerves, then find the vein in its length.</start_of_turn
¶ De uena Cephalica.	Of the cephalic vein.
Phlebotomiae autem uenae Cephalicae iuuamentum est, quia attrahit sanguinem ex capite, et confert ad aegritudines oculorum.	But the phlebotomy of the cephalic vein is suitable, because it draws blood from the head and supplies it to the eyes.</start_of_turn
Et oportet in hac uena proprie, si uis, ut phlebotomes eam pungendo cum phlebotomo oliuari, aut cum phlebotomo myrtino: quoniam est saluior uenarum omnium, quoniam non est subea arteria, neque neruus.	And it must be done with its own needle, if you will, for the puncture with the olive or with the myrtle is safer, because it is less likely to reach an artery or a nerve.</start_of_turn
Verumtamen conuenit tibi apud phlebotomiam, ut deuites cum phlebotomo caput lacerti tantum, et quaeras locum leniorem: et non nocet ei, si non inuenitur cum percussione prima, ut iteretur super eam cum phlebotomia aliquotiens.	True indeed; it meets with you at the phlebotomy, that you may take with the phlebotomist only the head of the lacerated part, and inquire about a softer place: for it does no harm to him, if it is not found at the first percussion, as it may return above with further phlebotomy.
Verumtamen fortasse apostematur in quibusdam hominibus quando non phlebotomatur in percussione prima, sed non nocet ei illud apostema in aliquo.	True indeed; it often happens in some that when not bled at the first percussion, it does not harm them.
¶ De utilitate Phlebotomiae, et cautelis in ea obseruandis.	Of the usefulness of Phlebotomy, and the precautions to be taken in its performance.
Qualitas autem Phlebotomiae, et accidentia eius ex ea, in cuius rectificatione oportet te cogitare.	The quality of Phlebotomy, and the accidents which may arise from it, concerning which you must reflect
Primum ergo illius est de quo oportet ut scias, quod phlebotomia non administratur, nisi in conseruatione sanitatis, et perseuerantia eius, et cautela ab aduentu aegritudinum.	Firstly, therefore, you must know that Phlebotomy is not administered except for the preservation of health, and for the perseverance of its efficacy, and the precautions against the introduction of diseases.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in una uenarum trium quae sunt in cubito, scilicet Cephalica, et Fusca, et Basilica.	And that it is performed in one of the three veins which are in the elbow, namely the Cephalica, and the Fusca, and the Basilica.

Et fiat phlebotomia in die primo, aut in tertio, postquam praeterierint de die tres horae.	And it is performed on the first or third day after three hours have passed
Phlebotomia autem quae administratur in aegritudinibus, non habet horam determinatam: sed quando prouocat conuenientia et necessitas ad illud, in nocte, aut die, et in omni hora, et in omni tempore.	Phlebotomy, however, which is administered in diseases, has no fixed hour: but when it brings about convenience and necessity for this, in the night or day, and at every hour, and at every time
Et non oportet, ut phlebotomentur pueri, donec ueniant super eos quatuordecim anni.	And it is not proper to bleed children until they are fourteen years of age
Neque phlebotometur mulier praegnans, nisi a mense quarto usque ad septimum.	Neither should a pregnant woman be bled except from the fourth month until the seventh
Neque phlebotomentur senes, qui iam pertransierunt sexaginta annos.	Neither are old men to be bled, who have passed their sixties.
Cum ergo aliquis uult phlebotomari propter quemcumque modum sit: oportet, ut mundificet intestina sua ante phlebotomiam cum clisteri leni, si in eis est stercus multum retentum: ut non attrahant uenae apud phlebotomiam ex intestinis superfluitates putridas nocentes membris principalibus.	Neither are old men to be bled, who have passed their sixties.
Neque phlebotometur patiens toctina, id est, satietatem nauseatiuam: neque crapulatus, neque euadens ab ebrietate, donec remoueatur illud ab eis.	Neither are old men to be bled, who have passed their sixties.
Neque infirmus cum hydropisi.	Neither are old men to be bled, who have passed their sixties.
Et caueatur phlebotomia iterum post colicam passionem, et uomitum, et fluxum uentris, et multiplicationem coitus, et laboris, et exercitii, et uigiliarum, et ieiunii, et omnis quod dissoluit uirtutem ex re corporea aut animali.	Neither are old men to be bled, who have passed their sixties
Deinde considera in subtilitate humorum ante illud, si sanguis est grossus cum cibis et potibus, et medicinis: si possibile est ei illud.	Neither are old men to be bled, who have passed their sixties
Deinde introeat balneum, si non prohibet ipsum aliquid: aut exercitetur aliquo exercitio, ut subtilietur sanguis.	Neither are old men to be bled, who have passed their sixties
Et pone phlebotomiam eius in pectore, circa tertiam diei, sicut diximus: et conare, ut euacuetur pectus eius illa die ex omnibus accidentibus animalibus malis: sicut angustia, et ira, et timor: et ex omnibus accidentibus corporeis, sicut labor, et poena, et superfluicoitus, et illis similia.	Neither are old men to be bled, who have passed their sixties
Et sedi suae faciat esse praesentes res cum quarum usu cucurrit consuetudo hominum ex aromaticitate, et odoramento, et tripudio et similibus illis per quantitatem possibilitatis.	Neither are old men to be bled, who have passed their sixties
Deinde sedeat phlebotomator super puluinari, quod sit altius quam puluinar phlebotomandi: postea extrahat brachium suum, et fricet ipsum phlebotomator manu sua bis, aut ter.	Neither are old men to be bled, who have passed their sixties
Deinde stringat ligamentum cum corrigia, et inuoluat eam bis.	Neither are old men to be bled, who have passed their sixties
Et sit strictura temperata, quoniam strictura quando est inaequalis, aut per superfluitatem in strictura, tunc prohibet cursum sanguinis: aut in mollificatione, tunc etiam prohibet cursum sanguinis.	Neither are old men to be bled, who have passed their sixties
Deinde post stricturam oportet, ut fricet phlebotomandus manus suas simul adinuicem, donec inflentur uenae, et declarentur sensui.	Then after the stricture, it is necessary that the phlebotomist should hold his hand towards the inside, until the veins are filled, and until they are declared to be full by sense.
Deinde abstergat phlebotomator phlebotomum cum pauco oleo, antiquo proprie.	Then the phlebotomist should withdraw the phlebotome with little force, as before.</start_of_turn>
Deinde ponat digitum suum indicem manus sinistrae super ipsam uenam sub loco cuius phlebotomiam uult, parum: ut non fugiat uena, et cassetur percussio.	Then he places his finger on the index of his left hand over the vein at the place where he wishes to make the phlebotomy, somewhat: so that the vein does not flee, and so that the percussion may be set.</start_of_turn>
Quoniam ex uenis est quam inuenis sicut chordam fugientem apud phlebotomiam: et ex eis est quae est plena uentositate: et quando ponis phlebotomum super eam, contrahitur sub phlebotomo, et decipitur phlebotomator, et non aperit phlebotomus uenam: et si aperit eam, est stricta: propter illud ergo oportet, ut firmetur phlebotomator, et sit sollicitus in his rebus omnibus.	For from the veins is as from strings which are fleeing from the phlebotomy: and from the veins is that which is full of blood: and when you place the phlebotome upon it, it contracts under the phlebotome, and the phlebotomist is struck, and the phlebotomy does not open the vein: and if it does open the vein, it is a stricture: because of that therefore it is necessary that the phlebotomist should be firm, and attentive in all these matters.</start_of_turn>
Deinde deponat phlebotomum.	Then he lays down the phlebotome.</start_of_turn
Si ergo aperitur uena ex uice una, tunc bonum est.	If therefore the vein opens from one side, then it is good.</start_of_turn
Et si non, tunc itera illud uice alia sub illo loco parum, aut supra ipsum cum festinatione: si non apostematur locus.	And if not, then do it again with that side somewhat lower, or above it with speed: if the place does not yield.</start_of_turn
Quod si apostematur, aut expauescit infirmus, tunc dimitte eum die, aut duobus diebus: et non stringat ligamentum.	And if it yields, or the patient becomes faint, then let him go away for one day, or two: and do not bind the ligament.</start_of_turn
Fortasse enim attrahet apostema calidum.	Perhaps indeed the swelling will draw away.</start_of_turn
Neque ingrediatur balneum.	Neither let him apply a poultice.</start_of_turn
Deinde iteret phlebotomiam, si amat.	Then repeat the phlebotomy if necessary.</start_of_turn>
Quod si apertio est parua, aut currit sanguis subtiliter: et times ut non egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uis: tunc itera phlebotomum in foramine ipso secundum rectitudinem, et adde in operatione parum.	If the opening is small, or blood runs too quickly: be careful lest blood escape beyond what is necessary. Then repeat the phlebotomy in the same place following the rule and add slightly more to the operation.
Et fac illud cum festinatione, antequam apostemetur locus, apostematus enim locus est in multis hominibus apud operationem paruam.	Do the same as when making a veinous opening before the place is closed. For in many people the closed place is near the area being operated on for a small matter.</start_of_turn>
Si ergo uides ipsum iam apostematum, tunc non iteres super ipsum omnino, non enim excusat apud te aliquid.	If therefore you wish to close it immediately, do not go over it entirely; for that would excuse you for nothing.</start_of_turn>
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex faece olei: quoniam alleuiat cursum sanguinis.	And place something soft over it of the fat of oil: because it will soothe the course of the blood.</start_of_turn>
Et est melior in hoc loco quam oleum ipsum, et quam reliqua olea.	Better is wax than oil in this place, and than any other oil.</start_of_turn>
Et similiter administra faecem olei in omni phlebotomia tua, qua phlebotomas uenas apud prohibitionem cursus sanguinis: et faciunt illud tyriaca alfarach, et sagzenea, quando ponitur ex una earum super locum.	And do the same with fat of oil in all your phlebotomies, which you make against the running of the blood: and make them thick as tyriaca alfarach and sage, when you put one on the other over the place.</start_of_turn>
Sanguis enim subtiliatur et resoluitur, quando est grossus.	Blood becomes thin and dissolves when it is thick.</start_of_turn
Quod si accidat in loco phlebotomiae apostema magnum, nam multotiens accidit, praecipue ei qui non est phlebotomatus nisi uice illa, aut est apertio uenae parua, tunc propera et pone super locum spongiam infusam in aqua et sale, calefacta parumper: et stringe eam hora una: quoniam soluitur.	If it happens that in the place of the phlebotomy the closing is large, for example because it is not a complete phlebotomy or because the opening of the vein is small: then be careful and put over the place a sponge soaked in water and salt, warmed up slightly: and bind it for one hour: for it will dissolve.</start_of_turn
Et oportet, ut facias illud post exitum sanguinis ex uena ipsa, cum complemento sui, aut ex uena alia.	And it is necessary that you do this after the blood has gone out of the vein, with the addition of something or from another vein.</start_of_turn
Quod si remanet in loco post dies aliquid nigredinis, aut uiriditatis, non nocet illud: et si uis, pone super ipsum aliquid aloe, aut myrrhae solutorum: aut aliquid ex succo menthastri, id est, calamenti aut simile illius.	If anything black or yellow remains in the place after a few days, it does no harm: and if you wish, put over it something of aloe or mastic gum, or something of the juice of mint, that is, calamine or something like that.</start_of_turn
Et multotiens quidem accidunt apostemata et eminentiae apud phlebotomiam Basilicae.	Many wounds also occur at the posteriors and eminences near the phlebotomy of Basilica.
Pone ergo manum tuam super ipsam, tunc si inuenis molliciem apud compressionem tuam super ipsam, tunc illa eminentia est mala.	Put your hand upon the wound; if you find softness under your compression, then that eminence is bad
Caue ergo, ut ponas super eam aliquid ex eo quod diximus.	Therefore, do as we have said before concerning that thing.
Nam fortasse fluet ex ea sanguis arteriae.	For perhaps blood will flow from it.
Sed fac emplastrum ei cum eo in quo est stipticitas, ut induretur locus.	But make a dressing for it with that which has styptic action, so that the place is bound up.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with the rest of the treatment, until it is healed.
Et oportet, ut extrahas omni homini ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis suae.	And it is necessary to draw out from every man from the blood according to the quantity of his virtue.
Et quod apparet ex colore uincente super sanguinem.	And what appears from the colour of the blood that is above it.
Nam sanguis si est niger, tunc dimitte ipsum exire, donec rubeat: et similiter si uides ipsum grossum: tunc dimitte eum, donec subtilietur: et similiter si est acutus, donec auferatur acuitas eius.	For blood that is black, then let it go out: and in the same way if you see it thick: then let it go, until it becomes thin: and in the same way if it is acute, until its sharpness is taken away
Et oportet ei qui est plenus, fortis, et indiget extractione sanguinis uice una, ut amplificetur phlebotomia uenae, et sit phlebotomus latus: et in eo qui est debilis, sit econtrario illius.	And it is necessary for him who is full, strong, and indigent of blood to take only one, so that the phlebotomy is facilitated by one, and that the phlebotomist is broad: and in him who is weak, let the contrary be done
Et oportet, ut extrahat ipsum in uicibus, et ut sit foramen strictum: et melius quod administratur in phlebotomia uenae est, ut sit transuersa sectio, non punctura.	And it is necessary to draw it out in small quantities, and that the hole be strict: and it is better that it be administered by phlebotomy of one, than by puncture.
Et iste modus phlebotomiae est saluus a fluxu sanguinis, et ab incisione nerui: et est laudabilior, et saluior quam phlebotomia per latitudinem et longitudinem.	And this method of phlebotomy is safer from the flow of blood, and from the cutting of nerves: and it is more praiseworthy, and safer than phlebotomy by breadth and length.
Et cui consueuit peruenire apud phlebotomiam syncopis, oportet ut cibes ante phlebotomiam modico pane infuso in aqua granati muzi: aut secaniabin, si est calefactus: et extrahas ei ex sanguine in tribus uicibus, aut quatuor.	And when it has become accustomed to remain beside the phlebotomies during the syncope, it is necessary that food be given to the patient before the phlebotomy with bread soaked in pomegranate juice: or dry bread, if it is heated: and take from him from the blood in three or four doses.
Et si est infrigidatae complexionis, tunc accipiat ante phlebotomiam panem infusum in syrupo miua, aut in syrupo de melle aromatizato cum speciebus, aut in syrupo aromatizato odorifero.	And if the patient is pale, then before the phlebotomy let him take bread soaked in pomegranate juice, or in honey syrup scented with spices, or in scented syrup with a strong odor
Quod si accidat syncopis apud phlebotomiam, et est caussa eius exitus sanguinis multi: tunc oportet, ut sumat in potu aquam carnis, et syrupum odoriferum subtilem: et utatur aromaticitate cum algalia, et liniatur pectus eius cum ea: et utatur reliquis quae diximus in diuisione in capitulo syncopis ex euacuatione.	And if there is fainting during the phlebotomy, and this is the cause of its exitus sanguinis multi: then it is necessary that he take in the drink water with meat, and a mild aromatic syrup: and let it be scented with herbs, and keep his chest filled with these things: and do all that we said in the chapter on fainting from evacuation.
Qui autem uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo: oportet ei cuius phlebotomia est propter euacuationem multam, et uirtus eius est debilis, ut soluat sanguinem paulatim per quantitatem uirtutis in diebus continuis.	Whoever wishes to restrain his arm and solve his blood slowly: must do that whose phlebotomy is because of a great evacuation, and his strength is weak, so that he may slowly solve the blood by the quantity of his strength in continuous days.
Qui uero uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo, et est corpus eius forte: tunc faciat illud post septem horas, aut nouem a phlebotomia sua prima.	Whoever wishes to restrain his arm and solve his blood slowly, and his body is strong: then let him do that after seven hours, or nine hours from his first phlebotomy.
Qui autem uult attrahere sanguinem ex corpore suo ad contrarium partis ad quam declinat: oportet ut euentetur ei in die secundo, aut in tertio.	Whoever wishes to draw blood from his body to the contrary part of which it hangs down: must do that in the second or third day.
In cuius uero corpore est sanguis multus iam calefactus, et acuitur, et facit accidere febrem: oportet, ut egrediatur ex eo sanguis in uice una, et extrahatur ex eo quantitas multa: et amplificetur apertio usquequo accidat syncopis: postquam tu fueris conseruans omnes conditiones phlebotomiae: et ut ponas manum tuam super pulsum eius apud cursum sanguinis, ut non accidat mors loco syncopis.	In whose body there is much blood that is heated and acute, and causes fever: it is necessary that it be drawn from him in one dose, and that a great quantity be extracted from him: and the opening should be increased until fainting occurs: after which you must preserve all the conditions of the phlebotomy, and put your hand over the pulse of his wrist beside the course of the blood, so that no fainting occurs at that place.
Multotiens enim accidit illud, quando ignorat phlebotomator, et cadit negligentia.	Many times, this occurs when the phlebotomist is ignorant and neglectful.
Et non oportet quando uis soluere brachium, et soluere sanguinem secundo, cum iam clausum sit orificium uenae, et fiat difficilis exitus sanguinis, ut prematur super ipsum cum uehementia, et curuatum extendatur uelociter.	It should not be when he wishes to close the arm and stop the bleeding, while the orifice of the vein is closed, and there is difficulty in the exit of the blood, as it will happen before that when he has delayed too long.
Nam illud est malum ualde, imo dimitte ipsum, donec phlebotometur secundo.	For indeed that is bad, rather let him depart, until the phlebotomist comes again in a second
Aut remoue cum acuitate phlebotomi illud quod coagulatum est ex sanguine in orificio uenae, et pone super ipsum aliquid salis dissoluti in aqua.	Or move quickly when the phlebotomy is acute that which has coagulated in the vein at the orifice, and put over it something salty dissolved in water
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex tyriaca alfaroch, aut sagzenea, et pone ipsum compressione leni, donec egrediatur sanguis.	And put over it something of Tyriaca Alfaroch, or sage, and press it gently, until the blood comes out
Si uero iam apostemata est uena, tunc dimitte eam, et non tegas eam, donec sedetur apostema.	If indeed the vein is clotted, then depart from it, and do not tighten it, until the clot has settled down.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad soluendum sanguinem secundo, et non est excusatio, tunc aut phlebotoma ipsum supra illum locum, aut in brachio alio in uena alia.	When indeed the need compels to stop the bleeding again, and it is not excusable, then either perform the phlebotomy above the place, or in another arm in another vein.
Funis autem brachii phlebotomatur loco Fuscae, et Basilicae, cum non inueniuntur, et sunt occultae, quoniam est composita ex eis.	But the veins of the forearm and the elbow, when not found, are hidden, because they are composed of marrow.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus manum suam in aqua calida, donec rubeat focile, et appareat uena manifeste.	And the quality of the phlebotomy is that it allows the patient to immerse his hand in warm water, until the skin reddens, and the vein appears clearly visible.
Deinde stringatur super ipsam cum ligamento parum constrictione media.	Then bind over it with a bandage with a moderate degree of constriction
Deinde phlebotoma secundum transuersationem paulatim, non latitudinaliter, neque secundum longitudinem: et sit apertio ampla, et sit phlebotomia tua qua eam phlebotomas super iuncturam manus parumper.	Then perform the phlebotomy in a transverse direction gradually, not latitudinally, neither along the length: and let the opening be wide, and let your phlebotomy be like that which you perform over a small wound of the hand
Quod si prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera manum in aqua calida, et dimitte sanguinem currere in aqua, donec consequaris necessitatem tuam.	If the flow of blood is prohibited, then move the hand into warm water, and let the blood run in the water until you reach your need.
Si autem fueris in diebus aestatis, tunc excusaris ab iteratione manus in aqua calida.	If you are in the summer days, then you are excused from moving the hand into warm water.
Et plurimum quidem ponitur cursus sanguinis in aqua calida in tempore hyemis.	And most of all, the course of blood is put in warm water in the winter time.
Et phlebotomia huius uenae est saluior omnibus uenis, quoniam non est sub ea uena pulsatilis, neque neruus.	And the phlebotomy of this vein is more useful to all diseases, because there is no pulsation under this vein, neither nerve.
Phlebotomia uero Saluatellae manus dextrae, est conferens aegritudinibus epatis.	The phlebotomy of the right hand is useful for the jaundice of the liver.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringas mahason manus cum ligamento, aut manu tua, postquam tu intromittis eam in aquam calidam, donec infletur uena, et demonsteretur sensui ualde.	And the quality of this phlebotomy is that you must bind the wrist with a string or your hand, after you have introduced the hand into the warm water, until the vein is swollen and you can feel the cold sensation
Deinde phlebotoma eam transuersando.	Then the phlebotomy is passed over.
Et si incidis eam totaliter, non nocebit ei illud in aliquo.	And if you cut the vein entirely, it will not cause any damage to him in any way.
Et conserua, ne ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo.	And be careful not to make the last move of your hand with the phlebotomy
Sub ea enim sunt nerui digitorum denudati ex carne.	Under this, indeed, are the nerves of the fingers naked from the flesh.
Deinde itera manum ad aquam calidam, et dimitte currere sanguinem in ea.	Then move the hand once more into the warm water, and let the blood run in it
Nam si tu non iteras eam in aqua calida, coagulatur sanguis in orificio uenae, et prohibetur a cursu.	For if you do not move the hand into the warm water, the blood coagulates in the opening of the vein, and is prohibited from flowing.
Cum ergo extraxeris ex sanguine quantitatem necessitatis, tunc pone super uenam oleum et sal: ut non consolidetur uelociter.	When you have therefore extracted from the blood the quantity of need, then put over the vein oil and salt: so that it does not solidify too quickly
Et similiter oportet, ut facias cum omni ramo stricto.	And in the same way it is necessary to do with every strict limb.
Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae eius ex manu sinistra, est: quoniam est conferens ad aegritudines splenis: et similiter fac in phlebotomia eius, sicut fecisti in secunda aequaliter.	The vein itself of the left hand is: because it is related to the diseases of the spleen: and do likewise in the phlebotomy of this, as you did in the second equal.
Saphenae autem phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad aegritudines quae sunt in inferiori parte corporis, sicut aegritudines matricum, et retentionem menstruorum, et infirmitates renum, et ulcera coxarum et crurium antiqua, et similia ex aegritudinibus.	The vein of the left hand indeed is: because it is related to the diseases which are in the lower parts of the body, such as the diseases of the uterus, and retention of menstrual blood, and kidney disease, and ulcers of the buttocks and ancient fractures, and similar diseases.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus pedem suum in aquam calidam: et faciat super ipsum fricationem, donec exuberent uenae: et liga supra iuncturam pedis cum corrigia.	And the quality of this phlebotomy is, that it lets the patient's foot enter the warm water: and make above it friction, until the veins burst: and ligate above the junction of the foot with the bandage.
Et uenae quidem locus est apud calcaneum, apparens uersus pollicem: et ramificantur ex ea in facie pedis rami multi.	And the veins are at the heel, appearing under the thumb: and they are broken from these in the face of the foot in many places.
Phlebotoma ergo eam in ampliore ramo eius, aut apud calcaneum in aggregatione eius: quoniam est melius et saluius.	The phlebotomy is therefore in the greater branch of this vein, or at the heel in its collection: because this is better and safer.
Quod si phlebotomas eam in facie pedis, tunc caue a neruis qui sunt sub ea super faciem pedis.	And if the phlebotomy is done on the face of the foot, then take care of the nerves which are under these and over the face of the foot
Et pone phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas ex transuerso, quasi tu uelis incidere eam: et sit phlebotomus Nesil.	And place your phlebotomy through from the cross, as if you wish to cut through it: and let the phlebotomy be of Nesil.
Si autem prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera pedem eius in aqua calida: et dimitte sanguinem currere in eam, donec euacuatur.	But if the blood is prohibited from coming out, then repeat the foot in the warm water: and let the blood run in the vein, until it is evacuated
Quod si errat uenam phlebotomator in prima uice, tunc iteret cum phlebotomia ad superiora parumper, nam locus est saluus, et non times ex eo maliciam, quando tu caues a neruis, sicut diximus.	And if the phlebotomist has erred in the first attempt, then repeat with the phlebotomy to the upper parts, for the place is safe, and not for that reason does it cause harm, when you cut the nerves, as we said.
Et similiter cum Saphena pedis alterius aequaliter.	And in like manner as the saphenous vein of the other foot is equally.
Venae autem Sciaticae locus, sicut diximus, est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	The sciatic vein is located at the heel on the outside of the ankle, as we have said.
Et iuuamentum phlebotomiae eius est, ad dolorem anchae, quando est propter sanguinem calidum.	Its sensation is to cause pain in the knee when there is thickened blood in it.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut ingrediatur infirmus balneum, et festinet: et stringe crus eius a latere anchae usque supra calcaneum quatuor digitis, cum uitta subtili longa: non enim apparet nisi propter illud.	Its quality is that it should be made with a soft bandage and should be hurried: and it should be bound around the leg from the ankle up to the heel with four fingers, and should be left on for a long time. It will not be seen except for this.
Quando ergo apparet, tunc phlebotoma eam secundum quodcumque ingenium est tibi possibile, aut secundum transuersionem: et est melius, aut ut incidas eam incisione, aut seces eam sectione.	When it appears, then the vein must be cut according to any expedient means which are possible, or by stripping: and it is better either to cauterize it with a burn or to cut it through with a section
Locus enim eius est saluior, et ipsa est in pluribus hominibus occulta ualde.	Its place is safer, and it is often hidden in many people.
Quod si non inuenis eam, et non apparet sensui omnino: tunc phlebotoma aliquem ramum eius, et est ille qui apparet in dorso pedis, et uersus auricularem: et caue a neruis, et fac currere ex sanguine quantitatem quam uis.	If you do not find it and do not perceive it at all: then cut some branch of it, that which appears in the back of the foot and below the heel: and cauterize from the nerves, and let the blood flow out as much as you wish
Deinde solue stricturam, et pone super locum phlebotomiae corium, et stringe locum.	Then loosen the ligature, and place over the place of the phlebotomy some skin, and bind the place.
Uelociter enim sanatur.	It will soon heal.
¶ De Ventosatione, et qualitate usus eius.	Note: The provided text continues beyond this section, but the instructions are in a different language and are not included here.
Caput XCVIII.	Chapter 103.</start_of_turn>
Uentosae fiunt ex cornibus, et ex aere, et ex uitro.	The humors arise from the bones, and from the air, and from the spleen.
Et Ventosatio quidem fit secundum duos modos.	There are two kinds of ventilation
Cum scarificatione, et extractione sanguinis: et alter est uentosatio sine scarificatione.	When there is scarification and bloodletting, the other is [treatment] without scarification.
Et haec Ventosatio quae est sine scarificatione, est secundum duos modos.	And this treatment without scarification is according to two methods.
Aut enim est cum igne.	Or it is with oil.
Aut est absque igne.	Or it is without fire
Et uentosis quae administrantur cum scarificatione et extractione sanguinis sunt quatuordecim loca corporis.	And the treatments which are administered with scarification and bloodletting are fourteen in number throughout the body
Quorum unus est, Ventosatio Alnocrati, et est postremum capitis: et Alkehel, et est medium colli: et uentosae Alhagdahim, et sunt duae laminae colli a duabus partibus simul: et uentosae menti, et est sub mandibula in inferiori oris: et uentosae duarum spatularum: et uentosae Alachosos super finem caudae: et uentosae duorum focilium, et sunt medium duorum brachiorum: et uentosae duorum crurium: et uentosae duarum cauillarum.	These latter four are of the head and neck: Aloe is applied to the back of the head: Alkhel to the middle of the neck: the two Alhagdahim are for the two layers of the neck from two parts together: Ment is for under the jaw at the lower part of the mouth: Alachosos is for between the two angles of the jaw: the two Focus are for the middle of the two arms: the two Crura for the two wrists: and the two Caudae for the two ankles
Et Ventosatio quidem non extrahit sanguinem tibi ex uenis minutis sparsis in carne, et propter illud non cadit uirtus ex eis, sicut est casus eius ex phlebotomia.	And indeed the treatment does not draw out blood from many small veins throughout the flesh, but because of this it does not cause loss of blood, as is the case with phlebotomy.
Neque oportet, ut administretur uentosatio siue cum igne, aut absque igne in aliqua aegritudinum quae fiunt ex repletione, donec euacuetur totum corpus.	Neither is it necessary to administer treatment with fire or without fire in any ailment which arises from congestion, until the whole body has been evacuated.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad Ventosationem ex aegritudine, aut propter consuetudinem, administramus eam in omni hora in principio mensis, in fine eius, et in medio ipsius, et in quocumque tempore fuerit.	If necessity demands, we administer it at every hour at the beginning, at the end, and in the middle of the month, and at any other time if necessary
Quod est, quia ex hominibus est qui quando multiplicatur in eo sanguis, donec indiget extractione eius per uentosationem, inuenit in capite suo grauedinem, et sodahan.	For in men, when there is an increase in blood in this way, until it requires extraction by treatment, it acquires great weight in the head and becomes harmful
Et ex eis est qui inuenit repletionem et rubedinem in facie sua, capite suo, et collo suo.	And from this is that which causes congestion and redness of the face, head and neck
Et ex eis est qui inuenit pruritum in facie sua, et fronte sua, et tenebrositatem, et hebetudinem in oculis suis.	And from the eye there is that which causes itching in the face, and the front of the face, and shadows, and dullness in the eyes.
Et ex eis est qui scalpit locum uentosationis suae.	And from the eye there is that which severs the seat of its moisture.
Et ex eis est cuius risus multiplicatur.	And from the eye there is that which causes laughter to be multiplied
Et ex eis est qui inuenit gustum sanguinis in ore suo: aut apostematur lingua, et expuit sanguinem.	And from the eye there is that which causes the taste of blood in the mouth: either the tongue swells up and expels blood
Et ex eis est cuius somnus multiplicatur.	And from the eye there is that which causes sleep to be multiplied
Et ex eis est qui uidet in somno suo sanguinem et rubedinem, et interfectos, et plagas, et quae sunt similia illis.	And from the eye there is that which causes vomiting of blood and redness, and discharge, and spots, and things which are similar to these.
Quando ergo uidemus aliquid ex illis, et proprie si est in tertia media mensis: praecipimus tunc uentosationem fieri, postquam praeterierunt de die duae horae, aut tres.	When we see anything of these things, and especially if it has been more than two or three days since the last: we then order that the moisture be removed, after two or three hours have passed by
Iuuamentum autem Ventosationis nuchae, est: quoniam ipsa confert ad grauitatem in capite, et quod effunditur ad oculos.	The ointment of the night is thus: because it itself causes an excess of weight in the head, and what flows down to the eyes.
At uero oportet, ut sit illud post euacuationem totius corporis.	And indeed it is proper that it should be after the evacuation of the whole body.
Et haec quidem Ventosa est loco phlebotomiae Cephalicae.	These things are a kind of phlebotomy of the head.
Et non licet, ut utatur ea qui est frigidae complexionis, aut in quo est catarrus.	It is not permitted to use these things by those who are of a cold complexion, or in whom there is a catarrh.
Nam infert ei nocumentum magnum.	For it brings on a great discomfort
Et propter illud non oportet, ut utantur ea senes, et in cuius capite sunt aegritudines frigidae.	And because of this it is not permitted to use these things for the elderly, and in whom there are cold spots in the head
Qui autem super eam fit assiduus, generatur super eum obliuio.	Whoever however uses it excessively will generate on him an aversion
Et propter illud oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut deponat manum suam cum uentosa parumper ad inferiora, timendo ex generatione obliuionis.	And therefore it is necessary, as the Master of Winds has said, to place the hand with the palm downwards near the lower parts, fearing lest from the generation of oblivion.
Ventosatio aut Alkehel, est loco phlebotomiae Fuscae, et phlebotomiae Basilicae, et propter illud confert asmati, et constrictioni anhelitus, et fissurae instrumenti anhelitus, et tussi, et repletioni.	The Master of Winds or Alkehel is the place of phlebotomy of the vein of the Fusca, and of the vein of the Basilica, and because of this it causes swelling, constriction of the breath, and pain in the instruments of the breath, and coughing, and distension.
Et oportet, ut impellatur Ventosa Alkehel parumper, quoniam si ponitur inferius, generat debilitatem in corde, et stomacho.	It is necessary to urge the Master of the Winds downwards, because if it is placed downwards, it generates weakness in the heart and the stomach
Ventosatio uero alhagdahim, confert doloribus accidentibus in capite, et obtalmiae, et hemigraneae, et perforationi, et dolori in radicibus dentium: et est loco phlebotomiae Basilicae.	The Master of the Winds or al-haggadah causes headaches, vomiting, swelling of the temples, dizziness, perforation, and pain in the roots of the teeth: and is the place of phlebotomy of the Basilica.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne premat manum suam cum scarificatione: ut non incidat arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And it is necessary, as the Master of Winds has said, to keep the hand away from the scarification: that it does not cut the artery and cause the flow of blood to be obstructed.
Ventosatio autem sub mento, confert alcolae in ore, et corruptioni gingiuae, et similibus eis ex aegritudinibus quae sunt in ore: et stat loco phlebotomiae alieherich, quae sunt in duobus labiis.	The Master of the Winds placed under the chin causes nausea in the mouth, corruption of the gums, and similar ailments that are in the mouth: and is the place of phlebotomy of the two lower teeth
Ventosatio autem spatularum, confert ad alchafacham, quae fit ex replexione, et caliditate.	The Master of the Winds of the spatulas causes swelling of the face, which is produced by reflection and heat.
Ventosatio uero interiorum partium duorum focilium, confert iuuamentum phlebotomiae uenarum trium, Basilicae, et Fuscae, et Cephalicae: quoniam ipsa attrahit sanguinem ex omnibus illis uenis minutis, quae sunt in carne: et attrahunt illae uenae minutae ex uenis aliis grossioribus eis, donec peruenit attractio ad uenas tres.	The Master of the Winds of the inner parts of the two cavities [chest and abdomen] causes the drawing together of the veins of the veins of the three ventricles, Basilica, Fusca, and Cephalic: because it attracts blood from all these small veins that are in the flesh: and these small veins are attracted from other large veins until the attraction reaches the three veins.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne multum procedat in scarificatione: quoniam locus est denudatus carne, et sub eo sunt nerui et arteriae.	The windsore must take care, in performing the scarification, not to go too deep: for in this place is the flesh stripped away, and beneath it are nerves and blood vessels.
Ventosa autem quae uentosatur super alchausos, confert hemorroidibus Ani, et ulceribus inferioribus.	The windsore which occurs on the buttocks causes haemorrhoids to the anus and lower ulcers.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut sit uentosa magna, et ut sit ex aere: quoniam locus indiget suctione forti, et fortasse franguntur Ventosae subtiles: et scarificetur scarificatione magna.	The windsore must take care, that it be large and open to the air: for in this place requires strong suction, and perhaps the fine windsours will be broken: and the scarification must be made with a large incision
Ventosae autem crurium minuunt diminutione manifesta: quoniam attrahunt sanguinem ex toto corpore, et conferunt doloribus antiquis in renibus, et matricibus, et uesica: prouocant menstrua, et conferunt bothor, et ademenul: et stant loco phlebotomiae duarum saphenarum, et alhorcobeni.	The windsore of the buttocks diminishes by becoming small: for it draws blood from the whole body, and causes old pains in the loin, and the groin, and the genitals: it brings on menstruation, and causes swelling and softening: and it stands in the place of two saphenous veins, and the testicles
Verumtamen debilitant corpus multum, et faciunt accidere syncopim in pluribus hominibus.	It is true that it weakens the body a great deal, and causes fainting in many men.
Et Ventosarum alhorcobeni iuuamentum est propinquum iuuamento Ventosarum duorum crurium.	The testicles are close to the two veins of the buttocks.
Qualitas positionis Ventosarum est, ut ponas uentosam in primis uacuam, et sugas suctione temperata: et non prolonges positionem uentosarum, sed pone eas uelociter, et remoue eas uelociter, ut ueniant humores ad locum aduentu aequali: et non cesses iterare illud et continuare, donec uideas locum iam rubere et inflari, et appareat rubedo sanguinis: tunc ergo scarifica, et itera suctione paulatim.	The position of the windsours is such, that you must place the major incision in the beginning of the wound, and call for a temperate suction: and do not prolong the position of the incision, but put things quickly and easily, so that the humours may reach the place in an even manner: and do not cease doing this until the place is red and swollen, and blood appears red: then indeed scarify, and repeat the suction gradually.
Deinde considera in dispositione corporum.	Consider then the position of the body.
Nam qui ex hominibus est tenerae carnis, rarorum pororum, oportet ut scarifices ipsum semel, non plus: ut non ulceretur locus.	For one who has a lean body and few hairs, it is enough to make the incision once, not more: as not to ulcerate the place.
Et praecipe Ventosatori, ut amplificet scarificationem, et profundet parum: et temperet suctionem in facilitate, et uelocitate, et motu suaui.	Command the wind-blower to strengthen the incision, and deepen it slightly: and temper the suction to facilitate, speed, and the movement of the instrument.
Quod si in sanguine est grossitudo, tunc oportet, ut scarifices ipsum bis.	If there is any thickness in the blood, it is necessary to repeat the incision twice
In uice quidem prima aperitur uia subtiliationi sanguinis, et aquositati eius: et in secunda quidem perscrutationi exquisitae extractionis sanguinis grossi.	In the first incision, make a small opening under the blood vessel, and wash out the blood: and in the second incision, make an accurate incision for the extraction of the thick blood.
Si uero sanguis est faeculentus ualde, tunc fiat scarificatio uice tertia: ut consequatur ultimum.	If the blood is dark and foul, make a third incision: in order to achieve the ultimate goal
Et ad ultimum, quando uolumus extrahere sanguinem paulatim, uel parumper, sufficit nobis scarificatio una.	Finally, when we wish to extract the blood slowly or in small amounts, one incision is sufficient.
Quod si uolumus extractionem sanguinis multi, scarificamus scarificatione plurima.	If we wish to extract a large amount of blood, we make several incisions
Et si nos mensuramus, quod sanguis est grossus: tunc oportet, ut scarificetur scarificatione profunda: et terminus aequalis in scarificatione, est profunditas cutis.	If we are measuring, that the blood is thick: then it is necessary to make a deep incision: and the endpoint of the incision is the depth of the skin
¶ Quid sit illud quod oportet administrari ex oleis apud positionem Ventosarum, et quid caueat uentosandus.	What should be administered from the oils at the position of the wind-blowers, and what is the cause of the wind-blower?
IN illo quidem cuius cutis est grossa, dura, fusca, et pori eius sunt stricti, oportet ut ungantur loca Ventosare cum oleis apertiuis, lenitiuis, resolutiuis: si est in tempore aestatis, sicut est oleum alkeiri, aut oleum uiolatum, aut oleum de amigdalis dulcibus, aut oleum de semine cucurbitae.	In those parts where the skin is thick, hard, rough, and its pores are narrow, it is necessary to anoint the area of the wind-blower with open, soothing, resolving oils: if it is in summer, such as almond oil, or walnut oil, or sweet fennel oil, or cucumber seed oil
Et si est in tempore hyemis, tunc oleum narcissinum, aut oleum de lilio, aut oleum camomellinum, aut sarbatinum: et eis similia.	And if it is in winter, then narcissus oil, or lily oil, or camomile oil, or beeswax: and similar things.
Si uero superfluitas est grossa, frigida: tunc oleum sit amaracinum, aut oleum de balsamita aut oleum alben, aut oleum anetinum: et eis similia.	If there is excessive moisture, cold: then the oil should be bitter almond oil, or balsam oil, or white oil, or ivy oil: and similar things.
Si uero uentosandus est amplorum pororum, tenerae carnis: tunc oportet, ut prohibeatur ab oleo, et oportet ut isti abluant loca Ventosarum earum post uentosationem cum aqua rosata, aut cum aqua frigida, aut cum aqua solatri, aut cum aqua cucurbitae, aut cum aqua portulacae: et similibus eis.	If indeed the belly is full of wind, take meat: then it is necessary that it be obstructed from the outside, and that it be washed away from the veins of the belly after the operation with rose-water, or cold water, or salt-water, or cucumber-water, or water of the pomegranate: and in like manner.
Ille autem cuius sanguis est multae humiditatis, abluat uentosas cum aceto, aut cum aqua myrti, et sumach: et similibus eis.	If indeed the belly is full of wind, take meat: then it is necessary that it be obstructed from the outside, and that it be washed away from the veins of the belly after the operation with vinegar, or myrrh, and alum: and in like manner.
Cuius autem superfluitates sunt grossae, abluat uentosas suas cum uino antiquo, aut cum aqua samsuci, aut decoctione aneti, aut camomillae: et eis similibus.	If indeed the belly is full of wind, take meat: then it is necessary that it be obstructed from the outside, and that it be washed away from the veins of the belly after the operation with old wine, or chamomile tea, or fennel decoction, or camomile: and in like manner.
Et oportet, ut caueatur uentosatio in balneo, aut in uestigio balnei, imo oportet, ut administretur post exitum ex balneo per horam, aut per horas duas.	And it is necessary that the operation be delayed in a bath, or in a basin of the bath, and indeed it is necessary that it be administered after leaving the bath for an hour, or two hours.
Et non oportet, ut dormiat aliquis post uentosationem.	And it is not necessary that anyone should sleep after the operation.
¶ Quid est quo oportet ut regatur Ventosandus, aut Phlebotomatus ante uentosationem.	What is necessary that the wind be regulated, or that the vein be opened before the operation?
ET post eam oportet, ut consideres in primis: tunc si Ventosatus, aut Phlebotomatus sit cholericus, et uincunt super sanguinem eius acuitas et inflammatio: tunc oportet, ut accipiat infrigidantia, sicut granatum muzum: et etiam endiuiam cum aceto et lactuca, et secaniabin, et iuleb: et eis similia.	And after that it is necessary to consider in the first place: then if the wind or the vein is choleric, and its blood is hot and inflamed: then it is necessary that it take coolness, such as pomegranate seed: and also garlic with vinegar and lettuce, and rue, and chamomile: and such like things.
Et pone cibaria eius pullos, et carnes ouium sekebiget, et cibos conditos cum agresta: et eis similia.	And put over its food chickens, and fat meats cooked dry, and foods cooked with rue: and such like things.
Et cuius complexio est frigida, oportet ut sumat in potu syrupum de melle, aut de almiua, aut alsecaniabin de seminibus factum: et sumat uinum odoriferum medium, quod est inter uetus et nouum: et praecipiatur, ut utatur paucitate cibi.	And whose complexion is cold, it is necessary that he take in drink honey syrup, or of almonds, or mastic-resin made of seeds: and take medium-strength wine, which is between new and old wine: and it is recommended that he abstain from food little.</start_of_turn>
Et pone cibum eius pullos, et canebir: et passeres, id est, paruas aues: et pullos columborum issiadebet.	And put its food in the beaks of doves, and dogs: and sparrows, that is, finches: and the young of doves must be put on the sand.
Et oportet, ut potus die uentosationis et phlebotomiae plus sit quam cibus: et oportet, ut detur in potu in quibusdam hominibus in horis tyriaca alfaroch, aut medicamen de musco, id est, muscata, aut alesselithe ante uentosationem: et ante phlebotomiam, aut post: ut confortentur membra principalia, et subtilietur sanguis.	And it is necessary that liquid be taken more frequently than food after vomiting and bleeding: and it is necessary that it be given in liquid in some men in the twilight hours of the calf hours, or medicine of musk, that is, muskroot, or alehoof before vomiting: and before bleeding, or afterwards: in order to comfort the principal parts and temper the blood.
Et non oportet, ut sumant eam in potu calefacto.	And it is not necessary that they take warm things in liquid.
¶ De Ventosis sine scarificatione.	Of Vomiting without Scarification.
Uentosae autem quae sunt sine scarificatione, sunt Ventosae quae ponuntur super epar, et splenem, et podagram, et super uentrem, umbilicum, et loca renum, et pixidem anchae: quoniam ista membra non sufferunt scarificationem super se.	And those vomits which are without scarification are those which arise above the spleen, and the belly, and the heel, and above the stomach, the navel, and the root of the kidney: because these members do not suffer scarification over themselves
Et non quaeritur per eas, nisi aut attactio ex membro sanguinis ad membrum: sicut ponimus Ventosam super mammillas in aegritudine fluxus sanguinis narium.	And it is not necessary to search for it easily, except when there is an attack from a member of blood to a member: as we do with vomiting over the nipples in the flux of blood of the cat
Et utimur eis, ut soluamus a membro uentositatem frigidam inuiscatam in membro: sicut ponimus uentosam super uentrem, et umbilicum.	And we must be cautious lest we make the vomit cold by applying it to a cold member: as we do with vomiting over the stomach and the navel.
Ipsa enim rarificat membrum, et calefacit ipsum, et remouet dolorem propterea, quia resoluit illam uentositatem.	For itself it rarefies the member, and heats it, and removes the pain thereby, because it resolves the said vomiting.
Etiam ponitur super renes, quando accidit in eis opilatio, aut lapis.	It is also placed over the kidneys, when it happens in oil, or urine.
Uirtute enim attractionis suae fortasse aperit opilationem, aut eradicat lapidem ex loco suo.	For the urine has a powerful attraction and perhaps opens the inflammation, or eliminates the stone from its place.
Et similiter facit quando ponitur super epar, et splenem apud uentositatem terendam in eis utrisque.	And in the same way it does when it is placed over the spleen and the belly at the vomiting of the two.
Et istae Ventosae administrantur uacuae cum sectione tantum.	These wounds are treated with oil and vinegar as well as by section only.
Et quandoque administrantur cum igne.	When necessary, they are also administered with fire.
Et quandoque administrantur plenae aqua tepida in aegritudinibus pleuresis: et illud est, ut impleatur Ventosa, et sit magna, aqua calida sola, aut aqua in qua decoctae sint herbae quae conueniunt.	When necessary, they are also administered with warm water in blisters: and this is done by applying Ventosa, which should be large, solely with warm water, or with water in which herbs that agree have been boiled are dissolved
¶ Forma Ventosae administratae cum igne.	The form of Ventosa administered with fire
Sit amplitudo orificii eius duorum digitorum apertorum, secundum quod formauimus: et quantitas eius in profundo sit medietas palmi: et sit in latere eius in loco qui est circiter medium eius, foramen paruum, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum acus: fiat ex aere simul, aut citrino, grossorum marginum, lenium, aequalium, tersorum: ut non laedat membrum apud positionem suam super ipsum: et sit in medio eius uirga transuersa ex aere, aut ferro, ubi ponitur candela cum igne.	Its breadth is two open fingers, as we have formed it: and its depth is half of a palm, and its width on the side is in the middle of it, with a small hole in the middle, according to the quantity of the needle: it is made of air, or citrine, of coarse borders, soft, equal, smooth: so that it does not harm the limb in its position above it: and in the middle of it is a transverse wire of air or iron, on which a candle is placed with fire.
Et iam fit haec uentosa magna, maior ea quam narrauimus, et parum minor illa, secundum aegritudines et aetatem eius qui utitur.	And this is made of large Ventosa, greater than we have mentioned, and somewhat smaller than that, according to the age and condition of the patient who uses it
Ventosae enim puerorum, et extenuatorum sunt aliae, quam uentosae uirorum, et grossorum corporum.	For children, and for extenuators, other forms of Ventosa are better than those for adults, and for the great of body.
Qualitas autem ponendi hanc uentosam cum igne super membrum, est, ut accendas licinium cum igne ex lino decenter, aut candelam paruam ex caera: et pone eam super medium uirgae transuersae quae est in medio uentosae: ut sit accensus ignis circiter inferiorem partem uentosae, ut non comburatur corpus infirmi.	The quality of applying this Ventosa with fire to the limb is that you should raise the ignited lint from below the center, or put out a candle from the earthenware: and put it on the middle of the transverse wire which is in the middle of the Ventosa: so that the fire is surrounded below the lower part of the Ventosa, so that the limb is not burned
Deinde ponatur super membrum: et digitus sit super foramen quod dixi, donec quando tenemus uentosam: dum indigemus, auferamus digitum, et egredietur uapor super illud foramen, et soluetur uentosa statim.	Then put it on the limb: and the finger should be over the hole which I mentioned, until the Ventosa is tensed: while we are holding it, we remove the finger, and the vapor rises from that hole, and the Ventosa is dissolved immediately
Deinde igni licinium secundum modum suum, et itera eam, si indiges illa.	Then let the fire be kindled according to its manner, and do it again if it proves insufficient.
In Ventosa autem quae administratur in aegritudine pleuresis cum aqua, non est uirga transuersa, neque foramen: et non administratur, nisi quia impletur aqua, et ponitur super membrum tantum.	However, in the case of Ventosa administered in the treatment of pleurisis with water, no foreign body should be introduced transversely, nor a hole made: it should only be administered when the cavity is filled with water and placed only over the part affected
Et haec est forma eius.	This is its form.
Et haec Ventosa quanto plus est magna, ut capiat aquam multam, est melior.	The greater the quantity of Ventosa, the more it will absorb the water
¶ De suspensione Sanguisugarum.	About the suspension of blood-sugar.
Caput XCIX.	Chapter XCIX.
Sanguisugae non administrantur in pluribus, nisi in quibus membris non est possibilis positio uentosarum, propter paruitatem eorum, sicut labium, et gingiua, et eis similia.	Blood-sugar is not administered in multiple places, except in those parts where it is not possible to place the instruments, because of their smallness, such as the lips and tongue, and things of a similar nature.
Aut in membro denudato a carne, sicut digitus, et nasus, et eis similia.	Or on a bare part of the body, such as a finger or the nose, and things of a similar nature.
Et qualitas utendi eis est: ut ueneris ex Sanguisugis quae sunt in aquis dulcibus, mundis a putredinibus.	And the quality of the instrument is this: that it should be taken from blood-sugar which is in sweet water, freed from putrefaction.
Deinde dimittantur die et nocte in aqua dulci, donec famelicae sint, et non remaneat in uentre earum aliquid.	Then they are discharged day and night into sweet water, until the inflammation has subsided, and nothing remains in their midst
Deinde euacuetur corpus in primis cum phlebotomia, et cum uentosis.	Then the body is evacuated immediately with phlebotomy and with instruments.
Deinde absterge membrum infirmi, donec rubeat.	Then cleanse the affected part, until it turns red
Postea ponantur super ipsum.	Then the dressing is placed over it
Cum ergo implentur, et cadunt, et est possibilis suctio loci cum uentosa, tunc est magis ultimum in iuuamento: et si non, tunc ablue locum cum aceto.	When they are done, and they have fallen off, and it is possible to suck out the place with an instrument, then this is the best method: and if this is not possible, then remove the place with vinegar
Deinde cum aqua multa, et fricetur, et exprimatur.	Then when there is much water, and the wound is inflamed, and is squeezed out.
Quod si prolongatur cursus sanguinis post casum Sanguisugarum, et est illud resudando: tunc infunde pannum lini in aqua frigida, et pone ipsum desuper, donec abscindatur resudatio.	When the course of the blood is prolonged after the fall of the blood-vessels, and it is that which is oozing out: then pour a bandage of linen into cold water, and place it upon it, until the oozing ceases.
Quod si multiplicatur sanguis, tunc pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, aut gallas, et similia eis ex stipticis: donec abscindatur sanguis.	When there is much blood, then sprinkle upon it some powdered alum or gall, and similar things from the sponges: until the bleeding ceases.
Aut ponantur super locum medietates fabarum excorticatarum: et dimittantur, donec adhaereant fabae in loco, nam sanguis abscinditur.	Or place upon the place middle substances of scraped sponges: and draw them away, until the cloths adhere to the place, for the blood will cease to flow.
Et oportet si necessaria est iteratio Sanguisugarum, quando est possibile, mutare eas.	And it is necessary if necessary to repeat the evacuation of the blood-vessels, when it is possible, to change these easily.
Si autem prohibentur Sanguisugae a suspensione, tunc abstergatur locus cum sanguine recenti.	If however the evacuation of the blood-vessels is forbidden from suspension, then drain the place with fresh blood.</start_of_turn>
Aut fige acum in locis, donec egrediatur aliquid ex sanguine.	Or keep the sponge in the place, until something escapes from the blood.</start_of_turn>
Deinde ponantur, nam ipsae quando sentiunt aliquid ex sanguine, adhaerent statim.	Then pour on it, for these also when they feel something from the blood, adhere immediately.</start_of_turn>
Quando ergo uis ut cadant, pulueriza super eas aliquid ex aloe trito, aut salem, aut cinerem: et cadent statim.	When therefore you wish that they should fall, sprinkle upon them something from aloe which is ground fine, or salt, or ash: and they will fall immediately.</start_of_turn

Caput I.	Chapter I.</start_of_turn
Hoc Capitulum etiam multotiens est necessarium in arte Medicinae, et est restauratio fracturae, et dislocationis accidentium in ossibus.	This chapter is also very necessary in the art of Medicine, and is the restoration of fracture, and dislocation of the accidents in bones.</start_of_turn
Scitote o Filii, quia iactant se de hoc Capitulo stolidi medicorum et uulgi, et qui non inspexerunt unquam antiquorum librum, neque legerunt ex eo literam.	Know ye, sons, that they who play with this book of the stolid arts of the physicians and of magic, and who have never once perused an ancient book, nor learned anything from it by letter, are like children playing with a broken toy.
Et propter hanc caussam fit, quod iste modus ex scientiis in terra nostra est priuatus.	For this reason it is that this manner of learning is shut off in our land
Et ego non obuiaui in eo unquam bono omnino, et non adeptus sum ex eo illud, quod sum adeptus nisi propter longitudinem lectionis librorum antiquorum, et studium super intellectum eorum, donec extraxi scientiam illius ex eis.	I have learned nothing good from it at all, and I am not skilled in it except by the length of reading ancient books, and the study of their intellect, until I have extracted science from their words
Deinde adhaesi experimento et studio longitudine uitae meae.	Then I adhere to experience and the length of my life.
Et iam descripsi uobis ex illo in hoc Capitulo totum quod continet scientia mea: et super quod praeteriit experimentum meum, postquam abbreuiaui illud uobis, et liberaui illud ex occupatione elongationis, et abbreuiaui illud fine abbreuiationis, et ostendi illud fine declinationis: et formaui in eo formas multas ex formis instrumentorum quae administrantur in eo, cum sit ex additione declinationis, sicut feci in duobus Capitulis praecedentibus.	And I have described all that pertains to science in this chapter: and beyond what I have experienced, after I have abridged it for you, and I have set it down in a concise form, and I have abandoned it for the sake of brevity: and I have invented many forms of instruments which are used in this art, following the manner of the two preceding chapters
¶ Summae, et collectiones ex esse fracturae ossium, ex eis quarum praemissio necessaria est, antequam incipiamus rememorationem membrorum fractorum, et diuersorum, si uniuscuiusque.	In summary, and in the collecting together of the essence of broken bones, that which is necessary before we begin the enumeration of the fractured and diverse members, if indeed of any.
Caput II.	Chapter Two.
Oportet, ut dicamus in prologo huius Capituli, summas sermonis, et capitula, ad quarum intellectum cogitur in primis artifex ad stationem super earum ueritatem: scilicet ut uos, et qui sunt prompti, sciant, uel addiscant hanc artem nobilem, et alii a uobis.	It is necessary, as we said in the prologue to this chapter, to recall the summaries and chapters which are necessary for the understanding of the first artist at the beginning of this work: namely, that you and those who are familiar with it should know, or learn, or both, that this noble art contains many things which are beyond your knowledge.
Dico, ergo, quod quando accidit alicui fractura, aut dislocatio, aut torsio, aut casus: tunc oportet, ut properes in primis ad phlebotomandum eum, et soluendum ipsum, aut utraque simul: si non prohibeat aliquid, sicut debilitas uirtutis: aut est ille cui accidit aliquid ex illis puer, aut senex decrepitus: aut est tempus uehementis caloris, aut uehementis frigoris ualde.	I say, therefore, when any fracture, dislocation, twist, or case occurs: then it is necessary at first to apply pressure to the wound and to bind up the limb, or both together: if nothing else hinders, such as weakness of the limb: or that the patient is young and vigorous: or that the accident happened in a place where there is heat; or in a place where there is cold.
Deinde sit contentus in cibo suo, oleribus frigidis, et carnibus auium, et haedorum: et prohibe uinum, et carnes grossas, et repleri ex cibis et omni cibo qui replet uenas sanguine.	Then let him be content with his food, with cold fruits, and with birds' flesh, and with blood: and let him abstain from wine, and from coarse meats, and restore himself from food and from every food which fills the veins.
Donec quando securus sis ex apostemate calido, et non times effusionem materiei ad membrum: tunc redeat infirmus ad regimen suum primum cum quo cucurrit consuetudo eius.	When he is recovered from the heat of the after-disease, and no longer has any discharge from the matter to the limb: then let the patient return to his first regimen when he goes about his ordinary business.
Cum ergo incipit os fractum restaurari, tunc oportet, ut cibetur infirmus cibis nutrientibus nutrimento multo, grosso, graui, in quibus sit uiscositas: sicut cibaria facta ex tritico cocto cum aqua, et rizum, et capita, et pedes, et uentres uaccarum, et oua, et pisces recentes: et uinum grossum, et similia illis.	When the bone is beginning to recover, then it is necessary that the patient should eat nourishing and bulky food, such as barley bread boiled with water, gruel, heads, feet, walnuts, eggs, fish, and fresh wine: and strong drink like these things
Cum hoc enim regimine fit coagulatio fracturae uelocius, et melius.	With this regimen the fracture will coagulate more quickly and better
Et scias, quod ossa fracta, quando sunt in uiris qui sunt in prima senectute, et decrepitis, non est possibile, ut continuentur et consolidentur secundum naturam suam semper, propter exiccationem membrorum eorum: et consolidantur et continuantur quae ex eis sunt in fine lenitatis, sicut ossa puerornm paruorum.	And you know that a fractured bone, when it is in the parts which are in their first old age, and decrepit, it is not possible that it should continue and consolidate according to its natural course, because of the drying out of the parts: and it consolidates and continues only what is in the end of softness, like the bones of the newborn lambs
Verumtamen natura annectit super os fractum ex omni parte aliquid simile glutino, in quo est grossitudo, quo adhaeret et stringit ipsum, donec conglutinantur adinuicem, et ligantur adinuicem, donec uenit in fine fortitudinis et firmitudinis, sicut fuit in primis, donec non prohibet ipsum aliquid ab operationibus suis: et propter hanc caussam est necesse, ut ponas nutrimentum infirmi cibaria, in quibus sunt grauitas, et uiscositas, et grossitudo, sicut diximus.	But nature adds upon the fractured bone from every side something like glue, which has greatness, with which it adheres and binds it, until it is congealed together, and is bound together: until it comes in the end to strength and firmness, like it was in the beginning, without hindering it by any of its operations: and for this reason it is necessary that you should give the patient nourishing food, which has greatness, viscosity, and size, as we have said
Et scias, quod fracturae species sunt diuersae, secundum diuersitatem membrorum: quoniam fractura cruris, est diuersa a fractura ossis capitis: et fractura ossis pectoris, est diuersa a fractura ossis dorsi: et similiter reliqua membra omnia diuersa existunt adinuicem: et ego ueni cum rememoratione omnis speciei fracturae expositae in Capitulo suo distinctae ab alia.	And you know that there are various kinds of fractures, according to the diversity of the limbs: for instance, a fracture of the leg is different from a fracture of the head: and a fracture of the breastbone is different from a fracture of the backbone: and so on all the other limbs exist in a different way: and I come with the remembrance of the various kinds of fractures which are exposed in his Chapter distinguished from each other.
Et diuersificantur species fracturae ossis etiam in seipsa.	Diverse forms of bone fracture also occur within the limb itself.
Quoniam fit fractura eius arcuata, praeter quod accidant in ea astellae.	Since it is arched in this limb, fractures often happen in the joints there.
Et quandoque fit fractura eius secundum longitudinem ossis: et sunt fracturae eius satagiae, id est, astellae, et additiones procedentes, sicut sunt in calamo, cum aptatur cultello ad scribendum.	When it fractures through the length of the bone: these are called 'fracture of the limb', that is, joint-related, as in the thumb, when the scapel is applied for writing purposes.</start_of_turn>
Et non procedentes: et est fractura cum uulnere et disruptione in capite: et est fractura fissura parua.	These are not the only types: there is also fracture with wound and disruption at the head: this is a small crack.</start_of_turn
Et omni speciei est ingenium, uel instrumentum proprium in restauratione eius, secundum quod ueniet rememoratio eius, distincta in locis suis.	Every kind has its own nature, or its own instrument for restoration, according as the memory of each is recalled in its place.</start_of_turn
Et ex eo quo cognoscitur fractura ossis, est tortuositas eius, et ipsius eminentia: et apparitio eius sensui, et sonitus eius quando comprimis ipsum manu tua.	From this one can recognize the fracture of the bone, its swelling, its prominence: and its appearance to the sense, and its sound when you compress it.</start_of_turn
Quando ergo non est in loco tortuositas apparens, neque sonitus apud tactum tuum cum tangis os cum agitatione, neque inuenit infirmus magnum dolorem: tunc non est illic fractura, imo possibile est, ut sit tortuositas, aut fissura parua: non ergo oportet, ut moueas ipsum cum manu et compressione omnino, imo pone super ipsum ex medicinis, quarum uenit rememoratio, post momentum illud quod conuenit loco: deinde stringatur strictura subtili.	When there is no apparent swelling or pain on touch, no great pain in the limb: then there is no fracture there, but possibly only swelling or a small crack. It is not necessary therefore to move or compress the limb completely, but rather to apply above it the remedies which the physician recalls having seen in that place: then the tightening should be done gently.</start_of_turn
Et scias, quod locus quando arcuatur, et scinditur in duo, praeter quod accidant in eo satagiae, uerumtamen remouetur omnis pars a compari sua: tunc oportet tibi, ut incipias ab hora tua ad rectificationem eius, aequando ipsum antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	Know that when the limb is arched and fractured in two, besides the joints, all the parts are loosened from their place. Therefore it is necessary for you to start immediately with the restoration of the limb, equating it before the swelling becomes established.</start_of_turn
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum, tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec quiescat apoestema.	If however swelling should set in, leave it for a few days until the swelling subsides.</start_of_turn
Deinde aequa ipsum secundum quemcunque modum potest ex lenitate et ingenio.	Then equally with any method whatsoever from lenity and ingenuity.
Et scias, quod restauratio eius, et ipsius aequatio, est facilior quam ossis, in quo accidunt satagiae.	Know that the restoration of it, and its equalization, is easier than the bones in which the satagiae occur.</start_of_turn>
Deinde stringe ipsum, secundum quod ueniet tibi rememoratio eius.	Then string it up, according to what you remember of it.</start_of_turn>
Si uero in osse sunt satagiae, tunc necessaria est extensio huius membri fracti ex duabus partibus, si manus sit, aut pes: aut cum manu tua, si membrum est paruum: aut cum duobus funibus, aut cum fune et manu.	If indeed in the bone are satagiae, then necessary is the extension of this fractured limb from two parts, if the hand be, or the foot: or with the hand, if the limb be small: or with two strings, or with string and hand.</start_of_turn
Et sit positio tua qua ponis membrum super locum aequalem, secundum figuram suam naturalem, donec quando extenduntur partes membri fracti: tunc conare, ut redire facias illas additiones omni ingenio, et secundum quemcunque modum potes in locis suis: et caue secundum fortitudinem tuam, ne accidat super infirmum per operationem tuam dolor, neque laesio: et conare secundum fortitudinem tuam, ut applices unum duorum ossium cum socio suo, secundum meliores formas.	And let your position be such as you place the limb in a place equal, according to its natural figure, until when the parts of the fractured limb are extended: then try, so that you make the additions with all ingenuity, and according to any method you can in the places: and be careful according to your strength, lest you cause greater pain or injury than the operation itself: and try according to your strength, that you apply one of the two bones with its mate, according to the better forms.</start_of_turn
Et oportet in illa hora, ut tentes et tangas ipsum manu tua.	And it is necessary in this hour to test and touch your hand.</start_of_turn
Si ergo uides illic aliquid diuersum, rectifica ipsum, et aequa illud per quantitatem tuae uirtutis.	If therefore you see anything different there, correct it, and equalize it for the quantity of your virtue.</start_of_turn
Et caue extensionem uehementem, et compressionem fortem, sicut faciunt multi stolidorum.	And be careful of excessive extension and compression, as do many soliders.</start_of_turn
Multotiens enim faciunt accidere per operationem illam suam apostema calidum, aut contractionem in membro: sicut iam uidimus illud ex operationibus eorum multotiens.	Many indeed do thus cause their wound to become colder, or contraction in the limb: as we have seen this from their operations many times.</start_of_turn
Deinde annecte post aequationem, et decentem operationem, et stricturam illius membri, et quietem, et tranquillitatem: et mone infirmum super ipsum.	Then bind up after equalization, and loosen the operation, and tighten that limb, and quiet, and tranquility: and monitor the patient above all.</start_of_turn
Et fac ipsum cauere, ne moueat ipsum in hora suarum uigiliarum, et somni sui apud reuolutionem suam, et agitationem suam, et apud egestionem suam, et omnes motus suos ultima uirtute sua.	And make him lie down, that he move not in the hour of his sleep, and that he rest his sleep with his revolution, and his agitation, and with his egestion, and with all his movements his last effort.
Et ut caueat, ne sit positio membri positio cum qua sequatur dolor.	And that he lie so that no limb be in a position which follows pain
Quod est, quia quando sentit in dispositione positionis membri dolorem, aut laesionem: tunc oportet, ut permutes ipsum ad dispositionem aliam ab illa cum qua non sentiat dolorem.	For when he feels pain in the position of a limb, or in a wound: then it is necessary to change it to another position from which he does not feel pain.
Et caue cum illo, ut sit positio eius illa aequalis, recta: ut non accidat in membro tortuositas, quando restauratur.	And make him lie so that his position be even and straight: that no bending of the limb occur when he is restored.
Et qualitas stricturae membri fracti est, secundum quod narro.	And as for the stiffness of the limb which is fractured, that is according to what is narrated.
Scias, quod membra fracta diuersificantur in paruitate sua, et eorum magnitudine, et ipsorum forma.	You know that fractured limbs are diverse in their parts, their magnitude, and their shapes
Quae ergo ex eis sunt parua, sicut brachium, et digitus, et focile, et similia eis, tunc oportet, ut sit inuolutio panni mollis, subtilis.	Which are small, such as the arm, the finger, the heel, and things of this kind: then it is necessary to make an overlap of soft and fine packing
Quae autem ex eis sunt grossa, sicut coxa, et crus, oportet ut sit in eis inuolutio lata, dura.	Which are great, such as the hip, and the thigh: then it is necessary to make an overlap of a broad and hard packing in the limb
Quoniam ligamentum latum, connectit membrum magnum, et stringit ipsum ab omni parte strictura aequali, ita quod non ingreditur ipsum macula.	Because the broad ligament connects the great limb and tightens it from all parts equally, so that it does not become swollen.
Deinde incipe post euacuationem tuam ab aequatione ponere linimentum conueniens ad illud, in stuppa leni super locum fracturae ipsius.	Then begin after your evacuation from this to put on a suitable ointment on the wound, in a soft cushion over the fractured place itself.
Deinde incipe inuoluere ligamentum super locum fracturae ipsius tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod meretur membrum: et stringe manum tuam parumper cum ligamento.	Then begin to wrap the ligament over the fractured place with three or four wraps, according as the limb requires: and tighten your hand firmly with the ligament.
Deinde uade cum eo ad partem superiorem a loco fracturae, et stringe minus quam fuit strictura tua, qua strinxisti locum fractum.	Then bind above the part towards the upper part from the fracture place, and tighten less than the tightening you made at the fracture place.
Deinde elonga te cum inuolutione a loco fracturae parumper, et mollifica stricturam paulatim, donec capias ex loco sano rem magnam.	Then draw upwards from the fracture place to the upper part, and soften the tightening gradually, until you have restored the great part from the healthy place.
Deinde accipe uittam aliam, et inuolue eam iterum super locum fractum inuolutionibus.	Then take hold of another thing and bind it once more over the fracture place with drawings.
Postea uade cum inuolutione ad partem inferiorem a fractura.	Then bind upwards from the fracture place to the lower part.
Et sit operatio tua in strictura inuolutionis, et mollificatione eius, secundum quod diximus in inuolutione prima superiore.	And let your operation be in the tightening of the drawing and its softening, as we said in the first drawing above
Deinde pone inter inuolutiones ex stuppa leni, aut panno, cum quo aequetur tortuositas fracturae, si est in ea tortuositas: et si non, non ponas in ea aliquid.	Then put between the drawings a soft wad or cloth, so that the fracture may be as straight as possible: and if there is no twist in it, do not put anything in it
Deinde inuolue super ipsam uittam aliam.	Then bind over the other thing again
Postea aequa super has inuolutiones astellas decenter factas statim, si non est in loco inflatio, neque apostema calidum.	Then make the upper drawing as even as the lower drawing, if there is no swelling in the place, nor any swelling of the limb.
Si autem in ea est inflatio, aut apostema: tunc pone super eam quod sedet illud apostema, et auferat inflationem: et dimitte eam aliquot diebus.	If however there is swelling in it, or swelling of the limb: then put over that which sits upon that swelling, and bring down the swelling: and leave it off for a few days.
Deinde stringe super ipsam tunc astellas.	Then tighten over that as well
Et sint Astellae ex medietatibus cannae latae, rasae, formatae sapienter: aut sint ex ligno unde fiunt cribra, quae fiunt ex pino, aut geraid, id est, ramis palmae, aut calingi: et sit amplitudo omnis Astellae, secundum hanc formam, et hanc eandem figuram.	And let the bands be of the middle of broad sticks, round, well-shaped: or they may be of wood from which cribra are made, which are made from a stick, or palm branch, or nail, that is, the branches of the palm or nails of the pine tree
Verumtamen oportet, ut Astella quae ponitur super ipsam tracturam, sit grossior et latior parumper, quam reliquae Astellae: et longitudo Astellae sit secundum quod licet membro ex magnitudine et paruitate.	Indeed it is necessary that the band which is placed over the tract be greater and wider on all sides than the rest of the bands: and the length of the band should be according to the size and position of the limb.
Deinde stringe super Astellas cum uitta alia, secundum stricturam primam eandem.	Then string over Astellas with the other, according to the first rule.
Deinde liga desuper cum filis decenter, secundum quod diximus de strictura: et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae plus: et quanto plus elongatur a fractura sit, strictura minor.	Then tighten over Astellas with the other, according to the first rule: and let it be more tightly bound over the fractured place: the more distant it is from the fracture, the less tight it should be
Et oportet, ut sint fila media in grossitudine et subtilitate, et sint ex lino molli.	And it is necessary that the intervening threads be of moderate size and pliability, and be of soft linen.
Quoniam si fila sunt grossa, sicut uidi ex operatione stolidorum ponentium fila sua ex chordis lini tortis, est error magnus: quoniam cadit strictura cum eis extra qualitatem.	For if the threads are thick, like the strings of a lute after a knotting of the guts, it is a great mistake: for the stricture will fall with the slightest excess.
Et fila subtilia iterum non conueniunt: quoniam tu non consequeris per stricturam cum eis illud quod uis.	Neither are the fine threads suitable: for you will not achieve the desired result by means of the stricture with them
Et non oportet, ut sit inter astellam et astellam minus quam digitus.	Neither must the distance between the Astellas be less than a finger width.
Quod si laeditur infirmus per extremitates astellarum post stricturam in locis sanis: tunc pone sub eis ex stuppa leni, aut lana carminata, donec nihil laedatur ex illo.	If the patient is painful between the Astellas after the stricture in healthy places: then put under the skin from the heel a cushion of soft wool or carded lanolin, until no pain remains from that.
Quando autem est fractura cum uulnere, et accidit disruptio in cute, ego ueniam cum rememoratione eius in capitulo secundum singularitatem.	When, however, there is a fracture with a wound, and there is a disruption in the skin, I will speak of it in the second chapter according to its singularity.
Et scias, quod non omne membrum fractum oportet ut stringatur cum astellis a primo die.	And know that not every fractured limb should be immediately bound with Astellas on the first day.
Quod est, quia membrum quando est magnum, non oportet ut ponas superipsum astellas, nisi post quinque dies, aut septem, aut plus, secundum securitatem tuam ab euentu apostematis calidi.	For when the limb is great, it is not necessary to bind it immediately with Astellas for more than five or seven or more days, according to your security about the progress of the wound
Et iste est modus emplastrorum, quibus restaurabant antiqui, quae ponuntur super fracturam et dislocationem.	And this is the manner of plastering which the ancient people used to restore fractures and dislocations
¶ Modus Emplastri communis abbreuiati, restaurans fracturam, conueniens pluribus complexionibus, praecipue mulieribus, et pueris: quoniam est ex eo super quod non uincit calor, neque frigus.	The common method of packing [a wound] is abbreviated, restoring the fracture, and suitable for various complexions, particularly women and children: because it neither causes heat nor cold.
Et est, ut accipias ex puluere molendini, et est medulla farinae quae pendet in parietibus molendini apud motum molae: et conficias ipsum sicut est, praeter quod cribelles ipsum cum albugine oui: et pone confectionem eius non spissam, neque subtilem.	Take pounded barley flour and it is the medulla of wheat which hangs in the walls of barley near the turning-pulley: mix these like this, without making it too thick, neither too thin.
Deinde utere eo.	Use it thus.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, restaurantis fracturam, et dislocationem, et torsionem.	Another method of packing [a wound] is to restore the fracture, dislocation, and torsion
Recipe almess, et laudani, et acaciae, et enulae, et mugath: et suc, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V et alethil ʒ XX terantur omnia, et cribellentur, et misceantur cum aqua alethil: aut cum albugine oui, si complexio infirmi est calefacta.	Almonds, dates, acacia, rue, mugwort: mix these together with ten parts myrrh, five parts aloes, and twenty parts alethil. Crush them all together, mix with warm water or with ground alum if the patient's complexion is hot
Deinde utere hoc emplastro.	Use this packing method
Nam ipsum est bonae compositionis, restaurat ossa fracta uelociter, et confert pluribus hominibus.	For indeed it is a good composition which restores fractured bones quickly and securely, and is suitable for many people.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, quod etiam confert fracturae et torsioni.	Another method of packing which also restores fractures and torsions.
Recipe mugath, et mess, et alteae albae, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V acaciae ʒ VI boli armeni ʒ XX terantur omnia contritione multa, et cribellentur, et conficiantur cum aqua, aut albugine oui: et administrentur.	Mugwort, barley, white alum: mix these together with ten parts myrrh, five parts aloes, six parts acacia, and twenty parts poppy seeds. Crush them all together, mix with water or ground alum. Administer it.
¶ Modus Emplastri ad iuncturas, et ossa separata ex locis suis: et sedat dolorem accidentem eis, et scissuram ossis, et fracturam.	A method of packing for joints and bones separated from their places: it soothes the pain of the accident, the splitting of the bone, and the fracture.
Sumatur lana succida, et submergatur in aceto, et oleo decocto: et ponatur super locum.	Take fine wool, soak it in vinegar, and apply it to the place.
Et in hoc quidem Emplastro non est uirtus restaurationis, sed est bonum in sedatione apostematis calidi: et expellit dolores proprie.	And in this case of Emplastro, there is no benefit from restoration, but it is good to keep the post-operative heat in sedation: and it expels the pain itself.
¶ Modus Emplastri, quod restaurat os fractum.	And in this case of Emplastro, which restores the fractured bone.
Sume folia fici surdi, et folia papaueris syluestris: et tere omnia, et fac emplastrum ex utrisque.	Take leaves of fennel and leaves of pennyroyal of the wild: and all of them, make an Emplastro from both of them.
¶ Modus Emplastri abbreuiati, administrati apud restaurationem fracturae ossis: et quando tu uis resolutionem residui apostematis.	The abbreviated method of Emplastro is administered at the time of restoration of the fracture of the bone: and when you wish for the resolution of the remaining post-operative swelling
Recipe radicis alteae, et camomillae, et florum uiolarum, et farinae herbi, omnium ana partem unam: terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum uino, si non est membrum calefactum.	Recipe of the root of elderberry, and chamomile, and the flowers of violets, and barley herb, all together make up one part: mix all of them together, and boil them with wine, if the limb is not warmed
Si uero est calefactum, tunc confice illud cum aqua coriandri humidi, aut cum aqua, et utere eo.	If indeed it is warmed, then mix it with moist pomegranate juice, or with water, and use it like that
¶ Modus Emplastri alius fortioris in resolutione, quam istud primum, quando accidit apostema durum apud restaurationem membri.	Another method of Emplastro for the resolution is stronger than the first, when it happens that the swelling is hard at the time of restoration of the limb
Recipe radicis alteae, et seminis lini, et balaustiae, et melliloti, et samsuci, et floris uiolarum, et camomillae, omnium ana, partem unam, terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum aqua salicis, aut cum aqua dulci, aut cum uino.	Recipe of the root of elderberry, and flaxseed, and barley, and honey, and chamomile, and violets, all together make up one part: mix all of them together with salty water, or with sweet water, or with wine
Totum illud secundum caliditatem membri, et quietem caloris eius.	All of this according to the heat of the limb, and the quietness of its heat.
Hippocrates uero non dixit in libro suo, quod ponatur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius, nisi caerotum factum ex caera, et oleo: non aliud: et narrauit, ut sit medium inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem.	Hippocrates himself did not say in his book that anything is put on the fractured limb at the time of its restoration, except for lead and oil: nothing else: and he says that there should be a middle course between the extent and the fineness.
Galeno autem uisum est, ut ponantur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius res, in quibus est exiccatio caliditatis, sicut myrrha, et aloes et olibanum, et similia eis ex eis quae narrauimus.	Galen, however, considers it useful to put on the fractured limb at the time of its restoration things which contain the exication of heat, such as myrrh, and aloes and olibanum, and things of that kind
¶ Modus Emplastri quod confert ad laesionem et dolorem.	The method of packing which is useful for the lesion and the pain.
Recipe mugath, et ciceris, et capillorum hominis incisorum, aut pennae auis, et alteae, et salis partes aequales: terantur, et cribellentur, et conficiantur: et fiat ex eo emplastrum.	The method of packing which is useful for the lesion and the pain is to take mugath, ciceris, human hair clippings, or feathers of birds, alum, and salt in equal parts: mix them, sprinkle them, and make a pack from them.
Quantitas autem secundum quam oportet, ut remaneat ligatura, deinde soluatur, est, ut consideres tunc, si non accidit infirmo dolor, neque pruritus, neque mouetur os fractum a loco suo: tunc non resoluas ipsum diebus multis.	The amount however, according to what is necessary, so that the ligature remains, then dissolve it, that is to say, that you consider at that time, if not the patient complains of pain, neither itching, neither movement of the fractured bone from its place: then do not dissolve it for many days.</start_of_turn>
Quod si accidat ei in loco pruritus uehemens, aut dolor inquietans, aut inflatio: tunc propera, et solue in hora ipsum, et aufer emplastrum ab eo: et accipe pannum lenem, aut spongiam marinam lenem, humidam: et submerge eam in aqua tepida, et ablue cum ea locum, donec quiescat pruritus, et sedetur dolor.	If however it happens to him in the place of itching or heat, or pain, or swelling: then act promptly, and dissolve it in an hour itself, and take away the pack from it: and take a soft cushion, or sponge soaked in warm water: and immerse it with it in warm water, and wash it away with it until the itching subsides, and the pain is gone.</start_of_turn>
Deinde dimitte membrum quiescere una hora.	Then let the limb rest for an hour.</start_of_turn>
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam succidam, submersam in aceto et oleo, aut oleo rosato: et liga super ipsum nocte una, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido, et quiescat inflatio membri, et remoueatur dolor eius.	Then put on it a soft wool cover, immersed in vinegar and oil, or oil of roses: and bind it on him at night once, until you are sure about the heat of the afterburn, and the swelling of the limb has subsided, and the pain has gone.</start_of_turn>
Deinde itera ipsum ad stricturam subtilem, et emplastrum paruum: et non stringas ipsum constrictione tua prima, et subtilia cum eo, donec sanetur.	Then repeat the process with slight tightening, and small pack: and do not tighten it too tightly at first, and keep it relaxed with it, until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
Quod si uides, quod apostema, et rubedo, et dolor, et inflatio, et omnia accidentia iam remota sunt penitus, et indiges emplastro et strictura, tunc itera illud sicut fecisti in primis aequaliter.	When you see that the swelling, the redness, the pain, and the heat, and all the other symptoms have subsided, and the pack and the tightening are no longer necessary, then repeat the process as you did at the beginning equally.</start_of_turn
Quod si non accidit membro aliquid ex eis quae diximus, tune non soluas ipsum, nisi post tres dies, aut quatuor, aut quinque, aut septem.	If the limb has not recovered from the disease within three, or four, or five, or seven days, do not treat it further.
Et quando que dimittitur uiginti diebus totum illud, secundum quod apparet tibi ex solutione membri, sicut diximus, donec quando adhaeret fractura, et approximat coagulatio carnis super eam: adde etiam tunc in strictura plus quam strictura tua prima tota: et adde etiam in ingrossatione cibi infirmi, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius.	When the whole limb has recovered within twenty days, according to what appears from the recovery of the limb, as we have said, until the fracture has rejoined and blood clotting has approached on the surface: then add further tension more than the first tension you made throughout: and also add in the ingestion of nourishing food, as it follows the restoration of its memory.
Si autem uides locum fracturae iam exiccari, et extenuari plus quam oportet: tunc scias, quod nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad ipsum.	However, if the fracture has already disappeared from the limb, and tension must be increased more than is necessary: then you know that nourishment must be withheld from it
Embroca ergo ipsum cum aqua tepida apud omnem uicem qua soluis ipsum, et sit illud in omnibus tribus diebus, et alleuia stricturam parumper.	Moisten the limb with warm water at every application of the poultice, and keep it in that state for three days, and relieve the tension slightly
Per hanc ergo operationem currit ad membrum nutrimentum, et sanatur uelociter.	For this procedure, nourishment is abandoned for the limb, and it will heal quickly.
Illud autem quod faciunt stolidi restauratores ex fractura membri uice alia, quando non restauratur in primis, secundum quod oportet, et restauratur secundum tortuositatem, est error ex operatione eorum, et timor magnus: et si esset rectum, dixissent illud antiqui in libris suis, et operati fuissent cum eo.	Whatever the rest of the limb's restorers do in vain in respect of the fracture of the limb except for restoring it at first, as it should be, and restore it according to its flexibility, is an error in their operation, and a great fear: for if it had been right, the ancients would have said so in their books, and they would have performed it in this way.
Et ego non uidi alicubi eorum uestigium in illo omnino, et rectius est, ut non fiat illud.	I have never seen anyone do that in this way, and it is better that it should not be done
¶ De factura accidente in capite.	On the treatment of an accident in the head.
Caput III.	(The text continues with further medical instructions regarding treatment of head injuries.)
Species fracturae sunt diuersae, et figurae eius multae: et caussae eius sunt distinctae.	There are various kinds of fractures, and their figures are many: and their causes are diverse.
Nam ex fractura est quae fit a percussione cum ense: et percussio aufert os totum usquequo peruenit ad siphac, quod est sub osse, sicut facit axia in ligno: et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Axialis.	For a fracture is what is done by an impact with a weapon: and the impact raises the whole limb up to the bone, which is under the skin, just as an ax does to a stick: and for this reason this kind of fracture is called Axial.
Aut ensis incidit quiddam ossis, et incidit faciem eius, et non penetrat incisio usque ad ultimum eius: et nominatur haec species fracturae Kalaan, id est, Leuatio absolute.	If an edge of a bone has fractured and has fractured the face of the bone, and has not penetrated the depth of the latter: this kind of fracture is called Kalaan, that is, complete fracture.
Et est uulnus duarum fracturarum, aut magnum, aut paruum.	It is a wound of two fractures, either great or small.</start_of_turn>
Et ex fractura est, quae est contritio, aut attritio: et caussa eius est percussio cum lapide, aut casus super lapidem, aut eis similia.	A fracture is a break, or tear: the cause of which is percussion with a stone, or a fall from a height, or something similar.</start_of_turn>
Et haec fractura est etiam aut penetrans, quae iam appropinquat panniculo, quod est sub osse: aut est in facie ossis: et est uulnus harum duarum fracturarum etiam aut paruum, aut magnum.	This fracture is also penetrating, which approaches the nerve, which is under the bone: or which is in the face of the bone. This kind of fracture is also called Kalaan, that is, complete fracture.</start_of_turn
Et ex fractura est, quae est occulta in osse in subtilitate capilli: et est fissura parua, et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Capillaris.	And there is also a fracture which is hidden in the bone in the space of a hair: and it is a small fracture, and for this reason it is called capillary fracture.</start_of_turn>
Et ex eis est fractura, quae fit a casu, aut percussione lapidis, et eis similium, quae faciunt ingredi laminam ossis ad interiora, et fit loco concauitas: sicut accidit caldariis aeris, quando occurrit eis percussio, et ingreditur pars eorum ad interiora.	There is also a fracture which results from an accident, or from percussion with a stone, or from something similar, which makes a layer of the bone break inwards, and makes a concavity: as happens with the wind of air when there is percussion of something, and some of its parts enter inwards.</start_of_turn
Et plurimum quidem fit illud in capitibus humidorum ossium, sicut sunt capita puerorum.	And most often this happens in the heads of wet bones, such as the heads of children.</start_of_turn>
Et fiunt omnibus istis speciebus fracturae satagiae separatae, et ego ueniam cum rememoratione illius totius in loco suo.	And all these kinds of fractures are separate from each other, and I will remind you of them all in their place.</start_of_turn>
Et cognoscimus omnes has species fracturae per detectionem super eam, et inquisitionem earum cum tentis, et ablationem carnium corruptarum, quae sunt super eas.	We recognize all these kinds of fractures by their appearance on the surface, and by their tension and by the excision of the corrupted tissue that is above them.</start_of_turn
Species uero Capillaris cognoscitur per hoc, quod detegitur super os, et abstergitur, et linitur super ipsum cum encaustro: fractura enim apparet nigra.	The capillary fracture is recognized by this, that it appears on the bone, is stripped off, and is sutured over itself with charcoal: the fracture appears black.</start_of_turn
In curatione autem fracturae, considera in primis accidentia infirmi: tunc si uides ex accidentibus quod significet significatione manifesta super timorem, sicut uomitus cholerae, et extensio, et amissio intellectus, et abscisio uocis, et syncopis, et febris acuta, et egressus oculorum, et rubedo eorum, et similia eis ex accidentibus in pluribus dispositionibus, proculdubio non sanatur: et si uides accidentia non terrentia te, et speras salutem: tunc incipe curationem eius.	In the treatment of a fracture, consider in the first place the signs of the patient: then, if you recognize signs that signify a serious condition above fear, such as vomiting of cholera, and swelling, and loss of consciousness, and spitting blood, and syncope, and acute fever, and discharge from the eyes, and redness of the skin, and similar signs in various dispositions, it is unlikely that it will be cured without treatment: and if you recognize signs not related to the fracture, and you hope for recovery, then begin the treatment of it.
Quod est, si uenit ad te uulneratus in primis cum uulneratur: et est illud in diebus hyemis, tunc oportet, ut studeas in ablatione ossis ante diem quartumdecimum secundum omnem dispositionem.	If a wound comes to you in the cold days of winter, it is necessary to study the loosening of the bone within four-twelfths of a day in every case.
Et si est in diebus aestatis, tunc oportet, ut properes remouere os ante diem septimum, antequam corrumpatur quod est sub osse ex panniculo, et accidant illa accidentia quae narrauimus.	And if it is in the summer days, then it is necessary to proceed with the removal of the bone before the seventh day, before it becomes corrupted under the nail, and these are the accidents which we have mentioned
Quod si fractura ossis iam peruenit ad panniculum tangentem cerebrum, et est cum minutiis, et attractione: tunc oportet, ut incidas partem comminutam, et attritam, secundum quod narro tibi.	If the bone fracture has reached the skull and is near the brain, and is slight and with traction, then it is necessary to cut away the broken part and the attached portion, according to what has been told you
Et est, ut radas caput uulnerati: et detege super os secundum quemcunque modum possibile est tibi: et secundum figuram uulneris, et quod leue est super infirmum.	And it is necessary to support the head of the wounded person: and uncover the bone according to any method possible: and according to the figure of the wound, and what is most convenient for the patient.
Quod si accidat tibi apud detectionem ossis fluxus sanguinis, aut apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet.	If there is bleeding from the fracture, or a soft swelling, then oppose it with that which is necessary
Et est, ut impleas locum cum pannis infusis in uino, et oleo rosato: et facias quiescere uulnus, donec sedetur apostema, et sis securus a fluxu sanguinis.	And it is necessary to apply a compress with soaked sponges in wine, and wet plaster: and make the wound quiet, until the swelling subsides, and be cautious of bleeding
Deinde incipe in curatione ossis, et ablatione eius.	Then begin the treatment of the bone, and its loosening.
Et illud fit secundum unum duorum modorum.	And it is done according to two measures.
Modus quidem unus est, ut incidas os cum Incisorio strictae aciei: et haec est forma eius.	And one measure is as follows: you cut the bone with the Incisor straight and acute: this is its form.</start_of_turn>
Dende administra Incisorium aliud post Incisorum latius eo parumper: et haec est forma eius.	And the other measure is as follows: you give the Incisor another after the wider one has gone past the middle: this is its form.</start_of_turn>
Deinde administra etiam Incisorium aliud latius etiam quam secundum.	And then you give another Incisor which is wider than the previous one.</start_of_turn>
Et modus secundus est, ut sit apud te numerus Incisoriorum diuersorum: quorum quaedam sint latiora quibusdam, et quaedam eorum breuiora quibusdam: et sint in ultimo acuitatis extremitatum suarum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut fuled: et utere facilitate in percussione super Incisorium, ut non concutiat caput, et laedat ipsum.	And the second measure is that there should be a number of different Incisors alongside each other: some of which are wider than others, and some of which are narrower than others: and their ends should be acute, and they should be made of iron or steel: and use them with ease in the cutting of the Incisor so that it does not bruise the head and does not damage it.</start_of_turn
Si autem os est forte, durum: tunc oportet, ut perfores in circumitu eius, antequam tu administres Incisoria, cum Terebris quae nominantur Terebra non profundantia: et non nominantur ita, nisi quoniam ipsa non pertranseunt terminum ossis carnei ad illud, quod est post ipsum: propterea, quod Terebro est extremitas rotunda super illud, quod est sub capite eius acuto, similis margini, et circulus paruus prohibet submergi, et pertransire spissitudinem ossis.	If, however, the bone is strong and hard: then you must perforate its circumference before you administer the Incisors, with needles which are called non-deep penetrating needles: and they are not called thus except when they do not penetrate to the end of the bony cortex towards that which is behind it: for the needle is a rounded extremity above that which is under the acute angle, like the margin, and a small circle hinders its submerging and its penetration of the thickness of the bone.</start_of_turn
Et conuenit tibi, ut accipias ex istis Terebris numerum multum, quorum unumquodque conueniat quantitati spissitudinis ossis, donec praesens sit tibi omni craneo Terebrum: cuius extremitatis acutae quantitas in longitudine et breuitate sit, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis illius cranei.	And it is suitable for you to take a great number of these needles, the number of which will be equal to the quantity of thickness of the bone, until they are all above the needle: the quantity of the acute end of the needle in length and width should be according to the quantity of thickness of that bone.</start_of_turn
Et haec est forma trium specierum Terebrorum, uel Trepanorum.	And this is the form of the three kinds of needles, or Trepanas.</start_of_turn
Qualitas autem perforandi in circumitu ossis fracti, est: ut ponas Terebrum super os, et reuoluas ipsum digitis tuis, donec scias, os iam penetratum esse.	The quality of the perforation in the vicinity of a fractured bone is thus: to place the thumb over the bone and rotate it with your fingers until you know that the bone has been pierced.
Deinde permuta Terebrum ad locum alium, et pone quod est inter omne foramen quantitatem grossitudinis radii, aut circiter illud.	Then move the thumb to another place and place between every hole the quantity of the breadth of the radius, or somewhat more
Deinde incide cum Incisoriis quod est inter omne foramen ex osse: et fac illud subtilius quam potes super illud ex fine leuitatis, sicut diximus, donec eradices os, aut manu tua, aut cum aliquo alio ex quibusdam instrumentis, quae parasti ad illud: sicut tenaliae, et forpices subtiles.	Then make an incision between every hole in the bone: and do this more finely than the thickness of the limb from its end, as we have said, until you have pierced the bone, or your hand, or with any other instrument which you have at your disposal: such as tweezers and fine needles.
Et oportet, ut caueas omni cautela, ne tangat Terebrum, aut Incisorium aliquid ex siphac.	And it is necessary to take care that neither the thumb nor the incision should touch anything.
Cum ergo circumieris os perforando, et separatum fuerit a siphac, si fuerit continuum cum eo, et extraxeris ipsum, oportet ut radas, et aeques extremitatem eius quod remanet in osse cum instrumento alio simili Incisorio.	When you have thus surrounded the bone with the perforation and it has been separated from the surrounding tissue, if it is continuous with that, you must extract it and then suture and equalize the remaining extremity of it with the instrument which you have used
Verumtamen oportet, ut sit tenuis et subtilis magis aliis Incisoriis.	However, it must be thin and fine compared with other incisions.
Quod si remanet aliquid ex ossibus paruis, et satagiae: tunc accipe ea cum facilitate, cum eo quod est apud te ex instrumentis.	If anything small remains of the bones and fat: then grasp them with ease with the instrument which is at your hand
Deinde cura uulnus post illud cum liciniis, et unguentis quae diximus.	Then care for the wound after this with stitches and the unguents which we mentioned
Et modus alius operationis est facilis, prorsus longinquus a timore: quem dixit Galenus, et laudauit ipsum laude magna: et iste est sermo eius.	And another method of operation is easy, especially for one who is afraid: which Galenus praised and praised highly: and this is his saying.
Necese est tibi in primis, ut incipias detegere partem ossis ex loco, in quo fractura est uehementior, et manifestior: donec quando detexeris illam partem, et posueris sub eo extremitatem huius Incisorii lenticularis, cuius haec est forma.	It is not necessary at first to remove the part of the bone from the place where the fracture is most pronounced and visible: until you have removed that part and placed under it the tip of this lens-shaped incision.
Et pars lenticularis, lenis non incidit aliquid: et pars acuta eius in duabus lateribus eius uadens in longitudinem, sicut uides: ut sit pars lenticularis innixa ad siphac, facie eius incidente acuta in osse.	And the lenticular part [of the eye] is soft and does not yield to anything: and the acute part of it extends in two lateral directions, like water: so that the lenticular part is near the pupil, and the acute part of it is incident on the bone.
Deinde percute super Incisorium a parte una cum malleo paruo, donec incidas totum os cum facilitate, sicut reuoluitur: et tu sis securus ex panniculo, quod non accidat in eo accidens, quod timeas prorsus.	And thus pierce through the Incisorium with a small hammer until you have cut through the whole bone easily, as it is wont to do: and you will be safe from the spur, which does not happen in this accident, as you fear beforehand.
Et si medicans non esset stultior hominum, et magis ignarus eius, nec esset dormiens, tunc si remaneret aliquid annexum ossi ex panniculo in quibusdam locis, incideret ipsum ab eo cum extremitate incisorii lenticularis ipsius, et liberaret ipsum ab eo cum facilitate.	And even if the physician is not stupid among men, and is more ignorant of this matter, or is asleep, then if anything remains attached to the bone from the spur in some places, it will be cut away from it with the extremity of the incisor of the lens itself, and will be freed from it easily
Liberatur enim ab eo sine nocumento, et absque timore.	It is freed from it without damage, and without fear.
Et si fractura ossis non penetret usque ad panniculum, et illud quod abscinditur ab osse est facies eius, et remanent in ipso asperitas et satagiae subtiles: tunc oportet, ut radas illam asperitatem, et eradices illas satagias cum rasoriis subtilibus ex quibus praeparasti numerum diuersarum quantitatum, ut sit tibi possibile administrare ex eis in omni loco conuenientiora eorum, et rectiora ipsorum, secundum illud ad quod perducit te operatio, et ipsum os fractum, et figura eius.	And if the fracture of the bone does not penetrate as far as the pupil, and that which is detached from the bone is its face, and remains in it rough spots and slight cavities: then it is necessary to smooth down that roughness, and to remove those cavities with fine files of various sizes, so that you can easily manage them in every place where it is convenient, and make them more straight, according to what leads you in this operation, and the fractured bone itself, and its figure
Et oportet, ut administres in rasione tua, qua in primis radis os, latius illorum rasoriorum.	And you must manage with your reason, that in the first place you grind the greater part of the bone, and then those files of the rasps.
Deinde utere post ipsum subtiliore eo.	And then use the finer one afterwards.
Et non cesses facere illud secundum continuitatem, donec peruenias ad administrandum tenuius, et subtilius eorum omnium.	And do not cease doing this until you have reached the point where you can manage them more finely and delicately in everything
In unaquaque autem fissurarum reliquarum paruarum capillarium, et fractura subtili, oportet ut administres curam, secundum illud quod perducit ad rectificationem eius.	And in all the small fissures remaining after the fracture of the bone, and the slight fracture, you must take care, according to what leads to its rectification.
Et est res quae non occultatur super omnem, cui in hac arte est quodlibet studium, et stetit super illud quod scripsimus, et ostendimus in fracturis magnis.	And it is a thing which is not hidden over all men, concerning which there is much study in this art, and which stands over that which we have written, and which we show in great fractures.
Si autem panniculus detectus retinetur, quando tu eradicas os: tunc oportet, ut accipias pannum lini, secundum quantitatem uulneris, et submerge ipsum in oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super orificium uulneris.	If, however, a blood clot is detected to be retained when you are evacuating the bone: then it is necessary that you take hold of the clot, according to the quantity of the wound, and plunge it into white wax, and place it over the opening of the wound.
Deinde accipe pannum alium duplicatum, aut triplicatum, et submerge ipsum in uino et oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super pannum primum: et fac illud quam facilius potes super illud, ut non grauetur siphac.	Then take another clot, doubled or tripled, and plunge it into wine and white wax, and place it over the first clot: and make it as easy as possible for the patient over that.
Deinde administra supra ipsum ligamentum latum: et non stringas ipsum, nisi per quantitatem quae teneat uulnus tantum: et dimitte ipsum cum hac cura die uno, aut diebus duobus, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido.	Then administer above it a broad ligament: and do not tighten it, except for the quantity which sustains the wound: and let it go when the wound is healed.
Deinde solue ipsum, et administra post illud medicinas cum quibus est superflua siccitas: sicut radices lilii, et farina herbi, et puluis thuris, et aristolochia, et similia eis: et est, ut facias ex istis medicinis puluerem, qui puluerizetur super uulnus sicut sunt siccae.	Then heal it, and afterwards administer these medicines which are useful for excessive heat: such as the roots of lily, and herbs of barley, and barley flour, and gentian, and similar things: and it is that you make from these medicines a powder, which will be scattered over the wound as it is dry.
Et uniuersaliter administra in illo omnem medicinam de proprietate cuius est ut abstergat, et non mordicet.	And in general, administer in that all medicine which has the property of drying out, and does not bite.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, ut uulnus in curatione tua sit limpidum: neque sit in ea sordes unguenti, neque sordicies.	And be careful according to your skill, so that the wound in your care may be limp: neither greasy, neither biting.
Neque dimittas uirus aggregari in eo omnino: quoniam quando uirus aggregatur super panniculum cerebri, corrumpit eum, et putrefacit ipsum, et accidit super infirmum post illud malicia magna: et iam accidit in siphac capitis, cum mundificatur ab eo os, praecipue quando negligitur cura eius, nigredo in superficie eius.	Neither let blood gather in it in any way: for when blood gathers on a brain clot, it corrupts it, and putsrefies it, and causes great harm: and this happens in the swelling of the head, when it is neglected.
Considera ergo tunc, si accidunt infirmo accidentia quae diximus, scias, quia est pernitiosum proculdubio.	Consider therefore now, if an accident happens to a sick person, you know that it is perilous for the safety of the patient.
Et si nigredo non accidit, nisi a medicina quae ponitur super ipsum, et est in uirtute illius medicinae, ut faciat illam nigredinem: tunc oportet, ut accipias ex melle partem unam, ex oleo rosato partes tres, et linias cum eis pannum.	If indeed an accident does not happen, except for the medicine which is placed upon him, and that medicine is in the power of that medicine, then it should be taken from the middle part and a third from each of the two sides, and lines with it like a bandage
Deinde pone ipsum super siphac: postea cura ipsum cum speciebus curationis quae conueniunt, donec sanetur.	Then put it upon the wound: afterwards care for him with the things that are suitable for his case until he is healed.
¶ De restauratione Nasi quando frangitur.	When the head is fractured, restoration should be delayed until the fracture has healed.
Caput IIII.	Chapter III.
Scias, quod non franguntur ex Naso nisi duae partes eius superiores simul, aut una earum: propterea, quod ipse sunt duo ossa: quoniam inferius eius est cartilaginosum, non frangitur, et non accidit ei nisi attritio, et tortuositas, et simitas.	You know that the nose is not fractured except for two of its upper parts simultaneously, or one of them: because indeed they are two bones: for the lower one of them is cartilaginous and does not fracture, and does not happen to it except for abrasion, and twisting, and swelling.
Si frangitur una duarum partium eius, tunc oportet, ut intromittas digitum paruum in foramen Nasi, et aeques illam fracturam digito tuo indice, et pollice deforis, donec redeat Nasus super figuram suam naturalem: et fiat illud arte, cum facilitate.	If one of the two parts is fractured, then it should be done that you insert the little finger into the hole of the nose, and equal the fracture with your index finger and thumb apart, until the nose returns to its natural shape: and do this with art, with ease.
Et caue, ne accidat per operationem tuam illam super infirmum dolor.	And beware, that you do not cause further pain to the patient by your operation.
Quod si fractura est in superiore parte Nasi, et non perueniat ad illam digitus: tunc oportet, ut aequetur extremitate radii, in quo sit grossitudo parua.	If the fracture is in the upper part of the nose, and does not reach the little finger: then it should be done that the extremities of the radius be equalised in the part where there is little thickness
Si uero fractura est in duabus partibus, tunc fac simile illius: et propera cum restauratione eius in die primo fracturae, si est possibile.	If indeed the fracture is in two parts, then do likewise: and be careful with the restoration of it on the first day of the fracture, if it is possible.
Et si non, tunc post diem septimum, aut decimum apud quietem apostematis calidi.	If not, then after the seventh or tenth day at rest [of the patient] near the hot foot.
Deinde intromitte in extremitate Nasi licinium ex panno lini, si fractura est in parte una: aut intromite duo licinia si fractura est in duabus partibus: et sit in licinio grossitudo tantae quantitatis, quae impleat foramen Nasi.	If not, then after the seventh or tenth day at rest near the hot foot
Et dixerunt quidam antiquorum restauratorum, ut infundantur licinia in butyro, et permutentur omni die.	And some of the ancient restorers say that they should be bathed in butter and changed every day.
Illud uero non uidetur mihi, imo oportet, ut infundatur licinium in albugine oui, confecto cum puluere molendini.	It is better to pour the unguents into alum or mix them with fine flour
Deinde dimitte licinium, donec firmetur os, et induretur cartilago.	Then withdraw the unguents until the bone is firm, and let the cartilage remain.
Et quandoque intromittitur in Nasum loco licinii penna anseris, postquam inuoluitur super ipsam pannus lenis: et fit, quod ipsa tenet fracturam Nasi uehementius, et ut non prohibeatur infirmus ab inspiratione.	When you put in the nose the place of the unguents there should be a feather pen over it, and it will happen that the fracture of the nose is held together more firmly and that the sick man is not hindered by the inspiration of air
Et non est haec res necessaria.	This is not necessary.
Si uis, fac illud: et si uis, fac licinia.	If you will, do so. And if you will, do the unguents.
Quod si accidat Naso iterum dum operaris apostema calidum, emplastra nasum cum caeroto, aut cum coto infuso in oleo rosato, aut modico ex dyaquilon.	If the nose happens again while you are working on the aftercare of the foot, plaster the nose with gypsum, or with cooked fat poured over saffron, or with something of the kind
Si autem non accidit apostema calidum, tunc oportet, ut emplastres ipsum cum farina sisami, et puluere thuris confecti cum albugine oui.	If not, then it is necessary to plaster it with millet flour and fine powder of barley mixed with alum or butter
Deinde pone super ipsum stuppam lenem, et non liges Nasum cum aliquo omnino.	Then put over it a soft cushion, and do not bind the nose to anything
Si uero franguntur ossa Nasi fractura parua, aut comminuuntur, tunc oportet, ut scindas super ea, et extrahas ipsa cum instrumentis quae conueniunt eis.	If the bones of the nose are slightly fractured or broken, then it is necessary to break through them and extract them with the instruments which are suitable for this.
Deinde sue scissuram, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat, et consolidat ex emplastris conuenientibus ad illud, uel unguentis.	Then take the scissors and care for the wound with that which is in it, and consolidate it with suitable patches or bands.
Quod si accidat inter Nasum uulnus, tunc oportet, ut cures ipsum cum liciniis: et administres cannulam de plumbo, donec sanetur.	If this happens in the nose or ear, then it is necessary, that you take care of the wound with bandages: and apply a lead cannula until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
¶ De restauratione Mandibulae inferioris, quando disrumpitur.	In the restoration of the lower jaw when it is fractured.</start_of_turn>
Caput V.	Section V.</start_of_turn>
Quando disrumpitur Mandibula inferior, et fractura eius non est cum uulnere: conspice tunc si est fractura eius deforis tantum, et non frangitur in duo, et curuatur ad interiora: tunc cognitio eius est facilis.	When the lower jaw is fractured, and the fracture is not accompanied by a wound: then look to see if the fracture is only on the outer surface and not broken into two pieces, and if so, it will be easily recognized.</start_of_turn
Oportet ergo, si est fractura eius in parte dextra, ut intromittas digitum indicem sinistrae in os infirmi: similiter si fractura est in mandibula sinistra, tunc intromitte indicem manus dextrae: et impelle cum eo gibbositatem fracturae deintus cum facilitate ad exteriora cum manu tua altera ab interiori parte ossis decenter, et cum eo aequa ipsam.	It is necessary therefore, if the fracture is on the right side, to insert the left index finger into the bone: similarly if the fracture is on the left side, then insert the right index finger: and press with it the swelling of the fracture inwards towards the outside with your other hand from the inside of the bone and with the same hand equalize it.</start_of_turn
Quod si fractura mandibulae iam separata est in duo, tunc oportet, ut administres extersionem a duabus partibus, secundum rectitudinem: donec possibilis sit aequatio eius.	If the fracture of the jaw has been separated into two pieces, then it is necessary to administer an extrusion from both parts, according to the rectitude: until the possibility of equating it exists.</start_of_turn
Si autem iam accidit in dentibus commotio, aut disruptio: tunc stringe illos de quibus speras quod remaneant cum filo auri, aut argenti, aut seta.	But if there is a displacement or fracture in the teeth: then string those which you hope will remain with gold wire, or silver wire, or thread.</start_of_turn
Deinde pone super mandibulam fractam caerotum.	Then put over the fractured jaw a cushion.</start_of_turn
Deinde pone super ipsum pannum duplicatum, et pone super pannum astellam magnam decenter factam: aut frustum cutis soleae aequale, in longitudinem mandibulae.	Then put over that a doubled cloth, and put over the cloth a large piece of felt centered: or a piece of leather equal in length to the jaw.</start_of_turn
Deinde liga ipsum desuper, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ligatura eius, et conuenit ipsius applicatio, donec non destruitur: et praecipe infirmo, uti tranquillitate et quiete: et pone cibum eius sorbitiones lenes.	Then bind up the limb above, according to what is prepared for its ligation, and it agrees with its application, until it is not destroyed: and command the patient to remain calm and quiet: and give him food of soft broths.
Si autem estimas, quod iam alteratur aliquid figurae aliquo modorum: tunc propera, et solue ipsum in die tertio.	If, however, you think that something is changing in the figure or in some way: then prolong [treatment] and solve it on the third day.
Deinde rectifica quod alteratum est ex eo, et emplastra ipsum ex puluere molendini, cum albugine oui, aut cum farina sisami, postquam tu abstuleris caerotum: et pone super emplastrum lanam lenem.	Then make good what has been altered from that, and cover it with fine powder of wheat or barley, with alum or with powdered oatmeal: and after you have removed the wound: and put on a layer of soft wool above the dressing.
Dum ergo permanet annexum illud emplastrum super ipsum, et non alteratur ossis dispositio, dimitte ipsum, ne soluas, donec sanetur: aut stringe fracturam.	While that dressing remains attached to that, and the bone structure is not altered: withdraw it, do not solve it, until it is healed: or bind the fracture tight
Multotiens enim stringitur haec fractura in tribus septimanis.	Many times this fracture is bound tight for three weeks.
Quod si interim accidat apostema calidum, tunc administra illud quod diximus multotiens in sedatione eius, donec remoueatur illud apostema.	If in the meantime a callous swelling should happen: then manage that as we have said many times in its sedation, until that swelling is removed
Et si fractura est cum uulnere, considera.	If the fracture is with a wound, consider it carefully.
Namsi iam separatur ex osse frustum, aut a satagie: tunc subtilia te in hoc, ut auferas illa frusta satagiae cum eo quod conuenit tibi in ablatione eorum ex instrumentis.	For if it is separated from the bone fragment, or from the bandage: then consider this, that you must bind together the fragment of the bandage with that which agrees with its ablation from the instruments.
Si uero orificium uulneris est strictum, tunc amplifica ipsum cum phlebotomo secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	If indeed the opening of the wound is strict: then enlarge it with a phlebotome according to the quantity of your need.
Deinde quando abstuleris illa satagie, et non remanserit ex eis aliquid, sue tunc orificium uulneris, si est amplum: et si non, pone super ipsum ex emplastris quae conueniunt ad illud, et incarnant illud, donec sanetur.	Then when you have removed the bandage, and no more blood remains there: close the wound, if it is large: or if not, put on above it the cloths which agree with that, and cover it in such a way that it is protected, until it is healed
¶ De restauratione Furculae, quando frangitur.	On restoration of the Furcula when fractured.
Caput VI.	On restoration of the Furcula when fractured.
Plurimum quidem frangitur Furcula ab anteriore parte ex parte humeri, et fractura eius fit secundum unum trium modorum.	The Furcula is most frequently fractured from the front by the humerus, and its fracture is of three kinds.
Aut enim frangitur et separatur in duo, praeter quod accidant in ea satagiae: et est facilius ad restaurationem eius.	Or it is fractured and separated into two, besides which they are liable to occur in these positions: and it is easier to restore it in this way
Aut ita, quod accidunt in osse satagiae: et est difficilius ad restaurationem.	Or so, because they occur in the sitting position: and it is more difficult to restore it
Aut ita, quod est fractura cum uulnere.	Or because it is fractured with a wound
Et operatio in ea quando fractura est absque uulnere, est, ut facias praesentes esse duos ministros, ut teneat unus eorum adiutorium quod sequitur Furculam fractam, et alter extendat collum uersus partem.	And the operation in this case when the fracture is without wound, is that you make two assistants present, one of whom follows the fractured Furcula and the other extends the limb above the part
Deinde aequa fracturam digitis tuis, donec fiat forma eius, secundum quod oportet: et non sit in ea eminentia, neque concauitas.	Then equalize the fracture of the fingers until it has the shape desired: and do not make it prominent or concave.
Quod si indiges extensione plus, tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico infirmi spheram ex panno, aut lana: et sit magnitudo eius secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae: et extende, et eleua Furculam, et coarta spheram manu tua, donec aeques fracturam, secundum quod oportet.	If, however, it requires more extension, then it is necessary to place under the elbow of the patient a sphere of wool or lanolin: and let its size be according to the extent of the need: and extend and elevate the Furcula, and cover the sphere of the hand, until the fracture is equal, as desired
Quod si non potes trahere extremitatem Furculae ad exteriora: propterea, quia peruenit ad profundum: tunc oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et ponas sub humero eius puluinar medium in magnitudine, et premat minister humerum eius ad inferiora, donec eleuetur os Furculae quod est in profundo ad sursum: atque tunc rectifica fracturam, et aequa eam digitis tuis.	If it is not possible to draw out the extremity of the Furcula outwards: because it has gone deep: then it is necessary to suspend the patient over the edge of a chair: and place under the elbow of him a middle finger of the hand in magnitude, and bring the minister of the humerus to the lower parts: until the fractured part of the Furcula which is in depth is raised up: and then straighten the fracture and equalize the fingers again
Si autem sentis sathaiatum ex Furcula, et mouetur: tunc oportet, ut findas super illud, et extrahas ipsum alsathaiatum cum facilitate.	If, however, you feel swelling from the Furcula and movement: then it is necessary to find over that and draw it out easily.
Si autem est retentum in osse, tunc ingenia in incisione eius cum uno Incisoriorum quae praeparasti ad illud, postquam tu posueris sub Furcula instrumentum quod seruat sifach: et est instrumentum ex ligno, aut ex ferro.	If, however, there is retention in the bone, then you generate in the incision with one of the Incisors which you have prepared for this, after you have placed under the Forceps the instrument which serves to grasp: and the instrument is made of wood, or of iron.
Et haec est forma eius.	This is its form.
Assimilatur cochleari cui non est concauitas.	It is shaped like a cochlea which has no curvature
Et sit latitudo eius secundum illud quo indiges eo ex magnitudine ossis, et paruitate eius.	And its width should be according to the extent of the lesion in the bone, and its depth
Longitudo uero eius etiam secundum quod possibile est tibi ad operationem.	Its length should also be according to what is possible for you in the operation
Et habeat duas extremitates, sicut uides: et extremitas una sit ampla, et altera stricta.	And it should have two extremities, like a hook: and one extremity is wide, and the other is narrow
Si autem disruptio uulneris quod scidisti quando extraxisti sathaiatum ossis, est ampla, et securaris ab apostemate calido: tunc aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura.	If, however, there is disruption of the wound which you cut when you extracted the foreign body from the bone, it is wide, and you secure it from the surrounding tissue: then you join together the two lips of the wound with sutures.
Et si disruptio est parua, aut times apostema calidum: tunc imple uulnus cum pannis, et puluillis secundum quantitatem scissurae uulneris.	And if the disruption is small, or there is slight swelling: then you close the wound with silk thread, and pieces according to the extent of the wound
Quod si accidat apostema calidum, tunc infunde pannum in oleo rosato, et aceto, et uino, et pone super ipsum.	And if there is swelling, then you apply a compress to the wound which is wet with oil, and aceto, and wine, and put on it.
Strictura uero ossis quando est absque uulnere, et absque sectione, est, ut ponas super os emplastrum factum ex farina molendini cum albugine oui.	As for the fixation of the bone when there is no wound, and no section, it is like placing over the bone a plaster made from fine flour with gypsum or alum.
Et pone stuppam lenem super ipsum.	And put on a soft padding over it
Deinde pone spheram sub titillico eius, si indiges illa.	And then put a sphere under its head if you deem it necessary.
Deinde accipe himematem, id est, rotam quam tenent Saraceni, quae sit longa ualde: et sit latitudo eius palmi unius, aut circiter illud.	And then bind it tightly, that is, with a bandage which is as long as the thumb, or about that wide.
Deinde pone puluillum duplicatum super stuppam et emplastrum.	Then place a doubled plug of wool over the swelling and apply plaster.
Deinde accipe astellam ex tabula subtili, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, et in longitudine similiter.	Then take a piece of sponge from a thin board, whose width is three fingers wide, and in length similarly
Deinde inuolue eam in panno.	Then wrap the wound in cloth.
Deinde inuolue pannum illum cum astella in loco alhimemati qui cadit super fracturam et locum.	Then wrap a bandage soaked in oil around the bone where the fracture lies beneath the swelling and the place where the fracture has occurred
Deinde pone alhimemati super fracturam sicut reuoluiur, et inuolue eam super collum eius, et sub titillico eius sano, et sub titillico eius infirmo: et reduc eam super omnem partem, et quomodo uides quod strictura tenet fracturam strictura decenti: et est illud, quod non occultatur super te, et totum, ut non remoueatur astella desuper os fractum.	Then place the swelling above the fracture as if rolling it, and wrap the bandage around the neck of the bone, and under the healthy nail and under the unhealthy nail: and reduce the bandage over the whole, so that the nail does not remain uncovered above the fractured bone.
Et propter hoc oportet, ut aspicias infirmum in omni die.	And for this reason the patient must be observed every day
Quotiens ergo mollificatur ligamentum, et uides astellam iam remoueri: tunc rectifica illud, et stringe ligamentum.	Every time the ligament is softened and the nail can be moved: then restore it and tighten the ligament again
Deinde pone somnum infirmi super dorsum eius, et pone sub titillico eius apud somnum eius puluinar paruum in nocte, ut cum eo eleuetur adiutorium eius a latere ipsius.	Then place the patient's sleep on his back, and place under his nail beside his sleep a small ball of wool at night, so that when he wakes up in the morning the attendants will find him without it on his side
Eleuatur ergo fractura furculae per eleuationem humeri.	The fracture of the collarbone is elevated by the elevation of the arm.
Aut liga brachium eius ad collum ipsius: et non soluas ligamentum, si non accidat in loco accidens ex pruritu, aut ab apostemate, usque ad duodecim dies.	Or bind the arm to the chest: and do not break the ligament if it does not happen in the place of an accident from itching, or from swelling, up until twelve days.
Deinde renoua emplastrum, si uideris faciem eius ad illud.	Then renew the plaster if you see its face to be softened
Et adde in strictura, et dimitte ipsum, donec restauretur et coaguletur.	And strengthen the bandage, and loosen it, until it has recovered and clotted.
Et fractura quidem furculae stringitur et confortatur secundum plurimum in uigintiocto diebus: et quandoque fit in quibusdam hominibus in minore illo.	And the fracture of the collarbone is bound and comforted for the most part in eighty days: and when it happens in some people in less time than this
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spatulae.	On the restoration of a fractured Spatula.
Caput VII.	On the restoration of a fractured Spatula.
Raro frangitur Spatula, et in loco lato eius: et non franguntur ex ea nisi margines eius.	Rarely does the Spatula fracture, and in its wide place: and they do not fracture from these margins of its edges.
Quando ergo frangitur ex eo locus, et frangitur in medio eius, et non cognoscitur illud nisi per tactum: tunc secundum quod est figura fracturae conare praeparationem eius.	When it has fractured from that place, and has fractured in the middle of it, and is not recognized except by touch: then according to the figure of the fracture one must attempt its preparation
Et reduc eam super figuram naturalem omni modo ingenii, quod est tibi possibile.	And reduce it over the natural figure in every way that is possible
Deinde pone super locum puluerem molendini cum albugine oui, et stuppam lenem, et pone desuper puluillum ex panno duplato.	Then put upon the place powder of pounded barley with alum, and a soft cushion, and put upon it a double-folded cloth.
Deinde pone super ipsum astellam latam ex tabula subtili secundum quantitatem Spatulae totius, aut ampliorem ea parum.	Then put upon it a wide bandage from a thin board according to the quantity of the whole Spatula, or a little more of it
Si uero sub astella est concauitas in aliquo locorum Spatulae, tunc aequa illam concauitatem cum stuppa leni, donec descendat astella secundum aequalitatem.	If indeed within the bandage there is a concavity in any place of the Spatula, then equalize that concavity with a soft cushion, until the bandage descends according to equality
Deinde ftringe desuper cum alhimemati longa, constrictione decenti, et firmitudine astellae, donec non remoueatur a loco suo.	Then bind up above with long alhimate, decreasing the constriction, and the firmness of the bandage, until it does not move from its place
Et considera ligamentum in omni die.	And consider the ligament in every day.
Quotienscunque ergo mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum, et aequa astellam si remoueatur a loco suo: et iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	Every time that the ligament is relaxed, bind it up, and equalize the bandage if it moves from its place: and let the patient rest upon its sound side
Et Spatula quidem restauratur in uiginti diebus, aut in uigintiquinque diebus.	And the Spatula is restored in ninety days, or in ninety-five days
Quando ergo completur iste numerus, tunc solue ligamentum: et tu sis in securitate.	When these days have passed, then loosen the ligament: and you will be secure
Nam ipsa est ex ossibus quorum communitio non timetur, neque eorum solutio.	For the very bones from which the Spatula is composed do not break in time, neither is their solution
Si autem procedat ex osse frustum, et pungit sub cute: tune scinde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum.	If, however, it proceeds from a bone that is fractured under the skin: then cut above the latter and remove the latter.
Et fac quod diximus in fractura furculae ex sedatione apostematis calidi, si accidat ex eo aliquid.	Do as we have said in the case of a fracture of the collarbone from the relaxation of the soft parts, if anything should happen from this.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Pectoris.	On the restoration of a fracture of the breastbone.
Caput VIII.	Chapter VIII.
Pectus quandoque frangitur in medio sui, et raro accidit illud.	The breastbone sometimes fractures in the middle, and this is rare.
Extremitates eius quidem plurimum franguntur, et comminuuntur ex accidentibus eius.	The extremities of it are indeed most frequently fractured, and are broken from its accidents
Quando frangitur eius medium, quod declinat ad inferiora, et accidit ei dolor uehemens, et difficultas in anhelitu, et tussis: et fortasse euomit sanguinem, et declaratur concauitas in osse fracto, et non occultatur sensui, Restauratio eius est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et pone inter Spatulas eius puluinar.	When it fractures in the middle, which inclines downwards, and there is pain, difficulty in swallowing, and coughing: and perhaps vomiting blood, and there is displacement of the fractured bone, and this is not concealed by sense. The restoration of it is that the patient rests on his back: and put between his thumbs.
Deinde preme humeros eius, et aggrega costas a duabus partibus uel lateribus cum manibus: et subtiliare in aequatione eius, secundum omnem modum quo possibile est illud et conuenit, donec redeat figura ossis, secundum quod oportet.	Then press his arms and join the ribs from two parts or sides with the hands: and make it even in its form, as much as possible, until the figure of the bone returns, as it should be
Deinde pone super ipsum emplastrum et stuppam, et pone desuper astellam ex tabula subtili ex salice, aut chalingi, et ex eis similibus in leuitate, postquam tu inuoluis eam in panno.	Then put upon it a bandage and a cushion, and put above it a bandage of fine gauze, or splints, and of lead in like manner on the outside, after you have bound up the patient in a sheet
Deinde subtiliare in ligando eam super os fractum, ut non remoueatur: et uade cum ligatura secundum rotunditatem ad dorsum aliquotiens, et stringe ipsum strictura decenti.	Then make it even in binding up the patient over the fractured bone, so that it does not move: and bind with ligature according to the roundness at the back, and bind it tightly.
Deinde considera ligaturam in omni hora, et quotienscumque mollificatur, stringe eam: et si necessitas eius prouocat ad solutionem eius apud pruritum, uel corrosionem quae accidit in loco, aut dolorem, aut apostema: tunc propera, et solue eam, et eradica emplastrum, et rectifica quod accidit cum modo curationis eius.	Then consider the binding at all times, and every time it is relaxed, bind the patient: and if its necessity indicates the solution of it at the itching, or corrosion which happens in the place, or pain, or swelling: then correct it, and solve the patient, and remove the bandage, and restore what has happened in the manner of its treatment
Deinde reduc emplastrum, si uides ad illud faciem: et annecte ei stricturam, donec sanetur.	If the swelling has come to the face, reduce it, and bind it tightly until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Costarum, quando franguntur.	When the swelling has come to the face, reduce it, and bind it tightly until it heals.
Caput IX.	Chapter IX.
Scias, quod Costarum fractura non accidit, nisi in locis grossis quae sequuntur dorsum, et ex extremitatibus earum ab anteriori parte.	You know that a fracture of the face does not happen except in great places that follow the back, and from the extremities of the latter from the front part.
Et non accidit eis attritio, nisi propterea, quia sunt cartilaginosae.	And it does not happen except for attrition, except for these two, because they are cartilaginous
Et cognitio ipsius non occultatur sensui apud inquisitionem cum digitis.	And the knowledge of the same is not hidden from the sense when questioned with fingers.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, ut aeques fracturam cum digitis secundum modum possibilem, donec aequetur figura, secundum quod oportet.	And its restoration is done in this way, as to equal the fracture with the fingers according to the possible method, until the figure is equal, according to what is necessary
Deinde emplastra, et stringe os fractum cum astella, si indiget illo.	Then apply compresses, and bind the fractured bone with wire if necessary for it
Et si fractura Costarum est decliuis ad interiora: tunc accidit infirmo dolor uehemens, et punctura, sicut punctura illa quae accidit illi qui habet pleuresim: propterea, quod os pungit uelamen, et etiam ei accidit difficultas anhelitus, et tussis, et uomitus sanguinis multi: et haec est difficilis curationis.	And if the fracture of the face is downhill towards the inside: then it happens with weak pain that comes with vomiting, and swelling, just as it happens in those who have pleurisis: because the bone pierces the membrane, and also there happens difficulty in breathing, and coughing, and vomiting of blood: and this is a difficult cure.
Et iam ingeniati sunt antiqui in ea cum ingeniis multis: et ex eis sunt qui dicunt, ut ponas cibos infirmi qui generent inflammationem et uentositatem, ut inflammetur uenter, et extendatur, et impellatur fractura ad exteriora.	And the ancients were learned in this with many learned men: and among them are those who say that one should put on the diseased parts things that generate inflammation and swelling, so that the belly inflates, and expands, and drives out the fracture outwards
Nos uero abhorremus, ut non fiat caussa uelox ad faciendum apostema calidum, si non accidit.	We indeed abhor that this should be the cause of making the swelling cold, if this does not happen
Si autem iam accidit, tunc addit in eo.	If however this happens, then add in this.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: ponatur super locum uentosa, deinde sugatur cum fortitudine, et est similius ratiocinationi.	And some of them said: It is placed upon the seat of the swelling, and then it is squeezed with force, and it is similar in reasoning.
Verumtamen timetur, quod attrahat uentosa superfluitates ad locum, propter dispositionem debilitatis.	Indeed, it is known that it attracts the swelling towards the place, on account of the arrangement of the bones
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: oportet ut cooperiatur locus cum lana quae iam submersa est in oleo calido: et ponantur puluilli inter Costas, donec impleatur: ut sit ligatura aequalis quando inuoluis eam secundum rotunditatem.	And some of them said: It must cooperate with the place which is already submerged in warm oil: and they put in wool between the ribs, until it is filled: so that there will be an even ligation when you tighten it according to the circumference.
Deinde curetur infirmus curatione pleuresis ex cibo et medicina.	Then the patient is cared for with food and medicine for the pleurisis
Quod si coartat infirmum res uehemens, quam non tolerat, et os pungit uelamen punctura laedente, et timemus super infirmum: tunc oportet, ut scindamus super locum, et detegamus a Costa fracta.	If he coarsens the patient while he is suffering, which he does not tolerate, and if the bone is fractured or pierced with a needle causing pain, and we fear over the patient: then it is necessary to split open the place, and remove the fractured rib.
Deinde ponamus super ea instrumentum quod conseruat sifac, cuius rememoratio praecessit: et incidamus os cum facilitate, et incidamus ipsum.	Then we place above it an instrument which retains the fat, whose memory precedes it: and we break the bone easily, and we break the bone itself.
Deinde aggregemus duo labia uulneris, si est magnum cum sutura: et curemus ipsum cum emplastris, donec sanetur.	Then we join together the two lips of the wound, if there is a large one with a suture: and we care for it with compresses, until it is healed.
Quod si accidat interim apostema calidum, tunc propera, et infunde puluillos in oleo rosato, et pone super locum: et curetur infirmus cum eo quod conuenit apostemati.	If meanwhile a thick scab should happen, then cleanse it, and pour in wool on the oiled place, and put on it: and care for the patient with that which agrees with the scab
Interim etiam resupinetur super latus super quod dormit, donec sanetur.	And also rest the patient on the side on which he sleeps, until he is healed.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spondilium dorsi et colli.	On the restoration of fractures of the rib of the back and the neck.
Caput X.	Chapter X.
Ossibus quidem colli quandoque aduenit fractura, et raro accidit eis attritio: et similiter Spondilibus dorsi etiam.	The bones of the neck when they happen to be fractured, and rarely does attrition occur in them: and in the same way with the ribs of the back also.
Cum ergo accidit illud alicui, et uis scire, an sanetur, an non sanetur: tunc confidera.	When anything happens to anyone, and you wish to know whether he is saved or lost: then believe.
Nam si uides manus eius iam mollificatas, et stupefactas, et mortuas: et non potest mouere eas, neque extendere eas, neque constringere eas: et quando constringis eas cum digitis tuis, et pungis eas cum acu, non sentit illud, et non sentit in eis dolorem: tunc scias, quia non sanatur, et in pluribus dispositionibus est mortale.	When anything happens to anyone, and you wish to know whether he is saved or lost: then believe. For if you touch his hand and find it softened, stupefied, and dead: and you are unable to move, extend, or constrict it: when you bind it up with your fingers and needles like an awl, he does not feel any pain, neither does he feel any sensation: then you know that he is not saved, and that death is at hand in many arrangements.
Quod si mouet eas, et sentit in eis constrictionem cum digitis et puncturam: tunc scias, quia nucha ossis salua est, et quod infirmus sanabitur cum curatione.	When he moves and feels constriction in his hand with your fingers and needle: then you know that the bone is not broken, and that the patient will recover with treatment.
Quod si eueniat Spondilibus dorsi simile illius, et uis scire, an sanetur etiam, an non: tunc considera ad pedes eius: tunc si uides quod mollificati sunt, et accidit in eis illud quod accidit in manibus: deinde quando iacet super dorsum suum, egreditur uentositas et egestio absque uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super uentrem suum, egreditur egestio sine uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super dorsum suum, et uult mingere, et non potest: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	If the patient experiences a backache like that of Spondilibus, and you wish to know whether he is saved or not: then look at his feet. For if you touch them and find that they are softened in this condition as in the hands: then when he lies down on his back, the wind comes out and evacuates without his will: and when he turns over onto his belly, evacuation comes out without his will: and when he turns over onto his back and wants to speak, but is unable to: then you know that it is deadly.
Non ergo labores in curatione eius.	It is of no use to toil in his care.
Si uero non accidit ei aliquid ex illo, res est leuior.	If nothing happens to him from this, things will go more easily.
Et curatio eius quod accidit ex illo est, ut coneris sedationem apostematis calidi: ita, ut ponas super Spondilem attritam oleum rosatum solum: aut cum uitellis oui assati.	And the treatment for him from this is to bring about a sweating after a cold bath: thus, as you put on Spondilem an ointment of rose oil only: or with some saffron or assa.
Pone super ipsam illud aliquotiens in die, donec quando sedatur apostema calidum: tum pone super locum unum ex emplastris confortantibus, exiccantibus, et stringe super ipsum cum ligamento: et praecipe infirmo, ut utatur quiete et tranquillitate.	Put on him sometimes in the day, until when the fever subsides: then put on one of the above-mentioned compresses, soothing, drying, and binding over him: and command the patient to remain quiet and calm
Nec dormiat super partem cum qua inuenit dolorem, donec sanetur.	He must not sleep over the part where the pain is, until it is healed.
Quod si accidit apud attritionem ossis sathaiatum, aut aliquid quod iam separatum fit ex eo: tunc oportet, ut seces super cutem, et auferas illud.	If this happens at a fracture of a sitting bone, or anything that is separated from it: then it is necessary to ligate over the skin, and elevate that
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, si est magnum, cum sutura.	Then gather up the two lips of the wound, if it is large, with a suture.</start_of_turn>
Deinde cura ipsum cum aliquo incarnatiuo, ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with some nourishment, from unguents, until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
Si uero frangitur postremum ossis alhausos, et est finis caudae: tunc oportet, ut intromittas pollicem manus sinistrae in anum, et aeques os fractum manu altera, secundum quod possibile est, et secunda aequatione.	If indeed the heel bone is fractured behind the ankle bone, and the end of the heel is: then it is necessary to insert the little finger of the left hand into the ankle, and equalize the fractured bone with the other, as much as possible, and with the second finger of the same hand.</start_of_turn
Deinde pone super ipsum, et aufer ipsum: et cura uulnus cum curatione quae praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then place over it, and elevate it: and care for the wound with the care that went before, until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
¶ De restauratione Anchae.	Regarding the restoration of the ankle.</start_of_turn>
Caput XI.	Chapter 11.</start_of_turn
Raro franguntur ossa Ancharum.	Rarely are the bones of the ankle fractured.</start_of_turn
Quod si franguntur, tunc fractura eorum non est, nisi comminutio in extremitatibus ipsorum: et scinduntur in longitudine, et declinantur ad interiora: et accidit infirmo dolor in loco, et punctura: et stupescit crus quod frangitur.	If they are fractured, then the fracture of them is not, except for the fracture of the extremities: and they are split in length, and bent inwards: and there is pain in the place, and swelling: and the leg that is fractured is stiffened.</start_of_turn
Et restauratio quidem eius est, ut extendas manum tuam super ipsum, donec stes super fracturam qualiter est figura eius.	And the restoration of it is that you extend your hand over it, until you are over the fracture as well as its figure.</start_of_turn
Quod si fractura est in extremitatibus eius tantum, tunc aequa illam fracturam, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ex aequatione, donec assimiletur figurae suae naturali.	If the fracture is only in the extremities of it, then equalize it with the other, according to what is prepared from the equation, until the figure of it is equal to its natural figure.</start_of_turn
Si autem fractura est in longitudine, aut iam declinat ad interiora: tunc fac iacere infirmum super uentrem suum, donec praeparetur tibi restauratio illius fracturae.	If, however, the fracture is longitudinal, or if it has inclined inwards, then make the patient lie upon his belly, until such time as preparation for the restoration of the fracture is complete.
Quando ergo aequaueris ipsam, pone super ipsam emplastrum: deinde pone super ipsam astellam ex ligno, aut ex cute: et stringe strictura super quam non timeas permutationem fracturae, neque remotionem astellae.	When the fracture has become even, place upon it a dressing: then place upon it a splint of wood or skin: and bind tightly what you fear may cause displacement of the fracture, and not its removal.</start_of_turn>
Et aequa concauitatem illorum cum eo quod impleat eam, donec capiat eam strictura secundum aequalitatem: et praecipe infirmo, ut dormiat super dorsum suum, aut super latus suum sanum.	And equalize the swelling of them with that which supports the limb: until you have taken hold of the limb firmly: and command the patient to rest upon his back, or upon his side, on the sound side.</start_of_turn>
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc cessa ab extensione eius, et ipsius restauratione, donec sedetur apostema calidum: et pone super ipsum quod sedet ipsum, secundum quod praecessit, deinde redi ad restaurationem eius: et stringe ipsum sicut oportet.	If, however, there be a soft swelling: then cease from its extension, and from its restoration, until the swelling has subsided: and place upon it that which has subsided, according to what has gone before, then return to the restoration of it: and bind it as you think proper.</start_of_turn
Si uero accidit in osse satagie, aut comminuitur, extrahe.	If indeed it has happened in a bone of the limb, or is fractured, extract it.</start_of_turn>
¶ De restauratione fracturae Adiutorii.	Note: The translation of the remaining portion of the text is not included in the provided text.
Caput XII.	Chapter XII.</start_of_turn
Adiutorium est illud, quod est inter cubitum usque ad caput Spatulae.	The aid is that which is between the armpit up to the head of the scapula.</start_of_turn
Si ergo frangitur, tunc restauratio eius est secundum unum duorum modorum.	If indeed it is fractured, then the restoration of it is according to one of two methods.</start_of_turn
Quorum unus est: ut accipias lignum planum mediae grossitudinis, secundum hanc formam, quae sequitur.	One of them is: take a flat piece of wood of medium thickness, according to this form which follows.</start_of_turn
Et ligentur in duabus extremitatibus duo ligamenta.	And join together at the two extremities two ligatures.</start_of_turn
Deinde suspendatur ex loco eleuato: et sedeat infirmus super sedem.	Then suspend from a high place: and let the patient sit down.</start_of_turn
Deinde proiiciat brachium suum fractum super lignum, donec perueniat ad titillicum eius, in cuius medio sit annexa curuitas ligni.	Then he throws his arm broken over a stick until it reaches its elbow, in which middle there is an attached splinter of wood.
Deinde suspende desuper ipsum aliquid graue, ut extendat ipsum minister ad inferiora.	Then he hangs it [the limb] heavily from above, so as to extend its minister downwards.
Deinde aequet medicus fracturam manibus suis simul, donec redeat fractura, secundum quod oportet.	Then the doctor will grasp the fracture with his hands simultaneously, until the fracture is reduced, as is appropriate.
Et modus alter est, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et suspende manum eius a collo ipsius cum ligamento.	And another way is that the patient lies upon his cushion: and he hangs his arm from the neck down with the ligament.
Deinde praecipe duobus ministris, ut teneat unus eorum illud quod est supra fracturam cum manibus suis: et ut alter teneat inferius eius, et extendat unusquisque eorum ad partem suam.	Then command two assistants, that one hold that which is above the fracture with his hands: and that the other hold the lower part, and extend each one to his side
Et si uis, ut sit extensio fortior, tunc stringe sub fractura cum ligamento, et supra ipsam cum ligamento alio: et extendat ea unusquisque duorum ministrorum ad duas partes suas.	And if you wish, so that the extension be stronger, then bind under the fracture with a ligament, and over it with another ligament: and extend both of them by two assistants to two parts
Si ergo fractura est propinqua extremitati humeri, tunc oportet, ut ponatur unum ligamentum sub titillico, et alterum sub fractura uersus cubitum.	If therefore the fracture is close to the elbow, then it is necessary that one bind one ligament under the elbow and the other under the fracture over the elbow
Et similiter si fractura est propinqua cubito: tunc oportet, ut ponatur ligamentum super illum locum, et super cubitum ipsum.	And in the same way if the fracture is close to the forearm: then it is necessary that one bind a ligament above the place and over the forearm itself
Deinde aequa fracturam cum facilitate absque labore, donec quando aequatur fractura secundum quod oportet, et applicatur applicatione bona: tunc stringe eam, si non accidit apostema calidum.	Then reduce the fracture with ease without toil, until when the fracture is equal according to what is appropriate, and a good application is applied: then bind it, if it does not happen spontaneously after the swelling has gone down
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam usque ad diem septimum.	But if swelling should happen, then loosen the binding until the seventh day.
Et pone super ipsum lanam succidam imbibitam in aceto et oleo rosato, donec quando quiescit apostema: tunc stringe eam: et modus stringendi eam est, ut ponas emplastrum super fracturam.	And place upon it a wet bandage dipped in vinegar in aceto and rose oil, until when the swelling has subsided: then bind it again: and the way of binding it is that you place an plaster over the fracture.
Deinde pone inuolutionem ex panno nouo super emplastrum.	Then place a new bandage over the dressing.
Deinde aggreget brachium super adiutorium ipsum, et ponat manum suam apertam super humerum suum.	Then fix the arm to the aid, and place your hand open over your shoulder
Et pone pannum, et stringe super adiutorium brachium, ut brachium stet loco astellarum: si non prohibet te ab illo aliquid, neque alteretur super te aliquid ex osse fracto.	And place a pad, and bind the arm to the aid, so that the arm rests in the place of the fractured bones: if it does not hinder you from anything, do not alter anything over you concerning the fractured bone
Quod si times, quod alteretur super te ex osse fracto aliquid, tunc utere astellis: et est, ut ponas super fracturam ipsam astellam quae sit latior et fortior reliquis astellis.	For if at any time something is altered over you from the fractured bone, then put over the fracture a larger and stronger bandage than the rest.
Et ponas inter omnem astellam latitudinem digiti: et sit longitudo astellarum secundum fracturam cum additione trium digitorum ab omni parte.	And lay between every bandage a width of a finger: and let the length of the bandages be according to the fracture with the addition of three fingers from every side.
Deinde stringe super astellas strictura quam dixi in principio capituli.	Then bind over the bandages tightly as I said at the beginning of this chapter.
Et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae strictior.	And it is necessary that your binding over the fracture be tighter.
Et quanto plus elongatur fractura, sit strictura minor.	And the more the fracture is prolonged, the tighter the binding should be
Si ergo uides situm astellarum et stricturam, sicut diximus, in hora qua restauras membrum statim, tunc fac: et si times apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam et astellas usque ad diem septimum, sicut diximus.	If therefore you have put the bandages in their place and the binding, as we have said, when you restore the limb immediately, then do this: if the swelling is cold, then remove the binding and bandages until the seventh day, as we have said
Deinde considera ligamentum in omnibus tribus diebus, ut non accidat in loco pruritus, aut inflatio, aut prohibeatur cibus peruenire ad membrum, propter dispositionem superfluitatis stricturae.	Then consider the ligament in all three days, so that it does not happen in the place of itching, or swelling, or that it should be hindered from nourishing the limb, by the disposition of the excessive binding.
Rectifica ergo illud totum, secundum quod diximus.	Rectify therefore all this, according to what we have said.
Si uero es super fiduciam, ut non accidat ex illo aliquid: tunc non soluas ligamentum, nisi post tres dies, aut plus.	If indeed you are over confident, that nothing will happen from this: then do not loosen the ligament, except after three days, or more
Et sit dormitio infirmi super dorsum suum, et manus eius super stomachum suum: et pone sub adiutorio culcitram plenam lana aequaliter.	And let the patient's sleep rest upon his back, and his hand upon his stomach: and place under the aid of the culcita a full bladder of wool equally.
Et considera in omni hora noctis, aut diei, ut non soluatur figura membri fracta, aut mollificetur ligamentum.	Consider at all times of night or day that the fractured limb should not be allowed to slip, nor the ligament be strained.
Rectifica ergo illud totum uirtute tua.	Correct therefore all this with your might
Et pone cibum infirmi secundum ordinem quem praemisimus, ita ut sit cibus subtilis in primis, donec incipiat os stringi: tunc oportet, ut ingrosses cibum eius.	And place food for the patient according to the order which we have mentioned, so that the food be soft in the beginning, until the bone has begun to knit: then it is necessary that he should eat of solid food
De consuetudine enim adiutorii et cruris est, ut stringatur in quadraginta diebus: tunc ergo oportet, ut soluatur, et administretur balneum, et medicetur cum unguentis quae rectificant illud.	Concerning the custom of the attendants and the legs it is necessary that they be bound for forty days: then it is necessary that they be loosened, and a bath be administered, and unguents be applied which will repair that
Quod si fractura fuerit foeda, attrita: tunc non soluas ab ea ligamentum et astellas usque ad quinquaginta dies, et usque ad duos menses.	If the fracture should be dirty or raw: do not loosen it from that ligament and the bones until the fiftieth day, and until two months.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Brachii.	Of the restoration of a fractured arm.
Caput XIII.	(The text continues with further instructions on treating fractures of the arm.)
Brachium est compositum ex duobus ossibus, quae nominantur duo focilia.	The arm is composed of two bones which are called two radii
Quorum unum est paruum: et est illud quod sequitur pollicem.	One of them is the ulna: and that which follows the thumb
Et alterum est magnum, et est illud quod est positum sub paruo ab inferiori parte.	And the other is the radius, which is placed under the ulna from the lower part
Fortasse ergo frangitur focile maius solum, aut paruum: et fortasse franguntur simul.	Perhaps therefore the greater bone is fractured alone, or the forearm: and perhaps both together
Quando ergo frangitur focile paruum superius, tunc restauratio eius est facilis, et sanatio eius est facilior.	When therefore the upper bone of the forearm is fractured, then its restoration is easy, and its healing is more readily accomplished
Et quando frangitur focile inferius, est fractura eius mala, et sanatio eius difficilis.	And when the lower bone is fractured, the fracture is bad, and the healing is difficult
Et deterior ea est, quando franguntur duo ossa simul.	And it is worse when two bones are fractured together.
Si ergo os quod frangitur est focile parum superius, tunc conuenit medico apud restaurationem eius, ut ponat extensionem paruam cum facilitate, donec aequet ipsum.	If any bone which is fractured is slightly above the socket, then the physician must be present at its restoration, in order to place the surrounding soft parts easily in their proper position until it becomes equal again.</start_of_turn>
Si uero focile magnum est illud quod fractum est: tunc oportet, ut ponat stricturam fortiorem ualde.	If the bone which is fractured is large: then it is necessary to place a stronger support around it.</start_of_turn>
Et oportet, ut ponat figuram manus apud restaurationem eius, et ipsius extensionem extensam super puluinar.	It is also necessary to place the figure of the hand at the restoration of its extension, and the extension of the limb itself.</start_of_turn
Et sit pollex manus ad superiora altior omnibus digitis: et sit articularis inferior omnibus digitis, uel reliquis: et infirmus sedens quadratus super seipsum, et sit puluinar coram eo, uel in directo eius, in altitudine, ut non incurrat infirmus laborem.	And let the thumb of the hand be above the level of all the fingers: and let the lower articulation be below all the fingers, or the rest: and the limb shall sit square on itself, and let the pulse be in front of it, or in a line with it, in height, so that the limb does not suffer any damage.</start_of_turn>
Deinde extendat minister Brachium ab inferiori parte, aut manu sua, aut cum ligamento.	Then extend the limb from the lower part, or from the hand itself, or with the ligament.</start_of_turn
Et minister alius extendat desuper similiter.	And the other limb extends in the same way from above.</start_of_turn
Deinde aequet medicus os, donec reducat ipsum secundum meliorem figuram quam potest.	And the physician must equal the bones until they are reduced to a better figure than before.</start_of_turn
Quod si in fractura ossis sunt satagiae, tunc conare reducere omne frustum in loco suo uirtute tua.	And if there are gaps in the fracture of the bone, then attempt to reduce all the fragments to their proper place with your art.</start_of_turn
Si uero apparet in eo sathaiatum separatum, et pungit cutem, et non est tibi spes in restauratione eius: tunc finde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum secundum modum quem diximus in eis quae praemissa sunt.	If indeed there appears in it a separated fragment, and it has burst through the skin, and there is no hope of restoring it: then find above it, and remove it according to the manner which we mentioned previously.</start_of_turn
Si autem fractura est cum uulnere, ego iam feci ad illud capitulum singulare, ergo accipe curationem illius inde.	If indeed the fracture is with a wound, I make of that the head alone, so take care of it from that moment on.</start_of_turn
Quod si accidat in principio tuae restaurationis apostema calidum, tunc line pannum cum caeroto facto ex oleo rosato, et caera alba, et sit medium inter spissitudinem et subtilitatem: et stringe pannum super ipsum strictura subtili, donec quando sedatur apostema: tunc remoue caerotum, et pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum albumine oui.	If the heel of your foot be stiff at the commencement of your restoration, then draw a line round the foot with a blunt instrument, from the outer corner to the inner corner: and let it be of medium thickness between breadth and fineness. And string the line above the greatest tension below, until when the heel is settled: then move the blunt instrument away and apply a plaster made from ground barley with albumin.
Deinde pone astellas, et sit astella quae ponitur super fracturam ipsam latior parumper, et fortior.	Then place sponges, and let the sponge which is placed above the fracture be broader and stronger on the wider side
Et scias, quod numerus astellarum Brachii est sex in pluribus dispositionibus: siue sit fractura in focili uno, aut in duobus focilibus simul.	And know that the number of sponges for the arm is six in various positions: if the fracture be in one socket, or in two sockets together.
Deinde pone stricturam tuam super locum fracturae fortiorem et uehementiorem, et aliquanto plus cum strictura ad superiora fracturae, aut ad inferiora eius: aut pone stricturam molliorem strictura eius parumper, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius in principio capituli.	Then place your bandage securely over the fracture, stronger and more tightly, and somewhat more tightly above the fracture, or below it: or place a softer bandage below the fracture, as it is remembered in the beginning of the chapter
Et sint panni qui inuoluuntur super fracturam, panni lenes, humidi: et non sint duri, asperi.	And let there be cloths which cover the fracture, soft cloths, moist: and not hard, rough.
Et sit filum quo stringitur ex lino proprie, medium inter subtile et grossum, sicut narrauimus.	And let the thread which is used for stitching be of medium thickness between fine and coarse, as we have narrated.
Et considera membrum et ligamentum post dies.	Consider the limb and the ligament after days.
Quod si accidat aliquid cuius rectificatio sit necessaria, sicut pruritus qui accidit membro: tunc oportet, ut embroces membrum cum aqua calefacta, donec quiescat ille pruritus, et dimittas membrum non constrictum, donec quiescat, deinde itera stricturam.	If anything happens which requires rectification, such as itching which occurs to the limb: then it is necessary to wet the limb with warm water, until the itching subsides, and to loosen the limb, until it is quiet, and repeat the bandage.
Quod si strictura iam mollificata est, et os iam remotum, et similia illis: tunc rectifica illud totum uirtute tua, et considera iterum.	If the bandage has been softened, and the bone has been removed, and things are similar to these: then rectify all this with your might, and consider again.
Nam si nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad membrum, propter superfluitatem stricturae, tunc oportet, ut mollifices ipsum parumper, et dimittas ipsum aliquot diebus, donec currat ad ipsum nutrimentum, deinde stringe ipsum.	For if the nourishment is hindered from reaching the limb, because of the excess of the bandage, then it is necessary to soften it somewhat, and to loosen it a little every day, until the nourishment reaches it again, and then tighten it again
Si autem non accidit infirmo aliquid eorum quae diximus, tunc non oportet, ut soluatur, nisi post uiginti dies, aut circiter hos.	If, however, no alleviation has occurred the sick person with anything we have said, then it is not necessary to solve the matter, except after twenty days, or thereabouts.
Deinde suspendatur manus infirmi ad collum eius.	The hand of the sick person is suspended until his condition improves or worsens after twenty days.
Et sit collum eius aequale, et custodiatur uirtute sua a motibus agitatiuis.	Let his condition be equal, and his spirit be guarded from disturbing matters.
Et fac eum dormire super dorsum suum.	Let him sleep on his back.
Et scias, quod haec fractura in triginta diebus, aut in triginta duobus diebus restauratur: et fortasse restauratur in uigintiocto diebus.	Know that this fracture will be healed in thirty days, or perhaps in thirty-two days: and possibly in eighty days
Totum illud est secundum dispositiones complexionum, et dispositiones uirtutis.	All this is according to the temperaments of the complexion and the spirit's temperaments
¶ De restauratione fracturarum Manus.	On the restoration of fractures of the hand.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter 123.</start_of_turn>
Scias, quod pectini Manus, et nodis digitorum raro accidit fractura.	Know that the bones of the hand and the joints of the fingers are rarely fractured
Et non accidit ei, nisi attritio multotiens.	Except for severe attrition.</start_of_turn>
Quando ergo accidit plantae fractura, aut attritio: tunc oportet, ut sedeat infirmus quadratus: et coram eo sit sedes secundum aequalitatem.	When the bone of the foot is fractured, or there is attrition: then it is necessary that the sick person sit square: and before him be a seat equal in height.</start_of_turn>
Deinde pone Manum eius super eam extensam.	Then put his hand on his extended arm.</start_of_turn
Deinde extendat minister ossa fracta, et aequet ea medicus, donec quando coniunguntur coniunctione bona.	Then extend the fractured bones, and keep them even with the doctor, until they are united together soundly.</start_of_turn
Tunc oportet, ut ponat emplastrum et stuppam, si non accidat apostema calidum.	Then it is necessary to put on a plaster and a bandage, if the swelling does not go down.</start_of_turn
Deinde pone astellam desuper secundum quantitatem loci: et tu iam inuoluisti eam in panno lini.	Then put on a bandage above and below according to the quantity of the place: and I will cover the hand with a linen cloth.</start_of_turn
Si autem fractura est ad inferiora circiter uentrem plantae, tunc fac simile spherae ex panno: et praecipe infirmo, ut coartet super eam cum planta sua fracta: deinde stringatur cum panno longo.	If, however, the fracture is towards the lower parts round about the sole of the foot, then make like a sphere of cloth: and command the patient to press against it with his foot fractured: then it shall be bound with a long cloth.
Et sit astella ex corio, in quo sit lenitas, ut applicetur corium cum corpore plantae: et stringe eam, secundum quod oportet.	And let there be a cushion of skin, in which there is softness, to be applied to the skin with the foot: and bind it up, according as it may be necessary.
Si autem fractura est ad exteriora, tunc oportet: ut ponas astellam desuper, et astellam aliam ab inferiori in planta: et sit manus aperta recta.	If, however, the fracture is towards the outside, then it is necessary: that you place a cushion above and a cushion below in the foot: and let the open hand be straight.
Deinde pone stricturam, sicut reuoluitur manus: et extende inter digitos cum ligamento.	Then put on a bandage, as it is turned round: and extend between the fingers with the ligament.
Quod si accidat fractura alicui nodorum digitorum, tunc si est pollex, aequetur secundum quod oportet.	And if it happens that there is a fracture of any bone of the fingers, then if it is the thumb, it is to be equaled according as it may be necessary.
Deinde stringatur cum planta: et si amas, pone ei astellam rectam, paruam: ut eleuetur fractura, et non moueatur.	Then it is to be bound up with the foot: and if there is swelling, put upon it a straight cushion, firm: that the fracture may be raised up, and not moved.
Si autem fractura est reliquis digitis, sicut medio, et indici, aut auriculari, et anulari, tunc aequetur, et ligetur cum digito sano qui sequitur eum: aut ligentur omnes secundum continuationem: et est melius.	If, however, the fracture is of the remaining fingers, such as the middle, and index, or the ring, and little finger, then it is to be equaled, and bound up with the healthy finger which follows it: or they are to be bound up all together: and that is better
Aut pone super ipsum astellam paruam, sicut diximus in pollice.	Or put upon it a firm cushion above it, as we said concerning the thumb.
Et considera in restauratione tua, et post ipsam dispositionem apostematis calidi: et oppone cum eo quod oportet, quando accidit aliquid ex illo, secundum quod iteratur eius narratio.	And consider in your restoration, and after the setting has been made, a warm compress: and oppose with it whatever is necessary, when anything of this kind happens, according as its narration returns
¶ De restauratione fracturae Coxae.	Of the restoration of the fracture of the thigh.
Caput XV.	Chapter 15.
OS Coxae multotiens frangitur, et declaratur sensui: quoniam conuertitur ad interiorem et posteriorem partem.	The hip bone is fractured in many places, and is declared to the sense: because it curves inwards and outwards to the interior and exterior parts.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, quod stringitur ligamentum supra fracturam, et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	Its restoration is done in this way, that it stretches the ligament above the fracture, and the ligament below the fracture.</start_of_turn>
Et infirmus prostretur super faciem suam.	And the patient is supported over his face.</start_of_turn>
Deinde extendat omne ligamentum minister ad partem suam secundum aequalitatem: et hoc, quando est fractura in medio ossis.	Then let all the ligaments around the part be stretched out according to their equal parts: and this when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.</start_of_turn
Si autem est fractura propinqua radici Coxae, tunc sit ligamentum ad partem pectinis, ut cadat extensio ad sursum: et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	If however the fracture is close to the root of the hip bone, then let the ligament be at the part of the pelvis, so that the extension goes upwards: and the other ligament below the fracture.</start_of_turn
Et sic similiter si est fractura propinqua genu, tunc sit ligamentum propinquum genu, ut sit extensio ad inferiora.	And thus in the same way if the fracture is close to the knee, then let the ligament be close to the knee, so that the extension be downwards.</start_of_turn
Deinde aequet medicus os utriusque manibus suis, donec reducat ipsum secundum similitudinem figurae naturalis: et coniugatur os coniunctione bona.	Then the doctor must support the bone with both hands, until it is reduced to its natural shape: and it is joined together by a good junction.</start_of_turn
Tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum et stricturam, si non accidit membro apostema.	Then it is necessary to apply plaster and bandage, if the limb is not immediately whole.</start_of_turn>
Quod si accidat in eo apostema: tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur apostema calidum, deinde redi ad curationem tuam.	And if this happens in the case of fracture: then let it be left for a few days, until the fracture is cold, then return to your care.</start_of_turn
Strictura autem eius ita sit.	The bandage must be tight.</start_of_turn
Oportet ut inuoluas super fracturam imema duram, id est, bindam: et dupla eam bis, aut ter: et remaneat ex ea superfluitas.	It is necessary to cover over the fracture with soft material, that is, padding: and double it twice, or three times: and leave out from this excess.</start_of_turn
Deinde inuolue crus, donec perueniat calcaneus apud radicem natis.	Then cover the thigh, until the heel reaches the root of the nail.</start_of_turn
Et intromitte filum longum inter Coxam et crus prope genu ad inferiora, et ueniant extremitates fili a superiori parte duarum partium.	And insert the long thread between the hip and the thigh near the knee downwards, and the extremities of the thread come from the upper part of the two parts.
Deinde reuolue super Crus et Coxam quod superfluit ex alimema.	Then twist over the thigh and hip what remains from the other side.</start_of_turn>
Deinde pone super Coxam in loco fracturae ipsius astellas, et pone ex eis astellam unam super os cruris.	Then place upon the hip in the place of the fracture its own nails, and place one nail outside the bone of the thigh.</start_of_turn
Deinde imple uacuitates inter crus et coxam cum pannis lenibus, ut aequetur strictura.	Then tighten between the thigh and hip with soft cloths, so as to make the bandage even.</start_of_turn>
Deinde incipe cum strictura forti a medio super locum fracturae tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor.	Then commence with a firm bandage from the middle over the place of the fracture three or four times.</start_of_turn
Et quanto plus elongaris cum ligamento a loco fracturae, sit strictura tua minor et mollior, et lenior.	And as much as you lengthen with the ligament from the place of the fracture, make your bandage less tight and softer, and more gentle.</start_of_turn>
Deinde intende ad duas extremitates fili, quod tu intromisisti inter coxam et crus.	And take hold of the two extremities of the thread which you inserted between the hip and thigh.</start_of_turn
Liga ergo cum utrisque tres astellas quae sunt desuper.	Tie thus with both three nails which are above.</start_of_turn
Deinde uade cum duabus extremitatibus fili ad inferiora, donec peruenias ad cauillam pedis.	Then draw downwards with both extremities of the thread until you reach the heel of the foot.</start_of_turn
Et cum utrisque stringe etiam extremitates astellarum a parte altera: ut non remoueatur ligamentum ex loco suo.	And when you have drawn down both strings also the extremities of the nails from the other side: so that the ligament does not move from its place.</start_of_turn
Deinde dimitte stricturam super illud, dum permanet, ita quod non accidat membro corrosio, neque apostema, neque inflatio, et similia eis.	Then release the bandage from that which remains, while it remains, so that it does not cause a fracture of the limb, nor swelling, nor inflation, or anything similar to these.</start_of_turn
Quod si accidat aliquid ex illo.	For if anything should happen from this.</start_of_turn
Propera ergo cum solutione eius, et rectifica illud quod accidit inde totum, secundum quod diximus multotiens.	Prepare thus with its solution, and rectify that which happened from this, as we said many times.</start_of_turn>
Si uero in osse est frustum ex osse quod pungat: tunc oportet, ut aeques illud, si est tibi possibile.	If indeed in the bone there is a fragment of bone which projects: then it is necessary, if possible, to remove that which projects.
Et si non, finde super illud, et remoue illud: et cura cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio, donec sanetur.	If not, find above that [fragment] and remove that: and care for that with which it is preceded until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
Et quandoque stringitur haec fractura Coxae, praeter quod addantur ei astellae, sicut diximus in adiutorio et brachio.	And when the fracture of the thigh is reduced, besides that we add to it pins, as we said in the treatise on the arm and the forearm.</start_of_turn>
Verumtamen in restauratione eius taliter fracta, non accidit infirmo claudicatio.	However, in the restoration of that [fracture], it does not happen that the cripple remains lame.</start_of_turn
Et si restauratur sola, praeter quod applicetur ei crus alterum, tunc necesse est, ut claudicet ille cuius est, semper.	And if it is restored alone, besides that the other limb is applied, then it is necessary that the lame limb should be lame for a while.</start_of_turn
Et scias, quod Coxa stringitur in quinquaginta diebus, uel additur parum, aut minuitur parum: totum illud est secundum diuersitatem complexionum, et reliquarum dispositionum.	And you know that the thigh is reduced in fifty days, or is added a little, or diminished a little: all this is according to the diversity of complexions and the remaining dispositions.</start_of_turn
¶ De restauratione fracturae Rotulae genu.	(The text continues with instructions regarding the restoration of fractures of the knee.)</start_of_turn>
Caput XVI.	Chapter XVI.</start_of_turn>
Scias, quod Rotulae genu raro accidit fractura, sed accidit ei attritio multotiens.	You know that fractures of the knee are rarely seen, but that there is often a great attrition of it.</start_of_turn
Si uero accidit ei fractura, tunc non nisi aut fissura, aut foramen in partibus suis.	If indeed it happens that there is a fracture, then it is not without a fissure or a hole in the parts.</start_of_turn
Et est illud cum uulnere, et absque uulnere.	And it is like a wound and without a wound.</start_of_turn
Et statur super illud totum cum sensu.	And it remains upon it all with sense.</start_of_turn
Et restauratio eius est ita, ut aequetur quod disruptum est ex partibus eius cum digitis, donec aggregetur, et coniungatur secundum quod possibile est ex aequatione et facilitate, et fabricatione.	And its restoration is in this way, that it be equated with that which was disrupted from its parts with the digits, until it is reunited and joined according to what is possible from equality and facility, and fabrication.</start_of_turn
Deinde pone emplastrum ex farina sisami, uel molendini, cum albumine oui: et pone super ipsum astellam rotundam, si indiges illa: et stringe desuper strictura conueniente ad illud.	Then place a plaster of poppyseed or oatmeal with albumin on it, and put above it a round sponge, if it is necessary: and bind tightly around it with a bandage suitable for that.
Deinde considera omnes dispositiones quas narrauimus in reliquis fracturis: sicut apostema calidum, et similia illi: ita, ut opponas omni accidenti cum eo quod conuenit ei, donec sanetur.	Consider all the positions mentioned in other fractures: such as a cold abscess and the like: thus, that you may oppose every chance with what is suitable for it until it is healed
¶ De restauratione fracturae Cruris.	On the restoration of a fractured limb.
Caput XVII.	Chapter XVII.</start_of_turn>
Scias, quod Cruri sunt duo ossa, quorum unum est grossum, et nominatur nomine Cruris: et alterum subtile, et nominatur Focile.	You know that the leg consists of two bones, of which one is thick and is called the Cruris: and the other is thin and is called the Focile.</start_of_turn>
Et accidit utrisque ex speciebus fracturae quod accidit duobus ossibus brachii: et propter illud fit restauratio eius, sicut restauratio brachii aequaliter, et operatio est una.	And it happens with both kinds of fracture that happen to both bones of the forearm: and because of this it is restored in the same way as the forearm, and the operation is the same.</start_of_turn
Quod si franguntur duo ossa simul, conuertitur Crus ad omnes partes.	If both bones are fractured together, the Cruris turns towards all parts.</start_of_turn
Et si frangitur os subtilius, conuertitur Crus ad anteriorem partem.	If the thin bone is fractured, the Cruris turns towards the anterior part.</start_of_turn
Et si frangitur os grossius, inuenis illud inferius: et est ex eis quae non occultantur tibi.	If the thick bone is fractured, you will find it below: and it is from this that the limb is not hidden.</start_of_turn
Deinde administra extensionem, et aequationem, et ligationem astellarum secundum illud aequaliter.	Then manage extension, and equality, and ligation of the sponges according to that.</start_of_turn
Verumtamen oportet, si fractura Cruris est fractura foeda, habens sethagie multa: ut sit extensio minor, et lenior alleuiatione tua.	However, if the fracture of the Cruris is a compound fracture, having many pieces: so that the extension is less, and the alleviation more gentle.</start_of_turn
Et in Crure quidem est ex operatione quiddam super brachium: et est, ut quando tu aequas astellas, et comples omnem operationem tuam, tunc accipe duas fascias ex ligno pini, quod administratur in fabricatione solariorum quod ponitur sub tabulis: et fiunt ex spatulis palmae: et elige ex eis quibus est grossitudo parua, et neque sint ex minutis: et sit longitudo earum secundum longitudinem Cruris a genu usque inferius.	And in the leg there is something more than in the arm: and that is, when you have equaled the sponges, and completed all your operation, then take two bands of pine wood which are used in the making of sandals which are placed under the boards: and they are made from the ends of palm leaves: and choose from those which are of small size, and neither are they of large size: and let their length be according to the length of the leg from the knee down.</start_of_turn
Deinde inuolue super unamquamque pannum duabus inuolutionibus secundum longitudinem eius.	Then stretch over one-fourth of the length of the wound two layers of packing.
Et pone unam partem Cruris a parte una, et alteram a parte altera: et sint ex genu usque inferius pedis.	And place one part of the limb from the one side from the knee to the foot, and the other part from the other side: and they should be from the knee down to the foot
Deinde liga duas fascias in tribus locis ex duabus extremitatibus et medio.	Then bind two layers together in three places from the two extremities and the middle.
Cum enim strictura prohibetur, Crus declinat ad dextram et sinistram, et stat statione bona.	When the tightening prohibits, the limb bends to the right and left, and remains in a good position.
Et iam quidem administretur cunabulum ex ligno secundum longitudinem Cruris, et ponatur in eo Crus, ut conseruet ipsum a motu.	And then a bandage of wood is administered according to the length of the limb, and is placed on the limb so as to maintain it from movement.
Et plurimum quidem oportet, ut facias illud in fractura quando cum ea est uulnus proprie.	And above all it is necessary, so that you make it firm when the limb is fractured on its own
Deinde considera Crus in omni die, et stude cum eo studio ultimo ab apostemate, aut inflatione, aut reliquis aliis.	Then consider the limb every day, and study it with great care from the swelling, or the pus, or any other thing
Si ergo accidit aliquid ex illis, tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur, si Deus uoluerit.	If anything of this happens, then oppose it with what is necessary, until it is healed, if God wills it.
De fractura ossium Pedis, et Digitorum.	Of fractures of the bones of the foot and fingers.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter XVIII.
Calcaneo quidem non accidit fractura penitus.	The heel does not usually fracture completely
Ossibus uero Pedis accidit quandoque fractura, et Digitis parum etiam accidit fractura: et non accidit eis nisi attritio in pluribus dispositionibus.	The bones of the foot sometimes fracture when the fracture is complete, and the bones of the fingers are sometimes fractured: and they do not fracture except through attrition in many postures.
Quod si accidit ossibus Pedis fractura, et uides illa ossa sublimari super se adinuicem, tunc ponat infirmus Pedem suum super terram praeparatam, sicut ambulans.	If the bones of the foot fracture, and you wish to elevate them above the level of the heart, then place the patient's foot on the prepared earth, like a walker
Deinde sta tu, et pone Pedem tuum super illud quod eleuatur ex illis ossibus: postea preme, uel calca eam: et aequa ipsam, donec redeat in locis suis.	Then stand still, and place your foot on that which you wish to elevate from these bones: then press, or put on a shoe: and keep it even, until it returns to its place
Deinde pone emplastrum, et stuppam desuper: et pone sub uentre Pedis tabulam paruam, cui sint duo capita plana.	Then place the plaster on, and raise the dressing above: and place under the foot a board having two flat heads.
Deinde stringe eam cum Pede strictura decenti, postquam tu inuoluis eam cum pannis, et reliquis quibus indiget.	Then bind the plaster securely with the foot in a proper position, after you have enclosed it with cloth and the rest as needed.</start_of_turn>
Cum ergo praetereunt ei tres dies, aut quatuor, tunc solue ligamentum.	When three or four days have passed, then loosen the ligament.</start_of_turn>
Nam tu inuenies ossa aequata, siue sint fracta, aut sint dislocata.	For indeed you will find the bone even and not fractured, or dislocated.</start_of_turn
Operatio ergo in eis est, sicut uides.	The operation is like that of water.</start_of_turn
Si autem franguntur aliqui digiti, tunc restaura eos, et aequa ipsos secundum quod narraui tibi in restauratione digitorum manus.	If, however, any finger is fractured, then restore these also, and make them even as I have said in the restoration of the fingers of the hand.</start_of_turn>
Deinde pone digito tuo astellam secundum longitudinem digiti, et sit latior eo parumper: deinde pone sub Pede hanc tabulam quam narraui tibi, et stringe eam strictura decenti.	Then place under the foot a board having the length of the finger, and wider than before: then place under the foot the board which I have mentioned above, and bind the finger securely.</start_of_turn
Si uero quod frangitur ex ossibus est duo, aut tria, aut plus, tunc pone super omnem digitum astellam suae quantitatis, inuolutam in panno lini: et stringe tabulam in inferiori Pedis: et sit stans super unum capitum tabulae extra uentrem Pedis, ut teneat retentione bona.	If indeed it is broken from the bones are two, or three, or more, then place over every finger a bandage of its own quantity, enclosed in cloth: and bind the board under the foot: and let one head of the board rest outside the foot, so that it may hold the good retention.</start_of_turn
Et conuenit tibi, ut non obliuiscaris, quin consideres omnia quae dixi tibi in reliquis fracturis ex accidentibus quae diximus: et oppone omni accidenti cum eo quod oportet.	And it befits you to remember, that you must consider all that I have said concerning the other fractures from accidents which we have mentioned: and oppose every accident with what is necessary.</start_of_turn
¶ De fractura Vuluae mulieris, et ossis pectinis, et uirgae uiri.	Concerning the fracture of the woman's vulva, and the bone of the thigh, and the swelling of the man.</start_of_turn
Caput XIX.	Chapter XIX.</start_of_turn>
Quando frangitur Vulua mulieris, tunc fac eam sedere quadratam.	When the woman's vulva is fractured, then make her sit in a square position.</start_of_turn
Deinde inclina eam ad partem dorsi ipsius parumper, et teneatur retro.	Then incline the body towards the part of the back which is lower, and keep it firm behind.
Deinde impleat obstetrix Vuluam eius coto, donec impleat eam: et fiat in Vulua ex eo sicut sphera.	Then let the physician place his thumb on the lower part of the flank, until he grasps the body: and let him make the body spherical from that point on
Deinde concutiatur mulier, et eleua dorsum eius paulatim.	Then the woman should be braced, and the back should be lifted slowly.
Illud enim cotum egreditur, donec fiat ante portam Vuluae sicut sphera, et os fractum redit.	For the thigh will come out, until the body becomes like a sphere in front of the Vulva, and the fracture will be healed.
Deinde pone puluillum super dorsum eius.	Then put a cushion over the back of it.
Quando ergo uult mingere, remoueat cotum cum facilitate, deinde mingat: et reduc ipsum secundum modum, quo intromisisti ipsum in primis: deinde redeat ad puluillum suum primum.	When he wishes to drink, move the thigh easily, then drink: and reduce it in the same manner as you put it in at the beginning: and return to his cushion first
Faciat illud septem diebus, aut circiter, os ipsum enim restauratur.	Do this for seven days, or thereabouts: the bone will be restored thus
Et si uis, accipe uesicam ouis, et stringe super foramen eius cannulam arundinis, et intromitte uesicam totam in Vuluam eius.	And if necessary, take an egg or an ostrich egg, and tie a thread over the hole of its wound, and insert the whole egg into the Vulva.
Deinde suffla in cannulam cum uirtute, donec infletur uesica intra Vuluam, fractura enim redit.	Then blow through the thread with vinegar, until the egg is inflated inside the Vulva, and the fracture will be healed
Deinde impleatur cum coto, et stet aliquot diebus, secundum quod narrauimus, donec sanetur.	Then keep it like this for a while, for a few days, as we have said, until it is healed
Et quando frangitur os Pectinis uiri, aut mulieris, tunc administra in restauratione eius, et ipsius aequatione illud quod narrauimus in osse Anchae.	And when the Pectinis bone of a man or a woman is fractured, then administer in its restoration, and its equilibrium with this that which we have said concerning the Hip bone
Et non occultatur rectum in his fracturis propinquis, quae parum contingunt, praecipue cui est quiddam studii, uel usus.	And the rectum is not hidden in its near fractures, which are few, especially for one who has some knowledge, or skill.
Et intellige librum meum istum multum, quoniam fractura ipsa significat tibi in pluribus dispositionibus uiam rectam in restauratione sui, et strictura sui: intellige ergo.	And understand my book well, for indeed the fracture itself signifies to you in many positions the correct way to restore and strengthen itself: understand therefore
In Virga autem uiri quando frangitur, accipe guttur anseris: et intromitte uirgam in ipso.	When the vein is fractured, grasp the gut of the antrum of the lung: and introduce the vein into itself.
Deinde pone super ipsum inuolutionem ex panno, et inuoluatur, et dimittatur tribus diebus, aut circiter eos, et sanabitur, si Deus uoluerit.	Then place above it an omentum of cloth, and it shall be bound, and it shall be let go of on the third day, or thereabouts, and it shall heal, if God wills it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae ossium, quando est cum uulnere.	As for the restoration of a fractured bone, when there is associated with a wound.
Caput XX.	Chapter 20.
Conuenit ei cui accidit fractura cum uulnere, praecipue si est magnum, sicut os coxae, aut adiutorii, aut simile illi, ut properes, et phlebotomes ipsum statim: si attestantur tibi conditiones phlebotomiae, sicut praemisimus.	It agrees with him on whom a fracture has happened with a wound, especially if it is great, such as the hip bone, or the ribs, or the like of them, that he should be immediately bled: if these conditions of bleeding are attested to by you.
Quod si uulnus effluit sanguinem, tunc oportet, ut properes ad abscisionem eius, ita ut puluerizes super ipsum zegi tritum: si non est tibi praesens aliud.	If the wound flows with blood, then it is necessary, that you prepare for the excision of its vessel, so that it is powdered over the wound: if there is nothing else present with it
Deinde incipe restaurare fracturam in illo eodem die: et non postponas illud, si non accidit apostema.	Then begin to restore the fracture on the same day: and do not postpone it, if it does not happen after the afterpulse
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte restaurationem eius usque ad diem nonum, donec sedetur apostema.	If indeed afterpulse has happened cold, then withdraw the restoration from it until the ninth day, until the afterpulse has settled.
Et non appropinques ei in die tertio, et quarto omnino, nam tu faceres ei accidere accidentia mala.	And do not approach it on the third day, and the fourth day altogether, for you will make him suffer evil things.
Si autem os fractum est eminens super cutem detectum: tunc oportet, ut coneris reducere ipsum, et aequare ipsum manibus tuis cum facilitate et extensione parua.	If however the fractured bone is prominent above the skin detected: then it is necessary, that you prepare to reduce it, and to make it even with your hands with ease and slight extension
Si autem non praeparatur extensio eius, et ipsius aequatio manibus tuis: tunc reduc ipsum cum isto instrumento.	If indeed it is not prepared with its extension, and its evenness with your hands: then reduce it with this instrument
Et est instrumentum quod fit ex ferro, cuius longitudo est quantitas septem digitorum, aut octo: et eius latitudo est secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And the instrument is made of iron, whose length is the quantity of seven fingers, or eight: and its breadth is according to the quantity of the wound
Et propter illud necesse est medico, ut accipiat ex eis tria, aut quatuor secundum quantitatem qua indiget ad illud ex curatione in omni specie fracturae.	And therefore it is necessary for the physician to take from the patient three or four according to the quantity which is necessary for the care of every kind of fracture.
Et sit rotundum: et sit in eo grossitudo parua, ut non duplicetur apud compressionem super ipsum in hora operationis: et sit acutae extremitatis, cui sit margo in extremitatibus suis.	And let the wound be rounded: neither too great nor too small, so that it does not double over under compression at the time of operation: and let the edges be acute, which have a margin at their edges
Et sit superius eius ad grossitudinem ex medietate eius usque ad inferiora.	And let the above be to the great extent from the middle to the lower parts
Et haec est forma eius.	This is its shape.
Oportet in Hac Operatione, ut ponatur extremitas eius acuta curuata super extremitatem ossis eminentis: et impelle ipsum cum eo uice una, donec quando redit os et aequatur quadam aequatione.	It is necessary in the operation to place the acute edge of the instrument curved over the prominence of the bone: and push it in with the same until the bone returns and is equal to the surrounding parts
Conare ergo aequare extremitates fracturae adinuicem.	To strive therefore to make the edges of the fracture parallel.
Quod si extremitates eius fracta est subtilis, et non accipit eam instrumentum accaeptione bona, tunc opotet, ut incidas extremitatem illius ossis, donec instrumentum potestatem habeat eius.	If the edges of the fracture are slight and do not grasp the instrument well, then it is possible to cut the edge of the bone until the instrument has the power to grasp it
Si uero non potes reducere eos cum eo quod narrauimus omnino, tunc incide ipsum cum eo quod conuenit ei ex Incisoriis quae diximus: aut serra ipsum cum una serrarum quocunque modo possibile est tibi.	If indeed it is not possible to reduce them as we have mentioned before, then cut it with the instrument which we mentioned before: or grasp it with a clamp of any kind which is possible to you
Deinde rade illud quod remanet in osse ex asperitate et corticibus minutis.	Then remove what remains of the bone from the asperities and small pieces.
Cum ergo reducitur os, et inuenit infirmus post reductionem eius dolorem uehementem laedentem, tunc scias, quod os non rediit ad locum suum naturalem.	When therefore the bone is reduced, and if after reduction it finds pain and swelling, then you know that the bone has not returned to its natural position.
Fac ergo illud.	Do this thing.
Nam tu confers infirmo iuuamentum magnum, cum completur restauratio tua quam facis ossi.	For you confer great comfort to the patient when you complete the restoration of the bone
Tunc submerge pannum in uino stiptico, nigro.	Then soak the bandage in wine, black.
Et proprie si est in aestate.	If it is summer.
Et non ponas super uulnus caerotum, neque aliquid in quo sit oleum: ut non faciat accidere in ipso putredinem et corruptionem.	If it is summer, do not apply an ointment upon a wound, nor anything containing oil: lest it cause the wound to become infected and corrupted.
Deinde administra astellas in hora complementi tui a restauratione ossis.	Then give sponges in the hour of completion of your meal to restore the bones.
Et dimitte uulnus detectum: ita, ut incidas cum forficibus foramen in inuolutionibus secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And discharge the wound: thus, you will cut through with scissors the opening in the swelling according to the quantity of the wound
Et caue omni cautela, ne stringas uulnus cum fractura.	And be cautious of all care, lest you string up the wound with a fracture
Multotiens enim fecerunt istud stolidi medici: et fecerunt accidere super infirmos suos aut mortem, aut corrosionem, aut zuchem, id est, saniem.	Many doctors have done this carelessly and caused harm to their patients, either death or infection, or corrosion, or decay, that is, damage.
Et sit strictura tua mollis, lenis, diuersa stricturae fracturarum reliquarum.	And let your dressing be soft, lenient, diverse from the strictures of the remaining fractures.
Quod si uulnus est malum, aut est uulnus magnum, et times super ipsum quaedam accidentia mala quae narrauimus, et inuenis dolorem in loco suspensum: tunc non oportet, ut ponas super ipsum astellas.	If the wound is bad, or is large, and you fear some other mishap which we have mentioned, and you perceive pain in the surrounding area: then it is not necessary to apply sponges to it
Et fac eis inuolutiones ex pannis duris in loco astellarum, et stringe ipsum cum eis.	And make incisions from hard papers in the place of the sponges, and string it up with thread.
Cum autem est post diem unum, aut dies duos, et uides uulnus iam incipere, ut in eo generetur pus: tunc aufer desuper ipsum pannum quem posuisti super ipsum cum uino.	When, however, a day or two have passed, and the wound is beginning to discharge pus: then remove the paper which you placed over it with wine
Deinde administra licinia, et unguenta cum quibus de consuetudine nostra est, ut medicemur uulnera: sicut unguentum tetrapharmacon, et similia illi.	Then give liniment, and unguents which are customary with us, to the wound: such as unguentum tetrapharmacon, and the like
Et conuenit tibi, ut soluas ligamentum.	And it is convenient for you to dissolve the ligament.
Et considera uulnus in omni die mane et uespere, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	And consider the wound every day in the morning and evening, until it is consolidated and healed
Et oportet, ut praeparetur membrum taliter, ut currat ex eo pus ad inferiora cum facilitate.	It is necessary that the limb be prepared in such a way that the pus may flow downwards with ease.
Quod si praetereunt uulneri dies multi, et non consolidatur, neque abscinditur pus ab eo: tunc scias, quod illic sunt satagie ossis parua.	If the wound has lingered for many days and is not consolidated, and if the pus is not evacuated from it: then you know that there are small bone fragments there
Quare oportet, ut inquiras uulnus cum tenta.	Therefore you must inquire about the wound when you touch it
Quot uero ex illis alsatagie sunt separata, remoue ea, et extrahe ipsa.	How many of these bone fragments are separated from each other? Remove them and extract them
Et quae ex eis sunt non separata, et pungunt membrum, et faciunt accidere dolorem, conare incidere ea, et auferre ea omni modo quo possibile est tibi illud.	And what is not separated from these, but which pierces the limb and causes pain, must be cut open and removed in every possible way
Quod si accidat uulneri zuchen, aut ekileten, id est, estiomenus, aut species alia corruptionis et putrefactionis: tunc oportet, ut opponas unicuique ex eis cum eo quod conuenit ei ex curatione, cuius praecessit narratio in capitulo suo.	If swelling occurs in the wound, or if there is swelling in any part of the limb, that is, inflammation, or any other corruption and decomposition: then it is necessary that you oppose each part of the limb with that which is suitable for its cure, as is stated in its chapter.
Et ex eo in quo oportet ut stet sermo meus, et cui facias praesentem mentem tuam quando frangitur os, et eminet super membrum, sicut os coxae, et adiutorii, et similia eis ex membris magnis, est, ut non praesumas attractionem eius, multotiens enim accidit ex illo mors, imo dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat.	And concerning that in which it is necessary that you should remain silent according to my saying, and to which you should pay attention when the bone is fractured and projects outwards from the limb, such as the thigh bone, and the kneecap, and similar parts of the large limbs, that you should not presume its attraction, for much harm has been known to result from this, or even to cause its decay.
Fortasse enim cadet per se post uiginti dies, aut triginta.	Perhaps it will break away of itself within ninety days, or within thirty days.
Tunc ergo cura uulnus, si uidetur tibi: et sinon, dimitte ipsum.	Therefore care for the wound if you see it: and otherwise leave it alone
¶ De curatione Nodationis in uestigio fracturae.	Note: The provided text does not contain any further sections or instructions regarding the curation of fractures, so the provided translation ends here.
Caput XXI.	Chapter XXI.
Multoties accidit haec Nodatio in uestigio sanationis fracturae.	Many things happen in this nodulation during the process of healing a fracture
Praecipue, quae est prope iuncturas: et foedatur ex ea figura membri.	Specifically, that which is close to the sutures: it causes damage from that figure of the limb.
Et fortasse prohibet membrum ab operatione sua naturali.	It may also prevent the limb from its natural operation.
Considera ergo tunc, si nodatio est recens: administra in ea medicinas quae stipticitatem habent, sicut aloe, et olibanum, et myrrha, et sarcocolla, et acacia, et similia eis.	Therefore, if the suture is rough: administer in it medicines which have styptic properties, such as aloe, and olibanum, and myrrh, and sarcocolla, and acacia, and the like.
Ita, ut accipias ex istis quasdam, aut omnes eas: et confice eas cum uino stiptico, aut cum albumine oui, aut cum aceto: et pone eas super nodationem in stuppa, et stringe eas super ipsam strictura bona.	Thus, take some of these, or all of them: mix them with wine that has styptic properties, or with albumin or vinegar: and place them over the suture on a cushion, and bind them over the same good stitching.
Et dimitte stricturam, nec soluas eam diebus multis.	And remove the suture, neither leave it in for many days.
Deinde solue eam, et itera aliam, donec remoueatur nodatio.	Then dissolve the suture, and do it again until the suture is healed
Aut stringe super ipsam laminam plumbi decenter.	Or bind over it a layer of lead foil in the middle.
Plumbo enim est proprietas remouendi omne quod timetur ex membris.	Lead has the property of dissolving everything that is harmful to the limbs
Si autem nodatio iam in lapidem conuersa est, et stricta est, et festine prouocat necessitas ad auferendum eam: tunc finde super eam ex superiori parte eius, et incide superfluitatem eminentem: aut rade eam cum quibusdam rasoriis, donec remoueatur: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	If, however, the suture has already penetrated the stone, and is firmly stuck, and there is a need to remove it: then find above the said part of it, and break off the surplus: or cut through it with some instruments, until it is removed: and take care of the wound until it has healed
¶ De curatione quando restauratur, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, non secundum naturam suam.	As for the care when the limb has been restored, and remains under the skin afterwards, not according to its natural habit.
Caput XXII.	Chapter XXII.
Quando restauratur fractura ossis, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, debile: tunc non fit illud nisi propter caussas multas.	When a fracture of a bone has been restored, and the limb remains under the skin afterwards, it is weak: then it does not suffice except for many causes.
Quarum una est, multitudo solutionis ligamenti et ligationis eius non secundum quod oportet: aut propter superfluitatem stricturae ligamentorum, donec prohibeatur nutrimentum currere ad membrum: aut propter multitudinem embrocationis superfluae in non sua hora: aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore infirmi, et debilitatem eius.	For one, many things impede the solution of the ligament and its ligation that do not conform to what is appropriate: either because of the excess of tension of the ligaments, until it hinders the nourishment of the limb: or because of the excess of external dressing at an inappropriate time: or because of the scarcity of blood in the body, and the weakening of the limb itself
Et curatio illius est, cibare infirmum, et tenerum facere corpus eius, donec multiplicetur sanguis in eo.	The treatment for that is to feed the patient and keep his body warm until the blood multiplies in it.
Et administra balneum.	And give him a warm bath.
Et intromitte gaudium et laeticiam super eum.	And give him joy and gladness over him.
Deinde pone picem super membrum: ut attrahat pix ad ipsum nutrimentum multum.	Then put oil on the limb: so it will draw the blood to itself for much nourishment
Et assiduet embrocationem eius cum aqua tepida, donec currat nutrimentum, et redeat ad figuram suam naturalem.	And diligently anoint it with lukewarm water, until the nourishment has recovered and returned to its natural shape
¶ De curatione ossium fractorum quando restaurantur tortuose.	When the bones are fractured and restored to their tortuous state, the treatment is as follows:
Caput XXIII.	Chapter XXIII.
Quando accidit membro iam restaurato post sanationem eius tortuositas, et eminentia ossi fracto, aut nodatio: et foedatur per illud forma membri, uerumtamen membrum non prohibetur ab operatione sua naturali: tunc non oportet ut recipias sermonem eius, qui existimat, ut frangatur membrum denuo.	When the limb has been restored after healing following a fracture, and its tortuousity and prominence of the fractured bone remain: and it is swollen in that form, but the limb is not prohibited from its natural action: then it is not necessary to repeat the fracture of the limb
Et iam fuerunt multi stolidorum medicorum et restauratorum, qui fecerunt illud in terra nostra.	And there are many proud doctors and restorers in our land who have done this.
Et haec quidem operatio est uituperabilis ualde, perducens ad mortem, uel timorem magnum, ut scilicet sit mortalis.	And this treatment is very dangerous and harmful, leading to death, or great fear, as it is mortal
Verum si claudicatio et nodatio sunt recentes: tunc oportet, ut embrocetur cum aqua tepida, in qua decoctae sint herbae mollificantes, sicut folia alteae, et radix eius, et mellilotum, et illis similia.	But if the swelling and nodulation are recent: then it is necessary to anoint it with lukewarm water in which decoctions of emollient herbs are boiled, such as elder leaves, and the root of it, and mellilotum, and those of a similar kind.
Et fiat ei emplastrum cum emplastro mollificatiuo, sicut dyachilon decenter factum.	And make him a plaster with an emollient plaster, such as gypsum made from the centre of a date
Aut sumatur mucilago radicis alteae, et concutiatur cum adipe gallinae, aut oleo sisamino: et emplastretur cum eo.	Or take the mucus of elder root, and grind it with fat of hen, or with beeswax: and plaster it on it with this.
Aut sumantur ficus pingues, et terantur cum fimo columbino, et similibus eis quae nominantur ex medicinis diminuentes consolidationem.	If the swelling is great, it is to be squeezed out with the thumb and index finger, and with similar instruments which the physicians call reducing consolidations.
Et quandoque soluitur nodatio cum fricatione assidua, antiqua, et leni, quae fit cum manibus humidis.	When the swelling has been dissolved by persistent friction, old and gentle, which is done with moist hands.
Et administretur motus membri ad omnem partem in horis omnibus.	And movement of the limb is administered to every part at all hours.
Si autem tortuositas iam antecessit, et fortis facta est, et conuersa est in lapidem, et prouocata est necessitas ad curatonem eius cum ferro: tunc oportet, ut secetur superius eius, et soluatur continuatio ossis, et incidatur quod superfluit ex nodatione aut osse cum Incisoriis subtilibus: et administretur facilitas in illo cum sollicitudine et studio.	But if the swelling has already preceded it, and has become strong, and has been reduced to a stone, and has required a cutting: then it is necessary to cut above it, to dissolve the continuation of the bone, and to drain what is superfluous from the swelling or from the bone with fine cutters: and this should be administered with solicitude and care
¶ De sermone in Dislocatione.	Regarding the matter of dislocation.
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter 24
Dislocatio est exitus alicuius iuncturarum a loco suo.	Dislocation is the exit of any articulation from its place
Quare prohibetur a motu suo, et foedatur figura membri.	Because it hinders its movement and deforms the limb
Et facit accidere super infirmum dolores, et laesiones uehementes.	And causes the production of great pain and serious injuries
Quando ergo accidit alicui dislocatio, tunc oportet festinare ad restaurationem eius: neque tardet eam omnino.	When this has happened, then it is necessary to hasten to restore it: neither should it be delayed at all
Nam si tardatur, apostematur locus, et fortasse cum eo reductio dislocationis.	For if it is delayed, the place is left behind, and perhaps with it the reduction of the dislocation
Propter illud ergo non oportet, ut moueatur, neque extendatur in hora apostemationis eius.	Therefore it is not necessary to move or extend it in the hour of its displacement
Quoniam multotiens facit accidere spasmum, et dolores laedentes.	For it makes many spasms and painful pangs appear.
Verum quando accidit illud, tunc oportet, ut properes ad phlebotomiam infirmi.	But when this has happened, then it is necessary to proceed to phlebotomy of the patient
Deinde dimittatur, donec quiescat apostema.	Then let it be withdrawn until the swelling subsides.
Deinde embrocetur membrum cum aqua calida et oleo.	Then let the limb be bound with warm water and oil
Deinde reducatur cum facilitate.	Then let it be reduced with ease
Et curetur omne membrum cum eo cuius rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And let every limb be cared for as its memory returns to its place
Ego quidem iam ordinaui capitula dislocationis, etiam secundum quod praecessit in fractura, a superiori parte corporis usque ad inferiorem eius.	I have indeed ordained that the heads of dislocations be treated, even according to what has preceded in fracture, from the upper part of the body down to the lower part of it.
¶ De cura dislocationis Mandibulae inferioris.	Concerning the care of the lower jaw dislocation
Caput XXV.	Head 25
Parum dislocantur duae Mandibulae nisi raro.	Little is dislocated of the two mandibles except rarely
Et dislocatio ambarum fit secundum unum duoru modorum.	And the dislocation of both is done according to one of two methods.
Aut enim remouentur a locis suis remotione parua, et mollificantur parumper.	Or else they are moved from their places with a small removal, and they are softened gently
Aut dislocantur dislocatione integra, completa, donec mollificentur ad partem pectoris, donec currat saliua infirmi, et non possit tenere eam, neque possit claudere os suum, et inuoluatur lingua eius cum sermone.	Or they are dislocated completely, without removing the fracture, until they are softened to the part of the chest, until the wound has healed, and it cannot hold itself, neither can it close its own bone, and the tongue is involved with the saliva
Quando autem dislocatio eius est parua, tunc redit in pluribus dispositionibus per se cum paucitate.	When the dislocation is small, then it returns by itself in several postures with little effort
Si uero est dislocatio completa, integra: tunc oportet, ut administretur reductio eius uelociter, et non tardetur penitus: et est, ut teneat minister caput infirmi: et intromittat medicus pollicem manus suae unius in radicem Mandibulae dislocationis inter os eius, si dislocatio est a parte una.	If, however, the dislocation is complete, entire: then it must be managed immediately, and not delayed: and it is necessary that the minister of the patient should hold the hand of the patient with one hand on the root of the dislocation of the mandible between the bones of the dislocation, if the dislocation is on one side
Aut intromittat duos pollices suos simul, si dislocatio est a duabus partibus.	Or he may insert two fingers of his hand together if the dislocation is on both sides
Et reliqui digiti manuum eius sint extra, quibus aequet.	And the rest of the fingers of his hand remain outside, which is equal
Et praecipe infirmo, ut mundificet Mandibulas suas, et absoluat eas ad manducandum ad omnem partem.	And command the sick person to loosen his jaws and consume food for every part.
Et medicus aequet Mandibulam, et impellat Mandibulam, donec redeat ad locum suum.	The doctor should loosen the jaw and urge the patient to eat until the jaw returns to its normal position.
Quod si difficilis sit reductio eius, praecipue si sunt ambae Mandibulae simul: tunc administra uaporationem cum aqua calida, et oleo, donec fiat facilis reductio ambarum: neque tardes reductionem ambarum omnino, sicut diximus.	If the reduction is difficult, especially if both jaws are simultaneously displaced: then apply poultice with warm water and oil, until the reduction of both is easy: do not attempt to reduce them both entirely as we have said
Cum ergo redeunt et aequantur, et clauditur os infirmi, et non mollificantur: tunc pone super eas puluillos pannorum, cum ceroto quod sit factum ex cera: et oleo rosato.	When they have returned and are aligned, and the patient's jaw is closed and not softened: then place over the teeth cotton wool soaked in rosewater.
Deinde ligetur cum facilitate cum ligamentis mollibus.	Then bind them firmly with soft bands.
Et sit somnus infirmi super dorsum suum: et caput eius sit stans inter duo puluinaria, ut non moueat ipsum ad dextram et sinistram: neque conetur, uel cogatur masticare aliquid: imo ponatur cibus eius sorbitio lenis, donec quando remouentur dolores, et nodatur Mandibula: tunc comedat quod uult, et administretur illud cum facilitate.	The patient should sleep on his back: and his head should rest between two cushions, so that he does not move it to the right or left: neither should he be forced to bite or chew anything: rather let him take food slowly, until when he feels comfortable, he nods his jaw: then he may eat what he wants, and this should be done with ease
Non laboret super operationem oris sui apud comestionem et potum, et oscitationem, donec nodetur Mandibula, et sanetur.	Let him not worry about the operation of his mouth during eating and drinking, and biting, until his jaw is numb and healed.
Quod si difficilis fiat reductio duarum Mandibuiarum, quando dislocantur in hora aliqua, et non conuertuntur ad loca sua: tunc multotiens accidunt inde febres, et soda assidua: et fortasse soluitur uenter infirmi, et fortasse uomit choleram puram.	If the reduction of both jaws is difficult when they are displaced at some moment, and they do not return to their place: then many times arise from this fever and strong soda: and perhaps the patient's bowels will be relieved, and perhaps the pure bile will be omitted
Cum ergo uides illud: tunc scias, quia est perditio, et multotiens moritur ille cui accidit illud in decem diebus.	When you have done this: then you know that it is loss, and many people die from this within a month
¶ De reducione dislocationis Furculae, et extremitatis humeri.	Of the reduction of dislocation of the jaw and the extremity of the humerus.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter XXVI.
Furcula quidem non dislocatur ex latere intrinseco, propter continuationem suam cum pectore.	The furcula [a bone in the chest] is not displaced from the inside outwards, because it continues with the breastbone.
Et dislocatur quandoque ad exteriora: et declaratur illud sensui.	It is displaced sometimes outwards: and it is declared by sense.
Et restauratio eius est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat brachia sua.	Its restoration is that the patient should lie upon his back, and extend his arms
Deinde coarta locum cum palma tua coartatione forti, nam ipsa redibit.	Then cover the place with your hand, with a strong bandage, for it will return by itself
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stringe eam.	Then place upon it a dressing, and sponges, and bind it firmly.
Extremitates uero eius quae sequuntur cubitum, et continuantur cum eo, non dislocantur, nisi raro.	The limbs following the elbow do not normally displace, except rarely
Quod si dislocatur die aliquo: tunc oportet, ut reducatur et aequetur secundum quod diximus, et quod praeparatur tibi.	If it is displaced on some day: then it is necessary to reduce it and restore it according to what has been said, and to prepare it well
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam.	Then place upon it a dressing, and sponges, and bind it firmly
Et praecipe infirmo, adhaerere tranquillitati et quieti, donec sanetur.	And command the patient to adhere to quiet and tranquility, until he is healed.
Et cum hac eadem curatione reducitur extremitas Humeri, quando separatur etiam a loco suo.	And when the same cure has reduced the limb of the humerus, when it is separated from its place also
¶ De reductione dislocationis Humeri.	¶ On the reduction of the dislocation of the humerus
Caput XXVII.	Chapter XXVII.
Scias, quod Humerus non dislocatur, nisi secundum tres modos.	Know that the humerus is not displaced except in three ways.
Quorum unus est, ut dislocetur ad partem titillici ad inferiora.	One of them is that it is displaced downwards to the level of the elbow
Secundus est, ut dislocetur ad partem pectoris.	The second is that it is displaced upwards to the level of the chest
Et fortasse dislocatur ad superiorem partem Humeri: et illud fit raro.	The third is that it is displaced towards the upper part of the humerus: and this is rare
Et non dislocatur ad posteriora, propter spatulam.	And it does not slip backward on account of the splatter.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora, propter neruos.	And it does not slip backward on account of the splatter.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur et egreditur ad inferiora uersus titillicum: praecipue in illis, quorum carnes sunt paucae.	And it frequently slips and descends to the lower parts toward the heel: especially in those where the flesh is sparse.
Quoniam egrediur in eis uelociter, et ingreditur uelociter.	For it both goes out quickly and comes in quickly
In illis autem quorum carnes sunt multae, est econtrario illius, scilicet quia egreditur cum difficultate, et ingreditur cum difficultate.	However, in those where the flesh is abundant, it goes out with difficulty and comes in with difficulty
Et fortasse accidit quibusdam hominibus percussio, aut casus, et apostematur Humerus apostemate calido, et putatur propter illud, quia iam dislocatus est.	Perhaps it happens to some people by blow or fall, and the humerus is dislocated by warmth, and it is thought because of this that it is displaced.
Oportet ergo, ut experiaris illud, donec stes super certitudinem eius, et tunc procedas in curatione eius.	It is necessary therefore to try to experience this, until you are certain of its extent, and then you can proceed with its treatment.
Et cognoscitur dislocatio, quando est ad inferiora uersus titillicum: et distinguas inter Humerum dislocatum, et humerum sanum.	It is recognized as displaced when it descends to the heel: and you must distinguish between a displaced humerus and a sound humerus.
Nam tu inuenis inter eos diuersitatem manifestam, et inuenis in capite Humeri concauitatem, et sub titillico apud tactum caput humeri quasi ipsum sit ouum: et non potest infirmus reducere manum ad aurem suam, neque mouere eam omnibus motibus.	For you will find among them a distinct difference, and you will find in the head of the humerus a concavity, and under the heel almost at the touch of the hand as if it were a nail: and you cannot reduce the hand to its proper position, neither can you move it in any way
Et similiter, si dislocatur uersus pectus, aut ad sursum: tunc inuenis manifestum tactum, neque occultatur.	Similarly, if it is displaced towards the breast or upwards: then you will find a distinct sensation, neither is it hidden
Et huius quidem dislocationis fit facilis reductio, quando est recens, aut infirmus est puer.	And in such a displacement, reduction is easily accomplished when it is recent, or if it is slight
Et reductio eius est, ut eleuet minister manum suam ad superiora.	And the reduction of it is to elevate the hand to the higher parts.
Deinde pone tu pollices tuos sub titillico eius, et eleua iuncturam cum fortitudine ad sursum ad locum suum: et minister eleuet manum suam, et extendat eam ad sursum.	Then put your fingers under the heel of it, and elevate the joint with force upwards to its place: and the minister will elevate the hand and extend it upwards
Deinde ponat eam inferius, ipse enim redit uelociter.	Then he places the lower part below, and himself returns quickly.
Si autem non redit per illud quod diximus, et sunt a principio quo accidit dislocatio dies multi: tunc oportet, ut balneetur infirmus in aqua calida, et administretur embrocatio quae mollificat et lenit, sicut si decoquantur radices alteae, et foenugraecum, et mellilotum in aqua, et administretur.	Then he places the lower part below, and himself returns quickly.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et ponatur sub titillico eius sphera et lana, quae sit aequalis inter lenitatem et stricturam.	Then he places the lower part below, and himself returns quickly.
Deinde ponat medicus calcaneum suum super spheram, et eleuet caput humeri cum uirtute, et attrahat manum infirmi ad inferiora.	Then he places the lower part below, and himself returns quickly
Et minister alius teneat caput infirmi, ut non moueatur ad inferiora: ipse namque redit statim.	Then he places the lower part below, and himself returns quickly
Et si uis, reduc eum secundum modum hunc: et est, ut facias esse praesentem uirum qui sit longior infirmo, et stet a parte lateris, et intromittat humerum suum sub titillico infirmi: et eleuet titillicum eius ad superiora, donec sit infirmus suspensus in aere.	Then he places the lower part below, and himself returns quickly
Et minister alius trahat manum infirmi ad inferiora uentris eius.	Then he places the lower part below, and himself returns quickly
Si autem infirmus est leuis: tunc oportet, ut suspendatur cum eo aliquid aliud, ut grauet ipsum: nam redit dislocatio statim.	Then he places the lower part below, and himself returns quickly.
Et reducitur etiam secundum modum alium: et est, ut figatur in terra lignum longum, cuius caput sit rotundum figura: sicut manica mortarii: quod non sit grossum, neque subtile.	Then he places the lower part below, and himself returns quickly
Deinde ponatur sub infirmo postquam ponuntur super caput ligni panni lenes: et infirmus sit stans secundum longitudinem ligni.	Then he places the lower part below, and himself returns quickly
Deinde extendatur manus eius ad inferiora a parte altera, et extendatur corpus eius ab altera parte cum fortitudine: nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then he places the lower part below, and himself returns quickly
Quod si difficilis sit eius reductio per omnia quae diximus, tunc utere hac cura: et est, ut accipias lignum cuius longitudo sit quantitas duorum brachiorum, et eius latitudo quantitas quatuor digitorum, et grossitudo eius quantitas duorum digitorum: cui sit caput rotundum, ut alleuietur introitus eius in profundum titillici, secundum hanc formam.	Then he places the lower part below, and himself returns quickly
Deinde ligentur super caput rotundum panni lenes, ut non laedat lignum infirmum.	Then linen shall be bound over the round head of the sponge, so that it does not harm the fragile bone.
Deinde ponatur sub titillico infirmi, ut extendatur manus, aut brachium super lignum usque ad inferiora: et ligetur lignum super adiutorium et brachium et extremitatem manus.	Then a cushion is placed under the patient’s limb, so that the hand or arm extends over the bone: and the bone is bound over the support and the arm and the hand’s extremity
Deinde ponatur brachium super gradum scalae per latitudinem, et extendatur manus ad inferiora, et dimittatur reliquum corpus suspensum a parte altera.	Then the arm is placed over the step of the ladder across the width, and the hand is extended downwards, and the rest of the suspended body is let go from the other side.
Iunctura enim ingreditur statim.	The ligation immediately enters.
Cum ergo completur introitus eius secundum quemcunque modum possibile est: tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico spheram aequalis quantitatis ex lana.	When it is thus completed the entrance of it is completed according to whatever method is possible: then it is necessary that you place under the cushion a sphere of equal quantity from wool
Deinde pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum olibano, et albumine oui super humerum totum, sicut reuoluitur desuper.	Then place a prepared plaster from ground barley with oil and white of egg over the whole arm, as is customary from above
Deinde stringe sub titillico strictura decenti: et reuoluatur ligamentum super emplastrum desuper: et annectatur manus eius ad collum ipsius, et dimittatur, neque moueatur manus eius septem diebus.	Then bind under the cushion a descending bandage: and twist the ligament over the plaster from above: and connect the hand to the column of its own, and let go, neither move the hand for seven days.
Et oportet, ut ponatur cibus infirmipaucus, donec confortetur membrum: quoniam est uelocius ad sanationem eius.	And it is necessary that you put food for the patient, until the limb is comfortable: because it is quicker for its healing.
Deinde ponatur amplior post septem dies, aut quinque, et ex ercitetur cum motu.	Then put on a larger one after seven days, or five, and take it away when there is movement.
Si ergo firmatur et non mollificatur, tunc iam sanatus est.	If thus it hardens and does not soften, then it is healed.
Si uero iunctura dislocatur multotiens, propter humiditatem quae accidit ei, aut propter caussam aliam: tunc oportet, ut administretur in ea cauterium cum tribus foraminibus, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo de cauterio.	If indeed the ligation is displaced many times, because of the humidity which has happened to it, or because of another cause: then it is necessary that you apply cautery with three holes, according to what is stated in the chapter on cautery
Quod si fiat hoc totum, et soluatur ligamentum post septem dies, et non confirmetur iunctura, et reducatur emplastrum et strictura super ipsum aliquotiens, et non firmetur, et cadat, et non possit eleuare ipsum ad superiora: tunc scias, quod nerui eius qui sunt ad caput humeri, iam incisi sunt, aut extensi, aut mollificati: et scias, quod iunctura nunquam figetur in loco suo.	If you do this, the ligament will be resolved after seven days, and the suture will not hold, and the dressing and tension above the other parts will be reduced, and will not harden, and will fall away, and will not be able to lift itself to the upper parts: then you know that the nerves which are at the head of the humerus have been cut, or stretched, or softened. And you know that the suture has never held in its proper place.
Dislocationis autem quae fit uersus pectus et mammillam, aut ad posteriora reductio, fit cum impulsione et extensione cum manibus: donec redeat, et administretur in ea reliqua strictura et cura, donec sanetur.	If the dislocation which happens near the breast and the armpit, or at the back, is reduced with a push and an extension with the hands: until it returns, and is administered in that way for the rest of the tension and care, until it is healed.
Quod si accidat post sanationem grauitas in membro, et tarditas in motu eius, tunc utatur infirmus balneo multotiens, donec leniatur illa grauitas, et redeat ad naturam eius primam.	If after healing a degree of stiffness remains in the limb, and a delay in its movement: then the patient is bathed with many baths, until the stiffness is softened, and returns to its first nature
¶ De curatione dislocationis Cubiti.	On the treatment of dislocation of the cubit
Caput XXVIII.	(The remaining text is not included in the request.)
Scias, quod iunctura Cubiti dislocatur cum difficultate, et similiter redit cum difficultate etiam: et ipsa quidem dislocatur ad omnes partes, et praecipue ad anteriorem, aut ad posteriorem.	You know that the suture of the cubit is dislocated with difficulty, and returns with difficulty also: and it is dislocated to all parts, and especially to the front, or to the back.
Et eius dislocatio non occultatur tibi: quoniam est cadens sub uisu, et sub tactu, secundum quamcunque figuram dislocetur.	And its dislocation is not hidden: because it is falling under the skin, and under the touch, according to whatever figure it is dislocated
Et quando coniungis cubitum dislocatum cum sano, declaratur tibi illud manifeste.	And when you join the dislocated cubit with the healthy one, you must declare that it is obvious.
Concauatur enim iunctura, et non potest duplicare brachium, neque tangere cum eo humerum suum.	The suture must be firm, and cannot double the arm, nor touch it with the other arm.
Et oportet, ut properes, et reducas dislocationem statim, antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And it is necessary to correct it promptly, and reduce the dislocation before a callous abscess forms.
Nam si accidit ei apostema calidum, difficilis fit eius reductio: et fortasse non sanatur omnino, praecipue quando est ad posteriora.	If, therefore, a callous abscess happens to him, its reduction becomes difficult: and it is possible that it will not be cured at all, especially when it is towards the back.
Est enim deterior omnibus speciebus dislocationis, et uehementioris doloris eis: et multotiens descendit cum ea mors.	It is bad with all kinds of dislocation and of great pain: and it descends much with that blood.
Et restauratio eius quando est ex eis quae possibile est reducere, est, ut extendatur manus eius cum duabus manibus: et brachium eius sit expansum, et manus medici sint supra cubitum et sub eo, et ipse impellat iuncturam cum pollicibus manuum suarum simul, aut cum radice palmae suae, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And its restoration when it is outside what is possible to reduce, is that it be extended with both hands: and the arm be expanded, and the hands of the physician be above the elbow and under it, and he himself presses the join with the thumbs of his hands together, or with the root of his palm, until it returns to its place
Aut uero dislocatio est ad anteriora: tunc redit ita, ut duplicet manum cum manu sua, donec percutiat cum radice palmae suae cubitum qui est dislocatus.	Or else the dislocation is towards the front: then it returns thus, that he doubles his hand with his thumb, until it strikes with the root of his palm the elbow which is dislocated.
Quod si non obedit dislocatio ad reductionem, tunc administra extensionem uehementem, fortem ualde: et est, ut extendant brachium duo ministri: et teneant ipsum duo ministri etiam, ut non remoueatur apud extensionem.	And if the dislocation does not obey reduction, then manage violent extension, strong: and it is that they extend the two arms of the attendants: and they hold it firmly even, so that it does not slip during extension.
Deinde reuoluatur brachium ad omnem partem postquam inuoluitur super manum eius pannus duplicatus longus, aut ligamentum latum.	And then the arm is turned towards all parts after it is hooked over the hand of the patient with the doubled long thumb, or the broad ligament.
Et quando tangit medicus manu sua iuncturam, inungat ipsam cum oleo: ut sit illud ex eis quae adiuuant in lubricitate iuncturae cum facilitate.	And when the physician grasps the hand, let him anoint it with oil: so that it be from the things which aid in the lubrication of the joint with ease.
Deinde impellat iuncturam impulsione uehementi, donec redeat.	And then he presses the joint with force, until it returns.
Et post reductionem eius oportet, ut ponatur super ipsam emplastrum, in quo sit stipticitas, et exiccatio cum albugine oui: et stringatur strictura decenti.	And after its reduction it is necessary to place upon it a dressing which has stypticity, and drying with alum or with eggshell: and to bind the wound securely.
Et suspendatur brachium a collo infirmi: et dimitte diebus aliquot.	And the arm is suspended from the collarbone of the patient: and it is left for a few days.
Deinde soluatur.	Then it is resolved.
Si ergo firmatur iunctura in loco suo, tunc solue ligamentum ab ea, et dimitte ipsam.	If, however, the suture has become firm in its place, then loosen the ligament from that and let it go.</start_of_turn>
Et si uides iuncturam non bene stringi, tunc itera emplastrum, et ligamentum, et dimitte ipsam diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	And if you have not tightly bound the suture, then repeat the packing, the ligament and let it go for a few days, until it is bound.</start_of_turn>
Deinde solue ipsam.	Then it is resolved.</start_of_turn>
Si autem accidit ei grauitas post reductionem iuncturae, et dispositio sit in motu: tunc administra humectationem in balneatione, et fricationem subtilem, et compressionem, donec liniatur, aut pone super iuncturam iliati, id est, natem arietis pinguem.	If, however, some hardness should happen after the reduction of the suture, and the position be unstable: then administer moisture in the bath, and gentle friction, and compression, until it is firm, or place over the suture a cushion of lard, that is, fat of a sheep.</start_of_turn
Deinde ligetur, et dimitte ipsam super eam die et nocte.	Then it is bound, and let it go over the bath day and night.</start_of_turn>
Deinde aufer eam, et intromitte ipsum in balneum.	Then take away the bath, and introduce the limb into the bath.</start_of_turn
Cum ergo sudat, tunc frica iuncturam fricatione temperata.	When it is thus soft, then gently friction the suture.</start_of_turn
Deinde itera super ipsam aleliati uice una, et secunda, et tertia cum introitu balnei, donec leniatur.	Then do this again over the limb with oil once, twice, and three times with the entrance of the bath, until it is softened.</start_of_turn
Et si uis, pone super ipsam stercus uaccinum, humidum, calefactum cum butyro, et stringe super ipsum.	And if you wish, place over the limb a cushion of wool, moistened, warmed with butter, and bind over it.</start_of_turn
Fac illud aliquotiens.	Do this frequently.</start_of_turn
Ipsa namque lenitur, et redit ad dispositionem suam.	The limb itself will become soft and return to its normal position.</start_of_turn
¶ De curatione dislocationis Almahassem.	(End of translation.)</start_of_turn>
Caput XXIX.	(This concludes the translation of Albucasis's text on dislocation.)</start_of_turn>
Mahassem manus multotiens dislocatur, id est, iunctura quae est inter brachium et manum.	The elbow joint is dislocated when the limb is strongly bent, that is, when the suture between the arm and the hand is torn.</start_of_turn
Et reductio dislocationis eius est facilis.	And the reduction of its dislocation is easy.
Econtrario reliquarum iuncturarum.	Contrary to the other sutures.
Verumtamen oportet, ut uelocitas sit in reductione dislocationis eius in hora in qua dislocatur, antequam apostemetur locus: aut accidat in eo apostema calidum.	However, it is necessary to know that speed is of the essence in the reduction of dislocation, before the place is set: or else it will happen that in that setting the place becomes hardened.
Et reductio dislocationis in eo est, ut ponas Mahassem manus infirmae super tabulam, et extendat minister manum eius: et ponat medicus palmam suam super eminentiam iuncturae, et impellat eam, donec redeat.	And the reduction of dislocation in this way is that you place the lower hand of the patient on a board, and extend the hand: and the physician places his palm over the prominence of the suture, and urges it until it returns
Verumtamen oportet, ut consyderetur, si palma iam recessit ad uentrem manus: tunc ponat infirmus dorsum manus suae super tabulam apud extensionem et reductionem: et si dislocatio est procedens ad dorsum manus, tunc sit positio manus eius intrinsece super tabulam, id est, interior pars manus eius super tabulam ponatur, ut cadat manus medici super ipsam eminentiam iuncturae.	It is necessary to note, however, if the palm has receded towards the belly of the hand: then the patient places the back of his hand on the board at the extension and reduction: and if the dislocation is proceeding towards the back of the hand, then the position of the hand should be intrinsic to the board, that is, the inner side of the hand is placed on the board, so that the physician's palm rests upon the prominence of the suture.
Si ergo redit statim, bonum est: et si non, tunc stringe eam cum emplastro sedante apostema: et dimitte ipsum, neque iteres illud.	If, therefore, it returns immediately, that is good: and if not, then tighten the suture with the dressing still in place: and let it go, and do not do it again
Nam si non tolerat, neque potes super reductionem eius, postquam praetereunt ei dies, uerumtamen iunctura remanet secundum tortuositatem suam: et non nocet infirmo aliquid, nisi quod mollificatur manus, et non potest stringere aliquid: tunc scias, quod nerui sunt abscissi, aut attriti.	For if it does not tolerate it, neither can the suture be tightened again after a few days: and it will not be harmful to the patient anything, except that the hand must be softened, and nothing must be tightened: then you know that the fracture has healed, or that the suture has been split
Non est ergo ingenium in ea, nisi ut stringatur cum cauterio prope casum eius.	There is no such thing in this case, except that the suture be tightened with cautery close to the site of the fracture.
Et fortasse non confert illud aliquid.	And perhaps that does not help it at all
Cum ergo non redit Almahassem, tunc pone super ipsum emplastrum, quod narrauimus.	If, therefore, the dislocation does not return, then place upon it the dressing that we have mentioned
Deinde stringatur, et dimittatur quinque diebus: postea soluatur et dimittatur, et exercitetur manus.	Then it is bound up and left for five days: afterwards it is dissolved and discharged, and the hand is exercised.
Si autem priuatur motus eius, et accidat in ea aliquid grauitatis: tunc leni eam cum aqua calefacta, et fricatione aliquotiens, donec leniatur.	If, however, its movement is obstructed and something heavy has occurred in it: then soften it with warm water and gentle friction until it is softened
¶ De curatione dislocationis Digitorum.	On the treatment of dislocations of the fingers
Caput XXX.	Chapter 30.</start_of_turn>
Quando dislocatur ex eis Digitus ad omnem partem, uel ex eis Digitus ad dorsum palmae, aut uentrem eius: tunc extende Digitum, et impelle dislocationem pollicibus tuis, donec redeat.	When the finger is dislocated from the bone to the whole part, or from the bone to the back of the palm, or through its joint: then extend the finger and compel the dislocation with your thumbs until it returns to its place.</start_of_turn>
Deinde sustenta caput Digiti, et suspende ipsum uersus partem ad quam dislocatur, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	Then support the head of the finger and suspend it hanging over the part from which it is dislocated, and discharge it in two days.</start_of_turn>
Deinde suspende eum, et extende ipsum, donec aequetur rectus in illo die suo.	Then suspend it again and extend it, until it is straight on that day.</start_of_turn
Cum ergo fuerit nox, liga ipsum secundum narrationem ipsam: et non cesses soluere ipsum in die: et exerce eum cum motu: et liga ipsum in nocte.	When night comes, bind it according to the above-mentioned instructions: and do not cease to dissolve it every day: and exercise it with movement: and bind it at night.</start_of_turn
Fac illud diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	Do this for a few days until it is bound up.</start_of_turn
Et similiter fac cum eo, si dislocatur ad uentrem manus: et liga eum ad partem ipsam, et fac cum eo operationem tuam primam, donec sanetur.	And do the same with the other hand if the dislocation is at the wrist: and bind it to the part itself, and do the operation as mentioned above until it heals.</start_of_turn
Et similiter fac cum eo quando dislocatur ad reliquas partes.	And do the same in the same way when it is dislocated in other parts.</start_of_turn
¶ De curatione dislocationis Spondilium dorsi.	On the treatment of dislocations of the thumb joint.</start_of_turn
Caput XXXI.	Chapter 1.</start_of_turn
Quando accidit alicui Spondilium dorsi, aut colli dislocatio completa, aut remouentur Spondiles multae a locis suis: tunc non est in ea curatio, quoniam mors properat infirmo.	When it happens to any thumb, or complete dislocation of the collar, or displacement of many bones from their places: then there is no cure for it, for the marrow is sufficient for the sick.</start_of_turn
Et signum illius est, quod egestio infirmi egreditur absque uoluntate, neque potest tenere eam: et multotiens mollificantur ex eo quaedam membra eius, aut duo crura eius, aut duo brachia ipsius, aut unum eorum: aut remouetur Spondilis una de loco suo.	And its sign is that the patient's bodily discharge proceeds without his will, neither can he hold it back: and it frequently softens some part of his body, or two limbs, or two arms, or one eye, or moves Spondilis from its place.
Multotiens enim remouetur, quod multotiens fit remotio earum ad quatuor partes.	It frequently moves, because it frequently causes their evacuation to four parts.
Illa ergo quae remouetur ad posteriora, nominatur Gibbositas.	These are the things which move to the back, and are called Gibbositas.
Curatio uero eius est, ut consyderes tunc, si Gibbositas accidit a puericia: tunc non est in ea curatio, neque ex ea est sanatio omnino.	The treatment of it is that they should be consolidated immediately, if Gibbositas arise from puerility: then there is no treatment for it, neither from it is there any recovery of health at all.
In illa autem quae accidit a casu, aut percussione, aut similibus illis, iam dixerunt antiqui modos curationis sermone prolixo.	But in those which arise from a blow, or from an injury, or like these, as the ancients said in a long discourse about methods of treatment.</start_of_turn>
Cuius plurimum non redit cum proficuo.	Most of them do not return when their condition improves.</start_of_turn>
Ego uero iam abbreuiaui ex illo, cuius parum excusat a multo eius ex propinquitate mea ad intentionem: et expositione mea qua exposui illud, et formaui instrumentum eius diuerso modo ab eo quo ostenderunt illud, et exposuerunt ipsum.	I myself have abbreviated from that which has been omitted from many of them because of my closeness to the matter: and the way in which I have exposed it, and the form which I have given to the instrument which they have described, differs from that which they have shown.
Dico ergo, quod in gibbositate quae accidit ab anteriori parte, non est ingenium, neque sanatio ex ea.	I say therefore, that in the Gibbositas which arise from the front part, there is neither ingenuity nor recovery from it.</start_of_turn>
Et similiter in illa quae fit ad duo latera etiam.	And in those which arise at the two sides also.</start_of_turn
Et non curatur ex eis, nisi illa quae accidit in dorso proprie, cum eo quod ego narro: et est, ut extendatur infirmus super faciem suam super podium aequale prope parietem: et expandatur sub eo stramentum humidum, ut non laedatur pectus eius.	And it is not cured except when it arises in the back itself, as I have mentioned: and that is, when the patient is extended over his face over a level platform near the wall: and the instrument is spread under him, so that his chest is not injured.</start_of_turn
Deinde ponatur lignum rectum fixum in fouea in terra, in extremitate podii, circiter caput eius: et lignum aliud circiter pedes eius in extremitate altera podii: et minister teneat lignum, et sit non firmatum in fouea.	Then one places a fixed beam in the fire in the ground, at the foot of the bed, around the head of the patient: and another beam around the feet at the other foot of the bed: and the minister holds the beam, and let it not be fixed in the fire.</start_of_turn
Et minister alter teneat alterum.	And the other attendant shall hold the other.
Deinde inuolue super caput infirmi, et sub titillicis eius ligamentum lene, firmum: et extende extremitatem ligamenti ad lignum quod est apud caput eius: et liga ipsum in eo.	Then place your thumb over the head of the patient, and under the nails of his thumb ligament loosen, firm: and extend the end of the ligament to the bone which is at the head of his thumb: and bind it there.
Deinde stringe ligamentum aliud supra anchas eius, et supra genua ipsius, et apud cauillas eius.	Then string another ligament above the wrist of his hand, and above his knee, and at his heel.
Deinde aggrega ligamenta omnia, et liga ea in ligno altero quod est apud pedes eius.	Then gather up all the ligaments and bind them on the other bone which is at his feet.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem ligni ligamentum, et non remoueantur duo ligna ex locis suis in quibus sunt fixa: uerumtamen non sint firmata, sicut diximus.	Then extend all the attendants to the part of the limb of the ligaments, and do not move two bones from their places where they are fixed: indeed they are not fixed, as we have said.
Et medicus ponat palmas suas super Spondilem cum fortitudine, donec redeat: aut ponat super eam tabulam.	And the physician lays his palms on the spine with force, until it returns: or lays on the thumb tab.
Deinde annectat super tabulam pedes suos, donec redeat.	Then bind over the thumb his feet, until it returns.
Si autem non redit per hanc curationem, tunc accipe tabulam cuius longitudo sit circiter tria brachia.	If, however, it does not return by this treatment, then take a board whose length is somewhat three arms.
Et caua in pariete de quo diximus quod est prope infirmum, locum in quem ingrediatur extremitas tabulae.	And put a hole in the wall from which we said that it is near the patient, the place where the extremity of the board will enter
Deinde pone medium tabulae super Spondilem.	And put the middle of the board on the spine
Et ponat pedes suos medicus super extremitatem alteram.	And the physician lays his feet on the other extremity
Et stringat bene, donec coartetur Spondilis, et redeat ad locum suum.	And bind well, until the vertebra is straightened, and returns to its place.
Deinde si uis, operare cum torno quod inuoluitur cum manu tua: et est, ut figas in terram apud caput infirmi in postremo podii duo ligna, quorum longitudo sit brachii unius: et apud caput eius in postremo podii duo ligna.	And if you wish, work with the ankle which is involved with your hand: and it is that two bones are like fists at the head of the patient at the end of the foot: and two bones at the head of his foot at the end of the foot.
Et sit longitudo quae est inter omne lignum palmus unus: et iam factum est in omni loco foramen, in quo currit tornum: et firmetur lignum omne in terra multum, ne moueatur omnino.	And let the length be such that it may encompass the whole palm-tree: and it is made in every place where the ring turns: and the whole tree is firmly fixed to the earth, so that it does not move at all.
Et intromittatur lignum rotundum: et est tornum in quo reuoluitur ligamentum in duobus foraminibus duorum lignorum.	And the round timber is introduced: and the ring is in the place where the ligament revolves around the two holes of the two timbers.
Et in extremitate eius est foramen, in quo firmatur lignum, cuius longitudo est palmus cum eo quod reuoluitur: et in duobus lignis aliis est similiter illius.	And at its extremity is a hole through which the timber is fixed, whose length is the palm-tree itself as it revolves: and in two other timbers it is like this also
Deinde stringe ligamenta quae strinxisti in pectore infirmi torno quod est apud caput eius: et ligamenta quae strinxisti in cruribus eius in torno quod est apud pedes eius.	And then bind the ligaments which you have bound about the chest of the patient around the ring which is at his head: and the ligaments which you have bound about his thighs around the ring which is at his feet.
Deinde stet apud omne tornum minister, qui torqueat manum suam cum licinio, cum quo reuoluitur tornum: et medicus aequet Spondilem, secundum quod diximus.	And then stand at every ring-bearer who is to twist his hand with a rule, with which the ring revolves: and the physician shall equal the Spondile, as we have said before
Haec est forma torni, quae sequitur.	This is the form of the ring which follows.
Deinde postquam redit Spondilis, et aequatur locus, tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum exiccatiuum cum albumine oui.	And then when the Spondile returns, and the place is equal, then it is necessary to place an absorbent dressing with albumin or white of egg on the wound
Deinde stuppam.	Then suture.
Postea pone supra emplastrum astellam ex tabula, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, aut circiter eos.	And then place above the dressing a star of tabula, whose width is three fingers, or thereabouts.
Et longitudo eius quantitas quae capiat locum Gibbositatis, et super partem Spondilis sanae.	And its length is as much as will cover the area of the Gibbus, and over the sound part of the Spondile
Deinde ligetur cum ligamento quod diximus.	And it is bound with the ligament which we mentioned before
Et utatur infirmus nutrimento subtili, donec sanetur.	And the patient shall be nourished with a fine diet until he is healed
Quod si remaneat quiddam eminentiae in loco in fine sanationis: tunc oportet, ut administrentur medicinae quae mollificant, et leniunt, cum administratione tabulae quam narrauimus tempore longo.	If anything remains prominent in the place at the end of the healing process: then it is necessary to administer medicines which soften and soothe, with the administration of the plaster as we have said for a long time
Et iam administratur in illo lamina plumbi.	And it is administered in that lamina of lead.
Et quandoque accidit eminentia in postremo Spondilium dorsi: et putatur per eam dislocatio, et est illud os quod iam eminet.	And when it happens that an eminence appears in the lower Spondilium of the back: and it is supposed to be by displacement, and that is the bone which is now emining.
Quare non oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei cum hac medicina: fortasse enim accidere faciet mortem.	Therefore it is not right that a supposition should be made for it with regard to this medicine: perhaps because of that the patient will die.
¶ De curatione Anchae dislocatae.	Of the treatment of a dislocated shoulder
Caput XXXII.	Chapter 2
Scias, quod iuncturae Anchae, et iuncturae humeri, non accidit, nisi dislocatio tantum: neque accidit eis quod accidit reliquis iuncturis ex remotione parua, et concauitate.	You know that dislocations of the shoulder and of the humerus do not happen except for a complete dislocation: neither do they happen except for a small displacement and a concavity.
Et iunctura quidem Anchae dislocatur secundum quatuor partes.	And the dislocation of the shoulder is reckoned to be according to four parts
Quod est, quia dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	That is, because it is displaced forward and backward
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur ad interiora: et parum dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	And most of them are displaced inwards: and little of them is displaced forward or backward
Et curatio dislocationis eius ad interiora, est: quia quando tu coniungis crus infirmi sanum cum infirmo, est longius: et est genu eius eminens plus quam sani, et non potest infirmus duplicare pedem suum apud inguen: et est locus qui sequitur inguen apostematus apostemate calido, propterea, quod caput coxae iam peruenit illic.	And the treatment of its dislocation inwards is: because when you join the limb of the healthy side with that of the sick one, the latter is longer: and the knee of the sick one is more prominent than that of the healthy one, and the sick one cannot double up his foot at the knee: and the place which follows the knee of the thigh is hot, because the head of the femur is now passing over there
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad exteriora est, quod sunt accidentia eius contraria istis accidentibus.	And the sign of that to which the dislocation is outward is that there are opposite signs of these to the dislocation.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad anteriora, est, quia expandit crus sanum secundum complementum: uerumtamen non duplicat ipsum absque dolore qui est in genu: et si conatur ad ambulandum, non potest super illud ad anteriora: et retinetur urina eius, et apostematur inguen eius, et apud ambulationem est calcatio eius super calcaneum.	And the sign of that to which the dislocation is forward is that the limb of the healthy side is expanded according to the complement: but truly it does not double itself without pain at the knee: and if he tries to walk, he cannot go beyond that forward: and he retains his urine, and his knee is bent, and there is swelling at his walking.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad posteriora est, ut non expandat genu, neque possit duplicare ipsum antequam duplicet inguen: et est crus eius etiam breuius altero: et inguen est mollificatum, et est caput coxae apud locum ilii.	And the sign of it is that when dislocation has occurred towards the back, the knee does not expand, neither can it double itself before it has doubled the knee: and the thigh is also shorter on one side: and the knee is softened, and the head of the coxae is at the level of the iliac bone.
Reductio uero huius dislocationis specierum est, ut consyderes tunc, si dislocatio est uetusta, quae iam antiquatur cum habente ipsam.	Reduction of this dislocation is difficult; for if the dislocation is old, which has existed since its beginning, it is difficult to reunite it with the limb
Deinde si tu administres reductionem eius, et remanet secundum dispositionem suam: tunc non est in ea curatio omnino.	Then if you attempt to reduce it, and it remains as before: in such a case there is no healing at all in it.
Non ergo oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei penitus.	It is not right therefore that we should suppose that it will recover by itself.
In illo autem cuius dislocatio est recens, et est ex una specierum quatuor dislocationis: tunc propera ad hoc, ut uoluas iuncturam, et extendas ipsam ad interiora et ad exteriora, et moueas eam dextra et sinistra: fortasse enim redit, et non indiget alia cura.	In that case in which the dislocation is fixed, and is one of the four kinds of dislocation: then do this immediately, so that you wish to join the bones together, and extend them inwards and outwards, and move them to the right and left: for perhaps it will return by itself and no other treatment will be needed.
Si autem non redit hoc modo, tunc oportet, ut praepares ministrum fortem, et extendat crus eius ab inferiori parte: aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento, quod ligetur super crus eius supra genu: et minister alius extendat manum eius desuper, ita ut intromittat manus suas sub titillicis eius.	If it does not return in this way, then it is necessary to prepare a strong minister, and to extend the thigh from the lower part: either with the hands or with a ligature which is tied above the knee: and another minister extends his hand above, so that he inserts his hand under the thigh bones.
Deinde stringat cum ligamento leni super radicem coxae, et teneat extremitatem ligamenti alterius.	Then tighten with a soft ligature over the root of the coxae, and grasp the extremity of the other ligature.
Et sit extensio eius aut ab anteriori parte inguinis ad partem furculae, aut a posteriori ad partem dorsi.	And keep the extension from the anterior part of the knee to the part of the heel, or from the posterior part to the part of the back
Et sit extensio eorum omnium uice una, donec eleuetur infirmus cum corpore suo a terra, et remaneat pendens.	And let the extension be uniform throughout, until the patient raises himself with his body from the ground, and remains hanging downwards
Et haec enim species extensionis est species communis specierum quatuor.	And this is a common kind of extension among the four kinds of dislocation.
Si ergo redit dislocatio cum eo quod diximus, est bonum: et si non, tunc necesse est omni speciei illud quod dicam de curatione propria.	If, therefore, the dislocation recurs with that which we have said, it is good: and if not, then it is necessary in every case to employ that which we shall say concerning proper treatment.
In reductione quidem eius propria quando dislocatio est ad interiora, oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super latus suum sanum.	In reduction, indeed, its own when the dislocation is inwards, it is necessary that the patient rest on the sound side
Deinde ponat ligamentum super radicem coxae, in eo quod est inter caput coxae, et locum qui est sub inguine.	Then let ligament be placed over the root of the coxae, where the head of the coxae is, and the place under the knee
Deinde extende ligamentum ad sursum a parte inguinis ad altiorem partem corporis, ad partem furculae.	Then extend the ligament upwards from the groin to the higher part of the body, to the part of the collarbone.
Deinde accipiat minister alius fortis brachia eius, et minuat locum grossum coxae infirmae, et extendat ad exteriora extensione uehementi.	Then let another strong hand take hold of the forearm, and move the lower part of the coxae outwards, and extend it outwards with force.
Iam enim redit ad locum suum.	And thus it returns to its place.
Et haec species est facilioris reliquis speciebus curationis, qua reducitur hoc membrum.	And this kind is easier than the rest of the methods for reducing this limb.
Si autem excusatur super te, et non obedit tibi ad introitum cum hac specie curationis omnino: tunc oportet, ut ligentur duo pedes infirmi simul cum ligamento forti, leni, super duos calcaneos, et super duo genua: et sit longitudo cuiusque a compare suo quantitatis quatuor digitorum: et sit crus infirmum extensum plus altero quantitate duorum digitorum.	If, however, you excuse yourself [doctor] and it does not obey you at the entrance with this kind of treatment: then it is necessary to bind the two feet of the patient together with a strong, soft ligament, over the two heels, and over the two knees: and let the length of each be equal to four fingers: and let the limb be extended more than the other by the amount of two fingers.
Deinde suspendatur infirmus super caput ligni, quod sit in domo: et sit longitudo eius a terra quantitas duorum brachiorum.	And suspend the patient over the head of the limb: and let the length of it from the ground be equal to the amount of two arms.
Deinde praecipe iuueni forti, ut muniat caput coxae: et suspendatur cum infirmo inuenis alius: et impellat iuuenis alius, muniens coxam cum fortitudine, nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then command the young man to stretch out the head of the coxae: and suspend it with the patient by means of another: and command the young man to push out the coxae with force, for the joint returns to its place with speed.
In reditione autem eius propria, quando est dislocatio ad exteriora, oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super podium, secundum quod narrauimus in habente gibbositatem.	When the dislocation is outward, the patient must lie upon a board as we have mentioned in the case of gibbosity.
Et stringatur ligamentum super crus eius, infirmum proprie, et super pectus eius.	The ligament must be strapped over the limb itself and over the chest
Deinde ponantur duo ligna, unum apud pedes eius, et alterum apud caput ipsius.	Then two boards are placed, one under the feet and the other under the head
Deinde ponatur lignum additum in medio podii, fixum bene: super quod inuoluti sint panni humidi, ut non laedat infirmum: et sit lignum inter coxas eius, ut non attrahatur ad inferiora apud extensionem.	And a board is placed in the middle of the leg, fixed securely: over which are placed wet cloths, so that it does not cause pain to the patient: and let the board be between the thighs, so that it does not draw towards the lower parts at the extension.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem suam, et medicus aequet reductionem manu sua.	Then extend all the limbs to their proper place, and the physician will equalize the reduction with his hand.
Si ergo obedit ad reuersionem, erit bonum.	If it yields to the reduction, it will be good.
Et si non, pone super ipsam tabulam, et preme ipsam, sicut diximus in gibbositate, aequaliter.	And if it does not, place another board upon it, and press it down, as we said in the case of gibbosity, equally
Verumtamen oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	However it must lie upon its sound side
Et quando dislocatio est ad anteriora, tunc oportet, ut extendatur crus infirmi uelociter: et est secundum hanc eandem narrationem super podium: et ponat medicus palmam manus suae dextrae super inguen infirmum.	And when the dislocation is forward, then it must be extended quickly: and it is according to this narration that the patient is placed upon a board: and the physician places his right hand over the knee of the patient.
Deinde coartet ipsum cum manu altera, et cum illa coartatione pone ipsum extensum ad inferiora ad partem genu.	Then grasp it with the other hand and with this compression place it extended downwards towards the ankle
Et si dislocatio est ad posteriora: tunc non oportet, ut extendatur infirmus ad inferiora, et sit eleuatus super terram: imo oportet, ut sit positus super rem duram, sicut oportet, ut fit etiam si dislocatur ancha eius ad exteriora, secundum illud quod diximus de accubitu eius super duas anchas: et est super faciem eius, et ligamenta extensa: secundum quod diximus nuper.	And if the dislocation is backward: then it must not be extended downwards, but must be elevated above the earth: rather it must be placed upon a firm support, as it must be even if the dislocation is widely outward, as we said concerning its position over two cushions: and it is upon its face and extended ligaments: as we said above.</start_of_turn>
Et oportet, ut administretur compressio cum tabula etiam super locum ad quem egreditur iunctura, cum completur reductio secundum quod oportet.	It is necessary that compression be administered with a board also over the place from which the suture has gone out, when the reduction is completed as required.
Et signum reditionis eius non occultatur tibi: et est, ut extendas duo crura infirmi: et quando uides ea aequalia, et infirmus stringit crus suum, et expandit ipsum absque excusatione: tunc scias, quia iam redit membrum, secundum quod oportet: tunc coniunge duas coxas, et pone emplastrum, et stringe cum imemati, id est, rota: ita, ut non moueatur ancha ad aliquam partium: et adhaereat infirmus quieti tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	The sign of its reduction is not hidden by the board: when you extend two limbs of the patient and, when you have equalized them, and the patient tightens his limb and expands it without straining: then you know that the limb has returned, as required. Then join the two thighs together and place a pad, and bind as before, that is, with a rotation: so that it does not move to any part: and the patient should rest quietly for three days, or four.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et emplastrum, et compara crus cum altero: tunc si uides ea aequalia in statu, tunc scias, quod dislocatio iam firmata est: absolue ergo infirmum ad ambulandum.	Then loosen the ligament and the pad, and compare the limb with the other: then if you find them equal in position, then you know that the dislocation is now firm: absolutely therefore the patient may walk.
Et si uides aliquid mollificationis: tunc redi, et emplastra illud, et stringe illud secundum stricturam tuam primam: et dimitte illud etiam tribus diebus.	And if you find some softening: then reduce it, and put on the pad again, and bind it as you first bound it: and dismiss it also for three days.
Deinde solue illud et fac ipsum tardare in ambulatione super utrumque aliquot diebus, donec confortetur bene.	Then loosen it and make it walk slowly on both sides for a few days, until it is comfortable well enough.
¶ De dislocationis Genu.	Of Dislocation of the Limb.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter 33.
Genu dislocatur secundum tres modos.	The knee is dislocated in three ways.
Dislocatur ad exteriora, ad interiora, et ad inferiora, scilicet ad posteriora.	It is dislocated outwards, inwards, and downwards, that is, posteriorly
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora.	It is not dislocated forwards
Et signum dislocationis eius, est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut applicet crus suum ad coxam suam.	Its sign is that the patient applies his foot to his knee
Si autem non adhaeret cum coxa: tunc scias, quod Genu est dislocatum.	If it does not adhere to the thigh: then you know that the knee is dislocated.
Et restauratio omnium modorum dislocationis eius est, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum, ita ut iam extendat crus suum si potest super illud, et adhaeret dorsum tuum ad faciem eius: et pone pedem eius inter pedes tuos.	And the restoration of all the displaced parts is that you should make the sick man sit upright, so that he may extend his leg if possible over that [affected limb], and adhere your back to his belly: and put his foot between your feet.
Deinde adhaerere fac Genu eius cum palmis tuis, et recta eas inter digitos tuos super Genu eius.	Then adhere his belly to your palms, and make his knee straight between your fingers over his belly.
Deinde applica cum palma tua duo latera Genu eius cum fortitudine.	Then apply with your two palms the two sides of his belly with force.
Et minister alius extendat pedem eius, donec redeat Genu ad locum suum.	And another minister extend his foot, until the limb returns to its place.
Et signum reditionis est, ut adhaereat crus cum coxa in lenitate, non laboriose.	And the sign of recovery is that the leg adheres to the thigh gently, not painfully.
Deinde emplastra ipsum, et adhaerere fac crus cum coxa.	Then plaster it, and adhere the leg to the thigh.
Deinde liga ea simul cum uitta tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then bind it with three days, or four.
Deinde solue ea.	Then make it whole.
Et non utatur infirmus ambulatione aliquot diebus, donec sanetur.	And do not let the patient walk for a few days, until he is healed.
Si autem recusatur tibi reductio eius, tunc administra extensionem fortem cum ligamentis, quorum praecessit narratio in curatione anchae, donec redeat.	If however he resists reduction, then administer forceful extension with ligatures, as has been mentioned in the treatment of an abscess, until it returns
¶ De curatione dislocationis Calcanei.	Until then.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter XXXIII.
Calcaneus quandoque remouetur remotione parua, et quandoque dislocatur secundum complementum.	The calcaneus is sometimes displaced by a small removal, and sometimes by a dislocation in accordance with its completeness
Et dislocatio eius fit, aut ad interiora, aut ad exteriora.	And its dislocation is either inwards or outwards
Et signum dislocationis eius est, quod uides Calcaneum inflatum, procedentem ad partem ad quam dislocatur.	And the sign of its dislocation is that you see the calcaneus swollen, proceeding to the part from which it is displaced
Curatio autem remotionis eius, est facilis reditionis: et est, ut extendatur cum facilitate cum manibus, et aequetur, donec redeat.	The treatment of its removal is easy restoration: it is that you should extend easily with your hands, and equalize, until it returns
In curatione autem eius quando dislocatur secundum complementum, oportet, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum: et teneat ipsum minister fortis ualde a posteriori parte dorsi eius, in medio ipsius.	When the rectum is displaced according to its complement, it is necessary to make the patient sit up and support the minister firmly from the back of the patient's body in the middle.
Deinde tene tu cum manu tua dextra pedem eius a superiori parte eius, et cum manu tua sinistra ab inferiori parte pedis eius loco cauillae.	Then hold the limb with your right hand from the upper part of the foot, and with your left hand from the lower part of the foot at the ankle level
Deinde trahe pedem ad tecum manu tua dextra.	Then draw the foot towards you with your right hand.
Deinde cum sinistra duabus uicibus.	And with your left hand support the two heels.
Deinde extende cum sinistra, et impelle pectus pedis cum dextra uersus crus absque labore.	Then extend with your left hand, and press the heel of the foot with your right hand without straining the limb.
Fac illud bis, sicut narrauimus.	Do this twice as we have said.
Deinde impelle pectus pedis ad crus in uice tertia, et tu trahis cauillam.	Then press the heel of the foot towards the thigh in the third part, and you draw the ankle.
Si ergo redit in uice una, aut in duabus secundum hunc modum, et uides pedem aequatum, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera operationem super ipsum: quoniam ipse redit.	If therefore it returns in one part, or in two parts according to this manner, and you have equalized the foot, it is good: and if not, then repeat the operation upon it: because it will return itself
Si autem prohibetur tibi reductio eius cum eo quod narrauimus: tunc fac iacere infirmum super dorsum suum super terram, et fige paxillum in terra firmatum ualde, ut cadat inter coxas eius: et tu iam inuoluisti super ipsum pannum, ut non laedat infirmum.	If however it is forbidden for you to reduce it as we have said: then make the patient sit on his back on the earth, and fix the heel firmly to the ground at the ankle, so that it rests between his thighs: and you will grasp upon the foot above it, so that it does not pain the patient.
Deinde accipiat minister coxam eius: postea extendat minister alter pedem, aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento quod liget super collum pedis.	Then take hold of the heel of the foot: afterwards extend the other limb of the foot, either with your hands or with a bandage that binds over the ankle bone
Deinde extendat omnis minister contra extensionem comparis sui: et paxillus sit stans inter duas coxas infirmi retinens eum, ut non attrahatur corpus eius ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then extend all the limbs against the extension of each: and the heel will be stable between the two thighs, holding the body from falling downwards towards the extension.
Deinde aequet medicus dislocationem manibus suis, et minister alter teneat crus sanum ad inferiora.	Then the physician will equalize the dislocation with his hands, and the other limb will support the thigh from below
Nam dislocatio redit cum uelocitate.	The displacement returns with velocity.
Quando ergo redit dislocatio, et declaratur tibi sanitas reditionis eius: tunc pone emplastrum et stuppam, et stringe ipsam cum ligamentis firmiter, et liga pedem cum ligamento ad crus.	When the displacement returns, and its soundness is declared: then apply a dressing and bandage, and bind it firmly with ligaments, and bind the limb with a ligament to the thigh.
Et oportet, ut caueas uel timeas de neruis, qui sunt supra calcaneum posterius, ut non sit ligamentum super eos uehemens, et laedat eos.	It is necessary to beware of nerves that lie above the calcaneus, so that there is no tension on the ligament over them, and that it does not cause pain.
Deinde dimitte ipsum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then let it rest for two or three days.
Quod si mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum: deinde solue ipsum in die tertio, aut quarto: et prohibe infirmum ab ambulatione quadraginta diebus.	If the ligament is softened, bind it again: then loosen it on the third or fourth day: and prevent the patient from walking for forty days.
Si uero conatur ambulare ante illud spacium, non fit securitas quin dissoluatur super ipsum dislocatio, et corrumpatur, et non recipiat post illud curationem.	If he nevertheless attempts to walk before that time, there is no security that the displacement will be dissolved, and that it will be ruptured, and will not recover after that treatment
Quod si accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc oportet, ut administres in sedatione eius illud, in quo praecessit narratio nostra in alio loco ex curatione, et embrocationem, donec remoueatur.	If it swells up like a callosus: then it is necessary to manage that in its subsidence, in which place our story proceeds elsewhere for the treatment and embrocation, until it is dissolved
¶ De dislocatione Digitorum pedis, et cura.	Of the dislocation of the toes, and their treatment.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter 5
Oportet, ut aequetur quod dislocatur ex eis cum extensione pauca absque labore: et illud quidem non est difficile, imo est facile.	It is necessary to equalize what is displaced from its place with little effort without toil: and this is not difficult, rather it is easy.
Si autem dislocatio est in quibusdam nodis dorsi pedis: tunc oportet, ut faciat sedere infirmus pedem suum super locum aequalem terrae, aut super tabulam: et est stans sicut ambulans.	If, however, the displacement is in some part of the ankle: then it is necessary to make the patient sit down with the foot resting on the same level as the ground, or on a board: and it is as if he were walking
Deinde tu sta, et pone pedem tuum super illud quod eminet ex illis iuncturis.	Then stay standing, and place your foot on what is above those joints
Deinde calca illud cum pede tuo cum uirtute, donec redeat, et uideas ipsum iam aequatum, et non appareat in loco eminentia.	Then support it with your foot until it returns, and keep it even, and do not let it protrude in a prominent place.
Deinde pone sub uentre pedis eius tabulam quae capiat pedem totum, cui sint duo capita.	Then support it under the foot with a board which grasps the whole foot, which has two heads.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti tribus diebus.	Then bind it tightly with three days' worth of binding.
Deinde solue ipsum, et fac quiescere eum ab ambulatione diebus multis, donec stringatur et securetur a reductione.	Then loosen it, and keep it quiet from walking for many days, until it is bound and secure from reduction.
¶ De speciebus dislocationis cum uulnere uel fractura.	As for the kinds of dislocation with wound or fracture
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter 6.
Quando accidit aliquid ex illo, et conaris curationem eius, et ipsius restaurationem, multotiens succedit mors: et propter illud non oportet, ut praesumat super curationem eius, quod est huiusmodi, nisi qui est prudens in arte longi usus, misericors, pius, tardus, non audax, neque praesumptuosus: et ut utatur in incaeptionce medicinis quae sedant apostemata calida tantum: et dimittat infirmum diuino iudicio.	When anything of this kind happens, and you know its cure and its restoration, many times success follows without doing more: and because of this it is not necessary to go beyond the cure, except for one who is skilled in the art of long stays, merciful, pious, prompt, not cowardly, and not overconfident: and that he should inquire diligently of the physicians who sit in the anteroom of the baths, who indeed only give lukewarm salves.
Nisi uideas, aut speras salutem a perditione cum lenitate aegritudinis, et in quo apparet quiddam spei.	Unless you know, or hope for salvation from perdition with the gentleness of kindness, and in which something appears promising.
Conare ergo reductionem eius statim in principio rei, antequam accidat apostema calidum.	Attempt to reduce it immediately at the beginning of the case, before the swelling becomes cold
Si ergo redit membrum, secundum quod uolumus, tunc administra regimen quod sedat apostema: et cura uulnus cum eo quod conuenit ei ex unguentis desiccatiuis.	If the limb returns, as we wish, then administer a regimen that will rest the swelling: and care for the wound with the things that agree with it from drying agents.
Quod si dislocatio est cum fractura, et accidunt in osse satagiae separatae, tunc conare ablationem earum, et fac in illo quod diximus in aegritudinibus simplicibus ex eo quod praecessit in locis earum.	If the dislocation is with fracture, and the bones are separated in the sitting position, then attempt to break them off, and do in it what we said concerning simple wounds in those places
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, et custodi teipsum ab introitu in uiam timoris: secundum quod praecessit praedicatio mea tibi.	And take care according to your virtue, and protect yourself from the entrance of fear: according to what has gone before in my saying to you.
Nam illud est melius tibi apud Creatorem tuum, et magis permanens ad gloriam tuam, et magis saluum tuo corpori apud illos in tuo tempore.	And that is better for you with your Creator, and more lasting for your glory, and more health for your body in your time.
