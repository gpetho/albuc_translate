of hail (or possibly: about hail) Often there appear on the eyelids things that resemble hail in their shape and hardness, and because of this this disease is called "grandine" (hailstone), and it is a collection of thick moisture in the eyelid above and below; the procedure is as follows: see if the hailstone moves from one side to the other, and this is easy to determine; then cut it widely, then peel it from each side gently, then take it with tweezers, and cut it.	There often occurs in the eyelids a thing resembling a hailstone in its strength and hardness, and therefore called 'hail'. It is actually a collection of thick humours in the upper or lower lid. The operative treatment for it is thus: examine; and if the stone is external on the outer aspect of the lid, and mobile in all directions, dealing with it is simple. You make above it a transverse incision; then scrape gently around it till it is free; then catch it up with a hook and cut it away.	0.7764906
If you cannot cut it without piercing the eyelid a little, it does not harm the patient; and if the cut is large, join it with a suture, and treat it until it is healed; and if it is small, do not force it, for the ointment will soon restore it and generate flesh.	If it is in such a position that you cannot excise it without cutting through the lid, that will not harm the patient at all. If the incision be big, gather it up with a suture and dress it till it heals. If it be small, it will be no trouble, for ointment will restore it and heal it.	0.82292837
And if the hailstone descends inside the ear towards the upper part, turn the eyelid inside out, and stretch the hailstone with tweezers, and cut and press from one side and the other; and if the eyelid is separated by the incision, it does not matter; and when the hailstone is cut, wash the eye with salt water, and treat the area with that which generates flesh until the patient is healed.	If the stone is rather toward the inner aspect of the eyelid, then invert the lid and catch up the stone with a hook—you will not need to incise the lid—and cut it all round. If the lid is pierced in the cutting, it will do no harm at all. Then, after cutting away the stone, wash the eye with salt water; then treat with cicatrizing medicines till healed.	0.77540624
