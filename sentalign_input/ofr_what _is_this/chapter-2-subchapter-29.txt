Sometimes there are gathered at the ends of the teeth, inside the mouth between the gums, scales which are ugly and rough; and sometimes the teeth are black and yellow and green, so much so that the corruption reaches the gums, and the teeth are foul-smelling; so you must have the patient sit between your hands, and his head be on your lap, and scrape the teeth where the scales appear, until nothing remains there; and do the same with the blackness and the greenness, and the yellowness and the other stains, until they are cleaned; and if you remove what is there on the first scraping, that is good; if not, then start scraping again the second day and the third, until you have scraped everything; and know that the teeth require various shapes of instruments for scraping, according to what the work demonstrates, because the scrapers with which one scrapes outside the teeth have different shapes than those with which one scrapes between the teeth; and these shapes and others should be prepared with you.
