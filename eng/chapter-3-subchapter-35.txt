 CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE.
On the kinds of dislocation that accompany a wound or a fracture or both.
 When anything of this kind happens and you attempt treatment and restoration, death is a frequent sequel.
Therefore such treatment should be undertaken only by a person that is skilled in the art, has long experience, is dexterous, sympathetic, cautious, and not reckless or over-bold.
To begin with he should apply only remedies for the allaying of abscesses and then leave the patient to Divine providence, unless, of course, the injury is light enough to give some hope of his escaping death; in which case you should set out to reduce it at once before an abscess arise.
If the part goes back as you wish, employ the treatment for allaying abscesses and dress the wound with suitable desiccant ointments.
If it be a dislocation with a fracture and there occur splintered fragments in the bone, try to remove them, following therein the instructions relating to the simple diseases we have mentioned before in their place.
Use your utmost diligence; keep clear of entering upon a course with a dangerous outcome, as I have enjoined on you before.
For this will best ensure the continuance of your prestige and safeguard your good name, God willing.
