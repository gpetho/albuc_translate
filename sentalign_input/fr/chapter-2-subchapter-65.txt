Of the rupture of the syfac
The occurrence of this rupture happens either by the cut that comes to the membrane (syfac) or the stretching over the belly in the groin area, causing the intestines to descend from that rupture to one of the testicles;
And this rupture is either from the membrane or from its stretching, and these two ways come from many causes: either from a blow, or a jump, or shouting, or lifting heavy loads, and similar things;
And the signs, when it is from the stretching of the membrane, are that it happens little by little, over a long time, and does not come suddenly;
And the abscess is equal to the depth, because the membrane presses the intestine.
And the signs, when it is from the cutting of the membrane, are that it causes sudden pain at the beginning, and the abscess appears differently, just under the skin, because of the issue of the intestine and the body outside the membrane.
And sometimes the omentum descends with the intestine, and it is held there, causing great pain for the patient, especially when it is pressed.
And in these treatments, there is fear of using the knife, which is why it must be avoided.
And the way of the work is that you command the patient to push the intestine back inside the wound with his hand, if he can return it;
Then have him lie on his neck between your hands and lift his thighs;
Then stretch the skin upwards and cut all the skin of the testicles lengthwise;
Then put inside the lips of the cut with hooks as needed to open the wound, and so that the organ can come out;
Then strip the membrane that is under the skin of the testicles until the white membrane is completely uncovered;
Then put your index finger in what follows the testicle, in what is between the white membrane that is under the skin of the testicle, and between the second membrane,
And separate what is behind the testicle and between the second membrane; and then move with the right hand inside the core of the testicles, and stretch the white membrane upwards with your left hand, and lift the testicle along with the membrane towards the cut;
And command the assistant to stretch the testicle upwards, and untie what is behind the attachment;
And search with your fingers if there is any part of the intestine wrapped in the white hard membrane, and if you find anything, push it back into the belly;
Then take a needle with a thick thread made of ten threads, and push it into the back part of the membrane, which is after the skin of the testicles; after the cut, then cut the ends that appear from the threads until there are four threads;
Then assemble them one over the other in the manner of a cross, and tie the membrane, as we have said, which is under the skin of the testicles, with a strong tie in two parts;
Then wrap the ends of the threads and tie them firmly in two parts so that none of the vessels that nourish them can enter in a way that a hot abscess might come;
And then place the tie again according to the first tie, two fingers long from it, and after these two ties leave the membrane that is under the core of the testicles the size of a finger;
And after all the rest according to the roundness that the testicle carries; then cut in the part that is under the skin of the testicles, until the blood and the pus flow, as we have said before;
Then administer wool soaked in oil, and put it in the wounds, and administer the tie that we have mentioned.
And sometimes the white membrane is cauterized, as we have said, after the incision, for fear of blood flow.
For this happens many times, and leave the tie until it falls by itself; and if it delays in falling, then it should be sprinkled with hot water, and put on what we have said, until it falls;
Then treat the wound with other cures until it is perfectly healed.
