of the dislocation of the fingers of the hand
Sometimes the fingers of the hand are dislocated in any direction, sometimes on the back of the hand or on the palm;
then stretch the finger, and push the dislocation with your thumbs until it returns, then support the tip of the finger, and bend it toward the part where it is disjointed;
and leave it for two days, and then set it straight that day; 
and at night bind it, as we have said, and unbind it during the day, and make it move, and bind it again at night;
and do this often, until it is stable, and do the same if it is dislocated on the palm of the hand, and do as you have done before, until it is healed;
and do the same, when it is dislocated elsewhere.
