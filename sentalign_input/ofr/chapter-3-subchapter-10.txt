of the fracture of the hip bone
It rarely happens that the hip bone is broken, and if it happens, it only happens with a small fragmentation at the head;
and cut lengthwise, and lean towards the inside, and the patient feels pain in the area, and a pricking sensation, and swells up where it is broken.
And the restoration is such that you extend your hand over it, until you are over the fracture;
and you know what the fracture is and its shape;
and if the fracture is only at the head, then make this fracture even, so that it is in its natural shape.
And if the fracture is lengthwise, or it leans inwards, then have the patient lie on their stomach, so that the resetting of this fracture is prepared for you.
And when you have set it evenly, then apply the plaster, then put on a splint of wood or leather, and tighten the fracture, so that it does not move;
and pad the place below the ribs, so that the bandage is even.
And instruct the patient to sleep on their healthy side, or on their back.
And if a hot abscess develops there, do not touch it until the hot abscess has subsided, and apply what we have said before;
and then return to the restoration, and tighten it as needed, if there is no adverse event;
and this is the method.
