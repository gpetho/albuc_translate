From line B to line C. When you have evacuated all the fluid from the tumor, pack it with worn cotton and leave it until the next day, then remove the cotton.	Those that contain humidity should be opened with a semicircular incision like this, from b to g. When you have removed all the pus that had been in the tumour, pack the wound with teased-out cotton wool and leave till another day. Then remove the cotton wool and dress with a suitable ointment until healed.	0.66865575
And treat it with the appropriate ointment until it heals. If the tumor is of the type of scrofulous nodes, incise it as we mentioned in the incision on scrofula.  If the wound continues to suppurate, use cautery as we mentioned previously.	Then remove the cotton wool and dress with a suitable ointment until healed. If the tumour be of the nodular scrofulous kind, cut directly down on it just as we prescribed for that kind. If the wound continue to discharge pus, apply the cautery to it as prescribed before.	0.8102057
