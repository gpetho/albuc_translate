Chapter thirty-seven on the excision of the uvula tumor which is called grape.	CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN. On removal of the tumour of the uvula that is called 'uva'.	0.8142426
If a catarrh descends to the uvula and swells and is white and oblong, then it is called 'amood'.	When a flux descends to the uvula and it swells and the uvula becomes white and elongated, then it is called 'columella*.	0.7712977
And if it is thick at the bottom and round, then it is called 'inabah'.	And if it should be swollen below and rounded then it is called 'uva'.	0.82068765
If it is treated with what we mentioned in the division and the treatment is not effective, and you see that the hot swelling has subsided and it is thin, then it should be cut.	When it has been treated as mentioned in its section, and the treatment is unavailing, and you see the inflamed tumour subsiding and the uvula becoming thin, you should amputate it.	0.81251085
And what is of it gathered and round and does not have length and is bloody or the color of pus or black or has no sensation, then it should be avoided cutting it, for there is danger in it for the patient.	Now those of them that are bunched up and rounded and not elongated, full of blood, or of a dark colour or black, and without sensation, these you should avoid incising; for this course is dangerous for the patient.	0.8299264
Then it is necessary, if you see it in the manner that I mentioned of its whiteness and length, that you seat the patient by the sun and compress his tongue with the instrument which was previously described. Then you insert the hook into the 'inabah' and pull it downwards and cut it with one of the two instruments that I mentioned in cutting the tonsils.	But when you see them as I have described, somewhat pale and elongated, get the patient to sit in the sunlight and depress his tongue with the instrument described above; then take hold of the uva with a hook and draw it down and cut it off with one of the two instruments described for excision of the tonsils.	0.821085
And it is necessary that you do not cut from it except that which exceeds the natural order without addition, because if you cut more from it you will harm the voice and speech.	You should not cut away more than up to the natural limit. For if you cut more off you cause injury to the voice and speech.	0.77898365
Then after the cutting, use what we described in cutting the tonsils and treat it until it heals.	Then, after excising, carry on the treatment on the lines described under removal of the tonsils, and treat till healed.	0.8091867
If the patient is afraid of its cutting, then it is necessary that you use a trick in cauterizing it without fear or caution.	But if the patient flinch from operation, then you must contrive to cauterize it, fearlessly and boldly.	0.6927422
And the way of cauterizing it is only with the strong medicine, which is that you place the head of the patient in your lap, then you compress his tongue with the instrument that we mentioned. Then you take from the strong water which I mentioned in the chapter of cauterization and mix with it unquenched lime and make it neither thick nor thin and fill from it the cavity of this instrument and this is its image:	The method is to employ a caustic; you put the patient's head in your lap; then, having depressed the tongue with the instrument described above, take some of the corrosive fluid mentioned in the book on cauterization, make it up with quicklime to a medium consistency, and fill with it the hollow in this instrument, whose form is thus.	0.7753389
Its end, in which you place the medication, has a concavity like the concavity of a cautery spoon.	The end of it where you put the caustic should have a hollow like that of the spoon of a spoonprobe.	0.7831467
And you place the instrument with the medication on the uvula itself, with the patient lying on his side so that the saliva flows from his mouth from inside his throat, lest anything descend from it into his throat and harm him.	With the patient lying on his side, letting the mucous secretions flow from his gullet out of his mouth so that none of the corrosive may run down his gullet and cause harm, you place the instrument right on the uvula.	0.8301582
Then you hold the medication with your hand and you squeeze it on the uvula for about half an hour until you see that it has blackened and the sting of the medication has subsided.	Then, steadying the hand that is holding the medicament, press it out on to the uvula for the space of half an hour until you see the uvula turn black and the corrosive action cease.	0.90838253
And if you wish, you can take cotton and wrap it around the tip of a cautery iron, and soak the cotton in the medication, and insert the cautery iron with the cotton in a tube from above until the cotton adheres to the uvula; you do this repeatedly until you achieve what you want from cauterizing the uvula, then you leave it, for it will wither and fall off after three or four days.	If you wish, you can take some cotton wool twisted on the end of a probe, and, having soaked it in the caustic, apply the probe with the wool, down through a cannula till the wool sticks on the uvula. Do this over and over again till you have done all the cauterization you want, then let be; for it will shrink and fall off in three or four days.	0.9002166
If you need to reapply the medication, you reapply it.	If you need to repeat the treatment, do so.	0.7816666
And after the cauterization, you wipe around the uvula with cotton soaked in ghee and dry the medication around it with it.	After the cauterization, wipe all round the uvula with wool soaked in butter, and with that mop up all the caustic remaining round about it.	0.77332556
Then he gargles with cold water and is treated externally with poultices and internally with gargles until he recovers.	Then let him rinse his mouth out with cold water and do you treat with external embrocations, and gargles within, till he is well.	0.78087896
So, this type of treatment is safer than excision and further from fear.	This kind of treatment is safer than incision and less to be feared.	0.82434916
And the uvula can also be treated with something gentler than cauterization and excision: it is treated with fumigation in this manner. Take lavender, hyssop, savory, rue, wormwood, chamomile, and artemisia, and similar herbs, and gather them all or some of them in a pot and immerse them in vinegar and boil them, and the pot is lined with lute of wisdom, and there is a hole in the middle of the lid on which the hollow instrument is mounted; it is made in this way from silver or copper:	Sometimes uva is cured by a method milder than either incision or cautery, namely by means of vapour in the following manner: take pennyroyal and artemisia absinthium and organy and rue and wormwood and chamomile and southernwood and similar herbs and put them all, or some of them, in a pot, cover them with vinegar, and boil them.	0.751077
And you insert the end that contains the pomegranate into the patient's mouth so that the vapor rises to the uvula through the tube until the uvula is well fumigated.	The pot should be luted with clay; and there is to be a hole in the middle of the lid to which is fitted a hollow instrument like this, made of silver or bronze, and the end in which is the protuberance should be put in the patient's mouth so that the vapour passes up the tube to the uvula, which becomes of a very dark colour.	0.5179877
Then you repeat it several times until it withers.	Do this repeatedly till it sloughs away.	0.75269365
And beware of doing this treatment at the first appearance of the swelling, because it often increases the swelling. But it is appropriate to do this when its hot swelling subsides.	Be careful not to apply this treatment at the first appearance of the tumour, for often you will aggravate the tumour; but you should do it at the decline of the inflammation.	0.7926155
If this instrument is not available to you, then take a reed and attach an eggshell to its end so that the patient's mouth does not burn, because the eggshell prevents the heat of the vapor from burning the mouth.	If you do not have this instrument, take a reed and fit an egg-shell on the end so that the patient's mouth is not burned; for the egg-shell will prevent the heat of the vapour from burning the mouth.	0.9553048
And this is among the best treatments, along with its safety.	This is a really good and safe treatment.	0.62585825
