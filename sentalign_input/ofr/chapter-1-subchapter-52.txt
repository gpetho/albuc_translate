The treatment with fire by iron/cautery
There is another type of disease which is called "corrodens", and it is nothing other than a consumption of the limb, for it consumes the limbs as fire does dry wood.
If you see this disease in a place that can tolerate cautery with fire, then heat the cauteries, both small and large nails, according to what is suitable for the place where the disease is;
afterwards cauterize it on all sides until you eradicate all the corruption, and none of it remains, so that everything that is corrupted is removed.
And then leave it for three days, and apply on the cauterized areas crushed sulfur with oil until the burns from the fire are gone, and all the corruption.
Afterwards treat it with ointments that generate flesh.
And if you see after three days that healthy flesh is not growing, it is good; 
and if not, then repeat the cauterization on what remains of the corrupted areas.
And this affliction was sometimes treated with sharp medicine instead of fire cautery;
but nevertheless fire cautery is of greater benefit, and I have already described the treatment with sharp medicine in the section:
take it when you have need of it.
