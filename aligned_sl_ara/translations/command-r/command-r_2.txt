When I had completed this book for you, my sons, which is a part of medical science in its entirety and which I have made clear and explicit, I saw fit to complete it with this chapter which is a part of manual work.
For manual work is perfected in our country and our time, it has completely ceased to exist, so that its science is almost forgotten and its practice discontinued. And there only remains a little of it in the books of our predecessors, which has been corrupted by hands and mistaken by error and confusion until its meanings became obscure and its benefits distant.
So I saw fit to revive it, compose this chapter in the style of explanation and clarification and concision, and bring the designs of cautery irons and all other surgical instruments as it is part of further clarification and among what is most needed.
The reason why there is no skilled artisan in our time is because the art of medicine is long, and its practitioner ought to be trained beforehand in anatomy as described by Galen. So that he may be aware of the benefits, structures and temperaments of the organs, their connections and disconnections, as well as knowledge of bones, nerves, muscles; their number, exits, arteries - both pulsating and still, and where they emerge.
Hence said Hippocrates that doctors by name are many but in reality few, especially in the art of surgery; we have mentioned some of this at the beginning of this book.
Because whoever is not knowledgeable about what we have mentioned of anatomy, it will be inevitable that he falls into errors and kills people with them, as I have often witnessed among those who merely imagine themselves to possess this science without knowledge or understanding.
For I have seen an ignorant physician who made an incision on a cystic tumor in a woman's neck, thereby severing some of the carotid arteries, causing such profuse bleeding that the woman died before his very eyes.
I have also seen another physician who was overly hasty in removing a large stone from the bladder of an elderly man, and he did so by cutting away a piece of the bladder wall. The man died within three days, and although I was called upon to remove the stone, upon seeing its size and the patient's condition, I deemed it too risky.
I have also seen another physician who made a living from practicing medicine under the patronage of one of the leaders in our town.
There was a case of a young black boy with a fracture near his heel and an accompanying wound, and this physician, in his ignorance, hastily bound the fracture to the wound with bandages and splints too tightly, without allowing any ventilation for the wound.
He then left the boy to his own devices for several days, instructing him not to loosen the bindings until the boy's leg and foot had become severely swollen and he was on the brink of death.
I was called to attend him, and upon quickly loosening the bindings, he found relief from his pains, but damage had already been done to the limb, and I could do nothing to reverse it.
The decay continued to spread through the limb until he perished.
I have also seen another physician who incised a cancerous tumor, which later became ulcerated after several days, greatly worsening the patient's condition; this is because when cancer is purely of black bile, it should never be treated with the knife.
Except if it is in a member that can entirely be excised.
And so, my son, you should know that work done by hand is divided into two types: action accompanied by safety and action which in most cases results in damage.
I have cautioned you at every point where this book mentions procedures that are hazardous and risky, so you must be wary of them and refuse to perform them.
Lest the ignorant find a way to speak and criticize, take for yourself caution and vigilance, and for your patients, take gentleness and thoroughness.
Use the best approach that leads to safety and a commendable outcome, and avoid dangerous diseases that are difficult to heal.
Purify yourselves from anything that you fear will cast doubt upon your religion and your worldly affairs, for it is more enduring for your reputation and will raise your status in this world and the hereafter.
As Galen said in some of his advice, 'Do not treat the sick with evil, lest you become known as evil physicians.'
This chapter has been divided into three sections.
Section one.
The first section, on cauterization with fire and sharp medication, is categorized and organized from the head to the foot, including illustrations of instruments and cautery irons, as well as all that is required for work done by hand.
Section two.
Section two, on incisions, punctures, bloodletting, cupping, surgery, and arrow removal, is categorized and organized with illustrations of the instruments.
The third book.
In reduction, dislocation, treatment of stiffness and the like; arranged in an orderly manner from head to foot along with diagrams of instruments.
The first book.
On cauterization.
Before we describe the procedure, it is necessary to mention its benefits and drawbacks, as well as in which condition it should be employed.
Discussing the benefits and drawbacks of cauterization is a lengthy discourse, an intricate science and a subtle secret; several sages have spoken on this matter.
There is divergence of opinion among them; I have abridged their discussion for fear of prolixity.
Cauterization is generally beneficial for any unhealthy condition that involves an excess of humour, be it material or immaterial; this includes all but two conditions: the hot condition without material humour and the dry condition without material humour.
As for the dry condition with material humour, there is disagreement; some say that cauterization is beneficial in this case, while others argue to the contrary that it is not suitable for illnesses stemming from heat and dryness, because fire has a hot and dry nature.
It is impossible to treat an illness that is hot and dry with a remedy that has a hot, dry nature; those who argue against cauterization say that treating such illnesses with fire might be beneficial. When you add the human body with its moisture to the nature of fire, you render the human body cold.
And I say as he does, because experience has revealed this to me on numerous occasions; however, one should not presume such matters unless they are well-versed and practiced in the art of cauterization. He understood the variations in people's temperaments and the states of illnesses, their causes, symptoms, and duration.
As for the other temperaments, you need not fear them, especially in cases of cold, damp illnesses; all physicians agree upon this and have no disagreement regarding the benefit of cauterization in such cases.
Know, my sons, that one of the secrets to healing is cauterization with fire, and its superiority over caustic medicines; for fire is a single entity whose action does not extend beyond the part cauterized, nor does it harm any other connected organ, except in a minor way.
Whereas cauterization with caustic medicines may extend its action to other organs and could potentially cause illness that is difficult to treat, or even be fatal; fire, due to its nobility and the purity of its essence, will not do so unless there is an excess [of heat].
This has become clear to us through experience, due to our long service, attention to practice, and understanding of the facts.
For this reason, I have refrained from a lengthy discourse; were it not inappropriate for this book of mine, I would have presented to you a profound secret regarding fire and its action on the body, and how it eliminates illness - in philosophical, logical terms that are beyond your comprehension.
Know, my sons, that they [the physicians] have disagreed on the best time for cauterization; some say it is during the spring season.
I say that cauterization is beneficial at all times because the harm caused by time itself is outweighed by the benefits gained through cauterization. Especially if cauterization is for strong and urgent pains that cannot bear delay, due to the fear of a subsequent affliction which may be greater than the minor harm caused by time.
And do not assume, my sons, what the general public and ignorant physicians may believe, that cauterization which cures a certain disease will never recur and thus should be mandatory.
The matter is not as they have presumed, for cauterization is akin to a medication that alters the temperaments and dries up the humors which are the cause of pains.
However, cauterization is preferred over medication due to its swift success, potent efficacy, and powerful influence.
And it is possible for the disease to return at some point in time, depending on the temperament of the patient, the severity of their illness, and any underlying conditions present in their body due to dietary habits or other factors.
Unless the disease being treated with cauterization is a mild one, affecting a part of the body that has fewer humors and moistures. For instance, cauterizing a tooth to relieve pain may prevent the recurrence of that pain, especially in less severe cases.
And as for the common belief that cauterization is a last resort in medicine, this statement is correct but not in the way they intend it. They assume that no treatment can be effective after cauterization with medication or otherwise, which is not always true.
The meaning of the statement 'burning is the last resort in medicine' is that we, when we have used all forms of treatment for a disease and they are not effective, then as a final recourse we use cauterization, which proves successful. It is from this point that the expression 'burning is the last resort in medicine' has arisen. No, it does not mean what the public and many ignorant physicians believe.
The ancients have mentioned that cauterization with gold is better than iron, and they said this because of the moderation of gold and the nobility of its essence. They claim that the site of cauterization does not become ulcerated; however, this is not entirely true.
For I have tested this, and found that it only acts in such a manner on some bodies and not others; cauterization with gold is better than iron as they say, but when you heat the gold instrument over fire, it is difficult to determine how hot it has become due to the redness of the gold.
And because it quickly becomes cold, and if you increase the heat it will melt in the fire, which causes difficulty for the practitioner; therefore cauterization with iron is faster and more suitable to use, God willing.
I have organized this chapter on cauterization into sections, from the head to the foot, so that it is easier for the student to find what they need; God willing.
Chapter 1.
For the head, there is one cauterization site.
This cauterization is beneficial for an excess of moisture and coldness in the brain, which are causes of headache, frequent sneezing towards the eyes and ears, excessive sleeping, toothache, and sore throat. In summary, for every disease caused by coldness such as paralysis, epilepsy, stroke and their likes.
This cauterization is to first order the patient to purge and take purgative medication that purifies the head for three or four nights according to the strength of the patient, their age, and their habits.
Then you should order the patient to shave their head with a razor, then have them sit in front of you cross-legged with their hands on their chest.
Then place the base of your palm on their nose between their eyes, where your middle finger ends, mark that spot with ink.
Then heat the olive-shaped cautery tool, which is illustrated here:" [Illustration of an olive-shaped cautery iron]
Scrape the bone until a hole is made as big as a cumin seed or an oat grain, then lift your hand away, unless you need to repeat this with the same iron or another one if it has cooled down. Do this until you see what I've described to you in the bone, then take some salt, dissolve it in water and soak a piece of cotton in it, place it on the spot and leave it there for three days.
Then apply to it a piece of cotton soaked in butter, leave it there until the sizzling sound stops, then treat with the four-ingredient ointment until they are healed, God willing.
It has been said that the longer a wound remains open, expelling pus, the better and more beneficial it is.
Some have suggested cauterizing the skin down to the bone, holding the iron there until some of the bone's thickness burns away; then you strip off what has been burnt from the bone and treat it afterwards.
Others said one should cauterize extensively until it affects the bone strongly, so that something like a kernel or small bead falls from the bone. They claimed that this releases vapors from that spot and leaves the wound open for a long time.
Then it should be treated until it heals, and I do not see these two types of cauterization at all, except in some people on the path of risk. In my opinion, avoiding it is better. And farewell if the head becomes weak when its natural connection is broken, as we have observed in other body parts.
Especially if the patient's head is naturally weak, the first type of cauterization is safer and better in my view. I use this method and have been successful with it, God willing.
Chapter Two.
On cauterizing the head, as well.
If a patient has chronic pain in the head, and this persists for some time despite using various treatments like eyrarges, qogais, snuffs, ointments, and dressings—especially if they have already undergone one type of cauterization as described above without any benefit—then consider the following. If the patient's head is naturally strong in constitution, not weak, and they experience severe coldness, cauterize another spot just above that one. Then cauterize each corner of their head until the skin thins out, exposing the bone as described. Cauterize another spot at the back of their head, in an area known as 'the axe.' Be gentle with this one and do not expose the bone, for the patient will experience severe pain unlike any other cauterization on the head.
The iron used to cauterize the horns and the back of the head should be more delicate than that used for the middle of the head. This is its image.
Chapter 3.
In which acute (non-chronic) headache.
If a pain occurs in the half of the head with headache and this pain extends to the eye, purge the patient by using medicines that clarify the brain and use other treatments mentioned before for various illnesses. If these are not effective, cauterization is performed on two sides (of the head). It can be either by using a very strong medicine that burns or an iron (tool).
As for cauterization with a burning medicine, you should take one clove of garlic, peel it and cut its ends from both sides, then make an incision in the place of pain on the temple with a wide scalpel until there is enough room under the skin to accommodate the clove.
Insert it under the skin until it is no longer visible, then tightly pack it with a bandage and leave for about fifteen hours, after which you remove it (the garlic) along with the gauze and let the wound rest for two or three days before proceeding to the next steps.
Apply a piece of cotton soaked in butter until it becomes inflamed and treat it with ointment until it is healed, if God wills. Alternatively, you may use some of the burning medicines mentioned in chapter eighteen on burning medicines.
As for cauterization with an iron, it should be done as follows: heat the iron that looks like this (image).
And it is called the spiked cautery because its head is shaped like a nail, with some curvature and a small projection in the middle.
Then you place it on the painful spot, holding your hand and turning the rod a little at a time; the amount of skin burned should be half its thickness. You lift your hand so as not to burn the artery below and cause bleeding; then you soak a cotton pad in salt water and place it on the spot, leaving it for three days. Then you treat the cotton with lard, and then you treat it with ointment until it heals, God willing.
And if you wish, cauterize this headache with the blunt end of the rod, taking care not to cut the artery in this acute headache especially.
Chapter four.
Treatment of chronic headache.
If you treat the headache with what we have mentioned in the previous treatments and in the chapters on diseases, and it does not improve, and you see that the condition requires something beyond what we have mentioned of cauterization with medication or fire. You should heat the blunt end of the cauterizing rod until it is white hot; you mark a line on the painful spot that is half an inch or thereabouts long, and you leave your hand resting once as you pull it to cut through the artery and expose the bone.
You should be careful not to cauterize near the joint where the jaw moves during chewing, as you may burn the muscle or nerve that controls it, causing spasms.
And take care and beware of the hemorrhage from the artery you have cut, for in it lies great risk. Especially if you do not know what to do, or have no prior experience in this area; it is better to leave such work.
The treatment of accidental arterial hemorrhage will be mentioned in its appropriate chapter, if God wills; should you see a condition which is not addressed by this cauterization method.
If the patient's condition is tolerable, apply a cauterization to the center of the head as described previously; treat the wound until it heals (if God wills).
You may use the cauterization method described in the chapter on 'Ligation of Artery with Hot Iron and Knife', which is superior to this technique.
Chapter Five.
On cauterization for earaches.
If an earache occurs due to cold and is treated with purgatives and other methods mentioned previously, but the pain persists, heat up the iron called 'An-Nuqta', which looks like this: [image]
Then, after heating it up, apply the iron all around one ear (or both ears if necessary) in a circular motion. Keep the cauterization away from the base of the ear, marking its position with ink; apply ten dots or so to each ear, then treat the wounds until they heal (if God wills).
Chapter Six.
Regarding the treatment of dislocation.
The dislocations that are treated by cauterization are those caused by phlegm, as I mentioned in the sections on diseases.
And cauterization should be avoided for dislocations caused by dryness and nerve contraction.
When you have treated this type of dislocation with earpips, snuff, and gargles, and your treatment has not been effective, the patient should be cauterized three times. One at the base of the ear, the second just below his temple, and the third at the corner of his mouth.
Make sure your cauterization is on the opposite side of the affected area, because relaxation occurs on the side that appears healthy.
The cauterization process involves burning the patient with a hot iron, once just below the top of the ear and another on the temple; the length should be equivalent to that of your thumb.
Lower your cauterizing hand until it burns approximately half the thickness of the skin; this is what the cautery looks like, and it is a type of small knife that has been described before but is slightly more delicate, as you can see. The knife should be slightly thicker than usual, and then you treat the wound as described previously until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Seven
Regarding the treatment of chronic stroke.
If the stroke becomes chronic, you treat it as we have described previously; and if this is not effective, and there is no fever present in the patient, cauterize him four times. On each horn of his head a cauterization, and a cauterization in the middle of the head as mentioned, and a cauterization at the back of the head as previously explained.
The cauterization recipe as previously explained, and one may also cauterize with a cauterization on the stomach's mouth, which would be more effective, then treat it as previously mentioned.
Chapter eight.
In cauterization of forgetfulness.
For that which is caused by phlegm, the patient should first be given large doses of ayurvedic medicines and brain-cleansing grains.
Then his entire head should be shaved, and a poultice of mustard, as written in the article on poultices, is applied to the back of his head for several applications; this is a form of cauterization.
Do this on the same rank as mentioned there, and if he is cured thus, then it is well; otherwise cauterize him three times at the back of his head in a straight line from the top of the head to the nape of the neck.
Let there be the breadth of a finger between each cauterization, then treat the cauterizations as previously explained; if you wish to increase it and the patient is able to bear it, then cauterize him on the middle spot.
If you wish to increase it further, then cauterize him on the horns, and treat him until he is cured; the cauterizing iron should be olive-shaped as previously described.
Chapter nine.
In cauterization for paralysis and relaxation of the entire body.
You should first proceed with the purification of the head using auras, as mentioned previously. Then shave the patient's head and cauterize it in the center, on each side towards the back, and at the nape of the neck.
Cauterize three times on the vertebrae of the neck; if you need more for a case of body relaxation, and if the patient can withstand it and the disease is strong, then cauterize four times over the vertebrae in their back. Go to the extreme with cauterization, burning most of the skin; then lift your hand and treat it as previously described until it is healed, God willing. The cauterizing instrument should be olive-shaped.
Chapter Ten.
On cauterization for epilepsy.
The person with epilepsy should be cauterized if their seizures are caused by phlegm; first, the brain must be purified using large auras and other treatments mentioned in the previous section, provided the patient is an adult and can tolerate medication.
For a child who cannot tolerate medication, gargles and chewed medicines that purify the brain should be used many days in advance while improving their diet.
Then shave their head, then cauterize once in the center of the head as previously described and another at the nape. If the patient is strong and can tolerate it, cauterize as mentioned for cases of facial paralysis and body relaxation on the vertebrae in the neck and back; use an olive-shaped instrument as previously described.
If the patient is a child, make the cautery instrument fine and delicate like this.
Chapter Eleven.
In cauterizing melancholy (i.e., treating melancholia by cautery).
If the cause of melancholia is corrupt humours and thick phlegm, apply the same cautery techniques we mentioned for the patient with hemiplegia.
If the cause of melancholia is an excess leaning towards black bile, and the patient's body is moist, administer a purgative to cleanse the brain as mentioned previously in the classification (i.e., the section on melancholy in the textbook).
Then shave the patient's head, create a tight cake-like pad from linen, shaped like a circle, and place it on the top of their head while they sit cross-legged holding [the pad] from each side. Then take one pound of old sheep's butter (i.e., ghee).
Heat it over a fire to a moderate temperature, as hot as the finger can bear when inserted into it, then empty [the ghee] in the circle on top of their head and leave it until cooled. Do this for the patient once per week along with all other good management until they recover, God willing.
And if you wish, you may cauterize with many small punctate marks without holding the cautery instrument in your hand but instead keeping it close (to the patient's body); this type of cautery moistens the brain moderately.
Then place upon it a piece of cotton wool soaked in ghee or chicken fat (i.e., apply this topically to the cauterized area).
Chapter Twelve.
On the cauterization of a water cyst in the eye.
If it becomes apparent to you that there is the onset of a water cyst in the eye, with the signs mentioned previously, then treat the patient promptly by cleaning his head and protecting him from all moisture. Make him sweat in the bathhouse before breakfast for several days.
Then ask him to shave his head and cauterize one spot in the middle of the skull. Then cauterize two spots on the temples, whether there is a water cyst in both eyes or only one eye.
Then cauterize all the veins and arteries under the skin with the iron, making the cauterizations long and broad across both temples. Be careful to avoid excessive bleeding.
If you see any bleeding, stop it immediately with whatever treatment is available to you. We will discuss the details of extracting and ligating arteries while avoiding hemorrhage in a later chapter.
Two intense cauterizations may be applied to the nape of the neck, below the two bones.
Chapter 13.
On the cauterization of chronic tearing.
If the tearing from the eye is chronic and continuous, and it originates from the veins and arteries on the outside of the head, and you ascertain that this is due to an excess of cold, thick, phlegmatic humor, then cauterize exactly as I described in the previous chapter on the onset of a water cyst. Cauterize one spot in the middle of the skull, two spots on the temples, and two spots at the nape of the neck below the two bones. If further treatment is required, cauterize one spot on each side near the tail of the eye, at the edge of the eyebrow, with a small iron.
Chapter Fourteen.
In cauterizing the nose.
If you treat it as mentioned in the division and the treatment is not effective, then take the patient to an isolated place for three nights, then shave his head and cauterize the middle spot with an oily iron. Then cauterize with the screwed iron two spots above the eyebrows, slightly under the hair, and be careful not to cut into the artery. This is an image of the screwed iron.
Chapter Fifteen.
In relaxing the eyelid through cauterization.
If the eyelid relaxes due to illness or moisture, cauterize the eyelid with one spot using this crescent iron.
If you wish, cauterize slightly above the eyebrows with two spots on each side, away from the temples, and make each spot as long as the eyebrow.
Do not exaggerate with your hand in cauterizing, just enough to burn a third of the skin, and this is an image of how the iron should look like.
Chapter Sixteen.
In cauterizing the eyelid.
If the eyelashes turn inwards and irritate the eye, cauterization is of two types. One method is cauterizing with fire, and for this, the patient should be instructed to stop plucking their eyelashes beforehand so they can grow long and even.
If you pluck it at its root, bind his eyes with a bandage so that they do not move until it grows back. Once it has regrown and healed, place the patient's head in your lap, then mark on the eyelid with ink a sign shaped like a bay leaf.
The mark should start near the lashes, then place under the eyelid cotton soaked in egg white or in seed of psyllium juice, then heat this iron as shown [in the illustration].
Then cauterize according to the shape marked, little by little in many sessions, until the entire surface of the skin is burned, which will be like a bay leaf, especially outwardly. The sign of success is seeing that the eyelid has been retracted and the hair raised from the eye muscle.
Then raise your hand and leave it for three days, then apply cotton soaked in lard until the scab comes off. Then treat with ointment until it heals, God willing. If any hair returns after some time and the eyelid becomes slack, repeat this process.
Repeat the cauterization on that spot as you did first. If the hair is in the lower eyelid, remove it until it regrows to its natural position and does not irritate the eye. As for chemical cauterization, this is when you instruct the patient to let their lashes grow long and even.
Then make a paper pattern of a bay leaf and take one dram or so each of common soap and quicklime, then grind both together well. Do this quickly to prevent drying. Then spread it over the paper you made in a bay leaf shape, placing this on one or both eyelids and putting under the eye cotton soaked in egg white, with the patient's head in your lap.
Place your index finger over the medicine and squeeze it slightly as you move it whenever the patient feels a stinging sensation from the medicine, for he will feel a sting like fire. As long as he feels the sting, leave the medicine in place and continue moving it with your finger. Once the stinging stops, remove the medicine and rinse the eye with water.
Look, if you see the eyelid has risen as it does when exposed to fire or cut open, otherwise, apply more medicine to the area that was not affected by the medicine and did not turn black until your work is complete and the eye has healed. Then place cotton with butter on it until the scab from the burn falls off.
Then treat it with palm oil ointment or another similar one until it heals. When working, you should be extremely careful to ensure that none of the medicine falls into the eye. If after a few days the eyelid becomes relaxed and there is a chance that something might have gotten in the eye...
Reapply the medicine to that relaxed area of the eyelid, as you did initially, then treat it until it heals. This is an image of a bay leaf.
Be aware that people's eyes can vary in size, some being smaller and others larger. Base your treatment on this variation accordingly. For those with experience in this field, the correct approach will be obvious.
Chapter Seventeen.
On cauterizing the fistula which occurs in the corners of the eye.
If you treat the fistula as mentioned in the previous chapters on diseases, and your treatment is not effective, it should be cauterized in this manner.
Instruct the patient to place their head in your lap, and have a servant hold their head between your hands firmly enough that it does not move or shake.
Then place a cotton pad soaked in egg white or the saliva of berberis on their eyes, then heat the iron depicted below.
It should be hollow like the quill of an eagle's feather on one end, where the cauterizing is done. If you wish, the other end can be perforated, and if you prefer, it could also be solid like a pencil, though this hollow one is better for your work, God willing.
Then squeeze the fistula if it is open, and drain any pus from it; dry it thoroughly or open it up if it is closed, extracting all its pus. Then place the red-hot iron on it, holding it with your hand until you reach bone.
Move your hand slightly away from the eye towards the nose when cauterizing, to avoid any mistakes or disturbing the patient, lest the iron fall into the fleshy part of the eye and damage it. If you reach bone in the first pass, well and good; otherwise, reapply the hot iron a second time if needed.
Leave it for three days, then apply a cotton pad with butter and treat it with the drying ointment until it heals. If after forty days there is still no healing, apply caustic medicine to expose bone; denude it according to what will be mentioned later in its section, God willing.
An alternative method for cauterizing fistulas, as mentioned by some early authorities: Incise the fistula site and place within this incision a thin funnel like this one.
Pour in it the weight of a dirham of melted lead, and hold your hand over the funnel tightly bound; do not allow the sick person to move at all lest the molten lead flow into his eye; you should place on the patient's eye some cotton moistened with egg white or water.
For the lead will burn and heal the fistula in a wonderful way; if the fistula is healed by the cauterization and treatment mentioned, then no other course must be taken except to use perforation of the nose, and return the fistula to the course of the nose as shall come in its more specific place.
Chapter 18.
On the cauterization of cleft lip.
A cleft called 'al-sha'rah' frequently occurs in the lips, especially those of boys; if you treat this with what we have mentioned under its section and it does not work, then heat a small lancet-shaped cautery like this:
Its hollow should be as thin as a knife, then put it on the wound while hot with quick action so that the cauterization reaches the depth of the cleft; then treat it with qirouti until it heals God willing.
Chapter 19.
On the cauterization of fistula occurring in the mouth.
If a swelling occurs at the root of the gums, or on the palate, or at the roots of the molars, and it discharges pus and then bursts, leaving as its result a fistula; if you treat this and the treatment is not effective, then heat a cautery of such size as will fill the fistula.
Then insert it, hot, into the fistula opening and hold your hand until the iron is heated to its depths and extremity. Do this once or twice; then treat it as we have mentioned above, until it is healed, God willing.
If the medicine stops flowing and it heals, then that is fine; but if not, you must examine the place and remove the decayed bone as will be explained later, God willing.
Chapter Twenty.
In extraction of loose molars and gums.
If the gums become loose due to moisture, and the molars move, treat them with medicine; if it is not effective, then place the patient's head in your lap, then heat the cautery iron - as shown in the following image - after placing the tube on the molar.
Insert the hot iron with the wheel, and hold your hand for a little while until the patient feels the heat of the fire reaching the root of the molar; then lift your hand and reinsert the iron as many times as you wish; afterwards, have the patient rinse their mouth with salt water.
Let the patient hold it in their mouth for an hour, then spit it out; the loose molars will become fixed and the relaxed gums tightened, drying up the harmful moisture.
Chapter Twenty-One.
In cauterization for toothache.
If the toothache is due to cold or worms, and treatment with medicine is not effective, cauterization can be performed in two ways: either with butter or with fire.
To cauterize with butter, you should take cow's butter and boil it in a metal ladle or shell, then take cotton, wrap it around the end of a rod, dip it into the boiling butter, place it on the aching tooth swiftly, and hold it there until it cools down.
Then repeat the process several times until the heat reaches the root of the tooth; or, if you wish, dip a piece of wool or cotton in cold butter and place it on the aching tooth, then put a heated iron above it until the heat reaches the bottom of the tooth.
Alternatively, cauterization with fire can be done using a copper or iron pipe, which should have some thickness to prevent the heat from reaching the patient's mouth; then, heat up the cautery tool as shown in the illustration and place it on the same tooth, holding your hand there until the tool cools down. Repeat this process several times.
The pain should subside, either on the same day or the next; afterward, the patient should fill their mouth with good-quality butter and hold it for an hour before spitting it out. This is a depiction of the cautery tool.
Cauterize using whichever end you prefer, as appropriate; this is an illustration of the pipe.
Chapter Twenty-Two.
On the cauterization of warts.
If warts are caused by phlegm and cold moisture, and they do not respond to medication but require quick maturation, then heat up the hollow cautery tool with openings at both ends, as shown in this illustration.
To draw out the smoke during cauterization from the other end, place it over the same swelling once and again if necessary until you reach its depth; should the swelling be small then make the iron to fit that swelling.
Then leave it for three days and apply a lint soaked in suet until the part burned by fire is cured, then treat it with ointment and pledgets so that it may heal God willing.
Chapter Twenty-Three.
On cauterization for hoarseness of voice and shortness of breath.
If phlegm predominates in the pulmonary artery, especially if this is accompanied by a cold constitution, the patient ought first to be evacuated by cathartics and then cauterized at the nape of the neck where the gullet ends.
Take care not to reach the gullet with your cauterization nor burn more than half of the skin, then cauterize it again at the articulation of the neck just below its lowest point most thoroughly; and let the iron be pyramidal in shape as previously described.
Then treat him with what has been mentioned until he heals God willing.
Chapter Twenty-Four.
On cauterization for pulmonary disease and cough.
If cough and pulmonary disease are owing to cold phlegm, if the patient has no fever nor consumption, and his complaint is chronic in character; then cauterize him twice above the clavicle at its lowest, softest, and least prominent part, and once more over the sternum between the breasts.
The cautery should be nail-shaped as previously described, and if you wish your cauterization to be dotted, use the cautery known as 'the dot', whose shape has already been given for dotting earache. The dots may range from thirty to about that number.
Then treat it as previously mentioned until it heals. You may make a cautery with three prongs in this shape, which will hasten the cauterization because you can cauterize three spots at once. This is its shape.
Chapter Twenty-Five
On cauterizing the armpit.
If the head of the humerus dislocates due to slippery moisture, or if it is not fixed when reduced so that it becomes habitual and then dislocates again at the slightest movement, as we have seen it happen, the jaw should first be opened. Then have the patient lie on his back or on his right side, and lift up the skin inside the armpit with your left hand if the joint dislocates inward.
Then heat up the cautery with two prongs, which is shaped like this.
Then cauterize the skin with it until it penetrates to the other side, and the shape of the cauterization will be four dots; you may also cauterize with a three-pronged instrument, in which case the shape of the cauterization will be six dots. The prongs should be as thin as veins.
This is its shape.
One may add one to this number, making the cauterizations eight; then apply ground turnips with salt on top of the cauterization site. The patient must remain still and not move the affected limb for a period until it heals. This is particularly important when the dislocation is upward, which is rare.
Apply a single, good, nail-like cauterization over the shoulder, or multiple small dot-like cauterizations. This will strengthen the joint, dry out any moisture, and heal the patient.
Chapter 26.
On the cauterization of the stomach.
If the stomach becomes cold and moist, deviating from its normal state, with frequent vomiting, and treatment is ineffective, then the patient should lie on their back, stretching out their legs and arms. Then, three cauterizations should be applied. Cauterize below the manubrium of the sternum, approximately one finger's width, using a nail-like cautery instrument. Apply two additional cauterizations below and to either side of the first, forming a triangle shape with the three cauterizations. Leave some distance between them so that if they become ulcerated they do not join together. The depth of the cauterization should be approximately two thirds of the thickness of the skin, and the shape should be uniform across the three cauterizations.
In this manner, to this degree, with no more (than what has been described).
If you wish, cauterize with one large cauterization in the middle of the stomach, following this same method.
The cautery instrument used for this single large cauterization should be circular in shape, as illustrated here.
The stomach may be cauterized with dots for those who are afraid of this type of cautery: mark the stomach with dots in the quantity you desire using ink, then cauterize it with a dotted cauterizer, and treat it with the treatment described previously until it heals.
Chapter 27.
In the cautery of the cold liver.
If there is pain in the liver due to cold, moisture, or excessive flatulence, and the patient has been treated with remedies mentioned previously without success... The patient should lie on their back, and three cauterization marks should be made with ink in this specific shape and size on the liver below the ribs where a person's elbow ends.
Each mark should be spaced apart by the width of a finger, and the cauterization should follow the length of the body in a straight line. Do not press down hard with the cautery iron.
The depth of the burn should be half the thickness of the skin, no more. The patient should stand on their feet; if unable to do so, they can lie down with legs extended and arms raised. This is an image of the cauterizer.
You may use a knife-like cauterizer to perform these cauterizations if you are skilled and careful in your technique, being mindful not to burn too deeply as the skin here is thin and you could damage the belly and intestines.
Chapter 28.
On the softening and reduction of liver swellings through cautery.
If there is an abscess in the liver and you want to know whether this swelling is in the liver flesh or its membrane, then if it is in the liver flesh, the patient will feel a heavy and painful sensation without sharpness.
And if it is in the liver's membrane, there will be severe pain with sharpness. And you see that doctors are unable to treat it, then the patient should lie on their back and the swollen area should be marked with ink.
Then heat the iron in the fire, this is an iron which is shaped like a millstone, here is its picture. And cauterize it with a single cautery using that iron until all the skin is burned and you end by cauterizing the membrane so that all the pus is drained, then treat it with abscess medication until it heals.
This type of cauterization should only be performed by those who have extensive experience in the medical field and have treated such diseases numerous times through practical experience. Then one can attempt this procedure, though abstaining from it is preferable.
Chapter Twenty-Nine.
On cauterizing the navel.
The ancient ones mentioned cauterization using the root of the thorn bush for a cold navel using this method: take one long, dry root of the thorn bush that is as thick as your finger and longer than any others you may find. Then dip it in oil and light it on fire. Then cauterize with a single cautery between the collarbone and the neck, two small cauteries below the jugular veins slightly towards the area under the chin, and two large cauteries above the breasts between the third and fourth ribs.
Two cauterizations between the fifth and sixth ribs, slightly leaning backwards; another cauterization in the middle of the chest, and one above the stomach. Three more cauterizations from behind: one between the shoulders, and two on either side of the spine below the cauterization that is made between the palms.
The hand should not be inserted too deeply for cauterization; it should only reach the surface of the skin. Some ancient practitioners have mentioned that certain people would use an iron implement, like a needle or probe, which they would heat up and insert between the ribs until it reached the tumor.
Then the pus is drained as previously mentioned in liver tumors. And so, cauterization for this condition is a risky procedure; either the patient dies immediately or develops a fistula at the site that cannot be healed.
Chapter Thirty
Cauterization of the spleen.
If you treat an illness of the spleen with the aforementioned treatment methods, and it does not improve, then cauterization can be performed in three different ways, all of which are correct: one is to perform three or four cauterizations in a row along the length of the spleen.
They should be done in the same pattern as the cauterizations for liver conditions, with each one spaced apart by a finger's width or slightly more. The cauterization iron should have the same characteristics as mentioned earlier for liver cauterization, and again the hand should not be inserted too deeply. The patient should lie on their back during the procedure.
An alternative approach is at the elbow: you lift the skin opposite the spleen where the left elbow of the patient ends, and your lifting should be across the width of the body so that the cauterizations can be made along its length.
You then insert the needles very carefully until you pierce the skin on the other side, and then remove the cautery iron. This will result in four cauterizations. If you wish to use the other cautery iron with three needles instead, feel free to do so.
After that, you treat the cauterized area after leaving it to discharge pus for many days; this is more effective than all other treatments mentioned previously.
Chapter 31.
Regarding the cauterization of ascites.
Cauterization is particularly effective for ascites in the belly, especially if other treatments mentioned previously have not been successful. In this case, you should cauterize the patient four times around the navel and once on the stomach.
Another cauterization should be performed on the liver, one on the spleen and two behind their back between the scapulae, one opposite the chest and another opposite the stomach. The depth of the cauterizations should be close to the thickness of the skin. After this, you leave the cautery wounds open for a long time so they can discharge pus.
Do not leave the patient without any treatment after cauterization, as they should also receive other necessary treatments to promote healing. An illustration of the iron used for cauterizing the back resembles a nail, as described previously, while that used for the front is olive-shaped.
Chapter 32.
Regarding the cauterization of feet and legs.
If the feet and legs become swollen with yellow fluid in a patient suffering from ascites, you should cauterize on the back of the foot at the hollow between the little toe and the one next to it.
Hold your hand with the cautery iron and do not bend it, then lift your hand and never return it for there is a rush of yellow fluid, and this should be how the cauterization looks.
Then cauterize the legs twice on each leg with two burns, using the pointed end of the iron for this, with one burn below the knee and another lower down towards mid-calf; and to every thigh, two burns.
Leave the cauterization open without treatment for a long time, letting it discharge fluid, then treat with all that we have mentioned.
Chapter 33.
On cauterization for diarrhea.
If the diarrhea is due to cold and dampness, weakening the retentive and digestive powers in the stomach and intestines; despite treatment with all remedies it has not improved, but you see the patient can tolerate cauterization and is strong, then apply a large cautery burn on their abdomen. Following what has been said about cauterizing the abdomen, do this with a circular iron and four small burns around the navel using the small studded iron; one large burn over the coccyx or two if required.
If you see an excess of dampness and the patient can tolerate it, then cauterize with one burn over the pubic bone, one on each hip; perhaps add two small burns to the abdomen near the large one - this treatment is highly successful and will surely help God willing.
Chapter 34.
On the cauterization of hemorrhoids in the rectum.
If there are many chronic or single hemorrhoids in the rectum, and they consist of thick, cold, or corrupt humors, and treatment with what we mentioned in the classification is not effective, then let the patient undergo three cauterizations on the lowest part of the back, just below the waistline, triangularly.
A cauterization under the navel, about two fingers' width in size; and if you estimate that their stomach has cooled down and their food is not being digested properly, and you see their face becoming swollen, then cauterize them over the stomach with a large cauterization at what was previously mentioned, and another one on their liver. Another one on their spleen, with a cauterization iron shaped like a nail; leave the cauterized area open for some time before treating it to heal, God willing.
Chapter 35.
On the cauterization of warts.
After cutting the wart, heat up the cauterization iron that resembles a needle, then insert it while hot into the cut wart; press down with your hand until the iron reaches the mouth of the vein from which blood is flowing; do this once or twice.
If there are many warts, cauterize each one with a single cauterization as described above; then treat them with the appropriate ointment until they heal. If you use a larger cauterization on the cotton [poultice], it will be more beneficial.
Chapter 36.
On the suturing of fistulas that occur in the anal region and its vicinity.
If the patient does not respond to the incision and procedure described in its place, and fears it, perhaps cauterization might cure him/her. If there is a fistula that has persisted for some time with pus and foul fluids coming from it, you must first measure it with a fine probe.
Then, determine its depth by using the probe and then heat a cauterizing iron that resembles a pen. Insert it, while hot, into the same fistula in line with the fistula's depth and to the extent the probe entered. Repeat the cauterization until all of those foul bodies are burnt once or twice or thrice as required.
Take care not to burn a nerve if there is one, or a large vein, and if the fistula leads into the body of the bladder or that of the intestine.
So, be cautious of these areas; and only do this if the fistula is in a fleshy area, and you think it is not penetrable. Then treat that place until it heals completely. If the wound closes up, and the discharge stops for some time then it has healed perfectly.
And if the discharge does not stop, know that it is penetrable or there is a foul bone in its depth or something similar, which will be described later on.
Chapter 37.
On the cauterization of kidney stones.
If there is pain in the kidney due to cold or gas and intercourse decreases this, then you must cauterize it on both sides above the kidneys with a spiked iron described before; perhaps we cauterized it thrice over the same bone, so three cauterizations were performed in one line, which would be more beneficial.
Chapter Thirty-Eight.
The opening of the bladder.
If the bladder becomes weak and relaxed due to cold and moisture, such that the patient is unable to urinate, cauterize it with a cautery in the lower region of the navel over the bladder where pubic hair begins; further, cauterize [the area] to the right of the navel as well as to its left.
The cauterization on each side should be about the size of a thumb's breadth, and you may cauterize [the area] in the lower back, one or two times if needed; and the cautery instrument should be pointed as mentioned previously.
Chapter Thirty-Nine.
The opening of the womb.
If there is any material in the womb due to cold and moisture, preventing conception by corrupting its seed and hindering its flow, or if it causes pain upon arrival, then three cauteries should be applied around the navel as mentioned previously for bladder cauterization. A cautery on the coccyx below the back or two cauteries, and the instrument should be pointed.
Chapter Forty.
The opening for dislocation of the hip.
Mucus-like moisture may collect in the region of the hip, causing it to dislocate from its proper position; this is marked by one leg becoming longer than the other when measured against each other and you find an empty space at that spot; thus, the patient should be cauterized on the hip itself with a cautery in the shape of a semi-circle.
After learning to draw a circle with ink, position the right angle as it rotates to place the same right angle in the middle of the circle and create an image similar to that which you use for cauterizing the stomach; if this device is not available, perform three cauterizations using the large olive-shaped cautery iron.
Make the cauterization deep enough to match the thickness of all the skin, then treat it until it heals, God willing.
Chapter 41.
On cauterizing the sciatic nerve.
If there is pain in the right hip caused by cold and moisture, and you have treated it as mentioned earlier without any improvement, then it has become chronic; in this case, the patient should be eased of thick humours with colocynth or cactus seeds, etc.
Then cauterize, and the direction of the cautery can be of two types: either with caustic medications or with fire. The latter is performed in many ways; one way is to create three triangular cauterizations on the right hip as shown below.
The depth should be suitable, and the distance between each cauterization should be as thick as a finger. The iron used should be olive-shaped. You can also perform one cauterization in the middle of the head of the right hip; this would make four cauterizations total. If you wish, you can perform just one single cauterization using the circle mentioned earlier for dislocated hips.
The circle should surround the entire hip and burn through all layers of skin; this is how you cauterize for sciatica when there is constant pain in the hip itself but no extension to the thigh or leg.
If it extends to the thigh and leg, cauterize with two cauteries on the thigh at the spot where the patient indicates pain. Also, cauterize above the ankle four fingers away towards the outer side slightly. The cautery iron should be spatula-shaped; the depth of the cauterization should be equal to the thickness of the skin only.
If the patient indicates that the pain extends toward the toes, cauterize at the spot they indicate with a point cautery three or four times or more if needed. If the pain is indicated below the knee towards the leg, then cauterize there with one spatula-shaped cautery.
Be cautious in all your cauterizations to avoid reaching and burning any major nerve or artery, as this may cause severe harm or disability to the patient.
I have seen two cases where cauterization was performed above the ankle, and it was excessive, resulting in discolouration of the leg up to the toes and subsequent gangrene. This led to diarrhea and death afterward. So, if pain is felt on both sides, cauterize them following this very method.
Some renowned physicians have mentioned cauterizing the hip with a method like this: Create an iron cup-like tool, its diameter half a span, and at its mouth let it be as thick as a date stone or slightly less. Inside that cup, place another smaller one, and inside that, yet another.
Let the distance between each cup be as wide as the gap between your thumb and index finger, with both ends of the cups being open. Their height should be around one or two spans. A handle is made from iron, firmly attached to the cups; this is its diagram.
Then it is heated in the fire until it turns red and sparks fly, then it is placed on the patient's hip while they are leaning on their healthy side. It is cauterized with three round brands all at once; after which, they should be left alone for three days. After that period, one ought to apply some butter as a dressing, but the wound must remain open for several days.
Repeatedly treat it with ointment until healing occurs. The author of this book says that this type of cauterization is rarely used due to its ugliness and the horror of its appearance, as well as the few people who can bear it. However, for those who are able to endure it, it is an effective method of cauterization when applied to the appropriate location.
As for cauterization with caustic medications, you should make two small cups resembling the part of a door where the latch descends; these should be made from copper or iron.
Their edges should be raised by about two knots or so, and the distance between them should be equivalent to the thickness of a finger. They ought to be open at the bottom but closed at the top, with their handles joining each other in this fashion.
Then lower them onto the patient's hip while they lie on their healthy side, and squeeze your hand tightly. Pour some sharp water - which has been slightly warmed by fire - between the two circles, and hold it there for an hourglass' worth of time. The patient must endure its sting and burning sensation, as it will feel like fire.
Until the stinging sensation subsides, then lift your hand with the instrument and wipe all of the sharp water off the hip using fresh water. Leave it alone for three days, applying butter to it until the burn mark fades; leave it a few more days after that while pus flows from it - this is most beneficial.
Then treat it with ointments until it heals, but if the pain extends to the thigh or leg, make a cast for him that holds water, just as you did for the hip, alike. This is the description of sharp water, and I have proven it in an article on remedy reform.
Take a part of both soda ash and quicklime, grind them together, place them in a new pot with only one small hole at the bottom that fits a gimlet, placing another glazed pot under the first pot's base.
Pour fresh water over the soda ash and quicklime, covering them by a finger's width after firmly packing them with your hand. Let the pot sit until the caustic liquid drains into the glazed pot below, then gather all of that liquid and pour it over new batches of quicklime and soda ash.
By this point, it becomes very intensely caustic and is useful for many medical treatments as well as cauterizing all manner of body parts because it acts just like fire itself. Some medicines that can also be used to cauterize the hip are thorn apple, barberry honey, quicklime mixed with soap, and ointment.
Galen relates the story of an ancient man's treatment for hip pain, sciatica, and osteoporosis, which he greatly exaggerated as being a cure-all requiring only one application.
Even to the point of entering the bathhouse being carried in and leaving cured, it is said that one should take fresh turpentine resin, or failing that, newly dried sap, grind them finely with a little lard and apply this to the hip where the pain is, or on the leg or thigh.
The dressing is applied tightly and left on for about three hours, or until the patient feels that the burning sensation has subsided. Then they should enter a bath; once their body is sufficiently moistened, they should immerse themselves in a tub of water. The pain will go away and healing will occur, God willing. If no healing takes place, repeat the dressing after ten days.
It will heal, God willing. Know that no one should use cauterization with these medicines without first purging the body. Dioscorides has stated that goat dung, when used for cauterization on sciatica, is beneficial.
Cauterization is performed as follows: wool is soaked in old oil and placed on the deep area between the thumb of the hand and the wrist, closer to the latter. Then take a dry goat dung pellet.
Set it alight until it becomes a glowing ember, then place it on the wool and leave it there until it cools down. Repeat this process with another pellet, continuing to do so until the sensation reaches halfway up the arm towards the hip; the pain will subside, God willing. This type of cauterization is called 'bapri cautery'.
Chapter forty-two.
Regarding cauterization for back pain.
Back pain can arise from many causes, such as a fall, a blow, excessive purging, and so forth; it is caused by the pooling of cold, moist material in the back, for which cauterization is the sole treatment.
For pain caused by the pooling of cold material, after purging the patient with stinking sowbane or similar, cauterize their back where it hurts in three rows as wide as a table; mark the area first with ink. In each row, make five or more burns according to the tolerance and strength you perceive in the patient.
The cauterization is done with a pointy iron. If you wish, you can do three or four cauterizations with a medium-sized nail iron like this.
Chapter thirty-three.
On cauterization at the beginning of the hunch.
This illness often affects young children, and the first sign in a child is shortness of breath when they move around. You can also see that the last vertebra of their spine has risen higher than the rest.
If you see that, and want to stop it, cauterize them with an iron that is circular like this. The cauterization should be done on both sides of the vertebra, evenly. If you wish, you can do it around the vertebra with a pointy iron in two or three rows, with each dot close to the next one. Then treat the area until it heals as we mentioned.
Take care not to use cauterization for hunches that come from nerve tension.
Chapter forty-four.
On cauterization for gout and joint pain.
If joint pain comes from cold moisture that has gathered in any part of the body, and if it happens in the legs, doctors usually call this 'gout' specifically.
If cold gout is treated with the methods we mentioned in this section and the pain doesn't go away, then cauterization will remove it. You should cauterize around the leg joints many times after an emetic has been administered, using a medium-sized iron like an olive.
And if you need to cauterize a spot on the face, do so with an iron cautery tool. If pain rises up to the knees or other joints, and this often occurs, then brand each knee three or four times from either side with this very same oil-filled cautery iron.
If you require more cauterization, brand the area and do not go too deep with your iron; only as thick as the skin itself. If pain rises up to the hips or back, then use what we have mentioned before about cautery.
If the pain is only in the hands, cauterize around the forearms like you would draw two circles. If the pain remains in the fingers, brand each one and the palm of the hand. If the pain rises after a few days to the elbows or shoulders...
Brand them on either side, and the patient should continue good management and take medicines. If they improve their diet and remove phlegm, then with this branding, God willing, they will recover.
Chapter 45.
On the cauterization of hernias.
If a hernia appears in the groin, and some of the intestines and omentum descend into the scrotum while it is still at an early stage, then you should advise the patient to abstain from food that day and use laxatives to evacuate their bowels.
Then have them lie down in front of you on their back and tell them to bear down so that the omentum or intestines are extruded; then return it with your finger, after which mark below the hernia with ink onto the pubic bone a shape like half a circle whose edges point towards the upper body.
Then heat the iron, which has this form.
Until it becomes white, emitting sparks. Then the intestine or omentum is returned to its place inside the body. The assistant should put his hand over the spot to prevent the intestines from protruding, and I spread the patient's legs apart, placing a cushion underneath them while another assistant ties up their legs.
Another assistant is positioned on the patient's chest, holding their hands. Then you lower the iron to the same spot and press it down while standing upright with the iron held vertically in your hand until you reach the bone or return the iron once more if you do not reach the bone the first time.
Be careful to prevent the intestines from protruding while you are ironing, lest they be burned, which may cause death or great harm to the patient. Know that if you do not reach the bone with your ironing, your procedure will fail. The irons used for children should be suitable for their size, as should those for adults.
Then, after three days, treat the ironed spot with butter until the effect of the fire's crackling subsides. Afterwards, treat it with any other ointments until it is healed. The patient should remain lying on their back for forty days until the wound closes.
Their diet during treatment should include foods that are gentle on the stomach to prevent the intestines from protruding when straining for a bowel movement. If they wish to get up after the forty days, you should use a tight bandage and keep it on for another forty days. They should also reduce exertion, avoid becoming full from food or drink, and refrain from loud shouting.
If this treatment is administered in this manner, they will heal completely, God willing. I shall mention the treatment of ruptures by incision in its respective section, God willing. As for a rupture that occurs elsewhere in the abdomen and is just beginning, if you wish to prevent it from worsening, cauterize the rupture with a round iron suitable to its size. And if two-thirds of the skin is burned, treat it with what we have mentioned, and it will not increase, God willing. Some ancient authorities state that a hernia should be cauterized with a triangular cautery iron of this shape.
After having learned about hernia treatment with cautery, mark a line across the upper side of the hernia and another below it; then lower your hand in between them for one single cauterization, which is easier and better than the first, God willing.
Chapter 46.
Cauterization of fistulas.
If there is pain in some of the limbs following a fall or blow, and this pain persists for an extended period without responding to treatment with medication, then it should be cauterized with a point-cautery iron; each limb should be treated according to its size, smallness, weakness, and strength.
If the pain and fistula become entrenched, and it heals from the first cauterization, then repeat this process if needed; for such pains tend to spread from one limb to those close by, so you must follow them with cautery until the patient is healed.
Chapter 47.
Cauterization of leprosy.
As for the lepers, they may benefit greatly from cautery; especially those whose leprosy stems from putrefaction of phlegm and melancholic humor.
When cauterizing a leper, if the disease is in its early stages and you have treated it as mentioned previously without seeing deterioration or stagnation of the symptoms, and you fear that the corruption may spread throughout his constitution—then cauterize his head with five applications. The first is in the middle of the head, the usual one; the second below it towards the forehead at the end of the hairline; two on the temples; and another from behind at the occipital bone. Press your hand slightly with the cauterization iron until there is a slight effect on the bone.
And scales will come off, making it easier for the thick vapors to breathe; cauterize it also in the same way as the spleen, as mentioned before. However, if leprosy persists and becomes apparent, you should apply these cauterizations that we have mentioned on the head. Cauterize at the tip of the nose, two cauterizations on each cheek, two on the vertebrae of the neck, six on the vertebrae of the back, one large one on the coccyx near the base of the tail, another above it on the same plate, and two on each hip. Two on the knees, one on each knee; two on the shoulders; two on the elbows; two on the clavicles; and cauterize each joint of the fingers of his hands and feet once, as well as each heel of his feet and the forearms.
Be careful not to burn the nerves at the back of the heels; you may cauterize once on the pubic bone, another time on the stomach opening, and again on the liver. Know that the more you increase the number of cauterizations, the more beneficial and effective they will be.
Know that the patient will not feel pain from cauterization as much as a healthy person would, due to their body being numb. The size of the cauterization irons should be appropriate for the different parts and joints, as previously explained regarding the characteristics of the instruments.
Then treat the cauterization with fine caraway flour and honey along with other treatments until it heals, God willing.
Chapter forty-eight.
When cauterizing an anesthetized part, if a limb has been anesthetized and treated with medications, ointments, and dressings but fails to heal, burn the same anesthetized limb with multiple cauterizations according to the size or smallness of the limb. Let your cauterization be slightly more intense than the thickness of the skin.
You then treat it with ointment until it heals. Some cases of anesthesia that occur in the hand or foot, due to a spinal vertebra where the nerve exits and moves that limb, can be treated by cauterization, which eliminates the anesthesia.
No one should undertake such [procedures] without being well-versed in the anatomy of limbs and the exits of nerves that move the body.
Chapter forty-nine.
On the cauterization of leukoderma (white leprosy).
If leukoderma becomes chronic and no medical trick works on it, burn it with a cauterization that is slightly deep according to the thickness of the skin until the whiteness disappears and its color changes.
Then treat it with lentil flour, rose oil, asparagus leaves and dove blood or flycatcher blood, one part of each, mix all together, paint on a cloth and keep in place until it heals.
Chapter fifty.
On the cauterization of cancer.
If the cancer is in its early stage and you wish to stop it, cauterize it with a circular iron tool all around as if tracing a circle. Some sages have mentioned that one should use a powerful cautery technique at its center; however, I do not see this appropriate as I fear ulceration may occur, which has happened several times in my experience.
The correct approach is to cauterize it with a circle around its perimeter, as we mentioned earlier, or with multiple cautery applications.
Chapter 51.
On the cauterization of abscesses.
If an abscess occurs and its maturation is delayed, either due to the inherent strength of the infection or due to the patient's age if they are elderly with poor circulation, or even due to seasonal factors, and you wish to hasten its maturation, then cauterize the surrounding area with multiple small cautery applications.
Then leave it be, for it will accelerate its maturation. If you wish to slow down the process with cautery, heat up the iron tool, which is illustrated here: [image of an iron tool].
Place it in the middle of the abscess until it penetrates through the skin, and let the cautery be on the side closer to the ground so that the pus can easily drain out. Then treat it as necessary until it heals.
Chapter 52.
On the cauterization of gangrene.
Gangrene is a disease that spreads in the member, devouring it as fire devours dry wood. If you see gangrene in a place suitable for cauterization with fire, heat up many nail-like irons of various sizes according to what fits the location of the gangrene.
Then cut it from every side until all the corruption is removed and nothing remains of it at all, then leave it for three days and apply powdered sulfur with oil to the cauterized areas until all the scabbing and decay are gone.
Then treat it with salves that promote flesh growth, and if after three days you see the flesh growing healthily without corruption, leave it be; otherwise, repeat the cauterization of the remaining decayed areas. Gangrene can also be treated with caustic medication.
It acts as a substitute for fire, being more effective and faster-acting. I have already mentioned the treatment of gangrene with caustic medication in an earlier section; you can refer to that when needed.
Chapter 53.
On the cauterization of inverted and non-inverted nails.
This condition often occurs on the soles of the feet and is a rough, painful growth. Cauterization can be done in two ways: with fire or with caustic water.
Regarding cauterization with fire, you should use a hollow iron tool resembling an eagle's feather, made specifically to fit around the nail from all sides and with a thin edge. Heat this tool and place it on the nail, then rotate your hand holding the tool around the nail until it reaches its base.
Leave it for three days until pus forms, then apply a poultice of wild marjoram pounded with salt, leaving the poultice in place overnight. This will cause the nail to detach from its root. Treat the wound site with a flesh-growing salve until it heals; if the nails are not inverted.
These often occur on the surface of the body, especially on hands and legs. You should take a tube made of copper or iron or eagle's feathers, put it over the nail or wart, then pour into the tube some strong water in small amounts.
Hold your hand and rotate it slightly, while squeezing your hand a little to allow the edge of the tube to affect the base of the nail. The strong water will then find its way to penetrate down to the root of the nail, and the patient should bear with the stinging sensation caused by the strong water for an hour.
Then leave it, and the nail will come out along with its root. You can do this one by one until you have treated all those on your body. Then treat the affected areas afterward using ointments that help flesh grow.
Chapter 54.
On cauterizing shingles.
If a patient has shingles due to exposure to cold, or from quartan fever or other causes, you should cauterize it four or five times on the back, between each vertebra and once in their chest. And on the patient's stomach, cauterize once using an oily cautery instrument, as this will soothe shingles and accelerate healing from the cold disease.
Chapter 55.
On cauterizing boils occurring in the body.
There are certain ugly boils that erupt in the body due to cold, thick, spoiled matter. When they first appear, each boil should be cauterized gently on its head using a cinnamon stick whose end has been lit by fire or by long-stemmed asarabacca root, or by a lens-shaped cautery instrument.
Abscesses may be cauterized in their first eruption in this manner; the action of the agent that promotes them increases, and the patient recovers from them, although it is necessary that this should be done after the patient has been bled.
Chapter 66.
On the cauterization of an artery when it is severed.
Often, when an artery is severed by a wound from without or upon the incision of a tumour or cauterization of a member and such like, it is difficult to tie.
So, if this happens to anyone, quickly place your hand over the mouth of the artery with your index finger and squeeze it well until the blood is contained beneath your finger without any escaping; then take several small and large olive oil cauteries and blow upon them until they become very hot.
Then take one of these, whether small or large according to the wound and the place in which the artery is exposed; lower the cautery upon it after quickly removing your finger, holding the cautery until the blood ceases to flow.
If, upon lifting your finger from the mouth of the artery, it gushes forth and extinguishes the cautery, then take another one quickly from those prepared in the fire; continue doing so with one after the other until the bleeding ceases.
Take care not to burn any nerves that may be present, lest you inflict another injury upon the patient; know also that an artery from which blood flows cannot be tied off unless one of four methods is used: cauterization as we have said, or by amputation if it has not already been severed. When it is amputated, its ends contract and the blood flow ceases. It can be either tightly bound with threads or treated with medications that stop the bleeding and secured firmly with bandages.
And as for those who attempt to stop the bleeding with a bandage, by applying pressure with cloth, or using burning substances and the like, it will not cease at all, except very rarely. If this happens to someone and neither a doctor nor medication is present, they should quickly place their index finger on the wound itself, as we have described.
They should apply pressure firmly until the blood is restricted and flows away from the wound, towards the artery. The finger must not be removed by cold water, very cold indeed, always until the blood coagulates, thickens, and stops flowing. During this time, one should consider what it needs in terms of cauterization or medication.
Chapter Two.
On incisions, punctures, bloodletting, and other surgical procedures.
Khalf has said: 'We have mentioned in the first chapter every illness that can be treated with cauterization by fire and caustic medication, its causes and reasons, its instruments, and the shapes of cautery irons, arranging these in chapters from the head to the foot.'
And I will follow that same path in this chapter to make it easier for the student to find what they seek.
Before I begin, you should know, my sons, that this chapter contains even more uncertainty than the first one regarding cauterization.
For this reason, caution should be exercised to a greater degree because in this chapter there is often the loss of blood, which is the very foundation of life when an artery is opened or incised on a tumor, when puncturing and draining an abscess, treating wounds, removing arrows, incising for the extraction of stones, and similar procedures that are all accompanied by uncertainty and fear, and in most cases, death.
I advise you to avoid any situations that might cause suspicion, for in this profession of medicine and surgery you will encounter all kinds of people with various ailments; some may be weary of their illness and wish for death.
Due to the severity of his illness, and having endured a long period of suffering, some patients may have resigned themselves to death, indicated by certain signs in their condition. There are also those who will offer you money, hoping that your treatment can save them from an otherwise fatal disease; it is not appropriate for you to assist such patients at all.
Your caution and vigilance should be greater than your desire, and you should only proceed with treatment after absolute certainty of a favorable outcome. In all cases, ensure the patient is fully aware and warned about potential risks to their safety.
This will help you gain praise, glory, and reputation; may God guide you, my sons, and grant you wisdom and success, for it is in His hands alone.
I have organized this chapter with sections covering the entire range of cauterization, from the head to the foot, so that it is easier for you to find what you need. God willing.
Chapter One.
Treatment of the buildup of fluid in the heads of infants.
This illness often presents in infants at birth, due to excessive force being applied by the midwife during delivery; it may also occur from an unknown and hidden cause.
I have only seen this illness in infants, and in all cases, death was swift; for this reason, I advise against any treatment. In one case, the child's head filled with fluid and continued to grow larger each day. The boy could not bear to sit up by himself because of his large head and the increasing moisture until he perished.
And this moisture may gather either between the skin and bone or beneath the bone on the peritoneum. The procedure for this is that if the moisture is between the skin and bone, and the swelling is small, you should make an incision in the middle of the head across it, about two finger breadths long, so that the moisture can drain out. This is a picture of the scalpel.
If there is more moisture and the swelling is greater, make two intersecting incisions as shown in this picture:
If the moisture is beneath the bone, indicated by open scalp sutures on all sides and water seeping inwards when you squeeze it with your hand, then this should not be difficult for you to identify. In such a case, you must make three incisions in the middle of the head as shown in this picture.
After the incisions are made, all the moisture will be released. Then you must close the incisions with cloth and bandages, then cover them from above with ointment and oil until the fifth day. Next, remove the bandage and treat the wound with astringents and ointments, making sure not to bind it too tightly. Finally, feed the patient dry food that contains little moisture.
Until the body part is strengthened and healed, here is another method of incision: you must look at where the bone of the swelling appears and where the water gathers because it may be more towards the back or front of the head, or on either side.
You must aim your incision at the point of swelling and where you see moisture accumulating, making it as precise as possible. Be careful not to cut an artery, causing a hemorrhage that may kill the patient due to blood loss along with the release of moisture.
Chapter two.
Ligate the two arteries behind the ears known as al-hisasan.
If anyone experiences an acute attack in the eyes or chest, and this becomes chronic and does not improve with medication, then the best treatment for it is to ligate these two arteries.
When you wish to ligate them, you should first shave the patient's head with a razor and then rub the area with a coarse cloth to make the artery visible. Next, you should tighten the patient's neck with their own garment and look for where the pulse beats and its two locations, which are the lower areas behind both ears; it is rarely hidden except in some people.
Then you should mark them with ink and cut them with a sharp scalpel all the way to the bone, doing so across the width of the head. If you wish, you may also insert the scalpel from underneath the artery and sever it by cutting upwards; the length of the cut should be about two fingers' breadth when they are held together.
When the artery is severed, blood will gush out in a pulsating manner, leaping forward and jumping repeatedly. If the artery is not palpable to the touch, you should estimate its location three fingers' breadth from the ear, mark it with ink, and then make an incision all the way to the bone. You must...
You will release about six ounces of blood, possibly more or less, depending on the patient's strength and the fullness of their arteries; you may judge this for yourself. Then examine the wound: if there is any peritoneum left over the bone, cut it away.
To prevent a hot swelling, you should bind the wound with a thread of linen cloth and then treat it with ointments until it heals.
Chapter 3.
Open the two arteries in the temples.
For a person who has chronic migraines or acute attacks of severe heat and moisture in the temples, or muscles, or severe headaches that do not respond to conventional medical treatments, we have found relief by opening the arteries in the temples or cauterizing them as described above.
The process of opening the arteries involves shaving the hair from the temples and identifying the visible artery, which is usually noticeable due to its pulsation; however, in rare cases, it may be hidden, except in very few individuals.
Alternatively, in extremely cold weather, if the artery is difficult to locate, the patient should tighten their scarf around their neck and then you can rub the area with a cloth or apply a hot compress until the artery becomes clearly visible. Then, take the scalpel which looks like this: [image]. Using the scalpel, carefully make an incision in the skin until you reach the artery; then, insert a hook and gently pull it upwards to extract it from beneath the skin; remove any membranes attached to either side of the artery, taking care not to damage it if it is thin by twisting the hook around its end. Cut a segment from the artery, ensuring its ends are separated and contracted to prevent bleeding; if it is not properly severed, there will be no blood loss; in this procedure, up to three or six ounces of blood may be drawn.
If the artery is large, it should be tied in two places with a strong double thread made of either silk or lute strings to prevent putrefaction before the wound heals and causes bleeding.
Then you cut off the excess between the two ligaments, doing this in that hour or after some time has passed; and if you wish to cauterize it down to the bone with a bidentate cautery until its ends are severed, it will serve the same purpose as this procedure or even better, as we said.
Unless the patient has a fever or is in a choleric condition, because cauterization helps to eliminate moisture and thus be even more beneficial; after ligating the arteries, the cavity should be packed with old cotton and secured with tight dressings, then treated with drying medications that stimulate flesh growth as well as bandaging until it heals, God willing.
If bleeding from the artery occurs during your operation, act quickly to ligate it either by cauterization or filling the cavity with vitriol and applying pressure until the blood flow stops; if neither of these are available, place your finger on the wound until the bleeding ceases.
Irrigate the area with very cold water to calm the inflammation and apply pressure as needed; a less invasive option than ligating the artery is to cauterize the vein with this bidentate instrument after marking the two points with ink.
Insert it very hot until you reach the bone and sever the vein in two places so that its ends are separated; this ensures that it never reconnects, for cauterization prevents reunion. This is an illustration of the instrument.
It has two sharp blades resembling small scissors, although much less sharp than a knife because if they were as keen, they would cool too quickly and fail to sever the flesh promptly; some bluntness is therefore desirable to retain heat.
Cut the flesh quickly; this action is better than any other and quicker and easier, let it be after the distance between the two knives the thickness of a finger.
Chapter 4.
On the treatment of hot, constant tears running into the eyes.
If the tears are constant and their flow originates from the veins on top of the skull externally, and no treatment with medicine provides any relief, and you observe that the patient's face has turned red. And they feel a tingling sensation in their forehead, like the crawling of ants, and their eyes are withered and moist; their eyelashes have deteriorated and their eyelids have become rough from the intensity of tears. The ancient physicians were compelled to perform this treatment, which they call 'treatment by sword'; it involves instructing the patient to shave the hair on their forehead.
Then you make three parallel incisions on the forehead, lengthwise; each incision should be about two finger-lengths long and should run parallel to the bridge of the nose in the middle of the forehead, while the second runs slightly beyond the movement of the muscle in the temple and the third from the other side.
Take care not to cut the arteries on both sides, and keep your hand away from the connection of the jaws; let there be a distance between each incision equal to three closed fingers. Have with you prepared sponges or many dry rags to soak up the blood.
Then insert the double-edged sharp knife, as shown in this picture: Starting from the incision next to the temple, you should use it to strip all the skin between that and the middle incisions along with the membrane on top of the bone; then do the same from the middle incision to the third one. Finally, remove this knife. Another instrument also enters through the first incision, called a sharp scalpel on one side and smooth, non-sharp on the other. This is its image: .
Its sharp side is directed upwards towards the meat attached to the skin and its smooth side towards the bone, and you push it until it reaches the middle incision and cut all vessels that descend from the head to the eyes without reaching the outer skin.
Then you do the same in the middle incision to the other incision, and after a moderate amount of blood has flowed out, you squeeze the locations where the blood is clotted, then go over each incision with a cotton swab and place on it a dressing that has been soaked in wine or vinegar mixed with oil.
To avoid the occurrence of a hot swelling, and on the third day you remove the bandage and use copious washing with warm water, then treat it with basilicon ointment, rose oil, and whatever else you usually treat wounds with until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Five.
Treatment of tears and discharges into the eyes from inside the head.
If a person has had many severe, burning discharges which are constant and the eyes appear emaciated and small, with their vision weakened, and the eyelids are inflamed with loss of eyelashes. And there is severe, painful pain in the depths of the head along with continuous sneezing then know from these symptoms that those materials and discharges come from many deep vessels; the best treatment for this is as follows: have the patient shave their forehead then make one incision in the middle of the forehead.
And there is severe, painful pain in the depths of the head along with continuous sneezing then know from these symptoms that those materials and discharges come from many deep vessels; the best treatment for this is as follows: have the patient shave their forehead then make one incision in the middle of the forehead. Or raise it slightly horizontally and begin the incision from the left temple to the right, extending down to the bone. Keep your hand away from the moving muscles of the temples during chewing until all blood has been dried up with sponges.
Separate the edges of the incision with old cotton or a piece of linen, then apply tension from above with bandages. Moisten the bandages with vinegar and oil to prevent hot swelling. Once you release it and see that hot swelling has recurred, you must scrape the bone until new flesh begins to grow.
Then treat it with a drying agent that promotes flesh growth, such as a salve made from two parts wheat flour and four parts galena, which is useful for promoting flesh growth in wounds like these.
Chapter Six.
On the treatment of objects that fall into the ear.
Everything that falls into the ear is one of four types: either a metallic stone or something similar, like iron or glass; alternatively, it could be plant matter such as chickpeas or seeds; or finally, a liquid substance like water or vinegar.
And finally, it could be an animal. If a pebble or similar object falls into the ear and you know that it cannot grow there, expose the ear to sunlight. Then drip some violet oil or lamp oil onto the pebble, and try to remove it by moving your head or sneezing with musk. Close your nostrils when you sneeze after placing a cloth or woollen ring around the ear, and lift up the ear. This often aids in removal. If it still does not come out, try using gentle forceps like these to remove it.
If it comes out with forceps, otherwise try to remove it with a fine, flexible blind hook. If that does not work, make a copper tube and insert the end of the tube into the ear hole properly.
Plug the area around the tube with softened pitch mixed with oil so that there is no way for air to pass except through the tube, then blow hard and strongly into it; often it will come out this way. If it does not come out as described above, take a small amount of nabatean resin or trapping bird resin and place it on the end of the stylet.
After wrapping a tight piece of cotton around it, gently insert the stylet into the ear hole after drying the ear from moisture; if it does not come out with all that has been described above then proceed to incision before severe swelling or spasm occurs.
The incision treatment involves first bloodletting the patient at the cifal and extracting an amount of blood proportional to their strength, then sit the patient between your hands and turn their ear upwards, making a small incision in the root of the ear at its cartilaginous base where it is lowest.
Make the incision in a lunar shape until you reach the stone, then remove it with any instruments available to you; stitch the incision quickly and treat it until it heals.
If the object in the ear is one of the grains that grow and swell, try to remove it with what has been mentioned; if it does not come out then take a fine, thin scalpel like this one.
Attempt to cut that type of grain fallen in the ear with it, and only do so when you are certain that the grain has absorbed moisture from the ear until it becomes many small pieces; then remove them with a blind hook or fine forceps or by suction.
As we mentioned, it is easy to remove them, and as for the water that enters the ear, the patient should use a sneezing kundas first after filling their ear with some old cotton while lying on the side with the affected ear; if it comes out like this.
Or, take many pebbles the size of fingers, thin and smooth; heat them slightly over a fire and let the patient insert one into the hole in their ear. They should hop on their other leg from that side while striking another pebble against the stone in their ear.
Continue doing this with one pebble after another until all the water comes out; or, the water may be extracted by taking a piece of papyrus or feather and inserting one end into the ear while lighting the other end on fire so that most of it burns up before reinserting another feather.
Do this several times until all the water is removed, or draw it out with a tube as described for pebbles; and if there's an animal inside, examine its size - if small like a flea or similar, treat it as mentioned in the classification; but if not...
If its body is large enough to be felt, try extracting it with forceps and hooks; this will prove easier than removing anything else that becomes stuck in the ear; however, if worms have developed inside and your treatment using the methods described for inflammation under "Irrigation" has been ineffective...
You should inspect the ear in sunlight; if you can see any worms, remove them with forceps or fine hooks; but if not, take a tube of this shape...[image follows]
Narrow at the bottom and wide at the top, insert the thin end into the ear as much as the patient can tolerate, then suck strongly. Do this several times until all the worms come out. If they do not comply with coming out, seal around the tube with wax as I mentioned to you in the case of stone.
If they do not come out with what we mentioned, use the drops I described that have been tried by previous doctors to kill worms. You will find this in the article on drops. Pour the oils and medicines into the ear using this instrument; here is its image:.
As you can see, make it from silver or copper, narrow at the bottom with a small hole and wide at the top. If you wish, the nozzle inside the tube can be made of tightly fitted copper; if you prefer, take a pencil and wrap some cotton tightly around one end.
Then put the oil or juice or whatever medicine you want into the tube while it is in the ear, then insert the pencil with cotton on top and squeeze it gently with your hand until the oil flows into the ear canal.
It goes into the patient; whatever you pour into the ear should be slightly warmed over a fire, and take care that what is dropped in it is not too cold or too hot, for the ear cannot tolerate this.
Chapter 7.
On the treatment of temporary blockage in the ear.
Some children may be born with their ear canals unperforated.
In some people, a blockage may also occur in the ear canal due to an injury or tissue growth there. This obstruction might be deep within the ear canal and not visible.
If it is exposed just outside the hole and can be seen, then if what is exposed deep in the ear cannot be seen, in most cases healing will be difficult. If it can be seen, you should place the patient's ear in the sun. Look into it, if you see the blockage visible, then open it with a delicate scalpel like this one:
The end of it should be somewhat wider and slightly rounded, with the rest of the scalpel smooth on both sides to avoid harming the ear. If the blockage is due to flesh that has grown in the ear canal, grasp it gently with a fine hook and cut it off very carefully until all the flesh is removed.
If the blockage is deep inside the ear, take a fine and smooth probe, warm it slightly over a fire, then insert it into the ear canal. If you feel the blockage and the patient experiences a sensation of reduced hearing, gently rotate the probe.
Be careful not to injure the ear membrane, then place in the ear a wick of a size matching the hole, having first soaked it in Egyptian ointment; do this for several days until you are confident that the wound has healed or take a wick and soak it in water before sprinkling it with powdered zinc oxide.
Use this treatment, but if you see the ear becoming swollen with a hot sensation, it should be necessary to remove the wick and replace it with another that has been soaked in some alitrus made from rose oil until the hot swelling subsides; then treat it until healing occurs.
If there is any bleeding of blood, immerse a sponge or cloth in cold water and place it on the ear; use other treatments described in the section on cataplasms that stop such bleeding.
Chapter Eight.
In the treatment of warts that appear on the eyelids.
These warts that appear on the eyelids may be moist or dry. You should grasp them with forceps or a hook, and then cut them off at their roots with a scalpel, after which you should apply powdered zinc ore to the affected area.
If blood flows from the wound, cauterize it with a mild lentil-shaped iron. Cauterization after cutting is preferable. They often return if some of their roots remain; if you cauterize them with fire, you will burn those roots and they will not return.
Chapter Nine.
In the treatment of colds that appear in the eyelids.
It is common for something resembling a cold in intensity and hardness to appear on the eyelids.
This condition, known as a cold, is caused by the accumulation of thick moisture in both the upper and lower eyelids. If the lesion is raised on the surface of the eyelid and moves in all directions, it is relatively easy to treat; simply make an incision across it.
Gently peel it away from each side until it is released, then hook and cut it with a hook. If you cannot cut it without piercing the eyelid, this will not harm the patient; if the incision is large, simply stitch it together and treat it until it heals.
If the lesion is small, you need not worry; ointment will encourage it to heal and seal itself. If the lesion leans towards the interior surface of the eyelid, simply turn the eyelid inside out, hook the lesion without cutting it (as this is unnecessary), then cut it away from each side.
If you cut through the eyelid, it will not cause harm, then wash the eye after cutting the membrane with salty water and treat the area with something that will heal it until the patient is cured.
Chapter 10.
The treatment of the tumor that appears on the eyelid.
A tumor is a fatty tissue found in the layers of the upper eyelid, and it often affects boys, weighing down their eyes and making them susceptible to illnesses during the dawn hours. They are unable to look directly at sunlight. Because tears reach them quickly.
And for that reason, you see them constantly leaning on their faces and sleeping on them; their eyelids are under the eyebrows, moist with puffiness, and the tumor is visible to all. If you press the area between your fingers, you can feel the tumor between them. The procedure requires that the patient place their head in your lap.
You then take a piece of linen cloth and prepare from it a wick; you make the wick into a circle that covers the tumor on all sides, placing it over the area and pressing with your fingers from every side to gather the tumor in the center of the circle.
Then you make an incision in the middle of the moisture with a sharp scalpel, making it across and not larger than the typical venesection cut. However, the depth should be enough to cut through the entire layer of skin until you reach the tumor.
In most cases, the tumor will protrude from the incision in the form of a white fatty lump; you then extract it with a cloth wrapped around your fingers and pull it out while rotating your hand right and left until the patient is cured. Be cautious not to make the cut too deep so as to avoid damaging the scalpel and harming the eye.
If the swelling does not appear at the beginning of the incision, you should gently extend it a little until the swelling is exposed and then pull it out as we have mentioned before; after this, immerse some cloth in vinegar and water and place it on the area while applying pressure with a bandage. Some people prefer to crush salt instead.
Place it in the depth of the incision so that any remaining moisture dissolves, then treat it until it heals. If there is a hot swelling in the area, treat it with soothing dressings until it heals.
Chapter eleven.
On the types of squints.
If extra eyelashes grow on the eyelid in an unnatural direction, beneath the natural ones and persist, they can harm the eye and cause various ailments such as constant watering of the eyes, drooping eyelids, opacity and thickening, to the point that this may lead to blindness.
Squints are treated in four ways: either by cauterization with fire, or by using strong medicines as previously mentioned in the chapter on cauterization, or by cutting and stitching, or by using canes, which I will now describe.
You should place the patient's head in your lap and then turn the eyelid over with your left hand. If it turns, all is well; otherwise, insert a needle with thread from beneath the eyelid, pierce through with the needle above, close to the hair itself, and pull the thread upwards along with the eyelid.
Turn it over with a smooth stick, then make an incision inside the eyelid, away from the excess hair, using a sharp knife starting at the larger margin and moving towards the smaller one. Then remove the thread and place beneath the eyelid a small dressing made of cotton or cloth; finally, mark the eyelid with ink.
It should be like the shape of an ace leaf, but it is necessary for the size to match your desired eyelid lift, because this may vary among people; some might need a considerable amount cut from their eyelids due to the level of relaxation.
Some others may need a smaller cut, depending on the level of eyelid relaxation; then you should make an incision with a scalpel along the two lines that you have marked, starting from the larger canthus to the smaller one, and ensure the incision is as thick as a makeup brush near the natural hair.
Next, insert the hook into one corner of the skin and then peel off all the layers; afterwards, bring together both lips by sewing them with a thin wool thread and needle, wipe away any remaining blood and stick down any loose threads on the eyebrows using some adhesive.
If you wish to do so, or otherwise it doesn't matter; the stitches and threads remain for around three or four days before you treat them, although if preferred you can leave the wound without any stitching and just treat it with a drying agent that causes constriction in the area, as this will lift the eyelid. However, stitching is preferable.
An alternative method of blepharoplasty that was mentioned by previous generations, although it is somewhat arduous for the patient; this is nevertheless an excellent approach with no associated risks. Another approach to consider is marking out a shape on the eyelid similar to that of an ace leaf, as previously described. Next you should lift the eyelid using three hooks, which may be either separate or grouped together in this fashion:
Then you should cut away any excess eyelid with small scissors, following this pattern but doing so cautiously:
If you cannot contain the tendons and they are not stable for you, take a needle with thread and insert it into the middle of the shape. Then, insert another thread near the larger angle and a third one near the smaller angle. Gather the threads between your fingers moderately, then lift them gently with your hand.
Lift the marked skin as described, then bring together the edges of the wound with sutures and treat it until it heals. If a hot swelling appears upon cutting or incising, calm that swelling with cirrus or similar soothing ointments.
The lower eyelid may also experience inversion of its lashes, in which case you should employ what we've mentioned regarding cutting, suturing, and cauterizing with fire or sharp medicine. Cauterization is more effective and less burdensome for the patient than cutting and stitching.
Cauterization with reeds is performed as follows: turn the eyelid outward and make an inner incision as described previously. Then, prepare two thin reeds or wooden sticks whose length matches that of the eyelid and whose width is slightly less than a lancet.
Notches have been made at both ends of the reeds, on either side, where the threads will catch. Then, you gently bring them together over what remains of the eyelid and pull the reeds taut from both sides for several days. The stretched skin eventually dies off, turns black, and decays.
If it takes too long for the skin to fall off on its own, then trim it with scissors. Treat the wound until it heals, and once healed, the eyelid will have risen without the lashes irritating the eye. This is an illustration of the two reeds, which you should craft in this shape and those exact dimensions regarding length and width.
Chapter twelve.
On the removal of ingrown hairs from the eye using a needle.
If it is a single hair or two, you should take a thin needle and thread a fine, smooth silk through it; then gather the ends together and tie them in a very delicate knot. The length of the silk should be about a span.
Then, in the loop, thread another silk that is shorter and finer than the first one; tie its ends if you wish. The patient should place their head on your lap, close to the sunlight so they can be seen clearly, as this is very delicate work. Then insert the needle with the loop over the root of the ingrown hair.
You must pass the needle through the eyelid quickly until you see it emerge on top of the natural hairs; then pull the silk upwards, over the loop and insert that hair or those hairs - there should be no more than three - into the loop.
Then you must pull your hand back with it until the hair comes out of the eyelid along with the loop and the natural hairs. If you pull on the loop but do not see the hair coming out, then you should tug downwards on the loop using the silk that was first threaded through the needle so that the loop emerges from the upper hole.
Then you must put the hair back into the loop and pull them both until they are visible through the upper hole; at that point, you should slip the loop off of the needle and remove it along with the silk, then massage the eyelid and leave it tense for two or three days so that the hair stays in place while flesh grows over it.
If the hair is too short, you can either add a longer natural hair to it so that they rise together or leave it for a time until its length allows you to extract it.
Chapter Thirteen.
In treating the ptosis that occurs in the upper eyelid of the eye.
The cause of this ptosis is named lagophthalmos and it can be either congenital or acquired. The latter is caused by the healing of a wound, laceration, cauterization, or something similar.
The treatment involves incising that healing, separating its lips and placing between them a wick of linen, which is then tied until it heals. It should be noted that substances which dry or contract [the wound] ought not to be used in treating this condition.
If you do that, the ptosis will return more severely than before. Instead, use substances which relax [the wound], such as fenugreek and a poultice made with water in which mallow and flax seeds have been boiled. You may also use an ointment of *dyakilion* dissolved with some oil, with which you anoint the wick and treat the condition.
The crux of the treatment is to use every trick in order to prevent it from healing in its original form. The method we have described is but one part of treating ptosis, not a way to restore the tissue to its prior condition entirely.
Chapter Fourteen.
In treating the ptosis that occurs in the lower eyelid.
This ptosis, which is inferior in nature, is truly called *ptosis*. It can be congenital or acquired. The latter arises from a wound, laceration, cauterization, or something similar.
You should take a needle with double-threaded string and suture it into the flesh, passing through from left to right of the orbit until the thread is on both sides of the flesh. Then you stretch the flesh upwards using the needle, and sever it with a broad scalpel.
If the eyelid returns to its proper shape, but if not, take a stick and place it on the incision site; turn the lid with it and make two incisions on the inside of the lid, with both ends meeting at the corners that were cut to form an angle. When they meet, their shape becomes similar to this: [image of an angle].
Which is the Greek letter lambda; then you remove that flesh to the extent that its sharp edge ends up below what follows the eyelid, and then you gather together the separated parts with two sutures by stitching it with a wool thread before treating it as we mentioned previously using relaxing medications and twisting until it heals.
If the squint occurred due to an incision, a suture or cauterization, then it is necessary to make a simple incision without removing any hair from above the eyelashes as previously mentioned; you should also separate the lips by twisting them according to what was mentioned earlier.
In summary, treating the squint, whether it is from above or below, involves following a procedure according to what seems appropriate given its specific nature; note that this condition may present with many different appearances and thus the surgeon must adapt his approach as necessary.
So that the shape is returned to its natural form or something close, and in most cases the condition itself will guide you towards what procedure and tools are required.
Chapter Fifteen.
On the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or cornea.
This adhesion may occur in many people when the upper eyelid adheres to the white part of the eye, hindering its easy movement and preventing it from performing its natural functions; therefore, one should insert the end of a stick underneath the lid.
Lift it upward or extend it with a hook, then cut the adhesion gently with a small scalpel that is not too sharp like the regular scalpels but rather slightly dull so as not to disturb the patient during the procedure and cause the scalpel to slip and damage the eye with its sharpness. Your cutting should be done as if you were peeling off this adhesion.
And wait until the eyelid returns to its natural position, and all adhesions heal. Then rinse your eyes with salty water or drip into them a solution of zinc sulfate dissolved in water. Afterward separate the eyelid from the eye with a piece of cotton.
Place above the eye a piece of wool soaked in egg white, and after three days use soothing douches until it heals.
Chapter 16.
On the excision of pterygium and meat of the eyelids.
Pterygium is of two types: either it is a nervous one, which resembles a hard and thin membrane, or it is non-nervous, resembling a solid white moisture that if touched by iron or grabbed with the hook breaks up.
And if a hook cannot hold it, both types nonetheless start from the upper eyelid until they gradually cover the cornea and block light as well as eye movement. The procedure for cutting them is that the patient should lay their head on your lap.
Then the patient should open their eyes and you must lift the eyelid with your hand, then grab the pterygium with a slightly bent hook and extend it upwards. Next take a needle, insert into its eye an individual horse or cow hair along with a strong thread, bend one end of the needle somewhat, and pierce it through the middle of the pterygium.
You implement it with a needle and tie the sty to the thread, then stretch it upwards and peel away the side of the sty closest to the pupil as if you were shaving it with a hair all the way through its length. Then cut off what's left at the root of the conjunctiva with a delicate scalpel or small scissors and leave the natural meat of the conjunctiva.
So as not to allow the cutting of it [the sty] to cause permanent weeping, and you may stretch out the sty with a hook alone or with thread as we have said then peel away its side with a smooth-edged scalpel which is depicted thus:.
Be cautious not to touch the corneal membrane with the scalpel and thus create a rupture, opening up the pupil; after cutting [the sty], throw into the eye some powdered salt or rusted copper filings, leaving it there until the next day before treating appropriately so that healing may begin.
Should the sty be insensitive, and you are unable to insert a needle or fasten it with a hook [as in previous instructions], this type of sty is often treated by medicine as described in the classification chapter, and should you wish to cut it then open the patient's eye.
Take up a delicate scalpel, smooth-edged with a thin blade as illustrated here:. With a scalpel of this kind, gently peel away the sty from above and should you find it to become loose or crumble under pressure then drip into the eye immediately some rusted copper filings, red oxide, or powdered salt; hold the eye shut until the following day.
Then repeat this procedure until it has all gone away, except if you encounter a warm swelling in the eye then leave the sty and treat the warm swelling until healed; after which return to treating the sty by peeling until healing begins; as for an eyelid fold...
If the stye causes severe discomfort to the eye, suspend it with a hook and cut off some of it, but do not go too deep in the cutting process so as to avoid excessive tearing. Then apply red alum or zinc oxide drops into the eyes until it heals.
Chapter Seventeen.
On the excision of varices and superfluous flesh that grows in the eye.
In the eyes of some people, red flesh may grow and overlay or almost cover the cornea, or even spill over onto the eyelids; possibly causing the eyelids to turn outwards, resembling wild roses.
The procedure involves having the patient place their head in your lap, then opening their eyes while you extract all of that red flesh using appropriate hooks.
Alternatively, you can grasp it with forceps or tweezers and then cut the flesh bit by bit until all of it is removed; be careful not to injure the eye while working on it. Your cutting instrument could either be the lancet we described for excising calluses or a pair of small scissors. Similar to those used for extracting splinters, as illustrated in the chapter that follows this one.
Once you have completed the excision and all varices are gone, fill the eye with ground salt or apply red stibnite along with other caustic medications; place cotton wool soaked in egg white on top of the eye to prevent hot swelling.
If any varices remain and blood becomes an issue, causing you to fear hot swelling, then leave the eye for now and treat it with medications that will ease the inflammation; return to perform the procedure once more until it heals. Do the same when dealing with superfluous flesh that may appear in this type of situation.
However, you should avoid treating every weak eye, whether through a natural tendency or due to an ailment, by operating with iron instruments. Do not embark on any such procedures until you see that the organ can withstand it.
Chapter 18.
The extraction of arrows from the eye.
Arrows are red veins that form on the eye, obstructing vision and weakening it over time. First, you should examine whether the eye with arrows is strong and free of other ailments.
Then proceed with the extraction, which is as follows: Have the patient rest their head on your lap. Attach one or two hooks to those veins, depending on your skill, and ensure they are supple. The hooks should look like this [image]: .
Alternatively, you may use two double-pronged hooks attached to a single shaft, as pictured here [image]: .
Then, with a fine pair of scissors, gently remove those veins and wipe away the blood periodically until you see that the eye is free of them and the bleeding has stopped. Take care not to harm the eye with the scissors' tips, and ensure your work is done in the morning or evening when the sun is low in the sky.
Pay close attention to your work, ensuring you only cut those specific veins and nothing more. Once finished, drop green or red eye medicine into the eye to eliminate any remaining arrows with its sharp action. If it is not possible to complete the entire procedure at once, then apply a dressing to soothe the eye's pain.
Leave the dressing in place for a few days until the pain subsides and any inflammation has gone down, then repeat the procedure precisely as described above until the eye is healed. [image of scissors]
Leave the patient [with their head in the student's lap, and another should dry the tears and carefully examine the front and back of the eye while you] originally operate by opening the eye with fixed or triangular forceps held by a pupil.
Accurate, and the patient's head should be in the student's lap; another should dry the tears and examine both the front and back of the eye, while you may choose to start the extraction from above or below the eye; it is preferable to use two forceps on the upper side, one at the end of the eyebrow and the other at its beginning.
Hold the forceps between your middle and index fingers, then attach hooks underneath them; hold these with your ring finger and little finger, and lift your hand gently until you see all the flaps have been raised; cut from the smaller corner either with scissors or a sharp knife as preferred.
Insert the needle under the flaps, making sure all of them are lifted over the blade; do not cut until you have dried it well, for tears and blood may become slippery otherwise.
Then cut with the scissors any excess over and under the eyebrow, leaving no residue stuck to the cornea; if you can manage to peel it off the cornea with your finger, that is best, although in some people this may not be possible.
If you have cut it, then the pain will last for days; alleviate this with soothing agents to avoid a hot swelling, and repeat the procedure as needed.
Chapter Nineteen.
On returning the cartilage to the nose.
Physicians call the cartilage a nāsūra; if you have treated it by cauterization or with sharp medicine as described earlier and it has not healed, there is no other option but to cut into the swelling when it ripens and extract all moisture or pus within.
Until the bone is exposed; when the bone is exposed and you see corruption or blackness in it, scrape it with this tool:
It is called the 'rough-headed' and it's made of Indian iron; its head is round like a button, either grooved like a file or smooth like a rasp. Place it on the affected area of bone then rotate it between your fingers as you squeeze your hand slightly until you feel that the corruption has been scraped away.
Do this several times then treat the area with astringent and drying medications; if the wound closes, flesh grows back in it, discharge ceases and it remains like that for forty days without anything new happening to it.
Then you may be sure that it has healed; otherwise, there is no other course of action but to reconnect the fistula with the nostril in this manner: uncover the bone again either by using iron or an acrid medication. Once the bone is exposed take a bifurcated tool like this:
Its iron tip is triangular and its shaft tapers to a point, as you can see; place it on the bone close to the corner of the eye and keep your hand slightly away from the patient's eye then rotate the tool with your hand until it penetrates the bone and the patient feels it.
By feeling air escaping from it when he covers his hand over his nose; at that point treat the area with astringent and drying medications as I told you earlier. If flesh grows back in it and the place hardens then whatever used to discharge outward will now return into the nose which should be less bothersome for the patient, God willing.
Chapter Twenty.
Inversion of the eyelid.
If the eye itself has come out without any damage or loss of sight, you should ease the patient and then cauterize it at the root. Then place a syringe in the back of the neck, but without making an incision, and suck gently.
Then you should place on the eye a plaster made of acacia, aloe vera, frankincense and solomon's seal. Then bandage the eye securely with numerous swabs; these are prepared by taking very soft lint and folding each piece into four layers to make thick pads.
Then place the swabs one on top of the other, as many as necessary for the eye. Then bandage them securely with a firm cloth, pulling it tight. Reapply the syringe and suck without making an incision. Finally, remove the syringe and leave the eye bandaged like this for a day and a night.
If the bandage loosens during this time, it should be tightened again. Then remove the bandage after a day and a night as previously stated. If you see that the eye has not returned to its normal position, reapply the dressings, swabs, tightening and syringe until it does.
Chapter 21.
On the excision of the iris.
If a tear occurs in the iris layer, and it comes out and protrudes outside the eyelids, like an iris, disfiguring the person's appearance, you may wish to excise it. Proceed as follows.
This involves inserting a needle at the base of the iris, from underneath upwards; then insert another needle with doubled thread through it and pierce this. Leave the first needle in place.
First, cut the location where the doubled thread bends and tie some grapes to it around the needle and pull it tight. Then remove the needle and place wool soaked in egg white on the eye; leave it until the threads fall out along with the grapes, then treat the eye with a strengthening medicine.
until the wound heals; you may pull on the grapes from each side with a circle of cloth until the eye protrudes sufficiently, then apply a thin lancet that reaches deep into the eye so as to drain out the vitreous humour and the eye will drop and wither where it lies; then pull on it until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Two.
Treating cataracts.
This condition known as cataract is a sort of veil that gathers over the eye, resembling descending water but without any fluid; to address this one must seat the patient upright on a chair and take hold of their head with both hands on either side.
And shake their head until you see the veil move downward in your eye, then hold still and it will dissipate; light will be restored and the patient will perceive objects as they did before; if this veil does not descend, we know that this is due to fluid, for if the above method fails to bring down the veil.
Then seat the patient between your hands and take a thin lancet, making an incision above the corneal membrane slightly where the conjunctiva meets with the cornea at the limbus, so that the material is discharged.
When this material is discharged, one must then drip into the eye hot water with honey mixed in or water that has been boiled along with fenugreek and honey; afterwards treat it with other remedies until healed.
Chapter twenty-three.
As we have mentioned the types of water in the division and which are suitable for use in the goblet with an explanation, you can take it from there as being correct; at that point, you should have the patient sit facing you in a cross-legged position opposite the light near the sun.
You tie up the patient's healthy eye and pull it tight, then lift the eyelid of their eye with your left hand if it is the left eye that has water in it or with your right hand if it is the right eye.
Then you place the tip of the goblet near the cornea with as much pressure as a pencil, in the white part of the eye from towards the smaller corner; then push the goblet forcefully while turning it with your hand until it penetrates the white part of the eye and you feel that the goblet has reached an empty space.
The depth to which the goblet should penetrate into the eye should be as deep as from a child to the edge of the iris, which is the outer part of the eye; you will see the copper in the same way that you would look at an eye through a lens due to the clarity of the cornea; then move the goblet upwards towards the location where the water is.
Then push it downwards repeatedly; if water comes out immediately, the patient will be able to see what their vision was opened up to immediately while the goblet is still in their eye and then wait a moment. If the water rises again, lower it once more without removing the goblet.
If it becomes stable and does not rise, remove the goblet gently while turning your hand a little at a time; then dissolve some pure Andrian salt in the water and wash out the eye from within, then apply an ointment or piece of damp cotton wool to the outside of the eye.
Rose oil and egg white are mixed together and the eye is bound with it; however, we and those of our time place upon it crushed cumin with egg white. If this does not allow the sty to open up in the eye due to its hardness, then know that there are people whose eyes may be very hard. It is necessary for you to take the scalpel called 'Al-Barid', which has this image:
Then you perforate with it only the conjunctiva and do not delve into the perforation; rather, gently tap a sty-lance at an appropriate spot and then insert the lance as we mentioned. When your work is complete, prepare for the patient a firm bed in which they can sleep on their back inside a dark room.
He should abstain from all movement and coughing, and his diet must consist of foods that soften his constitution. He is not to move his head right or left at all, and the bandage remains in place until the third day, when it is removed inside this dark room, after which you test his vision.
You show him objects and then replace the bandage until the seventh day, without doing so during or after the treatment, for lancing it may cause water to rise rapidly due to severe straining of vision.
If a hot swelling occurs, then you should remove the bandage before the seventh day and treat it to ease this swelling, until such time as it subsides; at which point you can release his vision and place over his face a veil which he can get accustomed to seeing through from beneath. He remains in that dark room for several days.
He should then leave the house in stages, adapting to normal life once more. Be aware that a novice sty-lancer cannot do without observation on multiple occasions before proceeding with such work; I have been informed by certain people of Iraq that they use a perforated lance which can suck up water.
I have not seen anyone in our country make such a thing, nor have I read about it in any of the books of the ancients. It is possible that this may be something new and innovative. Here are depicted various types of syringes for those who are unfamiliar with them.
It is made especially of copper, and its tip is extremely thin and triangular in shape with a sharp edge.
Chapter Twenty-Four.
On treating flesh growths in the nose.
Various types of excess flesh may grow in the nose, resembling something like a many-legged scorpion, or it may be hard and cancerous with a dark color, or soft and not discolored.
If the flesh growth is soft, not malignant, and not cancerous, then the patient should sit facing the sun with their nostril open. You should insert a hook into this flesh, draw it out, and cut off whatever you can reach with a sharp, delicate scalpel on one side.
Keep doing this until you are certain all the flesh has gone; if there is any remaining that cannot be cut, then gently scrape it away with a delicate instrument so as to leave nothing behind. If blood loss becomes an issue or inflammation and heat occur.
Then treat it accordingly or, if the growth is malignant, immediately cauterize until blood flow ceases and all flesh has gone; afterward, pour vinegar water into the nostril after cutting, or an alcoholic drink, so that moisture passes through the nose to the throat.
You may assume the patient has healed if moisture passes as it should; but, if not, know that there is still flesh growth higher up at the fragile bones which your instrument could not reach to cut. At this point you must take a somewhat thick thread of linen.
You tie many knots in it and leave between each knot a space of about one finger or less. Then the patient carefully pushes one end of the thread into his nostril with an applicator, or whatever else is available, after having knotted it like a button. He then pulls on the thread until he feels the other end reach his nasal cavity.
It comes out at his throat, and boys in school often do the same thing; this is easy for anyone who wants to try it. Then you take both ends of the thread: one that came out at the mouth, the other which stayed inside the nose.
Next, you use the thread's knots to separate the flesh, doing so until you are sure that the tissues have been cut by the string's knots; then you remove the thread and clean any blood from inside the nose using a piece of cotton which has been soaked in Egyptian balm ointment. Do this for three days or more.
This process continues until the ointment has devoured all that is left of the flesh; lastly, you insert a lead tube inside the nose for several days until it heals completely. If further treatment to dry out the wound is required, then this technique can be employed.
This is an image caption of the instrument used to pour oil-based medicines into the nose: "A syringe for administering oils and drugs by dripping them into the nasal cavity.
It is made of silver or copper, resembling a small open-topped lamp with an open spout as well.
If you wish, the tube may be constructed with an enclosed end like a pipe, and the spout of the syringe can be flat instead.
There is also a handle at the other end, as you can see, which you grip when heating up oil or whatever fluid or liquid substance you want to use inside it.
Chapter twenty-five.
In warts that grow at the tip of the nose.
A wart often grows at the tip of the nose, it becomes bigger over time until its appearance is ugly.
Therefore, one should cut it off at its first appearance and remove all of it; then apply either cauterization or the burning medication that acts as a substitute for cauterization to the affected area. If you miss cutting it before it becomes big, examine whether it is hard, stony, dark in color and has little sensation.
Do not expose it to iron, as it is a cancerous growth and I have often seen those who cut this tumor suffer great harm from it; even if the tumor feels soft, is not dark in color and you think that cutting could be an option for treating all of it. Make the patient vomit, cut it without hesitation or waiting; treat the area with something that dries and tightens until it is healed.
Chapter twenty-six.
On stitching the nose, lip and ear. If the connection becomes separated due to injury or something similar, know that when there is a separation of the connection in one of these cartilages, rarely does treatment work well on it except for some people.
Whenever something like that happens to one of them, examine whether the wound is fresh with its blood; you should bring together the lips of the wound by stitching and then treat it until it heals. If the separated connection has already divided both sides and each side became a proper incision on its own, you must excise from every incision as thick as its outer skin until they bleed.
Then the lips are united by sewing, tightened and sprinkled with powdered frankincense and myrrh. Above this sprinkle a plaster of mastic ointment or other healing ointments; leave it bound for two to three days before unbinding.
The dressing is changed, and left until the stitches fall out by themselves; then it is treated with ointment until healed. The procedure for stitching is to reunite separated parts: either with needles as described in sewing the abdomen, or with thread as explained there.
Chapter 27.
On the removal of swellings that appear in the lips.
Many people get small, hard swellings inside their lips that resemble goose bumps; some are smaller and larger than others. The lip should be turned over and cut open at each swelling then hooked with the needle.
Cut it from all sides, then pack the wound with powdered alum to stem the bleeding; rinse out your mouth with vinegar and salt water. Treat the wounds with an astringent until they are healed.
Chapter 28.
On the excision of excess flesh from the gums.
Often, excess flesh grows on the gums that the ancients call apolys. You should hook it with a needle or grasp it with forceps and cut it off at its base; leave the pus or blood to drain before applying powdered alum to the site.
Or one of the astringent, drying plasters; if the flesh returns after treatment then it often does so. Cut it off again and cauterize it for it will not return after cautery.
Chapter twenty-nine.
Extracting teeth with an iron instrument.
Hard and unsightly tartar may form on the inner and outer surfaces of teeth and between the gums, sometimes becoming black or yellow or green; this can lead to gum disease and discolouration of the teeth.
You should have the patient sit in front of you with their head resting in your lap, and then extract the tartar, along with any sand-like particles, from the tooth or molar where they are visible; likewise for black, yellow or green discolouration or anything else until it is all removed.
If it is removed entirely in the first instance, so much the better; otherwise you should repeat this process day after day until your objective has been achieved, and remember that a molar requires different tools of varying shapes and sizes depending on what you are trying to achieve.
Because the instrument used to clean a molar from within is different from that used for external cleaning, and another still for those between molars; these are various designs of instruments you should have ready.
Chapter thirty.
Extracting teeth.
You should try to treat the molar for pain by any means necessary, and be hesitant about extracting it because nothing can replace such a precious entity if you do; even so, there may come a time when extraction is unavoidable.
If the patient is insistent upon extraction, you should ensure that you are absolutely certain which molar is causing them pain. Often the patient is deceived by the pain and thinks it's in the healthy tooth, so he extracts it, but the pain doesn't go away until he removes the diseased one. We have seen this repeatedly with barbers.
So if you are sure that the painful tooth is correct, then you should incise around the tooth with a sharp scalpel until you loosen the gums on all sides; then move it with your fingers or with gentle forceps at first little by little until you dislodge it.
Then take a firm hold of it with the large forceps, with the patient's head between your knees so he cannot move; then pull the tooth straight out lest you break it. If it does not come free, take one of those tools and insert them under the tooth from each side gently, rocking it as before.
If the tooth has a hole or a cavity, you should fill that hole with a cloth and pack it well with the end of a slender spatula so that it does not crumble when you grasp it with the forceps; and you must be thorough in incising all around the gums.
Take care not to break it, for if any part remains it will cause the patient more harm than his original pain; and avoid doing what ignorant barbers do with their bridges, acting without using the methods we have described.
They often cause great harm to people, the least of which is that a tooth breaks leaving its roots whole or in part. Or it may be that some of the jawbone is extracted along with it, as we have seen many times; after extraction he should rinse his mouth with wine or vinegar and salt. If there is bleeding from the site, which often occurs, then pound some zinc and fill the socket.
Otherwise, extract it if the vitriol is of no use to you. Figure of fine forceps which are used first to move the tooth: they have long branches and short handles, rather thick so that they do not bend when seizing the tooth with them. This is a figure of large forceps:
They are, as you can see, thick handled so that when you grasp them they do not give way or bend; the branches should be short and made of Indian iron or steel, well tempered at their extremities, and at their ends have teeth which fit into each other to enable a firm, close grip.
The branches may also be made with a file-like end so that they are likewise strong and secure when closing.
Chapter thirty one.
On the extraction of tooth roots and removal of broken jaw bones.
If, when extracting a tooth, the root remains and is broken off then you should place over the area some cotton with butter for a day or two until it softens, after which introduce a pelican or forceps. which at their ends have branches resembling the beak of the bird called 'pelican', this is an image of these forceps:
These may be manufactured with a file-like end on the inside or like pincers, and if they do not serve to extract it then you should cut into the root and expose all of the flesh using a scalpel before inserting an instrument resembling a small lever which is depicted thus:
with a short branch, rather thick and not well-tempered so that it does not break. If the root is extracted by this then good, if not then take these other instruments which are depicted here; the first has a triangular end with some thickness:
Another fine triangular figure.
We may also employ this two-pronged instrument, here is its illustration:
And with other instruments and tools, which we have already mentioned in the inventory of dental equipment, we may also use this large hook-like instrument, here is its illustration:
The tip of which is slightly bent and a little thicker to prevent breakage, and it should be unpolished. Know that dental instruments are many in number, as are all other surgical tools, which cannot possibly be enumerated; an experienced artisan who has mastered his craft may create new instruments for himself based on the demands of practical experience and the nature of diseases.
For some diseases, the ancient authors did not mention specific instruments due to the diversity of their types. If a bone in the jaw or any other facial bone breaks or becomes infected, search for it with an appropriate instrument from among these tools and forceps mentioned earlier under the section on removing roots.
We may also use these pincers, here is their illustration:
They should be slightly thicker to ensure a firm grip on the bone and prevent it from slipping while extracting, then treat the site with appropriate medications for healing. If there is any minor infection or decay in the bone, remove all traces of its impurities and dark color until it becomes clean, then proceed with treatment until it heals.
Chapter 32.
On the extraction of teeth that have grown over others.
If teeth grow in an unnatural manner, it ruins the appearance, especially if this happens to women and slaves; therefore, you should examine whether a tooth has grown behind another one.
If it cannot be removed by forceps or a lever, and if it is attached to another tooth, cut this tooth with the instrument shown in this illustration.
It is shaped like a small beak and made of very sharp Indian steel. You should cut this tooth over several days due to the hardness of the molar, and so as not to shake other molars. If it is protruding, use a rasp like this one from India.
It should be entirely made of Indian steel, with a very finely engraved handle like the rasp used to make needles. Use it to gently rasp away at the molar little by little over many days so as not to shake other molars loose. Then smooth and clean it with some rasps.
If a molar has broken and is causing pain to the tongue when speaking, it should also be rasped until any roughness from the break disappears so that it becomes smooth again and stops hurting the tongue or ruining speech.
Chapter 33.
On securing loose molars with silver thread or gold wire.
If the front molars become loose and wobbly due to a blow or fall, and the patient cannot chew anything without them falling out - despite having applied astringent medicine - then it is advisable...
The solution is to secure them with gold or silver thread, although the former is preferable as it does not oxidize and become foul-smelling like silver after some time has passed. The thread should be medium in thickness relative to how much space there is between each molar.
The image of ligation is as follows: take the thread and pass it through the gap between two sound molars, then weave with both ends of the thread around the mobile teeth, be they one or more, until you reach the other side with your weaving to the sound molar.
You then weave back to the side you began on, pulling gently and judiciously so that it moves not at all; your pull on the thread should be near the roots of the teeth so as not to slip, after which you cut the remaining ends with scissors, gather them, twist them together with a pair of tweezers, then hide them between the sound molar and the mobile one.
So that the tongue is not hurt, you should leave it tight as long as necessary. If it loosens or breaks, tighten it with another thread and enjoy this way for your whole life. This is an image of the molars and how ligation appears in two sound molars and two mobile ones as you see here:
Sometimes you may return a single tooth or two after they have fallen out to their place, and ligate as we described above; this is done by the skilled dental surgeon, who might also carve bone from the cow's skull to make it like a molar tooth, placing it in the position of the missing tooth. It is then tightened as we said before so that you may enjoy its use for an extended period of time.
Chapter 34.
On cutting the ligament which appears under the tongue, preventing speech.
This ligament that appears under the tongue may be either natural, with which a person is born; or acquired due to an injury which has healed.
The procedure is as follows: open the patient's mouth and place their head on your lap; lift up their tongue, then cut that nerve-cord across so that the tongue is released from its grip. If there is some stiffness or knotting due to a healed wound, incise it with a hook and make an incision across until the cord is divided and the knots are loosened.
Be careful not to make the incision too deep into the flesh, lest you sever an artery and cause bleeding; then have them rinse their mouth after the cut with rosewater or vinegar and cold water. Then place a linen wick under the tongue, which the patient should hold every night.
So that it does not heal again; if blood is shed, apply powdered white vitriol to the spot, and if the bleeding is strong, cauterize the place with a biconvex iron suitable for this purpose. Then treat them with all other therapies until they recover.
Chapter 35.
On the extraction of the frog-like cyst under the tongue.
A small frog-like cyst may occur under the tongue, which prevents the tongue from functioning properly; it might even grow into a bone and fill the mouth. The procedure is as follows: open the patient's mouth towards the sun and observe where the swelling originates.
If you see it, dark-coloured or black and hard without feeling for the patient, do not touch it as it is a cancerous growth; but if it tends towards whiteness with some moisture present, incise it with a hook and make an incision with a delicate scalpel, freeing it from every side.
If the blood overwhelms you during your work, place powdered lead acetate on it until the bleeding stops. Then return to your work and remove it completely, after which he should rinse with vinegar and salt.
Then treat it with the appropriate remaining treatment until it heals.
Chapter Thirty-Six
On the treatment of swollen tonsils.
And other tumours that grow in the throat may be glands similar to those that appear outside, called tonsils. If you treat them as mentioned in the previous section and they do not heal...
If the tumour is hard, dark in colour and has little sensation, do not expose it to iron. And if it is red in colour with a thick base, also do not expose it to iron for fear of bleeding. Instead, leave it until it ripens; you may then either remove it or allow it to burst on its own.
And if it is white in colour, round and has a thin base, this is the one that should be cut out. Before operating on it, check whether its hot swelling has completely subsided or diminished to some extent.
Then have the patient sit beside the sun with their head in your lap. Open his mouth and take a servant's tool between your hands to press down on his tongue using an instrument like this: [image of an instrument]
It is made of silver or copper, thin like a knife. When you press the tongue down with it and spot the tumour, take a hook and insert it into the tonsil, drawing it outwards as much as possible without pulling any membranes along with it.
Then cut it with an instrument that looks like this: resembling a pair of scissors, but its two ends are curved, and the edges of each end are very sharp. It is made from Indian iron or Damascene steel.
If this instrument is not available, then cut it with a scalpel that looks like this:
It is sharp on one side and not sharp on the other. After cutting out one tonsil, cut out the other in the same way. Then, after cutting, gargle the patient with cold water or a mixture of vinegar and water.
If there is any bleeding, gargle with water that has been boiled with pomegranate rind, myrtle leaves, or similar astringents, until the bleeding stops. Then treat it until it heals. Other tumors may grow in the throat apart from the tonsils; cut them out as I mentioned for cutting out the tonsils.
I treated a woman for a tumor that had grown inside her throat, leaning towards becoming a cyamosis, and was slightly insensitive. It almost completely blocked the throat, and the woman could only breathe through a narrow passage. It had prevented her from eating or drinking water.
She was close to death, and if she remained like that for another day or two, the tumor would have killed her. Two branches had sprouted from it, growing out of both her nostrils. So I quickly inserted a hook into one branch and pulled on it; this caused a substantial piece to be extracted.
I then cut the piece I had extracted at the nostril hole, and did likewise with what was protruding from her other nostril. Next, I opened her mouth, pressed down on her tongue, and inserted the hook into the tumor once more. Then I severed a portion of it; only a small amount of blood flowed out.
The woman's tumor burst and she immediately drank water, then had some food. We continued to cut away at the tumor for a long time; as we removed parts of it, new tissue formed in their place. This went on for quite a while.
I devised a plan and cauterized the tumor inside her throat, hoping it would stop growing. I then left that region and did not know what became of her after my departure.
Chapter Thirty-Seven.
On the excision of tonsillar tumors.
If a tonsillar tumor, known as a grape-like growth, descends and swells up, appearing white and elongated, it is called a column. If the base is thick and round, then it is referred to as a grape. Should treatment be applied as outlined in this section but proves ineffective...
When I saw that the hot tumor had subsided and her throat was thin, it became apparent that an excision should be performed. However, if the growth is clustered and round with no length, appearing reddish-blue or dark in color, and lacking sensation, then such an intervention ought to be avoided.
But this carries risk for the patient, and so if you encounter a growth of the type described, with its whiteness and length, it is best to have the patient sit facing the sun and depress their tongue using the instrument that will be described shortly. Then, insert the hook into the grape-like tumor.
Use this method to pull the growth downwards and cut it with one of the two instruments mentioned earlier for tonsillectomy. It is important not to remove more than what has grown beyond the natural state, as excessive excision could damage their voice and speech.
Then, after the incision, you should employ what we have described for cutting the tonsils and treat them until they heal. If the patient is reluctant to have them cut, then you should use cunning to cauterize them without fear or hesitation. The method of cauterization involves using a sharp medicinal tool while holding the patient's head in your lap.
Then, depress their tongue with the tool we mentioned earlier. Next, take some of the caustic water I described in the section on cauterization and mix it with unslaked lime to make a paste that is neither thick nor thin. Fill this paste into the depression of this tool; here is an illustration.
Its end, where you place the medicine, has a depression like that of an enema spoon. You position the tool with the medicine on their uvula while they lie on their side so that saliva can drain from their mouth and prevent any from falling into their throat which could harm them.
Then, hold your hand with the medicine and squeeze it onto their uvula for around half an hour until you see it has turned black and the stinging of the medicine has subsided. If you wish, you can take some cotton wool, wrap it around a tongue depressor, dip the cotton in the medicine...
...and insert the tongue depressor with the cotton into a tube from above so that the cotton adheres to their uvula. Repeat this process as many times as needed until you have cauterized the tonsils sufficiently. Leave it be, and after three or four days they will wither and fall out. If necessary, reapply the medicine.
After cauterization, wipe around the tonsils with cotton wool soaked in butter and dry off any medicine from the surrounding area. Then have them rinse their mouth with cold water. Treat the outside with compresses and the inside with gargles until they heal. This form of treatment is safer than incision and lessens fear.
The uvula can also be treated with a milder method than cauterization and excision. It is treated by fumigation in the following manner: take foutheng, hyssop, sage, rue, wormwood, chamomile, southernwood, and similar herbs; collect all or some of them in a pot and cover them with vinegar.
Boil [the herbs] and cover the pot with a layer of clay from a potter's wheel, ensuring it is well-sealed. Leave an opening in the middle of the lid; attach to this opening the hollow instrument made either from silver or copper: ...
Insert the end with the pomegranate-shaped knob into the patient's mouth so that the steam rises to reach the uvula via the tube until the uvula is sufficiently steamed; then repeat this process several times until it withers. Be sure not to perform this treatment in the early stages of swelling.
Should you not have this apparatus readily available, take a hollow reed and attach to one end an eggshell so that the patient's mouth is not burnt.
For the eggshell prevents the heat of the steam from scorching the mouth, making it a good and safe treatment.
Chapter 38.
On the removal of thorns and other objects that may lodge in the throat.
Frequently, a fishbone or other object may lodge in the throat. To remove visible objects, depress the tongue with an instrument and then extract the item.
To locate any unseen objects, induce vomiting in the patient before their food is fully digested; this may dislodge the object or allow you to see it as it passes through the throat.
Or they may swallow a mouthful of dry bread, or take a piece of soft sea sponge and attach it to a thread before swallowing it; when the sponge reaches the spot where the thorn is lodged, pull on the thread quickly. Do this several times.
Frequently, the thorn or bone becomes stuck in it and is dislodged. If this method does not succeed then use an instrument made of lead shaped as follows:
It is slightly thicker than a stylus and has a hook on one end which the patient inserts gently into their throat, with their head raised upwards and taking care not to touch the larynx so as not to cause coughing. The physician may also insert it by hand.
It is better for the patient to insert it as they know where the object is embedded and can push downwards, or pull their hand upwards using the instrument, doing so according to what seems appropriate until the object is removed.
Chapter 39
On the removal of leeches embedded in the throat.
If you treat the leech using the methods described in section on medicinal treatment and it is not effective, then examine the patient's throat when there is sunlight after pressing down their tongue with the instrument that I have described to you.
If you see the leech then pull it out with a small hook or a fine, sharp pair of forceps; if this is not possible, take a hollow tube and insert it into the patient's throat close to the leech, then pass a red-hot needle inside the tube.
You do this several times, and the patient refrains from water all day, then he takes a bowl full of cold water, opens his mouth in it, rinses his mouth with it without swallowing even one drop, and moves the water around occasionally with his hand.
For the leech will drop off if it feels water, so if it does not come out as we have described, then vaporize the throat with urine and gallnut by means of the instrument that I have described for fumigating the uvula; do this several times until it falls off.
The way to use the fumigation is as follows: take a container with glowing coals heated by fire, and cover it with a lid that has a hole in its center; insert the end of the instrument into this hole, then place the incense inside. The patient puts his mouth on the end of the tube and closes it so that no smoke escapes until he knows that the incense has reached his throat.
Then the leech will drop off, and if it does not, then the fumigation is repeated several times; meanwhile, the patient abstains from water because of thirst, eats salty food and garlic but drinks no water – this treatment must succeed. Here is a drawing of an instrument with which you can extract a leech from the throat when it comes into view.
It resembles grappling hooks as you can see, except that it has these curved prongs which are inserted into the throat; its two ends resemble a bird’s beak and have the roughness of a file – if they grab something then they do not let go.
There is another instrument which presses down on the tongue; it consists of a wide iron ring, as large as the mouth, placed above the tongue. It is inserted into the mouth vertically on its side, and keeps the mouth open despite the patient’s lack of will to do so – he cannot remove it by any means until you take it out.
Description of the instrument that opens the mouth on this very measurement.
Chapter Forty.
In it he speaks about the treatment of tumours by incision.
Tumours are of many types and varied, as will be mentioned individually in this book; they differ with regard to incision and splitting on two counts: first, the type of tumour itself and what it contains in terms of humours.
The second type of difference is due to the locations in which they occur in the body, for a tumour that occurs in the head is not like one occurring in the buttocks; nor is a tumour arising in a fleshy part like one occurring at a joint - each has its own rules regarding treatment.
There are tumours that should not be lanced until the pus in them has matured and reached its full state; there are others which should be lanced while still fresh, before they have fully matured - such as those occurring near joints.
For if a tumour occurs near a joint and is left until its surroundings become gangrenous, it may destroy the ligaments or nerves of that joint, causing permanent damage to the limb; or perhaps the tumour is close to an important organ.
If you delay lancing it until it is fully matured, you may damage the important organ; or perhaps the tumour is close to the buttocks and must be lanced while fresh, even though it is not yet fully mature - this is necessary so that the incision does not become gangrenous and penetrate into the interior of the buttocks, forming a fistula.
And it becomes a wound that will not heal; you should know the time for lancing tumours which have fully matured, which is when the pain of the tumour has subsided, the fever has gone away, redness and swelling have decreased, the head of the tumour has become soft, and all other signs.
The duck's beak should be inserted at the lowest point of the tumor if possible, to facilitate the flow of pus downwards or at the thinnest part of the tumor and where it is most prominent. The duck's beak should be positioned in line with the body if the tumors are located towards the hands and feet.
The positions of muscles, tendons, nerves, and arteries should be considered in general for all flat areas without bends or folds. For those with bends or folds, adjust the duck's beak accordingly. If the tumor is located in fleshy areas, it is best to leave the duck's beak out.
Until it is fully ripe, as we have said before, if you lance it prematurely, the discharge of pus will be prolonged, and there will be much suppuration and dirt. The lips may become hardened, and the cavity contract. Some tumors require lancing across the body when necessary or according to the needs of the affected part.
For small tumors, use a single duck's beak, and for large ones, use a wide beak or make multiple incisions according to the size of the tumor. In some cases, it may be necessary to scoop out the skin and cut it if it has become like a rag.
It has reached a certain limit, and what is dead must be removed, as often happens with many abscesses and cysts. Some are incised with an incision having three angles, while others have a piece cut out of them shaped like a bay leaf or the groin tumor.
For some, a circular or crescent-shaped incision may be used, along with other similar incisions. For those without a head, such as smooth, flat tumors, only a simple duck's beak should be employed. If the tumor is large and contains a great deal of pus, having been lanced already, you should not proceed hastily to extract all the pus at once.
Remove some of it [the pus] and then tighten the swelling for another day, then remove some pus as well. Repeat this process several times gradually until all the pus is out.
Especially if the patient is weak or a pregnant woman, child or elderly person; often the animal spirit dissipates with the rapid removal of pus, and the patient may die without you realizing it. So be very cautious about this procedure.
After you have lanced these swellings, it is necessary to clean the wound and assess if the incision is small or simple, then use a bandage of old linen or cotton; but if the swelling is large and there are multiple incisions,
You should pack each incision with a pledget, ensuring they are all connected; if the swelling requires skin excision or debridement, it must be packed with old cotton or linen threads without any moisture and tightly bandaged until the third day.
Then remove the packing and treat it with appropriate ointments until healing occurs; if bleeding persists, use cold water and vinegar after soaking a linen cloth in them, applying it to the site of bleeding repeatedly.
If bleeding continues, you must employ management and treatment methods described in various sections of this book as well as the compendium; if it's winter and the site is highly innervated, then moisten dressings with warm oil and spirits.
Apply these dressings to the site; if it's summer and the area is fleshy, moisten dressings with cold water or spirits/oil; by day three as previously mentioned, remove the bandages and clean the wound.
And it is treated with something similar to itself until it heals, and this is all you need to know about the treatment of tumors in general. As for the detailed method, I have mentioned each type of tumor individually, categorizing and summarizing its specific treatment.
Chapter Forty-One.
On incising tumors that occur on the scalp.
Tumors occur on the scalp that are small and belong to the "sala'a" category, contained within thin membranes resembling chicken egg sacs; their types are numerous: some are fatty while others contain a viscous liquid resembling mud.
Some contain a moisture resembling bran or soup-like substance, while others are hardened and solid. All of them can be safely incised and removed unless you encounter an artery during the incision process.
The procedure for incising them is to first probe them with the instrument described below, called a "madis", in order to understand their contents. If they contain moisture, then make an incision along its length with a simple cut as illustrated: [image of incision].
Begin the incision from line ~B~ to line ~C~. Once the moisture has been drained, peel and cut away the entire sac that contained it; leave nothing behind for it often returns if any part is left remaining.
Then dip a piece of cotton in galbanum ointment, or salt water if it is not available, and fill the wound with it. Leave it for another day as it will dissolve any remaining sac; repeat this process with fresh galbanum-soaked cotton a second and third time if necessary.
Until you are certain that none of the cyst remains, then treat the wound with ointments until it heals. If the swelling contains fatty tissue, make an incision in this manner:.
Make a cross-shaped incision and hook the forceps into each lip of the wound, then peel it away from every side, striving to extract the membrane that encloses it. If you encounter an artery, do as I described for you previously. Likewise, proceed with the swelling if it is hardened by the incision.
The treatment is as mentioned, and the incision into a hardened swelling is easier because it has less blood and moisture. Some of these swellings in the head may occur in certain people with absolutely no moisture at all; I have come across such a case.
In the head of an elderly woman, I found a swelling like hard stone, rough and white; it could not be broken even if someone were to throw it at you. The other swellings that occur in the heads of children are different from these.
Make an incision at the base of the ears, a single one; arrange its margins from below to facilitate drainage downwards and then treat it with whatever treatment is appropriate.
Chapter Forty-Two
On Incision into Cysts that Occur in the Neck, These cysts frequently occur in the neck, under the armpits and in the groins; they may also be found elsewhere on the body. Sometimes there is just one of them in the neck, while at other times there are many, some generated by others.
Each cyst is enclosed in a membrane of its own, just as with tumors and swellings on the head, as we described earlier. There are many types of these cysts: some harden, others contain moisture, while yet others are malignant and do not respond to treatment.
If you touch it and find that the mass is soft, its surface color matches closely to that of the skin, and it moves freely in all directions without being adherent to any nerve or vein of the neck, nor does it appear sunken. Therefore, you should make an incision on it simply from above to below the body in this manner, along the line from point 'J' to point 'B':.
You should then strip it away from all sides, stretching the lips of the skin with a hook or two hooks or many as needed, just as we said for head tumors, and extract it little by little while being careful to keep it on the neck so that you do not cut any veins or nerves; let your scalpel be only slightly sharp.
So that you do not cut more than necessary or cause the patient distress and thus end up cutting something that should be left untouched, if ever you do cut a vein or artery and this prevents you from continuing your work, place powdered zinc oxide in the wound or some other hemostatic agent.
Then compress the wound and leave it until the inflammation subsides, the wound relaxes, and suppuration begins to form; at that point, the bleeding will stop so you can resume your work and complete it. Then check with your index finger if there are any remaining small cysts, which you should excise and remove.
If the cyst has a large nerve at its origin, you should not excise it entirely but instead tie it with a strong double thread and leave it so that it can drop on its own without causing any harm; then pack the wound with old lint dipped in Egyptian ointment and treat it.
And if the entire hogshead is cut, it should be gathered that the edges of the wound are brought together and sutured immediately after confirming there remains no excess flesh whatsoever. If you observe any remaining excess due to the bone structure of the hog.
You should aim to cut at its base and apply the suturing method as mentioned previously. For cuts made on hogs, which tend to be more moist, you may simply pad it with a simple dressing where necessary to promote healing, ensuring the padding is applied to the lower side as instructed earlier.
After the padding, you may use Egyptian ointment and similar substances to promote healing of any remaining corruption until you observe the wound is clean. Then treat it with ointments that stimulate flesh growth until it fully heals.
Chapter 43
On the incision of the larynx to treat swellings that occur within the throat.
Early sources have mentioned this laryngeal incision for throat swellings, but I have not witnessed anyone in our region perform it. This is a common thread in their discourse. As for those suffering from dysphasia, they should avoid the laryngeal incision as it would be of no benefit to them.
Due to the fact that all of the internal organs and the lungs are affected, and for those suffering from hot swellings in the mouth, throat or tonsils if there is no problem with the windpipe, it is imperative to employ the laryngeal incision to prevent deterioration caused by asphyxiation.
When performing this, one should make a small incision across the larynx below three or four of the tracheal rings, between two rings and to an extent similar to an incision in the peritoneum but not through cartilage. This position is suitable for the incision.
Since it is devoid of flesh and the blood vessels are distant, if the physician is timid they should stretch out the skin of the throat with a hook, then make an incision in the skin until you reach the trachea; turn away from any blood vessels that may be visible.
Then the peritoneum, which we have described, is cut through, and you can find out where to make an incision in the trachea from the phlegm that comes out of it along with what perforates; also from the cessation of the voice, and leave the wound open for some time. When this period, during which suffocation was feared, has passed, bring together the lips of the wound from the skin.
Its outline, and the cartilage alone is removed without any of its lining. Then you should use medicines that promote flesh growth until it heals. The author of this book says: 'The meaning of all these words which we have related is only when they see a patient whose throat has been blocked by one of those tumors that were mentioned'.
And the patient is near to death, and their life is in peril; they proceed to make an incision into the larynx so that the patient can breathe somewhat through the wound site and thus be saved from death. They were instructed to leave the wound open until the severity of the illness has passed, which takes about three days or so.
Then they were instructed to suture the wound and treat it so that it may heal. What I personally witnessed was a servant who took a knife and thrust it into her throat, cutting part of the trachea; when summoned to treat her, I found she was gasping like something slaughtered. So, I uncovered the wound.
I found that the blood which had come out of the wound was minimal, so I knew she hadn't cut any arteries or veins; breath came from the wound. So, I quickly sutured the wound and treated it until it healed. Apart from a hoarseness in her voice, nothing happened to the servant.
And she returned after some days to her best condition. Thus we say that laryngotomy carries no risk.
Chapter 44.
On the incision of a swelling that appears in the pharynx from without, which is called elephantiasis of the pharynx.
The swelling called elephantiasis of the pharynx is a large tumour coloured like the body; it occurs frequently in women and has two varieties.
It may be either natural or symptomatic; there is no remedy for the former, but as to the latter, it has two forms: one resembles a fatty tumour and the other resembles an arterial aneurysm. To perform an incision on this kind carries some risk. You should never dare to use the knife on it, except for a small one which you have tested and probed with the probe, finding that it resembles fatty tissue without being attached to any of the vessels; then cut into it as you would an ordinary fatty tumour. Remove it with its capsule if there is one, otherwise excise the whole thing and treat the wound as required.
Chapter 45.
On incising different kinds of fatty tumours.
There are numerous varieties of fatty tumours, all of which have been mentioned in the classification; we should now clarify the distinction between them and ulcers since this can be confusing. An ulcer is accompanied by fever, heat and severe pain until the inflammation subsides. And the abscess completes its process; then the fever and inflammation subside. There is no heat or fever with this treatment, nor any pains. It is contained within a serous membrane which forms a special covering for it. Its color resembles that of the body, and initially it is like a chickpea but becomes larger, sometimes like an egg, and at other times smaller.
There are two types of it, either fatty or containing fluid, and the colors of the fluid are many as I have already mentioned in the classification. Therefore, when you proceed to treat an abscess, you should first examine it thoroughly using the instrument known as 'al-madis,' which will be illustrated in the following chapter.
Examine the size of the swelling, then use the 'madis' and observe what it brings out. If fluid is discharged, regardless of its color, make a simple incision as described for other tumors. But if no fluid is released after using the 'madis,' know that it is fatty.
Make a cross-shaped incision on it as I have instructed you, then suspend it with hooks and carefully remove the skin from each side. Be cautious to preserve the sac, if possible, so that you can extract it whole together with the abscess.
If the sac is ruptured during the procedure and you are unable to remove it whole, which often occurs, then extract it in pieces so that nothing remains. For if any part of it is left behind, whether small or large, the abscess will recur with greater severity.
If you are unable to remove all of it and a small amount remains, then irritate the wound upon finishing by applying some sharp corrosive substances. Draw the edges of the wound together tightly and apply something that will reduce the hot swelling. Treat it with other remedies until it heals completely. If the abscess is large, draw its lips together and treat it with a substance that promotes healing.
If you encounter a prominent vein, whether beating or not, and the bleeding is excessive, quickly apply crushed zinc oxide to the area and leave it tightly bound for two or three days until the wound becomes gangrenous and the blood flow subsides. Then return to remove any remaining pieces.

In pictures of instruments.
Instruments for cutting and sewing, pictures of which are shown below, include three types of tenaculum: large, medium, and small.
Picture of a large tenaculum.
Picture of a medium-sized tenaculum.
Picture of a small tenaculum.
Made of square-shaped steel and iron, these are designed to be quickly inserted into tumors. Below are pictures of the probes, which are called lancets; there are also three types: large, medium, and small. Picture of a large lancet.
Picture of a medium-sized lancet.
Picture of a small lancet.
They are used to probe tumors, wounds, fistulas and hidden areas for bones or other obstructions. They are made of rounded polished copper that is smooth like a mirror or bell metal, or from brass, iron or silver; the best are those made of bell metal.
Probes may also be made of black lead and are used to probe fistulas with a bend in them, allowing the flexible lead to follow that bend; they too come in three types: long, medium, and short.
As deep as is needed to match the depth of each fistula, and make its thickness according to the size and tightness of the fistula. An image of a large lead probe.

Illustrations of hooks, which are of many types: There are simple ones with a single barb and these are of three sizes - large, medium, and small. Then there are blind hooks, also in three varieties. Furthermore, there are double-barbed hooks of three kinds, and finally, the curved double-barbed hook. And there are three types of triple-barbed hooks. Each of these, in its own place, is required.

These are the incising and dissecting scalpels, which come in three types - large, medium, and small. Figure: A large scalpel.
Figure: A medium-sized scalpel.
Figure: A small scalpel.
The cutting edges of the blades are sharp, while their other ends are blunt. This design is intentional: it assists in dissecting lesions without severing vessels or nerves, and also provides some comfort to the patient, offering slight relief from the burning sensation experienced during tumor dissection.
These are the probes, which also come in three types - large, medium, and small. Figure: A large probe.
They are crafted from copper, like the applicator used for eye cosmetics. At one end is a feature resembling a broad spoon, comprising two layers with the scalpel blade hidden within it, shaped like a bird's tongue and capable of sliding inwards and outwards as needed.
These are the scalpels used to feel tumors between the fingers, which patients do not perceive. They come in three types - large, medium, and small. Figure: A large scalpel.
Images of cups used to stop bleeding, which are of three types: large, medium and small. Image of the large cup:
They are made of copper or porcelain, slightly elongated and rounded as you see; they should be thin. These types of cups, large and small, should be available to you so that you can quickly stop the bleeding when necessary, especially if no medication is at hand.
However, they are not used to stop bleeding in every part of the body; rather, they are employed on fleshy areas such as the muscles of the leg and thigh, arm, breast, abdomen, groin, and similar fleshy, moist parts.
Other small instruments can be made from them that resemble pistachio shells, as shown in this image:
They stop the bleeding if it occurs at a cupping site or when a vein or artery is cut, and they can also be made round like this:
Chapter 47.
On the treatment of male breast conditions.
Some people's breasts may swell during puberty, resembling those of women and remaining unsightly as the breast enlarges unattractively. Anyone who dislikes this should make a crescent-shaped incision in the breast like so:
From line B to line C. Then remove all the fat and fill the wound with healing medication; bring together the lips of the wound by sewing them up, and treat it until it heals. If the breast sags downwards and becomes slack due to its bone structure, as happens in women,
Thus, you should make incisions on its upper sides in two locations resembling a crescent shape; each one connects to the other at their ends so that the larger line surrounds the smaller one as shown here. From line ~B~ to line ~C~, then remove the skin that lies between the incisions and take out any fat; you should use what we have mentioned about stitches and sutures and whatever treatment is required until it heals.
If you are unable to remove all that needs to be removed due to the patient's distress or because of bleeding, then you should pack the wound with cotton soaked in caustic ointment and leave it until it eats away any remaining fat; afterward, treat it so that it may heal.
Chapter 48.
On draining abscesses that occur under the armpit.
Abscesses that occur under the armpit are of the hard, swine variety and are contained within a sac; some contain moisture while others do not. Those containing moisture should be incised with an incision shaped like this: [draws a crescent shape].
From line ~B~ to line ~C~; once you have drained all that is within the abscess, stuff it with old cotton and leave it for another day before removing the cotton.
Treat it with the appropriate ointment until it heals; if the abscess is of the hard, swine variety, then make an incision as we have described for such abscesses previously. If the wound persists and continues to discharge pus, cauterize it as we mentioned earlier.
Chapter Forty-Nine.
In incising an aneurysm, which is a swelling occurring over an artery or vein.
When an artery is wounded, and the skin above it has healed over, then a swelling often occurs there; likewise, when a vein is injured, a bulge and swelling may develop upon it.
The signs by which one can tell whether a swelling is caused by an artery or a vein: if it is from the artery, then the swelling will be elongated and gathered towards the depth of the body; when you press upon this kind of swelling with your finger, you will feel as though there were a rattle.
A swelling caused by a vein will be rounded, and appear upon the surface of the body; making an incision in these swellings is dangerous, especially when they occur in the armpit, groin, neck or other parts of the body which are very large - it should be avoided to treat them with metal instruments.
Swellings occurring in the extremities or head should also be avoided; if there is an enlargement at the opening of an artery, then cut into it with a lengthwise incision through the skin, open up this incision using hooks and then strip off the artery from its membranes.
Once it is exposed, insert a needle underneath [the artery] and pierce through to the other side; then draw the artery tight with a doubled thread in two places as I explained previously when discussing how to tie the two arteries of the temples - after this, prick the location between the ligaments until all the blood has come out.
The swelling will then subside; you should use a treatment which causes pus to be generated until the ligaments fall off, and afterwards treat it with appropriate ointments until it heals.
If the swelling is caused by a vein injury, you should grasp as much of the swelling and skin with your hand as possible. Then insert a needle below the point that your hand holds and pass it through. Thread a doubled thread through the needle until you extract it from the other side. Then tie the swelling tightly with the thread as I have explained for binding grapes, on both sides, with both ends of the thread. If you fear that the threads may slip, insert another needle under all the swellings at the intersection of the first needle, with another thread.
Tighten the threads at four points, then cut open the swelling in its middle so that what is inside comes out. Then cut off any excess skin and leave only what was tied up. After this, place a dressing that has been soaked in wine vinegar and oil on it. Then treat the wound with massage and ointments until it heals.
Chapter Fifty.
On swellings caused by nerve injury.
Swellings caused by nerve injury occur as a result of trauma, excessive fatigue, or similar causes and are most often found in the wrists and heels.
These swellings are hard, the same color as the rest of the body, usually painless, and when pressed firmly feel like numbness to the patient. They do not occur deep within the body.
They are found under the skin and can be moved in any direction but not forward or backward. Those that occur at joints should not be treated with iron instruments, as this may cause permanent disability. Those on the head or forehead, however...
Make an incision in the skin with a lancet; if the tumor is small, grasp it with forceps and cut it from its base; if it is large, suspend it with a hook, then strip it off, remove it, bring together the wound with sutures, and treat it until it heals.
Chapter fifty-one.
On the excision of warts that appear on the belly.
Some people may develop many warts, called fungi, on their bellies or other parts of the body due to a thin base and thick head with turned-in lips; these can be small or grow very large.
I once saw a man with two warts on his belly, looking much like fungi, white and thin at the base, their lips turned in and cracked, constantly oozing moisture; I excised them, each weighing about eighteen ounces, one being six ounces heavier than the other.
To treat them, first consider if the patient is moist and whether the wart's color is white; if so, it should be excised with a broad lancet, having heated cauteries at hand since cutting often results in much bloodletting.
If blood becomes an issue, cauterize it quickly; should the patient be scared of iron tools for excision, use a tight lead wire instead and pull on the wart for two days, then increase the tension by pulling more firmly with the lead wire over time.
Should the base be thick, excision is more difficult and carries risk; especially if it's on the belly but you might manage to cut off half or part of it.
You then cauterize it to prevent recurrence, and treat it until the wound heals. Be careful not to excise a wart that is dark in color, insensitive, and unsightly; for it is a cancerous tumor, and we shall discuss cancer after this.
Chapter Fifty-Two.
In the treatment of an umbilical hernia.
An umbilical hernia can have many causes: either from a rupture of the peritoneum on the abdomen, causing the omentum or intestine to protrude as in other types of hernias; or due to bleeding from a vein or artery, as previously mentioned; or because of trapped wind.
If it is due to a rupture of the peritoneum and protrusion of the omentum, then the tumor appears flesh-colored, soft, painless, and visibly abnormal. If it is due to protrusion of the intestine, then its appearance differs greatly from what we have described: when pressed with fingers, it recedes and returns; there may be borborygmi, and it increases considerably in size upon defecation and during intense physical activity. If it is due to moisture, then it remains soft.
If it is due to bleeding, then with these signs the tumor appears dark in color; if it is caused by overgrown flesh, then the tumor feels hard and firm, remaining at a consistent size.
If it is due to trapped wind, then its touch feels soft. In this case, you should refrain from treating an umbilical hernia caused by arterial or venous bleeding, or by wind, as there are risks involved, as I informed you in the chapter where I discussed tumors arising from arteries and veins.
If the navel bulge is due to the intestines or omentum, you should instruct the patient to hold themselves in and stand erect with their body stretched out; then mark all around the navel with ink. Then you should instruct the patient to lie down on their back between your hands; then make an incision with a broad scalpel around the navel at the spot marked with ink, and stretch the middle of the tumour upwards with a large hook; then tie the place of the incision tightly with strong thread or raw silk.
The knot of the ligature should be a loop; then you open up the middle of the stretched tumour above the ligature and insert your index finger, and request the intestines; if you find that the ligature has caught them, then loosen the loop and push the intestines into the abdomen; but if it is omentum, stretch it with a hook.
Cut off the extra portion, and if you encounter an artery or vein, tie it off with a ligature; then return to your work and take two needles, into which you insert two strong threads, and enter these needles into the incision that was made around the tumour in a criss-cross fashion, having penetrated them fully; then stretch the tumour at four points on the needles.
If you wish, remove the needles and leave the area until the stretched flesh becomes putrid and falls off on its own or cut it away once it has softened and become putrid; then treat it with the appropriate ointments so that it heals, if the navel bulge is due to a growth of flesh within it.
Or if it is due to moisture, you should scoop out the tumour as we have said and extract the blood or moisture that you find within; then treat it with something that will seal the spot.
Chapter fifty-three.
In the treatment of cancer.
We have mentioned in the classification the types of cancer and how to treat it with medications, warning against treating it with iron so that it does not ulcerate, and we discussed the cancer generated in the womb, also warning against its treatment.
The ancients have stated that when cancer is in a position where it can be completely excised, such as cancer of the breast or thigh and similar organs capable of being extracted entirely, especially if it is in its early stages and small, then one should proceed with treatment. However, if the cancer has advanced and become large, it should not be approached.
I have never been able to cure anyone of it, nor have I seen anyone before me achieve that. The treatment for such a cancer, if it can be accessed as mentioned earlier, is to repeatedly cauterize the patient's black bile until their condition improves. Then, if there is any noticeable blockage in the veins, you may proceed with venesection.
Then, make the patient exert themselves until they are capable of enduring the procedure, after which you should use suitable hooks to extract the cancer. Next, scoop it out from every direction along with the skin, ensuring that none of its roots remain intact and allowing the blood to drain freely without stopping it prematurely.
Instead, you should compress the affected areas and drain out all of the thick blood with your hand or any other suitable tools available to you. If during this process a great deal of bleeding occurs from severing an artery or vein, then ligate the vessel until the bleeding stops before treating the wound accordingly until it is healed.
Chapter fifty-four.
On treating ascites.
In the previous chapter, we have discussed the types of ascites, how fluid accumulates, and the signs and symptoms of each type, as well as their treatment with medications. Only the serous type can be treated with cauterization; the tympanic and fleshy types should never be subjected to this procedure.
This is dangerous; if you have treated this serous type of ascites with medications without success, then examine the patient to determine whether they are extremely weak or suffering from another disease in addition to ascites, such as...
For instance, if they have a cough or diarrhea; avoid treating them with cauterization as this is risky. If the patient appears strong and healthy without any other diseases besides ascites, excluding children and the elderly, then the procedure should involve having the patient stand before you... ...and an attendant behind them squeezing their abdomen with both hands to push the fluid down towards the pubic area. Then, take a spiny lancet like this one:
...whose edges are sharpened on both sides and whose tip is pointed, similar to a lancet, except somewhat flatter to avoid penetrating the intestines during the procedure and causing damage. Examine to determine whether the ascites has developed due to issues with the intestine...
...then the incision should be made below the navel, three fingers' width away from it and aligned with the pubic area. If ascites has developed due to liver disease, then your incision must be on the left side of the navel, again, three finger-widths away. For spleen diseases, make the incision on the right side, a similar distance away.
The incision should also not be made on the side where the patient wishes to lie down, lest the pus flow into that weak spot. Then pierce through the skin with the instrument and insert it into the wound, then lift your hand.
With the scalpel, separate the skin from the peritoneum as if you are flaying it, and let what you peel be of a size similar to that of a fingernail or so. Then pierce through the peritoneum until the tip of the scalpel reaches an empty spot - this is where the water collects - then withdraw it and insert in its place the instrument shown below.
It is like a small tube made of thin reed, crafted from silver, copper or polished smooth esparto grass and it has at its bottom a small hole; on the sides are three holes: two on one side, with one opposite them.
Or you may sharpen its end like the nib of a pen, as shown below:
At its upper end is a loop so that when the instrument reaches the water, it will immediately flow into it and you can thus remove a moderate amount of fluid at any one time because if you were to extract more than is necessary, this may cause death by the dissolution of the animal spirit.
Or he may suffer an obstruction, which brings him near to death; so you should extract a quantity proportional to his strength and the state of his health as shown by the forcefulness of his pulse and the good colour in his body. Then withdraw the instrument and restrain the patient from urinating because it will be retained immediately.
This is due to the skin covering the hole in the peritoneum, which you were instructed to cauterize as described; then reinsert the instrument a day later if the patient's condition allows for it.
You will also pour out a small amount of water, doing this for several days while you are on his neck and avoiding any mistakes until only a little water remains; if you fear for the patient's health and have left too much water inside him then treat it by burying [the patient] in hot sand.
And treat excessive sweating in the bath and sun, enduring thirst, and treating it with drying medications until he recovers; cauterize over the stomach, liver, and spleen after removing water as described previously.
Chapter 55.
On treating children who are born with their urinary orifices unpierced, pierced too tightly, or in the wrong place.
Some boys may be born with their urethral orifice unpierced, so you should pierce it immediately upon birth.
With a very thin scalpel as shown below:
Then place a thin lead peg into the orifice, bind it in place and keep it there for three to four days; whenever he needs to urinate remove it so he can pass urine then replace it again. If you do not use this method of keeping the orifice open with lead then urine will flow over it but leave it untouched.
For boys whose orifice is too narrow, treat as described above with lead for many days until it widens; and for those who are born with the orifice at the wrong place - such that they cannot urinate forward due to its position near the tip of the penis.
He should raise his penis upwards with his hand to urinate rather than forwards, otherwise the semen will not be able to reach the uterus properly and that is a very bad condition; you should treat it as follows: have him lie on his back.
Then, with your left hand, you stretch the foreskin vigorously and cut open the head of the urethra with a blade or a sharp scalpel, like the size of a reed pen, as if carving something to make its center protruding, resembling a foreskin, so that the hole is located in the middle as it should be.
Be mindful of blood loss during the procedure, as it often occurs. Counter it with a substance that stops bleeding and treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter 56.
On the boils that appear on the glans, foreskin, blackness, decay, and adhesion of the foreskin to the glans.
This boil often appears in the urethra; it is an unsightly fleshy tumor and can be malignant or non-malignant. For the non-malignant one, you should suspend it with a fine hook.
And you cut it until you cleanse all of it, then apply to it a cotton swab dipped in Egyptian ointment; afterward, treat it with the palm-ointment until it heals. As for if the boil is malignant and unsightly in color, you should use cauterization after cutting and stripping.
If the boil is on an uncircumcised foreskin and some of it is inside while some are outside, you should extract first those that are inside; once they heal, then treat those on the outside.
Because if you treat them together, you cannot ensure that the foreskin won't tear; it can also appear on the testicles and cause blackening and decay of the foreskin, in which case you should scoop out all that has turned black or is about to decay or has already done so.
Then apply to it honey with crushed and sieved pomegranate skin and carline thistle, then treat the wound with all other remedies until it heals. If there is any bleeding, use cauterization with a lunar-shaped iron:.
Cauterization is beneficial for both conditions, that is, bleeding and a corrupt wound. If the glans is eaten away entirely at any time, then one should insert into the urethra a lead pipe so that the patient may urinate through it. As for adhesion of the prepuce to the glans,
This adhesion occurs in a person with an intact foreskin who has not undergone circumcision. Adhesion of the prepuce may also occur due to a wound or swelling, so one should peel it away using a blunt scalpel until the ligament dissolves and the glans is freed on all sides.
If it is difficult to distinguish them upon examination, one should peel away some of the glans and prepuce. For the prepuce is thin, and may quickly perforate due to its thinness. Then separate the prepuce from the glans with a thin linen cloth that has been dampened in cold water, so as not to cause further adhesion.
It is then treated with an astringent drink until it heals.
Chapter 57.
In the purification of boys and treatment of any errors that may arise.
Circumcision is nothing more than the separation of two connected parts, like any other surgery. However, since it is an act that we perform with our own free will and specifically on boys, we must outline the best method to carry it out.
And the easiest way to achieve safety, I say that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books because it was not used in their laws but rather is something we have acquired.
By experience, for I have found that the general public of craftsmen and barbers use cleansing with a razor and scissors; they also use binding with thread and cutting with fingernails. I have tried all these methods.
I did not find anything better than cleansing with scissors and binding with thread because cleansing with a razor often damages the foreskin since its skin consists of two layers; thus, perhaps the upper layer is cut while the lower one remains intact.
This leads to further cutting and renewed pain. Cleansing with a probe is not safe as it may cause the urethra to be cut due to its entrance into the orifice, and cleansing with fingernails often fails to catch the foreskin which ruins your work or in case the child's foreskin is naturally short...
This is often the case with many children who are born like that and don't need any cleansing; I have seen it myself. As for cleansing with scissors and binding with thread, experience has shown me its advantages because the scissors make precise incisions given that both blades are identical.
When you squeeze the foreskin between the blades, the cut is uniform and made in one motion resulting in a thread binding that resembles a wall on all sides of the urethra without any errors whatsoever; the first step is to deceive the child.
Especially if the child has some understanding, you should tell him that you are only tying a thread around his urethra and will leave it until another day; reassure and comfort him in any way possible using whatever he can mentally accept. Then place him standing before you.
Do not sit down, and hide the scissors in your sleeve or under your foot; let it never come into sight, nor any of the instruments, then put your hand inside his urethra and blow up the skin and pull it upwards until you can see the opening.
Clean it from the dirt that has accumulated, then tie a double thread around the marked spot and tie another one slightly below; take hold of the lower tied area with your thumb and index finger and cut between the two ligatures. Then quickly pull the skin upwards and expose the urethral opening; allow a little blood to flow, as it is better and reduces inflammation of the urethra; then dry it with a damp cloth; sprinkle upon it some ash from burnt dried gourds - this is the best remedy I have tried - or wheat flour, which is also excellent.
Then quickly pull the skin upwards and expose the urethral opening; allow a little blood to flow, as it is better and reduces inflammation of the urethra; then dry it with a damp cloth; sprinkle upon it some ash from burnt dried gourds - this is the best remedy I have tried - or wheat flour, which is also excellent. Place on top of the powder a cloth containing egg yolk cooked in rosewater mixed with fresh, fragrant rose oil; leave this there until the next day, then treat him with the rest of the remedy until he is healed.
This is an image of scissors suitable for use in surgery:
The scissors must be blunt-tipped, sharp and straight with no defects; the length of both blades should match that of the handles exactly. If an error occurs during surgery such that part or all of the inner layer gets turned inside out when cutting then you must stretch it back into place immediately using your fingernail before the area swells.
Make the cut evenly; if you cannot hold it with your fingernail then hook and pull it using a surgical hook and cut it off; if after three days, swelling remains under the head of the urethra causing inflammation, leave it until the hot swelling subsides and then peel it away gently.
Cut it according to what seems appropriate to you, and be careful of the head of the urethra; if a part of its head is cut off, that will not harm it much. Treat it with something that heals wounds from among the powders we described in the article on powders.
And if too much of the skin is cut and it shrinks upwards, that will not cause a lot of harm either. Treat it with what we mentioned until it heals.
Chapter 58.
In treating urine retention in the bladder.
Urine retention in the bladder occurs due to blockage by a stone, clotted blood, pus or growing flesh and such things. If you treat it according to what we have mentioned regarding types of treatment described in the classification.
And if urine does not drain and you find that it is due to a stone which has damaged the neck of the bladder, then the patient should be made to kneel on their knees, then a man mounts his back and stretches his stomach towards his back while the patient himself holds onto what he can.
Then, the neck of the bladder is forced to push the stone backwards and urine will drain. If it does not drain according to what we have mentioned, and matters become severe for the patient, then you must use a tool to extract [the stone] which is called a catheter, as shown in this image.
It is made of thin, smooth silver and hollow like the tube of a bird's feather in its thinness and length of about one and half palms with a small funnel at its head. To draw urine out, take a folded string and tie to it either wool or cotton well.
Insert the end of the thread into the bottom of the catheter and cut with scissors if any excess wool remains so that it can be inserted into the tube like a button, then grease the catheter with oil or butter or egg white and seat the patient on a chair.
Lubricate his bladder and urethra with wet ointments or warm oil and water, then gently insert the catheter into the urethra until it reaches the origin of the urethra; bend the urethra upwards towards the navel, then push the catheter inside.
Once the urethra is bent, push the catheter inside until it reaches close to the anus; incline the penis downwards with the catheter still inserted, then push it further until it reaches the bladder and the patient can feel that it has reached an empty space.
This is done in this manner because the path through which urine passes has a bend; then, pull out the thread with the wool tightly, for the urine will follow the wool; then remove it and allow the urine to flow freely, after which you may reinsert the catheter.
Continue doing this until the bladder is completely emptied, and the patient feels relieved.
Chapter 59.
How to inject the bladder with the syringe.
The instruments suitable for this purpose are made of silver or ivory, hollow with a long, thin tube like that used to discharge pus; if you wish to drip water and medicine into it, then it should be done using an instrument called a syringe. This is its image: [image caption]
The instrument is made of silver or ivory, hollow with a long tube as slender as a twig, hollow throughout except for the end which is solid and has three holes: two on one side and one on the other, as you can see.
The hollow spot where the syringe is placed should be just big enough to seal it without any excess, so that when you pull on it, fluids are pulled out, and when you push, they're pushed out to a distance, much like a siphon used to throw oil in naval warfare.
If you want to remove fluids from the bladder, insert the tip of the syringe into the fluid and pull it up with the syringe; the fluid will be pulled into the syringe's cavity. Then, insert its tip into the urethra as described for catheters, and push the fluid out with the plunger.
Thus, that fluid reaches the bladder bit by bit until the patient feels it; this is a picture of another fine syringe also used to irrigate the bladder.
It is made of silver or esparto grass; its upper part resembles a small funnel, and underneath there's a groove where the tie goes. You take a camel's bladder, fill it with the fluid to be injected into the patient's bladder, then you tightly tie it between the two flanges with doubled thread.
Warm that fluid slightly over a fire, insert the syringe's tip into the urethra, then press your hand firmly on the bladder with the fluid until the patient feels it has reached the bladder.
If you don't have a bladder, take a piece of fine leather and make it into a circle; punch holes all around its rim, then insert a strong thread through those holes as in a drawstring pouch, gather the circle like a purse after putting whatever fluids, ointments or waters you want inside.
Then bind it to the instrument and manipulate it in the same way you did with the bladder, using your hand until moisture reaches the bladder.
Chapter Sixty.
In extracting the stone.
We have mentioned in the classification the types of stones and their treatment with medications, and I have explained the difference between a stone generated in the kidney and one formed in the bladder. I have also described the signs associated with each condition and the circumstances where manual manipulation or incision is required to treat such conditions.
It specifically refers to a stone formed in the bladder, particularly one that becomes lodged in the urethra. I will explain this condition with an illustrative description while maintaining brevity.
I state that a stone generated in the bladder is more prevalent among boys, and one sign of this condition is urine passing from the bladder with a consistency resembling water due to its thinness or lightness.
Sand-like particles may be visible, and the affected individual may experience an urge to manually stimulate the urethra due to irritation. They might also play with their genitals frequently, and there could be instances where it protrudes outward before eventually withdrawing back inside in many cases. The anal sphincter often becomes prominent alongside these symptoms in a significant number of patients. Boys tend to recover from this condition relatively easily until they reach the age of fourteen; however, it can be more challenging for older individuals, while young adults fall somewhere in between these two extremes.
Individuals with larger stones typically experience a simpler treatment process, whereas those with smaller ones often face greater challenges. When initiating treatment, it is essential to first administer an enema to the patient in order to eliminate all fecal matter from their intestines; this step is crucial as the presence of such material could obstruct our ability to examine for the stone during inspection.
The patient is then taken by the legs, shaken and jolted downwards to let the stone descend into the neck of the bladder or he may jump down from a height several times; then he should be made to sit upright between your hands with his hands under his thighs so that the whole bladder tilts downwards. Then inspect him.
Feel him from the outside; if you sense a stone in the space [of the bladder], immediately make an incision thereupon. If it does not come into contact with your touch at all, then rub the forefinger with grease from the left hand, if he is a boy or the middle finger...
If he is a full-grown boy, insert your finger into his anus and feel for the stone until it comes under your finger; then move it gradually towards the neck of the bladder. Then press on it with your finger and push it out towards the place where you want to make the incision.
And you should order a servant to press the bladder with his hand, and order another servant to stretch out his right hand above [the scrotum] while with his other hand he stretches the skin below the [scrotum], drawing it away from the place where the incision is to be made. Then take up your curved scalpel which looks like this:...
Make the incision between the anus and the scrotum, not in the middle but towards the left buttock; the incision should be made right over the stone, your finger should be inserted into the anus while you push it outwards at an angle so that the external opening of the incision is wide but on the inside narrow, as much as possible to allow for the passage of the stone.
Make it [the incision] not too wide, for if your finger in the anus presses on the stone during the incision, it might come out without difficulty. Note that there are some stones which have corners and edges, making them harder to pass; this is why.
Some of these are smooth like acorns and rounded, making it easy for them to come out; as for those with corners and edges, you should increase the incision a little. If they do not emerge this way, then you must devise strategies: either grasp them firmly with forceps that are well-adjusted, the tip of which is like a file.
He should keep hold of the stone so that it doesn't escape him; or, introduce a delicate instrument with a curved tip from below it. If you are unable to do this, then increase the size of the incision slightly. If any blood proves obstinate, cauterize it with alum.
If there is more than one, first push the largest towards the bladder's mouth and then make an incision on it; subsequently, push in the smaller ones. Do likewise if there are more than two. If it is very large, do not make a huge incision because this exposes the patient to one of two dangers.
Either he dies or there is constant dribbling of urine due to the fact that the wound never heals; but try to push it out, or devise ways to break it up with forceps so you can extract pieces.
When you have finished your work, fill the wound with costus, myrrh and cubeb; then apply a compress over it, moistened with oil or rosewater and cold water to ease any hot swelling. The patient should lie on his back, leaving the dressing undisturbed until the third day.
If it heals, wash the area with water and oil; subsequently treat it with balsam ointment and basilicum ointment until it is cured. If there is an excessive hot swelling or inflammation in the wound, for instance if blood clots inside the bladder and prevents urination – which can be ascertained by the presence of blood mixed with urine...
Insert your finger into the wound and extract that blood, for if it remains, it will lead to the corruption and infection of the bladder. Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt; match each type [of wound] with its corresponding treatment until it heals.
During the entire course of treatment, it is necessary to bind and gather the thighs together in order to secure the medicines that are applied to the affected area. If the stone is small and has reached the urethra, becoming lodged there such that urine cannot pass, then treat it with what I am about to describe before it comes to [the need for] incision.
This treatment has often rendered incision unnecessary; I have tried this myself, and it works. Take a forked instrument made of steel in the form shown below:
A three-pronged instrument, sharp at the tip and fixed to a handle. Then take a thread and bind it around the penis beneath the stone so that it does not retreat back into the bladder. Next, gently insert the forked steel instrument into the urethra until the prongs reach the same [stone].
Rotate the prongs with your hand around the stone, gradually seeking to puncture it until you penetrate [the stone] from the other side; for urine will then begin to flow immediately. Then grasp what remains of the stone outside the penis and squeeze; it will crumble into pieces and exit along with the urine, and the patient will be healed.
If this treatment is not feasible for you due to some obstacle, then bind a thread below the stone and another above it. Then make an incision into the penis at the same [spot] between the two threads; afterwards, extract the stone.
Afterwards, you undo the binding and clean any clotted blood that has formed in the wound. The thread is tied below the stone so that it does not retreat back into the bladder; the other is bound above for when the thread is untied after extraction of the stone, the skin will return to its place, covering the wound.
Therefore, when you tie the upper thread, you should lift the skin upwards so that it returns and covers the wound as we have said.
Chapter Sixty-One.
The Extraction of Stones in Women.
Stones rarely form in women, and if one should suffer from a stone, it is difficult to treat for many reasons. One reason is that the woman might be a virgin, and another is that you will not find a woman who allows herself to be examined by a doctor.
If she is chaste or from a forbidden degree of kinship, it becomes even more challenging due to several factors: the lack of skilled female practitioners in this field, especially those proficient in manual procedures; and the anatomical differences between men and women, which necessitate a deeper incision when operating on a woman.
In such cases, there is a certain degree of risk involved. If absolutely necessary, one should seek out a skilled female doctor, although they are rarely available. As an alternative, you could request the services of a chaste and gentle male physician or engage the assistance of a knowledgeable midwife who specializes in women's health, or even consult with a woman who has some basic understanding of this procedure.
You would then bring this woman and instruct her to perform all tasks as directed, beginning with a thorough examination to determine if the patient is a virgin. This involves inserting a finger into the patient's anus to search for the stone; if found, she should apply pressure to it with her finger.
If the patient is not a virgin, but rather a woman who has given birth (a 'thayb'), instruct the midwife to insert her finger into the patient's vagina and search for the stone after placing her left hand on the bladder and squeezing it gently.
If you find it, then you should insert the tube from the bladder's mouth downward to its full extent until you reach the root of the thigh. Then make an incision over it at the midpoint of the vulva, at the root of the thigh on whichever side is most suitable. Feel for the stone in that area.
Keep your finger pressing against the stone, and do not let it move from underneath. Let the incision be small at first; then introduce the sound into this little cut. When you feel the stone with the sound, make a bigger cut according to what you judge is necessary for the stone's exit. Know that stones come in many varieties.
Some stones are small and others large, some smooth and others rough; they may be long or round and have many different shapes. Know the different varieties so that you can judge what is needed. If blood becomes a problem, sprinkle powdered styptic into the wound and let it sit for an hour until bleeding stops. Then return to your work.
Continue until the stone is out, and remember to have ready all the instruments mentioned for dealing with stones in men so that you can make use of them as necessary. If bleeding becomes overwhelming and you find it is coming from a severed artery, sprinkle styptic powder onto the spot.
Bind it tightly with bandages and leave it, do not touch it again or try to remove the stone; the patient may die from this. Then treat the wound, but if bleeding continues for days and turns septic then return to your work of removing the stone.
Chapter Sixty-Two.
On incising the water cyst.
Hydrocele is the accumulation of moisture in the white membrane situated under the skin of the scrotum surrounding the testis, known as the scrotum. It may also occur in a particular membrane prepared by nature on one side of the testicle.
So that it is mistaken for another testis, and occurs between the scrotum's skin and the white membrane we mentioned previously. This does not happen often; this hydrocele develops due to a weakness in the spermatic cord, leading to the accumulation of this substance, which may also occur after a blow to the testes.
This moisture can have many colors; it may be yellowish, bloody red, dark green, or watery white, which is the most common type. These are the signs that help identify it.
If the accumulation of water is in the white membrane as mentioned, then the swelling will be round and slightly elongated like an egg shape, with the testis not visible as moisture surrounds it on all sides.
If the moisture is in its own particular membrane, then the swelling will be round on one side of the testis.
Due to this, a person may mistake it for another testis. If the moisture is between the scrotum's skin and white membrane, then the swelling will be under the testis. To determine the color of the moisture, use the square-shaped probe as illustrated previously; whatever color appears on the probe determines the nature of the moisture.
When treating with cauterization, the patient should be instructed to undergo venesection if possible and if their body allows it; they should then lie on their back on a slightly elevated surface with several cloths placed beneath them, while you sit on their left side.
Instruct a servant to sit on his right, stretching his penis towards one side of the scrotum and toward the lower abdomen. Then take up a wide knife and make an incision in the scrotal skin from the middle downward close to the pubic area.
The incision is made parallel to the line dividing the scrotal skin in two, extending all the way down to the white membrane covering it. You then peel back this membrane and take care not to cut into it; instead, focus on peeling away from the side that adheres more closely to the testicle, being as thorough as you can.
You then thoroughly separate the membrane filled with fluid, extracting all of its contents. Next, you use forceps to spread open the lips of the incision and pull back the membrane without disturbing the scrotal skin covering it. Finally, you proceed to cut through this membrane, doing so either in one clean motion or cutting it into several pieces.
Pay particular attention to the thinner side, as if you do not cut it thoroughly, there is a risk of fluid re-accumulating. Should the testicle emerge from its covering during your work, simply return it and then proceed to stitch together the scrotal skin.
Treat the wound as you would any other injury, allowing it to heal. However, if the testicle has become damaged due to some other illness, you must first tie off the vessels in the spermatic cord to prevent bleeding before cutting away the entire scrotum and extracting the testicle. Following this, treat the patient as previously described.
If the fluid has accumulated in both, indicating two hydroceles are present, repeat the process on the other side as you did with the first. Aim to perform the procedure identically if possible. Once complete, wipe away any residual blood.
You enter the incisions with cotton that has been soaked in oil or rosewater, and from the outside another piece of cotton which was soaked in wine and oil is placed on top. Then you lay out cloths folded over each other; these are the dressings, on top of the testicles and abdominal flanks. And you bind it from above with a bandage that has six ends, as shown in the figure: [Figure goes here].
Then two cloths are taken, sewn together and stuffed with fluffed cotton, like so. The ends that are tied are made of either damp cotton or wool, gathered tightly at the trousers' waistband, one end being placed on the buttocks towards the back.
The second end is directed towards the pubic area, with the other two ends being on the lower thighs and the remaining two ends are placed over the groins. All tension is gathered at the trousers' waistband. These dressings can also be made by cauterization instead of incisions using an iron.
This is done by taking a smooth, double-edged iron and making an incision with it while it's hot, as described before, until the white serosa containing the fluid is exposed. Then take another iron of this shape: [Iron shape goes here].
It resembles the Greek letter Epsilon, and with it you cauterize that serosa while still hot until all fluid has been drained out. Then you stretch the serosa with hooks and peel off the layer containing the sac using an iron; cut as much as possible to remove all of it, being careful not to let fire touch the testicles themselves.
Be aware that this method is safer and less likely to cause bleeding, and superior to the incision method. If you encounter a hot swelling or blood flow during either the incisions or cauterization, or any other issue, it should be treated with the appropriate treatment as described previously.
If the patient is a coward and cannot bear this procedure due to its hideousness, then let him use an instrument called the 'batt' as I shall describe it.
Since the abscess is watery, you should make the patient sit on a high chair and slice the base of the swelling with a broad lancet. Place the 'batt' along the body, making sure that the incision is wide enough for all the water to drain out. Then cover the area with cotton wool and bind it.
Allow it to drain the remaining water, then treat the wound until it heals. If the water does not flow out when you are performing this procedure and instead gathers at the mouth of the incision, this is due to the white membrane obstructing the opening and preventing the water from flowing.
In that case, you should insert a goose feather or the instrument used to extract water from melons (as previously illustrated) into the wound, or widen the incision slightly.
Be aware that water may return and accumulate again after around six months, in which case you should lance it in the same manner as before, and the patient's condition will improve over time.
Chapter sixty-three.
On incising fleshy abscesses and their treatment.
Be aware that incising these abscesses is a dangerous procedure that can lead to death in many cases, and so we advise against it for the patient's safety. Nonetheless, I shall describe this operation along with the various types of swelling.
There are many swellings that can occur in the testicles, arising from numerous causes such as excess heat or a blow to the area. The colour of these swellings will match that of the body, and they do not contain water.
The tumor is hard and perhaps stony, its color like soot, with no sensation. It may be due to the hardening of arteries and their swelling as mentioned before or to the dilation of veins; that which is due to the swelling of arteries becomes known by disappearance of swelling.
When pressed with your fingers, it should not yield at all; as for the one that results from the dilation of veins, nothing will disappear when you press it with your fingers. This type may prove more difficult to treat than other types of tissue.
This is done by incising the scrotal skin, then stretching the testicle upwards and removing it from under the white membrane, freeing the spermatic cord from vessels, tying them off, and cutting the cord after detaching it on all sides of the testicle; if the testicle has adhered to that overgrown tissue.
You must remove the testicle and cut it out, and if there is adhesion between any of the membranes or vessels, you should separate all such adhesions and cut them in a circular fashion.
If the overgrown tissue is in the place of adhesion behind, you must cut all of it and remove the testicle as we said before; then when your work is done, pack the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and wine, and treat it with other remedies until it heals.
Chapter 64.
On the treatment of hydrocele with inguinal hernia.
Inguinal hernia is a twisted tumor with some twisting, similar to a bunch of grapes, accompanied by relaxation of the scrotum and difficulty for the patient in movement, exercise, and walking; this affliction can be treated similarly to what was previously mentioned.
However, we should mention the procedure as performed by our predecessors. I say that you should make the patient sit on a high chair and then push the testicles downwards while holding the scrotum with your fingers together with the vessels close to the penis.
The assistant should grasp and stretch it firmly, then you make a slanting incision with a sharp wide knife next to the vessels until they are exposed, after which you remove them from each side as previously mentioned in the case of arteries found in gums; finally, suture them with a needle having doubled thread.
You tie it to the first place where you displayed the vine leaf and also at its end, then make a vertical incision in the middle along the body's length and remove any impure foul humours collected there.
Next, you treat the wound like any other surgery to prevent suppuration for a period until the vessels nourishing one testicle atrophy; this is acceptable. Should the vine leaf expose all vessels, it would be necessary to excise one testicle with its vessels lest nourishment to the semen be lost. Before cutting the vessels, it wilts so that it is useless.
Chapter 65.
Treatment of venous varicose veins.
These varicose veins occur due to an incision made in the peritoneum extending over the abdomen towards the groins at the sides of the abdomen, causing the intestine to herniate from that rupture onto one testicle.
This hernia may result from either an incision in the peritoneum or its extension, and these two types occur due to numerous reasons such as a blow, jump, shout, lifting heavy objects etc., and if caused by stretching of the peritoneum it appears gradually over an extended period.
It does not occur suddenly, and the swelling remains level with the depth before the peritoneum squeezes the intestine; its sign is that if it comes from a tear in the peritoneum, there will be great pain right away, and a variable lump will appear just under the skin nearby.
This is caused by the protrusion of the intestine and its position outside the peritoneum, sometimes with omentum as well; such a hernia is then both intestinal and omental. It may also occur with wind, or the feces can pass through the intestines and become trapped there, which would be fatal for the patient.
As it causes severe pain and rumbling, especially if compressed, treating this condition with iron is dangerous; you must be careful to avoid doing so. The treatment procedure is as follows: instruct the patient to push the intestines back inside their abdomen by hand if possible.
Then the patient should lie on their back, with you at their side; lift his legs up and pull down the skin that covers the groin until it is stretched out as far as possible, then cut along the entire length of the scrotum before using hooks to open the wound.
The wound should be opened up as far as is necessary for the testicle to pass through, then peel away any peritoneum that lies beneath the scrotal skin until you reach the white, tough membrane on either side; at this point insert your index finger behind the testicle.
Insert it between the white peritoneum that lies beneath the testicular skin and a second layer of peritoneum, releasing any adhesions behind the testicle; using your right hand push this inside the scrotal sac while stretching out the white membrane above with your left, then lift up both the testicle and its peritoneum towards the wound.
Instruct the servant to stretch the egg upwards, and you should release the adhesion from behind with a complete release. Then examine carefully with your finger to ensure there is no part of the twisted intestine in the tough white membrane; if you find any, push it downwards into the abdomen.
Take a needle with thick thread, which has been twisted from ten threads, and insert it at the end of the membrane that is under the scrotal skin next to the incision. Then cut the loop's ends so there are four threads. Overlap them in a rigid formation and tie the membrane, which we said was under the scrotal skin, tightly on both sides. Also wrap and tie the thread ends securely so that none of the vessels supplying it can be reached. To prevent any hot swelling from occurring, and to also create a second ligature outside the first one at a distance of less than two fingers away, leaving behind some of the membrane under the scrotal skin equivalent in length to a finger's width.
To prevent any hot swelling from occurring, and to also create a second ligature outside the first one at a distance of less than two fingers away, leaving behind some of the membrane under the scrotal skin equivalent in length to a finger's width. Cut away all that remains circumferentially, taking the egg with it; then make an incision below the scrotal skin to drain blood and pus as previously described. Use oil-soaked wool in the wound and apply the ligature we have described.
The tough white membrane we spoke of, after being cut carefully to avoid blood loss - which often occurs - can be cauterized. Leave the ligature until it falls off on its own; if this takes too long, moisten it with hot water and apply something that induces sweating until it comes off.
You then treat the wound with all the usual treatments for wounds until it heals.
Chapter 66.
In this treatment for rheumatism, I have not seen anyone daring enough to treat it with iron. The ancients mentioned that it should be done as described in the treatment for gangrene at the root of a grapevine: the vessels are tied off after being carefully opened below.
Then you open it up in the middle and treat the swelling with whatever opens it until the vessels fall out, then treating the wound as we mentioned until it heals.
Chapter 67.
On the hernia that is in the groin.
A hernia in the groin may occur, as we said before, with the protruding part remaining above the scrotum and nothing descending from the intestines, or if something does descend it is minimal and can be pushed back up at any time.
But if left untreated for too long, the hole in the peritoneum increases in size until part of the intestine and omentum descend into the scrotum. This happens due to the stretching of the peritoneum that is present in the groin as mentioned before. This is because the peritoneum stretches, then relaxes, causing a protrusion and swelling of the area. The treatment for this is cauterization as previously described.
It may also be treated with iron in the following manner: have the patient lie on their back between your hands, then cut across the swollen hernia three fingers wide and separate the peritoneum below the skin.
Until the white peritoneum that follows is exposed, you take a probe and place it on the protruding site of the peritoneum, pressing it into the depth of the abdomen. Then you suture the two protruding sites at the end of the probe with the peritoneum, adhering one to the other with the sutures.
Then you remove the end of the probe, but do not cut the peritoneum at all nor touch the testicle or anything else, as I have already instructed you in the treatment of intestinal hernia. Thereafter, you treat it with the treatment for surgical conditions.
If the sutures break, you clean them and dress the wound until it heals. The peritoneum contracts and does not increase the size of the hernia.
Cauterization is better in this location because it is closer to the safe area.
Chapter 68.
On the relaxation of the scrotal skin.
The skin of the scrotum often relaxes in some people without the flesh inside relaxing, and it is unsightly. Therefore, one who wishes to treat this should put the patient to sleep on their back.
All the skin that has relaxed is cut off, leaving only the thick skin behind. Then you bring together both lips of the scrotum; if you wish to suture first, do so with three or four sutures and ensure a tight seal before cutting between them.
Then you treat it with standard surgical procedures until it heals, at which point the sutures fall out.
Chapter 69.
On Castration.
Castration is forbidden in our religion.
Therefore, I should not have mentioned it in this book of mine; however, I did so for two reasons: first, to ensure that the doctor is aware of it if asked and knows how to treat such cases; second, we often need to castrate some animals for our benefit.
Such as lambs, male goats and cats; thus I say castration can be performed in two ways: by crushing or by incision and cutting. In the first method of crushing, one should immerse the animal in hot water until its genitals relax, soften and droop.
Then crush its testicles by hand until they dissolve and cannot be felt anymore. As for castration by incision, one should hold the animal and squeeze the scrotum with their left hand, then tie up the spermatic cords and make a single cut over each testicle.
When the testicles protrude, cut them off after removing their coverings and leave only the thin tunica vaginalis over the vessels intact. This method of castration is better than the one involving crushing.
Because crushing may leave some of the testes behind, causing the animal to retain its sexual desire and want to mate; then one should treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter Seventy.
On the Treatment of Hermaphrodites.
There are two types of hermaphrodites among men: the first is when a shape resembling a female genitalia appears under the scrotum or on the skin of the testicles, complete with hair; sometimes urine may flow from this area.
In women, there is one type [of hypospadias], located above the vulva on the pubic bone, similar to small male genitalia, protruding outside with one resembling a penis and both are like female genitals; treatment for the three types.
The two types in men and one type in women: those excess tissues should be cut off so that their effect is removed, then treat it with the treatment of other surgeries until they heal; as for the second type in men where urine exits from within the scrotal skin there is no action to take nor will it ever heal.
Chapter seventy-one.
On excision of the clitoris and labia from women's vulvas.
The clitoris may increase in size beyond what is normal until it is unsightly and its appearance becomes ugly; in some women, it can become enlarged like that of men's and be used for intercourse.
You should grasp the excess of the clitoris with your hand or a hook and cut it off, but do not cut too deeply, especially into its origin, lest you cause bleeding.
Then treat it with the treatment of wounds until it heals; as for fleshy growth, this is flesh that grows in the mouth of the womb until it fills it.
And it may exit to the outside like a tail. For this reason, some of the ancients call it tail disease; you should cut it as you would cut a clitoris and treat it until it heals.
Chapter seventy-two.
On treating obstructions.
Obstructions can occur when a woman's vagina is not perforated or the perforation is small, either naturally at birth or as an acquired condition. This latter type results from a prior illness and may be due to an excessive growth of flesh.
A thin or thick membrane, situated either deep in the uterus, along its sides, at the top, or at the bottom can obstruct intercourse and pregnancy, as well as childbirth; it may even prevent menstruation. The midwife identifies this condition by visual inspection.
If the obstruction is visible and nearby, but not so if it's hidden, then examine it with your fingers or a probe. If the membrane is thin and close to the labia, you should proceed by making an incision; place protections over the labia and use both thumbs for this purpose.
With the woman lying on her back, legs spread apart, stretch open the labia with force to perforate the thin membrane and open up the obstruction; then take some wool soaked in oil and place it at the location of the incision. The woman should have intercourse daily to avoid a reunion of the tissue.
Should the membrane be thick and dense, you ought to incise it with a broad scalpel resembling an Asian fig leaf; if instead, it is caused by overgrown flesh, then suspend this tissue using hooks and cut it off. Ensure that you have medications on hand to stem bleeding without cauterization such as senna pods, gallnuts and frankincense combined in egg whites.
Afterwards, use a wide lead pipe to prevent the wound from healing too quickly; hold it in place for several days and employ a wick of dried linen thread. Treat with other medications that promote healing until the wound is fully closed. Other types of flesh growths may develop within the uterus which should be treated in an analogous manner.
Unless it is a cancerous tumor, one should never operate on a uterine carcinoma with an iron instrument.
Chapter Seventy-Three
On the treatment of hemorrhoids, warts, and red blisters that occur in women's genitalia.
Hemorrhoids are caused by the swelling of the veins, leading to continuous and excessive bleeding. When hemorrhoids progress, they become warts, which I have classified into types based on their characteristics.
Hemorrhoids and warts that are deep inside the uterus, beyond physical sensation, cannot be treated with metal instruments. However, those that occur at the opening of the uterus can be treated.
The woman should be placed in a cold room, and then the warts should be scraped with an iron instrument or rough cloth, cutting them off from their base. Then, to stop any bleeding, apply a styptic.
Such as alum, tartar, frankincense, and the like. Then her legs should be raised against a wall for an hour before being lowered into cold water. If bleeding persists, have her sit in a decoction of sumac, pomegranate rind, gallnut, and similar substances. Then take barley flour, knead it with honey and vinegar.
Apply this to her back. If the bleeding stops, you can cease treatment; if it continues, then apply cups to her spine and breasts without making incisions. Then take a woolen swab, dip it in juice of nettle or juice of plantain or juice of blackberry branches with a gallnut infusion, and apply it to the affected area.
If the swelling subsides, treat the area with ointment until it heals. As for the red blister, it resembles the heads of thorns and has a rough appearance; therefore, you should cut away what is visible from it as mentioned for warts, equally, and treat it until it heals.
Chapter 74.
Regarding suppuration that occurs in the womb.
There are many types of tumours that can occur in the womb, such as cancer, calcified tumour, ulcers, abscesses, gangrene, fistulas, haemorrhoids, fissures, warts and hot tumours. I have already mentioned all these diseases, their types and signs in the relevant section.
We should mention in this article the hot tumour that occurs in the womb, especially if it is one of those tumours that persists over time. How should its treatment with iron be carried out? You must examine whether the pain of the tumour at its onset is sharp, accompanied by throbbing, inflammation and fever.
If you see that it is red and sensitive to touch, do not rush its treatment with iron, but treat it with what will aid maturation. Once these symptoms subside, the woman should then sit on a chair with two arms and lean her back against them.
Bring her legs together towards the lower abdomen, with her thighs spread apart, and place her arms under her knees; then tie them with a suitable bandage.
The midwife should then sit at the woman's right side and use the instrument for opening the womb's mouth, which will be illustrated later. When using this instrument, you must estimate with a probe the depth of the woman's womb so as not to insert more of the instrument than the depth of the womb.
If the instrument causes pain to the patient, and if it is deeper than necessary, then some pads should be placed on the cervix to prevent the entire instrument from entering the uterus deeply. The spiral which runs along the instrument should be at its upper end.
While holding the instrument, your assistant should turn the spiral to open up the cervix of the uterus. If the abscess appears and it is soft when touched by hand then you should make an incision at its head with a wide lancet. When all the purulent discharge has come out.
You should introduce into the wound a soft wick soaked in rose oil or green liniment with some styptic properties. The end of the wick will be left outside of the incision on the cervix of the uterus and a piece of pure wool, also soaked in water that has been boiled with baker's yeast, is placed over the uterus and pubic region.
Then you will treat it after two days with the appropriate ointment until complete healing is achieved.
You may also wash the uterus and wound by injecting into it a mixture of water with honey, then another injection is made using water that has been boiled with liquorice root or long bugle. Afterwards, you will return to applying ointment; this procedure should be performed if the abscess is hidden within the uterus.
One should avoid treating it with iron, but rather one should treat it as previously mentioned in this section.
Chapter 75.
On the treatment of midwives regarding how they should care for live infants born with abnormal shapes.
The midwife should first be aware of the normal delivery process and its signs: if you see that the woman's bearing down, eager to take a deep breath, and finds some relief from what she is experiencing during childbirth.
It hastens the baby's exit, so know that this birth is in a natural manner and its exit is on its head with the placenta along or hanging from its navel, so when you see these signs then you should squeeze her belly to make the baby come out quickly.
If it comes down on its head, the placenta will come with it and cleanses from those impurities in a good manner, apart from this birth is unnatural and blameworthy because the baby can exit on its legs and bring out its hands before its head and legs.
Its one hand or leg comes out, or its head and a hand come out together, or it exits folded up, maybe even turned on its back and such shapes are blameworthy; the midwife should be skilled in all these things and should avoid any mistakes.
I have explained every shape and the required skill for each to help you understand it; when a baby exits in its natural way, on its head but gets stuck, and labor pains become difficult for the woman with her strength weakening; seat her on a chair and instruct women to hold her steady.
Compress her womb with cooked fenugreek and moist ointments, then the midwife inserts a small scalpel between her fingers to cut through the placenta or cuts it with her nail so that its moisture drains out; squeeze the woman's belly until the baby comes down.
If it doesn't come down, then you should inject the woman with fenugreek saliva mixed with linseed oil and after the injection tell her to roll over; make her sneeze with musk holding her mouth and nose tight so that the baby comes out immediately; if first its hands exit then they must be pushed back gently little by little.
If entry is not possible, place the woman on a pulpit and raise her legs upwards, then shake the pulpit against the ground with the woman holding herself steady to prevent falling during this shaking. If the hands do not enter (the birth canal) and the fetus dies, cut off both hands and extract the remaining parts of the fetus.
Or, tie his hands with a cloth and pull them gently; this will lead to the fetus being delivered. If the fetus emerges on its legs then you should push these upwards, before gradually rotating it until it is level, following which you can take one of its legs stretching this out little by little.
If the legs emerge at the hips, ask her to push and sniff musk perfume, for this will cause it to be delivered. If it is not discharged following our description above then turn the fetus little by little until you return it to its natural shape; it should come out smoothly now. Should all that we have described fail...
Take some saliva of the lizard, combined with oil of marjoram and linseed oil as well as gum dissolved in water; pound all these together very thoroughly before applying it to the woman's genitals and lower abdomen. Then seat her in a pool of tepid water up to her nipples.
If you see that her abdomen has softened then prepare a pessary of Myrrh, which she should hold for an hour; if it is retained over this period seat her on the chair before again sniffing musk perfume and plugging up both mouth and nostrils while squeezing her lower abdomen gently: the fetus will exit rapidly. If the fetus emerges on its knees and hands...
If it comes out in this manner then take hold of its hands, inserting these little by little; the woman should then lie on her back with her legs lowered while she lies supine upon a bed bringing both hands together before you gently squeeze over her abdomen. Then remove the pillows beneath her feet so that she is lowered, and if the infant does not come out then take both of her legs and move them vigorously, after which squeeze above the symphysis a little at a time until the baby rises up; then the midwife can insert her hand to help the birth along in small degrees.
Instruct the woman to roll over so that the baby may be delivered; when the infant emerges with one arm raised above its head, help it back into position by guiding its hand behind its neck. If you cannot manage this then have the woman stand and walk about for a while, failing which she should lie down again on her side.
Place her back on the bed and shake her legs vigorously before applying the ointment derived from saliva that I described earlier; should labour commence, have her sit down on a chair after which you may attempt to guide its hand and bring the infant into position as is natural for childbirth. You must also sneeze in the woman's face and instruct her to roll over so that she might give birth.
Should the infant emerge on its back with arms outstretched and facing away from its mother, the midwife must grasp one of its hands before gently twisting it around until it is in a better position for delivery; once this has been achieved, carry on as we have previously described using oil mixed with saliva.
Then, tell her to move a little at a time until she has managed it; seat her on the chair and have her lean towards her right side before telling her to roll over once more while you sneeze kohl into her face as this will cause the baby to emerge; when it comes out standing upright on one side.
If it reaches the mouth of the womb in this position along with its afterbirth then make a slit in said afterbirth using your fingernail to release any fluid that remains; if there is any still attached to the infant's face and neck, sever it from its navel so as not to choke it into death before pushing the child back inside until everything is in order.
Instruct the woman to push multiple times, for it facilitates an easy delivery of twins or many fetuses. Know that twins are often born and even three or four may be delivered, surviving in rarity; five is something unnatural, they never live at all.
Surrounding them, even if numerous, is a single placenta; they are separated by a membrane barrier between each, attached to the navel of every one. And it may be delivered as with a single fetus, an easy and natural birth or else an abominable delivery as described above.
Should any of the fetuses become difficult during birth and assume unnatural shapes, treat as described above. Let the midwife be gentle, acting with care and patience; she must employ every trick at her disposal to ensure a safe delivery in each situation.
An embryo may be conceived in the womb, one or two or three or four; even five, six and seven are possible, as well as ten or more. It has been said to me that a woman miscarried seven fetuses while another lost fifteen, all having been conceived together.
As decreed by the All-Mighty and All-Knowing, all that has been described ought to be in a midwife's knowledge; for it is possible such situations may one day arise, thus she must be prepared as necessary.
Chapter 76.
On the extraction of a dead fetus.
If you have treated the dead fetus as mentioned previously, but it does not come out and your only option is to proceed manually, then observe this: if the woman is strong and without any symptoms that may cause her harm, she must lie down on a bed on her back.
Its head should be tilted downward and its legs raised, with a servant holding it on both sides or it can be tied to the bed so that her body does not pull away during the extraction of the fetus.
Then the mouth of her womb is moistened with slippery ointments, made from the saliva of camel's snout, fenugreek and flax seeds. Then the midwife anoints her hand with these ointments and introduces it gently into the womb seeking a place to insert the hooks in the fetus, at suitable spots.
If you see that the fetus is about to descend head first, insert the hooks in its eyes or at the back of its neck, or in its mouth, jaw, under the chin, shoulder blades, near the ribs, or underneath its breastbone.
But if it is about to descend feet first, insert the hooks at the pubic region and middle ribs. The hook should be held by the right hand with its curve nestled between the fingers of your left hand; you then introduce it gently into one of those spots we mentioned earlier.
You continue to advance until you reach a vacant spot, then insert another hook opposite the first or even a third if needed so that pulling is equal and not biased towards one side; when extracting, do it in a smooth movement but with some rocking motion from side to side.
Just as it is done with a molar when extracting, you should keep the pulling steady; if one side gets stuck, the midwife should anoint her fingers and introduce them from that direction in order to turn whatever got stuck; once part of the fetus has come out, transfer the hooks to other spots.
It is a little thinner, do this until the entire fetus emerges; if one hand comes out before the other and cannot be pushed back due to compression, it should be wrapped with a cloth then pulled until when all of it has come out, cut it.
Either at the wrist joint or at the elbow, and thus you should do with the other hand and legs; if the fetus's head is large and there is pressure in coming out, or if there is water accumulated in its head, then you must insert a sharp probe between the fingers.
With it, you split the head and water comes out; or you crush it with an instrument called a 'mushdad', which is pictured alongside other instruments in the chapter following this one.
This is what you do when the fetus has a naturally large head; you must split open or crush its skull with the 'mushdad', as we have said, and then extract the bones with forceps. If the head comes out but gets compressed at the collarbone, it should be opened up so that the moisture in the chest can drain away.
In such a case, the chest will close up; but if it does not close and the body cannot be delivered whole, then cut it into pieces as best you can. If the lower belly is protruding or there is dropsy in it, an incision must be made so that moisture drains out.
If the fetus is in a position where its legs are leading, it will be easy to pull and present at the mouth of the womb; but if compression occurs at the belly or chest, you must pull with a cloth wrapped around your hand and split open the belly or chest so that their contents may drain out.
If all the other parts are removed and only the head remains inside, then the midwife should insert her left hand. If the cervix is open, she should reach in with her hand to grasp the head, pulling it towards the mouth of the uterus with her fingers. Then, she should introduce a hook or two into the uterine cavity and use them to pull out the head.
If the cervix has closed due to hot inflammation, then it should not be forced open. Instead, moist and oily substances should be applied topically, along with poultices. The woman should also sit in warm water that relaxes and softens the tissues.
If the fetus is lying on its side, and it can be repositioned to a normal position, then the methods described earlier for live fetuses should be employed. However, if this cannot be done, then the fetus must be cut into pieces and removed. It is important that no part of the placenta remains inside. Once you have completed your treatment, follow the instructions mentioned earlier for treating hot inflammation in the uterus.
If there is any bleeding, the woman should be immersed in astringent water and all other treatment methods should be applied. I have witnessed a case where a woman became pregnant while still carrying a dead fetus within her womb, which had remained undelivered after its death during an earlier pregnancy.
Then, the second fetus also died and remained undelivered within her for a long time until an ulcer developed at the site of the womb's orifice, becoming swollen to the point where it ruptured and began discharging pus. I was called upon to treat this condition, which required prolonged treatment over many months without any signs of healing. Finally, I applied one of the strongest astringent ointments available, which succeeded in drawing out all the matter from the ulcer.
A bone was expelled from the orifice, which surprised me greatly since bones do not normally develop within the abdomen. I concluded that these must have been the remains of a dead fetus and proceeded to thoroughly examine the wound, extracting many fragments of bone belonging to the skull of this fetus.
I have not ceased to follow that until I removed a lot of bones from it, and the woman is in her best condition. She has lived like this for some time with just a little pus coming out of the wound, and so I bring you this rare case here.
Because it contains knowledge and assistance for what the practicing physician attempts with his hands in treatment.
Chapter Seventy-Seven.
In it there are illustrations of the tools required to extract the fetus.
Illustration of a spiral used to open the mouth of the womb.
This book press, which is the same as those used to bind books, also has two spirals at each end of the wooden bars; however, this spiral should be more delicate than that of the book press and should either be made from ebony or boxwood. Each wooden bar should have a diameter equal to that of two fingers.
And the ends of each bar are curved like a finger; their length is one and half spans, while in the middle of both wooden bars there are two pegs made from the same wood as the bars with lengths slightly more than half a span and widths also slightly over that of two fingers: these are the pegs.
These are the two pegs that should be inserted into the mouth of the womb in order to open it when you rotate both spirals. Illustration of another tool for this same purpose, but which is more delicate and lighter.
It should be made from ebony or boxwood and fashioned like a set of tongs, although at the end it has two pegs as you can see; each peg is around one span in length and two fingers wide. If you wish to open the womb with these then...
Place the woman on a bed, with her legs suspended and parted between her thighs. Then insert these two probes, clasped together, into the mouth of the womb while holding the instrument's handle below, between her thighs. Thereafter, open your hand with the instrument as you would with forceps, equally on either side to the extent that you wish to dilate the womb. In order for the midwife to do what is required, here is an image of another spiral that was mentioned by our predecessors:
An image of the cannon which propels the foetus:
An image of the forceps used to crush the head of the foetus:
It resembles scissors with teeth at the end, as you can see. It may also be made rectangular like forceps, as depicted here. You will notice its teeth are like those of a saw, used for cutting and tearing.
Another image of the cannon:
An image of the hook:
This hook is slightly thicker to prevent it from breaking when used to extract the foetus. Here is an image of a two-pronged hook:
An image of a pair of large scalpels for cutting the foetus:
The more varieties of these instruments that are prepared by the manufacturer, the faster and higher-quality the work will be, thus earning greater respect from others for one's capabilities. Therefore, do not consider any instrument too insignificant to have on hand, as it may well prove necessary.

On the extraction of the placenta.
If the placenta is retained after childbirth, you should instruct the patient to hold her breath and then make her sneeze with incense; press your hand over her mouth and nostrils. If it comes out by doing this, otherwise take a bowl.
And make a hole in the lid and place inside it herbs that open the mouth of the womb, such as fennel, wormwood, dill, chamomile, sage, ground ivy, and centaury; any or all of these medicines. Soak them with water and set this over fire; then place a silver tube onto the hole in the lid of the bowl, with its other end inside the mouth of the womb.
Hold this until the steam reaches the bottom of the womb, and then make her sneeze as we have said; the placenta will come out quickly. If it still remains after this treatment and does not come out, instruct the midwife to dip her left hand in sesame oil or slobberwort saliva.
Then she should insert her hand into the vagina and search for the placenta; if she finds it, grasp it and pull it out slowly. If it is stuck deep inside the womb, then insert your hand as described earlier until you find the placenta; gently tug on it little by little to remove it.
To avoid tearing the womb during extraction, it should be gently rocked from side to side before increasing the pulling force; this will help free it from any adhesions. If the mouth of the womb is closed, we have described treatments involving sneezing, the bowl method, and herbs.
If it does not come out despite all these methods, do not be violent with her and pull forcefully; instead, tie what has emerged back to the mouth of the womb and then onto the woman's thigh. Afterward, inject her with the quadruple ointment as this will cause it to rot within a few days.
It dissolves and comes out, but if it gets infected then a foul smell rises to the stomach and head causing discomfort; therefore, suitable millet should be used.
Hence, some ancients experimented with millet of barley and dried figs. Illustration: The device which a woman uses to inhale vapors when menses or placenta is retained.
It is made of lead resembling a funnel or it can be made of copper, the narrow end is placed in the vagina while the wide end rests on fire and incense put on hot coals; she holds until all that incense burns out then replaces with more.

Treating fistula without perforation.
Many boys are born with their anus un-perforated, sealed by a thin membrane; the midwife should pierce this membrane with her finger otherwise she must cut it with a sharp scalpel taking care not to touch the muscle.
She should then place a pad soaked in wine and oil over it, treat with ointments until healed; if you fear that it may close again, insert a lead pipe into the hole for many days, remove when child needs to defecate.
Sometimes, the anus may become blocked due to a healed wound or tumor; it is necessary to cut this scar then treat as mentioned with ointments and cauterization.
Chapter 80.
Treating fistulas occurring in the lower part of the body.
The fistulae that occur below are a complication and thickening that happen near the anus, from outside or within the space on one of the sides, and there may be one or more fistula.
If this complication persists, it opens up and discharges a watery, white moisture or thin pus. Some of these fistulae may extend to the anus and intestines; those that do not can be identified by what emerges from them when the patient defecates: faeces and wind.
Worms may also emerge from them, and there are fistulae that arise when those in the space extend to the bladder and urethra; others extend to the hip joint and coccyx. The fistula extending to the anus can be identified in a similar manner to one not doing so.
Insert your index finger into the anus and a thin probe of copper or iron into the fistula; if there is no bend, but one is present, use a thin lead probe or horsehair instead.
Until you feel the probe or hair on your finger, and if nothing comes out of the hole at all - neither faeces nor wind nor worms, as we have said - then know it is not extending elsewhere and proceed with treatment.
If the fistula extends to the bladder or urethra, it is indicated by urine emerging from it and the failure of any medication to heal the site; if extending to the hip joint or coccyx, the probe will reach these places.
If there is no bending toward the bone, pain in that area, constant discharge of pus, failure to respond to any treatment or ointment, and no healing, then these extending fistulae will never be cured.
The treatment is a futile effort for those ignorant physicians who attempt to operate on it, but for the non-penetrating and non-chronic wound healing can be expected with the use of iron as I will describe and have experienced it: The patient lies down in front of you on their back.
You should raise his legs and bend his thighs towards the belly, then introduce a copper or lead sound until you know where it ends by feeling it with your patient's hand near the anus; if he feels it at the anus, you must introduce your index finger into the anus.
If you feel the sound passing into your finger, without feeling any peritoneum or flesh between them then be certain that it has perforated and there is no need to tire yourself over it as such a wound cannot heal as we have said.
They say that it can heal in rare cases and one treatment of benefit is to heat a thin iron according to the width of the fistula, as described before, then introduce it hot into the fistula up towards the anus two or three times.
Until you know that all the excess hardened flesh like a bird's feather tube has been burnt, then treat it with twisted wool soaked in lard until those burned tissues are removed; afterward use emollient ointments and healing can be expected.
If this is not the case and it does not pass into your finger in the anus but rather there is a thick curtain of flesh or peritoneum between them and you see that the fistula follows a course under the skin, then make an incision starting at its external opening. As you pass the incision with the probe while it is in the fistula until you reach with the incision where the end of the probe has reached, and the probe comes out and falls away, then clean those coagulated meats which resemble a bird's quill without leaving anything from them.
Then you treat it with emollient salves until it heals, but if the blood dominates and prevents you from carrying out your work of cutting those meats, then what is best for you to do and quickest in terms of benefit is cauterization by fire or a sharp medicine because cauterization with fire gathers together two good conditions: burning away that excess meat.
And cut off the blood and dry up the moistures, then treat it with wet bandages dipped in suet or sulfur powder mixed with oil until the wound suppurates and expels that burnt meat in the pus; then treat the wound at this point with emollient salves promoting hard flesh.
These are the medicines in which there is astringency and drying up, for when it has healed then it will have knitted together; do not stuff any packing into this fistula. If the fistula should reach deeply within the anus and be far from the surface of the body, then insert your finger inside the anus and grope about with it.
If you feel the probe and there is a membrane or meat between it, and it is close to emerging, then acting upon this fistula must be done in a way that is greedy and hopeful: that is, you should use one of three approaches either cauterize it as we have said.
Or you could incise it until you reach its bottom so that you can securely insert the bandages and treat from nearby; do not go too far with the incision lest you cut through the muscle surrounding the anus, resulting in loss of control over defecation for the patient, then treat as we mentioned; perhaps he will heal as said.
Either you pierce that membrane after cutting it close to the anus, as we said, either with a sound or with another sharp instrument, and then clean all those coagulated meats that are in the incision, as far as possible.
Then you suture the entire wound along with the incision and the upper orifice so that it is sealed, while keeping the fistula open inside the anus, which will be less burdensome for the patient; and sometimes the fistula may be punctured in this manner.
And that is, if you introduce the sound into the fistula and it comes out on the side of the anus towards the surface of the body along with the skin and the orifice of the anus, then take a sound perforated at the end like a cobbler's needle in this manner:
Then introduce into it a twisted thread made of five threads or so, then introduce the sound with the thread into the fistula until you reach its bottom; if it is perforated at the rim of the anus from within in its vicinity.
Then extract the thread through that hole by introducing your finger into the anus and pulling out the end of the thread; then gather both ends together, drawing them tight for a day or two days; each time the thread is cut in the meat, you tighten it well so that those meats between the two ends of the threads fall away; then treat the wound until it heals and recovers.
If the mouth of the fistula is not perforated, then perforate it as best you can, though it should not be too deep so that you do not cut through the muscle; then proceed with it as we have mentioned until it recovers.

Chapter 81.
On the treatment of haemorrhoids, their ligation and healing of anal fissures.
Haemorrhoids come in two forms, they can either be inside the anus like red blisters or similar to grapes with some being small and others large and bleeding constantly.
They can be singular or multiple, and they can occur outside the anus at its edges; however, those that are found on the exterior of the anus are usually less moist, with a yellowish discharge or slight continuous bleeding and their colour is similar to the skin.
The treatment for those that are found inside the anus is to have the patient defecate and evacuate their bowels until the anus emerges and the lesions become visible; then, you quickly attach them with hooks or grasp them with your fingernail before cutting at their base. If they do not hold together due to moisture and relaxation...
...scrape it with a rough cloth or a piece of coarse bread, or pull at it with your fingers and then cut it; afterwards, sprinkle some sharp powders on it to act as cauterization or treat it according to what has been previously mentioned in the chapter on cauterization.
Then treat it with the remaining treatments until it heals; if the anus does not come out, inject the patient with an enema containing a slight sting to wash out its contents and encourage quick evacuation when the patient defecates. As for those haemorrhoids that are external, they are easily managed.
It is to take it with your fingernail or hook it with a hook and cut it off, then treat it as we mentioned until it heals. For those who dislike cutting with iron, you should use this piercing method: Take some spun thread and insert it into a needle.
Then pull the wart upwards and pass the needle through its base from the other side. Wrap both ends of the thread under the needle, which should be held horizontally, pulling the thread tight around the wart's neck until it is removed. Then tie a knot in the thread and remove the needle. Do this for all warts except one, which you leave unpierced.
Let it drain its excess blood, then place on the anus a cloth soaked in rose oil or cypress tar and put it on the anus, instructing the patient to remain still. Leave them until the warts fall off; once they do, treat with ointments and other treatments until healed.
As for fissure treatment, it often arises from constipation and a dry temperament. If chronic and unresponsive to medication, you should excise it with a scalpel or your fingernail until it becomes moist and the upper layer of skin, which prevents healing, is removed.
Then treat it until it heals properly; if not, repeat the excision more vigorously than before so that it bleeds well and is peeled off. Then treat it again; it should heal.
Chapter 82.
On the treatment of inverted and non-inverted corns, hard warts, and moles.
The callus is a round nodule, the color of the body, resembling the head of a nail and can be found all over the body but especially on the soles of the feet and toes; it causes pain when walking.
The area around the callus should be cut open, then grasped with forceps or a hook and removed from its root; you should treat it accordingly, and if you wish to cauterize it, do so as previously explained in the appropriate section. As for dry warts, they are small hard bumps that feel rough like a knot, round on top of the body's surface.
They often appear on the hands of boys, and to treat them you should pull or cut off the warts, or pierce it with a silk thread or hair until it falls off; if you wish, you can cauterize it as previously mentioned, either with fire or sharp medicine.
You can also remove inverted and non-inverted warts with the same instrument I mentioned for treating corns; as for corns, they are small rough nodules on the body's surface that go very deep, and if exposed to cold, they feel like being stung by ants.
They can occur anywhere on the body, but are most common on the hands; to treat them you should take a tube made from goose quill or strong eagle feathers and fit it over the corn so that it surrounds it completely, then rotate your hand holding the tube until what's around the corn is cut open.
You should insert the tube deep into the flesh, then remove the corn from its root; if you wish, you can do this with a copper or iron pipe in the same manner:
Make the top of the tube solid and tightly twisted so that it can be easily manipulated and twisted by the fingers; if you wish, cauterize the mole as explained in the section on wart cauterization in the chapter on cauterization.

Pictures of instruments used for injections in cases of piles, diarrhea, and colic.
The syringe can be made of silver, porcelain, or hollow or solid brass, and this instrument can be made in small and large sizes depending on who will use it. So those which are used to treat small boys will be small, and for those with narrow or painful anuses their syringes will be very gentle. Picture of a large syringe:
Its upper funnel, to which the bladder is attached, is wide like this; it has a barrier where the bladder is tied as you can see, and its lower end, which is inserted into the anus, is very smooth and solid with two holes on one side and one hole on the other.
The size of the hole should be as thick as a rod or slightly thicker, and the bladder in which you put the medicines can be made from an animal's bladder or sheep gut; it is shaped like a small pillow and its diameter is one palm-width.
It is pierced with many holes in a spiral pattern and the distance between each hole should be one finger's width; then pass through those holes a strong thread of ten-ply yarn or similar, and gather up the bladder like a pillow. When you have put the medicine inside, tie off the head of the syringe tightly between two stones and then inject with it. This is a picture of the circle of the bladder and holes:
And the method of clyster treatment is to fill the rectum or bladder with medicine, which has been heated to a temperature that the patient can tolerate. Take care not to make it very hot or very cold. Then have the patient lie on their back and lift their legs up.
A board or a cloth is placed underneath, and the tip of the syringe is greased with oil, egg white, marshmallow saliva, or something similar. Then gently insert it into the anus, grasp the bulb with both hands, squeeze vigorously until all the contents of the syringe have been emptied into the bowels.
Remove the syringe and have the patient lift their legs to the wall. If the medicine stimulates a desire for defecation, try to hold it in as much as possible; if they sleep through the whole night, so much the better for the treatment. But if they are given an enema in cases of diarrhea and wish to hurry up its evacuation, let them repeat the enema until they are cured.
If there are hemorrhoids or painful swellings in the anus, let the syringe be very smooth and gentle, rather than those used for enemas on children. Here is a picture of a gentle syringe with its cover attached.
Chapter Eighty-Four.
On the Treatment of Wounds.
I have already discussed, in the introduction, the treatment of wounds which resemble cauterizations; and I shall now treat them with the hand or medicines perfectly. Wounds differ according to the object that causes them and also according to the part of the body affected.
The objects which may cause wounds are many, such as the blow of a stone or the cut of a sword, knife, spear, stick or arrow; and there is also a great variety of other things.
And regarding surgical procedures according to the body part, it can be like a wound on the head or neck or chest or abdomen or liver and similar organs.
And I shall describe the treatment of some wounds to make them a measure and a rule for all other wounds, and I start with simple head wounds in particular because compound ones will be mentioned in the third chapter of this book.
So I say, when a simple wound occurs on the head and there is no bone fracture, then examine it. If it is due to a blow from a stone or the like and has split the skin only, and the wound is large, and you fear the patient might develop hot swelling, then hasten and lance it at the site of impact. Do not delay this, and remove blood from him according to his strength if there is no hindrance to cupping, especially if the blood that comes out of the wound is minimal. Let the cupping be done on the opposite side of the injured part.
Warn the patient against overeating and drinking, and avoid heavy foods. If there is an obstacle to cupping, let him reduce his food intake, stay away from meats, and not drink alcohol. Apply to the wound, if hot swelling occurs, a cotton pad soaked in rose oil alone or with astringent wine.
If you are not concerned about hot swelling, then apply to the wound, if it is fresh and its blood has not dried, the powdered medication that I will describe soon. But if the air has caused a change [in the wound], then treat it with some ointments.
Until pus comes out, then treat it until it heals. If the wound is large and due to a sword cut or the like, and its lips do not close with sutures, then bring them together by stitching as I will describe in the chapter on abdominal wounds.
If the skin is exposed and attached to the bone, but its grip is only in a small flap, cut it off. Then treat the wound with medicines that will heal it into solid flesh instead of the skin, and instruct the patient to nourish themselves with foods like broths and purees that are strengthening.
If the skin becomes gangrenous and is not attached to the bone, cut away all of it and discard it; then treat the wound with medicines that will heal it into solid flesh instead. If any artery or vein bleeds from these wounds and bleeding cannot be stopped by drugs alone, search for the artery itself.
If you hit it and it does not fall away on its own, sever the artery with a scalpel and tie it off; if necessary bind it. If what we have described above is of no use to stop bleeding, cauterize it until the blood flow stops. These small wounds are simple matters that require little treatment beyond covering them in powder while they still bleed.
Before it is exposed to air, the powder should be made from one part frankincense, two parts styrax and three parts quicklime or unslaked lime; pound them all together with a pestle and sieve until fine, then fill the wound and bind firmly so that it adheres well.
It will dry in the blood and then bind it on top with bandages; leave them so that they are not removed while there is no swelling, for the medicine shall not be washed away until it heals. Lime alone can do this also if you cannot find frankincense or styrax.
Sometimes caustic soda can be used for this purpose in many large wounds, provided it is carefully placed and bound; as long as the wounds are still fresh with blood and have not yet been exposed to air. However, if they have changed somewhat, especially during summer, then this should not be attempted.
There is no effective meaning in placing this poultice so treat it as we have mentioned, by applying some mature salves or a gruel made of barley flour with water and honey until the pus drains out. Then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
If a fracture occurs in the bone along with the wound and it is minor, extract it using forceps; I have mentioned the treatment of skull fractures later on, under neck surgery. If the wound occurs in the neck, there is no difference between its treatment and that of a simple head wound.
But if a nerve in the neck has been severed, there is no remedy other than to avoid treating it with anything that causes severe constriction such as zinc vitriol and lead salts, for they harm the nerve and cause it to spasm.
Nothing cold should be applied to the wound, for the nature of the nerve is cold and it connects with the brain which is the noblest organ; treat it with gentle medicines such as slaked lime washed repeatedly in fresh water, moistened with oil or rosewater, and tutty.
If you also wash it with fresh water and the other metallic stones in this manner, and use moist salves, but if the wound is large then use stitches or bind its lips together with bandages, then treat it until it heals.
If the wound is deep and there is a hollow space beneath it where pus has accumulated, cauterize it in its lowest part. If an artery is severed in the wound and you see blood escaping from it, cut it off, or tie it tight, or cauterize it if need be.
If the wound has cut through some or all of the tracheal rings, but the vessels remain intact, then gather together the edges of skin with stitches around the trachea and do not touch it; instead, smooth it over and return it to its natural shape. Then apply tight bandages, leaving them on for several days.
Afterwards, treat it with ointments containing astringent and drying properties until healing occurs. If the wound has affected the bone, then search for any bone fragments; if there are some, extract all of them or as many as you can reach. Whatever cannot be reached, leave to rot within the wound so that healing may occur and their removal becomes easier.
If the wound is fresh, then dust it with a powder as described previously. If bone fragments cause decay within the wound, then treat this as an abnormal fistula and refer to the section on chest surgery and the area between the shoulders for further instructions.
If the wound is caused by a spear or knife and you observe a cavity, examine it to see if air escapes from it during the patient's exhalation; this would indicate a fatal injury. However, if there is no visible cavity but the wound remains fresh with blood present, do not dust it immediately nor apply bandages tightly, for fear of trapping blood within the cavity.
In such a case, the blood would rush back to the heart and cause the patient's death. To avoid this, apply an attractive ointment and dissolve it twice daily. If no such ointment is available, place an old piece of cotton in the wound to absorb any moisture that escapes from it; also ensure the patient sleeps with their injury elevated.
If the wound has persisted for three days or more without inducing convulsions, severe palpitations, labored breathing, or other negative symptoms in the patient and their overall condition remains satisfactory, then assume the injury is not life-threatening. Proceed to treat it with cauterization or any other appropriate means until healing occurs.
If healing is impossible and the swelling persists, then know that it has become a fistula. Treat it from its opening; let the patient rest until the wound drains and whatever collects within it.
Whether it is large or small, if it has affected the bone and broken off fragments, then explore the wound and proceed to extract those fragments if they are free. If not, leave them be for now.
If the wound becomes infected, it will be easier to remove them [the fragments]. As for other wounds that occur in various body parts, their treatment follows the rules we have mentioned.
Chapter eighty-five.
On abdominal wounds and the evisceration of intestines, as well as their suturing.
A wound in the abdomen may be large, small or of medium size. A large wound may result in the evisceration of intestines, making their reinsertion and suturing more challenging and complex.
A small wound can also present challenges in a different way, requiring an even more difficult reinsertion of the intestines. If they are not promptly returned to their proper place, the intestines will swell and thicken, making reinsertion more difficult. Therefore, among these three types of wounds, the medium-sized one is considered preferable as it does not complicate the return of the intestines in the same way as the other two types.
Keep in mind that there are four types of suturing techniques for the abdomen: two general methods suitable for abdominal and other bodily wounds, while the other two specialized methods can be used for various wounds but are particularly useful for the abdomen.
And I shall describe it to you, one by one, with explanation and clarification: if the wound is small and something of the intestine comes out, and it is difficult to push back, that may be for one of two reasons; either due to the small size of the hole, as we said, or because the intestine has become inflated beforehand due to cold air.
So, if that is the case, you should warm it by dipping a wet sponge or cloth in lukewarm water alone, or you may have cooked in it *Artemisia herba-alba*, *Teucrium polium* and *Achillea santolina*, and wipe the intestine with it until the inflation subsides.
Alternatively, you may use a drink that contains astringent properties, which is better than water alone in reducing the inflation. Once you see that the inflation has subsided, moisten the intestine with water that has been cooked with *Oenanthe crocata* or *Foeniculum vulgare*, as this will facilitate its re-entry with minimal effort.
If, after this treatment, it is still impossible to return [the intestine], make a small incision in the hole with an instrument similar to that used for making fistulas. The first method of treatment, if successful, is preferable over incision, and resorting to such an incision should only be done out of necessity and after all other methods have been exhausted. This is an illustration of the said instrument:
One side of it is curved and limited, while the other side is unlimited; the thin end should not be as sharp as a scalpel, but rather slightly blunt like a nose. This instrument resembles a small mallet, as you can see in the illustration. If the wound has become enlarged and the intestine has entered, its re-positioning must be done carefully to restore it to its natural shape.
If possible, the intestine should be returned to its original position in the abdomen. However, if the hole is wide and located in the lower part of the abdomen, the patient should lie on their back with their legs elevated higher than their head. If it is in the upper abdomen, then they should elevate their head and chest above their feet.
And likewise, if the incision is on one side of the abdomen, your aim and purpose should always be to elevate that side where surgery is performed more than the other side. Thus it should be employed in both major and minor surgeries.
As for minor surgeries, place it as you see fit, then have a gentle servant ready at your hands to hold the incision with both his hands and gather his lips together before revealing one piece after another to the surgeon.
This is the description of a single common stitch, which involves taking one needle or several needles according to the size of the wound and leaving an amount equal to the thickness of your little finger from the edge of the incision before inserting a single needle without any thread into both sides of the skin. On both sides of the peritoneum beneath the skin from inside so as to penetrate it from that side, having gathered together both edges of the skin and both edges of the peritoneum thus forming four folds before pulling a doubled thread around the needle several times on both sides until the lips of the wound meet firmly.
Then leave a portion equal to the thickness of your index finger and insert another needle, threading it as you did with the first one so that you keep doing this according to how many needles are needed until you complete sewing up the entire wound, ensuring that the needles are neither too thick nor too thin.
As very thin needles quickly cut through the flesh and thick ones are also hard to insert into the skin, they should be of medium thickness. The needle should not be inserted too close to the edge of the skin.
So that the flesh does not break off quickly and the wound opens before healing, but also do not space it too far apart with stitches so that the wound may refuse to heal. Then cut the ends of the needles lest they injure the patient in their sleep, and make him dressings from pieces of linen cloth on each side holding the ends of the needles.
Leave it there until you know the wound has healed, and this type of stitching with needles is more suitable for small wounds as only one or two needles may be sufficient.
As for the method of common stitching, you gather together the four edges, that is to say, the two edges of skin and those of peritoneum in one go with a needle which has a twisted thread of moderate thickness then when you have passed through these four edges with the needle return it on the same side from which you started.
So that the thread is interwoven from above the wound to make the stitches like those on a sack used for lashing loads and you leave between each stitch as far as the thickness of the little finger; this kind of stitching all men know.
Using this method of stitching I sewed a wound in the belly of a man who had been stabbed with a knife and the gash was more than a span long; about two spans of the small intestine protruded from his gut, and the wound was right in the middle of his stomach.
I repositioned it after his gut had been protruding from the wound for twenty-four hours and the wound healed in about fifteen days; I treated him until he recovered completely, and afterwards he lived for many years, managing all his affairs normally; the doctors had said that there was no hope of recovery at all.
It is strange that I did not treat it with ointment, for I was in a place where there were no medicines; so I would apply to the wound twice daily old cotton wool and make sure to wash it with honey water until it healed.
As for one of the two types of special suturing, I quote Galen's description: you begin by stitching from outside the skin and push the needle inwards; when it has passed through the skin and into the straight muscle that runs the whole length of the belly.
Leaving the peritoneum margin on the side where you inserted the needle, push it through its other edge from inside to outside at the opposite margin of the ribs; when you have done this, push it again through this same margin of the ribs from outside inwards.
Leave the peritoneum margin on this side and push it through its other edge from inside to outside; as you do so, pierce also with the needle the peritoneum towards the ribs margin on that same side until they are all pierced.
Then start once more from this same side and line up with the margin of peritoneum on the other side; bring the needle out through the skin close by, then return it to that same skin and follow along the peritoneum margin on the other side together with this ribs margin.
Bring the needle out through that same skin; do this again, once more after another time until you have sutured the whole wound in this way. The characteristic feature of this type of suturing is that it resembles the stitching of furriers when sewing furs together.
By sewing the peritoneum once from one side with the skin edge and leaving it on the other side until you are finished, while for the second type of specialized stitching he mentioned as well Galen this is his words exactly.
And that you stitch it as some healers do, by bringing each part together with its corresponding natural counterpart: joining the edge of the peritoneum to its other edge and the rib cage's edge to its other edge, which is done as I describe to you.
You should insert the needle into the rib cage's edge near you from outside, passing it through to the inside and leaving the peritoneum edges; then you bring back the needle, pass it from outside to inside through both peritoneum edges, and pull it out as well.
Pass it through from inside to outside into the other rib cage edge on the opposite side; this type of stitching is better than the simple, easy stitching mentioned earlier - these are Galen's words exactly; some have said that abdominal stitching can be done with two needles. That is, you pass a single thread through both of them and start by passing the first needle in from your side to the other side, then insert the other needle from its opposite side towards yours, stitching it like cobblers do.
Know that if there is a hole in the center of the abdomen, it will be more difficult to stitch than other areas of the abdomen; as for treating the wound, its treatment follows the rules of all wounds: when you catch the fresh wound with blood still inside before air changes it, return the intestine, stitch and secure it firmly, then apply healing powders.
If the wound has been affected by air, apply some of the available ointments until it becomes inflamed and the stitches fall out, and the abdominal wall and flanks unite. Then treat it as you would other wounds until it heals.
If you do not have medications available, apply old cotton wool from the start of inflammation and change it twice a day as I instructed until it heals. You will not need further treatment in most cases if the wounds are simple, but if you fear that nearby vital organs may become involved with the wound's pain.
You should dip soft wool in moderately warm oil or rose oil and place it around the areas between the groin and armpit. If they feel pain or infection in their intestines, this often indicates an issue, so inject them with a tepid black astringent drink.
Especially if the infection has reached the intestines and become an open wound penetrating its cavity, note that anything involving the thicker intestine is easier to heal whereas issues with thinner intestine are more challenging.
As for the intestine known as the small bowel, it does not heal from surgical wounds due to its many large veins and delicate structure close to nerve tissue. However, if what protrudes from the wound is the omentum and you catch it while still fresh, replace it according to how you would restore the intestines.
If a period has passed and it has turned green or black, you should bind it with thread above the discolored area to prevent bleeding as there are veins and arteries in the omentum. Then cut off anything below that binding.
Make the ends of the thread hang from below the incision, extending out of it so that you can easily pull and remove them when the entrails fall out and the wound becomes infected; he mentioned the wound that occurs in the intestines, but if there is a rupture in the intestine and it is small...
It can heal in some people, because I saw a man who had been wounded in the abdomen by a spear thrust and the wound became chronic, turning into a fistula from which faeces and wind issued; so I treated him even though I did not expect a cure. I kept consoling him until he was cured and the wound closed; when I saw that the wound had healed, I feared for the patient that something bad might happen inside his body, but no such misfortune ever befell him, and he remained in perfect health. He was healthy, eating and drinking, having intercourse and going to the bathroom; he could perform his duties without difficulty, and some experienced people have said that if there is a small wound in the intestine it should be sutured this way.
This is done by taking large-headed ants, then bringing together the edges of the wound; an ant with its mouth open is placed on the lips of the wound and if it bites and tightens its jaws, its head is cut off because this ensures adhesion; another ant is placed next to the first one.
You keep doing this with several ants according to the size of the wound, then you close it up and suture the wound; those heads will remain stuck to the intestine until it heals completely, without any side effects on the patient's health; it may also be possible to suture the intestines with fine thread.
The procedure to remove the animal intestine adhered to it [the needle] after insertion is as follows: take one end of this thread from the intestine and pull carefully, then tie a fine spun linen thread to its end and insert that thread into the needle. When the intestine thread is present, it can be used to suture the intestines and then returned to the abdomen. This type of suturing with ants and intestines is done out of greed and hope.
However, if the wound is large and wide, especially in one of the thin intestines, there is no remedy and no cure for it whatsoever.
Chapter 86.
On the treatment of rhinitis and fistula.
Know that any wound, swelling, or ulcer that becomes chronic, ages, and fails to heal, continually discharging pus without interruption is called a fistula in general, regardless of the affected organ. We refer to it as rhinitis, or the fistula.
It is in reality a solid, white, hard conglomeration without pain that has a cavity like the cavity of a bird's feather.
This is why some have called it a feather. Sometimes it can be moist, continuously discharging pus; at other times the moisture may stop temporarily. This discharge can be abundant or scant; thick or thin.
As mentioned earlier in the classification of wounds, any ulcer that fails to heal or develop flesh has one of nine possible causes: insufficient blood supply in the body; poor quality of blood; or the presence of hard tissue inside and on its lips, preventing good flesh from growing. Either it is due to excessive pus and dirt, or because the ulcer itself is putrid and the matter sustaining it is of poor quality, or because the medicine used for its treatment is not appropriate, or due to an epidemic outbreak in the town, or a specific peculiarity of that particular town.
Either it is due to excessive pus and dirt, or because the ulcer itself is putrid and the matter sustaining it is of poor quality, or because the medicine used for its treatment is not appropriate, or due to an epidemic outbreak in the town, or a specific peculiarity of that particular town. As observed in the city of Zaragoza, where diseases take a long time to mature and wounds heal slowly by nature; or it could be because there is one bone or several bones involved. I have explained all these causes, their signs, and treatments with medicines in the appropriate section.
Here, I must acquaint you with the treatment of fistulas and colds that involve manual intervention. Fistulas can occur in all parts of the body; some end at major veins or arteries while others terminate on nerves.
Some fistulas open into the peritoneum, intestines, bladder, ribs, vertebrae of the spine, or complex joints like those in the hand and foot. Others terminate near vital organs.
Those fistulas that have such characteristics as mentioned above are among the difficult-to-heal diseases, which do not respond to treatment and attempting to treat them is futile ignorance. However, if there are fistulas that do not reach these specific sites I've described, then there may be hope for their treatment.
If you wish to explore and gain knowledge about such fistulas, take a copper or iron probe. If the fistula runs straight, use this to examine it. But if it has bends, then use a thin lead probe as lead is more flexible.
When you enter [the fistula] and it turns towards the bend, if the fistula has multiple openings that you cannot detect with a sound, inject one of its mouths; the moisture you inject will reach the other orifices and flow out.
Start the investigation in any way possible to determine if there is bone or nerve, whether the bottom of the fistula is deep or shallow, or whether it has multiple openings; ascertain all this as best you can by asking about your patient's experience with pain when prodded at the site.
And other such signs and causes of the swelling, once you have a clear understanding of all this, then proceed with treatment confidently. Look to see if it is...
If the fistula is superficial and close to the surface or in a healthy area away from joints, nerves, arteries, veins, or other sensitive areas I mentioned earlier, then cut open the fistula as described above and remove any abscesses, rotten flesh, and excess tissue.
And any growths, such as flesh or warts that form at its opening, treat them until they heal. If the fistula is deep and straight, you should cut it open deeply as much as possible, then clean out all its rotten flesh.
Then use the caustic thread in sharp medicines and insert it to the bottom of the fistula that you can reach with an iron probe, do this repeatedly until the sharp medicine consumes all the corruption left at the base of the fistula.
Then treat it with salves that promote healthy flesh growth until it heals. If this does not work, cauterize it as previously described. If the cause of the fistula is bone and you are certain of this, then probe and cut it open as I told you unless there is a reason preventing you from doing so.
If a bone, nerve or vital organ is exposed as we said, and there is some corruption and blackening of the bone, scrape it clean until its corruption disappears then treat it with whatever will make it heal so that it may recover. If it does not heal and suppuration continues as before.
Know that you have not reached the complete removal of corruption, so uncover everything above it again and investigate its scraping and purification to your utmost ability then force [the issue], if it heals otherwise know that this corruption is in a far away depth so uncover all that is above it once more.
And investigate its scraping and purification to your utmost ability, if the corrupted bone is a small one and you can pull it out then pull it with fine forceps suitable for that purpose.
If [the bone] is among many, then force their pulling all of them and leave nothing behind to your utmost ability but if something from the ligaments prevents you from doing so and there is no danger in cutting those ligaments then cut those ligaments as well as any flesh that may be present and release the bones.
If you cannot extract the bones at this time then cover the wound with something that will cause putrefaction and leave it for a few days until the flesh and ligaments surrounding those bones also become putrid, take care to prevent the wound from healing over any incisions made during your work.
But rather place upon it, if you fear this will occur, a cotton pad soaked in sulfur powder with oil or a cotton pad soaked in Egyptian ointment or one of the green ointments for when those ligaments become putrid and the bones bare their extraction and pulling becomes easier.
If it is a single large bone such as the tibia or femur and similar [bones] and only its surface has become corrupted, then scrape it thoroughly until that blackening and corruption disappear then force the wound closed. However if a large part of it has become corrupted and the corruption has reached into the marrow then there is no alternative but to saw through it.
And cut it all away until the damage ends; then treat it so that it may heal. I will tell you about a case of cellulitis in a man's leg, to serve as an example and aid for your treatment. This man was young.
Around the age of thirty, he experienced pain in his leg due to some internal movement within the body, causing the tissues to become infected and swell into a large tumor. There was no external cause; over time, with the doctors' mistakes, the tumor opened up.
Pus and bodily fluids oozed out in great quantities, and his leg became foul-smelling; multiple openings formed, all discharging pus. He was treated by a group of doctors for almost two years but none of them were skilled craftsmen.
Until he came to me; I saw his leg, with the discharge flowing in great quantities from those openings and the man's body had wasted away and his skin turned yellow. I inserted a probe into one of those openings and it reached all the way to the bone; then I examined all the openings.
I found that they connected with each other from all sides of the leg; so I opened up one of those openings and, after cutting away some flesh, exposed a part of the bone which I found to be rotten, eaten away, blackened, putrefied, and perforated right through into the marrow. So I cleaned out what was revealed.
I removed all the rotten bone, thinking that was the only damaged part and I had got rid of it; then I treated the wound with healing drugs for a long time but it still would not heal up. So I uncovered the bone again, beyond where I had first opened it.
I discovered the corruption was connected to the bone, so I also removed what appeared to me of that corruption and then tried to fix it but it did not mend or fuse. Then when I examined again, I kept cutting away the bone part by part trying to heal it but it still would not mend until I had cut away about a hand's breadth.
I extracted it with its brain and then I healed it with medicines so that it quickly fused together, healing rapidly. And this repetition in the procedure and opening was necessary due to the patient's weakness and his low capacity for endurance, as well as my fear of his death because he had fainting spells from severe vomiting at all times. He recovered fully.
A hard flesh grew in the place of the bone, and its condition improved within his body. His strength returned and he recovered, walking with no difficulty or pain whatsoever. If a protruding bone breaks anywhere on the body...
You should spread it in this manner: take a bandage and tie it to the end of the protruding bone, then tell someone to pull it upwards while you fasten another thicker woollen bandage, stronger than the first one.
Then bind it to the flesh below the bone and stretch its end so that the flesh is pulled downwards, while you uncover the area which you wish to saw through, lest the saw harm the flesh. Place a plank or board under the bone from beneath to provide support.
Because if you do that, the saw will not be hindered from cutting through the corrupted bone. You should saw slightly above where the corruption is so as to avoid any further corruption within the hollow of the bone which may not appear on its surface and thus necessitate a second surgery.
If the bone is corrupted and it isn't protruding but its parts are connected, and the corruption is in the middle or in some of it; expose all sides of the flesh entirely then place a piece of wood underneath before sawing it from the first side where the corruption exists.
Once you've finished sawing it, saw it from the other side and let the sawing be slightly away from the corruption as we said; if the corruption is in a joint cut that corrupt joint itself and saw the bone where they are connected from the other side.
If the corruption is in the connection of two joints, there's no other way but to scrape it; if the corruption is in the palm of your hand or the sole of your foot then dealing with this problem will be very difficult however you should peel off the corrupted tissue however possible and scrape it while cleaning it regardless.
By any trick you can think of, whenever no tendons or nerves stand in your way; and know that the chisels and saws used to cut these bones are many according to how the bone is positioned, set up, thick or thin, large or small, hard or soft. Therefore you should prepare for each type of job the appropriate tool that is suitable for that particular task.
Know that the jobs themselves may guide you to the type of tool you need if you have long experience and knowledge in the art of this craft because the skilled craftsmen who witness various diseases will know it well. He may come up with tools that suit him for each disease, I will show you some of these tools at the end of this chapter.
They will be examples to follow and patterns by which you may measure others, if God wills it; a saw: [image of the saw]

Chapter 78.
On amputation and bone resection.
The limbs may become gangrenous either from an external cause or from an internal one. If you treat this corruption with medicinal treatments and it is not successful, and if you see the corruption advancing in the member uncontrollably.
You should then amputate that member to where the corruption has reached, thus saving the patient from death or a great affliction which is greater than losing the limb. A sign of this is when the member turns black as if it has been burned by fire.
Or it may become gangrenous after turning black, such that the gangrene spreads to the rest of the body; in this case, proceed promptly with amputation. This is also true if the corruption was caused by the bite or sting of certain animals like the sea scorpion, snake, tarantula, and so on.
If the corruption or sting is in the tip of a finger, amputate the entire finger without delay lest the corruption spread to the hand; and if it has already spread to the hand, amputate at the wrist joint so that it does not advance further up the arm.
Similarly, if it has reached the arm, amputate at the elbow joint; but if you see that the corruption is heading towards the shoulder, do not amputate the shoulder under any circumstances, for this will lead to the patient's death. Instead, employ other treatments as best you can.
The same goes for the leg: if corruption has reached a toe, amputate it at one of its joints; and if it is in the metatarsus, amputate the entire leg. But if it has advanced to the knee, then cut off the leg at the knee joint.
If the corruption has reached above the knee, there is no option but to let it be and surrender the patient to death. The method for amputating or dissecting a limb is as follows: tie a ligature below the place where you intend to cut, and tie another one above that location.
One servant stretches the lower ligature downwards, while another pulls the upper one upwards. You then remove the flesh between the two with a broad scalpel until all of it is exposed and can be cut or dissected. It should be done on all sides by placing pieces of linen cloth nearby.
To avoid the saw damaging healthy tissue and causing further pain or a hot swelling, if there is bleeding during your work, cauterise the spot quickly or use some blood-clotting powders on it before returning to your task until you are finished.
Then bind the wounded limb with an appropriate ligature and treat it until it heals. I can give you an example of this exact condition, which a man had in his leg: there was blackening along with a burning sensation akin to fire.
The corruption started at the tip of his toe, spreading throughout his foot as time went on. Due to the severe pain and burning sensation he experienced, the man self-amputated when he saw it was necessary for him to do so in order to prevent further damage from occurring; cutting off all affected tissue just above the ankle joint resulted in a successful healing process thereafter.
After a long period of time had passed, the same corruption reappeared in his index finger. He came to me for help and I attempted to deter its spread by applying various medicines directly onto his hand after thoroughly cleaning it; however these efforts proved unsuccessful as it continued to advance into adjacent digits.
Until corruption spread in the hand, prompting me to cut off his hand, which I refused out of hope that he would refrain from such an act and fear for him; should we amputate his hand, death will ensue since his body had already weakened considerably. When he despaired, he left for his home.
I was informed that he had committed the offense and I cut off his hand entirely, leading to recovery. This story serves as a guide for similar cases of this illness.
Chapter 88.
Treatment of abscesses and the method of injecting them with medication.
Should a tumor occur in some fleshy organs and persist for an extended period, eventually bursting or draining away all the pus it contained, leaving behind an empty cavity resembling a vessel.
The skin over it resembles a rag, thin and not so corrupted as to affect the bone, nerve or ligament. Thus, it deserves to be called an abscess rather than a fistula unless its corruption persists long enough to affect any of these organs.
It is then called a fistula or sinus and should be treated by cutting away all the skin, especially if it has thinned considerably to resemble a rag, while ensuring that its corruption does not adhere to the wound.
If you hope for the skin to adhere and the corruption has not reached such an extent, yet there is some flesh remaining in the skin, treat it with injection; inspect the abscess, if large and its pus emits a foul odor, inject it with Egyptian medication.
Which is equal parts vinegar, oil, honey and verdigris; mix them in a container and cook on the fire until the mixture thickens to the consistency of honey. Then take what you need, dilute it with water and honey, inject into the abscess, bind its mouth, and leave the medication for two hours.
Then express the contents, repeating this for several days until the abscess is cleansed and the foul smell disappears. It can also be injected with lye water if you do not have the aforementioned medication; this is made by adding water to the ash of grapevine wood or oak.
Then strain and inject until you are sure the abscess is cleansed; if the patient cannot tolerate Egyptian medication or lye water, then inject with a mixture of water, honey, and some powdered verdigris.
Or inject with a mixture of honey and wine, for the honey will cleanse and wash out, while the wine adheres to the abscess; especially if the wine has some astringent and drying properties. If you do this several times and are sure the abscess is healed, then inject with something that promotes flesh growth.
For example, take some palm ointment and dissolve it in rose oil with astringent wine; or inject with other medications and salves described previously in the chapter on ointments. If the mouth of the abscess is narrow and does not allow the injection tube to enter,
Widen it slightly with an iron instrument, or place a wick soaked in Egyptian ointment or Serapion's salve until it is sufficiently wide; and if the mouth of the abscess is also too large, suture its lips together so that only enough remains to allow insertion of the injection tube without excess.
And if the mouth from which pus flows is raised upwards, then cut it open in its lowest part so that the pus may flow downwards; for when pus accumulates deep inside a cavity, it prevents flesh from growing there.
If you cannot cut open the cavity towards its lower part as intended, then erect the member so that pus may flow out of it easily in whatever way seems suitable to you and aim for nothing at all of the pus to be retained within.
As for the healing medicines that are applied to the cavity from outside and how they should be put on it, take one of the appropriate healing ointments you require and spread it onto a linen cloth; let the cloth be large enough to wrap around the entire cavity. Then with scissors cut an opening in front of the cavity's mouth, slightly wider than its own mouth; then spread some soft ointment on another cloth that fits over the opening and place it so that it is spaced away from the mouth of the cavity to allow easy drainage of pus; do not remove the large cloth until...
leave it there for several days; as for the one on the mouth of the cavity, remove that at every opportunity so that any pus accumulated can be released and you may discover how much pus is draining from it and whether it is ripe or unripe.
and also examine the cavity itself to see if its owner feels any pain there or whether there is swelling or not; so, as your treatment continues in this way and you observe that the discharge on the mouth of the cavity is negligible...
know then that the cavity has healed or is close to healing; so, untie it on the following day or by the third day and when you have undone the binding of the wound, replace the cloths with new ones and renew the ointment; if after a long time thin pus still flows from the cavity, do not despair of its sticking together.
His healing is quick because there are people whose flesh grows slowly in their wounds, and others have the opposite. If after many days, pus emerges from the wound that is not ripe, know then that the wound has not healed. If the closure of the wound is delayed.
If it takes a long time, then increase the drying of the medications and let them be moist in composition but dry in strength, such as palm ointment if an extra amount of pitch has been added to it. The most effective treatment is to take palm ointment.
It can be dissolved in rose oil, and old wine of moderate strength is sprinkled over it; then knead it with this and use it. A similar action may be taken if palm ointment is not available: honey that has been boiled until thick is used, or take myrobalan, aloe, and costus, grind them all together, and sprinkle the powder on honey while it is still over a fire. Then apply it to a cloth and tie it over the wound, or use honey that has been boiled until thick, sprinkle the drugs on it, place cloths over it, and tie them.
Another treatment for this is to use single or combined preparations of long-leaved mezereon, iris root, chaff flower flour, and centaury; grind them together, sieve the mixture, sprinkle it on honey as previously described, then apply that. If after a long time the wound has not healed using these treatments, know that there is damage deep inside.
If it affects the bones or other solid nerves or ligaments, treat it with an abscess treatment as described previously.
Chapter 89.
On the Treatment of Whipping Pain and Crushed Fingernail, Amputation of Superfluous Finger, and Splitting of Fused Fingers.
Whipping pain is a fleshy growth that forms under the thumbnail of the hand or foot, and it may also occur on other fingers. If left untreated for too long, it becomes swollen and hot.
If it becomes corrupt and purulent to the point of eating away at the nail bed, or even destroying the entire nail, and perhaps reaching as far as the bone so that it develops a putrid odor and the tip of the finger becomes broad and its color turns livid, then if you treat it with what has been mentioned in this chapter and your treatment is not effective.
You should then remove with a blade all the excess flesh that has grown from the nail, and cauterize the wound afterward; cauterization is extremely beneficial in this case. If the bone is intact and also the nail.
If the curved part of the nail has pressed flesh inward and is constantly jabbing and irritating it, you should place a thin probe under that corner of the nail which is causing the pain and lift it up; then cut away that flesh gently.
Apply a caustic medicine to the remaining flesh until it is all gone, then treat with salves until healed. But if the corruption has spread as far as the bone, you should remove that bone and extract it; for so long as there remains any corrupted bone, healing will be impossible.
If you see the decay and corruption spreading into the finger, cut it off at one of the phalanges as described previously, then treat until healed. If the nail has been struck or bruised and intense pain results, you should first perform venesection on the patient.
First, make a diagonal incision on the nail with a sharp scalpel from top to bottom and be careful not to cut into the flesh beneath the nail as this will cause severe pain for the patient and lead to excess tissue growth at that spot; then treat the area with something to alleviate the pain.
The extra finger that is sometimes generated in some people's hands may be fully fleshy, or it might have bones and nails; the growth of some occurs at the joint where two fingers meet.
It might also grow on one of the finger bones, and those that grow on a finger bone do not move; as for those that move, they may appear at the joint. Cut off any fully fleshy growth by slicing it off at its base with a wide scalpel.
But removing growth from the joint is difficult and should be avoided; as for those that grow on a finger bone, first cut off the flesh in a circular motion down to the bone and then use one of the appropriate saws to cut into the bone.
And treat it until it heals. As for the fusion of fingers, this happens frequently; it may be something one is born with or caused by a healed wound, burn, or similar injury and must be surgically separated.
To restore the fingers to their natural state, split them apart with a wool thread or cloth soaked in rose oil so they do not quickly fuse again; or place a thin sheet of lead between them until the wound heals as it should.
The same goes for if the fingers have fused with the palm; cut into this fusion however works best to restore the limb's form.
Chapter Ninety.
On the excision of varicose veins.
Varicose veins are thick, twisted, dark-blue vessels filled with blood which occur in most parts of the body; they especially appear on the legs – mostly on the calves and thighs belonging to porters, gardeners and carriers. At first, one should vigorously use a remedy that expels black bile from the body.
Next, bleed the patient from the ulnar vein; as for treating it with cauterization, there are two methods: one involves cutting open and removing the dark blood while another requires tying off the vein and removing it entirely. The procedure of opening is done like this: first, bathe the leg thoroughly in hot water.
until the thick, cloudy blood softens; then bind the patient's leg tightly from above the thigh to below the knee with a bandage and cut open the vein in one spot or two spots or three – making wide incisions.
Next, draw out the dark blood with your hand from below the leg upward and then downward until you have removed as much of it as seems sufficient or that the patient can bear; then tie up the wound and tell him to avoid food that generates black bile while repeating the purging and bleeding.
If the vessels become full and this harms the patient, you can remove it by shaving the hair from his leg, then bathing in a warm bath until it reddens and exudes sweat or he exercises vigorously.
If he does not have a bathhouse to warm up his member, then cut the skin facing the vein lengthwise – either at its end near the knee or towards its bottom by the heel; next, open it with hooks and peel away the vein from both sides until you can feel it.
When it first appears, you see it as a deep red color. Once it has broken through the skin, it also looks like a tendon. Then insert a rod beneath it until it rises and comes out of the skin; tie it to a smooth, blunt hook. Afterwards make another incision nearby that one by about three fingers' width.
Then remove the skin from over the vein so that it is visible, then lift it with the rod as you did before and tie it to another hook like you did initially, then make another incision or multiple incisions if needed.
Then pull it out and cut it at the end of the incision near the heel, then grab and pull it out of the second incision; pull it towards the upper incision and continue this until you have pulled it all the way through from the third incision which is located highest up; once it has all come out, cut it.
If it does not respond to pulling and stripping, insert a needle with a strong doubled thread and tie it; pull it and put the rod beneath it again and twist your hand in each direction until it comes out. Be careful that it does not break as this would make it very difficult to strip.
If any of this procedure causes harm to the patient, then apply a piece of woolen fabric soaked in rose water or oil; treat it until it heals. If the arm is stiff and twisted with varicose veins, then...
If the arm is not straight as mentioned, you should make incisions on either side of the varicose veins and at points where it twists; attach hooks to these and strip out the entire vein. Take care when making the incision that you do not cut or damage the vein as this will make stripping very difficult.
Figure: Instrument for cutting grapes:
Figure: The Blind Hook.
It should not have a barb like the other hooks and it should not be sharp at the end so as not to injure the vein, instead being thickly bent and smooth because if it were thin it would cut the vein with its thinness but rather it must be much thicker than we said.
Chapter ninety-one.
For removing the urban vein.
This vein is generated in the legs in hot regions such as Hijaz and Arabia, and in arid, infertile countries. It may also occur elsewhere on the body besides the legs due to putrefaction beneath the skin.
As such things occur in the bodies of snakes, worms, pumpkins and larvae generated between skin and flesh; a sign that this vein is starting to appear is when there is severe inflammation in the leg followed by blisters at the site which then begin to release the vein.
Like the root of a plant or animal, when its tip appears it should be wrapped around a small piece of lead weighing from one to two drachmas, tied in place and left hanging from the leg.
Each time a part of it emerges, wrap and tie that in lead; if its length becomes excessive then cut off some of the vein but continue to wrap up any remainder without cutting it from its root before it has all emerged for if you do so, it will contract back into the flesh causing swelling, putrefaction at the site and a poor ulcer.
Therefore, it should be treated with care and removed gradually until all of it is out, leaving nothing in the body. In some people, this vein may measure up to five spans and ten palms [in length] when it comes out.
I have heard of a case where it came out from a man measuring twenty spans. If it breaks while you are treating it, insert a bougie into its orifice and push it down along the body until all the material is emptied; then try to induce suppuration in this part with medicine for several days.
Then treat it with the treatment for tumors. This vein may have multiple branches, especially if it appears in the ankle joint or in the leg itself; there will be many openings from which these branches emerge. Treat them as we mentioned earlier when discussing classification and according to what was previously explained.
Chapter ninety-two.
Regarding cutting into worms that develop beneath the skin, also known as "cow disease.
This disease is called "cow disease" in some of our countries because cattle are often affected by it. It is a small worm that develops between the skin and flesh, moving up and down throughout the body.
It can be detected by touch as it moves from one part of the body to another until it pierces the skin in a particular spot and emerges, forming from the putrefaction of some humors, much like worms, snakes, or pumpkin seeds in the abdomen.
The concern with this worm is that, if it moves through the body and reaches the head and then the eye, it might open up there and emerge, potentially blinding the patient. This occurs frequently. When treating and removing it, wait until you can feel its movement and detect its presence.
You should tighten the area above and below [the abscess] with a strong bandage, then make an incision over it and extract it. If it sinks into the flesh and you cannot find it, cauterize the area with fire until it is burned away. The greatest concern is that it may damage the eye, as we have said.
If you see that it has reached the head near the eye, then tightly bandage below it on the forehead and make an incision over it to extract it. The patient should regularly cleanse their body with medicines that ease the expulsion of putrid, foul humours and be cautious about foods that cause putrefaction.
Chapter 93.
On incising the disease known as 'the bulging one'.
This disease, which is called 'the bulging one' in our country, is a pain that appears in some body parts and then moves from one part to another. I have seen cases that match my description.
I was called to see a sick woman in the countryside. She showed me her arm, with a slight swelling on the radial artery. After an hour had passed, I saw that swelling moving along the forearm, ascending towards her shoulder as quickly as mercury.
If it moves from one place to another, the pain disappears from that spot and remains in the shoulder. After an hour passes, it spreads throughout the body until it reaches the other arm. She then told me that it circulates through her entire body, as I had witnessed.
I was amazed at how quickly it moved from one body part to another. I had never seen this disease with my own eyes before, presented in such a manner. I have, however, seen many people who experience pain that shifts from one part to another, but I had not witnessed it as clearly as I did with this woman.
I only perceived this because the woman was from a rural area, with dry skin and prominent veins. This is why it could be sensed; but one should not expect this to occur in people who are well-off, have moist bodies, and whose veins are less visible.
So, if you wish to treat it and the patient feels pain; should it appear before your eyes as mentioned above, strap over it from both sides with a bandage, press firmly until that trapped wind is released, then cauterize the area.
If you do not see it, treat the body with a shaking motion and other wind-removing agents such as stink seed, scabiosa seeds, and similar medicines.
Chapter 94.
On the removal of arrows.
Arrows vary depending on their type and the part of the body where they are located; these differences include large or small sizes, hollow or solid glass bodies, and variations in the number of angles with either three or four sides.
Some arrows have tongues, while others have splinters; those that are classified by the body parts they affect can be divided into two types: either vital hollow organs such as the brain, heart, liver, lungs, kidneys, intestines, bladder, and so on. If an arrow strikes one of these organs and you observe the signs of impending death as described, you should refrain from extracting the arrow; in most cases, it will lead to the patient's demise. If these negative signs are not present and the arrow has not penetrated deep into an organ, proceed with its removal and treat the wound. One sign of brain injury is a severe headache accompanied by intense pressure and dizziness when an arrow pierces the skull and damages the membrane covering the brain.
If these negative signs are not present and the arrow has not penetrated deep into an organ, proceed with its removal and treat the wound. One sign of brain injury is a severe headache accompanied by intense pressure and dizziness when an arrow pierces the skull and damages the membrane covering the brain. Redness in the eyes, a red tongue, convulsions, delirium, vomiting of bile, and sometimes blood comes out from the nostrils or ears. Speech may be lost, the voice gone, and a moist discharge like white porridge emerges from the wound site with an effluent resembling the watery part of flesh.
If these signs appear, desist from treating the patient and extracting the arrow if it has not already been removed. As for the signs of an arrow having pierced the heart, it is when it is close to the left breast and he can feel that it has lodged in something solid rather than empty.
Sometimes there is a movement in the arrow resembling the pulse, and black blood flows from the wound, followed by coldness of the limbs, cold sweat, and loss of consciousness. Then know that death is inevitable. A sign of an arrow having pierced the lung is frothy blood issuing forth from the wound.
The blood vessels following the neck become swollen, the patient's colour changes, and he breathes deeply while seeking to inhale cold air. If the arrow has pierced the diaphragm in the chest, it is close to the small ribs and breathing becomes laboured with severe pain.
He heaves deep sighs and there is movement in all the members of both shoulders. If the arrow has struck the liver, it is followed by severe pain, with blood emerging from the wound resembling the liver's redness. If the arrow has pierced the stomach, undigested food may emerge from the wound.
The situation is clear if the arrow has struck and lodged in the belly, with excrement emerging from the wound or intestines that have been perforated. In this case there is no hope for treatment nor extraction of the arrow. If the arrow pierces the bladder and urine comes out...
And if a part of it protrudes outwards and the pain intensifies for the patient, then know that they are doomed to die. As for other body parts such as the face, eye, throat, shoulder, upper arm, vertebrae, collarbone, thigh, leg, and similar organs, one can generally assume recovery.
When the arrow has not struck an artery or nerve and is not poisoned, I will inform you of some observations regarding such arrows so that you may deduce your treatment accordingly. An example would be when an arrow hit a man's eye socket at the root of his nose.
I removed it for him from the other side, beneath the earlobe, and he healed without any harm to his eye. I extracted another arrow from a Jew's tear duct under the lower eyelid; the arrow had disappeared, leaving only its small tip attached to the wooden shaft.
It was a large arrow, one of the composite bows with a square iron head that was smooth and had no ears. The Jew healed without any damage to his eye. I extracted another Arabic arrow from a Christian's throat.
It had two ears, so I cut it open between the jugular veins; it had sunk into his throat. I gently extracted it, and the Christian survived and healed. I removed another arrow from a man's stomach, estimating that he would die from it.
After thirty days or so had passed without any change in his condition, I cut open the arrow and maneuvered its removal; he healed without any further incident. I saw a man with an arrow wound on his back that had already begun to heal over.
After seven years, the arrow emerged from his thigh, and I saw a woman who had been shot in her belly; the wound healed but the arrow remained inside without causing any change to her condition or discomfort in her natural functions.
I saw another man who had been shot in the face; his wound healed but he still felt little pain, and there are many similar cases like this. I removed an arrow for a commander of the sultan's army that was lodged in the middle of his nose, slightly deviated to the right.
The arrow disappeared completely, so I was called to treat him three days after the injury; I found that the wound from the arrow was very narrow and, upon examining it with a fine probe, could not locate anything. The patient experienced discomfort and pain underneath his right ear.
I hoped that the discomfort was caused by the tip of the arrow, so I bandaged the area with a strong drawing plaster in hopes that it would cause swelling and reveal its presence; however, no such incident occurred.
I continued with the bandages for many days without any incident, and during this time, the wound healed over; the patient despaired of removing the arrow until one day he felt it inside his nose and informed me about it. I then applied a sharp, corrosive medication on the area for several days.
I continued to open and probe the wound until I felt the thin end of the arrow attached to its shaft, then increased the use of that sharp medication in order to expose it; after a period of time - about four months - we could see the tip of the arrow.
Then, when the wound widened and allowed for it, I inserted the forceps into it, pulling and moving it, but it did not yield to come out. So I kept coaxing it and trying different instruments until one day I grasped it with precise forceps as shown in the image at the end of this chapter.
The physicians had deemed his nasal cartilage unrepairable, yet I set it, and the wound healed. The patient recovered fully without issue, and I share this to guide you in removing some arrows, serving as a benchmark for other cases not detailed here.
As the intricacies of this craft cannot be fully grasped through description nor covered exhaustively in a book, it is the skilled practitioner who extrapolates from limited knowledge to manage diverse situations and create novel solutions with available tools when faced with unusual cases.
When extracting arrows from the body, they can be removed in two ways depending on their entry point: either by pulling them out directly or through an incision made opposite to where they entered.
If the arrowhead is visible under healthy flesh, you can attempt to pull it out directly. However, if this proves difficult initially, it's advisable to let it remain for a few days until the surrounding flesh becomes infected and easier to manipulate, which will facilitate its removal. The same applies when an arrowhead is embedded in bone.
Should it resist extraction after some time, leave it alone for a few more days and attempt pulling and moving it daily. If this proves ineffective over several days, you must drill small holes around the arrowhead in the bone from different angles using delicate drills to create space for its removal.
If the arrow embedded in the skull bone has penetrated deeply into one of the brain's ventricles and some of the symptoms mentioned have appeared, cease pulling on the arrow and leave it until its condition improves over several days.
So proceed to pull out the arrow, and if it is embedded very firmly and does not yield readily to pulling, use the drills around the arrow as I have described for you; then treat the place until it heals. But if the arrow has penetrated deeply into some part of the body, And if it is lost to sensation, probe for it with a sound; if you feel it, pull it out by means of some instrument suitable for the purpose. If you cannot manage this on account of the smallness of the wound and the depth of penetration of the arrow, and there are no bones, nerves or arteries in that place,
It will be difficult; so make an incision to enlarge the wound and seize the arrow in such a way that you can pull it out. If it has ears, grasp them with some instrument and free the flesh sticking to them on every side by whatever means you can; but if you cannot manage this without tearing the flesh, break or cut the ears so as to get free.
And when you try to extract the arrow, whatever part it may be in, use your hand in twisting with forceps in every direction until you get free of it; but proceed gently and carefully, lest the arrow should break and make it more difficult for you to pull it out. If you cannot manage this at once,
Leave it for a few days until the flesh around it becomes rotten, and then treat it again; at that point, it will be easier to do so. If you encounter any bleeding, use the treatment we mentioned in its section. Be very careful not to cut an artery, nerve or tendon, but rather employ tricks.
Remove the arrow in every way you can, gently and carefully, as I have described to you. When pulling out the arrow, it is important that the patient assumes the same position they were in when the arrow struck them; this is more suitable.
If that is not possible, then employ whatever form you can manage. If the arrow has emerged on the opposite side, either some of it may be protruding outside or you might find and feel the tip of the arrow just beneath the skin; in this case, you will see it sticking out.
Make an incision over it and let the size of that incision match what the forceps can accommodate. Then pull out the arrow; at this point, its removal should be easy. If you find that it is stuck in bone, then twist your hand around until the arrow affects the bone and makes some space for itself. Pull once more.
If this does not work, then leave it for a few days before attempting to remove the arrow again; at that point, you should be able to do so. If the shaft of the arrow is still in there, push on it with your finger. However, if the shaft has fallen out and you wish to employ pushing as a method, insert an empty tube into the wound such that its hollow interior encloses the tip of the arrow. Push the arrow out using this device.
If the arrow is hollow, push on it using a device that fits inside its cavity; this should make its removal easier. If the arrow is poisoned, then excise all of the flesh that has been contaminated by the poison if you can. Treat what remains with an appropriate medicine.
If the arrow that has struck is in the chest, or in the abdomen, or in the bladder, or in the side, and it is close to where you can feel it with a sound, then make an incision there, taking care not to cut any veins or nerves, and remove the arrow.
Then suture the wound if it requires stitching, and treat it until it heals. Image: The forceps used to extract arrows.
Their tips are shaped like a bird's beak, designed to grip arrows or other objects firmly without letting go. Forceps come in various sizes: large, small, and medium, depending on the size of the arrow, the wound, and its width.

This is solid at the end, shaped like a pestle, to facilitate its entry into the hollow arrow and pushing it through.
Chapter 95.
On venesection, or opening the veins.
There are thirty veins in the body that are commonly opened for bloodletting, sixteen of which are in the head: the two pulsating veins behind the ears known as the 'sensitive ones', the two arteries visible on the temples, and the two veins at the corners of the eyes known as the 'observers'.
There is one vein that rises in the middle of the forehead, a vein at the tip of the nose, two veins on the neck (the 'jugulars'), two veins on the upper lip, and two more on the lower lip; these are known as the 'four-fold', plus there are two veins under the tongue.
The five veins that are bled in the arm and hand, one of which is the cephalic vein on the lateral side, which the public calls the head vein; another is the radial artery, the middle one, compounded of a branch from the basilic vein and a division of the cephalic, called by the common people 'the body vein'.
And the basilic vein, which lies on the medial side and is also called the axillary vein; the public call it the abdominal vein or arm cord. The ulnar artery lies on the ulna bone to which it adheres, becoming clearly visible above the thumb.
And the vein between the little finger and ring finger has two branches; in the leg there are three, one beneath the knee bend on the lateral side, a second is the saphenous vein located at the heel on the medial side and sciatic nerve which lies near the heel on the lateral side.
And the three veins in the other leg are similar; as for the two veins behind the ears, their bleeding is beneficial for chronic colds, migraines, tinea and chronic malignant sores of the head; and here I describe how to bleed them.
This is done by shaving the patient's head and vigorously rubbing their nape in the position of the two veins with a coarse cloth; then have them strangle their neck with a turban until the veins appear, located behind both ears at the lower part of the head; feel for them with your finger and where you can feel their pulse beneath your finger make a mark there with ink.
Then take a knife-like lancet, known as a fleam, and insert it under the vein into the skin until you reach the bone with the blade; raise your hand to lift the vein and skin upward then cut the vein along with the skin cleanly and make the length of the incision equal to two fingers pressed together.
Or, you send from the blood that amount which you desire and then bind them with bandages until they heal; however, it has been mentioned earlier in this book regarding their cutting and cauterization. As for the two arteries found in the temples (temporal arteries), they are beneficial to be opened by incision for treating chronic migraines, severe headaches, continuous inflammation of the eyes, and excessive drainage of acute humour into the eyes.
The method of their incision is as follows: the patient should tightly bind his neck with a turban, until the two arteries become prominent to touch and their pulsation becomes apparent beneath your finger; at this point you mark them with ink, then lift the skin above the artery towards its upper side using your index finger.
You insert the sharp scalpel from below and lift the artery upwards, then sever it as you did with the other two arteries; drain blood according to your needs, untie the patient's neckband, and place your finger on the artery for an hour.
Then, you place a cotton pad and a bandage on top, securing them tightly; leave it until it heals. The mention of this artery (the frontal artery) and its incision or ligation has been previously made in the beginning of this book. As for the opening of the forehead's artery, it is beneficial after the arteries of the temples have been opened to treat chronic diseases of the face such as tinea, ulcers, and unpleasant rashes.
The method of its incision is as follows: the patient should bind his neck with a turban until the artery becomes apparent, then you take the instrument known as the axe; this is its image:" [Image]
You place the protruding spike at the head of the axe on top of the artery, and strike from above using a comb or another similar object; allow blood to flow according to your needs, then untie the patient's neckband. You should secure the wound until it heals.
It can be opened with a wide scalpel, but the blade should not be sharp at the tip like other scalpels; instead, it should be slightly broad and blunt-tipped, and you should make the incision diagonally because the bone is nearby, so the thin scalpel may break if it strikes the bone.
As for the two veins located at the corners of the eyes, they are beneficial for eye ailments such as scabies, conjunctivitis, and drooping eyelids, as well as various facial diseases. To open these veins, the patient should strain their neck by tying a cloth around it; you then make an incision while standing over their head, making sure to angle the scalpel slightly towards the length of the vein and using a small, relatively wide blade.
As this area has no flesh, if the scalpel is thin-tipped it may break; instead use a thicker blade and take only as much blood as needed before placing a piece of cotton on each vein and binding them for one night. Opening the nasal vein is beneficial in cases of severe fever.
It is also useful for severe headaches and facial diseases such as acute erysipelas which appears on the nose, especially if it becomes chronic. To open this vein, have the patient strain their neck and hold their nose with your left hand while taking a long, thin scalpel in your right.
Insert the blade into the center of the nose tip, between the nasal bones and in a straight line because the vein cannot be felt there; as soon as you insert it, blood will emerge. Make sure to advance the scalpel carefully with your hand until you have taken enough blood, then bind the area for one night since it heals quickly.
Opening the veins of the temples is useful for dyspnea, early leprosy, and melancholic diseases which appear on the skin's surface such as vitiligo, impetigo, and malignant ulcers or abscesses. Have the patient tie a bandage under their neck to strain these areas; the surgeon should then stand at their head.
The patient is seated on a chair, then the vein along the calf is opened up with a fairly wide incision and an appropriate amount of blood is drained or according to what you see is required; you then do the same for the other vein before removing the bandage.
You should tie up the two veins with a medium tension so that the patient doesn't suffocate and you leave him until tomorrow, for the wound will heal; as for the four [veins] of the arm, their benefit is in being opened after opening those of the calf since it benefits against blisters on the mouth, gum disease, bad sores, cracked lips and bad sores.
Those that occur in and around the nose; how you open them is by having your patient sit in front of you, tie their neck with a cloth then turn their lips up so that you can see one vein to the right of the lip and another on its left, noting their darkness.
And note that they are surrounded by thin, dark veins which you should cut off; if it is unclear to you and you don't know what they are then aim for the largest and most prominent one; do likewise with those two in the lower lip.
As for the two veins under the tongue, their benefit is in being opened after opening those of the calf as a remedy against swellings that occur in the throat from illnesses of the uvula and mouth; how you open them is by having your patient sit facing the sun between your hands while raising his tongue to look underneath it on one side for a vein and another on its opposite, noting their dark colour.
You open them up, taking care not to cut too deeply since there are arteries underneath which may cause bleeding; as for the three veins in the elbow, they are those commonly opened by all people and their opening can be done in two ways.
Either suturing with a broad basil or olive-shaped lancet, or incising with a knife-like lancet which is called the nashl [this is its image], image of the broad basil-shaped lancet: .
It is broad, as you can see, suitable for opening thick, full, prominent veins that are clearly visible and contain thick, cloudy blood. This is the image of the olive-shaped lancet: .
This lancet is less broad and has a thinner tip, suitable for lancing thin veins that contain thin, bile-like blood. This is the image of the nashl lancet: .
This nashl is suitable for incising, and there are various types of broad and thin ones according to the width and narrowness of veins. One may use it as a guide for others, and it is well-known among craftsmen.
As for the basilic vein, which is one of these three veins, the benefit of lancing it is that it draws blood from illnesses located beneath the neck and throat towards the chest and abdomen. The lacerator should be cautious when lancing it and place it on a higher part of the neck because there is an artery underneath; if they make a mistake and go too deep with the lancet, they may cut this artery.
This would result in bleeding, so lancing should not be done with a suturing lancet but rather by incising with the nashl. If the basilic vein is not clearly visible, one should avoid it and move to another or ask for some of its branches.
Alternatively, one may lance at the location of the brachial artery as it is clearly visible and can be incised with a nashl lancet as mentioned earlier. If you wish to specifically lance this vein, you should first feel for its location in order to identify the pulse spot then mark it with ink.
Then bind the arm, make an oblique incision on the vein with a curved knife as we said before, and ensure that the cut is away from the artery. When you see, while tightening the ligature, swelling in the place which was marked with ink, then that swelling is indeed the artery, so avoid it.
If you see that the blood, when let out of a vein by an incision, spurts like urine from a boy and is thin red in color, know it to be arterial blood; so then proceed quickly, apply your finger for some time, then remove your finger, if the bleeding stops, it often does stop, bind up the arm.
Leave it, warn the patient against negligence and let him keep quiet on his neck without moving for some days until he recovers. If the bleeding does not stop despite your efforts, and no remedy is at hand in time, then cut through the artery if it can be seen; its ends will contract and the blood will cease to flow.
Or take a pistachio nut shell, cut it and use one half, bind it tightly over the vein with a ligature and bandages for another day; if bleeding stops then leave it alone otherwise treat it as mentioned before by applying styptics to stop bleeding which is not very difficult in most cases.
Know that the reason for this is the small size of the wound and the tight binding around the arm. As for the ulnar artery, its benefit from venesection is to draw blood away from both head and body because, as we said before, it is a branch composed of both the basilic vein and cephalic veins.
The person performing the venesection should be careful to be on top of the patient's neck during the procedure, as below it there is a nerve; if too much pressure is applied with the knife and this nerve is injured then numbness may occur which can be difficult to cure or even impossible in some cases. This nerve often presents itself when touched.
If the vein is hidden in some people and is thin, not easily seen, then you should make your venesection of it a simple incision with the lancet, avoiding the tendon if at all possible. If the vein lies between two tendons, incise the vein lengthwise. As for the cephalic vein, the benefit of its venesection is that it drains blood from the head.
It is beneficial for ailments of the eyes, and in this vein especially, if you wish to perform venesection, it is best done by incising with an olive-shaped lancet or a broad basilic lancet, as it is the safest of all veins because there are no arteries or nerves beneath it.
However, when performing venesection, you should avoid the head of the muscle with your lancet and aim for the softer spot; it does no harm if it is not hit on the first strike to return to it again and again, but in some people, it may swell up if it is not cut on the first strike.
But that swelling does it no harm; as for the procedure of venesection, its complications, and what should be done beforehand to remedy them, first you must know that venesection is either employed solely in maintaining health.
Or it is employed in treating diseases; now, venesection used to maintain and preserve health, and to prevent the onset of illness, should be performed on one of the three veins at the elbow: namely, the cephalic vein, the radial artery, or the basilic vein. Venesection for this purpose should take place in early spring when signs of fullness appear.
Venesection for maintaining health should take place on a Sunday or Tuesday, after three hours have passed since daybreak. However, venesection used to treat diseases has no specific time limit; rather, it is done whenever the need and necessity arise, whether night or day.
In every hour and at all times, it is not appropriate to bloodlet boys until they have reached the age of fourteen years, nor should it be done on elders who have surpassed sixty years. When someone intends to perform bloodletting for any reason...
One should clean their intestine before bloodletting with a soft enema if there is a lot of hardened excrement retained, so as not to draw towards the veins during bloodletting any noxious waste from the intestine that would harm the vital organs; nor should one be bled when they are fatigued or drunk until such time as this has passed.
One must take care not to be bled immediately following a bout of diarrhea or vomiting, after birth, when excessively fatigued by coitus, or tired from overwork, exercise, lack of sleep and fasting; whatever weakens the body physically or mentally; then you should consider whether the blood is thick before carrying out the procedure.
One should thin the blood with food, drink and medication if possible; they may enter a bath if there is no reason not to or practice some exercise so as to thin their blood; you should carry out venesection in the early part of the day as we have said and on that day try to clear your mind of all unpleasant mental distractions.
Such as worries, anger and fear; or physical factors like excessive fatigue and exertion, coitus etc.; you should prepare the room with items which people are accustomed to using such as various scents, flowers and amusements according to what is available.
Then the phlebotomist sits on a cushion which is slightly higher than that of the patient; they should rub his arm two or three times with their hand before binding it tightly around the upper arm two to three times, taking care not to pull too hard.
For when the ligature is not moderate, whether through excess and thus preventing blood flow or if too relaxed and also stopping blood flow, then after the ligature one must rub together both hands of the patient.
Until the veins become engorged and perceptible to touch, then the phlebotomist should wipe the lancet with a little old oil specifically for this purpose; he then places his left index finger on the same vein just below where he wishes to make the incision so that the vein does not dodge and thus avoid the strike. Because there are veins which you will find act like a string, dodging the strike at phlebotomy; and some are filled with air so that when the lancet is placed on them they retreat beneath it, deceiving the phlebotomist who does not open the vein properly even though he may have opened it slightly.
Therefore the phlebotomist should be certain and slow with all of this; he then lowers his lancet but if he does not open the vein at that first strike, he must repeat it just below or above the initial spot without being too hasty unless the area is swollen.
If it becomes swollen or the patient is alarmed then leave him for a day or two without applying a ligature as this may cause hot swelling; he must not go to the bathhouse either, but if after that time phlebotomy is desired again then do so, and if you thrust your lancet yet the incision was small with thin flowing blood...
And if you fear that the required amount of blood will not come out then return your lancet to the same hole, gently and straight; increase it a little but do this swiftly before the area becomes swollen for in many people an area can become swollen even from a small incision.
If you see that it has swollen, do not repeat the procedure at all for it will be of no assistance to you. Place on it some of the residue from boiled oil; this facilitates the flow of blood and is better for this location than the oil itself or other ointments. Likewise...
Use the residue from boiled oil in all your venesections of veins when there is difficulty with the flow of blood. And so may theriaca and schenzepra, if one of them is placed on the location; the blood becomes thinner and more fluid, should it be thick...
If a large swelling occurs at the location of venesection, it often does so and especially to those who have only bled once before or whose vein was opened by a small incision; immediately apply a sponge soaked in warm, slightly salted water to the swelling and bind it for an hour – it will resolve.
You should do this after all the blood has drained from that vein or another; if some blackness or greenness remains at the location after several days, it will be harmless. If you wish, apply something of dissolved gum mastic and myrrh to it.
Or something of the juice of veronica and such, a swelling often occurs with venesection of the basilic vein; place your hand on it – if you find that it yields to pressure, this is an undesirable swelling so beware of applying any of what has been mentioned above to it.
For it may bleed the blood of an artery; bind it with a styptic to harden the location then treat it with all other treatments until it heals. You should draw from each person according to their strength and the color that dominates in their blood.
If the blood is black, let it flow out until it reddens; and if you see it thick, send it forth until it thins; likewise if it is sharp, allow it to exit until its sharpness has gone; and it behooves a person who is full-blooded and strong and needs to have the blood removed in one go.
To widen the vein for bloodletting, use a broad lancet; and if the patient is weak, do the opposite. You should remove the blood in multiple sessions, and the hole should be narrow. The best instrument to use for opening the vein is one that is beveled, square-shaped, and makes an incision rather than a puncture.
This type of bloodletting is safe from excessive bleeding and damage to the nerve, and it is the best and safest way compared to vertical or horizontal cuts. If a person is accustomed to fainting during bloodletting, they should be fed some bread soaked in sour pomegranate juice or vinegar before the procedure.
If the patient is experiencing a burning sensation and blood needs to be removed three or four times, if their temperament is cold, they should consume bread soaked in wine, honey infused with spices, or basil-infused drink before each bloodletting session.
If fainting occurs during bloodletting and it is due to excessive loss of blood, the patient should be given meat broth and a light basil drink. The use of perfume with musk is recommended; its scent should be applied liberally on their chest. Other measures mentioned in the section on fainting should also be employed.
For those wishing to invigorate their arm and promote blood circulation, if the reason for bloodletting is to induce a significant amount of purging and their strength is weak, the blood should be let out in small amounts over consecutive days, according to how much they can tolerate.
For those who wish to relieve their arm and release the blood again, and if their body is strong, they should do so seven or nine hours after the initial incision. As for those who want to draw out the blood from their body towards the opposite side that has tilted, it is necessary to relieve them on the second or third day.
If there is an excess of hot and acrid blood in the body, causing a fever, it is necessary to draw out this blood in one go by extracting a large quantity and widening the opening until unconsciousness occurs after ensuring that all other conditions for venesection have been met. You should place your hand on the patient's pulse while the blood is flowing so as to prevent death occurring at the same time as unconsciousness, for this often happens when the bleeder is ignorant and careless. It is not necessary if you wish to relieve the arm and release the blood again.
If the mouth of the vein has closed and blood flow is obstructed, you should press on it firmly or twist vigorously as this is very detrimental. Instead, either leave it until you bleed again or remove with a knife blade any congealed blood from the mouth of the vein.
Or apply to it some salt dissolved in water, or some theriac, or some schichenaia and press gently until the blood flows out. If the vein has swollen, then leave it alone.
Do not touch it until the swelling subsides. If it is necessary to release blood again, you may either bleed above that spot or in the other arm or vein.
To open the vein of the arm, one should make an incision in place of the radial and ulnar arteries if they are not found or are too small to see, since it is composed from them. The procedure for this is as follows: the patient must immerse their hand in hot water until the forearm reddens and the veins become clearly visible; then a bandage should be applied above it with moderate tension.
Then make an incision in the vein with a slight oblique angle, neither across nor along it, and let the opening be wide; perform the procedure above the wrist joint slightly. If blood does not flow out, return the hand to the vessel of hot water and allow the blood to flow into the water.
Do this until you achieve your aim. If it is summer, you may not need to return the hand to the hot water; mostly this is necessary in wintertime. Opening this vein is safer than opening any other. This is because there are no major veins or nerves beneath it. Opening the radial vein on the right hand is beneficial for liver disorders. The procedure consists of tying a bandage around the wrist, or using your hand, after immersing the limb in hot water until the vein swells.
This is because there are no major veins or nerves beneath it. Opening the radial vein on the right hand is beneficial for liver disorders. The procedure consists of tying a bandage around the wrist, or using your hand, after immersing the limb in hot water until the vein swells. It will be clearly palpable to the touch; then make an oblique incision in it, and if you cut through completely this does not harm the patient at all. Be careful with your scalpel so as not to go too deep since beneath lies the nerve of the fingers and there is no flesh covering them here. After that, return the hand to the hot water.
Let it bleed freely, for if you do not return the hand to hot water, the blood will congeal in the vein's opening and stop flowing. Once you have taken out as much blood as necessary, apply some oil and salt to the vein so that it does not close too quickly.
You should treat every narrow vein in the same manner, and as for the benefit of phlebotomizing from the left hand, it is beneficial for illnesses related to the spleen. Thus you should perform phlebotomy here just as with the second [vein], they are equal. As for phlebotomizing the saphenous vein, its benefit is for diseases in the lower body such as uterine disorders.
Menstrual retention, kidney diseases, chronic ulcers of the thighs and legs, and similar illnesses can also be treated with phlebotomy. To perform this procedure, immerse your leg in hot water and massage it vigorously until the veins become engorged; then bind them above the ankle joint using a tight bandage, positioning the vein over the heel towards the thumb.
Many branches of this vein spread across the leg, so phlebotomize it at its widest point or near the heel where all its tributaries converge; this is safer and more effective. When phlebotomizing on the leg, be careful to avoid the nerves underlying the vein.
Perform the phlebotomy with a slight twist of the lancet, as if you intend to amputate it; use a sharp instrument for this purpose. If blood does not flow freely, re-immerse your leg in hot water and allow the blood to drain completely before proceeding. In case the phlebotomist misses the vein on first attempt...
...re-attempt the phlebotomy slightly higher up; this area is safer and carries less risk, provided you avoid damaging the nerve as explained earlier. You should perform the same procedure on the saphenous vein of the other leg with equal care. As for the sciatic nerve, its location, as mentioned before, is at the heel on the outer side of the foot.
Phlebotomy of this vein is beneficial for hip pain caused by hot blood. To perform the procedure, have the patient enter a bath and quickly bind their leg with a long, thin bandage from the hip to four fingers above the heel; this will make the vein prominent.
If it appears, then cauterize it in any condition that suits you - either obliquely, which is better, or by amputation or by incision. If its location is healthy and intact, it is usually very hidden in most people. If you cannot find it...
And if it is not apparent to the senses at all, cauterize some of its branches, which are those that appear on the back of the foot towards the little and ring fingers, being careful to avoid the nerves, and release as much blood as you wish.
Then release the tension, place some cotton wool on the cauterization site, and bind it tightly; it will heal quickly.

On cupping, and how to use it.
Cupping tools can be made from horns, wood, copper or glass; cupping has two forms: the first is wet-cupping where blood is drawn out, and the second is dry-cupping without incision.
This dry cupping has two forms...
They also include the temples on both sides of the neck, under the lower jaw below the mouth, shoulders, sacrum at the base of the spine, middle of upper arms, legs and calves.
Cupping draws blood from the delicate vessels spread throughout the flesh; for this reason it does not deplete the body's strength like bleeding, and cupping should therefore be used with or without fire in all diseases arising from fullness until the whole body is purged.
If need arises for bloodletting due to illness or as a customary practice, we employ it at any time, be it in the beginning of the month, its end, midway through, or whenever the situation may call for it.
For there are individuals among us whose excess blood, when left unchecked and requiring removal through bloodletting, results in a sense of heaviness and headaches. Others may experience a flushed appearance on their face, head, and neck. Some find relief in itching their faces, sides, and even develop dark circles under their eyes. And there are those who scratch at the very site of bloodletting.
Still others find themselves laughing excessively, while some detect the taste of blood in their mouths and experience bleeding gums. Blood may even be present in their saliva. Certain individuals sleep more than usual. There are those who, during sleep, envision blood, redness, corpses, and wounds akin to these. Whenever we observe any such symptoms...
Especially if these symptoms manifest during the middle third of the month, we then prescribe bloodletting after a couple or three hours have passed since daybreak. As for the benefits of bloodletting from the nape, it alleviates heaviness in the head and reduces excessive fluid flow towards the eyes.
However, it is imperative that this be done after the entire body has been purged of excess humor. This form of bloodletting may serve as an alternative to venesection at the temple. Caution must be exercised when employing this method on individuals with a cold constitution or those suffering from catarrh, for it can cause them great harm.
Hence, it should not be used on the elderly or those with cold-related ailments in their head. Overindulgence in this practice can lead to forgetfulness.
For this reason, one should instruct the barber to slightly lower the cupping glass away from the head, lest forgetfulness be induced. As for cupping at the scapula, it serves as an alternative to venesection at the ankle and wrist.
For this, it is beneficial for asthma, shortness of breath, disruption of the respiratory mechanism, coughing and congestion; a cupping session on the upper back should be performed with care as performing this too low can result in weakening of the heart and stomach.
Cupping of the carotid arteries is beneficial for headaches, eye disorders, migraines, croup and toothache; it serves as an alternative to venesection at the basilic vein, however you should instruct your cupper not to cut too deeply in case they sever an artery which would cause bleeding.
Cupping underneath the chin is beneficial for oral thrush, gum disease and other similar diseases of the mouth; it may serve as an alternative to venesection at the cheeks. Cupping on the shoulders is useful for a fluttering heartbeat caused by congestion or excess heat.
Cupping on the front of the elbows is beneficial for the same conditions as venesection at the basilic vein, cephalic vein and median antebrachial vein since it draws blood from all those smaller vessels within the flesh and drains those small veins into larger ones until the blood reaches these three thicker veins.
You should instruct your cupper not to cut too deeply as the region is devoid of much flesh and underlies nerves and arteries. Cupping with a single cup over the coccyx will benefit piles in the anus and sores on the perineum.
You should instruct your cupper to use a larger, copper cup as the region requires strong suction and a glass cup may break; this could cause further cuts in the flesh. Cupping on the legs alleviates congestion very noticeably.
For it attracts blood from all over the body and is beneficial for chronic pains in the kidneys, womb, and bladder. It aids menstruation and helps with blisters and boils. It serves as an alternative to cupping of the calves and Achilles tendon, but it greatly weakens the body and causes fainting in most people. Cupping of the Achilles tendons has a similar benefit to that of the legs.
The method of placing the cup is to first put it in place while empty and then suck it with moderate suction. Do not keep the cups in place for too long, but rather place them quickly and remove them swiftly so that the humors are drawn towards the site evenly. Keep repeating this action continuously until you see that the area has turned red and opened up.
Once you see the redness of blood, make an incision and resume sucking slowly. Then consider the state of the bodies; for those with soft flesh and loose pores, only one incision should be made lest the area become ulcerated.
Instruct the cupper to widen the incision and deepen it slightly, adjusting the suction gently with light movement. If the blood is thick, two incisions should be made; the first to create a pathway for the thinner parts of the blood, and the second to extract the thicker blood.
If the blood is very cloudy, repeat the incision a third time to reach its limit. In general, if we wish to extract little blood, one incision suffices; but for more blood, multiple incisions are required, especially if we suspect thick blood.
A deep incision should be made, with the moderate limit being just through the skin. We must consider which oils to use when placing cups, and which waters to avoid for the cupped person. For those with thick, hard, dry skin and narrow pores...
One should apply ointments to the cupping sites, using opening, softening and dissolving oils such as oil of marjoram, violet oil, sweet almond oil or pumpkin seed oil if it is summer time.
If it is winter, oils such as narcissus oil, iris oil, chamomile oil or lily oil should be used; if the excess [humors] are thick and cold then use mugwort oil, rue oil, pine oil or dill oil.
If the person undergoing cupping has wide pores and soft flesh, one should avoid using ointments; they should wash their cupped areas after cupping with rose water or cold water or gooseberry water or pumpkin water or purslane water.
For those with moist blood, the cupped areas should be washed with vinegar or myrtle and sumac water; if their humors are thick, use old wine, mugwort water, dill broth or chamomile water. One must take caution when having a cupping session in a bathhouse or immediately after bathing.
Instead, it should be performed one or two hours after leaving the bathhouse; a person undergoing cupping must not sleep afterwards. Here is what should be done by those having dry-cupping and wet-cupping before and after the procedure.
One should first assess if the person is choleric and their blood is predominantly acrid and inflammatory; in this case, one must take refrigerants such as pomegranates and dandelion with vinegar, lettuce, vinegar of vinegar (syrup of violets) and julep. Their diet should include broths made from capons or mutton, salads and similar.
For those of a cold temperament, it is advisable to drink mead, mibi wine or sengkangebin bzori and consume aromatic medium vintage wine, which falls between old and new vintages. They should be instructed to eat less and include chicks, sparrows, pigeons, and partridges in their diet. On the day of a venesection or bloodletting, drink more than you eat.
In some cases, it may be necessary to administer triacle, musk medicine or shelltha to certain people before bloodletting or venesection, or afterward, in order to strengthen the principal organs and thin the blood. It should not be given to those of a hot temperament.
Unscratched cups are used on the liver, spleen, breasts, abdomen, navel, kidney region, and hip joint because these organs cannot withstand scratching. The purpose is either to draw blood from one organ to another.
Placing cups on the breasts in cases of nosebleeds, or to release cold air trapped in an organ, as when we place cups on the abdomen and navel, they loosen the organ, warm it up, and alleviate pain by dispersing that air.
Cups may be placed on the kidneys if a blockage or stone is present, as their strong suction force might open the blockage or dislodge the stone from its position. Similarly, they are used on the liver and spleen to deal with gas, which cups loosen and warm to alleviate pain. These unscratched cups can be used simply for suction.
They may be used with fire or filled with warm water for cases of sciatica. The cup, which should be large, is filled with hot water alone or with water in which suitable herbs have been boiled.
Then it is placed full on the spot and held in place, then removed and replaced repeatedly as needed. This is an illustration of a fire syringe:.
Its mouth should be the size of two open fingers, as illustrated, and its depth is half a span. At about the middle of one side there should be a small hole large enough for a needle to pass through. It can be made from tin or yellow copper with a thick rim.
It should be smooth, flat and polished to avoid injuring the limb when placed upon it. In the middle there is a crossbar of copper or iron where the wax candle sits when lit. This fire syringe can also be made in larger sizes than described here or smaller according to what is required.
The diameter of the piston should be adapted to the patient's age and condition; fire syringes for children or emaciated patients are different from those used on robust adults. To use this fire syringe with heat on a limb, first light a tightly-woven linen wick or small pitch candle. Place it in the middle of the copper cylinder at the centre of the syringe.
This ensures the fire rises upwards towards the bottom of the syringe, away from the patient's body, so it does not get burned. Then place the syringe on the limb and cover the small hole we mentioned with your finger until you are ready to remove it.
Steam will then escape from that hole and the piston should loosen in its housing. Relight the wick as required and replace it if necessary. A water syringe used for treating shingles does not have a copper cylinder or a hole.
It is simply filled with water and placed on the limb. This is an illustration of such a syringe:.
This is the syringe; the larger it can hold a greater volume of water, the better.
Chapter 77.
On the use of leeches.
Leeches are mainly used in cases where it is not possible to apply cups due to the small size of certain body parts, such as the lips and gums, or when the affected area lacks sufficient flesh, like fingers and the nose.
The method of using leeches involves selecting those found in fresh, clean water free from any contamination. They are then left for a day and night in fresh water to ensure they are hungry and their stomachs are empty. The body is first purged by means of venesection or cupping, and the affected area is then cleaned.
Once the leech is placed on the affected area, it will fill with blood and fall off. If possible, suck out any remaining fluid from the wound using a cup. Otherwise, clean the area with vinegar followed by water, then massage and squeeze it. Should bleeding continue after the leech has fallen away, indicating excessive discharge, apply a cold, damp cloth to the site.
The cloth is placed over the wound until discharge ceases. If bleeding persists, apply powdered botargate or oak gall or similar astringents to stem the flow; alternatively, place peeled broad bean halves on the site.
Leave the broad beans in place until they adhere to the wound, at which point bleeding should stop. If leeches must be reapplied, use fresh ones if available; do not reuse previous leeches. Should a leech refuse to attach itself, clean the area with fresh blood.
When you insert a needle into the site until some blood emerges and then place [the medicine], if she feels something of the blood, it will adhere to the position. If you wish for it to fall off, sprinkle on it something of aloe or salt or ashes, and it shall fall at that very spot.
Chapter Three.
In algebra.
This chapter is also essential to what is needed in the practice of medicine, which is setting fractures and dislocations of bones.
Know, O my sons, that this chapter is claimed by the ignorant among physicians and laypeople, those who have never browsed an ancient book on it nor read a single letter from one.
For this reason, this art of knowledge has become non-existent in our country, and I have never come across anyone skilled in it at all. I acquired what I have of it only through lengthy reading of the books of the ancients and careful study to understand them until I extracted that knowledge from them, then I practiced and trained throughout my life.
I have outlined for you in this chapter all that is within the scope of my knowledge. My experience with it has gone beyond what I have presented to you, after having brought it close to you and purified it from the complexities of lengthiness and abbreviated it to the utmost brevity, made it clear to the utmost clarity, and depicted for you many images of the instruments used in it.
For this is from an increase in clarity, as I did in the previous two chapters, and there is no strength but by Allah, the Most High, the Almighty.
Chapter One.
There are maxims and comprehensive statements regarding bone fractures, which must be presented first. Before we start mentioning the broken and dislocated body parts individually, it is necessary to mention some general principles at the beginning of this chapter. It requires that you, as well as anyone keen on learning this noble profession, understand and grasp its true nature first and foremost.
Thus, I say that whenever a fracture or dislocation occurs in any part of the body, one should hasten to apply venesection and/or purgatives, or both, immediately. Unless there is a contraindication, such as debilitation or if the patient who suffered the injury is a child or an elderly person; unless it is extremely hot or very cold weather indeed.
Then, one should restrict their diet to cold legumes and poultry or goat meat, abstaining from alcoholic beverages, fatty meats, over-eating, and any nourishment that tends to increase the blood volume in the veins until there is no fear of swelling nor concern about an influx of fluid into the affected area.
At this point, the patient should return to their initial regimen as per their usual practice; once they see that the broken bone is beginning to heal and knit back together, it is appropriate for them to nourish themselves with highly nutritious dense food such as porridges, rice, headmeat and trotters, cow's tripe. And eggs, soft fish, strong alcoholic drinks and the like; with this regimen, bone healing is faster and stronger. Bear in mind that broken bones of sturdy men or elderly people will never heal back together exactly as they were before the fracture, but they can knit nonetheless.
Their bones became thinner and harder, and what was once connected and fused together were the softest of bones, like those of young children. However, nature grows around the broken bone on all sides a substance similar to glue which is thick and adheres, binding and tightening it until one piece adheres to another.
It binds some to the other until it becomes incredibly strong and secure, just as it was originally, so that nothing hinders its function.
For this reason, the patient's diet should consist of foods that are dense, sticky, and thick, as we have said. And know that fractures can vary according to the different types of bones, for a fracture of the shinbone differs from that of the skull, and so on.
Similarly, all the other bones differ from each other; we shall come to mention every type of fracture and explain it in its own chapter, distinct from others. The nature of a bone fracture can also vary within itself.
It may be a simple fracture without splintering, or it could run the length of the bone with splinters and protruding fragments; sometimes there is also an associated skin wound. Fractures can also occur as a minor crack.
Each type of fracture has its own specific method of repair, as will be explained in detail later. A broken bone can be identified by its deformity, swelling, and sensitivity to the touch; it may also produce a crackling sound when pressed with the hand.
If there is no obvious deformity, no crackling sound, no sensitivity or disturbance felt when palpating the bone, and the patient experiences only mild pain, then it is not a fracture but rather a sprain or minor crack which should not be manipulated by stretching or pressing.
Now apply to it the medicines which will be mentioned later on that suit the location, then bind it gently, and know that if a bone is broken into two pieces without shattering or splintering, but has moved apart from its counterpart.
You should proceed immediately to align and straighten it before it becomes a hot swelling, but if a hot swelling occurs then leave it for a few days until the swelling subsides, then straighten it with any degree of gentleness and cunning that you can.
Know that its consolidation and straightening is easier than for a bone with splinters, then it should be bound as will be mentioned later; if there are splinters in the bone then the broken limb must be stretched from both sides, whether it is an arm or leg.
Either by hand if the limb is small, or with two ropes, or a rope and a hand; place the limb on an even surface in its natural shape so that when the broken bone parts are stretched then you can reset those protrusions into their places with all your skill at cunning and gentleness.
Try your best to avoid causing the patient pain or anguish by what you do, and strain every effort to join one bone to its fellow in the best possible way; at that time you must touch and feel them with your hand, for if you find anything awry then correct it and straighten it as best you can.
Beware of stretching too hard or using excessive force as many ignorant people do, and often their actions cause a hot swelling or permanent injury to the limb, something I have witnessed numerous times from their practice.
Then, after making it level, perfect and tight, keep that organ still and quiet; warn the patient not to move it while awake or asleep, when shifting positions, in a state of agitation, during defecation, and at all times of movement as much as possible, being careful to ensure that the organ's position is one where pain can be avoided.
For when the patient feels pain or discomfort in any position, they should move it to another that causes no pain; being careful again to ensure the organ is level and straight.
Otherwise, the organ may become crooked if forced; and as for how to tighten a broken organ: know that these organs differ in their size, shape, and form - those which are small, such as the arm, finger, or forearm.
Thus, for smaller organs, the strips of cloth should be soft and gentle; while for larger ones such as the thigh, back or chest, the wraps must be broad and firm since wide bindings hold a large organ firmly in place and tighten it equally on all sides without fault.
Once you have finished levelling, begin by applying the appropriate plaster. On a soft and tender spot near the break, begin to apply plaster; then start binding with three or four wraps directly over the fracture itself, tightening your hand slightly with each wrap before moving up towards the upper part of the injury.
But as you move away from the fracture, ease up on the tightness gradually until you reach a point that is just right; then take another bandage and bind it over the broken spot once more.
Bandages are applied, then the bandage is taken to the lower side of the fracture and its tension should be adjusted as mentioned previously for the upper one. Then, between the bandages, some soft padding or cloth is placed to even out the angulation of the fracture.
If there is no angulation, then nothing should be placed [between the bandages]. Another bandage is wrapped around it and on these bandages plaster splints are applied firmly from your side if there is no puffiness or hot swelling in the member.
If there is puffiness or hot swelling, then apply something to alleviate the latter and eliminate the former and leave it for some days; then tighten the splints upon it. The splints should be made of wide halves of reeds that have been carved carefully, or they may be made of wooden grille slats.
which are made of pine, palm leaves, heather, or madder and the like of what is available thereof; and each splint should be of this size, shape, and form.
except that the splint which is placed directly on the fracture itself should be slightly thicker and wider than the other splints; as for the length of the splint, it should be made according to what suits the broken member in terms of its size being large or small. Illustration of a splint: [image].
Then another bandage is tightened over the splints in exactly the same way as the first one; then it is tied from above with tight threads according to what we mentioned about tension, which is that your tightening should be on the site of fracture more than elsewhere. And the further away from the fracture, the less the tension.
The threads should be of medium thickness and fineness, and they should be made from wet linen especially. For if the threads are thick, as I have seen some ignorant people do with their threads made from braided linen strips, it is a great mistake.
Because the tension with them is beyond moderation; and fine threads are also not suitable because you cannot achieve the desired tension with them. There should be no less than a finger's width between one splint and another.
If the patient is injured by the ends of the splints after they have been properly tightened, then place underneath them some soft padding or loose wool so that it does not harm him in any way. But if there is a fracture along with a wound and the skin has been pierced, we shall come to this separately.
Be aware that not every broken limb should be put into splints on the first day, for if it is a large limb, splints ought to be applied only after five or seven days - or longer - depending on how sure you are about avoiding acute swelling.
This is the description of the bandages that were formerly used to treat fractures, dislocations and contusions: a brief generic bandage for treating fracture, suitable for most temperaments - especially boys and women - because it does not become unbearably hot or cold.
Take the mill dust, which is the flour clinging to the walls of the mill when it is set in motion; mix this as is without sifting and knead it with egg white until you have a paste that is neither thick nor thin. Then roll out the dough.
A description of another dressing that forces fracture, dislocation and bruise; take mastic, ladanum, acacia, rasin, gallnuts, pitch: each ten drachms; myrrh and aloe: each five drams; sloes twenty drachms; Armenian or Roman clay: twenty drachms. All are pounded and mixed with sloe water or egg whites if the patient's temperament is hot, then this dressing may be used; it has a good composition, quickly setting broken bones and suitable for most people due to its moderation.
A description of another dressing that is also beneficial for fracture and bruise: take gallnuts, psyllium, white marshmallow, each ten drachms; myrrh and aloe, each five drams; acacia six drachms; Armenian clay twenty drachms; pound all very fine, sift and knead with water or egg whites, then apply.
A description of a dressing for joints and bones that have moved from their places; it soothes pain associated with this, bone splinters, and fractures: take grey wool, soak in vinegar and cooked oil, apply to the site; this dressing does not have bone-setting power.
But it is excellent for soothing hot swellings and driving off pains especially: a description of another dressing that sets broken bones: take the leaves of the fig-tree, and the leaves of wild poppy; pound both together and dress while moist; a description of an abbreviated dressing to be used when bone fracture has set.
And if you wish to disperse the rest of a swelling, take marshmallow root, chamomile, violets, and caraway seeds; each in equal parts: pound all together and knead with liniment unless the part is sensitive, then use coriander water or plain water.
Description of another dressing, more powerful in its ability to dissolve [humors], which is used when there is a hard swelling upon the union of bones: take from each one part of marshmallow root, flaxseed, fenugreek, crown of the king, chamomile flowers, violet flowers and marjoram.
All of these [ingredients] are ground and kneaded with aloe vera juice or sweet water, or with paint; whichever according to the warmth of the limb and its fiery nature; however, Hippocrates does not mention in his book that it should be placed on a broken bone when it is set.
Except for the caustic [medicated plaster], made solely of wax and oil, he describes it as being medium between thick and thin; however, Galen recommends that things containing dryness with a touch of heat such as myrrh, aloe vera, frankincense, etc., be placed on the broken limb when setting it.
Description of a dressing beneficial for weakness and pain: take gum tragacanth, chickpeas, human hair cut up or bird feathers, marshmallow root, and salt in equal parts; grind them, sift them, then knead [them] and dress [the wound]; as to the amount that the bandage should remain...
... then remove it: you should examine the patient; if there is no pain, itching or movement of the broken bone from its place, then do not remove [the dressing] for many days; however, if there is severe itching in that area or disturbing pain or swelling...
Then promptly remove it at the right time without any delay whatsoever and move the dressing away from him; then take a soft cloth or fresh sea-sponge, moistened with tepid water, immerse [it] in lukewarm water and wash that place until the itching calms down and pain subsides; then leave the limb to rest for an hour.
Then you should apply padded wool, soaked in vinegar and oil or rosewater essence, and bandage it overnight until the hot swelling subsides, the member's pulsation calms down, and the pain vanishes. Then return to a light traction with a gentle dressing, not as tight as before.
Be gentle with the member until it is healed; if you see that the swelling, redness, pain and pulsation have all disappeared but still need dressing and traction then return to what you did first; equal in its manner. If none of these symptoms appear on the member, then do not bother doing anything mentioned above.
Do not remove it except after three, four, five or seven days; sometimes twenty days can be left in place depending on the member's condition as we have mentioned until if bone union is required and flesh fusion approaches.
Then increase the traction more than before and also thicken the diet of the patient beyond what has been mentioned, if you see that the fracture site has dried out and weakened more than it should know then that food is prevented from reaching this location.
Soak it with lukewarm water when you remove the dressing every three days and ease up on traction a little; doing so makes food reach the member quickly, thus aiding in quick recovery. As for what is done by amateurs among bone setters of breaking the member again..
If it doesn't heal properly the first time and heals with a misalignment, this is an error on their part; great deception! Had this been correct, previous generations would have noted it in their books and practiced upon it but I've seen no trace of any such thing from anyone amongst them whatsoever. And it is right that this should not be performed.
Chapter Two.
In accidental fracture of the head.
There are numerous types of accidental head fractures, with varying shapes and causes. One type is caused by a sword strike, which may result in the complete shattering of the bone down to the periosteum underneath. As the adze does with wood.
This type of fracture, characterized by the bone being completely shattered like wood by an adze, is hence called "adze-like." Alternatively, the sword may only cut through part of the bone and chip its surface without penetrating all the way through; this kind of fracture is referred to as an "absolute avulsion," with the resulting wound being either large or small.
Another type of fracture is "crushing" or "contusion," caused by a blow from a rock, a fall onto a stone, or the like. This fracture may either penetrate close to the membrane beneath the bone or remain on its surface.
The wound resulting from these fractures can also be either large or small. There is another type of fracture, a slight fissure hidden within the bone's thinness akin to that of hair.
This type is named "hair-like" due to this reason. Another fracture occurs from a fall or rock impact, where a piece of the bone is driven inward, causing an indentation similar to that seen on a copper pot after being struck.
This phenomenon is most commonly observed in the skulls of children, whose bones are softer. All these fracture types may have splintered or un-splintered fragments, and we will discuss their treatment in detail later. We identify all these fracture types through careful examination.
Inspect it with probes and remove the rotten flesh from it, and as for the fleshy type, it is known by exposing the bone, wiping it clean, and applying ink to it; if there is a fracture, it will appear black. As for treating the fracture, first consider the symptoms of the patient.
If you observe symptoms that clearly indicate fear, such as vomiting bile, prostration, loss of reason, loss of voice, fainting, acute fever, bulging and reddening eyes, and the like, do not approach or treat the patient; death will inevitably befall them in most cases with these symptoms.
If you encounter symptoms that do not alarm you and believe the patient will recover, then begin their treatment. This is when the injured person comes to you soon after the injury, especially during the winter days.
You should strive to remove the bone before the fourteenth day under any circumstances. If it is during the summer days, you must hasten the removal of the bone before the seventh day, lest the membrane beneath the bone becomes corrupted and presents the symptoms we have described.
If the bone fracture has reached the membrane covering the brain and is accompanied by crushing and bruising, you must cut away the crushed and bruised part as I shall describe: shave the head of the injured patient.
Expose the bone in any way that is feasible and according to the shape of the wound, choosing the method that causes the least distress to the patient. If you encounter bleeding or a hot swelling during exposure, treat it accordingly.
Pack the wound with cloth soaked in rose wine and oil; cleanse it to ease the swelling and prevent bleeding. Then proceed to remove the bone, which can be done in one of two ways.
As for the single-faced saw, you must cut the bone with a fine-toothed, narrow-bladed saw. This is its image.
Then you use another saw after this one, which is slightly wider. This is its image.
Then you also use another saw, which is wider than the second one. Indeed, you must have several different saws, some being wider and some shorter, all very sharp at their edges. They should be made of Indian iron or good steel.
Use gentle blows when striking the saw to prevent shaking and damaging the head. If the bone is strong and hard, you should first drill around it before using the saws with drills they call non-diving drills.
Because they do not go beyond the limit of the skull bone to what is behind it, due to the drill having a round edge below its sharp head, resembling a ring or small circle, which prevents it from diving and penetrating beyond the thickness of the bone.
You should have a large number of these drills, each suitable for the thickness of that bone, so that you are prepared with a drill whose sharp edge matches the length and width according to the skull's thickness. Here are images of three types. Of the drills, there is large, medium, and small.
As for the way to drill around the broken bone, place the drill on the bone and turn it with your fingers until you feel that the bone has been penetrated. Then move the drill to another spot, leaving a space between each hole equivalent to the thickness of a rod or something similar.
Then cut with scissors between each pair of holes, doing so as gently as you can, as we have said, until the bone is removed either by hand or with something else from among the tools prepared for this.
Like forceps and fine hooks, you should be very careful that the trephine or scissors do not touch any of the peritoneum. Once you have drilled out the bone and removed it from the peritoneum if it was attached to it, you must then strip it.
You should smooth any roughness left in the bone with another instrument similar to scissors but it must be thinner and finer than the other scissors. If there are any small pieces of bone or fragments, you can remove them gently using one of your instruments.
Then you should treat the wound with sutures and ointments, which will be mentioned later. The other method is very simple and without risk. Galen mentions it and praises it greatly; these are his words. You should start by exposing the bone in the area where the fracture is most severe and noticeable. Once you have exposed that part, place the tip of this lenticular scissors underneath it. This is an image of it:
The lenticular part of it is smooth and does not cut anything, while the sharp part has edges running along its length as you can see. This allows the lenticular part to rest on the peritoneum with the sharp edge of the scissors facing the bone. You then strike the scissors from one side.
With a small hammer, strike the scissors gently to cut through all of the bone as it rotates. While doing this, you are safe from damaging the membrane; there is no risk at all, even if the surgeon is the most unskilled and cowardly person, or even drowsy.
If there remains any membrane attached to the bone, in some places of the bone, gently scrape it away with the edge of the same lenticular scalpel and remove it carefully; for it will separate from it without injury or fear.
If the bone fracture has not penetrated the membrane and only its surface is broken, leaving roughness and small fragments, you should smooth out that roughness and extract those fragments with fine chisels of various sizes, so that you can use in each place the most suitable and appropriate one according to what the operation requires.
The same bone and its shape: you should use the widest chisels first to smooth out the bone, then use finer ones after that, and continue doing so until you arrive at using the finest and thinnest of them all.
As for the other small fissures and fine fractures, you should treat each one according to what will repair it - something that is not hidden from anyone with even a little skill in this craft who has read and understood what we have written about major fractures.
If the membrane remains exposed after removing the bone, you should take a piece of linen cloth as large as the wound, soak it in rose oil, and place it over the opening; then take another folded or triangular cloth. Soak this cloth in a mixture of rose oil and wine, place it on top of the first cloth, and do so as gently as possible to avoid burdening the membrane; then use a wide bandage above it without tightening it beyond what is needed to hold the wound together.
Leave it with this treatment for a day or two until the hot swelling subsides, then remove it and use afterward medicines that are more drying, such as iris roots, flour of caraway, powdered benzoin, and mezereon among others; these are made into powders.
Sprinkle the powder on the wound as it is dry. In general, use a medicine that cleanses without burning and take great care to keep the wound clean, free from grease or dirt, and prevent any pus from forming.
Because if pus gathers over the brain's membrane, it will corrupt and rot it, causing great harm to the patient. This can happen in the skull cavity when bone is removed, especially if treatment is neglected.
If there is any blackening on its surface and the patient presents with the symptoms we mentioned, then know that he will surely die. Unless this blackening was caused by a medicine applied to it and this medicine had the power to cause such blackening.
You should take one part honey and three parts rose oil, mix them well, spread it on a cloth, then place this on the skull cavity before treating with the appropriate medicine until healed.

On setting a broken nose.
Know that only the upper parts of the nose, both or one, can break as these are bone; the lower part is cartilage and can only be bruised, bent, or flattened.
If one side of it is broken, you should insert your little finger into the nostril and align that fracture from within with your index finger and thumb from without until the nose returns to its natural shape. Be gentle in doing this, and take care not to cause pain to the patient.
If the fracture is at the top of the nose and you cannot reach it with your finger, it should be aligned using a slightly thick rod. If the fracture occurs on both sides, do likewise. The setting must take place on the first day of the fracture.
If that is not possible, then after the seventh or tenth day when the hot swelling subsides, you should insert a wick made of linen cloth into the nostril; if the fracture is on one side, use one wick; if it is on both sides, use two wicks.
The wicks should be thick enough to fill the nostril. Some early orthopedists suggested wetting the wicks with butter and changing them daily, but I do not agree; instead, they should be moistened with egg white mixed with flour.
Then you should leave the wicks in place until the bone is stabilized and the cartilage has hardened. You may also insert goose feather quills, wrapped in soft cloth, into the nose in the place of the wicks; this provides a stronger restraint for the broken nose, and it also allows the patient to breathe more easily.
This step is not essential, but you may do it if you wish; alternatively, you can use wicks. If a hot swelling occurs during your work, apply a compress to the nose made of qirouti or cotton dipped in vinegar and rose oil, or some ointment of diakylion.
If there is no hot swelling, then it should be treated externally with fine semolina flour and myrrh powder mixed with egg white, after which a soft dressing is applied, and do not bandage the nose at all; if the nasal bones are broken in small pieces.
If they are broken into small pieces, then it is necessary to make an incision and remove them with the appropriate instrument; after which you stitch up the wound and treat it with ointments that promote healing and closure of the wound. If there is an internal injury in the nose, it must be treated with sutures and lead pipes should be used. until it heals.
Chapter four.
On the setting of lower jaws if they break.
If the lower jaw is broken without an open wound, and if the fracture is external only, with no break in two pieces or depression inward, then identifying it will be easy.
If the fracture is on the right side, insert the index finger of your left hand into the patient's mouth; and if it is on the left side, use the index finger of your right hand to gently lift the bump caused by the break from inside towards outside.
If the jawbone has broken into two pieces, you must use traction from both sides to realign it until it is straight and even; if there are any injuries to the teeth as well, they should also be treated.
If the teeth are loose, they should be extracted and then reattached using gold or silver wire; an incision is made in the broken jaw to place gold foil inside it before applying a bandage over that area of the jaw with a folded cloth underneath. A large splint or piece of leather shoe sole matching the length of the jaw would be used on top of this layer as a final measure for stability and support during recovery process. Then you bind it from above according to how you see fit, so that the binding is tight enough to hold but not too tight as to cause disruption and order the patient to rest and be still. You should make sure their diet consists of soft porridge. If you suspect any change in shape or form has occurred then immediately untie the bandage on day three.
Then you bind it from above according to how you see fit, so that the binding is tight enough to hold but not too tight as to cause disruption and order the patient to rest and be still. You should make sure their diet consists of soft porridge. If you suspect any change in shape or form has occurred then immediately untie the bandage on day three. You then repair the dressing with flour of the mill and egg white, or with semolina powder after removing the splint from it. You place on top a soft cloth, as long as that dressing adheres to it and there is no change in the condition of the bone you can leave it.
Do not remove it until the wound heals and the fracture has set. Often, this can take three weeks. If during that time a hot swelling appears then treat it as we have mentioned several times before to reduce inflammation.
If the fracture is accompanied by a wound, you must first examine it to see if there are any bone fragments present and treat them accordingly. Gently extract those fragments using an appropriate instrument. If the opening of the wound is narrow then use a scalpel to widen it as much as necessary.
Once you have extracted all the bone fragments, then close the wound if it is wide and apply an appropriate ointment to it. Stitch the wound until it heals.
Chapter Five.
On the setting of a broken clavicle.
The clavicle most commonly breaks at the front near its acromial end, and there are three types of fracture that can occur: a simple, complete break without any fragments; a comminuted fracture with two large pieces; or a fracture with several small bone fragments.
If there are fragments in the fracture, which is more difficult to set, or if the fracture is accompanied by a wound, then the treatment if the fracture is not associated with a wound is as follows: you should have two servants present; one of them holds the humerus next to the broken clavicle while the other extends the neck towards the opposite side.
Then you should align the fracture with your fingers until its shape is as it ought to be, without any bumps or bends. If you need more extension, you should place a ball of rags or wool under the patient's armpit.
The bone should be of the size you need. You extend and lift the clavicle, pressing the ball with your hand until the fracture is aligned as it ought to be. If you cannot pull the end of the clavicle outwards because it has moved deeper, then the patient should lie on their back.
A medium-sized pillow should be placed under their shoulder, and the servant presses down on their shoulder until the clavicle bone that has moved deeper rises upwards. Then you can proceed to fix the fracture, aligning it with your fingers.
If you feel that a fragment of the clavicle has broken off and is moving, then it should be incised upon, and that fragment should be gently removed. If the fragment is lodged within the bone, then maneuver to cut it with one of the cutters prepared for that purpose. Once the instrument to protect the pleura is placed beneath the clavicle, which is an instrument made of wood or iron and this is its image:
It resembles a spoon without a bend, its width according to the size of the bone, large or small. As for its length, it should also be suitable for the task at hand. Let it have two ends as you see; one end is wider and the other narrower.
If the wound hole that you have opened for extracting a bone splinter is wide and you feel safe from the hot inflammation, then bring together the lips of the wound with stitches. If the hole is small or if you fear the hot inflammation, pack the wound with lint and bandages according to the size of the incision.
If a hot inflammation appears, moisten the hole with rose oil and vinegar or wine, and apply a dressing to it. As for binding bones in place if there is no wound nor incision, you should use a dressing made from millstone powder mixed with egg white. You should place soft padding over it, then a pillow under the armpit if required. Take a very long turban, about an inch wide or so, and place a folded bandage on top of the padding and dressing. Then take a splint made from thin wood. It should be three fingers wide and the same in length, then wrap it with a cloth, followed by wrapping both the cloth and splint together into the turban at the site of the fracture. Then secure the turban around the fracture as you would normally wind it. Place it around the neck, under the right armpit and also under the affected armpit, then wind it back and forth over each side several times as you see fit to ensure that the fracture is secured in place properly.
Your priority throughout should be to ensure that the splint does not move away from over the broken bone. For this reason, you should check on the patient daily and whenever you see that the bandage has loosened or moved away from over the broken bone then rectify it by tightening the bandage again. Then ensure that they sleep on their back with a small pillow under the affected armpit at night.
The patient's arm is tied to his neck, raising the broken clavicle along with the shoulder. The bandages are not removed until twelve days have passed without any incident of itching or swelling at the fracture site.
Then change the bandage if you see fit to do so. Apply traction to the fracture site, and leave it until the clavicle heals and consolidates over a period of twenty-eight days. Some people may take less time to heal than others.
Chapter six.
On the setting of a broken shoulder. The shoulder is rarely fractured at its widest part; rather, it is the bones that comprise the shoulder which are prone to fracture. By palpating the injured area one can identify whether or not there is indeed a break present and this will guide how one proceeds to set such fractures.
Set the bone back into its normal position using whichever technique is best suited to the fracture. Then, pack the area with ground flour mixed with egg white and a soft poultice, place a pad of folded cloth above this, then secure in place with a broad splint made from wood.
If the splint is narrower than the shoulder or slightly wider, and if there are any bumps underneath it in the area of the shoulder, then smooth these out with a soft poultice until the splint sits evenly across the shoulder. Then secure this from above using a long bandage.
The bandage should be tightly secured and one must ensure that the splint does not move from its position. One must check the dressing daily; each time the bandage loosens, it should be tightened once more, and the splint repositioned if it has slipped out of place. The patient should lie on his healthy side, and a shoulder fracture will typically heal over twenty days.
If it takes one day or twenty-five days, once this period is complete, you can safely remove the bandage as there should be no fear of fracturing or disturbing the bone, which is strong and resilient. However, if a fragment of bone protrudes and punctures the skin, make an incision to expose it and carefully extract the splinter. Apply the same treatment for fractures of the collarbone, addressing any hot swelling that may occur.
Chapter Seven.
On the repair of broken ribs.
The chest can fracture in the middle, which is less common, but more frequently fractures occur at the ends and splinter into fragments. Symptoms of a central fracture include the lower part tilting downwards accompanied by severe pain, difficulty breathing, and coughing.
Perhaps blood is coughed up, and the depression in the broken bone is visible to the touch. To repair it, have the patient lie on their back with a pillow under their shoulders. Then press down on their shoulder blades while bringing their ribs together gently by hand from both sides, doing your best to realign them smoothly.
Adjust until the bone regains its proper shape, then apply a bandage and splint made of light wood such as willow or heather wrapped in cloth. Gently secure the splint to the broken bone, ensuring it does not move. Wrap the bandage around in circles several times, securing it tightly but carefully. Check the bandage regularly and tighten it whenever necessary.
If necessity requires its removal due to a sore or pain that appears in the wound, proceed with removing it promptly. Extract the dressing and treat any issues that arise according to the necessary treatment protocol. Then reapply the dressing if deemed appropriate. Treat it head on, applying firm pressure until the wound heals.
Chapter Eight.
In the setting of broken ribs, be aware that fractures occur in thick parts adjacent to the back and at their front ends; this is because they are cartilaginous. This fact should not escape detection upon palpation with your fingers.
Set the fracture by aligning it with your fingers to achieve the correct position, then dress and splint the broken bone if needed. If the ribs are fractured inwards, this can result in severe pain for the patient.
And puncture it like a puncture that occurs in someone with an internal thorn; this is due to the bone piercing the diaphragm. It can also result in shortness of breath, coughing and spitting up blood - these symptoms are difficult to treat. The ancients employed many clever methods for dealing with such cases.
Some have said that the patient's diet should include foods which cause gas and wind to generate bloating, expanding the abdomen outwardly in order for the fracture to heal; we reject this idea as it may exacerbate a hot swelling if one is present or cause one to occur if not already present.
Others have suggested applying a cupping scarifier to the affected area, then extracting with force; this is reasonable but risks drawing fluid into the wound due to its weakened state. Some have also proposed covering the site with wool soaked in hot oil.
And the sutures become prominent between the ribs until they are filled, making the ligament level when you wrap it around in a circle. Then treat the patient with dietary and medicinal treatment for fracture, but if the patient finds this very difficult to bear. And the bone was piercing the diaphragm, causing harm and we feared for the patient. Thus, we should make an incision over the site and expose the broken rib, then place beneath it the instrument that protects the peritoneum which was described earlier, and cut the bone carefully before removing it.
Then we suture the lips of the wound if it is large, and treat it with ointments until healing occurs. If a hot swelling appears during this time, then quickly soak some dressings in rose oil and place them over the site. Also, treat the patient internally with medicines that reduce swelling.
They should lie on their side, whichever is less painful for sleeping, until healing occurs.
Chapter 9.
On setting broken vertebrae of the back and neck.
As for the bones of the neck, if they incur a fracture - which is rare but most commonly due to contusion - and you wish to know whether the patient will heal or not... Look at the patient's hands: if you see them relaxed, numb and lifeless, unable to move or extend/clench, such that when you prick them with a needle they feel no pain nor any sensation therein - then know in most cases they will not heal but die.
If they can move their hands and feel them when pricked/prodded, then know the spinal cord is intact and the patient will heal with treatment. If the vertebrae of the back are affected in a similar manner, and you wish to know if they too will heal...
Examine his legs; if you see that they have relaxed and developed the same symptoms as the hands, then when he lies on his back, wind and stool are discharged involuntarily, and when he lies on his belly, urine is discharged involuntarily. And if he lies on his back and wishes to urinate but is unable, then know that he will die; do not trouble yourself with treating him. If none of these symptoms present themselves, the case would be less severe. The treatment for what has occurred is to aim to reduce the hot swelling.
Apply rose oil, or roast egg yolks and apply them to the injured vertebrae three times a day until the hot swelling subsides; then use one of the strengthening dressings that dry out [the area], bind it tightly with bandages, and instruct him in rest.
He should only sleep on the side that does not cause him pain until he is healed. If there was a splinter or some such injury to the bone and it has now sealed over, then you must cut open the skin and remove this bone. Then you must sew together the lips of any large wound, then treat it with healing ointments until it is healed. If the last bone of the coccyx, or tailbone, has been broken, then insert your left thumb into his anus.
With your other hand, align the broken bone as best you can and wrap it with a bandage or splint if necessary, then bind it tightly.
If you feel a broken splinter in there, then cut it open and remove the splinter; treat the wound with one of the treatments mentioned previously until it heals.
Chapter ten.
In setting the fracture of the hip bone.
Fractures of the hip bone are rare; when they do occur, the bone shatters at its ends and splits vertically, leaning inwards. The patient experiences pain at the site, pricking and numbness in the leg on that side.
To set it, pass your hand over it until you identify the fracture and its shape. If the fracture is limited to its ends only, restore its shape according to what appears suitable to resemble its natural form.
If the fracture is vertical or if it leans inwards, place the patient on their stomach until you can reset this fracture; once you have done so, bandage it and then apply a wooden splint or one made of leather, securing it tightly.
Do not fear displacement of the fracture or dislodgement of the splint, and correct any concavity at the waist with filling material to enable even compression; instruct the patient to sleep on their back or unaffected side, should hot swelling occur.
Cease any traction or resetting until the hot swelling subsides, then treat it as previously described and return to resetting and compressing as appropriate; should fragments of bone or shattered pieces at its ends be present, they must not be removed.
Do not disturb these but rather reset them externally as described earlier, then leave the splint in place until healing is complete.
Chapter eleven.
On setting fractures of the humerus.
The humerus is the bone between the elbow and shoulder joint. If it breaks, its setting proceeds in one of two ways: either by taking a curved, smooth rod of medium thickness that looks like this:.
Attach two ligatures at its ends, then suspend it from a high place and have the patient sit on a chair; next, lay his broken arm upon the rod such that his armpit sticks to the middle of its curve, then hang something heavy above him.
Or a servant stretches it downwards while the doctor aligns the fracture with both hands until he puts the break back in place; the other method is to have the patient lie on his back and attach his hand at his neck by means of a ligature.
Then instruct two servants to hold the arm above and below the fracture, respectively; each one of them stretches it in his direction. If you want more stretch, fasten a ligature under the break with another above it, then have each servant pull in their respective directions.
If the break is near the shoulder joint, the ligature should be placed under the armpit and another one below the fracture towards the elbow; likewise, if it's close to the elbow, you place the ligatures on those spots.
Then align the fracture gently without violence; once it's aligned properly and has healed well, you can tighten it unless a hot swelling appears, in which case leave its tightening for the seventh day and place over it a piece of wool soaked with vinegar and rose oil.
When the swelling has subsided, then apply the bandage; and the way to do this is: place the pad on the fracture, cover it with a roll of new cloth, gather the arm around the upper-arm itself, placing the hand open upon the shoulder.
Cover the cloth and bandage on upper arm and forearm to serve as a splint, unless something prevents you from doing so or if there is any change in the broken bone, in which case use a splint instead.
Use a splint that is wider and stronger than the others, placed directly on the fracture itself; leave a finger's breadth between each splint, with their length determined by the fracture plus three fingers' width at either end.
Then bandage it as described in the first chapter.
Make sure that the bandaging is tighter around the area of the fracture itself.
The further the fracture is from its original position, the looser the bandaging should be. If you consider it appropriate to apply splints and bandages as we have described at the moment of treating the injury, then do so.
If you fear that there may be a hot swelling, leave off the bandaging and splints until the seventh day as we have described earlier; then check the bandage every three days to prevent itching or puffiness developing in the area, or to ensure that nourishment continues to reach the limb unhindered by excessive tightness of binding. Repair any such problems according to what has been mentioned above.
If you are confident that none of these problems will occur, leave the bandage in place for many days; have the patient lie on their back with their hand resting on their stomach and a pillow stuffed full of wool placed beneath their upper arm to support it comfortably.
Inspect at all times, day or night, to ensure the broken limb maintains its shape and the bandage does not loosen. Repair any damage diligently. Provide the patient with a diet as previously described; begin with light food until the bone begins to mend.
You should gradually increase the patient's diet. The upper arm and leg usually take forty days to heal, at which point you must remove the bandage; they may then use a bath and be treated with ointments suitable for that purpose. If the break was severe and damaged.
Do not remove the bandage until fifty days or two months have passed.
Chapter Twelve.
On setting broken arms.
The arm consists of two bones, called the ulna and radius; the smaller one is next to the thumb, while the larger rests underneath it. The larger bone may break alone or the smaller one by itself; they can also fracture together.
Should the upper smaller bone fracture, it will be easier to set and heal quickly. If the lower larger one breaks, it is a worse injury that takes longer to recover from. The worst scenario would be if both bones break at once. If only the smaller bone is broken...
The physician must extend the limb gently until it is aligned when setting the smaller bone. If the larger one breaks, a more pronounced extension is necessary. In the event of both bones breaking, even greater force must be applied.
The hand's shape should be positioned during setting and extension, laid out flat on a pillow, with the thumb elevated above all fingers, and the little finger lower than all other fingers. The patient should sit cross-legged.
The pillow should be at an equal height to avoid any strain for the patient.
Then the assistant should extend the arm from below, either by hand or with a bandage. Another assistant stretches it from above as well. The physician then aligns the bone to restore it to its best possible shape. If there are fragments in the broken bone, they must be removed.
Return each fragment to its place as best you can. If an extruded fragment is seen, and it pierces the skin but cannot be set, then make an incision over it and remove it in the manner described previously. In the case of a fracture accompanied by a wound, this has been dealt with in a separate chapter.
Refer to that chapter for the treatment of this. If a hot swelling appears at the beginning of setting, apply a liniment of al-Qiratti made with rose oil and white wax. It should be of medium thickness between thick and thin, and gently tied onto the swelling until it subsides.
Remove the al-Qiratti preparation, apply a dressing made of fine wheat flour and egg white, then replace the splints. The splint that goes over the fracture should be slightly wider and stronger. Note that there are usually six splints used for an arm fracture.
If the fracture is in one or both ulna bones, then tighten your splinting over the fracture site stronger and tighter. As you wrap upwards or downwards, make the wrapping slightly looser according to what was mentioned at the beginning of this chapter.
Let the bandages that are wrapped around the fracture be soft and moist, not very hard; let the thread with which it is bound be made of linen, especially one that is medium between thin and thick as we have described, and inspect the limb and binding after several days.
If something needs to be rectified, like itching occurring in the limb, it is best that the limb be sponged with warm water until this itching subsides and let the limb remain unbound for a night so as to rest then resume binding.
If the binding has loosened and the bone has shifted or something similar, then repair all of that to your utmost ability; also look over it carefully for if nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb due to excessive binding you must loosen it slightly and let several days pass so as nourishment may reach it then resume binding.
If nothing we have mentioned happens to the patient then it should not be unbound except after twenty days or something similar, then hang the patient's arm from their neck and let his forearm rest horizontally; he must do his utmost to avoid erratic movements and should sleep on his back.
Know that this fracture of the arm will be healed in thirty days or perhaps in thirty-two; and it may even heal in twenty-eight days, all depending on temperaments and conditions of strength.
Chapter 13.
On the setting of fractures of the hand and fingers.
The carpal bones of the hand and phalanges are rarely subject to fractures but rather contusions occur frequently; thus, whenever a fracture or contusion occurs in the hand...
The patient should sit cross-legged with a chair in front of them at the same level.
Then he places his hand on it, stretched out; then the bone-setter extends the broken bones and the physician aligns them until they unite well. When this is done, the bandage should be applied along with the splint if no hot swelling occurs, then a splint is placed over the top according to the location.
Having wrapped it in a soft cloth, if the fracture is directed downwards towards the palm of the hand then make something like a ball out of some cloth and have the patient grasp this with their broken hand before you then tighten it with a long strip of cloth.
The splint should be made of soft leather so that it conforms to the flexures in the palm and you tighten this as required; if, however, the fracture is directed outwards then a splint must be applied above and another below at the hand such that the hand remains open and outstretched.
The tightening is then carried out as the hand rotates and you tie between the fingers; if, however, the fracture involves one of the finger bones then for the thumb this must be aligned before being tightened with the palm or, if preferred, a small upright splint may be applied to support the fracture.
The bone must not move; for fractures to the other fingers such as the middle, index, little or ring then these are aligned and tied alongside the next healthy finger or you may tie them all together which is better still or place a small upright splint upon them.
As we said for the thumb, check during and after reduction for hot swelling which you treat as previously described.
Chapter Fourteen.
The Setting of the Femur Fracture.
The thighbone is often fractured and can be felt because it moves forward and backward, and its fracture is reduced by a bandage above the break and another below it; the patient must lie on his face during this operation.
Then each bandage is drawn taut, one to either side evenly; this if the fracture be in the middle of the bone, but when it is near the hip joint, a soft bandage should be used, made of wool or some such thing.
In a fracture near the hip joint, the bandage is applied higher up towards the groin to give extension upwards; and the other below the break. The same with fractures close to the knee, when the bandage must be placed lower down so as to extend downwards. Then the surgeon should reduce the bone by both hands to restore it to its natural shape.
The bone will unite well, and then it is necessary to maintain the bandaging and reduction unless there should be a hot swelling of the limb; but if such occurs, wait several days until this subsides before resuming treatment.
As for the bandaging, a stiff and wide turban should be wound twice or thrice around it in splints; leaving some remaining length to be pulled tight over this. Then twist the leg so that the heel reaches near the buttock joint and pass a long cord between thigh and shin just below the knee, bringing its ends up on either side above.
The remaining length is then wound around the leg and thigh, followed by splints applied to the thigh at the fracture site itself; these are made into one single splint for the shin bone also. After that, stuff soft cloths between the thigh and shin so as to achieve an even tension.
First, start with a strong pull from the center towards the fracture site with three or four wraps; as you move further away from the fracture site with your binding, make your pulls less intense and more gentle and relaxed.
Then take the ends of the thread that you had passed between the thigh and the leg, use them to tie together what follows from above on the splints; then pass the ends of the thread downwards until you reach the ankle, where you will also tighten both ends of the splint from the other side.
So that the bandage does not shift from its place, you should then leave it tight until there is no longer any pain or swelling in the limb nor any other sign of inflammation; but if anything like this occurs, then immediately loosen and re-tie it as needed to correct whatever occurred according to what we have already explained several times.
If there is a piece of bone protruding and piercing, you should try to smooth it over if possible; otherwise make an incision on top of it and remove the fragment, then treat the wound in the manner described previously until it heals. It may be possible to bandage this fracture without having to add splints to the leg as well.
It can be bandaged in the manner described previously for the arm and forearm, although bandaging it thus does not necessarily result in a limp; however, if you were to splint only this bone without adding splints for the leg as well, then there is no doubt that the patient will always have a limp.
Note that the thigh bone typically heals in fifty days or a little more, and sometimes less; all of this depends on variations in temperament as well as other factors at play.
Chapter 15.
[On fracture of the knee-pan.]
The knee-pan is rarely subject to fracture and may more often be bruised, but if it does become fractured, this will either take the form of a fissure or fragmentation of its component parts; this occurs both with and without injury.
You will perceive all of this through sensation, and set it by aligning the dispersed component parts with your fingers until they are joined together and aligned as well as you can manage given consideration for gentleness and precision; then apply a dressing and, should it be necessary, a round splint.
You will then bind it tightly above the corresponding ligature, after which you should closely monitor for all conditions described previously in relation to other fractures such as hot swelling and so forth; treating each symptom accordingly until healing is complete.
Chapter Sixteen.
[On setting the fracture of the leg.]
The leg comprises two bones, one thick and known as the tibia, the other thin and called the fibula; they are subject to fractures of a similar nature to those affecting the humerus and radius. For this reason, its setting is akin to that of the arm and involves similar procedures; if both bones are fractured, the leg will turn in all directions, but if only the thinner bone is affected it will turn forward; should the thicker one be fractured below it may present complications which need not be outlined here.
Apply extension and alignment, then bind the splints accordingly; however, should it be a severe fracture with many fragments, you will need to exercise less force in extending it and proceed more gently during the setting of the bone.
In the treatment of the leg, there is an additional procedure compared to that for the arm: Once you have adjusted the splints and finished all your work, take two flat splints made from pine wood, which are used to level room floors between the cracks in boards, or they can be made from palm leaves or similar.
Choose those that are slightly thick and not too thin, with a length equal to the leg from knee to ankle. Then wrap each one in two pieces of cloth along its length, placing one on the side of the leg and the other on the opposite side.
Let them extend from the knee to below the foot. Then tie the two splints at three points, at both ends and in the middle. With these bindings, the leg will be prevented from leaning either right or left and it will be properly aligned. Alternatively, a gutter-like wooden device along the length of the leg may also be used.
This is placed to prevent movement, and it is especially necessary in cases of fracture with accompanying wound. Then examine the leg each day, taking great care regarding swelling or puffiness, as well as other matters. If any such issue arises, address it appropriately until the problem is resolved. The leg bone will heal in around thirty days.
Chapter Seventeen.
On the breaking of leg bones and fingers.
The heel is never broken, but the leg bones can be fractured. Fingers are rarely broken as well; however, they are more often bruised.
If the leg bones are broken and you see that they have shifted against each other, let the patient place their foot on the ground as if standing upright while walking. Then stand up and put your own foot on top of the raised bone fragment and tread it down until they are level.
In order to return it back into its proper place, then take the bandages and splint from above and put a small board underneath the sole of the foot which has two flat ends; tighten them around the foot after wrapping it with rags and doing whatever else is required.
After three or four days, loosen the bandage and you will find that the bones are level whether they were broken or dislocated; perform as seems fit to you. And if some fingers are dislocated, manipulate them into place and align them as I have described for setting fingers of the hand.
Then make a splint for the broken finger running along its length and make it slightly wider than the finger; place under the foot this board that I described to you earlier, securing it tightly in place. If two or three bones are fractured then even more so.
Apply a splint of appropriate size to each broken finger and wrap it in soft cloth; tighten the board underneath the foot, ensuring that each end of the board extends slightly beyond the sole so as to achieve good alignment.
You should not forget to monitor all the symptoms we have mentioned regarding fractures and treat each symptom as required.
Chapter 18.
On the fracture of the woman's pubic bone and the man's penis.
When a woman's vagina is broken and she can only sit in a squatting position, then bend her slightly towards the back. Have someone hold her from behind, then have the midwife pack her vagina with cotton until it fills up completely and forms a ball-like shape inside her.
Then shake the woman and lift her hips slightly, and that cotton will come out until it reaches the opening of her vagina in a ball-like shape and the bone fracture is healed. Then place a bandage on her back, and whenever she wants to urinate, gently remove the cotton so that she can urinate.
Return it to its original position, then go back to the first bandage you applied. Repeat this process for around seven days and the fracture will heal. Alternatively, if you wish, take a sheep's bladder, tie one end of a hollow reed tube to it, and insert the entire bladder into her vagina.
Blow hard into the tube until the bladder inflates inside her vagina, and this will set the fracture. Then pack it with cotton and keep applying treatments for a few days as described earlier to heal the fracture. If the pubic bone of either men or women is broken, use this method.
Treat and stabilize it as described for the hip bone fracture earlier, you should be able to figure out the correct treatment easily for these rare fractures especially if one has some skill and understands my book well - indeed because most of the time the fracture itself will guide your treatment.
For a man's broken thigh, take the windpipe of a goose and insert his penis into it, then wrap it with a cloth bandage and bind it up. Leave it like this for around three days until healed.
Chapter 19.
In the setting of bone fractures with concomitant wounds.
One who presents with a fracture and a wound, especially if the bone is large such as the femur or humerus, should be bled immediately if the conditions for bloodletting are met, as we have explained previously.
If the wound is bleeding, one should quickly cauterize it by applying powdered green vitriol; if that is not available, then one should proceed with setting the fracture on the same day and not delay.
If there is no hot swelling, but if a warm swelling occurs, then one should delay setting the fracture until the ninth day, when the hot swelling has subsided; and one should not approach it on the third or fourth days at all, as it will cause bad symptoms.
If the broken bone is protruding through the skin and exposed, then one should try to reposition it gently with their hands; if this cannot be achieved by hand, then one should use an instrument made of iron that is seven or eight fingers in length for the purpose. Its width should be equal to the wound.
For this reason, it is necessary for the physician to have three or four of these instruments at hand, as required by the type of fracture being treated; they should be round with a slight thickness so that they do not bend when pressure is applied during use.
The instrument should have a sharp point with a hook at its end, and it should be thicker towards the top and much thinner from the middle to the bottom; this is its illustration:.
It is called 'perim' in Greek, meaning a small lever; the sharp, hooked end should be placed on the protruding bone and it should be pushed with one swift motion. Once the bone has been moved back into position to some degree of evenness, use the perim to level out the fracture ends.
If the broken end is thin and cannot be grasped firmly by the instrument, then you should cut off the end of that bone so that the instrument can grasp it properly. If you are still unable to reposition the bone as described, then cut it with an instrument similar in shape to those mentioned previously.
Or saw it with one of the saws in any way possible; then remove any remaining roughness or thin scales from the bone. If, after repositioning the bone, the patient still experiences severe pain, understand that the bone has not returned to its natural position.
If you are able to reposition the bone back to its natural place, then do so as it will greatly benefit the patient. Once the setting of the bone is complete, dip a cloth in black astringent wine, especially if it's summer; and avoid applying pitch or anything oily on the wound.
To prevent putrefaction and corruption, then apply splints after you have set the bone; leave the wound uncovered by cutting a hole in the bandages with scissors to fit the size of the wound.
Be extremely cautious and avoid tightening the bandages over the fracture at all costs, as ignorant physicians often do this, which can lead to death, gangrene, or a severe cold in their patients. Ensure your binding is loose and relaxed, contrary to the usual tight binding for fractures.
If the wound is bad or if it's a large one, and you're concerned about some of the adverse symptoms we've described, and if they are experiencing distressing pain in that area, then it would be inappropriate to apply splints here; instead, make bandages from sturdy cloths for use at those points where splints would have been applied, securing them tightly.
So, if after a day or two you see that the wound has begun to discharge pus, then remove from it the cloth you put on with ointment; and use instead our usual treatments for wounds involving poultices and ointments such as the 'four-ingredient' ointment and its likes; you should also release the bandage.
And check the wound each day in both evening and morning until it heals; you should elevate that member so as to let pus drain from it easily downward; if, after several days have passed since the wounding, there is still no healing or stopping of discharge then know there are small bone fragments present.
You should therefore explore the wound with a probe; whatever of those fragments is exposed, extract it and remove it; as for any that are not so exposed but instead press into that member causing pain, then saw them in order to cut them away and extract them by every means possible.
If the wound should exhibit cold or gangrene or some other form of corruption and putrefaction, then you should apply to each condition whatever treatment best suits its nature from among those previously described in their respective sections.
And one more thing you should bear in mind when I say it: if a large bone is broken and sticks out from that member, like the thigh or upper-arm bones and their likes among the larger members, then don't attempt to pull it back nor extract it. Many times death occurs from that, so leave it until it becomes gangrenous; perhaps it will fall off by itself after twenty or thirty days.
Then you treat the wound if you see a place for treatment, otherwise leave it.
Chapter Twenty.
Treatment of complications that occur after some fractures.
This complication often occurs after the healing of a fracture, especially near joints, resulting in disfigurement and potentially hindering the natural function of the affected limb.
If the complication is soft, apply medicines with astringent properties such as aloe, frankincense, myrrh, galbanum, and acacia, mixed with a tonic drink or egg whites, or vinegar.
Cover the complication with a compress, applying firm pressure and leaving it on for many days without loosening. Repeat this process several times until the complication resolves, or use a lead plate as a tight bandage.
Lead has properties that help heal various complications in limbs. If the complication has become hard and stubborn, and removal is necessary, make an incision from above to remove any protruding excess, or smooth it with a suitable tool until gone. Treat the resulting wound until healed.
Chapter Twenty-One.
Treatment of fractures after healing, addressing limbs that remain weak compared to their original state.
If a broken bone heals but the limb remains thin and weak afterward, this is due to many causes. One cause is either the frequent loosening and retightening of bandages in an improper manner, or excessive tightness of the bandages preventing nourishment from reaching the limb, or excessive and frequent application of plasters, or immoderate movements made at the wrong time, or a lack of blood and weakness in the patient's body.
To treat this, one should feed the patient and enrich their body until there is more blood within it, as well as using a bath, making them happy and joyful, and so forth. Then, apply pitch to the limb to draw nourishment to it, or keep applying plasters with warm water. Until nourishment flows within it and it returns to its natural shape.
Chapter Twenty-Two.
On treating broken bones if they heal crookedly, preventing proper movement.
Whenever there is a limb that has been healed after breaking, but it heals crooked or bulges with the broken bone complex and ugly. Unless the limb is prevented from its natural function, it is not necessary to accept the claim of those who say that one should break the limb at the head; many ignorant physicians and bonesetters did this in our country.
This action is highly blameworthy, leading to great danger, the least of which is damage; but if the crookedness and complexity are fresh, one should apply plasters with water in which relaxing herbs have been boiled, such as marshmallow leaves, roots, crown imperial, and so forth.
It is dressed with relaxing dressings such as carefully made diachylon, or saliva from the root of marshmallow is taken and mixed with chicken fat and sesame oil, and it is dressed [with this]; or fatty figs are taken, pounded with pigeon droppings and similar medicines that are called anti-healing agents.
The contracture might be resolved by constant, gentle rubbing with the hands and movement of the member in all directions at all times; if the curvature has become old, severe, and hard, then it becomes necessary to treat it with iron.
It is necessary to make an incision above [the penis], separate the bone connection, and cut away any remaining contracture or bone with small scissors, taking care to be gentle yet firm; then treat the wound as mentioned earlier until it heals.
Chapter 23.
A dislocation is the displacement of a joint from its position, causing hindrance to movement, deformation of the limb, and severe pain for the patient; therefore, whenever a person experiences a dislocation, it should be immediately reduced.
It should not be delayed at all; if it is, the area will become swollen and inflamed, making reduction of the dislocation difficult. Therefore, it must not be postponed or moved during this time, as it often leads to spasm and severe pain for the patient.
However, if this occurs, it is necessary to immediately perform venesection on the patient and leave them until the swelling subsides somewhat; then the limb should be loosened with hot water and oil before being reduced gently. Each limb will be treated as described in its respective section.
I have also arranged the chapters on jaw fractures according to what has been previously presented regarding bone fractures, from the top of the body down to the bottom.
Chapter 24.
In treating the lower jaw.
Fractures of both jaws are rare; when they do occur, the dislocation can be of one of two types: either a slight dislocation from their normal positions with some relaxation, or a complete dislocation resulting in full relaxation. Until the patient's saliva flows towards their chest, and they are unable to hold it in or close their mouth, and their tongue becomes impeded while speaking; if the dislocation is slight then in most cases it will correct itself with minimal intervention.
If the dislocation is complete, you must act quickly and not delay in correcting it; this involves having an assistant hold the patient's head while the physician inserts their thumb into the origin of the jaw inside the mouth if only one side is affected.
Alternatively, if both sides are affected, the physician should insert both thumbs and use their other fingers externally to apply pressure, instructing the patient to relax and move their jaw in all directions while the doctor gently moves and pushes the jaw back into its proper position.
If it is difficult to reposition the jaw, especially if both jaws are affected, apply hot compresses and oil to facilitate the process as described earlier; do not delay in doing so. Once the jaws have been realigned and the mouth can close without relaxation, then apply cloth pads with a cerate made of wax and rose oil.
Then it is gently tied with a loose bandage, and the patient sleeps on his back with his head resting between two pillows so that he does not move to either side, nor need chew anything; but let his food be soft broth.
When the pain is gone and the jaw has healed, let him eat whatever he likes; let him do so gently and not force himself to open his mouth too wide when eating or drinking, nor yawning until the jaw has healed completely.
If it is difficult to restore the jaws when they become dislocated at some point and do not return to their places, often this leads to fevers and constant headaches; perhaps the patient's stomach becomes upset or perhaps he vomits several times without anything coming out. If you see these symptoms, know that the jaw has suffered irreparable damage.
Often such patients die within ten days.
Chapter 25.
Regarding the repositioning of the clavicle and shoulder joint.
The clavicle rarely dislocates towards the inner side due to its connection with the chest; it may, however, dislocate outwards and this can be felt by touch. To treat it, let the patient lie on his back and stretch out both arms.
Then press the affected area with your palm firmly until it returns to its place; then bind it and bandage it tightly. As for the end of the clavicle that is close to, and articulates with, the shoulder, it rarely dislocates but if it does at some point you must replace it as we mentioned before and as you see fit.
Then you apply the dressing, bandages, and compression, and instruct the patient to rest and remain still until they recover. With this exact treatment, you can also reset a dislocated shoulder.
Chapter 26.
In resetting the shoulder joint.
Know that the shoulder can dislocate in three ways: first, it can dislocate towards the armpit and down; second, it can dislocate towards the chest; and third, it can also dislocate upwards past the shoulder, which is rare.
It does not dislocate to the back of the shoulder blade or forward towards the neck, but mostly it dislocates and comes out downwards towards the armpit, especially in those with less muscle mass, as it pops out quickly and can be reduced just as fast.
As for those with more muscular build, it is the opposite; that is to say, the dislocation comes out with difficulty and goes back in with difficulty as well. Perhaps some people may suffer a blow or fall, causing the shoulder to become hot and swollen, which may be mistaken for a dislocation. It is necessary to examine this carefully until you are certain.
At that point, you should begin treatment. To identify a dislocation downwards towards the armpit, compare it to the healthy shoulder; you will find an obvious difference and notice the head of the humerus is not in its socket. When touching under the armpit, you will feel the head of the bone like an egg.
The patient will not be able to lift their arm up to their ear or move it in all directions. Similarly, if the dislocation is towards the chest or upwards, these differences are apparent upon examination and cannot be missed.
This jaw can be easily reset if it is soft or the patient is a child, and the procedure is as follows: have an assistant lift their hand above the patient's head; then place your thumbs under the patient's armpits and lift the joint forcefully upward to its correct position, while the assistant lifts and extends their arm upwards.
Then lower it back down and it will quickly return to its place. If this does not work, and the jaw has been dislocated for many days, the patient should be bathed in hot water using a concoction of herbs that relaxes and softens, such as marshmallow root, fenugreek, and rosemary, which have been boiled together.
The patient should then lie on their back with a woolen ball placed under their armpit, of moderate firmness. The physician places their heel on the ball and grasps the patient's hand in their own, extending it downward.
The physician should then press down on the ball with their foot, and the jaw will return to its place. Alternatively, the procedure can be performed with an assistant of greater height standing alongside the patient; the assistant places their shoulder under the patient's armpit and lifts them upward until they are suspended in midair. Another assistant should pull the patient's hand down toward their lower abdomen. If the patient is light, something else should be added to weigh them down. The jaw will return instantly; this procedure can also be performed in another manner.
An alternative method involves inserting a long pole into the ground, with its head rounded like the end of a mortar, neither too thick nor too thin; place a soft cloth on top of this and position the patient's armpit over it while they stand perpendicular to the length of the pole.
Then extend his hand downwards from the other side and also stretch his body forcefully from the opposite side, then the joint will quickly return to its place. If it is difficult to put it back with all that we have mentioned, then use this treatment: take a plank about two arms' lengths long. Its width should be about four fingers, its thickness two fingers; let it have a rounded head so that it can easily be inserted into the armpit. It will look like this: [image].
Then tie soft rags around the rounded head so that the plank does not hurt the patient; place it under the armpit and stretch out the whole arm with its hand downwards on top of the plank, and then tie the latter to the upper arm, forearm, and tip of the hand.
The arm is then placed on a crossbar of the ladder horizontally, and the hand stretched downwards while leaving the rest of his body suspended from the other side; this way the joint will quickly re-enter its socket. Once it has entered in any manner possible, one must place under the armpit a wool ball of moderate size.
After this, you must apply the dressing prepared from flour dust with frankincense and egg white over the entire shoulder as if it were being rotated; then pull down on the ball forcefully from under the armpit, wind a bandage tightly around the dressing above, and tie his hand to his neck.
He must not move his arm for seven days, and during this time the patient should receive little nourishment so that the limb becomes stronger; which is quicker in healing it. After five or seven days you may untie him and start exercising him gradually through movement. If the joint does not become lax again he will have healed.
If the joint dislocates repeatedly due to moisture or another ailment, cauterization with three pieces of metal should be employed as previously discussed in the section on cauterization. If you perform all this and loosen the bandage after seven days yet the joint remains unstable,
I rebandaged and tightened it several times, but it kept slipping out of place, becoming limp and flaccid. You should know that the nerve in the shoulder joint has either snapped or stretched too far, meaning that this joint will never stay put.
For the jaw that lies towards the chest and breasts, one should push it back into place with both hands until it is repositioned properly; afterward, apply any other treatment necessary for healing. If there's later pain in the affected area or sluggish movement...
The patient should go to the bathhouse many times until that stiffness eases up, returning to its original state.
Chapter 27.
Treatment of the elbow joint.
The elbow dislocates with difficulty, and it's similarly difficult to get back into place too; it can pop out in all directions but especially forward or backward. Its dislocation is obvious because you can see and feel the joint, so there's no mistaking what shape it's gotten itself into.
When you compare the dislocated elbow to its healthy partner, it's obvious that something is wrong due to the depressed joint surface. The arm cannot bend and will not touch the shoulder. One must act quickly to reduce this dislocation before swelling sets in.
If it should present a hot and hard swelling, it may be difficult to cure, and perhaps never heal at all, especially if the jaw is displaced backwards; for this is the worst of all kinds of dislocation, being the most painful and deadly.
Immobilizing it, if it is possible to reposition, the servant extends his hand with both hands and arm stretched out; the physician's hands are above and below the elbow, pushing the joint with both thumbs or the base of their palm until it returns to its place.
If the jaw is dislocated forward, it may be repositioned by bending the hand in one swift motion so as to strike with the base of their palm against the shoulder that aligns with it; if this does not cause the jaw to return then employ a strong and vigorous pulling action which requires two servants to extend the arm.
The patient is held by two servants to prevent movement during the pull, then the arm is rotated in all directions after wrapping a folded cloth or wide bandage around their hand; prior to handling the joint with his hands, the physician greases them so as to facilitate smooth movement of the joint.
The joint is then pushed back into place with force, and after repositioning it should be bandaged firmly with a compress that applies pressure and drying agents along with egg whites; the arm is suspended from the patient's neck for several days.
The bandage is then removed, and if the joint remains stable in its position the compress can be unbound; however, should the joint not feel firm enough it must be re-bandaged with more pressure and left again for several days until it does feel firm at which point the binding may be unfastened. Once this has been done, palpate the area around the joint to ensure there is no pain or swelling present post-repositioning and unbinding.
If there is difficulty in movement, use moistening treatment in the bath and gentle massage with friction until it becomes supple. Alternatively, place a leg of a well-fed sheep on the joint, then bind it and leave it there for a day and night. Then remove it and take him into the bath; if he perspires, rub the joint moderately.
Then return the leg again, once and twice and thrice, with entries into the bath until it softens. If you wish to put on him moist cow manure lightly with butter, tie it onto him; do this several times and it will soften and return to its original state.
Chapter 28
On the treatment of wrist dislocation.
The wrist often dislocates, and its reduction is easy compared to other joints; however, it should be quickly reduced when the dislocation occurs before any swelling or hot inflammation develops around the joint.
Reduction of the dislocation is done by placing the patient's wrist on a board, extending the assistant's arm, and applying force with the palm of the hand over the joint's prominence to push it back in place; however, one must ensure that the reduction did not occur towards the palmar side.
If the dislocation is towards the dorsal side, the patient should place their palm on the board during extension and reduction; if it's towards the palmar aspect, they must place the back of their hand against the board so that the physician's hand can be placed over the same prominence to achieve reduction. If immediate reduction occurs, nothing further is needed; otherwise, apply a compressive dressing to reduce swelling.
Leave it alone and do not attempt reduction again as this joint cannot tolerate such manipulations, especially after a few days have passed since the dislocation occurred; however, leaving it reduced improperly will cause an angular deformity of the joint without much harm to the patient unless the hand becomes flaccid and unable to grasp objects.
When you know the nerve has been severed or badly bruised, there is no remedy except to treat it with cauterization; this may help and sometimes does not work at all. Once the wrist joint has been set then apply a dressing as described above, then bandage firmly and leave for five days.
Then remove the bandage and exercise the hand; if movement is not possible and there's any sign of stiffness, then ease it by applying warm water and massage repeatedly until it becomes supple.
Chapter 29.
On the treatment of dislocated fingers.
Fingers may dislocate in any direction. If a finger dislocates towards the back of the hand or palm, straighten it and push the dislocation with your thumb until it returns to its normal position; then tie up the end of the finger and bandage it so that it hangs towards the side where it dislocated.
Leave it for two days, then release and straighten the finger until it is completely upright on that day; if it's night time bandage as before but leave off during the daytime to exercise and train movement of the finger and re-bandage at night continuing this process each day until it regains its strength.
And so you do the same if it dislocates towards the palm of the hand, bandaging in the direction of that side and treat as before until cured; likewise for any other direction of dislocation.
Chapter 30.
On the treatment of dislocated vertebrae.
When a vertebra from the back or neck is completely dislocated, or when many vertebrae are displaced from their proper places, there is no treatment for it because death quickly overtakes the patient.
A sign of this is that the patient's stool comes out involuntarily, and they cannot control it; often some of their limbs become limp: either their legs or arms, or just one of them. If a single vertebra becomes displaced from its proper place, it can usually be put back into position.
The dislocation can occur in four directions: if the vertebra moves backward, it is called a hunchback; however, there is no treatment for this and complete recovery cannot be expected. If the hunchback has occurred due to a fall or blow of some kind, then...
Early writers have described various treatments for this, in long texts that are not of much use; I have selected the most useful parts and simplified them to make my meaning clear. The instrument used is different from what they describe.
If the hunchback is caused by a forward curvature of the chest, there's no remedy and it can't be cured; the same goes for those curved to either side. The only treatable type is that which curves backward in the upper back region; this can be treated with the method I am about to describe: lay the patient face down...
on a flat bench, near to a wall; place some soft, damp material underneath them so as not to hurt their chest. Next, insert into the ground at one end of the bench a vertical wooden post and another at the other end, towards their feet.
A servant then holds the first post, ensuring that it is not too firmly fixed into the ground; another servant holds the other post in a similar manner. Some soft yet strong bandages are then wrapped around the patient's chest and under their armpits, and one end of this cloth is attached to the post by their head and tied there securely.
Then you should tighten another bandage over his hips and above his knees, as well as at his ankles; then gather all the ligatures together, tying them to the other board which is placed near his feet. Then each servant should pull towards their side of the board using the ligaments, without shifting either of the boards from where they have been positioned.
But they are not documented as we said, and the doctor places his palms firmly on the bead until it returns to its original place or he puts a board upon it then leans onto the board with both feet until it goes back into place; if this treatment does not work, take another piece of wood that is about three arms-length long.
You should carve a space into the wall, as we said it must be near the patient's bed, in which you place one end of the board; then put the middle of the plank on the hump and have the doctor place his feet at the other end while he pulls firmly so that pressure is exerted upon the bead.
And it will return to its place; if you wish, you can instead use the screw which is turned by hand; this means embedding in the ground near the patient's head at one end of the bed two planks that are an arm-length long each and then another pair of similar length at his feet on the other side of the bed.
And there should be a space of one span between each board, with holes drilled into every board through which the screw will pass; all these boards must then be fastened tightly to the ground so that they cannot move at all and you insert a cylindrical stick – this is the screw around which you wind the rope – inside the holes in both boards.
At one end there is a hole in which you fasten a rod about one span long by twisting; the two other boards are made likewise, then you should tighten the ligature that was wrapped around the patient's chest to the screw near his head and the bandages that were tied around his legs to the screw located at his feet.
Then, at each coil, a servant stops and twists his hand with the tool that is used to twist the coil, while the physician smooths out the hump as we have described. This is an illustration of the coil, the mallet, and the patient.
Once the vertebrae are realigned and the area is even, you should apply a drying bandage with egg whites, followed by a dressing. Then place above the bandage a splint made of a board that is three fingers wide or so, and its length should cover the hump site.
Over it, place some smooth beads and secure with the appropriate bandage. The patient should consume a light diet until healed. If there remains some protrusion in the area after healing is complete, one must employ remedies that relax and soften while continuing to use the board as described for an extended period.
A lead plate may be used for this purpose. Occasionally, a protrusion may appear at the end of the spinal vertebrae, leading to the assumption of dislocation. However, this could be an additional bone that has protruded, and one must not subject it to such treatment, as death might occur.
Chapter Thirty-One.
On the treatment of dislocated hip.
Be aware that the hip and shoulder joints are susceptible to dislocation but not to minor displacement or concavity, which can affect other joints. The hip joint can become dislocated in four ways.
This is due to the hip joint dislocating inward, outward, forward, or backward. It most commonly dislocates inward and rarely forward or backward. A sign of inward dislocation is when you pair the patient's healthy leg with the affected one, resulting in an apparent length difference.
The knee is more prominent than usual, and the patient cannot bend their leg at the groin; the area around the groin becomes noticeably swollen because the head of the femur has moved there.
The signs for someone with a dislocated jaw towards the outside are opposite to these symptoms, and for those with a forward dislocation, their leg will be fully extended but cannot bend without pain in the knee; if they try to walk, they cannot do so forward.
Their urine is retained, and their groin becomes swollen; when walking, they step on their heels. The signs for a dislocated jaw towards the back are an inability to straighten or bend the knee without first bending the groin, and their leg is also shorter than the other.
The groin is relaxed, and the head of the femur is clearly at the hip joint. As for treating the various types of dislocated jaw, if it is an old injury that has been with the patient for a long time, and no attempt to treat it was made before now, then there is no hope for treatment.
You should not attempt to treat it, but for a recent dislocation, regardless of type or direction, you should start by twisting the joint and stretching it inwards and outwards while moving it both ways; perhaps...
It might return to its place and require no further treatment; if not, you should prepare a strong servant who will pull on the leg from below with either their hands or a bandage tied above the knee, while another servant pulls upwards.
By inserting their hands under the patient's armpits and then pulling with a soft bandage tied around the top of the thigh; another servant holds the other end of the bandage, and they pull either from the front towards the shoulder joint or from behind towards the spine.
He should pull them all at once until the patient's body is lifted from the ground and remains suspended, for this type of traction is common to the four types; if the jaw returns as we have said, otherwise each type must necessarily undergo the specific treatment I mention.
As for its specific treatment if the jaw is pulled inward, one should lay the patient on their right side and then place a bandage on the origin of the thigh between the head of the femur and the spot just under the groin.
Then the ligament is pulled upward from the groin area towards the upper body in the direction of the clavicle, then another strong servant takes hold with both arms and embraces the thick part of the patient's thigh, pulling it outward forcefully until it returns to its proper place.
This type is easier than the other methods used to treat this condition, but if it proves impossible and the patient refuses to undergo this treatment in any way, then one should tie both of their legs together with a strong yet soft bandage around the heels and at the knees.
The distance between each leg and its companion should be about four finger-widths, with the affected leg extended further than the other by two fingers; then the patient is suspended from a wooden beam in the house at a height of about two arms' length above the ground.
Then you instruct a strong boy to embrace the head of the thigh, and another boy hangs onto the patient while pushing against the one embracing the thigh with force so that the joint returns quickly to its place; as for treating it specifically when the jaw is pulled outward...
The patient should lie on the operating table as we described for the hunchback, and a bandage should be tied around their ailing leg in particular, and also across their chest. Then place one stick at their feet and another at their head. Finally, place an additional stick firmly in the middle of the table.
Wet cloths should be wrapped around [the sticks] so that they do not hurt the patient, and the stick is placed between their thighs to prevent them from being pulled down when stretched. Then each servant pulls in their direction while the physician aligns the hip with their hands; if it resists returning,
Otherwise, place a board on top and apply pressure as mentioned in the hunchback treatment. However, the patient should lie on their right side instead. If dislocation is forward, you must extend their leg at once while they are in this same position on the table.
The physician places the palm of their right hand on the patient's groin and pushes it with their other hand, applying pressure which stretches downward toward the knee. If dislocation is rearward, the patient should not be extended downwards.
They should be elevated off the ground, resting on a solid object instead; their dislocated hip must protrude outwards as described when lying face-down on the table with bindings tightened.
As mentioned earlier, pressure with a board should also be applied to the location where the joint has popped out of place; once the hip joint returns as it ought and its restoration is evident—you know this when extending the patient's legs...
If you see them aligned and the patient can flex his leg and extend it without difficulty, then know that the limb has returned to its proper state. At this point, bring together the thighs and apply the dressing, securing it firmly with a bandage so that the hip does not move in any direction.
The patient must remain at rest for three or four days, after which you should loosen the bandages and compare the leg to the other one; if they are of equal length then know that the fracture has healed properly and allow the patient to walk. If there is still some relaxation in it.
If not, return and re-dress it, tightening the bandage as before. Leave it for three more days then loosen it again; let him walk on it slowly for several days until it gains strength, God willing.
Chapter 32 (or Chapter XXXIII)
On the treatment of knee dislocation.
The knee dislocates in three ways: inward, outward, and downward (or backward). It never dislocates forward. To detect a dislocation, ask the patient to bring his leg up against the thigh.
If the leg does not attach to the thigh, then know that the knee is dislocated. To set all types of dislocation: have the patient sit with their legs extended (if they can manage it) and have a servant sit behind them, holding their waist and slightly bending them backward; you should then sit on their thighs.
Rest your back against their face and place their leg between yours; secure their knee with both hands, interlinking your fingers over it, then press the sides of the knee firmly with your palms; meanwhile another servant should extend his leg to help return the knee to its proper position.
A sign of the reduction is that the leg adheres to the thigh in a relaxed manner without force, then bandage it and attach the leg to the thigh, securing them both with a bandage for three or four days. Afterward, release [the patient], but do not allow them to walk much for several days until they are strengthened.
If you find it difficult to reduce the dislocation as we have described, then use strong traction with bandages which I will describe later in my treatment of hip dislocations until reduction is achieved.
Chapter 33.
Treatment of dislocation of the calcaneus.
The calcaneus may become slightly dislocated or completely dislocated, and this can occur either inwardly or outwardly. The sign of a complete dislocation is the swelling of the calcaneus which becomes prominent in the direction it has dislocated to.
Treatment of its slight dislocation is simple and it can easily be reduced by gentle traction with the hands until it is realigned, but if completely dislocated then: the patient should sit upright and a strong servant [or assistant] should stand behind them, supporting their back at waist level.
You then grasp their foot with your right hand at the top and with your left hand underneath, near the Achilles tendon [calcaneal tendon]. Pull twice on the foot towards you using both hands, then pull again with your left hand while pushing the sole of the foot upwards with your right hand. This should be done without force.
Repeat this procedure two times as described, then in the third [time] push the sole of their foot towards their leg while pulling on the Achilles tendon; if the calcaneus is reduced after one or two repetitions and you see that the foot is aligned, but if not repeat the above process until reduction occurs.
If it is impossible for you to reverse it as described, and otherwise, place the patient on their back on the ground, firmly embed a stake in the ground between their thighs, with cloth wrapped around it so as not to hurt the patient, then have an assistant hold their thigh.
Then another assistant should stretch the leg either with their hands or by tying it to the man's neck, and then each assistant stretches in the opposite direction of his partner while the stake remains upright between the patient's thighs for support so that the body is not pulled downwards during stretching, finally the physician realigns the jaw using both hands.
Another assistant holds the healthy leg downwards, and when the jaw is quickly restored, if it returns to a correct position then take the bandage and splint and secure them with tight bindings, tie the foot below with another binding, you must be mindful of the nerve that lies above the heel from behind.
So as the binding is not too tight and does not harm it, then leave him for two or three days, if the bandage loosens then tighten it again before releasing it on the third or fourth day, and the patient should avoid walking for forty days.
If the patient tries to walk before this time period has passed, you cannot guarantee that the jaw will not dislocate again and become ruined beyond repair; if swelling or inflammation occurs then you must use what we have previously described elsewhere in the treatment of swellings until it subsides.
Chapter 34.
Treatment of the fingers of the foot.
The remaining portion should be gently and smoothly leveled without any force, which is not difficult but quite easy. If it is the jaw that is affected then the patient should place their foot on a flat surface on the ground.
Or on a plank while standing as if walking, then you should stand and place your foot on the protruding joint and press it firmly with your foot until it returns to its proper position and you can see that it has flattened without any remaining bump.
Then place under the sole of their foot a board that fits the entire foot and has two ends, then you should tie it tightly with a strong binding for three days before releasing it. You must prevent them from walking for many more days until it is strengthened and you are certain there will be no relapse, if God wills.
Chapter thirty-five.
On the types of dislocation that occur with an injury, or with a fracture, or both together.
Whenever any of these happen, it is best to treat the injury and set the fracture immediately because they often result in death.
Therefore, only the most skilled and experienced practitioner should attempt to treat such a case with great care and caution without any haste or recklessness. At first, they must apply remedies that ease hot swellings alone before proceeding further.
It is up to God's will, unless you believe the patient has a chance at recovery and relief from further injury then it should be your utmost priority to cure them swiftly before any hot swelling occurs.
If the joint returns to its proper position, then treat any hot swellings and care for the injury with suitable drying ointments. If there is a fracture of the jaw where fragments of bone have become detached then they must be removed. Follow that which we have mentioned about simple diseases in the preceding chapters on their respective locations.
Strive to avoid venturing into uncertain paths, as I have advised you before; that is better for your reputation and safer for your well-being, God willing.
