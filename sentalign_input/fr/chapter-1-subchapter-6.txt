of the distortion of the mouth
A condition that must be treated by cautery is only those that arise from phlegm, as we have said in the divisions of diseases; and do not make a cautery for those that come from dryness and nerve spasm.
When you treat this type of condition that comes from phlegm with purgatives and gargles for the head, and this does not help, then you must cauterize the patient with three cauteries: one at the root of the ear, the other a little above the temple, and the third at the junction of the two lips; and place the cautery on the part that appears healthy, and make a cautery at the top of the ear a little below the corner of the head, and another at the temple as long as a thumb; and leave the cautery on until half of the core is burned; and this is the shape of the cautery:
It is similar to the "cultellare" that we mentioned before, but it is a bit more subtle and the blade should be a bit thicker; afterward treat the spot as I mentioned before, until it is healed.
